    , Accepted 30th August 2018First published on 13th September 2018AbstractTernary blends have shown great potential to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we studied a ternary OSC system with a donor polymer (PM6) and two structurally similar non-fullerene acceptors (named ITCPTC and MeIC). Although these two small molecular acceptors (SMAs) exhibit similar absorption spectra, they introduce a surprising synergistic effect on tuning the domain size and crystallinity of the OSC blend. More specifically, MeIC is a SMA with strong crystallinity, which results in excessive phase segregation and large domain size for the PM6:MeIC binary blend. By adding a structurally similar and less crystalline SMA (ITCPTC) into the binary blend, the domain size and morphology of the blend are much improved without sacrificing the electron mobility of the blend. As a result, the optimal blend ratio of PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC (1:0.4:0.6) led to an impressive FF of 78.2% and PCE of 14.13%, which are the highest values reported for ternary non-fullerene OSCs reported to date.

Broader context
In the past decade, extensive research attention has been attracted to organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their advantages of light weight, flexibility and low cost. The active layer of an organic solar cell is typically made of an electron donor and an electron acceptor. The traditional electron acceptors, namely fullerene derivatives, suffer from several drawbacks including poor absorption in the visible region, limited energy level variability, and high synthesis and purification costs. Fortunately, the recent emergence of non-fullerene acceptors has overcome these limitations and enabled OSCs to move forward on a new journey. Thus, non-fullerene OSCs have developed rapidly in the last few years, including single-junction binary, ternary and multifunctional (e.g., tandem) OSCs. Among different systems of OSCs, ternary OSCs not only maintain the simplicity of the single-junction device architecture, but also offer many other advantages as discussed subsequently. In this work, we studied a ternary OSC system with a donor polymer (PM6) and two non-fullerene acceptors (namely ITCPTC and MeIC) with similar structures and absorptions. As a result, the optimal blend ratio of PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC (1:0.4:0.6) led to an impressive FF of 78.2% and PCE of 14.13%, which are the highest values reported for ternary OSCs reported to date.

Introduction
Significant progress has been made in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) in the past decade,1–5 and overall power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been achieved for single junction OSCs by employing fullerene derivatives as the acceptor, mainly because of the innovation of new donor materials and the optimization of the devices.6–8 However, fullerene derivatives suffer from some intrinsic drawbacks, such as weak absorption in the visible region and limited energy level tunability, which constrains the development progress of OSCs.9–16 Fortunately, the recent emergence of non-fullerene acceptors has overcome these limitations and enabled OSCs to move forward on a new journey.17–28 Thus, non-fullerene OSCs have developed rapidly in the last few years, including single-junction binary, ternary and multijunction (e.g., tandem) OSCs.29–34 Among different systems of OSCs, ternary OSCs not only maintain the simplicity of the single-junction device architecture, but also offer many other advantages as discussed subsequently.35–48
Unlike binary OSCs, ternary blend OSCs comprising one donor and two acceptors (or two donors and one acceptor) have been demonstrated as a useful approach to broaden the absorption spectra, achieve cascade energy levels and improve the morphology.49–58 From the absorption point of view, some low bandgap SMAs, such as ITIC and its derivatives, have been paired with large bandgap SMAs to enhance the absorption coverage.44 As for the cascade energy level, ICBA was employed as an electron-cascade acceptor material in PTB7:PC71BM blends to give enhanced open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF) and PCE.38 Morphologically, introducing a small molecule into a polymer-based blend is an effective method of increasing the crystallinity in ternary blends as well as improving the crystalline domain size of donor materials.45
Although various mechanisms explaining the role of the third components have been reported,35–54 most of the previous research focused on a third component that possessed a complementary absorption spectrum to the binary counterpart. In contrast, third components containing similar absorption spectra to the binary counterpart have been less studied, but can serve as an ideal platform to better understand the mechanism of the third components. In this work, we studied a ternary OSC system with a donor polymer (PM6) (poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))]59 and two structurally similar non-fullerene acceptors (namely ITCPTC (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-cyclopentane-1,3-dione[c]thiophe))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene) and MeIC (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-cyclopentane-1,3-dione[c]-1-methyl-thiophe))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene)).60,61 Although these two SMAs exhibit similar absorption spectra, they introduce a surprising synergistic effect on tuning the domain size and crystallinity of the OSC blend. More specifically, MeIC is a SMA with strong crystallinity, which results in excessive phase segregation and large domain size for the PM6:MeIC binary blend. By adding a structurally similar and less crystalline SMA (ITCPTC) into the binary blend, the domain size and morphology of the blend is much improved without sacrificing the electron mobility of the blend. As a result, the optimal blend ratio of PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC (1:0.4:0.6) achieved an excellent PCE as high as 14.13% with an impressive FF of 78.2%, which is significantly higher than those of binary systems based on ITCPTC (12.31%) or MeIC (13.04%). It is worth mentioning that the PCE of 14.13% and FF of 78.2% are the highest values reported for ternary non-fullerene OSCs reported to date.
The chemical structures of PM-6, ITCPTC and MeIC, and a scheme of the device structure are displayed in Fig. 1a. As shown in Fig. 1b, polymer donor PM-6 shows strong absorption in the range of 400–700 nm, which well complements the absorption spectra of the two acceptors. The acceptor MeIC shows a similar absorption spectrum to that of ITCPTC, from which the optical bandgaps are calculated to be 1.58 eV for both acceptors. Among the films with different compositions, the PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC (1:0.4:0.6, w/w) blend film exhibits the highest maximum extinction coefficients at 629 and 718 nm (Fig. 1c), which is beneficial for JSC. Fig. 1d presents the energy level diagrams of the materials used in the ternary solar cells. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of MeIC is −3.92 eV, slightly higher than that of ITCPTC (−3.96 eV). In addition, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of MeIC (−5.57 eV) is also between those of PM6 (−5.50 eV) and ITCPTC (−5.62 eV), which forms an energy cascade that could benefit charge collection.

The photovoltaic properties of the ternary solar cells fabricated in a conventional device structure: ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate))/PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC/ZrAcAc (zirconium acetylacetonate)/Al were evaluated. The weight ratios of PM6 and acceptors were kept at 1:1 in this work, while the composition of the acceptors was varied. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs are displayed in Fig. 2a, with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 1 and Table S1 in the ESI.† The PM6:ITCPTC binary blend device shows a high PCE of 12.31% with a VOC of 0.967 V, a JSC of 17.13 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.3%. In comparison with the ITCPTC-based binary device, the MeIC-based binary device showed a slightly higher PCE of 13.04% with a VOC of 0.993 V, a JSC of 18.47 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.1%, comparable to the device performance of our previously reported device based on J71:MeIC.61 Both binary OSCs demonstrated high FFs (>70%), indicating favorable morphologies formed in their active layers. Notably, the FF was increased from 71.1% to 76.1% after 20% of MeIC was replaced with ITCPTC. With simultaneous enhancements observed in FF, the PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC (1:0.4:0.6)-based ternary device achieved the best PCE (14.13%) with a VOC of 0.981 V, a JSC of 18.42 mA cm−2, and an excellent FF of 78.2%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 14.13% is one of the highest values for all ternary OSCs. The outstanding FF (78.2%) is the highest value for ternary OSCs,53,56,62–65 demonstrating good compatibility between the two acceptors. Fig. 2b shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, whose integrations provide JSCs consistent with those obtained from the J–V measurements with deviations of less than 2%.

To correlate the optical and electrical properties to the active layer morphology, we carried out grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to investigate the molecular packing and orientation of single component and ternary blend films (Fig. 3), and the corresponding GIWAXS parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3, the three single component films exhibit a dominant face-on molecular orientation, which is advantageous for charge transport in the direction relative to charge collection. In addition, MeIC shows much sharper π–π stacking peaks, reduced d-spacing (MeIC = 3.57 Å; ITCPTC = 3.69 Å) and enhanced crystal coherence length (CCL) (MeIC = 2.30 nm; ITCPTC = 1.40 nm) in the π–π stacking direction, demonstrating its stronger crystallization propensity than ITCPTC. By fitting the π–π (010) stacking peaks of the PM6:ITCPTC blend film at q ≈ 1.70 Å−1, a d-spacing distance of 3.69 Å and a CCL of 17.9 Å were determined. The lamellar (100) diffraction shows peaks at q ≈ 0.29 Å−1 and q ≈ 0.34 Å−1 (mostly in the in-plane direction), which are assigned to PM6 and ITCPTC, respectively. In contrast, the PM6:MeIC blend film shows a π–π (010) stacking peak at q ≈ 1.73 Å−1, which corresponds to a d-spacing distance of 3.63 Å and a CCL of 20.3 Å. The blend film of PM6:MeIC show stronger π–π stacking in the out-of-plane direction relative to the PM6:ITCPTC blend film, which could be ascribed to the improved crystallinity of MeIC compared with that of ITCPTC. The 40% ITCPTC blend exhibits a reduced diffraction signal at the π–π stacking position relative to the PM6:MeIC blend film, and a CCL of 18.5 Å in the (010) direction falls in between the CCLs of the two binary blend films, suggesting that the crystalline content of the blend film was reduced after introducing ITCPTC into the acceptors.

Fig. 4a presents the surface morphology of the binary and optimal ternary blend films, measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). In the AFM height images, the PM6:ITCPTC and PM6:MeIC blend films exhibit root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values of 1.46 and 3.08 nm, respectively. The rougher surface of PM6:MeIC could be attributed to the high crystallinity of MeIC. The ternary blend films delivered a moderate RMS of 1.63 nm compared with the two binary blends, consistent with the observations from GIWAXS. As the AFM phase images show, all the blends demonstrate well-distributed nanofibrillar structures, where the ternary blend film exhibits not only a favorable domain size compared to the PM6:MeIC binary blend, but also a more developed fibrillar texture than the PM6:ITCPTC binary blend. To confirm the favorable morphology of the ternary blend, a resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) experiment was performed.66 The photon energy of 285.8 eV was used to investigate the domain size and relative domain purity. The distribution of the scattering profiles can be fitted by lognormal functions, which represent the distribution function of spatial frequency (s, s = q/2π). Therefore, the distribution mode (smode) corresponds to the length scale of the characteristic pattern (domain spacing, ξ = 1/smode) and mode domain size (ξ/2). The q values of the PM6:ITCPTC and PM6:MeIC blends were 0.144 and 0.085 nm−1, respectively, and their corresponding domain sizes are 21.8 and 36.9 nm. The ternary blend with 40% ITCPTC content in the acceptors provides a slightly larger domain size (23.5 nm) than that of the PM6:ITCPTC blend. In addition, the relative domain purity was investigated by integrating the scattering profiles over q (, TSI is total scattering intensity). A higher TSI indicates purer average domains. The relative domain purities of PM6:ITCPTC, PM6:MeIC and the ternary blend with 40% ITCPTC content in the acceptors were calculated to be 0.85, 1 and 0.88, respectively. The balance between domain size and relative domain purity in the ternary blend films contributes to the FF of the corresponding OSCs, and thus a higher value was obtained.

We also found that the VOC decreases almost linearly with the increase of ITCPTC content. On the one hand, the higher LUMO level of MeIC than ITCPTC (Fig. 5a) contributes to the enhanced VOC. On the other hand, this relationship is consistent with the observation that the Thompson group reported when two fullerene acceptors were used and other recent reports on ternary systems.16,41,67,68 This indicates the formation of a new transport channel between MeIC and ITCPTC, and the VOC mainly depends on this new channel.35,41,69

(c) Jph–Veff curves of the binary and optimized ternary OSCs. (d) Hole and electron mobility of ternary blend films with different ITCPTC contents. 
To investigate the charge-recombination mechanism, we first studied the dependence of JSC on the illumination intensity (P), which can be described by a power-law relationship (JSC ∝ PS) (Fig. 5b), where S is the exponential factor related to bimolecular recombination.70,71 The fitted S values are 0.998, 0.961 and 0.954 for the optimized ternary, ITCPTC and MeIC-based OSCs, respectively. The S value for the optimized ternary OSC is close to unity, much higher than those for the binary blends, indicating that the ternary blend device possesses the weakest bimolecular recombination, which is consistent with its superb FF. In addition, in order to gain deeper insight into exciton dissociation and charge collection, we plotted the curves of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) in Fig. 5c. Jph is defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is obtained via Veff = V0 − Vbias, where Vbias is the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0.72,73 The ratio of Jph/Jsat relates to the charge collection and exciton dissociation efficiency, where Jsat denotes the saturation photocurrent density. The Jsat values of the optimized ternary, ITCPTC and MeIC-based devices are 19.00, 17.80 and 19.52 mA cm−2 at Veff ≥ 2.0 V, respectively. Under short circuit conditions, the Jph/Jsat ratios were calculated to be 0.970, 0.962 and 0.946 for the optimized ternary, ITCPTC and MeIC-based devices, respectively. Under the maximal power output conditions, the Jph/Jsat ratios were calculated to be 0.896, 0.851 and 0.804 for the optimized ternary, ITCPTC and MeIC-based devices, respectively. The large value of Jph/Jsat for the optimized ternary device indicates a better charge collection and extraction, also consistent with its high FF. Furthermore, the effect of ITCPTC content on the hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) in the ternary OSCs was investigated through the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. As shown in Fig. 5d and Fig. S1, Table S3 (ESI†), both the hole and electron mobilities in the ternary blend films were reduced with the increase of ITCPTC content. For the PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC (1:0.4:0.6) blend film, the most balanced μh/μe (6.81 × 10−4/4.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is observed. Upon further increase of the ITCPTC content, despite the fact that the hole mobility is significantly decreased, the electron mobility remains almost unchanged, and thus a more imbalanced carrier mobility is observed, which might be detrimental to the overall charge collection.74 In addition to the ternary blends, the electron mobilities of the ITCPTC:MeIC blends (without the polymer donor) with different ITCPTC contents were also investigated (Fig. S2 and Table S4, ESI†). The trend of electron mobilities in the ITCPTC:MeIC blends is similar to that observed in the ternary blends. These results confirm that ITCPTC has beneficial effects for balancing electron transport and carrier mobility.
To further understand the working principle of these ternary OSCs, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of ITCPTC and MeIC neat films and ITCPTC:MeIC blend films with different weight ratios (Fig. S3 in ESI†). The MeIC neat film shows a significantly enhanced emission at about 785 nm relative to that of the ITCPTC film. In the ITCPTC:MeIC blends, the PL intensity decreases with the increase of the ITCPTC content. There is almost a linear relationship between the ITCPTC content and the maximum PL intensity, indicating that energy transfer or charge transfer did not occur between ITCPTC and MeIC. Besides, a series of solar cells were fabricated with neat ITCPTC or MeIC or their blends as the active layers. As shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† the devices using ITCPTC and MeIC neat films gave JSC values of 0.13 and 0.15 mA cm−2, respectively. And the ITCPTC:MeIC-based device also showed a JSC of 0.15 mA cm−2. This result further confirms that charge transfer between the two acceptors is negligible.
In summary, high-performance ternary OSCs have been designed and fabricated with two non-fullerene electron acceptors, namely ITCPTC and MeIC, which have similar absorption spectra. In comparison with its binary counterparts, the ternary solar cell with 40% content of ITCPTC in the acceptors achieved the best PCE as high as 14.13% with a VOC of 0.981 V, a JSC of 18.42 mA cm−2 and an FF of 78.2%, which is significantly higher than those of binary systems based on ITCPTC (12.31%) or MeIC (13.04%). A synergistic effect of crystallinity and domain size/purity introduced by the two acceptors is observed. The acceptor ITCPTC reduces the crystallinity of the acceptor phase, whereas changing the content of MeIC relative to ITCPTC can fine-tune the relative domain purity and domain size, resulting in a controllable and favorable morphology. It is worth mentioning that the FF of 78.2% is the highest value for ternary non-fullerene OSCs reported to date. These results indicate that even for two acceptors with similar absorption spectra, a ternary system is still a promising approach to further push OSCs to a higher standard.

Broader context
In the past decade, extensive research attention has been attracted to organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their advantages of light weight, flexibility and low cost. The active layer of an organic solar cell is typically made of an electron donor and an electron acceptor. The traditional electron acceptors, namely fullerene derivatives, suffer from several drawbacks including poor absorption in the visible region, limited energy level variability, and high synthesis and purification costs. Fortunately, the recent emergence of non-fullerene acceptors has overcome these limitations and enabled OSCs to move forward on a new journey. Thus, non-fullerene OSCs have developed rapidly in the last few years, including single-junction binary, ternary and multifunctional (e.g., tandem) OSCs. Among different systems of OSCs, ternary OSCs not only maintain the simplicity of the single-junction device architecture, but also offer many other advantages as discussed subsequently. In this work, we studied a ternary OSC system with a donor polymer (PM6) and two non-fullerene acceptors (namely ITCPTC and MeIC) with similar structures and absorptions. As a result, the optimal blend ratio of PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC (1:0.4:0.6) led to an impressive FF of 78.2% and PCE of 14.13%, which are the highest values reported for ternary OSCs reported to date.
