    , Accepted 24th October 2013First published on 24th October 2013AbstractIn this manuscript, we have proposed a new facile method for the synthesis of pure Cr2O3 nanosheets without foreign templates for the first time. We used Na2CrO4 and graphene oxide as the oxidant and reductant templates, respectively, in a hydrothermal reaction in order to synthesize porous Cr(OH)3 nanosheet precursors. By controlling the proportion of graphene oxide and Cr(VI), the carbon framework could be partially retained, resulting in graphene-divided porous Cr(OH)3 nanosheets. After calcination at 700 °C, these graphene oxide-derived Cr(OH)3 nanosheets were transformed into pure Cr2O3 nanosheets or interconnected graphene–Cr2O3 nanomaterials. The graphene–Cr2O3 nanosheets exhibited an excellent rate capability and cycling performance as an anode material in lithium ion batteries (LIB), as well as a high reversible capacity of 850 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1, which is the highest capacity reported for Cr2O3 anode materials.
Introduction
In the context of the fast depletion of fossil fuels and growing environmental concerns,1–4 it is necessary and challenging to develop a high-performance LIB with a higher power density, higher specific energy and longer cycle stability, which are all largely dependent on the properties of the cathode and anode materials.5,6 Transition metal oxides are widely used as anode materials in LIBs. However, many transition metal oxides suffer from low conductivity and poor cycling performance due to volume variation, pulverization and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the Li uptake–release process of the charge–discharge cycle,7–10 even though the theoretical specific capacities of these materials are more than 600 mA h g−1. Among these transition metal oxides, Cr2O3 is considered to be a promising candidate for negative electrode materials in LIBs due to its high theoretical specific lithium storage capacity (1058 mA h g−1) and relatively low lithium insertion potential among metal oxides (MOx).11,12 The main reaction mechanism is the same as other transition metal oxides: Cr2O3 + 6Li ↔ 2Cr + 3Li2O.13 However, research on Cr2O3 and its practical application have been limited by low capacity and poor cycling performance.14 Several endeavours have been devoted to improving the electronic performance. According to Liu et al.,15 mesoporous Cr2O3 materials replicated from hard templates showed a reversible capacity of more than 500 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.1 C. Jiang et al.16 synthesized hierarchical core–shell structured Cr2O3–carbon composites, which retained a reversible capacity of more than 600 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.2 C.
As a special form of carbon with both a high specific surface area and electrical conductivity, graphene appears to be an ideal adjuvant for Cr2O3 to improve the capacity and cycling stability of the anode.17–20 Herein, we introduce a facile approach for the synthesis of pure Cr2O3 nanosheets from graphene oxide templates for the first time. The synthesis approach comprises two steps, in which flake-like porous Cr(III) hydroxide precursors are first prepared by a hydrothermal redox reaction between graphene oxide and H2CrO4, then the precursors are calcinated to give pure Cr2O3 nanosheets. By controlling the proportion of graphene oxide and H2CrO4, the carbon framework could be partially retained after the hydrothermal redox reaction, resulting in graphene-divided porous Cr(OH)3 precursors. Subsequently, graphene–Cr2O3 composites with different compositions could be obtained by calcinating this precursor. The original idea was adapted from our previous synthesis of MnO2, which used graphene oxide as a sacrificial reductant template.21 Considering the different oxidative abilities of Cr(VI) and Mn(VII), different reaction conditions (hydrothermal) were adopted in order to initiate a redox reaction between graphene oxide and Cr(VI), which resulted in Cr(OH)3 or graphene–Cr(OH)3.
Herein, three reaction processes with different initial mass ratios of graphene oxide and Na2CrO4 were conducted, which were varied as follows: 1:5, 1:3, and 1:1. It is proven, by further analysis, that the hydrothermal reaction between graphene oxide and Na2CrO4 (1:5, pH = 2) resulted in pure porous Cr(OH)3 nanosheet precursors, which are denoted as P-CN, and the corresponding calcinated sample afforded pure Cr2O3 nanosheets, which are denoted as CN. For the other two reaction processes, the resulting composites are denoted as GCN3 and GCN1, according to the initial mass ratio of graphene oxide and Na2CrO4 that was used, and their corresponding precursors are denoted as P-GCN3 and P-GCN1.
Results and discussion
Materials characterization
In the XPS analysis of P-CN and CN (see Fig. 1a), the peaks of Cr 2p1/2 at 587 eV and Cr 2p3/2 at 577 eV, prove that Cr(VI) was successfully reduced to Cr(III) during the hydrothermal reaction and that calcination did not change the valence of Cr.22,23 From the Raman spectra of P-CN (Fig. S5†), the absence of D or G bands indicates that no graphene remains in P-CN. Therefore, P-CN was inferred to be pure Cr(OH)3. As shown in Fig. 1b, the thermogravimetric analysis of P-CN demonstrated a segmented weight loss from 160–700 °C, which was due to dehydration at different levels. In Fig. 1c, the XRD pattern indicates that the final calcinated CN turned out to be rhombohedral Cr2O3 phase (JCPDS card No. 01-1294). In the Raman spectra of the three calcinated samples (Fig. 1d), the peaks located at about 550 cm−1 are due to Cr–O lattice vibrations.24 The absence of D and G bands in the CN sample indicated that no carbon framework remained in CN, while graphene was still retained in GCN1 and GCN3.25,26 From the C 1s peaks of P-GCN3 and GCN3 (Fig. S1†), it was demonstrated that the remaining carbon atoms of P-GCN3 were more oxidized than those of calcinated GCN3, which may be due to thermal reduction via decarboxylation during the calcination.27

As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the as-prepared P-CN was a flake-like porous nanomaterial with an average flake size of several hundreds of nanometers. The pores are thought to be derived from defects in the graphene oxide framework. After calcination at 700 °C under Ar, P-CN was transformed into CN, which had much smaller sized flakes of only tens of nanometers (see Fig. 2c). The HRTEM image in Fig. 2d shows lattice spacings of 0.25 nm and 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (110) and (113) planes of the rhombohedral Cr2O3 phase (JCPDS card No. 01-1294), respectively.

For P-GCN3, shown in Fig. 2e and f, the structures are also porous and hundreds of nanometers in size. In addition, in P-GCN3, the Cr(OH)3 is divided by a graphene framework. However, the calcinated GCN3 structures are not as small and smooth as in CN (see Fig. 2g). Fig. 2h shows that, in GCN3, the Cr2O3 nanocrystals are interconnected with graphene. GCN1 followed a similar trend as GCN3, with no obvious size reduction compared to its hydroxide precursor (see the morphology of GCN1 in Fig. S2a and b†). Additionally, in GCN1, the Cr2O3 nanocrystals are smaller and there are less of them than in GCN3 (see Fig. S2c†). A selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) of GCN3 are shown in Fig. S3.†
In order to investigate the ratio of graphene to Cr2O3 in GCN3 and GCN1, we used TGA under an air atmosphere, where the carbon can be oxidized to CO or CO2. By calculating mass of carbon lost, we can obtain the component ratios in the composites. As shown in the TGA results in Fig. S4,† the weight losses of GCN3 and GCN1 are 11.87% and 33.85%, respectively, indicating that the mass ratios of graphene to Cr2O3 in GCN3 and GCN1 are about 0.135 and 0.512, respectively. For the CN sample, there was no obvious weight loss because there was no graphene, but rather pure Cr2O3 in the sample. In addition, the fact that there was no graphene remaining in the CN sample further proves that no graphene remained in its precursor, P-CN, because graphene cannot be decomposed completely at 700 °C under Ar.
The proposed mechanism of the synthesis process
Considering the different degrees of oxidation of the carbon atoms in the graphene oxide framework, it can be inferred that the redox reaction between H2CrO4 and graphene oxide is triggered at defects in the graphene oxide framework, where the activation energy is comparatively lower than that between the intact sp2-carbon atoms and H2CrO4. In addition, the redox reaction proceeds slowly toward the less oxidized carbon atoms, resulting in the formation of Cr(OH)3 nanocrystals and the release of CO2 or CO32− into the solution. Therefore, the two-dimensional structure is successfully duplicated. When there is enough H2CrO4 to oxidize all of the graphene oxide, there is no carbon framework left and P-CN is obtained, while in the other cases, the less oxidized carbon atoms are left over, resulting in graphene-interconnected Cr(OH)3 frameworks (as shown in the TEM image in Fig. 2f). P-CN is calcinated, changing into the smaller CN (see Fig. 2c) due to dehydration, while calcination of the other composite precursors results in interconnected graphene–Cr2O3 nanosheets, i.e., GCN3 and GCN1 (see Fig. 2h and S2c†). The full processes are illustrated in Fig. 3.

Application as anode materials in lithium ion batteries
Electrochemical tests were conducted using the as-prepared graphene oxide-based Cr2O3 nanomaterials as working electrodes in Li half cells. For the GCN3 and GCN1 samples, the capacities were all normalized according to the total amount of the composite. For the graphene–Cr2O3 composites, the theoretical capacity can be calculated using the following equation: Ctheoretical = CCr2O3 × mass percentage of Cr2O3 + Cgraphene × mass percentage of graphene. The theoretical capacities of graphene and Cr2O3 are 1058 and 744 mA h g−1, respectively, which are calculated using the two reversible electrochemical reactions: Cr2O3 + 6Li ↔ 2Cr + 3Li2O (ref. 13) and C6 + 2 Li ↔ Li2C6.28 According to the mass ratios of graphene to Cr2O3 in GCN3 and GCN1, the theoretical capacities for GCN3 and GCN1 are 1020.7 and 951.7 mA h g−1, respectively. Fig. 4a shows the first discharge–charge curves of CN, GCN3 and GCN1 in the voltage range of 0.005 to 3.0 V (versus Li/Li+) at a current density of 200 mA g−1 and room temperature. Among the three electrode materials, the first discharge capacities of GCN3 and GCN1 are higher than that of CN, which can be attributed to lithium storage via edge sites and internal defects in the remaining graphene framework, according to previous research.29 Due to the special morphology of CN, the first cycle exhibited a higher discharge capacity than that of other reported pure Cr2O3 nanomaterials, but the incomplete conversion reaction and formation of an unstable SEI film cause irreversible lithium loss, thus CN can only deliver a reversible capacity of 250 mA h g−1. For the other two samples, the results are significantly different. Although in the first cycle at a low current density, a coulombic efficiency of only about 50% is achieved, the coulombic efficiency of both GCN3 and GCN1 reaches higher than 85% in the following cycles. Additionally, at a current density of 200 mA g−1, GCN3 and GCN1 show capacities of about 900 and 730 mA h g−1, respectively, and even after 50 cycles their capacities are stable remaining as high as ∼850 and ∼700 mA h g−1, respectively. These are much higher values than other previously reported Cr2O3-based nanomaterials (as shown in Fig. S6a in ESI†), although these capacities are still lower than the calculated theoretical values. At a current density of 400 mA g−1, the reversible capacities of GCN3 and GCN1 are reduced to 770 and 480 mA h g−1, respectively. However, even at higher current densities of 800 mA g−1 and 1.6 A g−1, the reversible capacities for GCN3 still remain at 630 and 500 mA h g−1, respectively. For GCN1, its reversible capacities remain at 400 and 290 mA h g−1, respectively, at current densities of 500 and 1000 mA g−1. In order to understand the effect of the graphene component on the electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out. As shown in the Nyquist plots (Fig. S6b in ESI†), the semicircle diameters of both GCN3 and GCN1 are smaller than that of CN, indicating a smaller combination of the contact resistance, SEI resistance and charge-transfer resistance attributed to graphene. A comparison of the inclined lines at an approximate 45° angle to the real axis, it is obvious that the horizontal intercept decreases from ∼105 (for CN) to ∼70 and ∼63 (for GCN1 and GCN3, respectively), which also proves that graphene can help to improve the lithium ion diffusion process.30,31

Compared with other Cr2O3 based anode materials,13,15,16,32 the outstanding performance can be attributed to the following: firstly, the remaining reduced graphene efficiently improves the electronic conductivity of the electrode, maintaining the internal electronic contact between Cr2O3 and the current collectors. Secondly, the unique interconnected graphene–Cr2O3 two-dimensional structure provides helpful spaces for the electrolyte to diffuse through quickly and accommodates the volume changes of Cr2O3 during lithium uptake and release. Thirdly, as a foreign nano-compound, the Cr2O3 nanocrystals in GCN3 and GCN1 efficiently prevent restacking of the graphene nanosheets, thus the reversible capacity caused by the graphene is also maintained.
Conclusion
In summary, a series of Cr2O3 related nanomaterials based on graphene oxide were synthesized using a redox hydrothermal reaction followed by calcination. By tuning the ratio of the initial reactants, i.e., graphene oxide and Na2CrO4, different-constituent interconnected graphene–Cr2O3 nanomaterials and pure Cr2O3 were obtained. The highest reversible capacity retained by these graphene–Cr2O3 nanomaterials was about 850 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1, and this was more than 700 mA h g−1 at a current density of 400 mA g−1, which is much higher than that of other reported Cr2O3-based electrode materials. Moreover, once again, by using the redox reaction between graphene oxide and high-valence metal anion, the structure of graphene has been duplicated onto a transition metal oxide. In addition, this synthesis approach has greatly developed the applicability of graphene, which is of great benefit to nanomaterial synthesis and applications in various multidisciplinary fields.
