    , Accepted 28th October 2014First published on 3rd November 2014AbstractThe conversion of solar energy with simultaneous electric energy storage provides a promising means for optimizing energy utilization efficiency and reducing device volume. In this paper, a 3-dimensional mesoporous carbon coated branched TiO2 nanowire composite is rationally designed for direct conversion and storage of solar energy as electric double-layer capacitive energy. The 1-dimensional, crystalline TiO2 trunks serve as long light absorption and continuous charge transport pathways, and the high-density TiO2 branches can efficiently increase the contact area with the surface coated mesoporous carbon layers. In addition, the ordered and uniformed mesopores provide large pore sizes for electrolyte penetration, and a high surface area for charge absorption and storage. Under a 1-sun illumination and no external electric bias, this branched TiO2/mesoporous carbon composite exhibits specific capacitances of over 30 and 23.4 F g−1, at current densities of 0.1 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively. An excellent stability of >50 photocharging–electrical discharging cycles has also been demonstrated, suggesting the potential of further developing this hybrid material structure for simultaneous solar conversion and electric energy storage.
Introduction
Electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are important device structures for efficient energy storage,1–10 for which carbon nanostructures, such as carbon nanoparticles,1 nanotubes,2,3 and graphene,4,5 are among the most promising candidates capable of offering high power density and capacitances. Mesoporous carbon materials, synthesized by surfactant-directed organic–organic self-assembly, have also attracted substantial research interest for developing EDLCs recently,6–10 due to their remarkable properties including high specific surface area, tunable pore size, ordered mesostructure, high conductivity and chemical stability.6–11 Nonetheless, all the EDLCs reported so far are charged by external electrical power sources, which limit their potential utilization in portable devices.
On the other hand, solar energy represents a clean, unlimited, and widely available energy source, and has been substantially investigated for developing alternative energy supply, such as solar cells,12–16 photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells and photocatalysis.17–30 Nonetheless, almost all the previous solar energy-based reports are aimed at developing electric cells that provide optimal output voltage and current, while the storage of the electric energy is carried out in a separate cell, resulting in the increase of design complexity, device size as well as loss of electric energy over the external circuit.17–27 Xia et al. reported an integrated PEC-pseudocapacitor device design by depositing a layer of metal hydroxides/oxides on the TiO2 surface,31 while an external electric field is still needed to drive the photogenerated electrons from the TiO2 conduction band for water reduction. Recently, our group demonstrated a fully solar energy-powered PEC conversion for simultaneous solar energy conversion and electric energy storage,32 using Pt nanoparticle-decorated Si nanowires (NWs) as a photocathode and Ni(OH)2 nanoparticle-coated TiO2 NWs as a photoanode. A discharging capacitance of ∼455 F g−1 is obtained for the first discharging cycle, which gradually decreases at subsequent cycles due to the dissolution of Ni(OH)2 over the charging/discharging process. In spite of these research progresses, an integrated photoelectric conversion/EDLC energy storage device, with fully solar energy driven capability and excellent cycling stability, has yet to be realized.
Herein, we have developed a hybrid, 3-dimensional (3D) composite of branched TiO2 NWs coated with mesoporous carbon layers (branched-TiO2/meso-C), for unassisted solar-based PEC conversion and electric capacitive energy storage. As schematically shown in Fig. 1a, the 3D branched TiO2 NW cores not only possess 1D conducting channels for rapid electron–hole separation and charge transport, but also provide long optical paths for efficient light absorption and high surface areas for fast charge transfer rates and electrochemical reactions at interfaces, thus serving as an excellent candidate for the photoanode.23–26 In addition, a mesoporous carbon layer coated over the branched TiO2 NW arrays offers a high surface area (608 m2 g−1) for charge absorption, tunable pore size (∼15 nm) for effective electrolyte transport, and excellent chemical inertness for long cycling life.6–10 Thus, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs are separated on the surface of branched-TiO2 nanowires, where electrons flow to the Pt counter electrode and generate hydrogen, and holes diffuse onto the coated meso-C surface, and the hydroxyl ions in the solution serve as the counter ions (Fig. 1b).33,34 As a proof-of-concept, under a simulated sunlight of 100 mW cm−2 without any additional applied potential, this branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure exhibits an output voltage of 0.125 V, and stable specific capacitances of 30 and 23.4 F g−1 at discharge current densities of 0.2 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively, which is 3 times higher than that of a similar material design while the mesoporous carbon layer is replaced by non-porous carbon. Furthermore, the 3D branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure shows a stable cycling performance in the solar charging/electrical discharging process, thus suggesting a promising bias-free, solar-charged EDLC structure for simultaneous, direct energy conversion and storage.

Experimental
Synthesis of branched-TiO2 nanowires
A two-step synthesis was used for the branched-TiO2 NW growth. In the first step, a modified solvothermal method was used for fabricating one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanowire arrays.13 In brief, the TiO2 seed was coated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by a dip-coating method using 0.3 M tetrabutyl titanate in ethanol as the precursor, and followed by annealing at 500 °C in air for 30 min. The substrate was then placed in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 10 mL of n-butanone, 10 mL of 37% hydrochloric acid, and 1 mL of tetrabutyl titanate, and was kept at 200 °C for 1 h. Then the sample was washed with ethanol, dipped in a mixture of H2O2 (30 wt%) and NH3·H2O (25 wt%) (v/v = 10/1) for 10 min, rinsed with deionized (DI) water and heated at 400 °C in air for 1 h, successively. For the branch growth, the as-obtained NW arrays were placed in a sealed Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave filled with 20 mL of DI water, 0.5 mL of 37% hydrochloric acid and 0.3 mL of TiCl4 solution, and kept at 80 °C for 1 h. Then the sample was washed with DI water and annealed at 400 °C in air for 1 h.
Synthesis of branched-TiO2/mesoporous carbon hybrids
A modified evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) process was used to grow a mesoporous carbon layer on branched-TiO2 NWs.35 In a typical synthesis, 0.3 g of Pluronic F127 (poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide), EO106-PO70-EO106, Mw = 12600, Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC.) was dissolved in 2.16 g of ethanol, and mixed with 3 g of phenolic resol (20% in ethanol, Sigma Aldrich Co. LLC.) by stirring for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution. The mixed solution was spin-coated onto the branched-TiO2 nanowire sample, followed by drying at 40 °C for 24 h and then 100 °C for 24 h, respectively. The final hybrid structure was obtained by pyrolyzing to 600 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 and kept for 3 h at 600 °C in a N2 atmosphere, with a flow rate of 50 cm3 min−1. The branched-TiO2/carbon sample was obtained in an otherwise similar approach, without adding F127 to the precursors.
Photoelectrochemical measurement
All electro-chemical measurements were performed under the three-electrode configuration in 1 M KOH electrolyte with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a Pt foil as the counter electrode in a Metrohm Autolab electrochemical workstation. The charging process was performed under 1-sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination irradiating from the back side (without active materials), without external electric bias. The discharging process was carried out under galvanostatic mode without illumination. The specific capacitance was calculated according to the equation: C = I Δt/(MΔV), where C (F g−1), I (A), Δt (s), M (g), and ΔV (V) represent the discharge current, the discharging time, the mass of active materials (carbon or mesoporous carbon), and the potential difference during discharging, respectively.32
Results and discussion
The 3D branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure is synthesized by a two-step solvothermal–hydrothermal method,13,25 followed by an evaporation induced self-assembly approach (see the Experimental section). After the first solvothermal step, the growth substrate is covered with a layer of needle-like NW arrays, with an average diameter and length of 80 nm and 4.5 μm, respectively (Fig. S1a, b†). After the second hydrothermal step, small branches with an average length of 80 nm and diameter of 10–50 nm are observed growing on the primary NW trunks (Fig. 2a, b). This highly orientated 3D branched-TiO2 nanowire structure is beneficial in charge transportation and suppressing electron–hole combination.23–26 After coating of the mesoporous carbon layer on the branched TiO2 NW arrays by the EISA approach,35 a mesoporous structure is clearly recognized (Fig. 2c, d), which is permeated downward about 3 μm from the top end of the 3D branched-TiO2 (Fig. S1c, d†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure clearly exhibit that the branched TiO2 nanowires are tightly embedded in an ordered mesoporous carbon framework (Fig. 2e). The mesopore size is measured to be ∼10–20 nm. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images reveal well-resolved lattice fringes of both NW trunks and branches (Fig. 2f), with a lattice constant of 0.249 nm matched with the (101) lattice plane of rutile TiO2, indicating excellent crystallinity and the epitaxial growth of the TiO2 branches.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy further confirms that the 3D branched-TiO2 NWs (as well as the 1D TiO2 NWs without branches) have a tetragonal rutile phase crystal structure (JCPDS no. 73-1232), Fig. S2.† Compared to the 1D TiO2 NWs, an increase of the peak intensity of the (101) crystal facet is observed for the 3D branched-TiO2 NW, due to the increase of branches with exposing (101) crystal facet.13 N2 sorption isotherm curves show that the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure has a surface area of 35.8 m2 g−1 (Fig. S3a†), which corresponds to a surface area of 608 m2 g−1 when only the carbon mass is considered, due to the negligible contribution of the surface area from the non-porous branched-TiO2 component. The pore size distribution is calculated to be centered at ∼15 nm, respectively (Fig. S3b†), in good accord with the mesopore size obtained from the TEM results.
To investigate the solar energy-powered electric storage performance of the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure, a three-electrode configuration is adopted (Experimental section). Both the branched TiO2 NWs without carbon coating (designated as branched-TiO2) and with non-porous carbon coating (designated as branched-TiO2/C) are also measured under same conditions for comparison. The output potential of the bare branched-TiO2 NWs increases sharply by 0.39 V under illumination (Fig. 3a), while it increases relatively slowly by 0.125 V for the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure. The decrease of the output voltage can be attributed to the transfer of photogenerated holes from the TiO2 surface to the carbon surface. An even smaller output voltage (∼0.046 V) is observed for the branched-TiO2/C composite, which may be ascribed to the further reduction of absorption in the UV region due to the increase of the carbon layer density around the branched-TiO2 NWs (Fig. S4†). In addition, the output voltages of both the branched-TiO2/C (Fig. 3b) and the branched-TiO2/meso-C structures (Fig. 3c) show an increasing trend with the solar light illumination time, confirming the gradual charge process of the carbon layer through the photoconversion process on the branched-TiO2 NWs. Furthermore, the output voltage of the branched-TiO2/C structure reaches a saturation plateau around 60 s (Fig. 3d). In contrast, although with a relatively slower rate after 90 s of illumination, the output voltage of the branched-TiO2/meso-C structure continues to increase for >300 s, suggesting a more extended charge accumulation process for the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure.

(d) Difference of open circuit potential versus illumination time of 3D branched-TiO2/C (blue curve) and branched-TiO2/meso-C (red curve) hybrid structures. 
Galvanostatic discharge tests were further carried out to quantify the solar charged electric energy of these hybrid structures. For the bare branched-TiO2 NWs, a quick discharging process is observed even under a small current of 10−5 A g−1, indicating a very low capacitance, which only has a negligible variation with different light illumination (photo-charging) times from 5 to 240 s (Fig. 4a). For the branched-TiO2/C structure, under a discharge current of 0.1 A g−1, the discharging time increases to ∼8 s, with the light illumination time (up to 60 s), suggesting that the carbon layer is charged by the photo-generated holes (Fig. 4b). In contrast, for the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure, under a discharge current of 0.1 A g−1, the discharging time continues to increase to ∼40 s, with the light illumination time of 300 s (Fig. 4c). The specific capacitances of these samples are further exhibited with respect to the light illumination (photo-charging) time (Fig. 4d). At a discharge current density of 0.1 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure is around 30 F g−1, which is about 4 times the branched-TiO2/C structure (∼8 F g−1), under different light illumination up to 300 s. Comparatively, the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure charged/discharged under an electrical field without solar irradiation shows a capacitance of ∼54 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. S5†). Thus, the photo-charged capacitance of the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure reaches ∼60% of the electric-charged value. Although this capacitance value is lower than previous reports of electric field-charged mesoporous carbon materials (in the range of 40–200 F g−1),7,8 this branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure does not rely on the external electric power for charging the device, and can serve as an alternative means for unassisted, direct PEC conversion and energy storage.

(f) Specific capacitance stability test of the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structures at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. 
Moreover, the rate performance of the branched-TiO2/meso-C hybrid structure is further measured by varying the discharge current, while keeping the light illumination time as 180 s. The calculated capacitance is 27, 29.5, 30.8 and 23.4 F g−1, for a discharging current density of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 4e), exhibiting the excellent rate performance of the photo-charged branched-TiO2/meso-C EDLC device. Finally, the stability of the branched-TiO2/meso-C EDLC is interrogated by repeated cycles of photo-charging at 100 mA cm−2 and electrical discharging at 0.2 A g−1. A stable specific capacitance of ∼30 F g−1 is observed for over 50 cycles, without noticeable degradation (Fig. 4f), suggesting its excellent stability and superiority as photo-charging supercapacitors.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a 3D branched TiO2/mesoporous carbon hybrid structure for unassisted, direct PEC conversion of solar energy with simultaneous electric energy storage. This hybrid structure takes full advantage of the unique traits of both 3D branched-TiO2 in PEC activity and mesoporous carbon in electric storage, and can be robustly under 1-sun illumination and no external electric bias. A specific capacitance of over 30 F g−1 is obtained at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, which is substantially higher than branched-TiO2 NWs without carbon coating and also ∼3 times higher than that of branched-TiO2 NWs coated with nonporous carbon. The specific capacitance shows good stability under a series of discharging current densities varying from 0.05 to 0.2 A g−1, and can be repeatedly photocharged–electrically discharged for >50 cycles without noticeable degradation. Further design and optimization of the hybrid photoconversion/electric storage materials may open up a host of new opportunities in developing direct and efficient solar energy storage and utilization.
