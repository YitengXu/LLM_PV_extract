    , Accepted 2nd January 2019First published on 2nd January 2019AbstractTwo random conjugated polymers (CPs), PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT, which were derived from 5,10-bis(4,5-didecylthien-2-yl)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT-T) and 4-bromo-7-(4-octylthien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (SBT) or 4-bromo-7-(4-octylthien-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (SFBT), were synthesized and characterized. Optimal photovoltaic devices fabricated from the random polymers and the PC71BM blend films with the configuration ITO/PFN/active layer/MoO3/Ag, provided power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.51% for PDTBDT-SBT and 7.72% for PDTBDT-SFBT, respectively, under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5 G). Following that, comparative investigation of the aggregation, photostability and optoelectronic properties of the random CPs and alternating CPs from DTBDT-T and benzothiadiazole derivatives of BT and FBT with two bilaterally symmetrical 3-octylthiophene spacers (PDTBDT-DTBT and PDTBDT-DTFBT) or without 3-octylthiophene spacers (PDTBDT-BT and PDTBDT-FBT) was performed. It has been found that the band gaps of the BT-based CPs in films were almost unchanged, and that the photostability and d-spacing distances of these first decreased and then increased alongside a gradual increase in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and the π–π stacking interaction, when the number of the 3-octylthiophene spacers in each repeat unit of the CPs were varied from 0 to 1 and then up to 2. Using the same variation of the number of spacers for the FBT-based CPs, the insertion of the 3-octylthiophene spacers presented a similar effect on the photostability and aggregation characteristics of the FBT-based CPs, except the band gaps of the FBT-based CPs were gradually red-shifted, and the HOMO energy levels were first almost unchanged, and then increased remarkably in contrast with the BT-based CPs.
Introduction
In the last few decades, the development of novel donor conjugated polymers (CPs) has been demonstrated to be the most successful approach to achieving high performance polymeric photovoltaic cells (PVCs),1–7 and many promising CPs have been presented. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the PVCs reported to date have been 9–17.3%.8–13 However, the PCEs and the stability of the PVCs still need to be boosted to enable practical applications. In principle, the PCEs of the solar cells are mainly determined by three parameters such as the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). The Voc, Jsc and FF of the PVCs are strongly dependent on the corresponding energy level difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the acceptors and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donors, the light absorption ability and charge transporting characteristics, and the phase separation and so on of the active layers of the devices.14,15 Following these lines, the ideal polymeric photovoltaic electron donor CPs are not only required to have a broad and strong absorption, a high carrier mobility and suitable energy levels, but also must have an appropriate miscibility with the electron acceptor materials.
Among the approaches used to achieve the above characteristics, incorporating an electron-donor (D) moiety and an electron acceptor (A) moiety on the polymer backbone has been demonstrated to be the most efficient and common approach to modulating and optimizing the optoelectronic and aggregation properties of the CPs for PVCs that has been used to date. In addition to this, approaches such as the insertion of π-spacers like thiophene, bithiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene between the donor (D) and acceptor (A) units have also been proven to be significantly promising approaches to altering the optoelectronic properties of polymers and the miscibility of polymers that have fullerene derivatives.16–26 Many fascinating results have indicated that the approach could be a versatile approach to achieving state-of-the-art CPs.27–31 However, the most commonly used approach is incorporating bilaterally symmetrical π-spacers such as thiophene and/or alkylthiophene between the D and A units to modulate and optimize the optoelectronic and aggregation properties of the CPs. To the best of knowledge, random CPs with unsymmetrical π-spacers between the D and A units have seldom been reported, in spite of the fact that some researches have demonstrated that random CPs could present advantages such as promoting the exciton dissociation probability in contrast with alternating CPs.32 Meanwhile, it is worthwhile pointing out that the development of random CPs with one unsymmetrical π-spacer could give researchers the chance to systematically investigate the effect of inserting bilaterally symmetrical and unsymmetrical π-spacers on the aggregation, optoelectronic characteristics and photo-stability of the corresponding CPs.
In this paper, two random CPs, named PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT, were developed, in which 5,10-bis(4,5-didecylthien-2-yl)di-thieno[2,3-d:2,3-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT-T), benzothiadiazole derivatives such as benzothiadiazole (BT) and 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole (FBT), as well as 3-octyl-thiophene were respectively employed as electron rich moieties, electron deficient moieties and π-spacers. The molecular weights, thermal stability, optoelectronic properties and so forth of the random CPs were characterized. The optimal photovoltaic devices fabricated from the random polymers and PC71BM blend films with configuration such as ITO/PFN/active layer/MoO3/Ag provided PCEs of 7.51% and 7.72% under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5 G). Following this, systematic investigation on the influence of the insertion of 3-octylthiophene spacers on the aggregation, photostability and optoelectronic properties of the random CPs and alternating CPs from DTBDT-T and benzothiadiazole derivatives of BT and FBT with two bilaterally symmetrical 3-octylthiophene spacers or without spacers was performed. The results demonstrated that when the number of spacers in each repeat unit of the corresponding CPs was varied from 0 to 1 and then up to 2: (i) the on-set band gaps wavelengths of the CPs with BT as electron deficient units in films were almost unchanged, the HOMO energy levels gradually increased from −5.36 eV to −5.26 eV and then up to −5.18 eV, and the on-set band gap wavelengths of the CPs with FBT as electron deficient units were gradually red-shifted from 698 nm to 717 nm and then to 726 nm, and the HOMO energy levels then increased from −5.54 eV to −5.52 eV and then up to −5.28 eV; (ii) the d-spacing distances of both kinds of CPs with BT or FBT as electron deficient units in the solid state were decreased first and then increased, and the π–π stacking distances successively decreased, except that the variations were very small in the FBT-based CPs; and (iii) the photostability of the CPs was first increased and then decreased, and the random CPs exhibited the best photostability among the CPs tested.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the copolymers

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic routes to the monomers and the random CPs. The SBTBr2 and SFBTBr2 were synthesized as described in the following procedures: the 4,7-dibromobenzothiadiazole (1) or 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole (2) were treated with 2-tributylstannyl-4-octylthiophene with Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 which was used as the catalyst in the anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution at ambient temperature, followed by bromination using N-bromo-succinimide to generate SBTBr2 and/or SFBTBr2, respectively.33 Meanwhile, the 2,7-bis(trimethylstannyl)-5,10-di-(4,5-di-decylthien-2-yl)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]di-thiophene (DTBDT-TSn) was synthesized following the reported procedure.34 The structures of the monomers were confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and elemental analyses before use (Fig. S1–S5†). The random CPs named as PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT were respectively synthesized using DTBDT-TSn and SBTBr2 or SFBTBr2via the palladium-catalysed Stille polymerization,35 the reaction mixtures were poured into methanol, and the precipitated copolymers were collected and extracted using ethanol, acetone, hexane and toluene in a Soxhlet extractor to remove the residual catalyst and oligomers.36 Following that, concentrated solutions of the copolymers in toluene were poured into methanol again, and the precipitated copolymers were collected giving yields of 75–85%. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT, determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in THF, was about 43.6 kDa with a poly disperse index (PDI) of 2.67, and 39.3 kDa with PDI of 3.10, respectively (Table 1). The decomposed temperature (Td, 5% weight-loss) of the PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT was about 422.7 and 423.6 °C under N2 flow, indicating that the copolymers exhibited a good thermal stability (Fig. S6†). Meanwhile, the alternating CPs named PDTBDT-BT, PDTBDT-FBT, PDTBDT-DTBT and PDTBDT-DTFBT, which were correspondingly derived from DTBDT-TSn and BT, FBT, 4,7-di(4-octylthien-2-yl) benzothiadiazole (DTBDT) or 4,7-di(4-octylthien-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole (DTFBT), were also prepared following the procedures described in the references for comparative investigation.37,38 The chemical structures of the alternating CPs are listed in Fig. S7.†

Optoelectronic properties of the copolymers
Firstly, we employed UV-vis absorption spectroscopy to characterize the absorption properties of the PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT in dilute toluene solution and the solid state. The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the copolymers are presented in Fig. 1, and the spectra parameters are collected in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1, both of the copolymers exhibited two distinct absorption peaks in the range of 500–700 nm. The main absorption peaks (0–1) at 628 nm and 598 nm can be attributed to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) between the electron-rich DTBDT unit and the electron-deficient moieties SBT and/or SFBT along the conjugated backbones. Furthermore, the shoulder peaks (0–0) at 665 and 646 nm can be attributed to the intermolecular π–π* transitions owing to the aggregation of the polymer chains in dilute solution.39–42 These correspond to the optical band gaps of 1.68 eV and 1.76 eV, respectively. When moving from the solution to the solid state, the 0–0 peak, the on-set band gap wavelength and the optical band gap (Eopt) for PDTBDT-SBT varied to 665, 742 and 1.67 eV, respectively. The corresponding parameters for the absorption spectra of PDTBDT-SFBT changed to 653 nm and 717 nm, 1.73 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the random CPs and alternating CPs with or without 3-octylthiophene spacers were compared. It was found that the on-set band gap wavelength of the CPs such as PDTBDT-BT, PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-DTBT, in which the BT were used as electron acceptor units, were almost unchanged. The on-set band gap wavelength of the CPs such as PDTBDT-FBT, PDTBDT-SFBT and PDTBDT-DTFBT, in which the FBT were used as electron acceptor units, were first remarkably red-shifted, and then slightly red-shifted, and the number of the 3-octylthiophene spacers in each repeating unit of the CPs varied from 0 to 1 and then up to 237,38 (Fig. S8 and S9†).

Aggregation characteristics of the copolymers in solution and the solid state
For a conjugated polymer in dilute solution, it has been well demonstrated that the molecule motions of the CPs are accelerated, accompanied with an increase in the relative rotation and twisting of the repeat units of the CPs, thus resulting in a decrease in the absorption peaks from the intermolecular π–π* transition, and a blue-shift of the absorption peaks originating from the localized π–π* transitions and ones produced by the ICT transitions.43,44 To investigate the aggregation characteristics of the random CPs in solution, temperature-dependent absorption spectra (TD-Abs) of the random CPs in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution were monitored (Fig. 2). An obvious change in the absorption spectra of PDTBDT-SBT, PDTBDT-SFBT in o-DCB solution was observed during the heating process. From 25 °C to 105 °C, the λ0–0 peaks at 662 nm for PDTBDT-SBT and 645 nm for PDTBDT-SFBT continuously decreased. Then, the λ0–0 peaks are blue-shifted to 658 nm and 634 nm, respectively. The relative intensity of the absorption ratios for the λ0–1/λ0–0 peaks of PDTBDT-SBT and PDBDT-SFBT varied from 0.85:1 to 1.34:1 and 0.93:1 to 1.41:1, respectively. In the same heating process, the λ0–0 peaks of 662 nm for PDTBDT-BT and 639 nm for PDTBDT-FBT were blue-shifted to 646 nm and 633 nm. In addition, the λ0–1 peaks at 620 nm for PDTBDT-BT and 595 nm for PDTBDT-FBT were blue-shifted to 606 nm and 593 nm, the ratios between the λ0–1/λ0–0 peaks varied from 0.72:1 to 0.88:1 for PDTBDT-BT and 0.80:1 to 1.30:1 for PDTBDT-FBT. The λ0–0 peaks at 679 nm for PDTBDT-DTBT and 658 nm for PDTBDT-DTFBT were blue-shifted to 673 nm and 652 nm, the λ0–1 peaks at 636 nm for PDTBDT-DTBT and 611 nm for PDTBDT-DTFBT were blue-shifted to 543 nm and 540 nm, and the ratios between the λ0–1/λ0–0 peaks varied from 0.99:1 to 7.69:1 for PDTBDT-DTBT and 1.04:1 to 2.77:1 for PDTBDT-DTFBT. It was found that the decrease of the λ0–0 peaks and blue-shift of the λ0–1 peaks gradually increased when the number of the 3-octylthiophene spacers in each repeat unit of the CPs varied from 0 to 1 and then up to 2. Furthermore, the insertion of 3-octylthiophene spacers resulted in a decrease of the inter/intra molecular interactions of the CPs in solution16 (Fig. S10†).

To explore the aggregation characteristics of the random CPs in the solid state, the polymer films were cast from CB solution onto a glass substrate and were monitored using X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 3, the π–π stacking peaks of PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT were located at 2θ = 24.56° and 2θ = 24.27°, corresponding to the d-spacing distances of 3.62 and 3.66 Å based on Bragg's law (i.e., λ = 2dsinθ).3 PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT provided the peaks at about 2θ = 3.87° and 2θ = 4.09°, which corresponded to the interlayer d-spacing distances of 22.80 and 21.58 Å, respectively. This indicated that PDTBDT-SBT exhibited a stronger π–π stacking relative to PDTBDT-SFBT in the solid state. For PDTBDT-BT and PDTBDT-FBT, the d-spacing distance associated with the π–π stacking was about 3.81 and 3.75 Å, respectively, and the interlayer d-spacing was about 21.68 and 22.98 Å, respectively. For PDTBDT-DTBT and PDTBDT-DTFBT, the d-spacing distances associated with the π–π stacking were about 3.62 and 3.63 Å, respectively. The interlayer d-spacings were about 24.78 and 24.79 Å. It was found that the π–π stacking distances of the CPs clearly decreased, and the interlayer d-spacing of the CPs, in which DTBDT-T and benzothiadiazole derivatives as electron donor and electron acceptors units slightly increased, when the number of the 3-octylthiophene spacers in each repeating unit of the CPs varied from 0 to 1 and then up to 2 (Fig. S11†).

Electrochemical characteristics of the copolymers
To reveal the influence of the insertion of the 3-octylthiophene and fluorine atoms on the energy levels of the polymers, the electrochemical characteristics of PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in CH3CN with a glass carbon and an Ag/AgNO3 electrode as the working and reference electrodes, respectively. The onset oxidation potential of PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT were observed to be 0.57 and 0.83 V, respectively (Fig. 4). The redox potential of Fc/Fc+ under the above-mentioned conditions is +0.11 V, which is assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV to vacuum for calibration. Then, the LUMO levels calculated using empirical formulas [EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.69) (eV) and ELUMO = −(|EHOMO| − Eg) (eV)]45 were found to be about −5.26 and −3.59 eV for PDTBDT-SBT, and −5.52 and −3.79 eV for PDTBDT-SFBT. For comparison, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for the copolymers such as PDTBDT-BT, PDTBDT-FBT, PDTBDT-DTBT and PDTBDT-DTFBT were also measured under the same conditions. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PDTBDT-BT and PDTBDT-FBT, PDTBDT-DTBT and PDTBDT-DTFBT were found to be about −5.36 and −3.68 eV, −5.54 and −3.82 eV, −5.18 and −3.56 eV, – 5.28 and – 3.57 eV, respectively.37,38 It was found that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the CPs such as PDTBDT-BT, PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-DTBT, in which BT were used as electron acceptor units, were gradually increased (HOMO, from −5.36 to −5.26 eV and then to −5.18 eV; LUMO, from −3.68 to −3.59 eV and then to −3.56 eV). However, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the CPs such as PDTBDT-FBT, PDTBDT-SFBT and PDTBDT-DTFBT, in which FBT were used as the electron acceptor units, were almost unchanged, and then remarkably increased, when the number of the 3-octylthiophene spacers in each repeating unit of the CPs varied from 0 to 1 and then up to 2.

Wettability of the CPs and the copolymers
To investigate the influence of the insertion of 3-octylthiophene spacers on the wettability of the CPs, the water contact angles on the CPs were monitored. As shown in Fig. S12,† the water contact angles for PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBT-SFBT were about 108.36° and 107.21°, respectively. For comparison, the water contact angles on the PDTBDT-BT, PDTBDT-FBT, PDTBDT-DTBT and PDTBDT-DTFBT films were about 103.21°, 104.74°, 109.01° and 109.85°, respectively. These results demonstrated that the insertion of the 3-octylthiophene spacers resulted in a decrease in the surface energy of the CPs, which could lead to the beneficial accumulation of CPs on the top surface (free surface) in the blend films of CPs and PC71BM.46,47
Photo-stability and surface characteristics of the copolymers
Although research conducted on PVCs has so far mainly focused on the development of novel high performance CPs to boost the PCEs of the PVCs, it is inevitable that the photo-stabilities of CPs would need to be addressed owing to their influence on the stabilities of the PVCs.44,48 We inspected the photo-stabilities of random CPs by exposing copolymer films with a thickness around 40–50 nm to AM 1.5 sunlight irradiation in air at ambient temperature (Fig. 5). The absorption spectra of the PDTBDT-BT, PDTBDT-FBT, PDTBDT-DTBT and PDTBDT-DTFBT films were also measured for comparison (Fig. S13†). The maximal absorption peaks around 664 nm for PDTBDT-SBT and 653 nm for PDTBDT-SFBT decreased as the exposure time increased. After 9 h of irradiation, PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT maintained 82.5% and 84.3% of their initial light absorption at the maximal absorption peaks, respectively. The maximal absorption peaks around 663 nm for PDTBDT-BT, 648 nm for PDTBDT-FBT, 685 nm for PDTBDT-DTBT and 660 nm for PDTBDT-DTFBT correspondingly maintained 67.1%, 78.7%, 71.5% and 56.5% of their initial light absorption after 9 h of irradiation. It was found that the random CPs of PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT presented the best photo-stabilities. Furthermore, the results also indicated that the photo-stability of BT and/or the FBT-based CPs first increased and then decreased, when the number of 3-octyl-thiophene spacers in each repeating unit varied from 0 to 1 and then up to 2. Meanwhile, we noticed that the photo-stability of the CPs were related to their d-spacing distances. The shortest d-spacing of PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT were among the BT and/or FBT-based CPs alignments, implying that the strongest aggregation states would be for the PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT, which would lead to the lowest diffusion of oxygen into the CPs films, and thus result in the best photo-stability being exhibited by PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT. However, the specific reasons why PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT presented the best photo-stability need to be further studied.

Hole mobilities of the copolymers
The carrier charge mobility is an important parameter that can affect the charge separation of the excitons, charge carrier transport and recombination in the photovoltaic devices. To investigate the charge carrier transport in the PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT films, the hole mobilities (μh) of the copolymers were measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer/MoO3/Au. The μh of the copolymers were calculated using the SCLC model, which is described in eqn (1).49 (1)
In which J represents the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, μh is the hole mobility, V is the internal potential in the devices and L is the thickness of the active layer. The corresponding J–V characteristics are depicted in Fig. 6. It was noted that the thickness values of the active layer were 98 nm for PDTBDT-SBT and 95 nm for PDTBDT-SFBT. Therefore, the μh of PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT were about 1.14 × 10−4 and 1.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In addition, the alternating CPs such as PDTBDT-BT, PDTBDT-FBT, PDTBDT-DTBT and PDTBDT-DTFBT, in which the number of 3-octylthiophene in each repeating unit of the CPs were 0 and 2, provided hole mobilities of 8.87 × 10−4, 5.62 × 10−4, 1.28 × 10−4 and 2.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively.37,38 This indicated that the hole mobilities of the CPs with DTBDT-T as the electron-donor units and benzothiadiazole derivatives such as BT and FBT as electron-acceptor units were not changed very much when the number of 3-octylthiophene spacers in each unit were varied from 0 to 1 and then up to 2.

Photovoltaic properties of the copolymers
To explore the photovoltaic properties of the two polymers, inverted photovoltaic devices based on the blend film of the copolymers with a configuration of ITO/PFN/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated as inverted PVCs with PFN as a cathode modified layer exhibited an enhanced stability and performance.50,51 At first, the blend weight ratio of the PDTBDT-SBT to PC61BM was varied from 1:1 to 1:1.5 and then to 1:2, and the PCEs of the i-PVCs from PDTBDT-SBT were increased from 1.52% to 2.22% and then dropped to 1.94%. It was found that the optimum weight ratios of the PDTBDT-SBT andPC61BM were about 1:1.5 (Table 2, Fig. S14†). Following that, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as a solvent additive owing to the potential modification of the morphology of polymers and the fullerene derivatives blend films for PVCs.52 The PCEs of the i-PVCs from PDTBDT-SBT/PC61BM with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 were enhanced from 2.22% to 5.10%, with a Jsc of 10.16 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.70 V and FF of 71.72%. Meanwhile, the PCEs of the i-PVCs of PDTBDT-SFBT/PC61BM with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 were about 5.03% with a Jsc of 10.17 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.77 V and FF of 64.56% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 irradiation, when 3% DIO (VDIO/VCB) was used as a solvent additive. Furthermore, PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor material owing to the stronger absorption of PC71BM in the visible region relative to that of PC61BM.53 The PCEs of the i-PVCs from PDTBDT-SBT/PC71BM were enhanced from 5.10% to 7.51% with a Jsc of 15.38 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.71 V and FF of 68.82%. The PCEs of the i-PVCs from PDTBDT-SFBT/PC71BM were enhanced from 5.01% to 7.72% with a Jsc of 14.63 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.78 V and FF of 67.68%. The incident photo-to-current efficiencies (IPCE) of the i-PVCs from the copolymers/PC71BM in the range of 400–500 nm were clearly increased when PC61BM was replaced by PC71BM (Fig. 7b). The expected enhancement of the PCEs and the Jsc of the i-PVCs from PDTBDT-SBT/PC71BM and PDTBDT-SFBT/PC71BM could be attributed to the stronger absorption of PC71BM relative to that of PC61BM. Unsurprisingly, the Voc of i-PVCs from PDTBDT-SBT was higher than that for the i-PVCs from PDTBDT-DTBT, and lower than that for the i-PVCs from PDTBDT-BT.

To confirm the effect of the employment of a 3% DIO solution additive on the surface topographies and phase separation of the copolymers and PC61BM blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to investigated the characteristics of the random PC61BM. The AFM topography and TEM images of the blend films are presented in Fig. 8 and Fig. S15.† As shown in Fig. 8, the root-mean-square (rms) of the blend films from PDTBDT-SBT/PC61BM were decreased from 3.33 to 1.47 nm, and the rms of the blend films of PDTBDT-SFBT/PC61BM were decreased from 5.07 to 1.08 nm, when 3% DIO was used as a solvent additive. Meanwhile, the TEM investigations of the blend films with or without 3% DIO as a solvent additive indicated that the domains of the copolymers (bright region) and PC61BM (dark region) in the films and the uniformity of the films were almost unchanged when 3% DIO was used as a solvent additive (Fig. S15†). The results revealed that the employment of a DIO solvent additive could modify the smoothness of the blend films, and the phase separation of the copolymers and PC61BM in the blend films was almost unchanged.54

Conclusions
Two random CPs derived from DTBDT-T and SBT or SFBT were synthesized and characterized. Optimal photovoltaic devices were fabricated from the random polymers and PC71BM blend films with a configuration of ITO/PFN/active layer/MoO3/Ag, and provided PCEs of 7.51% and 7.72%, respectively, under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5 G). Furthermore, systematic investigation of the influence of the insertion of alkylthiophene spacers on the aggregation, photostability and optoelectronic properties of the random CPs and alternating CPs from DTBDT-T and benzothiadiazole derivatives without or with two bilaterally symmetrical 3-octylthiophene spacers as π-spacers in each repeating unit was performed. The results indicated that the band gaps of the BT-based CPs in films were almost unchanged, the photo-stability and d-spacing distances of these first decreased and then increased along with a gradual increase in the HOMO energy levels and the π–π stacking interactions, when the number of 3-octylthiophene spacers in each repeating unit of the CPs was varied from 0 to 1 and then up to 2. A similar effect was observed for the photostability and aggregation characteristics of the FBT-based CPs, except that the band gaps of the FBT-based CPs were gradually red-shifted, and the HOMO energy levels were almost unchanged at first, and then remarkably increased in contrast with the BT-based CPs. It should be noted here that the random PDTBDT-SBT and PDTBDT-SFBT exhibited the best photo-stability among the corresponding CPs alignments investigated.
Experimental section
Materials
All reagents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Aldrich, Acros and TCI Chemical Co., and were used as received. The THF was dried using sodium with benzophenone as an indicator under a nitrogen flow. 2,7-Di(trimethylstannyl)-5,10-bis(4,5-didecylthien-2-yl)di-thieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT-TSn),34 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,37 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole37 were synthesized according to a previously reported procedure, and characterized using 1H NMR before use.
General method

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 400 or DRX 500 spectrometer operating at 400 and 126 MHz was referred to tetramethylsilane (TMS). Analytical GPC was performed using a Waters GPC 2410 in THF relative to polystyrene standards. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TGA 2050 (TA instruments) thermal analyses system under a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured on a UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co.). CV analysis was measured on CHI 600D electrochemical workstations (Shanghai Chenhua Co.) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with a nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile (CH3CN) with a glass carbon and Ag/AgNO3 electrode as the working and reference electrodes, respectively. The copolymers in the solid state were investigated using the following process, the copolymers thin films on glass substrates with a thickness of 30 nm were first irradiated by a solar simulator (Air mass 1.5 global, XEC-300M2, San-EI Electric Co.) with an irradiation of 100 mW cm−2, then the absorption spectra of the irradiated thin films were monitored on the UV-2500 spectrophotometer. The photo-degradation of the copolymers were carried out using the following approach: the dilute CB solution of copolymers was put into a silica glass tube, degassed and kept under argon, then irradiated with UV-radiation ex situ for varying amounts of time with a Jinaopu UV lamp (UV-1800 Spectro photometer Shimadzu Co.). The vial was placed within 15 cm of the UV lamp, and circumrotated for 400 cycles per minute, ensuring that the entire solution volume was uniformly irradiated. After that, the UV absorption spectra of the copolymers in solution were monitored. The XRD was carried out on a PAN alytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54 Å).
Preparation and characterization of the photovoltaic solar cells
A patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass with a sheet resistance of 10–15 Ω per square was cleaned using a surfactant scrub, followed by a wet-cleaning process inside an ultrasonic bath, beginning with deionized water, followed by acetone and iso-propanol (iPrOH). After oxygen plasma cleaning for 5 min, 30 nm thick PFN layers were spin-casted onto the ITO. The active layers with a thickness ranging from 100–110 nm were then deposited on the top of the PFN modified ITO by spin-casting from the o-dichlorobenzene solution containing PDTBDT-SBT/PC61BM, PDTBDT-SFBT/PC61BM, PDTBDT-SBT/PC71BM and PDTBDT-SFBT/PC71BM, with and without DIO as a solvent additive. Then, an 8 nm MoO3 and 100 nm silver layer were evaporated with a shadow mask under a vacuum of (1–5) × 10−5 Pa. The overlapping area between the cathode and anode defined the pixel size of device as 0.16 cm2. The thickness of the active layers was determined by a Profile system (BRUKER VDS-9400 QS). The thickness of the evaporated cathode was monitored using a quartz crystal thickness/ratio monitor (SI-TM206, Shenyang Sciens Co.). All of the fabrication processes were carried out inside a controlled atmosphere in a nitrogen dry box (Etelux Co.) containing less than 1 ppm oxygen and moisture. The PCEs of the resulting polymer solar cells were measured under 1 sun, AM 1.5 G (Air mass 1.5 global) conditions using a solar simulator (XEC-300M2, San-EI Electric Co.) with an irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit. The spectral responses of the devices were measured with a commercial EQE/incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) setup (7-SCSpecIII, Beijing 7-star Opt. In. Co.).
