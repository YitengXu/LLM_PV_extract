    , Accepted 23rd August 2020First published on 25th August 2020AbstractA new series of PM6-based terpolymers (PM10Si, PM20Si, and PM30Si) containing 10%, 20% and 30% DTBT (4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) with siloxane-terminated side chains were designed and synthesized. These terpolymers were used as donor materials with the acceptor Y6 to fabricate polymer solar cells (PSCs), where both the routine blend casting method and the two-step sequential deposition (SD) method were applied to investigate the photovoltaic properties of these terpolymers. The inverted device based on PM20Si with 20% siloxane-terminated side chains on the DTBT unit exhibited better power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14.30% due to having a more suitable phase state and more prominent face-on orientations. With further optimization by the SD method, the device based on PM20Si obtained an excellent efficiency of 15.17% with a short-current density (Jsc) of 26.92 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 70.44%, which could be put down to its more balanced charge mobility (μh/μe = 1.10). This work demonstrates that controlling the content of DTBT with siloxane-terminated side chains in the terpolymers can supply a positive driving force for phase separation and molecular packing of the active layer, which provides a novel way to improve the photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn extensive research interest as one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies owing to their superior qualities of light weight, low cost, rapid energy payback, morphological stability and flexible roll-to-roll processing.1–5 In recent years, great efforts have been devoted to non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) material design, and morphology optimization, giving rise to an intensive boost in PCEs.6–8 At present, PCEs of over 18% have been achieved for single-junction PSCs.9 Meanwhile, it should be recognized that the advancement in donor materials is equally important because the characteristics of donor materials are related to the PCEs of PSC devices.
Based on a donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer system, side chain and terpolymerization strategies have been discovered to efficiently enhance the performance of PCEs.10–13 On the one hand, side chain adjustment is an effective strategy to optimize the structure of a copolymer donor. So far, alkyl-, alkoxyl-, alkylthio-, and carboxylate side chains have been separately applied in side chain engineering.14–16 Specifically, siloxane-terminated side chains in place of alkyl chains utilized in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have achieved encouraging success, attributed to reinforcing the face-on orientation.17–19 Inspired by these reports, many efforts have been made to develop new polymer donors with siloxane-terminated side chains to fine-tune the solubility, molecular packing and film morphology. For example, a DFBT-BDT based polymer donor PBZ-2Si with siloxane-terminated side chains exhibited a PCE of 11.14% in an NFA system.20 Recently, a PTB7-Th based polymer donor PTBSi25 with 25% siloxane-terminated side chains displayed a PCE of 12.61% when paired with a narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptor IEICO-4F. Compared with PTB7-Th with a 2-ethylhexyl group, the polymers with siloxane-terminated side chains performed with increased hole mobility along with enhanced face-on stacking orientation.21 On the other hand, BT-based terpolymers often exhibit high PCEs, ascribed to high charge mobilities caused by the high crystallinity of BT.22–24 In 2017, Chen et al.25 investigated the impact of replacing an alkyl side chain with a siloxane-terminated side chain on DTBT, and they found that a limited content of siloxane-terminated side chains could induce fast hole transport, relatively smaller phase separation and pronounced face-on orientation. Their study indicated that the introduction of DTBT with siloxane-terminated side chains can simultaneously enhance the orientation and carrier transport for these polymer donors, which is beneficial to the photovoltaic performance.
Since then, Hou et al.26 synthesized the structure of PM6, which caught the attention of researchers because of its appropriate energy levels and strong crystallinity, and they obtained some record PCEs for PSCs. On this basis, Li et al.27 utilized the synergistic effect of fluorination on both donor (PM6) and acceptor (IT-4F) materials for PSCs with 13.5% efficiency. Then, Zou et al. made great efforts with “Y-series” NFAs, typically Y6, which realized record PCEs of over 15% with PM6 as the donor.28–30 For matching with more NFAs, different electron-withdrawing units were incorporated into PM6 via copolymerization strategies to downshift the molecular energy and broaden the absorption. These terpolymers frequently expressed high PCE owing to their simultaneously enhanced Voc and Jsc.31,32
In this work, we have designed and synthesized a new series of PM6-based terpolymers (PM10Si, PM20Si, and PM30Si) containing different contents of DTBT with siloxane-terminated side chains. An increased hole mobility and more balanced hole and electron transports are obtained by introducing DTBT with siloxane-terminated side chains into the copolymer PM6.28 And all the blended films of terpolymers exhibited obvious face-on orientations, while the PM20Si/Y6 blended film delivered more ordered molecular packing than PM10Si- or PM30Si-based films, which is favorable for crystallinity and charge transport. As a result, PM20Si/Y6 blended film showed a higher PCE of 14.30% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 24.05 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69.96%. While the PM10Si- and PM30Si-based devices exhibited PCEs of 12.40% and 13.11%, respectively. Moreover, the PM20Si-based photovoltaic devices handled with the SD method showed a PCE of up to 15.17%. Compared with BHJ devices, SD devices can not only independently control and optimize donor and acceptor layers, but also reduce bimolecular recombination because the dissociation of charge carriers at the D–A interface is confined to each phase.33–35
Experimental section
Materials and synthesis
All reagents and solvents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from commercial sources. (4,8-Bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (BDTT-F, M1), 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4,8-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD, M2), and tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) [Pd(PPh3)4] were purchased from Suna Tech Inc. and Alfa Aesar. 4,7-Bis(5-bromo-4-(5-(1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxan-3-yl) pentyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBT2T-C5Si, M3) was synthesized according to reported procedures.25

Polymerization for PM10Si. 
In a 10 mL flask, a mixture of M1 (94.2 mg, 0.10 mmol), M2 (68.8 mg, 0.09 mmol), M3 (10.7 mg, 0.01 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (6.0 mg) was dissolved in toluene (6 mL). The flask was flushed with argon. Then the flask was frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed four times. The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at 110 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was slowly dripped into methanol (50 mL). The crude polymer was collected by filtration and then further purified through column chromatography, eluting with hot chloroform (CF). The polymer was extracted from the chloroform solution by precipitation in methanol and dried under vacuum. The polymer was obtained as a blue-black solid (yield 85%). GPC: Mn = 91 kDa, PDI = 2.2. Anal. calcd (%): C, 65.61; H, 6.45; N, 0.22; S, 19.97. Found (%): C, 65.13; H, 5.54; N, 0.19; S, 19.35.


Polymerization for PM20Si. 
A mixture of M1 (94.2 mg, 0.1 mmol), M2 (61.1 mg, 0.08 mmol), M3 (21.4 mg, 0.02 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (6.0 mg) in toluene was used to synthesize PM20Si according to the procedure described above. The polymer was obtained as a blue-black solid (yield 70%). GPC: Mn = 90 kDa, PDI = 3.2. Anal. calcd (%): C, 64.62; H, 6.49; N, 0.43; S, 19.25. Found (%): C, 64.05; H, 6.36; N, 0.37; S, 18.71.

The polymer was obtained as a blue-black solid (yield 74%). GPC: Mn = 91 kDa, PDI = 2.9. Anal. calcd (%): C, 63.48; H, 6.54; N, 0.63; S, 18.57. Found (%): C, 63.59; H, 6.61; N, 0.53; S, 18.19.

Measurement and characterization
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed to provide the average molecular weight and the polydispersity (PDI) by using CF as eluent at room temperature. The UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy measurements were obtained on a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on an electrochemistry workstation by using a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, a Pt slice as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, and the internal calibration of the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode potential was performed using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the redox dipole. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were recorded on a Digital Instruments Enviro Scope in a tapping mode.
PSC device fabrication and measurement
Inverted PSC devices (ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al) were applied to investigate the photovoltaic performance of the terpolymers. The patterned ITO glass substrates were washed with organic solvent before treated by UV-ozone cleaning for 15 min. They were spin-coated with ZnO precursor solution and annealed at 220 °C for 30 min. The blended CF solution (13.2 mg mL−1) with the addition of 0.5% CN was spin-coated on the ZnO layer to acquire an active layer, and the active layer was treated with thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. Ultimately, the MoO3 layer and Al electrode were sequentially evaporated onto the surface of the active layers under a vacuum pressure of 2 × 10−4 Pa. SD PSC devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al.33 PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated on the ITO glass substrates. The chlorobenzene (CB) solution (12 mg mL−1) of terpolymer and CF solution (10 mg mL−1) of Y6 with 1% DIO were spin-coated in sequence. Afterwards, the active layer was subjected to thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min, and PFNDI-Br dissolved in methanol solution (0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the active layer. Eventually, Al was thermally evaporated. The J–V plots were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter with an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator coupled with 1.5 G solar spectrum filters as the light source.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route for the terpolymers of PM10Si, PM20Si and PM30Si is shown in Scheme 1. All of them were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction of the monomers M1, M2 and M3. They have a good solubility in various organic solvents: CF, CB, and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB), etc. The average molecular weights of PM10Si, PM20Si and PM30Si are 91 kDa, 90 kDa and 91 kDa with PDI of 2.2, 3.2 and 2.9, respectively.

Thermal property
The thermal stability of the terpolymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As can be seen in Fig. 1, the TGA curves show that the decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of PM10Si, PM20Si and PM30Si are 413, 431 and 436 °C, respectively. This result indicates that all of the terpolymers exhibited great thermal stability, which is crucial for their applications in PSCs.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
UV-Vis absorption spectra of dilute CF solutions (10 mg L−1) and thin film at room temperature of the terpolymers are shown in Fig. 2a and b. As shown in Fig. 2a, all terpolymers exhibited two absorption bands ranging from 300 to 700 nm in dilute solution. PM10Si, PM20Si and PM30Si had maximum absorption peaks at 601, 611 and 607 nm, respectively. The maximum molar absorption coefficients were 3.95 × 104, 3.91 × 104 and 4.20 × 104 (g ml−1)−1 cm−1 for PM10Si, PM20Si and PM30Si, respectively. These results suggest that the content of DTBT with siloxane-terminated side chains on the terpolymers has little effect on their absorption properties. The film absorption spectra (Fig. 2b) of the terpolymers are nearly identical to dilute solution spectra, indicating that the terpolymer chains in solution at room temperature present weak interchain self-aggregation. From the absorption edges of these terpolymer films, the corresponding optical band gaps (Eoptg) were calculated as 1.82 eV for PM10Si, 1.81 eV for PM20Si and 1.79 eV for PM30Si, suggesting that all the terpolymers are wideband gap copolymer donors.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in order to evaluate the electrochemical properties of these terpolymers. The CV plots are shown in Fig. 3b and the detailed data are summarized in Table 1. From the obtained onset potentials of oxidation/reduction, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the terpolymers were then deduced as −5.57/−3.10 eV for PM10Si, −5.49/−3.07 eV for PM20Si, and −5.49/−3.08 eV for PM30Si. The deep HOMO energy levels are helpful to obtain a high VOC. By comparing the HOMO/LUMO levels of the donors and the acceptor (Y6), there is enough driving force to dissociate the exciton. It can be seen from Table 1 that Eecg was slightly larger than Eoptg due to the exciton binding energy of the organic conjugated materials.36

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of these terpolymers as donors blended with the acceptor Y6, PSC devices with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/polymers:Y6/MoO3/Al were fabricated. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices under optimal conditions are shown in Fig. 4a and detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The PM10Si-based device exhibited an upper Voc of 0.88 V and a Jsc of 22.51 mA cm−2, while the relatively low FF of 62.59% severely limited the performance of the device, leading to an inferior PCE of 12.39%. Fortunately, both the Jsc and FF were significantly improved by increasing the content of the third constituent (M3) in the terpolymer. The devices based on PM20Si obtained a better PCE of 14.30% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 24.05 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69.96%. Whereas, with the content of M3 further increased to 30%, the PCE was reduced to 13.11% due to the simultaneous reduction of Jsc and FF. External quantum efficiency (EQE) responses of these devices are interpreted in Fig. 4b. The integral current densities calculated from the EQE curves were 21.81, 23.18 and 21.95 mA cm−2 for the PM10Si:Y6, PM20Si:Y6 and PM30Si:Y6 based devices, respectively, which were approximately the same as the values from J–V measurements.

We also fabricated devices with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al by the SD method. The J–V and EQE curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 5a and b, and the corresponding data are displayed in Table 2. All of the terpolymers exhibited increasing Jsc and FF, but decreasing Voc. As a result, PM20Si-based devices achieved the champion PCE of 15.17%. These results further demonstrated that the combination of a terpolymerization strategy and an SD method could efficiently enhance the photovoltaic performance.
 Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves and (b) EQE curves of SD devices based on terpolymers and Y6. 
For a further understanding of the charge carrier mobility of the blended films, the hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, using the structures ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al, respectively. The relevant curves are elucidated in Fig. 6. The PM10Si-based blended film exhibited low μh/μe values of 2.37 × 10−4/1.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. With a 20% content of siloxane-terminated side chain, the PM20Si-based blended film showed a slightly increased μh/μe of 5.18 × 10−4/4.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. When the content of the third constituent (M3) was further increased to 30%, the μh/μe values decreased to 3.09 × 10−4/2.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The ratios of μh/μe were determined to be 1.34, 1.27 and 1.31 for PM10Si-, PM20Si- and PM30Si-based blends, respectively. The higher and more balanced mobilities of PM20Si-based blended film were responsible for the highest Jsc and FF values of the PSC devices. As shown in Fig. 7, we also measured the hole and electron mobilities by the SD method, and the μh/μe of the PM10Si- and PM20Si-based devices increased to 5.00 × 10−4/3.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.80 × 10−4/5.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while the film based on PM30Si showed a depressed μh/μe of 3.43 × 10−4/2.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. These results indicate that such a method could improve charge transport to achieve an outstanding photovoltaic performance.

Film morphology
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out to investigate the relationship between the PSC performance and the microstructures of the terpolymers:Y6 (1:1, w/w) blended films. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the PM10Si-, PM20Si- and PM30Si-based blended films showed root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 2.18, 1.03 and 2.70 nm, respectively. Compared with the PM10Si:Y6 and PM30Si:Y6 blended films, the blended film based on PM20Si:Y6 exhibited moderate microphase separation, which was beneficial to exciton dissociation and charge transport. In the TEM images of PM20Si, no large aggregates were observed (Fig. 9), indicating the good miscibility of PM20Si and Y6, which is coincident with the obviously reduced RMS and the highest μe values. High contents (30%) of the siloxane-terminated side chains possibly broke the continuity of the acceptor phases, resulting in a large domain size in the blended film, which is consistent with the decreased charge carrier mobility. Therefore, the appropriate morphological characteristics of the PM20Si:Y6 blended film will contribute to the relatively high Jsc, FF, and PCE achieved by the PSC devices.

To further analyze the effect of the content of DTBT with siloxane-terminated side chains on molecular orientation and packing in blended films, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed (Fig. 10). All blended films exhibited prominent face-on orientations, as evidenced by the obvious (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and (100) diffraction peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction, which are beneficial to vertical charge transport. According to the (010) peaks at qz = 1.75 Å−1 for all of the terpolymers, the corresponding π–π stacking distances were evaluated as 3.59 Å, and the (100) peaks were at qxy = 0.30, 0.28 and 0.28 Å−1 for PM10Si:Y6, PM20Si:Y6 and PM30Si:Y6, respectively. The lamellar packing distances were calculated as 20.94, 22.44 and 22.44 Å. After decomposition by two peak Gaussian fitting (Fig. 11), the (010) peak in the OOP direction was divided into two scattering peaks at qz = 1.51–1.53 and 1.74 Å−1 for all of the terpolymers:Y6 blended films. And the integrated area ratio (as shown in Table 3) for two different π–π stacking peaks was calculated to be 47:53, 40:60 and 47:53 for PM10Si:Y6, PM20Si:Y6 and PM30Si:Y6, respectively. The tight packing region (qz = 1.74 Å−1) of the PM20Si-based blended film was larger, which could account for the higher charge mobility of PM20Si:Y6 measured by SCLC.

Conclusion
In summary, a new series of PM6-based terpolymers containing different ratios of DTBT with siloxane-terminated side chains were designed and synthesized. Adjusting the content of DTBT with the siloxane-terminated side chains had no significant effect on the absorption and energy levels of the resulting terpolymer. However, the blended film of PM20Si:Y6 revealed a more suitable phase state, preferable molecular orientation and more balanced hole and electron transport, compared with the PM10Si- or PM30Si-based films. As a consequence, the inverted devices based on PM10Si, PM20Si and PM30Si displayed PCEs of 12.39%, 14.30% and 13.11%, respectively. With further optimization by the SD method, the device based on PM20Si obtained an excellent efficiency of 15.17% with Jsc of 26.92 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.44%. This work demonstrates that controlling the content of DTBT with siloxane-terminated side chains in a terpolymer can supply a positive driving force for phase separation and molecular packing of the active layer, which provides a novel way to improve photovoltaic performance.
