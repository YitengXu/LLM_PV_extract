    , Accepted 3rd May 2018First published on 3rd May 2018AbstractRenewable energy-driven hydrogen production from electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting has been widely recognized as a promising approach to utilize green energy resources and hence reduces our dependence on legacy fossil fuels as well as alleviates net carbon dioxide emissions. The realization of large-scale water splitting, however, is mainly impeded by its slow kinetics, particularly because of its sluggish anodic half reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whose product O2 is ironically not of high value. In fact, the co-production of H2 and O2 in conventional water electrolysis may result in the formation of explosive H2/O2 gas mixtures due to gas crossover and reactive oxygen species (ROS); both pose safety concerns and shorten the lifetimes of water splitting cells. With these considerations in mind, replacing the OER with thermodynamically more favorable organic oxidation reactions is much more preferred, which will not only substantially reduce the voltage input for H2 evolution from water and avoid the generation of H2/O2 gas mixtures and ROS, but also possibly lead to the co-production of value-added organic products on the anode. Indeed, such an innovative strategy for H2 production integrated with valuable organic oxidation has attracted increasing attention in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. This feature article showcases the most recent examples along this endeavor. As exemplified in the main text, the oxidative transformation of a variety of organic substrates, including alcohols, ammonia, urea, hydrazine, and biomass-derived intermediate chemicals, can be integrated with energy-efficient H2 evolution. We specifically highlight the importance of oxidative biomass valorization coupled with H2 production, as biomass is the only green carbon source whose scale is comparable to fossil fuels. Finally, the remaining challenges and future opportunities are also discussed.

1. Introduction
The continuous economic development and increasing global population necessitate the steady growth of energy production. As the current energy sector is highly dependent on fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, their limited reserves pose a risk for our long-term development.1–3 In addition, the adverse effect of fossil fuel utilization has been well manifested by its detrimental impact on the environment, climate, and health of our planet. Consequently, intense research efforts have been focused on the capture, conversion, storage, and utilization of sustainable and clean energy resources, like solar light and wind.4,5 It has been estimated that the energy of solar irradiation on the Earth's surface for 80 min is sufficient to meet the global energy demands for an entire year based on the current consumption rate.2 To address the intermittency issue of renewable energies like solar irradiation, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 generation from water have been considered as attractive approaches for renewable energy storage in the form of chemical bonds.6–8 In this case, the produced H2 can be stored and later used on demand via hydrogen fuel cells. Additionally, H2 is also a commodity chemical in the chemical industry.
As shown in Fig. 1a, conventional water electrolysis is usually conducted in strongly acidic electrolytes with noble metal-based catalysts (e.g., Pt for the HER, and IrO2 or RuO2 for the OER) and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) or in alkaline media using transition metal-based catalysts (e.g., Ni for the HER and stainless steel for the OER) and diaphragms.9,10 In both cases, the H2 and O2 evolution reactions (HER and OER) are strictly coupled, which may lead to the formation of explosive H2/O2 mixtures due to gas crossover.11–13 Gas crossover not only poses safety concerns but also reduces the energy conversion efficiency as the crossed O2 will be reduced back to water (acidic media) or hydroxide anions (alkaline media) on the cathode side.9 In addition, the coexistence of H2/O2 gas mixtures and electrocatalysts may result in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can degrade the membrane and thus shorten the lifetimes of electrolyzers.11 Another well-known limitation is that the four-electron/four-proton nature of the OER requires a much higher overpotential input than that of the HER to afford the same current density, while the product O2 is not very valuable. In fact, the voltage input for practical water splitting electrolyzers is always substantially larger than the standard thermodynamic potential of 1.23 V.

An alternative strategy for H2 production from water is to replace the challenging but less valuable OER with thermodynamically favourable and economically more attractive organic oxidation reactions. Such a novel strategy will not only lower the voltage input and exclude the formation of H2/O2 gas mixtures and ROS, but also produce more valuable organic products on the anode, maximizing the return of energy investment (Fig. 1b).
This Feature Article aims to present an overview of recent progress in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 generation integrated with various organic oxidation reactions. A diverse array of organic substrates could be employed in this new strategy, ranging from alcohols,14–18 ammonia,19–21 urea,22–25 and hydrazine26–28 to biomass-derived intermediate compounds29–34 and others.35–37
2. Electrocatalytic HER integrated with organic oxidation
Even though the thermodynamic potential of water splitting is only 1.23 V under standard conditions, a cell voltage of 1.6–2.0 V is typically required to achieve a current density larger than 10 mA cm−2 in practical electrolyzers. Consequently, appreciable production of H2 can only be achieved with an electrical energy consumption exceeding 45 kW h kg−1 H2. Because of the much lower standard thermodynamic potentials of alcohol oxidation reactions than that of the OER, Vizza et al. demonstrated that it was feasible to replace the OER with alcohol oxidation to produce H2 with a voltage less than 1 V, using palladium nanoparticles deposited on three-dimensional titania nanotube arrays (Pd/TNTA-web) as the anode electrocatalysts (Fig. 2a and b).14 For the preparation of Pd/TNTA-web, a commercial titanium non-woven sintered web support was anodized and annealed to form finely distributed titania nanotube arrays (TNTAs), as confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 2c). Subsequently, a dipping–chemical reduction procedure was employed to deposit Pd nanoparticles. The SEM image in Fig. 2d clearly confirms the homogeneous Pd distribution on the inner surfaces of the TNTAs. The TNTAs had an inner diameter of 100 nm with a wall thickness of 10 nm, and the Pd nanoparticles had an average particle size of ∼13 nm (Fig. 2e). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) characterization also revealed the crystalline lattices of both anatase and metallic Pd (Fig. 2f), further confirming the successful formation of Pd/TNTA-web. A two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer was assembled using Pd/TNTA-web as the anode and Pt/C on carbon cloth as the cathode in 2 M NaOH (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2g shows the typical polarization curves obtained at 25, 50, and 80 °C with 2 M ethanol. It is apparent that the output current density at a cell potential of 0.9 V at 80 °C (1.95 A cm−2) is more than three times higher than that at 25 °C (0.51 A cm−2), mainly due to the enhanced kinetics of ethanol oxidation with temperature increase. Similar results were obtained for other alcohols including ethylene glycol (Fig. 2h), glycerol (Fig. 2i) and 1,2-propanediol (Fig. 2j). It was calculated that the use of ethanol for H2 production (18.5 kW h kg−1 H2) results in an electrical energy saving of 26.5 kW h kg−1 H2. Moreover, these alcohols can be produced from the fermentation of biomass or steam reforming of cellulosic materials with reasonably low energy cost,14 and the corresponding products of organic acids are more valuable than O2.34b However, the utilization of Pd and Pt-based electrocatalysts inevitably leads to a high cost of the electrolyzer.

With this consideration in mind, we reasoned that it is economically more appealing to explore first-row transition metal-based electrocatalysts. Our group recently reported a 3D hierarchically porous nickel electrocatalyst (hp-Ni) for such an integrated water electrolysis.33 The hp-Ni electrocatalyst was prepared by a facile template-free cathodic electrodeposition of highly porous Ni microspheres on a nickel foam at 3.0 A cm−2 for 500 s. The SEM images in Fig. 3a indicated the 3D hierarchically macroporous nature of hp-Ni with a pore size of several hundred micrometers and abundant smaller macropores on the interconnected walls. Such a hierarchically porous structure is believed to facilitate the accessibility of catalytically active sites and mass transport for improved electrocatalytic performance.38Fig. 3b plots the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the oxidation of ethanol and water on hp-Ni in 1.0 M KOH. Upon addition of 10 mM ethanol, the catalytic onset potential shifted from 1.51 V to 1.35 V vs. RHE and a substantial anodic current density was observed within 1. 4 V vs. RHE, indicative of ethanol oxidation being easier than the OER. In order to demonstrate the versatility of hp-Ni, we further extended the organic substrate group to benzyl alcohol (BA). A similar cathodic shift of the LSV curve was observed once BA was added to the electrolyte (Fig. 3c). Long-term electrolysis was conducted at 1.423 V vs. RHE, where no water oxidation would occur. The concentration evolutions of BA and its oxidation products were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and are plotted in Fig. 3d, clearly indicating an increase of benzoic acid but a decrease of BA over passed charge. As an initial endeavour to explore the electronic effect on alcohol oxidation catalyzed by hp-Ni, two derivatives of benzyl alcohol with electron-withdrawing (4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, NBA) and -donating (4-methylbenzyl alcohol, MBA) substituents at the para position were subjected to similar electrocatalytic oxidation on hp-Ni. Interestingly, both LSV curves of these two new substrates took off at quite similar potentials in comparison to that of the parent benzyl alcohol (Fig. 3e), suggesting that the catalytic onset potentials of these alcohol oxidation reactions are primarily determined by the potential to achieve the desirable oxidation state of hp-Ni, rather than the intrinsic thermodynamics of alcohol oxidation. Such an integrated electrolyzer required a voltage of 1.58 V to afford 50 mA cm−2, nearly 220 mV smaller than that of pure water splitting and other nonprecious electrocatalyst-based water electrolysis at the same current density.1c Post-electrolysis characterization of hp-Ni after stability tests (named post-BA hp-Ni) demonstrated its partial oxidation on the catalyst surface. For example, the high-resolution Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectrum for post-BA hp-Ni showed a decreased peak at 852.6 eV, which could be ascribed to metallic Ni, and an increased peak at 856.0 eV, attributed to oxidized Ni species (Fig. 3f). Therefore, the real catalytically active sites for alcohol oxidation are most likely high-valent nickel species.39

In addition to alcohols,14–18 ammonia19–21 and urea22–25 were also explored for the integration with the HER. For instance, Qiao's group recently reported that small-sized MnO2 ultrathin nanocrystals could act as efficient electrocatalysts for urea oxidation with excellent performance. The catalytic current densities achieved by their MnO2 electrocatalysts were even greater than that of Pt/C. The same group also explored the oxidation of urea catalyzed by a two-dimensional Ni-based metal organic framework (MOF), which led to a potential reduction of 280 mV compared to that of Pt/C to achieve 10 mA cm−2.23
The aforementioned electrocatalysis integrates H2 production with different organic oxidation reactions, resulting in a potential saving of 200–300 mV relative to that of overall water splitting. However, a cell voltage of approximately 1.3 V is still needed to reach a meaningful current density like 10 mA cm−2. It is highly desirable to explore other organic substrates to further reduce the voltage input for H2 generation. Along this line, Sun and co-workers chose hydrazine oxidation as the counter reaction to couple the HER using the Ni2P electrocatalyst coated on nickel foam (Ni2P/NF).26 The standard thermodynamic potential of hydrazine oxidation to N2 is only −0.33 V.26 As depicted in Fig. 4a, Ni2P/NF featured interconnected nanosheet arrays with an open network-like nanostructure. The LSV curves of Ni2P/NF with increasing hydrazine in 1.0 M KOH are compiled in Fig. 4b. In the absence of hydrazine, no oxidation current was observed within the potential window of −0.1 to 0.1 V vs. RHE. In contrast, the addition of 0.1 M hydrazine introduced a sharp current increase and increasing the hydrazine concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 M resulted in a rapid increase in oxidation current density, indicative of hydrazine oxidation catalyzed by Ni2P/NF. As Ni2P has been reported with high activity towards the HER, Ni2P/NF could function as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for H2 production coupled with hydrazine oxidation. Consequently, an electrolyzer using Ni2P/NF as both an anode and a cathode was then constructed. The Ni2P/NF couple showed superior performance with a cell voltage of 1.0 V to afford 500 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH containing 0.5 M hydrazine (Fig. 4c). In the absence of hydrazine, a cell voltage of 1.6 V was required to reach 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4d). A 10 h chronopotentiometry experiment revealed a relatively constant cell voltage requirement (0.45 V) to deliver 100 mA cm−2 on Ni2P/NF (Fig. 4e) together with nearly unity Faradaic efficiency (Fig. 4f). Collectively, these results demonstrate that replacing the OER with hydrazine oxidation represents an effective way for efficient H2 production with a low voltage input.

Although the required voltage for such integrated electrolysis is dramatically reduced relative to that of conventional water electrolysis, the added organic substrates are consumed and transformed to low-value or even harmful by-products. For instance, urea oxidation produces N2 and CO222 and the oxidation of hydrazine converts the high-energy hydrazine fuel to N2.40 Another problem that should not be overlooked is that these gaseous products may mix with the H2 gas. Therefore, it is even more appealing to explore other organic oxidation reactions which can not only replace the OER but also generate value-added and nongaseous products at the anode.
It is well-known that oxidative biomass upgrading holds a crucial role in converting biomass-derived feedstocks to many value-added chemicals.29–34,41 Those oxygenated compounds can serve as primary building blocks to produce diverse commodities, polymers, and pharmaceuticals. Among many biomass-derived intermediates, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) has been considered as one of the top biomass-derived platform chemicals. For example, one of its oxidation products, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA, Fig. 5a), is an important monomer to produce polyamides, polyesters, and polyurethanes, being a replacement of terephthalic acid.29,42 Traditional approaches of biomass oxidation often involve stoichiometric chemical oxidants, high temperature, and/or expensive catalysts. However, due to the increasing environmental regulations and economic concerns, efforts have been devoted towards developing “green” catalytic processes, wherein catalysts only consist of earth-abundant elements while still exhibiting high activity and robust stability under ambient conditions. In this regard, electrocatalytic oxidation offers an attractive strategy as it is only driven by electricity under ambient conditions and no chemical oxidants are necessary.

We recently reported 3D Ni2P nanoparticle arrays on Ni foam (Ni2P NPA/NF) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to couple H2 production with HMF oxidation in alkaline media.29 As revealed by the XRD and SEM measurements, 3D Ni2P NPA/NF was successfully obtained (Fig. 5b and c). Similar to reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts for the OER and alcohol oxidation,33,43 an electrochemical activation phenomenon was also observed for Ni2P NPA/NF during HMF oxidation; hence all the LSV curves in Fig. 5d were collected after the cessation of activation. In the presence of HMF, Ni2P NPA/NF exhibited an onset potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE followed by a rapid current density increase within 1.40 V vs. RHE. On the other hand, without HMF, the catalytic onset potential was shifted to 1.5 V vs. RHE and no appreciable current could be observed within 1.40 V vs. RHE, indicative of more favourable HMF oxidation than the OER on Ni2P NPA/NF (Fig. 5d). A chronoamperometry experiment was then carried out at 1.423 V vs. RHE and the concentration evolutions of HMF and its oxidation products were monitored via HPLC measurements (Fig. 5e). Assuming a 100% Faradaic efficiency for the six-electron process of HMF oxidation to FDCA, 59 C was required to consume all the starting HMF. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5e, after passing the theoretically calculated amount of charge, HMF nearly disappeared and the concentration of FDCA reached the maximum, confirming a nearly unity Faradaic efficiency for both HMF conversion and FDCA production. Even if an anion-exchange membrane was adopted, there still exists a possibility that HMF might migrate to the cathode chamber and hence interfere with the HER on the cathode. Therefore, an ideal HER electrocatalyst should show great selectivity towards H2 production in the presence of HMF. As an extreme case shown in Fig. 5f, the LSV curves of the HER on Ni2P NPA/NF in the presence and absence of 10 mM HMF nearly overlapped, indicative of the negligible influence of HMF on H2 generation catalyzed by Ni2P NPA/NF.
After establishing the favourable HMF oxidation over the OER and high selectivity of the HER on Ni2P NPA/NF in the same electrolyte (1.0 M KOH with 10 mM HMF) with the three-electrode configuration, we next assembled a two-electrode electrolyzer for the integrated HER and HMF oxidation using Ni2P NPA/NF as both an anode and a cathode. After introducing 10 mM HMF into the electrolyte (1.0 M KOH), the onset cell voltage was dramatically reduced (Fig. 5g). Fig. 5h presents that nearly 200 mV voltage input was saved to reach benchmark current densities like 10, 20, and 50 mA cm−2, highlighting the much better energy conversion efficiency of the integrated HER and HMF oxidation relative to water splitting alone. Gas chromatography measurements further confirmed a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for H2 production (Fig. 5i) and no O2 was detected during the electrolysis at 1.50 V. Quantifying the resulting electrolyte by HPLC also resulted in a high Faradaic efficiency of ∼97% for FDCA production. Such excellent Faradaic efficiencies for both the HER and FDCA generation could be maintained for at least three consecutive electrolysis cycles employing the same Ni2P NPA/NF electrocatalyst couple (Fig. 5j). Collectively, these combined results undoubtedly proved the success of our proposed integrated electrolysis producing two valuable products (H2 and FDCA) with a lower energy input.
Encouraged by the above results, we further explored the electrocatalytic upgrading of various biomass-derived compounds like furfural and furfuryl alcohol on other nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts.30 The high overpotential requirement of the OER actually grants us a large potential window to perform various organic oxidation reactions catalyzed by low-cost electrocatalysts. For instance, Ni3S2 could be adopted as a model electrocatalyst, which was prepared by straightforward sulfurization of commercially available nickel foams (Ni3S2/NF). Low-magnification SEM images of Ni3S2/NF indicated an interconnected macroporous 3D framework (Fig. 6a), similar to that of pristine Ni foam. Different from the featureless morphology of Ni foam, highly-magnified SEM images of Ni3S2/NF revealed an interesting structure composed of stacked nanoparticles (Fig. 6b and c). A close inspection of these nanoparticles in a high-resolution SEM image revealed the presence of abundant mesopores on the surface of Ni3S2/NF (Fig. 6b). Such a unique hierarchically porous nanostructure was expected to boost the accessibility of catalytically active sites and facilitate mass transport, beneficial to electrocatalytic performance.38 Elemental mapping analysis of Ni3S2/NF confirmed the uniform distribution of Ni and S (Fig. 6d–f), validating the chemical conversion of Ni into Ni3S2. Five representative organic oxidation reactions were catalyzed by Ni3S2/NF in parallel. As compiled in Fig. 6g–k, all the LSV curves in the presence of organic substrates universally took off at much lower potentials compared to those in the absence of organics, consistent with their more favourable oxidation relative to water oxidation. Interestingly, all the catalytic currents of organic oxidation rose at very similar potentials (∼1.36 V vs. RHE), regardless of which the organic substrate was oxidized. This phenomenon evokes a reminiscence of the oxidation of various benzyl alcohol derivatives catalyzed by hp-Ni (Fig. 3e). A two-electrode electrolyzer employing Ni3S2/NF as both the cathode and anode required a much lower voltage input for H2 production coupled with HMF oxidation to achieve benchmark current densities (10, 20, 50, and 100 mA cm−2) relative to pure water splitting electrolysis using the same electrode couple (Fig. 6l). For example, in order to produce a current density of 100 mA cm−2, a voltage of 1.64 V was needed for the integrated electrolysis; while for overall water splitting electrolysis, 1.84 V was required to arrive at the same current density. Although the low-magnified SEM image (Fig. 6m) of post-HMF Ni3S2/NF indicated the maintenance of the overall 3D hierarchically porous configuration and primary Ni3S2 phase, high-magnification SEM images (Fig. 6n and o) revealed the presence of featureless monoliths, different from the pristine sample (Fig. 6b and c). The elemental mapping images in Fig. 6p indicate that the post-HMF oxidation Ni3S2/NF mainly consisted of Ni and S, plus a large concentration of O2 over the newly formed monoliths, indicating the oxidation of Ni3S2 during electrolysis. In addition to these aforementioned examples, many other electrocatalytic systems have been explored for the coupled H2 evolution and organic oxidation, which are summarized in Table 1.

3. Photocatalytic HER integrated with organic oxidation
Besides electrocatalytic H2 production from water with electricity as the energy input, photocatalysis provides another more direct approach to convert and store solar energy in chemical bonds.44–46 In fact, light-driven water splitting for H2 evolution has attracted much research interest during the last few decades. Since the discovery of photoelectrochemical water splitting on TiO2 in 1972,47 extensive studies have been conducted for photo-driven H2 evolution on semiconductors.48 Generally, three steps are involved in semiconductor-based photocatalysis: (i) light absorption and photogeneration of electron–hole pairs, (ii) migration of photogenerated electron–hole pairs to the respective sites, and (iii) charge utilization for H2 production and another oxidation reaction. An ideal semiconductor should meet at least two criteria: a suitable band gap for efficient light absorption and appropriate band positions for sufficient reducing and oxidizing power.
In order to minimize the recombination of excited electrons and holes upon light irradiation, sacrificial electron donors are usually employed in photocatalytic systems for H2 production. However, such a conventional strategy not only increases the overall cost of H2 production, but also wastes the oxidizing power of excited holes. Analogous to the scenario successfully demonstrated for the integrated HER and organic oxidation in the aforementioned electrocatalytic systems, it is quite appealing to seek alternative organic oxidation reactions to consume the photogenerated holes on semiconductors while simultaneously producing value-added organic products. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of such an integrated photocatalysis strategy for the HER and organic reforming on several semiconductor systems, including carbon nitride and cadmium chalcogenides. Among various organic oxidation reactions, the photo-driven oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes shows great promise to be coupled with H2 generation.49–51
3.1 Carbon nitride-based photocatalysts
Carbon nitride (CNx) has emerged as a great semiconductor in recent years because of its visible light absorption and well-positioned valence and conduction bands for many important redox reactions, including water splitting.52 For instance, Sun et al. reported a hybrid photocatalyst system, utilizing C3N4 as the semiconductor, and a ruthenium complex and platinum as the oxidation and reduction catalysts, respectively, for the photo-induced benzyl alcohol oxidation and H2 evolution.53 The presence of the molecular ruthenium catalyst remarkably improved the selectivity of benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzylaldehyde primarily due to the formation of Ru(IV)O active species. Similarly, Yang and his co-workers synthesized fibrous Ag nanoparticles decorated on g-C3N4 aerogel.54 This photocatalytic system exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution in the presence of methanol, which was oxidized to formaldehyde. Nevertheless, the utilization of expensive metals (Pt, Ru, and Ag) in these photocatalytic systems inevitably results in high cost for large-scale applications. It is more desirable to explore non-precious alternatives.
In 2016, Reisner et al. reported a hybrid photocatalytic system consisting of carbon nitride decorated with cyanamide on the surface and a molecular nickel(II) bis(diphosphine) catalyst to integrate light-driven H2 evolution and benzylic alcohol oxidation (Fig. 7).55 Under optimized conditions, such a hybrid system showed a high activity towards the HER and aldehyde production with a rate of 763 μmol g−1 h−1 and a quantum efficiency of 15%. A turnover frequency of 76 h−1 was calculated based on the amount of nickel and the conversion of 4-methylbenzyl alcohol reached 83.0%. Transient absorption spectroscopy studies demonstrated that the presence of cyanamide groups on the surface of carbon nitride was critical in that these groups would suppress the recombination of excited electrons and holes, leading to a higher production yield. Unfortunately, this hybrid system had a relatively short operational lifetime, most likely due to the poor stability of the nickel catalyst under photocatalysis conditions.

3.2 Cadmium chalcogenide-based photocatalysts
Another popular semiconductor candidate for photocatalysis applications is CdS whose conduction band lies at −0.5 V vs. NHE and valence band at +1.9 V vs. NHE.56–60 Feldmann's group reported an interesting CdS-based photocatalytic system utilizing a low-cost nickel co-catalyst for H2 production integrated with alcohol oxidation.58 A unique redox shuttle mechanism was proposed. Under light irradiation, hydroxyl anions diffuse to the surfaces of the CdS nanorods and are oxidized to hydroxyl radicals by excited holes. The in situ formed hydroxyl radicals later oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde (Fig. 8a). Nickel nanoparticles were expected to catalyze H2 evolution. The size and quantity of nickel nanoparticles on CdS could be conveniently controlled by photodeposition (Fig. 8b and c). The authors also investigated the pH influence on H2 production. As shown in Fig. 8d, the amount of evolved H2 was substantially larger at higher pH, probably due to fast alcohol oxidation with increasing alkalinity. The apparent quantum yield for H2 production was measured as high as 49% over the first 20 h under irradiation with a light wavelength of 447 nm. Longer photolysis resulted in a lower quantum yield (∼20%). Overall, such a hybrid photocatalytic system exhibited great stability, showing decent activity up to at least 220 h (Fig. 8e).

In order to increase the specific surface area and maximize the utilization of excited electrons and holes for photocatalysis applications, an ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet is a preferred morphology for semiconductors.61,62 Last year, our group developed a microwave synthesis to prepare ultrathin 2D CdS nanosheets. With the assistance of the nickel co-catalyst, our Ni/CdS photocatalyst was able to drive H2 evolution and organic upgrading under visible light irradiation.63 After microwave treatment, the wurtzite crystal structure of CdS was obtained and no crystalline peaks due to nickel could be observed for Ni/CdS (Fig. 9a). The ultrathin thickness of Ni/CdS was measured at ∼1.1 nm based on the atomic force microscopy (AFM) results in Fig. 9b. In contrast to previous studies where benzyl alcohol or ethanol was chosen as the organic substrate, our group was more interested in exploring the photocatalytic upgrading of biomass-derived intermediate compounds coupled with H2 evolution. In particular, we sought to conduct photo-induced valorization of furfural alcohol and HMF to furfural and 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) in neutral water, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9c, under visible light irradiation, our 2D Ni/CdS nanosheets exhibited excellent performance for H2 evolution when furfural alcohol was used as the organic substrate. In the meantime, furfural alcohol was converted to furfural with a nearly 100% yield within 22 h of irradiation (Fig. 9d). Surprisingly, when HMF was adopted as the organic substrate, a much lower H2 production rate was observed and it was not able to completely oxidize HMF to DFF after 22 h of photolysis (yield ∼22%), even though a similar oxidation from an alcohol group to an aldehyde group took place in both cases. The remarkable difference was further investigated via theoretical computations (Fig. 9e). It was rationalized that the binding affinity of the aldehyde group in HMF towards nickel oxide was slightly stronger than its alcohol group; therefore, the aldehyde group more likely adsorbed on Ni/CdS, while the alcohol group was kept away from the oxidizing sites, resulting in a slower oxidation of HMF to DFF. However, under alkaline conditions, both furfural alcohol and HMF were oxidized to their corresponding carboxylates with yields over 90%.

Given the great abundance of biomass as a sustainable and renewable carbon source, it remains a hot topic in exploring the direct conversion of biomass materials to value-added products, not only focusing on those biomass-derived small molecular intermediates but also cracking the stubborn polymeric components. As lignocellulose is one of the most prevalent biomass materials, increasing research efforts have been centered on its upgrading and utilization via green methods. Complex polymeric structures are involved in all three main components of lignocellulose including cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin (Fig. 10a). Conventional biomass reforming processes usually require high temperature and expensive chemicals, which may result in carbon-based gaseous products like CO, CO2, and CH4. In contrast, visible light-driven reformation of lignocellulose to produce H2 represents an alternative green approach. Last year, Reisner's group reported an interesting strategy for photo-induced H2 production using lignocellulose and even raw biomass materials (Fig. 10b) as the hole scavengers to boost H2 evolution, in which CdS quantum dots were utilized as the semiconductors.60 Because of the quantum confinement effect, high specific surface area, and tunable band gap based on size, quantum dots have enormous potential for photocatalysis.64 In order to overcome the photo-corrosion of CdS quantum dots and simultaneously increase the solubility of biomass substrates, a highly alkaline electrolyte was applied, which was able to promote the formation of a cadmium oxide (CdOx) layer on the surface of CdS (Fig. 10c). It was found that the solution pH had a dramatic impact on H2 evolution. As shown in Fig. 10d, increasing the alkalinity resulted in higher H2 production and the best activity was achieved in 10.0 M KOH when α-cellulose was used as the hole scavenger. Control experiments conducted in the absence of cellulose clearly proved the critical role played by cellulose in boosting the H2 yield, in that the addition of cellulose to the reaction solution dramatically enhanced the H2 production rate by several magnitudes (Fig. 10e). In addition to α-cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were also found to increase the H2 production rate, albeit the performance of lignin was much lower than those of the former two substrates (Fig. 10f). The authors further tested several crude biomass materials, such as printer paper, cardboard, newspaper, wooden branches, grass, and sawdust (Fig. 10g), among which the wooden branches demonstrated the best activity with a H2 production rate over 5 mmol gcat−1 h−1, which was even higher than those obtained from α-cellulose, ∼2.3 mmol gcat−1 h−1 (Fig. 10f). This seminal report highlighted the great promise of directly utilizing raw biomass materials to drive H2 production with visible light irradiation under ambient conditions. Future efforts should focus on producing valuable chemicals from the oxidation of those raw biomass materials, rather than merely acting as hole scavengers for the HER.

In addition to the aforementioned photocatalytic systems based on CNx, and CdS, other robust semiconductors like CdSe,65 Au–Pd/ZrO2,66 Ru/SrTiO3:Rh,67 and MgO68 have also been applied in H2 photogeneration coupled with organic oxidation reactions. For instance, Wu's group applied 3-mercaptopropionic-capped CdSe quantum dots to accomplish alcohol oxidation integrated with H2 generation.65 A cascade catalytic cycle involving the generation of thiol radicals was proposed for their photocatalytic system. The in situ generated thiol radicals might be utilized for other complex organic reactions. A list of representative photocatalytic systems for the coupled H2 evolution and organic oxidation is included in Table 2.

4. Conclusions
In this Feature Article, we have summarized the recent progress in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting integrated with organic oxidation for efficient H2 generation and organic transformation. Such a new catalysis strategy is complementary to conventional focus on catalyst design in minimizing the overpotential requirements for both the HER and OER in pure water splitting. Instead, it suggests that thermodynamically more favourable organic oxidation reactions be adopted to replace the OER, as they have several intrinsic advantages, such as eliminating the formation of explosive H2/O2 mixtures and reactive oxygen species (ROS), improving the efficiency of H2 production and potential co-production of value-added organic products. Even though such a novel direction in electro- and photocatalysis is still in an early stage, quite a few organic substrates have been explored, including alcohols, ammonia, urea, hydrazine, biomass-derived platform chemicals and even raw biomass materials.
In the electrocatalysis field, earth-abundant materials like first-row transition metals have found promising applications as electrocatalysts for both the HER and the accompanying organic oxidation reactions. However, the overpotential requirements for those organic oxidation reactions are still quite high. Given the much lower thermodynamic potentials of those organics relative to that of the OER, much smaller oxidation potentials should be realized to drive their oxidation. In addition, electrocatalytic selectivity towards the most desirable products should be further improved. In some cases, the poison issue of electrocatalysts by organic substrates could be severe. It is thus a long-term challenge to explore highly efficient, robust, and selective electrocatalysts with low-cost for this coupling electrocatalysis strategy. In order to achieve sufficient conductivity, an electrolyte (i.e., KOH) with high concentration is typically required. Therefore, the separation and purification of the obtained organic products from aqueous electrolytes at low cost should also be considered.
In the photocatalysis field, it is exciting to see raw biomass materials that could be directly utilized as hole scavengers for photo-induced H2 production. Nevertheless, the scope of explored semiconductors is still limited and most of them do not absorb a large portion of the solar spectrum. Considering the lower oxidizing power requirement of many organic reactions relative to that of water oxidation, it is anticipated that a much larger pool of semiconductors can be considered as candidates for this coupling photocatalysis strategy in the future. Currently, only relatively simple organic oxidation reactions (i.e., alcohol oxidation) have been integrated with H2 evolution in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In order to enlarge the versatility and demonstrate the real potential of this coupling catalysis approach, it is highly desirable to explore more challenging yet useful organic reactions, such as oxidative C–C coupling. One could even envisage coupling both organic reactions to complete the redox cycle of electro- and photocatalysis. In addition, developing efficient and robust membranes to separate the organics should also be taken into account. Overall, with the development of competent catalysts and semiconductors, more exciting results in this burgeoning field of integrating reduction and oxidation reactions in both electrolyzers and photo-reactors can be certainly expected.
