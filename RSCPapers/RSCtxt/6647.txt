    , Accepted 18th October 2019First published on 18th October 2019AbstractThe most critical aspect for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is the choice of suitable photoelectrode materials. The low efficiency of PEC water splitting photoanodes restricts their widespread deployment for large scale H2 production. Herein, WO3 with controlled structures was in situ hydrothermally grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates via simply using different orientation agents, i.e., citric acid for the sandwich structure and tartaric acid for nanoplates. By determining the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), the sandwich structure is proven to be able to provide more active sites and a larger specific reaction surface area for PEC water splitting. In the citric acid derived WO3 sandwich structure, upon increasing the hydrothermal reaction time from 4 to 16 h, the dominating exposed facets were converted from the (200) crystal plane to the (002) crystal plane, while WO3 prepared from tartaric acid consistently yielded the (200) crystal plane. Moreover, the sandwich structured WO3 photoanode with intensively exposed (002) facets obtained hydrothermally in 12 h exhibited a photocurrent density of 3.16 mA cm−2 in aqueous Na2SO4 solution under AM 1.5 G illumination and an incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) value of 79% at 400 nm at 1.23 V vs. RHE. To the best of our knowledge, this value is one of the most remarkable for pristine WO3 photoanodes. The excellent PEC performances of the resulting sample could be attributed to the 2-D nanoplates with superior crystallinity and exposed highly reactive (002) facets which facilitated the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) production from water splitting plays an important role in addressing energy sustainability and environmental emissions.1–3 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting offers a strategy to realize clean and renewable energy through the conversion of water to H2via solar energy.4 Compared with the water reduction reaction to produce H2, the oxygen evolution reaction is kinetically sluggish since it is an uphill reaction that involves a four-electron transfer process, which becomes the control step for water splitting.5–7 Therefore, it is crucial to develop efficient, suitable and cost-effective photoanodes for water oxidation to realize PEC applications. An ideal PEC water splitting photoelectrode requires characteristics such as suitable band-gap energy (1.9–3.2 eV) and band position, efficient charge carrier separation and transportation, strong catalytic activity and stability, etc.
Among the numerous reported photoanode materials including α-Fe2O3,8 BiVO4,9 WO3,10 TiO2,11 ZnO,12 TaON,13 Ta3N5,14 and Ag3PO4,15 WO3 has been considered to be one of the most attractive visible-light-responsive photoanode materials for PEC water splitting due to its narrower bandgap (Eg = 2.4–2.8 eV) compared with TiO2 and ZnO,16 appropriate valence band (VB) location (approximately 3.0 V vs. NHE) that provides a sufficient potential for water oxidation, moderate hole diffusion length (∼150 nm) compared with α-Fe2O3 (2–4 nm), better electron mobility (∼12 cm2 V−1 s−1) than TiO2 (∼0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1),17 and excellent stability in acidic solutions. Nevertheless, WO3 is an indirect semiconductor and requires a relatively thick film for adequate light absorption while excessive thickness of the film usually causes significant recombination of electrons and holes. Furthermore, photogenerated holes exhibit a sluggish kinetics which restricts the efficiency of PEC water splitting. In addition, the formation of peroxo-species during water splitting will reduce the stability of WO3 and further deteriorate the PEC performance.
To improve the PEC performance of WO3 photoanodes, tremendous efforts have been made to overcome the abovementioned issues including doping,18,19 synthesizing orderly nanostructured morphologies and manipulation of facets,20–23 coupling with narrow-band semiconductors,24,25 or decorating with co-catalysts.26,27 However, the cocatalyst layer inevitably blocks the incident light and potentially reduces light harvesting, thus resulting in reduced photocatalytic activity. It is more attractive to design pure WO3 with high PEC performance. Nano-structuring the photoelectrode materials has direct benefits for both the photoactivity and electrocatalytic activities. Compared with nanorods, nanowires or nanoparticles, WO3 nanoplates exhibit better PEC performances thanks to their direct electrical pathways for photogenerated carriers which could decrease the hole diffusion length to enhance charge separation.22,28,29 Moreover, ordered nanoplates in situ grown on substrates with preferential exposure of active facets can be significantly beneficial for the PEC performance. Compared with the (200) facet (1.43 J m−2) and the (020) facet (1.54 J m−2), the (002) facet of WO3 possesses the highest surface energy (1.56 J m−2),20,21 which is more favorable for adsorbing reaction species to decrease the surface energy. In the past few years, ordered WO3 nanoplatelets were prepared in the presence of strong corrosive acids such as HCl20,21,31–35 or hazardous chemicals,30,34 which is definitively not an environmentally friendly approach. Therefore, an economical, efficient and green methodology for obtaining WO3 nanoplates with highly exposed active facets is highly desirable to enhance the PEC performance.
Herein, a WO3 film with highly exposed (002) facets was in situ grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates via a facile and green hydrothermal method without using strong acids and/or hazardous chemicals (Scheme S1, ESI†). By tuning the organic acid capping agent, sandwich and nanoplate structures have been successfully obtained. Furthermore, the sandwich structured WO3 prepared after hydrothermal treatment for 4 h mainly exposed (200) facets and then converted to mainly exposed (002) facets when 16 h reaction time was applied. This is the first report showing that the reaction duration of the hydrothermal process influenced the exposed facet of WO3 in the presence of citric acid. The organic acid with different numbers of carboxylic acid groups per molecule played an important role in the morphology and crystallographic orientation of WO3. Particularly, the sandwich structure obtained after hydrothermal treatment for 12 h showed enriched (002) facets and achieved an optimal film thickness for PEC applications. The synergistic effects of the exposed highly reactive (002) facet and the sandwich structure with superior crystallinity of the 2-D nanoplates effectively facilitated the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and suppressed the formation of peroxo-species. The photoanodes achieved a decent photocurrent density of 3.16 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and an incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) value of 79% at 400 nm. To the best of our knowledge, these values are one of the highest photocurrent densities for bare WO3 films.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Sample preparation
The WO3 nanoplates array film grown on FTO coated glass was synthesized using a seed-mediated hydrothermal method. Before preparing the WO3 film, the purchased commercial FTO coated glasses were first washed under ultrasonication with acetone, isopropanol, ethanol, and deionized water for 30 min, sequentially. The detailed procedures are as follows:

(i) Preparation of WO3 seeds on FTO substrates. 
Briefly, 0.919 g tungsten powder was put into a 50 mL beaker, followed by adding 5 mL H2O2 (30%). A few minutes later, the grey powders dissolved with a lot of bubbles. The dissolution process is exothermic, resulting in a colorless and clear solution of tungsten peroxide.36 After adding 0.5 g poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), the mixed solution was diluted to 30 mL by adding deionized water with strong agitation for 30 min. The WO3 seeds on FTO substrates were prepared by spin coating of the solution. After being annealed at 500 °C for 2 h in air at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, the FTO substrates with WO3 seeds were then used for the subsequent hydrothermal reaction.


(ii) Preparation of the precursor for the hydrothermal reaction. 
0.13 g tungsten powder was dissolved in 3 mL H2O2 (30%), resulting in many bubbles, and a colorless and clear solution was obtained. Then the transparent solution was diluted to 60 mL by adding deionized water under strong magnetic stirring for 30 min.


(iii) Preparation of the WO3 nanoplate array film. 
Two types of WO3 nanoplates with different preferential orientations were prepared via a hydrothermal method. For to obtain WO3 in the presence of citric acid (named CA-WO3), 0.39 g citric acid was added to 30 mL of the as-prepared precursor under strong stirring. The mixed solution was then transferred into a 50 mL autoclave. A piece of the as-prepared FTO glass with WO3 seeds was dipped into this solution with the FTO side facing down. The sealed autoclave was put into an oven for hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for a certain time. For comparison, WO3 nanoplates in the presence of tartaric acid (named TA-WO3) were prepared by adding 0.23 g tartaric acid to 30 mL of the as-prepared precursor and kept at 180 °C for a certain time. After being cooled down to room temperature, the WO3 nanoplate film grown on FTO was rinsed with deionized water and then dried at 60 °C for 8 h. All the samples were further annealed at 500 °C for 2 h in air at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. A series of CA-WO3 prepared by hydrothermal treatment for 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 16 h, followed by annealing for 2 h, were named CA-WO3-4h, CA-WO3-8h, CA-WO3-12h, and CA-WO3-16h, respectively. A series of TA-WO3 obtained by hydrothermal treatment for 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 16 h, followed by annealing for 2 h, were named TA-WO3-4h, TA-WO3-8h, TA-WO3-12h, and TA-WO3-16h, respectively. The typical experimental procedure for the synthesis of CA-WO3 and TA-WO3 photoanode films on FTO substrates by a facile hydrothermal method without using strong acids and/or a hazardous chemical is schematically illustrated in Scheme S1.†

2.2 Sample characterization
The crystal structures of the obtained samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-7000, Shimadzu Corp., Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The instrument was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA with a scanning speed of 0.02° s−1. The morphology of the samples was analyzed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800 N, Hitachi Ltd., Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL Ltd., Japan) and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern were employed to obtain the morphology and structures of the as-prepared samples. The samples for FESEM were prepared by cutting a small piece of sample from FTO glass substrates with the WO3 nanoplate array film grown on. For TEM analysis, some powders were gently scratched from the films and dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonication, followed by dropping the mixture onto a copper grid coated with a carbon film. The optical properties were analyzed from UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu-2550, Shimadzu Corp., Japan). The optical band gaps of CA-WO3-12h and TA-WO3-16h were determined using the equation αhν = A(hν − Eg)n, where α, h, and ν are the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, and frequency of light, respectively, and A, Eg, and n are constants related to the material, band gap energy, and n equals to 2 for WO3 as an indirect semiconductor.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC water splitting performance of the as-synthesized samples was tested using a three-electrode system consisting of the as-prepared samples as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode, and platinum foil as the counter electrode. 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte. A 150 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter and a 425 nm long-pass filter was used as the visible light source and the light intensity for the measurement was measured to be 100 mW cm−2. The photocurrent densities were tested using an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT 4, AMETEK Inc., USA), conducted from 0 V to 1.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was studied using a system operated with a monochromator with a 300 W Xe light source. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT 4, AMETEK Inc., USA) in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with 10 mV perturbation at 0.6 V vs. RHE. Mott–Schottky plots were obtained in the dark with a voltage of 100 mV at a frequency of 1 kHz.
In this study, the applied electrode potential was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential according to the Nernst equation:35ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + E0Ag/AgClwhere ERHE refers to the calculated potential vs. RHE and EAg/AgCl is the measured potential vs. Ag/AgCl. All the experiments were performed at room temperature, and the value of E0Ag/AgCl corresponds to 0.197 V and the pH of the 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution is 7.1.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was calculated according to the following equation:  where Jλ is the photocurrent density measured under illumination at λ, λ is the incident light wavelength, and Pλ refers to the power density measured at a specific wavelength.
The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was calculated using the following equation:ABPE (100%) = J × (1.23 − ERHE)/Plight × 100%where J is the photocurrent density, ERHE is the potential versus RHE, and Plight is the simulated solar light intensity.
3. Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the CA-WO3 (WO3 prepared in the presence of citric acid) and TA-WO3 (WO3 prepared in the presence of tartaric acid) photoanodes were first recorded. The studied WO3 can be indexed to monoclinic WO3 (JCPDS no. 43-1035). As shown in Fig. 1a, CA-WO3 photoanodes show diffraction peaks at around 23°, 24°, 29°, and 34°, corresponding to the (002), (200), (112), and (202) crystal facets of WO3, respectively. Interestingly, CA-WO3-4h mainly has the exposed (200) facets, while the (002) diffraction peak shows a higher intensity than other peaks for CA-WO3-16h. The increasing diffraction intensity ratio of (002) to (200) planes (Table S1, ESI†) indicates that as the reaction proceeds, the WO3 crystals prefer to grow on the FTO substrate from the [100] direction of CA-WO3-4h to the [001] direction of CA-WO3-16h. CA-WO3-16h exhibits the most intensive peak of the (002) facet among all the samples. In contrast, TA-WO3 shows only one main intense peak of the (200) facet regardless of the hydrothermal reaction time. Moreover, a very weak diffraction signal of the (002) crystal plane appears in the case of TA-WO3, which implies that the growth of the WO3 crystal is inhibited along the [001] direction22,35 (Fig. 1b).
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns of CA-WO3 and (b) TA-WO3 photoanodes obtained after hydrothermal treatment for 4, 8, 12, and 16 h, followed by annealing at 500 °C. 
To investigate the hydrothermal time dependent morphology, SEM images (Fig. 2) show the CA-WO3 films obtained after hydrothermal treatment for 4, 8, 12, and 16 h, respectively. The top-view SEM images (Fig. 2a, c, e and g) show that CA-WO3 is composed of sandwich structures with plate-like arrays nearly vertically aligned on the FTO substrate. The high-resolution SEM images of sandwich structures are shown in Fig. S1.† This sandwich structure consists of a thin layer in the middle and two thick layers on both sides. The average thickness of the thin and thick nanoplates of CA-WO3 is about 100 and 450 nm. It becomes obvious that the morphologies of the multilayer plates depend essentially on the hydrothermal reaction time and they present two orientations, indicating that CA-WO3 holds two oriented facets. For instance, when increasing the reaction time from 4 to 16 h, the average thickness of the CA-WO3 films increases from 2.9 to 5.8 μm. In contrast to CA-WO3, TA-WO3 exhibits identical nanoplates and nearly perpendicularly grows on the FTO substrate. These nanoplates have only one orientation (Fig. S2†), which is consistent with the XRD results of the exposed main (200) facet for the CA-WO3 films. The average thickness of the nanoplates is 150 nm. The thicknesses of the TA-WO3 films prepared via hydrothermal treatment for 4, 8, 12, and 16 h are 2.9, 3.6, 4.0, and 4.4 um, respectively, which clearly shows the dependence of their thickness on the hydrothermal treatment time.

More detailed morphology and crystal structure of the CA-WO3 and TA-WO3 samples are further investigated by TEM and HR-TEM. Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of CA-WO3-16h and TA-WO3-16 samples. Both WO3 structures have nanoplate-like structures. HR-TEM images of CA-WO3 and TA-WO3 clearly show that both nanoplates are single crystals. The corresponding fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) patterns further confirm the single crystalline nature and high crystallinity of WO3 nanoplates.37,38 For CA-WO3-16h, the lattice spacings of d = 0.384 nm and d = 0.363 nm are in good agreement with the d-spacing values of the (002) and (200) planes of monoclinic WO3.39 The HR-TEM image of TA-WO3-16h (Fig. 3d) shows lattice spacings of d = 0.365 nm and d = 0.374 nm, which are consistent with the intense peak of TA-WO3 in the powder XRD pattern (Fig. 1b).

For comparison purpose, the SEM images (Fig. S3†) of WO3 synthesized without adding organic acids show that the structure is composed of nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 200 to 300 nm, and the thickness of the film is 1.2 μm. Hence it confirms that the addition of organic acids exhibits a remarkable impact on the morphology of WO3. Moreover, different crystallographic orientations between CA-WO3 and TA-WO3 could be due to different structures among citric acid and tartaric acid. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, citric acid contains three carboxylic acid groups per molecule while tartaric acid contains two. Citric acid is just like three tentacles which have a strong complexation with the WO3 nucleus. The schematics of the synthesis of CA-WO3 and TA-WO3 with different morphologies and crystallographic orientations are shown in Fig. 4c and d. Previous studies have shown that tungstate anions will be protonated and polymerized to form polytungstate anions in acidic solution.40,41 At the first stage, the oxidative dissolution of W powders into H2O2 solutions leads to the formation of a clear and strongly acidic solution which contains amorphous peroxotungstic acid particles.36 At the second stage, WO3·2H2O nuclei were formed at 120 °C and then transformed into WO3·H2O with the extension of reaction time.22 Meanwhile, the anisotropic adsorption of citric acid or tartaric acid onto a certain plane and the complexation of carboxylic groups determine the shapes of the products. Thus, CA-WO3 is composed of a sandwich structure and TA-WO3 tends to form nanoplates, while the crystal nucleus of WO3 grows into nanoparticles without the addition of the capping agents. The effect of the number of carboxylic groups per molecule of organic acid on the morphology was also observed by Navarro et al.42 The initially formed CA-WO3 mainly with the exposed (200) facets is probably attributed to the preferable adsorption of citric acid onto the (200) facets. As peroxotungstic acid particles are consumed during the reaction process, the pH of the reaction solution increases. Moreover, the relatively high pH dissolves WO3 during the hydrothermal treatment and increases the concentration of carboxyl group, and the increased carboxyl group gives excessive capping actions.21 Otherwise, the formation and recrystallization of WO3 with exposed (002) facets occur due to the thermodynamic growth conditions and the surface energy of the growth planes. The carboxylic acid groups adsorbed on the (002) facets reduce the growth rate along this orientation. Citric acid contains three carboxylic acid groups per molecule which have a strong complexation with tungsten atoms, and the adsorbed citric acid on the (002) facets significantly restrains the growth along the a-axis. Hence, the exposed (200) planes were observed in CA-WO3-4h, while the (002) planes were observed exposed on the CA-WO3-16h sample. Due to the weak complexation with W atoms of tartaric acid containing only two carboxylic acid groups per molecule, the TA-WO3 sample exhibits identical exposed (200) facets. It is worth noting that tartaric acid and citric acid only influence the morphology and crystallographic orientation of WO3 rather than the PEC performance. After rinsing with deionized water and further annealing at 500 °C for 2 h, the organic ligands were completely removed and decomposed. More evidence is provided in Fig. S4.†

The UV-visible absorption spectra and Tauc plots of CA-WO3-12h and TA-WO3-16h with a comparable film thickness are compared (Fig. S5†). The absorption edges of the two samples occur similarly at around 480 nm, while CA-WO3-12h exhibits a slight red shift which indicates that the Eg of the CA-WO3-12h sandwich structure is smaller than that of TA-WO3-16h nanoplates. The Eg for the WO3 products is obtained for the plotted (αhν)1/2 as a function of hν (the detailed calculation is shown in the ESI.†). According to the Tauc plots, the energy band gaps of CA-WO3-12h and TA-WO3-16h are estimated to be 2.65 and 2.69 eV, respectively. However, the light absorption difference between CA-WO3-12h and TA-WO3-16h is so inconspicuous that it cannot be the dominating factor to enhance the PEC performance.
The PEC water oxidation performance of the CA-WO3 sandwich structure and TA-WO3 nanoplates is investigated with a three-electrode cell system with the WO3 film as the working electrode, which is exposed with a surface area of ∼1 cm2 under AM 1.5 G sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2), and a Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum foil as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. The photocurrent density versus potential (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5. The photocurrent densities of TA-WO3 are enhanced with increasing hydrothermal reaction time (Fig. 5b) and the photocurrent density of CA-WO3 increased from 1.25 for CA-WO3-4h to 3.16 mA cm−2 for CA-WO3-12h and then decreased to 2.54 mA cm−2 for CA-WO3-16h (Fig. 5a). As shown in the SEM images, the thickness of the films increased with increasing hydrothermal reaction time; the enhancement of the photocurrent density is related to the thickness of the films, which has been demonstrated by Kafizas et al.,43 Amano et al.,44 Zheng et al.,45 and Andreu et al.46 As the CA-WO3 sandwich structure and TA-WO3 nanoplates are vertically in situ grown on the FTO substrate and exhibit many gaps among the plates (Fig. 2 and S2†), this structure can facilitate electrolyte transportation and cause the photogenerated holes to be easily injected into the electrolyte across the short radial dimension. The increased active areas along the long axial dimension contribute to the capture of more photogenerated holes by the electrolyte and thereby improve the PEC performance. A thicker nanoplate film (>4 μm) can be sufficiently long to facilitate complete light absorption in the near-visible range which enhances the photocatalytic activity.43 As the thickness of the sandwich structured WO3 increases to 5.8 μm (CA-WO3-16), the photocurrent density decreases which is attributed to the limitation of the electron diffusion length.43 The photocurrent density of the TA-WO3-16h sample with highly exposed (200) facets is 1.52 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5b), while the CA-WO3-12h film with a thickness comparable to that of TA-WO3-16h, but with highly exposed (002) facets, exhibits a higher photocurrent density of 3.16 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5a). This suggests that the crystal facet engineering of WO3 has significantly influenced the PEC water splitting performance. CA-WO3-12h with highly exposed (002) facets and an appropriately thick film achieves the largest photocurrent density among all the resulting samples and reaches the highest value compared to previously reported WO3 photoanodes summarized in Table S3.†

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the TA-WO3-16h, CA-WO3-16h, and CA-WO3-12h photoanodes is compared by determining the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) because Cdl is linearly proportional to the ECSA.47 The Cdl value was measured through cyclic voltammetry (CV) between 0.2 and 0.4 V vs. RHE with different scan rates ranging from 10 to 190 mV s−1. The values of Cdl were obtained from the slope of the plot (different current densities at the middle potential (i.e. 0.3 V) vs. the scan rate).48 As shown in Fig. S7,† the Cdl values of CA-WO3-16h and CA-WO3-12h (1740 and 1370 μF cm−2) are much larger than that of TA-WO3-16h (457 μF cm−2). This result suggests that the sandwich structure can provide more active sites and a larger specific reaction surface area for PEC water splitting.
The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) are important factors for evaluating the photoactive performance. The CA-WO3-12h photoanode exhibits a maximum ABPE of 0.41%, while relatively low values of 0.32% and 0.25% are observed for CA-WO3-16h and TA-WO3-16h (Fig. 6a), respectively. Fig. 6b shows the IPCE of CA-WO3-12h, CA-WO3-16h and TA-WO3-16h. The photocurrent responses are mainly located in the wavelength region between 350 and 480 nm and decrease to almost zero above 480 nm. The much higher IPCE value of CA-WO3-12h than that of TA-WO3-16h indicates that the effects of the sandwich structure and (002) facet contribute to effective absorption of light and separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Compared with CA-WO3-12h, the value of CA-WO3-16h is much lower, owing to the fact that the excessively thick film limits the electron transfer efficiency. The CA-WO3-12h photoanode exhibits an IPCE value of 79% at 400 nm, which is among the best values compared with previously reported WO3 (Table S3†).

To understand the electronic properties of the CA-WO3-12h, CA-WO3-16h and TA-WO3-16h photoanodes, Mott–Schottky plots were established at 1000 Hz in aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 6c, all the samples exhibit positive slopes in the Mott–Schottky plots, indicating the characteristics of n-type semiconductors. The flat band potential (Efb) is obtained by extrapolating straight lines on the potential axis. The Efb and donor densities (Nd) of the samples can be calculated based on the Mott–Schottky equation as follows:491/C2 = (2/eεε0Nd)(E − Efb − kT/e)Nd = (2/eε0ε)[d(1/C2)/dE]−1where C is the space charge layer capacitance of WO3, ε is the dielectric constant of WO3 (ε = 20), ε0 refers to the permittivity of vacuum, e refers to the electron charge, and E is the applied bias. The calculated Efb and Nd values are summarized in Table 1. Compared with CA-WO3-16h and TA-WO3-16h, the CA-WO3-12h photoanode shows a decreased value of Efb. The negative shift of Efb in CA-WO3-12h is due to the substantially increased donor density (Table 1) that shifts the Fermi level of WO3 upward,50 which facilitates charge separation and thereby enhances the PEC water splitting performance. On the other hand, CA-WO3-12h and CA-WO3-16h exhibit significantly increased Nd compared to TA-WO3-16h (Table 1), which is due to the sandwich structure with a larger specific reaction surface area and more active sites (Fig. S7†). Additionally, the highly reactive (002) facets can facilitate charge separation and improve the charge transport at the WO3/electrolyte interface which is discussed in Fig. 7 in detail. Whereas CA-WO3-16h exhibited a smaller Nd (4.61 ×1020 cm−3) than CA-WO3-12h (5.01 ×1020 cm−3), this result suggested that the film of CA-WO3-16h is excessively thick, thereby limiting electron transfer and resulting in more recombination of electrons and holes occurring in the bulk of CA-WO3-16h.

To understand the charge transport properties at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at a constant potential (0.6 V vs. RHE) under AM 1.5 G illumination. Fig. 6d shows the Nyquist plots of the CA-WO3-12h, CA-WO3-16h and TA-WO3-16h photoanodes. These curves can be well-fitted by an equivalent circuit model, which contains the circuit series resistance (Rs) and the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the electrolyte (RCT). Rs is associated with charge transfer through the bulk of the semiconductor, semiconductor/FTO substrate, and the FTO substrate resistance.51–53 The resistance fitting results are listed in Table S2.† The Rs of CA-WO3-12h is smaller than that of others, yielding the fastest charge transfer. Furthermore, the smallest arc radius of CA-WO3-12h corresponds to the lowest RCT value, indicating the fastest charge transport at the CA-WO3-12h photoanodes/electrolyte interface.35 Therefore, the improved PEC performance is ascribable to the smaller charge-transfer resistance, that is, the synergistic effect of the (002) facets and sandwich structure with an appropriate thickness of the film contributes to the improved photoanode current density.
The photo-response and photostability properties of the CA-WO3-12h, CA-WO3-16h and TA-WO3-16h photoanodes were further measured by photocurrent density vs. time (Fig. 6e) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under chopping light irradiation. For all the samples, the photocurrents rapidly rise to the saturation value upon illumination and then drop rapidly to zero once the light is turned off, indicating the rapid photo-response properties of the obtained samples. CA-WO3-12h and CA-WO3-16h exhibit enhanced photostability, indicating that the (002) facets inhibit the formation of peroxo species on the surface of WO3. Furthermore, the H2 and O2 evolution–time plots for the CA-WO3-12h sample are established at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (Fig. 6f). The amount of gas was detected with a gas chromatograph every 10 min. The generated H2 and O2 were measured to be 92.97 and 42.83 μmol, respectively, after 120 min. The faradaic efficiencies for H2 and O2 were also obtained to be above 85%, suggesting a high water oxidation capacity for CA-WO3-12h.
To study in more detail about the photoelectrochemical mechanism of CA-WO3 and TA-WO3 photoanodes, the charge separation efficiency (φsep) and charge injection efficiency (φinj) of the TA-WO3-16h, CA-WO3-16h, and CA-WO3-12h photoanodes were further compared by adding 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.1 M sodium sulfite as a hole scavenger. The PEC water splitting of the semiconductor is determined from φsep, φinj, and φabs (light absorption efficiency), which can be expressed by JPEC = Jmax × φabs × φsep × φinj,54,55 where Jmax is the maximum photocurrent density which can be calculated to be 4.010 mA cm−1 for WO3 under AM 1.5 G illumination when the IPCE for photons with an energy above the bandgap energy is 100%.51,55,56 For the photoelectrochemical measurement in the presence of sodium sulfite, φinj can be considered to be 1 due to the fast oxidation kinetics. Thus, the JPEC(hole scavenger) can be represented by JPEC(hole scavenger) = Jmax × φabs × φsep. Furthermore, φinj and φsep can be separately calculated using the equation φinj ≈ JPEC(water)/JPEC(hole scavenger) and φsep ≈ JPEC(hole scavenger)/(Jmax × φabs). As shown in Fig. 7c, CA-WO3-12h achieves the highest φsep (64%) at 1.23 VRHE compared with TA-WO3-16h and CA-WO3-16h, which suggests that the (002) facets contribute to the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, CA-WO3-16h exhibits a slightly lower φsep than TA-WO3-16h. This is ascribed to the fact that the thicker film limits the electron transport distance and thereby increases electron–hole recombination. Particularly, the φinj of CA-WO3-16h and CA-WO3-12h at 1.23 V vs. RHE is much higher than that of TA-WO3-16h (Fig. 7d). These results indicate that the (002) facet facilitates charge separation and improves the charge transport at the photoanodes/electrolyte interface.
In the PEC water splitting system (Fig. 8), WO3 absorbs photon energy that is no less than the band gap energy of WO3 to excite the electron–hole pairs in the bulk. The photogenerated holes migrate to the WO3/electrolyte interface to oxidize water molecules to O2, while the photoexcited electrons transfer through the external circuit to the counter electrode (Pt) to reduce water molecules to H2. In this process, the peroxo species and hydroxyl radicals (OH*) could form and accumulate on the surface of WO3, which suppressed the charge transfer at the WO3/electrolyte interface and thereby reduced the PEC performance.31 As the (002) facet of WO3 exhibited the highest surface energy compared to the (200) facet and (020) facet, the (002) facet would need less energy to drive water oxidation and enhance the PEC performance. Due to the high energy of the (002) facet, the peroxo species and HO* species are unfavorable to be formed on the surface, thus enhancing the stability of the PEC system.35 The (002) facet with more redox activity of photogenerated electron–hole pairs contributes to the charge separation and improves the charge transport at the CA-WO3-12h photoanodes/electrolyte interface, thereby reducing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.
 Fig. 8  Schematic illustration of the PEC water oxidation mechanism on the WO3 sandwich structure with the highly exposed (002) facet under visible light. 
In this work, sandwich structured CA-WO3 has a 2D nanoplate structure. Thanks to the large specific reaction surface area, highly efficient and directional transport of electrons and holes, the 2D structure always exhibits an enhanced PEC performance compared with nanorods and nanowires.22,28,29,57 The superior crystallinity of the resulting CA-WO3 with fewer defects could further impede the formation of peroxo species on the surface of WO3 and decrease the undesirable recombination of electron–hole pairs.22,31 The CA-WO3-12h sample with an appropriate film thickness contributed to the enhanced near-visible-light absorption. In one word, the outstanding photocurrent of the CA-WO3-12h photoanode was attributed to the appropriate thickness of the film, the sandwich structure, superior crystallinity, and exposed highly reactive (002) facet.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the sandwich structure and nanoplatelets of WO3 were in situ synthesized grown on FTO substrates. The morphologies and orientation were controlled by citric acid and tartaric acid during the crystal growth process. The number of carboxylic acid groups per molecule of organic acids showed a great effect on the morphology and crystal orientation. The sandwich structured CA-WO3 tended to have exposed highly reactive (002) facets, while TA-WO3 nanoplatelets showed mainly the exposed (200) facets. The sandwich structured CA-WO3-12h with highly reactive (002) oriented facets and an appropriate film thickness exhibited an extraordinary PEC water splitting performance, and showed a photocurrent density of 3.16 mA cm−2 in aqueous Na2SO4 under AM 1.5 G illumination and an IPCE value of 79% at 400 nm at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The synergistic effects of the exposure of the highly reactive (002) facet and the sandwich structure with superior crystallinity of the 2-D nanoplate effectively facilitated the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and suppressed the formation of peroxo-species. The enhanced PEC performance and superior photo-stability of WO3 photoelectrode materials open new opportunities for efficient PEC water splitting applications. We believe this work will pave the initial way to engineer advanced energy conversion materials from an oriented facet point of view following a “green chemistry” protocol. They will be highly beneficial for photo-electrocatalysis,58 electrocatalysis,59 and energy60,61 and environmental62 research.
