    , Accepted 8th December 2021First published on 12th January 2022AbstractThe conversion of CO2 and water into valuable chemicals under sunlight irradiation is of great significance for solving the widespread problems of both limited energy sources and global warming. In this work, new artificial photosynthesis was established through a photocatalysis process of reducing CO2 to CH4. A photocatalyst compounded from a porphyrin (metalloporphyrin) and TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2NTs) was prepared, and its photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction under Xe lamp irradiation was studied. Compared with the pure TiO2NTs, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of metalloporphyrin-sensitized TiO2NTs is significantly enhanced. The amount of methane produced with the cobalt tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin/TiO2NTs (CoTCPP/TiO2NTs) photocatalyst is about 5.5 times higher than that produced with TiO2NTs alone. The improvement of photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the enhancement of light absorption ability of CoTCPP/TiO2NTs and the inhibition of electron–hole recombination. Furthermore, according to the results of the photocatalytic and photo(electro)chemical experiments, a probable mechanism for the photoreduction of CO2 over CoTCPP/TiO2NTs is presented.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the pressure generated by economic and population growth and the need to improve living standards has caused harmful effects on the environment. Human production activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, have produced a large amount of CO2, which is considered to be a major cause of global warming.1,2 To address this critical energy and environmental issue, scientists and researchers around the world are developing the field of renewable energy, such as wind, hydro, biomass, nuclear, and solar power. Solar energy is regarded as one of the green and inexhaustible resources, and researchers nowadays focus more on converting solar energy into value-added solar fuels.3–6 In the long run, the use of solar photocatalysis to convert CO2 would be the most attractive way to reduce CO2.7–9
TiO2 has attracted much attention due to a series of advantages, such as non-toxicity, pollution-free, low-cost and good stability.10–14 However, it exhibits poor performance in CO2 reduction, because the sensitivity of TiO2 was limited to only the UV light region.15–17 To use the complete solar spectrum, various strategies have been applied, such as metal doping,18–20 non-metal doping,21–26 sensitization27–30 and semiconductor coupling.31,32 However, the combination of organic sensitizers and TiO2 is the best choice for the preparation of high-efficiency photocatalysts.33–36 In recent years, porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 has been considered to be an efficient CO2 photoreduction system, because porphyrin and its derivatives have inherent advantages in plant photosynthesis and can enhance the fixation and transformation of CO2.37–41 Li et al. successfully prepared asymmetric zinc porphyrin-sensitized TiO2, which can efficiently convert CO2 to CO and CH4 in a gaseous system.42 Wang et al. reported that CO2 photoreduction reaction on CuTCPP modified P25 catalysts, 0.5% CuTCPP/P25, showed the highest reduction yields, much higher than P25.43
TiO2NTs prepared by an anodization method have proved to be a good catalyst for the photoreduction of carbon dioxide.44–46 Because of its controllable morphology and size, low cost, large-scale preparation, and easy separation and purification of the product, it also has higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2 nanopores or nanoparticles. Therefore, synergistic photocatalytic activity can be achieved by combining TiO2NTs with high photocatalytic activity and porphyrins with outstanding optical absorption properties. However, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by the combination of TiO2NTs and porphyrins is rarely reported.
In this work, TiO2NTs were chosen as the basis and further modified with porphyrins or metalloporphyrins, as catalysts and solar absorbers to enhance both the light absorption and CO2 reduction yields. The synthesized composite photocatalysts exhibit a broadened light absorption range, but also increase the separation rate of interfacial charges. They are expected to display a greatly ameliorated photocatalytic activity when sensitized with porphyrins (metalloporphyrins) during the process of CO2 photoreduction.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Ti foil (99.99% purity, 0.2 mm thickness) was purchased from Qinghe Country Xinji Metal Materials Co. Ltd., China. Glycol, ammonium fluoride (NH4F), pyrrole, 4-formylbenzoic acid, propionic acid, cobalt acetate tetrahydrate ((CH3COO)2Co·4H2O), and copper acetate monohydrate ((CH3COO)2Cu·H2O) were all purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. Methanol, ethanol, acetic acid and absolute dimethylformamide (C3H7NO, DMF, 99.9%) were obtained from Tianjin Chemical Reagents Company. All the reagents are analytical grade and were used directly without further purification except pyrrole, which needs to be purified by distillation before use. Deionized water was used in all experiments.
2.2 Preparation of the photocatalysts

2.2.1 Preparation of TiO2NTs. 
TiO2NTs were synthesized by a two-step anodic oxidation method in a fluoride-containing electrolyte. 1.5 cm2 Ti foil was successively washed with acetone, absolute ethanol and deionized water by ultrasonication for 15 min. The anodization was carried out in a two-electrode battery with the cleaned Ti foil as the anode and Pt foil as the counter electrode, respectively. The two-step anodic oxidation was carried out at 60 V for 30 min in the electrolyte comprising ethylene glycol, 2 vol% deionized water, and 0.3 wt% NH4F. After the first-step anodization, the formed oxidation film was ultrasonically removed in deionized water, and then the same Ti sheet was anodized in the same atmosphere. After anodization, the TiO2 nanotube electrodes were washed with deionized water and calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 3 h with a temperature increasing rate of 2 °C min−1.


2.2.2 >Preparation of tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP). 
First, 3.00 g (0.02 mol) 4-formylbenzoic acid and 80 mL propionic acid were added into a 250 mL three-necked flask, stirred for 20 min and heated to 130 °C. Then, 1.4 mL (0.02 mol) freshly steamed pyrrole was slowly added dropwise into the mixture solution within 10 min. The reaction proceeded at reflux for 4 h. After the reaction finished, 10 mL ethanol was added and stirred when the mixture has cooled to room temperature. The mixed solution was placed in a 4 °C cold water bath and reacted for 18 h. The crude product was obtained by filtration and washed with methanol several times, and then Soxhlet extraction was carried out with 70 mL methanol until the solution became clear. Finally, it was washed with 20 ml deionized water and filtered to obtain the purple filter cake.


2.2.3 Preparation of copper tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (CuTCPP) and CoTCPP. 
79 mg TCPP (0.1 mmol) and 75 mg (CH3COO)2Co·4H2O (0.3 mmol) were dissolved in a 200 mL mixed solution of DMF and acetic acid (volume ratio: 1:1), and further refluxed for 2 h. The reaction solution was subsequently cooled and added to 500 mL water to precipitate the products. Finally, the products were collected by filtering, washing, and drying.
The synthesis steps for CuTCPP are the same as those for CoTCPP, and 75 mg (CH3COO)2Co·4H2O is replaced with 60 mg (CH3COO)2Cu·H2O.


2.2.4 Preparation of TCPP/TiO2NTs, CuTCPP/TiO2NTs and CoTCPP/TiO2NTs. 
TCPP, CuTCPP, and CoTCPP were dissolved in DMF at a concentration of 1 mM, respectively. The TiO2 nanotubes were immersed in the above solution and magnetically stirred for 5 h. After this time, the catalysts were dried at room temperature, and the preparation process is illustrated in Scheme 1. The amount of TCPP, CuTCPP and CoTCPP impregnated in the TiO2NTs was indirectly determined by UV-vis analysis, using the molar absorptivity of the Soret bands of TCPP, CuTCPP and CoTCPP. It was possible to determine the contents of TCPP, CuTCPP and CoTCPP in the composites, which are all about 1.5%.

2.3 Characterization
The morphology and structure of the products were observed by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100) and scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Sigma) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo, USA) with an Al Kα radiation source was used to explore the elemental composition of the samples. The crystalline phases of the products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX 2200, Cu Kα radiation) with a scattering angle ranging from 5 °C to 80 °C. The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained from a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Evolution 220) integrated with an integrating sphere attachment. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer LS 55) with a Xe lamp as the light source. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were measured using a JES-X320 (JEOL, Japan).
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical properties of the samples were recorded by using an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 3000A) in a standard three-electrode cell with a working electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode. 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the supporting electrolyte. Transient photocurrent response under intermittent illumination was tested at a bias potential of 0.5 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with an AC voltage of 5 mV in the dark. The Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out at an alternating current perturbation signal of 10 mV with a frequency of 1000 Hz.
2.5 Photocatalytic experiments
The CO2 photoreduction experiment was carried out in a homemade photoreactor with a volume of 150 mL. A 500 W Xe lamp was utilized as a visible light source, and the prepared samples with the area of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm (or 0.1 g TCPP, CuTCPP, and CoTCPP) were loaded into the reactor. Prior to the illumination, the reactor was purged with highly purified CO2 for 60 min, and the CO2 gas was passed through the steam generator and the flow rate was kept at 60 mL min−1. When the CO2 pressure in the reactor reaches 1.5 atm, the reactor is sealed. The circulating cooling water was used to reduce the reaction temperature. After 3 h of irradiation, the product was collected and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-TCD (Agilent, 7890B).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the TiO2NTs and photosensitized-TiO2NTs catalysts
The morphology of the obtained different samples was analyzed using FESEM (Fig. 1a–h). Fig. 1(a and b) shows the top view and cross-sectional FESEM images of the pure TiO2NTs; a smooth surface with a uniform tubular structure is observed, the tube mouths of the pure TiO2NTs are almost bare, and the nanotubes densely grew and are perpendicular to the titanium plate. For the TCPP/TiO2NTs composites (Fig. 1(c and d)), the lamellar sediments are covering the surface of the TiO2NTs. The cross-sectional image of TCPP/TiO2NTs shows a rougher surface, compared to the pristine TiO2NTs. The microstructures of CoTCPP/TiO2NTs are shown in Fig. 1(e and f), and it is possible to see that most of the particles were on the surface of the TiO2NTs with a small number of particles loaded into the TiO2NT structure, leaving free areas of the TiO2NTs able to be photoexcited by light incidence, as expected. For the CuTCPP/TiO2NTs, the deposition of thicker layers of CuTCPP over the TiO2NTs (Fig. 1(g and h)). The morphology and microstructure of CoTCPP/TiO2NTs were further studied by TEM (Fig. 2). As illustrated in Fig. 2a and b, CoTCPP are fairly well dispersed on the outside and inner walls of the nanotubes. The lattice fringe spacing was ∼0.35 nm as shown in Fig. 2c, which is attributed to the anatase (101) crystal plane. The EDS elemental mappings of CoTCPP/TiO2NTs (Fig. 2d) indicate that Ti, O, N, C and Co are homogeneously distributed throughout the nanotubes, further demonstrating the successful decoration of CoTCPP on the surface of the TiO2NTs.

XPS measurements were conducted to investigate the elemental composition and chemical state of CoTCPP/TiO2NTs. Fig. 3a shows the survey spectrum of CoTCPP/TiO2NTs, and the measured spectrum indicates the presence of Ti, O, C, N and Co, which is consistent with the results of the EDS elemental analysis. As revealed in Fig. 3b, two strong peaks appeared at 458.8 and 464.5 eV, which can be ascribed to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 regions. In the O 1s spectrum shown in Fig. 3c, it can be obviously observed that two peaks appeared at the binding energies of 531.9 and 530.3 eV, which are attributed to –OH species and lattice oxygen. It can be seen from the high-resolution C 1s spectrum that the two peaks at 288.5 and 284.7 eV belong to the CO and CC bonds in CoTCPP. Fig. 3e and f show the peak binding energies of N 1s and Co 2p, respectively. Due to the low content of N and Co in the composite, the characteristic signal is weak. As shown in Fig. 3f, Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 are located at 780.3 and 795.2 eV, which further confirm the successful construction of CoTCPP/TiO2NTs.

Fig. 4 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the as-synthesized samples. All of the isotherms display a type IV isotherm with a discrete hysteresis loop (H3 type). The surface areas were 26.49, 37.79, 25.61 and 83.75 cm2 g−1 for bare TiO2NTs, TCPP/TiO2NTs, CuTCPP/TiO2NTs, and CoTCPP/TiO2NTs, respectively. The pore volume is 0.1085, 0.1315, 0.1385 and 0.2371 cm3 g−1 for bare TiO2NTs, TCPP/TiO2NTs, CuTCPP/TiO2NTs, and CoTCPP/TiO2NT, respectively. The integration of CoTCPP and TiO2NTs provides a higher specific surface area, and the smaller specific surface area of CuTCPP/TiO2NTs could be due to CuTCPP particles blocking the nanotubes.

XRD analysis was performed to study the crystal structures of the as-prepared samples. The crystallinity of the composite materials is crucial to their photocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 5a, the diffraction peaks of the TiO2NTs are in good agreement with those of the anatase-phase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272). One can notice that the positions of the diffraction peaks of TCPP, CuTCPP/TiO2NTs and CoTCPP/TiO2NTs completely coincide with those of bare anatase TiO2. The above results suggest that the impregnation of porphyrin onto the surface of TiO2 has little influence on the intrinsic crystal structure of the TiO2 nanotubes. Porphyrin was loaded on the surface of the TiO2 nanotubes, rather than doped into the TiO2 crystal lattice, indicating the formation of the porphyrin photocatalysts without interference in the TiO2 nanostructure.
 Fig. 5  (a) XRD patterns, (b) UV-vis DRS spectra, (c) estimation of band gap energies, and (d) PL spectra of the as-synthesized samples. 
To study the light absorption performance of the prepared materials, the UV-vis DRS spectra of the bare TiO2NTs and TCPP/TiO2NTs, CuTCPP/TiO2NTs, and CoTCPP/TiO2NTs photocatalysts were recorded in the range of 200–800 nm (Fig. 5b). These spectra show that there are no distinct absorption peaks of bare TiO2 above 400 nm owing to the inherent large band gap. Nevertheless, all the composites exhibited a broad visible light harvesting region and high photoresponse properties. And there are characteristic porphyrin absorption peaks in the region of 400 nm to 700 nm. This shows that all the porphyrins were successfully and perfectly impregnated onto the surface of TiO2 without changing the porphyrin structure framework. Therefore, the light response of TiO2 changed from the UV region to the visible light region due to the participation of porphyrins on its surface, which will allow more efficient utilization of the solar spectrum, where the photogenerated electrons are effectively excited, which further improves the photocatalytic behavior. As shown in Fig. 5b, CoTCPP/TiO2NTs shows much stronger visible light absorption properties relative to TCPP/TiO2NTs and CuTCPP/TiO2NTs. The band gap values can be converted from the UV-vis DRS absorption data using the Kubelka–Munk equation.47 The band gaps of bare TiO2NTs, TCPP/TiO2NTs, CuTCPP/TiO2NTs, and CoTCPP/TiO2NTs as observed in Fig. 5c are about 3.17, 2.60, 2.49 and 2.39 eV, respectively. The decrease of the band gap can be ascribed to the modification of the porphyrins (metalloporphyrins), which is beneficial to the improvement of the absorption of visible light.
To explore the separation and recombination properties of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs in the as-synthesized samples, the PL spectra were obtained. As shown in Fig. 5d, comparing with the TiO2NTs, the peak intensity of the samples after recombination is greatly suppressed, indicating the accelerated separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs after the porphyrin sensitization, resulting in decreased fluorescence emission. In summary, it shows that the composites can restrain the recombination of photoinduced charges, and the CoTCPP/TiO2NTs composite exhibits the most effective control of the recombination of electron–hole pairs, which plays a crucial part in improving the photocatalytic activity with visible light irradiation.
To further study the charge transfer and recombination of photogenerated electrons, the transient photocurrent–time curves were measured. Fig. 6a shows the transient photocurrent responses for bare TiO2NTs, TCPP/TiO2NTs, CuTCPP/TiO2NTs, and CoTCPP/TiO2NTs. The measurements were carried out under the illumination of a Xe lamp with a 20 s switching period at a bias potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. When the lamp is turned on, the photocurrent density increases rapidly and finally remains stable, and when the lamp is turned off, the photocurrent density drops instantly. The photocurrent appears recurrently with the light on and off, illustrating their stability and reproducibility. Obviously, CoTCPP/TiO2NTs shows the highest photocurrent density, while the pure TiO2NTs show the lowest. The photocurrent of TCPP/TiO2NTs and CuTCPP/TiO2NTs increased slightly compared to the pure TiO2NTs. The results reveal that the composites exhibit less recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs and a longer lifetime of light-triggered carriers.
 Fig. 6  (a) Transient photocurrent responses, (b) EIS Nyquist plots, (c) Mott–Schottky plots and (d) energy-level diagrams of the as-synthesized samples. 
EIS tests were performed to investigate the charge transfer at the interface between the as-prepared photoelectrodes and the electrolyte. In Fig. 6b, the radius of the curves denotes the resistance of the samples in the process of charge transfer. A smaller radius of the semicircle corresponds to a lower resistance at the surface of the photoelectrodes. As can be seen, the order of the semicircle radius in the EIS Nyquist plots is TiO2NTs > TCPP/TiO2NTs > CuTCPP/TiO2NTs > CoTCPP/TiO2NTs. Therefore, the CoTCPP/TiO2NTs electrode exhibits the smallest resistance. All these results demonstrate that a smaller charge-transfer resistance in the composites promotes the migration and separation of photoinduced carriers, thereby increasing the CO2 photoreduction performance.
To further illustrate the electronic properties including the shift of the conduction band minimum in the as-synthesized samples, the Mott–Schottky analysis was carried out in the dark, as displayed in Fig. 6c. It shows that all the as-synthesized samples exhibited positive slopes of the linear plots and can be identified as n-type semiconductors. The flat band potentials (Efb) of these samples could be obtained from the horizontal intercept,48 and are about −0.44, −0.48, −0.53, and −0.54 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 6.5) for the pure TiO2NTs, TCPP/TiO2NTs, CuTCPP/TiO2NTs and CoTCPP/TiO2NTs, respectively. Which are equal to −0.27 V, −0.31 V, −0.36 V and −0.37 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH = 7) according to the Nernst equation.60 Generally, for n-type semiconductors, the Efb is about 0.2 V positive than its conduction band potential (ECB).61 Thus, the ECB of TiO2NTs, TCPP/TiO2NTs, CuTCPP/TiO2NTs and CoTCPP/TiO2NTs are −0.47, −0.51, −0.56 and −0.57 V vs. NHE, respectively. The valence band potentials (EVB) of these samples can be calculated using the formula EVB = ECB + Eg (ref. 49) and are shown in Fig. 6d. The results suggested that the photosensitized-TiO2NT catalysts exhibited a negative shift of ECB, which leading to more electrons to migrate to the surface of the catalyst. At the same time, the band gap is narrowed to obtain more visible light.
3.2 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance
To investigate the photocatalytic reduction CO2 performance of the prepared samples, a gas phase photocatalytic reaction was evaluated. It was found that the main reaction products were CH4 and a small amount of H2 and CO, so the CH4 yield was used for evaluating the performance of the catalyst (Fig. 7a). The pure TiO2NTs were initially used as the catalysts in the CO2 photoreduction experiment. The reaction result showed that the TiO2NTs had weaker activity on the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 (7.15 μmol cm−2 h−1). The photosensitized TiO2NTs exhibited higher CO2 photoreduction efficiency in comparison with pure TiO2, demonstrating that the combination of TiO2NTs and photosensitizers goes far towards improving the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Among the as-prepared composites, the CoTCPP/TiO2NTs catalyst exhibited the best CO2 reduction performance with the reduction rate of 39.61 μmol cm−2 h−1 and 0.76% light quantum efficiency, which is more than 5.5 times higher compared to those of the pure TiO2NTs, indicating the excellent performance of this photocatalyst in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
 Fig. 7  (a) Photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance over the different catalysts. (b) Stability test results for the CoTCPP/TiO2NTs catalyst. 
To finally demonstrate the role of the CoTCPP/TiO2NTs catalyst in the photocatalytic system, several comparative experiments were carried out, and only one variable was changed for each comparison experiment, including: (1) experiments performed under dark conditions; (2) without the catalyst; (3) carbon dioxide was replaced with argon. No reaction product CH4 was obtained in all the comparative experiments. The catalytic reaction cannot be carried out under dark conditions, indicating that the reaction is a real light-driven photocatalytic reaction. There is no product in the reaction without adding the catalyst, demonstrating that the catalyst plays a crucial role in the reaction. When Ar was used instead of CO2 for the reaction, no product was obtained, indicating that CO2 is the C source of the organic products and acts as the reactant in the catalytic reaction. The above results confirm that under light conditions, the CoTCPP/TiO2NTs photocatalyst can convert CO2 to CH4. To further evaluate the CO2 conversion activity of CoTCPP/TiO2NTs, a comparison of the CH4 yield with different composites from the literature is shown in Table 1. Compared with those of other reports, the photocatalyst synthesized in this study shows better performance for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Table 2 presents the CO2 reduction in the liquid phase and its products reported in the literature using the TiO2-based catalysts. Comparing the results obtained in the present work with other studies reported in the literature with the CO2 reduction in the liquid phase, it can be observed that different products can be obtained from the CO2 reduction in the different systems. The stability and recyclability of the photocatalysts are important factors for practical applications. Therefore, CoTCPP/TiO2NTs was recovered and subjected to ten cycles of photocatalytic tests for stability, and the results are presented in Fig. 7b; negligible reduction in CH4 evolution can be observed, which indicated that CoTCPP/TiO2NTs is stable and reusable.

3.3 Mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 reduction
To gain in-depth understanding on the reaction mechanism for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4, in situ ESR investigation was performed to monitor the reaction intermediates. Fig. 8 shows the ESR spectra with DMPO as the radical trapper of CoTCPP/TiO2NTs in the presence of CO2 and H2O. No signals are generated in the dark. The typical signals of DMPO–CO2˙− and DMPO–˙OH were observed only after 5 min light irradiation, which demonstrated that the CO2˙− and ˙OH radicals were generated during the photoreduction processes. It is generally considered that the conversion of CO2 to CO2˙− is the initial step of the reduction process. CO2˙− may combine with H˙ radicals to form a CH˙ radical, CH2, a ˙CH3 radical, and finally CH4.59
 Fig. 8  ESR spectra of DMPO–˙OH and DMPO–CO2˙− recorded in the dark and under visible light irradiation of CoTCPP/TiO2NTs. 
Based on the above characterization and CO2 photoreduction performance, a possible reaction mechanism for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 over CoTCPP/TiO2NTs is shown in Scheme 2. Under Xe lamp light irradiation, electrons and holes were generated on CoTCPP and TiO2NTs. The LUMO of CoTCPP is sufficiently negative than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2NTs, and the valance band (VB) of TiO2NTs is more positive than the HOMO of CoTCPP.
 Scheme 2  The possible mechanism of CO2 photoreduction over CoTCPP/TiO2NTs. 
The photo-induced electrons on the LUMO of CoTCPP can be migrated to the CB of the TiO2NTs, thereby involving in the reduction process of CO2. In addition, the photoinduced holes on the VB of the TiO2NTs can transfer to that of CoTCPP, reacting afterward with H2O to form H+, which acts as a reactant to produce CH4 in the photocatalytic reaction. Consequently, the combination of CoTCPP and TiO2NTs broadens the range of light response, enhances the charge separation rate, and plays a prominent part in improving the efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
4. Conclusion
In our research, a new artificial photosynthesis process under visible light irradiation has been achieved over porphyrin(metalloporphyrin)-functionalized TiO2NT plate photocatalysts. Herein, porphyrins, copper/cobalt porphyrins and TiO2NTs were synthesized along with the corresponding sensitized TiO2NT-based photocatalysts. As compared to the TiO2NT samples, the optimized samples showed a wider spectral absorption range, stronger fluorescence quenching, enhanced photocurrent density, and decreased impedance. It can be concluded that the different coordination metals in the center of the porphyrin ring result in different photoreduction CO2 efficiencies. CoTCPP/TiO2NTs shows the highest CH4 evolution rate of 39.61 μmol cm−2 h−1, approximately 5.5 times higher than that generated by the TiO2NTs alone. The high photocatalytic efficiency was attributed to a combination of the perpendicularly aligned TiO2NTs and porphyrins (metalloporphyrins) which offer more optimal geometrical shapes with a distinctly shorter carrier route in the tube walls, better visible light absorption capability due to porphyrins, and higher charge separation efficiency. Transformation of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere into ideal industrial raw materials by the photocatalyst under light illumination, particularly utilizing the wide solar spectrum, is an important subject in the field of energy chemical industry and environmental protection although the methane production rate was too low to be applied in the actual industry at the moment. This material design approach opens numerous paths for creating highly efficient photocatalyst systems.
