    , Accepted 29th May 2013First published on 29th May 2013AbstractA novel near-infrared (NIR) photocatalyst of Er3+/Yb3+-(CaF2@TiO2) was synthesized with optically active centers (Er3+/Yb3+) presented both in the CaF2 cores and TiO2 shells, and the corresponding upconversion luminescence properties increased greatly, which was helpful for the organic dye solution removal efficiency under NIR irradiation.
Upconversion photocatalysts of rare-earth doped TiO2 have attracted considerable attention due to their successive absorption of low-energy photons to the subsequent emission of photons with higher energy.1–3 With the aid of Er:Y3Al5O12,4–7 Er3+,8 Er3+/Yb3+,9 and Tm3+/Yb3+,10 TiO2 matrices could harvest not only the ultraviolet (UV) and visible light, but also the near-infrared (NIR) light. Thus, these upconversion photocatalysts will improve the utilization of the solar energy greatly, compared to the conventional TiO2 photocatalysts.11–13 To minimize non-radiative loss and maximize the radiative emission, the host materials in the photocatalysts should be presented as low lattice photon energies for the upconversion luminescence properties.14,15 Usually, TiO2 has high photon energies, and a chemical compound of low photon energy should be combined with TiO2 to improve the upconversion performance from a practical perspective.
Fluorides have been proved to be promising upconversion luminescence agents, and some rare-earth doped fluoride compounds, i.e., Tm3+/Yb3+–YF3,16–18 Er3+/Yb3+–LaF3,19 and Er3+/Yb3+–NaYF420–22 have been reported in the synthesis of TiO2 photocatalysts to increase the NIR light harvesting. Both the Er3+ and Tm3+ ions have rich energy level structures with equally spatial long-lived metastable 4f states, and the Yb3+ ions are excellent sensitizers to harvest the pump light and then transfer energy to Er3+ or Tm3+ ions to produce shorter wavelength light than that of the pump light.15,23,24 Currently, the NIR-driven photocatalytic activity based on rare earth doped fluorides combined with TiO2 mainly focused on the Tm3+ ions.16–18 To the best of our knowledge, limited work was reported on Er3+ ions for NIR-driven photocatalysts, and Er3+/Yb3+ ions might be promising additives, since Er3+ ions could generate violet and some weak UV emissions with over a wide range of 375–392 nm.25,26
Meanwhile, a cost-efficient host material with low photon energy is necessary for the development of NIR-driven photocatalysts, and calcium fluoride (CaF2) is non-toxic, stable, nonhygroscopic and abundant, and could be used as the host material.27–30 It has been proved that Er3+/Yb3+ codoped CaF2 could produce strong upconversion fluorescence.31–34 Generally, the hexagonal phase of NaYF4 is the most efficient host material for upconversion luminescence,35–37 while CaF2 was proved to produce stronger upconversion emission if the crystal size was below 10 nm.33 Up to now, there are few reports that focus on the synthesis of photocatalysts for the TiO2–CaF2 system, and it is important to assess the potential photocatalytic activity for Yb3+/Er3+ codoped CaF2 combined with TiO2 under NIR irradiation.
The shape, size, and components of nanoparticles would vary the upconversion luminescence properties, and core–shell architectures are one of the best options to improve luminescence efficiency due to the protection of shells from non-radiative decay caused by surface defects.15,38 Usually, the shells of nanoparticles were inert and their sole role was to protect the active cores. The active core/active shell nanoparticles might be an attractive means for the improvement of the upconversion properties, since a remarkable enhancement of fluorescence has been reported, compared to the active core/inert shell nanoparticles.39–41 Although some NIR photocatalysts, i.e., Tm3+/Yb3+–YF3@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles were synthesized,16,18 the TiO2 shells fail to contain optically active centers and the intensity of upconversion luminescence was limited.
In this work, a novel photocatalyst of Yb3+/Er3+ codoped (CaF2@TiO2) with active centers (Yb3+/Er3+) existing both in the cores and shells was prepared via a facile and single-step hydrothermal method. The Er3+/Yb3+ and Ca2+ ions were introduced to a titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) aqueous solution, and the Er3+/Yb3+ codoped CaF2 particles (cores) were directly formed with the addition of HF. Following the hydrothermal synthesis process, the residual Er3+/Yb3+ ions codoping the TiO2 shells surrounding the cores were obtained (Fig. 1). The structure and upconversion properties of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) were studied, and the photocatalytic performance was evaluated by the decomposition of organic dyes in simulated wastewater under NIR irradiation.

The composition of outmost layers of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) nanoparticles was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. 2. The survey scan (Fig. 2a) revealed that the elements of Ti, O, Yb, Ca, F, Er, and adventitious C were present in the surface of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2). In Fig. 2b, the binding energies of Er 4d5/2 and Yb 4d5/2 were observed at 169.1 and 185.3 eV, respectively.3 Two peaks of Ti 2p appeared at 458.2 and 464.1 eV and corresponded to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 (Fig. 2c), respectively.42 The XPS peak of Ca 2p located at 348.9 eV should be attributed to Ca 2p1/2.43 According to the XPS result of Ti:Ca:Yb:Er real atomic ratio (Table S1 in ESI†), Ti was the predominant element in the surface of the nanoparticles, and the Ca content (Ti:Ca = 1:0.065) was much lower than the nominal content (Ti:Ca = 1:0.3) due to the core (CaF2)/shell (TiO2) structure and the limited detection depth of XPS.44 Especially, the real atomic ratio of Ti:Yb:Er (1:0.092:0.005) was remarkably different from the nominal atomic ratio (1:0.2:0.02), indicating that some of the active centers (Er3+/Yb3+) were located in the CaF2 cores, except the dispersion in the TiO2 shells.

The XRD patterns of pure TiO2, Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2, CaF2@TiO2, and Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) are shown in Fig. 3. The diffraction peaks of pure TiO2 were characteristic of anatase and rutile phases (Fig. 3a). After doping with Er3+/Yb3+ ions, the rutile phase disappeared, and the diffraction peaks of anatase phase became broader compared to that of pure TiO2 (Fig. 3b). As a metastable phase, the anatase phase in TiO2 could be transformed into rutile easily, while the impurities (Er3+/Yb3+) would increase the temperature of the anatase–rutile transformation, as the formation of Ti–O–Er or Ti–O–Yb bonds.9,20 With the addition of CaF2, the diffraction peaks of anatase phase in CaF2@TiO2 were narrow and sharp due to the generation of a high crystallinity (Fig. 3c), while the diffraction peaks of anatase decreased after coupling with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions (Fig. 3d). The crystal phases of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) mainly consisted of anatase and (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2, and the diffraction peaks of anatase were mainly located at about 2θ = 25.42°, 37.98°, 55.30°, which matched very well with the (101), (004), (211) crystal faces of anatase TiO2 (PDF card 21-1272, JCPDS). For (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2, the diffraction peaks were predominantly located at about 2θ = 28.06°, 32.52°, 46.62°, 57.98°, which could be perfectly indexed to the (111), (200), (220), (222) crystal faces of CaF2 (PDF card 87-0976, JCPDS),33 and they were in good accordance with the XRD results of Er3+/Yb3+–CaF2 (Fig. S1 in ESI†). For the (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2 phase, it was determined that the Yb3+ ions took the place of Ca2+ in the CaF2 lattice,45 and the corresponding cell parameters were distorted from 5.470 to 5.482 (Table S2 in ESI†) because of the difference between the ionic radius of Yb3+ (0.86 Å) and Ca2+ (0.995 Å).
 Fig. 3  Typical XRD patterns of pure TiO2 (a), Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2 (b), CaF2@TiO2 (c), and Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) (d). 
The crystal sizes of TiO2 in pure TiO2, Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2, CaF2@TiO2, and Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) were 12.3, 8.5, 17.1, and 9.5 nm, according to the XRD analysis, respectively, which were also consistent with the results of the SEM and TEM in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). The doped Er3+ and Yb3+ ions inhibited the growth of crystal grains of TiO2, and it was due to the presence of the Ti–O–Er or Ti–O–Yb bonds on the surface of TiO2, the different ionic radius between Er3+, Yb3+ (0.89 or 0.86 Å) and Ti4+ (0.68 Å), and the well dispersed lanthanide oxide.46–48 In contrast, a high crystallization degree of the anatase phase and the largest particle size were found with the formation of CaF2 (Fig. 3c and Fig. S2c and S3c†).
The morphologies of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) particles were investigated by SEM and TEM. An overall morphology of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) particles is shown in Fig. 4a, and it can be seen that there existed many spherical particles with the average particle size of 190 nm (Fig. 4b). The elements, i.e. Ti, O, Ca, Yb, F, and Er, were found in Er3+/Yb3+-(CaF2@TiO2) particles according to the EDS spectrum (Fig. S4 in ESI†), and the real atomic ratio (Ti4+:Ca2+:Yb3+:Er3+ = 1:0.214:0.158:0.016) was close to the nominal atomic ratio (Ti4+:Ca2+:Yb3+:Er3+ = 1:0.3:0.2:0.02) in Table S1 (ESI†), indicating CaF2 (or (Ca0.8Yb0.2)F2) and TiO2 particles were included. In addition, the differences between the EDS and XPS analysis were due to the different detection depths.49 The CaF2 particles were further observed in TEM images (Fig. 2c) with near-square shape, and the corresponding particle size was around 150 nm, larger than that of Er3+/Yb3+–CaF2 particles (90 nm) in Fig. S5 (ESI†), while it was smaller than that of CaF2 particles (200 nm) after annealing.34

The surfaces of CaF2 particles were coated by porous TiO2 shells (Fig. 2d) with the thickness varying from 10 nm to 50 nm, and NIR light can easily penetrate into the CaF2 cores to produce strong upconversion emissions.16 The measured lattice spaces of TiO2 were 0.35 and 0.24 nm (Fig. 4e), with the corresponding distances of the (101) and (004) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively. The BET specific surface areas of pure TiO2, Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2, CaF2@TiO2, and Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) were determined to be around 59.24, 121.41, 27.44, and 57.04 m2 g−1 (Table S2 in ESI†), and the low surface area of CaF2@TiO2 was due to the large size of TiO2 and CaF2. The surface area of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) was almost the same as pure TiO2, because the introduction of Er3+/Yb3+ ions resulted in the fine particles of anatase.
The ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectra of pure TiO2, Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2, CaF2@TiO2, and Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. S6† shows the plots of (ahν)1/2versus photon energy (hν) from the spectral data, and the corresponding band gap energies and absorption edge wavelengths are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). Pure TiO2 and CaF2@TiO2 presented sharp absorption edges at about 438 nm (Eg ∼ 2.83 eV) and 431 nm (Eg ∼ 2.88 eV), respectively, indicating that CaF2 had a slight influence on the absorption edge of TiO2, and the same result was found in TiO2 modified with CaF2 as well.50 However, after doping with Er3+/Yb3+ ions, the absorption edge transitions had been already blue shifted to 420 nm (Eg ∼ 2.95 eV) of Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2 and 425 nm (Eg ∼ 2.92 eV) for Er3+/Yb3+–CaF2@TiO2 because of the small size effect and clusters of nanoparticles.9 Furthermore, there existed some absorption peaks located at about 479, 521, 652, 798, and 974 nm, which corresponded to 4F7/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, 4I9/2 → 4I15/2, and 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively. The 974 nm absorption was also attributed to the transitions of 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 of Yb3+ ion.10

The upconversion luminescence spectra of Er3+/Yb3+–CaF2, Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2, and Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) nanoparticles under an excitation wavelength of 980 nm are shown in Fig. 6. As shown in the upconversion luminescence spectrum of Er3+/Yb3+–CaF2, the violet emission peak at about 408 nm was due to the 2H9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions. In particular, a weak UV emission peak was found at about 379 nm, which was produced by the 2G11/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions.25 After combining with TiO2, the violet and UV emissions were very weak, since they were absorbed by TiO2 shells.10,16,18 It should be pointed out that the upconversion luminescence spectrum of Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2 was too weak to be observed due to the concentration quenching (Fig. S7 in ESI†).14 However, the quenching effect decreased greatly as the introduction of CaF2 in Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) increased, since the efficient host lattices of CaF2 with low photon energy led to strong upconversion emissions. It was also confirmed that the active centers (Yb3+/Er3+) existed both in CaF2 cores and TiO2 shells.

The NIR-driven photocatalytic performances of the samples were evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solutions (Fig. 7). The absorption peaks at 664 nm (MB) were monitored after the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The C/C0 conversion plots of MB decreased steadily under NIR irradiation with the Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) catalyst as the reaction time extended (Fig. 7a), while no change occurred with the catalysts of pure TiO2 and CaF2@TiO2. For the system with the catalyst of Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2, the concentration of MB decreased slightly, and the removal rate was 1.22 × 10−2 mg L−1 h−1, nearly four times lower than that of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) (4.96 × 10−2 mg L−1 h−1).

To further identify the photocatalytic activity of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) under NIR (Fig. 7b) and UV-vis-NIR irradiation (Fig. S8 in ESI†), methyl orange (MO) was selected for degradation because it was more stable in the UV light compared to MB. Fig. S8a† shows the absorbance of MO at 464 nm gradually decreased with the UV-vis-NIR irradiation over Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2). The C/C0 conversion plots for MO degradation (Fig. S8b†) obviously showed that MO was very stable in the absence of photocatalysts, but it can be decomposed by pure TiO2, CaF2@TiO2 and Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2 with the corresponding average removal rates of 2.19 × 10−3, 1.91 × 10−3 and 2.02 × 10−3 mg L−1 min−1, respectively. Moreover, a small removal rate (0.76 × 10−2 mg L−1 h−1) of MO under NIR light in the Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2 system was also found (Fig. 7b). The MO decomposition by UV light will be the predominant means under UV-vis-NIR irradiation, since pure TiO2 could be more efficient at MO degradation under UV light, which resulted in a better photocatalytic activity compared to the same mass of CaF2@TiO2 and Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2. An exciting phenomenon was observed in the Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) system, where more UV-vis-NIR light energy could be used, higher decomposition efficiencies of MO were observed under NIR (2.67 × 10−2 mg L−1 h−1, Fig. 7b) and UV-vis-NIR irradiation (2.64 × 10−3 mg L−1 min−1, Fig. S8†), compared to the same mass in the pure TiO2 system.
On the basis of the presented experimental results, it could be found that the photocatalyst of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) was able to decompose MB and MO under NIR irradiation (Fig. 7), and a higher removal efficiency was observed, compared to pure TiO2, Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2 and CaF2@TiO2. Furthermore, the Er3+/Yb3+–CaF2 had no photocatalytic function to MB and MO, and thus the experimental data are not shown here. The stability of the photocatalysts is an important factor in practical applications. The particle sizes of Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2 and Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) were unchanged before and after photocatalytic degradation of MB, as shown in Fig. S9 and Fig. S2b and d, ESI† and Fig. 4a and b). Moreover, the Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) photocatalyst was recycled for four times in the degradation of MO under the same operational conditions (Fig. S10 in ESI†), and it still exhibited high photoactivity. The core/shell structure of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) was also maintained after decomposing MB and MO (Fig. S9c and S11 in ESI†), indicating the photocatalyst of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) had a good stability property.
The energy transfer mechanism of NIR-driven photocatalytic degradation in the presence of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) was proposed, as shown in Fig. 8. The absorption band of Yb3+ ion was located at around 980 nm due to the 2F7/2 → 2I5/2 transition, and it was well resonant with the f–f transition of Er3+ ions. Thus, the NIR light could transfer energy from Yb3+ ions to Er3+ ions efficiently, and then the violet and UV emissions were produced by Er3+ ions through excited-state absorption and energy-transfer upconversion.51 According to the absorption edges of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) (425 nm) and Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2 (420 nm), the upconversion emissions of the violet (408 nm) and UV lights (379 nm) could excite the electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. Therefore, the strongly oxidative holes (h+) and reductive electrons (e−) were generated to decompose MB and MO. The Er3+ ions could also be reduced to Er2+ by trapping an electron under UV excitation, and thus the Er2+ species would react with O2 and induce charge carrier separation,8 inhibiting the recombination of electrons and holes. Meanwhile, the mixed CaF2 phases and Er3+/Yb3+ ions could generate more crystal defects and oxygen vacancies to capture more photoelectrons than other samples, and reduced the recombination with photoinduced holes effectively,9,47 which ultimately enhanced the MB and MO removal rates.

In conclusion, a novel NIR photocatalyst of Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) with active core/active shell structure, was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The effects of Er3+/Yb3+ ions and CaF2 on the phase structures and morphologies of the resulting photocatalysts showed that Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) was suitable to harvest the NIR photons. As the upconversion photocatalyst, Er3+/Yb3+–(CaF2@TiO2) had higher photocatalytic activity in decomposing MB and MO, compared to pure TiO2, Er3+/Yb3+–TiO2, and CaF2@TiO2 under NIR irradiation.
