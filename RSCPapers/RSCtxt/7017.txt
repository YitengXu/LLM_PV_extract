ChinaReceived 28th March 2013, Accepted 25th April 2013First published on 26th April 2013AbstractThree new small organic molecules, I, II and III, consisting of dithienosilole as the central core, bithiophene bridge with different alkyl group substituents, and octyl cyanoacetate or dicyano unit as different end units, have been designed and synthesized. The thermal, optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these three compounds have been investigated. The solubility, absorption, energy levels and band gaps of these materials were effectively tuned by different alkyl groups substituted on the thiophene unit and/or different electron-withdrawing end groups. Bulk heterojunction solar cells with molecules I–III as electron donors and PC60BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester) as an election acceptor exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 3.27, 2.88 and 3.81% for I, II and III, respectively. All of these solar cells showed very high Voc values of 0.89–0.92 V, and the high Voc is consistent with the low-lying HOMO level of the donor. These compounds also have low LUMO levels which ensure effective charge transfer from the donor to the fullerene acceptor. The structure–photovoltaic property relationships of these donor materials were investigated and discussed.IntroductionOrganic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn great interest over the past decade since they possess unique advantages such as low cost, light-weight and good mechanical flexibility.1–12 To date, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer-based OSCs has exceeded 9%.13–19 Meanwhile, solution-processed small molecule bulk heterojunction OSCs (SM-BHJ-OSCs) are emerging as a competitive alternative to their polymer counterparts. Compared to polymers, small molecular semiconductors possess several intrinsic advantages of well-defined structure in nature, good synthetic reproducibility, alleviated batch-to-batch variation and easier band structure control.20–25 In the past few years, the efficiencies of SM-BHJ-OSCs have been improved greatly, and 7–8% of PCE have been achieved by several research groups.26–34 However, to attain efficiencies approaching or even higher than 10% in SM-BHJ-OSCs, much effort is still required to develop new materials and understand the relationship between chemical structures of the materials and device performance factors such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). The fundamental electronic interactions and morphology between the donor and the fullerene acceptor are also very important for high efficiency of the devices.Push–pull chromophores involving electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups have been widely investigated for OSC molecules.35 By combining an appropriate electron acceptor group, it is easy to realize low bandgap materials with extended spectral absorption toward longer wavelengths,5 and at the same time, the HOMO and LUMO levels can be tuned effectively.36,37 In addition, in the field of organic electronic materials, the choice of solubilizing substituent group and the position of attachment is gaining growing attention.38–40 Careful molecular design, control of the position as well as electron density of alkyl side/end chains, would not only increase the solubility of the donor materials in organic solvents for spin-casting but also improve their packing structure and solid-state miscibility with fullerenes.38,39 This can ultimately be reflected by the changes in the efficiency of the device.Alkylated dithienosilole unit is a well known chemical skeleton for developing efficient OSCs.34,41 It has good chemical stability and a highly planar structure which could lead to high charge-carrier mobility; the solubility of the material is easy to adjust by changing the alkyl group which will result in good solution processing ability and hence film quality; another important property of dithienosilole lies in its good electron donor function. With the factors mentioned above, we designed and synthesized three novel small organic molecules with an A–D–A (D = donor, A = acceptor) structure, namely, I, II and III (Fig. 1). Here, alkylated dithienosilole unit was chosen as the donor, electron-withdrawing alkyl cyanoacetate moiety and dicyano group serve as the electron acceptor at the terminal ends. The additional methyl and hexyl groups were attached to the thiophene units to improve the solubility and film morphology. This design strategy indeed efficiently lowers the HOMO level which is desirable for obtaining high Voc. Meanwhile, the molecules can exhibit wide absorption profiles owing to the effective conjugation in the backbone and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the terminal acceptor units and the central donor building block. By using the simple solution spin-coating, the highest PCE of 3.81% was obtained by using a blend of III and PC60BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester) as the active layer, accompanied by a high Voc of 0.92 V. Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the target molecules I, II and III. ExperimentalMaterials and characterizationAll reactions were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere with the use of standard Schlenk techniques. Solvents for the chemical syntheses were dried and distilled from appropriate drying agents prior to use. All reactants and reagents were commercially available and used as received, unless otherwise noted. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer. Elemental analyses were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Analyzer. Absorption spectra were obtained on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. DSC was determined using a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond DSC instrument with about 5 mg of the sample at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range of 0 to 300 °C or 0 to 200 °C. TGA was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond TG instrument under purified nitrogen gas flow with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. AFM was performed on a Veeco Dimension 3100 V atomic force microscope in the tapping mode. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed using Metrohm instrument model PGSTAT302N in a standard three-electrode, one compartment configuration equipped with Ag/AgCl electrode, Pt wire and glassy carbon electrode (diameter of 3 mm), as the pseudo reference, counter electrode and working electrode, respectively. Glassy carbon electrodes were polished with alumina prior to use. The CV experiments were performed in anhydrous dichloromethane solution with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte at the scan rate of 100 mV s−1 unless otherwise stated. All electrochemical solutions were purged with dry Ar for 15 min to deoxygenate the system. Solution CV measurements were carried out with a sample concentration of ∼1 mg mL−1 in CH2Cl2. Ferrocene was used as the internal standard, assuming Fc/Fc+ to be −4.8 eV versus vacuum and Fc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.42 eV with respect to SCE.Device fabricationThe photovoltaic devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/I or II or III:PC60BM/Ca/Al (PEDOT:PSS = poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid)) were prepared. The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol under ultrasonication for 15 min each and subsequently dried by a nitrogen blow. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP AI 4083, filtered at 0.22 μm) was spin-coated (4000 rpm, ca. 40 nm thick) onto the ITO surface. After being baked at 140 °C for 10 min, the substrates were transferred into an argon-filled glove box. Subsequently, the active layer was spin-casted from a blend ratio (weight-to-weight) of donor (8 mg mL−1) and PC60BM (1:0.8, w/w) in chloroform solution on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate without further special treatments. Finally, a 20 nm Ca layer and a 100 nm Al layer were deposited on the active layer under high vacuum (<3 × 10−4 Pa). The effective areas as defined by the masks for all OSC devices discussed in this work were 4–6 mm2 for I–III. The current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured under the illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2. The measurement of external quantum efficiency (EQE) was performed using an IQE200TM data acquisition system.Synthesis2,2′-Dibromo-4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole was purchased from Solarmer Energy Inc. and used as received.

The intermediate 4 was synthesized through the Stille coupling reaction between 3 and each of 2a–c using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst for 24 h. Compounds I and II were obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation of intermediates (4a and 4b) with octyl cyanoacetate,46 whereas III was prepared by a similar condensation of 4c with malononitrile.47 The chemical structures of the products I–III were verified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses. The complete disappearance of the aldehyde proton signals at 9.85 ppm for 4a, 9.97 ppm for 4b and 9.98 ppm for 4c, and the appearance of olefinic proton signals at 8.24 ppm for I, 8.38 ppm for II and 7.80 ppm for III confirm the efficient conversion of the aldehyde and the successful preparation of the target products. I and II exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents, such as CHCl3 and toluene at room temperature, while III possesses good solubility in CHCl3 at 50 °C. Molecule III with a dicyano electron-accepting end group has a lower solubility as compared to I and II having the octyl cyanoacetate terminal entity.Thermal propertiesThe thermal properties of the target products were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. As shown in Fig. 2, the TGA curves reveal that the decomposition temperatures with 5% weight-loss (Td) of I, II and III are 366, 352 and 389 °C, respectively. The good thermal stability of the products is adequately suitable for OSC fabrication and evaluation. Fig. 3 shows the DSC results of I–III, in which the melting temperatures of I, II and III are 182, 160 and 166 °C, respectively, and their respective crystallizing temperatures are 169, 86 and 134 °C. By comparing I with II, we note that the introduction of a methyl substituent on the bithiophene bridge lowers the melting point. Compound I possesses significantly higher melting and crystallizing temperatures relative to II and III, which is likely a result of the more planar structure; this can lead to stronger intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid state. The thermal data of the materials are summarized in Table 1.

In solution, the absorption peaks at the high energy region (369 nm for I, 391 nm for II and 392 nm for III) correspond to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone,2,33 whereas the lower energy absorption band of them peaking at 531, 542 and 550 nm with the molar extinction coefficient of 6.4, 6.8 and 6.1 M−1 cm−1 for I, II and III, respectively, can be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition.46 In comparison to their absorption in solution, the absorption spectra of the films are broadened and peaks are markedly red-shifted. Their absorption peaks as thin films (568, 591 and 603 nm for I, II and III, respectively) are bathochromically shifted by 37, 49 and 53 nm for I, II and III, respectively, relative to that in solution, thereby extending the absorption edge to 674, 709 and 721 nm in the solid state. This phenomenon results from the enhanced interchain interaction in the solid films, which is related to the increased extent of π–π stacking of the molecular backbone.48 The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of I, II and III as calculated from the onset of the thin film absorption are estimated to be 1.84, 1.75 and 1.72 eV, respectively. The results clearly indicate that the optical properties of these materials could be tuned by changing the substituent group in the conjugated backbone (on the thiophene donor or cyano acceptor).

Electrochemical propertiesCyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to study the electrochemical properties of the molecules49 and the energy levels (HUMO and LUMO) were calculated from the onset of the oxidation and reduction potentials by assuming the energy level of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) to be −4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The formal potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured as 0.40 V against Ag/Ag+. The electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 5 displays the CV curves of I–III in dichloromethane solutions of 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The onset oxidation and reduction potentials (versus Fc/Fc+) are 0.37 and −1.43 V, 0.28 and −1.49 V, 0.32 and −1.35 V for I, II and III, respectively. The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energies were estimated to be −5.17 and −3.37 eV, −5.08 and −3.31 eV, −5.12 and −3.45 eV for I, II and III, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps of I, II and III are 1.80, 1.77 and 1.67 eV, respectively, which are well consistent with the optical band gaps. As compared with the HOMO (−6.0 eV) and LUMO (−4.2 eV) energy levels for PCBM,10 our compounds are suitable candidates as donor materials in OSCs when blended with the PCBM acceptor. Notably, I–III present fairly low-lying HOMO levels, which guaranteed high Voc of the OSCs when blended with PC60BM, because the Voc is proportional to the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor.50,51 Since the cyano group has a stronger electron-withdrawing ability than octyl cyanoacetate, the LUMO level of III is the lowest among I–III. Also, compounds I–III have their LUMO levels higher than the PCBM level, making the photoinduced charge transfer and charge separation possible at the interface between the donor and acceptor functions because a donor material intended for use with a fullerene acceptor should have a LUMO offset of approximately 0.3–0.4 eV relative to the fullerene acceptor for effective charge transfer. For I and II, our results indicate that introduction of the alkyl substituent groups on the bithiophene ring will clearly decrease the band gap owing to the increase of electron density on the donor part. On the other hand, an enhancement of the electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor group in III affords the lowest Eg in III and the largest Jsc in its OSC device. The lower band gap in III will lead to a better light absorption which will result in higher Jsc. Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms of I (square), II (triangle) and III (pentagram) in a dichloromethane solution of 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Photovoltaic propertiesThe photovoltaic properties of I–III were investigated with the bulk heterojunction architectures using PC60BM as the electron acceptor material. The devices were fabricated through the conventional solution spin-coating process with the structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/I or II or III:PC60BM/Ca/Al. The detailed device fabrication process is described in the Experimental section. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 6 and the key device parameters are listed in Table 2. All the devices yielded relatively high Voc values (0.89–0.92 V) which are consistent with the low-lying HOMOs. It was shown that the OSC with the donor molecule III showed the best PCE of 3.81% under the illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2. However, it exhibited the lowest FF, suggesting its poorer charge-transport properties as compared to I and II. The devices with the donor materials I and II gave lower but still respectable PCEs at 3.27% and 2.88% respectively, together with significantly lower Jsc. The lower Jsc is likely related to changes in the absorption features and elevation of the Eg by judicious structural modifications of the dyes. In comparison to I, the PCE of the OSC based on II is lower, despite the fact that the absorption spectrum of II is better than I. This is because the introduction of methyl groups to the A–D–A structure lowered the band gap and improved its solar light absorption ability, but such substitution would also elevate the HOMO of the materials simultaneously. The differences in the resulting optical and electrical properties will cause a change of the device performance parameters. The Jsc was improved but the Voc and FF were decreased, therefore, the PCE decreased from 3.3% to 2.9% after methyl group substitution. The decrease of PCE is mainly ascribed to the lower FF since the value of Voc × Jsc is almost the same for the OSCs fabricated from I and II, which suggests that methyl group substitution mainly tends to affect the blend film morphology. In addition, the effect of thermal annealing showed different performance on the blends of I–III. For I, the best device results were obtained with no thermal annealing but both II and III displayed much better efficiency after thermal annealing. It is considered that molecules of I with no alkyl group substitution on the thiophene unit can stack more easily even without thermal treatment. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the BHJ devices based on I–III under monochromatic light are shown in Fig. 7. The curves exhibited a broad spectral response covering 300–800 nm, with monochromatic EQE maximum of 27, 26 and 32% for I, II and III, respectively. The integration through the whole EQE curve has been carried out to give a Jsc of 6.39, 6.34 and 7.78 mA cm−2 for I, II and III, respectively, which is in agreement with the photocurrent obtained by the J–V measurements (within 10% error).

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 8) was used to investigate the morphology of the blend films (1:0.8, w/w) of I–III/PC60BM spin-coated from chloroform solutions. As shown in the AFM images, different morphologies appear upon variation of the substituent groups in the donor molecules. The root mean square (rms) roughness values of the blend films are 6.98 nm, 2.83 nm and 8.43 nm for I/PC60BM, II/PC60BM and III/PC60BM films, respectively. The III/PC60BM film is rougher than I/PC60BM and II/PC60BM films, which is related to the relatively lower solubility of III in chloroform. The rough surface can effectively reduce the charge-transport distance.9,12,52,53 Rough film morphology combined with the good optical absorption can account for the better photovoltaic performance for III/PC60BM (1:0.8, w/w). The phase images show information about the donor and acceptor distribution and interpenetrating network structure. These AFM results show that these donor materials are compatible with PC60BM molecules in the blend films, and formed donor–acceptor interpenetrating networks.

ConclusionsIn summary, three new dithienosilole-containing organic molecules, I–III, with the A–D–A framework in the main chain were synthesized. They have good solution processability and thermal stability, broad and strong absorption features, appropriate energy levels that are in good agreement with PC60BM. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of I–III can be effectively tuned by chemical means. The best PCE of the OSCs based on III can reach up to 3.81%. The broad absorption spectrum and deep HOMO level of III contribute to the outstanding Jsc and Voc. We envision that it is important to adjust the size, length and position of the alkyl groups at various attachment points of the molecule so that the optical absorption, energy level and blend film morphology can achieve a good balance for the optimal device performance. Work is still underway to elucidate these factors in detail.AcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51273208, 20974091 and 50803051), the Hundred Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Starting Research Fund of Team Talent (Y10801RA01) in NIMTE and the Ningbo Natural Science Foundation of China (2012A610114), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province of China (no. 10JJ1002), the Foundation of the Hunan Provincial Education Department (10B107) and the Undergraduate Innovation Experiment Plan in the Xiangtan University.
