    , Accepted 28th September 2015First published on 30th September 2015AbstractMetal sulfide counter electrodes comprising NiS nanosphere thin films were deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate with different concentrations of urea. The electrodes were used as counter electrodes (CE) in solar cells. The surface morphology of the NiS thin film is greatly affected by the addition of urea, which increases the rate of thioacetamide decomposition and thus the sulfur concentration. Field emission scanning electron microscopy observes that NiS mostly exhibits a nanosphere morphology, which facilitates charge carrier transfer from their surface to redox electrolyte. In the present study, the size of the NiS nanosphere depends on the concentration of urea. Under simulated solar light irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5), the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) based on the NiS CE achieves a power conversion efficiency of 5.75%, which is higher than the solar cell based on platinum (Pt) CE (5.28%). The improved photovoltaic performance of the NiS-based DSSC may be attributed to a low charge transfer resistance (33.01 Ω) for the reduction of redox couple (I−/I3−) on the CE, indicating greater electrocatalytic activity of the NiS. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements demonstrate better catalytic activity of the NiS CE, which supports the rate of triiodide reduction to a level comparable to that of a Pt electrode. NiS CE could maintain the cell relatively high performance in the stability test in 10 h. The NiS CEs are believed to be a versatile candidate for further improvement of the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on the I−/I3− redox couple. The optimized NiS CE, when introduced to CdS/CdSe/ZnS quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells with a polysulfide electrolyte, exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 3.37%. The encouraging results show the potential for the utilization of the NiS CE in sensitized solar cells.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising photovoltaic devices due to their low cost, ease of fabrication, and competitive energy conversion efficiency (η).1–3 Recently, the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs has reached 13% under the illumination of one sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).4 Generally DSSCs consist of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode, an electrolyte containing a redox couple (I−/I3−) and a counter electrode (CE). The CE collects electrons from an external circuit and promotes the regeneration of iodine (I−) from triiodide (I3−). Therefore, a large electrical conductivity, a high specific surface area for the CE/electrolyte contact and a superior electrocatalytic activity for the reaction of redox couple are supposed to be preferred characteristics for the ideal CEs in DSSCs.5–7 In this scenario, platinum (Pt) is used as an efficient CE in DSSCs. Pt catalytic CEs with an I−/I3− redox electrolyte are widespread in DSSCs and show low charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface.1,8 Nevertheless, Pt is an expensive material that increases the cost of the fabricated solar cell, which poses problems for large-scale production.9 Further cost reduction through cheaper raw materials and simplifying the manufacturing procedure is one the main issues in the development of DSSCs. Hence, it is essential to find an alternative CE with comparable or superior electrochemical performance.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)10,11 with a high surface area and conductive polymers have been considered as alternative materials to Pt, but they showed inferior electrochemical performance.12 Recently, inorganic compounds such as metal sulfides,13–16 metal oxides,17,18 nitrides,19 and carbides,20 have been investigated to boost solar cell efficiency using simple fabrication processes. Among the metal sulfides, nickel sulfide (NiS) is a p-type semiconductor and has most efficient electrochemically active materials due to its variety of specialized applications, such as lithium ion batteries,21 super capacitors,22 photocatalytic H2 generation,23 and solar cells.24–26 NiS thin films have been prepared by SILAR,27 metal organic chemical vapor deposition,28 thermal evaporation,29 sputtering,30 spin coating,31 and chemical bath deposition (CBD).32 For instant, electrodeposited NiS CEs by using a periodic potential reversal technique to supersede Pt CEs of DSSCs and the corresponding optimized DSSCs achieved a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 6.25% and 6.82%, respectively.33,34 Recently, using a pulse potentiostatic method, a nano-coralline NiS deposited on the multi-wall carbon nanotubes exhibited a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 7.90%, which was higher than the DSSC based on the Pt CE (6.36%).35 However, the fabrication procedures of hierarchical structure were relatively complicated. Then the growth of the thin film on the substrate has been considered to be very simple. Therefore, CBD has emerged as the most common procedure for the deposition of metal chalcogenide, metal oxide and metal sulfide thin films and is currently attracting considerable attention owing to its relatively inexpensive, simple and convenient for large area deposition.36
We developed a new and simple fabrication method for the preparation of NiS thin films by CBD using urea as a reagent for NiS CEs. The urea increases the rate of thioacetamide (TAA) decomposition and thus the S2− concentration.37 The as-prepared NiS CEs were subjected to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to compare the Rct values for the NiS/I−/I3− and Pt/I−/I3− interfaces in DSSC systems. The DSSC based on as-prepared NiS CE at 0.8 M urea produces a power conversion efficiency of 5.75% versus 5.28% for the DSSC based on Pt CE under simulated solar light irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). This NiS CE is further introduced in CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs, which show a power conversion efficiency of 3.37% under 1 sun irradiation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and Tafel-polarization measurements were used to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the NiS and Pt CEs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of TiO2 photoanodes
FTO was used as a substrate for its electrical conductivity, ease of fabrication, and a resistance of 10 Ω sq−1. FTO glass was cleaned ultrasonically in the presence of acetone, ethanol, and DI water for 10 min each. Commercially available TiO2 paste with 20 nm particle size (Ti-NanoxideHT/SP, Solaronix) was coated onto the FTO substrate by a doctor blade method followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. Finally, the film thickness was obtained (7.5 μm) after solvent evaporation.38
2.2 Sensitization of photoelectrodes
To obtain N719 dye sensitized photoelectrodes, bare TiO2 electrodes were immersed into a dye bath for 24 h, allowing a saturated dye soak.
TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS films were synthesized by the SILAR method as follows: in brief, for CdS QDs, the TiO2 film was dipped into an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min and rinsed with DI water and ethanol. Then, it was dipped for 5 min in aqueous solution of 0.1 M Na2S and rinsed with DI water and ethanol after being dried using a drier (a cycle SILAR). The number of CdS QDs was increased by repeating the assembly cycles from 1 to 5. Second, TiO2/CdS was dipped into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min at room temperature, and rinsed with DI water. Then, samples were dipped into an aqueous solution of Na2SeSO3 for 5 min at 50 °C and rinsed again with DI water (a cycle SILAR). Repeat this process for 8 cycles. For the ZnS passivation layer, TiO2/CdS/CdSe films were alternately dipped into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min and a solution of 0.1 M Na2S for 5 min. They were then rinsed with DI water and dried using a drier (a total of 2 cycles).
2.3 Preparation of NiS and Pt CEs
NiS CEs were prepared by CBD method. First, FTO glass was cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, ethanol, and DI water for 10 min each. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 M NiSO4·6H2O and 0.4 M thioacetamide in 50 mL of distilled water as a solvent, and urea was used as a reagent for depositing the NiS thin film. After stirring for 60 min, the solution was transferred to a glass beaker. A cleaned substrate was placed horizontally in the glass beaker and kept at 80 °C for 2 hours in a hot air oven. The procedure was repeated for different concentrations of urea (0.4 M, 0.8 M, and 1.6 M). The NiS-coated films (an active area of ∼0.7 cm2) were washed several times with DI water and used for further characterization. The electrodes made with different amounts of urea are denoted as Electrode 1, Electrode 2, and Electrode 3, respectively. The preparation of NiS CE at different concentrations of urea using CBD is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the NiS CE manufacturing process at different concentrations of urea using CBD method. 
To fabricate the Pt electrode, cleaned FTO glass substrate was coated with Pt paste (Pt-catalyst T/SP, Solaronix) using the doctor blade method. The electrode was sintered at 450 °C for 10 min and had an active area of ∼0.7 cm2.
2.4 Cell fabrication of DSSCs and QDSSCs
The samples were removed from the dye after immersion overnight and sandwiched between the working electrode and CE. A 60 μm-thick hot-melt layer of Surlyn (Solaronix, Meltonix 1170-60) was used as a spacer between the electrodes and attached at 100 °C along with the iodide/triiodide electrolyte solution in between the layers. The CE holes on the FTO were covered using a sealant and cover glass and then soldered. The cells were left for a few hours for complete diffusion of the electrolyte within the photoanode and then tested under illumination at ∼100 mW cm−2.
QDSSC fabrication is as follows: the prepared photoanode and CEs were sealed using a sealant (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) at 100 °C. The space between the electrodes was filled with a polysulfide electrolyte consisting of sodium sulfide (1 M), sulfur (2 M), and potassium chloride (0.1 M) in a solution with a methanol-to-water ratio of 7:3.
2.5 Characterization of the thin films
The surface morphology, thickness and elemental compositions of the NiS thin films were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4200, Hitachi) equipped with on-system energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) operated at an operating voltage of 15 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a D8 ADVANCE with a DAVINCI (Bruker AXS) diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation and operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 with monochromatic Al-Kα radiation of 1486.6 eV and an electron take-off angle of 90°. The surface roughness of the NiS substrates was characterized using a atomic force microscope (JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK instruments, Berlin, Germany) with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode. The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using an OPTIZEN 3220UV spectrophotometer. The current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under one-sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator, which has an irradiance uniformity of ±3. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system in an argon-purged acetonitrile solution, which contained 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using a BioLogic electrochemical analyzer. Pt worked as a CE, and Ag/Ag+ worked as a reference electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization were performed using a symmetrical dummy cell fabricated with two identical CEs (NiS/electrolyte/NiS and Pt/electrolyte/Pt) under dark conditions using a BioLogicpotentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France); during characterization, the cells were covered with a black mask fitted around the active area of the cell. To test the stability, the NiS and Pt based DSSCs were continuously illuminated with AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 under working conditions, and the J–V curves were tested every 1 h in the course of 10 h.
3. Results and discussion
The morphology of the as-synthesized thin films was characterized by FESEM. Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the NiS thin films made using different deposition times. The FTO thickness is found to be approximately 496 nm in the present study. The thin film at 0.4 M of urea shows the surface morphology of nanospheres and the diameter of the nanospheres varied between the range of 39 to 91 nm and the film thickness is found to be 238 nm. However, the nanosphere sizes were increased when urea concentration was increased to 0.80 M and the nanosphere sizes varying between the range of 65–239 nm. With an increase in urea concentration from 0.4 to 0.8 M, the nanospheres combined to form larger particles of nanoporous structure and the thickness is measured to be 350 nm. The pores between the nanospheres are covered upon further increasing the urea concentration from 0.8 to 1.6 M and the thickness is found to be 554 nm. The pores in the film are blocked with urea concentration 1.6 M, implying that the electrolyte cannot well penetrate the CE. This means that the urea concentration changes the surface from nanospheres to nanospheres with pore blocking surface morphology. When the concentration of urea was increased beyond 1.6 M, the NiS started to peel off from the FTO substrate. We obtained good adhesion of the thin NiS layer deposited with 0.4 M to 1.6 M on the FTO substrate. The degree of adhesion of the electrocatalytic active materials on FTO is a crucial factor for determining the efficiency when the materials are used as CEs in DSSCs.39

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis was used to determine the elemental compositions of the films, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The EDX results confirmed the formation of NiS on the surface of the FTO substrate (the other peaks in Fig. 3 are Sn peaks due to background from the FTO substrate). The NiS CE at 0.4 M shows an atomic ratio of Ni to S of 53:47, indicating that Ni(II) ions form faster than the sulfur ions. In contrast, the formation of S is increased from 47% to 49% when the urea concentration is increased from 0.4 M to 0.8 M (Electrode 2). Upon increasing the urea concentration from 0.8 M to 1.6 M (Electrode 3), the TAA affects the sulfur formation more than the Ni formation, and the Ni is more depleted in the solution, resulting in greater sulfur content (54%). A significant reduction in nickel content was observed with the addition of urea. The crystallographic phase of the Electrode 2 film was investigated by XRD, and the pattern obtained is shown in Fig. 4. As shown, the Electrode 2 film has diffracted peaks of NiS at 30.1°, 33.7°, 45.9°, and 71.0° assigned to the [100], [002], [102], and [004] crystal planes of the hexagonal structure, respectively (JCPDS card No. 01-075-0613). The XRD results demonstrate that the NiS Electrode 2 film was prepared successfully.

XPS was then used to further analyze the chemical valence of the as-prepared Electrode 2 (0.8 M urea). Fig. 5a shows the presence of C, O, Ni and S were also detected in the spectrum, thus confirming the existence of NiS constituents on the surface analysis. The presence of C and O impurities in the sample is believed to be originated from the surface contamination in the atmosphere and also the residual surfactants absorbed on the products. Fig. 5b, c shows the high resolution scanning XPS spectra of Ni 2p and S 2p, respectively. The peaks at 854.1 and 871.6 eV are corresponded to the binding energies of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 5b).40 Two strong peaks at about 161.6 and 162.7 eV are attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 5c).41 Therefore, the XPS results suggest that the NiS is successfully deposited on the surface of FTO.

To study the surface roughness of NiS based Electrode 1, Electrode 2 and Electrode 3 films, high-resolution tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied, and the corresponding 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) images are shown in Fig. 6. The typical root-mean square roughness (Rrms) were observed to be 141.3, 177.2, and 129.2 nm for the NiS based Electrode 1, Electrode 2 and Electrode 3 electrodes, respectively. The values of Rrms of the 0.4 M and 0.8 M films (Electrode 1 and Electrode 2) are expected to be significantly higher than that of the 1.6 M film (Electrode 3). The roughest films offer more electro-catalytically active sites for the reaction of the redox couple in the electrolyte. The attractive performances of the Electrode 2 film as a catalyst on the CE in a DSSC were also confirmed from the results. First, the CE with the large superficial roughness would enhance its electrocatalytic activity for a triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) electrolyte system; second, the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface would be lower in the cases of Electrode 2 film based CEs, because they offer more electrocatalytic active sites for the reaction of the I3−/I− redox couple in the electrolyte.

The absorbance spectra of NiS thin films deposited with different concentrations of urea are shown in Fig. 7. The absorbance was reduced with increasing radiation wavelength. It is clear from the absorption graph that a higher concentration of urea results in higher absorbance (Electrode 3 > Electrode 2 > Electrode 1). The Electrode 1 thin film has an absorbance peak at a wavelength of 350 nm, while Electrode 2 and Electrode 3 have the highest absorbance at 350–550 nm and 450–550 nm. The higher absorption is due to the high thickness in the preparation of thin films.

Dye sensitized solar cells consisting of a TiO2–dye sensitizer, electrolyte and with NiS CEs were obtained using different concentrations of urea. A schematic diagram of the DSSC based on the NiS CEs is depicted in Fig. 8. The diameter of the particles increases with the urea concentration from 0.4 to 0.8 M, and further addition of urea blocking the pores between the nanospheres (0.8 to 1.6 M), based on the surface morphology of the NiS CEs (Fig. 2). It can be deduced from the surface morphologies that the nanosphere structured counter electrode thin films with particularly large surface can facilitate the charge transfer and accelerate the diffusion of electrolyte, which are the determining factors affecting the DSSC performance. Upon illumination of 1 sun (100 mW cm−2), photons are absorbed by the dye generating excitons and the electrons are driven toward the TiO2 conduction band and hole transfer into the electrolyte. The injected electron travels through the semiconductor network to arrive at the back contact and then through the load to the CE. At the CE, reduction of the oxidized redox system regenerates the reduced redox species. The NiS CE was used in conjunction with the I−/I3− electrolyte in DSSCs.

To investigate the electrocatalytic activities of the prepared NiS and Pt CEs, CV was performed in a three electrode system (Pt and SCE as counter and reference electrodes respectively) with an acetonitrile solution of 1 mM I2, 10 mM LiI, and 0.1 M LiClO4, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, and the results are shown in Fig. 9A. The NiS and Pt electrodes exhibit oxidation/reduction peaks, implying a high catalytic activity for the reduction of I3−. The relatively positive pair is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I2/I3−, whereas the negative pair is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3− according to the literature.42 The peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between the left pair was inversely correlated with the rate of the I3−/I− redox reaction. The peak current and Epp value were considered as two important parameters to determine the catalytic performances of different CEs. The NiS based Electrode 2 shows a lower Epp value and higher peak current than the Pt CE, which results in the higher electrocatalytic capability (Electrode 2 > Pt) toward the I3−/I− redox reduction for DSSCs.43 On the other hand, Electrode 1 and Electrode 3 exhibited the lower peak current than the Pt and Electrode 2, signifying that Electrode 1 and Electrode 3 have a poor catalytic activity. Therefore, the CV results indicate that the NiS electrode can effectively catalyze the reduction of I3− to I−. Fig. 9B and C shows the consecutive CV curves of the Electrode 2 and Pt electrodes. As can be seen in Fig. 9B, 50 CV curves coincide very well, indicating that our NiS-based Electrode 2 CE has good stability under practical working conditions. It can be seen that the NiS based Electrode 2 cathode (Fig. 9B) has a similar work stability to the Pt cathode (Fig. 9C). No obvious current density decline and peak shifts are observed after a 20-cycle test. It indicates that the NiS cathode has excellent electrochemical stability in the I−/I3− electrolyte solution.

To elucidate the role of the NiS CE in the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs, EIS analysis was carried out on the symmetrical cells under dark conditions, and the obtained Nyquist plot is shown in Fig. 10. The results are for the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 500 kHz, and the equivalent circuit used for fitting is also shown. The high-frequency region of the plot shows information about the series resistance (Rs) denoted by the nonzero intercept of the real axis. Rct at the CE/electrolyte interface, Warburg impedance (Zw), and the chemical capacitance (Cμ) parameters are obtained by fitting to an equivalent circuit.19,44

A smaller Rs value means that the catalytic material is more firmly attached to the FTO substrate. The Rs values of Electrodes 1 through 3 and the Pt CE were 7.7, 9.53, 10.28, and 8.94 Ω, respectively, denoting adhesion strength to the FTO substrate. Rs greatly affects the FF of the solar cells, with larger values resulting in lower FF. The Rct value of Electrode 2 was compared to that of the standard Pt electrode. The Rct values of Electrodes 1, 2, 3 and Pt CE were found to be 93.8, 33.01, 164.12, and 82.06 Ω, respectively. The power conversion efficiency also relies on the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. The low Rct suggests a high electron transfer rate at the interface between the electrolyte and the NiS or Pt CEs.45,46 The chemical capacitances (Cμ) of Electrode 2 (56.83 μF) is higher than the Pt (48.19 μF), Electrode 1 (44.08 μF) and Electrode 3 (23.98 μF), respectively. The higher Cμ corresponds to higher surface area and leads to better catalytic activity.17,19 The ZW values of Electrode 1, Electrode 2, Electrode 3 and Pt CE were found to be 6.4, 6.02, 9.3, and 6.11 Ω, respectively. The lower value of ZW shows better electrolyte diffusion, facilitates faster mass transport of electron and improves the performance of the DSSC by increasing the power conversion efficiency.
Tafel polarization measurement was used to investigate the electrochemical activity and the interfacial charge-transfer properties of the I−/I3− electrolyte redox couple on the surface of the NiS CEs. Fig. 11 shows the Tafel curves of the symmetrical cells obtained using the I−/I3− electrolyte and symmetrical cells as a function of the logarithmic current density vs. the applied potential. The exchange current density (J0) was obtained from the intercept value by extrapolating the linear region of the curve at zero over potential. In the Tafel curve, the anodic and cathodic branches of Electrode 2 shows a higher slope than that of Pt, Electrode 1 and Electrode 3, respectively. It can be suggested that J0 for Electrode 2 CE is higher than that for the NiS and Pt CEs and the Tafel equation:20 (1)where Rct is the charge transfer resistance calculated from the EIS measurement, R is the gas constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide to iodide, and F is Faraday's constant. J0 is inversely proportional to Rct.

The limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) can be derived from the horizontal part of the curve at high potential. Jlim is closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalyst.16 The value of the NiS Electrode 2 is higher than that of the Pt and other NiS electrodes, which induces a higher diffusion coefficient D: (2)where l is the electrolyte thickness, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of the I−/I3− electrolyte at the CE, F is the Faraday constant, and C is the electrolyte concentration. Jlim depends on the diffusion coefficient of the redox couple in the electrolyte. The Tafel polarization results are consistent with the EIS results.

Fig. 12 shows the photocurrent–voltage characteristics (J–V curve) of the DSSCs assembled with the TiO2/dye photoanode and Pt or NiS CEs under simulated one-sun illumination. The specific photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The Pt CE exhibited Voc, Jsc, FF, and η values of 0.629 V, 11.61 mA cm−2, 0.72, and 5.28%, respectively. Electrode 2 shows better results than Electrode 1 and Electrode 3. The values of Electrode 2 are 0.627 V, 12.72 mA cm−2, 0.72, and 5.75%, respectively. The series resistance of the Pt CE effects the FF of the solar cell, resulting in the higher FF obtained in the DSSCs. The low η values of Electrode 1 (4.48%) and Electrode 3 (4.05%) are due to the poor electrochemical activity in the presence of an iodine electrolyte. The parameter Jsc is increased with the urea concentration increasing from 0.4 M to 0.8 M (Electrode 1 to Electrode 2) and decreased thereafter. Electrode 2 shows higher efficiency than the Pt CE due to the strong adhesion of the material to the FTO glass and greater electrolytic activity. The better photovoltaic performance of the Electrode 2 is attributed to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity due to (i) improved surface morphology, and (ii) the increase in S at% which increased Ni vacancy with increased conductivity enabling better reduction of the I−/I3− electrolyte.

To obtain better insight into dynamics of the interfacial charge transfer process within the DSSCs, EIS was performed. Fig. 13 shows the Nyquist plots of the DSSCs based on NiS and Pt CEs. Z-view was used to characterize the impedance spectra based on an equivalent circuit consisting of two RC circuits with Warburg impedance (ZW), as shown in the inset of Fig. 13. A series resistance Rs is added to identify the sheet resistance of two identical electrodes. The charge-transfer resistance (RCE) at the counter electrode/electrolyte representing the electrocatalytic performance of the CE, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the photo electrode/electrolyte interface, ZW, and Cμ were directly obtained from the fit. Electrochemical parameters determined from EIS analysis are summarized in Table 1. These results show that the DSSC fabricated using Pt and NiS Electrode 2 CEs exhibited the smallest Rct (5.43 and 4.15 Ω) and highest Cμ (514.7 and 790.3 μF) indicating faster charge transport across the interface of photoanode/electrolyte. Moreover, high Cμ of Electrode 2 CE compared to other electrodes is mainly related to collection of more number of photo-exited electrons into the conduction band of photoanode due to low recombination. The high value of Rct at the interface of photoanode/electrolyte implies a decrease in the electron transfer rate resulting in poor efficiency. The RCE value of Pt (3.6 Ω) and NiS Electrode 2 (3.12 Ω) CEs were far less than that of other NiS CE prepared under other conditions of Electrode 1 (3.83 Ω) and Electrode 3 (3.86 Ω), suggesting an acceleration of a high electron transfer process at the interface of the CE/electrolyte. The lower values of Rct, RCE, and ZW of NiS Electrode 2 CE is higher than that of other electrodes, showing better electrocatalytic activity of the Electrode 2 CE for the reduction of the I−/I3− electrolyte.

Long-term stability is an important factor for device industrialization. The stability of DSSC based NiS (Electrode 2) and Pt CEs were investigated under continuous AM 1.5G illumination for 10 h. The photovoltaic parameters (Voc: open circuit voltage; Jsc: short-circuit photocurrent density; FF: fill factor; PCE: power conversion efficiency) of the NiS and Pt based DSSCs were measured every 1 h for 10 h. The change in photovoltaic parameters is presented in Fig. 14. After light soaking, the PCE of the solar cell significantly increases; this behaviour is related to the improved penetration of the electrolyte through the complete thickness of the electrode and the “activation” of the entire electrode. The PCE of the NiS increased from 5.75% to 5.88%, and the Pt CE showed a slight change in PCE from 5.28% to 5.00% in 10 h. There is a slight improvement of Voc (0.627 to 0.631 V) and almost equal Jsc (12.72 to 12.92 mA cm−2) and constant FF (0.721 to 0.720) were obtained in the course of 10 h illumination for NiS CE based DSSCs. Meanwhile, after 4 h, the Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of the Pt based DSSC begin to undergo a linear degradation of their performances. The photovoltaic parameters demonstrated that the nickel sulfide counter electrode had good stability compared to Pt. The high performances of the nickel sulfide CE result from the high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity as well as its rough surface and accessible inner surface for electrolyte filling.

In DSSCs, the optimized NiS at an urea concentration of 0.8 M (Electrode 2) acts as an efficient CE leading to improved photovoltaic performance. In this work, the maximized NiS CE has been put to the test with CdS/CdSe/ZnS and polysulfide electrolytes in QDSSCs. CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs were deposited on TiO2 films using the SILAR technique. QDSSC is fabricated by introducing the CdS/CdSe/ZnS-sensitized photoelectrode, the maximized NiS CE (Electrode 2), and the polysulfide electrolyte. The J–V characteristic of the cell is presented in Fig. 15. A power conversion efficiency of 3.37% was obtained from the best cell with a Voc of 0.582 V, a Jsc of 11.01 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.525. The nanoparticles in the NiS CE are obviously beneficial for the diffusion of the polysulfide electrolyte, which leads to the higher photovoltaic performance in QDSSCs. With a concerted effort, this NiS CE could therefore be better used in QDSSC cells, especially when QDs with a much wider absorption range than CdS/CdSe QDs are used.

4. Conclusion
NiS CEs were fabricated using a facile chemical bath deposition method and used without any heat treatment. The results show that the surface morphologies of the films were very dependent on the amount of urea. In addition to surface morphology, the increase in the atomic ratio of S in NiS played a vital role in increasing the electrocatalytic activity of the CE. Under simulated solar light irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5), the DSSC based on the optimal NiS CE achieves a power conversion efficiency of 5.75%, and this efficiency is superior to that of the DSSC assembled with Pt CE whose power conversion efficiency is 5.28%. In EIS studies of symmetrical cell, the NiS Electrode 2 CE revealed a low charge transfer resistance of 33.01 Ω for the I−/I3− electrolyte, which is lower than that obtained for the Pt CE (82.06 Ω). The lower value of Rct of our novel CE reflects the superior charge transfer and electrocatalytic activity at the electrolyte/CE interface, indicating that the CE material is effective for low-cost DSSCs. The DSSCs assembled with NiS CE showed quite high stability during 10 h than the Pt CE. These results may pave the way for further study of environmentally friendly, stable, highly efficient counter electrodes for highly efficient sensitized solar cells. The optimized NiS CE, when introduced into CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs, manifested a promising power conversion efficiency of 3.37%. Further improvements in conversion efficiencies could be achieved by controlling the thickness, morphology, and processing techniques.
