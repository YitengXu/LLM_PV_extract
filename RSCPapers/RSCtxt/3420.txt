    , Accepted 9th June 2016First published on 9th June 2016AbstractHierarchical porous architectures assembled by ultrathin mesoporous nanosheets are attractive for electrochemical energy storage. Herein, we present a facile and scalable strategy where two ultrathin mesoporous NiCoO2 sheets (∼2 nm) are anchored on both sides of a rGO sheet to form an ultrathin sandwich nanosheet (∼6 nm) using a chemical co-precipitation method. The sandwich nanosheets are randomly wrinkled, thus the framework built up by such sheets is porous and has a high specific surface area. The high quality rGO endows the composite with excellent conductivity. And the firm adhesion between the NiCoO2 sheet and flexible rGO also guarantees the integration of the electrode during electrochemical cycling. The electrochemical tests on the electrode made by such ultrathin sandwich nanosheets validate that the strategy is effective to obtain high performance electrodes for supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries. As an electrode of a lithium ion battery, it shows excellent cycling performance with a specific capacity close to 998 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1; and as an electrode of a supercapacitor, capacitance retention of 87.6% is achieved over 2000 cycles at a constant current density of 20 A g−1.
Introduction
Urgent issues about the scarcity of fossil fuels and simultaneous environmental pollution stimulate research into green and renewable energy technologies from solar, wind and so on.1 The intermittent character of renewables means that reliable electrical energy storage systems are needed for adapting these technologies to the demand in electricity. Supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are two prospective candidates for such systems.2,3 LIBs currently present high energy density but relatively low power density and poor cycle life. SCs, which store larger amounts of energy than the traditional dielectric capacitors, can provide energy far faster than LIBs in a much longer cycle life.4,5 In order to meet the advent of hybrid electric vehicles with low emissions, both of them should be integrated into the electrical energy storage systems of hybrid electric vehicles in order to improve their performance in regenerative braking and load levelling systems and cruising range.6 Numerous attempts have been committed to the design and synthesis of promising and novel electrode materials which are suitable for both SCs and LIBs.3,7,8
Among all available electrode materials, Ni–Co-based mixed oxides have been intensely investigated as attractive alternatives for use in SCs and LIBs.2,4,9–14 The integration of two different metal ions can always bring improved electronic conductivity and richer redox reactions in comparison with their single cation component.12 Ni–Co-based mixed oxides have two main crystal structures: the spinel structure, such as NiCo2O4,2,15,16 and the rock salt structure, such as NiCoO2.17,18 For spinel NiCo2O4, Ni2+ lies in the tetrahedral voids of face-centered cubic O2− (occupying one eighth of the tetrahedral voids) and Co3+ lies in the octahedral voids (occupying half of the octahedral voids). For rock salt NiCoO2, both Ni2+ and Co2+ lie in and occupy all the octahedral voids of face-centered cubic O2−, leaving all tetrahedral sites empty.19 The empty tetrahedral sites in rock salt NiCoO2 can also offer a 3D lattice for lithium ion diffusion and electron transition. Maybe, as an electrode material for SCs and LIBs, the rock salt structure can present a comparable or even better electrochemical performance than that of the spinel structure. But such research is still rare.
Rock salt NiCoO2 also has an intrinsic poor electrical conductivity and short electrolyte diffusion distance (∼20 nm) for application in SCs14,18 and suffers severe volume changes and electrode pulverization during lithiation/de-lithiation processes,8,12 the same as spinel NiCo2O4, which are terrible shortages for an electrode and always lead to poor rate performance, large irreversible capacitance/capacity loss and poor cycling stability.13 In order to overcome these shortages, a facile and scalable strategy is proposed in this paper for the synthesis of a unique porous architecture built by ultrathin wrinkled NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 sandwich nanosheets. Ultra-hydrophilic graphene oxide (GO) sheets are dispersed into Ni2+ and Co2+ solution as templates for NiCoO2 precipitation. The GO surface has ample oxygenic functional groups, some of which are negative polar.20,21 They can absorb and anchor positive ion such as Ni2+ and Co2+ on both sides of the GO sheets.10,16 Ni2+ and Co2+ co-precipitate as NiCoO2 precursor layers on GO sheets, that are simultaneously chemically converted to reduced GO (rGO) by HCHO, as enough NH3 and HCHO are formed by hydrolyzing hexamethylenetetramine (HMT). Then NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 sandwich nanosheets can be obtained by annealing. The sandwich sheets are as ultrathin as GO, thus they are randomly wrinkled. As these randomly wrinkled sheets stack together during drying, they mutually brace each other to form a unique porous architecture. This architecture has a sufficient specific surface area to facilitate the interaction of the active materials with electrolyte.17,22 In the architecture, the poor conductivity of NiCoO2 is greatly improved by high quality rGO, meanwhile the perfect flexibility of rGO can also guarantee the stability of the architecture. The electrochemical tests on the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite validate that the architecture has big advantages as electrode material for SCs and LIBs.
Experimental section
Synthesis of NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 sandwich sheets
GO was synthesized by an improved Hummers method.23 For the synthesis of the ultrathin NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 sandwich, firstly, 30 mg GO was dispersed in 100 mL deionized water by super-sonication for 2 h. 400 mg mixture of Ni(NO3)·6H2O and Co(NO3)·6H2O with a molar ratio of 1:1, and 220 mg of hexamethylenetetramine ((CH2)6N4, designated as HMT) were dissolved in 50 mL deionized water forming a pale pink solution. Then the solution was added into the GO solution slowly under magnetic stirring, and super-sonicated for another 10 min. After that, the mixed solution with violent stirring was heated to 90 °C in an oil bath reacting for 6 h. Then, the black sediment was collected by centrifugation, and washed thoroughly with ethanol and deionized water after cooling down to room temperature naturally. Finally, the obtained product was freeze-dried and further annealed at 350 °C for 2 h in flowing N2 to obtain the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite. For comparison, self-assembled NiCoO2 sheets were synthesized in the same procedure without adding the GO sheets. All the chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. and directly used without further purification.
Materials characterization
The prepared samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2500 pc, Cu Kα radiation: λ = 1.5406 Å), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB Mk II spectrometer using unmonochromatized Al Ka radiation), and Raman spectroscopy (Lab RAM HR Raman spectrometer using laser excitation at 514.5 nm from an argon ion laser source). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT 2960) was measured up to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air. The morphologies and structures were characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6700F field emission) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) system operated at an acceleration voltage of 8.0 kV, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F, 200 kV). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) tests were performed using a Nanosurf Easyscan 2 instrument (Veeco Dimension 3100). The Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer was used to determine the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) porosities. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker TENSOR 27) was carried out with a DTGS detector by making pellets with KBr powders.
Electrochemical measurements
SC tests were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) in a three-electrode system, containing NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 or NiCoO2 as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, a Pt foil as the counter electrode, and 3 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The working electrode is prepared by mixing active materials, acetylene black and polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) as solvent and pasting the mixture onto clean Ni foam (1 cm × 1 cm) and drying at 100 °C for 10 h in a vacuum. Then the working electrodes were obtained by pressing the coated Ni foam under 10 MPa pressure. The mass loading density of active materials was estimated to be 2.5 mg cm−2. LIB measurements were carried out using 2025 coin-type cells. Metallic lithium sheets were used as both the counter and reference electrode. The working electrode is prepared by pasting the above mixture onto the copper foil, followed by vacuum drying at 110 °C for about 10 h. The electrode disks (d = 12 mm) with about 0.8 mg active materials were punched from the foil. The electrolyte is a mixture of 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with a weight ratio of 1:1. The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with the moisture and oxygen content being less than 0.1 ppm. Electrochemical tests were performed using a multi-channel battery testing system (LAND CT2001A) between 0.01 and 3 V at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were tested with an IVIUMSTAT electrochemical workstation.
Results and discussion
Morphology and structural analysis
The synthetic process of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 sandwich nanosheet is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Firstly, GO sheets are dispersed into deionized water, and then Ni2+, Co2+ and HMT are added in the solution serially. The metal cations (Ni2+ and Co2+) could be strongly absorbed by the polar oxygen-containing functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl, on both sides of the GO sheets.24 As the solution is heated to 90 °C, the HMT starts to hydrolyze into HCHO and NH3, which is identified by the FTIR spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†). The former, as a strong reducing agent, has the ability to reduce GO into graphene, and the latter can cause an increase of the solution pH value to form the NiCoO2 precursor.25 During the reaction, NiCoO2 precursors prefer to nucleate on the surface of GO sheets because of the coordination effect between metal cations and oxygen-containing functional groups of GO.10 Simultaneously, GO sheets are chemically reduced via losing oxygen-containing surface groups because of the presence of the strong reducing agent (HCHO). As a consequence, ultrathin NiCoO2 precursor layers are generated on both sides of the rGO sheets (designated as the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 precursor). Finally, the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 sandwich nanosheets can be obtained by annealing treatment in N2. The whole formation reactions of NiCoO2 could be described by the following steps: (CH2)6N4 + 6H2O → 6HCHO + 4NH3(1) H2O + NH3 → NH4+ + OH−(2) Co2+ + Ni2+ + 4OH− → Co(OH)2 + Ni(OH)2(3) Co(OH)2 + Ni(OH)2 → NiCoO2 + 2H2O(4)

Fig. 2 shows the typical XRD patterns of the obtained products. The as-prepared NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 precursor (curve a) could be reasonably assigned to a hybrid of rGO, Ni(OH)2, and Co(OH)2.25–27 For pure NiCoO2 (curve b) and the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite (curve c), three strong diffraction peaks at 2-theta values of 36.8°, 42.8°, and 61.8° can be indexed to diffractions of the (111), (200), and (220) planes of standard cubic NiCoO2 (JCPDS 10-0188), indicating the complete transformation of the NiCoO2 precursor into the NiCoO2 phase. The vague inconspicuous diffraction peak with low intensity at around 23–26°, which can be assigned to rGO, suggests that NiCoO2 layers effectively prevent rGO sheets from re-stacking.10 The atomic ratio of Ni and Co is close to 1:1 detected by EDX, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

Raman spectra of the pure NiCoO2 and NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite are shown in Fig. 3a, and the existence of rGO is indicated by the prominent D and G peaks at about 1355 and 1596 cm−1 beside the distinct characteristic peak of NiCoO2 at 532 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite.28 The mass percentage of rGO in the composite was determined by TGA in air, and the result is shown in Fig. 3b. Following the volatilization of the surface-adsorbed substance below 180 °C, a sharp decline appears in the TG curve, which ends at 370 °C and is caused by the oxidation decomposition of rGO. The as-prepared composite consists of ∼13.5 wt% rGO and 86.5 wt% NiCoO2. The more detailed elemental composition and chemical state of the as-prepared NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite were further investigated by XPS. The survey spectrum (Fig. 3c) indicates the co-existence of Ni, Co, O and C. The strong peak of C 1s can be attributed to rGO. The high resolution spectrum of Ni 2p of the composite (Fig. 3d) exhibits two peaks located at 854.2 and 872.9 eV assigned to the electronic states of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively. Each main peak is accompanied by a plump shake-up satellite, which suggests the electronic state of Ni2+.29,30 The spectrum in Fig. 3e shows two peaks at the binding energies of 780.4 and 796.4 eV which could be attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. The shake-up satellite peaks accompanying the Co 2p1/2 peak indicate the existence of Co2+.31,32 The strong C 1s peak (284.6 eV) is attributed to CC/C–C in rGO (Fig. 3f), whereas the other ones arise from the oxygenated carbons (carbon in C–O at 286.1 eV; carbonyl carbon, CO, 288.1 eV; and carboxylate carbon, O–CO, 289.2 eV).20 According to the fitting results, only 12.5% of carbon atoms in the rGO is oxygenated, much lower than the thermally reduced GO in our previous work,21 where 27.6% of the carbon atoms is oxygenated (Fig. S3, ESI†). So the as-prepared rGO is of high quality, which proves the high efficiency of HCHO in reducing GO.

The structure and morphology of the as-prepared samples were characterized by FESEM and TEM. Fig. 4a and b show the FESEM and TEM images of the pure NiCoO2 sheets. The NiCoO2 sheets are ultrathin, leading to the faint mass density contrast in the TEM image, and the thickness determined from the AFM image is ∼4 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (the inset of Fig. 4b) shows well-defined diffraction rings, indicating the crystalline nature of the cubic phase. Although the sheets are crystalline, as validated by the XRD result and SAED pattern, they still have lots of random wrinkles, as shown in the FESEM and TEM images, because of the ultrathin thickness. As the randomly wrinkled sheets were assembled together, they inevitably compose a unique porous framework shown in Fig. 4a. The as-prepared NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite has a similar structure, as shown by the FESEM images in Fig. 4c and d and the TEM image in Fig. 4e. The diffraction rings of the corresponding SAED pattern in the inset of Fig. 4e and the interference fringe in the HRTEM image of Fig. 4f validate that crystalline NiCoO2 sheets are formed on the rGO sheets. The elemental mapping images of EDX in Fig. S5 (ESI†) also show a uniform distribution of Co, Ni, O and C. In fact, the NiCoO2 sheets are not continuous. A large number of cracks are found in an enlarged HRTEM image shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The cracks may derive from the decomposition of the NiCoO2 precursor. The thickness of GO, determined by AFM in Fig. S7 (ESI†), is ∼2 nm. After two NiCoO2 sheets anchor on both sides of GO, the thickness of the sandwich sheet is ∼6 nm which is also determined by AFM as shown in Fig. 5. After adding GO, the thickness of the synthesized NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 sandwich sheet is still thin enough, and comparable to that of the pure NiCoO2 sheet. Thus the unique porous architecture of the pure NiCoO2 nanosheets is inherited by the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 sandwich sheets as shown in Fig. 4c. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the pure NiCoO2 and NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite were recorded, with the insets presenting their corresponding BJH pore size distribution (Fig. 6). The BET specific surface area and pore volume are 138.1 m2 g−1 and 0.80 cm3 g−1 for the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite, which are even larger than those of the pure NiCoO2 (124.8 m2 g−1 and 0.31 cm3 g−1).

Supercapacitor performance
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed on the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite in three-electrode configurations to evaluate its electrochemical performance as an electrode of SCs. Fig. 7a shows the typical CV curves of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite from 5 to 80 mV s−1. The shape of the CV curve is distinct from that of electric double-layer capacitance characterized by nearly rectangular CV curves,33 which clearly confirms the pseudocapacitive behavior. Two pairs of well-defined redox peaks can be observed in the CV curves. For the CV curve scanned at the lowest rate of 5 mV s−1, two oxidation peaks appear at ∼0.44 and 0.48 V in the anodic sweep and two reduction peaks appear at ∼0.29 and 0.33 V in the cathodic sweep, which correspond to the faradaic oxidation/reduction reactions of Ni–O/Ni–O–OH and Co–O/Co–O–OH, respectively.2,4 As the scan rate increases, the shape of the CV curve is well maintained, indicating that the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite is beneficial for fast redox reactions. But the potential differences between the oxidation and reduction peaks also increase with scan rate, which suggests irreversible reactions and electric polarization.34

The corresponding charge/discharge curves tested at various current densities are presented in Fig. 7b. Evidently, there are well-defined voltage plateaus in all these charge/discharge plots, which further suggests the typical pseudocapacitive characteristics. Fig. 7c shows the relationships between specific capacitance and the current density of pure NiCoO2 and NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2. The specific capacitances of the active materials were calculated from the discharge curves based on the formula Cs = IΔtm−1ΔV−1, where Cs (F g−1) is the specific capacitance, I (A) refers to the discharging current, m (g) corresponds to the weight of active materials, and ΔV (V) represents the potential change within the discharge time Δt (s). Clearly, the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode exhibits higher specific capacitance values than the pure NiCoO2 electrode does at each current density. The NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode gives an excellent pseudocapacitance of 784, 763, 682, 640, 572 and 546 F g−1 at a current density of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 A g−1, respectively. The higher the current density that is loaded, the larger the capacitance gap between the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode and the pure NiCoO2 electrode is. It suggests that the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode would benefit from the good conductivity of rGO. The rate performance of the electrode is also good, even much better than recent reported work.18 The cycling stability, an important indicator for high efficiency SCs, is further evaluated under repeated charge/discharge conditions at a constant current density of 20 A g−1 (Fig. 7d). Impressively, there is only a loss of 12.4% in the specific capacitance even after cycling for 2000 cycles.
Li ion battery performance
The lithium storage performances of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite were also investigated by assembling them into lithium ion half-cell batteries. Fig. 8a displays representative CV profiles of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 between 0.01 and 3 V. Three obvious redox peaks can be clearly identified from every CV curve. For the first cathodic sweep, the dominant cathodic peak located at around 0.51 V can be attributed to the reduction of Ni2+ and Co2+. And the cathodic peak subsequently shifts to around 0.93 V with a reduced intensity in the following scans. In addition, two poorly defined anodic peaks at ∼1.45 and 2.23 V could be assigned to the oxidation of metallic Co and Ni to CoO and NiO, respectively. Remarkably, apart from the first cycle, the subsequent cycles overlap well, suggesting the good reversibility of the redox reactions. On the basis of the CV results and previous literature,12,17,35 the total electrochemical reaction mechanism could be described by the following electrochemical conversion reaction: NiCoO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → Co + Ni + 2Li2O(5) Co + Li2O ↔ CoO + 2Li+ + 2e−(6) Ni + Li2O ↔ NiO + 2Li+ + 2e−(7)
 Fig. 8  (a) Representative CV curves at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 and (b) charge/discharge voltage profiles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode versus a metallic lithium reference electrode; (c) cycle performances at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and (d) rate performances of the pure NiCoO2 and NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode; and (e) cycle performance and coulombic efficiency for the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode at a current density of 1 A g−1. 
The typical charge/discharge voltage profiles of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 8b. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the electrode are 1186 and 850 mA h g−1, respectively, suggesting a coulombic efficiency of 71.7%. The second discharge capacity is 912 mA h g−1, suffering 274 mA h g−1 loss compared to the initial one. That is consistent with the peak intensity decline in the second cathodic sweep of the CV curves. The voltage plateaus of the second discharge curve increase from 0.75 V to 1.1 V, corresponding to the reduction peak shift in the second cathodic curve of the CV curves. The large irreversible capacity loss and the increase of the voltage plateaus should be associated with SEI film formation and electrolyte decomposition.36,37 The following discharge/charge cycle overlaps with the second one very well. The good overlap of the curves after the first cycle suggests a good electrochemical reversibility. For the pure NiCoO2 electrode, the initial discharge and charge capacities are 950 and 633 mA h g−1, giving a much lower coulombic efficiency of 66.6% (Fig. S8, ESI†). And it still suffers capacity loss even after the second cycle.
The cyclic performances of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode and the pure NiCoO2 electrode are also compared at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 8c, the capacity of pure NiCoO2 continuously drops off during discharge/charge cycling. After 60 cycles, the NiCoO2 electrode only delivers a reversible capacity of 391 mA h g−1. For the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode, the reversible capacity is gradually increasing during the initial 17 cycles, which suggests it would need a number of cycles to totally activate all of the electrode material.38–41 It achieves a maximum value of 998 mA h g−1, 83.8% of the initial discharge capacity. That capacity can be retained until the 60th cycle. The value is even higher than the theoretical value of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 composite (Ctheoretical = CNiCoO2 × mass percentage of NiCoO2 + Cgraphene × mass percentage of graphene = 717 × 86.5% + 744 × 13.5% = 721 mA h g−1).21,42 Such a high specific capacity of NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 may be attributed to the following points: firstly, the rGO sheets have numerous significant disorder and defects, which can also contribute to the lithium storage capacity, except for the inherent capacity (formation of intercalation compounds Li3C).16,42 Secondly, the reversible decomposition of the SEI and extra lithium ion adsorption/desorption on the SEI during cycling may also lead to the high experimental lithium storage capacity.43,44 Thirdly, interfacial interaction, also called the Butterfly Effect, between NiCoO2 and rGO sheets can lead to an increase of reversible capacity.30,45Fig. 8d shows the rate performance of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode at different current densities (0.1–1.6 A g−1). And the corresponding charge/discharge curves can be seen in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode delivers an average discharge capacity of 880, 886, 856, 807, and 706 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 A g−1, respectively. 80.3% of the capacity can be retained even as the current density is enlarged 16 times from 0.1 to 1.6 A g−1. Importantly, as the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1 after 60 cycles, the electrode releases an even higher reversible capacity (1061 mA h g−1) than the initial. In fact, that value is comparable to the one obtained after 60 times cycling of discharge/charge at 0.1 A g−1 as shown in Fig. 8c, indicating the good stability of the electrode. To further determine the durability of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode, we subsequently measured the cycling life up to 350 cycles at 1 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 8e. The reversible capacity suffers a fast decline in the initial 20 cycles and then is maintained at 595 mA h g−1 for the following 330 cycles. As a contrast, the pure NiCoO2 electrode presents a worse rate capability at each current density and the gap between the reversible capacities of the two electrodes expands as the current density increases. The large current density loading also causes unrecoverable capacity loss. As the current density returned to 0.1 A g−1, only half of the initial capacity was retained. The excellent performances of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode for the storage of Li ions are even rare in recent reports about Ni–Co–O-based electrodes (Table S1, ESI†).12,17,20,27,35,46–52
EIS measurements were carried out at frequencies from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz on both the as-prepared electrodes. As shown in Fig. 9, the Nyquist plots of the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 and NiCoO2 electrodes share a similar feature with an inclined line at the low frequency region and a depressed semicircle in the high-medium frequency region. The interception on the Z′ axis at the high frequency end denotes the electrolyte resistance (Re). The size of the semicircle that encompasses the medium frequency region is a symbol of the charge transfer resistance (Rct). And the inclined line in the low frequency response indicates the Warburg impedance related to Li ion diffusion in the solid.41,53 Using the equivalent circuit model in the inset of Fig. 9,21,54Rct can be obtained by fitting the spectra. It is 52 Ω for the NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 electrode and 92 Ω for the NiCoO2 electrode.

As excellent electrodes for SCs and LIBs, they should be porous, to make sure there is access of the electrolyte, and have a high specific surface area and good conductivity. A pseudocapacitance chemical reaction takes place on the interface of electrode materials with electrolyte. A high specific surface area can provide a high ratio of mass on the interface to react and thus guarantee a high specific capacitance. A high specific surface area and mesopores can also supply plenty of reaction sites for LIBs and shorten the route of lithium ion diffusion. Then the LIBs can have large lithium storage and good rate performances. Good conductivity is essential to electrode materials of SCs and LIBs, which can improve the reaction kinetics, power density, output voltage and energy density. The synthesized NiCoO2 sheets in our work are ultrathin. Although they are crystalline, they can still be randomly wrinkled and needn't keep an invariable contour profile of the crystal. As they are stacking together, the random wrinkled sheets mutually brace each other and build up a unique porous architecture. In order to improve the conductivity, the rGO sheets of high quality were in situ sandwiched by NiCoO2 sheets in the work, where the rGO sheet can act as an expressway for charge transfer. The as-prepared NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 sandwich sheets are as thin as the NiCoO2 sheets. So they can inherit the properties of the NiCoO2 sheets and build up a similar porous architecture like the NiCoO2 sheets. The addition of rGO significantly improves the conductivity of the electrode, as proven by the EIS results in Fig. 9. That makes the electrode have a better rate performance than that of the pure NiCoO2 electrode in SCs (Fig. 7c) and LIBs (Fig. 8d). The NiCoO2 sheets are firmly anchored with rGO forming a surface-to-surface contact, which is the best model for structural affinity between graphene and the introduced supported materials because the contact efficiency between graphene and the 2D supported materials is the highest, in contrast with the contact between 2D graphene and 1D/0D supported materials, which is in a line-to-line or point-to-point mode.55 So the 2D NiCoO2 sheets can be contacted tightly with rGO. Meanwhile, rGO is ultra-flexible and mesoporous NiCoO2 sheets are ultrathin. The large volumetric change of NiCoO2 during lithiation/de-lithiation can be accommodated by the flexible rGO and the room between the sandwich sheets.10,56 Thus, the NiCoO2 sheets wouldn't easily peel off from the surface of rGO. That explains why the cycle life of the electrode is pretty long.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully inserted a high quality rGO sheet between two ultrathin mesoporous NiCoO2 nanosheets to form an ultrathin randomly wrinkled NiCoO2/rGO/NiCoO2 sandwich nanosheet using a facile and scalable chemical co-precipitation method. As the randomly wrinkled sandwich nanosheets stacked together, a unique porous architecture with ultrahigh specific surface area was inevitably built up. Inserting high quality rGO effectively improved the conductivity. The firm adhesion between the NiCoO2 sheet and flexible rGO also enhanced the stability during electrochemical cycling. So the composite exhibited excellent electrochemical performances as an electrode material of SCs and LIBs. The strategy presented in this paper may also be useful in the fields of catalysis, sensors, fuel cells, and so on, where transition metal oxides with a high specific surface area, good conductivity and stability can play an important role.
