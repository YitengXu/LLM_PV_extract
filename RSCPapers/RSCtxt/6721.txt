    , Accepted 12th July 2017First published on 12th July 2017AbstractHematite (α-Fe2O3) is a suitable candidate for photoelectrochemical water splitting due to its well-suited band structure, stability, and availability. However, water splitting using a low external potential is the major challenge that limits the practical application of hematite. Here, we achieve a very low onset potential using a sequential surface treatment approach to overcome two fundamental limiting factors, sluggish hole transfer, and interfacial recombination, independently. First, a heavily doped Fe2−xSnxO3 surface passivation layer was created by Sn4+ surface treatment which can robustly inhibit interfacial recombination. Then, an NiOOH catalyst layer was deposited that greatly enhances the charge transfer process across the passivated electrode/electrolyte interface. By exploiting this approach, the optimized sequentially treated photoanode (Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH) exhibits a low photocurrent onset potential of 0.49 V vs. RHE and a saturated photocurrent density of 2.4 mA cm−2 V at 1.5 V vs. RHE. Transient photocurrent and impedance spectroscopy measurements further reveal that the combined Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH layers reduce interfacial recombination and enhance charge transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface. The results provide convincing evidence that it is possible to address the problems of surface trap recombination and sluggish catalysis independently by employing surface passivation layers first and catalysts later sequentially.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is considered to be a promising method for storing one of the most abundant, inexpensive, non-polluting renewable energy sources, solar energy.1–3 Since the first demonstration of PEC water splitting using a TiO2 electrode by Fujishima and Honda,4 a number of semiconductor materials have been widely studied, including TiO2, ZnO, α-Fe2O3, BiVO4, WO3, Cu2O metal nitrides and phosphides such as Ta3N5 and GaP, metal oxynitrides such as TaON and silicon such as n-type and p-type silicon. Among these materials, Fe2O3 would appear to be a suitable candidate for solar hydrogen production as it allows access to conversion up to 45% of photons from ambient sunlight (photons with wavelengths shorter than 620 nm) and can potentially offer energy conversion efficiencies >15%.5,6 Indeed, hematite has long been studied as a water splitting photoanode material, inspired by its low cost, wide availability, high stability in a broad pH range, and ability to absorb a significant portion of the visible-light spectrum.7,8 However, there are numerous challenges that must be unraveled to accomplish its theoretical solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency.
Most problems associated with the use of hematite as a photoanode are associated with the intrinsic properties of the material itself. For example, it has a band gap energy of 2–2.2 eV which is large enough to enable selective absorption of photons having sufficient energy to drive water-splitting reactions. Another limitation is its very short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm9,10) compared to its light penetration depth (α−1 = 118 nm at λ = 550 nm),11 which results in rapid non-radiative electron–hole recombination inside the semiconductor.12 The short transport length is a consequence of both the short lifetime of the photo-excited electron/hole pair (estimated to be a few ps)13 and the low mobility of the hole itself.6 Poor oxygen evolution reaction kinetics is also a major challenge that limits the solar conversion efficiency of hematite thus requiring a large applied potential to drive water oxidation.14 This is due to insufficient transfer of photogenerated holes from the electrode surface to the electrolyte solution which occurs only under sufficient applied potential.
Several studies have demonstrated various strategies to sidestep these shortcomings. For example, nanostructuring has long been used to offer a large interfacial area between the photocatalyst and the electrolyte, which is favorable for the transportation and separation of charge carriers. To date, various highly photoactive Fe2O3 morphologies such as nanoparticles, nanoflowers, nanowires, nanotubes, nanocones, etc., have been demonstrated.15 Efforts have also been focused on impurity doping to enhance the electrical conductivity and thereby extend the lifetime of the charge carriers by reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. So far, hematite has been doped with Ge, Mn, Si, Sn, Ti, and Zr as n-type10,16–18 and Co, Cu, and Mg as p-type dopants.19–21 The sluggish hole transfer across the electrode–electrolyte interface can be improved either by employing co-catalysts or non-catalytic passivation layers. These two phenomena are fundamentally different mechanisms in assisting hole transport. In the case of using co-catalysts, hole transport from the electrode surface to the electrolyte involves the oxidation of the metallic element of the co-catalyst, while non-catalytic surface passivation involves the lowering of electrode surface defects which reduces the hole–electron recombination rate.22 A number of studies have demonstrated the effect of co-catalysts and surface passivation layers on the hematite surface. IrO2, Co–Pi, Ni–Bi, Ni(OH)2, NiOOH, etc. have been deposited on the hematite surface as water oxidation catalysts.7,23–26 Similarly, several non-catalytic passivation layers have also been shown to affect the OER of the hematite surface, even though no catalytic sites exist to enhance the charge transfer process. It has been made apparent by the work of Hisatomi et al. that group-13 oxides such as Al2O3, Ga2O3, or In2O3 deposited on ultrathin hematite film (27–30 nm thick) photoanodes using the chemical bath deposition technique have led to 70, 250 and 150 mV cathodic shifts in onset potential compared to the bare hematite, respectively.27 Similarly, ultrathin TiO228 and ZnO over layers29 have shown significant reduction of the overpotential of hematite photoanodes. In addition to the above strategies, spectral converters such as ZrO2:Er3+30 and NaYF4:Yb,Er31 nanocrystals have been employed to enable harvesting more photons both in UV and IR regions compared to conventional hematite.
Previous reports have shown that the hole transport property of the hematite electrode can be enhanced by employing co-catalysts and/or surface passivation layers on the surface of the electrode. However, the dual effect and the order of deposition of co-catalysts and surface passivation layers on a single electrode, which are fundamentally different mechanisms in overcoming sluggish hole transport, lack clear understanding. Here, we have studied the combined effect of co-catalysts and surface passivation layers employed on hematite surfaces on the hole transfer property across the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. To this end, we have synthesized 1D hematite nanorod arrays and modified them with an NiOOH oxygen evolution catalyst and Fe2−xSnxO3 surface passivation layer using various configurations. First, the electrode surface was modified with NiOOH and Fe2−xSnxO3 independently. Then, we have sequentially modified the electrode surface using NiOOH and Fe2−xSnxO3. This enabled us to understand the specific role of the co-catalyst and surface passivation layer in improving the interfacial hole transfer property of hematite which is a major performance bottleneck that limits its practical application.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and chemicals
Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (99+%, Acros Organics), nickel(II) sulfate hexahydrate (99%, Acros Organics), tin(IV) chloride (99%, Acros Organics), isopropyl alcohol (99.5% min, Mallinckrodt Chemicals), ethanol (99.5%, Shimakyu's Pure Chemicals), sodium acetate (99+%, Acros Organics), and sodium hydroxide (99%, Shimakyu's Pure Chemicals). All reagents were used directly without any further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of samples

2.2.1. Preparation of Fe2O3 photoanodes. 
Hematite photoanodes were prepared via a simple solution-based method followed by in situ two-step annealing as described in our previous work with some modification.7 First, aqueous solution containing 0.15 M iron(III) chloride hexahydrate and 0.15 M urea was prepared. Moreover, a piece of FTO coated glass was cleaned ultrasonically with EXTRAN MA 02 neutral liquid detergent and washed with DI water and isopropyl alcohol followed by excess DI water. Then, the clean FTO coated glass was put into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave facing its conductive side towards the Teflon-lined autoclave. 10 mL precursor solution was added to the autoclave, sealed and heated at 100 °C for 7 hours. Next, the autoclave was cooled down naturally and the film coated FTO coated glass was taken out of the Teflon-lined autoclave, washed with absolute ethanol and DI water separately and then air dried. A uniform yellow layer of FeOOH film was coated on the FTO coated glass. The FeOOH film was changed to Fe2O3via in situ two-step annealing, initially at 500 °C for 2 h followed by a short annealing at 800 °C for 20 min.


2.2.2. Preparation of Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3 (surface treatment with Sn). 
Initially, 1.25 mM Sn(IV) aqueous solution was prepared. Then, the as-prepared FeOOH nanorod films were dip coated into a freshly prepared solution for two, four, six, eight and ten deposition cycles. The Sn4+ treated FeOOH films were transferred to a tube furnace for two-step in situ annealing, initially at 500 °C for 2 h followed by a short annealing time of 20 min at 800 °C. The high temperature helps to diffuse Sn into the surface of Fe2O3 creating a heavily doped Fe2−xSnxO3 surface passivation layer. The electrode is then designated as Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3.


2.2.3. Photo-assisted electrodeposition of the NiOOH catalyst. 
For photo-assisted electrodeposition of the NiOOH catalyst, the Fe2O3 or Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3 electrodes were transferred to a three-electrode PEC cell containing 0.13 M sodium acetate, 0.13 M nickel(II) and 0.1 M sodium sulfate solution. The Fe2O3 or Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3 and Ag/AgCl electrodes and Pt mesh were used as working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Prior to the deposition, the solution was purged with nitrogen gas for 30 min. During deposition, the Ni2+ solution was kept at 50 °C and continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer while light was illuminated at the backside of the film. During illumination, the holes generated from Fe2O3 are used to oxidize Ni2+ to Ni3+, which precipitate as NiOOH on the surface of the Fe2O3 electrode (Ni2+(aq) + h+ + 3OH− → NiOOH(s) + H2O). To facilitate the deposition process, an external bias of 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied. The thickness of the NiOOH layer was controlled by varying the amount of charge that passes during the deposition. After deposition, the electrodes were thoroughly rinsed with DI water and air dried. The electrodes are designated as Fe2O3/NiOOH and Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH. For the preparation of Fe2O3/NiOOH/Sn4+ (reversely surface modified samples), the Fe2O3/NiOOH electrode was dip coated into a freshly prepared Sn4+ solution and dried at 80 °C for 2 h.

2.3. Structural characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of all the samples were obtained using a D2 phaser XRD-300 W diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation source operating at 30 kV and 100 mA. Raman spectra measurements were performed using a ProMaker confocal Raman microscope system. A solid-state laser operating at 532 nm was used as the excitation source with a laser power of 20 mW to circumvent degradation with 10 s exposure time and 15 accumulations. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM 6500F, JEOL) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX-JSM 6500F, JEOL) has been employed to further investigate the morphology and chemical composition of the samples. To confirm the attachment of the NiOOH co-catalyst, the Ni residue in the electrolyte was analyzed by using an ICP-AES (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry) JY 2000 2 model from HORIBA Scientific. UV-Vis diffused reflectance spectra were obtained using a JASCO (ISV-469) V 560 UV-vis spectrometer (UV-visible absorption spectrometer (Shimadzu, Model UV 3600)). The absorption spectra were obtained by analyzing the reflectance measurement using the Kubelka–Munk (KM) function:  where f(R) is the Kubelka–Munk function and S is the scattering coefficient.
2.4. Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC properties of the photoanodes were tested in a three-electrode cell configuration containing Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode, and Fe2O3 photoanode as a working electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M NaOH aqueous solution (pH 13.6). A 300 W xenon arc lamp (6258, Newport) coupled with an AM 1.5G filter was used as the light source. Its intensity was calibrated at 100 mW cm−2 (1 Sun illumination) using a silicon diode (Newport). N2 gas was continuously bubbled through the solution before and during the experiment to remove any dissolved O2 and thus suppress the reduction of O2 at the counter electrode. In all PEC measurements, the potential in Ag/AgCl was changed to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation:  where, ERHE is potential in the RHE, EoAg/AgCl = 0.1976 V at 25 °C, and EAg/AgCl is the experimentally measured potential against the Ag/AgCl reference. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using an electrochemical impedance analyzer with an AC amplitude of 10 mV and frequency range between 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The measured EIS data were obtained at an applied bias of 0 V vs. RHE at 25 °C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural crystallographic and optical properties
The fabrication process of Fe2O3 begins with the synthesis of iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) nanopillars grown on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate via a solution-based hydrothermal synthesis route. Fig. 1(a) and (b) display the SEM images of the as-synthesized FeOOH sample and Fe2O3 obtained after successive in situ annealing at 500 and 800 °C, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(a) the FeOOH sample consists of square-shaped nanopillar arrays. It is also evidenced from the corresponding cross-sectional SEM view (Fig. 1(c)) that the nanopillars are perpendicularly arranged to the substrate surface. The average film thickness was found to be 382 nm. After successive in situ annealing of FeOOH at 500 and 800 °C, the shapes of nanopillars have been dramatically changed to nanorods. The morphological change, which is solely caused by the high annealing temperature, brings a number of amendments in the properties of the electrode. For instance, the width of the square top of FeOOH nanopillars shows a slight increment in the circular radius of Fe2O3 nanorods. However, from the cross-sectional SEM measurement, there is no significant change in the film thickness of the samples upon annealing; indicating that annealing mainly affects the lateral growth of nanopillars (Fig. 1(d)).
 Fig. 1  (a) and (c) top and cross-sectional view images of FeOOH, respectively. (b) and (d) top and cross-sectional view images of Fe2O3, respectively. 
The change in morphology of the samples after Sn treatment and further deposition of the NiOOH co-catalyst were also investigated. Fig. 2(a) shows the morphology of FeOOH after successive Sn treatment and annealing at 500 and 800 °C. It is shown that its surface became more rough compared to untreated Fe2O3 nanorods. This might be due to the formation of a heavily doped Fe2−xSnxO3 layer on the Fe2O3 surface. Fig. 2(b) shows the SEM image of the Sn treated sample after deposition of the NiOOH co-catalyst for 5 min. The sample is designated as Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH. It is clearly shown that a rough and wrinkled featured NiOOH film was conformally coated on the entire surface of individual Fe2O3 nanorods. This is due to the fact that the Fe2O3 nanorods can generate holes so that the catalyst can be deposited on the active surface area of individual Fe2O3 nanorods selectively. Using this approach, an optimized amount of NiOOH was deposited within 5 min and a current density of 0.035–0.085 mA cm−2 was generated, corresponding to a total charge of 6.7 mC cm−2 (Fig. S2(a), ESI†). The possible reactions during photo-assisted electrodeposition of NiOOH are given below.CH3COO− + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH− (inside the deposition solution)Fe2O3 + hν → e− + h+ (in Fe2O3)Ni2+ + 3OH− + h+ → NiOOH + H2O (on Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3 surface)O2 + 2H2O + 2e− → H2O2 + 2OH− (at the platinum surface)The successful synthesis of NiOOH was confirmed by the broad XRD peak observed at 12.3°. The as-synthesized NiOOH was found to be of the gamma phase. The average film thickness of both Sn treated and NiOOH deposited samples was found to be about 385 nm Fig. 2(c) and (d).

The purity and crystalline phase of the samples have been analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy measurements. Three diffraction peaks centered at 2θ angles of 12.6, 35.2 and 56.2° are observed in the XRD pattern of the FeOOH sample which are indexed to the characteristic peaks of β-FeOOH (JCPDS No. 34-1266) (Fig. 3(a)). After two-stage in situ annealing of the FeOOH sample, all the characteristics peaks have been removed and new peaks at 35.8 and 64.2° have been emerged. These peaks correspond to the well documented (110) and (300) diffraction peaks of hematite, confirming complete transformation of FeOOH to α-Fe2O3. Moreover, it is observed that the (110) diffraction peak is more dominant than the (300) diffraction peak, evidencing the high orientation of Fe2O3 nanorod arrays in the 〈110〉 direction. Furthermore, no peak shift, broadening or additional peaks appeared in the XRD patterns of both FeOOH and Fe2O3 samples after Sn surface treatment. However, due to the overlapping of the diffraction peaks from FTO and SnO2, we were unable to confirm the formation of SnO2 on the Fe2O3 surface from the XRD measurement. Accordingly, we employed Raman shift measurement, a more reliable technique for the determination of surface composition. Fig. 3(b) depicts the Raman spectra of pristine Fe2O3, Fe2O3 after surface treatment and commercial SnO2. In both treated and untreated Fe2O3 samples, seven prominent peaks at 223, 242, 289, 405, 495, 606 and 659 cm−1, are observed. These peaks correspond to the characteristics A1g mode (223 and 495 cm−1) and Eg mode (242, 289, 405, and 606 cm−1) of hematite phonon lines. The band observed around 659 cm−1 is attributed to the presence of Fe3O4 or disorder phase within the Fe2O3 crystal lattice. The more intense peak at 1308 cm−1 corresponds to a 2-magnon scattering band arising from the interaction of two magnons creating an anti-parallel closed spin. The intensity of this peak in the Sn treated Fe2O3 sample was more than that of the untreated sample which could be attributed to the change in the surface structure and grain boundary disorder of Fe2O3 due to the surface passivation property of Sn. Furthermore, we have found no characteristic peaks of SnO2 indicating the absence of the formation of SnO2 on the hematite surface after Sn treatment (Fig. 3(b)). Therefore, the change in morphology observed in the SEM images is due to diffusion of Sn to the Fe2O3 surface upon high temperature annealing, creating a heavily doped thin Fe2−xSnxO3 layer.
 Fig. 3  (a) XRD patterns of the as-prepared FeOOH sample and Fe2O3 sample before and after surface treatment. (b) Raman spectra of pristine Fe2O3, surface treated Fe2O3 and commercial SnO2 samples. 
To confirm the light trapping property of the samples, UV-vis optical absorption measurements have been performed. To avoid parasitic light absorption, both the passivation layer and the catalyst need to be as transparent as possible. It is depicted in Fig. S4(a) (ESI†) that the thin Sn surface treatment does not alter the total absorption of the photoanode which in turn has the same photon flux, indicating no significant parasitic absorbance caused by the passivation layer. However, all the samples modified with the NiOOH co-catalyst show a higher absorption intensity compared to the pristine Fe2O3 sample. This might be associated with the black color of the NiOOH film. In addition to this, all samples show a similar absorption edge of 590 nm. The corresponding band gap of the samples was determined from the Kubelka–Munk plots and the results were found to be 2.05 for pristine Fe2O3, Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3 and Fe2O3/NiOOH samples and 2.06 eV for Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH and Fe2O3/NiOOH/Sn4+ (reverse surface modified) samples (Fig. S4(b), ESI†).
3.2. Photoelectrochemical performance measurements
PEC performance measurements have been carried out to understand the dual effects of Sn surface treatment and the NiOOH co-catalyst employed to overcome the interfacial electron–hole transfer properties. The PEC properties have been examined based on two prominent features; saturated photocurrent density, observed at the thermodynamic potential of the water oxidation reaction (1.23 V) and photocurrent onset potential. The determination of onset potential is very critical for the hematite electrode due to its sluggish hole transfer properties. The onset potential has been defined in various literature reports as: the potential at the intersection point of the tangent at maximum slope of photocurrent and the dark current curve;32,33 the potential at which the photocurrent exceeds a certain defined value;26 or the potential at which dJ/dV exceeds a certain defined value.34 However, it should be noted that all these definitions are somewhat arbitrary and may be more or less appropriate depending on the shape of the J–V curves at hand. Although the choice of method to define onset potential might slightly affect the exact values extracted from the J–V curves, the shifts in onset potential with varying the way we modify the surface of the electrode will practically be independent of the chosen method. We have noted that the J–V curves presented herein show a somewhat different slope after the photocurrent starts rising. Therefore, we use the first method to determine the onset potential of samples. Furthermore, several literature reports dealing with hematite also employed this method which is more convenient for us to compare the results.
Linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) scans of Fe2O3 before and after surface treatments are shown in Fig. 4(a). The pristine Fe2O3 photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 0.92 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V. In fact, the pronounced photocurrent density of the sample is due to its enhanced conductivity originating from unintentional Sn doping diffused from the FTO during high temperature annealing.7,8 The photocurrent onset potential of this sample corresponds to 0.74 V which is more positive compared to that of the surface modified samples. This indicates that majority of the surface-reaching holes were lost due to the poor catalytic nature of Fe2O3. On the other hand, the saturated photocurrent density of the Sn treated Fe2O3 photoanode is significantly higher than that of the bare Fe2O3 electrode. Using four deposition cycles of Sn, a photocurrent density of 1.35 mA cm−2 was achieved which is 1.5 times higher than that of pristine Fe2O3. The enhanced photocurrent density originates from two reasons. First, Sn serves as a passivation layer which can reduce surface recombination by passivating surface states. Second, during high temperature annealing a significant amount of Sn can diffuse to the bulk of Fe2O3. This essentially causes Sn doping which increases the conductivity of the material. Combined with unintentional gradient Sn doping from the FTO substrate, intentional Sn surface doping can enhance the conductivity of the electrode and reduce surface recombination, showing higher PEC performance. In addition to the enhancement in photocurrent density, the Sn treated sample exhibits a 60 mV cathodic shift in photocurrent onset potential. This is ascribed to the formation of a heavily doped Fe2−xSnxO3 surface passivation layer which can facilitate charge injection by reducing surface recombination. The surface passivation layer can minimize the loss of surface reaching holes at the electrode/electrolyte junction by passivating surface states of Fe2O3. Further deposition of the NiOOH oxygen evolution catalyst enhances the saturated photocurrent to 1.73 mA cm−2. More importantly, a significantly lower onset potential of 0.51 V is observed which is 180 mV lower than that of the Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3 sample. To understand the catalytic effect of NiOOH we also synthesize Fe2O3/NiOOH. It is shown that a 170 mV cathodic shift in photocurrent onset potential is observed compared to Fe2O3, implying efficient hole injection property of NiOOH. To obtain further evidence on the water oxidation property of the Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH electrode, we synthesize an Fe2O3/NiOOH/Sn4+ electrode by photodepositing NiOOH on Fe2O3 first followed by Sn4+ surface treatment. We have found that the saturated photocurrent density dramatically decreases to 1.0 mA cm−2. At the same time, the photocurrent onset potential shows a 200 mV anodic shift. As it is evidenced from these observations, both surface charge separation and charge injection of surface reaching holes are minimized. The results provide convincing evidence that it is possible to address the problems of surface trap recombination and sluggish reaction kinetics independently by employing surface passivation layers first and catalysts later sequentially. From dark current measurements (Fig. S5(a), ESI†), we have found that the dark current onset potentials of both pristine and Sn treated samples are nearly similar. This is clear evidence that Sn surface treatment is not behaving as a true catalyst. This suggests that the cathodic shift in photocurrent onset potential is due to its surface passivation property. However, the dark current onset of both the Fe2O3/NiOOH and Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH samples shows a more cathodic shift than that of Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3. This shows that the cathodic shift in photocurrent onset potential of Fe2O3/NiOOH and Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH samples is due to the catalytic effect of NiOOH.

Photoelectrode stability is also an essential requirement and one of the serious challenges of PEC devices. In the present work, the stability of the Fe2O3 photoanode after successive surface treatments was assessed via chronoamperometric (I–t) and chronopotentiometry (V–t) measurements in 1 M NaOH solution. The electrode was operated continuously for 12 h at a constant applied potential of 1.23 V (Fig. 4(b), red curve). After 12 h operation time, the photocurrent density decreases from 1.73 to 1.69 mA cm−2 which corresponds to 2.3% photocurrent decay, indicating high stability of the sample. A slight loss of photocurrent was also observed in the LSV measurements. However, surprisingly both the positive and negative photocurrent spikes were completely vanished. At the same time, the photocurrent onset potential further shifted 20 mV cathodically to 0.49 V compared to the same sample operated before the stability test. This photocurrent onset potential is the second lowest value reported for hematite-based photoanodes, compared to 0.45 V for a reported hematite electrode using the facile re-growth strategy and NiFeOx co-catalyst in the literature.35 The chronopotentiometric measurement was also conducted in 1 M NaOH, applying a fixed current density of 1.73 mA cm−2 for 12 h (Fig. 4(b), blue curve). For the first 2½ h, the measured electrode potential decreased gradually, indicating PEC performance enhancement. This might be associated with the activation of the NiOOH catalyst. Then, the measured voltage showed a nearly constant value similar to the photocurrent observed in the I–t curve, evidencing no noticeable performance degradation.
The Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH electrode was further characterized by Raman spectroscopy and SEM after the 12 h stability test. Fig. 4(c) illustrates the SEM image of the Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH electrode after 12 h operation time. It is shown that stacking of sheet-like NiOOH nanostructures was observed which can limit the PEC surface area of the electrode. However, the strong attachment between the NiOOH catalyst and the electrode is still observed even after 12 h activity. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) measurements have also shown that no nickel residue was detected in the electrolyte solution after 12 h PEC operation, suggesting strong attachment between hematite and the NiOOH co-catalyst (Fig. S6, ESI†). From the SEM and ICP-AES measurements, it can be concluded that the 3% PEC decay observed in the PEC measurement originates from the agglomeration of sheet-like structures that can reduce the electrochemical surface area of the electrode and thereby reduce the overall PEC performance of the material.
To further understand the charge transfer characteristics of the samples, we employed transient photocurrent measurements under chopped light illumination. From Fig. 5(a) it is notable that all the samples exhibited positive and negative photocurrent spikes. The positive photocurrent spikes are associated with accumulation of holes in the electrode space charge layer under illumination, whereas the negative transient observed following light switch-off has been assigned to recombination of bulk electrons with holes accumulated in the space charge layer during irradiation, resulting in a back flow of electrons into the photoanode. It illustrates that the positive spikes are larger than the negative spikes in all the electrodes which is due to the larger hole transfer barrier across the electrode/electrolyte junction. Samples sequentially modified with Sn and the NiOOH co-catalyst have shown reduced positive spikes which decrease interfacial recombination and enhance charge transfer property. However, in the reversely modified electrode (i.e. Fe2O3/NiOOH/Sn4+), significantly higher positive and negative photocurrent spikes are observed. This indicates the existence of high surface charge recombination. It is additional evidence that surface charge transfer can be enhanced if and only if the surface passivation layer is deposited before the co-catalyst. The carrier lifetime was further assessed quantitatively from the transient photocurrent measurements by introducing a normalized parameter, D.36  where iph, ist and io are the time-dependent, steady-state and initial photocurrents, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The transient time constant (τ) is determined from the normalized lnD vs. t plots (Fig. 5(b)) deduced from the photocurrent transient curves. The value of τ, which reflects the general behavior of charge recombination and lifetime of the charge carriers, is defined at the time when lnD = −1 in the normalized plots of lnD vs. t. τ was estimated to be 0.332 s for Fe2O3 sequentially treated with surface Sn doping and the NiOOH co-catalyst, which was 2.6, 2.3, 1.3 and 1.7 times higher than that of Fe2O3 (0.13 s), Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3 (0.15 s), Fe2O3/NiOOH (0.25 s) and Fe2O3/NiOOH/Sn4+ (0.20 s), respectively, indicating suppressed charge recombination and enhanced charge transfer properties. The results are also supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The EIS curves in Fig. S7(b) (ESI†) show that the charge transfer resistances decrease in the order Fe2O3/NiOOH/Sn4+, Fe2O3, Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3, Fe2O3/NiOOH, and Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH. Another imperative feature of the EIS curves is that the Fe2O3/NiOOH sample has smaller charge transfer resistance than that of Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3. This signifies that catalysts play much more role than surface passivation layers in transferring charge across the SLJ. To understand the effect of these surface treatments on the carrier density of the photoanode, we have carried out Mott–Schottky (MS) measurements (Fig. S7(c), ESI†) and the results are summarized in Table 1. The results show that the donor density (ND) of the Sn-doped sample is 3.24 × 1020 cm3, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the pristine hematite sample (9.5 × 1019 cm3), confirming the increment of carrier density of the matrix via extensive surface Sn doping. This indicates that a significant amount of Sn can diffuse to the bulk material during high temperature annealing which acts as an n-type doping and thereby increases the carrier density of the system. The ND of Fe2O3/NiOOH and Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH samples are 1.3 and 2.1 times higher than that of the Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3 sample. This is due to the facilitated charge transfer properties of both samples across the SLJ that decrease interfacial charge recombination. However, in the case of the reversely modified sample (Fe2O3/NiOOH/Sn4+), the ND value (1.05 × 1019 cm3) is lower than those of Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3, Fe2O3/NiOOH and Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH samples, which implies higher surface recombination. Therefore, the photocurrent transient, EIS and MS measurements indicate that it is possible to greatly enhance water oxidation kinetics through sequential surface treatment with a surface passivation layer and depositing a catalyst layer.

To explain how the surface treatment can effectively boost the interfacial recombination, we have illustrated the energy band diagrams of pristine and surface treated electrodes immersed in electrolyte (Scheme 1). The photogenerated holes that successfully navigate through the bulk of the hematite electrode and reach the electrode/electrolyte interface are trapped at surface states. Thus, only a fraction of photogenerated holes transfer to the electrolyte and oxidize H2O and the rest are recombined with photogenerated electrons. Moreover, the intrinsic poor water oxidation reaction kinetics of hematite limits the charge transfer performance. After surface treatment with Sn, surface recombination is greatly minimized due to the passivation of surface states by the Fe2−xSnxO3 layer (Scheme 1(b)). In terms of energy, the accumulation of holes has been assumed to occur in localized states (traps), such as higher oxidation states of iron (FeIV, FeV, or FeVI),37 mediating the recombination of holes with conduction band electrons or with reaction intermediates (redox species).38 Therefore, the high concentration of Sn4+ donor dopants in the surface Fe2O3 lattices introduces electrons to these sites, subsequently reducing them to lower oxidation states such as Fe3+ and Fe2+.39 The substitutional Sn4+ dopant ions, thus, induce an extra positive charge on the α-Fe2O3 lattice which can be compensated by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+ (preserving charge neutrality). Thus, the electrical conductivity in the passivated α-Fe2O3 surface proceeds via the polaron hopping mechanism and thereby reduces electron–hole recombination. However, the poor water oxidation reaction kinetics still exists and limits the water oxidation reaction rate. Employing a water oxidation catalyst (NiOOH) over the passivated hematite surface (Scheme 1(c)) increases the rate of the water oxidation reaction and reduces the overpotential by lowering the activation energy. This is evidenced by the drastically lower onset potential observed in the LSV measurements. This infers that it is possible to address the problems of surface trap recombination and sluggish reaction kinetics independently. It is also convincing evidence that co-catalysts should be employed after surface passivation layers.

4. Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrate a novel sequential surface treatment approach on an Fe2O3 photoanode to reveal the independent effect of co-catalysts and surface passivation layers on enhancing the interfacial hole transfer properties. We have found that treating the hematite electrode surface with Sn4+ creates a heavily doped Fe2−xSnxO3 surface passivation layer which can robustly inhibit interfacial recombination by passivating the surface states. While an NiOOH catalyst layer greatly enhances the charge transfer process across the passivated electrode/electrolyte interface. By exploiting this approach, the optimized sequentially treated photoanode (Fe2O3/Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH) exhibits a second record-breaking photocurrent onset potential of 0.49 V vs. RHE and a saturated photocurrent density of 2.4 mA cm−2 V at 1.5 V vs. RHE. Transient photocurrent and impedance spectroscopy measurements further reveal that the combined Fe2−xSnxO3/NiOOH treatment layers reduce interfacial recombination and enhance the charge transfer process across the electrode/electrolyte interface. The results provide convincing evidence that it is possible to address the problems of surface trap recombination and sluggish catalysis independently by employing surface passivation layers first and catalysts later sequentially. Moreover, the electrode was operated continuously at a constant applied potential of 1.23 V for 12 h and showed that 97.7% of the initial photocurrent was conserved, indicating high stability of the sample.
