    , Accepted 18th September 2018First published on 19th September 2018AbstractFluorine-doped hematite samples with different concentrations were successfully synthesized through a hydrothermal method. The 3% F-doped hematite is found to be the optimal catalyst in this study which has a [110]-oriented structure and a remarkable photocurrent density of 1.24 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under one sun irradiation, which is about ten times higher than that of bare hematite (0.12 mA cm−2). F doping also reduces the recombination of free electron–hole pairs. The shift of the Fermi level position caused by F doping leads to the decrease of charge-transfer resistance in the bulk (R1) and interface (R2) and the increase of charge carrier concentration (Nd). In addition, F doping contributes to the shadow defect. All the results indicate that 3% F is the best doping concentration.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive method to produce clean, sustainable and efficient hydrogen by abundant solar energy.1,2 Among the PEC water splitting catalysts, hematite attracts a lot of attention, since it has a lower price and narrow band gap energy (2.1 eV) which results in a wide photon absorption range.3 However, the PEC activity of hematite is severely limited by its poor conductivity, short minority-carrier diffusion length and short electronic lifetime.4–6
Studies have reported that the photocurrent density of hematite can be improved by replacing Fe atoms with other metals, such as Ti,7 Zr,4 V,8 Nb,9 Sn (ref. 10) and Pt,11 since they can dramatically enhance the conductivity and charge carrier concentration of hematite. Additionally, some research studies also suggest that replacing Fe atoms with non-metals, such as Si,12 N,13 S (ref. 14) and P,15 can also improve their photoelectrochemical performance. Zhang and co-workers introduced S into the hematite bulk and verified the increase of electron mobility by DFT calculations and experimental results.14 Replacing Fe atoms with tetravalent atoms augments the number of Fe2+ (oxygen vacancy) sites, which decrease the carrier recombination as shallow donors,16–18 owing to the mechanism that promotes charge neutrality. According to other PEC catalysts, such as TiO2, WO3 and ZnO, O atoms can also be replaced rather than the Fe atoms.19–22 Yang et al. found that replacing O atoms of TiO2 with F atoms can lead to the promotion of electron transfer from the localized states to the conduction band.19 Wang et al. found that replacing O atoms of TiO2 with F atoms improves the electronic transition and narrows the band gap according to DOS analysis.20 Luo et al. found that F-doped ZnO leads to stronger light harvesting, since it has stronger light scattering and longer electron lifetime.22 Meanwhile, there are few studies on substituting the O atom of hematite. As for fluorine, as an example, it has a similar small ionic radius (around 119 pm) to that of oxygen (126 pm). When F bonds to metals, it could lower the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs and LUMOs).23,24
Therefore, in this study, fluorine was chosen as the representative dopant. Fluorine-doped hematite samples were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction. The surface morphology was detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The crystal features and electronic states were obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The charge transfer and separation efficiency were used to determine the carrier recombination degree. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis were used to measure the electronic properties. Furthermore, the UV-vis absorption spectra and XPS valence band tests were considered comprehensively to explain the Fermi level position change. All the results demonstrate that when hematite is doped with 3% of F, the photocurrent density increases to 1.24 mA cm−2 from 0.12 mA cm−2 (bare hematite) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination. The XPS and XRD characterizations confirm the formation of an Fe–F bond in the hematite lattice structure. All the photoelectrochemical measurements suggest that the increase of charge carrier concentration and conductivity lead to the enhancement of the PEC water splitting properties.
2. Experimental
Hematite film synthesis
All the reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd without further treatment. The hematite was deposited on a FTO glass substrate (15 mm × 15 mm, F:SnO2, Nippon, 14 ohm per sq) by a hydrothermal reaction as reported earlier.25 Firstly, the FTO glass was cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized (DI) water for 10 min under ultrasonication, respectively. The precursor solution was prepared by adding 1.6218 g of FeCl3·H2O and 0.2400 g of NaOH into 120 ml of DI water. Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel reactor with the cleaned FTO glass on the bottom. The reactor was heated at 170 °C for 3 hours and cooled down to room temperature. Then the FTO glass was taken out and washed with DI water and ethanol successively. Finally, the dried samples were calcined at 550 °C for 3 h under air in a tube furnace. The fluorine-doped hematite was synthesized in the same way by adding a certain amount of NH4F (mole ratio of F:Fe = 0–8%) into the precursor solution.
Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with an FEI Nova NanoSEM 450. The crystal of the samples was detected by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with a D8 Advance using Cu Kα diffraction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB 250Xi with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The Raman spectra were recorded with a LabRAM HR using 514 nm irradiation. The UV-vis absorption spectra were acquired using a Lambda750 from 200 nm to 800 nm.
PEC measurement
All the PEC measurements were obtained using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT302N) with a three-electrode electrolytic cell system under xenon lamp illumination with an AM 1.5G filter. The intensity of the lamp was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 with an optical power meter. The three-electrode electrolytic cell system was composed of a Ag wire as the counter electrode, the samples as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3 M AgCl) as the reference electrode, and 1 M NaOH solution was used as the electrolyte. The applied voltage was transformed into the reversible hydrogen electrode by eqn (1). ERHE = EAg/AgCl, 3 M + 0.059 pH + 0.222 V(1)
Linear sweep voltammetry was performed from −0.5 V to 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under solar illumination. To easily compare the catalyst photocurrent densities, the light illumination was blocked every 0.05 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in 1 M NaOH electrolyte from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with the applied voltage of 1.23 V vs. RHE under one sun illumination. Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements were performed from −1.0 V to 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M NaOH solution with 1000 Hz in the dark.
3. Results and discussion
The morphology of fluorine-doped hematite samples was investigated by FE-SEM. As Fig. 1 shows, the hematite particles uniformly cover the FTO glass substrate with an average thickness of about 200 nm. The hematite particle size distributions are shown in Fig. 1e. It clearly displays that with the increase of the fluorine content, the average size of hematite particles decreases from 0.31 μm (0% F) to 0.26 μm (3% F), 0.20 μm (5% F) and 0.19 μm (8% F). Such results indicate that fluorine doping affects the hematite particle size.

To verify the crystalline structure of fluorine-doped hematite on FTO surfaces, GIXRD was used and the results are shown in Fig. 2a. All the samples have the typical diffraction peaks of hematite and the FTO substrate,26,27 indicating that α-Fe2O3 is successfully formed on the FTO surface. Detailed information of the (104) and (110) planes of α-Fe2O3 is listed in Table 1. It is noted that the 3% F-doped hematite has the highest area ratio of (110)/(104), indicating that a certain amount of F doping can induce crystal growth along the [110] orientation. According to previous studies, the conductivity of the [110] orientation is about four times higher than that of the [104] orientation.28–30 Thus, the (110) plane is preferred for PEC catalysis. As the F concentration increases, a new Raman peak is observed at 657 cm−1 (shown in Fig. 2b), owing to the lattice stress imperfections and local lattice disorder induced by F doping.3,9,31,32

The XPS spectra of the hematite samples with various F doping concentrations were also investigated to verify the F doping and the change of the state of Fe. From Fig. 3a, it can be seen that the peaks at 710.0 eV and 725.0 eV can be indexed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 in hematite.33,34 The satellite peak at 719.2 eV corresponds to the Fe3+ satellite.35,36 The positive shift of the Fe3+ satellite peak indicates that F doping can generate more stable Fe ionic bonds in hematite. The lack of peaks at 715.0 and 730.0 eV confirms that there is no Fe2+ on the hematite surface.37,38 In addition, as Fig. 3b exhibits, the XPS F 1s peaks for the F-doped samples are at about 684.0 eV. According to the detailed XRD data in Table S1,† the peak positions of the hematite (104) and (110) planes are about the same after doping with F, respectively. Thus, the crystalline structure of hematite is not changed. Considering both XPS and XRD results, it is highly suggested that the Fe–F bond is formed in the hematite samples39 and fluorine displaced oxygen in the Fe2O3 lattice. Such a result agrees with the DFT and experimental results of Xie's group.40

The catalytic performance of hematite was determined by linear sweep voltammetry under illumination and dark conditions. The photocurrent density data obtained for the F-doped hematite samples are shown in Fig. 4, indicating that the doping of F to hematite results in a dramatic improvement of PEC properties. The schematic diagrams of the band structure and electron transfer process of the F-doped hematite during PEC water splitting are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† With the increase of F doping atomic ratio, the activity of hematite increases firstly and then decreases (shown in the inset diagram of Fig. 4). The 3% F-doped hematite has the highest catalytic activity with a photocurrent density of 1.24 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is approximately ten times higher than that of bare hematite. Table S2† shows the comparison of the performance of the catalyst with those of reported hematites in the literature. The F-doped hematite shows stability in 3000 s (shown in Fig. S2†).

In order to determine the internal change of hematite for F doping treatment, the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were examined. The M–S plots of the samples with different F doping concentrations are shown in Fig. 5a. Both bare and F-doped hematite samples are N-type semiconductors with the electrons as carriers, as the slope of the M–S plot is positive. The charge carrier concentration (Nd) was also calculated by the following equation: Nd = 2/(e0εε0)·[d(1/(C2))·1/dV]−1(2)where e0 is the elementary charge. C is the capacitance. ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant of the space and the hematite, respectively.41,42 Moreover, the flat-band potentials (Vfb) of all the samples are also determined by the X-intercept of the M–S plot. The Nd and Vfb values are shown in Table 2. Interestingly, all the F-doped samples can obviously increase the Nd and Vfb values compared to the bare hematite sample. In addition, as the dopant concentration goes up, the Nd and Vfb values increase firstly and then decrease. The 3% F-doped hematite shows the highest Nd and Vfb values. The higher the Nd value, the better the photoconductivity of the hematite sample. Additionally, Vfb represents the relationship between the Fermi level (Ef) and reference electrode. The higher the Vfb value, the better the catalytic activity of the hematite sample. Consequently, the hematite doped with 3% F has the best PEC water splitting performance.

To evaluate the variety of conductivity, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted. Fig. 5b shows the EIS curves of the hematite samples and the equivalent Randles circuit (RC).43 In the model, Rs represents the solution resistance, and R1 represents the charge-transfer resistance in the bulk hematite. R2 is the charge-transfer resistance across the interface between the hematite and solution, as the bigger circle at lower frequency corresponds to the semiconductor/solution interface. Since the charge-transfer resistance in the bulk and interface is much higher than the solution resistance, the water splitting efficiency is mainly limited by these two factors. Table 2 clearly shows that the R1 and R2 values of the hematite samples have the same order of 3% F < 5% F < 8% F < 0% F-doped hematite. The lowest R1 and R2 values of the 3% F-doped hematite indicate that 3% F doping can reduce the recombination rate of carriers in the bulk and interface, and strengthen the conductivity of the hematite,44 which influences the carrier recombination as shown in the following analysis in Fig. 6. Thus, with the highest charge carrier concentration and conductivity, the 3% F-doped hematite shows the highest photocurrent density and the best PEC water splitting performance.
 Fig. 6  (a) J–V curves measured in 1 M NaOH + 0.5 M H2O2 electrolyte, (b) the charge separation efficiency (ηsep) and (c) surface charge transfer efficiency (ηtrans) collected from different F doping concentrations. 
Generally, to understand the effect of F doping on the behaviour of excited electron–hole pairs, the charge separation efficiency (ηsep) and surface transfer efficiency (ηtrans) were determined by LSV experiments with and without 0.5 M H2O2 in 1 M NaOH electrolyte,45 as shown in Fig. 6a. As a hole scavenger, H2O2 has a much higher OER rate21 and relatively negative reduction potential;46 the ηtran is considered to be 100% for H2O2 electrolyte. The H2O oxidation photocurrent is shown in eqn (3) and that for H2O2 is shown in eqn (4). Consequently, the ηsep can be calculated by eqn (5). JH2O = Jmax·ηabs·ηtrans·ηsep(3) JH2O2 = Jmax·ηabs·ηsep(4) ηsep = JH2O2/(Jmaxηabs)(5)where Jmax is the maximum theoretical OER photocurrent density.47ηabs is the light absorption efficiency. ηsep represents the section of photo-holes that do not recombine with electrons or internal traps in the bulk of hematite,21 and ηtrans represents the section of photo-holes that have not been caught by surface traps.46

Fig. 6b demonstrates the ηsep of all the samples, and the 3% F-doped hematite has a higher ηsep (27%) than bare hematite at 1.7 V vs. RHE. As the hole of the hematite is consumed by two competitive processes between PEC water splitting and electron–hole recombination, the increased ηsep of the 3% F-doped hematite indicates that F doping decreases the recombination of free electron–hole pairs and prolongs the life of the holes.9,45,48 This may correspond to the increases of the charge-transfer resistance (R1) in the bulk hematite (Fig. 5b) with F doping. Although 3% F doping increases the ηsep to 27% at 1.7 V vs. RHE, there is still about 70% of the photo-holes which have been consumed in transmission. The ηtrans is calculated by the equation ηtrans = JH2O/JH2O2 and plotted in Fig. 6c. Both 3% F doping and 5% F doping illustrate apparent improvement in surface transfer efficiency, indicating that F doping can reduce the accumulation of holes at the interface between the hematite and solution which may be attributed to the presence of more active sites.49
To appraise the photoconversion efficiency, the applied bias photon-to-current conversion efficiency (ABPE) was calculated by eqn (6) and illustrated in Fig. 7a.50 ABPE = JH2O(1.23 − V)/P(6)where V is the applied bias, and P represents the light intensity (100 mW cm−2). The 3% F-doped hematite has a higher ABPE (5.85%, 1.12 V vs. RHE) than bare hematite (0.71%, 1.05 V vs. RHE), revealing that F doping can significantly promote the PEC water splitting efficiency. Furthermore, the excess peak around 0.9 V vs. RHE appears when the F doping concentration is excessive, which can be attributed to the optimization of the energetics of the hematite system.
 Fig. 7  (a) The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE), (b) UV-vis absorption spectra, (c) Tauc model, and (d) XPS valence band spectra for F-doped hematite samples. 
To confirm the influence of F doping on the band gap energy (Eg) and light absorption, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the hematite samples are presented in Fig. 7b. There is no obvious difference exhibited in the distribution of the absorption range for the samples, indicating that F doping has a negligible impact on the optical absorption properties. In addition, hematite has been proved as an indirect gap material.51 The Tauc relation was calculated from the UV-vis absorption spectra shown in Fig. 7c. The Eg, which was acquired by extrapolating the tangent to the baseline, is about 2.05 ± 0.02 eV for all the hematite samples, indicating that F doping provides a negligible influence on the band gap (Eg) as well.
Besides the Eg, the gap between the Fermi level position (Ef) and conduction band (CB) is another important parameter used to determine the PEC properties of hematite samples. As mentioned above, Vfb has a close relationship with the Fermi level position (Ef) and the Vfb determined by the M–S plot presents an interesting trend with the increase of F element content in hematite.52 Since the Eg values for all the F-doped hematite samples are the same, the gap between the Ef and CB can be determined by the gap between the Ef and valence band (VB). As Fig. 7d shows, the XPS valence band spectra of all the F-doped hematite samples indicate that the gap between the Fermi level and valence band obtained by a previous method is 1.05 eV, 1.65 eV, 1.38 eV and 1.32 eV for the hematite samples with 0% F, 3% F, 5% F and 8% F doping, respectively.49 The XPS valence band results reveal that appropriate F doping can increase the interval between the VB and Ef. The UV-vis absorption spectra confirm that the hematite samples with various F doping concentrations have a similar band gap energy (Eg) of around 2.05 eV, so it can be concluded that the Ef of the hematite samples approaches the conduction band (CB) with F doping.
Considering all the analyses, a schematic diagram of the energy band distribution is shown in Fig. 8. Since fluorine has the strongest electronegativity and a similar ionic radius (119 pm) to oxygen (126 pm), the fluorine atoms in the hematite can attract the surrounding electrons to change the electronic structure of the hematite surface, which results in a charge redistribution and then changes the semiconductor properties. Fig. 8 shows that as F is doped into hematite, the Fermi level shifts towards the CB for all the doped hematite samples. The 3% F-doped hematite has the smallest gap between the Fermi level and CB. With a further increase in F concentration, the Fermi level shifts away from the CB. Such phenomena can be attributed to the growth of shallow donor level traps by a certain amount of F dopant,53 which can prolong the electron lifetime of excited electron–hole pairs and weaken the recombination of free electron–hole pairs which has been proved by the obvious promotion of ηsep and ηtran shown in Fig. 6. Consequently, the 3% F-doped hematite has the highest photocatalytic current density. However, once the F concentration surpasses 5%, over doping may lead to the formation of defect clusters. Defect clusters can capture the electrons for a long time and not readily exchange electrons with the conduction band.54–56 Thus, over doping can lead to the shift of the Fermi level towards the valence band and seriously increase the recombination of carriers and decrease the PEC performance.

4. Conclusions
F-doped hematite samples with dramatic improvement in PEC properties were successfully obtained through a simple hydrothermal synthetic method. The 3% F-doped hematite shows a remarkable photocurrent density of 1.24 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under one sun irradiation, which is about ten times higher than that of bare hematite (0.12 mA cm−2). The combined effects of crystal orientation growth and defect variation reveal that 3% is the optimal F doping concentration. The shift of the Fermi level position towards the CB caused by F doping leads to the decline of charge-transfer resistance and the increase of charge carrier concentration (Nd). This paper demonstrates that fluorine can be used as an effective catalyst to improve the PEC activity of water splitting. Furthermore, we offer a new promising strategy for nanostructured hematite which can be effectively applied to water splitting applications.
