    AbstractInorganic chemistry has been and continues to be a central discipline in the field of renewable energy and solar fuels. A fundamental approach to storing solar energy is artificial photosynthesis, whereby uphill chemical reactions are driven by light, e.g. the water gas shift reaction, halogen acid splitting, or water splitting. This article endeavors to define a common context for these research topics, particularly by analyzing the thermodynamic boundaries of photosynthesis. Specifically, the generalized efficiency restrictions on both light absorption and energy storage are expounded, the analogous limitations for several individual photosynthetic strategies are stated, several synthetic catalyst architectures are highlighted, the advantages of molecular and macroscopic approaches are discussed, and key figures of merit are presented.Neal McDanielNeal McDaniel received his B.S. in Chemistry from the California Institute of Technology in 2005.

Introduction
A fundamental and conspicuous incentive for pursuing solar-derived fuel is the technological gap that makes this discipline a scientific oddity. If one truly understands the working physics behind a natural phenomenon, such as photosynthesis in green plants, then those same principles that govern nature can be employed by scientists in a laboratory setting, and can achieve a similar result. While many complex biological processes have eluded artificial molecular replication, the inclusion of photosynthesis into this category represents a remarkable chasm in human technology, simply due to its general importance. After metabolism, storage of radiative energy in chemical bonds is arguably the most important of all biological processes, as it permits life to develop in Earth's oxidative environment in the absence of reduced materials.
While fossil fuels are the most convenient source of stored solar energy at our disposal, their supply is subject to geography and government regulation. Although there remains an immense reservoir that has yet to be unearthed, the cost of their extraction is likewise dependent on a host of factors, including geography and political climate. By far the most vocal recent complaint about fossil fuel combustion is the unprecedented rate of carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere. The effects of this increase in concentration have long been controversial, especially with regard to climate change, with very few dependable data to work with, and vociferous fanatics at both extremes.
Sunlight's chief advantage over these carbonaceous power sources is its global availability. Particularly enticing are the valueless landscapes of the Sahara, Arabian, and Gobi deserts (∼5 million square miles in total, or 3% of Earth's surface), which are bathed daily in enough unharnessed energy to accommodate existing global power consumption for the next seven years. Inorganic and materials chemistry have been at the forefront of development in photosensitive and catalytic materials for the chemical storage of light. However, in order for a solar fuel program to be economically viable, a photosynthesized product must be competitive in the modern power market. Listed in Table 1 are the availabilities and efficiencies of several common fuels.1 This article examines the thermodynamics of solar fuel generation, highlights several of the pursued artificial photosynthetic reactions, with special emphasis on water splitting, and addresses the chief figures of merit in the field.

From solar cells to solar fuels: reaction thermodynamics
There are a number of ways to think about capturing the sun's radiation and storing it into chemical bonds. As a point of departure, artificial chlorophyll might be compared to its macroscopic, more heavily studied cousin, solar panels. A researcher who wants to create a good solid state photovoltaic (PV) device, which uses a semiconductor to convert light into electricity, might well start by considering his absorbing material's band gap in the context of solar radiation. In order to maximize the cell's power output, the first numbers that the investigator should regard are the current and voltage outputs that are achievable through sunlight. In the top half of Fig. 1 is shown the solar spectrum and its integral, in terms of raw photon count. For a given band gap, the cell's maximum possible current can be easily deduced. Photon flux is also provided in units more relevant to chemistry, μEinsteins m−2 s−1, corresponding to the maximum moles of electrons that could be used to drive an uphill reaction.
 Fig. 1  The noontime, equinoxial solar density spectrum at 37 °S latitude (ASTM, Air Mass 1.5) is drawn in red, in units of photon flux (top) and intensity (bottom). In blue is shown the integral, in various units, of the corresponding solar spectrum in each graph. 
If the number of photons at each wavelength are multiplied by the energy of that wavelength, then the resulting “power density” version of the solar spectrum is obtained, shown as a red line in the bottom half of Fig. 1. Its integral is likewise included as a blue line in the same graph, and represents the total power that could be achieved by a completely ideal cell that perfectly converts every photon's energy into electricity of the same potential. The unorthodox “mL of gasoline m−2 hr−1” unit, indicating the volume of gasoline whose hourly combustion would produce the specified energy, is also included to put these numbers into a more tangible context.
In a realistic solar cell, not all of the energy can be converted. The first inefficiency that should be taken into account is a semiconductor's indifference between red and blue photons. A high-energy absorption can promote an electron from the semiconductor's valence band, across the band gap, high into the conduction bands. Because those bands are so close in energy, relaxation of the excited electron to the band edge occurs on the order of a picosecond,2 and the end result is an excited state whose energy is equal to the band gap (instead of equal to the original absorption), with some wasted thermal energy on the side. When these losses are figured into the equation, the maximum possible efficiency drops from 100% down to 49.0% for silicon, whose band gap is around 1.09 eV.
The second noteworthy loss is the energy required to generate charge separation. The force behind this severance manifests in the form of band bending at the p–n heterojunction of the diode. In effect, when an electron is promoted from the valence to the conduction band, it remains electrostatically attached to the hole it left behind. In order to overcome Coulombic attraction, such that they can drive an external load, a small amount of their potential energy must first be converted into kinetic. For silicon, the minimum driving force for this hole/electron dissociation has been reported by multiple sources to be 31–32% of the bandgap,3 or about 340 meV. Assuming Pauwels’ photovoltage/bandgap limit of 68.7%, this added factor brings the overall power efficiency from 49.0% down to 33.7%.
Also, some of the sun's light that is incident with the cell's surface fails to generate electrical current. This can happen because the photon is reflected instead of absorbed, or because a hole/electron pair radiatively recombine before they can be separated at the p–n junction. Shockley and Queisser estimate a maximum 90% successful conversion on this front, reducing the total efficiency from 33.7% to 30.3% for a single-junction silicon device.3a The considerations involved in artificial photosynthesis are analogous to those described above for a PV cell. A few changes should be noted, however; (A) the simplified, step-function absorption of a semiconductor may now take the form of a more complicated molecular absorption spectrum, (B) the free energy stored into chemical bonds, ΔG°, now replaces the PV cell's operating voltage, and (C) the necessary internal losses involved in photosynthesis differ from those of the photovoltaic cell.
A pictorial example representing the energy pathway for a photosynthetic reaction is provided in Fig. 2. In this illustration, excitation of a molecular photosensitizer (PS) into an arbitrary singlet excited state of good Franck–Condon overlap, Sn, replaces trans-gap electronic promotion in a silicon cell. After the photosensitizer quickly decays to the lowest-lying triplet state, T1, two electron transfers must occur per absorbed photon, one transfer to a reduction catalyst (RC) and the other from an oxidation catalyst (OC), returning the photosensitizer to its ground state, S0. In general, several photoinduced electron transfers may be necessary for catalyst activation, though Fig. 2 only depicts one for clarity. Subsequently, the activated catalysts then convert the reactants (Rnt) into products (Prd). The photoproducts’ free energy, ΔG°, is analogous to the photovoltage of a PV cell. This value, along with the photosensitizer's onset of absorption, are vital to understanding Fig. 3 and 4; they are therefore both labeled in Fig. 2. The remainder of this section discusses photosynthesis in the above-provided context, with special regard to the practical limits imposed on solar conversion by a reaction's ΔG°.
 Fig. 2  Greatly simplified energy diagram for a catalytic photoreaction sensitized by a phosphorescent material (PS). ΔG° and the onset of absorption are highlighted for clarity. 
 Fig. 3  The maximum light-to-fuel efficiency (blue, right) that can be achieved by a photosynthetic reaction whose ΔG° corresponds to the x-axis, with a 0 volt (top) and 0.3 volt (bottom) driving potential for each of the two charge transfers that follow photon absorption, is plotted with the solar intensity spectrum (red, left). 
 Fig. 4  Optimal power efficiency is plotted as a function of both a photoreaction's intrinsic ΔG° and the photosensitizer's onset of absorption. The white curve is a constant 0.6 eV under the diagonal, and represents the estimated minimum driving energy required for a spontaneous, electrocatalytic reaction (0.3 volts above the thermodynamic requirement for each of the reductive and oxidative processes). A blowup of the region relevant to practical systems is shown on the right. 
The change in free energy accomplished during artificial photosynthesis determines the limit for a reaction's power efficiency. Transformations that require too much energy will not be able to make use of low-energy photons; meanwhile the efficiency of barely uphill reactions will also suffer due to the generation of heat from high-energy light. This relationship can be easily calculated, using a few simplifying assumptions, and is depicted in Fig. 3 and 4. In both figures, the wavelength that corresponds to onset of absorption is assumed to be a step function from zero to infinite absorbance at the specified value, as though an ideal semiconductor were being employed: in Fig. 3, this onset is assumed to be equal to ΔG° in the top line, as if the perfect photocatalyst absorbed all photons with energies greater than the required value, and converted them into chemical bonds with unity quantum yield; for the bottom blue line (again in Fig. 3), the absorption is held at a constant difference of 0.6 eV above the value of ΔG°, for a more realistic maximum efficiency that one might hope to achieve. (The minimum driving force needed to induce an outer-sphere charge transfer at an appreciable rate is around 300 mV; because two such transfers must occur for each absorbed photon – one between the starting material and each catalyst – 600 mV of extra potential is conservatively required.) Finally, in Fig. 4, the absorption onset is completely separated from ΔG° in the form of a contour plot, such that energy losses can be accounted for by the reader's method of preference.
It is notable in Fig. 4 that there is a distinct correlation between ΔG° and how sensitive the efficiency is toward losses, or the difference between absorption onset and ΔG°; namely, that overall efficiency becomes more sensitive to these losses as ΔG° increases. The physical implication of this trend is important: for a given, arbitrary power efficiency target, 5% for instance, a chemist can get away with much poorer photocatalysis by driving a ΔG° = 0.3 eV reaction (absorption must start ≥ 660 nm, yielding 1.61 eV to drive photophysical and catalytic processes), than by realizing a ΔG° = 2.5 eV reaction (absorption onset must be ≥ 415 nm, leaving only 0.51 eV for catalysis). Both of the above described, hypothetical reactions store 5% of solar energy into chemical bonds, but the former is far more realistic than the latter.
Conversion candidates
When choosing a photosynthetic reaction for large scale pursuit, there are several concerns that the researcher will face. Foremost is the starting material's availability. While the uphill conversion of an expensive starting material might present a good proof-of-concept, its applicability would be restricted by supply. Second in importance is the energy requirement, ΔG°, of the reaction being considered. A simplified exposition of the reaction thermodynamics and their larger relevance can be found in the previous section. Finally, also important is the mechanistic complexity of the desired reaction. A plant's selective manufacture of sugars under ambient conditions directly from carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight is a synthetic marvel that chemists have little hope of duplicating on a reasonable time scale. In contrast, the cleavage of hydrochloric acid into its elemental constituents is logistically simple, and was accomplished decades ago using ultraviolet radiation.4
Dihydrogen from acids
In the photogeneration of dihydrogen gas from Brønsted–Lowry acids, a proton is reduced and the leftover conjugate base is oxidized. The reaction's success and scalability therefore strongly depend on the stability and abundance of said conjugate base. The most terrestrially abundant choices are silicates, fluoride, carboxylates, phosphate, sulfate, chloride, and bromide.5 Of these, those with the most promising natural reservoirs are chloride and bromide (specifically from seawater).
The respective thermodynamic requirements for converting hydrochloric and hydrobromic acids into hydrogen and the corresponding dihalogen are 63 and 50 kcal mol−1 in total, or 1.36 and 1.09 eV (913 and 1139 nm) for each of the two electrons that are transferred. These energies are very near the apex of power efficiency that a reaction can hope to achieve (21% for hydrochloric acid and 24% for hydrobromic, Fig. 3). At these wavelengths, the reactions' efficiencies are highly sensitive to heat losses: there is a roughly linear decline of 4.4% and 3.1% efficiency, respectively, for every 100 meV increase in the onset of photosensitization. A reaction that stores little energy per mole of product (HBr splitting) might be favored over its higher energy analogue (HCl splitting), if the operator only cares about combining hydrogen with oxygen to form water. More specifically, 540 meV less energy is required to generate dibromine than is needed to form dichlorine from the corresponding halides; this might mean being able to employ red light (620 nm, 2.00 eV), instead of requiring green or blue light (488 nm, 2.54 eV). However, on the suggested scale of these halogen-producing reactions, the amount of oxidant byproduct generated would necessitate the use of hydrogen/halogen fuel cells, for which the energy contained in the halogen becomes very important.
Photosynthesis to convert hydrobromic acid – or equivalently aqueous sodium bromide – is favored over that of hydrochloric acid both for the thermodynamic reason stated above, and because the oxidized product, elemental bromine, is more easily separated than chlorine from the reduced product, hydrogen gas. Mechanistically, oxidation of bromide is one of the simplest photochemical reactions imaginable; bromide coordinates well to most metal centers, whereas elemental bromine does not; only one electron needs to be transferred to or from each atom, allowing the simplest possible catalyst architectures; bromide salts are extremely water soluble, whereas elemental bromine is only 3% soluble by weight, a figure that diminishes with increasing ionic strength; finally, bromine is twice as dense as concentrated hydrobromic acid, and thrice as dense as pure water, aiding facile, continuous product trapping and removal. In practice, pioneers in this field find that liberation of the desired dihalogen is the challenging step in this reaction, justifying the choice of bromide over chloride starting material. Photocatalytic splitting of HBr has been achieved with 8.6% efficiency using solar radiation, in a photoelectrochemical cell prepared by Texas Instruments.6a–b On the molecular scale, progress has been made toward stoichiometric, photodriven, reductive elimination of the dihalogen from mono- and bimetallic halide complexes of rhodium, platinum, and gold.6c–h
Dihydrogen from carbon monoxide and water
The water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) has been considered as a photosynthetic pathway. Current industrial feedstocks of carbon monoxide are generated through (A) partial oxidation of coke at temperatures exceeding 800 °C, as well as (B) steam reforming of methane under similar conditions. While carbon monoxide may someday become viable through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide,7 its toxicity and price make photochemical water-gas shift an unlikely candidate for large scale hydrogen synthesis.
Photoconversion of carbon monoxide and water into hydrogen and carbon dioxide is uphill by only 14 kcal mol−1, or 0.31 eV (4075 nm) for each of the two electrons that are transferred. While this reaction is thermodynamically limited to a maximum of 16% power efficiency when driven by sunlight, this number is unusually forgiving of losses to heat. That is, as the onset of absorption departs vertically from the white “realism” line in Fig. 4, the initial drop in maximum efficiency for a process storing 0.31 eV per photon is only 0.2% per 100 meV that the onset moves away from the diagonal; in other words, the drop in efficiency is very slow along the vertical line ΔG° = 0.31 eV in Fig. 4. In short, the energy stored in this transformation is small, but the reaction is consequently very manageable.
The water-gas shift is mechanistically simplified by the difference in ligand competence between carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, as well as between water and hydrogen. That is, the reactants are both good ligands when compared to the products, and can thereby be brought into proximity while avoiding back-reaction. This was photocatalytically achieved decades ago using an aqueous iridium(III) diimine, cyclopentadienyl complex (structure shown in Fig. 5), exposed to 410 nm light under one atmosphere of carbon monoxide.8

C1 species from carbon dioxide and water
Carbon dioxide is the universal starting point for carbohydrate photosynthesis in nature, owing to its availability everywhere on Earth. Taking nature as an example, many researchers have considered the photoreduction of carbon dioxide to hydrogen-containing species, such as alcohols. While these product species have low power densities relative to liquid hydrocarbons, this obstacle might be overcome by the improving utility of direct fuel cells. For example, while gasoline contains twice the energy per gram as methanol, the efficiency of a combustion engine is half that of a direct methanol fuel cell. However, the technology for photosynthesizing alcohols and converting them back into electricity both need to improve drastically from today's state of the art, before industrially lucrative applications can be found. The two simplest, most mass-efficient ways to add energy to a molecule of carbon dioxide are (A) formation of carbon–hydrogen bonds, and to a lesser extent (B) removal of oxygen atoms. Conveniently, water has both the capacity to donate hydrogen and to accept oxygen, is present in large supply, and is also a unanimous precursor in natural photosynthesis.
There are many possible C1 products of carbon dioxide photoreduction. For simplicity, their thermodynamic characteristics are presented in Table 2, below. The efficiency sensitivities to changes in absorption onset are within 3.1% ± 0.1% per 100 meV, for all five of the described reactions.

Controlled electrocatalysis of the above reactions has proven to be an exceptional challenge, to mention nothing of photocatalysis. One obstacle is carbon dioxide's reluctance to act as a ligand, especially in the presence of water. Another problem is simply the number of directed electron transfers that are required. Successful photoreactions leading up to the syntheses described in Table 2 have thus far avoided using water as the reductant. That is, instead of evolving oxygen as a byproduct, these experiments employ sacrificial electron donors, primarily tertiary amines, with the intention of merging the two halves of the equation after they are individually optimized.9b The pioneering work in this field was the Tinnemans group's exploration of a cobalt macrocyclic complex (shown in Fig. 5), using tris-2,2′-dipyridyl ruthenium(II) as a photosensitizer. The observed products of this work were carbon monoxide and formic acid.9a
Dihydrogen from alcohols
Methanol is the least expensive alcohol on today's market, but its current method of manufacture, namely steam reforming of methane followed by a low temperature reverse reaction, renders it improvident as a fuel, let alone a fuel's precursor. Until a more economical, perhaps photodriven preparation is invented, methanol's potential as a photosynthetic precursor is restricted to that of a proof-of-concept, rather than a fuel source. A better option is ethanol, whose generation from biomass feedstocks has been extensively researched, owing to the sponsorship of its imbibing constituency. The expensive step of this process is the conversion of starch (cellulose) into maltose, allowing it to be further metabolized into ethanol and carbon dioxide by yeast. This malting procedure requires a special, expensive enzyme. However, the faculty for circumventing this obstacle is starting to become available, through direct fermentation of cellulose.10 If developed, this emerging technology has the potential to produce ethanol from biological waste – paper-based trash, sawdust, cornstalks, etc. – at prices that are competitive with gasoline. If this new feedstock materializes, ethanol may be able to serve as a pragmatic photosynthetic precursor.
Conversion of ethanol into acetaldehyde and hydrogen is thermodynamically uphill by only 24 kcal mol−1 total, or 0.53 eV (λ = 2329 nm) for each of the two electrons that are transferred, and is therefore well within the solar spectrum's energy allowance. At this wavelength, the power conversion efficiency of photosynthesis is limited to an intrinsic maximum of 23%, and drops by 2.5% for every 100 meV increase in the onset of absorbance (Fig. 3 and 4).
Thermal dehydrogenation of alcohols to form hydrogen alongside aldehydes/ketones/esters over nickel and copper catalysts has long been industrially important.11 Using ultraviolet radiation, this same reaction can be performed photocatalytically using titanium oxide, as well as assorted complexes of rhodium, tin, iridium, platinum, palladium, and ruthenium.12 To date, no hydrogen has been generated from alcohols using longer, visible wavelengths.
Dihydrogen from water
The earth's practically infinite and widely available supply of water makes this pathway toward solar fuel particularly attractive.
Conversion of one water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen (H2O → H2 + ½O2) is uphill by 57 kcal mol−1, or 1.23 eV (λ = 1008 nm) for each electron transfer. At this wavelength, solar hydrogen could be produced from water with a maximum thermodynamic power efficiency of 23%, a figure that drops off sharply with losses to heat (3.4% drop for every 100 meV increase in absorption onset).
While occasional instances of photoelectrochemical water splitting claim high efficiencies for solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion (in excess of 10%), figures below 5% are more commonly achieved, often employing a potential bias.13 Similarly, reports of successful photocatalytic water-splitting have employed wavelengths starting at 420 nm,14 limiting the overall solar power efficiency to ≤ 2.7%. Finally, in the specific area of molecular photocatalytic water splitting, a functional system has yet to be developed. The challenge behind splitting water lies primarily in the oxidative half reaction, rather than in the reduction of protons. While many examples exist for homogeneous photocatalytic hydrogen generation that are unequivocally driven by visible light,15 instances of photodriven oxygen evolution are scarce,16 and involve the use of strong oxidants like lead(IV), cerium(IV), cobalt(III), or persulfate. In most cases, oxygen evolution is investigated under dark conditions, using sacrificial electron acceptors to drive the reaction. Much work is being performed to understand and improve this half of the total water cleavage reaction.17 The structures of three recently discovered molecular catalysts, as well as the Meyer group's well characterized ruthenium dimer,17c–e are shown in Fig. 6. The three more recently discovered species are likewise milestones in the field: the diruthenium complex synthesized by the Thummel group is the first example of an electronically tunable water oxidation catalyst, and its longevity for sustained oxygen evolution is without precedent from a molecular species;17n,p the cyclometalated iridium(III) complex possesses equally tunable electronics, and is the first example of both a monometallic and iridium-based molecular species with high activity toward oxygen evolution catalysis;17s finally, the active polyoxometalate reported by the Bonchio and Hill groups introduces a new class of oxidation catalyst, devoid of oxidation-susceptible organic content, and likewise exhibits impressive catalytic activity and longevity.17q,r Further approaches have met a great deal of success in mimicking nature's water oxidation catalyst with manganese oxo-complexes.17t In short, the combination of water's availability, hydrogen's cleanliness, and existing precedence for this type of visible-light induced artificial photosynthesis from solid-state catalytic systems,14 make water photolysis a particularly promising, challenging, as well as exciting new direction of research.

General tactics, with water splitting as a representative example
As with any new field of science, there are infinite avenues by which one may begin to explore a given photosynthetic problem. As a working example, the challenge of using solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen has attracted scientists and inventors from all subfields of chemistry, chemical engineering, molecular biology, materials science, physics, and environmental studies; from these diverse groups, a myriad of strategies have been employed.18 There are nevertheless a few necessities that all water-splitting endeavors have in common: (A) a photosensitive material, something that converts light into electrical or electrochemical potential; (B) reduction of water/protons into dihydrogen; (C) oxidation of water/hydroxide to form dioxygen.
Top-down approaches
The most intuitive starting point for generating solar hydrogen is to separate the above mentioned components macroscopically, exemplified by photoelectrochemical or electrolysis cells. The primary advantage in this approach is the degree of control that the operator maintains over the chemistry in solution; charge transfer to/from the appropriate catalysts is guaranteed, making back reactions highly unlikely. Put another way, this type of top-down, “brute force” approach may lack elegance, but is guaranteed to work. Another advantage is system stability. Silicon panels and bulk electrodes do not possess the freedom of motion or the surface exposure that would otherwise permit material degradation, as in the case of colloidal or dissolved species. Finally, production of hydrogen and oxygen at different electrodes allows them to be collected individually, instead of requiring downstream membrane- or chromatography-based separation.
One disadvantage of the top-down approach is power inefficiency. Most commercial cells use elemental silicon as their absorbing layer, and achieve open-circuit potentials in excess of 0.6 volts, although power is maximized at 0.35–0.50 volts, with power efficiencies of roughly 20%.19 At these operating potentials, 3–4 cells in series (in other words, 3–4 photons) are required to achieve even the thermodynamic minimum of water splitting. More realistically, 5–6 cells in series would be needed to achieve the 2 volts that are used by electrolysis plants, overcoming the overpotentials that are needed to store 1.23 volts into chemical bonds. At 2 volts, low temperature electrolyzers operate with a maximum current efficiency (½H2 per electron) of 85%.20 Overall, this limits the maximum light-to-hydrogen power efficiency to around 10%. Another drawback to using bulk electrodes is atom inefficiency. If one wishes to avoid expensive vacuum techniques, then a minimal possible material thickness of ∼1 μm would yield 0.06% atom efficiency for a solid-state catalyst. Finally, there are diffusional constraints to consider. Without constant stirring or convection, pH gradients quickly develop at the electrodes, reducing the rate of reaction.
Bottom-up approaches
Another approach to photosynthesis starts from the molecular scale. In solution-based systems, some disadvantages of heterogeneous reactions are remedied, whereas some of the benefits are lost. In particular, homogeneous catalysis leads to near-unity atom efficiency, avoids detrimental pH gradients, and has the potential to create a dihydrogen bond using only two photons, instead of the six to eight that are needed with silicon photovoltaics.19 However, it is chemically much harder to control what happens on the molecular scale in solution chemistry, especially when the back- and side-reactions are thermodynamically downhill, as is the case in photosynthesis. For primarily this reason, chemists have yet to devise a working, molecular approach to photosynthetic water splitting, and systems involving half-reactions (water oxidation or reduction) are plagued by photosensitizer or catalyst degradation.15p,21
Microheterogeneous systems, those that employ colloids as catalysts or sensitizers, lie somewhere between the two extremes mentioned above. While they literally belong to the bottom-up camp, their atom efficiencies are poor by the standards of molecular catalysis. Nevertheless, they exceed those of electrodes by far, and like molecular systems, colloids can avoid the mass-transport limitations suffered by truly heterogeneous reactions.
Figures of merit
In total water photolysis, the profitability of a working scheme is determined very simply by revenue minus cost. While there exist examples of heterogeneous and microheterogeneous catalysts that split water with visible light,14 this challenge remains unmet by homogeneous photochemistry. Nevertheless, there exist examples in which visible light drives the oxidative and reductive half-reactions thereof.15,16 The questions then arises, what is the measure of success for a partially functional system?
Reaction rate
Perhaps the most fundamental measure of a catalyst's performance is its ability to quickly cycle. For a dark reaction, one involving only electron transfers and chemical rearrangements, this quality is expressed in terms of a system's “turnover frequency,” or number of cycles achievable per unit time. For a reaction involving light, this idea becomes slightly more complicated due to this newly imposed limit. That is, while a dark reaction's turnover frequency can be arbitrarily fast, the speed of a light-driven system is constrained by the incoming flux of photons. Consequently, the turnover frequency in such systems is no longer reported as an absolute number, but rather as a unitless value that represents the actual turnover frequency, normalized by the intensity of light.
This can be done in two distinct ways. First, one can simply divide the reaction rate by the number of photons hitting the sample per second. This value is referred to as quantum efficiency, and literally represents the system's overall capacity for driving the reaction with whatever light the researcher provides. Second, the rate can be normalized by the number of photons absorbed by the sample per unit time, instead of the total incoming flux. In this case the measurement is referred to as quantum yield, and serves as an indicator for the performance of the reaction's remaining downhill tumble after photoexcitation. While these figures are unitless, and referred to as “efficiency” and “yield,” they can nevertheless be thought of as normalized rates (i.e. rate constants) for a photoreaction, and are both commonly found in photochemistry-related literature.
Power efficiency
Even while producing hydrogen or oxygen by virtue of a sacrificial electron donor or acceptor, the power efficiency of the reaction can be calculated by taking into account ΔG of the sacrificial species. As an example, Curtin et al. performed an experiment in which they used a very simple, three component system for hydrogen generation under 465 nm light that employs many different iridium complexes as photosensitizers ([Ir(fmppy)2bpy]+ is used here as a median example, fmppy = 4′-fluoro,5-methyl,2-phenylpyridine, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, structure shown in Fig. 7), K2PtCl4 as a catalyst, and triethylamine as a sacrificial reductant.15r Oxidation of triethylamine at pH 12 is reported to occur at 0.93 volts vs. NHE,22 and reduction of water on platinum under identical conditions occurs at −0.76 volts. Meanwhile the photosensitizer (PS) gives off orange emission at 2.23 eV in going from PS* back to PS. The reduction potential in generating PS− from PS is −1.15 volts. Finally, the reduction potential of PS* to form PS− is 1.08 volts. The mechanism by which these values come into play is depicted in Fig. 7. After excitation of [Ir(fmppy)2bpy]+ by a 465 nm photon, the oxidation of triethylamine is driven by the favorable reduction of [Ir(fmppy)2bpy]+* to form TEA+ and [Ir(fmppy)2bpy](0). From here, reduction of protons on platinum to form hydrogen gas is driven by the spontaneous oxidation of [Ir(fmppy)2bpy](0), thereby reforming [Ir(fmppy)2bpy]+ and completing the catalytic cycle. The overall energy yield for a successful cycle, given by the ratio of energies stored and absorbed, is therefore 65%. The PS has an absorption extinction coefficient of 597 M−1 cm−1 at the employed 465 nm wavelength. When multiplied by the employed concentration and path-length, the resulting absorbance value is 1.79, for 98% absorption of the 500 mW LEDs that were used in the study. The maximum quantum yield for turning those absorbed photons into dihydrogen bonds is reported to be 11%.15r The overall power efficiency, from LED photons to hydrogen produced, is therefore 7.2%. This figure should be calculable for any photosynthetic system. It thus presents a common context for comparison among seemingly diverse systems.
 Fig. 7  Catalytic hydrogen production cycle for a system containing [Ir(fmppy)2bpy]+ (structure shown on the right), K2PtCl4, and TEA at a pH of 12. Overall, ΔG ≈ −0.9 eV. All potentials are vs. NHE. 
Photocatalytic stability
While minimizing the manufacture cost of the components in a hydrogen evolving system is important, it is not sufficient. A very cheap photocatalyst that splits water stoichiometrically (or nearly so), is extremely expensive to implement due to the quantities required. It is far preferable to use catalysts whose material cost is ten times higher, but which provide significant catalytic stability. This endurance is typically measured in terms of turnover numbers (TON), or the average number of times that a component cycles prior to system collapse. For hydrogen generation, TON is usually measured by the electrons that are passed to hydrogen, rather than the evolution of hydrogen molecules themselves. That is, one half the number of H2 molecules that are generated per catalyst or photosensitizer molecule. As shown in Fig. 8, at least millions of turnovers are needed for even the cheapest water-splitting catalysts to be competitive with conventional power. While a complete, molecular water photolysis system has yet to be developed, the largest reported TONs for molecular photosensitizers in visible light driven, hydrogen-generating half reactions number around ten thousand, and cost around $15–20 per gram (depending on the fluctuating price of ruthenium and cobalt metals, and neglecting the chemist's salary).15n Three orders of magnitude improvement of this system's stability, as well as the capacity for water oxidation, are yet needed before such a system could reasonably be considered as a power source.
 Fig. 8  The above prices for one person's daily hydrogen requirement are calculated using the United States' current per capita energy time-averaged expenditure of 10 kWatts. The energy cost is plotted as a function of a hydrogen-producing reaction's total catalytic turnovers, for systems whose limiting components are of the specified material costs (assumes 100% hydrogen-to-electricity conversion efficiency). 
Simplicity
The cost of catalyst/photosensitizer manufacture is the first concern that a chemist will face in large scale production of hydrogen. Two factors control the price of making a catalyst: The intrinsic cost of a material, which refers to the use of uncommon elements (especially ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, tellurium, rhenium, osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold), is often unavoidable without completely changing the nature of catalysis. The extrinsic cost, which refers to that of the catalyst's preparation (whether synthesis or processing), strongly favors simple catalyst architectures, cheap solvents, and scalable synthetic pathways.
Conclusions
In the expansive field of solar conversion, thermodynamics is the universal language. The purpose of this article has been to clarify this common context, through which the diverse subdisciplines of artificial photosynthesis and photovoltaics are compared. Towards this end, the generalized efficiency restrictions on both light absorption and energy storage have been expounded, the analogous constraints for several individual photosynthetic strategies have been stated, the advantages of molecular and macroscopic approaches have been discussed, and key figures of merit have been indicated. It was found that the maximum possible sunlight-to-fuel efficiency that can be achieved by a one photon per electron approach to artificial photosynthesis is 26%, assuming a realistic limit of 0.3 volts heat losses per charge transfer. This performance can only be achieved by reactions whose photoproducts are uphill by ΔG values between 0.75 and 0.95 eV, when normalized by the required number of photons.

 	Fig. 1  The noontime, equinoxial solar density spectrum at 37 °S latitude (ASTM, Air Mass 1.5) is drawn in red, in units of photon flux (top) and intensity (bottom). In blue is shown the integral, in various units, of the corresponding solar spectrum in each graph.	 

 	Fig. 2  Greatly simplified energy diagram for a catalytic photoreaction sensitized by a phosphorescent material (PS). ΔG° and the onset of absorption are highlighted for clarity.	 

 	Fig. 3  The maximum light-to-fuel efficiency (blue, right) that can be achieved by a photosynthetic reaction whose ΔG° corresponds to the x-axis, with a 0 volt (top) and 0.3 volt (bottom) driving potential for each of the two charge transfers that follow photon absorption, is plotted with the solar intensity spectrum (red, left).	 

 	Fig. 4  Optimal power efficiency is plotted as a function of both a photoreaction's intrinsic ΔG° and the photosensitizer's onset of absorption. The white curve is a constant 0.6 eV under the diagonal, and represents the estimated minimum driving energy required for a spontaneous, electrocatalytic reaction (0.3 volts above the thermodynamic requirement for each of the reductive and oxidative processes). A blowup of the region relevant to practical systems is shown on the right.	 

 	Fig. 5  (A, left) Iridium complex used by the Ziessel group to photocatalytically achieve the water-gas shift reaction at one atmosphere under 410 nm irradiation. (B, right) Cobalt-based macrocyclic compound studied by the Tinnemans group in homogeneous carbon dioxide photoreduction to carbon monoxide and formate.

 	Fig. 6  (A, top left) The ruthenium “blue dimer,” first investigated for water oxidation by the Meyer group in 1982; (B, top right) electronically tunable diruthenium complex reported for its oxygen evolution activity by the Thummel group in 2005; (C, bottom left) similarly tunable cyclometalated iridium catalyst explored by the Bernhard group in 2008; (D, bottom right) completely inorganic, tetraruthenium oxo-adamantane containing catalyst studied by the Bonchio and Hill groups in 2008.	 

 	Fig. 7  Catalytic hydrogen production cycle for a system containing [Ir(fmppy)2bpy]+ (structure shown on the right), K2PtCl4, and TEA at a pH of 12. Overall, ΔG ≈ −0.9 eV. All potentials are vs. NHE.	 

 	Fig. 8  The above prices for one person's daily hydrogen requirement are calculated using the United States' current per capita energy time-averaged expenditure of 10 kWatts. The energy cost is plotted as a function of a hydrogen-producing reaction's total catalytic turnovers, for systems whose limiting components are of the specified material costs (assumes 100% hydrogen-to-electricity conversion efficiency).
