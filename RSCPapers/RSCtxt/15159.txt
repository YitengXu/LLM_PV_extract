    , Accepted 9th May 2016First published on 17th May 2016AbstractIdentification of an appropriate anode material is one of the major challenges for rechargeable Na-ion batteries. Layered MoO3 is a potential alternative as it can reversibly store large amounts of sodium. However, MoO3 is a poor electronic conductor and undergoes large volume changes during repeated cycling. Ultrathin nanosheets of 1–3 bilayers of MoO3 are synthesized starting from the oxidation of few-layer MoS2 nanosheets. The MoO3 nanosheets are subsequently chemically tagged with optimum amounts of rGO leading to the formation of a 3D MoO3–rGO composite. The MoO3–rGO composite exhibits remarkable electrochemical stability, cyclability and high rate capability over a wide range of operating currents (0.05–1 C). This simple and novel material design strategy of MoO3–rGO provides the most optimum condition for buffering the volume changes during repeated cycling and provides facile pathways for Na-ion and electron transport in MoO3.
Introduction
The demand for rechargeable batteries is on the rise for vehicular transportation as well as for large stationary energy storage applications such as integration with the electricity grid as well as renewables such as solar, wind and electric power grids.1 Rechargeable batteries based on lithium such as lithium-ion batteries have already been demonstrated as very promising energy storage systems for various portable applications because of their high specific energy and power density.2 However, the global natural resources of lithium are very limited and hence for widespread usage rechargeable battery technologies based on lithium will be very cost intensive. This short-coming has motivated many researchers worldwide to shift emphasis from lithium to sodium based rechargeable batteries. Sodium is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and expected to be more cost effective compare to lithium and lithium-based batteries. However, these advantages are easily offset by the inferior electrochemical properties of sodium compared to lithium. The energy density of Na cannot reach that of Li as Na is more than three times heavier than Li. Additionally, the standard electrochemical potential of Na (2.71 V) is lower than that of Li (3.04 V) with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).3 The larger size of Na-ion (ionic radius = 1.02 Å) compared to Li-ion (0.76 Å) leads to slower diffusion kinetics and large volume change leading to gradual pulverization of the electrode material. Thus, there are several challenges that need to be overcome for the development of high performance sodium ion batteries (NaBs).4
Graphite, which is employed as the anode in commercial lithium-ion batteries, has been shown to be generally unsuitable for Na-ion batteries.5 In fact, other forms of carbon and even non-carbonaceous materials have been demonstrated as more suitable anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Nanostructures of these materials have been demonstrated as anode materials in NaBs.6 In this context, nanostructures of two dimensional materials especially extended carbon structures (e.g. graphene-based), oxides and sulphides are very promising owing to their attractive physical properties which are useful in diverse fields such as electronics, catalysis and biological applications. These have also been extensively used in lithium and sodium-batteries.7 Orthorhombic α-MoO3, which is one of the three polymorphs of molybdenum trioxide (the other two being monoclinic β-MoO3 and hexagonal h-MoO3), has a layered structure consisting of double-layers of MoO6 octahedra linked by edge and corner sharing along the (001) and (100) axes and by weak van der Waals forces along the (010) direction. Owing to this attractive structure and chemical stability, α-MoO3 has been demonstrated as a potential alternative anode for lithium-ion batteries. The theoretical lithium storage capacity value of MoO3 is very high, equal to 1117 mA h g−1,8 being three times higher than that of graphite (372 mA h g−1).9 As Na+ intercalation properties are very similar to those of Li+, MoO3 will expectedly be equally promising for NaBs. However, the poor electronic conductivity of MoO3 and sluggish kinetics of ions may detrimentally affect its electrochemical performance especially in NaBs. To enhance the kinetics of Na+ in MoO3, lower dimension nanostructures are expected to be very promising. In this context, several well-defined MoO3 nanostructures, e.g. nanoparticles,10 nanorods,11 nanobelts,12 and nanosheets,13 have been developed. We present here a composite comprising of ultrathin nanosheets of few-layer MoO3 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a potential high rate capability anode for NaBs. The electrochemical performance of the few-layer MoO3–rGO composites is studied vis-à-vis the few-layer MoO3 (i.e. without any rGO). The main motivation here is to develop a MoO3-based anode material providing fast Na+ diffusion pathways and displaying high electronic conductivity. All these factors will eventually lead to a NaB anode with high degree of cyclability at widely varying current densities.
Experimental section
All the chemicals used in the synthesis are highly pure and purchased from commercial sources. Few-layer MoS2 nanosheets are prepared using molybdic acid and thiourea (1:48) under a high purity N2 flow rate of 25 mL min−1 in a tubular furnace at 500 °C.14
Preparation of graphene oxide
Graphene oxide (GO) is prepared by the modified Hummers method.15 In a typical synthesis concentrated H2SO4 (75 mL) is slowly added to a beaker containing synthetic graphite powder (1.5 g) which is kept in an ice bath. NaNO3 (1.5 g) is then added slowly and the mixture is stirred for 15 min until it becomes homogeneous. Following slow addition of 10 g of KMnO4, the mixture is transferred to an oil bath maintained at a temperature of 40 °C and stirred for an hour. To the resulting dark brown product, 75 mL of water is added and the mixture is stirred at 75 °C. Finally, 15 mL of H2O2 (30%) in 150 mL of deionized water is added to the reaction mixture. The color of the suspension changes from brown to yellow. The as-obtained GO suspension is centrifuged, washed several times and dialyzed in deionized water for 24 h.16 The dialyzed product is freeze dried under vacuum in a lyophilizer.
Preparation of few-layer MoO3 nanosheets and its composites with reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
Few-layer MoO3 nanosheets (about 2–3 sheets) are synthesized by oxidation of few-layer MoS2 at 500 °C for 15 min in air.13
MoO3–rGO composites are prepared using a hydrothermal method. Briefly, few-layer MoO3 is dispersed in the GO suspension with the corresponding weight ratio of 5%, 10% and 20%. The dispersion is stirred and sonicated for 1 h until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. The as-formed few-layer MoO3–rGO suspension is transferred to a Teflon lined autoclave and heated to 180 °C for 4 h. In the course of the reaction the GO is reduced on MoO3 nanosheets and forms a MoO3–rGO nanocomposite. The as-obtained MoO3–rGO composite is freeze dried under vacuum in a lyophilizer for 24 h and is used for further characterizations and battery testing.
Instrumentation and characterization
The crystal structure is determined by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) in a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation with accelerating voltage 40 kV and current 30 mA. The nanosheets are imaged using scanning electron microscopy with a Nova NanoSEM 600 FESEM equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis system (FEI Company). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images are recorded with a JEOL JEM 3010 microscope, fitted with a Gatan CCD camera operating at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging in tapping mode is carried out using a Bruker Innova instrument. Raman spectra are recorded in the backscattering geometry using a 632 nm HeNe laser with a Jobin Yvon LabRam HR spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGAs) are carried out in an oxygen atmosphere with a Metler Toledo TGA-850 TG analyzer. Infrared spectra are recorded in a Bruker FT-IR spectrometer in ATR mode.
Electrode preparation and electrochemical measurement
The electrochemical stability of few-layer MoO3 and MoO3–rGO composites is tested for sodium-ion battery applications. Sodium metal is used as both the reference and counter electrode. The working electrode is fabricated using 95 wt% of active material and 5 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a binder in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution. The slurry is uniformly distributed on the copper current collector and dried at 120 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. Swagelok™ type half cells are assembled in an argon-filled glove box (H2O < 0.1 ppm). 1 M NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, and diethyl carbonate in the volume ratio of 0.45:0.45:0.1 is employed as an electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling (Arbin) studies are carried out at various current densities in the voltage ranging from 0.05 to 3 V (Na|Na+). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is performed at a scan rate of 0.005 mV s−1. The ac-impedance (Alpha, Novocontrol) measurements are performed at the charged state (2 V) in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an alternating potential amplitude of 5 mV. All the electrochemical experiments are performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
The schematic representation of the adopted synthesis procedures for the few-layer MoO3 and its composites with rGO is shown in Scheme 1. As the MoO3–(10%)-rGO composite displayed the best half-cell electrochemical performance among the various MoO3–(x%)-rGO compositions, all structural and electrochemical performances discussed here are with regard to the MoO3–(10%)-rGO sample only. The phase and composition of bulk and few-layer α-MoO3 are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction. Fig. 1a shows the PXRD patterns of few-layer and bulk MoO3. All the diffraction lines can be indexed to orthorhombic α-MoO3 with the space group Pbnm, and lattice constants a = 3.962 Å, b = 13.858 Å, c = 3.697 Å (JCPDS file no. 05-0508). The lines are less intense and broader in the case of few-layer MoO3 compared to the bulk, thus convincingly strongly confirming the presence of few layer MoO3. The intensity of (0l0) lines in the case of few-layer MoO3 is very low indicating a lesser degree of stacking in this direction. The findings from XRD thus confirm the synthesis strategy involving the oxidation of MoS2 nanosheets at 500 °C under a laboratory air atmosphere to MoO3. Under these conditions oxygen deficiencies can be ruled out as there are copious amounts of oxygen available for uptake to fill up any oxygen deficiencies. The 2D morphology of few-layer MoO3 nanosheets is visualized in the TEM image as shown in Fig. 1b. These nanosheets are transparent indicating that there exist only thin layers with a thickness of few nanometers and with a large lateral dimension in the μm range. Fig. 1c shows the high-resolution TEM image obtained on an FEI Titan (cube) 80–300 kV aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope. Nanosheets show the layer spacing to be 0.36 and 0.39 nm corresponding to (001) and (100) planes of MoO3 respectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern along the [010] direction (Fig. 1d and S1†) consists of a highly ordered homogeneous diffraction pattern which signifies that the nanosheets are ordered in the orthorhombic lattice and grow along (100) and (001) normal to (010). This finding is thus consistent with XRD results. Fig. 2a and b show the FESEM images of few-layer MoO3. The nanosheets appear to possess a quadrilateral sheet-like shape with a lateral dimension of 1–4 μm. Further, some nanosheets partially overlap with each other. To ascertain the thickness and number of layers, AFM is very suitable due to its high spatial resolution. AFM images of MoO3 nanosheets on a Si substrate and with the corresponding height profile resolved in the tapping mode are shown in Fig. 2c and d. The sheets are observed to be very thin with thicknesses of 1.6 and 3.8 nm. This corresponds to 1 to 3 bilayers (thickness of a single bilayer nanosheet ≈ 1.4 nm)17 of MoO3 along the (0l0) direction with lateral dimensions of 1 and 10 μm.

The composition and thermal stability of MoO3–rGO composites are studied by thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 3a). All samples are preheated to 100 °C in an oven to remove adsorbed moisture prior to the measurement. The measurements are carried out under O2 flow (20 mL min−1) from 30 to 950 °C at the rate of 3 °C min−1. Few-layer MoO3 shows no weight loss and is highly stable between 300 and 600 °C. The composites on the other hand, show a weight loss of 5%, 10% and 18% from 200 to 450 °C. The weight loss is due to rGO reaching the deflagration point and decomposing to carbon soot. Weight loss at temperatures above 700 °C corresponds to the decomposition of MoO3 which is observed in all cases. XPS analyses are carried out to ascertain the elemental compositions and bonding characteristics between few-layer MoO3 and rGO in the composites. Core-level XP spectra of the MoO3–rGO composite are shown in Fig. 3b–d. The peaks centered at 232.5 and 235.8 eV correspond to Mo(VI) 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 (Fig. 3b) and is in good agreement with the MoO3 binding energies. The oxygen 1s core-level signal (Fig. 3c) too is deconvoluted into two peaks at 530.7 and 532.65 eV corresponding to the Mo–O bond of MoO3 and C–O bond respectively. High resolution spectra of carbon 1s (Fig. 3d) are also deconvoluted into two peaks, one centered at 284.4 and the other at 285.5 eV corresponding to CC and C–O bonds respectively. XPS study thus confirms that MoO3 is bonded to rGO through the Mo–O–C linkage at the interface.18 Elemental mappings of the MoO3–rGO composite and MoO3 obtained using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) in FESEM are shown in Fig. 4 and S2.† The mapping reveals homogeneity of the composite which is supported via the uniform distribution of molybdenum, oxygen and carbon. FESEM and TEM images also reveal the uniformity and homogeneity of the MoO3–rGO composites (Fig. S3 and S4†). The SAED pattern of the composites (Fig. S4b and d†) shows spots as well as a ring pattern. The spots correspond to orthorhombic α-MoO3 and the rings correspond to graphene. MoO3–rGO composites are further characterized by Raman and FTIR spectroscopies which show characteristic bands corresponding to both MoO3 and graphene (Fig. S5 and S6†).

Fig. 5a shows representative charge and discharge profiles of the MoO3–(10 wt%)-rGO composite at a current density of C/20 (0.09 mA) for the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 10th, 50th and 100th cycles in the voltage range 0.1–3.0 V. All capacities reported in the manuscript for the composite are calculated based on the total weight of MoO3 and rGO. Although the MoO3–(10 wt%)-rGO composite shows a high 1st cycle discharge capacity of 1061.2 mA h g−1, the corresponding 1st cycle charge capacity is only 934.4 mA h g−1. This amounts to a 1st cycle coulombic efficiency of 88%. The loss in charge capacity can be attributed to the disconnection between the MoO3 nanosheets which can result from some degree of disintegration of the nanosheets caused due to the volume changes associated with the alloying reaction.19 During the first discharge, the potential drops rapidly until it reaches the plateaus at around 2.2 V (narrow) and 0.5 V (wide). Following the wide plateau at 0.5 V the voltage decreases continuously to 0.01 V. Similar voltage profiles were also previously reported in the case of lithium intercalation.20 The sodium-ion intercalation reaction can be divided into two regions: region-1 (i.e. above 1.5 V) can be attributed to the insertion of Na+ ions into the interlayer spacing between the Mo–O octahedron layers. As the potential decreases to the region 2 (i.e. below 1.5 V), a wide plateau develops at about 0.5 V followed by a sloping profile (below 0.3 V). The wide plateau is due to the Na+ uptake for the complete conversion reaction and the sloped profile is due to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The overall reaction for few-layer MoO3 nanosheets with sodium can be expressed as(Voltage > 1.5 V): MoO3 + xNa+ + xe− → NaxMoO3 (x ≈ 1.2)(Voltage < 0.5 V): NaxMoO3 + (6 − x)Na+ + (6 − x)e− → Mo + 3Na2O

During the 1st cycle of sodium insertion, the few-layer nanosheets of MoO3 undergo an irreversible structural change from the α-phase to an amorphous phase followed by a conversion reaction to form Na2O and Mo metal.8 Preliminary investigation using ex situ XRD of the electrode material following the 1st discharge cycling shows lines corresponding to both Mo and Na2O (Fig. S8†). On charging, a plateau at about 1.1 V is observed. Following this plateau, the profile does not exhibit any plateaus and in general, the profile displays a fairly steep slope. The charging profile remains nearly the same till the 100th cycle with the expected decrease in the total capacity. In contrast, the plateau at around 0.5 V becomes narrower from the 1st to the 2nd discharge profile and remains nearly the same till the 100th cycle. The observations from the galvanostatic cycling correspond with the cyclic voltammetry results (Fig. S7†).19 The cycling behaviour of few-layer MoO3 and MoO3–(10 wt%)-rGO composites with Na/Na+ is illustrated in Fig. 5b. Compared to few-layer MoO3, the few-layer MoO3–(10 wt%)-rGO composite shows much higher specific capacity and excellent cyclability. This is also true for other rGO fractions in MoO3 (Fig. S9†). The remarkable electrochemical performance of MoO3–(10 wt%)-rGO compared to MoO3 is attributed to a combination of both the MoO3 nanostructure as well as due to the presence of rGO. The rGO forms a 3D network of electrical conduits between the MoO3 nanosheets which provide facile electron pathways for the electrochemical reaction to occur efficiently and also transport charge to the current collector. In the present study, 10 wt% of rGO is found to be the optimum amount for reversible cyclability over 100 cycles of charge and discharge.
In addition to the requirement of an efficient electron percolation process, the nanosheet morphology of MoO3 is observed to be highly effective in optimizing the large volume change observed during repeated sodium intercalation and deintercalation.21 The spatial configuration of the MoO3 nanosheets with an optimum amount of rGO minimizes the cracks and the loss in electronic contact between the RGO and the electroactive material. With repeated cycling the coulombic efficiency increased to 99.8% in the 15th cycle and remained stable at this value till 100 cycles. The capacity also showed a similar trend and at the end of 100 cycles is 665 mA h g−1. The MoO3–(10 wt%)-rGO composite also shows very good rate capability in the current density range C/20–1 C. At 1 C, the MoO3–(10 wt%)-rGO showed a capacity of 330 mA h g−1. With decrease in the value of the current, the capacities are again retained (Fig. 5c). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. 5d) also clearly show that the charge transfer resistance decreases following the first discharge.
Conclusions
We have successfully demonstrated here that a few-layer MoO3–rGO composite has considerable potential as a high performance anode material for Na-ion batteries. The optimal 3D configuration of 2D-MoO3 and rGO is essentially due to Mo–O–C linkages between MoO3 and rGO. The spatial configuration not only aids in suppressing the mechanical instabilities of MoO3 taking place during repeated cycling but also provides facile transport pathways for both electrons and Na-ions leading to an efficient and stable electrochemical reaction. The amount of rGO in the composite is crucial, as this directly ascertains the structural stability and electrochemical performance of the MoO3–rGO composite. The novel design of the 3D-composite comprising of a 2D-electroactive compound and its integration with an optimum amount of an extended carbon structure (1D, 2D) is expected to pave way for the design of many more 2D-electroactive materials based 3D-composites for prospective applications in sodium-ion batteries.
