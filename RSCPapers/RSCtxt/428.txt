    , Accepted 9th November 2010First published on 23rd December 2010AbstractA V2O5 nanobelt array has been designed and prepared on a conductive substrate for the first time. The synthesis strategy is based on the hydrogen bonding action between the functionalized surface of a Ti substrate and the earlier-formed V2O5·xH2O nanoseeds, and 1-dimensional (1-D) growth property of V2O5·xH2O. The as-prepared V2O5 nanobelt array exhibits a greatly enhanced performance in Li-ion batteries as the cathode and anode; meanwhile, the enhancement mechanism is presented, which is not only important to design functional materials in Li-ion batteries, but also extendable to other systems' design and fabrication.
Introduction
The pursuit of low-cost, safe, sustainable with high energy and power densities, and highly cyclable electrical devices has always been an attractive topic since mobile apparatuses, e.g. portable electronics and vehicle-carried electronic devices became necessary for daily life. Among all the electrical energy storage devices, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are attractive candidates due to their long cycle lives, abundant sources, safety and excellent energy storage efficiency in today's automated and electrified society.1–3 However, it is generally believed that Li-ion batteries exhibit high energy density at the cost of high power density, due to the occurrence of a rate-limiting process of ionic diffusion in/out of the electrode material in the bulk, which is totally different from supercapacitors.4 Hence in order to improve LIBs’ electrochemical performance, especially the rate capability, some crucial factors have to be considered, including the electrolyte’s percolation, ionic transport across the surfaces of the electrode materials, and the system’s electronic conductivity. Surrounding these propositions, so far carbon-coating, surface modification and template-assisted techniques have been developed.5–7 However, other promising approaches to significantly facilitate the rate capability in LIBs are seldom reported, which is due to the direct growth of active energy storage materials, in particular nanomaterials, on conductive substrates.8 By directly growing nanomaterials on conductive substrates, we can avoid some extra issues when assembling cells. For example, no binder will be needed and no ancillary material of carbon black will be required; meanwhile extra processes to prepare the electrodes will be saved. More importantly, through this way, the rate capability for LIBs can be greatly improved, because Li ions and electrons can migrate more rapidly, accompanying electrolyte penetration through the interval spaces among the nanostructures, which is also the rate-limiting process for both LIBs and supercapacitors.9 Very recently, we have successfully developed a mesoporous and single-crystal Co3O4 nanobelt array on a Ti substrate and realized its functionalization as a rate-accelerated anode in LIBs.8 Until now, few materials have been designed and directly grown onto conductive substrates via wet-chemistry for LIBs, apart from SnO2 and Co3O4.8,10–12V2O5, as one kind of transition-metal oxides, is well-known to be a promising candidate for LIBs, serving as either a cathode or anode due to its combined property of layered structure and high activity in its conversion reaction with Li+.13–15
In this report, a V2O5 nanobelt array on Ti substrate is introduced for the first time and its outstanding performance in LIBs has been investigated in detail. The rate capability observed in our research, to the best of our knowledge, is the best result so far for V2O5 nanostructures; meanwhile, the results achieved from the long cycling and high current densities' tests show us that the V2O5 nanobelt array exhibits wonderful cyclability and reversibility in both the cathode and anode. In our design, the synthesis strategy is rationally based on both the hydrogen bond action between the earlier-formed V2O5·xH2O nano-seeds and Ti substrate in acidic solution, and the one-dimensional (1-D) oriented growth property of V2O5·xH2O. In our previous results, a similar idea was applied to realize the fabrication of a Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O nanobelt array in a basic solution.8
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows a schematic illustration of the whole design thread. Normally across the Ti substrate's surface, one thin layer of TiO2 will be spontaneously formed once fresh Ti substrate is exposed to air and a large quantity of hydroxyl species are spread out in basic conditions. However, when the pH value switches inversely to below 7 in aqueous solution, these hydroxyl groups are supposed to absorb and trap hydrogen ions to form –OH2+ species, which can act as one constituent for some hydrated matters, e.g. V2O5·xH2O. So in the first stage of synthesis, the earlier formed V2O5·xH2O nanoparticles will be “attracted” to the Ti substrate viahydrogen bonding interactions, and directly bound to it. Then starting from these crystal seeds on Ti substrate, V2O5·xH2O nanostructures, nanobelts in our case, are motivated and evolved. After proper calcinations of the obtained V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array at 400 °C, a V2O5 nanobelt array is finally achieved.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration to introduce the rational synthesis of a V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array on a Ti substrate. Through the hydrogen bonding interaction between the –OH2+groups and the earlier-formed V2O5·xH2O nanoparticles, the V2O5·xH2O crystal seeds will be trapped and fixed onto the Ti substrate. Then relying on the 1-D oriented growth property of V2O5·xH2O, V2O5·xH2O nanobelts initiate from the Ti substrate and develop into a patterned array. After calcinations, the V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array is converted to a V2O5 nanobelt array. 

Fig. 1 shows us the overview on the V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array on the Ti substrate. Fig. 1a is the low-magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and frontal view to reveal that one kind of patterned architecture has been successfully fabricated. Some tiny honeycomb-like structures exhibit the novel morphology and an intriguing outline for the final sample. The locally magnified SEM image is shown in Fig. 1b, where we can detect that the inner diameter for an individual honeycomb cavity is around 3 μm and the wall thickness is about 150 nm. From Fig. 1b, some striped products inside the honeycomb imply that the final sample is most probably a hierarchical structure. Fig. 1c, the further magnified SEM image, verifies the suggestion about the hierarchical structure, from which some aggregated nanobelts, less than 100 nm in diameter, are distinguishable. These self-assembled nanobelts are densely aligned together, whereas some interval spaces are still available from Fig. 1c. The cross section viewed from Fig. 1d indicates the thickness of the hierarchical structure is approximately 3 μm. Furthermore, there are some void spaces obtainable under these densely aggregated architectures and the hierarchical structure is tightly bound to and developed from the Ti substrate as determined in Fig. 1d (the cross section image). The direct localization of the V2O5·xH2O on the Ti substrate and subsequent 1-D growth matches very well with our initial design. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 1e, besides the strong diffraction peaks from the Ti substrate, another distinct peak is believed to come from layered V2O5·xH2O.16 Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) corresponding to the honeycomb-like architecture is demonstrated in Fig. 1f and confirms the presence of vanadium.

(b) and (c) are the gradually enlarged SEM images to reveal the details of the honeycomb-like hierarchical architecture. (d) discloses the thickness of the V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array which falls into the range of 2.5–3 μm. XRD (e) and EDX (f) analyses confirm the existence of V2O5·xH2O on the Ti substrate. 

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the crystal structure of the V2O5·xH2O nanobelts (ESI†). The inter-lattice distance is calculated to be 0.21 nm, which is perfectly consistent with the inter-distance of the crystal plane (004) and further certifies the layered nature of the V2O5·xH2O nanobelts. Simultaneously, the continuous crystal structure also implies the single-crystal essence for the prepared V2O5·xH2O nanobelts. Fig. 2 is the TEM image used to discover one important property of the V2O5·xH2O, 1-D oriented growth. Actually, under the same synthetic conditions in our research, we can prepare V2O5·xH2O nanobelts on a large scale. As described in Fig. 2a, the TEM image shows us that uniform V2O5·xH2O nanobelts have been synthesized based on the same conditions to prepare V2O5·xH2O nanobelt arrays on Ti substrates, however, in this case no Ti substrate was used. From Fig. 2a, we can detect that, for most V2O5·xH2O nanobelts, they frequently exist in a bundle form. Upon focusing the electron beam onto several specific bundles (Fig. 2b), we can see that these bundles are normally composed of 2–5 pieces of nanobelts and that their diameters fall into the range of several hundred nanometers, whereas a single nanobelt can exhibit a diameter as low as 30 nm. Under some special situations, over 7 pieces of nanobelts parallel to each other are observed in the final products (Fig. 2c, 2d). In Fig. 2c, 7 uniform V2O5·xH2O nanobelts are strictly aligned together, solidly testifying the fact that, similar to Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O, V2O5·xH2O also exhibits the 1-D oriented growth property.8 After removing the V2O5·xH2O nanobelts from the Ti substrate, we can also detect that these nanobelts are bound to each other in a parallel manner, verifying the feasibility of the direct growth of nanomaterials onto substrates via rational design (Fig. 2d).8

TEM characterizations on determining the 1-D oriented growth property of the V2O5·xH2O nanobelts are presented. (a), (b) and (c) are the gradually magnified TEM images showing that the V2O5·xH2O bundles are actually composed of several V2O5·xH2O nanobelts parallel to each other. The diameter for each nanobelt is down to 30 nm. (d) TEM image used to describe the status of stacked nanobelts while still strictly remaining parallel to each other. 
According to the previous reports, some oxides can be synthesized on their native metal substrates, e.g.ZnO on Zn foil.17 Due to the ultra-long length of these ZnO nanowires and nanobelts, especially the high aspect ratio, the final sample usually exhibits micropatterned morphology after drying. The driving force for the micropattern's formation is the surface tension, which is also the exact reason to aggregate the as-prepared V2O5·xH2O nanobelts into honeycomb-like patterns in our research. However, so far only a few reports involving oxides' direct growth on the source-diverse conductive substrates have been given through wet-chemistry, including Co3O4, ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3, and SnO2.8,10–12,18–20 Consequently how to rationally design and directly fabricate 1-D nanostructured material arrays on substrates to form functional systems for the following applications still remains a great challenge. Our success in the synthesis of V2O5·xH2O nanobelt arrays on a Ti substrate enriches the research of this field and provides a good example to construct rationally functional systems.
After calcinations of the V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array at 400 °C, the targeted sample of the V2O5 nanobelt array was finally obtained. Fig. 3a is the low-magnification SEM image used to reveal that the original honeycomb-like morphology has remained the same and the hierarchical structure is still attached to the Ti substrate without apparent changes. From Fig. 3a, we can find that the calcined sample is similar to the planar networks, which implies that the overlapped conductive system has been built up for electron transport; meanwhile, some details can be detected that the hierarchical architecture is actually composed of tiny 1-D nanomaterials as further verified in Fig. 3b, the magnified SEM image. In Fig. 3b, some densely aggregated nanobelts are detectable and commonly consist of the honeycomb membrane. However, it should be pointed out that although the nanobelt membrane is compact, some void spaces through the membrane are still observed as shown in Fig. 3b. These spaces will not only provide the electrolyte diffusion pathway while charge/discharge, but also release the inner pressure derived from the V2O5 nanobelt array's volumetric variations during lithiation/delithiation. The visual experience for V2O5 nanobelt array is from Fig. 3c, the tilt view to uncover the calcined sample's morphological and structural properties. The nearly vertical orientation for the V2O5 nanobelt array and the available channels formed during synthesis or calcinations as revealed in Fig. 3c imply that the obtained V2O5 nanobelt array will be an ideal electrode material for LIBs. Furthermore, from SEM images of Fig. 3a, 3b and 3c, we can get another advantage for using the V2O5 nanobelt array as electrode material compared to other candidates, which is the top-opened architecture. Through the special architecture, the electrolyte can rapidly arrive at the electrode's interface carrying the Li ion active component (LiPF6 in this research) and lithiate or delithiate the V2O5 nanobelt array electrode efficiently. XRD data for the calcined sample is shown in Fig. 3d, where the confirmation of orthorhombic V2O5 phase (JCPDS: 41-1426) is provided. Because the extraction of H2O molecules from the layered V2O5·xH2O under calcinations results in structural transformation or even damages, some mesoporous structures will definitely develop accordingly. Such an assumption is proven by TEM and nitrogen absorption–desorption isotherm (BET) measurements (ESI†). The surface area for the final V2O5 nanobelts can reach up to 21.5 m2 g−1, which is a solid foundation for the electrolyte to effectively soak the electrode and serve as the Li-source for electrochemical reactions.

(a) SEM image demonstrating the top view of the V2O5 nanobelt array, from which we can see the patterned morphology exhibited by its precursor, V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array, is retained. (b) some void spaces can be detected as efficient electrolyte diffusion pathway when tested in Li-ion batteries. (c) shows the tilt view to uncover the nearly vertical condition for the obtained V2O5 nanobelt array. The corresponding XRD data of V2O5 nanobelt array is shown in (d). 
Theoretically, the specific capacities for V2O5 as cathode and anode are 290 mAh g−1 and 1471 mAh g−1, respectively, calculated from the chemical equations below, (1) (2)
The combination of the layered structure and the high reactivity with the Li ion in the conversion process provides a strong technological support for V2O5 in LIBs. Normally in our experiments, Ti substrates with a size of 4 cm2 were used for the preparation of V2O5 nanobelt arrays (ESI†). The original color of the freshly-synthesized V2O5·xH2O nanobelt arrays are yellow/green, corresponding to hydrated V2O5. After calcinations at 400 °C, the final sample turns dark green or brown, implying that chemical conversion occurs. Fig. 4a is the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles for V2O5 nanobelt arrays as cathodes scanned in a voltage window of 2.0–4.0 V (vs.Li+/Li). CV is often referred to as a powerful tool to investigate the oxidation/reduction reactions associated with Li insertion/extraction processes in LIBs. For the cathodic scan, in the voltage window from 4.0 to 3.0 V, there are two peaks, corresponding to the first Li insertion process in two steps, (3) (4)
 Fig. 4  Electrochemical tests on V2O5 nanobelt arrays are presented, where V2O5 nanobelt arrays are serving as the cathode in LIBs. (a) cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles used to trace down the lithiation/delithiation processes. Galvanostatic curves shown in (b) introduce the variation of the specific capacity versus voltage (vs.Li+/Li) when cycled at 1000 mA g−1 for 100 cycles. The V2O5 nanobelt array exhibits wonderful rate capability (c), cyclablity (d) and superior stability (c) and (d) even though the current density is as high as 4000 mA g−1. 
During the successive cathodic scan from 3.0 to 2.5 V, there are another two reversible peaks for the second cycle. These two peaks are scarcely reported in previous reports because the former research has mainly involved random V2O5 nanostructures, e.g.nanoparticles, nanospheres, or composites.13–15 The presence of the two specific peaks can be uniquely ascribed to the novel structure of the V2O5 nanobelt array, which indeed is a hierarchical system self-assembled from V2O5 nanobelts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the patterned V2O5 nanobelt array has been achieved on a Ti substrate. The V2O5 nanobelt array composed of densely aggregated V2O5 nanobelts and void spaces encapsulated inside will definitely influence the electrolyte diffusion process while charging/discharging. That is to say, the structural complexity will lead to the fluctuation and variation in chemical processes so that redox peaks will vary accordingly, as verified in the previous reports.21,22 More importantly, the complicated chemical process may result in some other reversible chemical reactions, for example, the reversible composition of the surface-electrolyte interphase, thus to make extra contributions to the enhanced electrochemical performance.22,23 Further to cathodically scan the V2O5 nanobelt array from 2.5 to 2.0 V, the peak appearing at 2.3 V reveals the second Li insertion process occurs as follows, (5)
Galvanostatic cycling tests show us the detailed description about the variation of the specific capacity versus voltage (vs.Li+/Li) as indicated in Fig. 4b. The current density applied was fixed to be 1000 mA g−1, much higher than those of the conventional tests. Whereas the specific capacity reversibly delivered was still no less than 190 mAh g−1 over 100 cycles, which is the best result for V2O5 nanostructures as cathodes in LIBs so far. No apparent capacity decay or degradation happened to the V2O5 nanobelt array. Two voltage plateaus located around 3.2 and 2.3 V match very well with CV cathodic scans at voltage windows of 3.5 to 3.0 V and 2.5 to 2.0 V, respectively. The delayed voltage slope from 3.0 to 2.5 V accompanying the specific capacity's increase echoes the extra contributions to capacity from the special electrochemical processes as certified in cathodic scan from 3.0 to 2.5 V (Fig. 4a). The high capacity cycled under high current density for a long running time is characteristic of the good rate capability and thereby is powerful evidence for the V2O5 nanobelt array being a superior cathode in LIBs. Other than the current density of 1000 mA g−1, 400 mA g−1 and 4000 mA g−1 were also applied to investigate the V2O5 nanobelt array's electrochemical performance, as shown in Fig. 4c. At the current density of 400 mA g−1, the V2O5 nanobelt array can at least deliver a capacity of 240 mAh g−1 stably over 50 cycles, while at 4000 mA g−1, the steady charge supply still comes out with 150 mAh g−1 for 50 cycles for the V2O5 nanobelt array. Though the deliverable capacity of 240 mAh g−1 does not reach that of the theoretical value of 290 mAh g−1 for V2O5, the result is the best as far as we know, when cycled at the high current density of 400 mA g−1. Especially when the current density is increased to 4000 mA g−1, the retention of the specific capacity at 150 mAh g−1 ultimately verifies the wonderful rate capability and high capacity for V2O5 nanobelt arrays in LIBs. In the following experiments, by regularly changing the current densities from 4000 mA g−1, to 1000 mA g−1, 400 mA g−1, and finally back to 4000 mA g−1, we can observe the reversible capacity delivered from 150 mAh g−1, to 180 mAh g−1, 230 mA g−1, and then back to 150 mAh g−1 subsequently. The process applied in our research is totally inverse to those of the previous reports, where low current densities frequently were first used, and then gradually increased to higher values, with the cells finally cycled back to the original low current densities.24,25 Their tests aimed to investigate the cyclability and reversibility of electrode materials under low current density. As a comparison, our test is to determine the retention of the rate capability, and the cyclability and reversibility under much higher current density. The final results show us that the V2O5 nanobelt array obtained in our research exhibits greatly improved rate capability and cyclability, presenting a superior candidate for LIB cathodes.
When the V2O5 nanobelt array is tested as an anode in LIBs, the excellent electrochemical performance is achievable as well (ESI†). When cycled at 1.2 A g−1, 3 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, the V2O5 nanobelt array can deliver 650, 520 and 430 mAh g−1 of specific capacities respectively, over 50 cycles. The tests under the periodic changes in the current densities from 1.2 A g−1, 5 A g−1, up to 20 A g−1, then back to 5 A g−1 and 1.2 A g−1, describe the basic fact that at least 60% of the capacity can be recovered from the ultra-high current density of 20 A g−1. The whole tests are based on the long term cycling up to 250 cycles. The result is a great achievement for V2O5 nanostructures' application in LIBs and also is the best anodic performance according to our knowledge.
The excellent performance for V2O5 nanobelt arrays on Ti substrates serving as cathodes and anodes in LIBs is believed to be based on their unique architecture. In electrochemical systems, e.g. Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells and solar cells, there are several crucial factors we should seriously consider to improve their working efficiency. Among them, electrolyte diffusion to the interfaces between the electrodes and electrolytes, charge carriers' transport from electrolytes to the electrodes, and electron or proton's conduction from the electrode materials to the current collectors are in general highlighted and are given much more attention by researchers. Circling these aspects, some functional systems have been designed and fabricated, including active materials encapsulated by carbon layer and nanostructure arrays.8,13,24 Because nanostructure arrays don't require the ancillary materials of carbon black and binder for the cell assembly, and no agglomeration is introduced into the electrode materials while cycling, the batteries' performance can be significantly enhanced, especially in the aspect of rate capability. However, it is more difficult to fabricate directly 1-D nanostructure arrays on some conductive substrates compared to encapsulating active materials in carbon layer, especially via wet-chemistry, the cost-effective and scalable method. The exact reason lies in the fact that two prerequisite conditions have to be met prior to the synthesis: one is to have earlier-formed crystal seeds rooted on the substrates, and the other is the requirement for the targeted materials or their precursors to exhibit 1-D oriented growth. So far it is hard for the conventional materials to meet the two conditions simultaneously. Our success in the synthesis of V2O5 nanobelt arrays verify the reliability of rationally designing and fabricating nanostructure arrays in solutions. Apart from the fact that no ancillary materials are needed, there are some other advantages to contribute the highly improved electrochemical properties for V2O5 nanobelt arrays, including: 1) V2O5 nanobelts are strongly bound to the Ti substrate so that the electron conducting pathway is always open. The situation is distinguishable from the common electrodes, which are usually exfoliated from the current collectors with ongoing cycling. The excellent contact between electrode materials and current collectors is the driving force to greatly facilitate the rate capability.8 2) The patterned V2O5 nanobelts will provide spacious room and access for electrolyte diffusion to the electrode surface, and ionic ingress/egress of the electrode from electrolyte, which is also the rate-limiting step for LIBs. So through this way, the rate capacity can be promoted for the most part as well.9 3) Nanobelt arrays exhibit wonderful elastic properties in comparison to nanowire or nanorod arrays, so the damages to the electrode while assembling batteries can be sufficiently avoided, which is favorable for boosting the rate capability, even the specific capacity.8 4). The diameter for V2O5 nanobelts is down to 30 nm; meanwhile, some mesoporous structures are available during the thermal decomposition from V2O5·xH2O to V2O5. The ultra-fine nanobelts and the developed mesoporous structures will provide more sites to absorb excess Li ions, subsequently to increase extraordinarily the specific capacity.8,22,26 5) The as-fabricated V2O5 nanobelt array is a hierarchical system, which can not only complicate the electrochemical process, but also accelerate some extra reactions to improve the specific capacity, e.g. the reversible decomposition of electrolyte.22,23 All the above advantages of V2O5 nanobelt arrays are all responsible for their greatly enhanced electrochemical performance as cathodes and anodes in LIBs and will be the considerable factors when we try to design and fabricate efficient electrode systems.
Conclusion
In conclusion, in this report we have successfully fabricated a V2O5 nanobelt array on a Ti substrate with a V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array as precursor. The V2O5 nanobelt array demonstrates patterned morphology, hierarchical architecture and mesoporous structure. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a V2O5 nanobelt array has been deposited on a conductive substrate via a wet-chemistry approach. The synthesis strategy is totally based on the rational analysis and elaborate design. The V2O5 nanobelt array exhibits excellent electrochemical performance as both a cathode and an anode in Li-ion batteries with respect to the rate capability, stability and cyclability. Combining this with the unique characteristics of the V2O5 nanobelt array, we raised some reasonable explanations for the marvellously improved electrochemical performance, especially in the aspect of rate capability. Also the factors to facilitate the LIBs' properties in this research can be extended to other materials or systems when we design and fabricate electrochemical cells, e.g. Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells and solar cells. Now the design idea is being applied to other active materials in LIBs.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals or materials were used directly without any further purification prior to use. Ammonia metavanadate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), nitric acid (reagent grade, Sigma-Aldrich, 90%), titanium foil (0.127 mm (0.005 inch) thick, annealed, 99%, Alfa Aesar), metallic Li foil (99.9%, Charslton Technologies).
Synthesis of a V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array on Ti foil and the conversion to a V2O5 nanobelt array
Prior to the synthesis, a precursor solution would be prepared. Typically, ammonia metavanadate (0.234 g) was dissolved in 20 ml de-ionized water (D.I. water) to form a bright yellow solution. Using nitric acid, the solution's pH value was adjusted to 2–2.5. Then another 15 ml D.I. water was added into the solution under vigorous stirring.
A Ti foil with size of 1.5 × 2.5 cm was rinsed with D.I. water and pure ethanol subsequently, or sonically cleaned by a mixture of D.I. water, ethanol and acetone with volume ratio of 1:1:1 for 10 min. Afterwards, the Ti foil was tilted against the wall of the autoclave at a certain angle, with the interested surface facing down. The earlier prepared precursor solution was slowly poured into the autoclave. The autoclave was then tightly sealed and left in an oven at 180 °C for 24 h for reaction. Once the reaction was over, the Ti foil was taken out and washed by pure ethanol, then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for at least 3 h. In the event of the conversion from V2O5·xH2O to V2O5, another heat treatment was performed at 400 °C for 200 min with a heating ramp of 1 °C min−1.
In order to synthesize random V2O5·xH2O nanobelts, we can use the same conditions just without Ti foil added.
Characterization of the samples

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL, JSM-7600F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2010F, 200 kV), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area measurement (BET, Quantachrome Autosorb-6B surface area & pore size analyzer) were applied to characterize the obtained samples.
Electrochemical characterization
Prior to actual testing, Ti foil with samples covered was first cut into smaller pieces with size of 5 × 5 mm and weighed in a high-precision analytical balance (Sartorius, max. weight 5100 mg, d = 0.001 mg). The obtained pieces of Ti foil were then used as working electrodes with 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC–DEC, v/v = 1:1) as electrolyte. Celgard 2400 was used as the separator film to isolate the two electrodes. Pure Li foil was accepted to serve as a counter electrode and reference electrode. The cell was assembled in an argon-filled glove box where moisture and oxygen concentrations were strictly limited to below 0.1 ppm. The galvanostatic cyclying was performed on a Neware battery testing system in model of 5V1-5mA and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was collected using Autolab (model of AUT71740) in a three-electrode cell. After testing, the V2O5 nanobelt array was removed from the Ti foil. The Ti foil was completely cleaned by ultrasonication and then weighed in the analytical balance again. In this way, the exact sample mass used for Li-ion batteries testing was available.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  Schematic illustration to introduce the rational synthesis of a V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array on a Ti substrate. Through the hydrogen bonding interaction between the –OH2+groups and the earlier-formed V2O5·xH2O nanoparticles, the V2O5·xH2O crystal seeds will be trapped and fixed onto the Ti substrate. Then relying on the 1-D oriented growth property of V2O5·xH2O, V2O5·xH2O nanobelts initiate from the Ti substrate and develop into a patterned array. After calcinations, the V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array is converted to a V2O5 nanobelt array.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) SEM image for the as-fabricated patterned V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array on the Ti substrate at low magnification. (b) and (c) are the gradually enlarged SEM images to reveal the details of the honeycomb-like hierarchical architecture. (d) discloses the thickness of the V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array which falls into the range of 2.5–3 μm. XRD (e) and EDX (f) analyses confirm the existence of V2O5·xH2O on the Ti substrate.	 

 	Fig. 2  
TEM characterizations on determining the 1-D oriented growth property of the V2O5·xH2O nanobelts are presented. (a), (b) and (c) are the gradually magnified TEM images showing that the V2O5·xH2O bundles are actually composed of several V2O5·xH2O nanobelts parallel to each other. The diameter for each nanobelt is down to 30 nm. (d) TEM image used to describe the status of stacked nanobelts while still strictly remaining parallel to each other.	 

 	Fig. 3  The morphological characterizations on a V2O5 nanobelt array on a Ti substrate after calcining the V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array are shown. (a) SEM image demonstrating the top view of the V2O5 nanobelt array, from which we can see the patterned morphology exhibited by its precursor, V2O5·xH2O nanobelt array, is retained. (b) some void spaces can be detected as efficient electrolyte diffusion pathway when tested in Li-ion batteries. (c) shows the tilt view to uncover the nearly vertical condition for the obtained V2O5 nanobelt array. The corresponding XRD data of V2O5 nanobelt array is shown in (d).

 	Fig. 4  Electrochemical tests on V2O5 nanobelt arrays are presented, where V2O5 nanobelt arrays are serving as the cathode in LIBs. (a) cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles used to trace down the lithiation/delithiation processes. Galvanostatic curves shown in (b) introduce the variation of the specific capacity versus voltage (vs.Li+/Li) when cycled at 1000 mA g−1 for 100 cycles. The V2O5 nanobelt array exhibits wonderful rate capability (c), cyclablity (d) and superior stability (c) and (d) even though the current density is as high as 4000 mA g−1.
