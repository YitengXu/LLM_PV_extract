    , Accepted 13th July 2005First published on 22nd July 2005AbstractElectrochemical reduction of ordered C60 fullerene films in aqueous solution was studied by AFM, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elastic recoil detection analysis. During the irreversible reduction process the film morphology changed from a heteroepitaxial (111) surface to a nanostructured array with clusters of 20 to 50 nm lateral size on average. On the molecular level the initial C60 underwent electrochemical reactions to form C60 polymers and hydrogenated C60. Chemical follow-up reactions of electrochemically formed C60− with water are responsible for the different reduction behaviour of C60 films in aqueous solution compared to C60 reduction in organic solvents and to C60 doping with alkali metals.

Introduction
During the last decade, fullerenes have been established as components of organic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 3.5%.1 Another promising application of fullerenes is the organic field-effect transistor. C60 shows the highest charge carrier mobility among n-channel field-effect transistors (FETs) with organic thin films.2 Since the first FET based on C60 was built in 1995,3 many efforts have been undertaken to improve the electronic properties of such a device. As an example, the charge carrier mobility was increased from 0.08 to 0.56 cm2 V−1 s−1.4 Endohedral fullerenes like La2@C80 or Dy@C82 have been used in microelectronic devices, but the charge carrier mobility was much smaller (8.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).5,6
Ordered fullerene films and their electrochemical nanostructuring are of interest for several reasons. Electrochemical charge injection can be carried out in a well-defined manner and the charge carrier mobility might be systematically tuned over a wide range, which is important for the control of device properties. The morphology of ordered fullerene thin films can be changed and controlled by electrochemical reduction. In aqueous solutions fullerene nanostructures of 20–50 nm lateral size were prepared.7 Larger nanocrystallites of approx. 300 nm in size were obtained in ionic liquids.8 While the fullerene reduction is conditioned by the presence of cation in solution phase, the morphology of nanostructured C60 films depends on the reduction potential, the film substrate and the presence and type of electrolyte cations.8 For technological applications of such structures, the understanding of these morphological processes on a molecular level is necessary.
The electrochemistry of C60 was studied extensively over the last decade. Most of the studies were done at isolated and solvated molecules in organic electrolyte solutions. For sufficiently high potential sweep rates, a reversible redox behaviour is observed for C60 in dichlorobenzene, corresponding to six one-electron transfers.9 Electrochemical reduction of ordered C60 films on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in aqueous solutions has been studied so far by electrochemical and surface imaging methods which do not provide chemical structure information about the species formed in charge transfer.7,10 The electrochemical behaviour of ordered C60 films is fully irreversible.7 As a consequence, only one reduction wave was observed during a cathodic potential sweep starting at open cell potential (OCP). This wave at −1.5 V vs. SCE was located in the potential range between the second and third reduction step of a dissolved C60 molecule in organic solvents.9 An integrated cathodic charge of more than two electrons per one C60 molecule was transferred into the fullerene film during this reaction. The transferred charge cannot be recovered in the back scan towards the OCP. Furthermore, no electron transfer of the same extent could be found in the second cathodic potential sweep.7 The morphology of the film is significantly changed and clusters of 20–50 nm in size are formed.7 The chemical reactions responsible for the irreversible electrochemistry, changed morphology and stability of reduced films are not known in detail up to date. The initial hypothesis of K1C60 fulleride formation during the reduction of ordered C60 films7 has been questioned by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements which indicated an under-stoichiometric potassium content in the film.11 Therefore the molecular and atomic structure of the nanostructured C60 films is to be clarified. A recent in situ Raman study12 provided a first spectroscopic indication for the formation of C60 polymers during electrochemical reduction of ordered C60 films in aqueous solutions. Moreover, the transferred charge which is significant for the C60 reduction was specified to 5.5 electrons per C60 molecule.
In this work, various spectroscopic methods were applied to analyse the electrode reactions and molecular structures at the C60/aqueous electrolyte interface. FTIR spectroscopy was used to examine the state of charge and the chemical bonding state of C60. Thermal annealing of the samples followed by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy was applied to distinguish between polymeric and non polymeric C60 structures formed during the electrochemical nanostructuring. The incorporation of hydrogen into the fullerene film and its chemical state were investigated by FTIR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA). Based on the spectroscopic analysis a reaction scheme which accounts for the significant electrochemical processes was obtained.
Experimental
The preparation of ordered fullerene layers on HOPG and the electrochemical reduction of these layers are described in detail elsewhere.7,8,12 Ordered C60 layers of 300 and 500 nm thicknesses were prepared by heteroepitaxial physical vapour deposition (PVD) on HOPG. Electrochemical measurements were performed in cells with standard three-electrode arrangement controlled by a potentiostat (HEKA PG 285 or PAR 273A). Platinum counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode in a Luggin capillary filled with KCl were used. The electrochemical cell consists of a removable bottom, where the fullerene film deposited on HOPG served as working electrode. The electrolyte was an alkaline solution (0.1 mol L−1 KOH) with 4 mol L−1 KF. Each C60 film could be used for a single experiment only, because the electrochemical reduction of the fullerene films is irreversible. Electrochemical nanostructuring of the C60 films was performed by stepwise charge injection at an electrode potential of −1.6 V vs. SCE until the charge transfer was completed. This potential is more negative than the potential of the reduction wave at around −1.5 V vs. SCE. A couple of electrochemically nanostructured C60 films were annealed in vacuum (1 × 10−4 Pa) for 5 h at 393 K to detect recovered pristine C60 from polymeric reduction products.
The morphology of each fullerene film was studied after vacuum deposition and electrochemical reduction, respectively, by AFM and STM (Digital Instruments Nanoscope III). FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were used to study the C60 films at three different stages of treatment at one and the same sample: after preparation, after electrochemical reduction and finally after thermal annealing of the reduced film. FTIR spectra were measured in a 20° reflection unit on a IFS 66v spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) with a resolution of 2 cm−1. Raman scattering was excited by 514.5 nm laser radiation of an Innova 305 Ar+ ion gas laser (Coherent, USA). The scattered light was collected in a 180° back scattering geometry and analysed by a T 64000 triple monochromator spectrometer (Jobin Yvon, France) set to a spectral band pass of 2 cm−1. A rotation device was used to exclude heat induced sample changes (see ref. 12). For mass spectrometric analysis, fullerene films were suspended in ethanol by sonication for 15 min. The suspension was subsequently drop-coated and dried on the sample holder of the mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were recorded on a matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer Biflex III (Bruker, Germany) without addition of any supporting matrix. For determination of the elemental composition, the fresh and the reduced C60 film were analysed by elastic backscattering of high energetic heavy ions (ERDA), described elsewhere.17
Results and discussion
Morphology
The morphology of a fullerene film before and after the electrochemical reduction is shown in Fig. 1. Ordered C60 layers with grains up to 50 μm in lateral size are formed during the heteroepitaxial deposition on HOPG. On top of the grain, molecularly flat terraces can be observed (Fig. 1a). Each visible step is assigned to one C60 layer. A grain boundary appears on the left side of the image. The morphology of the fullerene film is completely changed after the electrochemical reduction. The initial molecularly flat surface changes to a cluster arrangement, as shown in Fig. 1b. The clusters are 20–50 nm in size, i.e. a nanostructured cluster array was formed. After the irreversible electrochemical reduction, the former hydrophobic fullerene films become hydrophilic. If the electrode is taken out of the electrochemical cell after the reduction and is washed with water, a good wettability of the electrochemically modified area is apparent.

FTIR spectra
The analysis of the IR active F1u(4) mode is a powerful tool for distinguishing C60 structures in different charge states and for detecting the chemical derivatisation of C60, which consists in chemical addition reactions at the CC double bonds. C60–C60 cage linking is one example for this reaction type. Within the series of pristine and of alkali metal doped C60 described by the general formulae (A+)xC60x−
					(A
					= K, Rb; 0 ≤
					x
					≤ 6) the frequency of the F1u(4) line exhibits a linear downshift of 15 cm−1 per transferred electron. The physical reason for this behaviour is the subsequent filling of the antibonding C60-LUMO (t1u symmetry) which reduces the bond order of the C60 cage. Chemical derivatisation causes a splitting of the F1u(4) line and an additional whilst smaller frequency downshifts.9,13–16
In Fig. 2, selected parts of the IR spectrum of the C60 film before and after electrochemical nanostructuring are shown along with results of a line shape analysis for characteristic absorptions of the nanostructured C60 film. The measured data and relevant reference data are listed in Table 1. Upon electrochemical nanostructuring, the C60 fundamental line at 1429 cm−1 and the second order line at 1540 cm−1 lost ≥95% of their intensity. Simultaneously, new lines appeared in the F1u
					(4) and Ag
					(2) range as well as in the range of the aliphatic CH-stretching vibrations. The IR spectrum of C60 is superimposed by the A2u line of the HOPG substrate at 1589 cm−1 and by an interference background. The unchanged intensity of the substrate absorption and the preserved interference pattern indicate that the C60 film is transparent for infrared radiation after the nanostructuring process. This behaviour contrasts to that of RbxC60 and KxC60 films with x
					= 1, 3, 4, for which the interference patterns were wiped out due to the presence of charge carriers.16 It is a spectroscopic evidence that significant concentrations of C60 anions with charges of −1, −3 and −4 were absent in the clusters.

The line shape analysis results in strong absorption at 1423 cm−1 and two medium intense absorptions at 1444 and 1456 cm−1 as the dominant infrared lines of the nanostructured C60 film in the frequency range of the F1u(4) and the Ag(2) modes (Fig. 2b). The line at 1423 cm−1 can be correlated well with absorptions found in two of the reference spectra at 1426 cm−1: that of the (C60)2 dimer and that of the orthorhombic polymer (o-C60)
					(Table 1). However, the line at 1444 cm−1 has a counterpart only in the FTIR spectrum of the orthorhombic polymer (o-C60), not in the dimer spectrum. The intensity ratio of the lines at 1423 and 1444 cm−1 is approximately 5 to 2, what is close to the ratio in o-C60. Therefore, these two features are assigned predominantly to F1u(4) derived modes of polymeric structures in the nanostructured C60 film. The line at 1456 cm−1 has no counterpart in any of the reference spectra. Its position corresponds well with a Raman line at 1458 cm−1, which was assigned to the Ag(2) mode of polymeric structures in ref. 12. A reduced symmetry in the film structures compared to the situation in crystals, e.g. due to point defects, lattice distortions or different chain lengths could be responsible for the infrared activity of this line.
In addition to the three dominant lines, three weak absorptions at 1400, 1428 and 1462 cm−1 with relative intensities of 7, 8 and 4%, respectively, normalised to the line at 1423 cm−1 were found in the range of the F1u(4) and Ag(2) modes (Fig. 2b). Whereas the line at 1428 cm−1 can be definitely assigned to non-transformed C60, the other two lines indicate two minor reaction products. The line at 1462 cm−1 points to the formation of a C60 derivative where one bidentate or two monodentate groups are added to one CC double bond forming, e.g., a (C60)2 dimer or more generally a C60–R2 structure. The line at 1400 cm−1 points to a small fraction of K1C60. Using its spectral weight in the whole F1u(4)/Ag(2) range as a rough estimate for the concentration, the molar fraction of K1C60 in the nanostructured C60 film could be as high as 0.04. Since the line at 1400 cm−1 can be alternatively attributed to the asymmetric shape or to a splitting component of the strong line at 1423 cm−1 and as the F1u(4) mode of charged C60 species is enhanced by the charged phonon effect,16 the actual concentration of charged C60 is presumably still smaller.
A remarkable FTIR feature of the nanostructured C60 film is given by the lines in the aliphatic CH-stretching range, which are completely absent in the spectrum of the initial C60 film. Analysing their number and positions, these lines can be correlated to symmetric and antisymmetric CH-stretching modes of at least two aliphatic groups. Hydrogenation of C60 would be a further reaction pathway for electrochemical reduction of C60 films in aqueous solution in addition to polymer formation. In conclusion, the formation of uncharged C60 derivatives with C60 or hydrogen as substituents accounts for the main features of the FTIR spectrum of the nanostructured C60 film in the range of the F1u(4) and Ag(2) mode. Potassium fullerides KxC60 were excluded as significant reaction products. C60 anions might however play a role as intermediates in the mechanism of the reaction.
FTIR and Raman spectra after thermal annealing
As C60 polymers are not stable at elevated temperatures, further experimental evidence for C60 polymers can be obtained by checking whether the nanostructured films can be reconverted into C60 or not. Raman and FTIR spectra measured at different stages of C60 film treatment are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra of one and the same film were recorded first after deposition of the fresh C60 film, next after electrochemical nanostructuring and finally after thermal annealing at 393 K. The C60 transformation yield in this experiment was calculated to be 85–90% based on the intensity ratio of the Ag(2) Raman line at 1468 cm−1 and the F1u(4) line at 1429 cm−1 after and before electrochemical nanostructuring (Fig. 3). By thermal annealing the intensity of both C60 lines was partly recovered. The Ag(2) mode intensity of pristine C60 increased from 10 to 40% of its initial value, and the F1u(4) line intensity increased likewise by a factor of 4 from 15 to 60% of its value before nanostructuring. The experiment shows that two different C60 fullerene species are formed during the electrochemical reduction, which are distinguished by their response upon thermal annealing: species 1 can be reconverted into C60, while species 2 cannot. The insets in Fig. 3 reveal the spectroscopic properties of these reduction products: species 1 has an Ag(2) line at 1458 cm−1, species 2 at 1463 cm−1. The former one vanished by annealing, the latter one retained its intensity. According to the literature,19 o-C60 is characterized by a very strong Raman line at 1457 cm−1, whose frequency is identical to the Raman line of species 1 at 1458 cm−1 within the experimental accuracy. Therefore species 1 is assigned to a polymeric C60 structure. Species 2 is attributed to a non-polymeric structure.

Elemental analysis
To decide whether the aliphatic CH-groups detected in the FTIR spectrum of the nanostructured C60 film are actually caused by hydrogenated C60 molecules, which then could be correlated with species 2 or simply by hydrocarbon impurities, mass spectrometric analysis was applied. The mass spectra of suspensions of a C60 film before and after reduction are shown in Fig. 4. In the former case, the isotopic pattern of C60 is observed at 720 mass units. Due to handling in air, a small amount of C60O also appears at 736 m/z. After electrochemical reduction (Fig. 4b), a series of new peaks with a mass difference of Δm
					= 1 occurs. The signal to noise ratio of S/N ≥ 3 allows their unambiguous identification in the mass to charge range of 723 ≤
					m/z
					≤ 758. The peaks at m/z
					= 736 and 740, which were just detectable with a signal to noise ratio of S/N = 2.0 prior to film reduction, showed a four times higher intensity and a S/N = 8.0 after electrochemical nanostructuring. This observation supports the formation of hydrogenated C60 derivatives (C60Hm), where m can reach values up to 38. The hydrogen incorporation into the C60 film is further supported by the ERDA measurements, which are shown in Fig. 5. A fresh C60 film of 500 nm thickness on HOPG shows an overall content of 99.7% C with small amounts of H (0.2%) and O (0.1%)
					(Fig. 5a). This is reasonable for films handled in air without further annealing steps. In the reduced film (Fig. 5b), a hydrogen content of 5% has been found. The hydrogen is homogeneously distributed over the whole film. Owing to the low potassium content, the intercalation of K+ into the film during reduction is not significant, as already concluded from the current FTIR data and the former Raman analysis.12

Reaction mechanism
The spectroscopic analysis of ordered C60 films before and after electrochemical reduction in aqueous solution as well as thermal annealing experiments have shown that polymeric C60 species with a non-uniform chain length distribution and hydrogenated C60 are the main reaction products forming the 20 to 50 nm large clusters of the nanostructured film. Using the Raman data obtained in the annealing experiments, a quantitative determination of the ratio of the C60 molecules transformed into C60 polymers–(C60)n, formerly assigned as species 1, and into C60Hm, which corresponds to species 2, can be made. The overall reaction scheme can be written as follows: (1)In this scheme the initial molar fraction of C60 is 1.0, i.e. x
					= 1.0. Owing to the transformation yield of ca. 87.5%, (y
					+
					z)
					= 0.875, the C60 molar fraction after reduction is given by (x
					−
					y
					−
					z)
					= 0.125. After annealing the molar fraction of C60 is 0.5 or 50%. Therefore the molar fraction y of 1/n(C60)n follows from y
					= 0.5 − 0.125 = 0.375. Finally, the stoichiometric factor for C60Hm is obtained according to z
					= 0.875 − 0.375 = 0.5.
Based on the spectroscopic identification of the main reaction products of the electrochemical reduction of ordered C60 films in aqueous solutions the following mechanism of the electrode reactions is proposed. The reduction of the fullerene layer starts at a sufficiently negative potential at the graphite/fullerene interface: C60(a)
							+
							e−
							→ C60−(a).(2)The first C60 layer which is in direct contact to the graphite substrate is reduced to C60− as the primary reduction step. The second layer of C60 molecules is reduced by charge transfer from the primarily formed C60− layer, according to (3), instead of that the first layer is further reduced to C602−. C60−(a)
							+ C60(b)
							→ C60−(a)
							+ C60−(b)(3)Since the injected charge is not yet stabilized by counter ions it will propagate through the whole C60 layer in order to minimize Coulomb repulsion. The increasing charge density in the film forces the stabilisation of the C60− anions by chemical follow-up reactions. From the homogeneously enhanced hydrogen content found in the ERDA measurements, it is to be concluded that water serves as the preferred reaction partner of C60−. The follow-up reactions, accounting for the observed reduction products, are provided in Figs. 6 and 7. The intercalation of K+ ions (IV, Fig. 6) for charge compensation is a minor reaction since neither a significant potassium content nor a significant C60− concentration were found. A part of the intermediately formed C60− undergoes linear polymerisation. The polymeric structures react with water under hydrogen evolution (V, Fig. 6). This results in a polymeric cluster formation which corresponds to the change in the morphology of the film. Based on the cluster size of 20 to 50 nm, the chain length n of the (C60)n polymers can be estimated. The shortest C60–C60 distance in fcc-C60 is 1.002 nm and little less than 1 nm in o-C60.9 Hence the C60 polymer phase might encompass up to 50 C60 molecules in the direction of the largest cluster extension. This large number of monomer units in one chain would account for the fact that the spectroscopic properties resemble those of the crystalline o-C60 phase. Moreover, the hydrogenation of C60 is observed (VI, Fig. 6). The charge at the fullerene cage can be compensated by the addition of hydrogen ions which attach the cage. This process of charging and proton reaction can be repeated also at already hydrogenated cages. It results in hydrogenated fullerenes of the general formula C60Hm
					(1 ≤
					m
					≤ 38). This differs from discussions of Szücs et al.20 who claimed that hydrogenation of C60 in alkaline solution stops at C60H.

Summary
Electrochemical reduction of ordered C60 fullerene films in aqueous solution was studied by AFM, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elastic backscattering of highly energetic heavy ions. The electrochemical behaviour of the ordered fullerene layers differs from that of isolated C60 molecules in solution. The single step reduction of the C60 layer is irreversible. The morphology of the film changes from a heteroepitaxially grown flat surface with molecular terraces into a nanostructured cluster arrangement. These clusters are 20 to 50 nm in lateral size. The C60 molecules are transformed at a yield of ≥95%. Intermediately formed C60− anions undergo chemical follow-up reactions with themselves and with water. (C60)n polymers and hydrogenated fullerenes, C60Hm, are the main products of the electrochemical reduction. The polymers are suggested to grow as three-dimensional structures instead of linear chains, which accounts for the observed cluster morphology. The polymeric fullerene structures can be re-transformed to pristine C60 by moderate annealing in vacuum, whereas the hydrogenated fullerenes remain unchanged during the thermal treatment.
