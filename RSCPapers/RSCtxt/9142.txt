Enzymes possess well-organized, three-dimensional architectures selected to precisely stabilize the transition state of a reaction, while controlling numerous factors including electron and proton motion, the reactivity of intermediates, the binding and release of substrate(s) and product(s), and the local dielectric environment. The tight control of these parameters is responsible for the successful operation of enzymes. In vivo, these catalysts are capable of self-assembly and self-repair, allowing such ‘soft’ materials to constitute remarkably robust catalytic systems. Moreover, enzymes typically operate under mild conditions, using earth-abundant materials, yet catalyze chemical reactions with high efficiency. Some of these reactions, such as water oxidation, carbon–carbon bond formation/scission, the redox chemistry of N2, CO2 reduction, etc. continue to offer challenges in the design of human-engineered catalysts for sustainable energy production and use. These many remarkable features of enzymes make them attractive targets for study and emulation. Over the past several years, we have investigated the in vitro coupling of redox enzymes to photochemically-generated oxidizing and reducing equivalents in a hybrid photoelectrochemical biofuel cell.1-5 This device combines aspects of both enzymatic biofuel cells6-13 and dye-sensitized solar cells.14-18In a conventional enzymatic biofuel cell, a biologically-derived fuel is oxidized in vitro by enzyme catalysts, with the electrons liberated during this process collected at an electrode and transferred to an external circuit.8,11,12 These electrons flow to a cathode, where biological or inorganic catalysts facilitate the reduction of an appropriate oxidant. Consequently, a portion of the chemical energy stored in the biofuel (ultimately solar energy converted by photosynthesis) is converted into electrical energy during the controlled oxidation. Molecular oxygen typically serves as the terminal oxidant, and biofuel cells thus represent a closed fuel cycle. Electrons liberated from water during photosynthesis (and stored in the biofuel) recombine with molecular oxygen (in the biofuel cell) to form water and release a fraction of the solar energy that was initially responsible for formation of the biofuel.19 Due to the high specificity of enzymes, enzymatic biofuel cells have the potential to operate without membrane separation of the anodic and cathodic solutions.20,21 Maximum power densities are generally in the 10−6 to 10−3 W cm−2 range,8 making enzymatic biofuel cells capable of powering small electronic devices and especially promising as implantable power sources for electrical devices in vivo.7,21In contrast, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are capable of converting solar to electrical energy without the intermediate storage of energy/electrons in the chemical bonds of a biological molecule. DSSCs rely upon the sensitization of a semiconductor by a monolayer of dye molecules adsorbed at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. High surface area, porous semiconductor electrodes are typically used.14,22 As only a single-monolayer of dyes in direct contact with the semiconductor is competent for photo-induced electron transfer, the high surface area allows for drastically improved light harvesting. Most typically an n-type semiconductor is used, although DSSCs have also been developed using p-type semiconductors.23 For a sensitized n-type semiconductor, the absorption of light by an adsorbed dye molecule gives rise to an excited state of the dye. Due to the electronic coupling between the dye and the semiconductor, as well as the high density of states near the semiconductor conduction band edge, the excited state predominantly decays by ultra-fast electron transfer to the semiconductor,24-27 giving rise to a Dye˙+/Semiconductor˙− charge-separated state. The oxidized dye molecule is reduced by an electron donor in the electrolyte. The injected electron migrates to an underlying transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrode and travels through an external circuit to a counter electrode. At this cathode, the electron recombines with the oxidized form of the electron donor in the electrolyte. The result is a photoinduced cyclic electron flow, with no net chemical transformation occurring. Over the years, DSSCs have received considerable attention as a low-cost photovoltaic technology,16 with solar energy conversion efficiencies in excess of 11% reported.28The photoelectrochemical biofuel cell incorporates aspects of both enzymatic biofuel cells and dye-sensitized solar cells (Fig. 1). The system relies upon charge separation at a porphyrin-sensitized n-type semiconductor photoanode, in close analogy with DSSCs. Following photoinduced charge separation, the porphyrin radical cation is reduced by β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or by β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in the aqueous anodic solution, ultimately generating the oxidized form of the mediator, NAD(P)+, after two electron transfers to the photoanode. In turn, NAD(P)+ serves as a substrate for dehydrogenase enzymes in the anodic solution, with the enzymatic oxidation of a biofuel leading to the regeneration of NAD(P)H. The enzyme catalyzed, and NAD(P) mediated, electron transfers between the biofuel and the photoanode are reminiscent of enzymatic biofuel cell operation.13 However, a larger open-circuit voltage is theoretically achievable in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell because the photochemical step raises the energy of electrons entering the external circuit at the anode.1 Unlike traditional DSSCs, the extraction of electrons from the biomass-derived substrate permits the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell to operate with linear electron flow from anode to cathode. This linear electron flow permits the production of either electricity or an energy rich fuel depending upon the chosen cathodic reaction. The energy for this process is provided both by incident photons and the solar energy stored in the chemical bonds of the biomass substrate.4 The study of this device provides insight regarding the constraints of coupling redox enzymes to oxidizing and reducing equivalents in a photochemical system. Fig. 1  Schematic representations of (a) an enzymatic biofuel cell, (b) a dye-sensitized solar cell, and (c) the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell. The operation of these devices is as described in the text. Electricity generation in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cellAs initially conceived, the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell involved a monolayer of 5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-tris(4-methylphenyl)porphyrin (P) adsorbed to a high surface area SnO2 layer deposited on a TCO electrode.1 This photoanode was bathed in an aqueous solution containing an equilibrated mixture of NAD(P)+, an appropriate dehydrogenase enzyme and a biofuel substrate. Illumination with actinic photons resulted in the oxidation of NAD(P)H, thereby providing the NAD(P)+ for further oxidation of the biofuel via the dehydrogenase enzyme in solution. When wired to a Hg/Hg2SO4 cathode (bathed in saturated K2SO4), the open-circuit voltage was 0.75 V. The performance was comparable with either methanol, ethanol, glucose, or glucose-6-phosphate as the biofuel, demonstrating that the reduction of the porphyrin radical cation depends only upon the availability of NAD(P)H, regardless of its source. With appropriate enzymes, methanol was oxidized in three steps (six electrons) to CO2, ethanol was oxidized in two steps (four electrons) to acetate, glucose was oxidized in one step (two electrons) to gluconolactone, and glucose-6-phosphate was oxidized in two steps (four electrons) to ribulose-5-phosphate and CO2.Subsequent work using a TiO2-based photoanode demonstrated a higher open-circuit voltage upon illumination (1.10 V), under otherwise comparable conditions with glucose as the biofuel.2 The increased open-circuit voltage is readily accounted for by the more negative reduction potential of TiO2 as compared to SnO2. In aqueous solution, both SnO2 and TiO2 exhibit a Nernstian 59 mV per pH unit dependence of their reduction potential. At pH 8.0, the TiO2 conduction band operates near −0.63 V vs. NHE,29-31 while the SnO2 conduction band operates near 0.04 V vs. NHE.15,32,33 The open-circuit voltage of the cell reflects the difference in potential between the semiconductor quasi-Fermi level upon illumination and the redox couple at the cathode. The increase in the open-circuit voltage with TiO2 (0.35 V greater than with SnO2) is less than the estimated difference in the flatband potentials of TiO2 and SnO2 (0.67 V difference), suggesting the presence of trap-states positive of the TiO2 conduction band edge. In turn, the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell is relatively insensitive to the choice of cathode, operating well with either a Hg/Hg2Cl2 (bathed in saturated KCl, i.e. a saturated calomel electrode) or a Ag/AgCl (bathed in saturated KCl) cathode, in addition to the Hg/Hg2SO4 cathode. However, the open-circuit voltage upon illumination is greater with the higher potential Hg/Hg2SO4 cathode.The photoelectrochemical biofuel cell gives negligible current in the dark, and its function is therefore dependent upon the photochemical formation of a charge-separated state (as described above in the discussion of dye-sensitized solar cells). Fig. 2 shows transient absorption data for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode in aerobic buffer (pH 8). In the spectrum (inset), the Q-band bleach and the broad absorbance from 650 to 750 nm are consistent with P˙+, validating the formation of the P˙+/TiO2˙− charge-separated state. The formation of the charge-separated state occurs within the pulse-width of the laser (4.8 ns) and cannot be resolved. This is consistent with literature reports of porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 DSSCs,34 which show electron injection into TiO2 occurring on a sub-picosecond timescale.35 In the absence of NADH, the charge-separated state exhibits a bi-exponential decay, with lifetimes of 7.0 μs (48%) and 54.2 μs (52%), with P˙+ eventually decaying to the ground state via charge recombination. The addition of NADH decreases the P˙+ lifetime to 2.0 μs (39%) and 17.1 μs (61%) in the presence of 1 mM NADH, and to 850 ns (44%) and 7.8 μs (56%) in the presence of 2 mM NADH. In the presence of 3 mM NADH, the fast component could not be resolved and the data were fit to a single exponential decay with a 7.5 μs lifetime. These results demonstrate that the charge-separated state is sufficiently long-lived to allow hole transfer to NADH in solution, thereby generating NAD+ used for the enzymatic oxidation of the biofuel. Fig. 2  Transient absorption kinetic traces (650 nm excitation and 700 nm probe) recorded for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode in aerobic 0.25 M Tris, 0.10 M KCl (pH 8.0) buffer, under open-circuit conditions at 20 °C. Kinetic traces were recorded in the presence of 0 mM (), 1 mM (), 2 mM (), and 3 mM () NADH. The spectrum (inset) was recorded in the absence of NADH, 4 μs after 532 nm laser excitation. Due to quenching of the porphyrin radical cation via electron transfer from NAD(P)H, the injected electrons in the TiO2 conduction band are free to migrate through an external circuit to a cathode, thereby generating electricity. The choice of cathode influences the open-circuit voltage of the cell. Fig. 3 compares the performance of the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell operating with either a Hg/Hg2SO4 or a high surface area platinum (oxygen reducing) cathode. The short-circuit currents are comparable, as both cathodes have sufficient area to avoid limiting the current density. The open-circuit voltage is higher with the mercury cathode (VOC = 1.08 V) than with the platinum cathode (VOC = 0.85 V), indicating that the Hg/Hg2SO4 electrode operates at a higher potential than the oxygen-reducing cathode. Interestingly, the Hg/Hg2SO4 (saturated K2SO4) electrode operates at 0.64 V vs. NHE, while thermodynamically the reduction of oxygen to water occurs at 0.77 V vs. NHE (pH 7.8).36 Hence the data in Fig. 3 suggest that oxygen reduction occurs on the particulate platinum cathode at an overpotential of ∼ 0.36 V. Fig. 3  Current–voltage curves recorded for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode (operating in 0.25 M TES, 0.10 M KCl (pH 7.8) buffer, with 5 mM NADH present); wired to either a Hg/Hg2SO4 (saturated K2SO4) cathode (□), or an oxygen reducing platinum cathode () operating in 0.25 M TES, 0.10 M KCl (pH 7.8) buffer. Both traces were recorded under monochromatic illumination (520 nm, ∼0.9 mW cm−2). The higher open-circuit voltage observed with the Hg/Hg2SO4 cathode is attributable to this cathode operating at a more positive potential. From an operational perspective, the oxygen reducing cathode offers a significant advantage over the Hg/Hg2SO4 cathode since molecular oxygen can be obtained from the ambient environment and the reduction of O2, presumably to water,1 is environmentally benign. Fig. 4 shows an action spectrum of the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell operating with an oxygen-reducing cathode. The incident-photon-to-current-efficiency (IPCE) closely tracks the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of the photoanode across the spectrum, which, in turn, is consistent with the absorption spectrum of the porphyrin sensitizer dye in solution. This observation indicates that photon absorption by porphyrin-sensitizer dyes initiates the photoinduced electron transfers which gives rise to photocurrent and photovoltage. Fig. 4  Action spectrum of a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode (operating in 0.25 M TES, 0.10 M KCl (pH 7.8) buffer, with 8 mM NADH present), wired to an oxygen reducing platinum cathode operating in 0.25 M TES, 0.10 M KCl (pH 7.8) buffer. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE, ) maxima correspond to the light harvesting efficiency (LHE, ) maxima of the photoanode. The light intensity was ∼ 1 mW cm−2 for each wavelength investigated. Hydrogen generation in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cellWhen the TiO2-based photoelectrochemical biofuel cell operates with the same platinum cathode, but under anaerobic conditions, oxygen reduction is no longer feasible at the cathode. Under these conditions hydrogen production becomes the relevant cathodic process.3 Even though hydrogen production is readily observed, the cell is not operating at optimum current and voltage. A VOC of about 0.15 V was measured with the cathode equilibrated with hydrogen at ambient pressure (hydrogen bubbles forming just before VOC was measured). Driving hydrogen production at this voltage implies that the cell was operating below Pmax. Nevertheless, under these conditions energy as electromotive force is transformed and stored in the chemical bond of the molecular hydrogen product; any additional use of the electromotive force would result in a decrease in the rate of hydrogen production. Because H2 is among the most reducing species encountered in biology,37 hydrogen production can be viewed as a proxy for the synthesis of other high value fuels, such as reduced carbon compounds. Moreover, the hydrogen itself could serve as a fuel or be used in the production of liquid fuels.38Fig. 5 demonstrates the photocurrent and hydrogen product (detected by gas chromatography) generated upon illumination of a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode wired to an anaerobic platinum cathode. Comparison of these two quantities reveals a Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen production of 92%. This value is a lower estimate, as some hydrogen product may have escaped the cathodic cell prior to detection. Hydrogen generation in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell has been experimentally demonstrated with electrons derived from NADH as a sacrificial donor, or with the NAD+ product being recycled via the oxidation of glucose or ethanol.3,4 Our previous use of methanol or glucose-6-phosphate as the electron source for electricity generation1 suggests that the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell is capable of reforming a wide-array of biofuel substrates into hydrogen gas. Fig. 5  (a) The short-circuit photocurrent and (b) the hydrogen product detected by gas chromatography, for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode wired to an anaerobic platinum cathode; both operating in 0.25 M Tris, 0.10 M KCl (pH 8.0) buffer. The anodic solution contained 4 mM NADH (, ), or 4 mM NAD+/glucose dehydrogenase (GDH)/100 mM glucose (, ). Controls are shown for the NAD+/GDH/glucose solution operated in the absence of light (, □), porphyrin (, ), glucose (, ), GDH (, ) or NAD+, GDH, and glucose (, ). Broadband illumination was provided by a filtered Xe arc lamp (460 nm < λ < 1100 nm, ∼ 130 mW cm−2). Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 3. Operation of the cell using a solution of ethanol and acetaldehyde, against a platinum cathode under 1 atm of hydrogen, has demonstrated that the photochemical formation of hydrogen proceeds even when the process would be endergonic in the dark (Ecell, dark≈−0.18 V).4 Thus, some fraction of the incident photon energy can be stored in the hydrogen product during the photochemical reformation process. Moreover, the energy contained in chemical bonds of the initial biofuel itself ultimately represents converted solar energy. Since the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell is able to drive the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H couple highly oxidizing,4 there is the possibility of oxidizing low-value waste biomass while storing solar energy in a high-value reduced fuel (hydrogen).Following our preliminary report of hydrogen production at an anaerobic platinum cathode,3 this process was subsequently demonstrated using an [FeFe]-hydrogenase as the cathodic catalyst in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell.5 The selected [FeFe]-hydrogenase, HydA, from Clostridium acetobutylicum (CaHydA) is a soluble 65.4 kD homolog of the Clostridium pasteurianum [FeFe]-hydrogenase CpI (70% identity),39 for which crystal structures have been determined.40,41 Mature CaHydA contains the [6Fe-6S] H-cluster active site,42,43 and is predicted to contain an additional [2Fe-2S] and three [4Fe-4S] accessory clusters based on homology with CpI. CaHydA catalyzes the reversible interconversion between protons and molecular hydrogen with a high turnover rate and specificity.42,44 Due to inhibition by molecular oxygen, CaHydA must be handled under strictly anaerobic conditions to preserve the catalytic activity.44,45 In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to understanding and addressing the oxygen sensitivity of hydrogenase enzymes.45-53In vivo, the accessory iron-sulfur clusters of CaHydA likely serve as a pathway for electron transfers between external redox partners and the active site. When non-specifically adsorbed to a carbon electrode in vitro, one or more populations of the enzyme are favorably oriented for direct electron transfers between the electrode and the active site, presumably via the same accessory iron-sulfur clusters. The electrochemical characterization of CaHydA has previously been reported.5,52 The interested reader is also referred to many excellent reviews of direct enzyme electrochemistry, especially pertaining to hydrogenase electrodes.49,54-58 For the purpose of this discussion, it is sufficient to note that both hydrogenase and platinum behave as reversible catalysts for hydrogen production, operating with little overpotential.59,60 The current densities for CaHydA electrodes are ∼ 35% of those obtained at platinum.5 With sufficient cathodic catalyst present, both platinum and hydrogenase cathodes can maximize the current response of the photoanode. Hence the photocurrent is nearly indistinguishable in the two cases (Fig. 6). Fig. 6  The short-circuit photocurrent for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode wired to a carbon felt (), carbon felt/CaHydA (), or platinum foil () cathode; operating in 0.10 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) buffer, with 10 mM NADH in the anodic solution. In each case, the electrochemically active surface area of the cathode was ∼ 3.5 cm2. Illumination was provided by a light-emitting diode (λmax = 520 nm, peak width at half-height = 50 nm, 3 mW cm−2). For the carbon felt/CaHydA electrode, an adsorbed hydrogenase film was formed and excess hydrogenase (1.6 U mL−1) was then maintained in the cathodic solution. Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 5. The rate of hydrogen production (i.e. current) in the anaerobic photoelectrochemical biofuel cell is a function of the pressure of hydrogen gas above the cathodic solution, an effect demonstrated in Fig. 7. In this experiment the black I–V curve was recorded for the photoanode under potentiostatic control in a standard three-electrode configuration. As the potential of the underlying TCO electrode is swept to more negative values, the electron density in this conductor, and in the TiO2 film, increases. Increased occupancy of sub-bandgap and conduction band states of the TiO2 film has been correlated with increased rates of charge recombination at the photoanode surface.61,62 Charge recombination can occur between conduction band electrons and an oxidized species at the photoanode surface. As the number of conduction band electrons increases, so too does the probability of charge recombination. At a sufficiently negative potential, corresponding to the quasi-Fermi level of the TiO2 under illumination, the current goes to zero. This potential defines a limit for the cathodic redox couples that are accessible in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell under a given illumination regime. Fig. 7  Data demonstrating the effect of hydrogen ‘back-pressure’ on the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell performance. A current–voltage profile (ν = 5 mV s−1) was obtained for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode under illumination (λ = 520 nm, 3 mW cm−2) (), and in the dark (), under potentiostatic control with a platinum counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference. Overlaid on the I–V profile is the short-circuit current obtained for the photoanode wired to a carbon felt/CaHydA (), or platinum () cathode in a two-electrode configuration, under 520 nm illumination (3 mW cm−2) with the pressure of H2 above the cathodic solution stepped to higher values. The inset shows the raw hydrogen ‘back-pressure’ data before being converted to V vs. Ag/AgCl by the Nernst equation. The conditions of the experiment are the same as those in Fig. 6. Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 5. Fig. 7 also contains data points measured in a two-electrode configuration for the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell operating at short circuit with either an anaerobic platinum or hydrogenase cathode under varying partial pressures of hydrogen gas. The good agreement between data obtained under potentiostatic control and at short-circuit in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell confirms that both platinum and hydrogenase are reversible catalysts operating at the formal potential of the solution. Increasing the partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the formal potential of the H+/H2 redox couple to more negative values, having the same effect as applying a more negative bias to the photoanode in isolation. Moreover, even at low hydrogen partial pressures, hydrogen production in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell requires the photoanode to operate near the ohmic tail of the I–V curve (far left of curve). Consequently, the accumulation of the hydrogen product has a deleterious influence on the overall rate of hydrogen production. The impact of the position of hydrogen production on the I–V curve of the photoanode is also evident in the low IPCE values observed under anaerobic conditions,4 relative to those when operating for electricity generation under aerobic conditions (Fig. 4). Overall, the data in Fig. 7 demonstrate that the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell is able to pressurize hydrogen in excess of two atmospheres. The data also suggest that a redesign of the photoanode with a sensitizer dye/semiconductor pair that could operate at more negative potentials could substantially improve the rate of hydrogen production.Influence of the anodic redox mediatorThe use of NAD(P)H as the anodic redox mediator in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell has important implications for the performance. This is especially true at the low potentials required for hydrogen production. To better understand the role played by the anodic redox mediator, the performance of the cell was compared when using NADH or 1,4-hydroquinone as a sacrificial electron donor in the anodic solution.4 The operation of a dye-sensitized photoanode from an aqueous solution of hydroquinone has been reported in the literature.63-65 For our initial comparison, the photocurrent response of a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode was monitored as a function of the NADH or 1,4-hydroquinone concentration, with the photoanode poised at 0 V vs. SCE. In both cases, the photocurrent was essentially saturated in the presence of 10 mM of the sacrificial electron donor (Fig. 8). The maximum photocurrent with 1,4-hydroquinone was approximately 25% of that achieved with NADH. Fig. 8  Photocurrent for a porphyrin-sensitized photoanode, operating at 0 V vs. SCE, as a function of the concentration of the sacrificial electron donor: NADH (○), or 1,4-hydroquinone (). For NADH, the photoanode operated in 0.25 M Tris, 0.1 M KCl (pH 8.0) buffer. For hydroquinone, the photoanode operated in 0.1 M KCl, 25 mM each of citrate, phosphate, borate (pH 6.0) buffer. Broadband illumination (460 nm < λ < 1100 nm, ∼ 30 mW cm−2) was provided by a filtered Xe arc lamp. Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 4. As shown in Fig. 9, the NADH and 1,4-hydroquinone electron donors were further tested with increasing concentrations of the oxidized form of the redox couple (NAD+ or 1,4-benzoquinone, respectively) present in the anodic solution. If the oxidized redox mediator participates in electron recombination reactions at the photoanode surface, then the photocurrent would be expected to decrease with increasing concentrations of the oxidized species. With NADH as the electron donor, an increased concentration of NAD+ had little effect on the current. With hydroquinone as the electron donor, the current decreased exponentially with increasing concentrations of benzoquinone. Additionally, Fig. 10 displays the photocurrent for the photoanode operating with the TCO electrode poised at different potentials under potentiostatic control, with either NADH or 1,4-hydroquinone used as a sacrificial electron donor. As is the case for Fig. 7, at a sufficiently negative potential, charge recombination dominates the performance and the photocurrent falls to zero. The point of zero current determines the most reducing cathodic redox couple accessible to the photoanode. This value is almost 400 mV more negative when using NADH as compared to 1,4-hydroquinone. In Figs. 8, 9, and 10 the anodic solution was buffered at pH 8 for work with NADH, and at pH 6 for work with 1,4-hydroquinone, due to the different pH optima for these redox mediators. Recalling that the potential of the TiO2 conduction band shifts negative by 59 mV for each unit increase in pH, the two pH unit increase when working with NADH can account for no more than a 120 mV difference in the point of zero current. Hence, Fig. 10 reveals that the photoanode is capable of operating at lower potentials when using the NAD+/NADH couple as the anodic redox mediator. Fig. 9  Photocurrent for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, operating at 0 V vs. SCE with NAD+/NADH (○) or benzoquinone/hydroquinone (), as a function of the [Oxidized]/[Reduced] ratio for the sacrificial electron donor in the anodic solution. The conditions of the experiment are generally the same as those in Fig. 8. For the present data, the [Reduced] was held constant at 10 mM, while the [Oxidized] was varied from 0 to 50 mM. The data are the average of three replicates, with error bars representing one standard deviation. Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 4.  Fig. 10  Photocurrent for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode operating under potentiostatic control, with a platinum counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference. The photocurrent was recorded after 1 minute of illumination at each potential step using NADH (○) or hydroquinone () as the sacrificial electron donor. The experimental conditions are the same as those reported in Fig. 8, with a 10 mM concentration of either NADH or 1,4-hydroquinone in the anodic solution. Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 4. The preceding data indicate that both the photocurrent (Fig. 8) and photovoltage (Fig. 10) decrease when operating the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell with the benzoquinone/hydroquinone redox couple. Further, the cell performance is quite dependent upon the ratio of oxidized to reduced quinone in the anodic solution (Fig. 9). These observations are consistent with facile charge recombination between injected electrons and oxidized quinone species, but not oxidized NAD species. In biology, both NAD(P)H and hydroquinone operate as two electron carriers. However, NAD(P) redox chemistry occurs by a concerted two-electron/one-proton (i.e. hydride) transfer, while quinone redox chemistry can occur as two discrete one-electron steps. In the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell, both electron donation to the oxidized porphyrin radical cation and charge recombination to the oxidized redox mediator are one-electron processes. Mechanistic consideration of the one-electron redox chemistry of NAD(P)H and hydroquinone provides insight regarding charge recombination in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell.The single-electron oxidation of NADH has been reported to occur at 0.93 V vs. NHE.66 The NADH˙+ radical cation product is highly acidic (pKa∼−4) and spontaneously deprotonates to form the neutral NAD˙ radical.67 In turn, the NAD˙ radical is highly reducing and undergoes a single-electron oxidization at potentials positive of −0.92 V vs. NHE.66 Due to instability of the NAD˙ radical, the intermediate can decay by the following: (1) disproportionation of two NAD˙ radicals to form one NADH and one NAD+ molecule, (2) dimerization followed by oxidation of the dimer, (3) electron donation to a second porphyrin radical cation, or (4) direct electron donation to the TiO2 conduction band or TCO electrode.67,68 The low reduction potential for the NAD+/NAD˙ transition imposes a large activation barrier for charge recombination via the single-electron reduction of NAD+ in solution. Further, the high acidity of the NADH˙+ radical cation disfavors the one-electron/one-proton reduction of NAD˙ to NADH. Consequently, the oxidized NAD species are not suitable electron acceptors for charge recombination at the photoanode surface.In comparison, for 1,4-hydroquinone (pKa1 = 9.9, pKa2 = 11.4)69,70 in a buffered pH 6.0 solution, the single-electron oxidation occurs at 0.58 V vs. NHE.71 Since the doubly-protonated semiquinone radical (QH2˙+) has an estimated pKa≈−1,72,73 and the singly-protonated semiquinone radical (QH˙) has a pKa of 4.1,71 the one-electron oxidation of 1,4-hydroquinone primarily leads to the formation of the semiquinone radical anion (Q˙−) under the indicated solution conditions. At pH 6.0, the semiquinone radical anion can subsequently undergo a single-electron oxidation (Em = 0.10 V vs. NHE) to yield the final 1,4-benzoquinone product.71 Once again, instability of the semiquinone intermediate allows for the disproportionation of two semiquinones to form hydroquinone and benzoquinone, with the equilibrium strongly disfavoring the semiquinone in aqueous solution near neutral pH.71-74 Based upon these considerations, both the semiquinone and quinone oxidation products are thermodynamically poised to accept electrons from either the TiO2 conduction band or exposed regions of the TCO substrate.These thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the NAD+/NADH and benzoquinone/hydroquinone redox mediators highlight favorable aspects of using the NAD+/NADH couple in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell. An initial observation is that the NAD˙ intermediate is sufficiently reducing to donate an electron directly to either the TiO2 conduction band or to exposed regions of the TCO substrate. This process has not been experimentally verified, and would be in competition with the rapid disproportionation of NAD˙ and NADH˙+ radicals.68 Nevertheless, the possibility of a secondary dark electron transfer to the electrode cannot be discounted. Such a process could allow up to two electrons to transverse the external circuit per absorbed photon, thus offering the intriguing possibility of obtaining a quantum yield greater than unity. In contrast, with hydroquinone as the electron donor, the oxidized quinone intermediates are not sufficiently reducing to donate directly an electron to either the TiO2 conduction band or to the TCO electrode when producing hydrogen. A second point is that NAD+ and NAD˙ are unfavorable acceptors for charge recombination reactions. Consequently, with NADH as the anodic mediator, charge recombination to solution75 is essentially eliminated, although charge recombination with oxidized sensitizer dyes16,17,76 remains a potential source of inefficiency. In contrast, the oxidized quinone species are suitable acceptors for charge recombination. This recombination process is the most likely explanation for the different performance observed with NADH and hydroquinone in Figs. 8, 9 and 10.Design strategiesThe data in Figs. 7 and 10 reveal that operation of the photoanode at the negative potentials required for hydrogen production limits the quantum efficiency of the photochemical process. Using the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H redox couple, a large activation energy precludes electron recombination to oxidized NAD(P) species as a loss mechanism. Despite this irreversible oxidation at the photoanode surface, the ultimate NAD(P)+ product is readily reduced by dehydrogenase enzymes in the anodic solution. This rectifying behavior of the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H electron relay is an important factor in the successful operation of the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell for hydrogen production. In broad strokes, the kinetics with this mediator are reminiscent of the behavior of the I3−/I− redox couple in traditional DSSCs, in which I− oxidation is kinetically facile relative to the reduction of oxidized iodine species at the semiconductor/dye/electrolyte interface.77 The decreased performance of the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell operating with the benzoquinone/hydroquinone relay is then analogous to the poor performance of traditional DSSCs operating with more reversible redox mediators, such as the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple.77However, the advantages of using the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H redox mediator are balanced against the high overpotential required for NAD(P)H oxidation in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell. Thermodynamically, the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H couple operates as a two-electron mediator with a formal potential of −0.35 V vs. NHE at pH 8.0. Nonetheless, in order to oxidize NAD(P)H via two stepwise one-electron transfers, the dye radical cation must operate near 1 V vs. NHE. Consequently, much of the 1.9 eV free base–porphyrin excitation energy serves to supply the overpotential to make NAD(P)H oxidation proceed at a sufficiently rapid rate. This requirement for a highly oxidizing sensitizer dye constrains modification of the semiconductor/sensitizer dye pair used in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell.An intriguing approach towards improving the cell performance would be to modify the photoanode such that electrons are shuttled from the biofuel to the porphyrin radical cation at close to the thermodynamic potential of the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H redox couple (−0.35 V vs. NHE at pH 8). For this purpose, the dehydrogenase enzyme active site could be wired directly to the porphyrin radical cation,78,79 eliminating the need for the NAD(P) electron relay. Alternatively, a second redox enzyme (such as diaphorase)80 could be wired to the porphyrin radical cation, mediating electron transfers from NAD(P)H. In both of these cases, the enzymatic oxidation of biomass could occur as a concerted multi-electron process operating near the thermodynamic potential of the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H couple, with redox cofactors within the enzyme stabilizing the intermediates that would inevitably form when interfaced with a one-electron photochemical oxidant.Such modification of the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell would allow considerable flexibility in the choice of a semiconductor/sensitizer dye pair. In particular, for the 5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-10,15,20-tris(4-methylphenyl)porphyrin used as the sensitizer in the work described, the P˙+/P transition occurs at 1.23 V vs. NHE. Coupled with a 1.9 eV excitation energy, this places the P˙+/P* transition of the first excited-singlet state of the dye at −0.67 V vs. NHE, only slightly negative of the TiO2 conduction band at pH 8.0 (∼−0.63 V vs. NHE).3 In turn, the TiO2 conduction band is only modestly more reducing than the H+/H2 redox couple, contributing to the decreased performance of the cell under hydrogen backpressure (Fig. 7). However, if NAD(P)H could be oxidized closer to −0.35 V vs. NHE, then highly reducing semiconductor/sensitizer dye pairs could be explored; such as naphthalocyanines81 in conjunction with semiconductors such as SrTiO3 or ZrO2-doped TiO2.32,82-84 The outcomes of this modification would be enhanced driving force for hydrogen production and a decreased likelihood of charge recombination at a given partial pressure of hydrogen. Further, with the dye radical cation needing to operate only modestly positive of −0.35 V vs. NHE, considerably less excitation-energy would be required to inject electrons into an n-type semiconductor at a sufficiently reducing potential to produce hydrogen with a good yield. Consequently, far-red light absorbers could be studied that make better utilization of the solar spectrum, possibly increasing the energy conversion efficiency of the device.19, 85At present, the energy conversion efficiency of the un-optimized photoelectrochemical biofuel cell is understandably low, given the large overpotential for NAD(P)H oxidation, the high probability of charge recombination as hydrogen accumulates above the cathodic solution, and the high energy content of the initial biofuel substrate. Further, the in vitro enzyme catalysts in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell have demonstrated good stability in our laboratory;1 the long-term (t > 48 h) stability of these enzymes has not been investigated. Nevertheless, the fact that the energy stored in the biofuel ultimately represents solar energy converted via natural photosynthesis, and the versatility of the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell to oxidize a variety of biomass substrates,1 leaves open the possibility of photochemically reforming low-value waste materials into a high-value reduced fuel. However, as currently demonstrated, there is only a modest energy enhancement during the oxidation of biofuels, such as ethanol, with the concomitant production of a more reduced fuel such as hydrogen. Therefore, a second approach to improving the overall cell performance would be to extract electrons from a less energy-rich substrate, such as via the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen.86,87Part of the initial motivation for testing the benzoquinone/hydroquinone redox relay in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell was the hope of coupling the photoanode to the natural water-oxidizing enzyme, photosystem II, in a hybrid, dual-photosystem device. Such a situation has been previously reported,88 with photosystem II particles immobilized at the surface of a Ru-polypyridyl dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, and an electrical connection between the two photosystems established via a soluble benzoquinone/hydroquinone electron relay. The dissimilar spectral coverage of the Ru-based dye and the photosystem II chlorophylls allowed these dual photosystems to be placed in optical series, increasing the utilization of incident solar photons. Nonetheless, this system was only demonstrated to operate with the photoanode poised at a modestly oxidizing potential (0.2 V vs. SCE), and the immobilization of PSII was required to achieve sufficiently high local concentrations of hydroquinone at the photoanode surface.88 Our data suggest that charge recombination would significantly diminish the performance of such a device if wired to a low potential cathode for the photochemical splitting of water to O2 and H2. In contrast, hydrogen production has been reported for a dye-sensitized photoanode wired to a platinum cathode, using hydroquinone as a sacrificial electron donor.89 In that work, the hydrogen product was not quantified and the photocurrent observed with hydroquinone was substantially less than with iodide as the electron donor. Nonetheless, the report of hydrogen production in a DSSC from hydroquinone suggests that control of the interfacial dynamics to minimize the access of oxidized species in solution to the TiO2 surface and underlying TCO conductor is a possible means of minimizing the charge recombination reactions that were observed in our work.17,77, 90One design strategy for the production of a high-value reduced fuel from water would involve dual photosystems, tuned to operate at reducing and oxidizing potentials, respectively. The reducing photosystem could be designed as described above, such as with a naphthalocyanine dye and Zr-doped TiO2 semiconductor. The oxidizing photosystem could be designed with a higher-potential SnO2 semiconductor, a highly oxidizing dye,91 and an appropriate water oxidation catalyst.92,93 Interfacing these two photosystems using an appropriate redox relay, such as the I3−/I− couple, could result in a dual photosystem device capable of photochemical fuel production with electrons derived from water as a substrate.15,94-96 The ramifications of such a device could be relevant to addressing societal energy concerns.19,97-99ConclusionsThe photoelectrochemical biofuel cell couples the photochemical formation of a charge-separated state to the enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of a biomass-derived substrate and the production of a reduced fuel. Alternatively, the photochemical step can be coupled to a high potential cathode for electricity generation. The energy to drive these processes is provided both by incident photons and by solar energy stored in the chemical bonds of the biomass-derived substrate. Operation of the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell with a platinum cathode demonstrates that the transition between electricity generation and hydrogen formation can be controlled by the presence of oxygen in the cathodic solution. Comparison of the performance using either NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H or benzoquinone/hydroquinone as the anodic redox mediator demonstrates the influence of charge recombination in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell, and highlights the suitability of the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H couple for operation with a low-potential cathode. Appropriate redesign of the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell could in principle allow high rates of photochemical fuel production using either low-value, waste biomass or water as the anodic electron donor.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic representations of (a) an enzymatic biofuel cell, (b) a dye-sensitized solar cell, and (c) the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell. The operation of these devices is as described in the text.	 

 	Fig. 2  Transient absorption kinetic traces (650 nm excitation and 700 nm probe) recorded for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode in aerobic 0.25 M Tris, 0.10 M KCl (pH 8.0) buffer, under open-circuit conditions at 20 °C. Kinetic traces were recorded in the presence of 0 mM (), 1 mM (), 2 mM (), and 3 mM () NADH. The spectrum (inset) was recorded in the absence of NADH, 4 μs after 532 nm laser excitation.	 

 	Fig. 3  Current–voltage curves recorded for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode (operating in 0.25 M TES, 0.10 M KCl (pH 7.8) buffer, with 5 mM NADH present); wired to either a Hg/Hg2SO4 (saturated K2SO4) cathode (□), or an oxygen reducing platinum cathode () operating in 0.25 M TES, 0.10 M KCl (pH 7.8) buffer. Both traces were recorded under monochromatic illumination (520 nm, ∼0.9 mW cm−2). The higher open-circuit voltage observed with the Hg/Hg2SO4 cathode is attributable to this cathode operating at a more positive potential.	 

 	Fig. 4  Action spectrum of a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode (operating in 0.25 M TES, 0.10 M KCl (pH 7.8) buffer, with 8 mM NADH present), wired to an oxygen reducing platinum cathode operating in 0.25 M TES, 0.10 M KCl (pH 7.8) buffer. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE, ) maxima correspond to the light harvesting efficiency (LHE, ) maxima of the photoanode. The light intensity was ∼ 1 mW cm−2 for each wavelength investigated.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) The short-circuit photocurrent and (b) the hydrogen product detected by gas chromatography, for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode wired to an anaerobic platinum cathode; both operating in 0.25 M Tris, 0.10 M KCl (pH 8.0) buffer. The anodic solution contained 4 mM NADH (, ), or 4 mM NAD+/glucose dehydrogenase (GDH)/100 mM glucose (, ). Controls are shown for the NAD+/GDH/glucose solution operated in the absence of light (, □), porphyrin (, ), glucose (, ), GDH (, ) or NAD+, GDH, and glucose (, ). Broadband illumination was provided by a filtered Xe arc lamp (460 nm < λ < 1100 nm, ∼ 130 mW cm−2). Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 3.	 

 	Fig. 6  The short-circuit photocurrent for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode wired to a carbon felt (), carbon felt/CaHydA (), or platinum foil () cathode; operating in 0.10 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) buffer, with 10 mM NADH in the anodic solution. In each case, the electrochemically active surface area of the cathode was ∼ 3.5 cm2. Illumination was provided by a light-emitting diode (λmax = 520 nm, peak width at half-height = 50 nm, 3 mW cm−2). For the carbon felt/CaHydA electrode, an adsorbed hydrogenase film was formed and excess hydrogenase (1.6 U mL−1) was then maintained in the cathodic solution. Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 5.	 

 	Fig. 7  Data demonstrating the effect of hydrogen ‘back-pressure’ on the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell performance. A current–voltage profile (ν = 5 mV s−1) was obtained for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode under illumination (λ = 520 nm, 3 mW cm−2) (), and in the dark (), under potentiostatic control with a platinum counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference. Overlaid on the I–V profile is the short-circuit current obtained for the photoanode wired to a carbon felt/CaHydA (), or platinum () cathode in a two-electrode configuration, under 520 nm illumination (3 mW cm−2) with the pressure of H2 above the cathodic solution stepped to higher values. The inset shows the raw hydrogen ‘back-pressure’ data before being converted to V vs. Ag/AgCl by the Nernst equation. The conditions of the experiment are the same as those in Fig. 6. Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 5.	 

 	Fig. 8  Photocurrent for a porphyrin-sensitized photoanode, operating at 0 V vs. SCE, as a function of the concentration of the sacrificial electron donor: NADH (○), or 1,4-hydroquinone (). For NADH, the photoanode operated in 0.25 M Tris, 0.1 M KCl (pH 8.0) buffer. For hydroquinone, the photoanode operated in 0.1 M KCl, 25 mM each of citrate, phosphate, borate (pH 6.0) buffer. Broadband illumination (460 nm < λ < 1100 nm, ∼ 30 mW cm−2) was provided by a filtered Xe arc lamp. Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 4.	 

 	Fig. 9  Photocurrent for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, operating at 0 V vs. SCE with NAD+/NADH (○) or benzoquinone/hydroquinone (), as a function of the [Oxidized]/[Reduced] ratio for the sacrificial electron donor in the anodic solution. The conditions of the experiment are generally the same as those in Fig. 8. For the present data, the [Reduced] was held constant at 10 mM, while the [Oxidized] was varied from 0 to 50 mM. The data are the average of three replicates, with error bars representing one standard deviation. Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 4.	 

 	Fig. 10  Photocurrent for a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode operating under potentiostatic control, with a platinum counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference. The photocurrent was recorded after 1 minute of illumination at each potential step using NADH (○) or hydroquinone () as the sacrificial electron donor. The experimental conditions are the same as those reported in Fig. 8, with a 10 mM concentration of either NADH or 1,4-hydroquinone in the anodic solution. Data represented in this figure were originally reported in reference 4.
