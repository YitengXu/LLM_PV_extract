    , Accepted 26th November 2019First published on 27th November 2019AbstractInorganic hole transport material (HTM) NiO is superior to traditional organic HTMs due to its high stability and conductivity. Efficient charge separation and slow charge recombination are two key important steps in determining the efficiency of solar cells but they often show strong temperature dependence. Using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with ab initio time-domain density functional theory, we have demonstrated that the time scales for both hole transfer and electron–hole recombination show weak temperature dependence in MAPbI3/NiO perovskite solar cells. The hole transfer occurs on sub-100 fs at both high and low temperatures. Hole transfer proceeds slightly faster at high temperature than low temperature due to enhanced NA coupling. Notably, the hole remains hot over 200 fs energy relaxation before cooling to interact with the remaining electrons, form excitons and accelerate electron–hole recombination, providing an excellent advantage for solar energy applications. Following charge separation, the electron–hole recombination takes place in several nanoseconds at both low and high temperatures. The acceleration only by a factor of below 2 arises because increased atomic motions cause rapid loss of coherence, which competes successfully with the enhanced NA coupling. The detailed atomistic understanding of the reported results allows us to generalize the conclusions to other hole transport materials and suggests weak temperature-dependent charge dynamics properties enabling the high performance of perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites emerge as the most appealing light absorbers for efficient solar cells due to their promising optoelectronic properties, such as strong light absorption,1,2 long photo-carrier diffusion length,3–6 and low charge recombination rates.7,8 Shortly after some time, experiments showed many other unusual optoelectronic properties in hybrid perovskites, including the phonon bottleneck effect9 and anomalous temperature-dependent charge carrier lifetime.10,11 Both the effects favor enhancement of optoelectronic device performance by reducing nonradiative charge and energy losses.12,13 Inspired by the innovation of the classic MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+) perovskite solar cell for the first time with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%,14 the efficiency increased rapidly to 25.2% in the last decade.15 Besides the excellent properties of perovskites, the great improvement of the PCEs is also attributed to the high-performance of hole-transport materials (HTMs), such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)amino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)16 and poly(triarylamine).17 However, the low dielectric constants and weak Coulomb screening effects suppress the photoexcited exciton separation of free charge carriers in organic HTMs, constituting a critical obstacle for the improvement of the PCE. Furthermore, the low electrical conductivity of organic HTMs further hinders the transportation of free holes to the counter-electrode, accelerating charge recombination. Last but not least, the high cost and low thermal/light stability of these organic HTMs provide the significant barrier for large-scale application. Compared to the most commonly used organic HTMs, inorganic HTMs have been attracting intense attention due to the advantages of low cost, high dielectric constant, conductivity and stability.18–20
Recently, dozens of experiments have reported applications of inorganic HTMs, such as copper iodide (CuI) and copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN).18–20 In particular, NiO is a p-type semiconductor with a wide band gap (3.6 eV) and has a deep valence band of about 5.2 eV, which is close to that (−5.4 eV) of MAPbI3 perovskite and enables NiO to favor hole extraction.21 In addition, NiO can act as an electron-blocking interlayer for preventing electron leakage due to the very high conduction band offset between NiO (−1.8 eV) and MAPbI3 (−3.9 eV).21 In the year 2000, for the first time, Lindquist and coauthors applied NiO as a HTM into a dye sensitized solar cell and obtained a high open-circuit voltage of 1.5 V, but the overall PCE is low (∼0.39%).22 Irwin et al. replaced poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with NiO in polymer solar cells and achieved an enhanced performance and stability of the photovoltaic device.23 Stimulated by the success of these experiments, NiO as a HTM has been applied in perovskite solar cells and gained high PCEs.24–26 Recently, Ning and coauthors have obtained 21.6% PCE in inverted structure perovskite solar cells based on NiO HTMs.27,28 Generally, devices experience degradation at high temperature under the real operating conditions. As a result, thermal impact becomes a key factor for solar cell performance, not only affecting the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite materials but also influencing their charge dynamics. Experiments reported contradicting results that the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells either decreases at high temperature29 or is temperature independent.30 The charge carrier lifetime decreases as the temperature increases31 or prolongs at evaluated temperature32 due to charge localization from theoretical calculations.13 However, there is no theoretical work on this important aspect in the MAPbI3/NiO combined system because the challenge resides also in the often contrasting characteristics of the two interface components: organic versus inorganic materials, localized versus delocalized electronic states, well-ordered versus disordered phases, etc. Considering the importance of charge dynamics and the NiO HTM, it requires a detailed ab initio analysis of temperature-dependent charge transfer and recombination at the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction for design of high-performance perovskite solar cells.

Fig. 1 shows the energy levels involved in the photoinduced hole transfer and electron–hole recombination dynamics at the MAPbI3/NiO photovoltaic heterojunction. Photoexcitation of MAPbI3 results in hole transfer from MAPbI3 to NiO, ① following the separation, the electrons and holes recombine at the interface, ② the hole transfer, energy relaxation, and electron–hole recombination in the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction occur in parallel and compete with each other.

In the present work, we perform time-domain ab initio calculations to investigate the hole transfer and electron–hole recombination across the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction influenced by temperature. We consider a low temperature of 100 K and high temperature of 300 K. Our simulations demonstrate that both the time scales for hole transfer and electron–hole recombination show weak temperature dependence. The phenomena are associated primarily with the properties of the MAPbI3 perovskite, and therefore, they should apply to not only NiO, but also other inorganic HTMs. Further, the reported findings should apply to other metal halide perovskites. Photoexcitation of perovskites leads to hole transfer occurring for sub-100 fs, following the electron–hole recombination across the MAPbI3/NiO interface for a few nanoseconds, which agrees well with the experiment.24 Hole transfer takes places a bit faster at 300 K than at 100 K because the enhanced NA electron–phonon coupling arising due to the increased atomic fluctuations at evaluated temperature. Importantly, the holes remain hot for over 200 fs after the extraction, and therefore, they can move rapidly away from the interface prior to recombination with the remaining electrons. This situation is extremely important for organic HTMs because their weak Coulomb scattering effects tend to form excitons. Significant thermal motions also induce rapid loss of coherence, leading to the acceleration of electron–hole recombination only by a factor of less than 2 at high temperature compared to low temperature. The electron–hole recombination time scales of a few nanoseconds at both high and low temperatures minimize nonradiative charge and energy losses in MAPbI3/NiO solar cells. The study advances our fundamental understanding of the excited-state dynamics of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites and suggests the weak temperature-dependent hole injection and electron–hole recombination dynamic properties of perovskite solar cells.
2. Simulation methodology
By performing the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) combined with time-dependent Kohn–Sham density functional theory simulations,33 we investigated the temperature-dependent hole transfer and nonradiative electron–hole recombination dynamics across the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction using the fewest switching surface hopping (FSSH)34 and decoherence-induced surface hopping (DISH)35 algorithms, respectively. This is because FSSH overestimates the coherence and is generally incapable of describing the electron–hole recombination which is typically in the time scale range of hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds. As a result, decoherence correction must be incorporated into the surface hopping algorithm for simulating electron–hole recombination across a wide energy gap. DISH considers decoherence correction and reflects the nature of nuclei wave function branching. Both the FSSH and DISH are hybrid quantum-classical dynamic approaches, in which the lighter electrons and the heavier nuclei are described quantum mechanically and semi-classically, respectively. The FSSH and DISH approaches have been used to study the photoexcitation dynamics in a broad range of systems,36–46 including hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites,36–39 all inorganic perovskites37 and their heterojunction formed with WS2,40 metal oxides41 and interfaced with other donor materials,42,43,45 and so on.46 A detailed description of the theoretical approaches can be found in previous literature studies.47,48
The spin-polarized DFT calculations were employed for geometry optimization, adiabatic MD, and NA coupling calculations using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package.49 Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)50 and projector-augmented-wave (PAW)51 methods are used to treat the electron exchange–correlation interactions and electron–ion core interactions, respectively. The plane-wave energy cutoff is set to 400 eV. To describe the local properties of Ni 3d orbitals, the on-site Coulomb correction was applied on the Ni 3d electrons with U = 6.3 eV and J = 1 eV.52 Such a spin-polarized DFT+U approach is capable of correctly describing the magnetic ordering of NiO. All the calculations were performed at the Γ-point because the direct bandgap is at the Γ-point of the used large supercell. A 4 × 4 × 1 mesh grid was used to obtain accurate electronic properties. The van der Waals interactions were obtained by the Grimme DFT-D3 approach.53 After the geometry is relaxed at 0 K, the system was heated up to 100 K and 300 K for 2 ps with repeated velocity scaling. Then, 4 ps trajectories in the microcanonical ensemble were generated at 100 K and 300 K using the Verlet algorithm with the 1 fs time step. The first 1000 geometries were chosen from the 4 ps trajectory as initial conditions for NAMD simulations using the PYXAID code.47,48
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure
The periodically repeated MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction is formed between the 96-atom MAPbI3 (2 × 2) (100) surface and 108-atom NiO (3 × 3) (001) surface, in which the former and latter surfaces are constructed using the optimized pseudocubic phase MAPbI3 (ref. 54) and cubic phase NiO (ref. 55) with lattice constants of 6.29 and 4.12 Å supercell parameters of 12.58 Å along a and b directions and only gives rise to 0.22 Å lattice mismatch between the two slabs. A 15 Å vacuum was added normal to the surface to eliminate the ghost interaction between the system and its periodic images. We consider two configurations in which the NiO (001) surface interfaced with both MAI- and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 (100) surfaces, respectively. DFT calculations show that the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 (100)/NiO (001) heterojunction is much more stable than the latter case. As a result, we investigate the photoexcited hole transfer and electron–hole recombination using the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 (100)/NiO (001) heterojunction.

Fig. 2 shows the optimized structure of the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at 0 K (left panel), and snapshots chosen from the 4 ps MD trajectories at 100 (middle panel) and 300 K (right panel). At 0, 100 and 300 K, the covalent I–Ni bonds are formed at the interface, indicating that the interaction between the two materials is strong. In particular, the I–Ni bond length decreases from 3.475 Å at 0 K, to 3.298 Å at 100 K, and to 3.219 Å at 300 K, due to which thermal fluctuations bring the two materials closer to each other. The shorter I–Ni bond length and the stronger interfacial interaction generally favor rapid hole transfer and electron–hole recombination. In addition to the importance of the I–Ni bond length, the interaction between inorganic and organic components within perovskite and oxygen/nickel interaction also affect the charge dynamics. At 0 K, the MA cations reside uniformly inside the Pb–I inorganic cages, and both the inorganic framework of perovskite and NiO experience only small distortion. When heating the system to 100 K, NiO has a little distortion because it is rigid. The soft MAPbI3 experiences large distortion, including both inorganic octahedral tilting and random MA cation distribution. The distortion is enhanced further with the temperature increasing to 300 K. Focusing on the particular bond lengths, the calculated average Pb–I and O–Ni bond lengths in the optimized geometry are 3.211 and 2.088 Å, agreeing well with previously calculated DFT values.56,57 They increase to 3.221 and 2.114 Å at 100 K and to 3.475 and 2.118 Å at 300 K. The increased bond lengths within both the perovskite and NiO confirmed octahedral tilting and NiO expansion, manifested by the lengthened interfacial I–Ni bond length at elevated temperature. Interestingly, the Pb–I bond length increases by a factor of 7.9% while the O–Ni bond length increases only by a factor of 0.19% when the temperature increases from 100 K to 300 K, indicating that geometry change mostly happened within the perovskite rather than in the interfacial regime. This fact may have important impact on the charge dynamics.

To further investigate the influence of temperature on the nuclear dynamics, we calculated the standard deviation of the grouped atomic positions of MAPbI3 and NiO in the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at 100 and 300 K, Table 1. The computed data lead to two conclusions. First, MAPbI3 fluctuates more than NiO at both low and high temperatures because the perovskite is soft. Second, the overall atomic fluctuations at 300 K are larger than those at 100 K. The findings are well consistent with the reported bond lengths. Increased atomic fluctuations typically result in enhanced electron–vibrational interactions, accelerating hole transfer and charge recombination dynamics.

3.2 Electronic structure

Fig. 3 shows the spin-up projected density of states (PDOS) and charge densities of key orbitals participating in hole transfer and electron–hole recombination of the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction. The data at 100 K and 300 K are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The PDOS is separated into contributions from MAPbI3 and NiO components. The MAPbI3/NiO interface forms a type II band alignment heterojunction at both 100 and 300 K that are beneficial for efficient charge separation and slow charge recombination. On the one hand, besides the offset of VBMs between two materials provides a driving force for hole transfer, the transfer occurring within manifold of electronic valence states supplies another favorable factor because small energy gaps facilitate mixing of donor and acceptor state wave functions that enhances NA electron–phonon coupling. On the other hand, the donor and acceptor states for electron–hole recombination reside in the MAPbI3 and NiO receptively, separated by a wide energy gap of 1.86 eV at both 100 and 300 K, which usually leads to a slow dynamic process due to a small NA coupling. The canonically averaged energy offsets between donor and acceptor states for the hole transfer are calculated to be 0.52 and 0.51 eV at 100 and 300 K. Both values are largely sufficient to separate bounded electron–hole pairs in photoexcited MAPbI3 due to small exciton binding energy of tens of meV.58 The VBMs of MAPbI3 and NiO constitute the donor and acceptor states for hole transfer. At 100 K, the charge densities of donor (i) and acceptor (ii) orbitals are well-localized on MAPbI3 and NiO, respectively, leading to a small overlap of the donor and acceptor states. On increasing the temperature to 300 K, significant charge delocalization is seen in the hole donor state (iv), in which the charge density is shared by the MAPbI3 and NiO. The hole acceptor state (v) is also delocalized from the NiO onto the MAPbI3. The strength of NA coupling depends on both mixing of the wave functions, 〈ϕdonor|∇R|ϕacceptor〉, and nuclei velocity, dR/dt. Both factors are modestly enhanced at high temperature compared to those at low temperature, favoring an increased NA coupling and thus leading to fast hole transfer at high temperature. For charge recombination, the electron donor state (iii) is totally localized on the MAPbI3 and the acceptor state is localized on the NiO (ii) at 100 K. The situation minimizes the mixing of two wave functions and decreases the NA electron–phonon coupling, slowing the recombination. At 300 K, the charge densities of electron donor (iv) and acceptor (vi) states leaked from the NiO to the MAPbI3 at the interfacial regime, or vice versa. However, wave function mixing does not increase significantly and which indicates that the NA electron–phonon coupling may only increase slightly. The corresponding PDOS and charge densities of the key orbitals at 100 K and 300 K in the spin-down channel are presented in Fig. S1;† one can draw the same conclusion obtained from the analysis in the spin-up channel.

3.3 Hole transfer at the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction
In order to characterize the phonon modes that create the NA electron–phonon coupling and promote hole transfer, we computed the spectral densities by obtaining Fourier transforms (FT) of the energy gap fluctuations between the donor and acceptor states. Fig. 4 shows that low-frequency vibrational modes dominate the entire spectrum at both 100 and 300 K, which accommodate the electronic energy dissipating into heat during the hole transfer process, corresponding to 0.52 and 0.51 eV, respectively. Two-fold increase in temperature only increases 0.01 eV energy loss via hole-phonon relaxation. At 100 K, the domain peak at 100 cm−1 can be attributed to the Pb–I bond stretching modes.59 The peaks at 33 cm−1 can be ascribed to the [PbI6]4− octahedron twist motion.60 The main peak is split into side peaks at 300 K due to symmetry breaking induced by thermal impact, corresponding to the Pb–I bending and stretching modes at 60 and 110 cm−1.59 The peak around 200 cm−1 is associated with the liberation of the organic cations.59 The small peak at 445 cm−1 can be assigned to the first-order transverse optical phonon mode of NiO.61 Both the modes are activated at high temperature. The higher intensity of the main peaks and a broader range of phonon modes involved at high temperature accelerate hole transfer compared to that at low temperature.
 Fig. 4  Spectral density computed from FT of the fluctuations of the energy gaps between the donor and acceptor states for hole transfer in the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at 100 K and 300 K. Higher intensities of main peaks and a much broader range of phonon modes available at high temperature enhance electron–phonon coupling and accelerate hole transfer. 

Fig. 5 shows the hole transfer and energy relaxation dynamics at 100 and 300 K. Parts a and b of Fig. 5 show the hole transfer while parts c and d of Fig. 5 demonstrate the energy loss. We fit Fig. 5a and b with a combination of exponents and Gaussian,  The hole transfer time is obtained by taking a weighted average of the two times τ = A × τ1 + B × τ2. The time scales presented in Fig. 5c and d are obtained by fitting the curves to an exponent:. The orders of magnitude of hole transfer time scales are the same and show weak temperature dependence. The sub-100 fs hole transfer time scale agrees well with the experimental data at room temperature.24 Hole transfer is slightly faster at 300 K than at 100 K for several reasons. First, the donor–acceptor interaction is stronger at 300 K than at 100 K, manifested by the notable delocalization of the donor and acceptor states for hole transfer, Fig. 4. Second, the 2-dimensional maps of NA coupling between all pairs of electronic orbitals involved in the photoinduced hole transfer presented in Fig. 6 further indicate that the strength of NA coupling at 300 K is stronger than that at 100 K, indicating that higher temperature favors charge separation. Interestingly, the NA coupling between states that are close in energy is notably larger than the couplings between states having larger energy gaps. This observation indicates that hops between the nearest neighbor orbitals are more likely than transitions leading to exchange of large amounts of energy between charges and vibrations. The results agree with the fact that low frequency modes dominate the hole transfer and relaxation, Fig. 4. The computed average absolute value of the NA coupling between the nearest neighboring states is 62.3 and 23.1 meV at 300 and 100 K, respectively. Larger NA coupling leads to faster hole transfer.
 Fig. 5  Charge separation dynamics at 100 and 300 K. Top panels show the population decay of the hole donor state at (a) 100 K and (b) 300 K. Bottom panels show the hole energy decay at (c) 100 K and (d) 300 K. The hole transfer is faster than energy relaxation. Hole transfer at both temperatures occur on ultrafast time scales due to the high density of acceptor states and strong NA coupling. The transfer is even faster at 300 K owing to much stronger NA coupling compared to that at 100 K. 
 Fig. 6  Visualization of the averaged NA coupling between orbitals in the valence band for hole transfer in the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at (a) 100 K and (b) 300 K. NA coupling at 300 K is larger than that at 100 K, accelerating hole transfer at high temperature. 
The obtained sub-100 fs hole transfer time ensures that the photogenerated holes can be successfully extracted by the HTMs because the time scale is much shorter than the charge carrier cooling time for CH3NH3PbI3 reported experimentally, which occurs on sub-1 ps.62 Furthermore, holes losing energy to phonons at 100 and 300 K take similar time scales, which are over 3 times longer than the corresponding hole transfer time. Both the rapid hole transfer and the long-lived “hot” hole are beneficial for solar energy conversion because it guarantees that photoexcited holes can be effectively separated and injected into the hole acceptor materials before cooling.
3.4 Electron–hole recombination
In addition to charge separation and relaxation, perovskite solar cell performance is influenced by charge recombination since it constitutes the major pathway for the energy loss. Fig. 7a shows the electron–hole recombination in the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at 100 K and 300 K. Fitting the data using the short-time linear approximation to the exponential decay , we obtained the recombination times, summarized in Table 2. The decoherence correction shows significant importance of electron–hole recombination because the loss of coherence takes place much faster than the quantum transitions.63 The decoherence, in analogy to pure-dephasing and show time, is computed by the second-order cumulant approximation of optical response theory.64 We obtained the pure-dephasing times by fitting the pure-dephasing functions in Fig. 7b to a Gaussian function exp(−0.5(t/τ)2), Table 2. The pure-dephasing time at 300 K is shorter than that at 100 K, 5.6 and 6.8 fs, respectively. Besides the stronger atomic fluctuations, the 1.6-fold larger initial value of the unnormalized autocorrelation functions (un-ACF) of the bandgap fluctuations (Table 2) at 300 K than that at 100 K is also responsible for the shorter decoherence time at high temperature.

The calculated 2.43 ns electron–hole recombination time scale for the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at 300 K, Table 2, agrees well with the experimental data measured at room temperature.24 On decreasing the temperature to 100 K, the electron–hole recombination time extends to 4.60 ns. The deceleration by a factor of 1.9 is because the reduced NA coupling (1.10 vs. 1.58 meV) competes successfully with longer pure-dephasing time.

Fig. 7c shows the spectral densities of the CBM-VBM bandgap for the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at 100 and 300 K, identifying the phonon modes accelerating the recombination. Similar to the spectral densities for hole transfer (Fig. 4), low-frequency vibrations in the range of 30–200 cm−1 contribute primarily to the FT. These modes originate from the perovskite which is sensitive to temperature compared to rigid NiO. At 100 K, the small peak near 32 and the dominant peak at 100 cm−1 are also seen here, corresponding to the [PbI6]4− octahedron twist60 and Pb–I stretching,59 respectively. At 300 K, those peaks broaden and split due to significant geometry distortion. The peak above 200 cm−1 can be ascribed to liberation of the MA cations.59 The higher intensity and broader frequencies at 300 K than 100 K accelerate decoherence (5.6 vs. 6.8 fs) and enhance NA coupling (1.58 vs. 1.10 meV).
For an efficient solar cell, fast charge separation and slow electron–hole recombination are prerequisites while the two factors are usually in contradiction with each other. Thanks to the strong donor–acceptor interactions and manifold of electronic states involved, the time scale for hole transfer shows weak dependence on temperature. Interestingly, the electron–hole recombination takes place between the CBM and VBM, in which the recombination time scale is shortened by only a factor of 1.9 when the temperature is increased from 100 to 300 K, due to small NA electron–phonon coupling. The small drop also suggests that charge recombination is weakly depending on temperature, which enables perovskite solar cells possessing high performance. Hole injection and electron–hole recombination dynamics in the spin-down channel are shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† The obtained time scales agree well with the data in the spin-up channel, Fig. 5 and 7a. The results obtained from the spin-up dynamics hold for the spin-down dynamics. One may wonder whether the obtained weak dependence of hole transfer and electron–hole recombination dynamics are valid or not at higher temperature, and therefore, we performed spin-polarization MD at 400 K and calculated the PDOS and charge densities of the relevant key orbitals in the spin-up (Fig. S4a†) and spin-down (Fig. S4b†) channels using the chosen representative snapshot, Fig. S4.† First, the averaged energy offset between the donor and acceptor states is 0.52 eV in the spin-up channel, which is consistent with the values obtained at 100 K and 300 K. Second, the canonically averaged bandgap of the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at 400 K is calculated to be 1.79 eV in the spin-up channel and only reduces by 0.07 eV compared with that at 100 and 300 K, Table 2. Third, the distribution of donor and acceptor charge densities for hole transfer and electron–hole recombination remains almost unchanged relative to that at 300 K. As a result, it is anticipated that the charge dynamics may only experience slight change at 400 K. However, thermal energy losses still constitute the major obstacle for limiting the perovskite solar cell performance under real working conditions.
4. Conclusions
Using a combination of NAMD and TD-DFT simulations, we investigated temperature-dependent hole transfer and nonradiative electron–hole recombination in the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction. The simulations demonstrate that the time scales for hole transfer and electron–hole recombination show weak temperature dependence, enabling the perovskite solar cells possessing high performance. The charge separation via hole transfer is efficient since the driving force is largely sufficient to separate bonded electron–hole pairs. The hole transfer is slightly faster at high temperature than at low temperature due to the larger NA coupling arising from stronger mixing of donor and acceptor wave functions assisted by significant thermal impact at high temperature, providing with the proof of the shortened interfacial covalent I–Ni bond. The obtained sub-100 fs shows excellent agreement with experimental data. The computed electron–hole recombination occurs on around 5 ns at low temperature and only shows a drop of less than 2 at high temperature, in which the excited-state still exists over 2 ns and is significantly longer than that of the well-established other solar cells, such as TiO2 sensitized with semiconducting42 and metallic nanoparticles,47 transition metal dichalcogenides and their heterojunctions,46 and so on. The study suggests that balanced charge separation and recombination play key roles in obtaining high performance perovskite solar cells.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Schematic of the photoinduced charge separation and recombination dynamics. Photoexcitation of MAPbI3 leads to hole transfer to NiO, ① following hole transfer, electrons and holes recombine at the MAPbI3/NiO interface, ②.	 

 	Fig. 2  Optimized geometries of the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at 0 K and representative snapshots of MD trajectories at 100 K and 300 K.	 


100 K	0.119	0.086	0.157
300 K	0.140	0.104	0.180

 	Fig. 3  Spin-up projected densities of states (PDOSs) of the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at (a) 100 K and (b) 300 K obtained using the geometry shown in Fig. 2. Charge densities of the donor (i and iv) and acceptor (ii and v) orbitals for the hole transfer and donor (iii and vi) orbital for the electron–hole recombination at 100 and 300 K.	 

 	Fig. 4  Spectral density computed from FT of the fluctuations of the energy gaps between the donor and acceptor states for hole transfer in the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at 100 K and 300 K. Higher intensities of main peaks and a much broader range of phonon modes available at high temperature enhance electron–phonon coupling and accelerate hole transfer.	 

 	Fig. 5  Charge separation dynamics at 100 and 300 K. Top panels show the population decay of the hole donor state at (a) 100 K and (b) 300 K. Bottom panels show the hole energy decay at (c) 100 K and (d) 300 K. The hole transfer is faster than energy relaxation. Hole transfer at both temperatures occur on ultrafast time scales due to the high density of acceptor states and strong NA coupling. The transfer is even faster at 300 K owing to much stronger NA coupling compared to that at 100 K.	 

 	Fig. 6  Visualization of the averaged NA coupling between orbitals in the valence band for hole transfer in the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at (a) 100 K and (b) 300 K. NA coupling at 300 K is larger than that at 100 K, accelerating hole transfer at high temperature.	 

 	Fig. 7  Electron–hole recombination dynamics (a), pure-dephasing functions for the VBM-CBM energy gap (b), and spectral density obtained using Fourier transforms of the autocorrelation functions for the VBM-CBM energy gap (c) of the MAPbI3/NiO heterojunction at 100 K and 300 K, respectively.	 

100 K	1.86	1.10	6.8	0.0086	4.60
300 K	1.86	1.58	5.6	0.0135	2.43
