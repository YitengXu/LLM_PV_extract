Generally, the ideal donor materials should have an appropriate electronic structure to absorb more sunlight and drive charge separation and to form an optimized morphology that can efficiently split excitons and collect charges. 2-Alkylthieno[3,4-b]thiophene (T34bT) as an electron-rich moiety possesses three features that are highly desirable for donor materials: (i) to modulate electronic structure; (ii) to manipulate the blend morphology of the active layer; (iii) to function as the π-bridge to link donor and acceptor moieties. We report herein a new category of small molecules STB-n based on the electron-rich T34bT moiety. STB-n featuring T34bT and rhodanine components showed intense absorption, reduced bandgap, and proper alignment of frontier orbital energy levels. Because of the optimized charge-transport properties and weak charge recombination, STB-3-based solar cells exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 9.26%, which is among the best reported for small-molecule-based solar cells. The relationships among molecular structure, thin-film morphology, and device performance were further investigated systematically.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells have been attracting much attention because of the potential for producing low-cost, large-area, and flexible PV panels.1–3 For the classic organic solar cells using fullerene acceptors, the ideal donor materials are expected to have an appropriate electronic structure to absorb more sunlight and drive charge separation and to form an optimized morphology that can efficiently split excitons and collect charges. During the last decade, copolymer or small-molecule donor materials designed by “D–A” or quinoid approaches have significantly contributed to the development of BHJ organic solar cells, leading to high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 9%.4–8 As is well recognized, most high-performance donor materials are comprised by electron-donating and electron-withdrawing building blocks. Among various π-building blocks, oligothiophene (OT)9–13 is a frequently used and indispensible component. Firstly, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels can be modulated by selecting OT with a suitable chain length to obtain balanced high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc).14,15 Secondly, the alkyl chains of OTs can effectively tune blend morphology of the active layer.16–18 Besides, OT always functions as a π-bridge to link donor and acceptor moieties.19
In comparison with the linearly connected OT,20 fused OTs with more rigid structures20 exhibit an extended π-conjugation and have also been successfully applied in organic solar cells. Depending on the fusing modes, there are four kinds of thienothiophenes including thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (T32bT), thieno[2,3-b]thiophene (T23bT), thieno[3,4-c]thiophene (T34cT), and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (T34bT) as shown in Fig. 1. Except the unstable T34cT, T34bT21 is unique because of its fully delocalized conjugation and quinoid-enhancing effect.22,23 Thus, T34bTs with electron-withdrawing substituents such as ester,24 ketone,25 and fluorine groups26,27 have been successfully utilized as electron-deficient moieties for the design of polymer donor materials as represented by the commercially available PTB7 and PTB7-Th. By contrast, 2-alkylthieno[3,4-b]thiophene28 is an electron-rich moiety that possesses the aforementioned characteristics of OT, but is rarely applied in BHJ solar cells.29

In the current work, a series of new small-molecule donor materials, STB-1, STB-2, and STB-3, in which alkyl-substituted T34bT served as an electron-rich bridge to link the weak electron-donating benzodithiophene (BDT) and the strongly electron-withdrawing rhodanine were designed and synthesized (Fig. 1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) indicated that these T34bT-bridged molecules would have a reduced bandgap and a shallow HOMO, in comparison with a thiophene-bridged molecule (STB-r). Time-dependent DFT calculations showed that STB-n molecules had better absorption coefficients and a wider absorption wavelength. The T34bT–rhodanine combination has several distinct advantages for target molecules: (i) better molecular planarity; (ii) quinoidal resonance coupled with strong electron-acceptor units; (iii) large molecular π-surface to facilitate molecule–PCBM interaction; and (iv) fine-tuning of the thin-film morphology through selection of a suitable alkyl group. STB-n molecules were applied in solar cell devices, showing PCE values in excess of 9%, which is one of the best reported for small-molecule systems.8,14,17,30,31 Structural characterizations showed that side-chain substitution on T34bT and rhodanine moieties were critical for the crystallization and phase separation in the BHJ blends, which can be effectively controlled by using a solvent vapor annealing (SVA) process.
2. Results and discussion
Materials preparation
The general synthetic route used to prepare the STB-n series is shown in Fig. 2. Key intermediates 4 and 5 were synthesized from T34bT-stannane units 2 and 3, respectively,32 and the BDT unit by a Stille coupling reaction. Compounds 4 and 5 were rapidly passed through a silica-gel column and used without further purification because of their relatively low stability. Dialdehydes 6 and 7 were obtained in 54 and 36% yield, respectively (two steps from compounds 4 and 5). Target molecules STB-1, STB-2, and STB-3 were synthesized by Knoevenagel reaction between compounds 6 or 7 and either 3-methylrhodanine or 3-ethylrhodanine in 84, 70, and 79% yield (after recrystallization), respectively, as black solids. The reference compound STB-r with a thiophene linker was also synthesized by using 2-hexyldecyl and terminal octyl chains to promote solubility. STB-n materials for device fabrication were purified by silica-gel column chromatography and subsequently recrystallized in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE)/ethanol (EtOH) three times. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that STB-1, STB-2, and STB-3 were stable up to 364, 368, and 365 °C, respectively (5 wt% loss, Fig. S3 in the ESI†).

Absorption and electrochemical properties
The photophysical and electrochemical properties of STB-n were summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of STB-n were examined in dilute solutions in dichloromethane (Fig. 3a). All three STB-n derivatives showed the same absorption maximum (λabsmax) at 625 nm, with high coefficients (ε) of 1.12 × 105 M−1 cm−1. In contrast, STB-r showed a less intense absorption at 518 nm (ε = 0.752 × 105 M−1 cm−1). In thin films, the STB-n series showed a new peak at approximately 678–686 nm, arising from intermolecular π–π stacking (Fig. 3b). The optical bandgaps were determined to be 1.67–1.69 eV for all these materials based on the absorption onsets in thin films. It should be noted that the slightly bathochromically shifted absorption of STB-1 suggests a higher level of chain aggregation. For comparison, DR3TBDTT, with extended terthiophene bridges developed by Chen et al.,33 showed a wider optical bandgap of 1.72 eV. The electrochemical properties of STB-n were examined in n-Bu4NClO4 dichloromethane solution (1.0 M) and calibrated with Fc+/Fc. In contrast to DR3TBDTT and STB-r, the cyclic voltammogram measurements of STB-n showed reversible oxidative and reversible reductive traces, indicating their good electrochemical stability (Fig. 3c). The HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were determined to be −5.09 and −3.50 eV, respectively, which resulted in electrochemical bandgaps of 1.59 eV. STB-r showed deeper HOMO (−5.29 eV) and higher LUMO (−3.38 eV) energy levels, resulting in a wider electrochemical bandgap of 1.91 eV. The LUMO energy level of DR3TBDTT was higher than those of STB-n: −3.27 in comparison to −3.50 eV. Meanwhile, the HOMO energy levels were quite similar. Thus, the T34bT moiety appears to be more effective in reducing bandgaps than are thiophene/terthiopene units, because T34bT has a larger aromatic core and may form a quinoidal resonance, which agrees well with theoretical predictions. The large bathochromic shift from STB-r to STB-n showed the benefits of connecting quinoid-enhancing T34bT with an end-capping electron acceptor.

Photovoltaic performance
BHJ organic solar cells based on STB-n were fabricated and optimized in a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/STB-n:PC71BM/Ca/Al and tested under AM 1.5 G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). The results are summarized in Table 2. The optimized donor/acceptor blend ratio was 1:1.5. Chloroform was used as the casting solvent. For as-cast devices, STB-r showed a poor PCE of 1.39%, and STB-1 showed a good PCE of 5.90%. In comparison with STB-1, STB-2, with branched EH chains on the T34bTs, showed a slightly lower PCE of 5.5%, a significantly reduced fill factor (FF) of 47%, and an improved Jsc of 12.12 mA cm−1. STB-3, with methyl-substituted rhodanines, showed PCEs of 6.4%. Chloroform vapor was then used to anneal the BHJ thin film to optimize the morphology.34 The performance of all STB-n-based solar cells showed significant improvement. The STB-1 device showed a PCE of 6.61% with a higher Jsc of 11.20 mA cm−1 and a FF of 63%. The STB-2 device showed PCEs of up to 7.84% with a Jsc of 13.12 mA cm−1, and a FF of 66%. The device Voc reduced significantly from 0.96 to 0.90 V. PCEs of STB-3 could be increased to 8.47% after SVA annealing, with a high Jsc of 13.03 mA cm−1 and FF of 71%, and only a minor reduction of Voc (22 mV). A simple device optimization by using a poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) cathode interlayer further enhanced the PCE to 9.26%, arising from a simultaneous improvement in both Jsc and Voc. This was attributed to the enhanced charge-transport and collection efficiency of the cathode modification.35 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of optimal STB-n-based devices, which exhibit a similar broad spectral response in the range of 300–800 nm are presented in Fig. 4b. In STB-3-based devices with a PFN cathode interlayer, high EQEs of over 60% between a wide range of wavelengths were recorded (480–700 nm with a peak value of 70% at 615 nm). The Jsc values calculated by integrating the respective EQE curves of STB-n-based devices were consistent with those from photovoltaic tests (3% error).

 Fig. 4  (a) Characteristic density vs. voltage (J–V) curves and (b) external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the optimized devices under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). 
The carrier transport properties of the optimized donor/acceptor blends were examined by using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). By fitting the J–V curves from both hole- and electron-only devices, the carrier mobilities of STB-n:PC71BM blends were determined; the results are summarized in Table 2. For the as-cast blends, the hole- and electron-mobilities for the STB-1:PC71BM blend (μe: 2.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μh: 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the STB-2:PC71BM blends (μe: 2.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μh: 1.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) were similar. STB-3:PC71BM blends showed more improvement in the electron mobility (μe: 4.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μh: 2.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) in comparison with the other two derivatives. Thus, alkyl-chain substitution on rhodanine units was critical. With SVA, the carrier transport for both electrons and holes improved significantly. Among the three materials, the STB-3:PC71BM blend exhibited the highest and most balanced carrier mobilities (μe: 5.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μh: 3.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μe/μh: 1.36). Thus, it is reasonable that the STB-3 SVA device gave the best performance. The dependence of the net photocurrent Jph (Jph = Jlight − Jdark; where Jlight and Jdark are the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively) on the effective applied voltage Veff (Veff = V0 − V; where V is the applied voltage, and V0 denotes the compensation voltage when Jph = 0)36 was used to analyze the basic properties of the devices (Fig. S6 in the ESI†). The saturation current densities (Jsat) were 12.2, 13.9, and 13.5 mA cm−2 for the SVA-treated STB-n devices, respectively. High Jph/Jsat values were 0.92, 0.94, and 0.96 under short-circuit conditions. The Jph/Jsat values under the maximum power points were systematically increased: 70% for STB-1, 77% for STB-2, and 84% for STB-3, suggesting that exciton dissociation and charge collection in STB-3-based solar cells were far superior. Under short-circuit conditions, the dependence of Jph on different light intensities was examined to probe the charge recombination (Fig. S7 in the ESI†). The recombination parameters (α) determined by using the power-law equation, Jph ∝ Pα (P: light intensity), were all close to 1.0, indicating the weak bimolecular recombination, especially in STB-3-based solar cells with a PFN cathode interlayer (α: 0.992).37,38
Thin-film morphology
For BHJ solar cells, the thin-film morphology of the active layer determines the efficiency of charge separation and collection. The morphologies of the STB-n:PC71BM blends were investigated by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD), resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GIXD 2-D scattering images and the corresponding out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line cut profiles are shown in Fig. 5. All as-cast STB-n:PC71BM blended thin films showed similar crystalline features, with an alkyl-to-alkyl chain stacking peak at 0.33 Å−1 (the corresponding lamellae packing distance is 1.90 nm) and a PCBM scattering ring at 1.35 Å−1. The π–π stacking peak was quite weak, and no obvious crystal orientation was evident. When SVA was processed, the enhanced molecular mobility led to a better ordering in the BHJ thin films and the differences in the chemical structures led to dissimilarities in the crystalline structure. As in STB-1 blends, a sharp scattering showed up at 0.31 Å−1, which corresponds to a slightly larger lamella packing distance. A weak π–π stacking peak was seen at approximately 1.80 Å−1. In STB-2 blends, where EH side chains were attached to T34bT units, the (100) diffraction peak became split. A major peak at 0.31 Å−1 and a secondary peak at 0.38 Å−1 were observed, which suggests that, for STB-1, the octyl side-chain substitution on the T34bT units led to a side-chain length comparable to that of the thienyl-EH side chains on the BDT unit, suggesting that the lattice parameters would be comparable. However, when the T34bT unit was substituted with an EH side chain, this did not occur, with the crystal packing falling into two different types of structures dictated by the dominance of side-chain interactions. The STB-3 blends introduced a methyl group into the rhodanine units, which reduced the molecular solubility. The (100) diffraction peak was dominated by the 0.31 Å−1 diffraction with a low-intensity shoulder that is presumably of the same origin as that in STB-2 blends. Thus, fine-tuning minor structural factors in the molecules can be an important way to manipulate molecular assemblies and improve performance.

Phase separation between donor molecules and PCBM was investigated by TEM and RSoXS, for which 284.2 eV photon energy was used. As shown in Fig. 6 (right), the as-cast STB-1:PC71BM blends showed an intense maximum in the scattering at 0.011 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of 57 nm. For the as-cast STB-2:PC71BM blends, the intensity of the reflection was much weaker, indicating that the extent of phase separation was much less, which is consistent with the structureless TEM image. The characteristic length scale of the phase-separated morphology was 26.2 nm. The intensity of the RSoXS reflection for STB-3:PC71BM was between that of STB-1:PC71BM and STB-2:PC71BM, whereas the characteristic length scale of the phase-separated morphology was 26.2 nm, similar to that of STB-2:PC71BM, which is also consistent with the TEM images in which the definition of the domain structures was between that of STB-1:PC71BM and STB-2:PC71BM. Consequently, the side chain can clearly be used to manipulate the extent of mixing in BHJ blends, which, in turn, could be correlated with the performance of the device. The structure–property relationship was better demonstrated in SVA samples. As shown in Fig. 6 (right), for STB-1:PC71BM, at a blend ratio of 1:1.5, after SVA treatment, the characteristic length scale of the phase-separated morphology decreased to 42 nm. The (100) peak, which intensified markedly during SVA, from the in-plane line cut profile was observed at 0.33 Å−1, corresponding to a spacing of 18.8 nm. A shoulder was observed at 0.38 Å−1, corresponding to a spacing of 16.5 nm. This suggests that there were two distinct crystalline domains formed, in which the length and number of the substituents constituting the side chains give rise to the two different distances. For the STB-2 and STB-3 BHJ blends, SVA treatment led to enhanced scattered intensities, but the characteristic domain size remained constant at 0.024 Å−1, corresponding to a characteristic length scale of 26.2 nm. This well-developed, small phase separation is beneficial to device function, and is highly desirable for exciton diffusion and dissociation.39 For the STB-2 blend, a distinct reflection, as opposed to a shoulder, was observed at 0.38 Å−1, whereas for the STB-3 blend, a shoulder, slightly stronger than for the STB-1 blend, was observed at 0.38 Å−1 or a distance of 16.5 nm. From these data, we can conclude that the SVA process refined the phase-separated morphologies of the blends, allowing the domains to become better defined, purer, and of a size that is conducive to device performance. The interchain packing (along (100)) was significantly enhanced with SVA, and evidence for two types of interchain packing was noted. The relative concentration of this second type of interchain packing increased on going from STB-1 to STB-3, for which only a shoulder suggested the existence for these two types of interchain packing, to STB-2, for which two different interchain distances were evident. From these data, it is clear that the most critical parameter that correlates to the performance of these materials is the size scale and purity of the domains in the phase-separated morphology and then the intermolecular stacking.

3. Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized a new category of small-molecule donors (STB-n) based on an electron-rich T34bT moiety. In contrast to STB-r, STB-n featuring the T34bT and rhodanine combinations showed intense absorption, reduced bandgap, suitable frontier orbital energy levels, and good electrochemical stability. Side-chain substitution was used to fine-tune the physical properties as well as the interaction with PCBM to optimize the performance of the device. By applying SVA treatment, an impressively high PCE of 9.26% was obtained for STB-3-based solar cells, which is among the best that has been reported for small-molecule-based solar cells. The relationship between molecular structure, thin-film morphology, and device performance was systematically investigated by a combination of TEM, GIXD, and RSoXS measurements. Based on its excellent electronic and morphology tunability, we believe that the electron-rich 2-alkylthieno[3,4-b]thiophene could be very promising for the design of high-performance organic photovoltaic materials.

Materials and general methods
All reactions involving air- or moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out in a dry reaction vessel under a positive pressure of nitrogen. Unless stated otherwise, starting materials were obtained from Adamas, Aldrich, or J&K and were used without further purification. Anhydrous THF, toluene, and DMF were distilled over Na/benzophenone prior to use. Anhydrous DMF was distilled over CaH2 prior to use. Compounds 2 and 3 (ref. 32) were prepared according to published procedures. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured with Bruker Fourier 300, Bruker Avance 400, or Bruker Avance 600 spectrometers. Chemical shifts for hydrogens are reported in parts per million (ppm, δ scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to the residual protons in the NMR solvent (CDCl3: δ 7.26). 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 100 MHz. Chemical shifts for carbons are reported in parts per million (ppm, δ scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to the carbon resonance of the solvent (CDCl3: δ 77.2). The data are presented as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet and/or multiple resonances, br = broad), coupling constant in hertz (Hz), and integration. MALDI measurements were performed with a MALDI-FT 9.4 T, Bruker solariX, or MALDI-TOF MS Bruker Autoflex III. Elemental analyses were performed with a Flash EA 1112 Series from ThermoQuest. UV-vis and fluorescence spectra were recorded with Jasco V-570 and Jasco FP-6600 spectrometers, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with a CHI620D potentiostat. All measurements were carried out in a one-compartment cell under a nitrogen atmosphere, equipped with a glassy-carbon electrode, a platinum counter-electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The supporting electrolyte was a 0.1 mol L−1 dichloromethane solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP). All potentials were corrected against Fc/Fc+. CV was measured with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Shimadzu DTG 60 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere with runs recorded from room temperature to 550 °C.

To an oven-dried round-bottom flask loaded with compound 1 (0.291 g, 0.35 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (2.5 mL) and toluene (2.5 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere, was added tributyl(2-octylthieno[3,4-b]thiophen-6-yl)stannane 2 (0.455 g, 0.84 mmol) or tributyl(2-(2-ethylhexyl)thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-6-yl)stannane 3 (0.455 g, 0.84 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (40 mg, 0.035 mmol). The reaction was stirred and heated to 90 °C for 2 days in the dark. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted three times with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was separated, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was quickly passed through a silica-gel column and used for the next step without further purification.

Solar cell fabrication and characterization
Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol for 20 min each, and were then UV/ozone treated. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP Al 4083) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then baked at 150 °C for 10 min. The substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. A solution of STB-n and PC71BM (25 mg mL−1) in chloroform was spin-coated at different spin rates on the top of the substrate. The films were solvent vapor annealed by placing the substrates in a glass Petri dish containing 100 μL of chloroform. A thin layer of PFN and an 80 nm Al layer were then deposited under high vacuum. The active area of the solar cells was 3.08 mm2 as defined by shadow masks. The J–V curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter. The AM 1.5 G solar irradiation was simulated by using a 300 W xenon arc solar simulator (Oriel) under 100 mW cm−2. The illumination intensity was calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was obtained with IPCE equipment (XES-70S1).
SCLC mobility measurements were tested in electron-only devices with the device structures of glass/Al/active layer/Al and hole-only device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au. The mobilities were calculated by fitting the SCLC model:  where J is the current, ε0 is the zero-field mobility, εr is the permittivity of the free space, μ0 is the relative permittivity of the material, L is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage in the devices.
GIXD characterization
Grazing incidence X-ray scattering characterization of the thin films was performed at the Advanced Light Source on beamline 7.3.3, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). Thin-film samples were spin-cast onto PEDOT:PSS-covered SiO2 wafers. The scattering signal was recorded with a 2D detector (Pilatus 2M) with a pixel size of 0.172 × 0.172 mm. The samples were approximately 15 mm long in the direction of the beam path, and the detector was located at a distance of approximately 300 mm from the sample center (distance calibrated by using a silver behenate standard). An incidence angle of 0.16° was selected, which gave the optimal signal-to-background ratio. The beam energy was 10 keV, operating at top-off mode. Typically, 30 s exposure time was used to collect diffraction signals. All GIXD experiments were performed in a helium atmosphere. The data were processed and analyzed using the Nika software package.
RSoXS characterization
RSoXS was performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 Advanced Light Source, LBNL. Thin-film samples were spin-cast onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS-covered SiO2 wafers. The BHJ composite films were then spin-cast on the top of the SiO2/PEDOT:PSS substrates under the same conditions as those for the fabrication of solar cell devices. The BHJ thin film was then flown in water, and transferred to a silicon nitride window. The scattering signals were collected in vacuum with a Princeton Instrument PI-MTE CCD camera.
TEM characterization
The transmission electron microscope investigation was performed on a JEOL JEM2010FIF operated at 200 kV. The specimen for TEM measurement was prepared by spin casting the blend solution on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate, then floating the film on a water surface, and transferring to TEM grids.
