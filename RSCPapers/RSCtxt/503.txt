    , Accepted 9th April 2019First published on 29th April 2019AbstractThe red-emitting Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor with a superior quantum efficiency and suitable emission spectrum has been widely used as a promising down-conversion material in white light-emitting diodes. However, its thermal degradation under high temperature handicaps its large scale application, and therefore must be reduced. Here, we proposed to increase the thermal stability of Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ by coating a nanometer-order Al2O3 film on each phosphor particle using an atomic layer deposition approach in a fluidized bed reactor. The deposited Al2O3 layer was quite uniform and conformal when using O3 as the oxidizer, and its thickness could be controlled by the dosage type, deposition temperature and cycle numbers, which largely affects the photoluminescence properties and thermal degradation of the title phosphor. Thermal gravimetric analysis results showed that the oxidation temperature of the coated phosphor increased from 700 to 850 °C, suggesting that the coating layer has the function of anti-oxidation. Meanwhile, the coated phosphor particle surface became hydrophobic. Consequently, the thermal degradation of phosphor powders in air at 200 °C was greatly reduced and the stability of the fabricated LEDs with coated powders was also improved. Prospectively, the proposed approach provides a new strategy to improve the thermal stability of other phosphors.
Introduction
Nitride phosphors have shown great suitability as down-conversion luminescent materials in white light emitting diodes (wLEDs) because they exhibit abundant emission colours, significantly redshifted photoluminescence, high quantum efficiency, small thermal quenching and high reliability.1–6 By using red- and green-emitting nitride phosphors, wLEDs with a super-high colour rendering index (for general illumination) or super-wide-colour gamut (for backlighting) can be realized.7 Red phosphors play an indispensable role in increasing the colour rendering properties of wLEDs, which include Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ (SSN),8–11 CaAlSiN3:Eu2+,12,13 SrLiAl3N4:Eu2+,14 SrAlSi4N7:Eu2+,15,16etc. Among these red-emitting nitride phosphors, both SSN and CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ have been commercialized due to their high quantum efficiency and chemical stability. Compared to the deep-red CaAlSiN3:Eu2+, orange SSN promises to produce wLEDs with a higher luminous efficacy. However, SSN has a serious drawback of thermal degradation.17–21 Different from thermal quenching, thermal degradation is an irreversible deformation. The thermal degradation of SSN will definitely decrease the reliability and lifetime of wLEDs, which thus hinders its wide applications in solid state lighting. Therefore, reducing the thermal degradation of SSN is necessary and quite important for its practical application.
Yeh17 reported that the origin of thermal degradation of SSN was ascribed to the oxidation of Eu2+. Therefore, preventing the oxidation of Eu2+ is a key to reduce the thermal degradation of SSN. Several methods have been proposed to reach this goal. One is to form a solid solution between SSN and Ba2Si5N8:Eu2+. Xie et al.19 reported that the substitution of Sr by Ba (Sr2−xBax)Si5N8:Eu2+ reduced the thermal degradation, and the degradation was totally inhibited at x = 1.0. Another option is to introduce carbon into the lattice to form thermally robust carbidonitride phosphors (Sr2Si5CxN8−4/3x:Eu2+). Liu et al.22 demonstrated that the thermal degradation was reduced from 16 to 0.8% when the carbon content was x = 1.25. The third method is to coat a passive layer on the surface of SSN particles. Zhang et al.18,20 reported that SSN became hydrophilic after annealing in N2, and a passive surface layer of SrSiO3 was formed after heat treatment in a N2–H2 atmosphere, and thus the degradation of SSN was reduced. Alternatively, the coating layer can be produced on the phosphor particle surfaces by using techniques including sol–gel,23 emulsion,24 precipitation25 and chemical vapour deposition.26 Zhang et al.27 achieved a hydrophobic silica coating layer on the surface of the SSN phosphor, which provided good stability to the modified phosphor under high-pressure water steam conditions at 150 °C. However, it is hard to use all the above mentioned methods to prepare homogeneous and closed layers on phosphor particles (typically for the particles with irregular morphology and size). Furthermore, it is also difficult to precisely control the thickness of the coating layer. For SSN, it is not a good idea to adopt the aqueous method to create passive surface layers as it will be hydrolyzed.28 Therefore, it is essential to find alternative ways to form homogeneous and closed surface layers with controllable thickness for SSN.
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a gas phase deposition technique based on cyclic self-limiting reactions.29 By using ALD, one can control the film thickness of deposited materials down to atomic levels with high uniformity and conformity.30 This technology has been applied to deposit passivated layers in many areas for superiorly stable materials such as lithium batteries31,32 and solar cells.33,34 Meanwhile, the performance of these materials (e.g. ion conductivity and power conversion efficiency) can also be improved. Generally, ALD is usually employed to deposit thin, homogeneous films with controlled thickness on flat substrates. With the combination of a fluidized bed reactor, it can also be applied to micro- and nano-sized powders.35,36 Among various coating materials, alumina is widely used due to its unique affinity to a large variety of substrate materials.35 The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of ALD as a scalable approach for improving the degradation stability of the SSN phosphor. In our previous work, we successfully deposited an Al2O3 thin layer on YAG:Ce3+ phosphor particles through ALD in a fluidized bed reactor (FB-ALD) and improved its thermal stability significantly.37 In this work, a FB-ALD based gas phase deposition approach was utilized to deposit a thin Al2O3 layer on the surface of SSN powders. The processing parameters were investigated and optimized to prepare uniform thin films on phosphor particles, and the structure and composition of the thin films were analysed. Finally, the influence of the coating layer on the photoluminescence and thermal properties of the phosphor was discussed.
Experimental section
Starting materials
The Sr1.905Si5N8:0.095Eu2+ phosphor powders were obtained from Leuchtstoffwerk Breitungen GmbH (LWB). The particle size was ∼1 μm based on SEM images. The phosphor powders were dried at 150 °C under vacuum for 1 h to remove the water on their surface before coating at different temperatures and cycles, while they were not dried before coating using different oxidizers and reactant dosage. Trimethylaluminium (TMA, select semiconductor grade) was supplied by Akzo-Nobel HPMO (Amersfoort, The Netherlands) in a 600 mL WW-600 bubbler and used as the aluminium precursor. O3 or H2O was chosen as the oxidizer. Pressurized nitrogen gas (grade 5.0) was provided as the carrier gas to pump the reactants and purge the system.
Deposition process in a fluidized bed reactor
A schematic illustration of the FB-ALD set-up is shown in Fig. 1. For each experiment, 2 g of SSN phosphor powders was filled in a glass column which was placed on a single motor Paja PTL 40/40-24 vertical vibration table to assist the fluidization. An infrared lamp placed parallel to the column and a Type-K thermocouple inserted in the column were used to control the temperature. Generally, one ALD cycle can be divided into four steps. Firstly, nitrogen is pumped through the TMA bubbler filled with TMA and makes a gas stream to carry TMA into the reactor to react with the functional group on the sample surface. Secondly, N2 is introduced into the reactor to carry away the excess TMA. Thirdly, a N2 flow with O3 or H2O is delivered into the reactor to oxidize the methyl groups of TMA, and the Al2O3 films are formed. Finally, N2 is pumped into the reactor to carry away the excess oxidizer and gaseous by-products. The coating will be deposited layer by layer in a cyclic manner and the thickness of the coating can be precisely controlled by changing the number of cycles. Before starting the coating procedure, nitrogen is used to drive away the air in the system. During the coating process, the reactor is always kept at atmospheric pressure and the deposition temperature is in the range of 30–200 °C. The feeding sequence of TMA–N2–O3/H2O–N2 with a dosing time of 60′′–120′′–60′′–120′′ is established as the base-case condition.

Characterization
The phase composition was examined by X-ray diffractometry (Bruker D4 Endeavor, Germany) using Co Kα radiation with a scanning rate of 0.4 s per step and an interval of 0.02°. The morphology of the SSN particles and coating layer was observed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique using a JEOL JEM2100 (JEOL, Japan) operating at a voltage of 200 kV. A Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e thermogravimetric analyser (METTLER TOLEDO, Switzerland) was employed to study the thermal weight changes of phosphor powders in both nitrogen and dry air atmospheres. The TGA curves were recorded while (1) heating up the powders from 25 to 120 °C, (2) maintaining at 120 °C for 10 min, (3) ramping up to 1000 °C, and (4) finally maintaining at 1000 °C for 30 min. The thermogravimetric analyser equipped with a mass spectrometer STA449F3A-QMS403 (NETZSCH, Germany) was used to monitor the escaping gases during heating up. Chemical analysis with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer Optima 5300, USA) was performed to provide the mass fraction of aluminium in the coated sample. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy was performed on an infrared spectrometer (Spectrum II L1600300, PerkinElmer, USA). The contact angle was measured using a video-based contact angle measuring device (DSA25, Kruss, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+ spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) equipped with an Al Kα monochromated X-ray source. The quantum efficiency was measured on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instrument, UK) equipped with visible photomultiplier tube detectors (Hamamatsu R982P, Japan). The temperature-dependent photoluminescence was measured using a RISØ TL/OSL reader model DA-15 (RISO, Denmark). Samples were heated to desired temperatures at a heating rate of 10 °C s−1 with a holding time of 2 min at each point. Then the photoluminescence spectra under the excitation of 460 nm (using a xenon source) at varying temperatures were collected using a QE65000 detector (Ocean Optics, USA). The luminous flux and chromaticity coordinates were measured using an EVERFINE ATA-500 auto-temperatured LED opto-electronic analyser (EVERFINE Corporation, China).
Results and discussion
Coating formation
TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) observations were made to investigate the thickness and morphology of the Al2O3 coated SSN phosphors that were deposited at 30 °C (SSN@Al2O3@30 °C) with different oxidizers. As seen in Fig. 2, a clear coating layer on the phosphor surface can be successfully achieved by using H2O or O3 as the oxidizer. The coating layer using H2O as the oxidizer is quite non-conformal, as evident from variations of the film thickness in the range of ∼3 to 40 nm (Fig. 2(a–d)). This is because H2O is easily attached on the SSN particle surface, which leads to agglomeration and inhomogeneous growth of the Al2O3 layer. When using O3 as the oxidizer, the coating thickness is pretty uniform and has a very narrow distribution of 9 ± 2 nm for the sample coated at 30 °C and 3 ± 1 nm for the sample coated at 100 °C (Fig. 2(e–h)). In addition, it can be verified that the SSN substrate is well crystallized while the Al2O3 coating layer is amorphous, as seen in Fig. 2(e). Since the SSN particle is in the micro-size level but the coating layer is in the nano-size scale, an entire particle with a clear coating layer cannot be observed in one TEM image, while the average film thickness can be estimated from ICP-OES measurements (the detailed steps to calculate the film thickness are reported by Valdesueiro et al.36). Fig. 2(i) exhibits the calculated thickness of the alumina films from the ICP-OES data compared with that measured from the TEM images. It can be seen that, for the sample using H2O as the oxidizer, the film thickness varies in a large range, while the distribution of film thickness is quite narrow in particular when using O3 as the oxidizer, and the thickness from TEM images agrees well with the value obtained from ICP-OES. Consequently, all of our experiments were done with O3 as the oxidizer in the following work.

An essential characteristic of the ALD process is its saturation feature. It is expected that the amount of the deposited material depends on the exposure time, and will reach a maximum at a certain time. To investigate the film thickness as a function of the reactant exposure time, the saturation curve obtained under different conditions is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the film grows thicker with increasing TMA dosage time from 0 to 30 s (the O3 dosage time is also increased accordingly), which means that a longer exposure time of the reactants contributes to a thicker Al2O3 film grown on the phosphor surface. Meanwhile, the film thickness of the sample coated at 30 °C is higher than that of the sample coated at 100 °C. It can be ascribed to the insufficient removal of adsorbed water on the sample surface, which favours the faster growth of Al2O3 thin films under ambient conditions.38 The corresponding growth per cycle (GPC) data are also given. The samples deposited at 30 °C with different TMA dosages have a GPC in the range of 0.35–0.85 nm, and the GPC of samples deposited at 100 °C is in the range of 0.1–0.6 nm. Both almost reach saturation at a TMA dosage time of 60 s, and thus the thickness of the coating layer can be controlled precisely within ∼1 nm. Therefore, the long exposure time of 60′′–120′′–60′′–120′′ (i.e. a high GPC) is chosen as the base-case situation for subsequent experiments.

Since the deposition temperature will affect the layer growth conditions, the influence of deposition temperature on the morphology and film thickness of the coated samples was studied by TEM measurements. As seen clearly from the TEM images in Fig. 4(a), a uniform and conformal Al2O3 layer can be successfully deposited on the phosphor surface at different deposition temperatures. The layer thickness is 11 ± 2 nm to 5 ± 1 nm for 15 ALD cycles and the GPC is about 0.7 to 0.3 nm when the temperature varies from 30 to 200 °C. In other words, the film becomes thinner as the deposition temperature increases, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The reason for this is that the elevated deposition temperature enables the evaporation of the excess molecules of precursors adsorbed on the sample surface, which slows down the growth of the coating layer.39,40 Simultaneously, the elevated deposition temperature leads to the formation of a denser Al2O3 layer, which can have a better protective effect on the phosphor.41 Meanwhile, since the deposition of Al2O3 is affected by many factors, such as the working pressure, deposition temperature, and reactor-type, the obtained GPC in the present work is higher than the reported one for the ideal ALD of Al2O3 (generally in the range of 0.1–0.2 nm).29 However, the high value of GPC and the moderate reaction conditions in our case are, in fact, beneficial for the fast and scalable production required for practical applications. Accordingly, we refer to our procedure as an ALD-based gas phase deposition, but not an ideal ALD.

It is accepted that encapsulating phosphor particles by depositing a coating layer on the surface can prevent direct contact from environmental species, and therefore protect the phosphors against attacks from them.42 A thicker coating layer is expected to show a better resistance or smaller thermal degradation, but it may lead to the reduction of photoluminescence due to the scattering effect as a result of different refractive indices between Al2O3 and SSN. Consequently, an appropriate coating thickness is required. To realize it, the deposition of Al2O3 at 100 °C with different numbers of cycles was executed. As seen in Fig. 5(a), the thickness of the coating layer increases with increasing number of deposition cycles as expected. Moreover, the thickness of the coating layer increases linearly as the number of cycles increases from 5 to 50 cycles (Fig. 5b). In the first 5 cycles, the growth of the Al2O3 film is much faster. This phenomenon is in accordance with the intrinsic nature of the ALD process that the deposited material may grow quickly for the first several cycles because more reactive sites are present on the bare sample surface, i.e. substrate enhanced growth.43

To investigate the impact of the Al2O3 coating on the phase composition in the coated samples, the XRD patterns of the uncoated SSN and Al2O3 coated SSN were examined. As shown in Fig. 6, the diffraction peaks of samples coated at different temperatures are consistent with the standard card of Sr2Si5N8 (PDF No. 85 0101, XRD patterns of SSN@Al2O3@100 °C with different numbers of cycles are shown in Fig. S1, ESI†). No peak shifts or secondary phases are detected after the coating treatment, indicating that the deposition has no influence on the phase and structure of the phosphor. XRD peaks typical for the crystalline Al2O3 are not detected in all SSN@Al2O3 samples, which again confirms that the formed Al2O3 film is amorphous or too thin to be detected.44,45

DRIFT was performed to analyse the surface properties of the uncoated SSN and SSN@Al2O3 coated at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 7, obvious vibrations of Al–O containing groups at the wavenumbers of ∼692, 768 and 1343 cm−1 are detected for the coated samples, which confirms the successful deposition of Al2O3 on the SSN phosphor.46,47 The Al–O signal at the wavenumber of 1343 cm−1 intensifies when the deposition temperature decreases because the low deposition temperature contributes to the thicker growth of the Al2O3 layer with the same deposition cycle. Moreover, strong OH vibrations at ∼3430 and ∼1615 cm−1 are also found in the coated samples owing to the incomplete removal of the OH groups during the Al2O3 formation, and the OH vibrations become weaker with increasing deposition temperature.

Coating effect and thermal stability tests
The influence of the deposition conditions on the photoluminescence properties of the SSN phosphor was investigated, as shown in Fig. 8. All samples exhibit similar profiles of emission bands and no obvious peak shifts occur after coating, suggesting that the deposited Al2O3 film does not change the position and bandwidth of the emission spectra of the SSN phosphor (Fig. 8a and b). As seen in Fig. 8c and d, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the phosphor samples is dependent on the deposition temperature and the number of cycles, and generally decreases after coating. The absorption efficiency of the samples with different deposition temperatures and cycles is almost the same. The IQE is reduced by only 2% at the deposition temperature of 100 °C for 15 cycles, but shows a sudden drop (by 19%) at 150 °C. The dramatic decline may be due to the oxidation of phosphors by the highly reactive O3 reactant and the co-effect of the generated H2O during the coating process and damage of the interface between SSN and Al2O3. At 100 °C, the IQE decreases with the coating cycles, and it decreases by ∼11% after 30 cycles, which is attributable to the extended reaction time and thicker Al2O3 layers. Wang et al. reported that the oxidation and the surface damage of the SSN phosphor can even be observed at 100 °C.21 A thicker layer would block more emitted photons from the phosphor itself.

Thermal gravimetric analysis was employed to study the weight change of the samples both in air and N2. Fig. 9(a) shows TGA plots of the SSN powders without and with the Al2O3 layer deposited at different temperatures. The uncoated sample (red curve) does not lose weight, while the coated samples show an obvious weight loss. This is due to the desorption of water, hydroxyl groups and carbon groups that are incorporated in the Al2O3 layer, which can be evidenced from the TGA/MS results shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Moreover, the lower the deposition temperature, the more weight loss for the coated samples. The reason behind it is the incomplete consumption of OH groups and the gradual accumulation of O inserted into the Al–C bond derived from the TMA reactant in the growing Al2O3 layer at a low deposition temperature.48,49 This is in accordance with the DRIFT results. An apparent increase of weight at high temperatures in air but not in N2 observed for all samples suggests the drastic oxidation of the phosphor material, and SrSiO3 is formed after holding at 1000 °C for half an hour (see Fig. S3, ESI†).20 The temperature at which the sample starts to gain weight is improved from ∼700 °C to about ∼850 °C after coating, which demonstrates that the coating layer serves as a protective layer to prevent the phosphor from being attacked by the oxygen. In addition, as shown in Fig. 9(b), the sample coated at 100 °C with a thicker layer shows weight gain at a higher temperature, validating its stronger effect in blocking the phosphor from oxidation.50

It is also noteworthy that the coating does not just serve as a barrier on the phosphor surface to prevent the direct contact from external species, but it can also change the surface properties. As seen in Fig. 10(a), when immersed in water the particles of uncoated SSN and SSN@Al2O3 coated at 30 °C sink to the bottom of the container, whereas the particles of SSN@Al2O3 coated at 150 and 200 °C float on water. The sample coated at 100 °C shows an intermediate behaviour: some of the particles float on water and some of them are suspended in water or sink to the bottom of the container, and with increasing coating cycles, more particles float on water (see Fig. S4, ESI†). The contact angle of ∼110° and 125° (i.e., a poor wetting regime) for the SSN@Al2O3 samples coated at 150 and 200 °C indicates that the phosphor particles are hydrophobic (Fig. 10b). Meanwhile, it is impossible to measure the contact angles of uncoated SSN and SSN@Al2O3 coated at 30 °C and 100 °C with 15 cycles, because the water droplet permeates through the phosphor powder immediately. Since water will accelerate the thermal degradation of the SSN phosphor,18 the hydrophobic property of the coated samples will improve the water resistance and reduce the degradation of the SSN phosphor.
 Fig. 10  (a) Photographs of SSN and SSN@Al2O3 in water and (b) contact angles of water drops on the surface of SSN@Al2O3 at room temperature. The coated samples were prepared at different temperatures for 15 cycles. 
To understand the thermal stability of the uncoated and coated SSN, the temperature dependent photoluminescence intensity (thermal degradation test) was measured upon heating and cooling in air, as shown in Fig. 11(a and b). The phosphors were heated to 200 °C, kept for 2 h, and finally cooled to room temperature. As seen in Fig. 11(a), the uncoated SSN can recover 80% of the original luminescence intensity after a heating–cooling cycle, and the sample coated at 30 °C recovers about 79%. It also means the serious thermal degradation of these samples. When the deposition temperature increases, the thermal degradation of the coated samples decreases and it totally disappears for the samples coated at 150 and 200 °C. The enhanced thermal stability with increasing deposition temperature can be ascribed to the following reasons. (i) A higher deposition temperature results in less water incorporated in the Al2O3 layer, (ii) the hydrophobic surface restrains the water-assisted degradation, and (iii) a higher deposition temperature already causes degradation of the phosphor during coating. Simultaneously, it can also be seen from Fig. 11(b) that with increasing number of coating cycles (i.e., film thickness) at 100 °C, the thermal degradation can also be reduced and 95% of the luminescence is recovered. In addition to the thicker Al2O3 coating layer which can provide better protection of SSN against oxidation, the hydrophobic surface also has the role of protection. All of these results prove that coating an Al2O3 layer on the SSN phosphor surface through ALD-based gas phase deposition can protect the phosphor against thermal degradation and improve its thermal stability.

The SSN and SSN@Al2O3 powders with a commercially available 450 nm LED chip were packaged into LEDs that were aged under 0.04 A current for different periods. Photographs of the fabricated LEDs and the aging test are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It can be seen in Fig. 12(a) that the luminous flux of LEDs fabricated with SSN and SSN@Al2O3@100 °C with 15 cycles decreases with the aging time, and it remains stable after 1000 to 1500 h, while that of SSN@Al2O3@100 °C with a thicker coating (50 cycles) and SSN@Al2O3@200 °C does not decrease at all. These results indicate that the Al2O3 coating can improve the practical stability of LEDs as well. Fig. 12(b) shows that the chromaticity coordinates of all samples are almost unchanged with increasing aging time.

To sum up, based on the PL properties, the thermal degradation and the aging tests, it can be concluded that (i) the deposition temperature should be below 150 °C in order to avoid loss of emission after coating, (ii) the deposition temperature should be above 100 °C in order to prevent thermal degradation in air by reducing the amount of H2O incorporated in the Al2O3 layer and achieving a hydrophobic surface, and (iii) the number of coating cycles (thickness) also affects the emission intensity and the protective effect. Thus, by considering both the protective effect and luminescence properties, the optimum deposition temperature of Al2O3 is in the range of 100–150 °C, and the number of deposition cycles is in the range of 15–30 cycles at 100 °C.

To reveal the thermal degradation mechanism, the morphologies of the uncoated SSN and SSN@Al2O3@200 °C samples before and after the thermal degradation test (at 200 °C in air for 2 h) were observed. As seen in Fig. 13(a), the uncoated SSN particles were destroyed after thermal degradation, whereas the SSN@Al2O3 particles remained unchanged. With the aid of TEM techniques, one can see a thick amorphous layer on the surface of the uncoated SSN after heating, indicative of the oxidation of the host material. But there is no change of the surface of the coated sample, and the Al2O3 film remains unchanged in the layer thickness. These demonstrate that the coating film acts as a protection or passivation layer. XPS analyses were employed to study the state of Eu 3d before and after degradation. As shown in Fig. 13(c), the regions at ∼1130 eV and ∼1160 eV are attributed to Eu 3d5/2 and Eu 3d3/2.51 The peaks at 1125.6 eV and 1135.6 eV are assigned to Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions, respectively.52,53 As can be seen, the Eu 3d signal is not detected for the coated sample since XPS is a superficial technique that only gives information of several nanometers on the sample surface, and the coating layer has shielded the detection of Eu 3d. For the uncoated samples, the signal of Eu2+ is quite weak while the intensity of Eu3+ is much stronger suggesting that the sample surface has already been oxidized before the degradation test. No obvious change of Eu3+ and Eu2+ intensity is found after thermal degradation revealing that the oxidation of Eu2+ is limited, while it cannot be excluded completely. Therefore, it can be concluded that thermal degradation of the SSN phosphor in the present work is mainly caused by oxidation of the host material, which is in agreement with the thermal degradation mechanism proposed by Wang et al.,21 and the Al2O3 coating can prevent the oxidation of the SSN host. With these observations, the protection mechanism of SSN degradation by the Al2O3 thin layer is schematically shown in Fig. 13(d).

Conclusions
In this work, an Al2O3 coating layer was successfully deposited on SSN particles through the ALD-based gas phase deposition in a FB-ALD reactor under different process conditions. The coating parameters were optimized using different oxidizers, TMA dosage time, deposition temperature and number of cycles. A uniform and conformal coating layer was achieved when using O3 as the oxidizer, and the thickness of the coating layer decreased with increasing deposition temperature and increased with increasing number of cycles. The quantum efficiency decreased with increasing deposition temperature and number of cycles, while the SSN@Al2O3 surface became hydrophobic with increasing coating temperature and thickness. The optimum deposition temperature of Al2O3 was in the range of 100–150 °C, and the number of deposition cycles was in the range of 15–30 cycles at 100 °C. Under 200 °C in air for 2 h, the SSN phosphor was degraded mainly owing to the oxidation of the host lattice, while the coating layer can prevent the oxidation of the host lattice and thus the thermal degradation of the SSN@Al2O3 phosphor was greatly reduced. Moreover, the reliability of LEDs fabricated with the coated SSN powders was also improved. The reduced thermal degradation of the SSN phosphor by Al2O3 coating will benefit the practical application of this phosphor. The use of a fluidized bed reactor makes it applicable at an industrial scale.
