    , Accepted 28th March 2013First published on 2nd April 2013AbstractIn the quest to improve the performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a view to realizing economic viability, various solvent additives such as 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), diphenylether (DPE) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) are used in easily obtainable poly(2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-dyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl) (TQ1)-based systems with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor to optimize the active layer nanomorphology. Utilizing a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we find that the addition of 5% (v/v) CN leads to smoother films, less heterogeneous surface features, and well-distributed TQ1:PC71BM phases, resulting in more balanced charge transport in the devices and a highly efficient power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.08%. This is a record for quinoxaline-based PCSs and is also comparable with the hitherto reported highest efficiency of the PSCs in single junction devices. In addition, the PSCs using an inverted device structure show a satisfactory PCE of 5.83% with high stability to ambient exposure, maintaining over 80% of its initial PCE, even after storage in air for more than 1 month.

Broader context
Recently, a dramatic improvement in the efficiency of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has brought particular attention to their potential to become an economically viable source of cheap, renewable electrical energy. The superior solution processability and relatively inexpensive materials used in these devices allow for swift roll-to-roll large-scale production, affording PSCs the potential of being more cost-effective and flexible in applications than their more established inorganic counterparts. Today's best PSCs are made with active layers using a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ), where typically conjugated polymers are blended with fullerene derivatives so that the correct nanoscale phase-separated morphology is obtained to manage charge carrier generation and transport. With advances made on the efficiency front, for enhancing the confidence in the commercialization of PSCs, it is of critical importance to synthesize inexpensive polymers as well as to minimize the processing cost. In this work, we achieve a high efficiency of 7.08% in cost-effective quinoxaline (TQ1)-based PSCs through nanoscale morphology control induced by practical processing additives. Our findings offer a bright future for deeper understanding of the mechanism for improvement via morphological engineering as well as a roadmap for selecting appropriate solvent additives for use in similar BHJ PSCs.

Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on conjugated donor polymers and acceptor fullerenes are promising devices for alternative energy sources because of their potential applications in flexible, light-weight, and low-cost large-area devices through roll-to-roll printing.1–6 Primarily, thanks to the development of new low bandgap donor polymers7–10 and better control of the nanoscale morphology of the interpenetrating electron donor–acceptor networks,11–19 great progress has been made in this field, and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed PSCs have reached 7–8%.20 In principle, to push the PCEs of PSCs towards the theoretical limit,21 achieving both a high short-circuit current (JSC) and a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) is critical, and is indeed essential. This has been succeeded by using low bandgap polymers with deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels22,23 such as PSiFDTBT,24 PFDTBT,25 and PCDTBT.26,27 On the other hand, many largely empirical strategies have been applied to achieve the aforementioned nanoscale morphology, including postproduction annealing,28,29 solvent annealing,30,31 and the introduction of processing additives or mixed solvents.16,32 Alongside higher PCEs, for enhancing the confidence in the commercialization of PSCs, it is of critical importance to synthesize inexpensive polymers as well as to minimize the processing cost.
In this regard, we focus our attention on an easily synthesized poly(2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-dyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl) (TQ1) that simultaneously possesses a deep HOMO (∼−5.5 eV) and low bandgap (∼1.7 eV)33 as required by the proposed ‘ideal polymers’26,34 as well as the processing additives capable of modifying the BHJ organization in that they do not require additional fabrication steps. Despite the initial high PCE of up to 6.0% in a typical BHJ device from TQ1 and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)33 as well as another study reporting comparative tests on TQ1:PC71BM using mixed solvents,35 no attempt has been made to create the optimal blend nanomorphology by using such techniques listed above for more efficient PCE operation.
In this contribution, we have comprehensively studied the effect of various solvent additives (1,8-octanedithiol (ODT), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), diphenylether (DPE) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)) on the BHJ PSCs based on TQ1:PC71BM. Upon adding 5% (v/v) CN to the BHJ active layer, a PCE as high as 7.08% with a JSC of 12 mA cm−2 and VOC of 0.91 V is achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest value among quinoxaline-based PCSs reported to date. The techniques of X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been applied to study the influence of CN on the nanomorphology and crystallinity of the TQ1:PC71BM blend. Besides, since long-term stability is another primary area of concern for commercial PSCs, the potential utilization of TQ1:PC71BM in inverted PSCs with ZnO and MoO3 as electron-selective and hole-selective layers is explored, resulting in a high PCE of up to 5.83%. The inverted device using an Au electrode retains over 80% of its original conversion efficiency after 30 days while the conventional one shows negligible photovoltaic activity within 7 days. From a manufacturing perspective, our studies boast a promising pathway for constructing low-cost PSCs with high efficiency as well as long-term stability.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a–c present the molecular structures of TQ1, PC71BM, and solvent additives used in this study together with the energy level diagrams of the component materials. TQ1 was synthesized by a Stille coupling according to literature reports,33,36,37 which show a relatively high number average molecular weight (Mn) of 48 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 3.6, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). On the basis of the photophysical and electrochemical studies (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†), as the reduction potentials of TQ1 are out of our scan range, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (−3.8 eV) is calculated from the HOMO energy level (−5.5 eV) and the optical bandgap (1.7 eV).33

Upon utilizing a model trimeric system containing methoxy groups instead of octyloxyl chains for simplicity, the optimized molecular geometry of TQ1 and its molecular orbitals of the calculated HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces were computed by density functional theory (DFT, B3LYP/6-31G) (Fig. 1d).
Interestingly, the molecular orbital distributions reveal that both the HOMO and LUMO are well spread over the whole conjugated backbone, implying a ‘strong donor–weak acceptor’ system of TQ1. This is in contrast to many other donor–acceptor polymers in which the LUMO is localized upon the electron accepting core of the polymer backbone. The localization can hinder interchain electron transport, since hopping requires good alignment of the localized LUMO levels.38,39 Good coplanarity exists between the comonomers as well (see the top view in Fig. 1d).
Photovoltaic effects of TQ1 were investigated in BHJ PSCs with the device structures of the standard configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TQ1:PC71BM/Al. The optimized fabrication process of PSCs by casting TQ1:PC71BM in a 1:3 (w/w) ratio from o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) was reported in previous work,33 and was therefore used to make the PSCs under the same conditions, firstly (see the Experimental section for the detailed information). The representative current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices under the illumination of simulated AM 1.5G conditions (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 2 (see ESI for all other J–V data†) and the parameters are summarized in Table 1. Under this condition, only a modest PCE of 3.94% with a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 8.03 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.54 is obtained. Next, the effects of 2% (v/v) of various solvent additives (1,8-octanedithiol (ODT), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), diphenylether (DPE) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)) on TQ1 and PC71BM (1:3 (w/w)) were investigated. Interestingly, among the devices containing solvent additives, we find adding CN into the o-DCB solution of TQ1:PC71BM prior to spin coating, the PCE dramatically increased up to 4.94%. The performance of BHJ PSCs could be determined by the morphology of the active thin layer.40 With large interfacial area and bicontinuous interpenetrating networks, small phase domains enable maximum charge separation from the donor polymer to the acceptor fullerene derivative and enhance the collection of charge carriers from the active layer to each electrode. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were examined to elucidate the effect of additives on the phase separation of thin films of TQ1:PC71BM.41 The morphology of the films shows that the films with ODT, DIO, and DPE are very rough while the film with CN has small phase domains as shown in Fig. 3, where the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of each film are 6.08, 1.62, 1.10, and 0.75 nm, respectively. Regardless of a complete mechanistic understanding at this stage, it is evident that CN plays an important role in controlling the optimal morphology and creating a better interpenetrating network in TQ1:PC71BM through the decreased donor and acceptor domain sizes. This is reasonably advocated by the fact that the efficiently induced uniform film morphology with CN displays relative to those with other additives. Therefore, in the course of the planned nanomorphology study, not only do we further investigate the influence of CN on the film morphology and device performance but also seek to understand the mechanism for improvement and thereby identify guidelines for selecting appropriate solvent additives for use in similar BHJ PSCs. We find that the device performance can be further improved by changing the weight ratios of TQ1:PC71BM as well as different volume fractions of CN. Through the full optimization of the device architecture process, the best device, prepared using 5% (v/v) CN additive with a weight ratio of 1:2, reaches an overall PCE of 7.08%, with VOC = 0.91 V, JSC = 12.2 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.64, which is the highest PCE reported to date for PSCs fabricated from polymers containing a quinoxaline unit. This work highlights the great potential of the low-cost polymer to realize high-performance PSCs by taking advantage of the practical processing step as an additional driving force to further optimize the active layer nanomorphology. The integrated incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for these devices matches the measured short-circuit current to within 1% error (Fig. 2b).

The JSC and FF values are primarily determined by the charge carrier mobilities and the blend morphology when the absorbing materials and film thicknesses are kept constant.42,43 Therefore, the mobility and morphology of the BHJ blends with and without CN were investigated to probe the possible origin of the efficiently increased PCE as a function of CN addition. Both the electron and hole mobilities were measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method,44,45 as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2. In the case of the blend films without CN, the hole mobilities (μh) are generally an order of magnitude lower than the electron mobilities (μe). Notably, the μh for the films containing CN drops slightly, and meanwhile the μe is improved, leading to a smaller value between the mobility ratio. This supports the beneficial effect of the CN addition on TQ1:PC71BM. We attribute the large increase in JSC and FF, at least partially, to the well-balanced charge transport in the optimized blends (TQ1:PC71BM of 1:2 (w/w)) processed with 5% (v/v) CN.46,47

To gain a relatively complete picture of film morphologies in the TQ1:PC71BM blends upon the addition of CN, a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), AFM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was utilized. The AFM height images presented in Fig. 5a–d show large features with an RMS of 1.51 nm when no additive is applied, while significantly reduced feature sizes are observed upon the addition of CN. This suggests that the majority of CN additive by far leads to rougher surfaces. Note that the surface films made of TQ1:PC71BM (1:2 (w/w)) with 5% (v/v) of CN show the absence of the large domains and the finest features with an RMS of 0.47 nm. Thereby, CN is believed to allow much more improved miscibility between TQ1:PC71BM and formation of interpenetrating networks. Based on the current understanding of PSCs, the improved morphology can explain the enhanced photocurrents (7.42 vs. 12.2 mA cm−2) and FF (0.59 vs. 0.64) of the optimized TQ1:PC71BM of the 1:2 (w/w) blend processed with CN, when compared to the devices without CN. The effect of CN is further visualized by TEM (Fig. 5e–h). Large scale phase separation with a continuous darker phase embedded with discrete micrometer-size light domains (∼100 to 200 nm in diameter) is seen in the films processed without CN additive. In the films, processed with CN, large fullerene domains are absent, indeed, creating elongated nanofibrous networks through the promotion of the demixing of TQ1 and PC71BM, in qualitative agreement with the above AFM results.48

(e–f) The TEM images corresponding to the AFM images. 
To clearly quantify the structural heterogeneity and the dynamics of ordering of TQ1 with PC71BM being forced into the intercrystalline, we monitored the out-of-plane XRD of the films annealed at 120 °C corresponding to the images of Fig. 6. Distinct primary diffraction (100) features in pure TQ1 films are detected at 2θ = 3.84°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 23.0 Å, indicating that TQ1 is preferentially oriented with its (100) plane perpendicular to the substrates. However, diffractions originating from either second-order peaks or π-stacking planes cannot be observed. These above XRD results suggest the signature of the ordered lamellar packing motif with a presumably edge-on orientation for the pristine TQ1 films.49,50
 Fig. 6  XRD patterns of TQ1 and TQ1:PC71BM blend films without or with different concentrations of CN. 
When PC71BM is mixed with TQ1 processed with and without CN, the d-spacing peaks are somewhat shifted, which results in a ∼1.6 Å shift to a larger d-spacing for TQ1:PC71BM blend with 5% (v/v) CN. Such an expansion of the lattice is most likely attributed to the intercalation of the PC71BM between the side-chains of the TQ1.51 Interestingly, the new diffraction emerges at 2θ = ∼9.5° (∼9 Å) in the blends, which probably arises from the intercalated TQ1:PC71BM lamellar structure.52 Another possible explanation for this is that the PC71BM molecules can diffuse through the polymer matrix and form large single crystals.53–55 Notably, we observe the broad featureless peaks (010) caused by the characteristics of the π–π interchain stacking in the profiles of blended samples, which is probably due to the occurrence of intercalation between the polymer side chains and fullerene.51,52,56,57 In addition, this implies that the polymer chains in the blends of TQ1:PC71BM have either a slight preference in the face-on orientation or a co-existence of the face-on and other tiled chain orientations.58 Besides, the (010) peaks of the blend films with the 5% (v/v) of CN shift from 18.38° (π-stacking distance of 4.82 Å) to 18.65° (π-stacking distance of 4.75 Å). The reduction of the interlayer spacing in the blend films cast from the solvent with additive could be helpful for charge transportation in the corresponding device.59
Compared with conventional PSCs, inverted-type devices demonstrate better long-term ambient stability by avoiding the need for the corrosive and hygroscopic hole-transporting PEDOT:PSS and low-work-function metal cathode, both of which are detrimental to the device lifetime.60–62 Therefore, the highly satisfactory PCE of over 7% for TQ1:PC71BM BHJ conventional devices prompts us to take an initial look at PSCs with using an inverted structure, which may boast the practical applications in future low-cost mass production. The present inverted PSCs architecture (ITO/ZnO/TQ1:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag) employed in this study is shown in Fig. 7a (see the Experimental section for the detailed fabrication). To mimic BHJ cell fabrication conditions, the optimized active layer components (TQ1:PC71BM of 1:2 (w/w)) processed with 5% (v/v) CN were chosen for the inverted BHJ PSCs. A PCE of up to 5.83% is observed for the inverted PSCs with a VOC of 0.82 V, a JSC of 11.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.62. Note that the measured JSC is in a good agreement with IPCE measurements (Fig. 7b). The preliminary results are comparable with those of the high-performance inverted PSCs.63–67 However, the PCE of current inverted PSCs based on TQ1:PC71BM is inferior to that of the best conventional PSCs above, due to the reduced JSC and VOC. This implies that the empirically optimized fabrication for the conventional architectures is quite different from that of the inverted cells since PSCs with an inverted device structure are sensitive to the electrical properties of the interfaces between the buffer layer and the photoactive layer. A systematic experimental study of the influences of morphology and thickness of buffer layers on the photovoltaic properties of inverted PSCs will recover the existing JSC and VOC losses, which will be setup as our next task.

On the other hand, by replacing the MoO3/Ag with a MoO3/Au electrode, other inverted PSCs were fabricated, which would produce more environmentally stable devices due to the inert electrodes.64 Although the PCE of Au devices is 0.48% smaller than that of Ag devices (see Fig. S2†), which is typically attributed to the decreased reflectivity in the visible region of Au,68 the PSC shows high stability in air, retaining more than 83% of its initial efficiency over 30 days of ambient exposure (Fig. 8a). In contrast, under the same conditions, the devices with the conventional structure fall to over 85% (from 7.08% to 1.06%) within only 1 day and completely lose their efficiency within 7 days of ambient exposure (see Fig. 8b).

Conclusions
As a final note, we have demonstrated high-performance PSCs based on the structure of an easily synthesized low bandgap polymer, TQ1, where solvent additives, such as ODT, DIO, DPE, and CN play a critical role in enhancing their PCEs. A PCE of higher than 7% that doubles to that of the devices processed without the solvent additives has been realized by means of engineering active layer nanomorphology upon the addition of 5% (v/v) CN. This is the highest efficiency reported for quinoxaline-based polymers and also comparable with the record best cell efficiencies for the PSCs in single junction devices. By using a systematic experimental study in combination with XRD, AFM, and TEM, we find that the addition of CN promotes small scale phase separation, less heterogeneous surface features through the improved miscibility of the TQ1 and PC71BM, resulting in well-intercalated polymer–fullerene networks. In addition, without full optimal morphology control and process optimization, not only do the corresponding inverted PSCs show a still satisfactory PCE of 5.83% but also the inverted devices with an Au electrode retain over 83% of the original efficiency after 30 days. From an easy and practical perspective, our findings offer a bright future for the commercialization of PSCs, although guidelines for selecting an appropriate solvent additive remain relatively unclear in various material systems.
Experimental section
Materials and characterizations
Unless stated otherwise, all reagents were purchased either from Aldrich or Acros and used without further purification. THF was distilled over sodium/benzophenone. 1H NMR spectra were acquired using a VNMRS 600 (Varian, USA) NMR spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal reference with deuterated chloroform as the solvent. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) was performed on Agilent technologies 1200 series (UV detector at 500 nm). THF and PS were used respectively as the eluent and standard for GPC analysis. UV-Vis absorption was measured with a Cary 5000 UV/Vis-NIR spectrometer (Varian USA). Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out on a Solartron electrochemical station (METEK, Versa STAT3) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon. A three-electrode setup was used with platinum wire both as a counter and working electrode and Ag/AgCl used as a reference electrode to be calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple as an external standard, whose oxidation potential was set at −4.8 eV with respect to zero vacuum level. A 0.1 M solution of n-tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) in degassed anhydrous acetonitrile was used as the supporting electrolyte. The polymer thin film was deposited on the PT working electrode.
Synthesis of TQ1
The monomer intermediates were prepared according to the literature procedure.33,36,37 The target polymer TQ1 was synthesized by a Stille coupling using 5,8-dibromo-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (250 mg, 0.36 mmole) and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (147 mg, 0.36 mmole) as monomers. For the synthesis of TQ1, 4.3 mg (1.3 mol%) of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) and 7.16 mg of tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-Tol)3) were used as the catalyst and ligand under argon atmosphere at 100 °C for three days. After the reaction, the crude polymer which precipitated in methanol–ammonia water solution (700 ml:100 ml) was collected by filtration through a 0.5 μm Teflon membrane filter. The collected polymer was dried in a vacuum drying oven for 12 hours, and then was sequentially Soxhlet-extracted with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was poured into aqueous EDTA solution and then stirred for 12 hours followed by extraction with demineralized water twice. After phase separation, the concentrated chloroform fraction was precipitated in methanol. Finally, the purified polymer was collected by filtration through a 0.5 μm Teflon membrane filter and dried in a vacuum drying oven for 24 hours (190 mg, 85.6%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.83 (br, 2H), 7.35 (br, 2H), 7.21–7.10 (br, 6H), 6.85 (br, 2H), 3.70 (br, 4H), 1.55 (br, 4H), 1.17 (br, 20H), 0.80 (br, 6H). Mn = 48 kg mol−1, Mw = 173 kg mol−1, PDI = 3.6.
Fabrication of photovoltaic cells
PSC devices were fabricated according to the following procedure: first, the ITO coated glass substrate was cleaned with detergent, then it was sequentially ultrasonicated in distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and then dried overnight in an oven at 100 °C. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron PH) was spin-cast at 5000 rpm for 40 s. The substrate was dried at 140 °C in air for 10 min. Subsequently, it was moved into a glove box for spin-coating the active layer. A mixed solution of TQ1:PC71BM in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with various additives (1,8-octanedithiol (ODT), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), diphenylether (DPE) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)) was spin coated at 1400 rpm for 60 s on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer to obtain a BHJ film. These samples were brought into a vacuum system (about 10−7 Torr), and an Al electrode (100 nm) was deposited on the top of the BHJ layer. In the case of inverted structure cells, ZnO is applied as the electron transport layer. The ZnO layer was deposited on ITO coated glass by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 40 s and dried at 120 °C in air for 15 min. The active layer was coated with the same method explained above. Then, a thin layer of MoO3 film (∼5 nm) was evaporated on the top of the active layer. Finally, the anode (Ag or Au, ∼95 nm) was deposited on the active layer in a vacuum (about 10−7 Torr) thermal evaporator. Measurements were carried out with the solar cells in the glove-box by using a high quality optical fiber to guide the light from the solar simulator equipped with a Keithley 2635 A source. The solar cell devices were illuminated at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. For accurate information, the IPCE measurements were carried out with a QEX7. The device structures of the hole and electron only devices are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TQ1:PC71BM/Au and FTO/TQ1:PC71BM/Al, respectively. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mobilities were estimated by the Mott–Gurney square law JSCLC = 9(εrε0μ)/8(V2/L3), where εr is the dielectric constant of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, L is the distance between the cathode and anode, which is equivalent to the film thickness, and V is the applied voltage. In order to optimize the performance as well as to probe the reproducibility and trend of the devices in our study, we not only fabricated more than 500 devices but also carried out the experiments in a strictly controlled surrounding and used high grade reagents.

Broader context
Recently, a dramatic improvement in the efficiency of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has brought particular attention to their potential to become an economically viable source of cheap, renewable electrical energy. The superior solution processability and relatively inexpensive materials used in these devices allow for swift roll-to-roll large-scale production, affording PSCs the potential of being more cost-effective and flexible in applications than their more established inorganic counterparts. Today's best PSCs are made with active layers using a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ), where typically conjugated polymers are blended with fullerene derivatives so that the correct nanoscale phase-separated morphology is obtained to manage charge carrier generation and transport. With advances made on the efficiency front, for enhancing the confidence in the commercialization of PSCs, it is of critical importance to synthesize inexpensive polymers as well as to minimize the processing cost. In this work, we achieve a high efficiency of 7.08% in cost-effective quinoxaline (TQ1)-based PSCs through nanoscale morphology control induced by practical processing additives. Our findings offer a bright future for deeper understanding of the mechanism for improvement via morphological engineering as well as a roadmap for selecting appropriate solvent additives for use in similar BHJ PSCs.
