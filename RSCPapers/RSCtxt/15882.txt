    , Accepted 23rd August 2022First published on 7th September 2022AbstractPhotothermal catalysis is a promising strategy for converting CO2 into high value-added chemical feedstocks. Its current major challenges lie in improving CO2 conversion efficiency and product selectivity. In this work, a series of Cu/TiO2 core–shell catalysts were prepared using the hard template method. The Cu10/TiO2 catalyst exhibited excellent performance for the photothermal conversion of CO2 to CO in the presence of H2 under Xe lamp irradiation (CO2 conversion, 30.6%; CO selectivity, ∼100%; CO maximum yield, 87.1 mmol h−1 gcat−1). Results indicated that the Cu/TiO2 catalyst has a good photo-to-thermal conversion ability based on the significant LSPR effect, and the existence of hot electrons makes the reaction follow the carbonate pathway efficiently. This article successfully achieves efficient CO2 reduction under inexpensive and non-toxic conditions. In addition, it also provides unique insights into the study of the LSPR effect in the field of photothermal catalysis.
1 Introduction
The greenhouse gas effect, mainly caused by excessive CO2 emissions, leads to a series of associated problems such as melting glaciers and food shortage.1–3 In recent years, many studies have been carried out on the capture, storage and transformation of CO2, but the research results could not meet the economic benefits required for their long-term development.4,5 Transforming CO2 into high value-added chemicals, such as CH3OH and C2+ hydrocarbons, has become the best choice for its commercial application.6–8,62 However, these reactions usually require a high energy input, which will lead to a large amount of CO2 emissions. It is urgent to seek a CO2 conversion path under the condition of low energy consumption. Photothermal catalysis has attracted the wide attention of researchers due to the use of clean solar energy as the main energy input.2,9,10 CO2 + H2 ⇌ CO + H2O ΔH0298 = +41.2 kJ mol−1(1) CO2 + 4H2 ⇌ CH4 + 2H2O ΔH0298 = −169 kJ mol−1(2)
The main C1 products of the photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction are CO and CH4, corresponding to the RWGS (eqn (1)) and Sabatier reactions (eqn (2)), respectively. Although CH4 can be used as fuel, its reforming reaction requires more energy input, thus reducing its overall economic benefits.11 In contrast, CO can be used as both a Fischer–Tropsch synthesis reaction feed gas and reducing agent in metal smelting, which has a substantial value-added space.3,12 It is well known that RWGS is an endothermic reaction and Sabatier is an exothermic reaction. This means that relying on traditional thermal catalysis to achieve high CO2 conversion and CO yield requires harsh reaction conditions (high temperature (about 1000 K) and high pressure13,14). Photothermal catalytic systems are considered to be one of the most promising ways to achieve solar fuels under mild conditions.2,9,15,16 Many transition metal nanoparticles such as Fe,17 Co,7,18 Ni,19,20 and Cu21–23 have been reported to have RWGS photothermal catalytic activity, but still face the problem of low product selectivity with the main by-product being CH4.
To improve the production selectivity and CO2 conversion rate, many efforts have been made. Among them, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) enhanced photothermal catalysis technology has aroused widespread research interest.10,24 Free electrons in plasmonic metal nanoparticles oscillate collectively by exciting LSPR under light irradiation.25 The LSPR effect converts light energy into heat energy and generates hot carriers, thus achieving or even surpassing the traditional thermal catalytic effect without an external heat source. Precious metals (Ag,26 Au,27 Pd,28 Ru,29etc.) have been proved to have a good LSPR effect, but the high price limits their commercial applications. In contrast, Cu is considered to be an ideal photothermal catalyst because of its similar LSPR effect to noble metals and lower cost. However, it remains important to note that Cu nanoparticles are easily oxidized and sintered at high temperatures, leading to the loss of catalytic activity.
Semiconductors for CO2 reduction have been reported in the literature. However, the bandgap of a semiconductor limits its utilization of solar light to a certain range.6,7,61,62 It is necessary to modify the semiconductor to improve the utilization of solar energy. Yang et al. obtained black TiO2 by S doping, and the Ti3+ sites and high S doping level were considered as the reason for extending the light absorption range.30 Wang et al. prepared TiO2@TiO2−xHx catalysts by the hydrogen plasma method.31 Due to the introduction of defects, the band gap of TiO2 becomes narrower, making the material's absorption range wider, thus improving the utilization of solar energy. Many articles focused on engineering the defects and band structure of the semiconductor, ignoring the influence of the special catalyst morphology on light absorption performance. Recently, Yang et al. prepared SiO2@TiO2 core–shell catalysts and showed that the total reflection of light between SiO2 and TiO2 significantly improved the light absorption capacity and photo-to-thermal conversion of the material.32 Cao et al. prepared black N–TiO2−x hollow spheres through the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) process. A large specific surface area, narrow bandgap, and enhanced light absorption properties were considered to be the main factors for enhanced activity.33
Herein, a unique Cu/TiO2 core–shell structure catalyst was designed. On one hand, the LSPR effect produced a great thermal effect and generated hot carriers enhancing the reaction. On the other hand, the large specific surface area of the core–shell structure provided more active sites, and the light absorption performance of the material was improved by multiple reflections and the coupling of Cu and supporter. Overall, the catalyst achieved excellent catalytic performance under photothermal conditions. (CO2 conversion, 30.6%; CO selectivity, ∼100%; CO maximum yield, 87.1 mmol gcat−1 h−1).

Copper(II) nitrate trihydrate (CuNO3·3H2O), and TEOS were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (Mw = 55000) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Acetonitrile was purchased from Kermel Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China. Anhydrous ethyl alcohol (purity = 99.9%) was purchased from Energy Chemical.

2.2 Synthesis of catalysts

2.2.1 Shell structure Cux/TiO2 synthesis (x = 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 wt%). 


SiO2@Cux/TiO2@SiO2 synthesis. 
SiO2@TiO2 was prepared by the hard template method.34 The prepared SiO2@TiO2 was re-dispersed in 40 mL of deionized water, and different amounts of CuNO3·3H2O were then added and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 3 hours. SiO2@TiO2 were collected by centrifugation and redistributed in 40 mL deionized water with an appropriate amount of metal precursor, then 0.8 g PVP was added and stirred overnight.


SiO2@Cux/TiO2@SiO2 synthesis. 
The above products were collected by centrifugation and re-dispersed in a mixed solution of 46 mL absolute ethanol and 8.6 mL deionized water. The ultrasonic treatment lasted for more than 10 min to ensure the good dispersion of the solute. Then 1.2 mL of ammonia and 1.6 mL of TEOS were added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for at least 4 hours. After centrifugal collection, the product was dried in a vacuum dryer at 60 °C, then mechanically ground, placed in a muffle furnace, and calcined at 700 °C for 2 hours (heating rate: 10 °C min−1).


Etching process. 
Cu/TiO2 was finally obtained by etching the above product with NaOH (70 mL, 0.5 M) for 6 h at 90 °C. The above products were dried and ground for the in situ photoreduction process.
TiO2 bulk was synthesized by the above process without any metal precursors.

2.3 
          In situ photoreduction process
Cu/TiO2 was reduced by the following process: after vacuuming the reaction pool, 48 kPa hydrogen was introduced into the batch reactor, and then 50 mg prepared samples (see 2.2.1) were exposed to light illumination for a certain time. Then the Xe lamp was turned off and the reaction pool was allowed to cool to room temperature. The obtained catalysts were used for characterization. Unless otherwise stated, all catalysts were obtained after photoreduction for 15 min.
2.4 Characterization
XRD patterns were collected on a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation source, Bruker, Germany). Morphology information was collected by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Apreo S LoVac, FEI). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were carried out on a field-emission transmission electron microscope (JEM-F200, JEOL, Japan). The UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured on a spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Japan) from 220 to 1000 nm and converted to the absorption spectra using the Kubelka–Munk method. XPS was performed on an Escalab 250Xi (Thermo SCIENTIFIC, America). All binding energies were corrected with C 1s peaks of contaminant carbon at 284.8 eV. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry was performed on a Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform instrument, using conventional IR cells connected to gas manipulation apparatus. The measurement was carried out in a reactor containing the Cu10/TiO2 catalyst flowed with CO2/H2 = 1:1 (10 mL min−1) under light irradiation. EPR spectra were recorded on a JES-FA 200 (JEOL, Japan) spectrometer with a microwave power of 1.0 mW and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz.
2.5 Evaluation of photothermal catalytic activity
The CO2 hydrogenation experiments were carried out in a closed intermittent reactor with a total volume of 330 mL; 50 mg of photoreduced catalyst was well dispersed on a permeable quartz fiber pad and then placed in the reactor.
After evacuating the reaction cell, H2 and CO2 gases were injected with a 1:1 ratio until the pressure reached 56 kPa. The light source was a 300 W Xe lamp with an average light intensity of 2.4 W cm−2. During the reaction, the temperature of the sample surface was monitored in situ using a thermometer pre-calibrated with a reflection coefficient of 0.70.
The gaseous sample (0.5 mL) was taken at a fixed interval from the reaction vessel and analyzed on a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) for CO and CH4, and a methanizer for the analysis of CO2.

3 Results
3.1 Material composition and morphological analysis
The composition of the material was analyzed by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1a, the diffraction peaks at 25.3, 37.8, 48.0, 53.9 and 55.0° correspond to the (101), (004), (200), (105), and (211) planes, respectively, which was consistent with the characteristic peaks of anatase (JCPDS no. 86-1157). In addition, CuO was also found in the material (JCPDS no. 78-0428). Although Cu loading reached 10 wt%, the diffraction peaks of other copper species could not be well distinguished, which might be attributed to the high dispersion on the surface of TiO2. Similar phenomena could also be found in other Cu/TiO2 samples (see Fig. S1, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Representative XRD pattern of the Cu/TiO2 samples after photoreduction (Cu10/TiO2). 
The morphological characteristic was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2a, Cu/TiO2 hollow spheres with uniform distribution and a diameter of about 230 nm were successfully prepared using the hard template method. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2b) shows the distance of the lattice spacing to be 0.35, 0.30, and 0.21 nm, which could be assigned to TiO2(101), Cu2O(110), and Cu(111), respectively. Fig. 3c–f show the elemental distribution of Ti, O, and Cu. No element aggregation was observed, which meant that Cu species were highly dispersed and tightly bound to TiO2 nanoparticles. As a supplement to XRD, these results again proved the existence of Cu(I) and Cu(II) species on the surface of TiO2.

To further investigate the elemental chemical state of the material, XPS was used to characterize the samples before and after photoreduction. As shown in Fig. 3a, before photoreduction, the peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 are located at 934.44 and 954.28 eV, with satellite peaks appearing at 938–945 eV, which is a typical signal of Cu(II).21,35,36 Compared with the sample without photoreduction, two new peaks appeared at 931.7 and 932.2 eV, which correspond to the Cu(0) and Cu(I) species, respectively.36 Besides, the intensity of the peak at 934.0 eV and its strong Cu(II) satellite peak weakened significantly. Thus, photoreduction reduced a large amount of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and Cu(0) species, which was in good agreement with previous results. The chemical state of Ti was unchanged before and after photoreduction (Fig. 3b). Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 spin orbitals are located at 458.10 and 463.81 eV, respectively, and were attributed to the typical Ti4+.35,37 Although Ti3+ is known to significantly enhance photocatalytic activity, no Ti3+ signal was detected in this study (Fig. S13†). This implies that the catalytic mechanisms of photothermal and photocatalytic systems are significantly different.
3.2 BET analysis
The adsorption ability of the material plays an important role in the catalytic performance, and thus the adsorption and desorption isotherms of nitrogen were measured. As shown in Fig. 4a, the isotherms of all hollow spheres exhibited type IV (BDDT classification) and obvious H3 hysteresis loops, which were characteristic of mesoporous materials with narrow slit-like or plate-like particles.38 This demonstrated that the shell structure of TiO2 was composed of small TiO2 particles (∼5 nm), which was similar to that in the literature.39 In the low-pressure range (P/P0 < 0.47), the adsorption branches hardly increased; meanwhile, in the high-pressure region (0.47 < P/P0 < 1), the adsorption branches increased rapidly. This indicated that the adsorption process was dominated by mesopores.
 Fig. 4  (a) Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms and (b) pore size distribution of different photoreduced Cux/TiO2 (x = 0, 7, 10, 12, and 15 wt%) samples. 
The pore size distribution curve of the Cu/TiO2 hollow shells was further determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The mesopore size of all the samples was mainly about 4 nm, as shown in Fig. 4b, and there was almost no other pore size distribution. Noting that the Cu/TiO2 material was mainly composed of a stack of TiO2 microspheres, the mesopores were very likely the gap between TiO2 microspheres. Table 1 summarizes the BET information of the different samples. It is not difficult to see that there is no obvious dependence between the pore sizes and loading amount, meaning that the coupling process of TiO2 and Cu species is not accompanied by the collapse of the supporter structure, which is consistent with the XRD and TEM results. Obviously, during the impregnation process, Cu ions were uniformly distributed in the mesoporous structure of the carrier due to the wetting and diffusion effect of the liquid, and the binding effect of the developed mesoporous structure can effectively inhibit the aggregation of Cu species during the high temperature calcination and reduction.

3.3 Catalytic activities of photothermal CO2 reduction
To examine the light absorption properties of the materials, the UV-vis-NIR spectra were measured in the range of 220–1000 nm (Fig. 5a). It can be seen that all the Cu/TiO2 samples exhibited strong light absorption over a wide wavelength range from UV to NIR, except for the TiO2 bulk which only absorbed UV light. The combination of Cu species with TiO2 led to enhanced light absorption, which was the key to improving solar energy utilization. Three distinct areas of absorption appeared in the diagram. The light absorption range of 220–400 nm corresponds to the intrinsic absorption of TiO2. A small peak appeared in the range of 400–500 nm, which was the overlapping absorption region between the intraband transitions and interband transitions of the Cu NPs.40 In addition, the enhanced absorption peaks of the samples with high loading were observed in the range of 600–1000 nm, which were attributed to the LSPR resonance absorption caused by Cu nanoparticles. In general, a redshift of the LSPR absorption peak can be observed with increasing copper particle size.41 Interestingly, the absorbance of Cu10/TiO2 was similar or even weakened in comparison to that of Cu7/TiO2 in some areas, which might be related to the coverage of cuprous species. A similar phenomenon was also reported in the previous literature.40

To investigate the light-to-heat conversion capabilities of the materials, an infrared thermometer was used to measure the reaction temperature in real time. As shown in Fig. 5b, under illumination, the TiO2 bulk showed the lowest photothermal temperature (about 128 °C after one hour). The temperature of photothermal conversion rose together with the rise in material load. The highest temperature (about 350 °C) was observed on the 10–15 wt% samples. It is well known that the RWGS reaction is a typical endothermic reaction in thermodynamics. Thus, a relatively higher photothermal temperature may facilitate the reaction in the positive direction.

Fig. 6a shows the CO2 photothermal reduction performance of Cux/TiO2 (x = 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 wt%). The results showed that the yield of CO increases with the increase of Cu loading. When the Cu loading reached 10 wt%, the yield of CO was the highest (25.10 mmol g−1 h−1). When the Cu species continued to increase, the CO yield decreased, which might be related to the active site coverage on the catalyst surface. This can be confirmed by BET analysis (Table 1). Fig. 6b shows the changes in the CO yield and selectivity with time. It can be seen that the maximum reaction rate (87.1 mmol g−1 h−1) was achieved within 10 min under light conditions, and the reaction reached equilibrium after 40 min. Finally, the CO2 conversion rate of Cu10/TiO2 reached 30.6%, and the CO selectivity reached 99.9%. In addition, we also investigated the six-cycle performance of the catalyst, as shown in Fig. 6c. The reaction showed a slight performance degradation after the first cycle, but still maintained a high CO yield of 21.11 mmol g−1 h−1. Although the performance declined slightly in the last few cycles, it was still higher than the values reported in many references.17,42–44

All data are obtained after one hour of reaction. 
To investigate the source of activity, a series of comparative experiments were carried out. Adding a water filter between the Xe lamp and the reactor can significantly reduce the intensity of the incident light from 2.4 W cm−2 to 0.6 W cm−2. The surface temperature of the catalyst decreased significantly (from 334 to 81.3 °C). At this point, the catalytic reaction can be regarded as a simple photocatalytic process. As shown in Fig. 6d, the activity of the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was much lower than that under photothermal conditions (1.74 mmol g−1 h−1), indicating that the photothermal effect was the key to improving the activity of the reaction. Y44 filters can cut off UV light below 440 nm (Fig. S14†). When Y44 was added, the catalytic activity was slightly lower than that under direct illumination (CO yield = 21.26 mmol g−1 h−1). Combined with Fig. 5a, it was not difficult to infer that the influencing factors of the reaction activity were mainly dominated by the LSPR effect. In addition, we also tested the catalyst activity without light. The reaction temperature was kept at 340 °C with a flexible electric heater to simulate the average temperature reached on the catalyst surface under illumination. The performance of the dark reaction was significantly lower than in the other two cases (0.095 mmol g−1 h−1). As reported in many studies, Cu-based catalysts need high temperature or pressure to achieve the desired CO yield and CO2 conversion in thermal catalysis.43,45,46 The above results indicate that the photothermal effect is the main source of catalytic activity. To further verify the source of activity, we also performed the reaction of the Cu10/TiO2 samples in a mixed atmosphere of 10% H2/Ar at 450 °C for two hours. The test results showed the CO yield of 23.06 mmol g−1 h−1. Instead, TiO2 bulk and sintered Cu showed very low CO evolution performance (Fig. 6f). Apparently, highly dispersed Cu is the main active site of this reaction. In fact, Cu has been generally reported to be the active site of RWGS.47–49 It is worth noting that Cu catalysts under photothermal conditions can achieve high conversion and CO yield at low temperature (334 °C), which undoubtedly shows the great advantages of photothermal catalysis.
In addition, we found a strong linear relationship between the reaction rate and illumination intensity (Fig. 7a). For plasmonic photocatalysis, the dependence of light intensity I and the photocatalytic rate falls into four categories: sublinear (Rate ∝ In, n < 1), linear (Rate ∝ I), superlinear (Rate ∝ In, n > 1), and exponential (Rate ∝ ef(I)).50 In general, the exponential relationship between the photon-induced chemical conversion rate and the illumination intensity (Rate ∝ ef(I)) provides evidence that the reaction is driven by a thermal process,51 while the linear dependence of the plasmonic photocatalytic rate on light intensity (Rate ∝ I) is usually related to electron-driven processes.52 To further verify the carrier effect, we adopted the sacrificial agent experiment. As shown in Fig. 7b, the activity was almost lost after adding any sacrificial agent, which means that electrons and holes played a leading role in the reaction. It was easy to conclude that the hot electrons produced by the LSPR effect were the primary source of reaction activity given the prior experimental results, which showed that the contribution of photogenerated electrons to the activity was negligible. Meanwhile, the activity on the non-semiconductor (Cu10/Al2O3) catalysts (a similar specific surface area and photothermal temperature to Cu10/TiO2) is much lower than that on the semiconductor catalysts (Cu10/TiO2), suggesting that photogenerated carriers play an auxiliary role in the photothermal catalysis process (Fig. 6d, Table S1, Fig. S15–17†).

3.4 Proposed reaction mechanism
The key species of the RWGS reaction were detected by in situ infrared spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 8, the intermediates appeared with the reaction: monodentate carbonate (m-CO32−, 1519 and 1457 cm−1),19,53,54 bicarbonate (HCO3−, 1650 and 1540 cm−1),54–56 CO2− (1681 cm−1),27 and chelating bridging carbonate (c-CO32−, 1704 cm−1).17 The bands detected at 1558 cm−1 and 1509 cm−1 could be assigned to the asymmetric vibration of the formate OCO group57 and CO stretching,58,59 respectively. The peak intensity of the bicarbonate grew obviously as the reaction progressed, indicating that the reaction mechanism follows the bicarbonate pathway. This conclusion is consistent with many studies.12,57,60

Based on the above discussion, a possible reaction mechanism is proposed. As shown in Scheme 1, the unique shell structure has a huge specific surface area as well as highly dispersed active sites, which enable efficient catalysis. When the catalyst was exposed to light, the hot electrons generated by the LSPR effect were injected into the antibonding orbital of CO2, resulting in transient negative ion (TNI) adsorbates.50 The dissociated H combines with the TNIs to form the key intermediate species of RWGS (HCO2− and HCO3−), and the intermediate species dissociate to obtain CO and H2O according to the bicarbonate pathway.

4 Conclusion
Photothermal catalysis is a promising strategy for converting carbon dioxide into high value-added chemical feedstocks, and its current major challenges lie in improving carbon dioxide conversion efficiency and product selectivity. In this work, we used inexpensive Cu as LSPR-responsive nanounits and successfully synthesized Cu/TiO2 catalysts with a large specific surface area and high dispersion of Cu active sites by a template method. The research results show that the Cu/TiO2 catalyst has a good photothermal conversion ability based on the significant LSPR effect, and the existence of hot electrons makes the reaction follow the carbonate pathway efficiently. Finally, excellent catalytic performance was achieved (CO2 conversion, 30.6%; CO selectivity, ∼100%; CO maximum yield, 87.1 mmol gcat−1 h−1). This study successfully achieves efficient CO2 reduction under inexpensive and non-toxic conditions. In addition, it also provides unique insights into the study of the LSPR effect in the field of photothermal catalysis.
