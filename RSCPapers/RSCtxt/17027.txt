    , Accepted 11th March 2020First published on 11th March 2020AbstractSmall-molecular iridium complex based organic solar cells (OSCs) show inferior power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to those of pure organic/polymer analogues. To further improve the performance of such OSCs, we reported a bilayer device structure, which was fabricated by sequentially spin-coating a p-type polymer semiconductor (poly[4,4′-bis(2-butyloctoxycarbonyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5-diyl)-alt-(2,2′bithiophene-5,5′diyl)]) (PDCBT) layer and a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layer with the cyclometalated Ir complex (TBzIr) as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor. Compared to the original TBzIr:PC71BM BHJ device, the bilayer PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM structure exhibited an identical high open circuit voltage of 0.92 V, and increased both short circuit current from 9.25 to 11.14 mA cm−2 and fill factor from 0.46 to 0.61. The p-type PDCBT layer was inserted to afford increased light absorption, assist the upper BHJ blends to form optimized morphologies, and provide supplementary donor–acceptor interfaces to facilitate exciton dissociation. Therefore, the PCE could be significantly improved from 3.91% for TBzIr:PC71BM to 6.17% for PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency ever reported for small-molecular Ir complex based organic solar cells.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn great attention in the past few decades because of their advantages of low cost, mechanical flexibility, light weight and large-area fabrication.1–7 With the development of novel photoactive materials,8–13 especially the benefits from the recent achievements in fused-ring small-molecular acceptors (FREAs), the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been continuously increasing to landmark values beyond 17%.14–16
In most widely reported BHJ OSCs, the active layer normally contains electron donor and acceptor materials. Apart from polymer donors, which are employed widely in high-efficiency OSCs, small-molecular donors demonstrated unique advantages of well-defined chemical structures, easy purification and excellent photovoltaic performance reproducibility without batch-to-batch variation.17–20
To date, a vast majority of small-molecular donors were mainly constructed by a pure organic D–A type backbone with electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units. On the other hand, organometallic compounds such as cyclometalated heavy metal Ir complexes are another new class of promising photoactive donor materials due to their increased metal-to-ligand-charge transfer (MLCT) absorption, long triplet lifetime for more efficient exciton dissociation and specific octahedral molecular configuration to form the desired film morphology.21–23 For example, in our previous work, a small-molecular cyclometalated Ir complex named as TBzIr was designed as donor material in solution-processed BHJ devices with a PC71BM electron acceptor. A PCE of 3.81% vs. ∼0% was achieved for octahedral TBzIr and the corresponding pure organic TBz ligand, respectively, under the same device conditions.21 However, the PCE of OSCs with small-molecular heavy metal complexes still lags far behind that of pure organic D–A materials. In this case, further improving the photovoltaic performance of organometallic complexes is of significant importance. However, most of the research has been based on developing new metal complexes, and improving PCE through device structure optimization has been rarely reported.21–26
Therefore, in this work, we designed a bilayer device structure, by sequentially spin-coating a p-type polymer PDCBT and a binary BHJ layer. The small-molecular organometallic Ir complex of TBzIr and fullerene acceptor of PC71BM were selected as the electron donor and acceptor materials for the BHJ layer, respectively. A similar device optimization strategy with an active layer of PTB7-Th:PC71BM/IDIC and cross-linked-PBDTTT-Br25/PBDTTT-Br25:PCBM was previously reported to increase the PCE of polymer solar cells.27,28
The specific PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM structure of the as-optimized device was demonstrated in Fig. 1a. As the polymer PDCBT shows a relatively poor solubility in chlorobenzene (CB) but dissolves sufficiently in chloroform (CF) under ambient temperature, the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer could be successfully accomplished by judiciously employing orthogonal solvents. A dramatical enhancement in photovoltaic performance was achieved from the devices based on the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM structure with a maximum PCE of 6.17%, which is almost twice that of the original TBzIr:PC71BM BHJ device (3.91%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE ever reported for small-molecular Ir complex-based OSCs. Furthermore, in order to illustrate the rationality and credibility of the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM device structure, both planar-heterojunction OSCs consisting of a PDCBT/PC71BM bilayer and BHJ ternary OSCs with three components of PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM were fabricated for comparison. Relatively lower PCE of less than 4.80% was achieved for both contrasting devices, confirming the successful device optimization approach by the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM ternary bilayer structure. Further characterization indicated that better exciton dissociation, higher hole transporting ability, proper morphology and optimized vertical distribution in the active layer were obtained from the OSCs based on the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer structure than on TBzIr:PC71BM. The device optimization approach demonstrated in this work is expected to increase the PCE of Ir complex based OSCs to a higher level compared to the mainstream single layer BHJ devices.

Results and discussion
Energy level and absorption properties
The chemical structures of the materials used in this work are shown in Fig. 1b. TBzIr was synthesized according to our previous report.21 PDCBT and PC71BM were purchased commercially and used without further purification. The energy level diagrams of these materials are shown in Fig. 2a. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals/highest occupied molecular orbitals (LUMO/HOMO) were located at −3.00/−5.31 eV for PDCBT,29 −3.33/−5.42 eV for TBzIr and −3.98/−5.96 eV for PC71BM, respectively. The relatively large offset between the HOMO energy level of TBzIr and the LUMO energy level of PC71BM guaranteed a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) for TBzIr:PC71BM containing devices. Furthermore, the LUMO offsets of PDCBT:PC71BM and TBzIr:PC71BM were significantly larger than 0.3 eV, which might provide a sufficient driving force to facilitate efficient exciton dissociation.30

(c) UV-vis absorption coefficient spectra of the corresponding TBzIr:PC71BM BHJ films spin-coated from CB solution with thickness of 90 nm, PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer films sequentially spin-coated from CF/CB solution with thickness of 39/90 nm and PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM ternary blend films spin-coated from CB:CF mixed solvents with thickness of 95 nm. 
To illustrate the different solubilities of PDCBT in chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB) solutions, we characterized the absorption profiles of both a neat PDCBT film (spin-coated with the CF solution) and a CB-treated PDCBT film (the same CF-coated neat film and then spin-coated by the pure CB solvent). As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the absorption intensity of the CB treated PDCBT film was just slightly lower than that of the neat PDCBT films in the range of 400–620 nm. In addition, two similar peaks emerged at the same position of 556 and 598 nm for both films, indicating that the entire profile of the optical absorption did not collapse in the CB-treated PDCBT film, which further proves the poor solubility of PDCBT in CB.27 In this case, we chose CF to dissolve PDCBT, and CB as the processing solvent for the TBzIr:PC71BM active layer to perform a sequential spin-coating process for the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM ternary bilayer structure. The absorption spectra of neat films of PDCBT (spin-coated with the CF solution), TBzIr (from CB) and PC71BM (from CB) are parallelly listed in Fig. 2b. The absorption of TBzIr ranged from 350 to 600 nm with two absorption peaks at 470 nm for the ligand centred π–π* and 540 nm for MLCT absorption. Meanwhile, the neat PDCBT film exhibited an obviously red-shifted profile from 400 to 700 nm compared with TBzIr. Fig. 2c shows the UV-vis absorption coefficient spectra of TBzIr:PC71BM (BHJ), PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM (ternary bilayer) and PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM (ternary blends) films which were prepared exactly the same as in the photovoltaic devices, as will be illustrated below. The absorption for the TBzIr:PC71BM BHJ structure located in the range of 350–700 nm was dominated by the absorption feature of the TBzIr donor.21 After adding a PDCBT layer, the absorption intensity for the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer structure increased abundantly in the range of 440–660 nm, especially with two obvious peaks at 554 and 601 nm, which was attributed to the extra absorption of PDCBT. Simultaneously, such a higher enhancement was also observed in PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM ternary blends, whereas with obviously lower absorption coefficients than the corresponding ternary bilayer films in the wide range of 470–640 nm. Notably, the absorption coefficient of the film with the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer structure was reduced compared to the TBzIr:PC71BM and PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM ternary blends in the short wavelength region below 440 nm. The inserted PDCBT layer occupied a portion of the thickness (∼39 nm in the optimized condition), while PDCBT exhibited nearly no absorbance of <440 nm, where TBzIr and PC71BM displayed a significantly strong absorption. Hence, the absorption intensity per unit thickness of PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer films in the short wavelength range was apparently lower than those of the BHJ and ternary blends. Benefited from the adequately enhanced absorption intensity in the range 440–660 nm, OSCs based on the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer structure are expected to attain a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) compared to the BHJ and ternary blended OSCs.
Photovoltaic properties
The BHJ devices with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/TBzIr:PC71BM/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al were firstly fabricated, where ITO and Al served as the anode and cathode, respectively, and PEDOT:PSS and PDINO were used as the hole transport layer (HTL) and the cathode interfacial layer (CIL), respectively. The fabrication processes were consistent with the work previously reported.21 The PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer devices were prepared with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM/PDINO/Al. PDCBT was spin-coated with the CF solution firstly, and the upper BHJ layer was fabricated under the same conditions as those for the fabrication of comparative BHJ devices with CB as the processing solvent. The film thickness of PDCBT was optimized at 39 nm in a large range of 23–101 nm (Table S1, ESI†). The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the devices under an illumination of 1 sun (simulated AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2) are demonstrated in Fig. 3a and the details of the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown, a modest PCE of 3.91% was obtained from BHJ devices, with a Voc of 0.92 V, Jsc of 9.25 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.46, which were comparable to the values of 3.81%, 0.92 V, 8.91 mA cm−2 and 0.47 reported in our previous results,21 further suggesting the reproducibility without batch-to-batch variations of small molecular organic photovoltaic materials.

In PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer OSCs, we adjusted the film thicknesses of the PDCBT-modifying layer by simultaneously changing the concentration of the CF solution and the speed of the spin-coating process. As listed in Table S1, ESI,† the photovoltaic performance was strongly related to the PDCBT thickness. From 23 to 39 nm, the PCE of the corresponding structured devices gradually enhanced. The best PCE of 6.17% was achieved when the thickness of the PDCBT was 39 nm, exhibiting an overall enhancement in photovoltaic parameters with Voc, Jsc and FF valued at 0.92 V, 11.14 mA cm−2 and 0.61, respectively. Further enhancing the thickness of PDCBT to 48–101 nm resulted in a continuously degenerating photovoltaic performance. To the best of our knowledge, 6.17% is the best PCE value reported to date for OSCs based on small-molecular Ir complexes as photoactive materials. Compared with the BHJ devices, the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer devices exhibited nearly 1-fold increased PCE due to the simultaneous increase of Jsc and FF. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that, the energy level offset between the HOMO of PDCBT and LUMO of PC71BM was smaller than that of TBzIr:PC71BM. Thus the introduction of PDCBT was supposed to down-shift the Voc of relative OSCs. However, the PCE of PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer devices increased without any compromise in Voc, which illustrates the unique advantage of this structure. Fig. 3b showed the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of two different structured OSCs. In contrast with the single layer BHJ devices, devices with the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer structure exhibited an obvious enhancement in photoresponse in a broad range of 440 to 650 nm, which perfectly corresponded to the absorption spectrum of PDCBT, indicating that the p-modified layer contributed synchronously to the photocurrent.
To further prove the rationality of the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer OSCs, we fabricated two more types of devices for comparison. Firstly, a planar-heterojunction OSC consisting of bilayers of PDCBT and PC71BM was fabricated. The thickness of PDCBT was chosen to be 39 nm, the same as in PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM. As shown in Table 1, a PCE of 4.79% was obtained with a Voc of 0.77 V, Jsc of 9.76 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.66. The significantly lower PCE of PDCBT/PC71BM binary bilayer OSCs when compared with those of the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM devices was ascribed to the decrease of Voc and Jsc. In addition, we also fabricated single layer ternary blended control OSCs based on PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM in the BHJ structure to further verify the advantages of isolated PDCBT in PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM devices. The weight ratios of TBzIr:PC71BM in ternary blends were controlled as 1:1, while the PDCBT content was optimized gradually with a fixed total concentration of active layer solution. The photovoltaic parameters for different composition ratios of ternary BHJ devices are summarized in Table S2, ESI.† PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM solar cells with weight ratios of 0.4:1:1 exhibited a champion PCE of 4.62%, with a Voc of 0.89 V, Jsc of 10.05 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.51, respectively. The photovoltaic performance of ternary OSCs undoubtedly improved compared to that of the binary blends of TBzIr:PC71BM due to the increase of light harvesting ability attributed to the introduction of PDCBT as the third component, consistent with the enhanced Jsc. However, the PCE of the ternary PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM blended device was still lower than the value of PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer device, which revealed that besides offering an enhanced optical light absorbance, the PDCBT layer might simultaneously afford other benefits to enhance both Jsc and FF. Moreover, on account of down-shifted HOMO energy levels of PDCBT compared to TBzIr, the ternary OSCs exhibited a lower Voc of 0.89 V compared to 0.92 V of binary control and optimized bilayer devices. Above all, inserting a PCDBT modifying layer to form the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer devices enhanced both Jsc and FF but without sacrificing Voc, thus achieving the best photovoltaic performance among all the four types of OSCs.
Exciton dissociation and charge properties
The generation and dissociation of excitons were regarded as the crucial elements to the photovoltaic performance in OSCs. In order to gain deep insight into the effects of additional PDCBT layer on exciton generation and dissociation in correlated OSCs, a combination of characterizations was carried out. Firstly, the exciton dissociation probability P(E,T) was measured from the curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage, as displayed in Fig. 4a. In detail, Jph is defined as the difference between JL and JD, where JL and JD refer to the current density measured under one standard sun illumination and in the dark condition, respectively. Veff could be calculated by the formula Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and V represents the applied voltage.31–33 As depicted, the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM based devices exhibited higher Jph values at low Veff, implying that better charge collection property was achieved compared to single TBzIr:PC71BM BHJ control.34 Furthermore, the exciton dissociation probabilities for each structured device were evaluated by using the formula P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat, where Jsat stands for the saturation photocurrent density. Compared to single BHJ OSCs with a P(E,T) of 58.2%, such ternary bilayer devices demonstrated a higher exciton dissociation probability of 72.9%, indicating that sufficient exciton separation was achieved by employing a PDCBT modifying layer. The optimized exciton dissociation might be ascribed to the enlarged donor/acceptor contact between PC71BM at the bottom surface of BHJ and PDCBT. Besides, photoluminescence (PL) quenching characterizations were carried out to further illustrate the benefits of modifying the PDCBT layer and achieve a better understanding in exciton dissociation and charge generation in devices with the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer structure. PL spectra of PDCBT and the related ternary bilayer as well as single layer ternary blended films were measured. We selected the excitation wavelength at 600 nm according to the absorption spectra of PDCBT and TBzIr (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 4b, PDCBT displayed a broad PL spectrum of 590 to 800 nm, with a peak at around 640 nm. And the PL intensities of PDCBT significantly quenched in both PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM and PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM blends, indicating that the charge transfer from PDCBT to TBzIr:PC71BM was efficient in both structures. More specifically, films with the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer structure demonstrated a lower PL intensity with a higher quenching efficiency of 95.87%, compared to 93.45% of the ternary blends, suggesting a more effective exciton dissociation and charge transfer in the corresponding device. Meanwhile, the higher PL quenching efficiency of PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM blends further verified the enhanced exciton dissociation from the underlying PDCBT layer and PC71BM, consistent with the results of Jph − Veff. Moreover, combined with the results from the EQE spectra, the improved photoresponse of the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer OSCs in the absorption region of PDCBT also revealed that the isolated PC71BM at the bottom of the TBzIr:PC71BM active layer was assuredly involved in the exciton dissociation and charge transfer process with the underlying PDCBT layer, which is also in good agreement with the enhanced Jsc of the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM devices. In addition, the charge recombination in different structured devices was detected by assessing the dependence of Jsc on the light intensity. The formula Jsc ∝ (Plight)α was used to represent the relationship between Jsc and light intensity (Plight), where the exponential α stands for the degree of bimolecular recombination. Generally, the bimolecular recombination in OSCs is considered to be negligible when the α value is close to 1.35–37 As shown in Fig. 4c, Jph was linearly correlated to Plight with a high α of 0.99 in both the structured devices, indicating that the bimolecular recombination rarely occurred. Therefore, the better exciton dissociation was concluded as the main reason for the improvement of Jsc and FF in PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer devices.

Electron and hole mobilities
Characterizations for illustrating the charge transport abilities were carried out to detect the effect of the p-type modifying layer PDCBT involved. Based on space charge limited current (SCLC) method, hole- and electron-only devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al were successively fabricated for the measurement of hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities, respectively.38,39 The J–V curves fitted by the SCLC method for the corresponding devices are depicted in Fig. 4d, and the relevant mobility values are listed in Table 1. As shown, inserting a p-type modifying layer enhanced the μh of the relevant devices to 1.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to the original TBzIr:PC71BM BHJ devices with a lower value of 9.56 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. It should be noted that, in contrast to the widely reported polymer or pure organic small molecular donors, the asymmetric octahedral small molecular Ir complex as donor materials commonly suffer from unsatisfactory μh due to the undesirable molecular configuration for charge transport.21,40 The results in this work with the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer structure provided an effective approach to improve the hole mobility in the heteroleptic Ir complex. On the other hand, a μe value of 3.47 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained from such bilayer devices, which is less than the 1.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 of the BHJ control. Besides on the insertion of a pure p-type PDCBT layer, the lower μe of the devices was possibly attributed to the altered morphology of the upper TBzIr:PC71BM active layer. The crystalline structure formed by the PDCBT layer might have acted as a “nanogrooved substrate”,41 which would induce the noncrystalline PC71BM in the active upper layer to form an insufficient pure acceptor domain which relatively restrains electron transport, as will be discussed below.
Film morphology
The surface morphology of different blends was characterized through atomic force microscopy (AFM). The p-type modifying layer PDCBT was firstly detected. As shown in Fig. 5a, CF coated neat PDCBT layer exhibited a smooth surface with a small root-mean-square (RMS) value of 0.978 nm. Meanwhile, minor changes were discovered after CB treatment. The smooth surface and the weak crystallinity of the CB-treated PDCBT film with a relatively small RMS of 1.532 nm ensured competent contact between the PDCBT layer and the BHJ layer, which might be beneficial to afford supplementary pathways for charge separation and transfer.41,42

In the meantime, morphologies of the TBzIr:PC71BM and PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM blends were further investigated. As shown in Fig. 5c and g, due to the amorphous aggregation behavior of both TBzIr and PC71BM, the BHJ blends of TBzIr:PC71BM exhibited an inconspicuous D/A separation or aggregation phase with a low RMS roughness valued at only 0.461 nm. It has been reported that properly aggregated fullerene phases usually contributed to the enhanced D/A separation in fullerene-based blends, which might further induce increased exciton dissociation and higher charge mobilities.43–47 As could be found in Fig. 5d and h, when adding PDCBT as the modifying layer, the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM films exhibited aggregation behavior to a certain extent, which could also be synchronously confirmed by the higher RMS roughness value of 1.090 nm. The improved phase separation in PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer devices might be beneficial in achieving sufficient exciton dissociation.48–51 In this case, the PDCBT not only maintained its original structure but also guided the upper BHJ to form a preferable morphology, which was expected to further contributed to the enhanced photovoltaic performance.
Vertical distribution characterization
To gain a deep insight into the distribution of different materials in the vertical direction for different device structures, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out. By evaluating the composition ratios of characteristic atoms in the corresponding photoactive materials, the information on vertical distribution could be obtained. For polymer PDCBT, one repeating unit in the polymer chain contains 4 S atoms and 4 O atoms, and hence the S/O ratio for a p-type PDCBT modified layer is 1:1. Meanwhile, a single TBzIr molecule consists of 1 Ir atom, 8 S atoms and 2 O atoms. As for electron acceptor PC71BM, one molecular exclusively contains 2 O atoms for investigating XPS results scanned from the bottom surface of the BHJ and bilayer devices are shown in Fig. 6. As shown, there was no signal for Ir 4f (≈61 eV) in the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer, indicating that no TBzIr was dissolved into the PDCBT basal layer. In the meantime, the S/O ratio of the bottom surface of the bilayer was exactly equal to 1:1. The results illustrated that the bottom surface of the bilayer structure was merely comprised of intact PDCBT, and no contacts existed between TBzIr or PC71BM with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer. On the other hand, the composition of TBzIr:PC71BM at the bottom of the BHJ active layer was detected. PC71BM content at the bottom surface of BHJ can be calculated with the ratio of (O–2Ir)/O, where O and Ir stand for the proportion of corresponding atoms among the scanning depth. As can be found, in the BHJ structure, a mass of PC71BM was isolated at the bottom surface with a high content of 81.8%. The undesired distribution in TBzIr:PC71BM BHJ was unfavorable for the formation of sufficient interpenetrating networks and D/A surface, leading to undesirable exciton dissociation and charge transportation. In contrast, when a p-type modifying PDCBT layer was added between BHJ and PEDOT:PSS, the distribution was optimized since PDCBT could act as another donor material to construct an additional D/A interface with the isolated PC71BM underneath. In this case, enhanced exciton dissociation and supplemental pathways for carrier transport could be achieved, which would be in favor of enhancing Jsc and FF.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM bilayer device structure via sequentially spin-coating a p-type PDCBT polymer layer and a BHJ layer. By virtue of its bilayer structure, the organometallic small-molecular TBzIr donor-based device demonstrated a substantially increased photovoltaic performance. In the device with the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM active layer, a satisfactory PCE of 6.17% was obtained compared to 3.91% of the original TBzIr:PC71BM BHJ device,and was also superior to 4.79% of the PDCBT/PC71BM binary bilayer and 4.62% of the single PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM ternary blended. To the best of our knowledge, 6.17% is the record-high efficiency for small molecular heavy metal complex based OSCs. In contrast to PDCBT:TBzIr:PC71BM ternary blends, PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM based OSCs exhibited enhanced Jsc and FF without sacrificing Voc. From a combined characterization of optoelectronic and morphological properties, it could be found that the PDCBT layer not only provided complementary absorption contributing to photocurrent improvement, but also fine-tuned the aggregation behavior and phase separation in the active layer blends. More specifically, from the vertical distribution of the PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM active layer, PDCBT synchronously acted as another donor material to produce supplementary D/A contact between the isolated PC71BM at the bottom of the BHJ layer. Thus, enhanced exciton dissociation and complementary carrier transport pathways were achieved to afford enhanced Jsc and FF. Our results provide an effective strategy to improve the PCE compared to that of the conventional BHJ devices, and also revealed promising prospects for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of small-molecular Ir complex-based OSCs.
