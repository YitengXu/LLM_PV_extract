    , Accepted 6th December 2018First published on 10th December 2018AbstractHigh-performance photodetectors based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite single crystals and films have attracted extensive attention recently. In this study, a self-powered behavior was observed in a perovskite photodetector with a special asymmetrical metal/silicon dioxide/perovskite (MOS) structure that lacks the hole and electron transport layers. This self-powered behavior originates from the as-formed built-in electric field within the perovskite film due to the light-induced self-poling effect. The photogenerated carriers are well separated and drift in response to the built-in electric field, resulting in a large photocurrent reaching the nA level without an applied bias. Silicon dioxide acted as a barrier for the carriers, resulting in an ultralow dark current equal to the noise current. This self-powered MOS photodetector exhibited an ION/IOFF ratio of 105 and fast rise and fall characteristics (<30 ms). Our results suggest that exploiting the light-induced self-poling effect in perovskite films offers an alternative for developing reliable self-powered MOS photodetectors.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials are popular in the photovoltaic field due to their superior characteristics, such as a long carrier diffusion length, high absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime, and low-cost solution processing.1–7 At present, the highest efficiency of perovskite solar cell has exceeded 23%.8 Moreover, with the rapid development of perovskites, a series of photodetectors based on perovskite single crystals and films with high performance attributed to their outstanding optoelectronic properties have been reported in recent years.9–14 However, in spite of significant research efforts, many finer details characterizing perovskite device physics remain unclear. Of particular interest is the understanding of the ion migration. As proved by many experimental evidences,15–17 the ion migration is speculated to be the origin of or an important contributing factor to many of the unusual phenomena observed with perovskite materials and devices, such as current–voltage hysteresis,18 the switchable photovoltaic effect,19,20 large dielectric constants,21 and the light-induced self-poling effect.22 Investigations focused on fully utilizing these peculiar material properties and device functions have also been described.16,23,24 In addition, a more insightful understanding of the ion migration behavior in perovskite materials is crucial for further improving the device performance of solar cells and photodetectors.25–27
It has been reported that the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite materials exhibit a large switchable photovoltaic effect.19 When an external electric field was applied, the field switchable photovoltaic effect occurred due to the formation of a reversible n-i-p or p-i-n structure induced by ion drift behavior in the perovskite layer.28,29 These mobile ions accumulate at both the perovskite/electron transport layer and perovskite/hole transport layer interfaces, which provide an additional internal electric field. Furthermore, the light illumination contributes to the switchable photovoltaic effect, resulting in a “light-induced self-poling” effect.22 Apart from its suitable application in planar perovskite solar cells, the light-induced self-poling effect can also be applied to planar photodetectors, accounting for the built-in electrical field. However, the functioning of this effect in the hole/electron transport layer-free photodetectors have never been explored.
In this study, a photodetector with a metal/silicon dioxide/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (MOS) structure was fabricated, and self-powered behavior was observed in such an MOS structure without the conventional hole and electron transport layers. We found that the self-powered behavior originates from the as-formed built-in electric field within the perovskite film due to the light-induced self-poling effect. The current–time (I–t) curves show that the photocurrent reaches levels up to nA, and the dark current is equal to the device noise current, viz., as low as 10 fA Hz−1/2. The ION/IOFF ratio reached 105 when no bias was applied. In addition, the responsivity and detectivity of the MOS photodetector increased with the applied bias. The detectivity at 0 V was calculated to be 8.8 × 1010 Jones. The fast response time of the photodetector was less than 30 ms under a low operating voltage of 0.1 V. These critical parameters were compared with those of previously reported self-powered perovskite photodetectors, as shown in Table 1. The origin of the self-powered behavior is also listed. Furthermore, the suppressed dark current that significantly reduces the power consumption of the MOS photodetector was confirmed.

2. Experimental section
Material preparation
The methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) precursor was synthesized according to previously reported methods.3,43 First, 34 mL of methylamine (33 wt% in absolute ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich) and 15 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Sigma- Aldrich) were mixed to react at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The yellow–brown precipitate was recovered via rotary evaporation of water at 60 °C for 1 h. The precipitate, CH3NH3I, was washed with diethyl ether by stirring the solution for 1 h, which was repeated more than three times, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
The perovskite films were prepared according to a one-step solution process. First, CH3NH3I and lead iodide (PbI2) precursors were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which contains dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (PbI2:MAI:DMSO = 1:1:4) with a molar ratio of 1:1, to form the perovskite precursor solution.44,45 Next, the precursor solutions were spin-coated onto the well-treated substrate at a rate of 4000 rpm for 30 s in a nitrogen glove box. Then, the substrates were heated at 100 °C for 4 h for crystallization. After cooling, the as-prepared films were washed with isopropanol and dried at 65 °C for 5 min. Finally, the wet mixed solution was annealed at 80 °C for 40 min.
Materials and devices characterization
A scanning electron microscope (JSM-6700F, Japan) was used to acquire surface SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3 films, where a operating voltage of 5 kV and magnification of 10000× were applied. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the crystallized CH3NH3PbI3 films were recorded using an XRD7000 diffractometer (Shimadzu Corp. Japan) with Cu Kα target radiation with a power of 2.7 kW. The absorption spectra were used to test the absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3 films grown on the FTO substrate using an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer (Lambda40p, USA) over a wavelength range from 350 to 850 nm. Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy was performed to study the fluorescence properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 films (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments). The XPS depth profile (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer) was obtained via single alternating 68 s sputtering with a 1 keV Ar+ beam, and XPS analysis was performed using a 400 μm spot size for monochromatic Al-K alpha radiation. The quantification results obtained from the Shirley background was performed using the advantage software to subtract the pass energy over the measurement spectrum obtained at 200 eV with the energy step size of 1 eV. The dark noise current was measured using a low noise current preamplifier (Stanford SR560). The I–V, C–V and I–t measurements of the devices were recorded using a Keysight B1500A semiconductor parameter analyzer and a Signotone Micromanipulator S-1160 probe station under simulated AM 0.05G irradiation (white light, 5 mW cm−2) using a light-emitting diode (LED) attached to the microscope of the probe station as the light source. The devices were measured at room temperature in ambient atmosphere (temperature: 25 °C, humidity: ∼50% RH). The samples were stored in a dry atmosphere (temperature: 25 °C, humidity: ∼10% RH) after the measurement.
3. Results and discussion
The photodetector with the MOS structure of Pt/CH3NH3PbI3/SiO2/Si/Al is presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). A SiO2 surface layer (∼300 nm) was obtained by thermal oxidation of the n-type doped Si (n++, 500 μm) wafers. The substrates were successively ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 3 min and dried with nitrogen gas, followed by treatment with ultraviolet ozone (UV-O3). Next, a 100 nm-thick aluminum layer was deposited on the well-cleaned Si surface by magnetron sputtering with 100 W DC power and 20 mTorr working pressure. Then, the perovskite film was spin coated onto the well-treated SiO2 surface by utilizing the method mentioned above. Finally, 120 nm-thick Pt electrodes were deposited onto the perovskite film via magnetron sputtering with 20 W DC power and 20 mTorr working pressure through a shadow mask. The electrode area was 6.4 × 10−3 cm2. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, UV-visible absorption (UV-Vis) spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-grown perovskite films are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics under dark and under light illumination (5 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 1(a). The light-to-dark (ION/IOFF) ratio is more than 103 over a wide range of voltage (from 0 to ±10 V). The dark current curves exhibit an apparent hysteresis behavior compared with the photocurrent curves, which is attributed to the ion-predominant current under dark.46 Moreover, the built-in electric field is not zero in the dark when the device is polarized by an external electric field. The zero drift value of the MOS structure reaches up to ∼4 V, which is far larger than that of the photodiode structure.16,20,44 For the photodiode structure, the large drift originates from the ions that permeate into the interior of the electron transport layer or hole transport layer and distribute over a wide range under dark.47 However, for our MOS structure, the SiO2 block layer seems to be more rigid to the mobile ions. Hence, the accumulated ions/vacancies are concentrated on the SiO2 side close to the perovskite layer.46 The same situation was observed at the metal electrode side because the electron transport layer and hole transport layer were not employed. Since the perovskite film is sandwiched by the SiO2 and metal electrodes, the positive and negative ions/vacancies accumulated at the two opposite interfaces are populated under the scan voltage. Therefore, a larger built-in electric field is formed for the MOS structure compared with previous results shown with the photodiode structure.33,34,41 The ion accumulation observed for the MOS structure was also detected by the capacitor–voltage (C–V) measurements.45 As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the C–V curves show large hysteresis loops under dark, while the loops disappear under illumination when a positive gate voltage is applied. These results are consistent with those of the I–V measurements and further underscore the influence of the mobile ions.

(c) I–t characteristic curves obtained by on/off switching at 0 V. (d) I–t characteristic curves illuminated with a light intensity of 5 mW cm−2 obtained by ON/OFF switching under different voltages. 

Fig. 1(b) shows the I–V curves of the MOS photodetector under different light illumination intensities. The hysteresis loops almost disappear even under a low light intensity of 2 mW cm−2. These results highlight that the mobile ions take part in carrier transport, particularly under dark conditions. Under illumination, a large number of photogenerated carriers overlap with the transport effect of the mobile ions, resulting in a reduced hysteresis loop. With the increase in the light intensity, the photocurrent increases almost linearly, suggesting that the MOS photodetector is a photoconductor under light illumination. To evaluate the performance of the MOS photodetector, the time-dependent photoresponse was recorded by periodically switching the light illumination. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the photodetector exhibits a repeatable ON/OFF switching at 0 V over multiple cycles, indicating a self-powered behavior. Due to the barrier effect of the SiO2 layer (Fig. S4, ESI†), the dark current fluctuates to an ultralow value when the applied bias is 0 V. Since the device itself has a noise current, the dark current at 0 V is considered to be the noise current (∼10−14 A Hz−1/2). The noise current itself shows frequency-independent behavior in the dark at low frequencies, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The photocurrent is about 3.25 nA under a light intensity of 5 mW cm−2 at 0 V; thus, the ION/IOFF ratio is nearly 105 without bias. Furthermore, the time-dependent photoresponse was recorded under switching of light irradiation at voltages of ±0.1 V, ±1 V, and ±5 V, as shown in Fig. 1(d). It is clear that the photocurrent increases continuously with the increased bias. Moreover, the highest ION/IOFF ratio observed was 103, which was determined from the I–t curves at 5 V. The dark currents measured at ±0.1 V show undulations, indicating that the carrier cannot easily traverse the SiO2 barrier at such low voltages. When operating at ultralow voltages of ±0.1 V, the reduced dark currents ensure low energy consumption. To verify the barrier property of SiO2, a photodiode structure of Pt/CH3NH3PbI3/Pt was employed. As shown in Fig. S6(a) (ESI†), the dark current and photocurrent variations with the switching time are similar, implying that the Pt/CH3NH3PbI3/Pt device lacks self-powered behavior at 0 V. As shown in Fig. S6(b) (ESI†), the I–t curves of the Pt/perovskite/Pt photodetector applied with various voltages are measured. It is hard to distinguish the photocurrent from the dark current when the applied voltages are ±0.1 V, further indicating the absence of self-powered behavior in the photodetectors with Pt/CH3NH3PbI3/Pt structure.
The responsivity (R) is the ratio of the photocurrent to the incident light intensity and represents the response of the photodetector to the light signal. R can be expressed by the following equation:35 (1)where Ilight is photocurrent, Idark is dark current, Jlight is photocurrent density, Jdark is dark current density, S is the effective area of the photodetector and Plight is the incident light intensity. The specific detectivity (D) is determined by the dark noise current and the responsivity when the dark current is dominated by the shot noise, and D can be expressed by the following equation:35 (2)where q is the elementary charge, and Jd is the dark noise current. Fig. 2(a) shows the photocurrent as a function of the incident light intensity obtained from I–V curves at 5 V. The slope is related to R. Clearly, the photocurrent increases linearly with the light intensity from 1 to 200 mW cm−2, indicating that R is a constant under the same bias. The relationship between R and V is extracted from the I–t curves, as shown in Fig. 2(b). R increases linearly with the applied voltage. The increased voltage promotes the efficient separation and drift of photogenerated carriers, resulting in the enhancement of photocurrent. The relationship between D and V was also calculated according to eqn (2) and shown in Fig. 2(b). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the noise current shows frequency independence under dark at low frequencies, suggesting that the shot noise is dominant. Since the detectivity is proportional to responsivity, D increases linearly with the increase in bias voltage. The value of D is ∼8.8 × 1010 Jones at 0 V.

(b) Responsivity and detectivity as a function of applied voltage. (c) Rise and (d) fall time of the MOS photodetector at a bias of 0.1 V. The green lines represent bi-exponential fitting. 
For a detailed response time, a quantitative analysis of the rise and fall process is represented by fitting the response curves. Fig. 2(c) and (d) show the rise and fall time fitted by the bi-exponential decay equation at an applied voltage of 0.1 V.11 The fitting method and parameters are shown in ESI.† The rise and fall time are 25.8 ms and 620 μs, respectively. The fall time is significantly less than the rise time, indicating the OFF characteristics are superior to the ON characteristics. The large rise time may originate from the ascending process containing two steps. The first step is the light-induced ion current (light polarization), and the second step is the photogenerated carrier current under the applied voltage.
Based on all the experimental observations, we will now discuss the possible mechanism that is responsible for the self-powered behavior observed in the MOS photodetector. We first considered the possibility of Schottky junctions between the perovskite and the metal Pt.30,36,40 To confirm whether the built-in electric field was induced by the Schottky junction, a gold (Au) electrode well known to form ohmic contact with perovskite was used.9 The I–t curves of the photodetector with an Au electrode at 0 V are shown in Fig. 2(a). The same self-powered behavior was exhibited as that by photodetector with the Pt electrode. The dark current of the Au electrode-based photodetector coincides with that of the Pt electrode-based photodetector. However, the photocurrent of the latter is 2.5 times greater than that of the former, which may be attributed to the better energy level match between platinum and perovskite. This result shows that the self-powered behavior is not caused by the Schottky junction.
Ionic polarization under an applied voltage is another possible mechanism for the movable ion acting as another species that can induce current in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films.19,48 To examine the effect of ion movement on the self-powered characteristics, pre-polarization was applied on the MOS photodetector under different conditions. Fig. 3(a) shows the self-powered characteristics after polarization at different voltages (1 V, 2 V, and 5 V) under 5 mW cm−2 illumination for 30 s. The photocurrents and dark currents show minor changes in contrast to the large changes observed for both the photocurrent and dark current when the MSM photoconductor was subjected to an external bias greater than 0.1 V. Bias polarization time can also affect the number of movable charges and the magnitude of the built-in electric field,47 which may induce the self-powered characteristics. For the polarized sample, the transient photocurrent was measured after polarization at −5 V for 30 s, 60 s, and 90 s, as shown in Fig. 3(b). With the increase in polarization time, the photocurrent increased slightly but not significantly, indicating that the polarization time had negligible effect on the self-powered behavior. Although some reports have suggested that illumination and darkness have a great influence on perovskite fabrication and device performance,12,19 the effects of pre-polarization under illumination and darkness on photodetector performance are still unclear. In Fig. S7 (ESI†), the self-powered characteristics under both light and dark polarization at −5 V are shown. After dark polarization, the transient photocurrent is slightly greater than that after light polarization. This difference between the transient photocurrents may be attributed to the increase in the ion current from the dark-state to the photo-state,24,48i.e., the ion and electron currents coexist at the instant of conversion from the dark to the photo-state. In short, no significant difference exists for the photocurrent regardless of whether a bias is applied; the built-in electric field inside the perovskite film is only enhanced or weakened by pre-polarization under bias conditions. All these results suggest that the self-powered behavior does not result from bias pre-polarization of the perovskites.

Although heterojunctions have been widely observed in perovskite/perovskite or perovskite/transport layer interfaces,34,49,50 it is difficult to form a heterojunction between perovskite and SiO2 due to the large conduction band offset (2.07 eV) and valence band offset (4.55 eV) at the perovskite/SiO2 interface. A corresponding band diagram obtained from XPS analysis is shown in Fig. 4(a). XPS survey spectra analysis and related theoretical methods are presented in Fig. S8 and ESI,† respectively. The light-induced ion drifts resulting from the intrinsic light-induced self-poling effect in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite have been recognized.19,22,24,48 The light-induced self-poling effect has an important influence on the performance of perovskite solar cells, providing an additional open circuit voltage, i.e., it can induce a built-in electric field in the perovskite layer. For the self-powered behavior of the MOS photodetector, this effect also needs to be considered. When no bias is applied, the mobile ions within the perovskite layer show electrical disorder in the dark and the perovskite has a uniform Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The perovskite can be regarded as an intrinsic semiconductor; there is no current induced by extra electrons/holes or the ions, so the ultralow and fluctuant dark current signal originates from the noise current of the device. Under illumination, the built-in electric field is formed when the positive ions/vacancies accumulate at the perovskite/SiO2 interface and the negative ions/vacancies accumulate at the perovskite/Pt interface due to preset built-in potential caused by band bending in the asymmetrical device.22,51,52 The model is shown in Fig. 4(c). Under the dark condition, SiO2 can be used as an insulating layer and function as a barrier for the carriers, resulting in the low dark current. Under illumination, these populated ions or vacancies with opposite charges at the interfaces are the primary reason of the built-in electric field. The photogenerated electron and hole carriers are well-separated and drift due to the built-in electric field. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the holes are well-collected by the Pt electrode, while the electrons traverse through the SiO2 film and are collected by the Al electrode through the ion (traps)-assisted emission mechanism (Frenkel–Poole emission).53 As shown in Fig. S9 and Table S1 (ESI†), the elemental distribution X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy measurements show that the iodide ions enter into the SiO2 network, which was also observed by other groups.54 The photocurrent–voltage curves were well fitted by the Frenkel–Poole emission leakage mechanism. The linear relationship observed under the low applied voltage is shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). A detailed explanation and description can be found in the ESI.† Thus, the self-powered behavior in the MOS photodetector can be explained clearly by the light-induced self-poling effect. In particular, a large ION/IOFF ratio is obtained since SiO2 can act as a barrier when no extra bias is applied under dark conditions. Though the suppressed photocurrent blocked by the SiO2 under illumination results in a moderate R compared with that of the state-of-the-art photodetector, the ultralow dark current contributes to the low power consumption. More importantly, the self-powered behavior was observed in such a MOS structure without a hole/electron transport layer.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a reliable perovskite-based photodetector with MOS structure with low dark current and power consumption was demonstrated. Due to the light-induced self-poling effect, a self-powered behavior was observed and investigated. The photodetector yielded a fast photoresponse with a rise time of 25.8 ms and fall time of 620 μs under a 5 mW cm−2 light illumination, and the ION/IOFF ratio reached 105 with a bias of 0 V. We emphasize that taking advantage of the ion migration in CH3NH3PbI3 films makes it possible to obtain self-powered behavior in the photodetector device. It is demonstrated that light-induced self-poling effect is an intrinsic property of perovskites and the transport layer is optional. Beyond perovskite materials, we believe that this self-powered behavior can explain the ion migration in a broad range of semiconductors and help gain insight into ion redistribution behaviors at the nanoscale.
