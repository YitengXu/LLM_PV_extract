    , Accepted 8th September 2014First published on 8th September 2014AbstractWe report a one-step conversion of a dimensionally mixed ternary nanocomposite from zero-dimensional (0D) cerium oxide (CeO2), one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and two-dimensional (2D) reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanomaterials by the chemical precipitation method. The RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite showed excellent electrochemical performance (electrical double layer capacitor properties) in an aqueous electrolyte followed by long term cyclic stability and high energy density compared to its binary counterparts.
Introduction
Carbon-based nanostructures such as fullerenes, nanotubes or nanofibers and graphene have become a common interest of many materials scientists, biochemists, and nanotechnologists in recent years.1–13 In addition, these nanocarbons exhibit specific properties depending on their dimensions.14–18 Carbon-based materials can be classified based on dimensionalities of the nanostructures as the entire range of dimensionalities can be found in the nanocarbon family such as zero-dimensional (0D) fullerenes or diamond clusters, one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes or nanofibers, two-dimensional (2D) graphene sheets, and three-dimensional (3D) nanocrystalline diamonds and fullerite.19,20
It would be highly expected that integration of these dimensionalities is one of the important keys to develop novel functions in nanocarbon materials. A novel concept of nanoarchitectonics would work on this purpose.21–26
Carbon nanostructures depending on their dimensions cover a wider range of applications including anode materials for rechargeable lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries, optoelectronic devices, biomedicine, sensing, and catalysis. Two-D graphene shows excellent electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties so that it finds extensive applications in the fields of energy-related materials, sensors, and catalysts.27–29 Due to its high surface area and good chemical stability, it has also been used as an adsorbent, supercapacitor, and support material to design heterogeneous catalysts with enhanced activities. It has been demonstrated that graphene-supported metals or metal oxide nanoparticles enhance hydrogen storage capacity, exhibit high efficiencies for CO oxidation and oxygen reductions, superior electrochemical sensing, and fuel cell applications.30–32
Design of graphene-based hybrid materials to improve device performance has attracted intense attention. Such novel graphene nanohybrids or nanocomposites can be developed combining graphene with polymers, semiconducting quantum dots, and metallic nanoparticles.33–36 Graphene/polymer composites have shown enhanced electrical conductivity, electrochemical capacity, and mechanical strength.37 Similarly, composites of graphene and semiconductor materials have demonstrated enhanced performance in solar cells, Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors.38,39 The insertion of novel metallic nanoparticles such as silver and gold into the graphene matrix not only results in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), but also shows better catalytic activity and increased sensitivity in electrochemical and chemical sensing. Such materials have also efficiently been used in DNA detection.40–43 Extensive efforts have been taken to incorporate metal nanoparticles on the graphite oxide (GO) sheets and several methods including thermal evaporation, microwave assisted synthesis, photochemical synthesis, and chemical reduction have been developed to attach novel metallic nanoparticles on the GO sheets. However, despite the extensive studies, ternary composites consisting of graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and metal oxides nanocrystals have not been explored yet. Dimensionally mixed multifunctional nanostructures with two or more types of materials using covalent or noncovalent interactions can extend new functionalities in these nanostructures and can open the possibilities of novel applications.
In this contribution, we report the one-step conversion of a dimensionally mixed composite from 0D cerium oxide (CeO2), 1D CNT, and 2D reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanomaterials into a RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite based on the materials nanoarchitectonics concept (Scheme 1) and discuss its significant enhancement of electrochemical performance in an aqueous electrolyte. This novel composite material is anticipated to offer excellent electrochemical sensing and electrocatalytic activities.44,45 Although the high surface area of RGO is anticipated to exhibit excellent electrochemical properties due to the inherent limitation of restacking of RGO driven by the π–π interaction, a suitable spacing material needs to be intercalated into the RGO sheets to avoid the recombination of graphene layers. CNTs due to their remarkable thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties derived from their unique structure, high aspect ratio and long range π–π conjugation46–48 can be a potential candidate as the spacing material to avoid restacking of the RGO sheet.49–52 CNTs lying on the basal spacing between the graphene layers avoid RGO stacking and consequently enhance the conductive network for the electron transport within the matrix. Distribution of 0D CeO2 nanocrystals (an excellent electrochemical redox material) into the RGO/CNT hybrid conducting matrix is found to enhance the electrochemical performance of the ternary composite.

Experimental
Materials
Synthetic graphite powder (average particle size < 20 μm) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Japan. Sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen peroxide, magnesium nitrate, iron nitrate, ammonium molybdate and citric acid were purchased from Nacalai tesque, Japan. Sodium nitrate, potassium permanganate, and sodium hydroxide were the products of Wako Chemical, Japan. Cerium nitrate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Japan. All the materials were used as received without further purifications. De-ionized water was used throughout this study.
Preparation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes
Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized by the catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method using Fe–Mo/MgO as a catalyst. For the preparation of the catalyst, iron nitrate [Fe(NO3)3·9H2O] (0.064 g), ammonium molybdate [(NH4)5Mo7O24·4H2O] (0.061 g), magnesium nitrate [Mg(NO3)2·6H2O] (1.153 g) and citric acid [C6H8O7] (1.0 g) were dissolved in de-ionized water and stirred for 6 h at 90 °C.53 The solution was dried at 120 °C for 24 h and calcined at 550 °C in air for 1 h. The freshly prepared catalyst (100 mg) was placed in a quartz boat inside an alumina tube, nitrogen gas was then passed through the tube at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 followed by increasing the temperature slowly to 700 °C (at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1). Once the temperature became 700 °C nitrogen gas supply was stopped and acetylene gas was supplied for 30 min (30 mL min−1). Finally, the temperature was decreased down to room temperature. The obtained black powder was treated with concentrated HCl to remove impurities, filtered, and dried at 80 °C. The as-prepared carbon nanotubes were functionalized by treating with concentrated HNO3 at 60 °C for 24 h.
Preparation of graphite oxide (GO)
Graphitic oxide (GO) was synthesized by the modified Hummer's method.54 Graphite powder (2 g) was added to concentrated H2SO4 (46 mL) at 0 °C in an ice bath and stirred for 5 min. NaNO3 (1 g) was then added and the solution was stirred for 5 min. KMnO4 (6 g) was added slowly into the resulting mixture and stirring continued for 30 min at 35 °C. H2O (96 mL) was then added dropwise to the above mixture and the temperature was increased to 98 °C and maintained for 30 min; then a further aliquot of H2O (280 mL) was added and stirring was continued for 10 min. Finally, aqueous H2O2 (30 mL, 30%) was added dropwise. The initially black colored mixture changed into a reddish-brown color.
Synthesis of RGO/CNT/CeO2 composites
The prepared GO (100 mg) was added to water (100 mL) and ultrasonication was applied to the resulting mixture for 2 h in a sonication bath (BRANSON 3510). Functionalized CNTs (100 mg) were then added to the GO solution followed by ultrasonication for 1 h. Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (2.17 g) was added to the mixture of GO and CNT solution and stirred for 30 min. NaOH pellets (10 mg) were added to maintain the solution at pH 10. The solution was vigorously stirred for 6 h at 90 °C and filtered followed by repeated washing with de-ionized water and ethanol, and the material was dried at 60 °C under reduced pressure. CNT/CeO2 and RGO/CeO2 composites were prepared following the same procedure. CeO2 nanoparticles were prepared using above conditions without a carbon source.
Characterization
The products were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Crystal structures of the samples were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns were measured on an Altima III Rint 2000 (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å) diffractometer at 25 °C. Fourier transferred-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a Nicolet 4700. Raman scattering spectra were recorded on a Horiba-Jobin-Yvon T64000 with a 532 nm laser at 25 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Theta Probe spectrometer (Thermo Electron Co. Germany) using monochromated Al Kα radiation (photon energy 15 KeV, maximum energy resolution ≤0.47 eV, and maximum space resolution ≤15 μm). High resolution spectra; core level O 1s, Ce 3d, and C 1s were recorded in 0.05 eV steps. A built-in electronic charge neutralizing electron flood gun was used to prevent sample charging. Wide spectra in the 1000–0 eV binding energy range were recorded. N2 adsorption isotherms were recorded on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ2.
Electrochemical performance
The electrochemical properties of the materials were studied using a three-electrode system in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at room temperature (25 °C). A bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as a working electrode was a mirror polished with Al2O3 slurry and rinsed with double-distilled water and sonicated in acetone for 5 min. The working electrode was modified by dispersing RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary composites (10 mg) in methanol solution (1 mL) to form a slurry. The slurry was sonicated for 10 min and 10 μL of the slurry was placed on the GCE surface and dried at room temperature for 3 h. Five μL of Nafion solution (0.25%) was added on the modified working electrode surface as a binder and dried at 70 °C for 1 h. Working electrodes for CeO2, and CNT/CeO2 were prepared using the same method. Platinum wire was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry at −1 to 0 V were performed on a CH instruments model: (CHI 850D Work station (USA)). The specific capacitance (Cs) was calculated from the discharge curves using eqn (1).55,56 (1)where, Cs, I, t, ΔV, and m are the specific capacitance (F g−1), discharge current (A), the discharge time (s), potential window, and mass of the active material, respectively.
Results and discussion
The dimensionally mixed ternary nanocomposite (RGO/CNT/CeO2) containing 0D CeO2 nanoparticles distributed on 1D CNT and 2D RGO nanomaterials was prepared in a single step by the chemical precipitation method with in situ reduction. Ultrasonication was applied to the aqueous mixture of GO, MWCNT and Ce(NO3)3, the precursor of cerium nanoparticles, followed by vigorous stirring at 90 °C under basic conditions (pH = 10) to obtain the precipitate of the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite. The CNT/CeO2 binary nanocomposite was also prepared using the same procedure. Fig. 1 shows TEM images of CNT/CeO2 and RGO/CNT/CeO2. The CNT/CeO2 binary nanocomposite clearly showed that CeO2 nanocubes formed with the average size of 10 nm, were attached on the surface of CNTs, and well distributed in the CNT network (Fig. 1a and b).

Additional TEM images of the CNT/CeO2 binary composite are supplied in Fig. S1 of the ESI†. In the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite, 0D CeO2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the surface of CNTs and RGO sheets (Fig. 1c and d). Additional TEM (Fig. S2†) and HR-TEM images (Fig. S3†) of the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary composite are supplied in the ESI.† Fig. S4† shows results of TEM/EDS elemental mapping.
The crystal phase and structure information of the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite was identified by XRD measurements (Fig. 2A). The XRD patterns of CNT/CeO2 binary and RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposites showed four major peaks at 28.5°, 33.1°, 47.5°, and 56.3°, which correspond respectively to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of face-center cubic CeO2 (JCPDS 78-0694). Using Debye–Scherrer's equation, average crystalline sizes of cerium nanocrystals in CNT/CeO2 and RGO/CNT/CeO2 were 12 ± 0.5 and 11 ± 0.5 nm, respectively. Diffraction peaks of GO and MWCNT were not observed in the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite due to the low degree of graphitization caused by the deposition of CeO2 nanoparticles on their surfaces.57

To reveal the surface functional groups and the interaction among the three components in the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite, FTIR measurements were conducted (Fig. 2B). For the CNT/CeO2 binary nanocomposite, the characteristic peaks of functionalized CNTs at 2925 (C–H asymmetric stretching), 2854 (C–H symmetric stretching), 3410 (O–H stretching), 1603 (CO stretching), 1420 (CC stretching), 1265 (O–H bending vibration) and 1080 cm−1 (C–O stretching vibration) were observed with the observation of the Ce–O stretching peak at 511 cm−1.58 This result also supports the formation of CeO2 nanoparticles on the surface of CNTs (Fig 2B(c)–(e)). In the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite, skeletal vibration of CC (1558 cm−1 as by * in Fig. 2B(e)) and C–O–C stretching (1054 cm−1) of GO, and Ce–O stretching (490 cm−1) were clearly observed in comparison with GO and CNT/CeO2 though the carbonyl group (1724 cm−1) was disappeared (Fig. 2B(e)).59 These results not only indicate the formation of CeO2 nanoparticles but also confirm the conversion of GO into RGO during the preparation of the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite by in situ reduction.60
Further characterization of the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite was performed by Raman spectroscopy, which is known as a non-destructive method to characterize carbon-based materials. Raman spectra of GO, CNT, CeO2, CNT/CeO2, and RGO/CNT/CeO2 are shown in Fig. 3. A strong Raman band appearing at 463 cm−1 for CeO2 nanocrystals (Fig. 3A(c)) can be assigned to the triply degenerate F2g mode as a symmetrical stretching mode of the Ce–O8 vibration unit. The F2g vibrational mode is sensitive to the disorder in the oxygen sublattice, which usually occurs during oxygen doping and also to the thermally induced non-stoichiometry effect.61 A blue shift (band shifted from 463 to 453 cm−1) corresponding to the F2g mode is observed in the Raman spectrum of CNT/CeO2 (Fig. 3A(d)). A similar blue shift (from 463 to 455 cm−1) is observed in the RGO/CNT/CeO2 system (Fig. 3A(e)). These blue shifts are clear evidences of the charge transfer between CeO2 and CNT and CeO2 and RGO.62

In order to estimate the disordered structure of RGO and CNTs in prepared composite materials, we have displayed the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) in Fig. 3B. Clear D (1353 cm−1) and G bands (1592 cm−1) are observed in CNTs, GO, CNT/CeO2 and RGO/CNT/CeO2 (Fig. 3A(a) and (b) and 3B(d) and (e)). From the intensity ratio of D and G bands (ID/IG), one can say that CNT/CeO2 binary (1.28) and RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary composites (1.56) (Fig. 3B) were more disordered structures than the functionalized CNTs (ID/IG 1.12). This observation is consistent with the corrugation and scrolling structure observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moreover, the ID/IG ratio of RGO/CNT/CeO2 was higher compared with those of CNT/CeO2 and GO (ID/IG 0.93), which can be attributed to the reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups (i.e. conversion of GO into RGO, as ID/IG for RGO is calculated to be 1.2 (ref. 63)). This indicates the restoration of the graphene sheets. Minute observations of Raman spectra revealed that the D and G bands of the CNT/CeO2 and RGO/CNT/CeO2 composites slightly shifted towards higher frequency, which could be due to different C–C bond lengths of CNTs and C–CeO2.63
The chemical state of elements in the ternary RGO/CNT/CeO2 nanocomposite and the extent of reduction of GO to RGO were further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A survey XPS spectrum of RGO/CNT/CeO2 presented in Fig. 4a clearly shows the presence of C 1s, O ls, and Ce 3d elements in the RGO/CNT/CeO2 nanocomposite. As shown in Fig. 4b, the XPS C 1s peak can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.7, 286.0, and 289.1 eV. The binding energy of 284.7 eV is a typical peak position for graphitic carbon and demonstrates sp2-hybridized carbon in the graphene state. The peaks at 286.0 and 289.1 eV can be attributed to the C–O and CO oxygen containing carbonaceous bands.64,65 The XPS spectrum of O 1s in Fig. 4c can also be deconvoluted into two peaks with the peak maximum at 529.8 eV for Ce–O and 533.0 eV for C–O, respectively. Previous studies showed that the XPS O 1s spectrum of GO contains carboxylate (C–OH) and carbonyl (CO) groups; the peaks at ∼533 eV and ∼528 eV correspond to the oxygen functional group.63 These results suggest that the GO converted into RGO by in situ reduction due to binding of the cerium precursor and oxygen functional groups. Fig. 4d shows the XPS spectrum of cerium 3d. The 3d cerium XPS spectrum could be deconvoluted into five peaks; 883.53, 888.91, 899.02, 901.53, and 907.62 eV. The peaks with binding energy 883.53 and 899.02 eV correspond to the Ce3+ ions, whereas, the peaks observed at 888.91, 901.53, and 907.62 eV correspond to Ce4+ ions.63 The CeO2 has a fluorite crystal structure, and the Ce4+ cation is surrounded by 8O2− anions and O2– anions are organized with Ce4+. The presence of Ce3+ ions introduces oxygen vacancies in the crystal; such high oxygen vacancies show the charge transfer effect from the CeO2 to CNT/RGO.63

To avoid restacking of graphene sheets and irreversible agglomeration due to van der Waals interactions during electrode preparation, CNTs could be introduced as spacers into the graphene layers. Such modification in the nanoarchitecture is anticipated to enhance the overall surface area and electrochemical performance. We have measured the surface areas of the prepared materials by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (Fig. 5). All the isotherms exhibit type IV adsorption isotherms with the H1 hysteresis loop. Surface area was calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The surface areas of CeO2 nanoparticles and the CNT/CeO2 binary nanocomposite were 60.8 m2 g−1 and 110.8 m2 g−1 with the pore volume of 0.11 cm3 g−1 and 0.28 cm3 g−1, respectively. After the formation of the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite, the surface area was significantly increased to 160 m2 g−1, and the corresponding pore volume was also increased to 0.42 cm3 g−1. It is anticipated that introduction of RGO in the composite reduces the aggregation of CeO2 that leads to a high surface area.

In order to access the surface area offered by our material, we have studied the electrochemical performance of the ternary nanocomposite in the aqueous electrolyte. Fig. 6 shows cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CNT/CeO2 and RGO/CNT/CeO2 nanocomposite within the potential range from −1.0 to 0.0 V measured at different scan rates (5–100 mV s−1). The CV curves of CeO2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. S5.† The CV curves of CNT/CeO2 (Fig. 6a) show a rectangular shape at all scan rates showing the electrical double layer capacitor behaviour. The absence of the redox peak of CeO2 is believed to be due to the synergistic effects of CeO2 with the double layer capacitance of the CNT network. Charging and discharging occur at the pseudo constant rate during the entire volumetric cycle. Note that CeO2 itself gives a small capacitance. Significant enhancement in the electrochemical performance could be achieved in the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite (Fig. 6b). The overall window size of the CV curve of RGO/CNT/CeO2 drastically expanded which is an indication of the enhanced capacitance compared to the CNT/CeO2. The excellent capacitive properties of the ternary composite can be attributed to the homogenous distribution of CeO2 nanoparticles on CNTs and high electrical conductivity of RGO.

Galvanostatic charge–discharge (C–D) curves of CeO2, CNT/CeO2 and RGO/CNT/CeO2 electrodes prepared on the glassy carbon support were recorded at different current densities in the potential range of −1.0 to 0 V (Fig. 7). Fig. 7a and b compare the C–D curves of CNT/CeO2 and RGO/CNT/CeO2 at different current densities (0.1 to 2.0 A g−1). A rapid response of the electrodes is observed in both the systems; the response of the electrode increases with increasing current density. Fig. 7c shows the electrochemical response of CeO2, CNT/CeO2 and RGO/CNT/CeO2 electrodes at 0.1 A g−1. The RGO/CNT/CeO2 electrode clearly shows longer discharge time compared to CeO2 and CNT/CeO2 electrodes. The extended discharge time is attributed to the combination of RGO, CNT and CeO2, which offers a larger charge capacity consistent with the CV profiles. Fig. 7d shows the calculated specific capacitance versus current density for the CeO2 nanoparticle, the CNT/CeO2 binary composite, and the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite. At a current density of 0.1 A g−1, the specific capacitance of CeO2, CNT/CeO2, and RGO/CNT/CeO2 is ca. 37, 188, and 215 F g−1, respectively. This demonstrates that the dimensionally mixed composite from 2D RGO, 1D CNT, and 0D CeO2 nanomaterials, the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite, is the best among individual components or CeO2 composites with CNTs, due to the CNTs acting as spacers to prevent the restacking of RGO, and also avoid the agglomeration of CeO2 nanoparticles.

It is known that cycle life is an important criterion for supercapacitors. We have carried out endurance tests for CeO2, CNT/CeO2 and RGO/CNT/CeO2 and recorded the C–D curves (Fig. S6†) for several cycles at 1 A g−1. Fig. 8A shows the calculated specific capacitance of the RGO/CNT/CeO2 electrode up to 100 cycles as a typical example. Note that the ternary nanocomposite electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability, retaining up to 85% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles. The energy density and power density are calculated from the charge–discharge curves of the RGO/CNT/CeO2 electrode. The specific energy (SE) and power (SP) were calculated by using eqn (2) and (3)66,67 (2) (3)where C (F g−1), ΔV and t (s) are specific capacitance, operating voltage range and discharge time, respectively. Fig. 8b shows the Ragone plot of the voltage window of −1.0 to 0 V at different current densities. The CNT/CeO2 binary nanocomposite shows the specific energy of 26.05 W h kg−1 at the current density of 0.1 A g−1. Compared to CNT/CeO2, the RGO/CNT/CeO2 electrode showed a higher specific energy of 29.86 W h kg−1 at 0.1 A g−1, which decreased down to 7.66 W h kg−1 upon increasing the current density from 0.1 A g−1 to 5 A g−1. The specific power of RGO/CNT/CeO2 was 49.98 W kg−1 at a specific energy of 29.86 W h kg−1. High specific energy and power were achieved with slow and fast charge–discharge rates, respectively.

The specific power and specific energy offered by the RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite is much higher than the conventional capacitors based on CeO2 nanoparticle/activated carbon (4.86 W h kg−1),68 RGO/CeO2 (20 W h kg−1), and CNT/CeO2 (26.05 W h kg−1). These results clearly show the importance of the construction of the dimensionally mixed RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary nanocomposite. This novel combination material could be promising supercapacitor materials as RGO and CNTs can provide the passage for electron and charge transport and enhance the electrical conductivity of CeO2.
Conclusions
We have succeeded in converting 0D (CeO2), 1D (CNTs), and 2D (RGO) nanomaterials into a dimensionally mixed RGO/CNT/CeO2 ternary composite in a single step by the chemical precipitation method. Zero-D CeO2 nanocrystals (with an average size of 10 nm) could be homogeneously distributed on the surface of the 2D RGO sheet and 1D CNTs, which function as spacing materials to avoid restacking of RGO. The dimensionally mixed composite material RGO/CNT/CeO2 showed excellent electrochemical performance due to synergistic effects contributed from CNT/RGO and CeO2 giving a specific capacitance value of ca. 215 F g−1. The observed high rate capability and 85% of capacity retention after 1000 cycles (long cycle life) demonstrate the importance of the dimensionally mixed ternary composite in energy-storage applications.
