Introduction
Nanostructured optoelectronics have attracted broad interest in recent years. Featured applications include photodetectors and solar cells (e.g. dye/perovskite sensitized,1–3 quantum dots,4,5 and other inorganic/organic hybrid devices6–8) which are engineered with sub-micrometer dimensions in order to benefit from nanoscale effects.9,10 They have several advantages over silicon,11 III–V group12 and high vacuum-based thin film PV technologies13 such as the potential for developing solution-processable, low-cost applications.14–16 However, due to the significantly enlarged surface area/interfaces, nanostructured optoelectronic devices are facing serious charge recombination issues,14,17 to which finding effective interface engineering strategies has become very important.
Various methods have been applied to engineer the interface. For example, molecular dipole layers,18,19 and ligand exchange20,21 were proven to be able to greatly improve the device performance by optimizing the band alignment, and increasing the absorber film mobility, respectively. Meanwhile, the interfacial inorganic layers (i.e. Al2O3,22 ZrO2,23 TiO2,24 CdSe,25 ZnS,26etc.) are also being widely investigated to reduce charge recombination in nanostructured photovoltaic cells. When considering the technique of deposition, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has the superiority in introducing high-quality, conformal films on high aspect ratio surfaces, with Angstrom level control of film thickness, and excellent uniformity over large areas.22 For instance, a very thin layer of Al2O3 deposited by ALD can effectively reduce recombination by acting as a barrier to allow only electrons tunneling through.9
CuZnSnS4–TiO2 nanostructures featuring a light absorber-electron conductor configuration are proposed as a means of achieving the full potential of a CZTS light absorber in optoelectronic applications.27–30 In an earlier work published by our group, CZTS nanocrystallites were deposited on rutile TiO2 nanorods (TNRs), as a proof-of-principle demonstration of light-electron conversion.28 Recently we introduced a solution coating method to facilitate deposition and carried out a comprehensive study of the CZTS–TNR nanostructure and interface.31 By applying a CdS interfacial layer, an efficiency of 2% was achieved for an all solid state device, an important advancement for nanostructured CZTS solar cell research.25,32,33 In this work we report nanoscale Al2O3 as a superior buffer layer to engineer the CZTS–TNR interface. As is shown, this approach enables the construction of high responsivity photodetectors with a voltage alterable spectral photoresponse as well as nanostructured solid state solar cells with enhanced performance. The effects of pre-deposited Al2O3 on interfacial recombination, band alignment, and possible doping defects have been studied, which to the best of our knowledge have not been fully considered previously. Eventually a dual interfacial layer of Al2O3/CdS has been applied and an improved photovoltaic efficiency was achieved due to the synergistic anti-recombination effect, which demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of this interface engineering strategy to nanostructured optoelectronic applications. The present work is considered an important progress towards exploring the potential of kesterite materials and designing new optoelectronic applications.
Results and discussion
Atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 at the CZTS–TiO2 interface for high sensitivity photodetectors
In this work, Cu2ZnSnS4 nanocrystallites were deposited as an absorber on TiO2 nanorods (TNRs) grown on FTO glass following the solution coating technique reported previously.31 But before applying the absorber layer, nanoscale Al2O3 was pre-deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD) on TNRs in order to engineer the interface of CZTS–TNR. We adjusted the number of ALD cycles and named the obtained samples ALD xc (x is the number of ALD cycles which corresponds to the thickness of Al2O3). To evaluate the effect of Al2O3 as a buffer layer, a gold layer of 80 nm was immediately applied after coating of CZTS, forming a nanostructured photodiode consisting of the basic P (CZTS)–I (Al2O3)–N (TiO2) junction (Fig. 1a). Fig. S1a–e† depict I–V characteristics of the photodiode as a function of Al2O3 layer thickness, where a clear difference between the light and dark current under reverse bias (positive voltage value) can be seen for all the devices except for the one without Al2O3 (ALD 0c); in the latter case the I–V curves under light and dark conditions are almost identical (weak photo response). This result clearly exemplifies the importance of the Al2O3 buffer layer in enabling the photodetecting function of the CZTS–TNR photodiode.

To further investigate this new nanostructured photodiode, a reverse bias of 4 V was applied to the diode and the devices were operated under photodetective mode as shown in Fig. 1a. The dark current (Fig. S1f†) has been significantly reduced after Al2O3 has been introduced, indicating the improved quality of the photodiode. The light switching characteristics have been studied by recording the time-dependent current with the light shutter being alternatively turned on and off. Fig. 1b shows the apparent photoresponse of all samples; despite their different baseline levels caused by different dark currents, the consistency of the light switching response for different on–off periods confirms the stability/reproducibility of the solid state photodetectors. The maximum photocurrent achieved is 35 mA for a device with two cycles of ALD applied Al2O3. As the number of ALD cycles increases, the photocurrent decreases accordingly due to the enlarged series resistance of the thicker Al2O3 insulating layer.
To characterize the wavelength-dependent gain of the photodetectors, the responsivity (Rλ in A W−1) – that is, the ratio of photocurrent (Iλ) to incident light intensity (Pλ) – was measured for the photodetectors with different thicknesses of Al2O3 following eqn (1): (1)
To facilitate the understanding of the effect of the Al2O3 layer when comparing different samples, Iλ is defined as the net photocurrent gain after deducting the portion of dark current (Fig. S1f†), and the light power intensity (Pλ) is calibrated as shown in Fig. S2.†Fig. 1c shows that all five devices demonstrate a broad UV-visible-NIR spectral response from 300 nm to 900 nm with two characteristic peaks appearing at ∼370 nm and ∼570 nm. The responsivity value increases dramatically when 2 cycles of ALD were performed (ALD 2c), reconfirming the importance of having the interfacial layer of Al2O3. However, thicker layers of Al2O3 did show a rather adverse impact on the photodetecting sensitivity, which agrees with the trend depicted in Fig. 1b. The external quantum efficiency of photodetectors can then be calculated viaeqn (2) by simply introducing the photon energy (hν): EQE = Rhν(2)
The results, plotted in Fig. 1d, were used to quantify the photodetecting capability of these devices. All the maximum responsivity values at 370 nm are listed in Table 1; among these ALD 2c shows the highest EQE of 58558% at 4 V reverse bias- – this value is comparable to that of high performance UV photodetectors.8,17 Very impressively the corresponding responsivity (∼170 A W−1) is nearly three orders of magnitude larger than that of the commercial GaN or SiC photodetectors (<0.2 A W−1). In the visible spectral range, the maximum light responsivity and EQE were measured to be ∼90 A W−1 and ∼20000% at 570 nm, respectively, which are, to the best of our knowledge, the highest among the CZTS based photodetectors reported to date.34–36

The photocurrent–light intensity dependency is another important parameter of a photodetector. To carry out this experiment, first we inserted different optical filters to the solar simulator to obtain the illumination powers of 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2), 0.8 Sun, 0.5 Sun, 0.3 Sun and 0.1 Sun. The measured photocurrent after removing the dark current background was plotted as shown in Fig. S3b,† where an exponential current–light intensity dependency is observed instead of a linear increase. This phenomenon indicates the possible light absorption saturation of the detectors. In other words, the light power from the solar simulator is too high that even an energy of 0.1 Sun is more than enough to generate maximum photocurrent. To verify this assumption, we used a monochromatic light source with an illumination intensity at only the microwatt level to perform the test at 390 nm (UV) and 530 nm (visible), respectively. As we expected, the measured photocurrents in Fig. S3c and d† show improved linearity of light intensity dependency (ALD 0c is excluded because it does not respond to this low level of signal). This response indicates that these devices are particularly suited for detecting low power light due to their apparent ultrahigh sensitivity.
Effect of the Al2O3 layer on the photovoltaic response of the CZTS–TNR photodiode
So far we have successfully fabricated the solid state photodetectors with a broad spectral response and ultra high responsivity, especially with high sensitivity to significantly weak light signals. Al2O3 has been proven vital in revealing the potential of CZTS–TNR heterostructures. To comprehensively characterize these photodetectors, the next step was to calculate the current on–off ratio (Ilight/Idark) at biases from −4 V (forward) to 4 V (reverse) and to plot the results as shown in Fig. 2a. As can be seen under reverse bias the ratio increases as the number of ALD Al2O3 layers increases, this being due to the significantly reduced dark current. As the bias gets closer to 0 V, however, the on–off ratio increases dramatically and eventually reaches the climax at 0 V for all samples, which means the devices can also function as self-powered photodetectors or photovoltaic cells.
 Fig. 2  (a) The current on–off ratio of the devices with various layers of ALD-deposited Al2O3 at different biases and (b) the J–V curves of the devices under photovoltaic mode; (c) the quantum efficiency of the devices under 0 V bias (photovoltaic mode) and (d) the calculated electron lifetime via the OCVD method. 
The photovoltaic J–V characteristics of all five devices at a bias close to 0 V are shown in Fig. 2b. Table 2 lists the parameters extracted from the J–V curves, from which we can see that the energy conversion efficiency increases progressively with the thickness (or number of layers) of Al2O3, reaching a maximum of 0.54% for the device ALD 6c. However, when the number of ALD cycles further increases to 10, though the Voc is slightly improved, there is a severe drop in Jsc resulting in a decrease of the overall efficiency. Further as can be seen in Fig. 2c, the EQE measured without external bias shows the same trend as Jsc, with device ALD 6c exhibiting the highest EQE of ∼21% in the blue light region. It becomes evident therefore that by employing the interfacial ALD layer of Al2O3, the response of the photovoltaic cells greatly improves as in the case of the devices under photodetective mode. When comparing the EQE spectra of photodetectors (Fig. 1b) to solar cells (Fig. 2c), however, the profiles are quite different. Especially the peaks centered at ∼370 nm (EQEmax) of all the photodetectors have completely disappeared after removing the external bias. This novel behaviour of a contrasting spectral response upon modifying the applied bias was also observed in a CZTS–GaN photodiode by Yang et al.34 This behavior was attributed to facilitated photoelectron transfer within the junction region by the reverse bias. Additionally, we think this behavior could have been due to the widening of the depleted region when applying external bias, having as a result the photoelectrons generated in deeper TiO2 to be more easily separated and collected, which consequently increases the measured photocurrent in the UV range as opposed to the photovoltaic cells in which only the photoelectrons within the narrow depleted region can be collected. This demonstrated behaviour of a contrasting spectral photoresponse by modulating the applied voltage opens interesting possibilities for the development of novel applications.

In order to determine the reason for the enhanced optoelectronic performance, we carried out time resolved open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements by closing the light shutter and recording the decay of Voc (Fig. S4†), which can be expressed as:37 (3)where EFn and EF0 stand for the quasi-equilibrium state under AM 1.5 conditions and the dark equilibrium state, respectively, n is the free electron density, n0 is the electron density under dark conditions, KB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10–23 J K−1), T is the absolute temperature, and e is the elementary charge. Then we can easily measure the logarithmic change of the free charge concentration, which is defined as the modified recombination rate (Rk) according to the formula:38 (4)
The carrier lifetime is then represented by the inverse of recombination rate:39 (5)
Since the starting Voc of these devices was not at the same level, we calculated the electron lifetime versus Voc through the entire dynamic process for a better comparison as depicted in Fig. 2d. From these results the effectiveness of Al2O3 deposition in prolonging the electron lifetime becomes very evident; thus the device without Al2O3 (ALD 0c) shows the shortest electron lifetime during the Voc decay, while it increases progressively as the number of ALD cycles increases. The longer charge carrier lifetime represents a lower recombination rate, which proves that atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 can effectively passivate the CZTS–TiO2 interface and suppress charge recombination. Therefore, reduced interface recombination should be the main reason for the improved photodetecting responsivity and photovoltaic performance.
Characterization of the CZTS–Al2O3–TNR nanostructure

XANES and EDS-f ratio determination of the composition and phase purity of CZTS on TNRs. 
In our earlier work, a combination of techniques (i.e. XPS, TEM, SEM, and EDS) had been applied to observe the spatial distribution of CZTS within either the TiO2 mesoporous or nanorod scaffold.28,29,31,40 In order to obtain a better resolved element spatial distribution – a challenge with interfacial nanomaterials – herein we performed EDS f-ratio imaging and XANES. The f-ratio method is defined as the ratio of the X-ray intensity from each element over the sum of all,41 which has perfectly demonstrated a clear separation of Ti and S (Fig. 3), representing CZTS and TiO2, respectively. EDS f-ratio maps of all individual elements at higher magnification are displayed in Fig. S5.† All Cu, Zn, Sn and S elements are found at almost the same location, which proves the homogeneity of the CZTS composition.
 Fig. 3  EDS f ratio maps of Ti and S for the CZTS–TNR sample. 
The presence of secondary phases in CZTS is usually of serious concern. It is challenging to differentiate CuS, Cu2S, SnS, ZnS, or SnS2 phases from CZTS using conventional XRD.42 Raman spectroscopy has shown its effectiveness in this respect but still is limited by the greatly varied optical characteristics of different materials.30,43,44 High resolution EDS also shows superiority in characterizing the nanoscale phase segregation.45 However, this bulk sensitive imaging method is still limited when the secondary phases are not apparently separated from the main CZTS kesterite phase. Therefore, more convincing evidence is required to exclude the presence of secondary phases.
In this regard, X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) as an element-, excitation channel-, and chemically sensitive technique that tracks the local structure and bonding of any given atom, has been well-documented as an effective method in determining the presence of secondary phases for CZTS using the S K-edge.46,47Fig. 4 shows the S K-edge XANES of the synthesized CZTS on TNRs in comparison to binary sulphides as references of possible impure phases. Due to the significant difference of the shape and position of the absorption edge, secondary phases of Cu2S, SnS, SnS2 and CuS (plotted in ref. 46) can be excluded. The possible ZnS impurity could cause a relative intensity change of the peak at E1 compared to the peak at E2 according to Just, et al.,47 but the slightly higher intensity of the former to the latter in this case proves its near ZnS impurity-free composition. In fact, the profile of our synthesized CZTS on TNRs well resembles the reference sample in ref. 47 which was considered to consist of a CZTS single phase. Therefore, the combined characterization by EDS and XANES proves our synthesized CZTS to be of high purity. Besides, Ti K-edge XANES was also performed on TNRs before and after applying CZTS. The results in Fig. S6† confirm the apparent rutile crystallinity of TNRs48 while the completely overlapped spectra suggest that the CZTS coating/annealing has no noticeable impact on the phase of TNRs and the local coordination of Ti.

Morphology of the Al2O3 buffer layer in the CZTS–Al2O3–TNR nanostructure. 
Apart from CZTS, the morphological information of the Al2O3 buffer layer on TNRs is also of interest in order to better understand its influence on the interface. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used in this regard and the materials with/without ALD treatment were characterized. In Fig. 5, the left column shows the CZTS–TNRs without Al2O3 pre-deposition; we can see clearly the feature of vertically aligned nanorod arrays coated with smaller nanocrystallites which are found to have higher brightness in the backscatter electron (BSE) images in Fig. 3b and d. Due to the higher overall atomic number of CZTS compared to TiO2 plus the EDS results in Fig. 3, the brighter phase is attributed to CZTS. As for those after Al2O3 layer deposition, since the one or two cycle deposited film is too thin to characterize, we choose the ALD 10 material for SEM characterization; this is shown in the right column of Fig. 5. When compared to the left column, a significant difference can be noticed: the original smooth TNR surface becomes rough after ALD treatment and large amounts of very small particles are shown adhering to TNRs. The contrast in the BSE images (Fig. 5f and h) between the nanorod and the nanoparticles is not distinguishable, which is very likely due to the not-too-much difference between the atomic number of Al2O3 and TiO2. Therefore, rather than to form a continuous, homogeneous film,49 Al2O3 tends to form “nanoislands” on the TNR substrate. This finding we think could be valuable to the future study of ALD assisted thin film growth on surfaces of a high aspect ratio.

Surface composition and band alignment of the CZTS–Al2O3–TNR interface
Here we investigate the impact this discontinuous layer of Al2O3 “nanoislands” has on the deposition of CZTS at the interface. This was done with the collection of high resolution core-line XPS spectra of Cu, Zn, Sn and S for different CZTS–Al2O3–TNR films prepared with variable number (x) of ALD (ALD-x, x = 0–10) cycles. In Fig. S7,† the XPS peak profiles of Cu 2p, Zn 2p and S 2p for different films (after subtracting the spectral baseline for better comparison) are shown to be very similar, meaning that having Al2O3 pre-deposited on TiO2 nanorods has no apparent interference on the loading amount of CZTS. However, the Sn content is decreasing dramatically (Fig. 6a) as the thickness of Al2O3 increases (Fig. S7†). To quantify this trend, we calculated the atomic ratio of Cu/Sn and Zn/Sn and plotted them with the change of ALD cycles in Fig. 6b and c, respectively, where a near linear increase of both Cu/Sn and Zn/Sn can be seen with the change in the thickness of Al2O3. In our recently published work on the TNR–CZTS film, the excess amount of Sn was attributed to the formation of SnO2 impurities.31 According to the results shown here the ALD of Al2O3 on TNRs before CZTS is deposited is an effective strategy in minimizing the occurrence of excess tin. Thus the resultant film is found to favor the formation of a near stoichiometric composition CZTS (Cu-poor Zn-rich) after 10 cycles of ALD as evident from the increasing Cu/Sn ratio from ∼0.6 to ∼1.5.

According to the information presented in the ESI,† the accumulation of the excess Sn on the CZTS–TNR interface is due to the high-temperature induced diffusion of Sn into the rutile nanorods (Fig. S9†) and not due to surface oxidation of CZTS as we had previously assumed.31 This was further validated by annealing pure TNRs under a Sn/S environment; this resulted in excess Sn reaching an O/Sn atomic ratio of ∼2.4, which can be explained by the substitution of Sn for Ti so as to give a near SnO2 stoichiometry (the same as TiO2).50–52 This unfavorable Sn doping was concluded to have introduced a defect state close to the conduction band bottom (Fig. S10†),53 acting as a trap center and having adversely affected the optoelectronic properties of TNRs (Fig. S11†). It was also found that SnO2 can only form on a bare TiO2 surface (Fig. S13†). The predeposited Al2O3 “nanoislands” contribute to minimizing the exposed area of TiO2 during thermal treatment and hence prevent the excess SnO2 formation as depicted in Fig. 6d. The detailed study on how Sn was accumulated in the first place and how Al2O3 helps prevent Sn from being incorporated in TNRs is provided in the ESI.†
After proving that atomic-layer deposited (ALD) Al2O3 is able to minimize the adverse Sn doping effect, we continued our investigation by examining its effect on the energy band alignment. In our previous work, the energy band alignment of CZTS–TNRs has already been studied via XPS31 and a type 2 alignment was revealed. It was pointed out that the conduction band (CB) bottom of TiO2 was too close to the valence band (VB) top of CZTS, explaining the cause of serious Voc deficit. To study the effect of Al2O3 in this regard, we calculated the valence band maximum (VBM) offset between CZTS and TNRs (ΔEVBM) according to the equation:54 ΔEVBM = (ECZTSCL − ECZTSVBM) − (ETNRCL − ETNRVBM) − ΔECL(6)
The valence band maximum (VBM) position of CZTS (ECZTSVBM) and TNRs (ETNRVBM) in reference to their Fermi energy levels was obtained by measuring the valance spectrum of individual CZTS and rutile nanorod films on FTO glass.31ECZTSCL and ETNRCL represent the core line energy value from Cu 2p3/2 and Ti 2p3/2 from the pure CZTS and TNR samples, respectively. ΔECL is the energy difference between Cu 2p3/2 (CZTS) and Ti 2p3/2 (TNR) core line spectra obtained from the CZTS–Al2O3–TNR composite sample on FTO glass with different cycles of ALD. The final calculated ΔEVBM was plotted as shown in Fig. 6e as function of the number of ALD cycles. An abrupt valence band offset drop of ∼0.13 eV is noticed after only one ALD cycle and it keeps decreasing afterwards but to a less extent. After 10 cycles of ALD treatment, the ΔEVBM has been reduced by ∼0.2 eV. The detailed method of band offset measurements can be found in ref. 31.
The bandgap of CZTS and TNRs was measured by light absorbance, which is further used to reveal the complete band alignment information as illustrated in Fig. 7. The solid lines represent the energy bands without ALD Al2O3 while the dashed lines represent the same after employing ALD Al2O3. Due to the reduced ΔEVBM, the CBM of CZTS and TNRs is getting closer which consequently enlarges the distance between the VBM of CZTS and the CBM of TNRs by 0.13–0.2 eV. As a result, Voc deficit should ideally also be reduced by 0.13–0.2 eV which perfectly agrees with improved Voc in the J–V characteristics determined in Fig. 2b. Therefore, the thin Al2O3 layer applied via ALD is beneficial in modifying the energy band alignment at the interface and to some extent solving the issue of significant Voc deficit.

Nanostructured CZTS–Al2O3–TNR solid-state solar cells with Spiro-OMeTAD
As is shown above nanoscale Al2O3 deposition by ALD has proven effective in reducing the adverse impact of SnO2 formation on one hand and on the other modifying the band alignment of the CZTS–TNR nanostructure leading to improved optoelectronic device performance. However, in the case of the assembled photovoltaic cells, the highest energy conversion efficiency was only ∼0.5%; this low efficiency was suspected to be due to poor interfacial layer contacting. To find the cause, SEM and EDS were then performed on the cross section of the TNR–Al2O3–CZTS–Au device and the results can been seen in Fig. S14.† The poor infiltration of gold via E-beam evaporation is seen as an obvious problem; as it fails to effectively collect the holes from all the light absorbing CZTS nanocrystallites. In our previous work a solid state electrolyte or hole transfer material (HTM) 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) has been applied to form an extremely thin absorber (ETA) solar cell structure55 which tends to have higher tolerance for defects and impurities.9 Therefore, Spiro-OMeTAD was selected in this work and spin-coated after the deposition/annealing of CZTS. The obtained devices were named “S ALD x” (where x is the number of ALD cycles performed to deposit Al2O3) of which the J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 8a and the extracted parameters in Table 3. It is clear that the incorporation of Spiro-OMeTAD has improved the solar cell efficiency of the cell. As can be deduced from the EDS map of carbon (Fig. S15b†) and the mixed maps with (Fig. S15c†) and without carbon (Fig. S15d†) taken from a cross section of the TNR–CZTS–Spiro-OMeTAD–Au device, the gold infiltration issue has been solved as in this case the HTM fills up the void space among the nanorods hence enabling a continuous, flat Au top layer to be formed. Clear morphological evidence can be found in Fig. S13e & f† where it can be seen the gaps of nanorods to have been filled up with Spiro-OMeTAD. This improved contact between CZTS/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au and the avoided direct contact between TNRs and Au contributes to the facilitated charge transfer process. Similar improvement after using Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM has been found in an earlier report by Jiang et al.33 A complete energy band diagram is presented in Fig. S16,† suggesting a facilitated hole extraction/transfer from CZTS to Spiro-OMeTAD. As such we conclude that the application of the HTM (Spiro-OMeTAD) is necessary for optimizing the functioning of this type of nanostructured solar cell.

Examining the J–V characteristics of devices built with variable number of Al2O3 interfacial layers (Fig. 8a and Table 3), it becomes evident that 4 cycles of ALD yield the highest device efficiency of ∼1.2%, thereafter efficiency decreases as the Al2O3 film gets thicker. Via open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements (Fig. 8c) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 8d) we sought to further evaluate the anti-recombination properties of the Al2O3 buffer layer by determining the electron lifetime. Raw data of the measurements are presented in Fig. S17.† The electron lifetime extracted from OCVD in Fig. 8c was determined using the same method as introduced in the previous context, which agrees well with the finding in Fig. 2d. This shows that as the Al2O3 layer becomes thicker the electron lifetime increases, causing the Voc for the devices from S ALD 0 to S ALD 10 to progressively increase. The charge transfer properties were also characterized using EIS according to a previous reported method.31,38 All devices were measured under dark conditions at different biases ranging from 0.1 V to 0.3 V. The simplified equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. S17† by introducing a constant phase element (CPE) instead of a capacitance element to better fit the non-ideal semicircles, which was used to extract the recombination resistances (Rrec) and the chemical capacitance (Cμ), and therefore, the electron lifetime (τ = RrecCμ) was calculated and is shown in Fig. 8d. It also showed ALD Al2O3 to effectively reduce charge recombination by extending the electron lifetime. A longer lifetime means that the generated photoelectrons can travel a farther distance before most of them were recombined with the remaining holes or defects induced traps, which correlates to the continuously increasing Voc in Fig. 8a. However, a longer electron lifetime does not always guarantee a better efficiency; a decline of photocurrent is observed after 6 cycles of ALD. It could be explained by the fact that Al2O3 deposition increased the charge transfer resistance that started to block the charge injection from the light absorber (CZTS) to the electron conductor (TiO2), which leads to overall energy conversion efficiency loss. A similar behaviour has been reported elsewhere.9 Therefore, either a too thin or too thick ALD buffer layer in this case was found not to be as effective pointing to the importance of precise control of the thickness of this interfacial layer for optimum results.
Interface engineering via successive deposition of Al2O3 and CdS layers
In a previous study, we reported how the introduction of a CdS passivation layer to the CZTS–TNR interface contributed to significant efficiency improvement from 0.7% to 2%.31 Based on this knowledge, we decided to apply a buffer layer of CdS on top of the ALD (6 cycles) Al2O3 layer. Three devices were built, the first (S1) one without any buffer (CdS or Al2O3) layer, the second (S2) one with only the CdS layer, and the third one (S3) incorporating both Al2O3 and CdS layers. The construction of the devices was completed with deposition of Spiro-OMeTAD and Au. The performance of the three devices (along with additional device configurations being described later) is shown in Fig. 9a and Table 4. A measurable difference can be seen between the Voc of S2 and S3, moreover, from the EIS and OCVD measurements reported in Fig. S18e & f† we can see that the recombination resistance (Rrec) and electron lifetime have been further increased by atomic layer deposition of Al2O3. This dual interfacial layer (Al2O3/CdS) has improved the energy conversion efficiency to 2.2% (S3).

However, this minor difference (2% vs. 2.2%) seems to indicate that a bottleneck has been reached. This was attributed to the relatively low amounts of CZTS coating that resulted in insufficient light absorption hence a low Jsc as noticed in our previous study.31 Therefore, we decided to increase the CZTS amount by performing four cycles instead of two cycles of spin-coating of the CZTS precursor and applying 250 °C/5 min baking in air after each cycle. The devices with four CZTS spin-coating cycles are labeled S4 (with no buffer layer), S5 (with a CdS buffer layer) and S6 (with both CdS and ALD Al2O3 (6 cycles) buffer layers) and compared. The J–V characteristics of devices S4–S6 are depicted in Fig. 9b. First, the TNR–CZTS device – without a buffer layer – with a thicker absorber material (S4) shows deterioration in terms of efficiency (0.08%) in comparison with that of the device S1 with two layers. This is thought to be caused by the greatly enlarged interface/defects and hence the much accelerated recombination rate. With the addition of the CdS layer (S5), the efficiency rises to 1.2% and further to 2.6% when both Al2O3 and CdS layers are applied (S6). This over 110% overall efficiency improvement indicates the vital contribution of Al2O3, especially in the case where a mere CdS buffer layer is not enough to suppress the much severe surface recombination as manifested by device S4. When comparing the S6 and S3 devices – both having the two buffer layers but different amounts of the light absorber CZTS material – we observe slight improvement in overall efficiency (from 2.2% to 2.6%) for the thicker CZTS photoanode that does not commensurate to the large increase in Jsc (12.1 mA cm−2 to 16.8 mA cm−2) because of the Voc and FF decrease. The EQE measurements in Fig. 9c and d confirm that the thicker CZTS photoanode can generate more photoelectrons corresponding to the higher Jsc value; this implies that further device optimization should be possible. However, EIS and OCVD analysis revealed a reduced Rrec (Fig. S18e†) and electron lifetime (Fig. S18f†) for the thicker CZTS photoanodes. This means that other strategies to boost efficiency need to be tried. This made us look into titanium oxide nanorods and the effect of annealing conditions as we had already optimized the deposition of CdS and Al2O3 by trying different combinations of conditions, obtaining the best results discussed above (S3 and S6) from 20 minutes of CBD for CdS and 6 cycles of ALD for Al2O3.
Improved PV efficiency with adjusted growth of TiO2 nanorods and annealing
In our previous work, different synthesis conditions of TNRs had been investigated but this was done only for liquid junction devices.31 Having adopted a solid state HTM and a new device configuration, we decided to further investigate the growth of TNRs as means of optimizing the all-solid-state device featuring an ALD Al2O3 interfacial layer. After having tried different combinations of reaction time and Ti(IV) precursor concentration, we selected six representative conditions to report in Table S1† and give their respective device performances in Fig. S19.† Of the different grown TNR films, the device S7 built with a lower Ti concentration (0.5 M) but a longer reaction time (10 h) shows the highest efficiency (3.6%) essentially because of its significantly increased Voc (0.37 V to 0.48 V) as can be seen in Fig. 10a and Table 4.
 Fig. 10  (a) J–V and (b) EQE characteristics of devices S6 and S7 (TNR–ALD 6c–CdS–CZTS 4L) differing in TNR growth conditions refer to Table S1† and their corresponding electron lifetime measured by (c) OCVD and (d) EIS. 
The EQE spectra in Fig. 10b show a slightly improved photon–electron conversion efficiency of S7 in the range of 500–850 nm, which is due to the increased light absorption (Fig. S20†) of the photoelectrode with different TiO2 nanorod geometries (Fig. S21†). The less dense nanorods in film S7 apparently can provide more nucleation points for CZTS, as we discovered in our previous work,31 along the meeting edge of neighbouring nanorod planes. It is also very likely that the deposition rate of CdS has accelerated due to the changed TNR geometry of S7, as it can be deduced from the lowered EQE observed at wavelengths of 420–460 nm apparently reflecting enhanced light absorption by CdS rather than CZTS. Alternatively the slightly blue shifted absorption edge in the near infrared region for S7 may also be attributed to the different Cd–CZTS ratios due to partial Cd substitution for Zn in CZTS during thermal treatment that is known to cause measurable variation of the absorber bandgap (1.36–1.54 eV).31,56 As a result, there is no net gain for the Jsc value in Fig. 10a.
The significantly enhanced Voc is attributed to the better electron conducting properties of the shorter and thinner nanorods in S7. Because we use a lower concentration of the initial reactant for a longer time, the nanorod grows at a slower rate and has the possibility to develop better crystallinity with fewer defects.57 OCVD and EIS were also applied (Fig. S22†). In Fig. 10c and d we clearly see the improvement of the electron lifetime for device S7, indicating a better anti-recombination mechanism with this adjusted TNR growth condition.
Having optimized the TNR substrate film, we studied the effect of different CZTS annealing conditions on the TNR-ALD 6c–CdS–CZTS photoanode. It was noticed that lowering the annealing temperature from 600 °C to 580 °C and shortening the annealing time from 30 min to 10 min is beneficial in realizing a better functioning device (S8) with improved energy conversion efficiency from 3.6% to 4.2% (average 4%) as can be seen in Fig. S23a† and Table 4. This improvement is due to the increase of the fill factor from 0.44 to 0.53 while the Voc and Jsc remain unchanged. According to the fitting results of EIS measurements, the series resistance (Rs) of S8 is much lower (∼20 Ω) compared to that of S7 (Fig. S23b†), which explains the enhanced fill factor and hence the improved efficiency. We think the higher Rs value of S7 is due to moderate damage to FTO glass because of the more aggressive annealing conditions (600 °C/30 min) as the coated glass is known to deform when exposed to temperatures above ∼550 °C for longer time.58
A comparison between the devices with (S8) and without (S9) Al2O3 deposition was made after all these optimizations to see the eventual effect of this interface engineering strategy. In Fig. 11 and Table 4, a significant efficiency decline (4.2% to 2.76%) can be observed after removing the Al2O3 layer which is due to the greatly enhanced interface recombination rate. This result has reconfirmed the importance of having the Al2O3 interface layer to the high performance nanostructured kesterite solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest value reported for kesterite based nanostructured (or superstrate) solid state solar cells – an alternative solution to kesterite thin film photovoltaics.31–33

Characterization of the solid state nanostructured solar cell
Here we subject a complete device to SEM and EDS cross sectional analysis in order to evaluate the interfacial spatial morphological and compositional profile of this multi-layer consisted nanostructured solar cell. In Fig. 12b and c we can see from the mixed EDS maps that the Spiro-OMeTAD (represented by carbon) has infiltrated into the nanostructure and a continuous, flat gold contact layer is formed on top, indicating the good charge transfer pathways. Also CdS and CZTS within the network are well mixed, but the former is located closer to TNRs as it is deposited before CZTS. More clear morphological information is revealed by the SE and BSE images in Fig. 12d and e which show that the vertically grown but slightly tilted TNR electron conductor are well coated using CdS/CZTS nanocrystallites.

The individual element EDS f-ratio maps are shown in Fig. 13 providing complete spatial compositional information for the device. Here the separation of Cu and Cd signals is clear while Sn is seen to overlap with Cu except for the bright blue layer that represents SnO2 in the FTO layer. However, Zn appears to have the same distribution with S rather than with either Cu or Sn, possibly indicating its diffusion into CdS from the CZTS precursor. This behavior can be explained by the formation of Cd1−xZnxS solid solution during thermal treatment, which will be beneficial here in view of its improved energy band alignment in comparison to pure CdS.45 Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that upon annealing other than the assumed earlier diffusion of Cd into the CZTS layer, the opposite i.e. diffusion of Zn into CdS has been proven to be able to optimize the conduction band offset (CBO) at the interface of CdS/CZTS; it is very likely to contribute to improving the photovoltaic performance.45,59,60 An in-depth study of the effect of Cd, Zn diffusion on this nanostructured interface is worth further investigation.

Conclusion
This work has demonstrated an effective interface engineering approach via atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 specifically applied to the Cu2ZnSnS4–TiO2 nanorod film interface, opening exciting possibilities to build high sensitivity photodetectors and high efficiency stable solid state nanostructured solar cells. The predeposition of Al2O3 on the TiO2 nanorod film leads to a significant EQEmax improvement from 7836% to 58558% for photodetectors at 4 V bias and the energy conversion efficiency increases from 0.04% to 0.54% for photovoltaic cells. Advanced characterization such as EDS f-ratio mapping and XANES are applied to prove the high purity and homogeneity of the CZTS absorber. Al2O3 predeposition is found to have effectively protected the rutile TiO2 surface from the adverse surface Sn doping effect. Moreover, valence and core-line XPS has determined the Al2O3 layer to have enlarged the valence band offset by 0.13–0.2 eV, which contributes to improved Voc. After introducing Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transfer material (HTM) and CdS as the co-passivation layer, a solid state solar cell of 4.2% energy conversion efficiency was fabricated with adjusted TiO2 nanorod growth and annealing conditions. This comprehensive study of interface engineering provides new insights into complex nanostructured multi-layer film interfaces for the development of novel optoelectronic devices.
