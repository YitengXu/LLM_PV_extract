1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs)1–14 based on semiconducting small molecules and polymers offer a promising option to meet the increasing demand of our society for clean, renewable and affordable energy sources. Compared to commercialized silicon solar cells, OSCs exhibit the advantages of solution processability to enable large-scale roll-to-roll fabrication, mechanical flexibility, potential low cost, and synthetic variety.
In OSCs, the active layer sandwiched between two electrodes normally consists of two distinct components: an electron donor (D) and an electron acceptor (A). The morphology of this active layer plays a critical role in determining the device efficiency. The concept of donor–acceptor (D–A) bilayer planar heterojunction was first applied by Tang15 to OSCs, and a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1% was achieved using copper phthalocyanine and a perylene tetracarboxylic derivative. The major limitation of a planar bilayer heterojunction, however, is the relatively small D–A interface area and the requirement of long charge-carrier lifetime to ensure that electrons and holes reach their respective electrodes.
An elegant approach to this problem lies in the discovery of interpenetrating D–A networks, termed bulk heterojunctions (BHJs).1,2 The active layer of most BHJs is composed of a conjugated polymer1,2,6,12 or small molecule9,10,16–22 as the electron donor, randomly blended with an electron acceptor1,2,23–29 such as fullerene derivatives. It is widely believed that, upon light irradiation, excitons mainly produced in the donor phase migrate to the D–A interface where the excitons are dissociated into charge carriers that then migrate in opposite directions to the electrodes30–34 (Fig. 1A). The PCE of polymer–fullerene BHJ solar cells has been significantly improved in the past decade, thanks to the rapid advances in both materials synthesis, particularly the exploration of new low-bandgap polymers, and processing optimization for device fabrication.35–45 Very recently, Yang and co-workers reported a PCE of 8.62%,40 which has been further improved to 10.6%,11 in tandem polymer–fullerene BHJ solar cells featuring a spectrally matched low-bandgap conjugated polymer, poly{2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene-alt-5-dibutyloctyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione} (PBDTT-DPP). Several challenges, nevertheless, still remain to be addressed in order to make OSCs competitive compared to their inorganic counterparts. For example, current device fabrication of BHJs via solution processing commonly results in irregular morphologies that strongly depend on the processing conditions and molecular structures.35,41,46–50 As a consequence, intensive optimization of device fabrication is needed for each newly developed material to maximize the potential for high power conversion efficiency.

To overcome the limitations of morphological control in BHJs, an ideal interdigitated D–A heterojunction (Fig. 1B) has been proposed.3,46,49 In this device architecture, the two phases of donor and acceptor within the bulk heterojunction are interspaced on a length scale of the exciton diffusion length (∼10 nm). This ideal phase separation is expected to provide transport “highways” for both p-type and n-type charge carriers to electrodes, without sacrificing the D–A interfacial contact.
In this article, we summarize recent progress on both “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches towards organized BHJs in order to improve the efficiency of OSCs. The first part includes the “bottom-up” strategy of molecular design, synthesis and self-assembly of linked D–A molecules and block copolymers which serve as a single material for OSCs. The second part overviews recent top-down approaches toward long-range ordered D–A heterojunctions. This review article does not cover the progress on nanostructured organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells, an interesting topic that has been discussed in several excellent review papers.46,51–53
2. Bottom-up self-assembly of D–A small molecules and block copolymers
Different from physical blends of D–A molecules, covalently or noncovalently linked D–A molecules are expected to ease the control of the D–A interface and the phase separation into ideally long-range ordered heterojunctions. To date, a myriad of D–A molecules has been synthesized and the photoinduced charge/energy transferred has been intensively studied.54,55 In this section, we highlight the recent advances in molecular design, synthesis and assembly of D–A molecules and block copolymers. We focus on the strategies for molecular design that lead to long-range ordered segregated packing of D–A moieties and how such self-assembly leads to photoinduced energy/charge transfer that is favorable for improving the efficiency of OSCs.
2.1 Nonfullerene D–A small molecules and oligomers

2.1.1 Linear D–A dyads. 
The simplest structure of D–A molecules is a dyad in which an aromatic donor is linked to an aromatic acceptor mostly through a covalent bond. The self-assembly of D–A dyads leads to two types of stacking structures shown in Fig. 2A, depending on a compromise of multiple interactions, such as π–π interactions of D–D and A–A, charge transfer interactions of D–A and van der Waals interaction of side chains that help to improve the solubility of the molecules. For example, when the π–π interactions of D–D and A–A dominate, segregated D–D/A–A packing (Model a) will be obtained. In contrast, when the charge transfer interaction of D–A dominates, D–A alternating stacks (Model b) are expected. The alternating stacks, through efficient electron transfer, generate large dipoles that trap the charge carriers and impede charge transport. Only the segregated stacks provide charge transport channels in the bulk states, which is a prerequisite for their application in thin-film electronic devices.56 Therefore, it is important to design molecules that prefer to pack in Model a.
 Fig. 2  (A) Schematic representation of D–D/A–A segregated stacking (a) and D–A alternative stacking (b) formed by D–A dyads. (B) Molecular structures of several representative D–A dyads based on HBC and perylene derivatives. 
Müllen and co-workers57,58 have synthesized a series of D–A dyads composed of hexa-peri-benzocoronenes (HBC) that are covalently linked to perylene monoimides (PMI) or perylene diimides (PDI) (Fig. 2B). The self-assembly of these dyads on graphite at the solid–liquid interface has been studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). It was demonstrated that the linkage at the D–A interface is important, not only for intermolecular assembly, but also for the electronic coupling between D–A units. For example, dyad 1 in which HBC is linked to PMI with a single bond did not intermolecularly stack on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), as evidenced by STM, probably due to the phenyl–phenyl induced twist at the D–A joint.57 In contrast to 1, ethylene-bridged dyad 2, with a similar molecular structure, showed clear segregated packing both on the surface of HOPG and in bulk solid state, resulting in uniform mesoscopic ribbons, networks of nanofibers and ordered monolayers at the solution–graphite interface.58 In addition, electrical measurements of 2 in a transistor configuration showed ambipolar characteristics and, compared with a thin-film architecture, improved charge-carrier mobility on the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 in the highly ordered ribbons.58
Recently, Doessel et al.56 reported the synthesis and self-assembly of a series of HBC–PDI dyads (3 and 4) covalently linked by a rigid bridge. Intermolecular D–A charge-transfer interactions were found to be the dominant forces for phase separation and self-organization, leading to alternating stacks of HBC and PDI both in bulk and in solution. Despite the presence of sterically demanding alkyl chains on the periphery of HBC, both 3 and 4 showed limited solubility in common organic solvents, prohibiting their use in solution-processed devices such as field effect transistors (FETs) and OSCs.
To promote the formation of segregated D–D/A–A stacks in D–A dyads, Aida and co-workers59,60 have studied a series of amphiphilic D–A dyads appended with asymmetric solubilizing chains. For example, a trinitrofluorenone-appended gemini-shaped amphiphilic HBC derivative (5a) was synthesized (Fig. 3). The self-assembly of 5a in solution leads to the formation of nanotubes, which are 16 nm in diameter and several micrometers in length.59 The nanotubes consist of a molecular layer of electron-accepting trinitrofluorenone laminates, an electron-donating graphitic layer of π-stacked HBC. The coaxial nanotubular structure allows the photochemical generation of spatially separated charge carriers. Further analysis of these coaxial nanotubes by flash-photolysis time resolved microwave conductivity (FP-TRMC) gives a maximum transient photoconductivity of 13 μS m−1 in 0.11 μs upon exposure to a 355 nm laser pulse. In sharp contrast, the microfibers consist of a charge-transfer complex between the HBC and trinitrofluorenone parts and exhibit almost no photocurrent generation.

Li et al.60 used the same strategy of side-chain incompatibility to tailor organic p/n heterojunctions of oligothiophene–PDI dyads (6a,b) with molecular-level precision (Fig. 4). Dyad 6a with triethylene glycol side chains at one terminus and dodecyl side chains at the other, self-assembles into nanofibers with a long-range D–A heterojunction. In contrast, the self-assembly of 6b modified with dodecyl side chains at both termini leads to the formation of ill-defined microfibers. FP-TRMC measurements of the nanofiber formed by 6a, upon exposure to a 355 nm laser pulse, gives a maximum transient photoconductivity of 6.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, which is five-fold higher than that observed in a cast film of the microfibrous assembly formed by 6b.

2.1.2 Oligomeric D–A dyads. 
Geng and co-workers61 reported the self-assembly and photovoltaic performances of a series of oligomeric D–A dyads (7a–c) in which oligo(fluorene-alt-bithiophene)s serve as the donor and PDI as the acceptor (Fig. 5). All of these dyads formed long-range ordered alternating D–A lamellar nanostructures in thin films, as characterized by both small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, these thin films were examined in a solar cell device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (50 nm)/co-oligomers (70 nm)/epPDI (3 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm), in which epPDI (N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxyl diimide) was used as a hole-blocking layer. It was found that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases with the increase of the length of oligo(fluorene-alt-bithiophene)s and a PCE up to 1.5% was reported for 7c.

2.1.3 A–D–A or D–A–D triads. 
More complex molecular structures such as A–D–A and D–A–D have been synthesized (Fig. 6). For example, the PMI–HBC–PMI triad 8 self-assembles into parallel segregated D–A arrays at the liquid/graphite interface,57 whereas the self-assembly of triad 9 in solid state resulted in columnar structures consisting of alternating HBC and PDI units.56 The charge transfer interactions between the HBC and PDI units in 9 were further elucidated by a charge-transfer emission band at 650–800 nm, which is more pronounced in solid state than in solution.
 Fig. 6  (A) Schematic representation of segregated stacking of D–A–D triads. (B–E) Molecular structures of A–D–A triads 8, 9 and D–A–D triads 10, 11. 
Janssen and co-workers62,63 carried out comparative studies on hydrogen-bonded versus covalently linked D–A–D molecules (10 and 11) consisting of a central PDI as the acceptor moiety and two oligo(p-phenylene-vinylene) (OlPV) as the donor units. Both 10a and 11 form well-ordered J-type aggregates in methylcyclohexane, but only hydrogen-bonded arrays afford hierarchically assembled chiral superstructures consisting of left-handed helical π–π co-aggregates of the two dyes that further assemble into right-handed nanometer-scale supercoils in the solid state.62
For the covalently linked OlPV–PDI–OlPV molecules (10), both face-to-face (H-type) and slipped (J-type) stacking, depending on the bay-substituents of PDI, of the OlPV and PDI chromophores were identified from the absorption spectra in solution.63 For the J-type aggregates, short intermolecular OlPV–PDI distances give rise to a charge-transfer absorption band. The proximity of the donor and acceptor groups in the J-type aggregates enables highly efficient photoinduced charge separation with a rate (kcs > 1012 s−1) that significantly exceeds the rate of the intramolecular charge transfer of the same compounds when molecularly dissolved, even in the most polar media. In the H-type aggregates, on the other hand, the intermolecular OlPV–PDI distance is not reduced compared to the intramolecular separation, and hence, the rates of the electron transfer reactions are not significantly affected compared to the molecular dissolved state. Attempts to incorporate 10 in a photovoltaic device, however, were not successful since the device exhibited little or no photovoltaic effect.64 This may be a consequence of too small domain sizes or the wrong alignment with respect to electrodes.


2.1.4 Star-shaped D–A molecules. 
Wasielewski et al.65 studied self-assembly and photoinduced charge transport in a star-like D–A molecule (12) in which four perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxydiimide (PDI) molecules that both collect photons and accept electrons are attached to a central zinc 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) as the electron donor (Fig. 7). This molecule self-assembles into ordered nanoparticles in solution and in the solid-state, driven by van der Waals stacking of the PDI molecules. Photoexcitation of the nanoparticles results in quantitative charge separation in 3.2 ps to form ZnTPP+PDI− radical ion pairs. Despite the efficient photoinduced electron transfer observed in 12, no photovoltaic devices involving 12 as the active layer were reported.
 Fig. 7  Molecular structures of star-shaped D–A molecules 12, 13. 
Recently, Müllen and co-workers56 synthesized a star-shaped D–A molecule (13) with an HBC moiety as the core on which six PDI units are attached (Fig. 7). The adsorption of 13 onto Au(111) surfaces from dilute solutions in 1-phenyloctane and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene results in well-defined circular aggregates consisting of the HBC in the center and 12 surrounding PDI moieties, as revealed by STM. The investigation of 13 in the solid state by X-ray scattering techniques revealed the formation of nanoscale-segregated columnar stacks that were arranged in a hexagonal lattice, in contrast to the predominant formation of alternating stacks in linear dyads (3 and 4). Optical characterizations of 13 show Förster-type resonance energy transfer (presumably intramolecular) from the HBC to the PDI units. Nevertheless, photoinduced electron transfer between HBC and PDI, the essential prerequisite for an organic BHJ solar cell, did not occur within the aggregates of 13, regardless of whether the donor or the acceptor was excited.

2.2 Fullerene-based D–A small molecules
Fullerenes and their derivatives, due to their unique optoelectronic properties such as high electron affinity, small reorganization energy and superior ability for electron transport, have been extensively used in OSCs.3,4,11,24,35,40–43,48,66–69 To date, 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)23 and its C70 analogue PC71BM are the most widely used acceptors for state-of-the-art OSCs. In 2005, Segura, Martín and Guldi54 wrote a comprehensive review on the advances in fullerene/π-conjugated oligomer D–A ensembles, covering topics from molecular design/synthesis to a photophysical understanding of the interfacial energy/charge transfer to photovoltaic devices.
In this section, we present only the recent progress of fullerene-based D–A molecules to illustrate how molecular design leads to long-range ordered D–A self-assembly, and how the self-assembly determines the interfacial photophysics that is critical to improving the efficiency of OSCs.

2.2.1 Fullerene-based dyads. 
The fact that PCBM has been the most widely used acceptor in OSCs has inspired the design and synthesis of PCBM-derived D–A molecules in which π-conjugated donor molecules can be covalently linked to the PCBA (acid, instead of methyl ester) through an esterification reaction. The Hashimoto group70–72 reported a series of PCBM-derived dyads and their performances in single-component solar cell devices (Fig. 8). For example, an oligothiophene/C60 dyad (14) was synthesized and characterized.70 Measurement of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the fullerene-free oligothiophene derivative was liquid crystalline. However, this liquid crystalline behavior disappeared in 14, suggesting that the covalent linkage to the fullerene suppressed the liquid-crystalline ordering of 14 in the solid state. Nevertheless, the locally ordered fibrillar domains of 14 in the thermally annealed film were revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Photovoltaic devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/14/Al showed Isc = 0.93 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.70 V, FF = 0.23, resulting in a PCE of 0.15%. One of the possible factors that led to such low photovoltaic performance is the inefficient charge transport in the films because of unsuitable molecular packing of the oligothiophene and/or the fullerene groups.
 Fig. 8  Molecular structures of fullerene-based dyads 14–17. 
This situation was improved in another dyad, 15, with the same fullerene group as the acceptor but with the strong π–π interactions of the OlPV derivative that enhances charge-carrier transport, resulting in a PCE of 1.28%.71 As one step further, the same research group reported a series of low-band-gap dyad molecules (16a–c), each of which consists of a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-oligothiophene derivative as the donor and a fullerene group as the acceptor.72 As the number of thiophene units increased from 4 (16a) to 8 (16c), continuous red-shifts of the absorption edges were observed due to the increased conjugation length in the donor part. Solar cell devices were fabricated with a simple configuration of ITO/dyad/Ca (20 nm)/Al (30 nm). The device with 16c, among all of the dyads of 16a–c, showed the highest PCE (1.11%), with Isc = 4.79 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.51 V, FF = 0.46. No device results were reported with 16a–c as “surfactant” to tune the morphology, enhance exciton dissociation and enhance the thermal stability of the BHJ solar cells.
Recently we reported a dyad of PCBM disperse-red ester (17) that strongly absorbs light in the range of 400–600 nm, which is complementary to the light absorption of fullerenes in the UV range.7317 showed advantages over PCBM in several aspects such as enhanced visible-light absorption, improved solubility, and the possibility to facilitate cascaded electron transfer. Similar to fullerene-based dyads, nevertheless, 17-based single-component photovoltaic devices gave poor PCEs due to the limited hole-transporting ability of 17 in films. In addition, we found that P3HT:17 BHJ solar cells did not outperform P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells under similar conditions. Among the factors that affect the efficiency of P3HT:17 BHJ solar cells, the suppression of interchain interactions of P3HT in the P3HT:17 blend played a major role, presumably due to better interfacial miscibility between P3HT and 17 than in blends of P3HT:PCBM. In contrast, benzoporphyrin (BP), due to its unique crystallinity, morphology and nonsolubility, afforded better control of the morphology and the interface of the p/n junctions. As a consequence, the performance of solar cells with BP/17 as the active layer was comparable to that of BP/PCBM solar cells. These results suggest that a synergistic approach of synthetic design and morphological control in devices is critical for developing new electron acceptors for highly efficient OSCs.
Aida and co-workers74 have synthesized a series of amphiphilic fullerene-based D–A molecules (Fig. 9). For instance, an amphiphilic oligothiophene–C60 dyad (18b) forms a liquid-crystalline smectic phase over a wide range of temperatures from 136 to 180 °C. In comparison to a lipophilic reference dyad (18a), the site-specific modification of the D–A dyad 18b with hydrophilic and paraffinic wedges not only prohibits D–A interactions that lead to the trapping of charge carriers, but also promotes favorable segregated D–D/A–A stacking which provides long-range conducting pathways for charge carriers in the materials (Fig. 9A). FP-TRMC measurements of 18b in the liquid crystalline phase, upon exposure to a 355 nm laser pulse, gave a maximum transient photoconductivity of 4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, which is comparable to that (3.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1) of 18a. However, the lifetime of the photoinduced charge carrier generated in the liquid crystalline phase of 18b is longer than that in 18a, although the detailed values for the lifetimes were not given.

Very recently, Charvet et al.75 reported amphiphilic zinc porphyrin–C60 dyads, bearing an identical hydrophilic wedge with triethylene glycol chains but different linkers between the zinc porphyrin and C60 units (Fig. 9B). 19a with an ester linker self-assembles into nanotubes in a mixture of methanol–toluene (1.8:1, v/v). Each of the nanotubes consists of a bilayer wall formed with coaxially segregated D and A nanodomains along the tube axis (coaxial D–A heterojunction). In contrast, the nanotube from dyad 19b with a rigid arylacetylene linker consists of a monolayer wall with an alternate geometry of D–A stacking. The FP-TMRC measurements for these coaxial nanotubes formed by 19a, upon exposure to a 355 nm laser pulse, gave a maximum photoconductivity of 1.02 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1, which is 6.5 times higher than that (1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1) of the monolayer nanotubes formed by 19b. In addition, the measurement of the charge-carrier mobility of the nanotubes formed by 19a in FET devices showed balanced electron and hole mobility with a value of ∼1.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1, at a field of 3.6 × 104 V−1m−1.
Charvet et al.75 also attempted to make photovolatic devices from the coaxial nanotubes formed by 19a. However, the conventional top-contact configuration of the photovoltaic devices was not applicable because of the parallel alignment of these nanotubes with respect to the substrates and the fact that the nanotubes, upon drop casting, did not form a pinhole-free homogeneous film. As a consequence, photovoltaic characterization was carried out using a special device configuration analogous to FET, where the film samples were allowed to horizontally bridge two distinct electrodes: one is PEDOT:PSS/Au/Ti, and the other is TiOx/Ti/Al. Although the PCE could not be quantified because of the special device configuration, the device with nanotubes of 19a showed significantly higher Jsc and Voc than that of the device with nanotubes of 19b. These results, together with the difference in charge-carrier mobility described above, clearly indicate that D–D/A–A segregated packing promotes charge-carrier generation and transport in devices.
In all of the fullerene-based D–A molecules described above, the donor is either a small molecule or an oligomer. Recently, a polymeric D–A dyad (20) consisting of a regioregular P3HT terminated at one end by a PCBM ester moiety was independently reported by the Jo group77 and the Wudl group.76 The latter found that self-assembly of 20 results in nanostructures with well-defined donor–acceptor interfaces.77 (Fig. 10) For example, 20 in THF solution forms spherical aggregates in which the methanofullerene moieties aggregate in the micelle core stabilized by P3HT chains that extend to the solvent medium (Fig. 10B and D). Ultrafast transient absorption experiments of these micellar aggregates in THF revealed that the origin of the photoluminescence (PL) quenching is excitation energy transfer from the P3HT donor to the PCBM acceptor.78 In contrast to solution, quantitative and ultrafast (<150 fs) charge separation occurs in the THF-cast films of 20, and leads to the formation of long-lived mobile charge carriers with characteristic transient absorption signatures similar to those that have been observed in P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction blends.

In contrast to the spherical aggregates formed in THF, thin films of 20 drop-cast from o-DCB solution form fibrous structures with a uniform diameter of 15–20 nm and varying lengths up to micrometers. In these fibrous structures, P3HT chains crystallize to form the core which is surrounded by a monolayer of C60 moieties (Fig. 10C and E). Transient absorption experiments show fast loss of charge carriers due to the intensity-induced recombination/annihilation processes and monomolecular interfacial trap-mediated or geminate recombination. The yield of the long-lived charge carriers in the highly organized fibers is, however, comparable to that obtained with annealed P3HT:PCBM blends.78
Further investigation of 20 in thin films using photoconductive atomic force microscopy indicates that the nanofibers showed significantly higher photocurrent than the nanospheres79 (Fig. 10E). These results provide direct evidence at the nanoscale level of how the structure and morphology of the polymer/fullerene interface determines the photoinduced charge generation and the subsequent charge migration to electrodes.


2.2.2 Fullerene-based triads. 
A series of fullerene-based A–D–A molecules has also been synthesized (Fig. 11). Karsten et al.80 reported the synthesis and photophysics of a series of small-band-gap thiophene–thienopyrazine oligomers capped at both ends with C60 (21). Femtosecond photoinduced absorption spectroscopy revealed a photoinduced electron transfer reaction between the oligomer as the donor and the fullerene as the acceptor in 21 dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene or toluene. But the performance of this molecule in organic solar cells was not reported.
 Fig. 11  Molecular structures of C60–donor–C60 triads 21–25. 
Wong et al.81 reported the synthesis and characterization of a C60–HBC–C60 triad (22) and its use as a single-component active material in OSCs. The photovoltaic device in the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/22/TiOx/Al showed a PCE of 0.15%, with Isc = 0.80 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.90 V, FF = 0.21, under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination. The relatively low FF can be attributed to the poor charge carrier mobility (at a magnitude of 10−7 cm2 V−1 S−1) for both electrons and holes in the film of 22, as measured in FET devices. In addition, the Isc was partially limited by the narrow absorption of light in the visible range (<450 nm). Interestingly, a control compound of the C60–HBC dyad showed one order of magnitude higher charge carrier mobility and higher PCE (0.22%) than 22.
Considering the fact that DPP derivatives have shown promising performance as electron donors in BHJ organic solar cells,9 Wudl's group recently synthesized two A–D–A molecules (23a,b),82 each of which consists of a 3,6-dithien-2-yl-2,5-dialkylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DTDPP) covalently linked at the nitrogen positions to a couple of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid ester (PCB) units through alkyl chains of different lengths. Femtosecond-resolved transient absorption measurements of 23a,b in o-dichlorobenzene revealed highly efficient excitation energy transfer from the DTDPP to the PCB moieties. Similar fast energy transfer from lower-band-gap DPP-oligothiophene to PCB was observed by Karsten et al.83 in solutions of triads 24a–c. It should be noted that all of these spectroscopic studies were carried out in dilute solutions where the intermolecular interaction is minimal. Further studies in solid state, in which competitive photoinduced charge transfer is possible, are needed in the future.
Chen et al.84 systematically examined the performances of triads 24a–c as either a single-component or an acceptor in BHJ solar cells. Single-component solar cells with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/triads/Al showed a PCE up to 0.5% for 24a with the shortest alkyl linker between the donor and the acceptor, while the PCE for 24b,c with a longer alkyl linker was lower. The device performance was mainly limited by the low Jsc and poor FF (0.2–0.3). To reveal factors that affect the photovoltaic performances of these triads, the charge transport properties were characterized in FET devices. These three triads (24a–c) showed n-type transport characteristics and 24a showed the highest electron mobility of 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1. These results suggest that the photovoltaic performances of 24a–c were mainly limited by the hole mobility of these molecules in the solid state. As a consequence, the BHJ solar cells using 24a as the acceptor and P3HT as the donor showed significantly improved PCE up to 2.40%, while the PCE was lower when 24b or 24c was the acceptor. Nevertheless, the PCE of the P3HT/24a device was still lower than that of the P3HT/PCBM device under similar conditions.
The limited hole mobility in thin films of most fullerene-based D–A and A–D–A small molecules is presumably related to the differences in the geometries and packing model between the donors (mainly π-conjugated molecules) and fullerenes. Firstly, fullerenes, particularly C60, are highly symmetric molecules, leading to isotropic charge transport in films wherever they contact each other. In contrast to fullerenes, π–π stacking as the major pathway for charge-carrier transport is highly anisotropic in most π-conjugated molecules. As a consequence, the alignment of the π–π stacking in films plays an important role in determining the charge carrier mobility.85 Secondly, the center-to-center distance of closely packed C60 is ca. 10.5 Å, which is three times that of the typical face-to-face π–π stacking distances (3.5 Å)86 (Fig. 12). This stacking difference may interfere with the π–π stacking that is essential to maintain the charge transport pathways in π-conjugated molecules.
 Fig. 12  Schematic representation of the stacking in C60–donor–C60 triads. 
Boudouris et al.87 reported a polymeric A–D–A molecule (25, Fig. 11) consisting of a regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) that is terminated at both ends with methylfulleropyrrolidines. While the photoluminescence of P3HT was efficiently quenched in a solution of 25, the charge transport and photovoltaic properties of this molecule were not reported. In addition, the molecular structure of 25 was not well-defined because of chain coupling during the reaction of CHO–P3HT–CHO with N-methylglycine and C60. Further improvement of the synthesis to obtain structurally well-defined C60–P3HT–C60 is needed in future in order to fully explore the potential of such A–D–A polymers for solar cell applications.

2.3 D–A block copolymers
Block copolymers, two chemically distinct polymers joined together at one end, self-assemble into a variety of periodic ordered nanoscale structures.88–91 As a consequence, block copolymer self-assembly has been expected to achieve control of the active layer morphologies of polymer photovoltaic devices.92,93 Ideally, block copolymers consisting of segmented donor and acceptor blocks, by solution processing, would spontaneously form phase separated lamellae or cylindrical ordered structures perpendicular to the electrodes, as shown in Fig. 13.86

2.3.1 Fullerene-baring block copolymers. 
As the most common approach to such D–A block copolymers, semiconducting polymers such as poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and P3HT as the electron-donating units are covalently linked to a second polymer with pendant electron-accepting units, such as derivatives of fullerenes and PDI (Fig. 14). For example, Hadziioannou and co-workers94 synthesized a D–A block copolymer (26) consisting of rigid rod block of PPV and a second block of C60-appended polystyrene. The PL of PPV is strongly quenched in a spin-cast film of 26, suggesting efficient electron transfer from PPV to C60. Furthermore, the photovoltaic performance of 26 as a single component of the active layer was examined in a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/26/Al,95 giving Isc of 5.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.52 V, FF of 0.23 and PCE of 0.69% under monochromatic illumination of 1 mW cm2 at 458 nm. In contrast to the device of 26, the photovoltaic device with a blend of homopolymer of PPV and a statistic copolymer of poly(styrene-stat-C60-methylstyrene) as the active layer showed a much lower PCE (0.02%).
 Fig. 14  Molecular structures of fullerene-bearing D–A block copolymers 26–31. 
Fréchet and co-workers96 reported the synthesis of a D–A diblock copolymer (27) based on ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and the use of 27 as a compatibilizer to stabilize the morphology of P3HT/PCBM BHJ solar cells. Nevertheless, neither the self-assembly of 27 nor its photovoltaic performance in single-component active layer solar cells was reported.
Following a similar synthetic strategy of ROMP, Charvet et al.97 synthesized a series of diblock copolymers consisting of polynorbornenes as the backbones with pendant zinc porphyrins in one block and pendant C60 moieties in the other. Uniform nanofibers were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in the films of 28 cast from chloroform. Interestingly, high-resolution TEM reveals that each of these nanofibers is composed of regularly alternating domains perpendicular to the long axes of the fibers. The photoconductivity of these nanofibers was measured by FP-TRMC, and the charge transport properties were measured by the current-mode time-of-flight (TOF) technique. However, the performance of 28 in solar cell devices was not reported.
Yang et al.98 reported the synthesis of a well-defined rod–coil block copolymer (29) consisting of a block of regioregular P3HT as the donor and a second block with pendant fullerenes as the acceptor. In a pristine film of 29 cast from chlorobenzene, long fibrillar nanostructures were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Moreover, the use of 29 as a “surfactant” to tune the morphology of P3HT/PCBM BHJ solar cells resulted in ca. 35% improved efficiency compared to the P3HT/PCBM device without the “surfactant”. Later on, Jo and co-workers99 reported a similar P3HT-C60 diblock copolymer (30) and its application to improve the thermal stability of P3HT/PCBM BHJ solar cells.
In all of the D–A diblock copolymers (26–30) described above, the backbone of the block containing pendant fullerenes is non-conjugated, which may limit the charge transport pathways in devices. To this end, Hashimoto and co-workers100 reported the synthesis of a fullerene-grafted diblock copolymer (31) with an all-conjugated backbone of polythiophene and its use in single component polymer solar cells. In their synthesis, diblock copolymers of 3-hexylthiophene and 3-(6-bromohexyl)thiophene were prepared first by Ni-catalyzed chain-growth polymerization. Then the bromides in the side chains of the polymers were quantitatively converted to azides by NaN3. Finally PCBM–alkyne esters were allowed to react with the pendant azides through a Cu-catalyzed cycloaddition reaction. The results of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of 31 showed multimodal peaks. The peak corresponding to a higher molecular weight than that of the polymer precursor suggests cross coupling or aggregation in the final step reaction. The film of 31 showed worm-like structures with higher ordering than the film of the random copolymer of P3HT with pendant fullerenes. Solar cell devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/31/Al, after thermal annealing at 130 °C for 40 min, showed a PCE of 1.70%, with Isc of 6.15 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.54 V, and FF of 0.51. Little change of the PCE was observed after the device was annealed at 130 °C for 80 h.
The results above indicate that the strategy for the D–A block copolymer is efficient to improve the thermal stability of the polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells. Nevertheless, the solar cells involving the D–A block copolymer as a single component of the active layer have all shown less competitive PCEs compared to the state-of-the-art physically blended polymer/fullerene solar cells but use of these diblock polymers as compatibilizers (surfactants) appears to somewhat improve the PCE and thermal stability of the devices.


2.3.2 Non-fullerene D–A block copolymers. 
Non-fullerene electron-accepting molecules have also been incorporated into D–A block copolymers. To date the most widely used non-fullerene acceptors have been derivatives of perylene bisdiimides (PDI), due to their relatively high electron affinity, good electron mobility and strong absorption of visible light (Fig. 15). The Thelakkat group101,102 reported a block copolymer 32 consisting of a poly(vinyltriphenylamine) as the hole-transporting block and a polyacrylate with pendant PDI derivatives as the electron-transporting block. The solar cell device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/32/Al showed a PCE of 0.07%. Such poor performance is partially related to the nonideal phase separation of 32 in the active layer, in which isolated hole-transporting domains were observed using cross-sectional TEM. Further molecular variations of triphenylamine led to improved morphologies of such D–A block copolymers in the active layer of the solar cell devices, thus resulting in an increase of the PCE up to 0.32%.103 Later, the same research group104 and several others105–107 reported double-crystalline D–A block copolymers (33–36) consisting of a hole-transporting block of P3HT and an electron-transporting block of PDI-pendant polyacrylates.
 Fig. 15  Molecular structures of non-fullerene D–A block copolymers 32–36. 
Sommer et al.108 studied the influence of the molecular weight of 33 on the performance of polymer solar cells in a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/33/Al. It was found that a higher molecular weight of 33 (corresponding to a longer chain of P3HT) leads to a larger degree of P3HT crystallinity and larger P3HT crystals, which are beneficial for charge percolation and enhance the external quantum efficiency of the devices. The photovoltaic devices of 33 with a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 29.5 kg mol−1 showed a PCE of 0.2%, which doubles the PCE of the block copolymer with a Mn of 16.1 kg mol−1.
Rajaram et al.106 found that 34 acts as a compatibilizer which helps in controlling the large-scale phase separation within the blends of P3HT and PDI. The optimized solar cell device of P3HT/PDI blends in the presence of 34 showed a PCE of 0.55%, which is slightly higher than the PCE (0.37%) of the device without the compatibilizer.
Zhang et al.105 reported the synthesis of a block copolymer 35 with a very similar structure to that of 34. Thin films of 35 (Mn = 13.6 kg mol−1) after solvent annealing in the vapor of a mixture of toluene–chloroform (1:1, v/v) showed fibrillar structures of 25 nm in diameter and microns in length. Photovoltaic devices with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/35/LiF/Al showed a PCE of 0.49%. Similar fibrillar nanostructures were observed by Tao et al.107 in another block copolymer 36 which also showed a low PCE (0.01–0.03%) in single-component active layer solar cell devices. Such a poor performance was attributed to the misorientation of the fibrillar nanostructures with their long axes parallel to the electrodes, limiting the vertical charge transport to the electrodes.
Recently, Lee et al.109 reported the formation of vertical conducting nanodomains in thin films of a rod–coil block copolymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (37), with a P3HT molecular weight of 11 kDa and a PMMA volume fraction of 0.53. It was found that the orientation of the P3HT domains is strongly related to the thickness of the polymer film. When the film thickness is less than 30 nm, the minor P3HT phases form vertically standing nanodomains with hexagonal packing. Moreover, the conformation of the P3HT segments was mostly “face-on” (Fig. 16B–D) on the piranha-treated SiO2/Si substrate. Such “face-on” conformation110 (Fig. 17), favoring vertical charge transport in solar cell devices, is very different from that of regioregular P3HT homopolymers, which typically show “edge-on” conformation on flat substrates.111 When the film thickness is larger than 50 nm, the same block copolymer forms fibrillar nanostructures consisting of laterally π-stacked P3HT chains. In addition, the analysis of an 80 nm thick film using grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) showed a majority of “edge-on” conformation of the P3HT segments. The vertically standing nanodomains of π-conjugated molecules and polymers with “face-on” molecular conformations on substrates, which has been rarely observed in photovoltaic devices involving D–A molecules and block copolymers, will be interesting to improve the efficiency of single-component OSCs.112

3. Top-down approaches to long-range ordered D–A heterojunctions of molecules and polymers
The advent of new nanostructure-fabrication techniques such as e-beam lithography,113 nanoimprint lithography,110,114,115 block copolymer lithography89,116,117 and edge lithography118 has pushed the limit of dimensional control from the micro- to the nanoscale. A variety of nanostructures with arbitrary shapes and structural characteristics can be fabricated using these techniques. In this section, we highlight the progress of using these top-down nanostructure-fabrication techniques to create long-range ordered D–A heterojunctions in polymer solar cells.
3.1 Nanoimprint lithography
Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is an embossing method by which large areas and high densities of nanostructures can be replicated in polymers from pre-patterned moulds. He et al.119 reported a double nanoimprinting process in which P3HT was patterned with high density arrays of nanostructures by solvent-assisted NIL using a prepatterned silicon mold, followed by a second NIL process of stamping the resulting P3HT nanostructures into a heated film of poly((9,9-dioctylfluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,7-bis(3-hexylthien-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole]-2′,2′′-diyl) (F8TBT) as the acceptor (Fig. 18). Using this technique, feature sizes as small as 25 nm on a 50 nm pitch were obtained. Importantly, a gradual increase of the PCE of the photovoltaic devices involving these nanopatterned D–A arrays was observed when the feature size-width decreased from 200 to 25 nm. The device with 25 nm features showed a PCE as high as 1.85%, which is 50% higher than that of the blend control device without patterning.

The same strategy of a double nanoimprinting process was used to obtain well-ordered heterojunctions of P3HT/PCBM solar cells.120 A rather high density of interpenetrating D–A columns as small as 25 nm was obtained. Again, the PCE of the photovoltaic devices increases with reducing feature sizes of the D–A columns, reaching a value of 3.25% for 25 nm features.
Kim et al.121 fabricated P3HT nanorods (50 nm in diameter and 150 nm in height) using nanoporous anodic aluminum oxides (AAO) as templates (Fig. 19). In contrast to the predominant edge-on conformation of P3HT in planar thin films, a partial face-on conformation was observed in the P3HT chains confined in the nanorods. A PCE as high as 1.12% was obtained in the photovoltaic device involving P3HT-nanorods–C60 in the active layer, which is one magnitude higher than the PCE (0.17%) of planar P3HT–C60 bilayer devices.

Recently, Chang et al.122 also used AAO as templates (pore diameter = 60 nm; pore-to-pore spacing = 40 nm) to fabricate nanorods of a crosslinkable C60 derivative (38) (Fig. 20). These crosslinked nanorods (denoted as C-PCBSD) as the electron-transporting layer were transferred onto the top of ZnO-coated ITO substrates in an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/C-PCBSD/P3HT:ICBA/PEDOT:PSS/Ag, where ICBA stands for an indene–C60 bisadduct (molecular structure shown in Fig. 20B). The vertical alignment induced by the fullerene nanorods leads to one magnitude higher electron mobility, compared to the control device with a planar layer of C-PCBSD. As a consequence, the PCE of the photovoltaic device was improved to 7.3%, 18% higher than the PCE (6.2%) of the control device with a planar layer of C-PCBSD. It should be noted that the active layer in the device shown in Fig. 20B is still a BHJ of P3HT:ICBA in which the D–A interface is not well defined. Photovoltaic devices involving the crosslinked vertically aligned nanorods of C-PCBSD as the acceptor infiltrated with a polymer (e.g. P3HT) as the donor were not reported.

3.2 Nanoskiving
Nanoskiving is an ultramicrotome-based process for creating nanostructures by sectioning thin films.123 Lipomi et al.124 applied this method to the fabrication of an ordered D–A heterojunction of poly(2-methoxy-5-(20-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV, p-type) and poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline ladder) (BBL, n-type) (Fig. 21). A three-step process was involved: (i) spin-coating of a composite film of alternating layers of p-type and n-type polymers on a planar substrate; (ii) rolling the film into a cylinder (a “jelly roll”); (iii) sectioning the film perpendicular to the axis of the roll with an ultramicrotome. The thickness of the slab is determined by the microtome and the spacing between the two polymers is determined by spin-coating. Although the PCE of the resulting photovoltaic devices was low (ca. 0.02%), in which the polymer/electrode contact needs further improvement, nanoskiving offers a unique way of obtaining vertically continuous D–A heterojunctions with a well-defined spacing on the nanometer scale.

4. Summary and perspective
Rapid advances in both materials synthesis and device processing for OSCs have led to improved power conversion efficiency up to 10%. In state-of-the-art OSCs, the active layer, termed “bulk heterojunctions”, is primarily composed of physically blended light-absorbing π-conjugated molecules/polymers as donors and fullerene derivatives (mainly PCBM) as acceptors. It is expected that the device efficiency will be improved further by long-range ordering of the D–A heterojunction with domain sizes comparable to the exciton diffusion lengths (∼10 nm for π-conjugated polymers). In an effort to achieve such “ideal” D–A heterojunctions, one approach is through bottom-up self-assembly of covalently linked D–A molecules and block copolymers, and the other is through top-down lithography using prepatterned solid molds.
Several factors need to be considered in the design, synthesis and assembly of D–A molecules and block copolymers: (1) D–A charge transfer interactions should be minimized while segregated D–D/A–A stacking needs to be maximized. This can be achieved, for example, by asymmetrical functionalization of D–A molecules with soluble groups which are incompatible with each other. (2) In most of the present self-assembling systems of D–A molecules and block copolymers, the orientation of D–D and A–A stacking tend to be parallel to the substrates or electrodes, which limits the vertical charge carrier transport to the electrodes in solar cell devices. (3) The donor segment of existing D–A block copolymers has been limited to P3HT, largely due to the synthetic advances of chain-growth polymerization.125,126 The development of polymer chemistry for low-band-gap polymers with well-defined chain lengths and chain-end groups is needed for new D–A block copolymers with broadened absorption of light and other desired properties for OSCs.
It remains a challenge in supramolecular self-assembling systems to control both nanoscale phase-separated morphology and vertically orientated π–π stacking relative to electrodes. Although nanoimprint lithography provides an alternative way to achieving this goal, it is difficult to push the patterning size feature to the limit of exciton diffusion length which is typically below 10 nm for most π-conjugated polymers.
To date, efforts for obtaining ordered D–A organic/polymeric heterojunctions by bottom-up assembly of molecular/polymeric building blocks have not resulted in photovoltaic devices competitive with the state-of-the-art polymer/fullerene BHJ devices (Table 1). The top-down lithography approaches, with the exception of that of Chang et al.,122 have also not been competitive with the state-of-the-art polymer/fullerene BHJ devices. Nevertheless, long-range ordered nanostructures and well-defined D/A interfaces are important to understand the correlation between macroscale device performance and nano/micro-scale photophysics at defined D/A interfaces, thus providing insights for materials design and morphology optimization to improve the device performance. In the future, a combination of top-down lithography and bottom-up assembly, which has been successfully used to achieve large-area ordered assembly of conventional coil–coil block copolymers,89,116,127 but rarely for π-conjugated molecules and block copolymers, will bring new opportunities to address the still open question: what is the ideal morphology for OSCs?

Mingfeng Wang	Mingfeng Wang is currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering at Nanyang Technological University. He received his BSc degree in Chemistry at Jilin University in 2001, followed by his MSc degree in Polymer Chemistry and Physics under the supervision of Prof. Xi Zhang. In 2004, he joined Prof. Mitchell A. Winnik's group at the University of Toronto and obtained his PhD degree in Polymer Chemistry and Materials in 2009. Then he was awarded with a Postdoctoral Fellowship supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and moved to Prof. Fred Wudl's group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His current research, under the support of 2012 Nanyang Assistant Professorship, focuses on polymeric and supramolecular materials with bioinspired structures and advanced functions for energy sustainability and nanomedicine.
Fred Wudl	Fred Wudl, Research Professor of Chemistry and Materials at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), received his B.S. (1964) and Ph.D. (1967) degree from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where his dissertation work was done with Professor Donald J. Cram. After postdoctoral research with R. B. Woodward at Harvard, he joined the faculty of the State University of New York at Buffalo. He then moved, first in 1972 to AT&T Bell Laboratories, and subsequently to UCSB in 1982 and then UCLA from 1997 to 2006. He is widely known for his work on organic conductors and super-conductors with the discovery of the electronic conductivity of the precursor to the first organic metal and superconductor. His interest in electronically conducting polymers resulted in the discovery of the first transparent organic conductor and the first self-doped polymers.
