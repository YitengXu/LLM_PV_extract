    , Accepted 8th October 2012First published on 9th October 2012AbstractSolar hydrogen generation by water splitting in photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) is an appealing technology for a future hydrogen economy. Hematite is a prospective photoanode material in this respect because of its visible light conjugated band gap, its corrosion stability, its environmentally benign nature and its low cost. Its bulk and surface electronic structure has been under scrutiny for many decades and is considered critical for improvement of efficiency. In the present study, hematite films of nominally 500 nm thickness were obtained by dip-coating on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass slides and then anodised in 1 molar KOH at 500, 600, and 700 mV for 1, 10, 120 and 1440 minutes under dark conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectra recorded at the Fe 3p resonant absorption threshold show that the eg transition before the Fermi energy, which is well developed in the pristine hematite film, becomes depleted upon anodisation. The spectral weight of the eg peak decreases with the square-root of the anodisation time, pointing to a diffusion controlled process. The speed of this process increases with the anodisation potential, pointing to Arrhenius behaviour. Concomitantly, the weakly developed t2g peak intensity becomes enhanced in the same manner. This suggests that the surface of the photoanode contains Fe2+ species which become oxidized toward Fe3+ during anodisation. The kinetic behaviour derived from the experimental data suggests that the anodisation forms an electron hole doped film on and below the hematite surface.
Introduction
Solar hydrogen formation by water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) is an exciting concept of fuel generation in a future sustainable energy economy.1 The PEC is different from a standard photovoltaic device based on solid materials insofar as the latter one generates electric power exclusively whereas the former device may generate chemical instead of electrical energy. The search for stable, highly efficient and affordable PEC electrode materials (photoanodes and photocathodes), is an on-going quest.2 Hematite, α-Fe2O3, remains an intriguing choice for the oxygen-evolving photoanode material because of its chemical stability, its low price and its band-gap energy of around 2.1 eV, which allows it to absorb a considerable part of light from the visible part of the solar spectrum.3–5 Recent theoretical and computational works published in this journal support that hematite remains a promising parent material for water oxidation and CO2 reduction reaction,6 putting it therefore also in the center for artificial photosynthesis. Although hematite was considered a bench mark system to test strongly correlated electron systems in the framework of the Green's function plus Coulomb interaction approximation (GWA),7 hematite remains a complex system. The electronic structure of hematite has some drawbacks which remain a challenge for PEC applications.8 The hole diffusion length of hematite is very short and allows the undesired premature recombination of holes and electrons in the material before they can diffuse to the surface and perform chemical work such as water oxidation.9
The photoelectrochemical properties and the electronic structure of hematite have been studied for many decades. Hematite belongs to the group of semiconductors whose conduction band rests below the water-oxidation potential, so that an anodic bias potential is required for photoelectrochemical water splitting.2 It was recently suggested that photogenerated holes initially oxidize the hematite surface under water oxidation conditions – which constitutes an anodic bias.10 We have recently found that exposure to such anodic bias in KOH forms in hematite an electronic structure which shows up in the oxygen X-ray absorption spectrum as a new state in the upper Hubbard band.11 Our recent Fe2p resonant photoemission studies on hematite showed that the valence band spectra shifted systematically towards the Fermi energy after anodisation at potentials of at least 600 mV versus Ag/AgCl, suggesting that the anodisation causes hole doping in the hematite film.12 Since the two former experiments were conducted ex situ after anodisation, the detected hole states must be considered remnant. Those are phenomenlogically different from the transient, photogenerated hole states that are generated under appropriate anodic bias during illumination with visible light.13–15
Major part of the physical chemistry of photoelectrodes is governed by the principles of electrified interfaces that date back to the theories of Guoy and Chapman, and Debye and Hückel.16 The 2nd Ertl Symposium on Surface and Interface Chemistry (24–27 June 2012 in Stuttgart, Germany) provided an exciting platform for the exchange of established and emerging ideas on the electrified interface between fundamental science and applications. We present for this PCCP themed issue, which is dedicated to this Symposium, our very recent X-ray spectroscopy results on the anodisation of iron oxide in an alkaline electrolyte.
Experimental
Sample synthesis and film deposition
The hematite films were prepared based on the procedure described recently.11 Oleic acid (17.0 g) was heated to 125 °C and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (28.0 g) was added in small portions. After 1.5 h of continuous stirring a viscous mass formed. Heating and stirring was continued for approximately 3 h until the formation of nitrous gases ceased. The mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and dried in the fume hood for 24 h. The hardened glittery brown residue was loosened, cut into small pieces and suspended in 50 mL tetrahydrofuran. The suspension was stirred for 20 min and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm. The supernatant liquid (solution) – the hematite precursor – was skimmed off and recovered for further processing. A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass slide (12 × 30 × E 2 mm) was dip-coated (DipMaster™-50, Chemat Technology Inc., USA). The precursor solution was removed from the back of the glass with an acetone-soaked wipe and dried at 75 °C for 5 min on a hot plate. The samples were then annealed for 30 min at 500 °C. During annealing excess hematite peeled from the surface and was removed after cooling. Dip-coating and annealing were repeated three more times to obtain four layers of hematite. Four layers turned out to have optimal photocurrent.11Fig. 1 shows a typical Fe2O3 film (the photo anode) dip-coated on standard fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass slides (Hartford Glass, Connecticut).
 Fig. 1  Left – 4-layer hematite photoanode prepared from four subsequent dip-coating and annealing steps with an FTO glass substrate. The coated layers were intentionally offset to allow for visual discrimination of the layers by the colour shading. 
The thicknesses of the photoanodes were measured using a mechanical profilometer (XP-1 Stylus Profiler by Ambios Technology). The results showed an average total thickness of 510 ± 65 nm for the four layer film.
Anodisation
The photoanodes were anodised under dark conditions in a specifically designed spectro-photoelectrochemical cell constructed from polyether ether ketone (PEEK) plastic as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI‡), using a Voltalab80 PGZ 402 potentiostat. The photoanodes were connected as the working electrode in a three electrode configuration photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) with a platinum plate (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) counter electrode and Ag/AgCl/sat. KCl reference electrode. 10 cm3 of 1 M KOH was used as an electrolyte. The anodisation potentials were 500 mV, 600 mV, and 700 mV. Anodisation times were 1 min, 10 min, 120 min, and 1440 min. Samples exposed to KOH at 0 mV anodisation for various times were taken as reference. The dark current transients were used in order to determine the total charge Q deposited in the hematite sample during anodisation time t: .
The calculated charges are listed in Table 1. After anodisation, the photoanodes were rinsed several times in distilled water in order to remove any KOH electrolyte.

Gas chromatography measurements of H2
H2 was generated with a solar simulator light source under the aforementioned described experimental conditions in a specifically designed gas-tight Teflon PEC cell for online H2 gas detection and quantification with a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu). Fig. S2 (ESI‡) shows the evolution of hydrogen under illumination at potentials from 200 mV to 500 mV during 80 minutes of anodisation, and representative chromatograms.
Photoemission and X-ray absorption spectroscopy
Photoemission spectra (Fig. 2–4) were recorded at the Solid Liquid Analysis System (SoLiAS) end station17 at beamline TGM-718 at BESSY-II, Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin. After the final processing step of the electrochemical treatment, i.e. anodizing in KOH, the hematite film was inserted into the SoLiAS – a moveable ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system built for photoemission spectroscopy (PES) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) applications located at BESSY II in Berlin (Germany). This system is attached to the TGM-7 beam line which is equipped with a toroid grating mirror providing linearly polarized light with a high brilliance in the energy range of 20 to 120 eV dedicated for valence band studies. As an analyser, a SPECS Phoibos 150 hemisphere was mainly operated in fixed analyser transmission mode (FAT) at pass energies of 10 eV leading to an energy resolution of about 0.4 eV in the considered exciting energy range. Measuring time and energy step width within the scans were adapted to an optimum statistic. The photoemission spectra were recorded in a spatial arrangement with the angle of the incident light beam towards the surface normal of the sample being the same as the detection angle of the analyser under zero bias conditions. Near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra (Fig. 8) were recorded at the undulator beamline UG-56 at BESSY,19 in an UHV recipient with 2 × 10−10 mTorr base pressure or lower. The resolution of this beamline is 0.05 eV (80000 at 64 eV) at the soft energy range for the oxygen K-edge.

Resonant photoemission spectra (Fig. 5) were recorded at the new ambient pressure XPS end station at beamline 9.3.2 of the Advanced Light Source,20,21 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The energy resolution of the beamline is E/ΔE = 3000. During measurements the base pressure of the main chamber was maintained at 10−9 Torr. The resonant VB PES spectra for Fe metal were measured using photon energies between 704 and 716 eV, leading up to the 2p3/2 resonance energies. All spectra were recorded with an energy resolution of around 0.1 eV and in an ultra-high vacuum of 10−9 Torr.
Results and discussion
The XPS survey spectrum in Fig. 2 was obtained with an excitation energy of 110 eV (soft X-ray regime) and shows shallow core level states around 53 eV attributed to Fe 3p and around 23 eV belonging to O 2s. A pronounced peak structure in the lower valence band down to 10 eV consists of Fe 3d and O 2p related valence states (a more detailed explanation is given later on). In between, noticeable K 3s and K 3p emissions of residual potassium arising from the used electrolyte are visible.

Fig. 3 shows the Fe 3p resonant valence band spectra of the hematite film anodised for 10 minutes at 500 mV, recorded with X-ray energies ranging from 50 eV to 60 eV. The structures at around 1.5 eV, 3 eV and 5.5 eV, are indicative of O 2p-Fe 3d hybridized states with eg and t2g orbital symmetry and the O 2p valence states, respectively. It is of general interest to separate the various spectral contributions in hybridized states in the valence band. For hematite, this has been shown recently using X-ray standing waves as the excitation source for photoemission.22 According to Fujimori et al.,23 the features in the valence band (VB) of FexO and Fe2O3 can be interpreted as 3d6 and 3d5, respectively. The shoulder in the energy distribution curve (EDC) in between 3 eV and the Fermi level EF (EB = 0 eV) is primarily due to the 3d6 electronic configuration of Fe2+ ions. This shoulder is absent for the maximum valency of iron in Fe2O324 where all cations are nominal of Fe3+ type with a 3d5 valence configuration. This suggests that the film contains at the surface Fe2+ prior to anodisation. We notice that the highest relative spectral weight of the features is obtained at certain excitation. The t2g peak has its highest intensity at the excitation energy of 60 eV whereas the eg peak is highest at 56 eV. Moreover, it seems that there is metallic Fe and oxidised Fe (with varying valency) in the film (this can be found out by looking more in detail to the Fe 3p line).
The 3+ states are energetically above the 2+ states thus if we chose the excitation energy which lays between these two states the 3+ state will be suppressed in the resonant channel. We have plotted the peak heights for the O 2p σ peak and the eg peak versus the X-ray energy in Fig. S325,26 (ESI‡) in order to highlight at which X-ray energies we can anticipate the best contrast variation.
The valence band spectra in Fig. 4 were recorded from a sample anodised at 500 mV for 1, 10, 120 and 1440 minutes. The spectrum with t = 0 is taken from a non-anodised film. Substantial changes in the spectral features upon anodisation time are obvious. For example, the O 2p π state at −7 eV binding energy becomes particularly pronounced. The right panel in Fig. 3 shows the spectral intensities of the O2p σ and eg peaks versus the X-ray energy and based on this intensity analysis, we selected 56 eV as the excitation energy in order to be particularly sensitive to the eg transition at around −1.5 eV. The eg peak height decreases with increasing anodisation time to an extent that it is only a shoulder after 1440 minutes anodisation, revealing that the concentration of Fe2+ decreases systematically. Correspondingly, we find that the t2g feature increases upon anodisation, confirming that the concentration of Fe3+ is increasing in parallel.
The Fe 2p core level spectra of anodised hematite from a previous experiment at the Advanced Light Source are shown in Fig. 5. Generally, the features of the Fe 2p states in XPS spectra of iron oxides look broader for Fe2+ and sharper for Fe3+.27 Close inspection of the spectra in Fig. 5 suggests that the samples kept under OCV and anodised at 0 mV have somewhat broader peaks than those anodised at 200 and 600 mV. Hence, the features formed during anodisation can be interpreted as oxidation from Fe2+ to Fe3+.

The fact that we have recorded the spectra in resonance to the Fe3p transition facilitates the quantitative analysis; without resonant enhancement this analysis would probably not be possible. All spectra were normalized to unity with respect to the O 2p σ peak at around −5.5 eV. The height (relative spectral weight) of the eg peak was plotted versus the anodisation time. The same observations are made with the samples anodised at 600 mV (not shown here) and at 700 mV. The spectra of the samples anodised at 700 mV are shown in Fig. 4 on the right. Here we see that the trends found for the 500 mV anodised samples are continued. However, close inspection of the spectral weight of the eg peaks shows that there is a systematic decrease of the spectral weight which, when shown in a Cottrell plot, follows a linear trend, revealing that the eg state scales with the square-root of the anodisation time, reminiscent of a parabolic growth law.
The evolution of the spectral weight of the eg peak versus anodisation time follows generally a (negative) square root trend, which is shown by a linear decrease of the spectral weight in the Cottrell plot in Fig. 6, as determined by linear least square fits to the data points. This reveals that the concentration of the Fe2+ follows a parabolic growth and thus suggests that the hematite film is in fact not only sub-stoichiometric at the surface but also underneath the surface down to a particular – but not yet quantitatively determined – depth, and this thickness can be considered a film as well.
 Fig. 6  Cottrell-plot for the variation of the spectral weight of the eg state with anodisation time for three different anodisation potentials. Right – slope of the Cottrell plot versus the anodisation potential. The solid line is an exponential least square fit. 
We can now determine and compare the electric charge that we have deposited in the sample. Table 1 shows the charge in C per cm2 determined by integration of the current density. Note that we have chosen the anodisation times of 1, 10, 120 and 1440 minutes as constituting changes on a logarithmic time scale. The charge for the two samples anodised at 500 mV shows a linear increase which can be represented by a linear least square fit with 99.96% and 100% correlation, respectively. The slopes are 0.0787 for the light and 0.00947 for the dark experiment. For the two samples anodised at 600 mV, the growth of the charge versus time can be better approximated with a quadratic growth law, whereas that for the 700 mV films follows better a square root growth law.
In general, it should be possible to estimate the thickness of the film that propagates from the photoanode surface down to the interior from the integrated anodic current density I/A over a time period t:  
With Faraday's law of electrolysis and a mass density ρ of 5.24 g cm−3 and a molar mass M of 159.70 g mol−1 for hematite, we arrive at a film growth of 3 microns for every Coulomb of charge per cm2 deposited by anodisation in the hematite film. For 1 minute and 10 minutes of anodisation at 500 mV, this corresponds to 9 nm and 81 nm, respectively. Comparison with the charge listed in Table 1 we thus find that the deposited charge does not reasonably correspond to the film converted from Fe2+ to Fe3+. The film growth and thus the film thickness are in fact underestimated, likely because of significant parasitic reactions taking place.
The slope of the linear fits in the Cottrell plot in Fig. 6 (left), increases systematically with the anodisation potential. As a matter of fact, the slope changes by a factor of two with every 100 mV increase of anodisation potential, suggesting an Arrhenius activated growth process, which we have projected in Fig. 6 (right) with an exponential growth law.
We have illustrated this in Fig. 7 where we have overlaid a square root like growth curve with a corresponding varying stoichiometry as indicated by changes in the colour. The top of the hematite film is sub-stoichiometric as Fe2O3−δ, and the film interior is approaching a stoichiometric ferrous oxide upon anodisation towards δ = 0.

The solid line is the spectral weight of the eg peak vs. anodisation time. Right – scanning electron micrograph of a fracture cross section of hematite photoanode after 2 h anodisation at 700 mV. Bottom – top view of the non-anodised (left) and 2 h anodised (right) photoanode. 
The right panel in Fig. 7 shows a scanning electron micrograph with the hematite film on top of the FTO layer and the glass support – after anodisation of 2 hours at 700 mV. The deposited charge for this sample was 95.4 C per cm2 and would correspond to 300 micrometer film thickness, whereas the actual hematite film thickness is around 500 nanometers. About the understanding of how such anodic film could grow under the presented conditions, we were inspired by observations made with the anodisation of glassy carbon for electrochemical double layer capacitor electrodes (“supercapacitors”28). There, the anodic films grown by either electrochemical29 or gas-phase oxidation30 could be easily identified with electron microscopy. Close inspection of the film in the top right panel in Fig. 7 shows that about the top half of the film could have a slightly darker appearance than the bottom half underneath. But we cannot make this distinction between both parts of the film unambiguously. This is due to extremely small electron optical contrast in the SEM which originates from the different electronic conductivity of either sample portion, smaller than in the aforementioned glassy carbon films. In analogy to very bright images due to sample charging of poorly conducting specimen, we have here probably a higher electronic conductivity at the top portion due to the reverse effect, i.e. better conductivity due to hole doping. This seems to be confirmed by the top view of the photoanodes in the two bottom images in Fig. 7. The dark regions on the photoanode after anodisation seem to confirm that anodisation generates electrically better conducting regions which appear in electron microscopy darker than the non-anodised films.
The bias potentials were only 500 mV to 700 mV, but the electric fields that build up from the surface within the depletion layer are thousands of Volts cm–1 and should be able to promote the movement of small ions.31 In the study reported in,31 doped atoms were considered to leach out and thus altered the doping profile in titanium oxide and strontium titanate. For the cathodic ageing of SrTiO3, injection of H+ has been reported, as well as changes of its flatband potential.31
We have recently found that the valence band spectra of anodised hematite shifted toward the Fermi level with increasing anodisation potential. The spectral shift scaled systematically with the bias potential at which the photoanodes had been oxidized. Interestingly, this shift was only noticeable when the XPS spectra were generated Fe 2p resonant at around 705 eV X-ray energy.12 This spectral shift can be rationalized as electron hole doping of the hematite. Since this effect is particularly visible in the Fe 2p resonant spectra, we suspect that the electron holes originate from Fe3d–Fe3d transitions.
It has been suggested that the surface of hematite may to some extent favour formation of Fe2+ type species32 which then could go along with the Fe3O4-like surface. We observe the presence of Fe2+ species in this new study and also its conversion into Fe3+. It has been suggested that FeOOH is the stable surface species on Fe2O3 surfaces in strong alkaline media such as KOH.33 When we assume that such an Fe3O4-like reconstructed hematite surface corresponds to the following reaction, Fe(II)O + Fe(III)2O3 ⇔ Fe3O4, then the Fe(II) species could react with the hydroxyl groups in the electrolyte and with a hole h+ as follows: Fe(II)O + OH− + h+ ⇔ Fe(II)OOH, particularly in 1 M KOH under anodic conditions. Correspondingly, the Fermi level at the photoanode surface would vary with the pH as determined by the free energy change of the reaction Fe − OHsurf+ 〈=〉 Fe − Osurf + H+34
However, our observations imply that we are transforming a significant amount of Fe2+ into Fe3+, whereas X-ray diffraction35 and oxygen NEXAFS studies11 show that our photoanode materials constitute predominantly hematite. Fig. 8 shows a series of oxygen NEXAFS spectra from nanoparticles obtained from the same precursor solution that we used for film dip coating which were heat treated in air at temperatures from 250 °C to 1000 °C. The pronounced doublet from states with t2g and eg orbital symmetry at around 529 eV and 530.5 eV are indicative to hematite. Hence, temperatures of 500 °C and 550 °C are the proper synthesis temperatures that we have applied in our studies, including the present one. Temperatures below 500 °C and above 550 °C provide iron oxide phases without the necessary sharp double peak, such as γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4.35 The NEXAFS spectra probe a sample depth of around one micrometer and are thus considered bulk sensitive in the context of photoanodes.

Hence, it must be species near the surface that are converted during anodisation and which cannot be probed with (more bulk sensitive than XPS) methods like NEXAFS spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Likely, those are the hypothesized Fe(IV), Fe(V), Fe(VI) species which are stabilized at the surface of iron oxide.36 The Pourbaix diagram of iron oxide (see for example Fig. 9) shows that at high anodizing potentials and high pH, Fe species with high oxidation states are favoured.37 Note that these holes are not to be mistaken for the photogenerated holes which are also considered to form highly oxidized iron species such as Fe(IV) and Fe(V).13,38,39

The Fe(III) species are anticipated to be stable given its electronic structure Fe 3d5. Iron perovskites are frequently attributed the Fe(IV) species for example in La1/2Sr1/2FeO3.40,41 The perovskite structure constitutes an extreme crystallographic environment in which the seemingly exotic Fe(IV) species can be stabilized.42 Atomic multiplett calculations however show that the Fe(IV) is in fact an Fe(III) with a ligand hole from the O 2p orbitals, and the electronic structure of the iron cation is still Fe 3d5, and together with the ligand hole the electronic structure of the Fe4+ reads Fe 3d5.41 Also, where is the spectroscopic evidence for such highly oxidized Fe species? When we re-inspect the VB spectra in Fig. 4, we notice that a sharp transition evolves at around −10.5 eV. This is about the distance from the Fermi energy that we found in the oxygen NEXAFS spectra of 600 mV anodised hematite,11 where we found a new state in the upper Hubbard band which we assigned to a highly oxidized iron species. We believe that the strong alkaline environment with OH− groups plus the strong oxidizing potential create a similar environment like the aforementioned perovskites. Hence, the suspected iron species with very high oxidation states are conjugated with electron holes that originate from OH− and oxidizing conditions. Moreover, this reaction could take place not only at the surface, but could propagate from the surface to the bulk of the hematite, forming hydroxylated species in the crystal lattice such as indicated in Fig. 10. Such scenario is known from the so-called ceramic proton conductors, which are typically oxygen deficient metal oxides with perovskite structure (large crystal lattices) which can accept water vapor, the oxygen molecules of which fill the oxygen vacancies and then form OH− groups together with the protons from the water molecule. The protons from these OH− groups become itinerant at elevated temperatures of around 500–600 K and can serve as charge carriers, making the proton conducting ceramics useful as solid electrolytes.43

Hematite with incorporated protons has been observed in various studies, leading to the term “protohematite”.44,45 The transformation from goethite FeOOH to hematite is known to take place by release of H+ from the crystal lattice and formation of water.46 Possibly we have during anodisation some kind of reverse reaction. It is known from synthetic maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) that small amounts of water are always present,47,48 where for example one H+ replaces one Fe3+ in the lattice out of 12 Fe3+ ions, which amounts to 1% water.49 Finally, protohematite has been found to have a ten times higher catalytic activity than hematite.50 As of yet, it remains open whether the hypothesized protons are malign or benign for solar photoelectrochemical water splitting. What appears to be clear is that the photoanode surface shows Fe2+ which becomes oxidized towards Fe3+ during anodisation. Also, the dark current density increases during anodization, which is shown for a hematite film anodized for 2 hours at 500 mV, see Fig. S4 (ESI‡).
In order to experimentally verify our assertion that hole doped and/or hydroxylated film propagates into the interior of the hematite, it would be necessary to conduct a separate crystallographic study preferably with neutron diffraction of a completely anodised sample in order to exploit the good scattering contrast from protons.
Note that we conducted the present study on photoanode films that were anodised under dark conditions. Illumination causes transitional electron holes,13 and we do not know yet how these interfere with the remnant holes studied in this work.
Conclusions
Hematite photoanodes dip coated on standard FTO coated glass substrates contain Fe2+ features as evidenced from Fe2p resonant XPS valence band spectra. Anodisation of hematite photoanodes in 1 molar KOH alters the iron oxide film to an extent that the Fe2+ feature gradually disappears and the Fe3+ feature concomitantly becomes enhanced. Quantitative analysis of the spectra shows that the anodisation constitutes a process that follows a parabolic growth kinetics which can be interpreted as the growth of an anodic film. The growth can be accelerated by increasing the anodisation potential. Since Fe2+ is not a true iron cation of hematite, it appears that anodization is a benign process which heals the oxygen deficiency at the iron oxide surface. Moreover, this happens throughout the PEC operation process. Based on a previous observation12 that anodisation of hematite in KOH causes hole doping, we conclude that the aforementioned anodic film is a hole doped film. Bulk sensitive analytical methods reveal that the photoanode is indeed hematite from the crystallographic point of view. Therefore, only minute amounts of Fe2+ can be in or on the hematite photoanode and thus become converted, most likely at the hematite surface. The time that is required to alter the samples by anodisation so that the valence band spectra change accordingly suggests that the anodisation is in fact bulk invasive and acts not only at or on the hematite surface. A potential scenario is that protonic defects propagate into the hematite interior and form hydroxyl groups with oxygen ions in the hematite lattice. Over time, such a process should be possibly observable with a high resolution neutron diffraction study on bulky samples. According to Nowotny, Norby and Bak, “it is essential to realize that the effect of hydrogen on the properties of oxides immersed in water is substantial and cannot be ignored. TiO2is not an exception. Therefore, the defect disorder models derived in this work51can be used for correct assessment of oxides when reflecting the presence of protons in the lattice. The present work51shows that the effect of hydrogen on the concentration of both ionic and electronic defects in TiO2is substantial and must not be ignored”.51
In general, it should be possible to relate the spectroscopic data with the transport properties of the photoanode. One quantitative example for such possibility has been demonstrated for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes, where relative spectral weight, hole concentration and conductivity were related with linear and exponential functions.52 For the Si doped hematite photoanode, we have recently provided a qualitative correlation between the relative hole concentration and the onset potential of the photocurrent.13 In order to carry out a similar approach for the current system, it will be necessary to carry out parallel spectroscopy experiments on photoanodes anodized under light conditions. In addition, it will be necessary to determine the thickness of the hypothesized film. As of yet, the film thickness as determined from the deposited charge during anodisation is grossly overestimated.
