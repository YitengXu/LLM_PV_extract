    , Accepted 10th June 2019First published on 10th June 2019AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) crystals are emerging materials for nanoelectronics, and computationally identifying novel 2D materials with distinct electronic and optical properties furnishes a vital first step for future photovoltaic technology. Herein, based on the density functional theory and Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we reported new members of the family of 2D Group V–VI compounds, i.e., Sb2Te2X (X = S, Se) compounds, which exhibited excellent dynamic and thermal stabilities. It was found that 2D Sb2Te2S and Sb2Te2Se possess moderate band gaps of 0.87 and 0.76 eV, respectively, and they are advantageous over other frequently studied 2D materials. Most surprisingly, it was demonstrated that Sb2Te2X has two excellent characteristics, i.e., high isotropic electron mobility surpassing 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 and remarkable optical absorption over the entire visible region with a high photoresponse (∼0.044 A W−1). The exceptional electronic properties in combination with fascinating optical properties illustrate the great potential of Sb2Te2X, for example, in photovoltaic devices, boosting a new area in the research of Group V–VI 2D semiconductors.
1. Introduction
The first experimentally isolated two-dimensional (2D) material graphene exhibits exceptional electronic, optoelectronic, and electrochemical properties; it also has potential applications in electronic devices, sensors, catalysis, and energy conversion devices.1,2 Since then, increased research efforts have been devoted to graphene and its analogues such as hexagonal boron nitride,3,4 layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),5–8 phosphorenes9,10 and 2D metal organic frameworks (MOFs),11,12 which offer a broad range of the material's solutions with tunable electronic and optical properties.13–23 Please note that although these 2D materials exhibit novel properties different from their bulk counterparts, there also exist certain disadvantages that hinder their applications. For example, graphene exhibits a semimetallic nature. The lack of an intrinsic band gap results in graphene-based field-effect transistors (FET) showing a relatively low ON/OFF ratio.24–26 For TMDs, the carrier mobility is typically below 300 cm2 V−1 s−1, which limits their applications in fast-developing electronic and optoelectronic devices.27 Another example is black phosphorene (BP), which has a tunable band gap between 0.35 eV and 1.73 eV, intrinsic high hole mobility and in-plane anisotropy. Unfortunately, it suffers from serious air instability.28,29 Thus, searching for novel 2D materials with desirable properties has become one of the most important scientific topics.
Recently, a Group V–VI monolayer material, i.e., Bi2O2Se was successfully fabricated by the chemical vapor deposition method.30–33 The reported ultrahigh Hall mobility of Bi2O2Se exceeds 20000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at low temperatures30,32 together with high current ON/OFF ratios (>106), near-ideal subthreshold swing values (∼65 mV dec−1), and ultrafast photoresponses (∼1 ps),30,31 making Bi2O2Se a promising semiconductor candidate for future nano-devices with a high performance and low power. Inspired by the experiments, we herein proposed a new member of the family of Group V–VI compounds, i.e., Sb2Te2X (X = S, Se), whose bulk counterparts have been widely investigated in topological phenomena.34–36 Its layered morphology afforded high feasibility to achieve single-layer Sb2Te2X by advanced experimental technology such as mechanical exfoliation and facial chemical vapor deposition methods.37 Based on the first-principles simulations, we found that monolayer Sb2Te2X shows high stability even above room temperature. The calculated band gaps were 0.87 eV and 0.76 eV for Sb2Te2S and Sb2Te2Se monolayers, respectively. In addition, high isotropic electron mobility was observed in this kind of 2D material with the value up to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1. Even more surprisingly, we found that Sb2Te2X monolayers exhibited rather strong optical absorption over the entire visible region with a high photoresponse of ∼0.048 A W−1, which could be ascribed to the orbital distribution and band nesting effects. The combination of these promising properties indicates the potential of Sb2Te2X as a strong candidate for future nano-electronics and energy-harvesting devices. The current results are also expected to ignite new interests in the family of 2D materials beyond TMDs and phosphorene.
2. Computational details
The structural optimization, electronic structure and optical absorption calculations were performed based on DFT as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).38 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to account for electron exchange and correlation.39 The wave functions were constructed using a projector augmented wave approach with a plane wave cutoff energy of 500 eV. Monkhorst–Pack k-point meshes40 of 9 × 9 × 1 and 11 × 11 × 1 were used for geometry optimization and self-consistent electronic structure calculations. The convergence threshold was set as 10−5 eV in energy and 0.01 eV Å−1 in force. A vacuum space larger than 20 Å was used in the direction perpendicular to the surface to reduce the interaction between its periodic images. For band structure calculations, we used Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) including spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effect to double check the validity of the affordable PBE method. Phonon dispersion was calculated using the density perturbation functional theory (DPFT) method with a 4 × 4 supercell, as embedded in the PHONOPY code.41 Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamic (BOMD) simulations were performed with the NVT ensemble and the temperature was controlled using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat;42 this was carried out using a 4 × 4 supercell at 1000 K with a time step of 3 fs lasting for 7.5 ps. Photoresponse calculations were carried out based on the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the framework of the density functional theory (NEGF-DFT),43,44 which started from the Hamiltonian of the electron–photon system43  where  is calculated self-consistently, and  is added as a perturbation of electron–photon interaction. The photocurrent (Iph) is obtained as  where α stands for the lead electrode; Tα(E)is the effective transmission coefficient, and the implementations can be found elsewhere.45–50
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structures and stability of Sb2Te2X
As shown in Fig. 1(a), Sb2Te2X forms a hexagonal lattice with the Pm1 group symmetry. The unit cell of Sb2Te2X contains 2 Sb atoms, 2 Te atoms and one X atom. Each unit cell comprises five sublayers, where the top and bottom layers are occupied by Te atoms, the second and fourth layers are composed of Sb atoms, and the middle layer is occupied by X atoms. Detailed description of the structural information of Sb2Te2X is displayed in Table 1. The overall larger structural parameters of Sb2Te2Se are mainly due to different atomic radii (S: 1.04 Å, Se: 1.17 Å). The hexagonal Brillouin zone depicted in Fig. 1(b) shows high symmetry points and the paths from which we calculate the band structures.

In the subsequent section, we report the stability of the proposed 2D Sb2Te2X. The dynamic stability of the proposed 2D structures can be tested by calculating their vibrational spectra. Dynamically stable structures are indicated when the calculated dispersions of phonon modes have positive square of frequency throughout the Brillouin zone. In Fig. 1(c and d), the calculated phonon dispersions of Sb2Te2X monolayers are shown. The absence of imaginary phonon modes indicates that two structures are stable minima on the potential energy surface and thus, they are kinetically stable.51 In addition, we tested the thermal stability of Sb2Te2X by BOMD simulations; from the snapshots of Sb2Te2X monolayers taken at 7.5 ps, we observe the well-maintained framework as its initial equilibrium structure. These results suggest that they can firmly keep their structural integrity even at 1000 K, which is sufficiently high for room-temperature applications (please see ESI† for details). Additionally, we carried out BOMD at 300 K for Sb2Te2S and O2 within a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The well-maintained framework without oxygen bonding indicates the high chemical stability. More substantial calculation results on the coherence energy (Ecoh) of the Sb2Te2X monolayers are obtained by ; here, E0 is the total equilibrium energy and Ni and μi stand for the number and chemical potential of ith type of atoms, respectively;  is the total atoms in the unit cell. Negative Ecoh values (Table 1) indicate an exothermic chemical reaction in the formation of freestanding monolayers.18 Besides, these values are comparable with that of layered arsenic (2.96 eV per atom), which has been synthesized with high stability.62 All these results strongly confirm high feasibility to realize the 2D Sb2Te2X monolayers experimentally.
Since elastic constants serve as crucial parameters in finite element analysis, thermal expansion, harmonic generation, etc.,52 the elastic constants of Sb2Te2X were calculated. Also, the Young's modulus (E(θ)) and Poisson's ratio v(θ) of Sb2Te2X along the arbitrary in-plane direction θ can be obtained by the following formula:    Here, c = cosθ and s = sinθ. The isotropic elasticity of the system leads to C11 = C22 and C44 = (C11 − C12)/2, which, in turn, lead to Y = (C112 − C122)/C11 and v = C12/C11.63 As shown in Table 1, the calculated elastic constants are C11 = 95.94 and 23.46 N m−1 and C12 = 99.51 and 25.39 N m−1 for the Sb2Te2S and Sb2Te2Se monolayers, respectively. The values falling into the Born criteria verified their mechanical stability.53 In addition, we found that they displayed much smaller Y values than typical 2D crystals including graphene (341 N m−1) and MoS2 (120 N m−1),52 which implied that the materials are relatively softer. This also indicates high feasibility to tune the properties of Sb2Te2X via strain engineering.
3.2 Electronic properties of Sb2Te2X
We then move on to the assessment of the electronic properties of Sb2Te2X. To provide more information on the characteristics of chemical bonding, the electron localized function (ELF) and charge density difference (CDD) of Sb2Te2S are calculated and shown in Fig. 2. ELF analyzes the extent of the spatial localization of reference electrons. The upper limit of ELF(r) is 1, which represents perfect localization, while ELF(r) = 1/2 for electron gas-like pairs.54 CDD is defined as the total electronic density of Sb2Te2X subtracted by the electronic densities of isolated Sb, Te and X atoms. As depicted in Fig. 2(a and b), it is obvious that electrons are largely localized around Sb, Te and X atoms. Additionally, the high ELF values between Sb–Te and Sb–S indicate their strong bonding character, which is crucial to stabilize the 2D frame structures of Sb2Te2X. Additionally, electron cloud is distributed around S and Te atoms (Fig. 2(c)), which can be understood by the electron transfer from Sb to S and Te atoms, as shown in Fig. 2(d).

Electronic band structures of (e) Sb2Te2S and (f) Sb2Te2Se at HSE + SOC functional. (g) Partial density of states of Sb2Te2Se. Vertical arrows in (e) show band nesting regions. 
The band structures of Sb2Te2X are shown in Fig. 2(e and f), which demonstrate semiconducting behaviors with indirect band gaps. The calculated band gaps at the HSE + SOC level were 0.87 and 0.76 eV for Sb2Te2S and Sb2Te2Se, respectively, which were comparable to that of 2D Bi2O2Se (indirect band gap, ∼0.8 ± 0.05 eV).33 Such nearly perfect energy gaps were much smaller than those of widely explored 2D TMDs, BP and perovskites, which are considerably large enough to build FETs with a high ON/OFF switch ratio; also, these materials can serve as excellent photovoltaic ingredients. At the second glance, these two monolayers exhibited interesting Mexican hat-shaped dispersion in the valence band, which was confirmed using their 3D representation of the band structure (inset in Fig. 2(e)). In view of preferable band gaps, 2D Sb2Te2X is therefore expected to uncover more remarkable properties. Additionally, the conduction band maximum (CBM) is located at the Γ high-symmetry point, whereas the valence band minimum (VBM) is between Γ and K high-symmetry points in the first Brillouin zone. The partial density of states of Sb2Te2Se is shown in Fig. 2(g); we can see that CBM is dominated primarily by Te and Sb atoms, whereas the states of Se, Sb and Te atoms contribute to VBM. We also obtained the calculations for band structures using PBE and HSE functionals. The corresponding results are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It should be noted that the PBE functional could afford comparable band gap values with respect to a more accurate HSE + SOC level. Thus, affordable PBE is a reasonable method that guarantees validity. This is also similar to the observation for Bi2OS2, another 2D Group V–VI compound, where the PBE method has been reported to reproduce HSE + SOC; this is in good agreement with the experimental results.64 Henceforth, unless otherwise stated, the PBE functional was used in the investigations.
To better understand the electronic properties of 2D Sb2Te2X and their potential applications, we calculated the room-temperature electron mobility of Sb2Te2X monolayers according to the deformation potential (DP) theory proposed by Bardeen and Shockley.55 The analytical expression of acoustic-phonon-limited carrier mobility (μ) in 2D materials can be written as follows: (1)Here, e stands for the electron charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the room temperature (300 K), and m* indicates effective masses. C2D and E1 denote the elastic modulus and DP constant, respectively.22
The details for the carrier mobility calculations are provided in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Table 2, from which it is clear that the E1, C2D and m* values for both Sb2Te2S and Sb2Te2Se are almost the same along armchair and zigzag directions. Due to the small electron effective mass and large elastic modulus, high electron mobility was induced; its values were predicted to be 1.46 × 103 (1.35 × 103) cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.47 × 103 (1.39 × 103) cm2 V−1 s−1 along zigzag (armchair) directions for Sb2Te2S and Sb2Te2Se, respectively. The values were much superior to that of MoS2 (<400 cm2 V−1 s−1)27 and comparable to that of phosphorene (2300 cm2 V−1 s−1).56 Of note, the carrier mobility was much larger than that of Bi2O2Se with the same computation method (273 cm2 V−1 s−1).65 With such high carrier mobility and moderate band gaps, 2D Sb2Te2X is believed to furnish an ideal opportunity to obtain novel low-dimensional powerful photovoltaics and optoelectronics.57 Moreover, such high orientation-independent carrier mobility endowed Sb2Te2X with excellent in-plane electron conductivity along all directions. As such, the variation in device performance could also be substantially reduced among nanoscale electronics over many obstacles such as low-angle grain boundaries,58 which allowed them to overcome a significant limitation to commercialization.

Another critical issue for 2D materials is the strain effect. Therefore, we investigated the evolution of electronic properties against moderate biaxial strain between −6% and 6%. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the tensile strain decreases band gaps, while compressive strain makes the band gap value increase at first and then decrease with the critical strain value of −4%, which indicates that strain can effectively modulate the band gap value of Sb2Te2X. Furthermore, the energy of the CBM of Sb2Te2X at the Γ high symmetry point became larger than those of others in the first BZ after lattice compression of 4% (Fig. S4, ESI†). From this point of view, we believe that the properties of Sb2Te2X compounds can be efficiently tuned and thus, they have promising applications in flexible nano-devices.

3.3 Optical and transport properties of Sb2Te2X
To use these materials as active elements in photovoltaics, another important feature is the ability to realize highly efficient solar-power transduction. In other words, the material should harbor good optical absorbance. Thus, we move on to the assessment in this aspect by calculating their absorption spectra and photoinduced charge carrier transport properties. The suitable band gaps of Sb2Te2X allow significant absorbance under the visible region. By employing the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) approach, introducing self-energy corrections and capturing excitonic effects, we obtained the absorption coefficients of Sb2Te2X. The absorption coefficient of Bi2O2Se was also included for comparison. As displayed in Fig. 4 (a), the absorption coefficients of Sb2Te2X can reach up to the order of 105 cm−1, which are much higher than that of Bi2O2Se and comparable to those of organic perovskite photovoltaics.59,60 Most surprisingly, we can see that both single layers maintain the high absorption values over the whole visible light region, indicating that the proposed monolayers can achieve high efficiency of solar energy conversion in the visible range of the solar spectrum. Such an interesting phenomenon is rarely found but highly desirable in practical light-harvesting applications. We make a conjecture that such unique optical properties can be caused by orbital composition and band nesting effect. To corroborate these hypotheses, the orbital-resolved band structure of Sb2Te2S is displayed in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It is easy to find that the VBM and CBM of this material are largely occupied by the |s〉 and |p〉 states of the Sb atom, respectively, which ensures a high possibility of the inter-band optical transition according to the selection rule. Besides, the |p〉 orbitals of the anion and cation can give rise to a larger number of bands near the band extrema, which can also result in a large probability of optical transition.66

The joint density of states (JDOS) is also an essential concept for understanding the system's absorption spectrum in condensed matters, and it can be written as (2)where S(ħω) is a surface of constant energy.61 JDOS demonstrates the oscillator strength, which determines the line shape for an optical transition that depends on energy dispersion. The condition |∇k(Ec − Ev)| = 0 with |∇k(Ec ≈ ∇kEv)| > 0 is called band nesting, which gives rise to singularities of JDOS and therefore leads to high optical conductivity.61 The nesting regions for monolayer Sb2Te2S are shown in the insets of Fig. 4(a) and 2(e). An appreciable nesting area can be found in the momentum space, which further contributes to high optical absorbance. These two factors exhibit convincing qualitative agreements with the observed results.
To better understand the optical property of Sb2Te2X, we then move on to the assessment of the photogenerated current transport properties for single-layered Sb2Te2X-based devices based on NEGF-DFT. In Fig. 4(b), we illustrate the envisioned device consisting of an Sb2Te2X monolayer. In this kind of device, a two-probe model constructed with a center scattering region and two semi-infinite Sb2Te2X sheets electrodes is adopted. The zero-bias transmission spectra of Sb2Te2Se are computed as an example to give an explicit demonstration of their conductivity, as shown in Fig. 4(c). It is found that Sb2Te2Se has a transmission gap of 0.60 eV, which agrees well with the computed electronic gap of 0.61 eV at the PBE functional level. Specifically, the electron transmission at the bottom of the conduction band is smaller than that of the hole transmission at the top of the valence band. Next, we imagine a device where Sb2Te2X is directly exposed to a linearly polarized light normal to the Sb2Te2X surface and θ defines the polarization angle with respect to the zigzag direction. A small drain–source bias voltage of 0.2 V is applied to separate holes and electrons in opposite directions, thereby generating a photocurrent. Then, the θ and photon energy dependence of the photoresponse of Sb2Te2Se is obtained and presented in Fig. 4(d). The maximum photoresponse values can reach up to 0.042 and 0.044 A W−1 for Sb2Te2S and Sb2Te2Se, respectively, which outperform WSe2-based devices50 and are comparable to the photovoltaic systems constructed by Group-IV monochalcogenides.48 Besides, we found that the proposed devices possessed a larger photoresponse when θ = 0° and photon energy is lower than 2.0 eV. However, they behaved in an opposite manner under larger photon energy. This means that they are more sensitive to the light with the polarization direction along zigzag orientation under low power illumination but are prone to exhibit a larger response to the light with polarization parallel to the armchair direction in a high photon energy area. These results demonstrate that the Sb2Te2X-based devices present selective sensitivity relative to the polarization angle and photon energy, suggesting that Sb2Te2X can be a promising candidate not only for high-response light-harvesting applications but also for light-detecting applications.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, distinguished electronic, optical and transport properties of 2D Sb2Te2X were fully uncovered. The reported high stability, moderate band gaps, high isotropic electron mobility and remarkable optical properties analyzed in the current study firmly place Sb2Te2X in the realm of low-dimensional electronic and photovoltaic materials. We believe that our proposed 2D Sb2Te2X crystals satisfy highly desirable characteristics of next-generation electronic technology platforms and can be realized in the laboratory in the very near future. In a broader perspective, these discoveries can add an important branch to the family tree of 2D materials.
