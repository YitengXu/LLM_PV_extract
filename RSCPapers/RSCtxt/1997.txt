    , Accepted 2nd October 2012First published on 3rd October 2012AbstractA postsynthesis assembly approach, an ex situ ligand exchange route, was developed for fast (within 2 h) and high loading (34% coverage) deposition of CdSe QDs on TiO2 films. With the combination of high-quality QD sensitizers and the effective deposition technique, a record photovoltaic performance with an efficiency of 5.4% was observed for the resulting cell device.
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) constitute one of the most promising low cost candidates for the third-generation photovoltaics.1 Recently, one of the subjects investigated extensively is how to tether QD sensitizers onto a metal oxide matrix (mainly TiO2) to obtain a full monolayer of QDs on photoanodes. Two general approaches have been developed for tethering QDs onto TiO2 electrodes: (i) direct growth of QDs on TiO2 films2 and (ii) postsynthesis assembly using presynthesized QDs.3,4 The main-stream of the second approach, linker assisted assembly, is achieved by an in situ or ex situ ligand exchange route (simplified as in situ or ex situ route, respectively). In the in situ route, TiO2 films are first coated by linker molecules (typically mercaptopropionic acid, MPA), followed by exposing to QD dispersions for QDs assembly.3 In the ex situ route, the initial ligands are first replaced by linker molecules via ligand exchange and then the linker-capped QDs directly bind on the bare TiO2 surface.4
Parkinson et al. have demonstrated that the ex situ route is more effective than the in situ route in depositing preprepared QDs onto TiO2 single crystals.5 However, the photovoltaic performances of cell devices fabricated using the ex situ route4 are usually inferior to those of cell devices fabricated using the in situ method.3 Therefore, it is still a great challenge to obtain a high coverage of QDs on photoanodes and high photovoltaic performance in resulting cell devices via the ex situ route. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of the ex situ route in creating high coverage of QDs on TiO2 films using CdSe QDs as a model system. Experimental results show that deposition of QDs on TiO2 electrodes through the ex situ route can be finished in 2 h. Surface coverage of QDs on TiO2 films was as high as 34%. With the combination of the effective QD deposition technique and the high-quality preprepared QDs, the resulting CdSe based solar cells exhibit a record power conversion efficiency of 5.4% under full 1 sun illumination. To our knowledge, this result is one of the best performances of liquid junction QDSCs.
Detailed experimental procedures for fabrication, characterization of QD-sensitized electrodes and cell devices are available in the ESI.† In these experiments, 3.2–5.4 nm CdSe QDs with absorption onsets at 563–618 nm were selected as sensitizers to assemble on TiO2 electrodes for cell devices application. Experimental results show that the cell devices based on 5.4 nm QDs with absorption onset at 618 nm (denoted QD618) give the best photovoltaic performance. Hereafter, we use QD618 as a model to demonstrate the loading effect via the ex situ route. Fig. 1a shows the temporal evolution of absorption spectra with corresponding photographs of QD618 sensitized TiO2 films in the inset. The spectral profile of the colloidal QDs dispersion (Fig. S1, ESI†) was reserved and the sharp excitonic features were also retained after deposition on TiO2 films, reflecting an unchanged particle size and size distribution. This demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring and controlling the electronic and optical properties of QD sensitizers via the postsynthesis assembly approach. This paves the way for optimizing light harvesting, electron transfer, and charge recombination, and therefore improving the performance of the cell devices.6 In comparison, these features cannot be achieved by the direct growth of QDs.2

The deposition of CdSe QDs on a TiO2 electrode is very fast as inferred from the quick enhancement of absorbance (shown in Fig. 1a), which is also reflected by the quick deepening of the sensitized film color as shown in the inset of Fig. 1a. The temporal evolution of absorbance at the first absorption onset is illustrated in Fig. 1b. It was found that the absorbance (i.e. the loading amount of QDs) exhibited a linear dependence on the deposition time in the first 0.5 h. After that the increase rate of absorbance slowed down and the absorbance approached the saturation value of 1.42 in a period of 2 h. The obtained absorbance of 1.42 ensures absorption of more than 96% of the incident light at wavelengths below the onset. The 2 h deposition time gives a remarkable contrast to the much longer ones via the in situ route (usually 48–96 h).3b–d Besides QD618, different sized CdSe QDs can also be tethered effectively on TiO2 films via this ex situ route and the absorption spectra and corresponding photographs of sensitized TiO2 films are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
Achieving an effective coverage of photoanodes with QD sensitizers is critical for improving the performance of cell devices.17a Based on the measured absorbance integrated with the extinction coefficienct, the total surface area covered by the QDs would be 355 cm2. Meanwhile, the total inner surface area of the film is 1051 cm2 cm−2 of the projected area. Therefore, the QD coverage equals 34% (detailed calculations in ESI†), which is significantly greater than the reported values (14–20%) in previous reports.3d,e The high coverage of QDs on the TiO2 surface was also proved by the transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) results (Fig. S3, ESI†) and the Cd/Ti atomic ratio analyses as discussed below. To our knowledge, the observed 34% coverage is the ever reported highest result by the postsynthesis assembly approach.
Our success in achieving relatively high coverage of QDs on TiO2 films is partially benefited from the water-solubility of the adopted MPA-QDs, which facilitates high wettability and superior penetration capability into hydrophilic TiO2 films. Furthermore, the free carboxyl group around MPA-capped QDs provides the driving force for assembling QDs onto the TiO2 surface, which may behave just like Ru dye molecules commonly used in dye sensitized solar cells.7 The high QDs loading in our case is also benefited from the high colloidal stability of the resulting MPA-capped QDs since the weak capping capacity of the initial oleylamine capping ligand around hydrophobic QDs ensures the replacement by MPA molecules more completely in the phase transfer process.8
The uniform coverage of QDs along the TiO2 thickness is verified by the elemental analysis of different cross-section depths of the sensitized electrode using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) equipped on a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The typical SEM image of the cross section is shown in Fig. 2a, and the Cd/Ti atomic ratio dependent on the TiO2 film depth is illustrated in Fig. 2b with a typical EDS spectrum shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). A nearly constant Ti/Cd ratio of 0.21 throughout the entire TiO2 cross-section indicates homogeneous coverage of QDs on the TiO2 films. The observed Cd/Ti ratio of 0.21 is pronouncedly higher than the observed values (0.05–0.15) in previous reports.3e,9 The uniformity of deposition of QDs is further verified by observations that absorbance of QDs sensitized film is in linear relationship with thickness of the film and the photographs of the film from front and back sides show no difference (Fig. S5, ESI†).

After deposition of MPA-capped CdSe QDs for 2 h, a thin passivation layer of ZnS was deposited onto the sensitized electrodes as done in most cell devices, followed by sintering in a muffle-type oven with a temperature of 300 °C for 2.5 min under an air atmosphere. Sandwich-type thin layer cells were fabricated using the sintered FTO/TiO2/QDs as the photoanode, Cu2S on brass as the cathode, and a polysulfide electrolyte as the hole transporter. The J–V curves corresponding to cell devices sensitized by different sized CdSe QDs under the illumination of a solar simulator (AM 1.5 G) at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3a and the main photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. For the built cell devices, the photovoltaic parameters including Voc, Jsc, and η show a clear dependence on particle size of the QD sensitizer. With a red shift in first excitonic onset of the QD sensitizer, the corresponding Voc values decrease systematically from 589 to 561 mV, while the Jsc and η values increase from 11.41 to 16.96 mA cm−2 and 3.93% to 5.42%, respectively. The best photovoltaic performance with Jsc = 16.96 mA cm−2, Voc = 561 mV, fill factor (FF) = 0.57, and η = 5.4% was obtained from cell devices based on the QD618 sensitizer. The obtained 5.4% efficiency is believed to be one of the highest values in liquid junction QDSCs so far.

The success of the high photovoltaic performance of the QDSCs is mainly ascribed to the high coverage of QD sensitizers on the photoanode as described before. In order to investigate furthermore the origin of the obtained high Jsc value, the energy-conversion efficiency of QDSCs to monochromatic light irradiation was measured in terms of incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and the results are shown in Fig. 3b. For all QDSCs, the IPCE curves show similar behaviour and display a nearly rectangle shape in the photoresponse range. For all four sensitizers, the onset positions of the photocurrents in IPCE curves are well matched with those of the corresponding absorption spectra as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), and thus the onsets of the photocurrent shift to longer wavelengths for the larger sized sensitizers. The IPCE spectra exhibit a strong photoresponse over the whole visible spectra window with a value of ∼80% in the range between 350 and 650 nm for QD600 and QD618. From the spectra we can find that a wider response wavelength range is observed for the larger sized QD sensitizers. This is consistent with the variation trend of Jsc values observed in the J–V measurement. By integrating the product of the incident photon flux density and the cell's IPCE spectra,10 the calculated Jsc values for the four cells are: 10.65, 12.19, 13.61, 15.51 mA cm−2, respectively, which are quite close to the measured values shown in Table 1.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to elucidate charge recombination processes in cell devices. Fig. 4 shows Nyquist curves for QD563- and QD618-sensitized cells in the dark under a forward bias of −0.50 V. The displayed semicircle in the intermediate frequency region reflects the recombination processes in the QDSC, which is fitted by an equivalent circuit (the inset in Fig. 4). The extracted ohmic serial resistance (Rs), recombination resistance (Rr), chemical capacitance (Cμ), and electron lifetime (τn = Rr × Cμ) are listed in Table 2.6a In both cells, the recombination resistance Rr at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, which is the main recombination route for charge carriers,3f,6a shows values in the level of kΩ, which are remarkably greater than those observed in previous literature (360–555 Ω).2i,6a The observed high Rr value is mainly derived from high-quality CdSe QDs with fewer surface trap states, and high surface coverage of QD sensitizers on TiO2via the ex situ route and thus leaving a small proportion of area exposed to the electrolyte. This compact sensitizer layer alleviates the recombination of injected electrons and the redox couple.6a,11

In summary, CdSe QD-sensitized solar cells with record η value of 5.4% have been fabricated using the ex situ route. The high surface coverage (34%) and high efficiency (5.4%) of the resulting cell devices demonstrate the feasibility of the ex situ route in achieving high efficiency QDSCs. We believe that with the adoption of QDs with longer absorption wavelength (such as CdSexTe1−x, PbS etc.) QDSCs with efficiency over 6–7% can be achieved and this work is in progress.
