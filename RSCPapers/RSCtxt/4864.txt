1. Introduction
Most energy resources in current use, such as wood, water, wind and fossil fuels, are ultimately derived from the sun. Solar cells can directly convert solar energy into available electricity and are considered to be one of the most promising candidates to address the energy crisis and maintain the sustainable development of humans. Organic solar cells (OSCs) are highly competitive and are attracting much attention due to their advantages of light weight, mechanical flexibility, solution processing and large-area fabrication.1–6 Currently, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs are the most common type; they are based on a sandwiched structure with bicontinuous interpenetrating donor (D) and acceptor (A) domains in the active layer.7 For BHJ OSCs, the photoelectric conversion process includes four key steps: (1) light absorption and exciton generation; (2) exciton diffusion to the D/A interface; (3) exciton dissociation into free charge carriers; (4) charge transport and collection.8 All these steps occur in the active layer and are strongly related to the performance of the donor/acceptor materials. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is the overall parameter used to evaluate the performance of OSCs; it is a product of the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). The VOC is mainly determined by the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the acceptor. The JSC is dominated by the whole photoelectric conversion process, which strongly depends on the absorption, energy levels, molecular stacking and orientation, and miscibility of the active layer materials. The FF represents the diode characteristics of the device and is related to the charge transport and recombination in the active layer, which is closely related to the mobility and miscibility of the active layer materials. Therefore, it is crucial to develop high performance donor and acceptor materials to increase the advancement of OSCs.9–11
Over the last three decades, the PCE of OSCs has achieved a great increase from 1% to over 14%.12,13 This continuous and rapid improvement benefits from enhanced understanding of materials and device fundamentals. Interestingly, all record efficiencies in OSCs resulted from the development of donor materials at the first stage; to date, a PCE based on a polymer/fullerene system has achieved 11.7%.14–17 In contrast, there are fewer studies on acceptor materials. Fullerene derivatives, such as PCBM, were initially mainly employed as acceptors due to their merits: (1) good electron affinity for efficient exciton dissociation; (2) a unique spherical structure to facilitate isotropic charge transport; (3) high mobility to ensure rapid charge transport to the electrode; (4) proper miscibility with the donor to achieve a fine morphology.18 As a result, a series of fullerene acceptors were developed and used in OSCs.19–25 However, fullerene derivatives suffer from low extinction coefficients in the visible region, poor tunability of their energy levels, and limited scope for synthetic control over their structural properties; this limits the further development of OSCs. In view of these issues, scientists have begun to investigate non-fullerene acceptors due to their potential advantages of strong absorption in the visible region to harvest sunlight efficiently and promise high JSC, good energy level tunability to simultaneously achieve high VOC and efficient exciton dissociation, and facile chemical modification to optimize molecular assembly and miscibility with donors for high JSC and FF.26–29 As a result, many non-fullerene acceptors, including polymers30–36 and small molecules,37–44 have been developed. Small molecule acceptors (SMAs) have exact molecular structures and good crystallinity; thus, they have attracted much attention. Among these, perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives38–43 were initially widely used because their main bodies possess a large-plane conjugated structure for intense intermolecular interaction, strong absorption from 400 to 600 nm, and similar LUMO energy levels to PCBM. Unfortunately, the PCEs of OSCs based on these materials are mostly below 7%; this is mainly attributed to strong aggregation, which can cause severe phase separation, or low electron mobility for poor charge transport in the active layer, resulting in low JSC and FF.28,45 To explore the reasons for this phenomenon, some physical issues of SMA-based devices, such as molecular stacking, miscibility and morphology, have been carefully considered.46–49 As increasing numbers of studies on SMAs were conducted, the guidelines for high-performance SMAs became increasingly clear. The key barrier is simultaneously achieving high mobility and proper miscibility with donors.
In 2013, A–D–A SMAs began to emerge.50 These SMAs contain a ladder-type arene in the center and two compact, strongly electron-withdrawing structures at both ends (Fig. 1). A–D–A SMAs possess the following three traits: (1) the ladder-type arene affords a large-plane conjugated center to facilitate molecule packing and also acts as an electron-donating center to tune the energy levels and absorption; (2) the side chains, which are attached to the bridging-carbon atom and hang out of the molecular plane, not only ensure sufficient solubility for solution-processing but also inhibit excessive aggregation for fine morphology; (3) the compact electron-withdrawing structures at both ends enable intense intramolecular charge transfer, resulting in a low bandgap, and induce strong intermolecular interactions for J-aggregation and high electron mobility.51 Due to this unique structure, the morphologies of active layers based on A–D–A SMAs are significantly improved, and the JSC and FF of the devices are also remarkably enhanced. Thus, A–D–A SMAs have attracted much attention recently. Numerous high-efficiency A–D–A SMAs have been developed, and various approaches have also been employed to modify A–D–A SMAs and improve their photovoltaic performance, which has caused excitement in the OSC community.52 To date, the PCE of single-junction OSCs has dramatically increased to over 14% due to the rapid development of A–D–A SMAs.13 It is necessary to review these achievements and consider the superiorities/shortcomings of the reported A–D–A SMAs, which may aid their further development. In this review, we collect the recently reported A–D–A SMAs according to the ring number of the ladder-type arene in their centers; we also summarize their photovoltaic parameters and their evolution process, which affords an overview of A–D–A SMAs and aids a deeper understanding of these compounds. Finally, we summarize the chemical methods to modify A–D–A SMAs and propose possible future research directions.

2. A–D–A SMAs with ladder-type arenes
2.1 A–D–A SMAs with tricyclic arenes
Tricyclic arenes were the first ladder-type donor units employed in A–D–A SMAs. They mainly contain fluorene,50,53–56 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene56–58 and 4H-indeno[1,2-b]thiophene.57 The selection of end groups for fabricating A–D–A SMAs has attracted considerable attention; 1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione, 3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one and thiobarbituric acid were initially employed as end groups (Fig. 2).50,53 Unfortunately, SMAs based on these end groups all suffered from relatively large bandgaps (≧2.0 eV), mainly due to the insufficient electron-withdrawing capacity of the end groups (Table 1). Taking Flu-RH as an example, the optical bandgap of Flu-RH is 2.05 eV; meanwhile, it has a high LUMO energy level of −3.53 eV, which contributes to a high VOC (1.03 V). However, P3HT:Flu-RH solar cells suffer from a low JSC of 5.70 mA cm−2, mainly due to their limited absorption. As a result, P3HT:Flu-RH solar cells afforded a PCE of 3.08%. Later, McCulloch et al. synthesized FBR via inserting a benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole unit between fluorene and rhodamine to improve the electron-withdrawing capacity (Fig. 2).54 Surprisingly, FBR has an optical bandgap of 2.14 eV, larger than that of its analogue, Flu-RH. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of FBR are −5.70/−3.57 eV, respectively, which are both deeper than those of Flu-RH. However, the JSC and FF values of FBR-based devices were higher than those of Flu-RH based devices (7.95 mA cm−2vs. 5.70 mA cm−2; 63% vs. 52%), which is probably due to their improved morphology for better exciton dissociation and charge transport. As a result, the P3HT:FBR solar cells afforded a higher PCE of 4.11%. In addition, it was found that charge generation and recombination in P3HT:FBR solar cells are faster than those in P3HT:PCBM solar cells due to the better miscibility of FBR with the donor. These results implied that inserting benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole between the donor unit and acceptor unit of SMAs increases the energy levels and improves intermolecular interaction with donors, while having little effect on the optical bandgap. 2-(2,3-Dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile, with two cyanogroups, has stronger electron-withdrawing capacity than 1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione and is promising to decrease the bandgap of SMAs. Chen et al. employed it as an end group to develop DICTF (Fig. 2).55 Compared with F8IDT, the absorption of DICTF shows a remarkable redshift, with the maximum absorption peak at 624 nm, due to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer. The optical bandgap of DICTF decreases to 1.82 eV, as expected, with HOMO and LUMO energy levels located at −5.67 and −3.79 eV, respectively. The PTB7-Th:DICTF solar cell afforded a PCE of 7.93%, which was comparable to that of PTB7-Th:PC71BM solar cells (8.28%). Therefore, 2-(2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile exhibits the best performance as an end group due to its strong electron-withdrawing capacity, resulting in a reduced bandgap, and its compact structure for molecular packing.

On the other hand, the donor core in the center has also attracted much attention. Because silicon has a larger atomic radius than carbon, replacing the bridge carbon atom with silicon compels the side chains to move away from the molecular backbone of SMAs and benefits molecular packing for better charge transport. Bhosale et al. employed 5H-dibenzo[b,d]silole as the donor core and synthesized N5 (Fig. 2).59 The optical bandgap of N5 is about 2.20 eV, which is larger than that of F8IDT; this demonstrates that replacing the bridge carbon atom with silicon leads to an absorption blueshift of SMA. Also, the LUMO energy level of N5 is increased to −3.64 eV compared with F8IDT. As a result, P3HT:N5 solar cells afforded a PCE of 2.76% with higher VOC and JSC. Thiophene has stronger electron-donating capacity than benzene. Thus, replacing a phenyl in the donor unit with a thienyl group can enhance its electron-donating capability. Zheng et al. replaced fluorene in DICTF with indenothiophene and cyclopentadithiophene to synthesize ITDI and CDTDI, respectively (Fig. 2).57 The optical bandgaps of ITDI and CDTDI are 1.53 eV and 1.36 eV, respectively, which are much smaller than that of DICTF (1.82 eV). The HOMO energy levels of ITDI and CDTDI are −5.89 and −5.75 eV, respectively, while the LUMO energy levels of ITDI and CDTDI are −4.18 and −4.26 eV, respectively. This demonstrates that replacing phenyls with thienyl groups is an effective method to decrease the bandgap of SMAs and bring their HOMO/LUMO energy levels closer together. PBDB-T:ITDI solar cells afforded a decent PCE of 8.00% with a VOC of 0.92 V, a JSC of 13.89 mA cm−2 and an FF of 57.66%; meanwhile, the PCE of PBDB-T:CDTDI solar cells is only 2.75%. The HOMO energy levels between CDTDI and PBDB-T are too close, resulting in inefficient hole transfer from CDTDI to PBDB-T and inferior performance. Therefore, matching of the energy levels should be carefully taken into consideration when choosing donors and/or SMAs. In addition, an SMA, DF-PCIC, was reported with an unfused-ring core containing two cyclopentadithiophene moieties and one 2,5-difluorobenzene group (Fig. 2).58 DF-PCIC can realize a nearly planar geometry via introducing F⋯H noncovalent interactions. The optical bandgap of DF-PCIC is 1.59 eV, and the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of DF-PCIC are −3.77 and −5.49 eV, respectively; these values are close to those of the classical SMA, ITIC (Fig. 6). By blending with PBDB-T, the solar cells afforded a high PCE of 10.14% with a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 15.66 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.72. In addition, the PBDB-T:DF-PCIC solar cells could retain ≈70% of the original PCE upon thermal treatment at 180 °C for 12 h due to the unfused-ring core of DF-PCIC. As a result, locking small building blocks via noncovalent interactions is an efficient method to achieve high performance SMAs.
Overall, SMAs with tricyclic arenes are often facile to synthesize, which benefits their practical application. On the other hand, the optical bandgaps of SMAs with tricyclic arenes are relatively large, which may be a bottleneck for further improvements in PCE. Therefore, it is important to find an efficient strategy to decrease the bandgaps of tricyclic arene-based SMAs without sacrificing other parameters in the next step.
2.2 A–D–A SMAs with tetracyclic arenes
Studies on SMAs with tetracyclic arenes are rare, probably because the synthesis of tetracyclic arenes is relatively difficult. To date, only two SMAs with tetracyclic arenes have been reported.60,61 Zhu et al. synthesized an SMA, NITI, with a donor unit containing one tetracyclic arene, a 5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-a]indene moiety, and two thieno[3,4-b]thiophene groups (Fig. 3).60 The optical bandgap of NITI is 1.49 eV, with the maximum absorption peak at 762 nm; this forms a perfect complementary absorption with PBDB-T. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for NITI are −5.68 and −3.84 eV, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO offsets between NITI and PBDB-T are 0.35 and 0.92 eV, respectively, which can provide sufficient driving force for efficient charge separation. Finally, the PBDB-T:NITI solar cells afforded a high PCE of 12.74% with a VOC of 0.86 V, a noticeable JSC of 20.67 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71%. Soon afterwards, they reported another SMA, NSTI, obtained via replacing 5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-a]indene in NITI with 3,8-difluoro-5,10-dihydrobenzo[b]benzo[4,5]silolo[2,3-d]silole (Fig. 3).61 The optical bandgap of NSTI is 1.58 eV, which is larger than that of NITI; this also demonstrates that replacing the bridge carbon atom with silicon leads to a blueshift of the SMA absorption. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of NSTI are −5.54 and −3.87 eV, respectively. With PBDB-T as a donor, solar cells afforded a PCE of 10.33% with a remarkable FF of 75.2% due to the strong crystallinity, close π–π stacking and balanced hole/electron mobility of PBDB-T. In a word, SMAs with tetracyclic arenes exhibit tremendous potential in photovoltaic performance. More effort should be made to develop new tetracyclic arenes and construct A–D–A SMAs, which will increase the diversity of the SMA community and help to achieve higher PCEs for OSCs.

2.3 A–D–A SMAs with pentacyclic arenes
Pentacyclic arenes are one of the most widely used and investigated fused-ring donor cores in SMAs to date.62–85 In 2015, Zhan et al. reported an SMA, DC-IDT2T, based on indacenodithiophene (IDT) (Fig. 4).62 Its optical bandgap is 1.55 eV, with a high extinction coefficient; its HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.43 eV and −3.85 eV, respectively (Table 2). By blending with PBDTTT-C-T, solar cells afforded a considerable PCE of 3.93%. Then, they synthesized IEIC by attaching a 2-ethylhexyl group to the thiophene bridge to optimize the miscibility with the donor (Fig. 4).63 The optical bandgap and energy levels of IEIC are all close to those of DC-IDT2T, indicating that inserting an alkyl chain has negligible effects on these properties. However, the IEIC-based solar cells achieved a much higher JSC (13.55 mA cm−2 for IEIC vs. 8.33 mA cm−2 for DC-IDT2T) due to their improved miscibility for better charge dissociation. On the other hand, the FF of the IEIC-based solar cells decreased to 48% because the alkyl chains disturbed the molecular planarity of IEIC and reduced the electron mobility (1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IEIC vs. 2.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DC-IDT2T). As a result, the PTB7-Th:IEIC solar cells afforded a higher PCE of 6.31%. Soon afterwards, 4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]bis(selenophene) was also employed as a donor unit to fabricate IDSe-T-IC (Fig. 4).64 Its optical bandgap and energy levels are similar to those of IEIC. Solar cells using J51 as the donor afforded a PCE of 8.6%. The oxyalkyl chain shows strong electron-donating capacity via conjugation effects. Hou et al. developed IEICO by substituting the alkyl chain in IEIC with an oxyalkyl chain to improve the electron-donating capacity of the donor moiety (Fig. 4).65 As a result, the optical bandgap decreased to 1.34 eV, mainly due to an increase of the HOMO energy level (from −5.47 eV for IEIC to −5.32 eV for IEICO). By blending with PBDTTT-E-T, solar cells afforded a PCE of 8.4% with a high JSC of 17.7 mA cm−2. In addition, the energy loss for the devices was as low as 0.52 eV. Subsequently, they further introduced a halogen atom (Cl or F) in the end group to enhance its electron-withdrawing capacity and improve intramolecular charge transfer, thus decreasing the bandgaps of SMAs (IEICO-4Cl and IEICO-4F, shown in Fig. 4).66,67 Consequently, the optical bandgaps of IEICO-4Cl and IEICO-4F are only 1.23 and 1.24 eV, respectively, mainly due to their downshifted LUMO energy levels (−4.23 eV for IEICO-4Cl and −4.19 eV for IEICO-4F). After selecting donors, the IEICO-4Cl and IEICO-4F based solar cells afforded the best PCEs of 10.3% and 10.9% (certified PCE: 10.6%), respectively, with high JSC values (22.8 mA cm−2 for IEICO-4Cl and 25.3 mA cm−2 for IEICO-4F). IEICO-4Cl and IEICO-4F both show great potential in tandem solar cells and semitransparent OSCs due to their narrow bandgaps and high performance. Li et al. synthesized SJ-IC by introducing a double bond π-bridge into IDT-IC to extend its conjugated length (Fig. 4).68 Compared with IDT-IC, the absorption spectrum of SJ-IC exhibits a 57 nm redshift with an absorption onset at 833 nm. The HOMO level of SJ-IC is upshifted by 0.08 eV, while the LUMO is downshifted by 0.06 eV. Compared with J61:IDT-IC solar cells (PCE = 6.95%), J61:SJ-IC solar cells afforded a higher PCE of 9.27% with improved JSC (16.99 mA cm−2) and FF (65.95%) due to its red-shifted absorption, improved electron mobility and tuned crystallinity. Similarly, Zhu et al. introduced quinoidal resonance via inserting a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene block in IDT-IC to extend the π-conjugation through the backbone; the developed compound was named ATT-2 (Fig. 4).69 As a result, the optical bandgap of ATT-2 significantly decreased to 1.32 eV, with a downshifted LUMO energy level and upshifted HOMO energy level. By blending with PTB7-Th, solar cells based on ATT-2 achieved a PCE of 9.58% with a high JSC of 22.75 mA cm−2. Therefore, introducing an oxyalkyl chain into the donor unit, attaching an electron-withdrawing group to the end group, and inserting a double bond π-bridge or quinoidal resonance structure are all efficient approaches to reduce the bandgaps of SMAs for improved JSC.

Early reported SMAs with IDT used four 4-hexylphenyl groups substituted on the bridge carbon in the cyclopentadienyl moieties. The alkylaryl side chains close to the molecular skeleton are rather bulky and disturb the molecular packing. Using more flexible aliphatic side chains attached to the bridge carbon is a rational approach to relieve this issue and improve intermolecular interaction for high electron mobility. Then, an asymmetric-side-chain SMA, IDT-OB, was developed via substituting two 4-hexylphenyls in IDT-2B with octyl groups (Fig. 4).70 Compared with IDT-2B, IDT-OB exhibits a smaller bandgap of 1.66 eV with a slightly deeper LUMO energy level of −3.87 eV. The PBDB-T:IDT-OB solar cells afforded a much higher PCE of 10.12%, with higher JSC (16.18 mA cm−2) and FF (71.1%), due to its ideal nanoscale phase separation and higher electron mobility (2.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDT-OB vs. 1.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDT-2B). In addition, IDT-OB can maintain a high PCE of 9.17% even in thick-film OSCs (>200 nm). Zhan et al. further reported an SMA, IDIC, with four hexyl side chains (Fig. 4).71,72 Compared with IDT-IC, the absorption of IDIC shows a 28 nm redshift with a slightly deeper LUMO energy level, as with IDT-OB above. By blending with PDBT-T1, the IDIC-based solar cells afforded a higher PCE of 9.20% with a JSC of 15.85 mA cm−2 and an FF of 68% due to the more ordered molecular packing and enhanced electron mobility (2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Then, they further selected a series of polymer donors with different structures to fabricate OSCs with IDIC; the PCEs of these cells improved to over 13% (certified PCE: 13.03%).83 Also, they found that donor materials should possess complementary absorption, matched energy levels and proper compatibility with SMAs to achieve high efficiency.73 Additionally, Zhang et al. employed a deep HOMO and a high crystallinity polymer donor, PM6, to fabricate OSCs with IDIC. The PM6:IDIC solar cells achieved a high PCE of 11.9% due to their complementary absorption spectra, matched energy levels and good phase separation morphology.74 In addition, the PM6:IDIC solar cells are insensitive to the active layer thickness (≈95 to 255 nm) and device area (0.20 to 0.81 cm2), with PCEs of over 11%. On the other hand, enhancing the interaction of the end groups can also promote molecular π–π stacking to achieve higher mobility. Hou et al. synthesized IDTN by developing a π-conjugation-extended end group, 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalen-1-ylidene)malononitrile (Fig. 4).75 Benefitting from the extension of π-conjugation by fusing two phenyls, IDTN shows stronger intermolecular interactions and more ordered molecular packing, thus achieving much higher electron mobility relative to IDT-IC (7.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDTN; 3.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDT-IC). As a result, the PM6:IDTN solar cells achieved a higher PCE of 12.2% with an excellent FF of 78%. Overall, replacing alkylaryl groups with aliphatic side chains and extending the conjugated areas of the end groups are both efficient strategies to improve the intermolecular interaction and molecular packing of SMAs, thus enhancing their electron mobility for high JSC and FF.
In addition to 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile, other electron-withdrawing structures have also been used in SMAs with pentacyclic arenes. In 2015, Zhan et al. synthesized IDT-2BR by employing a combination of benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one as the end groups (Fig. 4).76 The optical bandgap of IDT-2BR is 1.68 eV, which is slightly smaller than that of IDT-IC. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of IDT-2BR were estimated to be −5.52 eV and −3.69 eV, respectively. The P3HT:IDT-2BR solar cells afforded a considerable PCE of 5.12%, which was higher than that of a P3HT:PC61BM system (3.71%), due to the increased VOC (0.84 V).76a They further used PTB7-Th as a donor to fabricate PTB7-Th:IDT-2BR:PDI-2DTT-based ternary solar cells; the PCE improved to over 10%, with a small energy loss (0.55 eV) and high VOC (>1 V).76b McCulloch et al. substituted the 4-hexylphenyl group in IDT-2BR with n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl groups to synthesize O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR, respectively (Fig. 4).77 The optical bandgap of EH-IDTBR is almost the same as that of IDT-2BR, while the absorption maximum of O-IDTBR shows a 40 nm redshift with a smaller bandgap of 1.63 eV due to its enhanced π–π stacking. Compared with IDT-2BR solar cells, O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR solar cells achieved much higher JSC (13.9 mA cm−2 for O-IDTBR and 12.1 mA cm−2 for EH-IDTBR) due to their ordered molecular packing and improved morphologies. As a result, the P3HT:O-IDT2BR-based solar cells afforded the best PCE of 6.4% (PCE = 6.0 ± 0.05% for P3HT:EH-IDTBR). Soon afterwards, they developed a wide bandgap SMA, IDFBR (Fig. 4), with a similar chemical structure to O-IDT2BR; IDFBR was then used as the ternary compound in P3HT:O-IDTBR solar cells.78 Ternary solar cells based on P3HT:O-IDTBR:IDFBR (1:0.7:0.3) achieved an improved PCE of 7.7% because O-IDTBR and IDFBR formed an alloy to improve the morphology for reduced charge recombination with higher JSC and FF (JSC = 14.4 mA cm−2; FF = 0.64) and to enhance the VOC from 0.72 V to 0.82 V. In addition, 2-(3-ethyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile was adopted as an end group to synthesize SMA ATT-1 (Fig. 4).79 The optical bandgap of ATT-1 is 1.54 eV, which is larger than that of ATT-2, due to the weaker electron-withdrawing capacity of 2-(3-ethyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile. As a result, the LUMO energy level of ATT-1 is increased to −3.63 eV. The PTB7-Th:ATT-1 solar cells achieved a higher PCE of 10.07% with enhanced VOC (0.87 V) compared with those of PTB7-Th:ATT-2 solar cells. Therefore, 2-(3-ethyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile, and the combination of benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one are also excellent candidates as end groups for high-performance SMAs.
Recently, scientists have made efforts to develop new pentacyclic building blocks to construct SMAs. Ding et al. used a “carbon–oxygen (CO) bridge” to replace the carbon bridge to synthesize a new ladder-type unit, 5,11-dihydrothieno[2′,3′:5,6]pyrano[3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]isochromene, called CO5IC (Fig. 4).80 The insertion of an electron-rich oxygen atom improves the electron-donating capability of the donor core via conjugation effects. As a result, the optical bandgap of CO5IC is 0.08 eV smaller than that of IDT-IC (1.62 eV for CO5IC vs. 1.70 eV for IDT-IC), mainly resulting from the deeper LUMO energy level of CO5IC (−4.13 eV). Using PBDB-T as a donor, CO5IC-based solar cells afforded a higher PCE of 7.49%, with enhanced JSC (13.31 mA cm−2) and FF (67.9%) relative to IDT-IC based solar cells. The improvements in JSC and FF were ascribed to the smaller bandgap and higher electron mobility of CO5IC. Subsequently, an isomer containing an oxygen atom, 4,10-dihydrothieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrano[2,3-g]thieno[3,2-c]chromene, was developed to synthesize NBDTP with alkyl chains (Fig. 4).81 The optical bandgap of NBDTP is 1.58 eV, which is close to that of CO5IC. However, the LUMO energy level of NBDTP is much higher than that of CO5IC (−3.79 eV for NBDTP vs. −4.13 eV for CO5IC). As a result, the PBDB-T:NBDTP solar cells achieved a PCE of 10.1% with a higher VOC (0.942 V). Oxa-pentacyclic arenes possess great potential in SMAs due to their stronger electron-donating capacity for smaller bandgaps and extended π-conjugation structures for improved molecular packing compared with IDT.
Overall, SMAs with pentacyclic arenes have been widely investigated and exhibit excellent photovoltaic performance after careful optimization of their molecular structures (Table 2). Decreasing the optical bandgaps of these SMAs and decreasing Eloss (Eloss = Eg − eVOC) would help to further improve their PCEs.
2.4 A–D–A SMAs with hexacyclic arenes
Some hexacyclic arenes, such as naphthalene(cyclopentadithiophene), have been recently applied to build A–D–A SMAs; the resulting solar cells afforded considerable PCEs.86–89 Chen et al. reported four SMAs, NTIC, NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F, using naphthalene(cyclopentadithiophene) as their central units (Fig. 5).86 Their photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 3. Taking NTIC-Me as an example, it has an optical bandgap of 1.74 eV, which is similar to that of IDT-2B.70 However, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of NTIC-Me are higher than those of IDT-2B (−5.53 eV/−3.73 eV for NTIC-Me vs. −5.80 eV/−3.84 eV for IDT-2B), indicating that replacing phenyl with naphthyl in the donor unit can increase the energy levels of SMAs. As a result, the PBDB-T:NTIC-Me solar cells afforded a higher PCE of 8.30% with a higher VOC (0.963 V). The isomer of naphthalene(cyclopentadithiophene) was developed via changing the orientation of cyclopentadiene to synthesize DTNIC6 and DTNIC8 with aliphatic chains (Fig. 5).87 The optical bandgaps and energy levels of DTNIC6 and DTNIC8 are very close to each other. However, the PBDB-T:DTNIC8 solar cells achieved a much higher PCE of 9.03% compared with PBDB-T:DTNIC6 solar cells (PCE = 3.39%), with a JSC of 12.92 mA cm−2 and an FF of 72.84%. The higher JSC and FF for PBDB-T:DTNIC8 solar cells are due to their better morphology for efficient exciton dissociation, reduced bimolecular recombination, and enhanced and balanced charge carrier mobilities. Therefore, the length of the side chains has little effect on the absorption and energy levels of SMAs but plays an important role in their morphology and photovoltaic performance. Soon afterwards, Zhan and Marder et al. developed IHIC-N, another isomer of naphthalene(cyclopentadithiophene), via changing the position of cyclopentadiene from a 1,2,5,6-substitution pattern to 2,3,6,7-substitution (Fig. 5).88 The optical bandgap of IHIC-N (1.66 eV) is close to that of DTNIC8. Solar cells using PTB7-Th as the donor afforded a PCE of 6.91%. In addition, they developed another SMA with a hexacyclic arene, IHIC, via replacing the naphthyl in IHIC-N with a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene structure (Fig. 5).89 Compared with IHIC-N, the optical bandgap of IHIC dramatically decreases to 1.38 eV, with an upshifted HOMO energy level (−5.45 eV) and downshifted LUMO energy level (−3.93 eV). In view of the strong absorption in the NIR region for IHIC, they used PTB7-Th as a donor to fabricate a semitransparent OSC. The device showed an average visible transmittance of 36% and achieved a PCE of 9.77% with a high JSC of 19.01 mA cm−2. Because of the similar structures and complementary absorptions of IHIC and IHIC-N, a ternary solar cell, PTB7-Th:IHIC-N:IHIC, was fabricated; its PCE improved to 11.9%, with balanced carrier mobilities and favorable domain sizes.88 To date, the PCE of OSCs based on SMAs with hexacyclic arenes is still not high enough. The physical parameters of hexacyclic arene-based SMAs, such as solubility, molecular packing and intermolecular interaction with the donor, should be comprehensively and carefully taken into consideration to improve the photovoltaic performance.

2.5 A–D–A SMAs with heptacyclic arenes
SMAs with heptacyclic arenes are the most widely used and investigated non-fullerene acceptors.90–107 In 2015, Zhan et al. developed an SMA, ITIC, with an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IT) unit as the donor core and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile as the end group (Fig. 6).90 ITIC possesses strong absorption from 550 to 780 nm with a bandgap of 1.59 eV, and its HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.48 and −3.83 eV, respectively (Table 4). The PTB7-Th:ITIC solar cell afforded a PCE of 6.8%, which is comparable with the PTB7-Th:PCBM system; this caused excitement in the OSC community and led to ITIC becoming the benchmark material in SMAs. Because the absorption of ITIC is weak at short wavelengths, a wide bandgap polymer, PBDB-T, was used as a donor to enable complementation.91 As a result, the PBDB-T:ITIC solar cell achieved a higher PCE of 11.2% (certified PCE: 10.78%) with an increased JSC of 16.80 mA cm−2 and a noticeable FF of 0.742. Soon afterwards, a series of chemical approaches were developed to modify ITIC and improve its photovoltaic performance. The 4-hexylphenyl group of ITIC was replaced by 5-hexylthienyl to synthesize ITIC-Th and introduce sulfur–sulfur interactions to facilitate π–π stacking and charge transport (Fig. 6).92 ITIC-Th shows decreased d-spacing (3.5 Å for ITIC-Th; 3.8 Å for ITIC) and increased coherence length (5.5 nm for ITIC-Th; 2.4 nm for ITIC) of π–π stacking, which helps to achieve higher electron mobility (6.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ITIC-Th vs. 2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ITIC). Therefore, PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th solar cells afforded a higher PCE of 8.7%, with an enhanced JSC of 15.93 mA cm−2 and an FF of 68%. In addition, an ITIC-Th-based solar cell using a wide bandgap polymer, PDBT-T1, as the donor achieved an improved PCE of 9.6% (certified PCE: 9.3%). Li et al. changed the hexyl group on the phenyl of ITIC from the para-position to the meta-position to prepare the isomer m-ITIC (Fig. 6).93 Compared with ITIC, m-ITIC exhibits improved crystallinity and higher electron mobility (2.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). By using J61 as donor, the PCE of solar cells was enhanced from 10.57% (ITIC) to 11.77% (m-ITIC), with higher JSC and FF. Recently, Heeney et al. employed n-octyl groups as side chains to synthesize C8-ITIC (Fig. 6).97 C8-ITIC shows slightly redshifted absorption and a higher absorption coefficient relative to ITIC. Likewise, the flexible alkyl chain improves the crystallinity of C8-ITIC, which facilitates charge transport and reduces charge recombination in OSCs. As a result, the PFBDB-T:C8-ITIC solar cells achieved a higher PCE of 13.2%, with enhanced JSC and FF. To increase the LUMO energy level, an electron-rich methyl group was substituted onto the end group of ITIC to decrease its electron-withdrawing capability; the two resulting SMAs were called IT-M and IT-DM (Fig. 6).94 The LUMO energy levels of IT-M and IT-DM increased by 0.04 and 0.09 eV, respectively, while the absorption spectra of IT-M and IT-DM showed slight blueshifts of 6 and 14 nm, respectively. The PBDB-T:IT-M solar cells afforded a higher PCE of 12.05% with enhanced VOC and JSC due to their increased LUMO energy levels, better exciton dissociation and less bimolecular recombination. Because a sulfur atom is more readily polarized compared to a carbon atom due to its more loosely held electrons, a thiophene-containing conjugated molecule usually has stronger intermolecular π–π interactions compared with a benzene-based structure. In addition, the stronger electron-donating capacity of thiophene could result in an upshifted LUMO for SMAs. Therefore, the phenyl in the end group of ITIC was replaced with a thienyl to synthesize ITCC (Fig. 6).96 As a result, ITCC has a larger bandgap of 1.67 eV with a higher LUMO energy level (−3.76 eV) and possesses a closer π–π stacking distance with a higher mobility of 9.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, the PBDB-T:ITCC solar cells achieved a better PCE of 11.4%. Fluorine is the smallest electron-withdrawing group, with a van der Waals radius of 1.35 Å; introducing fluorine does not induce steric hindrance or disturb molecular packing. It is also the most electronegative element and can enhance the electron-withdrawing capabilities of the end groups to decrease the bandgap. In addition, fluorine can improve intermolecular interactions for higher mobility via C–F⋯S, C–F⋯H and C–F⋯π interactions. Therefore, ITIC-Th1 was developed via introducing F atoms in the end groups of ITIC-Th (Fig. 6).51 ITIC-Th1 affords a smaller bandgap of 1.55 eV (1.60 eV for ITIC-Th) and higher mobility (7.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). By using FTAZ as a donor, ITIC-Th1-based solar cells achieved a better PCE of 12.1%, with much higher JSC and FF. Hou et al. also synthesized IT-4F by substituting the end groups with four F atoms (Fig. 6).95 Compared with ITIC, IT-4F possesses deeper HOMO/LUMO energy levels (−5.66/−4.14 eV) and a smaller optical bandgap. With a deep HOMO polymer PBDB-T-SF as the donor, the IT-4F based solar cells achieved a noble PCE of 13.0% (certified PCE: 13.1%) with a high JSC (20.50 mA cm−2).
 Fig. 6  Chemical structures of SMAs with heptacyclic arenes. 
In addition to IT units, other seven fused-ring donor units have been used in A–D–A SMAs and have achieved high photovoltaic performance. Chen et al. synthesized NFBDT by changing the bridge carbon position to develop an isomer of IT, benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene), as the core unit (Fig. 6).98 The optical bandgap and HOMO/LUMO energy levels of NFBDT are all close to those of ITIC. The PBDB-T:NFBDT solar cells afforded a high PCE of 10.42%. Interestingly, benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) retains two easily modified sites on the phenyl group and offers an opportunity to investigate the effects of side chains on the photovoltaic performance of SMAs. Electron-donating groups, such as conjugated side chains,99 oxyalkyl chains100 and alkyl groups,101 have all been used to substitute these positions. They can increase the energy level of SMAs to decrease the bandgap, enhance the extinction coefficient and improve the molecular packing for better morphology, thus achieving higher JSC and PCE for SMA-based solar cells. For example, Zhan et al. developed ITIC2 by attaching a conjugated side chain, 5-(2-ethylhexyl)thienyl, to benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) (Fig. 6).99 Compared with NFBDT, ITIC2 exhibits a slightly smaller bandgap (1.53 eV) and higher LUMO energy level (−3.80 eV) due to the electron-donating nature of the thiophene side chain. By using FTAZ as a donor, the PCE of ITIC2-based solar cells reached 11.0%, which is much higher than that of NFBDT-based solar cells (8.54%), due to the higher electron mobility and improved morphology of the FTAZ:ITIC2 blend film. Chen et al. developed FDICTF by fusing fluorene with the adjacent thiophene units of DICTF to obtain a heptacyclic core (Fig. 6).102 FDICTF possesses a smaller bandgap of 1.63 eV, with increased energy levels (HOMO = −5.43 eV, LUMO = −3.71 eV) relative to DICTF. The electron mobility of FDICTF also increased to 2.40 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, the PBDB-T:FDICTF solar cells afforded a much higher PCE of 10.06%, with enhanced JSC and FF compared with PBDB-T:DICTF solar cells (5.93%). Therefore, fusing the donor core is an efficient strategy to reduce the bandgaps and improve the mobility of SMAs for high photovoltaic performance. In addition, a new heptacyclic heteroarene, indacenodibenzothiophene (IDBT), was developed via replacing the thienyls in IT with phenyls to synthesize NIDBT (Fig. 6).103 Compared with the classical ITIC, NIDBT has a wider bandgap of 1.84 eV, with downshifted energy levels (HOMO = −5.87 eV, LUMO = −3.91 eV); this is ascribed to the weaker electron-donating capability of IDBT. The PTB7-Th:IDBT solar cells afforded an inferior PCE of 4.45%.
In brief, heptacyclic arene-based acceptors are the classical A–D–A SMAs. Various strategies have been developed to optimize the bandgaps, energy levels, molecular packing, and mobilities of SMAs with heptacyclic arenes, and their PCEs have been improved to over 13%.97 However, most of these SMAs currently suffer from relatively wide bandgaps or large Eloss values. Therefore, exploring an efficient method to reduce the bandgaps and/or optimize the energy levels of heptacyclic arene-based SMAs will help to achieve breakthroughs in efficiency.

2.6 A–D–A SMAs with octacyclic arenes
Octacyclic arenes have attracted considerable attention and have recently been applied to construct SMAs.108–111 Zhan et al. developed an octacyclic building block (NTT) via fusing naphthalene with two cyclopentadienylthiophenes and used it to fabricate IOIC2 (Fig. 7).108 Compared with IHIC2, IOIC2 has a smaller optical bandgap of 1.55 eV with increased energy levels (HOMO = −5.41 eV, LUMO = −3.78 eV) due to the stronger electron-donating capability of NTT (Table 5). In addition, IOIC2 shows a higher electron mobility of 6.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is ascribed to its larger NTT core for improved intermolecular interaction. Thus, the FTAZ:IOIC2 solar cells achieved a much higher PCE of 12.3% with improved VOC (0.900 V), JSC (19.7 mA cm−2) and FF (69.3%). Therefore, π-extension of the donor core can contribute to decreased bandgaps, increased HOMO/LUMO energy levels and enhanced mobility for SMAs, thus achieving higher efficiency for SMA-based solar cells. They further synthesized FOIC by fusing three thieno[3,2-b]thiophene to develop 3TT (Fig. 7).109 Compared with ITIC3, the optical bandgap of FOIC dramatically decreases to 1.32 eV, mainly due to the stronger electron-donating capacity of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene for an increased HOMO (−5.36 eV) energy level. The PTB7-Th:FOIC solar cells achieved a PCE of 12.0% with a high JSC of 24.0 mA cm−2; the PCE is much higher than that of PTB7-Th:ITIC3 solar cells (PCE = 8.09%). In addition, efficiencies of over 10% can be retained with a thickness of 50 to 200 nm due to the high absorption coefficient and mobility of FOIC. Ding et al. developed an octacyclic arene with a carbon–oxygen bridge, COi8, to prepare COi8DFIC (Fig. 7).110 Similarly, COi8DFIC exhibits an ultra-narrow bandgap of 1.26 eV, with strong absorption at 600 to 1000 nm. The PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC binary solar cells afforded a PCE of 12.16% with a high JSC of 26.12 mA cm−2. Furthermore, they used PC71BM as a third compound to improve the electron mobility and morphology of the active layer.13 As a result, the PCE of ternary solar cells PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:PC71BM (1:1.05:0.45) significantly increased to over 14%, with a record JSC of 28.20 mA cm−2 and an improved FF of 71.0%.

Although studies on A–D–A SMAs with octacyclic arenes are relatively rare, a series of excellent results have been obtained. Octacyclic arenes are endowed with large conjugated skeletons and strong electron-donating capacities, which can increase intermolecular interactions, enhance energy levels and decrease the bandgaps of SMAs, thus benefitting the JSC and PCE of OSCs based on these arenes (Table 5). Therefore, more effort should be made to develop SMAs with octacyclic arenes to achieve greater breakthroughs.
2.7 A–D–A SMAs with polycyclic arenes
In general, the electron-donating capabilities of fused-ring arenes improve as the ring number of the arene increases, which helps to reduce the optical bandgap and increase the energy levels of SMAs for high JSC and VOC in solar cells. Furthermore, the large-plane conjugated structure of polycyclic arenes can enhance their intermolecular interactions and benefit π–π stacking, thus achieving high electron mobility for SMAs. Therefore, considerable attention has been paid to develop A–D–A SMAs with polycyclic arenes.112–115 Zhan et al. developed a nonacyclic arene, indacenobis(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene), and fluorinated 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile to prepare four SMAs, INIC, INIC1, INIC2 and INIC3 (Fig. 8).112 The optical bandgaps of INIC, INIC1, INIC2, and INIC3 decreased from 1.57 to 1.48 eV along with a decreased LUMO energy level from −3.88 to −4.02 eV due to the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine. With FTAZ as a donor, INIC3-based solar cells afforded the best PCE of 11.5% with high JSC and FF because INIC3 has the lowest optical bandgap and highest electron mobility. Liao et al. fused two indacenodithiophenes to develop a 10-heterocyclic ring, indacenodithiophenoindacenodithiophene, called IDTIDT-IC (Fig. 8).113 Compared with IDT-IC, IDTIDT-IC exhibits a smaller bandgap of 1.53 eV and increased HOMO/LUMO energy levels because of the stronger electron-donating capability of indacenodithiophenoindacenodithiophene. The solar cells based on PTB7-Th:IDTIDT-IC afforded a higher PCE of 6.48%, with much higher VOC (0.94 V) and JSC (14.49 mA cm−2). Recently, Zhan et al. extended the IT unit to develop a fused-11-ring core, IU, which they used to construct IUIC (Fig. 8).114 The improved electron-donating capability of IU enhances the energy levels of IUIC (ΔHOMO = 0.32 eV/ΔLUMO = 0.10 eV compared with IT-4F) and decreases the optical bandgap to 1.41 eV. As a result, compared with PTB7-Th:IT-4F solar cells, the PTB7-Th:IUIC solar cells afforded an improved PCE of 11.2%, with higher VOC (0.796 V) and JSC (21.74 mA cm−2). In short, A–D–A SMAs with polycyclic arenes afford small optical bandgaps and show great potential in high-performance OSCs. Carefully optimizing the energy levels, molecular packing and miscibility with the donor of A–D–A SMAs with polycyclic arenes would aid the achievement of higher PCEs.

3. Conclusions
A–D–A SMAs possess strong absorption in the visible or NIR region due to their intense intramolecular charge transfer effects. Their HOMO/LUMO energy levels can be readily adjusted via modifying their donor and/or acceptor sections. Out-of-plane side chains and compact strong electron-withdrawing end groups can induce ordered J-aggregation and strong intermolecular interactions to simultaneously achieve suitable miscibility with donors and high electron mobility. Therefore, numerous A–D–A SMAs have been developed, and the PCEs of SMA-based OSCs have increased rapidly in recent years. In addition, a series of chemical strategies have also been employed to optimize the molecular structures of A–D–A SMAs and improve their photovoltaic performance. In this review, we summarize and analyze the reported A–D–A SMAs based on the ring number of the ladder-type arene core. According to the evolution tendency of the parameters, the universal rules for A–D–A SMAs are presented as follows:
With regard to the ladder-type donor core, enlarging its π-conjugation, substituting phenyl groups in the backbone with thienyl structures, introducing electron-donating groups and inserting quinoidal resonance structures can reduce the bandgap; replacing the bridge carbon atom with silicon results in a blueshift of the absorption of the SMA and improved crystallinity; extending its π-conjugation and replacing the alkylaryl groups with alkyl side chains facilitate molecular packing for high electron mobility; optimizing the position and size of the side chains of the SMA can modulate its intermolecular interactions and crystallinity and improve its morphology.
With regard to the end groups, introducing electron-donating groups (such as methyl, alkoxy) and reducing their electron-withdrawing capability can improve the LUMO energy levels of SMAs for higher VOC accompanied by blueshift absorption; modification with electron-withdrawing groups or strengthening the electron-withdrawing capacity of an SMA can downshift its LUMO energy level, resulting in redshift absorption and high JSC; substituting with fluorine atoms and expanding its π-conjugation will increase intermolecular interactions, resulting in high electron mobility.
In order to further improve the PCEs of SMAs-based solar cells, we believe that more effort should be devoted to SMAs in these respects: (1) tuning the absorption of SMAs via developing new donor cores or end groups, introducing suitable substituent groups and employing a ternary strategy to achieve complement with the donor; (2) finely optimizing the energy levels to reduce the Eloss as much as possible (∼0.5 eV) while simultaneously maintaining effective exciton dissociation; (3) improving intermolecular interaction via optimizing the chemical structures and positions of the side chains and substituent groups to obtain a fine morphology; (4) enhancing electron mobility via extending the π-conjugation of the molecular backbone and introducing intermolecular/intramolecular noncovalent interactions to facilitate charge transport and reduce recombination.
