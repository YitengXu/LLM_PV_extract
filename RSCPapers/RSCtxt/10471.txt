    , Accepted 6th December 2016First published on 6th December 2016AbstractWe demonstrate scalable, low-cost and low-temperature (<100 °C) aqueous chemical growth of bismuth–zinc vanadate (BiZn2VO6) nanocompounds by BiVO4 growth on ZnO nanobelts (NBs). The nanocompounds were further doped with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to tune the electronic structure of the materials, as a means to lower the charge carrier recombination rate. The chemical composition, morphology, and detailed nanostructure of the BiZn2VO6 nanocompounds were characterized. They exhibit rice-like morphology, are highly dense on the substrate and possess a good crystalline quality. Photoelectrochemical characterization in 0.1 M lithium perchlorate in carbonate propylene shows that BiZn2VO6 nanocompounds are highly suitable as anodes for solar-driven photoelectrochemical applications, providing significantly better performance than with only ZnO NBs. This performance could be attributed to the heterogeneous catalysis effect at nanocompound and ZnO NB interfaces, which have enhanced the electron transfer process on the electrode surface. Furthermore, the charge collection efficiency could be significantly improved through PEG doping of nanocompounds. The photocurrent density of PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 nanocompounds reached values of 2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), over 60% larger than that of undoped BiZn2VO6 nanocompounds. Photoluminescence emission experiments confirmed that PEG plays a crucial role in lowering the charge carrier recombination rate. The presented BiZn2VO6 nanocompounds are shown to provide highly competitive performance compared with other state-of-the art photoelectrodes.
1. Introduction
Nanostructured semiconductors have great potential to be used as photocatalytic electrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications like water splitting and pollutant degradation. In addition to strong light absorption and efficient charge separation/migration of photogenerated charges, suitable PEC electrodes should also provide low recombination rates and efficient charge separation/migration, while remaining stable.1–3 However, the semiconductor electrodes must also be compatible with scalable low-cost synthesis. Some single phase metal oxide (MO) nanostructures (e.g. CuO, ZnO, TiO2, and Fe2O3 (ref. 4–6)) are promising as photo-electrode materials for visible light induced photo-catalysis because of their high catalytic properties along with their chemical, structural, and electronic surface composition that can be tailored with specific properties. However, to date, no single phase material exists that can be used to meet all the aforementioned demands. Previous efforts to improve these properties of photoelectrodes include doping of the semiconductor and modification of the electrode surface with water oxidation co-catalysts,7–11 and development of novel photo-catalysts such as BaTaO2N,12 BiPO4/BiVO4,13 Bi2MoO6/ZnO,14 GaN:ZnO (oxynitride)15 and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4).16
Mixed metal oxides in the form BiM2AO6 (with M: Mg, Ca, Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn or Zn, and A: V, P or As) possess suitable physical and chemical properties for PEC water oxidation.17–20 However, only a few candidates have been investigated, namely BiCu2VO6 (ref. 18) and BiZn2VO6.19,20 Particularly, bismuth zinc vanadate (BiZn2VO6) presents a band gap (Eg) in the visible wavelength range, with measured and calculated reported values of around 2.4 eV (ref. 19) and 1.6 eV,17 respectively. By contrast, ZnO has a Eg of around 3.3 eV and can only absorb the ultraviolet part (<5%) of the solar spectrum.2 Effectively, BiZn2VO6 merges the most suitable properties from the two individual components, ZnO and BiVO4. This means that it acts as a robust visible light absorber (originating from the BiVO4, while a limitation of ZnO), while also providing a high electron mobility to facilitate efficient charge transport (originating from the ZnO, while a limitation of BiVO4).9,10 In addition, the charge transport properties of this combination may be improved by doping with polyethylene glycol (PEG), as we recently demonstrated for ZnO nanorods.21 The water–PEG solution acts as an impurity source by the disruption of hydrogen bonding when dissolved in water and also provides a rich hydrogenated environment for the growth of ZnO nanorods. The obtained doping density (1.39 × 1020 cm−3) extracted from Mott–Schottky analysis for PEG-doped ZnO was higher than that for the undoped ZnO (2.81 × 1019 cm−3), with associated enhanced optical and sensing properties.21
Scalable, low-cost and environmentally friendly synthesis is essential for practical applications. To date all the grown BiM2AO6 compounds16–19 were to our knowledge prepared for growth durations in excess of 10 h and by high-temperature (≥700 °C) solid-state reactions. This made them expensive and does not allow neither doping using an organic compound nor the utilization of soft substrates. Instead, aqueous chemical growth (ACG), “green chemistry”, is a low-temperature method for production of metal oxide nanostructures.22,23 In addition to the low cost of this synthesis route, ACG can be operated at sufficiently low-temperatures (<100 °C) to allow organic molecules to be used as additives as a means to control the nanostructure morphology.21
Herein, for the first time, we report an inexpensive, scalable, and low temperature (80–90 °C) green synthesis of BiZn2VO6 nanocompounds (NCs), by BiVO4 growth on ZnO nanobelts (NBs)-based modified electrodes. The PEC properties of the NCs were characterized and further enhanced by PEG-doping. The BiZn2VO6 NCs are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Furthermore, we compare the PEC properties of four different types of electrodes (pristine ZnO NBs, PEG-doped ZnO NBs, pristine BiZn2VO6, and PEG-doped BiZn2VO6) under simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5G).
The photocurrent density of the pristine BiZn2VO6-NCs was up to ∼1.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl, while the PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs reached values of ∼2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl under the same experimental conditions, nearly 61.5% larger than that of the pristine BiZn2VO6 NCs. Photoluminescence (PL) emission studies show that PEG plays a crucial role in lowering the charge carrier recombination rate.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of the BiZn2VO6 nanocompounds
The BiZn2VO6 compound nanostructures were prepared by a two-step low-temperature aqueous chemical growth (ACG) process as shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, pristine and doped ZnO nanorods were prepared over an Au-coated glass, as previously reported.21 Briefly, the growth solution used in this experiment was prepared from an equimolar concentration of 0.05 M solutions of zinc nitrate hexahydrate ZnNO3·6H2O and hexamethylenetetramine C6H12N4 in deionized water. For doped samples, the growth was also in the presence of 0.1% weight to volume (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 2000). The substrates were fixed facing downwards to a Teflon sample holder and then dipped into the growth solution. After that they were baked in an oven for 5 h at 90 °C. After the growth time was completed, the samples were washed in deionized water and dried with nitrogen gas (Scheme 1A). In the next step, the BiZn2VO6 compound was formed by BiVO4 growth on top of the ZnO nanostructure, according to Zhou's and co-workers report albeit at modified growth time.24 In a typical synthetic route, an equimolar concentration of 0.02 M of bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) was dissolved in 10 ml of nitric acid, 70% (HNO3) solution. 20 ml deionized water was added into this solution under vigorous stirring until the salts were completely dissolved. Then, ∼12.8 g sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) was added to adjust the pH value to 6.5 until the formation of a yellow homogeneous solution. The as-grown ZnO nanorods on Au-coated glass were placed facing upwards in the bottom of this yellow solution. They were covered with aluminum foil and placed in the pre-heated oven for 4 or 10 h at 80 °C. The final products were washed with deionized water, dried with nitrogen gas and then dried at 80 °C for 10 h in the oven (Scheme 1B).

ZnO samples were used as reference for the photoelectrochemical characterization. As the concentration of the alkaline reactant has a direct effect on the pH of growth solution,23 in order to have the same ZnO morphology (ZnO nanobelts (NBs)) as the aforementioned synthetic route, the as-prepared pristine and doped ZnO nanorod electrodes were immersed in a solution containing 10 ml of nitric acid, 70% HNO3, and 20 ml deionized water. NaHCO3 was added to adjust the pH value to 6.5 and then the samples were placed in an oven for 4 h at 80 °C. Also BiVO4 control samples for XRD and XPS measurements were grown on Au coated glass substrates as described above with an extra step for the seed solution. The seed solution was prepared by using an equimolar concentration of 0.02 M of bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate and ammonium metavanadate in 25 ml methanol. This seed solution was deposited on a cleaned Au coated glass substrate by the dip coating method. The substrates containing the seed particles were then annealed at 120 °C for 5 min. After preparing the substrates with seed nanoparticles, it was placed in the beaker containing the growth solution. They were covered with aluminum foil and placed in the pre-heated oven for 4 h at 80 °C. The final products were washed with deionized water, dried with nitrogen gas and then dried at 80 °C for 10 h in the oven.
2.2. Characterization of the electrodes
The structural characterization was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Philips PW 1729 powder diffractometer equipped with a CuKα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å) using a generator voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization was carried out by using a FEI Tecnai G2 TF20 UT instrument with a field-emission gun operated at 200 kV. The instrument is equipped with an EDX system. Optical absorption spectra were obtained by using a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV-visible spectrophotometer. BiZn2VO6 nanostructures grown on the glass substrate were used for the measurements. A blank glass slide was used as a reference. Surface and chemical composition analysis were carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and XPS spectra were measured using a Scienta ESCA200 spectrometer with vacuum generators and monochromatic Al Kα radiation. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphological analysis was performed by using a LEO 1550 Gemini field emission gun at 5 kV. The optical properties were investigated by photoluminescence (PL) measurements at room temperature (300 K). The light emission features of the samples were studied by using a micro-photoluminescence setup. Excitation was performed by using a frequency doubled Nd:YVO laser as a continuous wave excitation source, with a wavelength of λ = 266 nm.
2.3. Photoelectrochemical characterization
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements (linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)), chronoamperometry and (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)) were performed in a three-electrode cell setup using an SP-200 potentiostat (Bio-Logic, Claix, France), a platinum sheet as the counter electrode and a standard Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 3 M KCl. The electrolyte used was 0.1 M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) in propylene carbonate solution at pH 7 to avoid ZnO decomposition.25 LSV was carried out at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. Chronoamperometry I–t curves were tested at a bias voltage of 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). All electrodes were illuminated from the front side of the samples by using a solar simulator (LCS-100, Newport, model 94011A). The total area of the photoelectrode was 2 cm × 1 cm, while the light is illuminated on a 1 cm × 1 cm that was immersed in the electrolyte. The solar simulator uses a 100 W ozone free xenon lamp and includes an AM 1.5G air mass filter with an output power of 1 sun (AM 1.5G). EIS was performed at an amplitude of 20 mV, in the frequency range of 5 kHz to 0.1 Hz, and a potential range of −1.0 V to +1.0 V.
3. Result and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the products

Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of representative ZnO, PEG-doped ZnO, BiVO4, BiZn2VO6, and PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs grown by low-temperature ACG for 4 h and 10 h. The XRD acquisition parameters were kept the same for all samples to ensure a fair comparison between samples. The peak at 2θ = 38° corresponds to the Au substrate and was observed for all samples. The XRD patterns of the pristine and the PEG-doped ZnO NBs show peaks corresponding to the (100), (002), and (101) planes of ZnO at 2θ = 31.77°, 34.42°, and 36.25°, respectively. This confirms that the ZnO NBs have a hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS no. 36-1451). In agreement with our previous work on PEG-doped ZnO nanorods, PEG-doping does not significantly affect the structural properties of the ZnO NBs.21 BiVO4 is known to exist in three polymorphs: orthorhombic, tetragonal, and scheelite structures with a monoclinic system.26 The XRD patterns of BiVO4 monoclinic and tetragonal systems are quite similar, but the BiVO4 scheelite structure with a monoclinic system can be distinguished by the existence of a 2θ peak at 15° and a peak splitting at 18.5°, 35°, and 46°.27 All XRD results for the BiVO4 control samples were in agreement with the characteristic pattern arising from the monoclinic scheelite phase (JCPDS no. 74-4894). The XRD patterns of the BiZn2VO6 NCs samples exhibit several peaks that cannot match any peak of pure ZnO or BiVO4 samples. Comparing this with the XRD results of the work reported by Nunes et al.,17 it is clear that the grown samples are not a ZnO/BiVO4 composite, but rather bismuth zinc vanadate (BiZn2VO6). In fact, it is a mixed metal oxide NC that crystallizes in orthorhombic unit cells.17,28 Comparing the XRD results for BiZn2VO6 and PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 grown for 4 h and 10 h, we noticed that the XRD patterns are the same for both samples i.e. no time and no PEG-doping dependence. Therefore, one can infer that 4 h is already a suitable growth time for the BiZn2VO6 NCs. This is an improvement compared to previously published results on the growth of BiZn2VO6 using high-temperature solid-state reactions and relatively longer growth durations (≥700 °C, up to 30 h).17–20 In order to further confirm that we have obtained a BiZn2VO6 NC, a study was performed by HRTEM on the BiVO4/doped ZnO/Au electrode that was prepared by 10 h synthesis. The selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of a single NC (Fig. 2a) shows well-defined diffraction spots, indicating the polycrystalline nature of the NC. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of the sample (Fig. 2b) demonstrates that the Zn distribution overlaps with the Bi and V distributions, which means that BiVO4 is intertwined with doped ZnO, i.e. PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs have been grown. Moreover, UV-Vis spectroscopy was used as shown in Fig. 3. The absorption spectrum for the BiZn2VO6 material grown on the glass substrate indicates an absorption peak at around ∼482 nm, which corresponds to an optical band gap of about 2.57 eV. This is larger than previously reported data19 by 0.17 eV.

We also used XPS to analyse the chemical state of the PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 and the BiVO4 control samples (Fig. 4a and b, respectively). For the BiVO4 control samples (Fig. 4b), the O1s and V2p3/2 XPS peaks at ∼530 eV and ∼516.8 eV correspond to the oxygen species in the metal oxide and vanadium oxide phase, respectively.29 The strong shoulder of the O1s peak at ∼532 eV might be due to the hydroxyl group from adsorbed water.30 For the PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs, the dominant feature in the O1s spectrum belong to the hydroxyl group and adsorbed water which gives a strong peak at ∼532 eV. The contribution from oxygen species in O1s spectrum now appears as a tail in the lower binding energy (marked by a circle in Fig. 4a). It should also be noted that the V2p3/2 XPS peak at ∼517 eV shifts slightly to a higher binding energy (vertical reference line) for PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 compared to the pristine BiVO4 sample. Furthermore, Bi4f XPS peaks for the PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs were different from those of the pristine BiVO4 as shown in Fig. 4c. The observed binding energies of Bi4f7/2 (159.3 eV) and Bi4f5/2 (164.9 eV) of the BiVO4 are consistent with literature data.29,31 In comparison, the peak positions of Bi4f7/2 (159.8 eV) and Bi4f5/2 (165.2 eV) for the BiZn2VO6 are shifted to higher binding energies. We note that, in our previous work21 the presence of PEG caused the core level of the O1s to shift by ∼0.4 eV to lower binding energy. However, in the current work the O1s was not affected and remained at the same value of the binding energy for the control BiVO4 sample and doped BiZn2VO6, while the V2p, and Bi4f have been shifted to higher binding energy. At this point it is convenient to recall that the unit cell of the monoclinic BiVO4 has a ∼ 7.2 Å, b ∼ 11.7 Å, and c ∼ 5.1 Å,29 while the mixed metal oxide (BiM2AO6) is orthorhombic and possesses a unit cell with a ∼ 11.5 Å, b ∼ 5.5 Å and c ∼ 8.5 Å.17 Consequently, the bonding length and the band structure are expected to be different for BiVO4 and BiZn2VO6. Hence, the shift in the binding energies is mainly attributed to the incorporation of ZnO element into the BiVO4 structure. The Zn2p XPS spectra of the BiZn2VO6 are shown in Fig. 4d, where the spin–orbital splitting peaks at ∼1022.3 and ∼1045.4 eV are assigned to the Zn2p3/2 and Zn2p1/2, respectively.21 Based on these observations and from the aforementioned TEM and XRD results, it is evident that we have obtained BiZn2VO6 NCs.

In order to identify possible changes of the ZnO nanorods during BiZn2VO6 growth, we examined ZnO nanorod films that were exposed to a modified BiZn2VO6 growth solution not containing the actual growth material (see the Experimental section for details). Comparing Fig. 5a (initial ZnO nanorods) and Fig. 5b (post-treated films) there is a clear etching effect of the nanorods, reforming into nanobelts (NBs, Fig. 5b). The length of these ZnO NBs is about 3–5 μm, their average side thickness is around 100 nm, and their widths range between around 300 nm and 700 nm. The morphology of ZnO nanostructures is known to be sensitive to external conditions like pH,20 and we attributed the observed morphological change to the lower pH of the BiZn2VO6 growth solution (pH ≈ 6.0–6.5) compared with the growth solution of the initial ZnO nanorods (pH ≈ 6.5 and 7). Fig. 5c and d show samples after growth of PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs on the ZnO NBs, by ACG for 4 h and 10 h, respectively. The nanostructures grown on the ZnO have a rice-like shape, with an average height of 1.3–1.8 μm and widths between 1.9 μm and 2.6 μm. As clearly seen on the SEM pictures, the agglomeration and the size of BiZn2VO6 capped ZnO NBs increase with increasing growth time. The side view SEM image of the BiZn2VO6/ZnO/Au film is displayed in Fig. 5e, where rice-like BiZn2VO6 nanostructures grown in 4 h lay at the top of vertically aligned ordered ZnO NBs. Note that from the top-down SEM image (Fig. 5f), the agglomeration of BiZn2VO6 nanostructures at the top of the ZnO NBs is distributed randomly, while the cross-sectional image (Fig. 5e) reveals that BiZn2VO6 is interpenetrating the ZnO NBs. Both designs ensure close contact between the two components, which is highly desirable for charge transfer and separation.

3.2. Photoelectrochemical measurements
We investigated the PEC properties of pristine ZnO NBs, PEG-doped ZnO NBs, BiZn2VO6, and PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 electrodes under simulated solar light (see the Experimental section for details). Fig. 6a shows linear sweep voltammetry for all samples under dark conditions (dashed lines) and under light irradiation (full curves). First, we note that all four electrode types provide considerable PEC conversion upon irradiation, while the dark currents are very low.
 Fig. 6  (a) Linear sweep voltammetry of ZnO NBs, PEG-doped ZnO NBs, BiZn2VO6 and PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NC electrodes in the dark and under solar light illumination (1 sun), (b) chronoamperometry I–t curves of all electrodes at an applied voltage of +0.5 V with 50 s light on/off cycles, (c) & (d) the enlarged response time of the PEG–BiZn2VO6 photoelectrodes for the rise and the decay times of ∼0.1 s, respectively. 
However, the current densities vary by more than a factor of 5 for the different samples. The observed photocurrent density was 0.35 mA cm−2 and 0.59 mA cm−2 for the undoped and the PEG-doped ZnO NBs at 1.23 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. In comparison, the photocurrent density was 1.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for the undoped BiZn2VO6 NCs. Hence, the photocurrent density of the BiZn2VO6 NCs, when compared with pristine and PEG-doped ZnO NBs, increases significantly, which can be assigned to efficient electro-catalytic surface activity of the BiZn2VO6 NCs under visible light irradiation.19 It is also higher than the reported photocurrent for BiCu2VO6, and modified BiZn2VO6 (0.082 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and 0.0004 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively)18,19 (see Table 1 for details). Moreover, the photocurrent density of the PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs is substantially improved. PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs reached values of 2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl which corresponds to an improvement over 60% compared to pristine BiZn2VO6 NCs. We note that these values are higher than the reported photocurrent for other systems based on the same components, such as BiVO4/Al-doped ZnO heterostructures (1.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE).9 The performance is also comparable to that of the triple junction (Co–Pi/BiVO4/ZnO, and CoOx/NiO/BiVO4), (3 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V vs. RHE, and 2.5 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE),10,11 (see Table 1 for details). Table 1 summarizes the photocurrent density recently reported for compounds, including state-of-the art heterostructure materials and the undoped/PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 electrodes presented in this article. The performance of additional photocatalyst materials can be found in the review by Su et al.1 These results indicate that PEG assists the photo-excited electrons and holes to overcome the energy barrier (e.g., the binding energy) and enhances the charge separation/migration processes of the BiZn2VO6 NCs electrode. Overall, the improved charge collection efficiency of the electrode surface can be attributed to: (1) the heterogeneous catalysis effect at the BiZn2VO6/ZnO NB interfaces was enhanced, and the resulting electron communications processes on the electrode surface were efficient, and (2) PEG impurities that act as a shallow donor and enhance the n-type conductivity as it has been suggested in our previous work.21 These results are also consistent with previously published studies,7–9 where the authors argued that doping plays distinct roles in enhancing the photoactivity of semiconductor materials. The time responses of the undoped and doped electrodes were examined by chronoamperometry in the dark (light off) and under simulated solar light (light on) at an applied voltage of +0.5 V as shown in Fig. 6b. The space between each illumination cycle was ∼50 s to enable the investigation of the time response and the resetting of the photo-electrodes to reach its equilibrium position. The stationary photocurrent density was 0.09 mA cm−2, 0.13 mA cm−2, 0.14 mA cm−2, and 0.2 mA cm−2 for undoped ZnO NB, PEG-doped ZnO NB, undoped BiZn2VO6, and PEG-doped BiZn2VO6, respectively. These results confirm that the PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NC based electrode exhibited the highest current density, with a good reproducibility and stability. Moreover, all electrodes show very fast rise and decay times (around 0.1 s) as shown in Fig. 6c and d (PEG–BiZn2VO6 electrodes), which is favorable for photoactivity.

The interface between the electrolyte and electrodes of pristine and PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs was investigated using the Mott–Schottky method, with the aim to relate the effect of PEG doping to the flat band potential (Vfb) of the semiconductor electrodes.32 From the intercept (Fig. 7a), and at a selected frequency (∼1 kHz), the extracted values for Vfb for using pristine and PEG-doped electrodes are ∼−0.90 V and ∼−0.96 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. The 0.06 V shift to higher values upon doping suggests that a higher Fermi level (EF) could be obtained by PEG doping. This shift of the EF toward the conduction band edge (Ec) is expected and consistent with our previous studies,21 in which we demonstrated that the addition of PEG into ZnO growth solution was attributed to hydrogen doping, and the doping density (1.39 × 1020 cm−3) extracted from Mott–Schottky analysis for PEG-doped ZnO was higher than the undoped ZnO (2.81 × 1019 cm−3) and accordingly the n-type conductivity of ZnO nanorods was enhanced. Moreover, this result is also in agreement with the recent work of Cooper et al.,33 where they have reported an enhancement in the n-type conductivity of BiVO4 due to hydrogen treatment.

(c) and (d) Schematic illustration of photo-generation of electron–hole pairs and how PEG can affect the Fermi level (EF) of the optical band gap of (c) pristine BiZn2VO6 and (d) PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 before equilibration at the electrolyte interface (EF, redox). 
The PEC activity has a direct relationship with the electron–hole recombination rate, where a lower recombination rate corresponds to higher PEC activity and vice versa.10,12 In order to further elucidate the mechanism responsible for the PEC enhancement, room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded for both pristine and PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs (Fig. 7b). Overall, the PL spectra for all different types of NCs display two distinct peaks that are consistent with the PL spectra from nanostructured ZnO.34 The UV emission peaks centered at ≈380 nm are the so called near band edge emission, due to free excitonic emission, and the “green-yellow” band, called the deep level emission band is centered at ≈590 nm.35 It is obvious that the emission intensity of PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs has greatly decreased, by about 50%, with respect to pristine BiZn2VO6 NCs, indicating that PEG doping plays a crucial role in quenching the PL emission. This observation may be related to the intramolecular hydrogen bonds, because of the addition of PEG that provides a hydrogen rich environment,21 which can modulate the PL characteristic as Yang et al., reported.36 They reported that the PL of carbon nanodots is quenched at pH = 1 because of the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds among the oxygen-containing surface groups. The reduction in the emission intensity here can be explained as follows: upon excitation, the carriers aim to recombine radiatively by emitting a photon with energy close to the near band edge emission or alternatively through deep level emission. At this point it is convenient to recall that, although as pointed out above, hydrogen acts as a shallow donor. However, hydrogen is amphoteric i.e., can act as either a donor (H+) or an acceptor (H−).37 Therefore, one could ascribe the effect of PEG as a dual effect: one is in enhancing the conductivity and the other is surface passivation/stabilization of the electrons or holes at the semiconductor surface.38 On the basis of the results of the Mott–Schottky and PL measurements, there is a possible modulation in the Fermi level (EF) and recombination for the BiZn2VO6 electrode–electrolyte interface. Fig. 7c, shows the Fermi level (EF) of the un-doped BiZn2VO6 while, in Fig. 7d of the PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 the EF is shifted towards the conduction band (Ec).
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a low-cost and scalable low temperature ACG method to synthesize BiZn2VO6 NCs on ZnO NBs on Au-coated glass substrates. Characterization of the morphology and the chemical composition of the NCs show that BiVO4 growth on the ZnO rods lead to BiZn2VO6 NCs with rice-like morphology. The ZnO nanorods reformed to ZnO NBs during this process. The rice-like BiZn2VO6 was successfully used as the photoelectrode for PEC activity in 0.1 M lithium perchlorate in carbonate propylene under simulated solar light. The results show a performance of 1.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V for the BiZn2VO6 NCs, which is an improvement of 28% compared with the ZnO NB samples. The charge collection efficiency of the device was further enhanced through doping by PEG. The photocurrent density for PEG-doped BiZn2VO6 NCs reached values of up to 2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under the same experimental conditions. This is over 60% higher than that of the undoped BiZn2VO6 NCs and more than a factor of 5 higher than for the undoped ZnO NB electrodes. Moreover, the improved photocatalytic performance upon PEG-doping was in agreement with photoluminescence measurements, which revealed that PEG-doping had a crucial role in lowering the charge carrier recombination rate. The enhanced photo-activity of the modified BiZn2VO6 NC electrodes is attributed to impurities on the metal oxide that is dictated by the use of PEG along with the heterogeneous catalysis effect at the BiZn2VO6/doped-ZnO NB interfaces resulting in efficient electron communications processes on the electrode surface. The low-cost and scalable synthesis combined with the doping of the mixed metal oxides opens a new route for efficient and cheap materials for many applications, including PEC water splitting.
