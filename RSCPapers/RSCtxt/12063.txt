    , Accepted 17th September 2020First published on 17th September 2020AbstractHydroamination of alkynes provides a direct and atom-economical access to highly valuable organic nitrogen molecules. The design of a green catalytic process has attracted considerable attention. Here, we in situ tune a TiO2 2D photonic crystal (PC) layer on nanotube arrays (NTs) via the anodization process and selectively deposit small gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with an average size of ∼7.5 nm into the 2D PC layer using the NaBH4 reduction method. The as-prepared plasmonic samples show superior activity for the solvent-free hydroamination of phenylacetylene, illuminating with visible-light from both sides simultaneously. The 2D PC layer exhibits a much higher intensity ratio of anatase (004)/(101) than the NTs without the 2D PC layer and enhances the light-harvesting efficiency of plasmonic Au NPs, resulting in improved activity with a TON 294.8 and TOF 42.1 h−1 of the imine product yield based on the Au molar content.
1. Introduction
Hydroamination of alkynes, or the direct addition of an N–H bond to a CC bond, is of great significance in synthetic chemistry.1–3 This reaction provides an atom-economical route for the synthesis of numerous organic nitrogen molecules that are important fine chemicals and synthetic intermediates. The development of “green” catalytic processes for this reaction under mild condition has attracted significant interest.
Previously, we have found that plasmonic gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) could catalyze the hydroamination of alkynes under visible-light irradiation.4,5 Nevertheless, these studies were conducted in organic solvents, particularly toluene.4–6 Solvents are harmful and could alter the light absorption of plasmonic photocatalysts. Therefore, the development of the green catalytic system for the hydroamination of alkynes into corresponding imines in solvent-free and mild conditions is highly desirable.
Au NPs on photoelectrode slices such as a TiO2 nanotube array (NT) structure fabricated via the anodization method seems to be a good choice for conducting photocatalytic organic transformations under solvent-free conditions. No stirring is needed during the reaction and there is no need to separate photocatalysts from the mixture of the reactants and products. More importantly, both sides of the electrode slice could be illuminated with visible-light simultaneously.
A TiO2 NT photoelectrode fabricated via a two-step anodization process have been reported.7–10 In this study, we vary the low applied potential in the first step to tune the diameter of hexagonal nano-imprints, and in the second step, tune the pore size of the 2D photonic crystal (PC) layer. Different from these previous reports,7–10 our work gives the first detection of an extremely strong anatase (004) peak. Compared with less reactive {101} facets, highly reactive {001} facets have promising applications in solar cells and photocatalysis.11–15 However, a high ratio of (004)/(101) cannot be expected for naturally occurring anatase TiO2 due to the high surface energy of (004). Interestingly, here, we also found that TiO2 PCNTs exhibit a much higher intensity ratio of anatase (004)/(101) than TiO2 NTs, up to 1.32. Au NPs with small particle sizes (∼7.5 nm) are loaded into the 2D PC layer simply via the NaBH4 reduction method. The light absorption of the 2D PC layer overlaps with the localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) absorption of Au NPs, further enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency of Au NPs. Illuminating with visible-light from both sides, the as-prepared Au/TiO2 PCNTs achieve high performance in the solvent-free hydroamination of phenylacetylene.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals and materials
A 0.2 mm thick titanium sheet was cut into pieces of 1 cm × 2.5 cm. Ethylene glycol (EG, 99%), ammonium fluoride (NH4F, 98%), and phenylacetylene (96%) were purchased from Energy Chemical; sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was purchased from Acros Organics; L-lysine (98%) was purchased from Ark Pharm; aniline (99.9%) was purchased from Aladdin. All the chemicals were used as received. All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized (DI) water with the resistivity of 18.2 M cm purified by a Ultra-pure water system.
2.2. Preparation of the TiO2 2D PC layer on NTs
The hierarchical TiO2 PCNTs consisting of a top photonic crystal layer and a bottom tubular structure were fabricated by a two-step anodization process with DC regulated power supply. Prior to anodization, Ti foils were first ultrasonicated in acetone, DI water, and ethanol for 10 min respectively, and then dried with N2. The anodization was carried out on a DC power source using a Ti foil as the anode (1 cm × 1 cm working area) and a Pt foil (1 cm × 1 cm) as the cathode in an electrolyte consisting of 0.3 wt% NH4F in an EG solution with 2 vol% water. In the first-step anodization, a potential of 10 V, 30 V or 50 V was applied for 3 h. After anodization, the as-prepared films were immediately immersed in ethanol for 5 min and then ultrasonicated in DI water for certain time to remove the as-grown nanotube layers and leaving hexagonal nano-imprints on the surface. In the second-step anodization, a potential of 50 V was applied for 1 h. Then, the as-prepared TiO2 PCNT samples were immediately immersed in ethanol for 5 min and rinsed with ethanol. For comparison, TiO2 NTs were also prepared via one-step anodization at 50 V for 1 h. Finally, the samples were annealed at 450 °C for 3 h to obtain anatase TiO2 with high crystallinity.
2.3. Deposition of Au NPs into the TiO2 2D PC layer
4 mL of 0.53 M L-lysine was added into 20 mL of HAuCl4 solution (0.38 × 10−3 M) under magnetic stirring with the sample slide vertically immersed in the mixture and continued stirring for 30 min. To this suspension, 2 mL of 0.35 M freshly prepared NaBH4 solution was added gradually. Then, the slide was taken out from the solution immediately, immersed in DI water and ethanol under stirring for 5 min, respectively, and finally dried at 70 °C.
2.4. Characterization
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku UItima IV diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples were recorded using a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) using fine BaSO4 powder as a reference. The morphology of the samples was investigated by FE-SEM Merlin Compact. The lattice study of the catalysts and size-distribution study of Au NPs were carried out on a transmission electron microscope Talos F200X (FEI). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi, and the standard binding energy of C 1s was set at 284.8 eV.
2.5. Solvent-free photocatalytic hydroamination of alkynes
Typically, 5 mmol aniline and 5 mmol phenylacetylene was added to a double-sided quartz light window reaction vessel with a 1 cm × 1 cm Au/TiO2 PCNT slide inside. The reaction reactor and experimental setup are provided in ESI.† After bubbling nitrogen for 5 min, the mixture was illuminated with one halogen lamp for each side (a 300 W lamp kept at a certain distance, 130 mW cm−2) for 7 h. The temperature was monitored during the reaction and maintained at 55 °C. After reaction, 1 mL of the toluene solvent was added and kept in the reaction system for 15 min before GC and GC-MS analyses.
3. Results and discussion
A two-step anodization process was used to fabricate hierarchical TiO2 PCNTs that consisted of a top 2D photonic crystal layer and a bottom nanotube array structure. As shown in Scheme 1a, TiO2 nanotubes with poor alignment were formed after the first-step anodization (3 h), and then were removed via ultrasonication, leaving hexagonal nano-imprints on the surface of the Ti foil (Scheme 1b). Interestingly, we observed that the diameter of these nano-imprints decreased with the decrease in the applied potential from approx. 135.1 nm (50 V) to 90.6 nm (30 V) (Fig. S1, ESI†). Moreover, a longer ultrasonication time was required to remove the nanotubes formed at a low applied potential. 5 min was sufficient for removing the nanotubes formed at 50 V and 30 V in the first-step. When the applied potential further decreased to 10 V, the nanotubes could not be removed even after the ultrasonication time was extended to 15 min.

(a) Anodization at various potentials for 3 h to obtain TiO2 NTs with different diameters and lengths, (b) ultrasonication to remove the formed TiO2 NTs, (c) anodization at 50 V for 1 h to obtain TiO2 PCNTs, (d) chemical reduction using NaBH4 to load Au NPs onto TiO2 PCNTs. 
A potential of 50 V was applied in the second-step anodization for 1 h. A 2D TiO2 photonic crystal layer formed on the nanotube array (Scheme 1c). As shown in Fig. 1, the pore size of the photonic layer is 81.2 nm, 92.6 nm, and 144.4 nm, corresponding to an applied potential of 10 V, 30 V, and 50 V during the first anodization process. Although the PC layer could be observed for the sample prepared at low potential of 10 V in the first step (Fig. 1a), it exhibits poor regularity. With the increase in the applied potential from 10 V to 30 V in the first-step anodization, the photonic structure becomes more regular. A periodically well-ordered 2D photonic layer with a honeycomb-like structure is achieved (Fig. 1c) when 50 V was applied in both first- and second-step anodization processes. An example of the SEM image in a larger scale bar is provided in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

The corresponding pore diameter of the 2D photonic crystal layer was calculated by accounting 200 pores. 
The well-ordered 2D PC layer with the honeycomb-like structure on the nanotube array (TiO2 PCNTs) was chosen as a typical sample for the following experiments in our work. The TiO2 nanotube array (NTs) without the 2D PC layer was also fabricated for comparison (50 V, 1 h), and the SEM images are provided in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The XRD patterns of TiO2 PCNTs and TiO2 NTs are shown in Fig. 2a. The strong diffraction peaks located at 25.3° and 37.9° are ascribed to the (101) and (004) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively (JCPDS No. 21-1272). Different from previous reports7–10 and the standard TiO2 sample in JCPDS, extremely strong anatase (004) peaks are observed. This implies that the growth of the TiO2 crystal preferred [001] direction. The observation of the high intensity of anatase (004) is probably due to the different composition of the electrolyte and temperature during the anodization and calcination processes. Fluoride ion (F−) has been utilized as a stabilizing agent for the fabrication of anatase TiO2 nanoplates or single crystals with a high ratio of {001}/{101} via a solvothermal method.12,16 Depending on the specific stabilization effect of F− during the anodization (NH4F) and the following calcination process, anatase TiO2 NTs with high-surface-energy exposed (004) could be formed. To further confirm this, concentration of NH4F and calcination temperature were varied. As expected, the intensity ratio of (004)/(101) increases with an increase in the NH4F concentration (Fig. 3a). The calcination temperature has influence on the intensity ratio although it is not prominent as with NH4F (Fig. 3b).

More interestingly, as shown in Fig. 2a, the intensity of (004) is further increased for TiO2 PCNTs as compared with TiO2 NTs that exhibit similar intensity and FHWM of other peaks. The intensity ratio of (004)/(101) is up to 1.32 for TiO2 PCNTs, while only 1.08 for TiO2 NTs. As listed in Table S1 (ESI†), the peak area ratio is 2.88 and 1.74, respectively. Therefore, it seems that the presence of the top 2D PC layer contributes more to the high intensity of the (004) peak than NTs at the bottom.
Au NPs were then loaded onto the fabricated TiO2 PCNTs and TiO2 NTs by NaBH4 reduction (Scheme 1d). As shown in Fig. 2b, the loading of Au NPs has no influence on the crystal structure of TiO2. Au/TiO2 PCNTs still maintain a higher ratio of (004)/(101) than Au/TiO2 NTs. The intensity ratio is 1.17 and 1.03, while the peak ratio is 2.62 and 1.60 for Au/TiO2 PCNTs and Au/TiO2 NTs, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). No Au peak is detected, probably due to the small particle size and even distribution of Au NPs. This is confirmed by the SEM images (Fig. 4a and b) and size distribution calculated from TEM images with an average size of approximately 7.5 nm (Fig. 4d). Fig. 4a and b indicate that the highly ordered 2D PC layer is retained after loading Au NPs. Moreover, most of the loaded Au NPs are located at the 2D PC layer, analysed from the top view and cross-sectional SEM-EDS (Fig. S5, ESI,† and Fig. 4c). The location of Au NPs explains why there is a decrease in the f(004)/(101) ratio after Au loading. The Au NPs in the 2D PC layer could obstruct its contribution to the high intensity of the (004) peak. During the Au-loading process, the sample slides were vertically immersed in the solution and taken out immediately after the addition of the NaBH4 reduction agent. The Au NPs, therefore, easily adhered to the honeycomb-like structure of the 2D PC layer and on the top of nanotube array. The structure at the interface between periodically 2D PC layer and the nanotube array for TiO2 PCNTs may also hinder the Au NPs from entering into the inner nanotubes. All these aspects lead to the selective loading of Au NPs in the 2D PC layer.

The metallic state of Au NPs was confirmed via XPS (Fig. S6, ESI†). The crystallinity and lattice spacing of Au NPs and TiO2 were further investigated via high resolution TEM (HRTEM). The samples were scratched off from the Ti foil surface for all TEM measurements. Fig. 5 clearly shows a lattice spacing of 0.235 nm, which belongs to the (111) planes of Au NPs. The lattice spacing of 0.351 nm and 0.230 nm belongs to the (101) and (004) planes of TiO2 respectively, consistent with the observation from XRD patterns. The interfacial angle between two adjacent (004) and (101) faces is ∼67°, similar to the reported value for the angle between these two planes of anatase TiO2.16–18

As confirmed above, the Au NPs are located at the 2D PC layer. Then, it is expected that the synergistic effect between the photonic effect of the 2D PC layer and the LSPR effect of Au NPs will enhance the plasmonic absorption of Au/TiO2 PCNTs. In order to compare the optical properties of TiO2 PCNTs, TiO2 NTs, Au/TiO2 PCNTs and Au/TiO2 NTs, the UV-Vis absorption spectra were examined. As shown in Fig. 6, compared with TiO2 NTs (sample (iv)), TiO2 PCNTs exhibit a stronger absorption band in the visible-light range from 400 nm to 800 nm and peak at 568 nm. To investigate the LSPR effect of Au NPs and exclude the visible-light absorption induced by the 2D PC layer, the samples were scratched off from the Ti foil surface (samples (ii) and (v)). A typical LSPR absorption of Au NPs ranging from 450 nm to 650 nm and peaks at 526 nm is observed (sample (ii)). The visible-light absorption of TiO2 PCNTs is almost completely overlapped with the LSPR region of the Au NPs. Thus, this 2D TiO2 photonic crystal layer could enhance the plasmonic effect of Au NPs. Indeed, an enhancement of the plasmonic absorption from 450 nm to 650 nm is achieved (sample (i)), which will be favourable for plasmonic photocatalysis. The enhancement of reaction rates proportional to the optical overlap between the LSPR absorption of Au/Ag and the absorption spectrum of TiO2 has been reported in numerous reaction systems such as H2 generation and CO2 reduction.19–21

Illuminating with visible-light from both sides, the solvent-free photocatalytic hydroamination of phenylacetylene with aniline was then conducted with Au/TiO2 PCNTs and Au/TiO2 NTs. The corresponding imine product yield is provided in Fig. S8 (ESI†). No activity was detected with pure TiO2 PCNT supports, which indicates that Au NPs are the active species for this reaction. The turnover number (TON) of the imine product based on the Au molar content is calculated, as shown in Fig. 7. The TON of the imine yield increases with an increase in the reaction time for both Au/TiO2 PCNTs and Au/TiO2 NTs. Under light irradiation, the Au/TiO2 PCNTs exhibit much higher activity than Au/TiO2 NTs and the TON is up to 305. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 42.1 h−1 for Au/TiO2 PCNTs is achieved after 7 h with a TON of 294.8, which is among the best values in reported works (Table S3, ESI†). A slightly higher photocurrent is also observed for Au/TiO2 PCNTs compared with the Au/TiO2 NTs counterpart (Fig. S9, ESI†). Different initial molar ratios of phenylacetylene to aniline were investigated with Au/TiO2 PCNTs (Fig. S10, ESI†). A relatively high yield is obtained with a reactant molar ratio of 1:1. Increasing or decreasing this ratio reduces imine yields. It seems that the adsorption or activation of the reactants simultaneously is important for the high performance.

Experimental and theoretical studies have proved that {001} facets such as (004) exhibit high density of active unsaturated Ti atoms and surface O atoms favourable for the dissociation and activation of reactant molecules.13,14,20,22 As obtained from the XRD analysis, TiO2 PCNTs possess a high ratio of (004)/(101). The active Ti site is favourable for the adsorption and activation of phenylacetylene via the interaction of C–H (terminal CC–H), which in turn is favourable for the following hydroamination with aniline.4,23 Therefore, the high adsorption capability of TiO2 PCNTs for phenylacetylene probably enhances the activity of Au/TiO2 PCNTs. The results from Fig. 8 clearly show that TiO2 PCNTs adsorb more phenylacetylene than TiO2 NTs under the same conditions, which further confirms that the high ratio of (004)/(101) induced by the 2D PC layer enhances the imine yield for Au/TiO2 PCNTs. To prove this, we compared the activity of Au/TiO2 NTs with different (004)/(101) ratios. With a high ratio of (004)/(101), Au/TiO2 NTs exhibit high performance in forming the imine product. The TON is 366 and 203.4 for samples (i) and (iii) in Fig. 3a, respectively.

Besides the high ratio of (004)/(101), the enhanced plasmonic effect of Au NPs induced by the 2D PC layer also leads to the high imine yield (TON) of Au/TiO2 PCNTs. The LSPR-excited Au NPs are crucial for the activation of aniline, initiating the hydroamination reaction between phenylacetylene and aniline.4,5,24 The 2D PC layer could dramatically enhance the LSPR absorption of Au NPs, which in turn promote the activation of aniline. To further illustrate the LSPR effect of Au NPs on the reaction, action spectrum was investigated. The reaction time was kept at 7 h since the highest TOF was achieved after 7 h for Au/TiO2 PCNTs. As shown in Fig. 9, imine yields (TON) are in the order of 470–580 nm (41.0) > 580–630 nm (27.0) > 630–700 nm (11.5), which is in agreement with the LSPR absorption of Au NPs. However, highest TON (43.9) is obtained under the light wavelength of 400–470 nm. This is probably caused by the s-to-d interband transition of Au NPs under light irradiation.25,26 Compared with intraband transition (LSPR adsorption), this interband transition could excite more electrons in high energy and generate holes with greater affinity for capturing electrons from the adsorbed molecules,27 achieving the highest TON.

Finally, the reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic hydroamination of phenylacetylene with aniline can be rationalized as follows (Scheme 2). The LSPR excited electrons of Au NPs could migrate to the conduction band of the TiO2 support under light irradiation.4,5,24,28–36 The nucleophilic aniline then could be activated by its interaction with the positively charged Au NPs, forming an Au–NH2(+˙) complex. This activation step of amines (e.g. aniline, benzylamine) on plasmonic Au NPs are proved in our previous studies4,37 and reported by other groups.32,38 In the next step, an electrophilic attack of the activated N-centred radical cation to the electron rich C atom near the phenyl ring of phenylacetylene occurs. Simultaneously, the H atom from aniline is added onto the terminal C atom of Ph–CCH. This step is facilitated by the interaction of the terminal C–H bond of phenylacetylene with active Ti sites. The adsorption and activation of phenylacetylene is further promoted by the high ratio of (004)/(101) for TiO2 PCNTs. The final step is the dissociation of products from the catalyst surface and the recovery of active sites on Au NPs and TiO2 support.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized honeycomb-like anatase TiO2 PCNTs with an extremely strong (004) peak via a two-step anodization process. The 2D PC layer contributes more to the high intensity ratio of (004)/(101) than the bottom NTs, up to 1.32 for TiO2 PCNTs. Results have demonstrated that TiO2 PCNTs is more favourable for the adsorption and activation of phenylacetylene than TiO2 NTs due to the high amount of the reactive (004) facet in the former. The overlapped light absorption of TiO2 PCNTs with loaded-Au NPs in the 2D PC layer enhances the LSPR effect on aniline activation. Illuminating with visible-light from both sides, excellent performance of Au/TiO2 PCNTs is finally achieved for the solvent-free hydroamination of phenylacetylene with aniline. The use of the Au/TiO2 PCNT slice in this reaction also provides a rational strategy for the electrode design in photocatalytic solvent-free organic transformations.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  The schematic for the sample preparation process. (a) Anodization at various potentials for 3 h to obtain TiO2 NTs with different diameters and lengths, (b) ultrasonication to remove the formed TiO2 NTs, (c) anodization at 50 V for 1 h to obtain TiO2 PCNTs, (d) chemical reduction using NaBH4 to load Au NPs onto TiO2 PCNTs.	 

 	Fig. 1  SEM image of TiO2 PCNTs tuned by varying the applied potential at (a) 10 V, (b) 30 V, and (c) 50 V for 3 h in the first-step and 50 V for 1 h in the second-step (inset scale bar 100 nm). The corresponding pore diameter of the 2D photonic crystal layer was calculated by accounting 200 pores.	 

 	Fig. 2  XRD patterns of (a) TiO2 NTs and TiO2 PCNTs, (b) Au/TiO2 NTs and Au/TiO2 PCNTs. The asterisk denotes Ti foil substrate.	 

 	Fig. 3  XRD patterns of TiO2 NTs (a) prepared with different concentration of NH4F during the anodization process and (b) prepared with different temperatures during the calcination process. (i–iii) Refer to 0.3 wt%, 0.6 wt% and 0.9 wt% NH4F, calcined at 450 °C; (iv and v) refer to annealing temperature 400 °C and 500 °C, 0.3 wt% NH4F. The asterisk denotes the Ti foil substrate.	 

 	Fig. 4  SEM images of (a and b) Au/TiO2 PCNTs, (c) location-dependent Au atom percent analysed from the top view and cross-sectional SEM-EDS, and (d) Au NPs size distribution calculated by accounting 200 particles from TEM images (Fig. S4, ESI†) for Au/TiO2 PCNTs.	 

 	Fig. 5  HRTEM analysis of the Au/TiO2 PCNT powder sample scratched off from the Ti foil.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 6  UV-Vis spectra of (i) Au/TiO2 PCNTs and (ii) corresponding powder scratched off from the Ti foil, (iii) TiO2 PCNTs and (v) corresponding powder scratched off from the Ti foil, (iv) TiO2 NTs, (vi) Ti foil. The digital photographs of these samples are provided in Fig. S7 (ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 7  Time-imine yield (TON) for Au/TiO2 PCNTs, TiO2 PCNTs, and Au/TiO2 NTs under visible-light irradiation and in dark. TON = mole of imine per mole of the Au content tested by ICP (Table S2, ESI†). The reaction temperature was kept at 55 °C.	 

 	Fig. 8  UV-Vis spectra of 62.5 mM phenylacetylene before (dark line) and after absorption with one slice of TiO2 NTs (red line) and TiO2 PCNTs (blue line) for 1 h under the same experimental conditions.	 

 	Fig. 9  Action spectrum for the plasmonic hydroamination of phenylacetylene with aniline using Au/TiO2 PCNTs, illuminated with the visible-light wavelength of 400–470 nm, 470–580 nm, 580–630 nm, and 630–700 nm.	 

 	Scheme 2  The proposed reaction mechanism for the plasmonic hydroamination of phenylacetylene with aniline using Au/TiO2 PCNTs.
