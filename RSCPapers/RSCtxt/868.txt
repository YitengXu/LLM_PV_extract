    , Accepted 8th January 2015First published on 8th January 2015AbstractThe three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructure is one of the promising candidates for high performance photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting electrodes due to the reduced carrier diffusion distance, improved light absorption efficiency and charge collection efficiency. Here, by growing omnidirectional, densely packed branches on TiO2 nanowires, we demonstrated a 3D hyperbranched hierarchical TiO2 nanowire (HHNW) architecture that could significantly enhance the performance of PEC water splitting. Under a solar simulator with chopped AM 1.5G light of 100 mW cm−2 intensity, the HHNW electrode yielded a photocurrent density of 1.21 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which was about four times higher than that of TiO2 nanowires (NWs) (0.34 mA cm−2). The highest incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) obtained from our HHNWs was 77% at 365–425 nm. This greatly improved PEC performance can be attributed to the improved light absorption efficiency and the increased contact surface areas at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the efficient ways to convert sunlight to the cleanest fuel – hydrogen. The development of photoelectrode materials with a suitable bandgap for efficient light harvesting and fast water oxidation is one of the key challenges for PEC water splitting.1–10 Since the pioneering work of the practical PEC water splitting using n-type TiO2 was reported by Honda and Fujishima in 1972,11 various metal oxide semiconductors,12–19 including TiO2,12–14 ZnO,15–17 α-Fe2O3,18 WO3,19 and composited semiconductors,20 have been investigated as photoanodes for PEC water splitting. Among all these photoelectrodes, TiO2 has attracted the most attention due to its excellent photocatalytic activity, appropriate band edge positions, high photochemical stability, low cost and non-toxicity. The conventional TiO2 photoanode is in the form of a nanoparticle (NP) based film because of its large surface area to volume ratio.12,21 However, the photo-induced electrons suffer serious recombination at the interfaces in the NP based films where the electron diffusion is slow.22 Due to the significant electron trapping at grain boundaries, the electron diffusion coefficient of these NP based films is several orders of magnitude lower than that of one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructures.23 1D nanostructures can also decouple the directions of light absorption and provide a direct electron transport pathway for these semiconductor arrays to conductive substrates, thus reducing the carrier diffusion length and improving the charge collection efficiency. Therefore, much effort has been focused on 1D nanostructured metal oxide arrays grown on conductive substrates such as nanowires (NWs)24,25 and nanotubes (NTs).26,27
1D architectures made of NWs and NTs usually have a relatively low surface area and contain a large volume of free space within them. To further improve the PEC device performance, it is highly desirable to synthesize three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures,28,29 such as nanobranches6,30–32 and nanoflowers,33–36 for improving light harvesting efficiency and enhancing contact surface areas at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. Nevertheless, most of the demonstrated 1D nanostructures have either sparsely or tiny distributed branches and normally possess a lower internal surface area than the conventional 20 nm nanoparticle counterpart, leaving much room for improvement.
In this paper, we report on the preparation of a 3D hyperbranched hierarchical TiO2 nanowire (HHNW) array as a model photoanode for efficient PEC water splitting. The HHNWs maintain an efficient electron transport almost as good as TiO2 NWs, but have improved light absorption and increased contact surface areas between electrode materials and electrolytes due to their omnidirectional, densely packed hyperbranched nanostructure. The designed advantage of the HHNW structure has been demonstrated by its measured photocurrent density of 1.21 mA cm−2 at an applied bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than those of NW (0.34 mA cm−2) and hierarchical TiO2 nanowire (HNW) electrodes (0.75 mA cm−2).
Experimental section
Chemicals
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (1.5 × 2 cm), titanium tetrachloride (99.9%. Aladdin), hydrochloric acid (36.0–38.0 wt%, Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co., Ltd), and titanium trichloride solution (20 wt% of TiCl3 in H2O and HCl solution, Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co., Ltd) were used. All reagents were used directly without any further purification.
Preparation of aligned TiO2 nanowires (NWs)
TiO2 NWs were synthesized directly on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by a modified hydrothermal method according to a previous report.23 In a typical synthesis process, FTO substrates (1.5 × 2 cm) were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol and deionized (DI) water each for 15 min and then dried in air. As a precursor solution, 0.25 mL of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) was slowly added into a solution mixture of 30 mL of hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (36.0–38.0 wt%) and 30 mL of DI water, and then magnetically stirred for 30 min. Two pieces of FTO substrates were fixed on a home-made Teflon-socket at an angle against the horizontal plane with their conductive sides facing down. Then the Teflon-socket and the hydrothermal solution were transferred into a sealed Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor, which was then placed in an electric oven and hydrothermal treatment was conducted at 150 °C for 6 h. After the reaction was completed and the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the as-prepared sample was taken out and rinsed extensively with ethanol and DI water, and dried at room temperature.
Preparation of hierarchical TiO2 nanowires (HNWs)
A two-step procedure was employed for synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 NWs. The as-prepared NWs from the above process were first immersed in a high concentration (0.4 M) TiCl4 aqueous solution and kept at 100 °C for 1 h to obtain a densely seeded surface. Then these seeded NWs were immersed into the same solution as described in the Preparation of aligned TiO2 nanowires section for further hydrothermal treatment of 3 h to grow HNWs.
Preparation of 3D hyperbranched hierarchical TiO2 nanowires (HHNWs)
For synthesis of the omnidirectional densely packed hyperbranched nanostructure, HNWs were annealed in air at 450 °C for 30 min, then immersed in an aqueous solution consisting of 10 mL of DI water, 0.3 mL of HCl, and 0.15 mL of TiCl3 solution (20 wt% of TiCl3 in H2O and HCl solution) in a Pyrex glass bottle, and finally kept at 80 °C for 2 h in an oven. The as-prepared samples were thoroughly washed with DI water followed by ethanol, and subsequently annealed at 450 °C for 1 h in air.
Material characterization
The microstructure of the samples was characterized using a Quanta 400 FEG field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin field-emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM); X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to study the crystal structure of the samples with a Bruker D8 diffractometer; the Raman spectra were also used to analyze the structure information of the as-obtained samples with a LabRAM HR evolution Raman spectrometer; diffused reflectance spectra were collected on the samples using a Perkin-Elmer UV/vis spectrophotometer (model Lambda 20); the light source (Oriel solar simulator, 450 W Xe lamp, AM 1.5 global filter) was calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using an optical power meter (Newport, model 1916-C) equipped with a Newport 818P thermopile detector. The electrochemical data were collected by using a Zahner Zennium C-IMPS system.
Photoelectrochemical performance test
NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs were used as the working electrode; a Pt net served as the counter electrode; and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. The reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) calculation was based on the equation: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.1976 V + 0.059 pH. All three electrodes were immersed in a quartz electrolytic cell; the photoelectrode was covered by ethoxyline except for a window for light illumination. N2 gas was purged through the cell during the measurement to instantaneously flush away O2 from the working electrode and H2 from the counter electrode.
Results and discussion
A schematic illustration of the fabrication process of the HHNW structure is shown in Fig. 1. The as-obtained structures were characterized after each step of growth by FE-SEM. As shown in Fig. 2a, the NWs after the first growth step have an average diameter of around 150 nm and the coverage density is evaluated to be around 6.0 × 109 NWs cm−2. Fig. 2b shows a side-view high-magnification SEM image (45° tilting) of the NWs. The top facets of the NW are square, which exhibit the expected growth habit of tetragonal crystals, while the side facets are smooth. From the cross-sectional view in Fig. S1,† it can be observed that the NWs are nearly vertically aligned on the FTO substrate and the height of the NW array is around 2 μm. Compared with those NWs from other studies,13,23,24 the NWs reported here exhibit smaller average diameter and more uniform distribution on the FTO substrate. It has been found that the aggregation of NWs in the previous work dramatically decreased the contact surface area at TiO2/electrolyte interfaces and hence compromised the PEC device performance. In this work, the uniformly dispersed NWs show a larger surface area, and thus offer more active sites for photoelectrochemical reactions. In the second growth step, after being immersed in high concentration (0.4 M) TiCl4 aqueous solution, the surfaces of the NWs are decorated by TiO2 seeds (Fig. S2†), which is introduced according to the following reactions:32TiCl4 + H2O → Ti(IV) complex + HClTi(IV) complex → TiO2

It has been reported that the presence of the seeds on the surfaces can result in a reduction in the energy barrier for TiO2 nucleation.17 A subsequent hydrothermal growth of the seeded NWs for 3 h results in densely assembled “flower”-like HNWs, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The HNWs are approximately 150 nm in length and 50 nm in diameter. The final step is to grow branches on the HNWs for further increasing the roughness factor by filling out the large volume of voids in the HNW assembly. Here, TiCl3 solution was used as the Ti precursors to grow nanobranches in this step. The reason was that Ti3+ ions need to be first oxidated to Ti4+ ions in an oxygen-containing aqueous solution. In this way, it would reduce the nucleation rate of TiO2, resulting in the formation of TiO2 nanobranches with smaller diameters. As we know, the presence of Cl− ions in the formation of NW structure was to suppress growth of the (110) faces but enhance the growth along the (001) direction.23Fig. 2e and f show the typical SEM images of the final HHNWs, where numerous short needle-shaped hyperbranches are grown densely on the entire surfaces of the HNW backbones (cross-sectional view in Fig. S3†). The hyperbranches have an average diameter and length of about 10 nm and 50 nm, respectively. The unique HHNW structure will largely improve the specific surface area and roughness factor of the nanowires.17 The BET surface areas of the TiO2 NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs are listed in Table S1.† An increasing trend in the specific surface areas and roughness factor from NWs to HHNWs is evidenced, as expected.
The structure information of TiO2 NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs was characterized by XRD and Raman spectra. Fig. 3a shows XRD patterns of NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs on FTO substrates. The crystal structure of all three samples can be assigned to the tetragonal rutile phase (JCPDS card no. 21-1276). The enhanced (002) peak at a 2-theta of 63.20° in the bottom spectrum indicates that the NWs are well crystallized and grow preferentially along the [001] direction with the growth axis parallel to the FTO substrate. The (002) peak intensity becomes weaker in the XRD patterns of HNWs and HHNWs, which is due to the fact that the root NWs are enclosed by non-aligned nanobranches. The three samples show similar Raman peaks associated with the lattice vibration of rutile TiO2 (Fig. 3b). The three broad peaks at 237, 446, and 612 cm−1 can be attributed to the rutile phase, which is consistent with XRD results. It should be noted that a weak peak appears at 144 cm−1 in the HNWs and HHNWs, but is absent in the NWs. This peak can be attributed to the characteristic vibration of anatase TiO2,37 which could be explained by the formation of a very small amount of anatase-phase nanoparticles on the rutile-phase HNWs and HHNWs when the NWs are treated with high concentration TiCl4 aqueous solution. The band gap information of FTO, rutile and anatase is shown in Fig. 3c. It should be noted that the existence of the anatase nanoparticles could potentially help the charge separation due to the heterojunction band alignment effect.38

The morphologies and crystal structures of the NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs have also been characterized by FE-TEM. Fig. 4a shows a representative TEM image of a NW. Fig. 4b shows a high-resolution TEM image taken from region A in Fig. 4a. Lattice fringes with inter-planar spacings of 0.325 nm and 0.295 nm can be indexed to (110) and (001) planes of the tetragonal rutile phase, respectively. The results indicate that the NW is a single-crystalline tetragonal rutile phase with the [001] growth direction, which is consistent with the results of TiO2 NWs reported previously.6,23Fig. 4c shows a typical TEM image of a flower-like HNW assembly comprising NW bundles that are developed from TiO2 seeds. The TEM image in Fig. 4d shows that the hyperbranches densely and uniformly grow on the surfaces of the HNWs. Close inspection of the branches (Fig. 4e) demonstrates that they grow randomly on the backbone of the HNWs and possess a surface coverage density of around 1.0 × 1011 branches per cm2 (per unit area of NW) (Fig. 4d). Fig. 4f shows a HRTEM image of a single branch taken from region B in Fig. 4e. It shows well resolved lattice fringes, indicating good crystallinity of the branches. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in the inset is indexed to the (110) planes of rutile TiO2 with a lattice constant of 0.325 nm, in the parallel direction to the length of the branch, suggesting that the branches are also single-crystalline tetragonal-rutile phase TiO2 with the same [001] growth direction as that of the backbone. Similar flower-like TiO2 structures were recently synthesized and used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),32 but our HHNWs have smaller diameters, higher surface coverage, and a lower degree of aggregation, which will be beneficial to PEC devices.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of HHNWs for improving PEC water splitting, we compared several measurement results using TiO2 films of three different nanostructures: NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs. One key measurement was the current density versus potential (J–V) under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The J–V curves of the TiO2 films supported on FTO substrates were measured in 1 M NaOH using a standard three-electrode configuration. As shown in Fig. 5a, sweeping the potential anodically, the J–V curve of the HHNWs exhibits a sharp increase of current and reaches a prompt saturation of the photocurrent density at about 0.8 V versus RHE. The photocurrent densities of the NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs are 0.34, 0.75, and 1.21 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE, respectively. The nearly 4-fold current density increase of the HHNWs over NWs demonstrates much higher light harvesting efficiency and largely increased contact surface area at the TiO2/electrolyte interface of the hyperbranched hierarchical structure, which can significantly enhance the PEC water splitting performance.

(f) The average transit time of photogenerated electrons at 1.23 V vs. RHE as a function of the maximal photocurrent density for NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs grown on FTO substrates. A 385 nm LED lamp was used as the light source for the IMPS measurement. 
The chemical and structural stability during PEC water splitting is another important factor to evaluate for the potential PEC electrode materials. The corresponding transient time-dependent curves of NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs show a highly stable photocurrent density of 0.34 ± 0.02, 0.75 ± 0.03, and 1.21 ± 0.03 mA cm−2, respectively, at an applied bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE during 6 repeated light ON/OFF cycles (20 s duration for each cycle), as shown in Fig. 5b. It can be seen that the NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs have fast photo-response time and stable photo-stability. The dark current density remained at a very low level (<10−2 mA cm−2) under bias potentials between 0 and 2 V, indicating the high quality of the TiO2 crystal surfaces. Rectangular shaped photocurrent transients indicate a rapid photoresponse and a good reproducibility of the photoanodic processes.
Applied bias photon-to-current efficiencies (ABPEs) were calculated using the equation12 (1)where JP is the photocurrent density, Emeas is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination, and Eaoc is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the same working electrode at open circuit conditions under the same illumination and in the same electrolyte, and I0 is the intensity of incident light in mW cm−2.31,38 The calculated ABPEs of the NW, HNW, and HHNW samples are plotted as a function of biasing potential as shown in Fig. 5c, where the NW and HNW samples exhibit optimal ABPEs of 0.22% at 0.61 V versus RHE and 0.43% at 0.56 V versus RHE, respectively. Impressively, a maximum efficiency of 0.71% at 0.55 V versus RHE for the HHNW sample is achieved. In addition, statistical histograms shown in the ESI† indicate that the photoelectrode conversion efficiency of the HHNWs is much higher than those of NWs and HNWs.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), synonymous with external quantum efficiency (EQE), is another key parameter to evaluate the PEC materials. It can be calculated from the following equation:9IPCE = (1240 × I)/λ × Plightwhere I is the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2) at a specific wavelength, λ is the incident light wavelength (nm), and Plight (mW cm−2) is the power density of monochromatic light at a specific wavelength. To further understand the overall PEC performance of the HHNW sample, IPCEs of the NW, HNW, and HHNW samples were measured at 1.23 V versus RHE as a function of incident light wavelength. As shown in Fig. 5d, the peak IPCE values of NWs, HNWs and HHNWs are 42%, 60%, and 77%, respectively, at wavelengths of 375–425 nm. Such an IPCE enhancement for HHNWs is presumably due to the improved surface area arising from the branched hierarchical structure. This result indicates that our HHNWs could effectively use the UV light for PEC water splitting, and the separation and transportation of photoexcited charge carriers are very efficient. Moreover, it is widely known that the enhancement of light scattering by TiO2 photoanode films is crucial for improving the light harvesting efficiency.40,41 To study the light scattering efficiency, the reflectivity of all three films was evaluated (Fig. 5e). As expected, the HHNWs and HNWs exhibit much higher diffuse reflectance in the visible and near-infrared regions compared to NWs. The HHNWs show the highest diffuse reflectance among the three films, which can be ascribed to the intrinsic optical properties of the omnidirectional, densely packed hyperbranched nanostructure. The complicated and interconnected network architecture within the HHNW photoelectrode could effectively multiply the light absorption path length and increase the optical density, thus enabling high scattering efficiency. This contributes to the elevated photocurrent density.
The charge transport behaviors in the PEC electrodes can be studied by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS),42,43 which is also widely used in electron transport characterization of DSSCs. The average transport time for the photogenerated electrons to reach the conductive substrate, τd, can be derived from the IMPS measurements according to the equation: τd = 1/2πfd, where fd is the characteristic minimum frequency of the IMPS imaginary component.44Fig. 5f depicts τd of photogenerated electrons as a function of the maximal photocurrent density under an illumination of 385 nm from an LED light source. An obvious similarity in electron transport time is observed for PEC cells made of NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs, suggesting that the electrons in these hierarchical structures can transit as efficient as NWs.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully prepared a new photoanode architecture of hyperbranched hierarchical TiO2 nanowires (HHNWs) for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting. Compared to NWs and HNWs, the HHNWs show significantly improved PEC performance due to enhanced light absorption and increased contact surface area at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. Under a solar simulator with AM 1.5G light of 100 mW−2 intensity, the photocurrent densities of NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs at an applied bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE are 0.34, 0.75, and 1.21 mA cm−2, respectively. The highest incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) obtained from our HHNWs is 77% around 375–425 nm, which is much better than those of NWs (42%) and HNWs (60%) in the same UV wavelength range. We believe that the HHNWs can be used in conjunction with doping and/or dye-sensitization to further improve the PEC performance of TiO2. Overall, this approach has opened a promising avenue to develop high-efficiency PEC photoelectrodes that could have substantial impacts on the PEC and photovoltaic device development.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication process of the HHNW structure.	 

 	Fig. 2  Top-view and side-view SEM images of (a and b) TiO2 NWs, (c and d) HNWs, and (e and f) HHNWs.	 

 	Fig. 3  XRD patterns (a) and Raman spectra (b) of TiO2 NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs on FTO substrates. (c) The band gap information of the three different materials (FTO, rutile and anatase TiO2).	 

 	Fig. 4  TEM and HRTEM images of TiO2 NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs on FTO substrates. (a) TEM image of a single NW. (b) HRTEM image taken from region A in (a). (c) TEM image of a flower-like HNW assembly. (d) Low- and (e) high-magnification TEM images of the HHNW structure, (f) HRTEM image taken from region B in (e) and the SAED pattern (inset).	 

 	Fig. 5  Photoelectrochemical properties of NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs on FTO substrates. (a) J–V curves measured under xenon lamp illumination using a three-electrode setup (TiO2 as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, scan rate of 20 mV s−1). (b) Time-dependent photocurrent density at repeated 30 s light on/off cycles of simulated sunlight illumination. (c) Applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE, %) of three different photoelectrodes as a function of applied potential based on the calculation method reported previously.39 (d) IPCE measured in the wavelength range of 375–500 nm. All samples were measured at an applied bias of 1.23 V versus RHE. (e) Diffuse reflectance spectra of films of NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs grown on FTO substrates over a wavelength range of 350–800 nm. (f) The average transit time of photogenerated electrons at 1.23 V vs. RHE as a function of the maximal photocurrent density for NWs, HNWs, and HHNWs grown on FTO substrates. A 385 nm LED lamp was used as the light source for the IMPS measurement.
