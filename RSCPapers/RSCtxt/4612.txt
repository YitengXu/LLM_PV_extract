    , Accepted 7th March 2011First published on 25th March 2011AbstractA model system for photoreduction of CO2 to CO using visible light has been extensively studied, using a catalyst for which the CO2/CO reaction is electrochemically reversible. The hybrid system comprises metal oxide nanoparticles functionalised with the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), and sensitised to visible light using a ruthenium bipyridyl photosensitiser. An anatase/rutile TiO2 mixture (Evonik Degussa P25) was selected as the most suitable semiconductor, and CO production rates and stability were examined as a function of each component (photosensitiser, enzyme and TiO2). Tolerance to O2 and effects of different electron donors were also investigated, together with strategies to control enzyme binding at the surface of TiO2 in order to enhance overall activity.

Broader context
Solar radiation is both intermittent and geographically diffuse, and therefore before solar energy can be useful on a large scale, we must devise methods of converting it into storable fuels. Aside from water, an attractive precursor to a ‘solar fuel’ is the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2). Reduction products of CO2 are either already used as fuels (methanol, methane), or can be transformed to useable fuels via established technologies (e.g. Fisher-Tropsch conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) to liquid hydrocarbons). Here, we present detailed studies of a model system for efficient photoreduction of CO2 to CO using metal oxide nanoparticles modified with an enzyme (carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, CODH) and sensitised to visible light with a ruthenium bipyridyl photosensitiser. Operating as a suspension of nanoparticles in water at 20 °C, the optimised system has a turnover frequency of 0.14 s−1 CODH−1. This value should be considered in the light of CODH being an extremely efficient catalyst (requiring very little driving force) with a high inherent turnover frequency. While this system is not a technology, it provides a benchmark for what must be achievable and improvable using synthetic catalysts inspired by the active site structure of CODH and its surrounding architecture.

Introduction
There is major interest in developing new technologies for harnessing ‘green’ energy from renewable sources. Direct solar power offers an obvious way forward: the sun provides the Earth's surface with energy at an average rate of 120,000 TW, which is four orders of magnitude larger than the current rate of energy consumption.1 The conversion of solar energy into electricity has received attention for many years, and photovoltaic devices are now in widespread commercial and residential use.2 However, a separate area of research, at present mainly at the ‘bench’ academic level, focuses on systems (aside from biological photosynthesis) for the production of solar fuels, allowing energy from the sun to be stored and transported. Although the most obvious candidate for a solar fuel is dihydrogen (H2) produced from water (a ‘limitless’ resource, globally), this is not the only option. The greenhouse gas CO2, once concentrated, can be reduced to form a number of products, including methanol3 (for use in fuel cells) and CO (which can be readily converted into liquid fuels). There is increasing interest in developing ways to activate CO2 and accomplish its reduction and conversion to valuable chemical commodities. Industrially, CO has been valued for many years as a synthetic feedstock for major industrial processes including the Fisher-Tropsch, Monsanto and Cativa processes.
The electrochemical (and photoelectrochemical) activation of CO2 is fundamentally challenging, owing to the highly uphill thermodynamics of the one-electron transfer to form CO2•− (E = −1.9 V vs. SHE in water, corrected to pH 7).4,5 A good catalyst either transfers two electrons together (including oxygen atom transfer) or stabilises the CO2•− intermediate. Electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction have advanced significantly from the report by Van Rysselberghe et al. in 1944 using a dropping mercury cathode,6 but major challenges remain in terms of selectivity, stability, efficiency and rate. In most cases, significant overpotentials (hundreds of mV) are required to drive the reaction, representing wasted energy. Among surface electrocatalysts, Cu is the best electrode material, but several products are obtained and overpotential requirements are high.7 In efforts to minimise the overpotential requirement, DuBois and coworkers have developed molecular electrocatalysts based on palladium-triphosphine complexes.8–12 Although rates are fast (rate constants of 10–300 M−1 s−1 for monometallic complexes and >104 M−1 s−1 for bimetallic Pd complexes) and overpotentials needed to drive the reaction are moderately small (0.1 to 0.3 V), the Pd(I) catalysts decompose after 10–100 turnovers.13 Deronzier and co-workers report relatively low overpotential requirements at polymeric [{(Ru0(bpy)(CO)2}n] (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) thin films immobilised on carbon electrodes in aqueous solution.14–16 However, the films are unstable at potentials higher than −0.60 V vs. SHE. Savéant discovered that iron(0) porphyrins under weakly acidic conditions gave high rates (350 h−1), but still required highly reducing potentials (−1.5 V vs. SCE) and a mercury electrode.17 A relatively stable electrocatalyst is the Kubiak binuclear copper complex, [Cu2(μ-PPh2bpy)2-(MeCN)2][PF6]2, (PPh2bpy = 6-diphenylphosphino-2,2′-bipyridyl), which is fully recoverable after a 24 h experiment. However, turnover rates are slow (2 h−1) even at a substantial overpotential (E = −1.53 V vs. SCE). None of these catalysts are suited for sustained CO production with minimal solar energy input, but a recent report from Bocarsly et al. shows pyridinium-catalysed CO2 reduction with a low overpotential requirement, proceeding through multiple steps to methanol.18
In biology, the interconversion of CO and CO2 is catalysed by a class of enzymes called carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs).19 The anaerobic organism Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans (Ch) expresses five CODHs, each having an unusual [Ni4Fe-4S] active site.20 These enzymes (termed [Ni]-CODHs) are homodimeric, with each subunit containing a buried active site that is wired to the protein surface by a chain of [4Fe-4S] clusters. Electrons enter or leave the enzyme through the distal cluster (D-cluster) that is shared between the two subunits. Insight into the mechanism stems from crystallographic studies. At reducing potentials, CO2 binds as a bridging ligand between the Ni and the dangling Fe atom to give a square planar arrangement around Ni; then, a CO unit migrates to Ni, and an OH unit forms on Fe.21 Although the primary roles of Ch CODH I and Ch CODH II are to oxidise CO (coupling it to proton reduction to release energy), studies by protein film electrochemistry (PFE)22 have shown that the catalysis is fully reversible: this means that the net reaction in either direction is driven at minimal overpotential. Using conventional kinetic assays, high turnover frequencies have been reported for CO oxidation by Ch [Ni]-CODHs (up to around 30,000 s−1 at pH 8, 70 °C).23 From PFE measurements the catalytic bias at pH 8 is strongly in favour of CO oxidation, but at pH 6 the activities are approximately equal in either direction.22
In a recent communication24 we outlined a hybrid enzyme-modified nanoparticle system for achieving clean reduction of CO2 to CO using visible light as the energy source. This system avoids the unfavourable one-electron activation and instead harnesses the enzymatic two-electron reduction pathway. Our prototype was based upon an aqueous dispersion (pH 6) of TiO2 nanoparticles. The TiO2 used (Evonik Degussa P25) contains anatase and rutile in a ratio of 3:1, and is understood to contain separate anatase and rutile phases25 (average particle sizes 25 nm and 85 nm, respectively). The presence of an additional amorphous TiO2 component is under debate.26,27 The nanoparticles were modified by attachment of Ch CODH I and a Ru photosensitiser, [RuII(bpy)2(4,4′-(PO3H2)2-bpy)]Br2 (‘RuP’). The principle (Fig. 1) is that, following excitation (MLCT) with visible light, RuP injects electrons into the TiO2 conduction band (∼−0.52 V for anatase, pH 6).28 These electrons are then able to enter CODH through the D-cluster, and are transferred through a second [4Fe-4S] cluster to the active site, where CO2 is reduced to CO. Following oxidation, the dye is regenerated by a sacrificial electron donor (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) unless otherwise stated). The TiO2 valence band is not disturbed.

D represents a sacrificial electron donor, used to regenerate the dye following photoinjection into MOx. Dimensions of each species are approximately to scale for when MOx is a Degussa P25 anatase TiO2 nanoparticle. 
We identified two aspects of the photocatalyst for improvement. Firstly, the overall turnover rate is lower than expected for a system that incorporates such an efficient enzyme: we measured a turnover rate (averaged over 4 h) of around 0.14 mol CO produced (mol CODH)−1 s−1 (20 °C, pH 6) (only 504 h−1). Secondly, the system is unstable over a time period of several hours, with the CO production rate after 4 h falling to around 25% of its initial rate. However, despite these apparent shortcomings, the system promises to be an excellent model and a benchmark for what should be possible. Consequently, we now present a detailed characterisation of the system, in view of measuring performances in terms of overall activity and stability over a period of several hours. We thus ascertain what is easily achievable using solar energy.
Experimental procedures
Materials
All starting materials were obtained from commercial suppliers; they were of the highest available purity and used as received unless otherwise noted. Nanoparticles were obtained from Evonik Degussa (P25 TiO2), or Sigma (anatase, rutile, ZnO and SrTiO3). Solutions were prepared with purified water (Millipore, 18 MΩ cm). Buffered solutions containing only MES, or combinations of MES, triethanolamine (TEOA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were titrated to the desired pH with NaOH or HCl at the experimental temperature. [RuII(bpy)2(4,4′-(PO3H2)2-bpy)]Br2 (‘RuP’) was prepared according to a published procedure.29 Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans were purified with only slight modifications of the procedure described previously23 (Supplementary Information). CODH from Moorella thermoacetica (Mt) was purified as described previously.30,31 A further sample of Oligotropha carboxydovorans (Oc) CODH was kindly provided by Prof. Hille.
Independent determination of the CO2 reduction activity of Ch CODH I
We performed a solution assay to determine the inherent CO2 reduction activity of Ch CODH I under the same conditons as the photocatalyst (pH 6, 20 °C), using reduced methyl viologen (MV•+, E0 = −0.44 V) as an electron donor (Supplementary Information). From six measurements (each carried out in an anaerobic glove box, O2 < 3 ppm) we obtained an average turnover frequency of 95 s−1. Noting this is an enzyme from a thermophilic organism, this rate, which is much lower than that measured for CO oxidation at 70 °C, still compares favourably with synthetic catalysts.
Assembly of functionalised nanoparticles
Suspensions of functionalised nanoparticles were prepared according to the following procedure, which was carried out anaerobically in a glovebox (Belle, O2 < 3 ppm). Firstly, nanoparticles were dispersed in 5 mL of aqueous buffer solution by sonication for 20 min in a Pyrex pressure vessel (total volume 9 mL, once sealed). A solution of CODH was then added, and the suspension stirred gently at room temperature for 20 min to allow adsorption of enzyme molecules to the nanoparticles. To photosensitise the particles to visible light, the desired amount of RuP (λmax = 455 nm) was added from a buffered aqueous stock solution (0.5 mg mL−1), before stirring for 20 min to allow adsorption. The particles were kept in suspension by gentle stirring at all times between assembly and completion of photochemical experiments.
For our benchmark system, we used 5 mg P25 TiO2 (as described earlier), 200 mM MES (pH 6) as buffer, 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I (20 μL of 128 μM solution) and 56 nmol RuP (0.05 mg; 100 μL of 0.5 mg mL−1 stock solution). Samples prepared in this way, using these amounts of components, will be referred to as our ‘standard system.’
Photocatalytic CO production
To evaluate the performance of the functionalised nanoparticles for CO2 photoreduction, the pressure vessel containing the suspension was sealed tightly with a rubber septum, before purging the headspace with 98% CO2/2% CH4 for 20 min while stirring. The particles were then irradiated with visible light, at a distance of 7 cm. The light source used was a Kodak Carousel S-AV 1010 projector fitted with a 250 W (24 V) tungsten-halogen bulb and a 420 nm long-pass filter (UQG Optics). The light intensity at the position of the photocatalyst was 45 mW cm−2, measured using a Melles Griot Broadband Power/Energy Meter, model number 13PEM001. The suspension was stirred gently throughout CO production experiments, and the temperature was regulated with a water bath connected to a thermostatted water circulator (VWR Model 1146D). The production of CO was detected by gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 7890A GC equipped with a Restek ShinCarbon ST micropacked column held isothermally at 34 °C) using He carrier gas and a thermal conductivity detector. The amount of CO was quantified against the internal standard (2% CH4) with reference to calibration plots obtained with various known amounts of CO (Supplementary Information).
Spectrophotometric CODH and RuP adsorption studies
The extent of adsorption and desorption of various amounts of CODH and RuP on nanoparticles was quantified by analysing the absorbance of solutions at 280 nm (for CODH) and 455 nm (for RuP) before and after stirring for 20 min with nanoparticles. After stirring, the nanoparticles were removed by centrifugation (10 min at 8000 rpm) followed by filtration. The extinction coefficients are 146 mM−1 cm−1 at 280 nm (Ch CODH I) and 8.49 mM−1 cm−1 at 455 nm (RuP).
Results and discussion
Coverage of Ch CODH I and RuP on P25 TiO2: effect on CO production rate
In our standard system, 5 mg P25 TiO2 (in a 5 mL suspension) is functionalised with 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I and 56 nmol RuP to form the photocatalyst. The effect of varying the amount of RuP and Ch CODH I on total CO production (over 4 h) is shown in Fig. 2. In panel A, the amount of RuP photosensitiser (56 nmol) remained constant in all experiments; and in panel B, the amount of Ch CODH I (2.56 nmol) remained constant in all experiments.
 Fig. 2  Black data points: total visible light-driven CO production at 20 °C after 4 h, by systems prepared with varying amounts of (A) Ch CODH I, and (B) RuP. In panel A, all systems were prepared with 56 nmol RuP; and in panel B, all systems were prepared with 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I. In each experiment, Ch CODH I was adsorbed onto the P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (5 mg) before sensitising with RuP, and the buffer was 200 mM MES (pH 6). Red data points: amounts of Ch CODH I and RuP adsorbed on 5 mg P25 TiO2. These data were calculated from UV-vis spectrophotometry measurements (Supplementary Information), using the relative intensities of the peaks at 280 nm (CODH) or 455 nm (RuP) before and after stirring with nanoparticles for 20 min. In the RuP adsorption study (Panel B, red data points), the nanoparticles were first modified by adsorption of 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I prior to RuP, in order to be consistent with the photocatalyst preparation method. 
At low loadings of Ch CODH I on 5 mg P25 TiO2 (below around 1 nmol, panel A) the total turnover of the system depends heavily on the amount of enzyme used to prepare the nanoparticles. However, functionalisation with Ch CODH I in excess of around 1 nmol has little effect on the total CO production. This insensitivity to higher enzyme concentration is not due to the TiO2 surface becoming saturated with enzyme molecules, as UV-vis spectrophotometry showed that the amount of CODH taken up by the nanoparticles is almost complete at all concentrations used (panel A, red data points). However, what is unknown is how much of this enzyme is adsorbed in an electroactive state (i.e. so that electrons can be readily transferred from semiconductor to D-cluster). Images of the functionalised nanoparticles were collected by electron microscopy (the enzyme has a distinctive shape that might be recognisable) but the resolution was not high enough to reveal bound enzyme molecules.
For an alternative suggestion, we can use CODH ‘footprint’ dimensions of 88 Å × 60 Å,32 and a P25 TiO2 BET surface area33 of 50 m2 g−1 to give the theoretical (upper limit) amount of enzyme required for monolayer coverage on 5 mg P25 TiO2. The calculated value of approximately 8 nmol (Supplementary Information) is marginally larger than the amounts of enzyme used in Fig. 2 (up to 5 nmol), although the calculation assumes, ideally, a close-packing arrangement. Therefore, we speculate that amounts of CODH in excess of 1 nmol may be sufficient to initiate multi-layer formation. In such a case, the extra distance between second-/outerlayer enzyme molecules and the TiO2 surface would hinder electron transfer, rendering the excess enzyme molecules redundant.
At low amounts of RuP photosensitiser (up to around 40 nmol, panel B), total CO production over 4 h depends on the amount used in assembly. Above this point, addition of extra RuP has little (if any) effect on the total CO production. As with the CODH dependence described above, this is not due to the surface becoming saturated with RuP above this point: the red data points in Fig. 2, panel B show that the amount of RuP adsorbed is approximately proportional to the amount that is supplied. Instead, we propose that at RuP loadings in excess of 40 nmol, the rate of electron injection into TiO2 is sufficiently high for the amount of electroactive CODH being supplied. Crucially, the system is not limited by the light source: halving the distance of the lamp from the reaction vessel (thereby increasing light intensity by a factor of four), led to no increase in CO production.
Semiconductor variation
The role of the semiconductor in the photocatalyst is two-fold. Firstly, it acts as a scaffold for enzyme and dye molecules: experiments in which TiO2 is omitted yield no detectable CO, nor do experiments in which phosphate (25 mM, in great excess over enzyme/photosensitiser) is present, since phosphate blocks all available binding sites. Secondly, the conduction band maintains the energy of the photoinjected electrons above a minimum potential threshold that is sufficient for CO2 reduction by CODH. We therefore studied the effect of changing the semiconductor to materials other than P25 TiO2 (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  CO production at 5 mL suspensions of various semiconductors (5 mg of nanoparticles, except for ZnO (20 mg)) modified with Ch CODH I (2.56 nmol) and RuP (56 nmol). Each system was prepared and tested according to the protocol detailed in the experimental section. The buffer in each experiment was 200 mM MES, pH 6, 20 °C. The black trace, using P25 TiO2, corresponds to our standard conditions benchmark, as referred to in the main text. 
Experiments in which 5 mg of pure rutile nanoparticles (average diameter < 100 nm) were used showed no detectable CO production over 4 h. UV-vis spectrophotometry indicated low uptake of both enzyme and photosensitiser components (0.71 nmol and 8.3 nmol respectively) to the rutile nanoparticles (Table 1). The lack of CO production is expected because the rutile conduction band (∼−0.32 V vs. SHE at pH 6)34 is too low in energy for CO2 reduction (standard reduction potential of −0.46 V vs. SHE, corrected to pH 6). However, the complete lack of activity also adds weight to our mechanistic interpretation of the system: it rules out the possibility of a pathway for CO2 reduction in which electrons from the photosensitiser pass directly to a neighbouring enzyme molecule, without passing through TiO2 (we might still expect a small amount of CO production from this route). We deduce that the nanoparticles in the P25 TiO2 system have a role beyond providing a mutual support for photosensitiser and enzyme.

When 5 mg of pure anatase nanoparticles (average diameter < 25 nm) was used, the overall activity was similar (within 20%) to that observed with P25. This is expected, since P25 comprises 80% anatase. Comparing photocatalysts prepared with 25 mg and 5 mg P25 TiO2 (Supplementary Information), the total CO production after 4 h was very similar in each case, but the greater quantity of TiO2 gave a more stable system (as shown by a more linear plot). The source of instability is under further investigation.
The surface charge distribution (Supplementary Information) of Ch CODH II (the structure of which is closely related to that of Ch CODH I) shows that there are three highly negatively charged patches near to the D-cluster that is the electron entry point. To promote adsorption of the enzyme in an orientation such that the D-cluster is close to the nanoparticle surface, we investigated zinc oxide as an alternative semiconductor. Although the conduction band energies of anatase and ZnO are very similar, ZnO has a much higher isoelectric point than P25 TiO2 (9.5 compared to 6.2),35,36 and therefore at pH 6 the ZnO surface will carry a significant net positive charge, which we anticipate should favour CODH adsorption in the desired orientation. Due to the slight solubility of ZnO in our buffer solution (5 mL of 200 mM MES, pH 6), 20 mg of ZnO (an excess above the solubility limit) was used in trial CO2 photoreduction experiments, along with standard system amounts of Ch CODH I (2.56 nmol) and RuP (56 nmol). In this system, 0.5 μmol CO was produced after 4 h: 10% of that produced using P25 TiO2. Additionally, CO production appeared to cease after 1 h - possibly due to surface layers of ZnO dissolving over time, with simultaneous desorption of CODH and RuP. Some of the difference in activity may be attributed to poorer binding of dye to ZnO compared to our standard system using P25 TiO2: only around 60% (35.7 nmol) of the 56 nmol RuP added is bound to ZnO after the 20 min adsorption period, compared to almost 100% with P25 TiO2 (Table 1).
Strontium titanate is an attractive option for the semiconductor, due to its conduction band electrons being more reducing than those in anatase (the SrTiO3 conduction band energy is about 0.2 V more negative than that of anatase).37 As shown in Fig. 3, CO2 photoreduction by a SrTiO3-based system under identical conditions (5 mg SrTiO3, 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I, 56 nmol RuP) was poor, with only around 0.5 μmol CO produced after 4 h. This cannot be explained by low uptake of enzyme or photosensitiser (binding of both CODH and RuP is almost complete, Table 1). A likely reason is that the potential difference between the SrTiO3 conduction band and the excited state of the dye is too small to drive rapid electron injection into the semiconductor.
Variation of the amount of P25 TiO2 (Fig. 4A) has significant effect on overall activity. When the amount of P25 TiO2 used in a 5 mL supension is increased from 1 mg to 5 mg, overall activity increases by 150%. This is attributable to the greater available space for adsorption of each component - with 1 mg P25 TiO2, only around 28 nmol of RuP and 1.9 nmol of Ch CODH I is adsorbed. At 25 mg P25 TiO2 the overall activity is no greater than at 5 mg, since there is almost complete adsorption of the two components when using 5 mg, and extra TiO2 surface area is of no use.
 Fig. 4  The effect on activity (measured as the total amount of CO produced over 4 h at 20 °C, relative to the standard system) of (A) variation in mass of P25 TiO2 used, (B) order of nanoparticle functionalisation, (C) inclusion of additional electron donors, and (D) different CODHs. Nanoparticles (always 5 mg, except panel A) were modified with 2.56 nmol CODH (always Ch CODH I except panel D) and 56 nmol RuP. The buffer was always 200 mM MES, except panel C. White asterisks indicate the bars corresponding to the standard system (relative activity 1). 
Other factors
In our previous paper, we ruled out photoinstability (i.e. degradation of RuP or enzyme), substrate depletion and product inhibition as causes of the decrease in activity over time.24 We expect to lose a small amount of activity over 4 h due to detachment of the enzyme molecules (around 20–25%, Supplementary Information) but this does not fully account for the loss of activity over this time (CO production rate in the fourth hour is roughly a quarter of the production rate in the first hour, Fig. 3 black trace). We therefore looked into further factors.
The order in which the nanoparticles are functionalised (i.e. whether enzyme or photosensitiser is adsorbed onto the surface first) has no effect on either overall activity (Fig. 4B) or stability (Supplementary Information). This implies that the existing presence of either Ch CODH I or RuP has no effect on the adsorption of the second component.
Following injection of an electron from the photoexcited state of RuP (‘RuP*’) into TiO2, the photosensitiser must be regenerated by reduction back to its initial state. The electrons for this regeneration are provided by a sacrificial electron donor, which in our benchmark system is MES (already present at 200 mM in order to buffer the high CO2 concentration). More commonly used sacrificial electron donors in photochemical systems are triethanolamine (TEOA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The inclusion of a 25 mM component of TEOA in the aqueous buffer gave no increase in activity (nor stability). However, the same concentration of EDTA produced an enhancement of activity of around 40% (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Information).
We tested four different CODHs (Fig. 4D). CODH I and CODH II from the anaerobic organism Ch showed similar activity (around 5 μmol CO produced after 4 h). Systems using either CODH/ACS (a [Ni]-CODH as part of a complex with ACS, acetyl CoA synthase) from Moorella thermoacetica, or an oxygen-tolerant CODH (a MoFeS flavoprotein containing [2Fe-2S] clusters) from Oligotropha carboxidovorans failed to produce any detectable CO (Supplementary Information).

Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans is an anaerobic organism, and the activity of the CODH enzymes it expresses is known to be heavily suppressed by oxygen. However, for a solar fuel catalyst to be a viable proposition on a large scale, it should ideally be able to function in air, and this led us to evaluate the air (and O2) tolerance of our system. In the experiments shown in Fig. 5, systems were prepared according to the standard system protocol, and irradiated for 1.5 h. Then, for 20 min the suspension of nanoparticles was either purged with O2 (blue line), stirred in air with the seal of the tube removed (red line), or kept sealed and stirred under its existing gas atmosphere (black line). The vessel was then re-sealed (if necessary), and purged with 98% CO2/2% CH4 for 20 min, and irradiation restarted.
 Fig. 5  The effect of exposure to air or O2 on the activity of the functionalised P25 TiO2 nanoparticles at pH 6, 20 °C. After 1.5 h of irradiation, the suspension was either stirred in air (red), purged with O2 (blue), or stirred while remaining sealed for 20 min as a control (black). The tube was then re-sealed and purged with 2% CH4/98% CO2, and irradiation restarted. 
After exposure to O2, the system was almost completely inactivated. Following exposure to air (red trace), the system was largely inactivated, but about 15% of its activity was retained. However, we are confident that leakage of air into the reaction vessel is not responsible for the instability observed in the experiments in Fig. 3. The vessel remains tightly sealed throughout each 4 h experiment, and although the rubber septum is pierced every half hour for GC gas measurements, control experiments in which the septum remained intact (with only one gas measurement at the end of the experiment) yielded very similar amounts of CO (within experimental error of the black trace in Fig. 3).
Surface modifications for directed enzyme binding
During the functionalisation of TiO2 nanoparticles with CODH, enzyme molecules adsorb in the most favourable orientation according to the interaction between the surface residues of the protein and the hydroxylated TiO2 surface. However, the orientation of immobilised CODH molecules is not necessarily the most favourable for electron transfer from TiO2 to the D-cluster. We thus explored some straightforward strategies for controlling the orientation of CODH molecules for enhanced electron transfer into the enzyme. Our approach used ‘linking’ molecules, which bind to the TiO2 surface and provide an anchor for the negatively charged patches of residues around the D-cluster of CODH (described earlier) to bind to.
We tested a range of surface linker modifications, including polymyxin B sulfate as a cationic layer, and glutamic acid (reported to coordinate strongly to TiO2 surfaces)38 with its amine group (protonated at pH 6) providing an anchor. Neither of these methods had any effect on activity, nor stability. Next, we used o-phosphorylethanol amine (OPEA), which contains a phosphonate group for binding to TiO2, and an amine group (again, protonated at pH 6) as an anchor. We modified the TiO2 P25 surface by adding OPEA (0.3 mg per 5 mg of nanoparticles) before adsorption of enzyme, and the effect on CO production is shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  The effect of OPEA modification of TiO2 on CO production. In all experiments, the nanoparticles (5 mg P25 TiO2) were modified with 2.56 nmol Ch CODH (I or II, as indicated) and 56 nmol RuP. The suspension buffer was 5 mL of 200 mM MES (pH 6), 20 °C. 
Rather than having the desired effect, the modifying layer decreased the rate of catalysis, and UV-vis spectrophotometry studies on the buffer solution (Supplementary Information) showed that this is (at least in part) due to lower uptake of enzyme when OPEA is used.
Conclusion
Aqueous suspensions of semiconductor nanoparticles, modified with an efficient enzyme for CO2/CO interconversion, and sensitised to visible light using a ruthenium photosensitiser, provide a model catalytic system for solar fuel generation from CO2. Of the semiconductor materials that we investigated, we found photocatalysts prepared with Evonik Degussa P25 TiO2 (a commercially available 3:1 mixture of anatase/rutile) and ordinary anatase TiO2 nanoparticles to be the most effective, in terms of overall turnover rate. This is in line with these materials a) having conduction band potentials significantly more positive than the excited state potential of our photosensitiser, but also sufficiently reducing to drive very efficient CO2 reduction at CODH; and b) showing high binding affinity for both CODH and photosensitiser. The P25 TiO2-based photocatalyst has a turnover frequency of 0.14 s−1 (average rate per total enzyme molecule over 4 h at 20 °C). Although this is slower than what might be achieved if the enzyme was subjected to highly reducing potentials, we are probably limited here by the narrow driving force of the anatase conduction band electrons for CO2 reduction (around 60 mV). Using the light intensity, and illuminated facial area of the reaction vessel, we estimated an average quantum yield of approximately 0.07%. Our experiments so far have not been designed to optimise quantum efficiency, but to focus on the reproducible effects of enzyme and RuP loading and selection of nanomaterial.
The fact that we could not improve significantly upon a turnover frequency at 20 °C of 0.14 s−1 is intriguing because at this temperature the enzyme is easily able to catalyse CO2 reduction at a rate of nearly 100 s−1 using the methyl viologen radical, formally an uphill reaction based on standard potentials. The inclusion of EDTA as an additional electron donor increases the activity slightly (by around 40%) thus suggesting that the low activity is at least partially rooted in efficient regeneration of the photosensitiser. Our future attention thus turns to investigating different photosensitisers and minimising recombination losses. Another possibility is that CODH is relatively ineffective at retaining electrons before they are trapped during product formation. Recombination rates may be very enzyme dependent. This kind of study, incorporating into a model system an enzyme that is such an efficient and specific catalyst for CO2 reduction, has nonetheless provided a great deal of information and constructive insight into the factors determining rates of solar-driven CO2 reduction.

Broader context
Solar radiation is both intermittent and geographically diffuse, and therefore before solar energy can be useful on a large scale, we must devise methods of converting it into storable fuels. Aside from water, an attractive precursor to a ‘solar fuel’ is the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2). Reduction products of CO2 are either already used as fuels (methanol, methane), or can be transformed to useable fuels via established technologies (e.g. Fisher-Tropsch conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) to liquid hydrocarbons). Here, we present detailed studies of a model system for efficient photoreduction of CO2 to CO using metal oxide nanoparticles modified with an enzyme (carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, CODH) and sensitised to visible light with a ruthenium bipyridyl photosensitiser. Operating as a suspension of nanoparticles in water at 20 °C, the optimised system has a turnover frequency of 0.14 s−1 CODH−1. This value should be considered in the light of CODH being an extremely efficient catalyst (requiring very little driving force) with a high inherent turnover frequency. While this system is not a technology, it provides a benchmark for what must be achievable and improvable using synthetic catalysts inspired by the active site structure of CODH and its surrounding architecture.

D represents a sacrificial electron donor, used to regenerate the dye following photoinjection into MOx. Dimensions of each species are approximately to scale for when MOx is a Degussa P25 anatase TiO2 nanoparticle.	 

 	Fig. 2  Black data points: total visible light-driven CO production at 20 °C after 4 h, by systems prepared with varying amounts of (A) Ch CODH I, and (B) RuP. In panel A, all systems were prepared with 56 nmol RuP; and in panel B, all systems were prepared with 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I. In each experiment, Ch CODH I was adsorbed onto the P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (5 mg) before sensitising with RuP, and the buffer was 200 mM MES (pH 6). Red data points: amounts of Ch CODH I and RuP adsorbed on 5 mg P25 TiO2. These data were calculated from UV-vis spectrophotometry measurements (Supplementary Information), using the relative intensities of the peaks at 280 nm (CODH) or 455 nm (RuP) before and after stirring with nanoparticles for 20 min. In the RuP adsorption study (Panel B, red data points), the nanoparticles were first modified by adsorption of 2.56 nmol Ch CODH I prior to RuP, in order to be consistent with the photocatalyst preparation method.

Each system was prepared and tested according to the protocol detailed in the experimental section. The buffer in each experiment was 200 mM MES, pH 6, 20 °C. The black trace, using P25 TiO2, corresponds to our standard conditions benchmark, as referred to in the main text.
