1. Introduction
As a unique category of conductive, hydrophilic nanomaterials introduced in 2011, MXenes are the most recent addition to the two-dimensional (2D) nanoworld.1–3 MXenes can be transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides (first discovered by Gogotsi et al.), which have recently triggered a large wave of interest in exploring their promising properties and applications towards various research areas.4–8 MXenes are represented as Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–3), where M is an early transition metal such as Ti, Mo, Sc, Hf, Zr, Nb, Cr, Ta, and V, X is C/N or CN and Tx is the surface functional group such as –OH, –F and –O.9 ‘n’ layers of X are covered by ‘n + 1’ layers of M in the order of [MX]nM.1 The exposed chemically reactive outer metal layer of MXenes leads to the formation of surface functionalities.5 Some examples of MXenes are Ti3C2Tx, Ti2CTx, Zr3C2Tx, Nb4C3Tx, and Hf2NTx. In 2011, Ti3C2Tx was discovered as the first MXene.4,10,11 MXenes are categorized according to their composition and atomic lattice into three classes, namely ordered mono-M, ordered double-M, and solid solution M. It has been observed that ordered MXenes are more stable than the solid solutions for a specific arrangement of transition metals, which is in compliance with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To date, over 25 ordered MXenes have been prepared.1,12 In addition to carbides and nitrides, carbonitrides such as Ti3CN have also been developed, and various investigations have been carried out to predict their properties.10,13–15
MXenes are commonly synthesized by the selective removal of the A layer from their MAX or non-MAX phase parents by acid etching, where A generally denotes group 13 or group 14 elements in the periodic table. Additionally, bottom-up and chemical transformation techniques are used to produce MXenes.5 However, according to the current research trend, the first procedure dominates over the other methods due to its good feasibility, superior controllability, high yield and low cost. More than 70 kinds of MAX phases of ternary carbides and nitrides have been discovered, triggering the enlargement of the MXene family.12,16 Till now, over 30 types of MXenes have been experimentally synthesized and many more are theoretically predicted.17,18
The abundant stoichiometry and surface terminations of MXenes are associated with versatile and tuneable chemical and physical properties such as tailorable band gap, huge surface area, enhanced electrical and thermal conductivity, high capacity, noticeable hydrophilicity, decent compatibility with organic solvents, high elastic moduli, ability to intercalate ions, and very low optical attenuation.5,19–21
The general morphology of untreated MXene powder prepared through selective etching by acid shows 2D accordion-like multi-layered sheets.10 Due to the presence of dissimilar crystal structures, MXenes can be observed in various mesoscopic morphologies and dimensions by changing the preparation methods and post-treatment processes. Although the known morphology of MXenes is a 2D sheet, different dimensional structures of MXenes are prepared to enhance their efficiency for precise applications. For example, the ultrasonication of MXene colloidal solution for a long time can result in the synthesis of zero dimensional (0D) MXene quantum dots, while ultralight three dimensional (3D) MXene aerogels can be fabricated by an easy freeze-casting procedure.22–24 It is noticeable that the 3D porous MXene framework provides high specific surface area, which is favorable for energy storage, microwave absorption, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding applications.25–29 On the other hand, the 0D quantum dots have excitation-dependent photoluminescent behavior, enhanced chemical stability, and better biocompatibility, which make them a promising candidate for sensing, bio-imaging, and anticancer therapy.30–32 The one dimensional (1D) MXene (T3C2Tx) nanofibers are obtained from the selective acid etching of the MAX phase (T3AlC2) nanofibers through the hydrolization process in KOH solution.33 In a similar way, MXene nanoribbons can be obtained by treating MXene sheets in aqueous KOH solution.34 MXene nanofibers and nanoribbons have been used in energy and electrocatalyst applications. Moreover, in a recent work, MXene nanorods were prepared by chemical transformation through the carbothermal reaction at 1200–1300 °C.35 Homogeneous, few-layered thin MXene sheets without surface termination are prepared via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, which is favorable for the investigation of chemical and physical properties.36,37 Furthermore, Natu et al. reported that changing the pH of the MXene colloid solution by adding HCl, NaCl, or Na/K/Li-OH leads to the construction of highly porous crumbled MXene sheets.38 Such 2D MXene sheets have been predominantly used in energy storage applications.1,39–44
Similar to pure MXene, various MXene-based composites with graphene,45–48 melamine foam,49 SiC nanowire,50 carbon nanotube (CNT),51–53 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),54–56 nylon,57,58 polymer,59–61etc., also exhibit diverse morphology. It is noticeable that such MXene materials have gained more attention in energy storage and conversion,1,62–82 electronics,83 sensors,84,85 optical,86 catalysis,87–89 and biomedical applications.90–92 On the other hand, optoelectromagnetic characteristics of MXene and their applications have gained less attention; however, recently, an emerging number of applications in this field have been reported including 100% spin purity half metallic behavior, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism at high Curie temperature.36,93–95Fig. 2(a) displays the statistical data plot on the year-wise publication of MXene from 2011 to 2021 August and Fig. 2(b) shows the statistical idea on the area-wise publication of MXenes. Such profiles clearly indicate the emerging growth of Mxene materials over the years.
The current review article focuses on different dimensions of Mxenes including 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D (according to the morphology) (Fig. 1). Dimension-dependent synthetic procedure, basic physical and chemical properties, morphology-based characterizations, and applications are summarized. Lastly, few limitations and future aspects are also discussed. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no review article discussing the dimension-oriented classification of MXenes has been published to date.

2. Lattice structure and morphology of MXenes
The crystal lattice structure of MXenes obtained from selective acid etching generally consists of the hexagonal crystal lattice P63/mmc inherited from their MAX phase parent. The M atoms remain in hcp while the X atoms pack the interstitial octahedral sites. The packing arrangements of the MXene (Mn+1Xn) crystal lattice are MXM, MXM′XM, and MXM′X′M′XM, in which, n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and M, M′ as well as X, X′ designate various symmetry positions of transition metals and C or N.13,96 For the preparation of mono-M, ordered double-M, and solid solution-M element MXenes, the M and M positions may be filled by one or two different types of transition metals.4,12,97,98
However, in a wider aspect of MXenes, the crystal lattice structure of different MXenes can change according to the specific synthetic procedure. For example, transition metal nitrides prepared from their carbide precursors via ammoniation can show different lattice structures with fluctuating chemical transformation temperature and feature a trigonal V2N lattice.99 An orthorhombic lattice structure can be shown by an ultrathin α-Mo2C film synthesized through the CVD process.36 Fabricated by a salt template growth process, fMn3N2 shows square symmetry along the c-axis in the (001) plane, which is matched with its template fcc-KCl. However, along the b-axis in the (010) plane, a hexagonal symmetry has also been observed.100 With changing the lattice parameters, Fermi energies, transition metals, cohesive energies, and surface functionalization, phase transition occurred between the centered honeycomb (T) and honeycomb (H).101,102 The T and H lattice structures are differentiated by the atomic packing arrangements of the M atoms. The MXene Nb/Mo/W1.33C having ordered metal di-vacancies shows a hexagonal lattice symmetry, where various atomic lattice structures can co-exist.103–105 Recently, Zhang et al. observed that under high external pressure, c and a axes of MXene (Ti3C2) can be compressed, while under 26.7 GPa pressure, there is no phase transformation.106 Also, by changing the carbonization temperature, the lattice structure of MXene can be changed by annealing.107 Therefore, it can be concluded that the lattice structure of the MXenes can be tuned by changing the variables of their synthetic approaches.
3. Dimensionality of MXenes
Nanomaterials exhibit drastic changes in their chemical, physical, and electronic properties with varying dimensionality. In 2007, Pokropivny and Skorokhod classified the nanostructured materials in four categories including 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D based on their morphologies.108 This classification was mainly based on the movement of electrons along the dimensions of the nanomaterials, which generates the difference in the physical and chemical properties from traditional bulk materials. In case of 0D, electrons remain trapped in dimensionless structures, whereas in 1D nanomaterials, electrons can move only along the x-axis and in case of 2D and 3D nanomaterials, electrons can move along x, y and x, y, z axes, respectively.108,109
It has been observed that MXenes show different mesoscopic morphologies as the crystal lattice structure of MXenes changes with different preparation techniques and post-treatment. The most common morphology of raw MXene powder is multilayer, accordion-like sheet structure synthesized through selective acid etching.10 However, it has also been possible to obtain nanorod, nanoribbon, quantum dot, porous foam, and nanofiber-like morphologies of MXene with changing synthetic approaches.22,23,33–35
Many techniques have been reported to fabricate 0D to 3D MXenes with controlled size, shape, and dimensionality. The characteristic features of different dimensionalities of MXenes are represented herein, which have generally been prepared through versatile synthetic approaches to achieve attractive properties for diverse applications. The 0D MXene structures include MXene quantum dots and nanoparticles; 1D MXene structures include MXene nanoribbons and nanofibers; 2D MXenes are the most common sheet-like structures; and finally, 3D MXenes are the porous foams and hydrogels. Such dissimilar morphologies notably influence the chemical, physical, and electronic characteristics of MXenes and make them an interesting choice for precise applications such as energy storage and conversion, electrocatalyst, sensing, bioimaging, microwave absorption, and EMI shielding.25–27,30–34,110
3.1 Zero dimensional structures of MXenes
Only a few types of 0D MXene structures have been fabricated successfully, which include MXene quantum dots and MXene nanoparticles. Quantum dots of MXene are found to be more suitable for bioimaging, optics, and sensing applications due to their enhanced luminescence properties and ultra-small size, while MXene nanoparticles are used mainly in energy-related applications due to their improved electrical conductivity.22,30,111

3.1.1 Quantum dots. 
Versatile synthetic approaches have been explored for the development of efficient MXene quantum dots. In a recent study, a microexplosion method was introduced to successfully fabricate non-oxidized MXene (Ti3C2Tx) quantum dots, as shown in Fig. 3(a).30 The common accordion-like MXene sheets were used as the primary material to which liquid N2, followed by hot deionized water, was added and microexplosion process was carried out. Because of a huge temperature difference, the sheet-like microstructures were knocked down, resulting in the formation of quantum dots. Such a microexplosion approach enhanced the volume of the sample about 700 times than the accordion-like structure of MXene and its yield could reach up to ∼8%. The shape of quantum dots was regular disk-like and the average particle size (lateral) was 7.23 nm, as established by the transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images (Fig. 3(b)). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) also confirmed the disk-like structures of Ti3C2Tx quantum dots with ∼5 nm thickness of the disks, as represented in Fig. 3(c). In another report, a liquid ultrasonic method was used to prepare Ti2N quantum dots by breaking the Ti2N nanosheets via ice-bath sonication, followed by ultrasound tip sonication.112 TEM analysis revealed the effective synthesis of uniformly distributed quantum dots and provided the average lateral diameter of 4.83 ± 2.69 nm. Moreover, the AFM study also confirmed the morphology of Ti2N quantum dots with the average thickness of 1.81 ± 0.67 nm by a cross-sectional measurement. Further, Ti3C2Tx quantum dots with excess –OH groups were successfully synthesized by Jin et al. through alkalization and agitation process.113 In this work, Ti3C2Tx sheets were sheared in NaOH solution to intercalate Na+ ions between the MXene sheets and –OH groups could replace the surface –F functionalities. The successful synthesis of –OH rich Ti3C2Tx quantum dots was confirmed by TEM analysis, which display the uniformly distributed quantum dots with lateral particle size ranging between 2.4 and 3.2 nm (Fig. 3(d)). In addition, the AEM study (Fig. 3(e)) reveals the average thickness of the quantum dots in the range of 1.81 ± 0.05 nm.
In another study, the exfoliated MXene sheets were converted to quantum dots through chemical treatment at 130 °C for 6 h.114 Recently, Xue et al. synthesized Ti3C2 quantum dots from MXene sheets hydrothermally at three different temperatures (100 °C, 120 °C, and 150 °C). TEM analysis revealed the lateral size of 2.9 nm, 3.7 nm, and 6.2 nm, respectively, for these three types of quantum dot samples.32 In another study, Zeng et al. demonstrated the hydrothermal synthesis of functionalized Ti3C2 quantum dots from MXene sheets using polyethylenimine (PEI) for passivation.115 In a typical process, PEI-coated Ti3C2 sheets were heated at 120 °C for 5 h under N2 atmosphere. The obtained quantum dots were separated by dialysis, and their uniform size distribution and morphology were revealed by TEM and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) analysis. Notably, in another study, PEI was also used for passivation during the hydrothermal synthesis of Ti3C2 quantum dots following the previous procedure.116 Further, Lu et al. reported a two-step solvothermal process to synthesize Ti3C2 MXene quantum dots, where Ti3C2 nanosheets were used as the starting material with the surface passivation agent oleylamine.117 The successful synthesis of uniformly distributed Ti3C2 quantum dots with an average particle size of 13.1 nm was confirmed by TEM analysis. On the other hand, the AFM study revealed the average thickness of 1.362 nm, indicating that the quantum dots mostly include two layers.
Recently, Yu et al. reported the synthesis of fluorine-free Ti3C2 MXene quantum dots via bath sonication using MXene sheets as precursors.118 According to the statistical data obtained from AFM and TEM analysis of 100 quantum dots, the thickness and average lateral size were found to be 1.2 ± 0.3 nm and 4.9 ± 0.6 nm, respectively. AFM analysis revealed the topography of quantum dots with heights of 1.2 and 1.4 nm. Another study reported the growth of Nb2C quantum dots though physicochemical exfoliation using pulsed ultrasonication in tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH).31 The temperature of the reaction system was kept lower than the room temperature using an ice bath. The physical vibration of ultrasound combined with chemical interaction between Nb2C and TPAOH triggered the in-plane and perpendicular fragmentation of the MXene sheets. The corresponding AFM study revealed the formation of bilayer Nb2C quantum dots with the thickness of 1.2 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(f and g). Furthermore, the uniform particle distribution with a lateral size of 1–5 nm was verified by size distribution analysis and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM).

3.1.2 Nanoparticles. 
Apart from the quantum dots, MXene nanoparticles have also been synthesized through diverse synthetic approaches. For instance, Yu et al. prepared Ti3C2 nanoparticles through the ultrasonic cell pulverization of MXene sheets under N2 atmosphere for 7 h.111 After centrifugation, the precipitate was removed and the homogeneous supernatant was collected as a nanoparticle dispersion. The successful synthesis of Ti3C2 nanoparticles with an average diameter of ∼50 nm was confirmed by TEM analysis, as shown in Fig. 3(h). In another study, accordion-like Ti3C2 MXene dispersion in water was kept in a ultrasonic cell crusher noise isolation chamber for 18 h and after centrifugation, the light grey colored supernatant was collected as Ti3C2 nanoparticles.119 TEM analysis (Fig. 3(i)) confirmed the particle-like morphology of MXenes, where the average diameter of the nanoparticles was found to be about 30 nm. In another study, Yang et al. demonstrated the growth of Ti3C2Tx nanoparticle-nanosheet hybrid structure by changing the etchants (HF and tetramethylammonium hydroxide), etching time, and sonication time.120 The AFM study confirmed the irregular distribution of MXene nanoparticles over the sheets. However, the particle diameter as well as sheet thickness was varied with altering reaction conditions.

The formation of MXene quantum dots from the multilayered MXene sheets are guided by several methods including microexplosion, liquid ultrasonic method, bath sonication, pulsed ultrasonication, solvothermal treatment (at about 130 °C for 6 h), alkalization, and agitation. Quantum dots of various sizes ranging from 10 nm to 1.2 nm were reported. On the other hand, MXene nanoparticles were prepared by diverse synthetic approaches such as ultrasonic cell pulverization (under N2 atmosphere for 7 h), keeping it in an ultrasonic cell crusher noise isolating chamber (for 18 h). The average diameter of the obtained nanoparticles ranged between 50 nm and 30 nm. The versatile applications of these fabricated MXene quantum dots and nanoparticles are discussed below.


3.1.3 Applications. 
Due to quantum confinement, MXene quantum dots displayed excellent photoluminescence property. Moreover, they significantly have Fenton-like property as well as biocompatibility, which make them a potential candidate for cancer catalytic therapy (Fig. 4(a)).30 The 0D quantum dots have attracted notable research attention in the field of cancer phototheranostics, metal ion sensing, photothermal cancer therapy, multicolor cell imaging, immunomodulation, and regenerative medicine because of their excitation-dependent photoluminescent behavior, chemical stability, biodegradability, photothermal therapy efficiency, photoacoustic effect, and biocompatibility.31,32,112,114,117,118Fig. 4(d–f) shows the photoluminescence and ultraviolet analysis of Nb2C quantum dot solutions in the presence of different metal ions.31 On the other hand, Ti3C2Tx quantum dots rich with –OH functional groups were used as the electrocatalyst for the N2 reduction reaction. Such special type of MXene quantum dots offered excellent faradaic efficiency (13.30%) and high yield of NH3 production (62.94 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.50 V) due to size reduction and the addition of the functional group, as shown in Fig. 4(b and c).113 It has been observed that the MXene quantum dots coated over Cu2O nanowires enhanced the stability of the nanowires as well as improved photocatalytic efficiency by increasing light adsorption, charge transport, charge transfer, and carrier density as well as decreasing charge recombination and band bending edge.115Fig. 4(g) shows the methanol yield by the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using Ti3C2 quantum dots coated over Cu2O nanowires. On the other hand, Ti3C2 quantum dots boosted the photocatalytic H2 production capability of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by enhancing the specific surface area and density of the active sites (Fig. 4(n and o)).116 Moreover, the metallic property of MXene is associated with high electronic conductivity, which improved the carrier transfer efficiency of g-C3N4/Ti3C2 quantum dot composite. Fig. 4(k–m) shows the photothermal performance of MXene quantum dots for cancer therapy displaying time-dependent tumor growth, photothermal images, and temperature plot of HeLa tumor-containing mice.118

As compared to bare g-C3N4, the heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanoparticles decorated over g-C3N4 sheets improved the electrocatalytic activity, including a positive shift in the peak potential and onset potential toward the oxygen reduction reaction.111 The improvement in the electrocatalytic activity is associated with the high electrical conductivity of MXene nanoparticles and higher O2 adsorption due to the coupling effect between MXene and g-C3N4. In a recent report, Yang et al. proposed a strain sensor consisting of the Ti3C2Tx nanoparticle/nanosheet hybrid with excellent mechanical-electrical performance, showing large sensitivity (gauge factor >178.4) over 53% range, about 0.025% lower detection limit, and sufficient cyclic stability up to 5000 cycles.120 In another study, Yu et al. used Ti3C2 nanoparticle-modified with TiO2 as the photoanode with enhanced photoactivity and stability for photoelectrochemical water splitting performance (Fig. 4(h–j)).119 The synthetic methods, applications, and sizes of dissimilar zero-dimensional MXenes are summarized in Table 1.

3.2 One-dimensional structures of MXenes
Nanoribbon and nanofiber morphologies of MXene are mostly reported as the 1D structures, MXene nanotubes were predicted to theoretically have excellent thermal stability as well as unique physical and chemical properties.131,132 It has been identified that MXene nanoribbons are mainly used in the area of energy storage and conversion,34,133,134 while nanofibers of MXenes are applied in energy-related applications as well as nanogenerators, cell culture, and tissue engineering.33,135,136

3.2.1 Nanoribbons. 
The porous interconnected frameworks of Ti3C2 nanoribbons were easily fabricated from multi-layered MXene by shaking with KOH solution under Ar atmosphere.137 The interconnected structure of nanoribbons is evident from TEM analysis and the widths of the ribbons are in the range of 10–40 nm, as observed by HRTEM study (Fig. 5(a and b)). Similar method was followed by Dong et al. to prepare Ti3C2 nanoribbons from multi-layered MXene.134 On the other hand, Wei et al. also treated MXene nanosheets in 6 M KOH solution for 72 h in the presence of Ar to fabricate nanoribbons.138 TEM analysis clearly revealed the interconnected Ti3C2 nanoribbons and the corresponding HRTEM images displayed that the diameter of the ribbons was about 16 nm (Fig. 5(c and d)). A similar method was utilized to prepare Ti3C2 MXene nanoribbons by Lian et al.34 The morphology of MXene nanoribbons were examined by TEM, HRTEM, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). HRTEM analysis revealed the width distribution of about 6–22 nm and phase crystallinity of the nanoribbons (Fig. 5(e–g)). In another study, two different nanoribbons were fabricated from multi-layered Ti3C2 MXene by alkalization and oxidation, simultaneously using NaOH or KOH with H2O2.139 The solution mixtures were treated hydrothermally at 140 °C for 12 h to obtain sodium titanate (NaTi1.5O8.3) and potassium titanate (K2Ti4O9) nanoribbons. TEM and HRTEM analysis of NaOH-treated NaTi1.5O8.3 nanoribbons exhibited the thickness of 4–11 nm and width of 15–50 nm, while KOH-treated K2Ti4O9 nanoribbons exhibited the thickness of 3.5–11 nm and width of 28–60 nm. In addition, in this work, first principles calculation was utilized to scrutinize the stability, electron transport, electronic, magnetic, size, and edge-dependent characteristics of MXene nanoribbons.140–142

3.2.2 Nanofibers. 
MXene nanofiber composites were fabricated by dispersing MXene nanosheets in dichloromethane and dimethylformamide solution mixture through sonication for 2 h in ice bath using poly-L-lactide (PLLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA).136 The mixture was transferred into a syringe after stirring for 24 h, and electrospun at 0.6 mL h−1 under 15 kV to obtain the composite nanofiber. The smooth surface of the MXene nanofibers was demonstrated by SEM and TEM analysis with an average diameter of 850 nm and an average diameter distribution in the range of 600 nm to 1.5 μm. In this context, Mayerberger et al. fabricated four different types of Ti3C2Tx/polymer composite nanofibers using different polymers through electrospinning.60 In a typical process, four dissimilar polymers were mixed with MXene solution at 23 °C for 12 h by stirring and electrospinning at four different flow rates, applied voltage, and needle-collector distance. The morphology of non-woven MXene nanofibers with almost uniform diameters were observed by SEM analysis and the average diameter of the composites were found to be 762 ± 153 nm, 335 ± 70 nm, and 182 ± 47 for MXene/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), MXene/polyethylene glycol, and MXene/polyacrylic acid, respectively. In another study, Ti3C2 nanofibers were prepared by treating Ti3AlC2 in 6 M KOH solution and then the selective elimination of Al layer by HF etching (Fig. 5(h)).33 The thickness of Ti3C2 nanofibers was within the range of 40–60 nm, as observed by SEM analysis. Moreover, the clear image of the single nanofiber was revealed by TEM analysis having width of ∼50 nm (Fig. 5(i–k)). Recently, Bhatta et al. reported MXene/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite nanofiber via the facile electrospinning method at 2 mL h−1 flow rate over 18 kV applied voltage and the spinning height of 15 mm (Fig. 5(n)).135 TEM and FESEM analysis revealed the fiber-like morphology, where the average diameter of the fibers was within the range of 200 ± 120 nm with enhanced surface roughness (Fig. 5(l and m)). In another report, Shao et al. demonstrated the synthesis of delaminated polyester/MXene composite by electrospinning the solution mixture at 1 mL h−1 feed rate over ∼10 kV applied potential and 10 cm collector spinneret distance.143 The morphology of the composite nanofibers with non-uniform diameter was clearly revealed by SEM analysis (Fig. 5(o–r)).
The synthesis of MXene nanoribbons was directed by several methods such as shaking of multilayered MXene sheets with KOH solution (under Ar atmosphere), alkalization and oxidation of MXene sheets, simultaneously using NaOH or KOH with H2O2 at 140 °C for 12 h. Nanoribbons of various widths ranging from 40 nm to 3.5 nm were reported. On the other hand, MXene nanofibers were prepared by diverse synthetic approaches such as treating the MAX phase with KOH (6 M) for 96 h at room temperature, electrospinning different polymer solutions including PVA, PVDF, PLLA, and PEO at various flow rates ranging from 1–750 μL h−1. The average diameter of the obtained nanofibers ranged from 850 nm to 50 nm. The versatile applications of these fabricated MXene nanoribbons and nanofibers are discussed in the following section.


3.2.3 Applications. 
The interconnected framework of MXene nanoribbons was used as dendrite-free K metal anode due to its porous structure, high surface area, abundant K intercalation, increased interlayer distance, low local current density, and sufficient potassiophilic nucleation sites.137 MXene nanoribbon electrode provided 99.4% coulombic efficiency at 3 mA cm−2 current density with sufficient stability for 700 h at 10 mA h cm−2 plating capacity. Fig. 6(a–c) shows the electrochemical performance of alkalized Ti3C2 nanoribbon-based K-full batteries. In another report, Dong et al. utilized Ti3C2 nanoribbons as the host of S/polysulphides because of high surface area, open interconnected macropores, fast ionic diffusion, and enhanced S loading for facile lithiation-delithiation pathway.134 MXene nanoribbon-based Li–S battery electrode showed enhanced reversible capacity of 1062 mA h g−1 at 0.2C with high cyclic stability and sufficient rate capacity of 288 mA h g−1 at 10C (Fig. 6(d–h)). Wei et al. reported that by converting MXene nanosheets to nanoribbons, there was a significant increment in the N2 fixation efficiency because of the availability of exposed Ti–OH sites (Fig. 6(i)).138 Moreover, alkalized MXene nanoribbons having porous interconnected framework, fast ion diffusion, expanded interlayer spacing, and stable structure were used as anodes for highly efficient sodium/potassium ion batteries.34,139 In another study, MXene nanoribbons were theoretically explored as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using 12 types of MXene systems by first principles calculation.133

In a latest study, MXene nanofiber composites were used as efficient biomaterials for cell culture and tissue engineering due to their excellent hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, nanosize, availability of good microenvironment for cellular growth, and enhanced cellular activity.136 In another study, Yuan et al. introduced a highly effective MXene nanofibers electrocatalyst for HER (Fig. 6(j and k)).33 MXene nanofibers having large specific surface area and ample active sites provided sufficiently a small overpotential of 169 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density. On the other hand, MXene (Ti3C2Tx)/polymer composite nanofibers were utilized as an effective negative triboelectric layer to boost the triboelectric energy-generating efficiency.135 The nanogenerator was also proposed as a self-powered foot motion sensor, which can monitor step lights according to human foot motion over the stairs (Fig. 6(l)). Recently, Shao et al. demonstrated superior performance of MXene nanofibers-based yarn electrodes for wearable, flexible storage device due to their superior flexibility, enhanced electroactivity, high power density, and better mechanical strength.143Fig. 6(m–q) shows the electrochemical performance of the fabricated electrodes based on polyester/MXene nanofibers. Different preparation process, size, and application of one dimensional MXenes are summarized in Table 2.

3.3 Two-dimensional structures of MXenes
The well-known morphology of MXenes is accordion-like 2D sheets, which are generally synthesized via acid etching. Excellent electrical conductivity, high surface area, tuneable band gap, high Young modulus, and enhanced chemical stability make them attractive candidates for energy storage application as well as catalysis, sensing, EMI shielding, energy harvesting, actuators, and robotics.144–149

3.3.1 Sheets. 
Layered MXenes have been synthesized by the selective elimination of a specific atomic layer from their parent MAX phases. The 2D MXenes were first synthesized by Niguib et al. following the simple reactions (as mentioned below) by immersing Ti3AlC2 in HF.4Ti3AlC2 + 3HF = AlF3 + Ti3C2 + H2Ti3C2 + 2H2O = Ti3C2(OH)2 + H2Ti3C2 + 2HF = Ti3C2F2 + H2The morphology of multi-layered Ti3C2 was observed by SEM analysis, while TEM analysis revealed the single- or double-layered transparent sheets (Fig. 7(a–c)). As a milder and less harmful etchant than HF, LiF/HCl was used by Ghidiu et al. The synthetic approach resulted in the formation of larger flakes without nanosized defects, which were commonly observed in HF etching.150 In this method, a clay-like product was obtained, which could be rolled into freestanding films, and the overall shearing of the layers was shown by SEM analysis. Single layers of MXene having thickness ∼10 Å were observed in the TEM images (Fig. 7(d–f)).

In another synthetic strategy, an environment-friendly, less acidic, fluoride-containing ammonium salt NH4HF2 was used to synthesize MXene, in which harmful by-products were not produced.151 In addition, Feng et al. observed that the negative surface of Ti3C2Tx attracted the NH4+ ions to anchor onto the surface, leading to the enlargement of the c-lattice parameter of MXene accordingly.152 Moreover, Wang et al. hydrothermally fabricated MXene (Ti3C2) using NH4F by heating at 150 °C for 24 h.153 It was observed that the less acidic etchant needed more temperature for etching and with increasing etching time, the layer thickness decreased (Fig. 7(j)). The first 2D titanium nitride (Ti4N3) MXene was synthesized from Ti4AlN3 using a molten fluoride salt to eliminate the Al layer at 550 °C in the presence of Ar.154 The morphology of Ti4N3 MXene was observed by SEM and TEM analysis, which are shown in Fig. 7(g–i). Besides the MAX phases, another new type of layered precursor compound with the formula MnAl3C2 or Mn[Al(Si)]4C3 was reported by Zhou et al.155 The researchers successfully synthesized Hf3C2Tx and Zr3C2Tx by removing (AlC)x or [Al(Si)C]x units.
Usually, MXenes fabricated by the acid etching process have an accordion-like multi-layered structure and required further treatment to obtain the monolayer sheet.157 Mashtalir et al. delaminated multi-layered MXene by intercalation with hydrazine, N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), and urea, which resulted in an enhancement in the c-lattice parameter of multi-layered MXene (Fig. 7(k–n)).156 However, this method resulted in very low yield of single layer MXene due to the highly stable interlayer interactions of multi-layered Ti3C2Tx. Thus, to achieve a higher yield of single layer MXene sheets, mechanical milling in organic solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) and ion intercalation between the MXene layers were performed.158,159 Some of the synthetic procedures of two-dimensional MXenes with their application are summarized in Table 3.

The syntheses of multilayered and few- or single-layered MXene nanosheets from MAX phases are guided by several techniques such as etching with HF, LiF + HCl (varying the time and temperature), NH4HF2 (1 M), molten salt such as KF, NaF, LiF (at 550 °C for 0.5 h), and hydrothermally treated with NH4F. MXene nanosheets of various thickness ranging from 21 nm to 1 nm were reported. The wide range of applications of these fabricated MXene nanosheets are discussed in the following section.


3.3.2 Applications. 
As discussed earlier, 2D MXenes are extensively studied for energy-related applications mainly due to their superb electrical conductivity, large surface area, tuneable band gap, and cyclic stability. For example, additive-free MXene films exhibited a volumetric capacitance of 900 F cm−3 with enhanced cycle life (Fig. 8(a–c)).150 The 2D Ti3C2Tx was used as an efficient electrode for the supercapacitor, showing a volumetric capacitance of 141 F cm−3 in 3 M KOH with high rate capability.153 Superior electrochemical performance was obtained from V2CTx MXene as well with 317.8 F cm−3 volumetric capacitance and excellent cyclic life.144 The few-layer Ti3C2Tx was employed as the anode material for sodium ion batteries and exhibited fast electron transport, efficient sodium ion diffusion, high specific capacitance, excellent rate performance, and good cycle life (Fig. 8(d–g)).158 Moreover, a flexible free-standing film of the g-C3N4/Ti3C2 nanosheets showed high electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction due to their porous structure and hydrophilic surface.145 In another study, using first principles calculation, the Ti2CO2 monolayer was investigated as an NH3 gas sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity.146 Furthermore, the Ti3C2 nanosheets were investigated as promising microwave absorbers with over 92% absorption within the frequency window of 12.4–18 GHz due to their novel dielectric properties (Fig. 8(h and i)).147 Recently, Dong et al. demonstrated flexible and wearable Ti3C2Tx MXene triboelectric nanogenerator that harvested electrical power from human muscle motions such as texting, typing, clicking a mouse, and was capable to power up about 60 light emitting diodes or instantly charge a 1 μF capacitor up to 50 V (Fig. 8(l–q)).148 In another study, Nguyen et al. investigated few atom-thick layers of MXene-based electroionic soft actuators with elaborated actuation mechanism (Fig. 8(j and k)).149

3.4 Three-dimensional structures of MXenes
Among three dimensional MXenes, foam and aerogel/hydrogel structures are the most reported ones, which are successfully fabricated. In addition, nanoflower-like 3D architecture of MXene (Fig. 9(a–c)) was also fabricated by the rapid evaporation of MXene aerosol droplets through capillary force.169 Porous, lightweight, thin structure with freestanding properties made MXenes an ideal candidate for electromagnetic absorption, electrochemical actuators, shielding, and energy applications.25,45,49,170,171

3.4.1 Foams. 
Dendrite-free, 3D, interconnected, porous, flexible, conductive MXene-melamine foam was fabricated via a scalable strategy by soaking concentrated Mxene ink in commercial melamine foam (Fig. 9(k)).49 The MXene ink predominantly consisted of single layer nanosheets with ∼1.6 nm thickness, which was confirmed by AFM analysis and the freeze-dried lightweight foam changed its color from white (melamine foam) to black (MXene-melamine foam) after MXene soaking (Fig. 9(l–p)). The conductivity of the foam was found to be 25.5 Ω with a mass density of 24.5–54.3 mg cm−2. In another report, the ordered lamellar few-layered Ti3C2Tx/SiC nanowire foam was synthesized via a facile electrostatic self-assembly method by Li et al.50 In a typical process, few-layer Ti3C2Tx suspension was added dropwise into SiC nanowire/poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) suspension mixture under stirring in Ar atmosphere and the 3D foam was formed through a bidirectional ice-template freezing method. The microstructure morphology of the MXene hybrid foam was observed by SEM analysis, which revealed that the layer spacing of the two adjacent foam layers was about 80–100 μm with 1.0–1.5 μm thickness of a single layer. In another study, Li et al. synthesized hollow core–shell structured reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/Ti3C2Tx hybrid foam using polymethyl methacrylate spheres as the template.45 The hybrid foam exhibited ultralight weight with more than 99% porosity. The SEM as well as TEM analysis revealed the interconnected uniform hollow Ti3C2Tx spheres and the void space inside the microspheres can be clearly seen by the gap between the MXene-RGO sheets (Fig. 9(t–y)).
Liu et al. fabricated lightweight, freestanding, flexible, hydrophobic MXene foam through the hydrazine-induced foaming of MXene films obtained by assembling the MXene sheets.25 The SEM analysis of the foam clearly exhibits the analogous arranged MXene layers with numerous small pores between the layers. The MXene/graphene 3D foam having a density of 4.6 mg cm−3 was prepared by mixing Ti3C2Tx and graphene oxide (GO) dispersion, followed by freeze drying.172 In another report, Xu et al. reported a few-layer Ti3C2Tx/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hybrid foam synthesized via the freeze drying, process utilizing ice as a template (Fig. 9(d)).173 The SEM and TEM analyses show the stacked layers of MXene in the composite foam, which has a density of ∼10.9 mg cm−3 with ∼99.3% porosity (Fig. 9(e–j)). In this aspect, Ma et al. synthesized highly stable as well as compressible 3D Ti3C2Tx/GO foam by treating MXene and GO solution mixture solvothermally at 180 °C for 12 h.174 The porous morphology of the composite foam was observed by SEM analysis, which reveals the cellular structure having an average pore size of ∼10 μm. In another study, Zhao et al. reported a 3D flexible porous MXene foam using sulphur particles as the template.26 The porous architecture of 3D MXene foam was established by SEM analysis and it was observed that on increasing the sulphur template, the thickness of the foam increased with thinner pore walls.


3.4.2 Aerogels/hydrogels. 
MXene aerogel/hydrogels are new additions to the MXene family. Such types of aerogels/hydrogels are extensively synthesized nowadays for versatile applications. For example, Liu et al. displayed the synthesis of a porous 3D cobalt oxide nanoparticle-doped MXene/graphene hybrid aerogel through ultrasonic mixing, followed by freeze drying and calcinations under nitrogen atmosphere.170 The hierarchical porous structure of the hybrid aerogel was clearly evidenced by SEM and TEM analysis. Moreover, TEM analysis confirmed that cobalt oxide/MXene prevented the self-aggregation of graphene sheets to achieve the porous structure. In another report, MXene hydrogels were fabricated by heating the solution mixture of MXene, GO, and ethylenediamine at 95 °C for 6 h.175 In the next step, the hydrogels were washed and freeze-dried to obtain the porous architecture, which was observed by SEM analysis (Fig. 9(q–s)). Recently, Wang et al. illustrated the synthesis of 3D MXene hydrogels by blending MXene with polymers such as PVA, polyacrylamide (PAM) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) where MXene nanosheets could be applied as the crosslinking agent.176
The preparation of MXene foam from MXene nanosheets includes soaking the MXene ink in commercial melamine foam. Some other reported processes include electrostatic assembly of Mxene sheets with SiC nanowires (under Ar atmosphere), ice template freezing method, hydrazine-induced foaming of Mxene films, and solvothermally treating with GO solution (at 180 °C for 12 h) using sulphur particles as the template. The fabrication of the MXene aerogel/hydrogel is followed by various processes such as freeze drying and calcination under N2 atmosphere, blending with PVA, PAM, and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide). MXene nanoflower was fabricated by the rapid evaporation of MXene aerosol droplets through capillary force. The wide range of applications of these fabricated MXene foam and aerogels/hydrogels are discussed in the following section.


3.4.3 Applications. 
MXene-melamine foam was reported as the dendrite-free, elastic scaffold alkali anode with high areal capacity.49 The macroporous conductive 3D foam provided an areal capacity of 50 mA h cm−2 and enhanced current density of 50 mA cm−2 with a superior Coulombic efficiency of 99%. In another study, Zhao et al. developed 3D MXene foam with porous morphology, which exhibited enhanced lithium storage capacity of 455.5 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 with superb cyclic life and efficient rate performance (Fig. 10(a–d)).26 It is observed that 3D MXene (Ti3C2Tx) foam provided better lithium storage capacity than the 2D MXene (Ti3CNTx) sheet, which showed lithium storage capacity of 298 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 current density.167 This result can be attributed to the fact that the restacking and agglomeration of 2D nanosheets restrict their electrochemical performance, while porous 3D foam can overcome this limitation by utilizing the full potential of MXene. The lightweight, freestanding, 3D, porous, interconnected MXene foams were applied for superior electromagnetic absorption, which explored the effectively large absorption bandwidth over the whole X-band (Fig. 10(l–o)).27,45,50 The highly stable, lightweight, compressible, 3D, macroscopic MXene foams were also used to design highly efficient terahertz shielding material at smaller thickness.174,177 On the other hand, the 3D MXene foams having excellent flexibility, ultralight weight, and high porosity displayed enhanced EMI shielding performance, which made them promising candidates in the field of portable, wearable smart electronics, and aerospace (Fig. 10(p–u)).25,172,178 In addition, MXene aerogels having high specific surface area, porosity, and electrical conductivity were employed as the electrode material for supercapacitors, which delivered high specific capacitance of 345 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density with superior cyclic stability (Fig. 10(e–k)).170 Some of the synthetic procedures of three-dimensional MXenes with their applications are summarized in Table 4.

4. Conclusions and future prospects
Since the discovery of Ti3C2Tx in 2011, MXenes have become an eye-catching 2D material in modern nanotechnology platform, which has already gained revolutionary success in various technological fields. More than 30 types of MXenes have already been prepared experimentally and many more have been theoretically predicted. Their versatile but well-defined properties such as half-metallicity, tuneable band gap, excellent electrical conductivity, biocompatibility, stability, and hydrophilicity make them suitable for a wide range of applications. The blooming progress in post-processing and exfoliation of MXene after acid etching has promoted the fabrication of different structures and morphologies of MXene materials. It has been observed that with changing preparation techniques and post-treatment, the crystal lattice structure of MXene changes and they show different mesoscopic morphologies. Although the most common morphology of MXene is an accordion-like 2D sheet structure, quantum dot, nanorod, nanoribbon, foam, and nanofiber-like morphologies of MXenes have also been reported. Here, different techniques to fabricate MXenes from 0D to 3D have been explored with precise size, shape, and dimensionality. MXene structures with different morphologies are associated with different chemical and physical characteristics, and have attracted a huge scope of applications. This review emphasizes the classification of MXene's dimensional point of view according to their morphologies. Moreover, the progress of their synthetic protocol, characteristics, and corresponding applications have also been comprehensively surveyed.
0D quantum dots are more suitable for bioimaging, optics, and sensing applications due to their luminescence properties, while 1D MXene nanofibers and nanoribbons are mostly applied in nanogenerators, tissue engineering, energy storage, and conversion fields. On the other hand, 2D MXene sheets have been vastly investigated in energy applications as well as catalysis, sensing, and EMI shielding because of their high electrical conductivity and surface area, while 3D MXene foams having porous, lightweight, and freestanding properties are found to be ideal candidates for electromagnetic absorption, shielding, and energy applications. Within only 10 years, the MXene family has expanded a lot and is still growing day by day. However, for smooth growing, it has to overcome few limitations, which are mentioned below. Future research on this special class of materials should be dedicated to overcome these limitations.
1. Although numerous MXenes have been reported, there is a large difference between the theoretical prediction and experimental establishment. Only a small portion of theoretically-predicted MXenes has been prepared successfully to date. Contextually, various metal sources can be explored further in the future for MXene preparation. For example, “M” is mainly restricted to Ti, Mo, V, Nb, Hf, Ta, but there are sufficient other transition metals such as magnetic Fe, Co, Ni, or rare-earth luminescent Eu, Gd, Nd, Er, which can be used to obtain the required performance.
2. Transition metal nitrides have shown better activity in different application fields compared to their carbide siblings, yet the nitride members are still limited. Future research in this area should be highly appreciable.
3. MXenes with ordered double transition metals or solid solutions, which offer vast range of chemical composition and tuneable properties, still need systematic study on their controlled synthesis process.
4. All the experimentally fabricated MXenes have generally layered structures, while numerous other morphologies of MXenes with different dimensions still require significant attention. Among them, MXene quantum dots and foam have already started gaining attention, while, nanotube- and nanosphere-like structures are only predicted theoretically.
5. In terms of the synthetic strategies for MXenes, the harsh toxic acid etching process using hydrofluoric acid is very harmful toward the environment and requires greener synthetic pathways such as CVD and salt-templated growth process.
6. The fabrication pathway of single-layered MXene with a perfect structure is also challenging. Large-scale, non-terminated, uniform MXene synthesis is not impossible through aqueous acid etching and may be needed some physical fabrication methods such as mechanical exfoliation, molecular beam epitaxy, and CVD. Oxidation, ion intercalation, as well as post-processing and storage in MXenes still needed deeper understanding.
Despite such limitations, the dream run of MXenes is continuing in various fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology, although it has to go a long way to be commercialized.
