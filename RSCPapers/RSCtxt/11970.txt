    , Accepted 24th December 2014First published on 24th December 2014AbstractBy exploiting a facile and controllable anion exchange strategy, mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires with multinanocavities in surfaces have been successfully developed. The novel nanoscale morphology has been proven to be responsible for their excellent capacitive performances.
Over recent years, significant attention has been paid to develop clean and highly efficient electrochemical energy storage devices because of the ever-increasing energy demand and concerns about environmental issues.1 A supercapacitor as a promising electrochemical energy storage device has attracted much attention due to its long-term cycle stability and high power density.2 Based on the mechanisms of energy storage, supercapacitors can be divided into two categories: electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.3 Energy storage in EDLCs is built on the electrostatic adsorption of electrolyte ions on the surface of active materials.4 While pseudocapacitors store charge through faradaic processes, which involve surface or near-surface redox reactions.5 Generally, pseudocapacitors have higher capacitance than EDLCs owing to their fast redox reaction.6 The performance of pseudocapacitors largely depends on the electrode materials.7 The electrode materials with homogeneous porosity and high electrical conductivity are beneficial for energy storage since these properties are strongly related to the surface or near-surface redox reactions.8 Among various electrode materials, Ni(OH)2 is an attractive candidate electrode material for supercapacitors due to its layered structure, low cost, high theoretical specific capacitance, and well-defined electrochemical redox activity.9 Ni(OH)2 has two polymorphs, which are denoted as α-Ni(OH)2 and β-Ni(OH)2.10 The β-Ni(OH)2 is isostructural with brucite-like structure, while the α-Ni(OH)2 has hydrotalcite-like structure,11 and the formula can be expressed as Ni(OH)2−x(An−)x/n·yH2O, where x = 0.2–0.4, y = 0.6–1, and A = SO42−, NO3−, CO32−, Cl−, or other anions.12 In general, α-Ni(OH)2 can deliver larger electrochemical capacity than β-Ni(OH)2.9,13 Many strategies including hydrothermal or solvothermal methods,13,14 electrodeposition methods,15 precipitation methods,16 and anion exchange methods17 have been explored for the synthesis of α-Ni(OH)2 nanostructures for supercapacitors, where the building blocks of α-Ni(OH)2 nanostructures are normally nanowires or nanosheets with diameter tens of nanometers. As pseudocapacitors store charge in the first few nanometers from the surface,18 there is still room for improvement in the usage of bulk materials to increase supercapacitor performances. Elegant nanoscale morphology control over α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires to create nanocavities will be a desirable solution, which is believed to improve the interface contact efficiency between active sites and electrolytes, to serve as reservoirs for electrolyte ions to facilitate ions and electrons transport, and to provide spaces for volume expansion during the cycling process, but very challenging.
Herein, we report a facile and controllable anion exchange strategy to α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires with multinanocavities in each nanowire surface based on the reaction between SO42− anions in α-Ni(OH)2 and S2− anions. The unique mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires with multinanocavities demonstrate obvious advantages as follows: (1) the large interlayer spacing of α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires enable high mobility of the interlayer ions during the charge–discharge process; (2) 1D α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires can facilitate the electron transport along the long dimensions; (3) the nanocavities can improve the interface contact efficiency between the active material and electrolyte, and enhance kinetics due to the relatively short diffusion paths for electrons and ions.19 (4) Numerous nanocavities in α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires can provide spaces for volume expansion during the continuous charge–discharge processes. As a consequence, the introduction of nanocavities for α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires is expected to lead to obviously improved electrochemical performances.
Anion exchange reaction has been proven an effective and environmentally friendly route to produce various sulfur-based nanomaterials,20 where the phase and crystal structures of pristine materials are often changed after anion exchange reaction. Adapting the concept, it is believed that if SO42− anions in α-Ni(OH)2 are replaced by S2− anions which is a thermodynamically favorable process, the primary 1D structure and the crystal phase of α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires can be retained, whereas voids in surfaces of nanowires can be formed due the obvious spatial volume difference of exchanged anions. The formation mechanism of mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires is depicted in Fig. 1a. In general, the solubility product constant (Ksp) of metal sulfide is lower than the corresponding hydroxide. As a result, the latter is prone to conversion into the former under the specific conditions. In our experiments, mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires with multinanocavities were prepared by partial SO42− anions exchanged with S2− anions and the reaction can be expressed as follows: Ni(OH)2−x(SO4)0.5x + zS2− → Ni(OH)2−x(SO4)0.5x−zSz + zSO42−(1)
After anion exchange reactions, numerous “nanocavities” were produced because the spatial volume of the SO42− anion is larger than that of the S2− anion. Therefore, nanocavities are produced, resulting in the formation of mesoporous structure. As shown in the high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image (Fig. 1b), we can clearly observe that there are numerous nanocavities with the diameter ranging from 4 to 6 nm in the surfaces of α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1c) further confirms the existence of nanocavities. The lattice spacing of 0.21 nm corresponds to the (304) lattice planes of α-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS No. 41-1424). From the typical atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of an individual mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowire on a mica surface (Fig. 1d), it can be clearly observed that the surface of α-Ni(OH)2 nanowire is rough and uneven, suggesting that there are numerous nanocavities. The average depth of pores as measured from the height profile of the AFM image is about 1.0 nm. In addition, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1e) shows a set of concentric circles, which reveals that mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires are polycrystalline in nature. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) elemental maps shown in Fig. 1f–h clearly revealed that the elements of Ni, O, and S are distributed homogeneously in mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires.

The Na2S concentration was found to play the determining role in the formation of nanocavities in α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires. Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†) represent STEM and TEM images of morphological features of pristine α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires (denoted as S0) and α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires obtained at different Na2S concentration (denoted as S1 to S5 with Na2S concentration increased from 0.01 to 0.4 mol L−1, for details see ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1a (ESI†), the surface of pristine α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires is smooth with no obvious pores. Interestingly, numerous nanopores can be clearly observed in surfaces of α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires, and obvious increase in pore density and diameter from Fig. 2b to d with increasing Na2S concentration can be observed.

The phase and composition of samples are then examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as presented in Fig. 3a and Fig. S2 (ESI†). All the diffraction peaks in diffractogram S0 are in good agreement with the standard card JCPDS No. 41-1424, which could be perfectly indexed to the monoclinic phase α-Ni(OH)2. After anion exchange reaction with S2−, there is no noticeable shift of diffraction peaks from S1 to S5. However, the color of samples changed from blue green to gray black. In addition, a small amount of Na2SO4·10H2O possibly absorbed in pores of mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires has also been detected (Fig. S2, ESI†). On the basis of the above results, we speculate that SO42− anions in α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires could be replaced by S2− anions.

In order to verify S2− anions entrance into the α-Ni(OH)2 crystal lattice, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the composition and chemical states of Ni, O, and S in α-Ni(OH)2 samples, and the results are revealed in Fig. 3b and Fig. S3 (ESI†). Each Ni 2p spectrum in Fig. S3a (ESI†) consists of two spin–orbit doublet characteristics of Ni(I) and Ni(III) and two shakeup satellites.21 Two major peaks centered at 873.9 and 856.2 eV correspond to Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2, respectively. The spin-energy separation of 17.6 eV is the characteristic of α-Ni(OH)2 and in good agreement with the previous literature.22 The O 1s spectrum can be fitted into three oxygen contributions (Fig. S3b, ESI†), which are assigned to O2−, OH−, and adsorbed water, respectively. Compared to pristine α-Ni(OH)2, an additional peak can be found in S 2p spectra with the increase of Na2S concentration (Fig. 3b). The peaks located at around 169.1 and 163.3 eV can be ascribed to SO42− and S2−, respectively. Moreover, the S2− content in α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires obtained from fitting XPS spectra gradually increases with Na2S concentration. In contrast, S(VI) content decreases with Na2S concentration, as depicted in Fig. 3c. The above results indicate that S2− anions enter into the α-Ni(OH)2 crystal lattice and SO42− in α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires are partially replaced.
In order to further get the information on porosity, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and specific surface areas are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms show a type IV isotherm with a small hysteresis loop. A small step of nitrogen adsorption and desorption branching occurs, indicating the existence of mesopores in as-prepared α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires. The pore diameter distribution data are obtained from density functional theory (DFT) and the results are provided in Fig. 3d. The surface area decreases and the pore diameter increases with increasing S2− content in α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires. The enlargement of the pore diameter was possibly caused by the S2− etch to the α-Ni(OH)2 nanowire. As is well-known, the extension of the mesopore's diameter usually leads to the decrease of the specific surface area.23
The nanocavities in α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires can provide more electroactive sites and efficient transport pathways for electrolyte penetration into the interior of α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires,24 which could facilitate fast ion and charge transport and result in the excellent electrochemical properties of the electrode materials for supercapacitors.25 Therefore, mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires are expected to show better electrochemical performances.
The electrochemical performances of mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires as electrode materials for supercapacitors were evaluated by galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). GCD curves of α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires with various S2− contents at a current density of 1 A g−1 are presented in Fig. 4a. The plateaus in GCD curves indicate the existence of Faradaic processes and the results show that the discharge time increases with S2− content. The specific capacitances calculated from the discharge curves in Fig. S5 (ESI†) is plotted in Fig. 4b, which gradually decrease with the increase of current densities. It might be caused by the resistance of α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires and the insufficient Faradic redox reaction under the high discharge current densities.26 At a current density of 1 A g−1, the specific capacitance is 2223 F g−1 for S4, much higher than that (376 F g−1) for S0. What is more, at a high density of 10 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the S4 electrode remains at 1621 F g−1, 73% of that at 1 A g−1, suggesting the excellent rate capability of mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowire electrodes. Each CV curve in Fig. S6 (ESI†) consists of a pair of strong redox peaks, not an ideal rectangular shape, indicating that the capacitance characteristic is mainly governed by Faradaic redox reaction. It should also be noted that the oxidation peak shifts in the positive direction and that the reduction peak shifts in the negative direction with the increase of the scan rate, which is mainly due to the limitation of the ion diffusion rate to satisfy electronic neutralization during the redox reaction and the internal resistance of the electrode.27 In addition, the symmetry of CV curves is distorted at a high scan rate, which could be attributed to the kinetic irreversibility of the redox process.28 The specific capacitances at various scan rates are plotted in Fig. 4c. It can be found that mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires show higher specific capacitance than pristine α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires. Among these, S4 exhibits the highest specific capacitance (1624 F g−1) at 2 mV s−1. In addition, the specific capacitance decreased gradually with the increasing scan rate. At low scan rates, the active materials have a higher utilization than that at high scan rates. Though the specific capacitances decrease with the increasing scan rates, a high value can still be obtained at 40 mV s−1 for mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires. For example, 536 F g−1 for S4 is reached, whereas a lower value of 162 F g−1 for pristine α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires is obtained.

The outstanding electrochemical performance should be derived from their unique porous structure. According to Fig. 3d, the increase of S2− content caused two kinds of changes. On one side, the average pore diameter increases which can promote the diffusion of electrolytes. On the other side, as Fig. 3a shows, the crystallinity of α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires became worse from S0 to S4. It was reported that some metal oxides or hydroxides have a better reactivity when they have a low crystalline structure.29 The pseudocapacitance formed by the redox Ni(OH)2 reaction should be improved. Based on the above reasons, the increase of the S2− content has a positive effect to enlarge the capacity of the materials. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were presented as Nyquist plots (Fig. S7, ESI†), in which the real axis intercepts (ohmic resistance) are 0.95 Ω for α-Ni(OH)2 and 1.11 Ω for mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2. This is reasonable because the discontinuous porous structure will lead to decreased electrical conductivity. From the results of N2 adsorption–desorption and STEM images, we can know that mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires possess multinanocavities ranging in size from 4 to 6 nm, which will significantly increase the amount of electroactive sites, thus facilitating the transport of OH− ions. Moreover, the nanocavities also serve as ions “reservoirs”, reducing the diffusion distance of ions and electrons. As the decrease in the electrical conductivity of mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires is small, the significant increase in electrochemical performances as supercapacitor electrode materials should be ascribed to their unique nanostructures.
Cycle performances of mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires at different current densities were investigated and the results for the S3 electrode are shown in Fig. 4d. Mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires show a good cycle life at the current density of 2, 4, 6, and 10 A g−1 after 1000 cycles, which may be caused by the presence of nanocavities that can effectively relieve the volume expansion during continuous cycles. The capacity retention decreases with the increase of current density, which may be caused by the resistance of mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires and the insufficient Faradic redox reaction under the high discharge current densities. The Coulombic efficiency for mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires approaches 100% at different current densities (Fig. S8, ESI†).
In conclusion, a facile and controllable anion exchange strategy has been successfully applied to synthesize mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires with multinanocavities in surfaces. The pore size can be easily controlled by adjusting Na2S concentration. When used as electrode material for the supercapacitor, mesoporous α-Ni(OH)2 nanowires exhibited superior performances, which are attributed to their suitable nanocavities improving the interface contact efficiency, serving as reservoirs to facilitate ion and electron transport, and providing spaces for volume expansion during the cycling process. We believe the strategy developed here is instructive for construction of other mesoporous materials for broader applications such as catalysts for water splitting, active layers for hybrid solar cells, and electrode materials for lithium ion batteries.
