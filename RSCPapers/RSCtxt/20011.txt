    , Accepted 24th June 2021First published on 14th July 2021AbstractRecently, lead-free double perovskites of Cs2AgBiBr6 have attracted worldwide attention as a promising candidate for eco-friendly photovoltaics because of their intrinsic environmental stability and highly desired low toxicity in comparison with conventional lead halide counterparts. However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is still far lower than that of lead halide perovskites, which is mainly associated with their poor quality films. Herein, we report a facile process via precursor engineering based on the BiBr3(DMSO)2 adduct solution to produce high-coverage and smooth Cs2AgBiBr6 films with large grains. As a result, the as-constructed planar solar cells deliver a champion PCE of 0.73%, which exhibits an enhancement of over 40% in PCE compared to that of the control sample, suggesting their potential to be applied in lead-free bismuth-based optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted worldwide attention, not only in research areas but also in industrial applications due to their merits of high efficiency and low cost. Their PCE has increased markedly from 3.8% in 20191–3 to 25.5% nowadays, which is on a par with that of commercialized crystalline silicon and thin-film solar cells. For the potential large-scale application of PSCs in the future, however, there are two serious issues to be addressed: the volatility of organic cations and the toxicity from the heavy metal element lead.4–9 For the first of these, great improvements have been made on the stability of materials and devices by replacing the volatile organic cations with inorganic cations (such as Cs+ and Rb+) to form an inorganic perovskite.10,11 As to the toxicity issue, partial substitution or the replacement of lead with environmentally benign elements12–16 have been proposed, which are sure to be the most straightforward strategies to substantially relieve health concerns and environmental problems. Among them, Sn and Ge, as elements in the same group of the periodic table, are expected to exhibit similar physical and chemical properties to achieve a comparable performance to that of lead-halide perovskite devices. In fact, the performance of Sn- and Ge-based perovskite solar cells are still far inferior to that of lead-halide perovskite devices, and both are prone to be oxidized to tetravalent states under ambient conditions, which will lead to a serious deterioration in the performance of the devices.17–19
In this regard, double perovskites with the formula of Cs2M(I)M(III)X6,20 in which monovalent (M(I)) and trivalent (M(III)) nontoxic ions are used to replace divalent Pb ions in cubic perovskites to constitute the center of spatially staggered octahedral corner-sharing with halide X, have recently emerged as a promising alternative to lead halide hybrid perovskites owing to their low toxicity and environmental stability. As a representative double perovskite, Cs2AgBiBr6 has been widely investigated as a lead-free perovskite since Slavney et al. demonstrated a solution-processed single-crystal Cs2AgBiBr6 with noteworthy potential photovoltaic properties.21 Several groups have demonstrated the theoretical and experimental results of high optical coefficient and long carrier lifetime of Cs2AgBiBr6, particularly its high stability under operational conditions, as an encouraging candidate for optoelectronic applications with high performance.22–28 However, the highest PCE of Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells is only 2.84% so far,29 which is far below the level of lead-halide perovskite devices. Such a low performance of these devices is probably associated with the poor quality of the resulting Cs2AgBiBr6 films.23,30
Various methodologies, such as interfacial engineering,31 compositional engineering,6 dimensional reduction,32 low-pressure-assisted methods,33–36 solution processing,6 sequential vapor deposition20 and so on, have been proposed to address this issue, and accordingly, great improvements in the quality of films have been achieved; however, the preparation of high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 films with large grains remains highly challenging and desirable. The Lewis base dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been successfully introduced in low-cost solution process to form intermediate DMSO adducts, which retards the rapid crystallization of halide perovskite films and demonstrates a substantial improvement in the quality of the films and the performance of lead-halide perovskite devices.37–42 Although the synthesis and systematic investigation on the physical and chemical properties of DMSO complexes of bismuth(III) halide have been reported for over forty years,43 it has not been investigated for Cs2AgBiBr6 films and devices.
Herein, we investigate, for the first time, the influence of a BiBr3(DMSO)2 adduct on the quality of Cs2AgBiBr6 films and devices. The BiBr3(DMSO)2 complex powder is synthesized by solvent extraction from BiBr3(DMSO)3 powder that is obtained from a BiBr3-containing DMSO solution, and is subsequently used to produce high-coverage and smooth Cs2AgBiBr6 films with large grains. Using the resulting high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 film as an absorber layer, we attain a PCE of 0.73% in a planar heterojunction structure of ITO/SnO2/Cs2AgBiBr6/Spiro/Ag under the illumination of simulated AM 1.5G sunlight. Compared with a Cs2AgBiBr6 film prepared using a conventional method, the device shows a decent improvement, not only in the open-circuit voltage but also in the fill factor, which leads to an enhancement of over 40% for the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices, suggesting that the current BiBr3(DMSO)2 adduct method is a promising avenue for high-quality films and efficient optoelectronic devices of Cs2AgBiBr6 and other bismuth-based perovskites.
2. Experimental section
Materials
CsBr (≥99.9%), (N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, ≥99.8%) and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)tris(bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (≥99, FK 209 Co(III) TFSI salt) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. AgBr (99%), DMSO (≥99.9%), acetonitrile (anhydrous, 99.8%), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) and bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. BiBr3 (99%) and 15% SnO2 colloid precursor were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All the materials were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of BiBr3(DMSO)3 and BiBr3(DMSO)2 powders
BiBr3(DMSO)3 powder was prepared via an antisolvent route from BiBr3-containing DMSO solution. The typical process is as follows: 1 mmol of BiBr3 powder was dissolved in 1.5 mL of DMSO with constant stirring for 2 h. 50 mL of ethanol was then added drop by drop to this solution and the resulting white precipitate was collected by centrifugation. Subsequently, the white precipitate was washed with diethyl ether three times, and then BiBr3(DMSO)3 powder was obtained by vacuum drying at room temperature. Finally, BiBr3(DMSO)2 powder was synthesized by evaporating a sufficient amount of DMSO solvent from BiBr3(DMSO)3 at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
Preparation of Cs2AgBiBr6 precursor solution
The Cs2AgBiBr6 precursor solution (0.5 M) was prepared by mixing CsBr, AgBr and BiBr3(DMSO)2 with a molar ratio of 2:1:1 in DMSO solvent with stirring for 2 h. The corresponding conventional Cs2AgBiBr6 precursor solution without the DMSO adduct was prepared using the same procedure except for replacing the BiBr3(DMSO)2 powder with a pristine BiBr3 powder.
Fabrication of Cs2AgBiBr6 devices
ITO glasses were successively cleaned ultrasonically with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 15 min. After 10 min of treatment with oxygen plasma, a layer of compact SnO2 was spin-coated on the resulting substrates at 3000 rpm for 40 s using a SnO2 precursor solution that was obtained by dispersing a commercially available SnO2 nanocrystalline colloid solution in deionized water (in a volume ratio of 1:4). Followed by annealing for 30 min at 150 °C on a hot plate, 0.5 M Cs2AgBiBr6 precursor solutions with or without DMSO adducts were spin-coated onto the SnO2-coated substrates at 3000 rpm. The as-prepared Cs2AgBiBr6 films were annealed at various temperatures (typically at 150, 200, 250 and 300 °C) for different times (typically for 5, 10 and 15 min) to crystallize. Afterwards, a pre-dissolved Spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution, in which 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD powder, 29 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 28.5 μL of Li–TFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 17.5 μL of FK209 Co(III) TFSI salt (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) were mixed in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, was spin-coated onto the Cs2AgBiBr6 at a speed of 5000 rpm. Finally, the device was completed by evaporating the Ag electrode (100 nm) through a shadow mask at a speed of 0.1 nm s−1.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was measured using FE scanning electron microscopy (S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), and the corresponding elemental distribution was obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The infrared spectra of the samples were recorded using a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Bruker-VERTEX 70). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the complex powders under a nitrogen atmosphere was carried out using a differential scanning calorimeter (PerkinElmer, Diamond, America). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed by using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffraction meter with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). UV–Vis absorption spectra were measured using a U-3900 spectrophotometer. X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) was performed using an ES-CALAB 250Xi instrument with monochromatic Al Kα (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Steady-state PL was measured using a FluoroMax-4P spectrometer. Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer in confocal mode. The J–V curves of solar cells were measured under the illumination of AM 1.5 simulated sunlight of 100 mW cm−2 using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter.
3. Results and discussion
To investigate the impact of Lewis base adducts on BiBr3, the microstructures of BiBr3(DMSO)3 and BiBr3(DMSO)2 as well as the commercial pristine powder of BiBr3 were characterized. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of BiBr3, BiBr3(DMSO)2 and BiBr3(DMSO)3 powders are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1c and f, BiBr3(DMSO)3, which comes from pristine BiBr3 by recrystallizing it in a BiBr3-containing DMSO solution using an antisolvent route, has a similar crystal size to that of pristine BiBr3 (Fig. 1a and d), but the boundary of the particles is comparatively well-defined, which implies a well-crystallized resulting sample compared with the pristine sample. In contrast to the microstructure, the BiBr3(DMSO)2 and BiBr3 samples show different forms in their macroscopic nature: the former exhibits a white color (inset in Fig. 1c) while the latter is a faint yellow (inset in Fig. 1a). This white powder was then transformed to another DMSO adduct, creamy yellow BiBr3(DMSO)2 (inset in Fig. 1b), by annealing at a certain temperature in a vacuum oven. The particles of the resulting BiBr3(DMSO)2 are found to be highly crystalline and diamond in shape (Fig. 1b and e). The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the diamond crystal (Fig. 1e) is shown in Fig. 1g and the distributions of Bi, Br and S are shown in the left, middle and right of Fig. 1g, respectively. It can be clearly seen that these elements are uniformly distributed in the crystal, which implies that the obtained BiBr3(DMSO)2 adduct may be a compound rather than a mixture of BiBr3 and DMSO.

To confirm the origin of element S in the DMSO adducts, the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectra of BiBr3(DMSO)2, BiBr3(DMSO)3 and BiBr3 powders were examined. The Raman spectra of BiBr3, BiBr3(DMSO)3 and BiBr3(DMSO)2 are shown in Fig. 2a–c, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2a, six Raman bands, for the high-frequency peak of the symmetric stretching (A′) mode lying at 190.3 and 103.9 cm−1 and two components (A′ and A′′) of the asymmetric stretching mode at 181.4, 165.9, 94.1 and 80.7 cm−1, are observed, indicating that the symmetry of the BiBr3 molecule is lowered to Cs rather than being C3v pyramidal.44,45 For BiBr3(DMSO)3 and BiBr3(DMSO)2 molecules, similar bands to that for the BiBr3 compound are found in the Bi–Br stretching region below 200 cm−1, whereas an additional band near 400 cm−1 and two bands between 300 and 350 cm−1 appeared in both complexes, as shown in Fig. 2b and c, which are ascribed to vibrational modes involving the Bi–O stretching and C–S–O deformation, respectively.43 This Bi–O stretching band found in BiBr3(DMSO)2 and BiBr3(DMSO)3 indicates oxygen-bound DMSO in both cases rather than uncoordinated DMSO which is confirmed in the Fourier transform infrared spectra (Fig. 2d) of pristine BiBr3 for the absence band at 1023 cm−1 due to an equal contribution from S–O stretching and CH3 rocking.46 Compared with BiBr3(DMSO)2, BiBr3(DMSO)3 exhibits a much broader infrared spectrum between 900 and 1050 cm−1 and a doublet at the C–S stretching frequency at 700 cm−1, which agrees well with the results of Oertel's investigation.43 Furthermore, obvious differences for each sample can be found in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which monitors the remains of the samples decomposed in an inert atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 2e, BiBr3(DMSO)3 is the first to begin to decompose and BiBr3 is the last with increasing temperature, at about 100 °C and 235 °C, respectively. Similar to PbI2(DMSO),39,40 the decomposition temperature of BiBr3(DMSO)2 is higher than that of BiBr3(DMSO)3, and about 7.5% in weight of both samples remains when the decomposition process has finished, which might be oxides due to the reaction between the metal and oxygen in DMSO adducts.

To prepare the Cs2AgBiBr6 precursor solution, BiBr3(DMSO)2, which was synthesized by vacuum drying and solvent extraction in recrystallized BiBr3(DMSO)3via an antisolvent route, AgBr and CsBr powders were dissolved in DMSO solvent with constant stirring at a certain temperature as illustrated schematically in Fig. 3a. Spin-coating this precursor solution on an ITO substrate and after high-temperature annealing immediately, a crystallized Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite film is produced and corresponding XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 3b (red lines). Three main peaks at 15.7°, 22.3°, and 31.8° which are representative facets of the (200), (220) and (400) planes, along with the facets of (222), (420), (422) and (440), can be indexed to the cubic Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite structure6,47,48 with the Fm3m space group, for which the schematic drawing is shown in Fig. 3c. This cubic Cs2AgBiBr6 phase is further confirmed by the Raman spectra as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), which present predominately F2g at 73.6 cm−1 and A1g at 177.3 cm−1.49

To probe the impact of the BiBr3(DMSO)2 adduct on the Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite films, characterization of the surface morphologies and optical properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 samples with the DMSO adduct were performed. As a comparison, Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite films prepared via the conventional route in which BiBr3 was used as a source material instead of BiBr3(DMSO)2 were also prepared as a control sample. To obtain high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite films, the annealing process of the films with DMSO adducts was optimized by monitoring the morphologies and crystal structures while the same annealing process has been used as reported elsewhere6,23 for the control sample. It should be noted that all these samples were annealed on a hotplate for 10 min to maintain the consistency of the experiment. Top-view SEM images of the obtained DMSO-derived Cs2AgBiBr6 films at different temperatures (Fig. S2, ESI†) show that the average grain size of the films gradually increases from ∼50 nm to above 400 nm as the temperatures increases from 150 °C to 300 °C while the pin-holes of the films decrease first and then increase. A similar trend for the films is found in the XRD patterns. As shown in Fig. S2e (ESI†), no big difference is observed in the diffraction angles of each sample and all XRD patterns can be indexed to the cubic Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite except that some of them stem from the ITO/SnO2 substrates. Interestingly, the intensity of the diffraction peaks at 15.7° and 31.8°, characteristic facets of (200) and (400) of cubic Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskites, respectively, increases significantly with increasing temperature, implying that the higher the temperature, the better the crystallinity. Allowing for both morphology and crystallinity, 250 °C is chosen to be the optimized annealing temperature, and at this temperature the annealing time from 5 min to 20 min was also investigated by probing the XRD patterns of these films. As shown in Fig. S2f (ESI†), the relative intensity of the diffraction planes of (400) increases gradually as the annealing process extends, and the optimized annealing time of 10 min is proposed because the additional diffraction peak at 12.7° is detected in the XRD patterns for 20 min annealing samples, which probably stems from the decomposition of cubic Cs2AgBiBr6 to the common secondary impurity phase of Cs3Bi2Br9.23,50 Accordingly, annealing the samples at 250 °C for 10 min was chosen as the optimized process to obtain Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskites. Fig. 4a and b show the top-view SEM images of the control and the target samples obtained using the optimized process. The control sample exhibits lots of pin-holes and small crystals with an average size of 280 nm, while the Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite film with the DMSO adduct presents a dense and smooth surface with large grains and without pin-holes (Fig. 4b). This result implies that the BiBr3(DMSO)2 adducts not only retard the rapid crystallization process but also are helpful to obtain large crystals.40 The degree of crystallinity of the films is supposed to correlate to the intensity of the Raman peaks6,51–53 and, thus, the Raman spectra of both samples are characterized as shown in Fig. 4c. The Raman spectra of both samples present two strong peaks at around 177.7 cm−1 and 70.9 cm−1, which are the A1g longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode belonging to the symmetric stretching of Bi and Br in the octahedron, and the T2g mode related to the motions of Cs and Br, respectively,6,54,55 while relative intensities of the peaks of the DMSO adduct derived sample are higher than that of the control sample without adducts. Fig. 4d shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of both samples. As shown in Fig. 4d, broad peaks are observed for both samples, which might be ascribed to the indirect band gap nature and defects from non-radiative recombination.21,22 The quenching intensity of the PL emission of Cs2AgBiBr6 films prepared with DMSO adducts is significantly smaller than that of the control sample, indicating enhanced charge extraction from the perovskite film to the electron-transport material. The PL emission peak of the control sample is located at 540 nm while the DMSO adducts derived sample is at 532.8 nm. (2.3 eV). The small blue shift of the PL signal suggests a lower trap density in the DMSO-derived sample with the current strategy. The discrepancy between this central PL peak and the absorbing edge extracted from UV–vis absorption spectra (Fig. 7c, which will be discussed later) might be ascribed to indirect band gap nature.56

Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite films with and without DMSO adducts were carefully scraped from the ITO substrates for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) characterization. The Cs2AgBiBr6 film without DMSO adducts exhibits a slightly smaller grain (TEM image in Fig. 5a) than that of the DMSO-adduct-induced Cs2AgBiBr6 film (Fig. 5d); in addition, it shows lots of voids between the crystals in contrast to the latter, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 4a and b. Diffraction rings in the corresponding representative SAED patterns (Fig. 5b) of the control sample can be indexed to cubic Cs2AgBiBr6 in which the outlined circles from inner to outer are attributed to (200), (220), (311), and so on, facets of the cubic polycrystalline structure, which is consistent with the XRD results as shown in Fig. 3b, while SAED patterns of Cs2AgBiBr6 with DMSO adducts (Fig. 5e) show weak diffraction spot ring that might be ascribed to a higher degree of crystallinity although it reflects similar facets to that of the control sample. The HRTEM images of both samples shown in Fig. 5c and f highlighted that both films have well-defined lattice spacing fringes with an interplanar spacing of about 0.29 nm, which indicates highly crystalline single grains and can be assigned to the (400) facet of cubic Cs2AgBiBr6,57 in accord with the dominant XRD peak at 31.8° as shown in Fig. 3b.

To detect the chemical states of the Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite films, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted. The expected elements including Cs, Ag, Bi and Br are found in the survey spectra of the Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite films as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). High-resolution XPS spectra of Cs 3d, Ag 3d, Bi 4f and Br 3d are shown in Fig. 6a–d, respectively. The characteristic peaks of Cs 3d are observed at 724 eV and 738.5 eV with a peak splitting of 14.5 eV, which is assigned to Cs 3d3/2 and Cs 3d5/2, respectively. The Ag 3d spectrum shows a doublet of peaks centered at 368.1 eV and 374.1 eV, assigned to the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 peaks of Ag+ ions, respectively. The XPS spectrum of Bi 4f displays two peaks centered at 159.2 eV and 164.6 eV, corresponding to the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 peaks of Bi3+ ions, respectively. Br 3d can be split into two separate peaks located at 68.5 eV and 69.5 eV, which belong to Br 3d3/2 and Br 3d5/2, respectively. The corresponding chemical composition from the XPS spectra shows that the atomic ratio of the elements in the present film is about 2.01:1.01:1.00:5.78 for Cs, Ag, Bi and Br, respectively, which is approximately equal to the stoichiometric composition of the ideal Cs2AgBiBr6.

The valence band maximum (VBM) and the energy band gap (Eg) of the DMSO adduct-derived Cs2AgBiBr6 film were also measured using ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) and UV–vis absorption spectra. The position of the valence band with respect to the vacuum level of the sample was calculated to be 5.94 eV from the ionization potential, which provided detailed quantitative information on the electronic structure of the molecules, by subtracting the width of the Eonset (Fig. 7a) and Ecut-off (Fig. 7b) region of the UPS spectrum from the excitation energy of 21.22 eV of the He I source. Fig. 7c shows the UV–vis spectrum of the sample, and the corresponding Tauc plot in which (αhν)rversus hν, where α, h, and ν are the absorption coefficient, the Planck constant and incident light frequency, respectively,58 is presented in the inset of Fig. 7c. Similar characteristic absorption spectra have been observed as in an earlier study in which Cs2AgBiBr6 is regarded as an indirect band gap semiconductor with the phonon-assisted process,47 and r is thus equal to 1/2 in this case. The band gap (Eg) of Cs2AgBiBr6 is estimated to be 2.22 eV and the corresponding conduction band minimum is derived to be 3.72 eV from the valence band maximum and Eg. To facilitate charge transport, a Cs2AgBiBr6-based planar device structure is constructed in which a thin layer of SnO2 and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (SpiroOMeTAD) are used as the electron- and hole-transport materials, respectively. The corresponding band alignment of the device is shown in Fig. 7d. The good matching for conduction band minimum and valence band maximum of Cs2AgBiBr6 with SnO2 and SpiroMeTAD, along with the suitable work function of ITO and Ag, is beneficial for the directional flow of photo-generated electrons and, as a result, a considerable current density for the solar cells is expected to be attained.

A schematic representation of the Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cell devices used in this work is shown in Fig. 8a and a corresponding cross-sectional SEM image of the device (the film annealed at 250 °C) is given in Fig. 8b. Each functional layer is observed clearly. The thickness of the Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite film is about 200 nm, which might not be thick enough to catch more sunlight for a better performance and is mainly limited by the relatively low solubility of the precursor in the commonly used solvents. A thicker absorber layer should be investigated, to seek suitable polar solvents or mixtures, in future work. The J–V curve of the DMSO-adduct-derived Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells was measured under illumination of AM 1.5G simulated sunlight at a power density of 100 mW cm−2 at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 8c. As a comparison, the J–V curve of a solar cell based on the control film is also presented (red symbols and lines in Fig. 8c). The key parameters of the solar cells extracted from the J–V curves are listed as shown in Table 1. For the best performing device based on the control film, a current density (Jsc) of 1.51 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.63 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.55 are obtained, thus leading to a power conversion efficiency of 0.52%. It should be noted that, except for a comparable Jsc, a decent Voc and FF of 0.87 V and 0.61, respectively, are achieved in the best performing DMSO-adduct-derived solar cell and, as a result, the maximum PCE of 0.73% is attained, which shows a significant enhancement of about 40.38% compared to that of the control sample. The DMSO adduct derived a uniform and dense film without pin-holes, which decreased greatly the non-radiative recombination on the surface of the absorption layer,40 and which might be attributed to the great improvement of the performance of the devices. Fig. 8d displays the statistical parameter distribution of 16 solar cells that were assembled with Cs2AgBiBr6 films prepared without and with DMSO adducts, and better reproducibility is observed for the DMSO-adduct-based samples, suggesting that the findings of this work might pave the way for bismuth-based optoelectronics.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated a facile route for the synthesis of lead-free double Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskites with a DMSO-adduct-assisted strategy for the first time. The BiBr3(DMSO)2 adduct powder, which is derived from BiBr3 and DMSO solvent via an antisolvent method, has been used to control the process of crystallization and nucleation to yield a more uniform and a denser Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite film compared to the control sample. Further investigations on the post-treatment Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite films were carried out, and with the optimized process a high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite film with good crystallinity was obtained. As a result, the best performing solar cells based on this high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 film exhibit a higher Voc and FF than that of the device based on the control film without the DMSO adduct, indicating the low defect densities of the DMSO-adduct-derived film, and finally, the highest PCE of 0.73% is attained, showing an enhancement of 40% compared with the device based on the control sample. There is still much room for improvement in the device performance, and we believe that this finding will open up new possibilities for attaining highly efficient Cs2AgBiBr6 or other lead-free perovskite (for example, Cs3Bi2Br9) films and devices.
