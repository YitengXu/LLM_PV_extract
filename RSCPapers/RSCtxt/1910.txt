    , Accepted 17th February 2021First published on 18th February 2021AbstractConstructing a van der Waals heterostructure is a practical way to promote the conversion efficiency of solar energy. Here, we demonstrate the efficient performance of a GeSe/AsP heterostructure in solar energy cells based on the first-principles calculations. The electronic properties, optical absorption, and optoelectronic properties are calculated to evaluate the efficiency of the newly designed heterostructure. The results indicate that the GeSe/AsP heterostructure possesses a type-II band alignment with an indirect bandgap of 1.10 eV, which greatly promotes the effective separation of photogenerated carriers. Besides, an intrinsic electric field is formed in the direction from the AsP to GeSe monolayer, which is beneficial to prevent the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pair. Simultaneously, a strong optical absorption is observed in the visible light range. The predicted power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure is 16.0% and can be promoted to 17.3% by applying 1% biaxial compression strain. The present results indicate that the GeSe/AsP heterostructure is a promising candidate material for high-performance solar cells.
1. Introduction
Solar energy conversion technologies, such as photocatalytic and solar cells, have exhibited great potential in alleviating the current energy shortage and environmental problems. In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been regarded as promising candidates for solar energy conversion due to their adjustable bandgap and excellent optical and mechanical properties.1–3 Nevertheless, despite these advantages, the photocatalytic activities of 2D materials are still mainly suppressed due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers in their migration process. A van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure formed by stacking different monolayer materials is identified as a useful method to tune the electronic properties of individual monolayers by coupling their band edges.4–6 In particular, the type-II heterostructure with a staggered band alignment can accelerate the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers and inhibit the recombination of the photogenerated carriers, which is suitable for light capture.7,8 Therefore, the development of efficient type-II heterostructures is considered promising for next-generation solar cell applications. For example, Slimane et al.9 have experimentally reported a conversion efficiency of 18.7% for a solar energy cell with an AlGaAs/InGaP heterojunction.
Recently, germanium monoselenide (GeSe), a binary group-IV monochalcogenide, has attracted much attention and exhibits excellent optical properties and high carrier mobility, which are suitable for high-performance photovoltaic applications.10,11 In recent experiments, the monolayer GeSe has been successfully fabricated by mechanical exfoliation and the laser thinning method. Notably, Xue et al.12 proposed a superstrate ITO/CdS/GeSe/Au solar cell with a 1.48% efficiency using the GeSe thin-film as an absorber material and demonstrated the potential application of the GeSe thin film in a photovoltaic device. Subsequently, several theoretical studies mainly focused on designing high PCE GeSe thin-film solar cells.13 Especially, Xia et al.7 revealed that the optical absorption of a GeSe/SnS heterostructure could be improved compared with that of an individual GeSe monolayer, and Lv et al.14 further demonstrated that the PCE of GeSe/SnS could reach ∼18%. Moreover, Mao et al.15 also have predicted a higher PCE in a GeSe/SnSe heterostructure than those of the previously reported heterostuctures, and the obtained efficiency reaches 21.47%. These studies indicate that designing GeSe-based vdW heterostructures is promising for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of the GeSe monolayer. Arsenic phosphorus (AsP), a 2D group VA binary compound similar to black phosphorus, has been successfully synthesized and its more fascinating properties have been explored in recent reports.16,17 However, the electronic and photovoltaic properties of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure are still unexplored.
In this paper, we construct a GeSe/AsP heterostructure by vertically stacking GeSe and AsP monolayers, and demonstrate their potential applications in solar cells. The band alignment, charge transfer, and optical properties of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure are calculated using the first-principles calculations. The results demonstrate that using the GeSe/AsP heterostructure, a high PCE of 16% can be achieved. More importantly, it is also found that the power conversion efficiency of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure is affected by external strain. Under a 1% compressive strain, the power conversion efficiency increases up to 17.3%. The present findings indicate that the GeSe/AsP heterostructure has potential for application in high-efficiency solar cells.
2. Computational details
The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)18,19 implemented with the density functional theory (DFT) is used to explore the geometrical structure and the electronic properties of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure. The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method20,21 is used for treating the interactions between the ions and valence electrons. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is used to describe the exchange and correlation potential.22 The density functional dispersion correction (D3-Grimme),23 which has been proved to give a trusty description of the vdW heterostructure, is used in the present calculations. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional is used to calculate the electronic properties, optical properties, and mobility because the GGA-PBE functional usually predicts a smaller bandgap than the actual value.24 To avoid the interaction between adjacent layers, we add 20 Å vacuum regions along the z-direction. The convergence values of the forces and energy are set to −0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−6 eV, respectively. The cutoff energy of the plane-wave basis is set to 500 eV, and 10 × 10 × 1 Γ-centered Monkhorst-Pack25k-point meshes are used to sample the Brillouin zone in the process of the geometrical optimization. To access the thermal stability of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure, we constructed a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell and carried out ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 500 and 800 K. Based on a canonical ensemble (NVT) with the Nose–Hoover thermostat,26,27 the total simulation time lasts 10 ps and the time step is 2 fs. In the present simulations, the symmetry restriction is canceled, and all the ions in the supercell can freely move. Moreover, we calculate the phonon dispersion by employing norm-conserving pseudopotentials. A 5 × 5 × 1 grid mesh and a cutoff energy of 750 eV are used. These calculations are performed with the aid of the CASTEP code in the Materials Studio.28
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometrical structure and stability
The geometrical structures of the GeSe and AsP monolayers are optimized first. The results demonstrate that both layers have orthogonal structures, and each unit cell contains four atoms. As illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the lattice structures of the GeSe and AsP monolayers are similar to that of phosphorene,29,30 exhibiting a puckered atomic layer. For the GeSe monolayer, each Ge (Se) atom binds to two adjacent Se (Ge) atoms in the same atomic layer and one Se (Ge) atom in the other atomic layer; while for the AsP monolayer, each As (P) atom forms three As–P bonds with the neighboring P (As) atom. The optimized lattice parameters of a and b for the GeSe (AsP) monolayer are 3.97 and 4.30 Å (3.51 and 4.62 Å), respectively. The results are in good agreement with those of previous reports of Xie et al. and Xu et al.31,32
To identify the possible configuration of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure, we built vdW structures in four ways, as shown in Fig. 1. They are represented by AAI, AAII, ABI, and ABII, respectively. The upper GeSe monolayer of AAI directly covers the lower AsP monolayer, and all atoms of the two monolayers are aligned. Compared with AAI, the top layer of ABI moves half of the unit cell along with a and b directions at the same time, resulting in a staggered alignment. AAII can be regarded as a derivative of AAI with the bottom layer rotating 180° along with the z-axis. Like that of AAII, the configuration of ABII is obtained by rotating the bottom layer of ABI 180° along with the z-axis.

Fig. 1a–d demonstrates the optimized configurations of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure, including the equilibrium interlayer distances and interfacial binding energies (Ebs) of each heterostructure. Here, Eb = EGeSe/AsP − EAsP, while EGeSe/AsP, EGeSe, and EAsP represent the total energies of the GeSe/AsP heterostructures, and those of the GeSe and AsP monolayers, respectively.33,34 The Ebs increase along with the increase of the equilibrium interlayer distances. The largest Eb of 310 meV per unit corresponding to the minimum interlayer distance of 2.94 Å is attributed to the ABI heterostructure. The interlayer distance close to 3 Å indicates that the GeSe and AsP monolayers are bound by weak van der Waals force. However, Eb of ABI is larger than those of several typical heterostructures, such as bilayer graphene, the BlueP/g-GaN heterostructure, graphene/MoS2 heterostructure.35–38
To evaluate the dynamical stability of ABI, we calculate the phonon dispersion for the GeSe/AsP heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 2a, the phonon dispersion curves show no imaginary frequency over the first Brillouin zones, which ensures the dynamical stability of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure. Additionally, the AIMD results in Fig. 2b demonstrate no significant change of the atomic positions and lattice after running 10 ps at 500 and 800 K, implying that the GeSe/AsP heterostructure with an ABI-stacking is thermodynamically stable. The AIMD results of the ABII-stacking heterostructure are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The results show no significant change of the atomic positions and lattice after running for 10 ps at 500 K, implying that the ABII-stacking heterostructure is thermodynamically stable. Unfortunately, ABII obviously deformed at a high temperature of 800 K. Obviously, ABI is the most stable one of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure because its Eb is the largest among all the other considered ones and the ABII-stacking heterostructure is not dynamically stable at 800 K although its binding energy is not significantly different from that of the ABI-stacking one.

3.2 The electronic properties of the GeSe and AsP monolayers and their heterostructure
The band alignments of the GeSe and AsP monolayers obtained using the HSE06 functional are shown in Fig. 2c and d. The characteristic features of an indirect bandgap can be found for both GeSe and AsP monolayers, and their bandgaps of 1.59 and 1.47 eV are in agreement with those reported previously,14,31 respectively. The GeSe and AsP monolayers are under a significant level of strain, and the strain effects are apparent in the band structure. As shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†), both GeSe and AsP monolayers exhibit a similar change tendency with the variation of biaxial stains. One can see that the bandgap decreases from 1.59 (1.47) to 1.31 (0.78) eV in the GeSe (AsP) monolayer with the increase of the compressive strain from −1% to −4%, while increases from 1.59 (1.47) to 1.81 (1.86) eV under 1%–4% tensile strain. Moreover, both the GeSe and the AsP monolayers exhibit the direct bandgap characteristics.
The band structure projection of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure in Fig. 2e shows that the band characteristics of the separate GeSe and AsP monolayers remain well. The heterostructure has an indirect gap of 1.10 eV, which is smaller than those of the separate monolayers. Moreover, the band structure projection indicates that the CBM is mainly composed of the GeSe monolayer, while the VBM comes from the AsP monolayer.
The results of the projected density of states (PDOS) can provide detailed information on the contribution of monolayers to the electronic properties. The PDOS of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure in Fig. 3a demonstrate that the AsP monolayer mainly contributes to the CBM (purple line) but the GeSe monolayer (orange line) to the VBM.
 Fig. 3  (a) Projected densities of state, (b) partial charge density distributions, and (c) plane averaged potential drop along the z-direction of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure. Orange and green in (c) represent the charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. The isovalue is set to 0.005 e bohr−3. 
Also, the charge density distributions for the VBM and the CBM of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure in Fig. 3b also give the same conclusion because the charge density distribution of the VBM is located at the GeSe monolayer but that of the CBM at the AsP monolayer. The results support that the heterostructure of the GeSe and AsP monolayers is of the type-II structure, which is beneficial to the spontaneous separation of the photogenerated pair. The results in Fig. S5 (ESI†) demonstrate the ABII-stacking heterostructure has similar electronic properties to the ABI-stacking one. So, we mainly present the results of the ABI-stacking heterostructure for the sake of brevity.
To explore the charge redistribution between the GeSe and AsP monolayers, we calculate the plane-averaged charge density difference Δρ(z) by using , where ρGeSe/AsP(x, y, z)dxdy, ρGeSe(x, y, z)dxdy, and ρAsP(x, y, z)dxdy are the charge density at (x, y, z) points of the GeSe/AsP heterostructures, the GeSe monolayer, and the AsP monolayer, respectively. The charge density differences in Fig. 3c demonstrate a significant charge redistribution in the GeSe/AsP heterostructure. A noticeable charge increase appears at the interfacial region near the AsP monolayer, while a charge decrease occurs next to the GeSe monolayer, implying the charge transfers from the GeSe layer to the AsP layer in the GeSe/AsP heterostructure. This charge transfer can introduce an effective build-in electric field similar to the cases of BP/BSe,39 ZnO/WSe2,40 and InSe/g-C3N4 heterostructures,41 which is important for the photoelectronic performance of the heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 3d and Fig. S6 (ESI†), the electrostatic potential difference at the two sides of the GeSe/AsP interface is 3.06 eV, which also indicates a significant built-in electric field from the AsP layer to the GeSe layer. This built-in electric field can accelerate the photoelectrons migrate from GeSe to AsP, and holes migrate from the AsP to GeSe monolayer, which will be beneficial for many photoelectronic applications.
3.3 The photovoltaic behaviors of the GeSe/AsP heterostructures
Considering that the type-II band alignment of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure can be used in solar cells, we calculate the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure device. The method of Scharber et al.42 for PCE can be expressed using (1)where the fill factor βFF is set to 0.65, and VOC is the maximum open-circuit voltage estimated using Edg − ΔEC − 0.3, where Edg and ΔEC are the bandgap of the donor and the conduction band offset, respectively. The short circuit current JSC is obtained by the integral in the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency, where P(ℏω) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy ℏω. Obviously, the band alignment and the band offset of a heterostructure are the important factors to evaluate its application in optoelectronic devices and the photovoltaic industry. The band edges and band offsets of the two monolayers in the GeSe/AsP heterostructure are calculated based on the vacuum level. As shown in Fig. 4a, the calculated results show that the CBM and the VBM of AsP are lower than those of GeSe, which further confirms the type-II characteristics of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure. Here, the GeSe layer is the donor and the AsP layer is the receptor, and their bandgaps are 1.37 and 1.47 eV, respectively. The CBO and the valence band offset (VBO) of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure are 0.268 and 0.339 eV, respectively. In order to further confirm the migration of photogenerated carriers at the interface, we also have plotted the band edge alignment of the separate GeSe and AsP monolayers before and after putting them together, respectively.43–45 As shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†), the GeSe monolayer has higher CB and VB positions and a smaller work function (higher Fermi level) than the AsP one. When the GeSe monolayer contacts the AsP one, electrons in the former will transfer into the latter until their Fermi levels become equal. As a result, the AsP side is positively charged, and the GeSe one is negatively charged at the interface. Therefore, a built-in electric field from the AsP to the GeSe monolater is formed, which can transfer the photogenerated-electrons from the GeSe to the AsP monolayer. The PCE contour plots of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure are shown in Fig. 4b. The PCE of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure is as high as 16% and larger than that of the AsP/CdSe heterostructure (13%)46 and comparable to that of phosphorene/MoS2 (16–18%).47 The exciton binding energy in the GeSe monolayer is a key quantity to determine the energetics of photoexcited electron transfer to AsP.48 The exciton binding energy is evaluated by comparing the GW direct bandgap energy with the imaginary part peak of the dielectric function εi by BSE.49 So, we have performed GW + BSE calculations to obtain the exciton binding energy. The results in Fig. S7(b) (ESI†) show that the first peak of εi corresponds to the lowest excitation energy of 2.15 eV, which is smaller than the related band gap Eg of 2.26 eV. Therefore, the exciton binding energy is 0.11 eV, which should not significantly impact the bandgap relative to the photoexcited electron transfer between the two monolayers.

3.4 The optical properties and carrier mobility
Appropriate bandgap characteristics of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure with high PCE are expected to effectively respond to visible light. To quantitatively understand the optical absorption, we calculate the absorption coefficient α(ω). In this part, α(ω) is obtained from the real parts ε1(ω) and imaginary parts ε2(ω) of the dielectric function via the following equation:50–53 (2)
As shown in Fig. 4c, the absorption peak of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure obtained using the HSE06 functional can reach 5 × 104 cm−1 in the visible light region, although it is lower than that of the separate GeSe monolayer, which indicates that the GeSe/AsP heterostructure could catch solar energy enough to ensure PCE.
The carrier mobility is closely related to electronic and optoelectronic properties. The formula for determining the carrier mobility along with the armchair and zigzag directions based on the deformation potential (DP) theory can be written as:54–57 (3)where e represents the electronic charge, ℏ and KB are the reduced Planck constant and Boltzmann constant, T means the temperature, and C is the elastic modulus with C = (1/S0)(∂2E/∂ε2). Here ε is the uniaxial strain along with a specific direction. We define ε = (Lstrain − Lunstrain)/Lstrain, where Lstrain and Lunstrain represent the lattice constants under strain and no strain, respectively. E is the total energy of the system after the strain is applied, and S0 is the area of the 2D-structure. In the meantime, m* is the effective mass that can be obtained using (4)where k is the wave vector and E(k) represents the energy corresponding to k. Deformation potential constant Ed is calculated using Ed = ∂Eedge/∂ε, where Eedge is the energy change of the band edge under uniaxial strain.
The results are summarized in Table 1, and the calculated details are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The mobilities of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure in Table 1 are anisotropic because they are significantly different along with zigzag and armchair directions. The highest hole mobility of 2.32 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 is attributed to the zigzag direction, which can be understood from the fact that the effective mass of the hole is smaller than that of the electron. Noticeably, the carrier mobility of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure is larger than those of many reported heterostructures, such as GeSe/SnSe15 and BP/SnSe.17 The large mobility of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure also enhances its promising application in electronic, spintronic, and photovoltaic devices.

3.5 The effect of strain on the GeSe/AsP heterostructure
A large number of previous reports have confirmed that the mechanical strain can effectively control the electronic and optical properties of 2D materials.58–63 To fully understand the effect of strain on the electronic and optical properties of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure, we determined the changes in the optical absorption coefficient and band edges under the in-plane biaxial strains between −4% and 4%. The results for the absorption coefficient in the visible region under the strains are shown in Fig. 4d. It is found that the absorption coefficient is enhanced in different ranges under different strains. For example, the −4% strain significantly increases the absorption in the range of 580–680 nm, while the 4% strain obviously enhances the absorption in the range of 470–570 nm. However, the decrease of the optical absorption is also observed in some ranges of wavelengths. To access the controlling effect more accurately, we calculate the areas formed by the axis and the optical absorption curves in the visible light range and present the results in Fig. 5. The results show that the largest increase in absorption is attributed to 2% compressive strain. Importantly, the 1% compressive strain not only promotes PCE to 17.39% but also enhances the optical absorption by 0.5%, which strengthens the power conversion performance of the heterostructure.

The orange and green dots represent contributions from 2D GeSe and AsP monolayers, respectively. (e) The changes in the bandgap, CBO, PCE, and absorption. The blue histogram represents PCE, and the green and red histograms are the variations in the area of optical absorption curves in the visible light region. The green and red areas represent the increase and decrease of the integral area, respectively. 
The changes in the band edges and gaps of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure under biaxial strains are calculated, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 5a–d and Fig. S9 (ESI†). It should be noted that the type-II band alignment of the heterostructure always remains under all the considered biaxial strains. The k point positions of the CBM and VBM remain unchanged under all the strains except the compression strains of 2–4% where the VBM shifts from a point between Γ and X to the Γ point, but the characteristics of indirect bandgap remain. Fig. 5e demonstrates the changes in the bandgap, CBO, PCE, and the change of absorption for the heterostructure under different strains. The bandgap increases with the increase of tensile strain but decreases with the increase of compressive strain. However, CBO shows a different tendency. A minimum CBO of 0.197 eV is observed under 1% compression strain, implying that the CBO will become larger under the other tensile or compressive strains. Consequently, a maximum PCE of 17.39% can be achieved under 1% compression strain; meanwhile, the optical absorption area in the visible light region under the 1% compression strain has increased by 0.5%. However, it should be noted that the strain (−1%) corresponding to the largest PCE is not that (−2%) corresponding to the maximum optical absorption area, which implies that controlling the effect of strain on the photoelectronic performance of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure for solar energy cells is complicated. The changes in both optical absorption and PCE under strain should be considered to achieve the best performance in photovoltaic and solar applications.
The interaction between the two monolayers will change both the geometrical configuration and the electronic properties of a heterostructure, which may induce some uncertain photoelectronic performance. In order to avoid the obvious changes in the heterostructure and try to keep the geometry and electronic properties of the monolayer independent in the heterostructure, one should select two monolayers with similar lattice parameters (i.e., little lattice mismatch ratio) to form a heterostructure. Moreover, a heterostructure in a real device will be supported and contacted with the electrodes. Generally, both the substrate and electrode materials will impact the heterostructure to some extent. Fortunately, some materials suitable for supporting most heterostructures are found, such as Si and SiO2 substrates.64,65 Usually, they modify only a little the heterostructures with strain or chemical corrosion because of their high hardness and large corrosion resistance. Theretofore, the effect of the substrates should be evaluated experimentally to choose the suitable materials to avoid modifying a heterostructure evidently before preparing a device with a specific heterostructure.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the feasibility of applying the GeSe/AsP heterostructure in high PCE solar cells is explored by using density functional theory. The most stable geometrical configuration of the heterostructure is obtained through the binding energies of the four possible structures. Its type-II band alignment is confirmed using the band structure projection and PDOS, and is beneficial for its photoelectronic performance. An enhanced optical absorption in the visible light range is observed, which means that the GeSe/AsP heterostructure can respond well to the solar light. A large carrier mobility of 2.32 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 supports that using this heterostructure a good photoelectronic performance can be achieved. Notably, the present PCE of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure can reach 16%, which is higher than those of many other reported heterostructures. Moreover, the optical absorption in the visible light range, the band edges, the bandgap, and the CBO of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure can be effectively tuned under strain. The enhanced optical absorption and promotion of PCE are observed, although they do not correspond to the same strain, which implies that a better photoelectronic performance can be achieved by carefully applying strain. All these results support that the GeSe/AsP heterostructure is a potential candidate material for solar cells. The present findings provide helpful guidance for the development of efficient solar cells based on the GeSe/AsP heterostructure.
