    , Accepted 25th April 2022First published on 26th April 2022AbstractThe rapid population explosion and widespread use of non-renewable energy sources have led to preoccupations such as the energy crisis, which motivates us to find alternative energy supplies and further harness their output energy through energy storage devices. In this work, we have demonstrated hybrids incorporating MoWS2 and nanocarbon (MWCNT and rGO) as bifunctional materials, i.e., electrocatalyst and negatrode (negative electrode), for both energy conversion and storage applications. All the fabricated electrodes underwent various characterization techniques including pXRD, Raman spectroscopy, FESEM, HRTEM, XPS, and BET, and were later subjected to electrochemical and electrocatalytic measurements. The MoWS2 incorporating MWCNTs outperformed all the prepared materials, attaining a highest capacitance of 592 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. An asymmetric device was also fabricated using CoSe2@CNT@rGO as the positive electrode and MoWS2@MWCNT as the negative electrode, and it achieved a highest capacitance of 151 F g−1 with an energy density of 36 W h kg−1, corresponding to a power density of 14 kW kg−1, and exceptional capacitance retention and coulombic efficiency of 96% and 97%, respectively. The pseudocapacitive negatrode materials were demonstrated to be applicable for electrocatalytic HER applications with decent performance (η0: 175 mV, Tafel slope: 34 mV dec−1) and outstanding sustained stability of up to 12 hours. The higher surface area, barrier-free pathway for charge transfer, role of the valence electrons in the metal ions, rapid charge kinetics, and highly suitable active sites contributed significantly to the better electrochemical and electrocatalytic activity of MoWS2@MWCNT. First-principles DFT calculations were also executed to validate the supercapacitive performance by means of quantum capacitance.
1. Introduction
History has witnessed that whenever there is a need or demand, the human race has always beaten all the odds to deal with the situation and come out with flying colours. The population upsurge and disproportionate dependency on non-renewable energy sources has led the world to an incessant terrifying energy craving, which has been identified as a major worrying modern-day problem. To contend with this energy crisis, the research community has put a lot of effort into searching for sustainable and renewable energy sources and methods to subsequently store this energy via energy storage devices.1–3 Accordingly, generating oxygen (oxygen evolution reaction: OER) and hydrogen (hydrogen evolution reaction: HER) through the dissociation of water has proven to be the most effective way of meeting the energy demand. The HER has been widely investigated and subsequently put into real-time application owing to its efficiency, lower power input, and non-hazardous effect on the environment.4 A plethora of noble metals (Pt, Ru, Ir, Rh), their metal oxide forms (RuO2, IrO2, RhO2), and mixtures of these metals with other metals (PtIrCo, PtRuIr, IrCoRu) are considered to be promising entrants in this field, as they produce hydrogen at almost zero overpotential.4–6 The only shortcoming of these materials is the difficulty of their scalable and mass production in real time, which is attributed to their high cost and low availability. Therefore, focusing on cost-effective, exceedingly stable, adequately available, highly efficient, and easily accessible electrocatalysts with better charge kinetics reactivity is the need of the hour. The resulting sustainable, robust energy can be stored for imminent use via energy storage devices. Batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors have been frequently used and explored for this purpose.7 Low power densities, high irreversibility, sensitivity to temperature (bursting concerns), sluggish reaction kinetics, high cost, high weight, and lack of supply are the major issues facing batteries and fuel cells. Thus, ultracapacitors are becoming preferred owing to their high power density, reversibility, eco-friendliness, and greater stability with quick charge–discharge cycling. Low energy density, line control, inconsistency, and less commercialization due to high cost are the core challenges that face supercapacitors; these could be overcome by assessment of material diversity through forming heterostructures, surface modifications, doping, alloying, etc.
A variety of materials have been investigated to overcome the challenges in this area, among which two-dimensional materials such as graphene, black phosphorus, MXenes, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs, referred to as MX2), transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs, referred to as MX3), etc., have advantages.8,9 The family of transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2; where M is the transition metal and X is a chalcogen, e.g., MoS2, VS2, WS2, WSe2, VSe2, MoSe2, etc.) have attracted profuse interest and attention due to their unique electrical, physicochemical, thermal, and optical properties.10–15 Metal sulphides, owing to their tunable properties, defect-rich structure, superior conductivity, high pH tolerance, and diverse behaviour, have been particularly fruitful for attaining multifunctionality in the vast fields of supercapacitors, catalysis, batteries, solar cells, biomedical applications, etc. Molybdenum- and tungsten-based sulphides (MoS2 and WS2) are in demand among the metal sulphide family and have been widely investigated in the fields of supercapacitors and the HER due to their high catalytic activity and multiple oxidation variance. Many undiscovered opportunities exist in this line of application and these materials can be tuned by several modification approaches as reported previously.10–12
Recently, many research groups have been modifying the tunable properties of the aforementioned sulphides to obtain better results in energy conversion and energy storage applications. The incorporation of nanocarbons (single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), carbon nanofiber, graphene, nanodiamond, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) into the TMDCs not only provides high surface area and abundant active sites, but the nanocarbons also act as conductive skeletons for ion diffusion and transportation.14 In 2016, Zhu et al. studied the HER catalytic performance of MoWS2 and achieved a low Tafel slope of 131 mV dec−1 and excellent stability.16 The next year, Terrones and their group synthesized a MoWS2@rGO heterostructure that was explored for HER applications in an acidic electrolyte via a low temperature synthesis procedure; the material attained an overpotential of 96 mV with an Tafel slope of 38 mV dec−1.17 Another group grew MoWS2 on two substrates (carbon nanotube yarn and carbon cloth) and obtained excellent overpotentials (180 mV and 145 mV) as well as small Tafel slopes (46.7 and 41.8 mV per decade) in H2SO4 electrolyte.18 MoS2@rGO has been used for asymmetric supercapacitor studies, and the authors achieved a specific capacitance of 148 F g−1 (0.5 A g−1) with an energy density of 15 W h kg−1, corresponding power density of 373 W kg−1, and stability of 70% over 3000 charge–discharge cycles.11 In addition to this, many hierarchal systems have been subjected to electrochemical measurements.19–26 However, to our knowledge, MoWS2 is not being used as an electrode for supercapacitors which can beexplored. Herein, to the best of our knowledge, we have demonstrated MoWS2 and its nanocarbon (MWCNT and rGO)-incorporating hybrids as bifunctional, i.e., electrocatalyst and negatrode, materials for both energy conversion and storage applications for the very first time. The promising results are compared with recently published reports in the literature. Computational analysis is performed using first-principles DFT calculations to authenticate the energy storage performance by means of quantum capacitance.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Material synthesis
The primary material MoWS2 (hereafter MWS) was prepared by a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The molybdenum source, sodium molybdate (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich), and the tungsten source, sodium tungstate (≥98%, SRL), were added in a 1.2:1 molar ratio to 40 mL deionised (DI) water and kept stirring. Then, the sulphur source, thiourea (≥99%, SDFCL), and the reducing agent oxalic acid were added (≥99%, Qualigens) in a 5:1 molar ratio to the above-prepared solution after first being stirred into 20 mL DI water to obtain a homogenous transparent mixture. The uniform suspension was placed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was placed in a hot air oven at 200 °C for 24 h. A similar method was utilized to synthesize MWSC and MWSR via the following addition of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT, ≥95%, 1–10 μm length, sum of the walls varied from 3–15 μm, Reinste Nano Ventures Pvt. Ltd., which were functionalized before using acid treatment) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO, synthesized using an adapted Hummer's method), respectively. The amount of both nanocarbons was fixed to 40 mg for in situ synthesis of the heterostructures. Thereafter, all the prepared samples were washed five times with water and two times with ethanol at 5000 rpm for 45 minutes in total by centrifugation to remove all impurities along with unreacted species. Lastly, the samples were finely dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 60 °C to obtain black-coloured fine powders by pestling. Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the methodology adopted to synthesize all the materials along with their expected structures. The hybrid structures MoWS2@MWCNT and MoWS2@rGO are abbreviated as MSWR and MWSC, respectively.

2.2. Electrode preparation
Electrodes were prepared by drop-casting the synthesized materials on Ni foam (1.2 mm thickness), which was systematically cleaned before use using acetone, dilute hydrochloric acid, DI water, and ethanol sequentially for quite a bit of time. Prior to drop-casting, the materials were dispersed in isopropyl alcohol (≥99%, SDFCL) and Nafion (5 wt% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and H2O containing 45% water, Sigma-Aldrich) in a ratio of 19:1 and ultrasonicated for 20 minutes. The electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 2 h to evaporate all the solvents used. This procedure was used for both symmetric and asymmetric assemblies in the two-electrode configuration. For three-electrode and HER measurements, a slurry was made using a similar method, but around 20 μL of the suspension (0.2 mg mass loading) was poured over a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in the diameter, active area of 0.0706 cm2), which was regarded to be the active electrode. The GCE was frequently scrubbed before every measurement using a tiny amount of aluminium oxide powder (size 1 μm, 0.3 μm and 0.05 μm) and DI water and later sonicated in ethanol and kept for drying.
2.3. Material characterization
All the samples were characterized using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV with an NI-filter for Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 0.1541 nm) in order to confirm the structure, phase group, and lattice parameters. Further, study of the vibrational modes of the samples was performed using a Renishaw Raman spectrometer (furnished with a He–Ne laser with a power of 1 mW cm−2 and excitation wavelength of 532 nm, Renishaw, UK). Surface morphological information and elemental mapping were conducted using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7100F, Singapore). The surface elements present, along with their oxidation states and binding energies, were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Microtech spectrometer MultiLab, ESCA-3000 with Kα radiation of 1486.74 eV). The surface area analysis was done using a Bellsorp max (Japan) instrument.
2.4. Electrochemical characterization
A Swagelok cell with a two-electrode configuration was used to investigate the electrochemical behaviour of all the samples using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at room temperature in conjunction with a Wuhan Corrtest electrochemical workstation (CS350, version 5.3). An aqueous electrolyte (0.5 M K2SO4) was used for both the two-electrode and three-electrode configurations. For symmetric assembly, the well-dried electrodes were prepared identically and sandwiched between a regular filter paper, and the electrolyte was introduced. The specific capacitance, energy density and power density for every configuration were calculated using the typical formula (given by eqn (S1)–(S4) in the ESI†). In the asymmetric configuration, the charge was balanced by varying the mass loading through the three-electrode data of the electrodes using the following equation: (1)where M+, M−, V+, V−, C+, and C− stand for the electrodes' masses, optimised potential windows and charges for both electrode sites. For practical use, we fabricated the asymmetric device in a similar way, except the aqueous electrolyte was replaced with a K2SO4–PVA solid gel electrolyte and the entire set-up was pouched inside 4 × 4 cm2 squares of Kapton tape.27
For HER measurements, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was employed. The active-material-coated GCE, platinum (Pt) wire, and Ag/AgCl were considered to be the active, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. 1 M H2SO4 was used as an aqueous electrolyte for the HER studies, and LSV was recorded at 5 mV s−1 for all the prepared samples, along with a bare standard 20% Pt/C sample. The obtained potential values were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potentials, and the Tafel slopes were calculated using the following equations: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.197(2) η = blog|J| + a(3)where η stands for the overpotential, J signifies the current density, a is the Tafel constant, and b represents the Tafel slope.27
2.5. Computational details (density functional calculations)
To understand the structural, electronic, and supercapacitive properties of MWS, MWSR, and MWSC, density functional theory28 calculations were implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)29 with projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudo-potentials.30 To approximate the exchange–correlation functional, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was executed.31,32 The optimised relaxation analysis with the PAW potentials was accomplished using a 500.0 eV energy cut-off, and a Γ-center K-mesh was considered for reciprocal space sampling. The exchange–correlation part was estimated using the PBEsol functional,33 which talks about the structural descriptions over the standard GGA method. The conversion of the total energy and Hellman–Feynman force for individual atoms were narrowed down to 10−6 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively.
In addition, a 15 Å vacuum was maintained along the crystallographic c-direction to avoid possible interactions between images. After complete relaxation of the pristine MoWS2 layer, a single-walled carbon nanotube with chirality (8, 0) at a distance 3.5 Å above the MWS layer and reduced graphene oxides at a distance 3.9 Å above the MWS layer were taken into consideration. For convenience in the demanding calculations, the multiwalled carbon nanotubes were replaced with a single-walled carbon nanotube.34
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Structural and morphological characterization
Powder XRD was used to analyse the structural arrangement and lattice parameters of all the samples. All the peaks appearing in the stacked XRD (Fig. 2a) matched those of MoS2 and WS2 in the existing literature (JCPDS card no: 37-1492 and 08-0237). The peak at 13.8° for MWS corresponds to the (002) diffraction plane, which confirmed the growth of nanosheets along the c-axis of the crystal. On the contrary, the first diffraction peaks of MoS2 and WS2 at 14.37° and 14.32° indicated a red-shift relative to the MWS sample, which was attributed to the larger interlayer spacing with the introduction of strain due to the intrusion of another species element (Mo/W) between the layered structure.16–18 In the case of MWSC and MWSR, there were not many significant changes, as the MWS peaks dominated over the characteristic peaks of the nanocarbons, which indicates that the purity of the samples is the same even after the addition of MWCNT and rGO.16–18 However, the overall crystallinity of these two composite materials were noted to be lower than that of pristine MWS, which might result in better electrical conductivity and rapid intercalation kinetics of the electrolytic ions during charge–discharge cycles. The broadening of the peaks for the nanohybrids was a clear sign of improved supercapacitive performance via enhanced charge transfer characteristics as well as superior capacitance and stability. Subsequently, the information acquired from XRD in terms of the crystal structure and molecular interaction was validated through Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 2b illustrates the Raman spectra of the three samples. The typical in-plane E12g and out of plane A1g vibrational phonon modes of the layered MWS were observed at 374.54 cm−1 and 403.08 cm−1, respectively. The aforementioned peaks resembled the prominent Raman peaks found for 2H MoS2; WS2 has a peak at 355 cm−1 associated with E2g, which may have merged with the phonon mode presented here.16–18,35 The composites also exhibited the above peaks with a blue shift, indicating a larger interlayer spacing attributed to the van der Waals force between the layered structure. This force could result in an increased force constant for the molecular vibration taking place in the composites. In addition, another two peaks were observed in the spectral range for the composites at 1344, 1578, and 1613 cm−1, which were assigned as the D, G, and D′ bands, respectively, which were contributed by the disordered sp2 carbon rings present in the nanocarbons. The degree of disorder/defect can be evaluated by the intensity ratio ID/IG for the graphitic system. MWSC and MWSR had ID/IG ratios of 1.02 and 1.08, which conveyed that MWSC had better graphitization than MWSR. Owing to the higher degree of defects, the MWSC electrodes could exhibit better conductivity and electrochemical properties.

Morphological and textural visualizations were obtained through FESEM characterization (Fig. 3) for the as-synthesized materials. Fig. 3a and b show the curvilinear nanosheets (thickness: ∼12 nm), which resemble nanopetals and later unified to form a spherical flower-like structure. This kind of morphology was observed throughout the surface. The incorporation of rGO into MWS resulted in the successful formation of nanopetals overlaying the rGO sheets, which acted as a template. In a few places, the rGO sheet was observable (Fig. 3c and d) but over the surface, it was covered by the undamaged integral morphology of MWS (Fig. S1a†). However, in the case of MWCNT, the flowers were well connected and intertangled with highly porous nanotubes (thickness: ∼10–30 nm, Fig. 3e and f) over the whole exterior plane, providing a seemly suitable pathway for ion transport. The consistent distribution and aggregation of MWCNTs was visibly evident over the whole surface (Fig. S1b†). In particular, these morphological and surface analyses substantiate the formation of nanohybrid heterostructures that can facilitate rapid ion intercalation/deintercalation between the flowers and furnish a large number of active sites for ion diffusion, leading to enhanced pseudocapacitive behaviour.36 Furthermore, the interaction of the nanocarbons and MWS was investigated through HRTEM characterization (Fig. 3g–i and S2†). Fig. 3g shows the HRTEM nanographs of MWSC, in which both the MWCNTs (tube length: ∼14 nm) and MWS (nanopetals combined to form dense nanoflowers) were clearly aggregated to form MWSC. The two different interlayer spacings indicated in Fig. 3h correspond to the MWCNTs and MWS. A similar trend was observed for the other nanocomposite, MWSR (Fig. S2†). Fig. 3i and S2c† display the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of MWSC and MWSR, respectively, which matched well with the d spacing observed from the XRD patterns. Overall, the HRTEM analysis validates the results obtained from XRD and FESEM, and the interaction and aggregation of the nanocarbons with MWS signifies better electrochemical activity owing to their porous structure.10,11,22,36

High-resolution XPS was employed to obtain a clear understanding of the binding energy and electronic state of the materials, as well as accurate atomic percentages. The survey spectrum provided in Fig. 4a indicates the presence of Mo 3d, W 4f, S 2p, C 1s, and O 1s peaks at the binding energies 229.5, 35.1, 161.5, 283.5, and 530.1 eV, respectively, for MWSC.36 Later, the Mo 3d peak was deconvoluted into two peaks positioned at 228.9 ± 0.2 and 229.7 ± 0.2 eV assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and a peak at 232.4 ± 0.2 eV corresponding to Mo 3d3/2, along with a S 2s peak at 226.38 ± 0.2 eV. The Mo 3d peak was assigned to the Mo4+ oxidation state (Fig. 4b). Fitting of the well-defined W 4f peak resolved it into two W 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks at 35.1 and 36.3 eV, respectively, clearly demonstrating the involvement of W4+ (Fig. 4c). The peaks at binding energies of 161.5 ± 0.2 and 162.04 ± 0.2 eV corresponded to the divalent S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 states of metal sulphide (S2− electronic state, Fig. 4d). The deconvolution of the single C 1s peak resolved it into three distinct peaks at 283.2 ± 0.2, 284.04 ± 0.2, and 284.58 ± 0.2 eV corresponding to CC, C–O, and CO, respectively (Fig. 4e). Moreover, the transition of d and f electrons in TMDC could play a vital role in the charge transfer kinetics. The atomic percentages of all the elements present in MWSC were calculated from the XPS data and are shown in Table ST1.†16–18,37 Surface area calculation and pore size allocation of the pristine and hybrid samples were carried out using BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) analysis, which is presented in Fig. S3.† From the type IV N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the materials, the surface area of each sample was calculated, along with the pore volume (Table ST2†). MWSC was ascertained to be highly porous with a greater pore diameter and higher surface area, which might account for better electrocatalytic properties.

3.2. Study of the electrochemical properties
MWS, MWSC, and MWSR were studied using a two-electrode Swagelok cell configuration obtain a viable potential window of 0–0.7 V, which was determined via optimization during CV. All the measurements were taken after making the system stable by applying 50–60 CV cycles at a 40 mV s−1 scan rate. The CV profiles of all samples were documented at various scan rates from 100 mV s−1 to 5 mV s−1, and the GCD curves were logged for varying current densities from 1 A g−1 to 0.2 A g−1 (Fig. 5a–f); the corresponding specific capacitances were calculated using the typical formula (EIS). The CV contours and GCD curves exhibited distinctive pseudocapacitive behaviour with no perceptible oxidation or reduction peaks. The peak current of the MWS samples incorporating MWCNT and rGO in the CV curves increased compared to that of the pristine material. The GCD curves showed a triangular shape, suggesting rapid surface faradaic reactions. Based on the GCD curves, MWSC attained the highest capacitance of 592 F g−1 (0.2 A g−1) (Fig. 5f), clearly outperforming the other two systems. MWS had a highest capacitance of 151 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 (Fig. 5b), whereas MWSR achieved a capacitance of 331 F g−1 (0.2 A g−1), which was much higher than that of MWS and lower than that of MWSC (Fig. 5d). The energy densities and power densities of the symmetric configuration were calculated using the equation given in the ESI Section.† Although the symmetric systems exhibited higher capacitance values, their energy density and power density values were noted to be in the moderate range. The highest energy density was found to be 10 W h kg−1 for MWSC at a power density of 183 W kg−1, and the energy densities for MWSR and MWS were 5 W h kg−1 and 2 W h kg−1 at corresponding power densities of 118 W kg−1 and 77 W kg−1, respectively, because of the smaller potential windows. A comparative study of all the synthesized electrodes is given in Fig. 6. The areas under the CV curves were greater for the MWSC and MWSR composites than for MWS (Fig. 6a). The GCD curves in Fig. 6b show the better charge storage performance of the composites.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy provides a great deal of valuable and insightful characteristics for supercapacitor devices. Therefore, EIS (Fig. 6c) was conducted over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at a potential of 5 mV s−1 to observe the electrochemical activity at the electrode–electrolyte interface (EEI), and the data was fitted with an equivalent circuit (Fig. 6c, inset image). In the Nyquist plot, the internal resistance (Rs: intercept value) is a result of the impedance perceived by the aqueous solution along with the device internal resistance, which is also referred to as the equivalent circuit resistance (RESR), and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) forms the semi-circle in the plot, which arises due to the electrochemical reactivity at the EEI. The quasi-linear behaviour observed beyond the semi-circle is triggered by side reactions and the charge relaxation process in the system. The respective charge transfer resistances and solution resistances of all the samples were determined from EIS (Table ST3†). MWSC possessed the lowest impedance compared to the other two electrodes, showing its greater conductivity for improved charge transfer kinetics. Reduced ion diffusion and the creation of a greater amount of electrochemical active sites in MWSC are observed from the steeper slope in the lower frequency region, which can be ascribed to the dynamic synergistic effect between MoWS2 and MWCNT, as the MWCNTs provided better pathways for the electrolytic ions to achieve reversibility compared to the other nanohybrids. On the other hand, MWSR had similar behaviour in its Nyquist plot, with slightly higher charge transfer resistance (Rct) and internal resistance (Rs) values. Although the synergistic effect between MoWS2 and rGO sheets provides better activity than that of the pristine material, it is regarded as the second-best material after MWSC, which may be attributed to two factors. Firstly, the synergistic effect in the case of MWSR is not as advantageous for the creation of sufficient electrochemical active sites as that in the case of MWSC, and secondly, the rGO sheets were not laminated and appeared in a clustered manner, restricting the charge transfer properties, leading to irreversibility of the ions. The stability of an electrochemical device is one of the important deciding parameters in terms of its functionality. MWS and the other nanohybrids were tested for 6000 consecutive charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 6d. The capacitance retention was estimated to be 79%, 85%, and 91% for MWS, MWSR, and MWSC, respectively. The successive charge–discharge cycles led to the trapping of the ions at the electrode and electrolyte interface, and pulverization of the layered structure also contributed to the poor stability of the pristine material compared to the composites. MWSC retained superior cycling stability and coulombic efficiency (around 96% at 10 A g−1) based on its nanocarbon, which acted as the conductive bridge for ion transport, eliminating the irreversibility as well as any severe structural damage. The intermediate cycling stability is also contributed by the nanocarbon existing in MWSR. Fig. 6e shows the change in the capacitance of the samples with respect to various current densities, which shows almost linear behaviour.
MWSC exhibited top-notch electrochemical properties owing to its high porosity, abundant active sites, suitable passage for ion movement, and high electrical conductivity. Its only shortcoming was that the energy density was on the lower side of the Ragone plot (graph between energy density and power density). The lower values of energy density and specific power density were remedied in an asymmetric configuration in which MWSC was used as the negative electrode and CoSe2@CNT@rGO (hereafter CSCR) was used as the positive electrode. CSCR was previously prepared and showed excellent charge storage performance, as described elsewhere.27 In a three-electrode set up, both the positive and negative electrodes were inspected and the respective optimised potential windows were analysed (Fig. S4†). After the charge balance was carried out by means of adjusting the mass loading (through eqn (1)), the asymmetric cell was used for measurements. A wide working potential window of 1.3 V was resolved for the asymmetric design of MWSC//CSCR, which is depicted in Fig. 7a. The energy storage performance is given in Fig. 7b and was recorded at various scan rates (5–100 mV s−1) through successive CV cycles. Slight electrolysis can be observed for the 5 mV s−1 scan rate due to the longer time of scanning under high voltage, leading to some chemical reactivity. However, for the other scan rates, the window behaved perfectly, which was convenient and persuasive. The hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited features of the pseudocapacitive type of electrochemical system. Its charge storage performance was elucidated from the GCD graphs presented in Fig. 7c. The capacitances computed from the GCD curves were 151 F g−1, 133 F g−1, 116 F g−1, 93 F g−1, and 74 F g−1 at respective current densities of 11 A g−1, 12 A g−1, 13 A g−1, 14 A g−1, and 15 A g−1. At a high current density (at 15 A g−1), the device exhibited a capacity of 74 F g−1, which is commendable. The linear behaviour of the specific capacitance vs. current density is given in Fig. S5a.† The EIS was recorded under similar constraints analogous to previous experiments (Fig. 7d). The low Rct (corresponding to the charging of the double layer in the porous structure) and Rs (internal resistance of the device) values of 12.36 Ω and 2.78 Ω, respectively, calculated for the asymmetric assembly supported the higher capacitance values obtained through GCD cycles in the 1.3 V potential window and evidently demonstrated the surface faradaic and non-faradic processes. The stability of the asymmetric supercapacitor was determined by carrying out 6000 charge–discharge cycles, and a noteworthy stability of 96% was achieved at a current density of 20 A g−1. The coulombic efficiency (ratio of discharge and charge time) was around 97% at the same current density; this is a crucial parameter for effective operation (Fig. 7e). The energy density and power density of the asymmetric device were evaluated to be 36 W h kg−1 and 14 kW kg−1 at a current density of 11 A g−1, and were compared with the existing literature regarding 2D TMDCs (Fig. 7f).4–11 The performance of an electrode with a higher mass loading was tested and can be found in the ESI Section;† we observed little change in the CV and GCD profiles, but the capacitance and energy density values decreased due to the higher mass loading and thickness of the electrode (Fig. S6†). The charge storage mechanism of the asymmetric supercapacitor was further dissected to determine a plausible process. The surface redox faradaic and non-faradic reactions lead to the ion adsorption/desorption of majority of the K+ and SO4− ions to the respective negative (MWSC) and positive (CSCR) electrodes, and the diffusion process was continued repeatedly, providing reversibility to the system (Fig. 8a). The charge transfer mechanism was divided into three processes/contributions, namely:

Further, the charge storage contribution was scrutinised using cyclic voltammogram curves to determine the diffusion-controlled (battery-type) and capacitive (supercapacitor-type) behaviour using the power law given below: i = aνb(6) logi = blogν + loga(7)where i is the current, ν stands for the scan rate, and a and b are modifiable parameters. The value of b can be either 0.5, 1 or 0.5–1 which respectively correspond to diffusion-controlled (based on Cortell's equation i = aν1/2), capacitive contribution, or a mixture of both, and can be calculated from the slope (logi vs. logν). Using Dunn's method, for each scan rate the contributions can be calculated in a quantitative way by means of the following equations: i(V) = k1 + k2ν1/2(8) i(V)/ν1/2 = k1ν1/2 + k2(9)where k1 and k2 signify the current contributions from the capacitive and diffusion-controlled portions and can be extracted from the slope and intercept values of the i(V)/ν1/2vs. ν1/2 graph. Fig. 8b shows that the diffusion-controlled and capacitive contributions at 40 mV s−1 were found to be 8.92% and 91.08%, respectively. A bar graph of these contributions at different scan rates was plotted, and revealed a trend of escalating capacitive contribution. Comparison tables were made to showcase the performance of the symmetric and asymmetric devices (Table ST4†) along with the volumetric capacitance of the electrodes (Table ST5†). Overall, the excellent charge and energy storage performance of the asymmetric device was proven to be outstanding and can be further used for device making.
For real-time application, a solid-state asymmetric device was designed using PVA–K2SO4 gel electrolyte, and the device was charged with a 1.9 V battery for several minutes. Subsequently, two devices were connected to a light emitting diode (LED, 5 mm diameter) which glowed for 4 minutes, demonstrating that it is a potential effective candidate for supercapacitor application in real time. The inset figure in Fig. 7f shows the glowing of the LED. Therefore, the combined virtues of better electrical conductivity, a barrier-free pathway for charge transfer, and the enhanced synergistic effect between MWCNT and MWS make this material a high energy/power density negatrode.
3.3. Electrocatalytic HER studies
The electrocatalytic activities of MWS, MWSR, and MWSC, along with that of commercial 20% Pt/C, were investigated using LSV measurements. All the samples were tested in 1 M H2SO4 at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1via dropcasting on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Fig. 9a shows the comparative LSV profiles for all the materials. Pt/C, MWSR, and MWSC achieved an overpotential of 43 mV, 175 mV, and 243 mV (RHE) at η10 (J = 10 mA cm−2). The onset potentials of MWSC and MWSR were found to be 73 mV and 102 mV (RHE), respectively. The catalytic activity of pristine MWS was determined to be on the lower side, but with the introduction of nanocarbons, there was a decrease in the overpotential, i.e., enhanced catalysis activity. The Tafel slope is another critical parameter that determines the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the Tafel slope was calculated for the two best materials, and MWSC (34 mV dec−1) attained a smaller Tafel slope than MWSR (48 mV dec−1) owing to its better charge kinetics. A comparison table was made using recent reports in the literature regarding HER performance (Table ST6†). The EIS (Fig. 9c) of the pristine and nanocarbon hybrids were recorded at different evolution potentials for the respective samples, and the Nyquist plots were explored by fitting the polarization curves using Randle's circuit (inset image of Fig. 9c). MWS, MWSR, and MWSC possessed a lower solution resistance of close to 2 Ω, and their contact resistances were 723 Ω, 248 Ω, and 117 Ω, respectively, which clearly signify the poor performance of MWS and the enhancement in MWSC owing to its low barrier resistance for water dissociation. The double layer capacitance (Cdl) and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) were further calculated, which showed that the catalysts MWSC (Cdl = 0.88 mF, ECSA = 25.14 cm2, Rf = 356.09) and MWSR (Cdl = 0.45 mF, ECSA = 12.85 cm2, Rf = 182.011) presented almost 1.5- and 3-fold increases in the Cdl and ECSA values as compared to the pristine MWS (Cdl = 0.29 mF, ECSA = 8.28 cm2, Rf = 117.28), indicating the extreme availability of active sites contributing to the higher HER performance (Fig. S7†). Further, the stability performance of MWSC was tested for 12 h, and there was barely any change in the graphical trend (Fig. 9d). Thus, with its high surface area, efficacious pathway for charge dynamics, adequate number of highly active sites, and lower contact resistance, MWSC comes out with flying colours for bifunctional electrochemical application.

4. Theoretical investigation and discussion
4.1. Quantum capacitance computation
DFT calculations were carried out for the validation of the supercapacitor measurements and the synergistic effect between the nanocarbon and MWS. First, the relaxed structures are illustrated in Fig. 10a–c for MWS, MWSR, and MWSC, respectively. Quantum capacitance is an essential aspect in the field of theoretical electrochemistry. The quantum capacitance can be defined as follows: (10)where dσ denotes the differential of charge density and dφ the local potential. If the electrochemical potential μ is shifted by the electrode potential eφ, where e is the electronic charge, then the excess charge density can be expressed as: (11)where D(E) and f(E) are the density of states and the Fermi–Dirac distribution, respectively, and E is the relative energy with respect to the Fermi level, EF.38–40 The quantum capacitance is therefore defined as: (12)where electrochemical potential μ is rigidly shifted by the eφ.40,41 The thermal broadening function FT(E) is expressed as (10): (13)where kB is Boltzmann's constant.
 Fig. 10  Optimized structures of the (a) pristine MWS, (b) MWSR, and (c) MWSC through DFT calculations. (d), (e), and (f) show the total density of states for MWS, MWSR, and MWSC, respectively; (g) and (h) represent the partial density of states for MWSR and MWSC, respectively. The scaling along the y-axis is different for MWS, MWSR, and MWSC in the cases of (d), (e), and (f). 
In pursuit of calculating the quantum capacitance, CQ, the density of states (DOS) of the various working compounds were analysed and are shown in Fig. 10d–f. As is clear from the aforementioned figure, the density of states at EF was the minimum in the case of MWS, while on the other hand, the MWSR and MWSC had large density of states peaks at the EF. To provide a clear comparison between MWSR and MWSC, their partial densities of states are demonstrated in Fig. 10g and h, respectively. From this figure, it is clear that the density of states at EF for MWSR and MWSC mainly arise from the C-p. In addition, the peak of the density of states for MWSC was larger in comparison with MWSR. Accompanying the density of states at the Fermi level, the quantum capacitance CQ was found to be maximum for the case of MWSC and minimum for the case of MWS.39,40 The calculated maximum quantum capacitances for MWS, MWSR, and MWSC from eqn (1)–(3) were found to be 45 μF cm−2, 272 μF cm−2, and 306 μF cm−2, respectively, within the working potential window at room temperature. The capacitance trend is analogous to the experimental observations, and the values are in good agreement with recent reports of similar systems.40–45
5. Conclusion
In summary, a bifunctional electrocatalyst/electrode was designed via the combination of a promising TMDC material, MoWS2, and nanocarbons (rGO and MWCNT). The diversity of MWSC and MWSR showed tremendous potential in the fields of not only energy storage, but also energy conversion. The as-fabricated symmetric and asymmetric devices showed excellent specific capacitances of 592 F g−1 and 151 F g−1 in potential windows of 0.7 V and 1.3 V, respectively. The electrochemical stability test also revealed capacitance retentions of 91% and 96% over 6000 successive charge–discharge cycles. The coulombic (97%) efficiency of the asymmetric device was also proven to be top-notch, with a high percentage contribution from capacitive behaviour. In addition, their HER performance should not be overlooked, with overpotentials of 175 mV (MWSC) and 243 mV (MWSR) and shallow Tafel slopes of 34 and 48 mV dec−1, respectively. The higher surface area, rapid surface redox faradaic and non-faradic reactivity, low resistance barrier for water dissociation, and well-connected passages for ion transport make MWSC a great candidate for energy storage and energy conversion applications. This effort to end the ever-increasing demand for energy by synthesizing these materials for high performance electrocatalysts and superior charge storage negative electrodes could be a game changer for pertinent real-time applications.
