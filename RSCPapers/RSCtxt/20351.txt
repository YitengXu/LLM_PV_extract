Introduction
Since our previous highlight article from 2011,1 tremendous worldwide activities on naphthalene and perylene diimide-based organic semiconductors have demonstrated the versatility of these compounds for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)2–4 and bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs).5 The development in the latter field has been particularly impressive because hitherto fullerenes had been the undisputed champions for almost two decades. For this reason, here we take the opportunity not only to give an update of the research on naphthalene and perylene diimides (NDIs, PDIs) which are the two smallest homologues of the class of rylene diimides,6 but in addition briefly compare them with fullerenes in the first section of this highlight article. In the following sections we will highlight those rylene diimides that had the highest impact on organic transistor research and on organic photovoltaics (OPV) during the last decade. At the end we will conclude with an outlook on those fields where we see new perspectives, i.e. in sensory devices and in photonic applications.
Comparison of rylene diimides and fullerenes
C60 and C70 fullerenes became the most dominant organic electron transport materials during the 1990s. The popularity of these molecules is likely due to two reasons. The first is the research enthusiasm of chemists and physicists following the discovery of C60 in 1985.7 This excitement was only amplified by a 1996 Nobel Prize for the discovery and the availability of fullerenes in large quantities following 1990.8 Since then, chemists have elaborated synthetic methods for fullerenes’ chemical functionalization and physicists have elucidated the fullerenes’ electronic properties. Here it was recognized that fullerenes are easier to reduce than other π-conjugated all-carbon structures, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, enabling their use for electron transport in n-channel organic transistors. This led to the second reason for the dominance of fullerenes as electron transport materials: fullerene-based n-channel organic semiconductors are particularly suitable for organic photovoltaics. This use of fullerenes was initiated by the work of Heeger and co-workers, who in 1996 demonstrated the use of two-component composite materials of conducting polymers and fullerenes9 to give so-called bulk heterojunction solar cells.10 For these applications it was beneficial that the parent and most easily available fullerene, C60, as well as the easily accessible more soluble derivative PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) have just the right energy levels to provide appreciable voltage upon combination with the most common semiconducting polymers such as MEH-PPV (poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]) and P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)). In addition, the two materials easily formed desirable morphologies bearing nano-sized fullerene and polymer domains for improved extraction of charges compared to hitherto investigated planar heterojunction device architectures.11
However, this success and the paradigmatic view that the desired phase separation of the electron-poor fullerenes and electron-rich organic semiconductors originates from their difference in shape (elongated flat and globular molecules prefer to separate because their mixture cannot pack into a thermodynamically favored high density solid) also restricted the research for novel organic photovoltaic materials. Thus, for many years up to the time of our previous highlight article1 most efforts in organic photovoltaics concentrated on the donor materials, based either on polymers or small molecules.12,13 Little activity was devoted to new n-type semiconductor molecules for OPV applications because the electronic properties of the fullerene π-scaffold was just perfect without any modifications and its unique globular shape was considered to be important for the required morphology of the active layer of OSCs. As well, C60 and C70 and their soluble derivatives PC61BM and PC71BM were already suitable and available compounds for either vacuum sublimation or solution processing, respectively.
In retrospect it would have been beneficial to consider alternative electron transport compounds at an earlier stage. Indeed, suitable candidates were available, e.g. perylene-based materials with their long history as organic electronics materials.14 This group of compounds includes perylene tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (PTCDA)15 and perylenetetracarboxylic bisbenzimidazole (PTCBI). The latter molecule was used by C. W. Tang as acceptor in his seminal work on planar heterojunction solar cells.11 Based on the molecular properties, i.e. ignoring the issue of packing (see below), perylene diimides and their derivatives are particularly appealing (Table 1 and Fig. 1).

The solar photon flux at AM 1.5 conditions is displayed in grey. (b) LUMO level range realized with NDI (1.49 eV) and PDI (1.26 eV) derivatives in comparison to the rather narrow range for the fullerenes (0.23 eV). The chemical structures of NDIs (orange) and PDIs (red) with substituents at the aromatic scaffold (X, Y, Z) and imide positions (R) with corresponding variations of the optical band gap. The definitions of X, Y, Z, and R are as well provided in Table 1. 
As shown in Table 1 the LUMO levels of the parent rylene chromophores NDI 1 and PDI 1 are indeed rather close to those of C60 and C70.16–18 Likewise, all these compounds form rather stable radical anions due to the delocalization of the charge over the extended π-scaffolds. Accordingly, from the electronic point of view these molecules should be equally suitable electron transport materials for applications in both n-channel transistors and bulk heterojunction solar cells. On the other hand, the optical properties of PDIs are advantageous compared to those of fullerenes (Fig. 1a).19 The latter are weak absorbers of visible light and rapidly relax into undesired triplet states.20 Conversely, PDIs are strong absorbers, afford long-lived excited singlet states and exhibit high photostability.6 These are all beneficial properties for light capture, exciton transport to the p/n heterojunction interface and long life-cycles of the materials. Several of the red, maroon and black pigments produced on an industrial scale are based on PDIs, illustrating their robustness.21 While NDIs are not as obvious candidates (the parent compound does not absorb in the visible range and is, like fullerenes, non-luminescent due to a rapid intersystem crossing),22,23 NDIs are very easy to derivatize into yellow, red or even blue dyes by the attachment of electron-donating substituents to the core.24 This last point illustrates indeed the most striking difference to fullerenes: the optical and electronic properties of fullerenes cannot be tuned over a significant range and the parent compounds might appear already as the best choice from the (opto-)electronic point of view. In contrast, both electronic (LUMO, HOMO) and optical properties (absorption, fluorescence) of PDIs and NDIs can be tailored over wide ranges.25–29Fig. 1b provides an update of our previous highlight articles1,30 with regard to the accessible LUMO levels for PDIs and NDIs. For a comprehensive discussion of the large number of recently synthesized electron-poor naphthalene and perylene diimides we refer to the recent review article of Mukhopadhyay.31 Here we would only like to point out that PDI 3, with its eight electron-withdrawing substituents, is so electron-poor that its reduced dianion complex with sodium could be isolated and stored under ambient conditions, and characterized by single crystal X-ray crystallography.32 In contrast, if electron-donating substituents are attached to the PDI core, both LUMO and HOMO levels are raised to give p-type rather than n-type organic semiconductors. This is illustrated for tetramethoxy-substituted PDI 533 and carbazolocarbazolo-NDI.34 According to this analysis all molecular properties, and in particular their tunability, suggests that NDIs and PDIs are more versatile electron transport materials than fullerenes. However, it was the specific globular shape of fullerenes that made them unique. The closest packing of these molecules always leads to three-dimensional percolation pathways and with this avoids trapping at defect sites. This yields superior n-type charge carrier mobilities as high as 11 cm2 V−1 s−1 in single crystal field-effect transistors (although only under nitrogen atmosphere).35 Further, in combination with flat π-scaffolds phase separation in donor and acceptor domains is almost guaranteed, making fullerenes a very robust component of bulk heterojunction materials.36 Accordingly, the risk for failure of the solar cell devices was low for composite materials based on fullerenes and newly designed organic semiconductors, as demonstrated by a huge number of reports both on small molecules12 and polymers.13 In contrast, NDI and PDI packing, as well as the interaction of these molecules with p-type semiconductors, is difficult to predict. Studies by our group and others, summarized in a recent review, give insights into packing control and its impact on functional properties of supramolecular aggregates.37 From this work it is obvious that the solid state properties of PDIs depend in a subtle way on the specific arrangement that either favors exciton transport, symmetry-breaking charge separation or intersystem crossing into triplet states.38 Albeit at first glance a problem, such versatility is highly useful to tune dye properties in a profound way.
Rylene diimides for organic transistors
In our previous highlight article from 2011, we gave an overview of the development of NDI and PDI based n-channel materials from the early reports of Dodabalapur, Horowitz and Katz in 1995/1996 (all with μ ∼ 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a lack of ambient stability).40,41 We sketched the first ambient stable NDI with fluorinated alkyl chains (–CH2C7F15)30,42 published in 2000 with μ = 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Finally, we demonstrated the already quite successful dicyano-substituted PDI 729 and dicyano-NDI43 developed at Northwestern University, a large variety of halogenated PDIs44,45 and NDIs (NDI 2)46 synthesised by our group, and core-extended rylenes PDI 847 and NDI 548,49 from Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICCAS) in Beijing (Fig. 2). This work demonstrated the power of molecular energy level engineering by electron-withdrawing substituents to lower the LUMO level (PDI 7, PDI 8, NDI 2), π-extension (PDI 8, NDI 5) and supramolecular packing control50 as well as the usefulness of perfluorinated alkyl chains (PDI 7, NDI 2) to repel water even at high humidity.44 Nevertheless, the pigment-like, in particular PDI-based, materials required processing by vacuum deposition due to their low solubility.

Devices with anisotropically aligned thin films processed from solution are marked as OFET*. 
It was therefore an important step when, in 2009, Facchetti and co-workers introduced NDI-bithiophene copolymer NDI 6a, processed from solution on both glass as well as flexible substrates, with n-channel mobility of 0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 3).51 Semi-fluorination of the solubilizing side chain in polymer NDI 6b pushed the OFET performance to 3.93 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.40 cm2 V−1 s−1 for spin-cast films and aligned thin films, respectively.52,53 The world record holder for ambient stable n-channel mobility (8.50 cm2 V−1 s−1) of a NDI-based polymer, NDI 7, was introduced by the groups of Chen and Liu in 2017.54

For these compounds long, and often branched, alkyl chains are required for solubility. Such measures are of less relevance for small-molecule-based NDI derivatives, which are by far more soluble than their higher PDI homologues. Here, two molecules proved to be particularly successful. The first, dichloro-substituted NDI 2 with an SCFET mobility in air of up to 8.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 originated from our collaborative research with BASF and the Bao group. The other, (1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)malononitrile-substituted NDI 5 came from Gao, Zhu and co-workers.48,49
Dichloro-substituted NDI 2 combines many desirable features. This compound could be processed in vacuum,46 from solution55,56 and even by sublimation in air57 to give ambient stable n-channel transistors with charge carrier mobilities of about 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, we could grow single crystals both from solution58 and by sublimation in air57 that showed record n-channel mobilities up to 8.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in single crystal field-effect transistors, respectively (SCFETs; Fig. 4).58,57
 Fig. 4  SCFET of α-phase single crystal grown from solution of dichloro-substituted NDI 2 on OTES-treated Si/SiO2 wafer in top-contact and bottom-gate configuration fabricated via the gold wire shadow mask method with ambient stable n-channel charge carrier mobility as high as 8.6 cm2 V−1 s−1. The scale bar equals 50 μm. 
The different mobilities could be attributed to the formation of different polymorphs and control of this polymorphism was subsequently reported for solution-processed thin films as well.59 Most recently, Frisbee and co-workers carried out temperature-dependent mobility measurements for dichloro-substituted NDI 2 single crystals in combination with Kelvin probe measurements to reveal that step edges on thicker crystals act as trap sites for electron transport. Because the number of step edges is by far larger for thick crystals compared to thin ones, the former show lower mobility, increased hysteresis and activated transport (hopping regime). The latter provided an n-channel mobility of up to 11 cm2 V−1 s−1 at a low temperature of 120 K and the characteristic features of a hysteresis-free band-like transport.60
Rylene diimides for organic photovoltaics
Whereas the most desired materials for organic transistors are generally transparent to visible light, making compounds such as dichloro-substituted NDI 2 particularly valuable, the very modest contribution of such materials to solar light absorption is disadvantageous for organic photovoltaic applications. Here compounds such as NDI-bithiophene polymer NDI 6a (deeply colored due to charge transfer from the electron-rich bithiophene to the electron-poor NDI) or PDI derivatives give a chance to achieve high performance of OSCs for reduced film thickness, as both donor and acceptor components contribute to the harvesting of solar light. This effect becomes most pronounced if the two components have their main absorption bands in different spectral ranges, ideally covering the whole visible and a significant part of the near-infrared spectrum (to about 1000 nm).
Nevertheless, for the above discussed reasons, including unfavorable packing arrangement, progress in the field of rylene-based acceptor materials was rather slow. After many years of research on PDI-based bulk heterojunction solar cells with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) below 2%, Narayan's PDI dimer PDI 9 together with a semiconducting polymer (PBDTTT-C-T) afforded for the first time PCEs around 3%.61,62 Afterwards a rapid development took place which culminated in a variety of PDI dimers and oligomers that afforded, in combination with appropriate semiconducting polymers, PCEs exceeding 10%.5,63Fig. 5 collects some of the best performing currently available compounds which come from the laboratories of Zhaohui Wang at ICCAS in Beijing (PDIs 10, PDIs 13),64–67 Colin Nuckolls at Columbia University (PDI 12),68 and He Yan at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (PDI 11, PDIs 14–16).69–72
 Fig. 5  PDI derivatives successfully used in bulk heterojunction solar cells in combination with electron-donating polymers. Reported PCE values for the best devices are given in parentheses. 
It is apparent that multi-PDI arrays surpass single-core PDIs in terms of PCE. Monomeric PDIs show high tendency towards aggregation,37 which results in the formation of micrometer-sized domains when blended with a donor. Since the exciton diffusion length is typically 5–20 nm, reduction of the domain size is a prerequisite to improve photovoltaic properties of PDI-based solar cells. Thus far, the record PCE value for a single-core PDI-based device does not exceed 5%.73 In line with the common design principle PDI-based acceptor materials feature π-core extended and twisted structures to suppress detrimental aggregation, decrease the domain size and assure efficient charge transport within the film (Table 2).

Following the early work by Narayan on N–N-linked PDIs, nonplanar structures could be achieved by simply linking two PDI moieties via a single C–C bond at either ortho or bay positions. A series of bay-linked PDIs 10 published by Wang illustrate how molecular engineering of the PDI-core can boost the PCE of PDI-based OSCs.65,66,74 The essential structural units in these molecules are heteroatom bridges incorporated into bay areas. Both sulfur and selenium increased the LUMO level when compared to the non-bay-bridged congener, assuring higher open-circuit voltage (VOC). Moreover, formation of the 5-membered rings entailed planarization and rigidification of the PDI core and resulted in a larger dihedral angle between two PBI units leading to favorable phase separation. Fine-tuning of the blend morphology was achieved by addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a processing additive to give PCE of >7% for a device comprised of the PDI 10-S acceptor and a wide-band-gap polymer, PDBT-T1.65 This is substantially higher than the value of the best device prepared with parent bis-perylene diimide PDI 10-2H (PCE = 5.9%).74,75 Replacement of sulfur with selenium increased PCE to >8% for PDI 10-Se-based devices.66
Instead of being directly linked with each other through a C–C single bond, two PDI units can be connected by an aromatic unit. The representative molecule of this class of compounds is spirobifluorene-bridged bis-perylene diimide PDI 11 reported by Gundogdu, Gao and Yan.69 This acceptor material, when complemented with P3TEA, yielded an OSC with an internal quantum efficiency of nearly 90%, a high VOC and a PCE of 9.5%. Good photovoltaic properties are attributed to (1) the ultrafast and efficient charge separation despite the very low driving force (defined as the offset between the bandgap of the donor/acceptor materials and the energy of charge transfer state), and (2) reduced non-radiative recombination.
Nuckolls and co-workers demonstrated a set of linear oligomeric PDI ribbons that proved to be attractive candidates for application in OSCs.68 The molecules were obtained upon fusing PDI cores with vinylene bridges. Consequently, these PDI oligomers are fully conjugated in contrast to compounds PDIs 9–11 and their molecular properties are affected. Due to the steric repulsion between neighboring PDI units, oligomer PDI 12 and its trimeric homologue are nonplanar and consist of isoenergetic waggling and/or helical conformations. Strong absorption in the visible wavelength range, efficient charge generation and transfer with concomitant high JSC, in addition to the formation of suitable nanometer-sized domains, account for excellent PCE of >8% achieved by a PDI 12:PTB7-Th-based OSC device.
Inspired by the fullerenes, research on PDI-based acceptor molecules for solar cells drifted naturally towards three-dimensional (3D) multichromophoric PDI arrays. 3D geometry was expected to reduce the tendency towards aggregation in order to achieve domains of appropriate size and facilitate isotropic charge transport as in fullerene solar cells. Following this idea, Wang and co-workers designed three-bladed highly twisted propeller dyes PDI 13-2H and PDI 13-Se in which PDI units were fully fused to a central benzene ring.67 Devices comprised of these molecules as acceptors and PDBT-T1 polymer as donor reached PCE values up to 9.3%. As in the case of C–C single bond-linked PDIs 10, integration of selenium into bay areas of PDI subunits enhanced PCE values. PDI 13-Se exhibited a more rigid and distorted framework as well as more compact 3D networks due to additional chalcogen Se–O intermolecular interactions, and higher mobility than PDI 13-2H. Further enhancement of PCE of PDI 13-2H could be achieved via alkyl chain engineering.76
Meanwhile, a number of 3D multi-PDI arrays have been published in which PDI units were linked with a central core by single bonds or fused to an aromatic unit. Several comparative studies of both types of molecules clearly showed that, apart from the suppression of aggregation, rigidity of the structure is of paramount importance for the operation of OSC devices. Too high flexibility of non-fused PDIs results in a higher degree of intermixing with the donor polymer. This impairs the domain purity and deteriorates photovoltaic parameters, in particular, fill factor (FF). This effect is clearly visible in structurally related PDI 14 and PDI 15 perylene diimide arrays reported by Yan.70,71 The presence of additional C–C bonds in the structure of PDI 15 (highlighted in red in Fig. 5) has a tremendous effect on photovoltaic properties of the solar cells. That is, a restriction of conformational freedom in PDI 15 resulted in a more defined molecular ordering and thus higher domain purity. This in turn doubled the blend electron mobilities, diminished bimolecular recombination and increased FF. Fusion was also beneficial for light-harvesting abilities owing to the enhanced absorption of PDI 15. Consequently, a solar cell based on PDI 15 reached a PCE of 10.6%.70
The same concept was used to design a polymer PDI acceptor material. The fusion of two perylene cores in naphthoperylenediimide-vinylene polymer72 afforded a decreased conformational disorder compared to a perylenediimide-vinylene polymeric acceptor.77 This structural modification allowed the achievement of a PCE value of 8.6% for the all-polymer solar cell (all-PSC) composed of polymer PDI 16 paired with PTB7-Th. Better photovoltaic performance of PDI 16 OSC is attributed to the enhanced and complementary absorption characteristics with the donor polymer as well as improved blend morphology and charge carrier mobility when compared to the conformationally more flexible PDI-vinylene polymer. It should be mentioned, though, that the latter material was less homogenous with regard to its chemical purity as it was prepared from the regioisomeric mixture of 1,7- and 1,6-dibromo-PDIs.78 This led to the polymers consisting of two types of repeating units which could in turn contribute to the poorer film morphology.
Recent years also saw development of all-PSCs using NDI polymer NDI 6a. While initial studies led only to low efficiencies (<1%),79 the polymer was recently shown by researchers from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in Guangzhou to be capable of achieving the highest PCEs among all-PSCs (>10%).80 The progress mainly originated from finding appropriate polymer donor materials to cover the spectral range and the realization of appropriate morphology.
In addition to the use of PDIs as acceptor component in the active layer of bulk heterojunction solar cells, recent work of Zengqi Xie and Yugang Ma, also working at SCUT in Guangzhou, with compounds developed in our laboratory demonstrated significant improvements of inverted polymer solar cells with PC71BM when electron-rich PDIs PDI 17 or PDI 18 (Fig. 6) were used either in their self-assembled state as interlayer materials81 or to photosensitize the ZnO interlayers.82,83 In particular the latter approach proved to be very convenient, enabling the deposition of thicker interlayers and providing devices with PCE up to 11%. More details on this concept are summarized in a recent feature article.84

Conclusions and outlook
In this article, we highlighted the recent achievements in the molecular design of rylene-diimide-based organic semiconductors. While excellent n-channel organic transistor materials based on PDIs were already available in 2011,1 both small molecule and polymeric NDI compounds have been developed more recently that have made a significant impact, in particular for printable devices.
Even more impressive was the progress for rylene-diimide-based compounds in organic photovoltaics where several derivatives successfully compete with fullerenes in blends with semiconducting polymers. Together with acceptor–donor–acceptor compounds, PDI oligomers invalidate the view of a uniqueness of globular fullerenes for the formation of the desired bulk heterojunction nano-morphology,5 and will be further optimized to reach peak performances.85 It is expected that in the following years even better NDI- and PDI-based acceptor molecules will be disclosed and afford, in combination with specifically tailored donor polymers, even better photovoltaic devices. This approach has recently been demonstrated80 with a spectacular improvement of the PCE for materials based on polymer NDI 6a, which had already been known for almost a decade. Further, absorption at longer wavelengths is a desirable feature to harvest NIR solar radiation. Towards this goal, larger systems, i.e. terrylene and quaterrylene diimides6 or even recently introduced tetra- or multi-imide polycyclic aromatics,86 might be promising candidates. Indeed, recently Zhaohui Wang reported the first examples of OSCs based on bis- and tris-terrylene diimides (λmax = 652 nm, εmax = 165.300 L mol−1 cm−1) which, however, have not yet achieved high performance (PCE = 3.6%).87
In addition, the usefulness of PDIs has been recognized for the photosensitization of inorganic photoconductors such as ZnO, wavelength-selective photodiodes,88 sensory devices,89 thermoelectric composites,90 batteries,91 and photonic applications.92 For many of these applications, the spectral sensitivity to specific wavelengths of the solar spectrum (including near UV or near IR) is of relevance. Thus, easy tunability of the absorption maxima by chemical derivatization, annulation to give fused dimers/oligomers, and control of the packing arrangement by supramolecular engineering (e.g. to give J-aggregates),38,93 provide a most desirable toolbox, encouraging our hope for another decade of exciting research on rylene diimide-based functional materials.
