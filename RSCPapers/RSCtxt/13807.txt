    , Accepted 12th May 2023First published on 19th May 2023AbstractPorphyrins and their derivatives have excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties, which have attracted great interest in the fields of catalysis, biosensing, gas storage, solar cells, biomedicine, etc. However, the inherent limitations, such as self-quenching, weak absorption at biological spectral windows and poor photochemical stability, severely hinder their applications in biomedicine, especially in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT). In recent years, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing attention as a class of hybrid porous coordination polymers assembled from metal ions/secondary building units (SBUs) and organic linkers. By introducing porphyrins into MOFs via the encapsulation in the pores as well as grafting on the surface to form porphyrin@MOFs or using porphyrins as organic linkers to construct porphyrin-MOFs, not only the unique properties of porphyrins and MOFs are combined, but also the limitations of porphyrins are overcome and their applications are facilitated in the biomedicine field. This article reviews important synthetic strategies of forming porphyrin-based MOFs (including porphyrin@MOFs and porphyrin-MOFs), which focuses on the recent research achievements and progress in PDT and tumor therapy fields. Furthermore, by carefully designing the composition of MOFs (such as the modification of organic linkers), MOFs could respond to the tumor microenvironment for on-demand treatment. In addition, some other strategies, including chemotherapy, photothermal therapy (PTT) and the latest cancer immunotherapy, are also combined in the review. Finally, the challenges and prospects in biomedical applications of this class of emerging materials are discussed.
Introduction
Porphyrins are a class of 18-π aromatic macromolecular compounds consisting of four pyrrole rings and meso- or bridge carbon atoms with different substituents.1 Porphyrins can also interact with different metal ions in the porphyrin center to form metal complexes which are known as metalloporphyrins.2 Porphyrins and their derivatives exhibit excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties due to their strong absorption in the UV-Vis region, which make them potential candidates in the fields of catalysis,3–5 sensing,6,7 gas separation,8,9 biomedicine materials,10,11 and have received extensive attention. More importantly, as the most studied photosensitizer, porphyrins exhibit a high singlet oxygen quantum yield and photochemical stability in biomedicine, and their fluorescent properties make porphyrin-based photosensitizers valuable fluorescent imaging-guided therapeutic systems (Fig. 1).12
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of synthesis and biomedical applications of porphyrin-based MOFs. 
So far, the PDT efficacy of porphyrin-based compounds has been relatively low, coupled with the relatively low solubility in aqueous media and easy aggregation, which can easily cause self-quenching and reduce the yield of singlet oxygen. These inherent shortcomings limit the application of porphyrins in biomedicine. Therefore, maximizing the dispersion of porphyrins is the key to achieve high-efficiency phototherapy. In order to solve the above problems, porphyrin-based MOFs and other organic ligands are good candidates for photosensitizers.13
As a kind of emerging porous crystalline material, MOFs are composed of metal ions or metal clusters combined with multi-coordinated organic ligands, which have received immense attention due to their ultra-high porosity, tunable pore size, tunable structure and composition, unsaturated metal centers and functional diversity.14 Furthermore, the particle size of MOFs can be easily reduced to the nanoscale, which is suitable for delivery systems. Compared with other types of carriers, nanoscale MOFs (NMOFs) show great potential as multifunctional nano-platforms for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, tumor therapy, bioimaging and biosensing.
As mentioned above, utilizing the structural advantages of MOFs to maximize the dispersion of porphyrin centers is an effective method to achieve highly efficient phototherapy. Integrating porphyrins into MOFs can create multifunctional carriers that can enhance the versatility of porphyrins and MOFs. From this perspective, porphyrin-based MOFs are ideal biomaterials to be further developed and utilized. Many efforts have been devoted to the development of diverse biomedical application platforms based on porphyrin-based MOFs. Loading porphyrins into the channels of MOFs or modifying porphyrins on the surface of MOFs is an efficient strategy to synthesize porphyrin@MOFs, which enhances the stability of porphyrins and facilitates their potential applications. Interestingly, porphyrins or metalloporphyrins can also serve as organic linkers to assemble porphyrin- or metalloporphyrin-MOFs, which can prevent porphyrins from self-aggregation and self-quenching, and improve their physicochemical properties. Due to the excellent properties of porphyrin-based MOFs, many research studies have been made in tumor therapy and biomedicine, and they have shown a great development prospect in the future.
In this review, various synthetic strategies and representative examples of porphyrin-based MOFs have been discussed, while also introducing their applications in response to the tumor microenvironment and combination therapy (Table 1). First, a series of typical porphyrin-based MOFs are introduced to find their application potential in the field of biomedicine. Second, the latest research achievements pertaining to porphyrin-based MOFs in various anti-tumor applications are discussed in order to find a promising strategy for future developments. Finally, in this review, the challenges and expectations regarding the utilization of porphyrin-based MOFs in tumor therapy are pointed out.

2. Synthesis of porphyrin-based MOFs
The structural advantages of MOFs make them suitable for applications in encapsulation or drug delivery.15 So far, a large number of MOFs, such as ZIFs,16,17 MILs18–20 and UiOs series21,22 have been scaled down to the nanometer level for biomedical applications. Currently, the main methods for synthesizing NMOFs include hydrothermal/solvothermal,23,24 sonochemical,25 mechanochemical,26,27 microwave-assisted synthesis28,29 and inverse microemulsion methods.30
Porphyrins can be connected to MOFs through two ways which give rise to porphyrin@MOFs and porphyrin-MOFs. Fig. 2 illustrates some organic ligands that have been used for porphyrin-based MOFs. Porphyrin@MOFs could be synthesized by one-pot synthesis of free porphyrin/metalloporphyrin and MOF precursors.31 During the synthesis, porphyrin/metalloporphyrin as guest molecules were incorporated into the cages of the pre-synthesized MOFs and then linked with central metal ions or organic ligands through host–guest reactions. Due to their special structures, porphyrin@MOFs can be combined with other therapeutic elements for PDT. The synthesis of porphyrin-MOFs involves the use of functionalized free porphyrins as an organic linking ligand to coordinate with metal ions/clusters to form MOFs.32 Using this method, porphyrin molecules can be more effectively incorporated into the MOFs with the advantage of large specific surface area in MOFs, which effectively prevents the self-quenching behavior of porphyrins by hindering their aggregation, and increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The characteristics of morphology, structure and composition in porphyrin-based MOFs endow them with great application potential in the biomedical field, and many efforts have been devoted to synthesizing porphyrin-based MOFs for meeting the requirements of biomedical applications.

2.1 Synthesis of porphyrin@MOFs
The synthesis of porphyrin@MOFs utilizes an encapsulation synthesis strategy in the mixed solution (guest and precursor of MOFs). The porphyrin@MOFs can be acquired by integrating porphyrins as guest molecules into MOFs via the encapsulation in the pores as well as adsorption or grafting on the surface. Due to the advantages of simple operation, time saving and low cost, the one-pot synthesis strategy has aroused the great interest of researchers and also opened up a new way for the practical application of MOF-encapsulated materials.
In 2016, Sun et al. synthesized porphyrin@UIO-66s using a one-pot method (Fig. 3(a)).33 The results showed that the synthesized porphyrin@UIO-66 maintained the crystal structure and morphology of UIO-66 (Fig. 3(b)), and through the incorporation of TCPP, a multifunctional MOF was obtained. In 2019, Luo et al. prepared laser-responsive drug delivery nanoparticles with a redox-responsive selenium (Se)-substituted polymer as the shell, photosensitive porphyrin-zirconium MOFs as the core, and loaded with the antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX).34 The designed nano-drug-loading system was oxidatively responsive. At the tumor site, the selenium (Se)-substituted polymer shell was cleaved, and then the MOF structure was awakened to generate ROS and simultaneously release the chemotherapeutic drug DOX in the MOF structure by specific illumination. The combination of chemotherapy and PDT was realized.

2.2. Synthesis of porphyrin-MOFs
Functionalized porphyrins can be used as organic linkers by coordinating with metal ions or SBU to form porphyrin-MOFs.35–37 Such porphyrin-MOFs have porphyrin functionality and have high porosity. SBUs are also known as metal clusters which can be formed through stable metal–oxygen bonds or metal–nitrogen bonds. This kind of structure plays a key role in increasing structural stability, generating more coordination sites, promoting frame extension, avoiding structural interpenetration and enlarging pores. Therefore, SBUs as a node can construct highly stable porphyrin-MOFs, which have attracted increasing attention due to their potential biomedical applications.
In 2021, Zheng et al. reported that TCPP derivatives were used as organic ligands to coordinately combine with divalent copper ions, and then DOX was incorporated into the system through a π–π stacking interaction in the polyvinylpyrrolidone solution. It was found that the loading of DOX was as high as 33%, and the synthesized DOX@Cu-TCPP MOF material with a layered structure had high antitumor activity and good biocompatibility (Fig. 4(a)).38 It provided a supporting basis for the application of porphyrin-MOF materials in the sustained release of drugs to improve the therapeutic efficiency, and a new idea for chemotherapy and PDT synergistic therapy.

So far, using porphyrin-MOFs has been regarded as an important way to improve the efficiency of tumor treatment, and the rational selection of porphyrins during the synthesis process plays a crucial role in regulating their pores, shape and size. Among them, meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) has been widely used to synthesize porphyrin-MOFs.39,40
3 Response of porphyrin-based MOFs to tumor microenvironment
Generally, the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment including low pH, hypoxia, high redox state, etc., which offer reliable avenues for the design of tumor-responsive drug delivery systems.41 The development of porphyrin-based MOFs combined with the nanotechnology and PDT could provide reliable theoretical support for nanocarriers that rely on lysosome endocytosis to enter cells. In this section, we focus on PDT based on porphyrin-based MOFs which are responsive to the tumor microenvironment and can be used in targeted therapy.
3.1 H2S response
Since H2S is a kind of important signal transduction molecule in living organisms, the H2S responsive MOFs have attracted great attention in recent years.42,43 Endogenous H2S is mainly synthesized through enzymatic reactions and participates in many physiological processes, such as antioxidantions, anti-inflammatory and apoptosis processes. In a specific tumor microenvironment, the content of H2S in tumor sites is higher than that in normal tissues and the content of H2S can be used as a marker for early diagnosis of tumors. The S2− dissociated from H2S can react with Cu2+ ions to form insoluble CuS precipitates, and the framework of the Cu porphyrin-based MOFs will collapse in the presence of H2S. Therefore, Cu porphyrin-based MOFs can be used to effectively detect the tumor site.
In 2017, in order to better understand the contribution of H2S in the process of tumor treatment, Ma et al. synthesized multivalent copper ion-coordinated zinc porphyrin MOFs, which both integrated monitoring and treatment functionalities into a single platform (Fig. 4(b)).44 In normal cells, the paramagnetic Cu2+ not only completely quenched the fluorescence of the ligands, but also minimized the generation of ROS from the photosensitive ligands (Fig. 4(c) and (d)). In specific tumor cells, the high concentration of H2S could react with Cu2+ and destroy the structure of the MOF, thus freeing the metalloporphyrin from the structure of the MOFs, which enabled the metalloporphyrin to simultaneously generate fluorescence and ROS ability. Therefore, H2S-responsive tumor-targeted therapy could be achieved (Fig. 4(e)).
3.2 GSH response
High GSH is a prominent feature of tumor cells, compared with normal cells, and cancer cells have a higher intracellular ROS concentration due to faster metabolism, which results in a higher oxidative stress.45,46 Therefore, intracellular GSH levels can not only serve as an endogenous signal to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, but also act as a stimulator to activate the ROS production capacity of photosensitizers in cancer cells. Disrupting intracellular redox homeostasis by increasing ROS production or reducing ROS consumption can effectively amplify the intracellular oxidative stress to enable effective tumor therapy.47,48
In 2017, Zhang et al. reported a nano-MOF{CuL-[AlOH]2}n (MOF-2) with copper(II) as the central ion and TCPP as the ligand (Fig. 4(f)).49 When MOF-2 entered cancer cells, Cu2+ could specifically bind to GSH and reduce the level of GSH in tumor cells. As the photosensitizer, MOF-2 could generate ROS under light excitation to achieve the effect of treating tumors. MOF-2 was readily taken up by breast cancer cells to produce a high concentration of ROS under light irradiation. Meanwhile, intracellular GSH was adsorbed by MOF-2, which synergistically increased ROS concentration, promoted apoptosis, and enhanced the effect of PDT.
In 2022, Xia et al. synthesized a redox-responsive MOF-nano-drug carrier, NicMOF@HA, in which nicorandil (NIC) was loaded into the pores of the porphyrin-MOFs, and the surface of the porphyrin-MOFs adsorbed hyaluronic acid (HA) through electrostatic interaction (Fig. 4(g)).50 When the nano-drug reached the tumor site, HA could be specifically recognized by the CD44 receptor overexpressed in tumor cells and played an active targeting role. At the same time, it also increased the accumulation of nano-drugs at the tumor site. After acidolysis by hyaluronidase, NIC in the pores of the MOFs was released. NIC can boost the PDT effect by donating nitric oxide (NO), which can react with superoxide anions to form highly reactive peroxynitrite (ONOO−) to reduce GSH content and increase the ROS at the tumor site. In addition, the porphyrin-MOFs converted the surrounding oxygen into ROS to kill the tumor and exhibited PDT functionality upon laser irradiation. Killing tumor cells using PDT coupling with targeting delivery of NO donors at tumor sites is a new field which shows prospects and potential in cancer treatment.
3.3 pH response
Compared with the pH of normal tissues and blood (7.4), the pH of most of the tumor extracellular environment is about 6.5–6.8, while the pH of lysosomes in cancer cells is as low as 5.0–6.0, which is the reason for the design of acid-responsive drug delivery systems. So far, different acid-responsive materials have been developed and applied in the specific diagnosis and treatment of tumors, and pH-sensitive porphyrin-based MOFs have been used to construct responsive drug carriers to act at the tumor site.51
Zhao et al. constructed a three-in-one porphyrin-based nano-MOF material containing pH-sensitive fluorescein isothiocyanate as a novel multi-channel MOF-based ratiometric nanosensor using a one-pot synthesis approach.52 The probe was sensitive to the acidic environment of the tumor and hypoxia, and due to the good biocompatibility of UIO-66, the nanoprobe can simultaneously image and quantify different acidities at the same location of living cancer cells, by which various sensing platforms were designed to analyze a variety of biosignals.
In 2021, Sun et al. used the one-pot method to construct a novel nano-MOF material, namely H-PMOF NPs (Fig. 5(a)).53 First, the prefabricated ZIF-8 NP template was dissolved into the acid solution, and the shell layer of zirconium-based porphyrin-MOFs was formed by the coordinate self-assembly of the TCPP ligand and Zr4+ ions, resulting in hollow spherical NPs composed of mesoporous MOF shells. Then DOX and indocyanine green (ICG) were packaged into the hollow shells for chemotherapy and PTT. Different from the non-hollow NMOFs, the hollow NMOFs had ultra-high loading capacity and unique physicochemical properties. At the tumor site, the hollow NMOF material has a high surface area, providing guidance for in vivo treatment with near infrared fluorescence imaging and PTT (Fig. 5(b) and (c)).

3.4 H2O2 response
As known, H2O2 concentrations can reach to 50–100 μM in cancer cells, which is higher than normal cells (<50 μM). Numerous studies have shown that H2O2 can be decomposed to produce O2 in the presence of catalysts such as catalase and manganese dioxide (MnO2).54,55 Therefore, this section mainly introduces the construction of porphyrin-based MOF materials that are responsive to tumor endogenous H2O2.
In 2019, Deng et al. synthesized MOFs with Hf4+ as a metal node using a simple solvothermal method and then an ultra-small and positively charged PMOF was obtained after ice bath and ultrasonic treatment. The encapsulated MnO2 was wrapped onto the surfaces of PMOFs to obtain multicomponent nanoplatforms (MMNPs) with the properties of H2O2-responsive antibacterial PDT (Fig. 5(d)).56 The material exhibited efficient biofilm penetration, autogenous oxygen production and enhanced photodynamic efficiency, which could efficiently destroy the bacterial membrane. In the inner side of the bacterial membrane, the acidic microenvironment (pH = 5.5) created by anaerobic glycolysis triggered the degradation of MnO2, and the release of ultra-small PMOF (5 nm) had much higher ROS production than the original PMOF. In addition, the positively charged PMOF dots could be strongly bound onto the negatively charged surface of bacterial cells to further promote the establishment of MMNPs. More importantly, the degradation of MnO2 by endogenous H2O2 and H+ could release O2 in the biofilm which reduced the hypoxic microenvironment and improved the efficiency of PDT. A functional adaptable nanoplatform with enhanced biofilm penetration and photodynamic efficiency could effectively destroy the bacterial membrane and could be successfully applied in the treatment of S. aureus-infected subcutaneous abscesses in vivo.
In 2021, Chen et al. prepared a peroxidase-like MIL-101(Fe) MOF containing the TCPP ligand to construct a PDT and CDT for synergistically inducing tumor cell death through the modes of cellular oxidative damage.57 In the tumor microenvironment, Fe2+ in MIL-101(Fe) MOFs experienced the photo-Fenton reaction with endogenous H2O2, and H2O2 was effectively converted into ˙OH which is harmful to the tumor. Furthermore, specific light-activated TCPP released 1O2 in the tumor tissue. The vitro experiments showed that MIL-101(Fe) MOFs had good biocompatibility and its therapeutic effect to kill tumor cells was as high as 91.3%, which is much higher than the efficacy of single CDT, and the animal experiments found no obvious cytotoxicity to normal cells.
4. Combination therapy
During PDT treatment, the photosensitizer absorbs the light energy to achieve an excited state, and then the energy transfers to the surrounding oxygen molecules (O2) to convert them into biotoxic 1O2 which could kill tumor cells.58,591O2 is one of the most critical factors in PDT and is directly related to the therapeutic effect, but the hypoxic tumor microenvironment limits its efficacy.60 Therefore, combining different therapeutic methods to achieve synergistic tumor therapy has attracted extensive attention. PDT combined with other treatments can not only overcome the shortcomings of monotherapy, but also reduce the side effects of the treatments, and greatly enhance the therapeutic effect.61–63
In PDT, reactive ROS, including singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anion radical (O2˙−), hydroxyl radical (˙OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are produced by photosensitizers under irradiation.64 According to the mechanism of ROS production, there are two main types of PDT processes. In the type I PDT, O2˙−, ˙OH or H2O2 is produced through a photoreaction based on electron transfer or hydrogen extraction. Alternatively, the PDT process may undergo the type II PDT photoresponse in which singlet oxygen is produced by an energy transfer mechanism.65 However, the conventional 1O2 dependent type II PDT would be less effective in the treatment of hypoxic tumors, and with oxygen depletion, the efficacy of type II PDT will be severely hampered by insufficient oxygen levels. In addition, emerging studies have shown that type I PDT has an advantage over type II PDT in tumor treatment due to its reduced dependence on oxygen, enabling PDT to actually operate in a hypoxic environment.66
4.1 Synergy of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy
Chemotherapy means that the cancer cells are killed by using chemotherapeutic drugs.67 At present, chemotherapy is still one of the most important means of cancer treatment. However, chemotherapy could produce serious drug resistance and chemotherapeutic drugs have high toxicity and side effects, thus chemotherapy alone is not well suitable for the effective treatment of tumors. PDT has a good killing effect on drug-resistant tumor cells and can enhance sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, which greatly improves the effect of cancer treatment.68,69
In 2017, Liu et al. synthesized a zirconium porphyrin MOF with good biocompatibility using a microemulsion method. Its adequate channels and pores were suitable for drug loading, and it had good inherent biocompatibility (Fig. 5(e)).70 Zirconium porphyrin MOF-loaded chemotherapeutic drug DOX had a drug loading capacity of 109%. Besides, the aggregation of porphyrin was avoided due to the structural advantages of MOFs, therefore, it could be used as a fluorescence imaging agent in vivo for fluorescence-directed therapy with a chemo-PDT dual system (Fig. 5(f)).
4.2 Synergy of photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy
PTT as a minimally invasive therapy can be triggered by near-infrared light which induces PTT conversion agents to convert light energy into heat energy for tumor ablation.71 Since PTT and PDT selectively irradiate the tumor site with the laser, it can greatly reduce the damage to other normal tissues and ensure the precise and effective tumor-specific killing effect to achieve the purpose of removing tumors and treating cancer.72–74
In 2018, Li et al. prepared an ultrathin 2D Cu-TCPP MOF nanosheet using the solvothermal method, which was the first reported material for imaging-guided phototherapy. The mechanism of action was the coexistence of Cu2+ and Cu+, resulting in strong infrared absorption under 808 nm laser irradiation to achieve a PTT effect (Fig. 6(a)).75 Moreover, the ROS generated by the Cu-TCPP MOF under light also inhibited the growth of tumor cells (Fig. 6(b)). In addition, the MOF also had T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging capability due to the unpaired 3d electrons of copper. The synthesized 2D nanosheet of the Cu-TCPP MOF successfully realized the integrated treatments of PTT and PDT.

In 2022, Zhang et al. developed a material for multimodal image-guided PDT–PTT combination therapy.76 A multifunctional porphyrin MOF was synthesized using TCPP and Mn-TCPP as mixed ligands and Zr4+ as metal nodes, which was used as a multifunctional matrix for multi-mode image-guided collaborative therapy. TCPP has fluorescence and PDT properties, while Mn-TCPP has fantastic T1-weighted MR imaging and PTT conversion properties. Besides, TCPP and Mn-TCPP have the same coordination capacity with Zr4+ ions, and the MOF with an adjustable ligand ratio could be easily obtained. In a word, the mixed-ligand MOFs could acquire the multifunctional tumor-targeted responsive and synergistic chemotherapy for clinical applications.
In 2021, Cai et al. designed and prepared Au@MOF core–shell hybrid materials using the layer-by-layer method and adjusted the thickness of the MOF shell by controlling the coordination reaction between layers.77 Among them, Au nanorods have strong absorption at 650 nm and mainly produce the PTT effect. Under light conditions, porphyrin ligands in the MOF shell can convert O2 into 1O2, resulting in a high PDT effect. In addition, the metal node Fe3O(OAc)6(H2O)3+ cluster of MOFs can catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 into O2, thus overcoming the hypoxic environment of the tumor and further improving the efficacy of PDT. The binding of porphyrin ligands in the MOF structure with Au nanorods promotes the synergistic effect of PDT/PTT and can effectively kill tumor cells and inhibit the growth of tumors. These studies prove that PDT combined with PTT has become a research hotspot in tumor therapy due to its non-invasive and has greater advantages in enhancing tumors’ therapy.
4.3 Synergy of chemodynamic therapy and photodynamic therapy
The concept of CDT was proposed by Bu et al. in 2016. In the CDT process, H2O2 was catalyzed by Fe2+ to generate ˙OH which possesses strong oxidative property to trigger apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth.78 In addition to the catalysis of Fe2+ ions, other transition metal ions (such as Mn2+, Ti3+, Co2+, Cu2+, etc.) can also undergo the Fenton-like reaction with endogenous H2O2 in cells to produce ˙OH and consume intracellular reduced GSH. The CDT is safe because the normal tissue cells do not have enough H2O2 to proceed with the Fenton reaction, causing almost no damage to normal cells.79,80
Tumor cells have a higher level of GSH, which acts as an antioxidant to hinder ROS from killing tumors. GSH is depleted by ˙OH produced by CDT, which enhances the effect of PDT.81–83 CDT does not rely on exogenous stimulation and energy input, and it further makes up for the unsatisfactory effect of PDT which can only treat superficial tumor sites due to the limited penetration of the light source.84–87
In 2020, Zhao et al. synthesized an iron(III) oxide-supported MOF (FeTCPP/Fe2O3 MOF) using a liquid-phase diffusion method. The iron(III) oxide could catalyze the Fenton reaction to generate ˙OH which could provide the oxygen needed for PDT (Fig. 6(c)).88 Under the light irradiation, the singlet oxygen produced by porphyrin could synergize with the photo-Fenton reaction to kill tumor cells (Fig. 6(d)). In addition, the camouflaged erythrocyte membrane could increase the residence time of photosensitizers in tumor cells and then modified the target molecule AS1411 aptamer to achieve high concentration of the MOF photosensitizer in the tumor area, enhancing the PDT effect while reducing side effects. As a result, the developed tumor-targeted FeTCPP/Fe2O3 MOF nanorice could achieve a high tumor therapy effect.
4.4 Synergy of immunotherapy and photodynamic therapy
Immunotherapy is one of the most cutting-edge areas of research in tumor treatment in the 21st century. Immune checkpoint therapy is a therapy that targets T cell regulatory pathways to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. It integrates diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice and has achieved good results. In 2013, Science recognized cancer immunotherapy as the most significant scientific breakthrough of the year, highlighting the potential of this therapy. The mechanism of immunotherapy is to block the immune checkpoint signal pathway to activate immune cells and enhance their cytotoxicity against tumor cells. The activated immune system can produce effector T cells to kill tumor cells, and at the same time, the memory T cells can continue to respond to tumor recurrence through immune responses. At present, immune checkpoint therapy has become a new anti-cancer method besides surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy.
The most important immune checkpoints targeted by clinical drugs are CTLA-4 and PD-1.89–91 However, a single immunotherapy has certain limitations, due to the low expression intensity of the corresponding antigen and immune resistance. At present, the main research focus of the immune checkpoint therapy is to explore the tumor biomarkers which can be combined with other anti-tumor therapies to enhance the efficacy.92–94
Studies have shown that PDT can not only induce tumor cells to undergo apoptosis and rupture in a short period of time, but also release a large number of tumor-associated antigens through this process, resulting in acute inflammatory responses, enhancing the immunogenicity of tumor-associated antigens, and activating the anti-tumor effects. T-cell cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can further induce tumor immunogenic cell death and stimulate a systemic anti-tumor immune response.90 Therefore, the combination of immunotherapy and PDT has a great potential to treat tumors.95–98
In 2022, Wang et al. constructed a heterostructure of NaLnF4 and zirconium-based porphyrin MOFs, where NaLnF4 could upconvert near-infrared light to ultraviolet/visible light (Fig. 7(a)) which overlapped well with the absorption of zirconium-based porphyrin MOFs, causing an effective energy transfer from NaLnF4 to the MOF shell to generate 1O2 (Fig. 7(b)).99 In addition, anti-programmed death ligand 1 (α-PD-L1) immunotherapy was synergistically introduced to improve the anti-tumor immune effect. The combined application of NaLnF4 and α-PD-L1 not only inhibited the primary tumors, but also inhibited the distant tumors, realizing an effective tumor inhibition rate of 95% (Fig. 7(c)). This work provided a promising nanoplatform for improving the efficacy of PDT and immunotherapy for tumor therapy.

4.5 Synergy of starvation therapy and photodynamic therapy
Starvation therapy is an emerging approach to inhibit tumor growth by cutting off the nutrient supply to cancer cells without external stimulation, and it has been considered as a promising clinical treatment.100–102 However, glucose blockade alone cannot completely block the tumor energy supply (such as adenosine triphosphate, ATP).103,104 Through the synergistic treatment with PDT, it has a targeted anti-cancer effect and minimal adverse reactions. It was found that glucose oxidase (GOX, one of the most commonly used biocatalysts) can regulate glucose metabolism and consumption to further inhibit ATP production. Many studies have demonstrated that the chemotherapy coupling with PDT can exhibit enhanced synergistic therapeutic effects in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.105–107
In 2017, Li et al. constructed a porphyrin-based Zr-MOF (PCN-224), which loaded GOX and catalase on the metalloporphyrin of PCN-224 using an electrostatic interaction method (Fig. 7(d)).108 Due to the biomimetic surface functionalization, the immune escape and homotypic targeting behavior of mem@catalase@GOx@PCN-224 (MCGP) would greatly enhance the tumor targeting and retention capabilities. Once internalized by cancer cells, MCGP was found to promote microenvironmental oxidation by oxygen generated by catalyzing endogenous H2O2, accelerate the breakdown of intracellular glucose, and increase the production of cytotoxic singlet oxygen under light irradiation. Therefore, MCGP showed the synergistic therapeutic effect of long-term cancer starvation treatment and powerful PDT, thus effectively inhibiting tumor growth after a single dose.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
In conclusion, the recent progress of porphyrin-based MOFs in PDT has been presented, which shows that the preparation of porphyrin-based MOFs can overcome the self-quenching, enhance chemical stability and optical properties of porphyrins in a physiological environment. Porphyrin-based MOFs have been used as excellent drug carriers due to their unique structures, high porosity and abundant modification sites. Taking advantage of the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, a series of porphyrin-based MOF materials have been designed to respond to the tumor environment. The porphyrin-based MOFs can also impart other functions by introducing functional molecules or nanoparticles to achieve better therapeutic performance and diagnostic activity of tumor therapy. In addition, the deficiency of single therapy can be compensated by synergistic therapy to achieve multimodal therapy within the same system, and combining PDT with other treatments (such as chemotherapy, PTT, CDT, immunotherapy, starvation therapy, etc.) can maximize the therapeutic effect.
PDT has become a popular trend in the field of tumor therapy due to the non-invasive, accurate and efficient characteristics, and the nanomaterials based on MOFs have shown unique advantages in the application of PDT. Due to the presence of a hypoxic environment in tumor cells, the self-oxygenated nanoplatform has a bright prospect for the development of PDT. Of course, the use of synergistic therapy in the treatment of tumors is expected to maximize the efficiency of treatment: the combination of PDT and hypoxic-induced chemotherapy provides a new way to utilize the hypoxic environment of tumors for effective cancer treatment; the combination of PDT and immunotherapy can cure both primary and metastatic tumors. Therefore, the combined treatment of PDT, hypoxia-induced chemotherapy and immunotherapy can become the main focus of cancer treatment in the future.
