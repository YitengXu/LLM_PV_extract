    , Accepted 2nd August 2016First published on 2nd August 2016AbstractIn this manuscript we introduced a novel conjugated polymeric additive PBTA-Py with benzodithiophene-alt-benzo[1,2,3]triazole as the backbone and polar pyridyl as the terminal group of the side chains. Relative to its polymeric counterpart that consists of the same main chain but a non-polar alkyl side chain, the resulting PBTA-Py exhibits quite comparable absorption and electrochemical properties and significantly improved surface energy. Of particular interest is that, by incorporating a certain amount of PBTA-Py as a polymeric additive into the bulk-heterojunction film of pristine polymer PBTA-BO and PC71BM, the power conversion efficiency was obviously enhanced from 4.96% to 6.48% primarily by virtue of the improved current density. The improved current density can be attributed to the slightly increased hole mobility as revealed by the space charge limited current model. Furthermore X-ray photoelectron spectra confirm the formation of the supramolecular interaction of the nitrogen atom with the electron-deficient PC71BM, leading to increased charge transfer in the bulk-heterojunction layer. These observations, in combination with the formation of more favorable phase separation morphology, demonstrate the great promise of developing polymeric additives for improving the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cell devices.
Introduction
Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much research attention from both industrial and academic communities owing to their particular advantages such as light weight, low cost, and great capability for the fabrication of large-area flexible solar panels.1,2 In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs, for which terrific power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been achieved based on both single-junction3–7 and tandem devices.8–10 These achievements primarily benefit from the combined breakthrough in highly efficient light-harvesting materials,11,12 preferable electrode interfacial materials,13–15 and advanced device architectures.16,17 Among the recently emerged light-harvesting π-conjugated polymers, wide-bandgap (WBG) polymers have attracted specific interest, since their relatively deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels can offer good ambient stability associated with high open-circuit voltage (VOC).18–21 More importantly, the absorption profiles of WBG polymers in the high-energy band are well-matched with those of narrow-bandgap conjugated polymer counterparts and non-fullerene acceptors, such that sunlight can be rationally utilized due to the complementary absorption profiles of these materials. These advantages offer versatile opportunities to construct high-performance multi-junction22–24 or fullerene-free PSCs.25–31
Among the most investigated WBG polymers, copolymers that consist of the weak electron-donating benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) units and the weak electron-withdrawing benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA) units as the backbones exhibit high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of about 6–7%.32–34 It is well-established that solvent additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) play a critical role in the optimization of BHJ film morphology and thereby the device performance.35 However, the utilization of such solvent additives might lead to unanticipated film morphology due to the unfavorable compatibility of such BDT–BTA-based conjugated polymers with fullerene derivatives (such as the [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, PC71BM), which may lead to inferior device performances. Another critical issue is that, in certain cases, the presence of a trace amount of such additive residues would be detrimental to device performance and long-term stability.36 Thus, it is of great interest to develop the non-volatile polymeric additives that can be used to optimize the film morphology of BHJ films.37,38 Such polymeric additives are supposed to be effective for improving the miscibility of conjugated polymers with acceptors, can promote the charge transfer at the donor/acceptor interface, and can simultaneously maintain the long-term stability.39,40 The modification of the side chain of conjugated polymers offers an effective strategy to construct such polymeric additives, since the incorporation of the aromatic moieties as the terminal groups can introduce a dipole at the polymer–fullerene interface, which can decrease the rate of bimolecular recombination and, therefore, improve charge collection across the active layer.38 Among various aromatic moieties, pyridyl is of particular interest since its lone pair electrons in the nitrogen atom may substantially coordinate with metal atoms in some metal-containing electron-donating materials41 or potentially form charge-transfer complexes with electron-deficient fullerene acceptors.42,43 In addition, the incorporation of a high polarity pyridyl moiety can change the film surface energy, thus leading to different phase separation when blending with fullerene derivatives.
In this manuscript, we introduce a polymeric additive, which is constructed by incorporating pyridyl groups into the side chain of a WBG conjugated polymer (PBTA-Py) that consists of the BDT–BTA backbone. The molecular structures of the proposed polymeric additive PBTA-Py and the pristine polymer PBTA-BO are shown in Fig. 1. Detailed studies reveal that the polymeric additive PBTA-Py has a pronounced influence on the surface energy relative to the pristine polymer PBTA-BO, and the PBTA-BO:PBTA-Py blend film shows an appropriate surface energy that is very analogous to that of PC71BM, which can improve the miscibility with PC71BM and thus lead to improved film morphology and device performance.44,45 Moreover, the formation of weak supramolecular interactions between the N-atom in the pyridine moiety and the electron-deficient PC71BM can influence the charge transfer between the electron-donating polymer and PC71BM.43,46 The combination of these factors leads to about 30% improvement in PCEs for the device that consists of a certain amount of PBTA-Py as the polymeric additive.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the monomers and the copolymers are depicted in Scheme 1. The intermediate compound 2-(6-bromohexyl)-5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (M1) is synthesized according to the reported procedures.47 The bromine atom on the side chain of M1 can be chemically modified through the thiol-bromo “click” reaction.48 The target monomer 2-(4-mercatopyridyl)-5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (M2) can be prepared by the reaction of M1 with 4-mercatopyridine in the presence of sodium tert-butoxide. The dibromo-monomer 2-(2-butyloctyl)-5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (M3) and a bis-stannyl monomer 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(2,3-dihexylthiophen-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (M4) are synthesized according to the reported procedures.32,49 The microwave assisted Stille polymerization of M2 and M3 with M4 in o-dichlorobenzene gives the target polymeric additive PBTA-Py and the pristine polymer PBTA-BO, respectively, in good yields over 80%.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy is employed to characterize the chemical structures of PBTA-Py and PBTA-BO (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Compared to the control copolymer PBTA-BO, one can observe the emergence of sharp peaks with chemical shifts of 7.05 ppm and 8.30 ppm for PBTA-Py. These new signals can be attributed to the methylene (Hd and He) in the ortho-position and the meta-position of the incorporated pyridine ring, respectively. In addition, the peak with a chemical shift of 2.89 ppm was obviously enhanced, which belongs to the methylene (Hc) adjacent to the sulfur atom. These observations confirm the accuracy of molecular structures of two such copolymers. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is used to estimate the molecular weights of these two copolymers with linear polystyrene as the standard and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of PBTA-Py and PBTA-BO were measured to be 8.4 kDa and 25.2 kDa, with polydispersity indices of 1.70 and 1.56, respectively. The much lower Mn of PBTA-Py than that of PBTA-BO can be ascribed to its poor solubility.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are employed to evaluate the thermal properties of PBTA-Py and PBTA-BO (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). In DSC measurements, no distinct glass transition temperature is discerned in both PBTA-Py and PBTA-BO characteristics from 35 to 250 °C (Fig. S2a in the ESI†). From Fig. S2b (ESI†), we note that PBTA-BO exhibits good thermal stability over 400 °C, while PBTA-Py shows a weight loss temperature at around 300 °C, which can be related to the removal of pyridyl moieties owing to the weaker bond energy of S–C than that of C–C.
Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PBTA-Py and PBTA-BO in chloroform solution and as neat films. PBTA-BO exhibited strong aggregations with a sharp shoulder peaked at 572 nm and 585 nm in solution and as thin film, respectively. In contrast, the PBTA-Py shows comparatively weak shoulders both in solution and film, indicating that the polar pyridyl units can hinder the aggregation of polymer chains. As estimated from the onset of thin film absorption, the optical bandgaps (Eoptg) for both copolymers are around 1.93 eV, indicating that the incorporated pyridine moieties in the side groups do not have a significant influence on the optical bandgap. The detailed optical parameters are listed in Table 1.

Fig. 2c shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) characteristics of PBTA-Py and PBTA-BO. The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are calculated from the equation: HOMO = −e[Eox + (4.80 − EFc/Fc+)] eV; LUMO = −e[Ered + (4.80 − EFc/Fc+)] eV; where Eox and Ered denote the onset of oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively. For PBTA-Py and PBTA-BO, the Eox/Ered are estimated to be 1.10/−1.52 V and 1.07/−1.56 V, respectively. EFc/Fc+ refers to the half-wave potential of the referred ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+), which is determined to be 0.39 V in this case. Therefore, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PBTA-Py and PBTA-BO are calculated to be −5.51/−2.89 eV and −5.48/−2.85 eV, respectively.
Photovoltaic performance
As shown in Fig. 1, BHJ solar cells with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PF3N-OX/photoactive layer/MoO3/Al were fabricated to investigate the effects of the polymeric additive PBTA-Py on the photovoltaic performances. Here a cross-linkable poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)hexyl)fluorene)] (PF3N-OX) is deposited on the top of the ZnO layer and then cross-linked to form the interfacial layer since it can effectively facilitate the charge extraction and device stability.50,51 Devices with the photoactive layer of pristine PBTA-BO:PC71BM (1:1.2), PBTA-BO:PC71BM:PBTA-Py (1:1.2:0.02 wt%) and PBTA-BO:PC71BM:pyridine (pyridine, Pyd) (1:1.2:0.5 vol%) are denoted as devices A, B and C, respectively. We keep similar film thickness of active layers for device A, device B, and device C with values of 95 ± 5 nm, 102 ± 3 nm, and 98 ± 3 nm, respectively. The J–V characteristics measured under 100 mW cm−2 air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination are shown in Fig. 3a and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are illustrated in Fig. 3b.

Our initial effort on the evaluation of the photovoltaic performances of these devices is devoted to the screening of the effect of different ratios of PBTA-Py. The weight ratio of the PBTA-BO:PC71BM blend is 1:1 for all devices. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of such devices with a weight ratio of PBTA-Py ranging from 0.001 wt% to 0.5 wt% are illustrated in Fig. S3a (ESI†) and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (see the ESI†). It is noted that the control device consisting of PBTA-BO:PC71BM (1:1) as the photoactive layer exhibits a moderate PCE of 4.92% with a VOC of 0.87 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 9.63 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 58.67%. The incorporation of PBTA-Py into the photoactive layer with the weight ratios of 0.001%, 0.02% and 0.5% leads to improved overall PCEs (see Table S1 in the ESI†), where the device consisting of 0.02% PBTA-Py exhibits the highest PCE of 5.74%. Further optimization of devices presents the ideal PBTA-BO:PC71BM ratio of 1:1.2 (Table 2), for which the champion PCE attains 6.48% (a VOC = 0.86 V, a JSC = 11.78 mA cm−2, and a FF = 63.66%) based on device B that consists of 0.02% PBTA-Py. This PCE is much higher than that of 4.96% (a VOC = 0.87 V, a JSC = 9.77 mA cm−2, and a FF = 58.39%) as obtained from the control device A. In contrast, devices without PF3N-OX as the interfacial layer exhibit much lower photovoltaic performances (see Fig. S7 and Table S5 in the ESI†). This observation can be attributed to the lack of hole-blocking properties of the PF3N-OX layer, which has a relatively deep HOMO energy level that can create an energy barrier for hole extraction in the cathode.51 On the other hand, we use MoO3, which has a deep HOMO energy level, to modify the work function of the Al anode to achieve good hole extraction ability.

It is also worth pointing out that despite the fact that the PCE can be obviously improved upon the incorporation of PBTA-Py, the attained PCE of 6.48% is not as high as the reported high performance polymer systems that can yield high PCE over 10%. Nevertheless, this strategy offers an interesting and alternative strategy to improve the photovoltaic performances of conjugated polymers based on the BDT-alt-BTA backbone. For comparison, we measured the photovoltaic performance of solar cell devices incorporating a small amount of pyridine solvent (Pyd) as the solvent additive with a volume ratio in the range of 0.2–1.0% (see Table S2 in the ESI†). It is realized that the device performances are gradually decreased upon the incorporation of Pyd into the PBTA-BO:PC71BM (1:1.2) photoactive layer. We note that the low boiling-point solvent pyridine is essentially very volatile, which evaporates rapidly during the spin-coating process that might not offer enough time for the organization of the polymer backbone to give optimized film morphology. These observations indicate that the pyridine solvent is not appropriate for application as the solvent additive for processing such a BHJ layer. Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of these devices. The EQE of device B is much higher than that of device A and device C across the overall response region from 300 nm to about 700 nm, where the maximum EQE attains 72% at the wavelength of 538 nm. The current densities integrated from the EQE spectra are consistent with those obtained from the J–V measurements.
The photo-stability of bulk-heterojunction PSCs is an important aspect toward the future commercialization. To evaluate the effects of incorporation of the polymer additive PBTA-Py into the photo-stability of devices, we fabricated BHJ devices with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PF3N-OX/active layer/MoO3/Al. The photovoltaic performance of devices with the photoactive layer of PBTA-BO:PC71BM (1:1.2) and PBTA-BO:PC71BM:PBTA-Py (1:1.2:0.02%) were measured under continuous illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 from 0 to 18 h in air. It is noted that after illumination of 18 h, the PCE of the device based on PBTA-BO:PC71BM (1:1.2) is maintained at 79.7% relative to the initial value, while the PCE of the device based on PBTA-BO:PC71BM:PBTA-Py (1:1.2:0.02%) is maintained at 86.9% with respect to the initial value. This observation indicates that both devices exhibit good photo-stability, while the device that consists of a polymer additive of PBTA-Py is more stable. Detailed results are illustrated in Fig. S6 and Table S4 (see the ESI†).
Hole mobility
Relative to the control device A, the obviously improved PCE of device B that consists of 0.02 wt% PBTA-Py mainly originates from the markedly increased JSC, while the decreased PCE of device C that is based on 0.5 vol% Pyd as the solvent additive can be attributed to the reduced JSC. The variation in JSC is supposed to be correlated with the enhanced vertical charge transport in such devices.52 To address this issue, we measured the hole mobility of PBTA-BO:PC71BM (1:1.2), PBTA-BO:PC71BM:PBTA-Py (1:1.2:0.02 wt%), and PBTA-BO:PC71BM:Pyd (1:1.2:0.5 vol%) based on the hole-only device. The structure of the hole-only device is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/MoO3/Al. The hole mobility of the copolymer is obtained from the slope of the fitted line in the space-charge limited current (SCLC) region of J1/2–V curves (Fig. 4). It is noted that the BHJ film that consists of 0.02% PBTA-Py exhibited a hole mobility (μhole) of 7.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much higher than that obtained from the blend film of PBTA-BO:PC71BM (μhole = 5.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and outperforms that of PBTA-BO:PC71BM processed with 0.5 vol% Pyd (μhole = 8.76 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) (see Table 2). This observation agrees with the obviously increased JSC of device B and decreased JSC of device C with respect to control device A.
 Fig. 4  SCLC mobility of hole-only devices based on blend films of PBTA-BO:PC71BM (1:1.2), PBTA-BO:PC71BM:PBTA-Py (1:1.2:0.02 wt%), and PBTA-BO:PC71BM:Pyd (1:1.2:0.2 vol%). 
Charge transfer
Considering that the polar moieties would introduce a dipole at the interface of the polymer and PC71BM, it is rational to surmise that the charge transfer in the interfaces can be substantially promoted.53 To address this assumption, we calculated the dipole moment of the pyridyl moiety on the side-chain-terminal of PBTA-Py based on the Gaussian 09 basis set (B3LYP/6-31G*).38 For reference, the dipole moment of the 2-butyloctyl (BO) group on the side chain of PBTA-BO is also calculated. It is noted that the pyridyl moiety exhibits a high dipole moment of 2.66 Debye, which is much higher than that of 0.036 Debye for the BO alkyl side chain (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†), indicating high polarity of the pyridyl moiety. These findings agree with the discerned higher JSC of devices consisting of a small amount of the polymeric additive of PBTA-Py.
It has been reported that the lone pair electrons in the pyridine unit can form weak supramolecular interactions with electron-deficient chemicals such as PC71BM,42 and the formed charge-transfer complex may render charge transfer preferentially from PBTA-Py to PC71BM, which can promote charge transfer at the D–A interface and in turn lead to improved photovoltaic performance. To clarify this issue, we examined the pristine polymer and blend films deposited atop indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Fig. 5 illustrates the N1s peaks of the pure polymer PBTA-BO and PBTA-Py films, and the blend films of PBTA-BO:PC71BM (1:1.2), PBTA-Py:PC71BM (1:1.2), and PBTA-BO:PC71BM:PBTA-Py (1:1.2:0.02%) films. It is noted that the intense N1s peaks located at 399.8 eV and 401.9 eV in PBTA-BO pristine film, which can be correlated with the cyclic conjugated CN–N and NN–N in the BTA ring, respectively.54 The PBTA-BO:PC71BM blend film exhibited a new peak at 402.4 eV, which can be attributed to the interaction between the nitrogen atom on the BTA ring and PC71BM. In addition to the characteristic peaks CN–N (399.8 eV) and NN–N (401.9 eV) of the BTA ring, the pure PBTA-Py film exhibits a new peak located at about 398.5 eV that can be correlated with the CN–C in the side pyridine ring. Moreover, one can note that both the pristine PBTA-Py film and the PBTA-Py:PC71BM (1:1.2) blend film show a weak shoulder peak at 402.6 eV, which may be ascribed to the intermolecular charge-transfer interaction between the side pyridyl group and the fluorine atom on another polymer chain owing to the higher electronegativity of fluorine than that of nitrogen. In contrast, one also observes two new emerged signals located at 402.3 eV and 402.8 eV for PBTA-Py:PC71BM (1:1.2) blend film. The former can be attributed to the interaction between the BTA ring and PC71BM, while the latter is supposed to derive from the charge-transfer supramolecular interaction between the pyridyl ring and PC71BM.55 From the XPS of PBTA-BO:PC71BM:PBTA-Py (1:1.2:0.02%), we can also observe the obvious N1s peak at 402.8 eV, indicating the existence of a charge-transfer complex despite the fact that only a trace amount of PBTA-Py is added to the PBTA-BO:PC71BM blend film. These observations confirm the formation of the complex, which would potentially lead to improved charge transfer and therefore the enhanced current density of devices consisting of polymeric additives.

Moreover, we fabricated the bilayer devices to further understand the reinforcement of charge transfer and improvement of JSC. The bilayer devices were processed with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor/PC71BM/Ca/Al, where the donor is represented as PBTA-BO (device I), PBTA-BO:0.02% PBTA-Py (device II), or PBTA-Py (device III). The photovoltaic performance of these bilayer devices was measured under 100 mW cm−2 air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination, with J–V characteristics shown in Fig. S5 and relevant parameters listed in Table S3 (see the ESI†). It is noted that device I shows a relative low JSC of 1.26 mA cm−2 while that of device III is nearly doubled as 2.51 mA cm−2, indicating the formation of a dipole in device III that can lead to more efficient charge transfer at the PBTA-Py/PC71BM interface. When 0.02 wt% PBTA-Py was added to the donor layer of PBTA-BO, the JSC of device II was improved to 1.41 mA cm−2 compared to that of device I, further confirming that a tiny amount of PBTA-Py can lead to the enhancement of interfacial exciton dissociation as a result of the formed charge-transfer complex.
Surface energy
Considering that the surface energy of copolymers can have pronounced effects on the miscibility with PC71BM and thus the film morphology,56 we measured the surface energy of copolymer films by contact angle experiments. Deionized water and diiodomethane (oil) were selected as the wetting liquid, and the surface energy is evaluated by the automated analysis of contact angles based on the Owens methodology.57 The relevant images are shown in Fig. 6 and the parameters are summarized in Table 3. We note that the surface energy of PBTA-BO (28.55 mN m−1) is much lower than that of PC71BM (34.3 mN m−1).45 In contrast, PBTA-Py exhibits much lower contact angles of both water and oil than PBTA-BO, leading to a very high surface energy of 46.83 mN m−1. By blending 0.02 wt% PBTA-Py with PBTA-BO, the blend film shows an appropriate surface energy of 34.78 mN m−1 that is very analogous to that of PC71BM. In this regard, it is rational to anticipate a better miscibility of PBTA-BO/0.02 wt% PBTA-Py blends with PC71BM, which can reduce the aggregation of both PBTA-BO and PC71BM, and thus give a uniform film morphology with favorable domain size.58

Film morphology
To verify the better miscibility and thus the uniform morphology induced by the incorporation of such a polymeric additive of PBTA-Py, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements are carried out. Fig. 7 shows the relevant images. From the blend film of PBTA-BO:PC71BM (Fig. 7a), one can clearly observe granular aggregates with sizes of about 80 nm across the entire film. The film has a moderate root mean square (RMS) value of 1.70 nm. In contrast, the blend film that consists of the polymeric additive of PBTA-Py (0.02 wt%) exhibits a more uniform morphology with much smaller aggregates (Fig. 7b), demonstrating smoother film morphology with a much smaller RMS value of 1.04 nm. For PBTA-Py:PC71BM blend film (Fig. 7c), we can note sparse and large aggregates in spite of a smooth surface (RMS = 0.70 nm).
 Fig. 7  AFM height images (2 × 2 μm2) and TEM images of PBTA-BO:PC71BM (1:1.2) film (a and d), PBTA-BO:PC71BM:PBTA-Py (1:1.2:0.02 wt%) film (b and e), and PBTA-Py:PC71BM (1:1.2) film (c and f). 
TEM measurements are carried out to inspect the effects of the incorporated PBTA-Py on the phase separation of the BHJ films. As shown in Fig. 7d, the pristine PBTA-BO:PC71BM blend film exhibits slim fibrillar structures with obscure granular aggregations, while an interpenetrating fibrillar network is observed across the entire blend film of PBTA-BO:PC71BM consisting of 0.02 wt% PBTA-Py (Fig. 7e). The formation interpenetration fibrillar network is favorable for charge carrier transportation, agreeing with the fact that the device based on BHJ film consisting of PBTA-Py exhibits higher current density. These observations indicate that the incorporation of a certain amount of PBTA-Py can effectively modify film morphology, and the charge carrier transportation can be improved upon incorporating PBTA-Py, thereby leading to the obviously enhanced current densities. In contrast, the PBTA-Py:PC71BM blend film shows a severe phase separation with a feature size over 500 nm (Fig. 7f), which is consistent with the AFM image (Fig. 7c). These results may be due to the much higher surface energy of PBTA-Py (46.83 mN m−1) than that of PC71BM (34.3 mN m−1), which leads to inferior compatibility of PBTA-Py with PC71BM.
Conclusion
In summary, a novel conjugated polymeric additive PBTA-Py with a benzodithiophene-alt-benzo[1,2,3]triazole main chain and a polar pyridyl side-chain-terminal group was synthesized. The resulting PBTA-Py exhibits much higher surface energy than the pristine polymer PBTA-BO that consists of the same main chain. By blending a small amount of PBTA-Py with PBTA-BO, the PBTA-BO:PBTA-Py blend film shows an appropriate surface energy that is very analogous to that of PC71BM, leading to the better miscibility of the polymer and PC71BM. Moreover, the electron-rich pyridyl moieties experience supramolecular interaction between pyridyl and PC71BM, resulting in the improved charge transfer at the donor:acceptor interface. Of particular interest is that by incorporating a certain amount of the PBTA-Py into the blend film of PBTA-BO:PC71BM, the power conversion efficiency can be improved from 4.96% to 6.48%. Such obviously improved PCE can be correlated with the appreciably enhanced current density and fill factor, which can be correlated with the enhanced hole mobility and improved charge transfer. These results demonstrate that the incorporation of polymeric additives with tailored side-chains can be a promising strategy to improve the device performance of polymer solar cells.
