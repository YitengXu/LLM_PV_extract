    , Accepted 30th November 2021First published on 30th November 2021AbstractThe interfacial charge transfer (CT) that plays an important role in enhancing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has not always been fully explored. Here, a TiO2@N719@Ag DSSC system was constructed, and the CT processes have been monitored by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra. Meanwhile, it is well known that as one of the most common external stimuli, high pressure can increase the free carrier density of TiO2 NPs and cause the band gap to narrow. In the high pressure SERS experiment, we observed a significant enhancement of the N719 dye in the TiO2@N719@Ag system up to 2.48 GPa, which is consistent with the variation trend of the charge transfer degree (ρCT). It is indicated that band gap changes will strongly affect the CT processes, further influence the SERS signal intensity (or ρCT), and thus increase the CT probability of DSSCs. Furthermore, the decoration of Ag NPs in the TiO2@N719@Ag DSSC system can introduce localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), enhance the light trapping ability and offer additional CT pathways. Importantly, it is possible to improve the photoelectric conversion performance of DSSCs via the high pressure method and the introduction of Ag NPs. Finally, in order to observe the CT process of DSSCs more clearly, the models describing the CT mechanism have been proposed. SERS spectroscopy is expected to be a promising technique for the exploration of the interfacial CT behavior in DSSC devices, which may further broaden the thoughts of improvement of efficiency of the cells.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention in the alternative energy field over the past twenty years1–4 because of their low manufacturing costs, simple fabrication, and high energy conversion efficiencies. The photoanode of DSSCs consists of a mesoporous n-type semiconductor film, such as TiO2, which is used to absorb a photosensitive dye. So far, the most widely studied injection system is the (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2-(NCS)2] (N719) complex centered on the ruthenium metal, which has strong local absorption in the visible region of 300–800 nm and can collect a large amount of solar radiation for photoelectric conversion.5,6 The N719 molecule can be effectively adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface via a carboxylic acid functional group to conduct the electronic transmission between the dye-donor track and the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor.7,8 The mechanism of DSSCs is that the optically excited state of the dye injects electrons into the CB of the semiconductor.9 Accordingly, an ideal DSSC device should have excellent light capture performance and favourable energy level coupling to achieve effective charge transfer (CT).
It is well known that a higher photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs can be achieved by trapping more light in the absorption area via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The SPR effect refers to the light-induced collective oscillation of free electrons on the surface of metal nanoparticles such as Au or Ag NPs. Ag NPs introduced into the semiconductor@dye system can increase the light absorption of the dye and accelerate the carrier separation.10 Moreover, the presence of Ag NPs also provides an additional CT path where electrons can be transferred from the dye to the Ag NPs and improves the degree of CT (ρCT). Therefore, the dual effects of metal NPs are used to greatly improve the efficiency of DSSCs.11
The interface plays the key role to control the photoelectric performance of DSSCs, which involves several vital interface processes such as charge generation, separation, recombination, and transfer.12 Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy has become a powerful tool for studying surface and interface problems.13,14 Because of the ultra-sensitive characteristics, SERS can accurately analyse the CT process in the semiconductor@molecular system through the unique vibration fingerprint information of the compound.15,16 Many research studies have indicated that electromagnetic enhancement (EM) and chemical enhancement (CM) are the two main mechanisms of SERS enhancement.17,18 EM is attributed to the local electromagnetic field generated by the collective oscillation of surface plasmons from noble metal (such as Au, Ag, and Cu) nanoparticles and the enhancement factor (EF) can reach 108.19–21 The CM contribution based on the CT is associated with the interaction between adsorbates and SERS substrates with an enhancement factor (EF) on the order of 101–103.22,23 Therefore, SERS spectroscopy has distinct advantages in the studies of interface CT of DSSCs, because CT is one of the main mechanisms for SERS enhancement. In our previous study,24 we have investigated the CT processes of the DSSCs of the ZnO–TiO2/N3/Ag system using SERS. It is believed that the SERS effect of semiconductor materials is due to the photo-induced charge transfer (PICT) transition.25 Semiconductors have a band gap between a full valence band and an empty conduction band, and the CT between semiconductors and molecules depends on the vibronic coupling, excited state and ground state of molecules.26,27 However, how to adjust the energy band structure of semiconductors to achieve more efficient CT is a problem that needs to be solved urgently.
It has been found that the size, morphology, phase structure, and doping of semiconductor materials have an impact on the chemical or physical properties of the photoanode of DSSCs. In turn, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs can be improved.28–31 Furthermore, as one of the most common external stimuli, high pressure has also been widely used to adjust the electronic energy band structure of materials and the interaction between atoms and molecules. Compared with the former, the experimental operation of the latter will be simpler.32,33 Recent research has mainly focused on improving the efficiency of such cells.34,35 Nevertheless, the main theoretical basis for enhancing the performance of DSSCs, that is, the CT process, has not yet been fully explored. Changing the pressure of the SERS system is not only beneficial for adjusting the electronic structure of the material and the interaction inside the DSSC system, but also helpful to understand the corresponding CT mechanism. Fu et al.36 found that high pressure would tune the hot spot of Ag NPs, affect its LSPR characteristics and then influence the SERS signal of the system. When single-layer graphene is used as the SERS substrate, a similar CT phenomenon is also observed.37,38 The first experimental demonstration of SERS under high pressure has been performed to characterize the molecular monolayer adsorbed on the semiconductor (TiO2 NPs) surface by our group.39 The interaction mechanism between probe molecules and the SERS substrate, which has been widely studied under ambient pressure, may become more complicated under a high pressure environment. Nowadays, the unknown characteristics of the CT process in systems containing a dye, semiconductor, and noble metal require a deeper understanding to optimize the performance of DSSCs, which provides ample research space for future exploration.
Herein, the TiO2@N719@Ag DSSC system was constructed using Ag NPs prepared by the classic Lee's method and TiO2 NPs synthesized by the hydrothermal method, and the high pressure induction experiment of the system was explored by the SERS method. In order to carry out quantitative research on the CT process, the semiconductor@dye@noble-metal system TiO2@N719@Ag was analyzed with reference to the ρCT concept. Ag NPs introduced into the system can provide additional SPR contribution and enhance the optical absorption, which can be confirmed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) analysis. In this study, we have concentrated on the changes of Raman intensity and ρCT in the SERS spectra of the N719 dye to investigate the CT process. As the pressure was increased up to 2.48 GPa, the SERS peak intensity (1544 cm−1) and ρCT of N719 reached maxima. At this moment, the high pressure tuned the free carrier density and affected the electronic band structure of TiO2, causing its band gap to shrink to 3.248 eV. The energy required for the PICT was decreasing, so the CT probability from this process was increasing. Meanwhile, the presence of Ag NPs also provided an additional CT path, which was more conducive to the exploration of the CT process. In brief, according to the SERS spectrum of the N719 molecule in the TiO2@N719@Ag system, the correctness that the high pressure can induce semiconductor carrier density to change was further verified, and we have expanded the thinking of the study of CT in the DSSC system under high pressure.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals
(Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2-(NCS)2](Bu4N = tetrabutylammonium and dcbpy = dicarboxylbipyridine) (N719) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. All other chemicals were acquired from the Beijing Chemical Reagent Factory and used without further purification. Distilled and deionized water from a Milli-Q-plus system with resistivity >18.0 MΩ was used in aqueous solutions.
2.2. Instruments
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Siemens D5005 X-ray powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 30 mA. TEM images were taken using a JEM-2100F high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200.0 kV. The UV-Vis spectra of TiO2 were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer.
Raman spectra were obtained using a Horiba-Jobin Yvon LabRAM ARAMIS system with a resolution of ca. 4 cm−1. Radiation wavelengths of 633 nm from an air-cooled HeNe narrow bandwidth laser and 785 nm from a semiconductor diode laser were used as the excitation sources. The 532 nm wavelength test data were measured with a Renishaw 1000 system. Data acquisition was the result of two times of 10 s accumulation for the N719 molecules adsorbed on TiO2 NPs at ambient temperature and pressure; moreover, Raman spectra of the system under high pressure were acquired upon two 60 s accumulation steps using the Renishaw 1000 system, and the laser excitation wavelength used was 514 nm.
2.3. Preparation of TiO2 NPs
TiO2 NPs were prepared using a sol-hydrothermal process.40 First, a mixed solution of 15 mL of tetrabutyl titanate and 15 mL of anhydrous ethanol was added dropwise into another mixed solution consisting of 60 mL of anhydrous ethanol, 15 mL of water, and 3 mL of 70% nitric acid, at 23–28 °C under rough stirring to carry out hydrolysis. Subsequently, a yellowish transparent sol was obtained by continuous stirring for 2 h. The as-prepared sol was maintained at 160 °C for 6 h in a stainless-steel vessel and then cooled to room temperature. The sol-hydrothermal product was dried at 80 °C for 6 h. Finally, TiO2 NPs were obtained by calcining the TiO2 sol-hydrothermal product for 2 h at 500 °C.
2.4. Preparation of Ag NPs
Ag NPs were prepared using the classic method of Lee;41 in other words, the reduction of silver nitrate by sodium citrate was used to prepare Ag NPs. The process was as follows: 200 mL of a 1.0 mM aqueous silver nitrate solution was added to 250 mL three-neck bottles and then heated to 85 °C with rapid stirring under reflux. A 4 mL solution of 1% trisodium citrate was added to the solution, after which it was boiled for 40 min.
2.5. Preparation of the TiO2@N719 system
TiO2 nanocrystals surface-modified by N719 were obtained as follows: 5 mg of TiO2 nanocrystals was dispersed in 2 mL of N719 (1 × 10−3 M) ethanol solution, and the mixture was stirred for 12 h. Then, the precipitate was centrifuged and rinsed with an ethanol solution once more. Finally, after drying, TiO2 NPs modified by an N719 molecular monolayer were obtained.
2.6. Preparation of the TiO2@N719@Ag system
The prepared TiO2@N719 nanoparticles were mixed with 1 mL of silver sol and 1 mL of ethanol and stirred at room temperature for 6 h. Then, the precipitate was centrifuged and rinsed with the ethanol solution once more. Finally, after drying, TiO2@N719@Ag nanoparticles were obtained.
2.7. Preparation for high-pressure experiments
High-pressure SERS experiments were carried out in a diamond anvil cell (DAC). A 50 μm-thick T301 stainless steel gasket with a 100 μm diameter hole was used to load the samples between diamonds having 300 μm culets. Liquid nitrogen was used as the pressure transmitting medium (PTM) to enable hydrostatic conditions. The pressures were measured using the ruby fluorescence technique.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Basic characterization of TiO2
XRD measurements were carried out for TiO2 NPs to characterize their crystal structure and particle size, and the result is shown in Fig. 1a. According to the standard PDF card of TiO2 NPs (JCPDS file no. 21-1276), the XRD peak at 27.4° is attributed to the rutile phase, as shown by the asterisk in Fig. 1a.42 The size of the TiO2 crystallites can be approximated using the Debye–Scherrer equation: D = kλ/(βcosθ), which determines the length of a crystalline domain in a specific crystallographic direction.43 In the equation, D is the average crystallite size obtained in angstroms (Å), k is the shape factor taken as 0.89, λ is the wavelength of X-ray radiation (Cu Kα = 1.5406 Å), β is the half-width of the (110) peak and θ is the diffraction angle. Thus, the particle size of TiO2 NPs is approximately 12.1 nm.

Fig. 1b shows the Raman spectrum of TiO2 NPs. Raman peaks at 397, 515, and 639 cm−1 are attributed to the phonon vibration modes of B1g, A1g, and Eg, respectively.44 The results in Fig. 1 confirm that TiO2 NPs have been synthesized successfully.

Fig. 2a–c shows the TEM images of TiO2 NPs, the TiO2@N719@Ag system and Ag NPs, which use the same scale label. The TEM image of TiO2 NPs displays their quasi-spherical morphology with an average diameter of ∼13.2 nm (Fig. 2a), which is basically consistent with the XRD calculation results. Ag NPs are uniformly spherical, with a particle size of about 60 nm (Fig. 2c). Meanwhile, for the obtained TiO2@N719@Ag composite (Fig. 2b), Ag NPs are decorated onto the surface of TiO2 NPs.

Fig. 3 shows UV-Vis absorption spectra of the TiO2 NPs, pure N719, TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag system. Pure N719 has strong absorption in the entire visible area. After the adsorption of the N719 dye on the TiO2 NPs, they have a strong absorption peak in the visible region, which proves that the N719 molecule enlarged the light response range of the TiO2@N719 system. Meanwhile, the SPR of Ag NPs was located at 418 nm, which is shown in Fig. S1.† After further assembling Ag NPs into the TiO2@N719 system, the absorption of TiO2@N719@Ag is remarkably enhanced because of the SPR effect of the Ag NPs, which testifies that the introduction of Ag NPs once again improves the light trapping ability. The light absorption efficiency of the system has been greatly improved, laying a foundation for increasing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs.

Investigation of the electrical properties of these structures was carried out by incorporating them as photoanodes in DSSCs. Both the cells were sensitized with the N719 dye and the I–V plots of the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems are shown in Fig. S2(a).† Note that the major difference in the I–V curves (Fig. S2(a)†) lies in the difference in their V values, which is attributed to the SPR absorption of the Ag NPs, leading to enhanced light harvesting. In order to further understand the charge transport and charge recombination characteristics, measurements of the impedance spectra (Fig. S2(b)†) were carried out. The figure showed that the impedance of the TiO2@N719@Ag system is smaller, indicating that the introduction of Ag NPs improved effectiveness on the retardation of charge recombination.
Fig. S3† shows a UV-Vis absorption spectrum and a schematic diagram of the band gap of TiO2 NPs. The intense absorption edge observed below 388 nm is associated with the band–band transition of the TiO2 NPs according to their intrinsic band gap energy of 3.28 eV.45 The tailing in the range of 380–450 nm corresponding to the optical absorption of TiO2 NPs is related to the surface defect state. The reason for its formation is the surface defect produced during the calcination process, namely the surface oxygen vacancy.46
3.2. SERS of the TiO2@N719 and the TiO2@N719@Ag DSSC system
In order to preliminarily examine the SERS enhancement performance of the TiO2 NPs, we collected SERS spectra of N719 in the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems and pure N719 molecule, as shown in Fig. 4. Based on the previous literature research,47 the peak positions of the obtained spectra are assigned, as shown in Table S1.† According to Fig. 4c, the existence of the νs(COO–) (1365 cm−1) vibration peak indicates that COO– and COOH still exist in the TiO2@N719@Ag system, and it can be determined that the N719 molecules are adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 NPs through carboxyl groups (–COO–), which is also demonstrated by previous work.47 The intensity of the bands at 1473 and 1538 cm−1 in the SERS spectra of the TiO2@N719@Ag system increases in different degrees compared with the bulk Raman of N719. The bands at 1473 and 1538 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching modes of CN and CC that are connected with the carboxylate group in the bipyridine. Moreover, according to Fig. 4, when Ag NPs are added to the TiO2@N719 system, the CN stretching vibration peak located at 2096 cm−1 (N719) or 2114 cm−1 (TiO2@N719), which belongs to the thiocyanate group, has an obvious blue shift, shifting to 2146 cm−1. It can be seen from the literature48 that the resonance enhancement effect does not contribute to the enhancement of the peak, so the change of ν(CN) (SCN) is due to the chemical interaction between Ag NPs and thiocyanide. For this reason, the N719 dye is expected to adsorb on the surface of Ag NPs via the S terminal in the SCN group.
 Fig. 4  (a) The Raman spectrum of N719 powder and (b and c) SERS spectra of N719 in the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems, respectively, measured using 532 nm excitation. 
In addition, upon comparison of Fig. 4b and c, it is found that after the introduction of Ag NPs into the TiO2@N719 system, the overall intensity of its SERS spectrum is significantly enhanced, since Ag NPs can provide additional SPR contribution, enhance the optical absorption of the system and improve the SERS signal. Furthermore, the presence of Ag NPs also provides an additional CT pathway, further enhancing the SERS intensity.
3.3. High pressure induces tuning of the free carrier density of the TiO2@N719@Ag DSSC system
To explore the effect of high pressure on the CT process of the DSSC system, we measured the pressure-dependent SERS spectra of N719 molecules decorated on the TiO2@N719@Ag and TiO2@N719 systems and pure N719 molecules under 514 nm laser excitation, as shown in Fig. 5(a–c). It is noted that there is no phase transition of TiO2 NPs over the experimental pressure range. Fig. S4† shows the Raman spectra of TiO2 NPs under compression. At ∼20.75 GPa, a few abnormal Raman peaks appear between 215 and 299 cm−1. These peaks should be from baddeleyite-like TiO2 with the space group symmetry of P21/c, showing that TiO2 begins to undergo a phase transition.49

(d) Raman frequency (1544 cm−1) as a function of pressure for the N719, TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems upon compression. (e) Plots of the intensity of the Raman active band at 1544 cm−1. (f) The variation of ρCT on TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems upon compression. 
In Fig. 5, all of the Raman peaks show a blue-shift with increasing pressure, and this is the most common phenomenon for pressure-dependent spectral measurements.50–52 The reason is that high pressure shortens N719 molecular bond lengths, and the force constants and frequencies of the corresponding peaks increase.53,54 The Raman spectrum of N719 solid powder under high pressure is shown in Fig. 5c. Of note in Fig. 5c is that the intensity of the Raman peak at 1544 cm−1 increases as the pressure increases up to about 3.59 GPa, and then it decreases. The possible factor is that the molecular orientation of N719 changes during the pressurization process. When a pressure below 3.59 GPa is applied, the molecular orientation of N719 tends to be consistent as the pressure increases, which leads to its Raman signal being stronger. During the next stage, the excessive pressure can cause orientation disorder, and the intensity of the Raman peak decreases.
Interestingly, clear differences of the corresponding Raman modes between pure N719 molecules and N719 in the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems can be observed in the high pressure evolution, as shown in Fig. 5d. The pressure coefficients for the 1544 cm−1 peak from the N719 molecules in sequence are ∼4.58, ∼3.68 and ∼3.71 cm−1 GPa−1. For pure N719 molecules, the intermolecular interaction is mainly weak van der Waals forces. Comparing with the pure N719 molecules, the formation of Ag–S covalent bonds in the TiO2@N719@Ag system and N719 molecules is adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 NPs through carboxyl groups (–COO–), which are not prone to compression.47 Therefore, the increase rate of 1544 cm−1 for pure N719 molecules is faster than for those on the SERS substrates. Meanwhile, Fig. 5d shows a comparison of the pressure-dependent variations in the peak position for the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems. Fig. 5d shows that the pressure coefficients of the two systems are almost the same, with only minor differences. This reveals that the further introduction of Ag NPs into the TiO2@N719 system does not significantly affect the compression rules of the N719 dye.
The results of decompression experiments for the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems below 13.75 GPa are shown in Fig. S5(a and c).† Fig. S5(b and d)† plots frequencies of the bands at 1544 cm−1versus the pressure upon compression and decompression of (b) the TiO2@N719@Ag system and (d) the TiO2@N719 system. It can be seen from Fig. S5(b and d)† that the peak positions of the 1544 cm−1 band of TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag are blue-shifted when the pressure is increased, and the peak positions are red-shifted when the pressure is relieved; that is, the peak shifts are reversible in the process of pressure cycles. Moreover, of note is that peak shifts are approximately linear with the pressure. This proves that the material structure and molecular structure of the systems are not significantly damaged within the range of pressure changes.
Furthermore, it is noted from Fig. 5e that the SERS peak intensity at 1544 cm−1 of the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems increases as the pressure increases, reaching the maximum at pressures of 1.37 and 2.48 GPa, respectively, and then, it decreases gradually with the increase in the pressure. The SERS intensity of the latter is significantly higher than that of the former. The reason is that Ag NPs introduced into the TiO2@N719 system provides additional SPR contribution, enhancing the optical absorption of the system and increasing the SERS signal. The presence of Ag NPs also yields additional CT pathways (N719 to Ag and Ag to TiO2), further improving the SERS intensity. At the same time, the presence of Ag NPs also makes the CT processes of the two systems different; that is, the effects of pressure are not completely the same. Hence, the pressure that gives the strongest SERS signal is also different (Fig. 5e).
In accordance with the introduction, the SERS performance of the semiconductor-enhanced substrates is mainly derived from the CT enhancement mechanism. Therefore, in order to quantitatively analyze the contribution of CT to SERS in the TiO2@N719@Ag system, we calculated the charge transfer degree (ρCT). The concept of ρCT was first proposed by Lombardi,22,55 and its calculation formula is as follows: (1)
Herein, k is an index used to identify individual molecular lines in the Raman spectrum. Ik(CT) and Ik(SPR) refer to the enhancement contribution of CT and SPR to SERS, respectively. I0(SPR) represents the SERS contribution of SPR to a Raman intensity of the totally symmetric vibration mode. Usually, Ik (SPR) is very small or zero when the CT vibrations are non-totally symmetric. For this formula, there may be the following situations: if the (k) mode is a non-totally symmetrical vibration, then Ik(SPR) ≈ 0 and when the (k) mode represents a totally symmetrical vibration, Ik(SPR) = I0(SPR). When the calculated values of ρCT are 0, 0.5, and 1, the meanings are as follows; only SPR contributes to SERS (ρCT = 0), the contribution from CT and SPR in SERS enhancement is equal (ρCT = 0.5), and CT occupies an absolutely dominant position in SERS enhancement (ρCT = 1).

Fig. 6(a) shows the SERS spectra of the TiO2@N719@Ag system measured using 532, 633 and 785 nm excitation wavelengths and Fig. 6(b) depicts the calculation results of ρCT. For the three excitation lines, one band which we selected to calculate ρCT is the band due to the ring breathing vibration at 1024 cm−1, which is enhanced with the whole spectrum. Another band is the band derived from the ν(CN) (bpy) + ν(C–C) internal-ring (bpy) vibration mode (1266 cm−1), which is strongly susceptible to the CT process caused by adsorption and SERS effects, as reported by Pérez Leóń's group.56 Therefore, formula (1) can be converted into the following equation: (2)
 Fig. 6  (a) The SERS spectra of N719 in the TiO2@N719@Ag system measured using 532, 633 and 785 nm excitation. (b) ρCT for the three excitation lines. 
Analyzing the results in Fig. 6b, it can be seen that the quantitative analysis of CT degree in the TiO2@N719@Ag system by ρCT is feasible, and it also provides an analysis method for exploring pressure-induced free carrier density changes of TiO2 NPs using SERS based on the CT process.
In order to compare the effect of pressure on the CT between the two systems more intuitively, we calculated the ρCT of the two systems according to eqn (2), as shown in Fig. 5f. For the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems, the calculated ρCT values are all higher than 0.5 within the studied pressure range, indicating that the SERS enhancement in the two systems mainly comes from the contribution of CT. When the system pressure is 1.37 and 2.48 GPa, respectively, the ρCT of the two DSSC systems has a maximum value, indicating that the CT probability is better at this moment. Meanwhile, the introduction of Ag NPs into the system not only enhances the SERS signal (or ρCT), but also promises research under a relatively higher pressure.
3.4. CT mechanism of the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag DSSC systems under high pressure
The CT mechanism of the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag DSSC systems under high pressure is investigated using SERS. The two DSSC systems have different SERS enhancement mechanisms, and the CT process is also different, resulting in differences in their SERS spectra. Compared with the TiO2@N719 system, the TiO2@N719@Ag system, in addition to the additional SPR contribution provided by Ag NPs, is mainly due to the difference in CT contribution. In order to better understand the impact of high pressure on the CT process of the two systems, we propose the CT model of the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems under a high pressure environment. It has been reported that the VB and CB of TiO2 NPs are at −6.83 and −3.63 eV, respectively, and the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of N719 are at −5.6 and −3.00 eV, respectively, while the Fermi energy level of Ag NPs is at −4.84 eV.39,47,57 In the molecule@substrate SERS system, the direction of CT can be from the substrate to the molecule or from the molecule to the substrate, which mainly depends on the relative position of the energy band structure.57,58 In the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems, N719 is used as a probe and is more likely to be used as an electron donor because of the extremely active optical properties.59,60
In the TiO2@N719 system, as shown in Fig. 7a, combined with the 2.41 eV energy provided by the 514 nm laser, the sources of the CT mainly include the following three types: (I) the electrons are excited from the HOMO energy level of N719 to the CB of TiO2 (μPICT); (II) the electrons excited to the CB of TiO2 are further excited by light to the LUMO energy level of N719 (μPICT); and (III) the molecular resonance enhancement occurs when the electrons at the HOMO level of N719 are transferred to the LUMO level by photoresonance (μmol). In addition, the CT process where the electrons are transferred from the VB of TiO2 to the LUMO level of N719 cannot take place, because the process requires 3.83 eV of energy, while the 514 nm laser can only provide 2.41 eV and cannot meet its energy requirements. According to the reports,61 high pressure can tune the free carrier density of TiO2 NPs and adjust their energy band structure to cause band gap shrinkage. The following relationship exists between the band gap and pressure:62 Eg = 3.27 – 0.0088P(3)where Eg is the band gap of TiO2 NPs and P is the pressure (GPa). According to the formula, when the maximum value of ρCT in the system (P = 1.37 GPa) appears, the band gap of TiO2 NPs is 3.258 eV. When the pressure is lower than 1.37 GPa, the band gap value decreases with the pressure increasing. The energies required for the above-mentioned (I) and (II) CT processes are all decreasing, and thus the CT probability from this process is increasing. Under ambient pressure, the theory that the band structure and electronic coupling can enhance the SERS signal has been reported by Zhao et al.63 Therefore, when the pressure exceeding 1.37 GPa is continuously applied to the TiO2@N719 system, the best coupling match between CT and laser energy in the process (I) is gradually broken, the CT contribution decreases and the SERS intensity decreases.

As schematically illustrated in Fig. 7b, introducing Ag NPs into the TiO2@N719 assembly can cause LSPR. Simultaneously, it can also provide new CT pathways. Since the Fermi level (EFermi) of Ag NPs is at −4.84 eV, the energy level difference value with the HOMO level of N719 is 0.76 eV, and the energy level difference value with the CB of TiO2 is 1.21 eV. The energy provided by the 514 nm laser is sufficient to support the occurrence of the CT processes. In short, in the TiO2@N719@Ag system, there are five sources of the CT pathway: (I) electrons are excited from the HOMO level of N719 to the EFermi (μPICT) of Ag; (II) the electrons at the HOMO level of N719 are excited by light to the CB of TiO2 (μPICT); (III) electrons are excited from EFermi of Ag to the CB of TiO2 (μPICT); (IV) electrons are excited from the CB of TiO2 to the LUMO of N719 (μPICT); and (V) the molecular resonance enhancement occurs when electrons are excited from the HOMO level to the LUMO level of N719 (μmol). According to formula (3), when the system has a maximum ρCT value at 2.48 GPa, the band gap of TiO2 NPs is 3.248 eV. Similar to the TiO2@N719 system, when the pressure is lower than 2.48 GPa, the energy threshold of the CT process in the system (I), (II), (III) and (IV) gradually decreases with the pressure increasing, leading to the CT probability gradually increasing. However, when the pressure is higher than 2.48 GPa, the excessive pressure will destroy the best coupling state between the energy levels, resulting in the weakened contribution of CT and the decrease of SERS signals.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we prepared TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag DSSC systems and carried out a high pressure SERS study with diamond anvils. Upon compression, we observed a significant enhancement in the SERS signals of the N719 dye in the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag systems up to 1.37 and 2.48 GPa, respectively. Upon comparison, it has been revealed that introduction of Ag NPs into the TiO2@N719 system can enlarge its light response range, improve the light trapping ability, and enhance the SERS intensity. Furthermore, the high pressure induces the band gap of TiO2 NPs in the two systems to shrink to 3.258 and 3.248 eV, so that the energy level matching degree and ρCT in the two systems are optimal, favoring the CT process. The tuning effect of high pressure on the carrier density of TiO2 in the system is explored, and the ρCT in the DSSC system is related to the free carrier density effect. Moreover, the different high pressure evolution steps of the corresponding Raman modes of N719 further confirm that the material structures of the two systems are not significantly damaged within the range of pressure changes. In the end, the CT mechanism of the TiO2@N719 and TiO2@N719@Ag DSSC systems under high pressure was investigated using the SERS method. The TiO2@N719@Ag DSSC systems offered new CT pathways (N719 to Ag and Ag to TiO2) compared with TiO2@N719. This study provides a perspective on the research of the interfacial CT of the DSSC system using SERS. Our work will be a promising approach to preliminarily estimate the CT behavior and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
