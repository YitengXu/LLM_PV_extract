The proposed diphenyl sulfone-based dyes (DSOs) possess excellent light-harvesting capability and exhibit efficient intramolecular charge transfer character upon excitation. The two-photon absorption properties were evaluated by two-photon excited fluorescence spectrometry in the range of 720–850 nm. The maximum two-photon absorption cross-sections of C-DSO, P-DSO and T-DSO are 285, 1059, and 1030 GM, respectively. The two-component photointiating systems, DSOs/iodonium salt and DSOs/sulfonium salt, behave as efficient initiators for the cationic polymerization of epoxides and the free radical polymerization of acrylates under a 405 nm LED light source. In addition, two-photon initiated polymerization tests conducted on P-DSO and T-DSO indicate that the DSOs are promising initiators for 3D microfabrications. The underlying photochemical mechanisms were studied by steady state photolysis, electron spin resonance spin trapping, fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry.
Introduction
The wide application of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the photopolymerization industry has prompted the urgent need for high performance photoinitiators (PIs) and multicomponent photoinitiation systems (PISs) that are well adapted to commercial light-emitting diodes. In the last decade, an increasing number of PIs and PISs that exhibit high photoinitiation ability under near UV and visible light have been developed.1–10 However, the development of novel PIs and PISs is still important, especially in optoelectronics, 3D-printing, nanotechnology, and holographic recording.11–15
In general, the photoinitiating efficiency of PIs and PISs are determined by two factors. One is the absorption wavelength and molar extinction coefficient, and the other is the photo-reactivity, which is in terms of excited state production and interaction processes. Structures with efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristic and highly coupled molecular orbitals have been proved to have redshifted absorption and excellent light-harvesting capability.16–19 Thus, centrosymmetric quadrupolar molecules (D–π-A–π-D or A–π-D–π-A motifs, where D and A are electron donating and withdrawing units, respectively) with extended π-conjugation system and efficient ICT property are potential candidates.20,21 This type of molecules have wide applications in organic photoelectric materials, such as dye-sensitized solar cells, organic light emitting diodes, nonlinear optics, two-photon initiated polymerization, and organic field-effect transistors.22–27 However, their application as prospective PIs in one-photon initiated polymerization is seldom investigated.28–30
Given the strong electron affinity, good thermal stability, and unique steric effect of sulfone and two phenyl rings, diphenyl sulfone (DPS) unit has attracted increasing attention in designing organic photoelectric materials, especially organic light-emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence.5,31–36 In the present work, we proposed three A–π-D–π-A dyes, 3,6-bis[(p-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl-ethynyl]-9-dodecyl-9H-carbazole (C-DSO), 3,7-bis[(p-phenyl-sulfonyl)phenylethynyl]-10-dodecyl-10H-phenothiazine (P-DSO) and 4,4′-bis[(p-phenylsulfonyl)phenylethynyl]triphenylamine (T-DSO). DPS was used as electron acceptor for the proposed structures, and carbazole, triphenylamine and phenothiazine were used as electron donors. In addition, carbon–carbon triple bond was introduced via Sonogashira coupling reaction to obtain excellent π-conjugation length and molecular planarity.
The ICT properties of the DSOs were investigated through single- and two-photon excited fluorescence spectra (SPEF and TPEF). Significant solvatochromism effect and large two-photon absorption cross-sections (σ) were observed as expected. The photoinitiating abilities of DSOs/iodonium salt and DSOs/sulfonium salt systems were evaluated for the cationic polymerization (CP) of epoxides and the free radical polymerization (FRP) of acrylates under a 405 nm LED light source. The photochemical mechanisms were studied by steady-state photolysis, electron spin resonance spin trapping, and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, two-photon initiated polymerization (TPIP) experiments were carried out with a 780 nm femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser system using P-DSO and T-DSO as initiators.
Experimental
Materials and synthesis
All reactants and reagents used were of analytical reagent grade, which were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP), epichlorohydrin (ECH), triethanolamine (TEA) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works (Beijing, China). N-tert-Butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) was obtained from 3A Chemicals. Camphorquinone (CQ), 2-isopropyltioxanthone (ITX) and diphenyl[(phenylthio)phenyl]sulfonium hexafluorophosphate (SON) were obtained from Heowns Biochem LLC (Tianjin, China). Iodonium bis(4-methylphenyl) hexafluorophosphate (ION) was prepared as described in ref. 37. Oligomers and monomers, including Epoxy resin E51 and tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA) for one-photon initiated polymerization, bisphenol A epoxy resin diacrylate (EA) and 4-acryloylmorpholine (ACMO) for two-photon initiated polymerization were obtained from Sanmu Company (Jiangsu, China) (Scheme 1).

The characterizations of the synthesized compounds were carried out in detail using NMR (Bruker AV400) and ESI-MS (Nermag France R10-10C) (Fig. S5†). The specific experimental conditions involved in this article are listed in ESI.†
General procedures for the synthesis of DSOs
Typically, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (0.04 mmol), CuI (0.1 mmol), PPh3 (0.1 mmol) and 4-bromo-diphenylsulfone (2.2 mmol) were dissolved in a solution of DMF (20 mL) and triethylamine (15 mL). The mixture was nitrogen bubbled for 30 min and then slowly heated to 60 °C and remained for 1 hour. After the reaction mixture was heated to 85 °C, a 10 mL DMF solution with diethynyl aromatic amine derivatives (1.0 mmol) was slowly added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was remained at 85 °C for 6 h under nitrogen atmosphere. Thin-layer chromatography was used for monitoring the reaction. The result mixture was cooled and poured into saturated NH4Cl solution. The crude product precipitated in the solution. The result mixture was filtered and the filter cake was dissolved in CH2Cl2 and washed with water and brine. The organic phase was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporator. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography using petroleum ether and dichloromethane as eluent.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The targeted A–π-D–π-A dyes were prepared by Sonogashira coupling reaction in accordance with Scheme 2. The target compounds possess two DPS groups in the molecular structures, providing the two-branch centrosymmetric characteristic. Such design can enlarge the size of the molecular π-conjugated system and redshift the maximum absorption peaks while maintaining high molar extinction coefficients.

Solubility is an important parameter to be considered in the molecular design of a PI. Thus, we introduced alkyl chains on the carbazole and phenothiazine moieties to enhance their solubility in monomers. The solubility of proposed compounds in toluene, ethyl acetate, THF, acetonitrile and DMSO was detected by photometric method (Table S1†).38 In spite of the poor solubility of C-DSO in the selected solvents, P-DSO is freely soluble (>10 g/100 mL) in the most of the test solvents (exc. acetonitrile). The solubility of DSOs follows the order of P-DSO > T-DSO > C-DSO. The difference in solubility can be ascribed to the spatial structure of the DSOs. Although the rigid conjugate structure of C-DSO hinders the solubility, the solubility of C-DSO in some medium polarity solvents (e.g. THF, chloroform, dichloromethane and 1,4-dioxane) are much better than that of in strong polar solvents with the help of long alkyl chain.
UV-vis absorption and fluorescence properties of DSOs
The UV-vis absorption spectra of DSOs in THF are given in Fig. 1(a), and their spectroscopic data are summarized in Table 1. The three compounds are characterized by high molar extinction coefficients (ε) in the near-UV and visible range. In particular, the absorptions of P-DSO and T-DSO are excellent in the 400–450 nm spectral range (e.g., T-DSO ∼40000 M−1 cm−1 at 405 nm and P-DSO ∼4570 M−1 cm−1 at 450 nm), ensuring a good overlap with the emission spectra of the LED used in this work. The strong and broad absorption peaks above 350 nm are assigned to the delocalized π–π* electronic transitions.

The photophysical properties of the DSOs were also studied in different solvents. The single-photon fluorescence spectra of the DSOs are given in Fig. 1(b)–(d), and the UV-vis absorption spectra are given in Fig. S6.† The corresponding data were presented in Table S2.† In contrast to the weak solvent polarity dependencies of absorption maxima and shapes, the fluorescence emission maxima are tailed by solvent polarity. Upon increasing solvent polarity, both the fluorescence emission maxima and the Stokes’ shifts show significantly redshifts. These facts can be ascribed to symmetry breaking in the excited state of symmetric quadrupolar molecules. As a result, the excited state of quadrupolar molecules behave similar to dipolar emissive state.39 Thus the solute/solvent interaction at excited state is much stronger than that at ground state, leading to the weak solvatochromism effect in the absorption spectra but strong solvatochromism effect in the fluorescence emission spectra. In addition, the large Stokes’ shifts values, in some case superior to 10000 cm−1 is observed, indicating the ICT property of DSOs. As shown in Table S2,† the Stokes’ shifts values follow the order of P-DSO > T-DSO > C-DSO, implying that P-DSO and T-DSO undergo a much stronger ICT process upon excitation than C-DSO. Furthermore, all compounds are luminescent with high quantum yield (up to 0.8), and the fluorescence quantum yields decrease with the increasing of solvent polarity (exc. dichloromethane).
The optimized geometries and frontier orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) are shown in Fig. 2 to confirm the electron delocalization. Both HOMO and LUMO show a symmetrical distribution on the right and left parts of the molecules for all dyes. The HOMO of the DSOs is restricted on the electron-donating aromatic amine cores, whereas the LUMO is evenly distributed on the two branches and a slight part of donors. This moderate charge separation at Franck–Condon state may be due to the two symmetrical DPS groups at the terminal of the compounds, which can be proved by the UV-vis absorption spectra in different solvents (Fig. S6†).

Two-photon excited fluorescence spectra
As shown in Fig. 1(a), all the target compounds are highly transparent without any absorption in the wavelength range of 600–800 nm, which indicates that there are no molecular energy levels corresponding to single electron transition in this spectral range. Thus, the fluorescence emission produced under irradiation above 700 nm can be ascribed to two-photon absorption. In this study, TPEF spectra were measured with excitation wavelengths ranging from 720 nm to 850 nm. For comparison, the corresponding SPEF and TPEF spectra of DSOs in THF are given in Fig. 3(a), and the TPEF spectra of DSOs under different excitation laser wavelengths are given in Fig. S7.† The single and changeless TPEF spectra indicate that the state responsible for the fluorescence emission is not the locally excited state but the ICT state. In addition, the peak positions and peak shapes of TPEF and SPEF spectra are similar to each other (Fig. 3(a)), which imply that the TPEF and SPEF emissions for these given compounds are from the same excited state, although their initial Frank–Condon states may be different.40
 Fig. 3  Normalized SPEF (the dot line) and TPEF (the solid line) spectra (a) and TPA cross-section of DSOs in THF (b) (1.0 × 10−6 M). 
To demonstrate the applicability of the designed DSOs for TPIP, we evaluated the TPA cross-section (σ) of DSOs by using Rhodamine B as reference. The calculated σ (expressed in GM = 1 × 10−50 cm4 s per photon per molecule) and TPA action cross-section (ησ, where η is the fluorescence quantum yield) are shown in Fig. 3(b) and Table S3.† All three compounds, especially P-DSO and T-DSO, show larger TPA cross-sections compared with commercial Rhodamine B dye. The maximum σ values are 285 GM for C-DSO, 1059 GM for P-DSO, and 1030 GM for T-DSO in the range of 720–850 nm. The magnitudes of σ depend on the degree of ICT upon excitation, thus, the result indicates that P-DSO and T-DSO exhibit more efficient ICT upon excitation than C-DSO. The optimal UV-vis and two-photon absorption wavelengths are 368 and 750 nm (or 720 nm) for C-DSO, 395 and 720 nm for P-DSO, 392 and 720 nm for T-DSO, which also indicate that P-DSO and T-DSO possess more effective ICT properties than C-DSO. This result may be attributed to the stronger electronic donating capability and easily twisted geometric structures of phenothiazine and triphenylamine, whereas the rigid structure of carbazole contributes to high quantum yield. The σ values for P-DSO and T-DSO at 800 nm, the mostly used wavelength in TPIP microfabrication, remain higher than 400 GM, which are much larger than those of the commercial photoinitiators. It indicates that P-DSO and T-DSO may exhibit high two-photon initiating ability in TPIP process.
One-photon initiated free radical and cationic polymerization
The two-component PISs are based on DSOs/ION and DSOs/SON for FRP and CP. For comparison, CQ/TEA (1%/2% w/w), ITX/ION and ITX/SON (0.1%/1% w/w) were tested as reference PISs under the same experimental conditions. The typical conversion–time profiles are given in Fig. 4.

Remarkably, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), the FRP of TPGDA in the presence of the DSOs/ION and the DSOs/SON systems are quite efficient and superior to that of the reference CQ/TEA system. Especially, the double bond conversion of P-DSO/ION system can reach 79% in 10 s irradiation (only 31% for CQ/TEA system) and the final double bond conversion can reach up to 90%. Clearly, the DSOs/ION systems are more efficient for the FRP of TPGDA than that of the DSOs/SON systems. This result can be attributed to the fact that the more negative reduction potential value of SON makes it hard to be reduced by the sensitizers.
As shown in Fig. 4(c), the polymerization efficiency in CP progress is rather similar for the different DSOs/ION systems. More than 60% of epoxy group conversion could be obtained after 60 s irradiation, whereas the ITX/ION can only reach 25%. Although the DSOs/SON systems exhibit lower polymerization efficiency than the DSOs/ION systems, the final epoxy conversion of the P-DSO/SON system can reach up to 60%, which is much higher than the 35% for the ITX/SON system.
The influence of DSOs and ION concentrations on CP process are shown in Fig. S8(d)–(f).† For all the proposed DSOs/ION systems, the concentration of ION is not the decisive factor of polymerization efficiency. However, the initiating efficiency is enhanced with the increasing of the DSOs concentration (e.g., the final epoxy conversion increases from 54% to 70% as the amount of C-DSO increases from 0.05% to 0.1%). According to the generally accepted mechanism, we can infer that the formed radical cation (DSOs˙+) plays an important role in initiating the ring opening polymerization.41
Two-photon initiated polymerization
In consideration that the DSOs/ION systems are efficient initiators in one-photon initiated FRP and the DSOs possess considerable TPA cross-sections (392 GM for P-DSO and 385 GM for T-DSO at 780 nm), the TPIP experiment was carried out using P-DSO and T-DSO as initiators alone and as sensitizers for ION. The SEM images of the fabricated arrays are shown in Fig. 5. Obviously, the polymerization thresholds (Pth, which is defined as the average power before the objective lens with a fixed linear scanning speed of 10 μm s−1) of the DSOs alone and the DSO/ION systems are almost the same in this experiment. The initiating efficiency is only slightly enhanced with the addition of 1 wt% ION both for P-DSO and T-DSO. The Pth of P-DSO and P-DSO/ION system are 4.11 mW, while the Pth of T-DSO and T-DSO/system are 4.55 mW. The initiating efficiency affects not only the Pth and writing speed but also the fabrication accuracy. Thus comprehensive and systematic work should be carried out to determine the influence of adding ION or other co-initiators. Finally, a two-layer periodic microstructure was produced with a laser power of 10.2 mW and a writing speed of 100 μm s−1 (Fig. 6). The distance of every two neighbouring polymerization streaks (∼380 nm) is about 1.7 μm and the unpolymerized resin can be easily washed out by ethanol.

Photochemistry of the DSOs-based photoinitiating systems
The photochemistry of the DSOs-based photoinitiating systems was investigated by steady-state photolysis, electron spin resonance spin trapping, fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The steady-state photolysis of DSOs/ION systems were investigated using UV-vis and fluorescence spectrophotometry (Fig. 7 and Fig. S10†). The photolysis efficiencies were calculated from the A/A0 ratio, where A is the absorbance of the assigned wavelength (e.g., C-DSO: 365 nm) at different irradiation times and A0 is the absorbance before irradiation (Fig. S10(c)†). The photo-stability of the DSOs were investigated under same experimental conditions for comparison (Fig. S9†).
 Fig. 7  UV-vis and fluorescence spectra of steady-state photolysis of DSOs/ION in THF solution under the irradiation of 405 nm LED (cDSOs = 2.0 × 10−5 M, cION = 2.0 × 10−4 M), (a) and (c) P-DSO/ION, (b) and (d) T-DSO/ION. 
As shown in Fig. S10(c),† the addition of ION dramatically accelerates the photolysis efficiency of DSOs, especially for the P-DSO/ION system. The photo-bleaching in the visible light region inclines that DSOs are consumed when interacting with ION under irradiation, thereby demonstrating that intermolecular charge transfer exists between the DSOs and ION. The very slowly absorbance decreasing of DSOs under irradiation may be due to the degradation of diphenyl group (Fig. S9†).42
Although all the three DSOs/ION systems undergo absorption decreasing and fluorescence quenching under irradiation, the P-DSO/ION system is different from the other two simple consumed systems. As shown in Fig. 7(a), there are mainly two stages for P-DSO/ION interaction. At the beginning of irradiation, a sharp decline occurred in the 400–450 nm and the 290–300 nm ranges, while a distinct increase is observed in the range of 330–400 nm. For the second stage, the spectra begin to decrease at the newly occurred peak (∼378 nm) and increase slowly at 320 nm with further irradiation. The fluorescence spectra of the P-DSO/ION interaction also have two stages (Fig. 7(c)). A shoulder peak occurs after 2 s of irradiation, and then the original emission peak disappears with the appearance of a blue-shift peak. This fresh emission peak exhibits stronger intensity than the initial one and decreases with the prolonged irradiation time. Considering of the rapid and thorough changes in absorption and fluorescence spectra of the P-DSO/ION system, we can suppose that the initial P-DSO may undergo photochemical reaction and result in a new compound at the beginning of the P-DSO/ION interaction because phenothiazine can be photo-oxidized by singlet oxygen and the sulfur atom oxidized phenothiazine compounds always possess blue-shift fluorescence emission.43 Then, the newly generated product continues to interact with ION and results in decreasing in 378 nm of absorption spectra and 441 nm of emission spectra.
The photo-bleaching efficiencies of different DSOs/ION systems (P-DSO > T-DSO > C-DSO) are in line with the corresponding initiating abilities in the FRP experiment. In addition, the photobleaching efficiency of the P-DSO/SON system is somewhat lower than that of P-DSO/ION couple (Fig. S10(d)†), which also agrees with initiating efficiency in the FRP experiment.
Furthermore, the free energy change ΔG values are negative both for the DSOs/ION and the DSOs/SON systems, indicating that the photo-induced electron transfer is thermodynamically favourable (Table 2). The less negative ΔG values for the DSOs/SON systems agree with the lower initiating efficiency when compared with the DSOs/ION systems. The first oxidation peak of P-DSO can be ascribed to the oxidizing of sulfur atom in phenothiazine moiety (Fig. 8), which results in a much lower ΔG value (−1.88 eV for the P-DSO/ION system and −1.07 eV for the P-DSO/SON system) than other the proposed PISs. Thus, P-DSO containing PISs exhibit extraordinary initiating ability in FRP.

The initiating species of the DSOs/ION systems (tolyl radicals, MePh˙) are easily detected as PBN/MePh˙ radical adducts by irradiating the DSOs/ION solution in ESR-ST experiments (Fig. 9). The simulation of the experimental ESR spectrum yields the hyperfine coupling constants: αN = 14.23 G and αH = 1.98 G, which are typical for the PBN/aryl radical adducts.46

Thus, the mechanism of one-photon initiated polymerization systems involved in the current paper is proposed as Scheme 3. This electron-transfer photosensitization process is a well-understood mechanism.41,47 The tolyl radical and radical cation are formed by transfering of an electron from the excited DSOs to the iodonium salt via the decay of exciplex (Formula (3) and (4)). The tolyl radical is responsible for initiating radical polymerization of acrylates (Formula (5)). The radical cation can initiate catioinic polymerition via directly attack the epoxy group (Formula (7)) as well as by secondary reaction with proton donors that generate the protonic acid (Formula (6) and (8)).

Conclusions
We designed and synthesized three symmetrical quadrupolar A–π-D–π-A dyes (C-DSO, P-DSO, and T-DSO) via Sonogashira coupling reaction. The single-photon excited fluorescence spectra show that the DSOs undergo efficient intramolecular charge transfer upon excitation. The two-photon absorption properties of the DSOs were investigated and the maximum two-photon absorption cross-sections of C-DSO, P-DSO, and T-DSO are 285, 1059 and 1030 GM, respectively. Two-photon initiated polymerization tests conducted on P-DSO and T-DSO demonstrate their excellent two-photon initiating ability in 3D microstructure fabrication. The Pth of P-DSO and T-DSO are 4.11 mW and 4.55 mW, respectively. In addition, the proposed DSOs/ION and DSOs/SON PISs behave as efficient initiators both for the cationic polymerization and the free radical polymerization under 405 nm LEDs light source. The extraordinary initiating ability of the P-DSO/ION and P-DSO/SON systems are ascribed to the low ionization potential of phenothiazine moiety in proposed structure. The results suggest that these electron-deficient A–π-D–π-A dyes have extensive potential application in one- and two-photon initiated polymerization. More A–π-D–π-A type dyes with different acceptors will be proposed and their application in photopolymerization will be studied in the future.
