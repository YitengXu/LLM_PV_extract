    , Accepted 21st November 2018First published on 7th December 2018AbstractThe BiVO4/WO3 heterojunction is the ideal photoanode for highly efficient solar water splitting. Despite much effort, the low light absorption efficiency near the BiVO4 band gap wavelength is still a major cause of loss of water-splitting efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce a BiVO4/WO3 photoanode in which BiVO4 single crystal nanoparticles (NPs) are decorated. In particular, we present a limited growth method in confined geometry to synthesize BiVO4 NPs. These BiVO4 NPs enhance Rayleigh-type light scattering, especially at the absorption edge wavelengths, resulting in increased light absorption efficiency (ηabs) at the corresponding wavelengths; the BiVO4 NPs dramatically improved the ηabs up to 60% at 500 nm, which is more than twice as high as the ηabs values obtained for previously reported BiVO4 photoanodes. In addition, BiVO4 NPs exhibit high charge separation efficiency, especially at low bias potentials. This result indicates effective charge transport in the NP morphology. As a result, the BiVO4 NP-coated WO3 photoanode achieves a remarkably high water splitting photocurrent of 5.8 ± 0.18 mA cm−2. This is the highest water-splitting photocurrent among those previously reported for BiVO4-based photoanodes.
Introduction
Solar water splitting is the most promising way to produce hydrogen using solar energy.1,2 The photoanode is a key component that absorbs light to generate and separate electron–hole pairs, inducing the water oxidation reaction.3,4 The photoanode should be a chemically stable metal oxide, have a bandgap capable of absorbing light over a broad wavelength range and have efficient charge separation properties.5–7 Current research has used a photoanode in which two or three metal oxides are heterogeneously bonded, rather than a single metal oxide.2,8–10 The heterojunction of BiVO4 and WO3 is the most studied photoanode.11–13 This heterojunction takes advantage of BiVO4 with a bandgap sufficient to absorb visible light, and the BiVO4/WO3 heterojunction has high charge-separation efficiency.14–17 Prior study on the heterojunction of BiVO4/WO3 was performed with various nanostructured electrodes, such as nanorods,12 nanowires,18 and nanohelices.19 The highest reported water-splitting efficiency, showing reproducible results, was from a BiVO4/WO3 nanohelix structure, achieving 5.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE).19 However, given that the theoretical water-splitting current value of the BiVO4/WO3 photoanode is 7.5 mA cm−2, we must still optimize the performance of this photoanode.18,20
Specifically, the most challenging factor for highly efficient water splitting using a heterojunction photoanode is the trade-off between the light absorption efficiency (ηabs) and separation efficiency (ηsep).18,21 For example, in the case of a BiVO4/WO3 heterojunction electrode, a thick BiVO4 shell is preferred to increase ηabs; however, in this case, the limited charge diffusion of BiVO4 results in poor ηsep.22 Conversely, when a thin BiVO4 shell is used, the ηsep increases, but ηabs decreases. In practice, most previous studies have utilized a thin shell BiVO4 layer.12,18,19,23 They could compromise the relatively low ηabs of the thin BiVO4 shell, due to high light scattering by the scaffold of nanostructured WO3 with pores of several hundred nanometers. Indeed, previous reports have shown that the ηsep was more than 90% but the average ηabs was in the range of 80–90%. In particular, it should be noted that the ηabs was very low as the absorption limit wavelength of BiVO4 (around 500 nm) was approached. A BiVO4/WO3 core/shell nanowire photoanode showed an ηabs of 20% at 500 nm.18 In the case of the BiVO4/WO3 nanohelix, the ηabs was 7% at 500 nm.19 The BiVO4 nanoporous film showed an ηabs of 20% at 500 nm.24 Considering that the photocurrent obtained by absorbing light of 450–500 nm wavelengths reaches 50% of the theoretical maximum photocurrent, achieving a high ηabs in the wavelength band near the absorption edge while maintaining high ηsep is an urgent task to reach the theoretical water splitting current.
To address this issue, we introduce a heterojunction photoanode in which single crystal BiVO4 nanoparticles (NPs) are decorated on the WO3 surface. Such BiVO4 NPs can enhance the Rayleigh-type back scattering efficiency at a specific wavelength. We were able to enhance the scattering at wavelengths near the absorption edge by coating with BiVO4 NPs of about 150 nm size, which resulted in high ηabs. At a wavelength of 500 nm, the ηabs was 3 to 9 times higher than those obtained in previous studies.18,19,24 In addition, discrete BiVO4 NPs provide a short charge transport path compared to the conventional BiVO4 continuous shell morphology. We achieved a high ηsep of 94%. The improved ηabs, while retaining this high ηsep, immediately improved the water splitting efficiency and achieved a water splitting photocurrent of 5.8 ± 0.18 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. This result surpasses those of the best-performing BiVO4/WO3 nanohelix structures and other nanostructure photoanodes reported recently.18,19,24
Results and discussion
Detailed fabrication of the BiVO4 NP-coated WO3 porous scaffold is depicted in Fig. 1a. We first prepared the WO3 porous scaffold.25 The WO3 structure possesses pores of 640 nm arranged in a face centered cubic (FCC) lattice, as shown in the SEM image of Fig. 1b. To grow BiVO4 NPs on the surface of the WO3 scaffold, we demonstrate BiVO4 growth in the confined geometry of the polymer sphere assembly. Specifically, a colloidal solution containing 100 nm diameter PS latex spheres was added dropwise and dried, where the spheres were packed by self-assembly in pores, as observed in Fig. 1c. Then, the BiVO4 precursor solution was infiltrated into the space between the latex spheres; the amount of precursor solution penetrating the nanosphere assembly contained in one spherical macropore was only a few picoliters. We added 2 wt% of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate into the precursor solution to form Mo-doped BiVO4 (Mo:BiVO4) (see Fig. S1a†). Finally, heat treatment at 450 °C completely removed the latex spheres and left the BiVO4 NPs formed on the WO3 surface, as observed in Fig. 1d and e. Generally, the synthesis of BiVO4 by the conventional metal–organic decomposition (MOD) method results in a continuous worm-like morphology upon heat treatment.24,26,27 This is because the BiVO4 precursor coated as a thick film undergoes a phase transition from a tetragonal to a monoclinic crystalline phase at around 350 °C,28,29 where the nanocrystals are agglomerated by Ostwald ripening, resulting in a continuous morphology.24,26,27 Deposition in the confined geometry allowed precisely controlled coating with small amounts of the precursor solution and also inhibited the formation of a continuous film through thermal agglomeration of BiVO4, as described in Fig. 1a and S2.† As a result, a discrete NP-coated morphology was formed on WO3, as shown in Fig. 1d and e.

The scale bars are 1 μm. The insets are their magnified images. Scale bars: 0.5 μm. (f) Elemental mapping of the TEM image of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 structure. 
The average size of the NPs is about 150 nm, and the particle size distribution is shown in Fig. S3.† The size of the NPs and the thickness of the BiVO4 NP/WO3 film were controlled, as shown in Fig. S4.† In subsequent experiments, the sample (NP size: about 150 nm, film thickness: about 4 μm) that showed the highest water oxidation photocurrent was used (see Fig. S5† for the photocurrent values of the samples fabricated under various conditions). The elemental mapping results of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 structure are shown in Fig. 1f. We observe a non-uniform intensity distribution for Bi and V, unlike the uniform intensity distribution of W; this indicates a rough morphology of the BiVO4 layer. In particular, note that Bi and V cover most of the surface of WO3; this shows that the bare surface of WO3 is hardly exposed and indicates the formation of a uniform heterojunction of BiVO4 and WO3.
XRD was performed to confirm the crystalline phase, as shown in Fig. S6.† This result shows a monoclinic scheelite structure of BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 14-0688) and a monoclinic structure of WO3 (JCPDS no. 43-1035). The TEM image of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 is shown in Fig. 2a. The BiVO4 NPs adhere to the surface in the form of a compacted hemisphere, so the distance from the interface to the particle surface is on the order of tens of nanometers. More TEM images of BiVO4 NP/WO3 are shown in Fig. S7.† Thus, considering that the hole diffusion length of BiVO4 is in the range of 70–100 nm,30,31 our BiVO4 particles are not expected to adversely affect charge separation. In particular, the BiVO4 NPs are determined to be single crystalline from the clear diffraction pattern, as shown in Fig. 2b. The atomic simulation model of the interface between BiVO4 and WO3 based on the image in Fig. 2c is shown in Fig. 2d, which reveals an intact interface with a good lattice match. The band potentials of BiVO4 and WO3 were measured using a Mott–Schottky plot.11 The flat-band potential (Efb) value of BiVO4 was calculated to be −0.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl pH 7) or 0.2 VRHE, and the Efb value of WO3 was calculated to be −0.18 V (vs. Ag/AgCl pH 7) or 0.47 VRHE, as described in Fig. S1b.† The values of Efb of BiVO4 and WO3 are similar to those reported previously.11,32,33 This result confirms that the heterojunction of BiVO4 and WO3 forms a staggered-type band alignment.

The water-splitting efficiency of the photoanode is determined by efficiencies of light absorption (ηabs), charge separation (ηsep), and charge transport (ηtrans) between the electrode and the electrolyte.21 Since ηtrans can achieve unity independently without affecting other efficiencies through coating with the oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC),24,33–35 the performance of the photoanode is determined by ηabs and ηsep. The ηabs value is calculated by subtracting the reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) from the light incident on the sample as ηabs (%) = 100 − R% − T%.36 We evaluated the ηabs of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode. For comparison, a Mo:BiVO4/WO3 photoanode was prepared by coating with Mo:BiVO4 using the conventional MOD method,12,26 and it has a continuous shell morphology, as observed in Fig. S8.† From the Tauc plot calculated with the Kubelka–Munk function, the direct band gap of BiVO4 was found to be about 2.4 eV in both samples (see Fig. S9c†). The reflectance and transmittance spectra of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 and Mo:BiVO4 shell/WO3 structures are shown in Fig. S9a and S9b,† respectively. The calculated ηabs in the wavelength range of 300–550 nm is shown in Fig. 3a. In particular, in the 450–500 nm wavelength range, the Mo:BiVO4 NP sample shows higher ηabs than the BiVO4 shell sample and is about 1.8–2.6 times higher. Since the band gap absorption edge of BiVO4 is about 520 nm, this result reveals that BiVO4 NPs have high absorption at wavelengths near the absorption edge. We calculated the scattering efficiency of BiVO4 particles, assuming that polarized light with a wavelength of 400, 450, or 500 nm undergoes elastic scattering due to spherical particles (see Fig. 3b). These results show that a particle size of about 100 nm provides very high scattering efficiency at 450–500 nm. This indicates that the high scattering characteristics of BiVO4 NPs especially at wavelengths of 450–500 nm lead to a high ηabs of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode at the corresponding wavelengths. We confirm that the improvement in ηabs due to scattering leads to an increase in the water oxidation current. Fig. 3c shows the water oxidation photocurrent in the selective wavelength range. The water oxidation photocurrent of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode was approximately 5% larger than that of the Mo:BiVO4 shell/WO3 photoanode in the wavelength range of 300–450 nm but approximately 40% larger in the 450–500 nm wavelength region.

(c) The photocurrent density of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 and Mo:BiVO4 shell/WO3 in a specific wavelength range, and the photocurrent density enhancement ratio of Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 to Mo:BiVO4 shell/WO3. (d) J–V curves for sulfite oxidation and (e) separation efficiencies as a function of VRHE. 
The ηsep was measured using a 0.1 M Na2SO3-containing electrolyte. When the sulfite ion is included, the ηtrans can be assumed to be 100%.34,37 Then, the photocurrent is described by the equation Jsulfite = Jmax × ηabs × ηsep, where Jsulfite is the photocurrent density for sulfite oxidation. The ηsep is obtained by dividing Jsulfite by (Jmax × ηabs). The value of Jmax × ηabs is calculated from the integration of the product of the ηabs and the spectral irradiance over all the wavelengths below 516 nm (see the detailed calculation in Fig. S10†). The measured Jsulfite values of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 and Mo:BiVO4 shell/WO3 photoanodes at various VRHE values are shown in Fig. 3d. The BiVO4 NP/WO3 shows a higher Jsulfite than the BiVO4 shell/WO3. Specifically, the Jsulfite of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode was 5.9 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Fig. 3e shows the calculated ηsep in the bias potential range of 0–1.23 VRHE. Of particular note is that at low VRHE, the ηsep of the BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode is superior to that of the BiVO4 shell/WO3 photoanode; the BiVO4 NP/WO3 exhibits 68% higher ηsep than the BiVO4 shell/WO3 at 0.6 VRHE. Since the effect of charge recombination becomes dominant at low bias potentials,38 this result reveals superior charge transport in the BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode. This may be attributed to the fact that the discrete BiVO4 NP layer provides a shorter diffusion distance than the conventional BiVO4 shell. Comparing the charge transfer resistance of the two samples via EIS analysis, we confirm a better charge transfer in the BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode.
Finally, the water-splitting performance of the Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode was evaluated. The kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction was improved by coating with an FeOOH/NiOOH bilayer catalyst.24 The elemental mapping of the TEM image confirmed the uniform coating with the dual catalyst (Fig. S12†). A diagram of the charge transport for the water splitting reaction of the FeOOH/NiOOH/Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode is shown in Fig. 4a. The water-splitting photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curve was obtained under 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination. All samples showed negligible dark current up to 1.23 VRHE (Fig. S13†). As shown in Fig. 4b, the FeOOH/NiOOH/Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode exhibits a water oxidation photocurrent of approximately 5.8 ± 0.18 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. The photocurrent reproducibility of the samples measured under the same conditions is shown in Fig. S14.† This photocurrent value is 10% higher than that of the best-performing BiVO4/WO3 nanohelix photoanode (5.3 mA cm−2, with an FeOOH/NiOOH OEC coating).20 This photocurrent density exhibits the highest value among those obtained in previous studies (see Table S1†).

(e) Oxygen and hydrogen evolution and the photocurrent-to-O2 conversion efficiency of the FeOOH/NiOOH/BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode, measured at 1.23 VRHE. 
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the FeOOH/NiOOH/Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 4c. The photocurrent density value calculated by integrating the IPCE spectrum corresponds well with the photocurrent value from the J–V curve; the photocurrent density was calculated to be 5.785 mA cm−2, which closely corresponds to the value of 5.8 mA cm−2 measured in the experiment. The trend of IPCE values for various wavelengths is similar to those for the previously reported photoelectrodes in Table S1.† However, in the wavelength band near the absorption edge, BiVO4 NP/WO3 has a superior IPCE value; at 500 nm wavelength, the IPCE value of the BiVO4 NP/WO3 was 20%, while the previous results showed 10% or lower values. This high IPCE confirms the excellent light harvesting capability of the BiVO4 NP morphology. Fig. 4d also compares the IPCE of FeOOH/NiOOH coated BiVO4 shell/WO3. The BiVO4 NP/WO3 shows higher IPCE over the 450–500 nm wavelength range, confirming the scattering effect of BiVO4 NPs.
The water oxidation by the FeOOH/NiOOH/Mo:BiO4 NP/WO3 photoanode showed excellent stability, retaining 97% of the initial photocurrent value over 2 h (Fig. 4d). The amount of gas generated was measured to determine whether the photocurrent was due to the water splitting reaction. Fig. 4e shows the volumetric quantities of H2 and O2 evolved over time. O2 evolution was measured using a fluorescence O2 sensor. The molar ratio of H2 to O2 was 2:1, which is consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of water splitting. The faradaic efficiency calculated at 1.23 VRHE was more than 95%. Thus, most of the photogenerated charge was consumed for water splitting.
Experimental
Fabrication of Mo:BiVO4 nanoparticle-coated WO3 photoanodes
The WO3 porous structure was fabricated using a colloidal crystal of 800 nm polystyrene (PS) spheres (Bangs Lab Inc.). We coated a polymer sphere colloid solution (5 wt% ethanol solution) on FTO and dried it to obtain a colloidal crystal. Porous WO3 was obtained by drop casting 25 mM H2WO4 solution onto FTO substrate and annealing at 500 °C. The deposition of the Mo-doped BiVO4 NPs on the WO3 scaffold was achieved using a nanosphere assembly template. PS nanosphere colloids (diameter of 100 nm) of 10 μl were introduced into the macropores of the WO3. The BiVO4 precursor was prepared from bismuth nitrate pentahydrate [Bi(NO3)3·5H2O] (Sigma, 99.9%), ammonium metavanadate [NH4VO3] (Sigma, 99.99%) and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O] (Sigma 99.98%) dissolved in a mixture of 70% nitric acid and deionized water (10 ml, 1:1 v/v). Then 30 μl BiVO4 precursor solution was infiltrated into the 100 nm nanosphere assembly and heat treated to remove the PS and crystallize the Mo-doped BiVO4. The FeOOH and NiOOH dual layer catalyst was deposited by photoelectrodeposition using a three-electrode cell with a Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode. The photoanode deposition was performed in a 0.1 M FeSO4 aqueous solution and 0.1 M NiSO4 aqueous solution (pH 7) for 1400 s and 480 s at 0.25 VAg/AgCl and 0.11 VAg/AgCl, respectively.
Characterization
The SEM and TEM images were obtained using JSM-7100F (JEOL) and JEM-3010 (JEOL) instruments, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Leybold spectrometer with an Al Kα monochromatic beam (1486.6 eV) with an input power of 150 W (ESCALAB250 XPS system, Theta Probe XPS system). The crystal structure was analyzed by XRD (Rigaku). The UV-visible transmittance and diffuse reflectance were measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometry (UV-2550, Shimadzu) with an integrating sphere.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization
The PEC current–voltage curves were obtained using a potentiostat (Versastat, Ametek) with a three-electrode system, where the photoanode served as the working electrode, Pt wire functioned as the counter electrode (Bioanalytical Systems, Inc., MW-4130), and a Ag/AgCl electrode served as the reference electrode. The illuminated area defined by the mask was approximately 1 cm2. A solution of 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 7.0) and 0.1 M Na2SO3 (pH 7.0) was used as the electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry was performed by exposing the photoanode to simulated solar illumination (PEC-L01, Peccell Technologies, AM 1.5G filter installed). The light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 using a Si reference cell (BS-520, Bunko-Keiki). The measurement was performed using a Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode. The potential vs. Ag/AgCl was converted to the potential vs. RHE using the equation E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + EAg/AgCl (reference) + 0.059 V × pH, where EAg/AgCl (reference) = 0.197 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at 25 °C. The IPCE was measured using a 300 W Xe light source (Oriel) with a monochromator (Cornerstone™ 130, 1/8 m, Newport) in DC mode. The IPCE was obtained using the following equation: IPCE = [J (mA cm−2) × 1240 (volt × nm)]/[Pmono (mW cm−2) × λ (nm)], where J stands for the photocurrent density, Pmono stands for the intensity, and λ represents the wavelength of the incident monochromatic light. The incident light intensity was measured using a photodiode detector (silicon-calibrated detector, Newport). O2 evolution was measured using a fluorescence O2 sensor. The amount of H2 evolved was measured by gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 7820A GC).
Conclusions
We fabricated a BiVO4 nanoparticle-coated WO3 photoanode. The BiVO4 NPs were formed by inhibiting Ostwald ripening in the confined geometry of the polymer sphere assembly. BiVO4 NPs remarkably enhanced the absorption at the band edge wavelength (450–500 nm) of BiVO4 by Rayleigh-type scattering. The BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode showed much higher ηabs at 450–500 nm wavelengths than the conventional BiVO4 shell coated photoanode. Also, the BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode exhibited excellent charge separation properties. This indicates that more efficient charge transport occurs in the morphology of discrete nanoparticles rather than in a continuous shell. As a result, our Mo:BiVO4 NP/WO3 photoanode achieved a water oxidation photocurrent of approximately 5.8 ± 0.18 mA cm−2 (with OEC coating). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest water-splitting photocurrent among those previously reported for BiVO4-based photoanodes. Our results shed light not only on the novel method of controlling the morphology of BiVO4, but also on the fact that the BiVO4 morphology is an important factor in improving the water splitting efficiency.
