    , Accepted 6th September 2019First published on 6th September 2019AbstractTo alleviate the scarcity of clean water, solar steam generation, which utilizes the green and abundant resources of Earth, has attracted considerable attention and been recognized as a sustainable technology to purify seawater and wastewater. Within the past five to seven years, building on remarkable advances in the synthesis of nanoscale photothermal materials, significant progress has been made in the design and fabrication of solar evaporators. Here, we comprehensively review the materials and structures of the three key components of solar evaporators: solar absorbers, substrates (i.e., support layers), and water collectors towards efficient harvesting of sunlight, thermal management, water transportation, interfacial evaporation, and collection. In particular, we discuss the design principles of water collectors for solar-driven evaporation, which are in the early stages of development at present. Furthermore, bio-inspired water collectors provide exciting opportunities for the design and realization of efficient water harvesting from solar steam. Finally, we introduce photothermal-enhanced membrane distillation (PMD), a promising alternative technique involving solar-driven interfacial evaporation for producing clean water. PMD combines solar energy and membrane distillation, which facilitates efficient water purification and collection. In this review, we discuss the design guidelines and recent development of this photothermal-enhanced water purification. This review provides useful insights into the material choice and structure optimization to realize enhanced solar evaporators towards freshwater generation.
1. Introduction
Although 70% of Earth's surface is covered with water, only 3% of it is freshwater.1–3 According to a 2019 report from the World Wildlife Fund, 1.1 billion people worldwide have limited access to fresh water, and 2.4 billion people are exposed to water-borne diseases, which are closely related to inadequate sanitation.4 The scarcity of freshwater is one of the biggest threats to the sustained growth of the world economy, and the situation has been exacerbated by environmental pollution, agriculture and population growth, and socioeconomic development. In response, by 2018, more than 20000 water desalination plants had been constructed all over the world, which can generate 104.7 million m3 of water every day.5,6 Current technologies for water desalination include reverse osmosis (RO),7–10 electrodialysis,11,12 thermal distillation via heating bulk water, and membrane distillation (MD).13–15 However, most of them involve high energy consumption, which increases the emission of greenhouse gases.
To meet the pressing need for fresh water at minimal energy cost, solar steam generation has been proposed and its application in water desalination has been widely investigated in recent years (Fig. 1). More than 2000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle presented the idea of using solar energy to evaporate saline water and obtaining freshwater by condensing the generated vapor.16 Because it is powered by an abundant and economically friendly resource, solar evaporation does not have harmful effects on the environment. Moreover, recent advances in nanoscale photothermal materials, which can effectively capture sunlight and convert light to heat, make solar-assisted evaporation one of the most appealing technologies for purifying seawater or wastewater. Furthermore, significant progress in novel evaporator designs has led to solar evaporators whose efficiency exceeds 90% when combined with highly efficient photothermal materials. Traditionally, solar evaporation has involved dispersing solar absorbers into bulk water for volumetric heating. Due to the significant heat loss associated with this approach,17–19 interfacial heating by confining solar absorbers to the air/water interface was proposed in the early 2010s to improve the solar evaporation efficiency.20 A typical double-layer interfacial solar evaporator comprises a solar absorber layer and a supporting substrate.21,22 Under solar irradiation, the solar absorber layer converts the light to heat that increases the surface temperature. Bulk water is continuously pumped up to contact the hot surface via water pathways within the substrate through capillary force and evaporation takes place in the confined high temperature zone. Apart from transporting water, the substrate also acts as a thermal barrier to reduce the heat conduction loss from the solar absorber layer to the underlying bulk water, significantly increasing the evaporation efficiency. Finally, water is harvested by condensing the vapor, coalescing water droplets and transporting the water droplets for collection.

Evaporation efficiency, a critical criterion for evaluating the performance of a solar evaporator, is defined as the ratio of the thermal energy stored in the generated vapor to the total energy of the irradiating light, , where ṁ represents the evaporation flux of water, hLV refers to the total evaporation enthalpy change, which includes sensible heat and phase change from liquid to vapor, Qs is the power density of the light irradiation, and A is the illuminated area.23 Three important factors affect the evaporation efficiency, η,: solar light absorption, thermal management, and water transportation. In the past few years, significant efforts have been dedicated to designing and realizing advanced materials and optimal evaporator designs to maximize the evaporation efficiency. In this context, photothermal materials are designed to achieve broadband absorption of sunlight and efficient conversion of light into heat. In addition, the supporting substrate is designed to minimize heat dissipation from the photothermal layer to the bulk water, to maintain high temperature at the evaporative surface, and simultaneously to supply adequate water for evaporation.
Herein, we review recent developments in materials design, synthesis and engineering of the three key components of solar evaporators: solar absorbers, substrates, and water collectors (Fig. 2). We present guidelines for materials selection and interfacial evaporator design for achieving highly efficient solar light harvesting, optimal thermal management, and high water transportation, all ultimately leading to high evaporation efficiencies. We also discuss the structure, surface, and interfacial aspects of water collectors that are critical to harvest the evaporated water. Firstly, we explore and compare various kinds of solar absorbers, classified by their different photothermal mechanisms. The structure designs of these photothermal materials to maximize light absorption and produce thermal energy are discussed. Then, we outline the design principles for substrates to provide thermal confinement and supply water to the solar absorber layer. Different types of substrate materials with low thermal conductivity and an interconnected porous structure are presented, and advanced configurations are introduced, including 1D/2D water pathway structures and salt-rejection systems. We highlight the importance of the efficient collection of water from the steam produced by the interfacial evaporator. In particular, we point out various extraordinary water collectors in nature and discuss the corresponding bio-inspired water collectors for highly efficient water harvesting in solar evaporators. Finally, we discuss photothermal membrane distillation, which enables facile water harvesting.

2. Materials selection for solar absorbers and substrates
For the past few decades, the performance of solar evaporators has been significantly improved by the advancement in materials science of solar absorbers and supporting substrates. Numerous efforts have been made to develop new materials and engineer the existing materials. Various solar absorbers are explored to achieve high light absorption and thermal energy harvesting. Simultaneously, new substrates are investigated to achieve efficient thermal management and water transportation. In what follows, we focus on the principles and strategies of materials selection of solar absorbers and substrates for realizing interfacial evaporators with high evaporation efficiency.
2.1. Solar absorbers
The photothermal effect describes a direct energy conversion process where light energy incident on a material is transformed into thermal energy (heat).24,25 Upon sunlight illumination, photothermal materials can absorb the photons and photoexcitation takes place, in which mobile charge carriers are driven by the light-induced electric field.26,27 The energy gained by the carriers is subsequently converted into heat. One key feature of photothermal materials is their broadband light absorption because the solar spectrum ranges from 280 nm to 2500 nm at sea level.28–30 Hence, an ideal photothermal material would absorb solar light over the entire spectrum, ensuring a high thermal energy output.
A variety of photothermal materials exhibit high light absorption, including plasmonic nanomaterials, semiconductors, polymers, and nanocarbon materials. These solar absorbers mainly rely on three kinds of photoexcitation: plasmonic local heating of noble metal nanoparticles, non-radiative relaxation of electron–hole pairs of semiconductors, and thermal vibration of organic molecules of polymers and nanocarbon materials. Here, we discuss different types of photothermal materials and highlight their photothermal efficiency, long-term stability, environmental impact, scalability, and economic aspects.

2.1.1. Plasmonic nanostructures. 
The photothermal effect of noble metal nanoparticles is ascribed to the excitation of localized surface plasmons under light irradiation (Fig. 3A).31 When the frequency of incident light matches the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) frequency of the metal nanoparticles, electrons exhibit collective coherent oscillation.32,33 LSPR decays either radiatively, resulting in light scattering, or non-radiatively, by generating hot electrons with very high kinetic energy which are eventually converted to heat. Various types of plasmonic nanoparticles have been utilized for solar evaporators, such as Au,34,35 Ag,36 CuS,37 Cu,38,39 Al,40 and Pd41 nanoparticles.

Au nanostructures have been widely explored for many applications, owing to their chemical stability, ease of synthesis, and facile tunability of size, shape, and optical properties. Halas and co-workers performed a detailed investigation how vapor forms on the surface of Au nanospheres under light illumination,42 and demonstrated solar evaporation with Au nanosphere-enabled volumetric heating.17 Although the steam generation efficiency was only 24%, their finding opened up possibilities for Au nanostructure-based solar evaporators. To obtain high evaporation efficiency, one design with a self-floating film composed of Au nanoparticles at the air–water interface was employed for localized heating (Fig. 3C).43 Under 532 nm laser illumination at a power density of 10.18 W cm−2, the evaporation efficiency of this interfacial heating evaporator (44%) was significantly higher than that achieved by volumetric heating. Advancing beyond the two-dimensional (2D) architecture, a three-dimensional (3D) plasmonic biofoam, realized by immobilizing Au nanorods on bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), enhanced the evaporation efficiency to 76.3% upon irradiation with a 808 nm laser at a power density of 5.1 W cm−2 (Fig. 3D).10
The main obstacle preventing Au nanoparticles from achieving broadband absorption is the inherent narrow extinction bandwidth of their LSPR. The typical full width at half maximum for Au nanorods ranges from 100 nm to 200 nm; for Au nanospheres, it ranges from 60 nm to 110 nm.10,44,45 The LSPR wavelength of plasmonic nanostructures is determined by the composition, size, shape, and coupling distance of plasmonic nanostructures (Fig. 3B).44,46,47 Self-aggregated Au nanowire bundle array structures with a wide range of nanoscale gaps exhibited an ultrabroadband light absorption of 91% at 400–2500 nm, and their solar evaporation efficiency was up to 57% at a light intensity of 20 kW m−2.48 An alternative strategy to expand the absorbance is to employ Au nanoparticles with a wide distribution of sizes and shapes. Such Au nanoparticles were deposited on an Al2O3 nanoporous substrate (Fig. 3E).49 In this study, light absorbance was calculated to be ∼99% across the wavelength range from 400 nm to 10 μm, and 90% evaporation efficiency was noted under solar irradiation at a power density of 4 kW m−2. Fratalocchi and co-workers fabricated Au nanostructures by connecting a nanorod to a nanosphere on a filter paper, and the coupled plasmon resonance of these nanostructures resulted in a broadband absorption.50 Consequently, the solar evaporation efficiency reached 87% at a light intensity of 2.3 kW m−2.
Other advantages of plasmonic nanostructures are their long-term stability and recyclability. Au nanoparticle-based solar evaporators have exhibited a superior recyclability of 98% in saline environments, and wood integrated with plasmonic Pd nanoparticles displayed remarkable stability after cycling for 144 hours in solar steam generation.41,50 Excellent recyclability also alleviates the burden on the environment. Moreover, most plasmonic nanostructures are synthesized by wet chemistry, so they can be produced on a large scale, suggesting that interfacial evaporators can also be produced on a large scale. However, the noble metals are expensive, which limits their real-world applications.


2.1.2. Semiconductors. 
The bandgap energy of semiconductors determines their light-to-heat conversion.51 When the energy of incident light is higher than that of the semiconductor bandgap, the light is absorbed and electron–hole pairs are generated (Fig. 3F). For a semiconductor with a narrow bandgap, the above-bandgap electron–hole pairs relax to the band edges, and the extra energy is non-radiatively released in the form of phonons that are converted to heat. However, for a broad bandgap, the electron–hole pairs recombine near the bandgap edges, releasing photons and lowering the photothermal efficiency. Semiconductors with narrow bandgaps have been extensively explored for solar steam generation. Examples include black titania,52–54 MoS2,55–58 Ti3O4 nanoparticles,54 oxygen-deficient MoO3 quantum dots,59 and Fe3O4.60 An appealing approach to improve optical properties is reducing the size of bulk materials to the nanoscale, which favors the light scattering among nanoparticles. Over the whole solar spectrum, bulk Ti2O3 displayed 85.5% light absorption, whereas 400 nm nanoparticles displayed a total absorption of 92.5% (Fig. 3G).61 Chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets absorbed 96% of incident light after incorporation into a BNC aerogel, whereas bulk MoS2 absorbed 90% of the light (Fig. 3H).56 For semiconductors with wide bandgaps, narrowing the bandgap through doping is a common way to improve the light absorption.62,63 TiO2 can absorb UV light only at wavelengths lower than 400 nm, corresponding to its intrinsic large bandgap (∼3 eV). In contrast, black titania, partially reduced titanium oxide from Ti4+ to Ti3+ by introducing oxygen vacancies, showed a narrow bandgap and realized 96% light absorption.54 These semiconductors are non-toxic and stable in aqueous environments. However, for most semiconductors with wide bandgaps, doping requires treatment at high temperatures ranging from 200–600 °C, which increases the synthesis cost.


2.1.3. Nanocarbon materials. 
The photothermal effect of nanocarbon materials stems from their lattice vibrations upon light illumination (Fig. 3I). The loosely held electrons in the π orbital of carbon materials are excited by a small energy input and jump to the π* orbital.64 Heat is generated when the excited electrons relax to the ground state. Diverse nanocarbon materials have been explored, such as graphite,65 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),66–68 graphene oxide (GO)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO),69–73 and carbon black.74
Nanocarbon materials can absorb sunlight over a broad spectrum, and the universal strategy for improving optical absorption is to tailor their structures. GO/rGO is a widely studied carbonaceous material for solar evaporation, owing to its good hydrophilic surface and the large surface area of the 2D flake structure.75 It is generally assembled into a porous structure to augment light capture (Fig. 3K). For example, a compact rGO film fabricated by vacuum filtration exhibited 13% diffuse reflection,76 whereas the reflectance for rGO foam was only 2.5%.22 Various 2D and 3D configurations have been developed for solar evaporation. A membrane composed of vertically aligned rGO nanosheets was realized using an antifreeze-assisted freezing technique, and the run-through channels were favorable for light absorption during solar evaporation.77 In other work, a concentrated GO-based solution with a sufficiently high shear elastic modulus and shear yield strength acted as an ideal 3D printing ink, and a sophisticated GO aerogel built by 3D printing possessed high porosity, up to 97.3%.78 This well-designed porous structure allowed broadband solar absorption higher than 97%. Another advantage of a GO/rGO-based evaporator is the feasibly of its large-scale fabrication. A rGO hydrogel with a large area can be fabricated by a surfactant-foaming sol–gel method, which effectively disrupts and reconstructs the GO liquid crystals in dispersions via microbubble templates.79 After simple freezing and air drying, a bulk aerogel with a structure-intact size of about 1 m2 was fabricated (Fig. 3J1). The large scale open-porous structure exhibited high solar-thermal conversion and decent mechanical properties (Fig. 3J2), which make it an attractive candidate for large-scale solar evaporation.
Compared with plasmonic nanoparticles and semiconductors, nanocarbon materials exhibit broadband absorption and the cost of their synthesis is much lower. Combining the merits of abundance, chemical stability, non-toxicity, facile synthesis, and scalability, they have emerged as one of the most widely investigated photothermal materials for solar evaporation.


2.1.4. Polymers. 
The light-to-heat conversion of polymers is also attributed to the energy released when the excited electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) relax to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Polypyrrole (PPy)80–85 and polydopamine (PDA)86–90 are the most well studied photothermal polymers for solar evaporation, due to their broadband absorption, low cost, ease of synthesis, and remarkable biocompatibility. A distinctive characteristic of polymers is their flexibility, which enables their deposition on various substrates with a curved structure that aids in solar energy harvesting. PPy can be facilely coated by chemical vapor deposition polymerization on air-laid paper,80 by in situ solution-phase polymerization on a cotton fabric and polypropylene mesh,81,82 and by electro-polymerization on a stainless steel mesh (Fig. 3L).83 The PPy coating was stable and offered over 90% broad-spectrum absorption of solar light. Inspired by the adhesive protein in mussels, PDA with a structure similar to eumelanin is well known for its versatile adhesion on almost all substrates via self-polymerization of dopamine in alkaline solution.91 A homogeneous PDA coating formed on a wood surface and carbonized the cotton fabric could absorb almost all the light in the UV-visible region and the majority of the light in the NIR region.86,88 The hydrophilic nature of PDA ensures that adequate water contacts the hot surface zone for evaporation, and the rough surface of the PDA layer further contributes to the light harvesting. As an alternative to depositing a PDA layer on various substrates, PDA microspheres were synthesized for solar evaporation, and the size was optimized to improve the light absorption.90 After integration with a BNC aerogel, the resulting PDA/BNC bilayer structure exhibited up to 98% light absorption over the range from 450 nm to 750 nm (Fig. 3M). Compared to most other photothermal materials discussed above, the biocompatibility, low toxicity, and biodegradable nature of PDA make it an environmentally benign material, and its versatile adhesion enables it to be potentially deployed on a large scale in aqueous environments with minimal effect on the ecosystem.90,92 However, this presumption is yet to be comprehensively investigated.
The performance of different solar absorbers, their efficiency, long-term stability, toxicity, and cost are listed in Table 1. Their performance is closely related to the intrinsic material properties and optimization of their structures. Although some photothermal materials cannot be directly compared, the list here provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of these materials to guide researchers in choosing photothermal materials for solar absorber layers for enhanced solar energy harvesting. For real-world applications, it is also important to note that performance and cost need to be balanced for economic viability.

2.2. Substrate materials
After the validation of integrating supporting substrates for enhanced solar evaporation, bilayer solar evaporators have been widely explored for solar steam generation. Generally, the bottom layer provides a mechanically stable support, thermal management, and water transportation to the top solar absorber layer. Thermal management is essential for high efficiency of solar steam generation. When the temperature of the solar absorber layer rises upon light irradiation, the heat loss by thermal radiation, convection and conduction to a surrounding medium occurs, which significantly lowers the evaporation efficiency. To avoid the large thermal loss in a conventional bulk heating apparatus (Fig. 4A), a floating solar absorber layer has been constructed for interfacial evaporation (Fig. 4B). For example, a thin film formed by self-assembly of gold nanoparticles, carbon nanoparticles incorporated with iron oxide or magnetic microspheres floating at the interface of water and air have been used, yielding an evaporation rate much higher than that of bulk heating by dispersing photothermal agents in the whole reservoir.43,60,109 Although the interfacial heating solar evaporation utilizes thermal energy more efficiently, heat conduction from the hot zone to the underlying bulk water lowers the steam generation performance. To further mitigate the heat loss from the photothermal layer to the underlying bulk water, substrates acting as heat barriers can be utilized, which confine the thermal energy to the evaporative surface and improve the steam generation efficiency (Fig. 4C). Chen and co-workers developed a double-layer solar steam generator consisting of graphite layers as solar absorbers and carbon foam as a thermally insulating substrate (Fig. 4E–G).21 The carbon foam had low thermal conductivity, which suppressed thermal dissipation from the hot surface region (Fig. 4K). The carbon foam also reduced the contact area between the water and the hot zone, which further confined the heat to the evaporative surface. After the incorporation of the thermal insulator, the efficiency of the solar evaporators increased from 65% to 85% under 10 sun irradiation (power density of 10 kW m−2) (Fig. 4H–J). This pioneering work has attracted wide attention for the design of substrates with good thermal insulation to improve solar steam generation.

Besides the thermal management, another important consideration for substrates is supplying sufficient water to the solar absorber layers for evaporation. Water transportation relies on capillary force, so that the substrate is usually constructed into an interconnected porous structure to provide sufficient channels for water pumping. The capillary force is determined by the wetting properties of the pores and the pore size. To further facilitate water transportation, the water flow channel is usually designed with hydrophilic materials. Ideal substrates can wick enough water to the photothermal layer to convert heat to vapor and provide excellent thermal insulation simultaneously. Below, we summarize recent progress in substrate materials with superior thermal insulation and water transportation abilities.
Synthetic polymers such as polystyrene (PS),96,110 polyurethane (PU),111–113 and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)114,115 are excellent choices for supporting layers because their low thermal conductivity, commercially availability, and low density make them float on the water surface (Fig. 5B). With simple physical or chemical approaches, photothermal materials can be readily deposited on synthetic polymer layers to generate a bilayered solar evaporator (Fig. 5A). Despite their facile design and preparation, synthetic polymers barely satisfy the increasing structural and material requirements for supporting layers on the nano- or micro-scale.

Inorganic materials with hierarchical porous structures, low thermal conductivity, high aqueous stability, and low light absorption have been exploited as supporting substrates for solar evaporators (Fig. 6). Nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) is an attractive candidate as a supporting material for loading photothermal materials due to its low thermal conductivity and columnar pores that can maximize the interaction between light and photothermal materials.40,48,49,116,117 The hierarchical pores serve as channels for water transportation as well as templates for loading solar absorbers in the upper regions. For example, Au nanoparticles (Fig. 6A) and Al nanoparticles were deposited on a nanoporous template (NPT), and this porous plasmonic membrane enabled over 96% light absorption and over 90% steam generation efficiency under concentrated light.40,49 The merit of the AAO membrane is its fine control over the sizes and periodicity of the pores, achieved by various techniques. Padilla and co-workers employed a pore-widening technique to make a vertically aligned nanowire array by wet etching the ordered hexagonal nanopores of an AAO membrane. Subsequent drying resulted in self-aggregated nanowire bundles, which possessed varying nanoscale gaps as well as microscale funnel structures (Fig. 6B).48 After a black Au film was deposited on the bundles, the plasmonic membrane with a multiscale porous structure achieved an evaporation efficiency of 57% under a light intensity of 20 kW m−2. Other substrate materials have also been explored. Hydrophilic microporous silica substrates with low thermal conductivity have been demonstrated to offer water pumping, thermal insulation, and mechanical support for a thin layer of CNTs serving as a photothermal layer, and this bilayered evaporator achieved a solar thermal efficiency of 82% (Fig. 6C).100 Considering the high temperature caused by photothermal materials under light exposure, a thermally stable substrate formed using ultralong hydroxyapatite (HA) nanowires (Fig. 6F) was employed to support CNTs for solar steam generation (Fig. 6E).118 The intrinsic low thermal conductivity reduced heat loss from the solar absorbers to the bulk water, and the interconnected porous network from the hydroxyapatite nanowire (HN) paper allowed sufficient water transportation (Fig. 6D). This fire-resistant HN/CNT photothermal paper achieved an efficiency of 83.2% under 1 sun irradiation.

The usage and disposal of supporting layers made of hazardous or non-biodegradable materials can have a significant negative impact on aqueous environmental systems. Thus, cellulose-based supporting materials, which are renewable, biodegradable, and scalable, hold great promise for future solar evaporation systems (Fig. 7). Commercially available air-laid paper with low thermal conductivity, excellent hydrophilicity, and microscale pores is a convenient material for a supporting substrate.34,119–121 Its high surface roughness enables easy modification with photothermal materials, such as rGO, Au nanoparticles, and Ag nanoparticles, to assemble simple solar evaporators (Fig. 7A). However, mechanical strength and aqueous stability limit air-laid papers to achieve robust and scalable solar evaporators.

Cellulose foam, formed via bottom-up bio-fabrication (BNC foam, realized by bacteria-mediated growth) or templated fabrication, has been demonstrated to be a highly promising substrate for solar evaporation.10,22,56,67,90 Singamaneni and co-workers have developed and demonstrated a novel, scalable approach for realizing BNC bilayered foams, with the top layer incorporating various photothermal materials (rGO, MoS2, Au nanoparticles, and even biodegradable PDA particles) and the bottom layer made of pristine BNC (Fig. 7B). As a supporting layer, cellulose foam presents low thermal conductivity, nano- or micro-scale porosity, excellent hydrophilicity, and aqueous stability, ensuring high performance in solar evaporators.
Inspired by the transpiration of trees, which relies on a distinctive porous structure to transport mass and heat, natural wood has been used to construct wood-based interfacial evaporators (Fig. 7C).41,66,97,103,122 Significantly, natural wood, composed mostly of cellulose, has (i) a hydrophilic columnar microchannel network (Fig. 7E), allowing fast water transport; and (ii) excellent thermal insulation properties, ensuring heat localization. Moreover, wood-based solar evaporators can be readily realized by integrating photothermal materials, such as GO, Au nanostructures, and CNTs. Alternatively, simple carbonization of the wood surface produces photothermal properties (Fig. 7D). All these traits suggest that wood is a very attractive candidate as a supporting substrate for solar evaporators.123
Generally, intricate design and development of supporting layers with desired properties such as thermal management, water transportation, and porous structures have fostered the development of high-performance solar evaporation devices. To enable broad application of the interfacial solar evaporation technology, the utilization of renewable, environmentally friendly, scalable materials is an important consideration for the design of future solar evaporation systems.
3. Structural optimization
Advances in the design and synthesis of nanomaterials have played a critical role in the development of solar steam generators. Simultaneously, nano- or micro-fabrication has enabled rational structural designs for solar absorbers and substrates, which further boost light capture and mitigate thermal loss to the environment. Below, we discuss the evolution in the structure of solar absorbers and supporting substrates towards high-performance solar evaporators.
3.1. Structural optimization of solar absorbers for efficient energy harvesting
An optimal structure of solar absorbers at nano- and micro-scales is important to improve light and heat trapping. In most current solar evaporators, the photothermal layers are designed to be sufficiently thick to ensure negligible light transmission. At the same time, minimizing reflection is also critical to achieving high optical absorption. The refractive index of most photothermal materials is higher than 2, so their light reflection is greater than 11% according to the Fresnel equation.124 To reduce light reflection, the solar absorber is generally processed into a nano- or micro-porous structure.125 As light travels through this porous structure, it undergoes multiple reflections inside the walls of the pores, which maximizes light absorption by the material and consequent heat generation (Fig. 8). In addition, light absorption by a flat surface exhibits strong dependence on the angle of the incident light.126 Photothermal layers with nano- and micro-porous structures exhibit significantly smaller angular dependences of optical absorption and can absorb light over a wide range of incident angles.
 Fig. 8  Schematic illustration depicting light's interaction with solar absorbers, and the corresponding light-to-heat conversion and heat loss under solar illumination. 
After absorbing the incident light, photothermal materials convert the light to thermal energy. Ideally, the solar absorber should utilize all the heat to evaporate the seawater or wastewater. However, heat loss by conduction and radiation occurs, arising from the much higher temperature of the photothermal layer compared to the surroundings (bulk water and external environment). To suppress the thermal loss, 3D macroscopic solar absorbers (e.g., 3D origami, cups, and cylinders) offer a compelling strategy of enhancing energy harvesting for fast steam generation.102,126,127 The elaborately designed geometry creates a temperature gradient along the evaporative surface, so heat flows from hotter regions to cooler regions and recovers heat loss. Radiated heat from the lower region can be reabsorbed by the upper region, which further mitigates thermal dissipation. Moreover, the temperature of a partially evaporative surface can be even lower than that of the atmosphere, which allows energy acquisition from the environment. By reducing heat loss and harvesting environmental energy, 3D macroscopic solar absorbers achieve much higher evaporation efficiency than conventional planar solar absorbers.

3.1.1. Enhanced solar absorption. 
During light interactions with solar absorbers, reflection causes major light loss. Constructing a 3D microporous structure is a typical route to improve light capture. The internal pores favor light reflection within the materials and thus increase light absorption. For this reason, solar absorbers are generally processed into 3D microporous structures. For example, a compact rGO film with a smooth surface exhibited high reflectance, with a light absorption of only around 40% (Fig. 9A). In contrast, an rGO membrane with an open porous structure exhibited over 93% light absorption (Fig. 9B).77

A common approach to assemble 3D microporous solar absorbers is a template-assisted method. For example, Al nanoparticles deposited on a 3D porous aluminum oxide membrane absorbed over 96% of a broad solar spectrum (Fig. 9C–G).40 Similarly, a CNT coated porous cellulose nanofibril aerogel achieved an absorbance of 97.5%.67 Graphene foam fabricated by chemical vapor deposition on a 3D porous nickel skeleton also exhibited 90% light absorption.71
In addition to these rigid substrates, solvents can also serve as soft templates for fabricating 3D microporous solar absorbers. After dispersing the solar absorbers in the solvent, the mixtures are frozen, and the resultant solvent crystals act as templates to organize the solar absorbers. Inorganic or organic binding agents are also added if the intrinsic interaction among solar absorbers is not strong. After evaporating the solvent, the 3D porous structures are formed. For example, a rGO-based aerogel was fabricated by freeze-drying GO solution with the aid of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (Fig. 9H and I). It exhibited high light absorption over the entire solar spectrum, with a negligible optical loss.69 These 3D microstructures enhance the light harvesting, overcoming the intrinsic reflectance of solar absorbers. Future research should focus on constructing these 3D porous solar absorbers on a large scale and at a cost low enough for real-world applications.


3.1.2. Enhanced thermal energy harvesting. 
Current methods to increase the thermal energy output from solar absorbers mainly rely on improving light absorption. However, for conventional planar solar absorbers, the resultant high temperature of the evaporating layer inevitably causes thermal energy loss to the surrounding environment, which lowers the evaporation efficiency. Recently, 3D macroscopic solar absorbers have been proposed to mitigate radiative and convective heat loss. Furthermore, well-designed architectures for solar absorbers could even gain energy from the surroundings, allowing an evaporation efficiency close to or even nominally higher than 100%.
For example, using Miura-ori tessellation, Wang and co-workers reported an innovative solar evaporator with an origami structure composed of folded and unfolded periodic pleats (Fig. 10A and B).121 The 3D concave structure not only improves light absorption by offering multiple reflections on the evaporative surface, but also mitigates thermal loss. Under illumination, the temperature of valley folds was higher than that of mountain folds (Fig. 10D), and this temperature gradient resulted in a directional thermal flow from the hotter valley folds to the cooler mountain folds, that enabled the partial recovery of dissipated heat loss. Moreover, the radiative heat from the valley folds could be reabsorbed by the mountain parts. Therefore, the efficiency of the 3D origami structure reached approximately 100% when the ratio of Aactive (light interactive area)/Aproject (light projected area) was around 4.65 (Fig. 10C). The planar counterpart showed an efficiency of only 71%, associated with convection and radiation losses of 10.9% and 13.5%, respectively. The same group also designed a 3D cylindrical cup-shaped solar evaporator, using mixed metal oxides as photothermal materials.127 The high energy efficiency, reaching nearly 100% under 1 sun irradiation, was closely related to the 3D cup structure, as the wall of the cup effectively reabsorbed the reflected light and thermal radiation from the bottom of the cup and also gained extra energy from the environment, because the lip of the wall was cooler than the environment.

An elaborate 3D macroscopic structure not only suppresses thermal energy loss to the surroundings, but also favors directly obtaining energy from the environment. Zhu and co-workers designed a cylindrical vapor generator with a height of 10 cm and a diameter of 5.7 cm (Fig. 10E).102 With light illumination, a higher temperature was noted on the top surface compared with the environment, whereas the side surface was cooler than the atmosphere because of less absorption of solar energy (Fig. 10F) and evaporative cooling effects. Thus, the side surface of the solar absorber harvested energy from the environment by convective and radiative heat transfer processes (Fig. 10G–K). Combining the solar energy input and extra energy gained from the environment, the efficiency of this smart structure was beyond the theoretical limit value of 100% solar-to-vapor energy transfer efficiency.
These unique 3D macroscopic solar absorbers, by reducing thermal dissipation and harvesting energy from their surroundings, surpass the energy efficiency of conventional 2D configurations and provide design guidelines for high-performance solar evaporators. Besides their outstanding efficiency, these macroscopic configurations were assembled with inexpensive materials using cost-effective processing methods. However, large-scale fabrication of these 3D macroscopic structures and their mechanical stability under harsh real-world environmental conditions such as wind and rain are challenging.

3.2. Advanced substrate design for efficient thermal management and water transportation
As noted above, thermal insulation and water transportation are two fundamental requirements for substrates. Substrates should supply plenty of water to the hot zone for steam generation. However, too much water to the evaporative layer leads to thermal loss via heat conduction and thus lowers the heat confinement. To further improve the solar evaporation efficiency beyond those offered by the traditional designs discussed above, outstanding substrates need to achieve a balance between thermal insulation and water transportation (Fig. 4K).
In addition, salt accumulation on the evaporative surface should be taken into account as it decreases water transportation and optical properties.128,129 3–3.5% dissolved salts, such as NaCl and CaCl2, exist in seawater.130 Solute concentrations increase significantly in the heating zone after water evaporation, and subsequently precipitated salt aggregates at the evaporative surface when solute concentrations saturate. The accumulated salt hampers the solar absorption because of light reflection by the salt layer, and also reduces the water supply to the evaporative surface by blocking water pathways, both of which lower the evaporation efficiency. Periodic physical cleaning increases the operational cost for the solar evaporators and poses difficulty for a large-scale operation. Developing salt-resistant structures is imperative to achieve long-term steady desalination.

3.2.1. 1D/2D water pathway configurations. 
To resolve the trade-off between heat management and water transportation, reduced dimensionality of water pathways mitigates the thermal conduction loss while maintaining sufficient capillary force to facilitate water transportation. Instead of a 3D random and interconnected microporous configuration, substrates with 1D or 2D water pathways simultaneously allow excellent thermal insulation and water transportation.96,104,110,126,130,131 Unlike conventional substrate design where the thermal insulation layer and water pathways are constructed together, the thermal insulator and water supplier are two independent components in 1D/2D water pathway configurations. The hydrophilic water supplying layer directly contacts the solar absorber layer and water can only be transported through the confined hydrophilic pathways. At the same time, the thermal insulating layer separates the photothermal layer from bulk water and its low thermal conductivity can further preserve the thermal energy of solar absorbers.
Recently, a solar evaporator with 2D water pathways was developed (Fig. 11B).96 Upon floating on water, the hydrophilic cellulose paper wrapped on the surface of PS foam got wet first and then water was pumped up to contact the top GO film for evaporation by capillary forces. PS foam physically separated the solar absorber layer from the bulk water, and the water transportation was confined within the 2D cellulose paper. Although the water contact area was reduced, the GO film could be fed with a sufficient amount of water through the cellulose paper. The low thermal conductivity of PS foam (∼0.04 W m−1 K−1) effectively prevented the thermal conduction of heat from the evaporative surface to the bulk water. In this 2D water pathway design, owing to the balance between the thermal insulation and water transportation, the efficiency of solar steam generation reached up to 80% under 1 sun illumination. Another solar evaporator with a 2D water pathway consisted of carbon coated paper affixed to an expanded PS foam, and it displayed a high efficiency of up to 88% under non-concentrated light irradiation of 1 kW m−2.131

Solar steam generators with 1D water pathways were also suggested to further decrease the water contact area. Hu and co-workers developed a jellyfish-like solar evaporator comprising of porous carbon black/GO as a solar absorber and expanded PS foam with vertically aligned GO pillars as a substrate.110 The water transportation was confined to the 1D vertically aligned microchannels within these GO pillars. Combined with the low thermal conductivity of the PS matrix, which preserved the thermal energy for steam generation, the solar evaporation efficiency reached up to 87.5% under light irradiation of 1 kW m−2. Zhu and co-workers developed a solar evaporator with 3D conical GO films as solar absorbers and a cotton rod as the 1D water pathway.126 This thermal management enabled a high efficiency of up to 85% under light irradiation of 1 kW m−2. The same group carbonized a mushroom (Fig. 11E, H and I), and its umbrella-shaped black pileus enabled efficient solar absorption and strong evaporation (Fig. 11F).104 The fibrous stem with a small cross section enabling efficient water supply confined the water path in a quasi-1D manner and led to the minimization of heat loss (Fig. 11G). The supporting PS foam with a low thermal conductivity separated the solar absorber layer from the bulk water, mitigating thermal loss. This carbonized biomass utilized the intrinsic structures and achieved a high solar conversion efficiency of 78% under 1 sun illumination.
The common feature for these 1D/2D water pathway configurations is that the water transportation part is separated from the supporting substrates to reduce the contact areas of the evaporative surfaces with water. The water pathways are constructed from hydrophilic materials to provide adequate water for evaporation, and a thermal insulator separates the solar absorber from bulk water to allow heat confinement. Therefore, an optimal balance between water supply and thermal insulation is achieved.


3.2.2. Salt-rejection systems for desalination. 
Recently, several novel designs have been reported for long-term antifouling desalination.55,83,130,132–136 The main mechanism is to either prompt multidirectional diffusion or prevent the accumulation of salt on the evaporative layer. For conventional solar evaporators, water is continuously pumped by the bottom layer to the top hot layer, and salt gradually aggregates on the evaporative surface under this one-way diffusion. Multidirectional mass transfer on the evaporative layer can drive the dissolution of salt back to bulk water.
To alleviate salt clogging of the evaporative layer, Chen and co-workers fabricated a floating system, enabling horizontal mass transfer along the solar absorber layer (Fig. 12A).130 The insulating structure was made from a white cellulose fabric and alternating expanded PS foam (Fig. 12C), which were responsible for water transportation and thermal insulation, respectively. The structure of the hydrophilic white fabric combined with the hydrophilic upper photothermal layer boosted in-plane diffusion on the evaporative surface and thus the dissolution of the concentrated salt back to the bulk water (Fig. 12B and E). There was no salt formed on the solar evaporator after working for 7 days, but the evaporation efficiency was only around 57% in 3.5% NaCl simulated seawater under 1 sun illumination, arising from the reflective light loss of 15% from the wetted solar absorber.

To achieve high light absorption and salt rejection simultaneously, a wood-based solar evaporator comprised of an array of channels for multidirectional mass transfer was reported (Fig. 12F).134 Upon solar evaporation, the drilled millimeter-scale channels had a higher water flux than the intrinsic micron-size wood channels, which resulted in a lower salt concentration in the drilled channels than that in the microchannels (Fig. 12G). This in-plane concentration gradient drove the dissolution of salt in the drilled channels back to the bulk water. The steam generation efficiency of this self-regenerating evaporator remained constant at 75% during continuous testing for 100 hours in 20 wt% NaCl solution under 1 sun illumination and no salt accumulation was observed (Fig. 12I), whereas a thick layer of salt was formed on the carbonized wood without drilled channels after 6 hours of operation and its performance was significantly degraded (Fig. 12H).
Besides improving the mass transfer on the evaporative surface, a Janus structure with a hydrophobic solar absorber layer and a hydrophilic water pathway can be an effective salt-rejecting design. Within this structure, water is pumped to contact the hot zone for steam formation, but salts cannot accumulate on the upper hot layer due to its hydrophobic nature. As a result, salts can only crystallize at the interface of the solar absorber and substrate, which can be quickly dissolved by the continuously wicking water from the water pathways.
A salt-resistant Janus membrane was fabricated with a carbon black (CB) nanoparticle coating on a hydrophobic polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) layer for light absorption and hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as the bottom layer for water pumping.136 Owing to the presence of the hydrophobic PMMA layer, the salt formation was localized at the interface of CB/PMMA and PAN layers, and was removed consequently by the wicking water. After testing in saline water for 16 days, no salt accumulation was observed on the Janus membrane and the performance remained constant. However, the efficiency was only around 52% under 1 sun illumination because of insufficient thermal insulation.
To improve the efficiency, Que and co-workers incorporated the Janus structure with a thermal insulator. An MXene was employed as the solar absorber and trimethoxy(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl)silane modification converted its intrinsic hydrophilic surface to be hydrophobic. The evaporator was comprised of a hydrophobic MXene membrane, a hydrophilic nonwoven fabric and a supporting PS foam (Fig. 12J).135 During membrane operation in a saline environment, no salt accumulation was detected on the hydrophobic MXene surface (Fig. 12K) and the steam generation efficiency was 71% under 1 sun irradiation and did not decay over 200 hours. In contrast, a huge amount of salt deposited on a hydrophilic MXene membrane and solar evaporating performance greatly deteriorated over time. Overall, the Janus structure can reduce the crystallization of salt on the evaporative surface.137,138
Although these reported structures successfully alleviate concerns regarding salt-clogging in saline environments, their evaporation efficiencies are consistently lower compared to interfacial evaporators with optimal thermal management strategies. For the structures enabling enhanced mass transfer on an evaporative surface, the improved diffusion also results in increased thermal loss from the hot zone to the bulk water. In the Janus structures, less water can contact the hydrophobic solar absorbers for vapor generation. These factors contribute to compromised evaporation efficiency for the salt-rejection designs. Hence, further improvement of the thermal management and water transportation in anti-fouling evaporators is required to achieve higher evaporation efficiency.

Water collection is an essential part of photothermal-enhanced water purification, considering that production of freshwater is the ultimate goal. A poor design of a water collector can significantly lower the evaporation efficiency. In most of the reported studies, the performance of the solar evaporator is analyzed by calculating the evaporating rates in open air. However, it does not fully represent the freshwater generation capability of the solar evaporators. Without effective water collection systems, water generation rates are low as increased humidity and condensed water droplets lower the evaporation rates of solar steam generators. However, most of the studies do not include a water collection system, due to the difficulty in designing efficient water collectors. Only very recently, some researchers have integrated water collection systems with their solar evaporating system to validate freshwater generation under real outdoor conditions. These developments are in preliminary stages and a comprehensive quantitative analysis of freshwater generation efficiency is still missing.83 Not surprisingly, a few studies indicate that the evaporation efficiency decreases after the incorporation of water collectors.84,131,139,140 In these studies, the efficiency of water collection from vapor is low, because highly humid environments and compromised optical absorbance after vapor condensation in the water collector deteriorate the evaporation. Comprehensive studies about designing water collectors for solar evaporation are still rare.
Recently, surfaces with precisely tailored wettability have been demonstrated to achieve directional water collection from a humid environment and fast water collection from vapor, showing great potential for realizing water collection for solar evaporators. Directional water collection is comprised of three steps: condensation, coalescence, and transportation, which are significantly affected by the wettability of materials.141 Moreover, vapor condensation is classified into two categories: film-wise condensation (FWC) and dropwise condensation (DWC) depending on the morphology of water droplets.142,143 FWC occurs when the vapor condenses on a hydrophilic surface and a continuous thin film forms, whereas discrete droplets with size ranging from micrometers to millimeters generate when condensing on the hydrophobic surface.144 The amount of heat exchange during condensation is very high and DWC exhibits lower heat transfer resistance than FWC, and hence DWC is a preferred mode for condensation.145 Water droplets grow by coalesce with the neighboring droplets and are removed by an external force, such as gravity, after reaching a certain size. Good water collectors enable the directional movement of water droplets to expedite their growth and transportation. Although water droplets inevitably scatter solar light, the excellent water collector allows fast transportation that can mitigate the negative effects. Moreover, fast condensation by DWC can avoid the high humidity built-up within the water collector, which ensures good evaporation performance. Therefore, high-efficiency water collection can be achieved only with fine control of both physical and chemical surface properties.
Current water collectors in solar steam generation are generally comprised of a chamber with a transparent and tilted roof.58 The solar evaporator is located at the bottom of the chamber and the whole solar distillation device floats on the water (Fig. 13). With sunlight exposure, the generated vapor condenses into water droplets on the roof of the chamber. The tilted cover can guide the transportation of water droplets to be collected. Wang and co-workers designed a self-floating solar distillation device, consisting of a light transparent plastic wall and cover (Fig. 13A).83 The evaporating chamber and condensing chamber were connected by the upper part, but separated by a division in the bottom. Upon sunlight irradiation, the solar absorber layer, at the bottom of the evaporating chamber, evaporated the seawater. A solar-powered electrical fan equipped in the evaporating chamber could generate an air flow field and thus drive the water vapor into a condensing chamber to generate freshwater (Fig. 13B). In addition, the bottom of the condensing chamber was directly in contact with bulk water, which served as a cold source to expedite the condensation of vapor. The water generation rate of this solar distillation device was 0.15 kg m−2 h−1. However, this work did not mention the input solar energy to the system, so that the capability of the device to purify water cannot be fully evaluated.

Ho and co-workers assembled a pyramid solar distillation cell and validated purification of water under natural sunlight conditions.139 The pyramid model was constructed from transparent acrylic boards with a carbon sponge (CS) as the solar evaporator located at the bottom and troughs on the sides connected with a water collection bag (Fig. 13C and D). After placing it on a lake under sunlight, steam condensed on the pyramid cover and water flowed into the collection troughs (Fig. 13E). The maximum freshwater generation productivity was calculated to be 0.34 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun illumination. However, without the water collector, the water evaporation rate was 1.15 kg m−2 h−1, which was three times higher compared to the water collection rate. The difference was attributed to the deteriorated evaporation performance after integrating the water collector in the solar distillation cell. The water collection occurs in the sealed space, so the humidity is much higher than the open-air condition. It has been reported that the evaporation rate would decrease linearly with the increase of humidity.146 Furthermore, when the vapor condenses on the cover, the resultant water droplets block the incident solar flux to the solar absorber (Fig. 13F). Without fast transportation of these water droplets for collection, solar light is less available for steam generation. Hence, careful structural design and materials selection should be made to accelerate the water collection from the vapor.
Water sorbents can be used for vapor absorption over a wide range of humidity values. Silica gels, zeolites, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are three types of the most well-explored water sorbents.147 Zeolites and silica gels exhibit hydrophilic absorption behaviors. For silica gels, water molecules are absorbed on the surface via forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl of silanol groups, so that the presence of silanol groups governs the water uptake capability.148 Zeolites are a class of crystalline aluminosilicate materials, and their high affinity to water molecules is attributed to the electrostatically charged framework and the abundance of extra-framework cations. Chemical structures to increase active sites have been optimized to enhance the water absorption. An alternative method to produce more active sites is tuning the geometry of pores. However, these two kinds of materials still suffer from a relatively low water uptake. The zeolites require a high temperature, more than 200 °C, to desorb water for collection. Owing to their extraordinary specific surface area and calibrated pore size, MOFs exhibit superior vapor absorption and attract intensive attention.149,150 The water uptake occurs via reversibly filling pores or irreversible capillary condensation in the center of pores.151 Depending on the pore size, pore structure, chemical components, and functional groups, the water absorption behavior of MOFs is diverse. However, due to the periodic thermal energy input requirement, it is difficult to employ these materials as water sorbents in solar evaporators. Generally, the water uptake of water sorbents occurs at room temperature, and subsequently heat treatment is employed to release the water. Cyclic heating and cooling significantly increase the difficulty in utilizing water sorbents for water collection in solar steam generators. Furthermore, a condenser is required to capture the released water vapor from the sorbents, which makes the water collection more complicated for the solar evaporator. Below, we further discuss advanced water collectors in terms of their performance, mechanisms and design principles.
4.1. Bio-inspired design to boost water collection
In nature, animals and plants have evolved biological structures to survive in arid environments.152,153 These biological structures exhibit unique surface features that are uniquely tailored to collect water from limited resources under harsh environmental conditions. Analyzing and learning from the structures and surface chemistries of these creatures in nature, researchers have designed biomimetic materials to enable efficient water collection.154 Below, we introduce three attractive models in nature, namely spider silk, desert beetles and cacti, for water collection, and review recent developments in related bio-inspired materials.

4.1.1. Spider silk fiber. 
Spider silk fiber has an excellent directional water collection capability, which is attributed to the periodic spindle-knot and joint structure after wetting (Fig. 14A–I).155 Upon placing in mist, water starts to condense, and then the puffs on the fiber shrink into bumps, which eventually form periodic spindle-knots with continuous condensation (Fig. 14A and B). The wetted spider silk fiber consists of alternating spindle-knots and joints with a diameter of 21 μm and 6 μm, respectively, and with a periodicity of ∼90 μm (Fig. 14K). For water collection processes, water condenses on the joints first and is subsequently transported to spindle-knots after droplets grow. The directional water movement relies on the structure-induced wettability gradient and difference in Laplace pressure. Although the chemical composition of the spindle-knots and joints is the same, the rougher surface morphology for the spindle-knots (Fig. 14L and M) makes them more hydrophilic than the joints (Fig. 14N and O), thus driving the water droplets moving from the less hydrophilic domains (joints) to the more hydrophilic domains (spindle-knots). The two oppositely curved and connected conical sites located at the center and edge of the spindle-knot offer a non-equilibrium Laplace pressure difference (Fig. 14J), which moves the water droplets from the joints to the spindle-knots. For the silkworm silk fiber whose surface is smooth, the water collection efficiency is significantly lower.

Jiang and co-workers pioneered the spider silk-inspired fiber for water collection. Artificial fibers resembling the structure of wetted spider silk were fabricated for fast directional water collection by dip coating (Fig. 14P).156 A thin PMMA film was coated on a nylon fiber and then broke into alternating droplets after drying due to Rayleigh instability. The artificial fiber had a periodicity of 400 μm, and the diameter of spindle-knots and joints was 44 μm and 14 μm, respectively. The fabrication was also implemented on a large scale; a PMMA-knotted nylon fiber was demonstrated by fluid coating (Fig. 14Q), and PMMA-knotted PS fiber and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-knotted PS fibers were demonstrated using electrospinning/electrospraying methods (Fig. 14R).157–159 After their exposure to moist environments, superior water condensation and directional water collection were successfully demonstrated on these bio-mimic fibers.


4.1.2. Desert beetles. 

Stenocara beetles are capable of living in the Namib desert, one of the most arid areas of the world, because they have unique surface structures on their back enabling water collection from fog-laden wind (Fig. 15A).160–162 The bumpy back surface is comprised of hydrophilic bumps distributed on the superhydrophobic matrix (Fig. 15B and C). In the morning, beetles face the wind with their tilted body to capture small water droplets from the fog. Water droplets firstly accumulate on the hydrophilic bumps after contacting. After the size of accumulated water droplets reaches a critical volume, the gravitational force overcomes the binding force in the hydrophilic region. Big water droplets detach from the bump and roll down to the beetle's mouth through the hydrophobic background.

Inspired by Stenocara beetles, a variety of hydrophilic–hydrophobic micropatterned surfaces have been designed to achieve directional water collection.152,163–165 A pulsed laser deposition approach with a square-patterned stainless-steel mesh as the mask was adopted to construct the array of superhydrophilic Pt squares on the superhydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface (Fig. 15D).166 Water collection involved three steps: (i) small droplets firstly condensed immediately on the Pt-coated superhydrophilic squares after exposure to water vapor; (ii) the water droplets coalesced with the neighboring ones and accumulated to form bigger droplets; and (iii) when the size of the water droplets reached a critical value, the gravitational force caused them to roll down and be collected with concomitant removal of the droplets along the path, releasing the area for condensation (Fig. 15E). The square pattern with a side length of 50 μm on the superhydrophobic substrate exhibited a maximum water collection rate of 0.053 kg m−2 h−1, which was higher than that of the PDMS coated-superhydrophobic surface and Pt-nanoparticle coated superhydrophilic surface, 0.03 kg m−2 h−1 and 0.04 kg m−2 h−1, respectively.
To further augment the directional water collection, an array of straight hydrophilic micro-tracks on a superhydrophobic silicon substrate was fabricated by stencil lithography (Fig. 15F).167 After condensing on the hydrophobic regions, water droplets directionally migrated to the nearby hydrophilic tracks because of the difference in wettability between the two domains. At the same time, the hydrophilic track acted as a fast transport pathway. The water droplets on the hydrophilic track would be accumulated into one bulge, which was driven by the Laplace pressure difference. These two kinds of directional movements contributed to the outstanding water collection performance of the hybrid surface (Fig. 15G). The highest efficiency of 0.3 kg m−2 h−1 was observed on the substrate micropatterned with a hydrophilic track with a width and spacing distance of 300 μm and 3000 μm, respectively, which was much higher than that of isotropically hydrophobic (0.14 kg m−2 h−1) and hydrophilic surfaces (0.07 kg m−2 h−1) (Fig. 15H).


4.1.3. Cacti. 
As a prevailing plant in the Chihuahua desert, Cactus O. microdasys possesses a unique structure of spines to capture water from fog (Fig. 16A). The needle-like spines grow on the hemispherical trichomes, and their length and diameter range from 800 μm to 2500 μm and 30 μm to 65 μm, respectively (Fig. 16B and C). The spines are comprised of different structural features (Fig. 16D): oriented barbs in the tip (Fig. 16E and H), gradient grooves in the middle (Fig. 16G), and belt-structured trichomes in the base (Fig. 16F).168 After placing in mist, water droplets can gradually grow on the spines and move from the tip to the base (Fig. 16I), even if the tip is pointed down (Fig. 16L). The efficient water collection depends on the gradient of Laplace pressure and wettability along the spines (Fig. 16J). The density of microgrooves on the tip of spines is higher than that on the base, which makes the tip more hydrophobic, and thus water droplets collected on the tip move to the base by the surface-energy difference. The gradually decreasing curvature from the tip to the base of spines causes the Laplace pressure at the tip to be larger than that at the base (Fig. 16K), which is another reason for the directional motion of water droplets.

Cacti spine-like conical micro-tip patterns were fabricated to mimic the high performance of water harvesting.169 In order to overcome the limited-scale fabrication of conventional template-assisted methods,170 a cacti-mimicking patch was fabricated on a large scale with magnetic particle-assisted molding (Fig. 16O).171 A mixture of magnetic particles (MPs) with PDMS was exposed to a magnetic field, and MPs tended to arrange along the magnetic field (Fig. 16M). Driven by the polymer-induced capillary force, the binding of the preformed primary arrays led to a micro-needle pattern on the surface (Fig. 16N). Once exposed to mist, a continuous and spontaneous transportation of water droplets was noted on the surface of the microtip (Fig. 16Q). The Laplace difference along the conical microtip could transport the water droplets from the tip to the base even with the pattern upside down (Fig. 16Q). A cacti-inspired water collector was fabricated by assembling these hydrophobic microtip patches on the surface of a hydrophilic cotton sphere (Fig. 16R). Water collected by the micro-tip array could be absorbed by the cotton matrix, which was subsequently stored in a container. Upon placing in fog with velocities of 20–30, 45–50 and 70 cm s−1 for 10 minutes, the cacti-inspired water collector captured 2 mL, 3 mL, and 5 mL water, respectively, whereas only 0.3 mL, 0.7 mL, and 2 mL water were collected with the bare cotton spherical water collector, respectively.
These biomimetic designs with tailored hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions enable water collection at significantly higher efficiency than purely hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces. The progress in biomimetic water collectors is expected to inspire researchers in the solar steam generation field to design efficient water collectors based on these principles and facilitate the real-world applications of solar evaporators. As noted above, fine control over the microscale structure and spatial control of the wettability are critical to enhance the vapor condensation, droplet coalescence, and water transportation. Moreover, to maximize the solar steam production and water collection, the design principles discussed above need to be carefully balanced with light transmission across the water collectors. We expect that in the next decade, water collectors in solar steam generators will undergo significant improvements to ultimately make solar steam generators a compelling technology for purifying water.

5. Water production cost analysis
To realize solar steam generation for water production, it is critical to understand the cost associated with producing water with solar steam generation using interfacial evaporator technologies. Recently, Chen and co-workers developed a low cost solar still to collect water generated by solar steam generation.130 Considering that solar steam generation aims to supply drinking water at a low cost, we took the cost of materials to estimate the water production cost by different solar evaporators. In addition to the cost associated with a solar evaporator, the cost for building a solar still is estimated to be ∼$1.7 per m2. The solar evaporator life span was assumed to be two years to calculate the cost, because the amount of foulant accumulated on the solar still during two years would not be high enough to cause it to sink in bulk water, according to a previous study.130 This represents a conservative estimate of the cost of the solar evaporator.31 In water collection, solar evaporation efficiency dropped significantly from 56% to 24% due to optical loss by water droplet forming on transparent windows.130 Most of the solar steam generation studies do not include the water collection efficiency, rather they provide only solar evaporation efficiency. We converted solar evaporation efficiency to water collection efficiency by multiplying the scale factor (0.43) calculated by dividing water collection efficiency by solar evaporation efficiency in Chen group's study.130 For cost analysis, solar evaporation efficiencies for different solar evaporators were converted to water collection efficiencies with the abovementioned scale factor.
For comparison, we chose one solar evaporator in each solar absorber section (plasmonic nanostructures, nanocarbon materials, and polymers). To avoid any price difference from supports, solar evaporators relying on cellulose supports were selected, and the unit price of cellulose supports is $9.2 per m2, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Also, we obtained the unit cost of raw photothermal materials from Sigma-Aldrich and determined the amount of materials employed for fabricating a solar evaporator. Finally, the total cost of a solar evaporator was estimated and is listed in Table 2.

To calculate the water production during the life span of a solar evaporator, we used the following equation:  where m is the water produced over two years, α (0.43) is the scaling factor to convert the evaporation efficiency to the water collection efficiency, η is the evaporation efficiency, E is the solar energy over two years, and ΔHlatent is the latent enthalpy for water. Considering the average daily solar irradiance to be around ∼5 kW h per m2 per day, we can calculate the amount of solar energy impinging on the solar evaporator over its estimated life period of two years. Considering the material cost for a solar evaporator and the produced water amount, we calculated the unit cost to produce clean water by solar steam generation (Table 2). Clearly, materials cost is important as it determines the feasibility of transiting technological advances to real-world application. Solar evaporation efficiency reached almost 90% for recently developed solar evaporators, indicating that there is not much room for improvement in terms of efficiency. On the other hand, more work is needed to improve the efficiency of water collection. In both cases, material cost and efficiency need to be considered to maximize the cost-to-benefit ratio of these devices.
6. Photothermal membrane distillation (PMD)
As we discussed above, solar evaporators have to address effective water collectors. To this end, integrating interfacial solar heating with membrane distillation can be a promising alternative approach. Vapor generation in PMD is similar to solar steam generation, which occurs at the water–air interface and relies on photothermal heating under solar illumination. The biggest difference is the structure of the evaporative interface. In solar evaporators, a photothermal membrane is placed on the surface of bulk water that needs to be purified. In the case of PMD, the interfacial structure is reversed, and thus the generated vapor moves in an opposite direction compared to the solar evaporator (Fig. 17A and B). The unique evaporative interface contributes to facile water collection for PMD.
 Fig. 17  Similarities and differences between solar steam generation and photothermal membrane distillation. 
MD is a thermally-driven membrane desalination process.172 In MD, the temperature difference between the hot feed water side and the cold distillate side results in a transmembrane temperature gradient, which generates a vapor pressure difference on the two sides of the membrane.173 The water can thus evaporate on the hot feed side to form vapor, which transports across the microporous and hydrophobic membrane, and condenses on the cold distillate side. In conventional MD, which uses hot feed water, the membrane surface temperature gradient (Ts,feed − Ts,distillate) is always less than the temperature difference between the bulk feed and distillate (Tb,feed − Tb,distillate). Such a phenomenon is known as temperature polarization,174 which impairs the overall MD performance via lowering the transmembrane temperature gradient and vapor flux.
In just the past two years, photothermal membrane distillation (PMD), which combines MD with solar-driven heating, has gained significant interest.30,175,176 In PMD, a hydrophobic membrane is modified with photothermal materials, which can harvest solar energy and generate localized heat on the membrane surface, thus facilitating a driving force for vapor transport (Fig. 18). The localized heating on the membrane surface can help to increase top membrane surface temperature (Ts,feed, green dotted line to red solid line), thereby alleviating temperature polarization effects on MD performance.36,108,177
 Fig. 18  Schematic illustration showing the mechanism of photothermal membrane distillation (PMD) and its effect on temperature polarization of conventional MD. 
6.1. PMD advantages and disadvantages
PMD shares most advantages of common MD configurations. PMD is operable at lower temperatures than boiling and lower pressures than RO, making it less energy intensive.178 The low hydrostatic pressure on membranes helps to minimize fouling problems, making PMD suitable for hypersaline or highly polluted wastewater.172 Most importantly, PMD uses solar energy, which is highly abundant, accessible, and sustainable, as the main energy source. The use of solar energy reduces the electricity input compared to conventional MD, making PMD highly suitable as a decentralized technique of clean water generation for household or remote areas.179 A high membrane surface temperature helps to reduce the temperature polarization effects. Meanwhile, PMD can be combined with low grade heat energy sources, such as waste heat from industrial plants, geothermal energy, or flow back water from unconventional oil and gas recovery systems.108 Moreover, compared with solar steam generation, which suffers from the lack of efficient clean water collection systems, PMD can easily collect purified water using distillate pumping, vacuum or air gap systems (Fig. 17B). The use of highly hydrophobic membranes in the PMD process leads to high salt rejection (commonly >99%) and minimizes the salt accumulation problems, which can potentially occur in solar steam generation. The shortcomings of current PMD systems include a low water generation rate as compared to other commercial pressure-driven filtration processes such as RO and ultrafiltration (UF). PMD application can also be challenging when treating highly turbid water because the penetration of sunlight to the membrane surface can be disrupted by particles in the water, thus requiring a pretreatment process as RO and UF processes need.
6.2. Recent materials research progress in PMD
In the past two years, significant progress has been made in both configuration design and membrane modification of PMD systems. Current PMD systems can be divided into four configurations: a passive MD without pumping systems (Fig. 19A), PMD in a direct contact membrane distillation system (Fig. 19B), PMD in a vacuum membrane distillation system (Fig. 19C), and PMD with multiple latent heat recovery systems (Fig. 19D). Fig. 19A depicts a PMD system without pumping systems, in which cold saline water is on top of the photothermal membrane. The vapor pressure difference across the membrane causes the vapor on the feed side of the membrane to penetrate the membrane and condense on the bottom device surface. Fujiwara and co-workers have demonstrated several PMD systems with such a configuration using anodized alumina membranes modified with azobenzene dyes.180–182 Such a configuration does not require external energy and thus is suitable for portable devices, although the clean water generation rate might be slow.

To increase the water flux, direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) configuration has been employed (Fig. 19B) in some recent studies.107,108,177 In 2017, a nanophotonics-enabled solar membrane distillation (NESMD) system was introduced.177 Using carbon black (CB) NP coated PVDF membranes, the PMD system generated a water flux of 0.22 kg m−2 h−1 under 0.7 kW m−2 with a solar conversion efficiency of 21.45%. Theoretical models showed that along the module, the NESMD system had increasing membrane surface temperature, ΔT across the membrane, and flux, while the MD system had degradation in these properties (Fig. 19E–G). The authors suggested that increasing the NESMD unit size would help increase its distillate flux. In addition, slower feed velocities, larger lengths and widths of the module, and higher ambient temperature can facilitate the NESMD performance. Li and co-workers also synthesized PMD membranes with CB nanoparticles and SiO2/Au nanoshells, and showed a water flux increase of up to 33.0% under 1 kW m−2 sunlight irradiation compared to dark conditions by using CB.107 However, this work utilized slightly heated water (35 °C) as the feed water, achieving a higher overall thermal efficiency (74.6%) compared to their previous work due to the lower conductive loss from the membrane surface to the feed water. Thus, the applicability of the efficiency with water at room temperature cannot be evaluated directly.
Recently, inspired from natural systems, Jun and co-workers synthesized a simple, stable, and scalable PDA-coated PVDF membrane for efficient solar-driven PMD in DCMD configuration (Fig. 19H).108 The PDA-coated PVDF membrane was modified to be hydrophobic via a facile fluoro-silanization method using (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-trichlorosilane (FTCS), leading to a water contact angle of 125.5°. The FTCS–PDA–PVDF membrane achieved a water flux of 0.49 kg m−2 h−1 (45% thermal efficiency) treating 0.5 M NaCl feed water solutions (20 °C) under 0.75 kW m−2 solar irradiation. This performance was attributed to the broad light absorption and outstanding photothermal conversion properties of PDA. In addition, the membrane showed great wetting resistance, high salt rejection (>99.9%), and chemical/mechanical robustness owing to the extremely stable underwater adhesion of PDA. In this work, they also showed that faster feed flow rates decreased the PMD performance (e.g., the permeate water flux) and thermal efficiency (Fig. 19I and J), which was attributed to more significant heat loss to the bulk feed water.
In another configuration, vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) has also been used because a vacuum system can facilitate vapor transport and collection in PMD (Fig. 19C).36 Politano and co-workers used silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as a photothermal material for PMD in a VMD system.36 Prepared by phase inversion methods, Ag NP loaded PVDF membranes achieved a high water flux (25.7 kg m−2 h−1) under UV irradiation, 11 fold higher than that of the membrane without Ag NPs.
To decrease heat loss and utilize heat more efficiently, new PMD modules were also developed via multiple latent-heat recovery systems (Fig. 19D). Zhou and co-workers recently developed a compact PMD system combining several layers of an evaporator (PVA sponge), MD membrane (PVDF–hexafluoropropylene (HFP)), and condenser.183 A commercial cermet-coated aluminum alloy substrate was used as the solar absorber. In this system, the latent heat from vapor condensation was recycled for further water evaporation. A system with two layers of PVDF–HFP membranes was demonstrated to achieve a water flux of 1.02 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 kW m−2 solar irradiation (72% solar efficiency). Chiavazzo and co-workers also reported a passive solar thermal distiller (does not require external energy),184 which also consisted of multiple evaporation/condensation layers. This system produced 1.24 kg m−2 h−1 under 0.7 kW m−2 solar illumination when tested outdoors in the summer in Torino, Italy.
New PMD membranes with novel materials continue to emerge from ongoing research efforts. For example, owing to their superb light absorption and photothermal conversion properties, two-dimensional (2D) materials have also been used in recent years for PMD, including MXenes185 and rGO.186 Chew and co-workers synthesized MXene-coated PVDF membranes, and demonstrated that the photothermal properties of MXenes were beneficial in conferring a 12% decrease in the energy consumed by the heater per unit volume of distillate.185 Jiang and co-workers coated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes with GO, rGO, and PDA–rGO, and showed that these membranes achieved 28.6%, 64.3%, and 78.6% water vapor flux increase, respectively, compared with the bare PTFE membranes in PMD performance.186 This better performance was attributed to the higher photothermal conversion efficiency of graphene-based materials and their low-friction pathways for the ultra-fast transport of water molecules.
In general, the materials selection of solar absorbers for PMD is similar to that of solar steam generation, which is based on broadband solar absorption and high light trapping. However, the photothermal materials for PMD applications require higher underwater adhesion and mechanical stability compared to solar steam generators. Such chemical and mechanical stability is critical to minimize the possibility of these materials getting released into the feed water or distillate, causing environmental concerns. Moreover, all membranes for PMD should possess high hydrophobicity to prevent the permeance of liquid water, and high porosity to allow vapor penetration and high water flux.
6.3. Challenges and future directions of PMD
PMD is a promising thermally-driven membrane-based desalination technique while it still faces many challenges. The cost of membrane synthesis and module designs should be lowered to meet the needs of widespread commercial applications. While PMD can target portable, modular, household, or decentralized applications due to low electricity input and easy operation, the development of advanced PMD membranes and devices is still necessary to help increase clean water generation rates and energy efficiency, thus eventually making PMD competitive with other currently available water treatment techniques and applicable in real applications.
7. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we discuss the recent research on materials for developing highly efficient solar evaporators, involving enhanced solar light harvesting, thermal management, water transportation, and water collection. Great strides have been made in the design and synthesis of advanced materials and optimal structures for the three key components of solar evaporators: solar absorbers, substrates, and water collectors (Fig. 20). This technology is a promising solution to alleviate water scarcity: it offers high energy efficiency, simplicity, and the possibility of utilizing renewable and environmentally friendly resources. While the merits of this technology have been extensively demonstrated, there are still multiple challenges to real world applications.
 Fig. 20  Summary of material choice and structural designs for the three key components for solar evaporators, based on the design principles discussed in this review. 
First, most current studies do not provide the analysis of cost or scalability of constructing the solar evaporators, so it is difficult to evaluate their actual potential for real-world implementation. The costs of materials, fabrication of interfacial evaporators, and lifetime maintenance need to be comparable to or lower than those of existing desalination and wastewater treatment techniques to facilitate the transition of the technology to real-world applications. In particular, scalability determines the competitiveness of these technologies in massive purification of wastewater or seawater. Future studies should focus more on developing energy efficient solar evaporators that can be easily scaled up with inexpensive materials and cost-effective processing methods.
Stability is also a key to long-term operation, but most studies do not provide a comprehensive insight into the robustness of interfacial evaporators in outdoor operation for an extended duration. The materials may degrade after interacting with salts and bacteria in river and seawater, and the structures may deteriorate upon exposure to sunlight, heat, wind, and rain. The deterioration of the evaporators leads to lower efficiency, and the disassembled products (often nanoscale materials with unknown toxicity) are a burden on the environment. Moreover, it increases the cost associated with the replacement, maintenance, and restoration. Thus, the long-term stability of solar evaporators under outdoor conditions should be fully evaluated. Complementary research efforts should also focus on developing robust solar evaporators that are chemically/mechanically/thermally stable in real-world applications.
Additionally, a more systematic study of the environmental effects on solar evaporators is needed. During outdoor operation, solar-driven evaporation will be affected by diverse factors, such as air pressure, humidity, temperature, and wind. These variables complicate comparisons of the outdoor performance of current solar evaporators across different laboratories. It is important to understand the effect of these environmental factors on solar evaporators and standardize the testing and reporting methods for objectively assessing the merits and shortcomings of interfacial evaporators using different materials and structures. As highlighted by Zhu and co-workers, standard testing methods and quantitative descriptors, such as indoor experimental parameters (e.g., ambient temperature, humidity, and wind speed), set-ups (e.g., size and uniformity of light spots on solar absorbers, distances of solar absorbers from beaker lips, beaker walls, and light sources), measurement techniques (e.g., accurate measurement of light intensities and evaporation temperatures), and performance evaluations (e.g., dark evaporations), should be established.187
While most previous reports highlight the efficiency of solar evaporation, they did not incorporate water collection into their systems or determine the freshwater production rates and efficiencies with water collection. Clearly, these factors are essential to compare solar evaporation technology with existing desalination technologies. Typically, studies merely measure the evaporation rate in an open and constant environment, which is significantly different from the evaporation rate after integrating with water collectors. Water is usually collected within a sealed space, and the evaporation rate is significantly different in such a highly humid environment. In addition, vapor condenses on the water collector and the formed water droplets cause light reflection, which further lowers the evaporation rate. Because converting saline water to freshwater is the ultimate goal of solar steam generation, future work should also focus on designing innovative water collectors that maintain high evaporation efficiencies and high fresh water production rates.
The lack of industry participation also delays the commercialization of this technique. Researchers mainly focus on developing novel materials and structural designs to maximize the evaporation efficiency and to a large extent overlook the real-world problems that confront with the implementation of these technologies. Considering that great strides have been made in evaporation efficiency through novel photothermal, support materials and novel interfacial evaporator designs in the past few years, involving industrial partners can support fast translation of the technology from the current stage to real applications.
Despite the challenges in advancing to practical applications, the intrinsic advantages of solar-driven evaporation make it a promising solution for addressing water scarcity around the world. Continued innovation and advances in materials selection and engineering will remain critical as we gear up to promote these technologies from the laboratory scale to large scale real-world applications.
