    , Accepted 25th April 2019First published on 29th April 2019AbstractUnsatisfactory light-harvesting over the wavelength of 500 nm is a critical factor limiting the further improvement in efficiency of halide lead based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Past studies on a tandem strategy of integrating perovskite and bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) increased the fabrication complexity. Here, we developed a convenient strategy, injecting the organic BHJ of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)-carbonyl]-thieno-[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and 3,9-bis[2-(3-oxo-2-vinyl-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile]-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) via anti-solvent engineering. Besides the function of enhanced light-harvesting in the range of 500–700 nm for the perovskite layer, the BHJ-treated CH3NH3PbI3 films exhibit superior crystalline quality with reduced defect and trap states. As a result, the resulting PSCs deliver a champion power conversion efficiency as high as 20%. The proposed method provides a facile route to integrate perovskite and organic BHJ conveniently by avoiding additional fabrication steps. And this method is suitable for large-scale and industrial production of high-performance PSCs.
Introduction
Hybrid metal halide perovskites have been used as efficient light absorbers for solar cells and have shown high performance due to their direct band gap, large absorption coefficient, long exciton diffusion lengths and very high charge carrier mobility.1–5 They demonstrate strong competitiveness in the photovoltaic field due to their fast rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the past several years.6–10 Nevertheless, further achievements of efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still necessary to accelerate their commercialization.
For a solar cell, the light-harvesting capability of the absorber layer mainly determines the device performance. The whole sunlight spectrum is expected to be covered completely by the absorption spectrum of the active material. Despite the excellent light-harvesting capability, hybrid metal halide perovskite materials (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3) present a light response up to ∼800 nm due to their optical band gap of 1.55 eV. This leaves the light in the near-infrared (NIR) region unused.11–13 In addition, the perovskite materials also show a decrease of light absorption from 500–800 nm. These facts limit the further enhancement of the performance of PSCs. One important strategy is to broaden the light response to a longer wavelength region, and another strategy is to improve the utilization of solar light below 800 nm. Recently, a series-connected tandem structure composed of two or more sub-cells involving the same or complementary absorption has been utilized to enhance the photoresponse of halide lead based PSCs. Among them, the organic bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) is always integrated with PSCs in order to utilize its special light harvesting, which is complementary to perovskites.14–18 However, the tandem structure will increase the fabrication complexity because the integration of the stacking perovskite and the BHJ needs more film processing steps and sometimes additional interlayers are necessary. In addition, unsatisfactory light-harvesting ability over the wavelength of 500 nm is a critical factor limiting the further improvement in efficiency of the halide lead based PSCs. It is important to find suitable materials that complement the absorbance of perovskite materials and integrate their advantages in a simple and effective way.
As mentioned before, the organic BHJ composed of a donor and acceptor material, which can realize absorbing in the wavelength range of 500–800 nm due to its larger degrees in molecular design and synthesis, is usually employed as a photoactive layer in organic solar cells.19–22 Interestingly, both perovskite and BHJ films have ambipolar merits with almost balanced hole- and electron-transporting properties, which make it feasible to dope the BHJ materials into the perovskite layer to enhance the absorption of solar light below 800 nm. Herein, we develop a new strategy to improve the device performance of halide lead based PSCs by combining the advantages of the perovskite and the BHJ for efficient light-harvesting and energy-conversion. BHJ materials composed of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)-carbonyl]-thieno-[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and 3,9-bis[2-(3-oxo-2-vinyl-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile]-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) are dissolved in an anti-solvent of chlorobenzene, which has been used for treatment in the one-step fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs. During the anti-solvent treatment, the BHJ of PTB7:ITIC is easily injected into the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer. The combination of perovskite and BHJ is realized conveniently without increasing the fabrication steps. The incorporation of the BHJ materials enhances the light absorption of the perovskite layer in the range of 500–700 nm effectively. The doped composite film of perovskite:BHJ exhibits an obvious improvement of hole and electron mobility by two times. In addition, BHJ injection also plays an important role in passivating the perovskite film with reduced defect and trap states. As a result, the fabricated perovskite solar cells deliver a champion PCE of 20%, which is higher than 16.77% of the reference device without the incorporation of PTB7:ITIC. The developed strategy provides a facile route to improve the device performance of CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs.
Experimental
Precursor preparation
The precursor solution of perovskite was prepared by mixing 462 mg of PbI2 and 159 mg of CH3NH3I powder with a molar ratio of 1:1 (7:3, v/v) in 1 mL of γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and dimethylsulfoxide (GMSO) with stirring overnight at 60 °C. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by mixing 22 μL of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) and 36 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) with 90 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene solution. The bulk-heterojunction (which contains PBT7 and ITIC) was added into chlorobenzene in different mixing ratios and concentrations and stirred for an hour. For example, if PTB7:ITIC = 2:1, we mixed 12 mg of PTB7 and 6 mg of ITIC in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, then the solution was diluted to various concentrations.
Device fabrication
FTO-coated glass (with a sheet resistance of ∼15 Ω sq−1) was cleaned using ultrapure water, acetone and ethanol successively in an ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes each. The dried substrates were then treated with the UV–ozone cleaner for 25 minutes. After that, the substrates were immersed into 200 mL of TiCl4/water solution at 70 °C for 1 hour. Then, the treated substrates were washed with deionized water and dried at 100 °C in air for 1 hour, followed by UV–ozone treatment for 30 minutes. The perovskite layers were deposited in a nitrogen glove box by using a consecutive two-step spin-coating process with a speed of 1000 rpm for 20 seconds followed by 4000 rpm for 40 seconds. During the second spin-coating step, chlorobenzene with or without the BHJ was dropped onto the substrates at the 20th second. Then, the CH3NH3PbI3 substrate was heated at 100 °C for 10 minutes. After the annealing process, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was coated on the perovskite layer at a speed of 5000 rpm for 40 seconds. Finally, the device was transferred to a vacuum chamber under 2 × 10−6 Torr for Au electrode evaporation. The active area of each device is 9 mm2.
Characteristics

J–V characteristics of perovskite solar cells under 1 sun illumination were obtained using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter under Air Mass (AM 1.5G) solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The measurement of incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was performed using a system combining a xenon lamp, a monochromator, a chopper and a lock-in amplifier together with a calibrated silicon photodetector. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra were obtained using a Quanta 200 FEG scanning electron microscope. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Veeco Multimode V instrument to evaluate the surface morphology of films in tapping mode. The absorbance spectra were obtained with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted using PANalytical (Empyrean) equipment. The steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite films with/without the BHJ were collected using a Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR800 at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by using an IM6e Electrochemical Workstation (ZAHNER, Germany) under dark conditions. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed under an ultrahigh vacuum using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi instrument with a monochromatic AI Kα (1486.68 eV) X-ray source. This measurement was calibrated using the C 1s carbon peak (284.8 eV) in the CAE mode with a step size of 0.05 eV.
Results and discussion
Perovskite:BHJ films
PTB7:ITIC precursors with varied ratios were prepared in advance by dissolving them in chlorobenzene with a fixed concentration of 20 mg mL−1. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films were first deposited on the TiO2 underlayer through a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1000 and 4000 rpm for 20 and 40 s. In the last 20 s of the spin-coating, the films were treated by drop-casting 150 μL of PTB7:ITIC precursor (in chlorobenzene). Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of PTB7 and ITIC and a schematic for the treatment process of CH3NH3PbI3 films using the PTB7:ITIC precursor (in chlorobenzene). In this way, the BHJ was injected into the perovskite layer easily. PTB7 acted as the donor and ITIC acted as the acceptor. The schematic of energy levels and structural illustration of devices treated with the BHJ are shown in Fig. 1b and c. Based on a typical cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the fabricated perovskite solar cells, as shown in Fig. 1d, most of the BHJ penetrated into the perovskite active layer, and a small portion of the BHJ remained upon perovskite layer and wrapped the perovskite grains.

To study the effect of the BHJ on the morphology of the perovskite light absorbing layer, top-view SEM images of perovskite films with (w/) and without (w/o) BHJ treatment were evaluated. Fig. 2a(i) and b(i) display the SEM images of the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ films deposited on FTO/TiO2 substrates. Both films showed better surface morphologies with compact grains. However, the BHJ treated sample presented superior crystalline quality compared with the pristine film. The highlighted grains (black) with random selections in both cases gave obvious evidence of the enlargement of the grain size. The enhanced intensity of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern further proved the superior crystallinity of the BHJ-treated CH3NH3PbI3 film (ESI,† Fig. S1).

To better clarify the distribution of the BHJ in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, the evaluations of the cross-section SEM images and the SEM/energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) images of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ films deposited on FTO/TiO2 substrates were carried out. Fig. 2a(iii, iv) and b(iii, iv) show the elemental distribution of S and F, which are the characteristic elements for PTB7 and ITIC. Compared to the pristine film, obvious S and F components were observed in the BHJ-treated CH3NH3PbI3 layer. A qualitative evaluation based on element analysis using EDAX images further confirmed the existence of S and F elements in the perovskite layer (ESI,† Fig. S2). And the cross-sectional distribution of S and F suggested that PTB7 and ITIC molecules penetrated into almost all of the perovskite layer.
Optoelectronic properties of perovskite:BHJ films
First, the effect of the BHJ treatment on the carrier dynamics in the perovskite layer was investigated by using the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra. As shown in Fig. 3a, two curves showed the same steady-state photoluminescence peak, indicating that the PL is determined by the bandgap of the perovskite. Meanwhile, the PL quenching of the BHJ-treated perovskite film was faster than that of the pristine perovskite film, suggesting a faster charge carrier transfer from the perovskite to PTB7:ITIC molecules. This means that the charge extraction from the perovskite to the BHJ film was more efficient. Fig. 3b compares the TRPL decay behaviors of the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ films. The decay curves showed a biexponential character, and we used a longer lifetime for comparison. The BHJ-treated perovskite film exhibited a PL lifetime of 1.9 ns, which was shorter than that of the pristine perovskite film (4.3 ns). The shorter PL lifetime suggested a faster charge transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to PTB7:ITIC molecules.

(c) J–V curves of electron-dominated and hole-dominated devices. (d) Trap density of states (tDOS) of devices w/ or w/o BHJ (PTB7:ITIC, 2:1). 
Although the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film and the PTB7:ITIC BHJ film possess ambipolar transporting properties for holes and electrons, improved carrier mobilities are expected in the BHJ-treated CH3NH3PbI3 films. To assess the hole- and electron-transporting abilities in the CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ films, electron-dominated devices (ITO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 (w/ or w/o BHJ)/PCBM/Ag) and hole-dominated devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 (w/ or w/o BHJ)/P3HT/Ag) were fabricated to evaluate their current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. Corresponding double logarithmic J–V curves are plotted in Fig. 3c. Typical rectification behaviors with three distinct regions were observed in the four devices.23–25 The low bias region is related to an Ohmic current by a slope of 1 for logJ–logV. The abruptly increased current region is associated with a current behavior involving an exponential distribution of traps. Then, the current moves toward a V2 dependence, corresponding to the space charge limited current (SCLC).26–28 In this region, J and V obey the relation of J = 9εε0μV2/8L3, where μ is the carrier mobility, ε0 = 8.8542 × 10−14 (F cm−1) is the permittivity of free space, εr29 is the dielectric constant of the perovskite film (for the pristine perovskite film, εr = 7.28; for the perovskite:BHJ film, εr = 6.76, and L = 280 × 10−7 (cm)) is the film thickness of the perovskite film. Therefore, the mobility values for holes and electrons could be extrapolated by fitting the J–V data in the quadratic region of the electron-dominated and hole-dominated devices, as shown in Fig. 3c. Through BHJ treatment, the electron mobility and the hole mobility were increased from 0.92 to 2.33 cm2 V−1 s−1, and from 2.27 to 5.07 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Based on the SEM images and XRD patterns of the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ films, BHJ incorporation is expected to passivate the perovskite film by reducing the defect and trap states. To clarify the passivation role of the BHJ, the trap density of states (tDOS) in CH3NH3PbI3- and CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ-based PSCs was evaluated via thermal admittance spectroscopy.30–32 As shown in Fig. 3d, the trap density was obviously reduced especially in the shallow energy region after injecting PTB7:ITIC into the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. This is direct evidence of the passivation effect of PTB7:ITIC on the perovskite films.
To further understand the passivation effect of PTB7:ITIC, the chemical stoichiometry of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ was examined via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESI,† Fig. S3). Fig. 4a and b show the XPS core levels of N 1s and Pb 4f, respectively, in the CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ films. Compared to the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 film, the CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ sample showed higher binding energies for both N 1s and Pb 4f, which were attributed to the differences in surface stoichiometry and consequently surface energy.33–35 This further clarified the passivation effect of PTB7:ITIC on the perovskite films.

Photovoltaic performance
Planar n-i-p PSCs with a structure of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 (w/ or w/o BHJ)/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Au were fabricated to investigate the effect of BHJ incorporation on the photovoltaic performance. First, the ratio of PTB7:ITIC was optimized based on the device performance. ITIC is a star non-fullerene electron acceptor for organic solar cells. The ratio of 1:1 for PTB7:ITIC enabled the corresponding organic solar cells to deliver a PCE of 6.97% (ESI,† Fig. S4), which was similar to that of the reported one.21 Because of different carrier transporting abilities of perovskite and organic molecules, the ratio of PTB7:ITIC was further optimized to be 2:1 in the perovskite:BHJ based PSCs, as shown in Fig. 5a. Furthermore, the optimized precursor concentration of PTB7:ITIC in chlorobenzene was determined to be 0.24 mg mL−1 (ESI,† Table S1). Fig. 5b shows the J–V characteristics of the CH3NH3PbI3- and CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ-based champion devices under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The cell parameters of open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are summarized in Table 1. The CH3NH3PbI3-based PSC showed a PCE of 16.77% with a Jsc of 21.30 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.08 V, and a FF of 0.73. After injecting suitable PTB7:ITIC (2:1, 0.24 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene), the control device cast from CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ presented a champion PCE as high as 20.00%, with a Jsc of 24.20 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.10 V, and a FF of 0.76. Besides, the device treated with the BHJ still shows the same hysteresis in the J–V curves as that of the reference device (Fig. S5, ESI†). We think that the hysteresis behavior may result from the TiO2 layers. To diminish the hysteresis behavior, modification of the TiO2 layer may be needed. A series of reference and control devices was fabricated to prove the performance reproducibility. Fig. 5c gives the corresponding histogram of PCEs measured over 30 devices. A small overlap of the PCE distributions between the reference and the control devices clarified the positive role of PTB7:ITIC in improving the device efficiency of CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs. Noticeably, the improved PCE was mainly attributed to the modifications of Jsc and the FF. Fig. 5d shows the absorption spectra of the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:BHJ films deposited on FTO/TiO2 underlayers. Obviously, the absorption was enhanced in the range of 500–720 nm. Therefore, the absorption enhancement was regarded as one of main factors for the increased Jsc from 21.30 to 24.20 mA cm−2. Fig. 5e gives the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the reference and the control devices. A similar enhancing trend in the range of 550–750 nm further confirmed the contributory role of PTB7:ITIC in the cell parameter of Jsc. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the interfacial contact conditions in the reference and the control devices. Fig. 5f shows the Nyquist plots in both the devices at a bias of 1.0 V. The inset shows the equivalent circuit model for the present devices. The decreased values of series resistance and charge transfer resistance suggested a better interface between perovskite:BHJ and Spiro-OMeTAD layers, which is ascribed as one of the main factors in improving the FF from 0.73 to 0.77.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a new strategy to enhance the photovoltaic response and passivate the crystallization of halide lead perovskite solar cells. The BHJ composed of PTB7 and ITIC, dissolved in an anti-solvent of chlorobenzene, was penetrated into the CH3NH3PbI3 layer via anti-solvent engineering. The proposed method provides a facile route to integrate perovskite and organic BHJ conveniently without increasing the fabrication steps. Light-harvesting of the perovskite layer in the range of 500–700 nm could be compensated by the incorporation of the organic BHJ materials. In addition, the BHJ of PTB7:ITIC could passivate the perovskite film effectively, producing superior crystalline quality with reduced defect and trap states. Accordingly, the resulting perovskite solar cells deliver a champion PCE as high as 20% owing to the simultaneous increase of Jsc and the FF. The developed strategy paves a new way to enhance the photovoltaic response of halide lead perovskites, and is also suitable for large-scale and industrial production of perovskite solar cells.
