    , Accepted 15th June 2014First published on 16th June 2014AbstractA general methodology has been proposed for the straightforward access to 4,8-functionalized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes (BDTs) via Pd mediated coupling reactions including Suzuki–Sonogashira coupling and carbon–sulfur bond formation reactions. This versatile platform can be used to construct a library of BDT core centred conjugated systems, featuring large fused-ring structure and good charge mobility, where a hole mobility of 0.061 cm2 V−1 s−1 is demonstrated. With the energy level fine-tuned with functionalization, the charge transporting BDTs show great potential for donor–acceptor polymers.
To date, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been proved to be one of the most important fused-ring structured building blocks in the design of conjugated polymer donors for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells due to its high mobility and lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level.1–4 As a donating moiety, BDT has been chosen for the following merits: (a) the fused BDT ring structure allows the incorporation of substituents on the central benzene core, while also maintaining the planarity of the two thiophene units; (b) its structural symmetry and the rigid fused aromatic system could enhance the electron delocalization and interchain interactions to improve the charge mobility and eliminate the need to control the regioregularity during the polymerization process;5 (c) it would maintain a low HOMO energy level of the resulting polymers as demonstrated by donor-strong and acceptor-weak polymers.6 Kobmehl et al. first synthesized 4,8-dimethoxybenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione as the precursor using a two-step reaction protocol (Scheme 1).7 Several extended methods were then explored for the synthesis of alkyl, alkenyl and aromatic ring substituted BDT derivatives.8,9
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes for BDT derivatives in the literature. 
The BDT derived polymers were first developed as donors for BHJ solar cells by Hou et al. in 2008.9 In the meantime, many research groups showed strong interest in these fascinating building blocks, and a large spectrum of BDT derived donors have been developed since then by introducing various substituents including alkyl, alkylthienyl, and alkyl phenylethynyl to the benzene core of BDT.3b,10 Particularly, the ethynylene and thienyl-substituted BDT derived linear or two-dimensional (2D) small molecules and conjugated polymers exhibited promising performance in BHJ solar cells. For example, small molecules and polymer based ethynylene-containing benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene derivatives displayed low HOMO levels and an excellent hole mobility up to 1.1–1.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (on/off current ratio ∼ 107) in field effect transistors (FETs).2b,d The blend of the 4,8-triisopropylsilylethynyl functionalized BDT polymer and PC71BM in 1:2 weight ratio delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6% in BHJ cells.11 A PCE of 8.13% was even achieved from 2D small molecules with a bithienyl-substituted BDT donor, which performed much better than its thiophene-substituted BDT analogues.12 The open circuit voltage (Voc) is directly proportional to the HOMO level of the electron donor.13 The lower the HOMO level of the donor, the higher the Voc. Thus, the high mobility and low HOMO level are prerequisites to achieve high-performance solar cells.6a,13,14
To achieve air-stable and high charge-transporting donor materials, the design and preparation of 2D BDTs by attaching conjugated substituents onto the central benzene core to fine-tune the energy levels and facilitate regular π–π stacking of conjugated molecules and polymer backbones is considered to be a critical issue in the development of high-performance solar cells.12,15 However, the previous methods have certain drawbacks: (i) the synthesis of BDT derivatives with the n-BuLi/SnCl2 method has a limited scope for the substituents that may be introduced;9 (ii) the use of the Grignard method16 for the preparation of acetylene-substituted BDTs instead of lithiation only work for limited phenyl substituents with low yields; (iii) larger fused aromatic substituents like thio[3,4-b′]thiophene could not be accessed with any methods in the literature, probably due to steric hindrance.
In conjunction with the development of new donors for solar cells, we are keen to search for more general synthesis approaches to expand novel π-extended BDT-based donor materials. Herein we report a versatile method (Scheme 2) for the synthesis of a library of amazing compounds using 4,8-triflated BDT as the precursor for the first time. Aryl triflates have frequently been used as electrophiles in coupling reactions.17 By introducing trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy groups on 4,8-positions of BDT as leaving groups, a library of 4,8-functionalized BDT derivatives have been successfully prepared via Pd mediated coupling reactions including Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling. Importantly, the straightforward access to dialkylthio BDTs can be easily achieved with high yields (≥90%) through one-step palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction. Dialkylthio substituted BDTs were reported to be synthesized with a two-step protocol, where a Newman–Kwart rearrangement under 245 °C heating is the key step.18 Excitingly, the Suzuki coupling can be successfully extended for the synthesis of conjugated polymers. This effective strategy provides a versatile platform to construct 2D conjugated systems centred on the BDT core, featuring large fused-ring structure and good planarity. The new BDT derivatives developed with this approach, we believe, will find great potential in the design of new molecular/polymeric semiconductors for organic electronics.
 Scheme 2  Access to 4,8-difunctionalized BDT monomers/polymers via BDT triflate involved Suzuki coupling. 
As shown in Scheme 2, 4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione 1 was readily synthesized according to the reported procedure with thiophene-3-carboxylic acid as the starting material.9 A reduction of 1 with sodium borohydride in ethanol afforded 2 in 99% isolated yield under heating at 85 °C.18 Ensuing treatment of 2 with Tf2O and pyridine in CH2Cl2 provided the key intermediate, 4,8-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene 3, in 85% yield. It should be noted that reaction with DMF as the solvent instead of CH2Cl2 was not successful. The structure of the as-obtained 3 was confirmed by the 13C NMR spectrum (Fig. S4†). The coupling constant of the characteristic peak (δ = 118.6 ppm) corresponding to trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy groups was shown to be 319 Hz, which was in good agreement with the literature.17b With the key precursor triflate 3 at hand, Suzuki cross-coupling between 3 and aryl boronic acids or esters (Table 1, entries 1–10) proceeded smoothly in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and Na2CO3 to afford a new library of 4,8-diaryl-BDT monomers in 50–90% yields. The scope of thiophene analogues was extended from a single thiophene unit to fused thio[3,4-b′]thiophene and bithiophene. The coupling reaction with 2-thienylboronic acid afforded 4 with a yield of 80% (entry 1), while the couplings with 5-(trimethylsilyl)-2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-thiophene,14 5-(octyl)-2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-thiophene and 5-(dodecyl-thio)-2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-thiophene19a were explored to prepare 5–7 (entries 2–4) with ∼70% yields.

To the best of our knowledge, the larger the conjugated ring directly linked to the core in the cross-coupling, the more difficult it is to achieve it. Hence, the coupling with fused thio[3,4-b′]thiophene (TT)19 and bithiophene gave 8 and 9 (entries 5–6) in relatively low yields (55% and 60%). It should be noted that 8 was first prepared with BDT triflate, since the incorporation of a TT ring using n-BuLi was found to be inaccessible. The results indicated the applicability of this protocol for the incorporation of relatively large substituents to 4,8-positions of BDTs. We extended this approach to other aromatic rings. For instance, the coupling with 2-furanboronic acid afforded 10 (entry 7) in 81% yield. And the synthesis of BDTs with phenyl or its analogues with fluorine and trifluoromethyl substituents (11–13) was successfully achieved with a yield of 90, 81 and 82% (entries 8–10), respectively. It should be noted that aryl boronic acids were more reactive than the corresponding Bpin esters in Suzuki cross-coupling reactions and the electron-withdrawing strength of substituents had a positive effect on the yield of couplings with phenyl analogues.
The BDT triflate was also explored for Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions with acetylene substituents (Scheme 3). The reaction proceeded smoothly with 10 mol% [PdCl2(PPh3)2] and 20 mol% CuI as catalysts in the DMF–Et3N (2:1, v/v) solvent mixture under heating at 100 °C for 16 h. The coupling between 3 and 2.5 equiv. of 1-octyne, or 4-methyl-phenyl-acetylene gave the corresponding products 15 and 16 (entries 12 and 13) with a yield of 80 and 88%, respectively. Due to desilylation under the condition of excess base, however, the coupling with trimethylsilylacetylene only gave 14 as the product with a yield of 55%.
 Scheme 3  Access to 4,8-difunctionalized BDT monomers via BDT triflate involved Sonogashira coupling and carbon–sulfur formation. 
We were pleased to note that our protocol can also be used for the preparation of BDT thiols from the alkyl/aryl thiol substrates with BDT triflate (entries 14–16). The BDT sulfides 17–19 (Scheme 3) were successfully prepared via transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling transformation using Pd2(dba)3 and the Xantphos phosphine ligand without formation of their disulfide compounds.20 Octylmercaptan, dodecylmercaptan and benzylmercaptan were S-arylated in excellent yields of 90%, 91% and 90%, respectively.
We are also interested in the developing protocols that allow the preparation of conjugated polymers from BDT triflate 3 and aryl boronic ester. Fluorene is the most frequently used moiety for organic electronics.14,21 Hence, a Suzuki cross-coupling between BDT triflate 3 and fluorene diboronic ester was explored in a biphasic mixture of aqueous K2CO3 and toluene with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and tetrabutylammonium bromide as the phase transfer catalyst (Scheme 3). The polymer P1 was obtained with good solubility in organic solvents (ca. CHCl3, THF, and dichlorobenzene) and a high molecular weight (Mw = 21.4 kDa, Mw/Mn = 1.81), a value comparable to those of polyfluorenes prepared with arylbromide.19b
In order to evaluate the applicability of the as-prepared BDT monomers as donating units in the development of donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating narrow bandgap polymers for solar cells, the optical and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared BDT monomers (4–19) were further studied. The UV-vis absorption spectra of monomers 4–19 in both CHCl3 solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. S39.† All spectra feature two distinct absorption peaks, with the one at 300–450 nm assigned to the delocalized π–π* transition between the BDT core and the attached side chains and the other beyond 300 nm corresponding to the incorporated side chains. For electron-rich thiophene analogues (4–9), a relatively large red-shift absorption was observed for the films compared to the solutions. Interestingly, in the case of 4 and 9, by changing the single thiophene unit to the bithiophene unit vertical to the core of BDT, the low-energy absorbance increased in intensity and a larger red-shift was observed. The reason was that the resonance structure in BDT increased the double-bond character of the single bonds in 9 and this consequent reduction of the bond-length alternation effectively modified the absorption behaviours of BDT.22 When comparing the UV-vis spectra of 8 with that of 4, the larger planar structure of the thio[3,4-b′]thiophene unit was the so-called “prequinoid” monomer and the quinoid resonance form is lower in energy than the single thiophene form. The stabilized quinoid form effectively reduces the bandgap of related conjugated systems.3a,21,23 As expected, the thio[3,4-b′]thiophene substituted BDT monomer 8 exhibited red shifted absorption than 4 in both solution (15 nm) and the film (nearly 20 nm). By attaching trimethylsilyl or octyl thiophene, the resulting BDT monomers 5 and 6 exhibited similar absorption spectra with 4, indicating that alkyl chains had a negligible effect on the electronic structures of BDT.24
For 10, the film with an onset absorption (λedge) of 490 nm displayed 55 nm bathochromic shift than its solution, indicating an increased degree of BDT aggregation in the solid state. Compared with monomer 11, it was found that the anchoring of fluorine or trifluoromethyl groups at 4,8-positions of the BDT core for 12 and 13 had no distinct effect on the electronic structures. The phenylacetylenated 16 exhibited the widest absorption band, with a λedge extended to 500 nm. And a remarkable red-shifted absorption (∼80 nm) was observed in the film when comparing with its dilute solution, suggesting J-aggregation as the dominant packing mode in the solid state.25 Monomers 17, 18 and 19 exhibited about 5 nm red-shifted absorption than the reference 4,8-didodeoxyl BDT (BDT-O-C12H25). This indicates that stronger π–π stacking between BDT and the diarylthio or dialkylthio substituent occurs than that in dialkoxy substituted BDT analogues.
The optical and electrochemical data of the BDT monomers are summarized in Table S1.† The alignment of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BDT monomers are further plotted in Fig. 1. The HOMO energy level of BDT monomers is found to be dependent upon the electron-donating substituents on the BDT core. For monomers with relatively electron-deficient phenyl analogues, the HOMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.55, −5.56 and −5.58 eV, respectively, for 11–13. Phenyl substituent bearing six π-electrons on the BDT core introduced a relatively larger perturbation to the conjugated backbone, further lowering the LUMO level. The HOMO energy levels of ethynylene-containing BDTs (14–16) were estimated to be −5.47, −5.48 and −5.51 eV, respectively, which indicated that the introduction of triple bonds led to an increased conjugation length and good planarity to give the low HOMO energy level.
 Fig. 1  The alignment of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BDT monomers. 
For electron-rich thiophene analogues, the HOMO energy levels estimated for 4–9 were −5.41, −5.45, −5.43, −5.42, −5.43 and −5.38 eV, respectively, indicating that the incorporated 2-functionalized thiophene had a negligible effect on the HOMO energy level when comparing 5–7 with 4. The thio[3,4-b′]thiophene substituted 8, with the so-called “pre-quinoid” unit, showed a low HOMO energy level due to the enforced planarity and more effective π-electron delocalization than single thiophene.24 Monomer 9 showed the highest HOMO level among all thiophene analogues (4–9), due to the existence of more π-electrons with two 5-membered rings in comparison to other thiophene substituents. The HOMO level of furan-substituted 10 was calculated to be −5.42 eV, similar to that of 4. The HOMO energy levels of 17–19 were calculated to be −5.41, −5.41 and −5.42 eV, respectively, much deeper than that of BDT-O-C12H25 (−5.18 eV). This can be explained with the poorer electron-donating ability of the sulfur atom than the oxygen atom due to the poorer overlap of its orbitals with the π-system of the BDT backbone.
According to the electrochemical studies discussed above, the electron-deficiency of the screened substituents can be arranged by the order: thiophene analogues < ethynylene analogues < phenyl analogues. The poorer the aryl substituent, the lower the HOMO level. Amazingly, most of BDT monomers exhibit a HOMO level close to the HOMO of “ideal” polymers for high-efficiency solar cells (ca. −5.4 eV).13 Though there are arguments on the inheritance of the HOMO level of D–A polymers from the electron-rich monomers,28 the closeness of the HOMO level of BDT monomers to that of the “ideal” polymer donors in a necessarily desirable situation will help in finding matchable electron-deficient monomers to obtain new D–A polymers for high-performance solar cells.
In order to demonstrate the electronic structures as well as molecular energy levels of the BDT monomers, quantum chemistry calculations were performed by using the density functional theory (DFT) on the B3LYP/6-31G level.26 As shown in Fig. 2, these four units show planar structures and the π-electrons are well delocalized along their backbones, however, the HOMO and LUMO levels are different. The bandgaps of 5, 8 and 9 are 3.75 eV, 3.58 eV and 3.37 eV, respectively, indicating that the bandgap becomes smaller with increase of the conjugation length of substituents. The HOMO level of 17 is −5.61 eV, implying that the introduction of sulfur as the heteroatom affects the molecular energy levels of fused aromatic systems distinctly.27 The results from DFT calculations clearly show the similarity/difference of the energy levels of the frontier orbitals as well as the molecular electronic structures among 5, 8, 9 and 17.

The ordered-structure and crystallization features of BDT monomers were investigated by film X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As depicted in Fig. 3a–b, the films of 5 and 17 displayed a series of equidistant peaks in XRD spectra,24 indicating highly crystalline property of the thin films. The d-spacing of 1.73 nm for 5 and 1.74 nm for 17 corresponds exactly to the strong primary diffraction peak at 5.11° and 5.08°, respectively, suggesting that the molecules oriented normal to the substrate surface with a certain extent of tilt.26 Interestingly, no peaks were observed for the other BDT monomers, indicating the poor crystalline nature of their films. As illustrated in Fig. 2c–f, AFM images of 5 and 17 also showed a ordered thin-film morphology. Both films of 5 and 17 exhibited terrace structures, which are generally favorable for high charge transport in FETs.19a

Bottom-gate top-contacted transistors were further fabricated to investigate the charge transport properties. Among all BDT monomers, only 5 and 17 exhibited p-channel performance with the mobility calculated from the saturation regime, which agreed well with the results of the XRD and AFM. Fig. 4 shows the typical current-voltage characteristics of 5 and 17 devices made by vacuum deposition at room temperature on the octyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-treated Si/SiO2 substrate.

The representative FET results for monomers 5, 8, 9, 16 and 17 are summarized Table 2 (with the FET data for all monomers listed in Table S2†). The vacuum-deposited device of 5 based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) spin-coated on the Si/SiO2 substrate showed the relatively good average mobility, i.e., the thin film transistors demonstrated a maximum hole mobility of 0.025 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off current ratio of 1.2 × 105 (Fig. S40†). When adopting the OTS-treated Si/SiO2 substrate, the device of 5 achieved a much improved average mobility up to 0.045 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the highest mobility of 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off current ratio of 4 × 105. The vacuum-deposited device on the OTS-treated Si/SiO2 substrate of 17 also demonstrated an average mobility of 0.015 cm2 V−1 s−1. The highest mobility was 0.025 cm2 V−1 s−1, with an on/off current ratio of 2.0 × 106.

It was amazing that negligible variation in structures of monomers led to prodigious differences in the XRD, AFM and FET devices. The correlation study of structure–property is still under progress and the optimized FET data will be reported in due course. The as-prepared BDTs exhibited low HOMO levels close to that of an “ideal” polymer as well as high hole mobilities. According to the strategy of weak donor–strong acceptor to design ideal polymers for organic solar cells,28a if suitable strong acceptors, such as diketopyrrolopyrrole,29 benzooxadiazole30 and naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bisthiadiazole,31,32 would be selected to construct alternating low bandgap copolymers via internal charge transfer with as-developed BDT monomers, we believe, new D–A polymers with suitable energy level alignment and high hole mobilities would be developed to achieve high-performance solar cells with optimized device engineering.
In summary, we have presented here a versatile method for the 4,8-functionalization of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene via palladium-catalyzed Suzuki and Sonogashira couplings as well as carbon–sulfur bond formation reaction. Using this methodology, a library of 4,8-functionalized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene monomers have been developed with aryl, ethynyl, arylethynyl, alkylthio and arylthio substituents. The absorption and energy levels of BDT monomers can be fine-tuned by adjusting the donating strength of the incorporated substituents. The as-prepared BDT monomers exhibit a bandgap ranging from 2.48 to 3.34 eV and a relatively low HOMO energy level. The high crystalline nature and hole mobility of BDT monomers demonstrated for 5 and 17 shows that manipulating the functionalization of BDT core can result in prodigious differences in charge transport properties. High FET mobilities of 0.061 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.025 cm2 V−1 s−1 were readily achieved for 5 and 17. The as-developed BDT monomers may be promising donating units for constructing D–A narrow bandgap polymers for high-performance solar cells and p-type FETs if high mobility co-monomers are used and the resulted polymers have highly ordered structures.
