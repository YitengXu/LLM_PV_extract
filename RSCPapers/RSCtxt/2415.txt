When evaluated as an electrode material for supercapacitors, impressive electrochemical performances are achieved, with high specific discharge capacitances of 857.76 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 512.96 F g−1 at 5 A g−1.When considering economic and environmental requirements, materials with variable valence and good electrochemical capacitance, such as metal oxides/sulfides, conducting polymers and carbon composites are widely investigated as pseudocapacitor electrodes for next generation pseudocapacitors.1,2 The electrochemical performances of the electrode materials are strongly dependent on their sizes, morphologies, and structures; therefore, to meet the requirements, many efforts have been devoted to designing novel electrode materials with hierarchical structures composed of various building blocks, which synergistically enhance the features of both the micromaterials and nanomaterials.3–6 In an elaborately designed structure, the electrochemical performance could be improved by having shortened diffusion lengths and increased active sites.Metal sulfides, such as CoS, SnS, ZnS and FeS, are a new type of energy storage material that have been greatly investigated and have achieved excellent electrochemical performances.7–12 Meanwhile, NiS has also been widely investigated and has widespread applications in supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, dye-sensitized solar cells and ceramic tougheners etc.13–19 Hou et al.20 first investigated the potential application of NiS as a supercapacitor electrode and proposed an electrochemical reaction mechanism. Subsequently, Zhu et al.21 reported the electrochemical performance improvement of nickel sulfide by the design and fabrication of hierarchical hollow structures.In this communication, we synthesized a hierarchical flower-like β-NiS structure via a facile solvothermal method. The novel architecture is composed of a pine tree-like nanostructure in all directions and diethanolamine (H2DEA) was initially employed as a coordination agent and solvent for the formation of this architecture. Excellent electrochemical performances are achieved for the flower-like β-NiS as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The hierarchical flower-like architecture contributes to the superior capacitances. Especially, high specific discharge capacitances of 857.76 F g−1 and 512.96 F g−1 are achieved at 2 A g−1 and 5 A g−1, respectively, suggesting that the flower-like β-NiS is an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors.The optimal experiment to prepare the β-NiS (from NiCl2 and thiourea) was conducted at 180 °C for 12 h (the details are shown in the ESI†). The phase and composition of the as-prepared β-NiS were examined by power X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), as shown in Fig. S1.†Fig. 1a and b show the typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the β-NiS. As shown in Fig. 1a, a uniformly dispersed flower-like microstructure with an average size of 4–5 μm is observed. The high magnification SEM image (Fig. 1b) exhibits detailed information of the particular architecture, which is constructed by a pine tree-like nanostructure in all directions. The pine tree-like nanostructure has a trunk with an average diameter of ∼200 nm, which is surrounded by small branches, shown in the inset in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1  (a) The low and (b) high magnification SEM images; (c) TEM and (d) HRTEM images (the inset is the FFT image); (e) the morphology evolution at different time intervals of the as-prepared flower-like β-NiS. Further morphological and structural investigations were carried out using TEM and HRTEM, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. In Fig. 1c, the low magnification TEM image shows a panoramic picture of a single flower-like microstructure, which validates the SEM results. From the HRTEM image, the clear lattice fringes are visible and the interplane distance is measured as 0.554 nm, corresponding to the (300) plane, which indicates the growth direction along the [100] direction. Meanwhile, the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) was carried out, shown as the inset in Fig. 1d. The spot images corresponding to the electron diffraction pattern imply the presence of a single crystallographic orientation and lattice spacing.In order to investigate the evolution of the flower-like architecture of the β-NiS, a series of time-dependent experiments were carried out, during which samples were collected at different time intervals (1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 10 h and 24 h). The evolution of both the structure and the morphology was examined by XRD and SEM, as shown in Fig. S2.† According to the previous literature,22 H2DEA and its ionized analogs (i.e., HDEA− and DEA2−) may adopt a chelating mode to bind metal ions, forming a five-membered chelate ring. Therefore, we deduced that NiCl2 could react with H2DEA to form a H2DEA–NiCl2 complex. Meanwhile, H2S is released gradually, as the decomposition product of thiourea with increasing temperature. Then, the H2DEA–NiCl2 complex and H2S react to form the NiS original nucleus, which can be expressed as: NiCl2 + H2DEA → H2DEA–NiCl2 (complex)(1) NH2CSNH2 + 2H2O → H2S + 2NH3 + CO2(2) H2DEA–NiCl2 (complex) + H2S → NiS + 2HCl + H2DEA(3)At the early stage of the reaction (1 h), no product is obtained. The sample collected at the interval of 2 h shows an amorphous structure, while the products collected at other time intervals are consistent with the final product obtained at 12 h. Meanwhile, the degree of crystallinity is enhanced with the extension of time (shown in Fig. S2f†). Fig. S2a† shows that the sample collected at the early growth stage (2 h) exhibits an immature flower-like morphology, about 4 μm in diameter, and it is composed of masses of tiny thorn-like nanorods. This could be explained by suggesting that the newly formed nuclei, with a high surface energy, prefer to aggregate, driven by the minimization of surface energy and a self-assembly process, controlled by the intrinsic crystal orientation.23 With the extension of time (4–10 h, Fig. S2b–d†), the tiny thorn-like nanorods gradually dissolved and a rough pine tree-like nanostructure formed by a recrystallization process, and then evolved to a smooth pine tree-like nanostructure through further growth and the Ostwald ripening process (24 h, Fig. S2e†). Based on the above experimental observations and analyses, the morphology evolution is shown in Fig. 1e and a mechanism is proposed for the formation of the flower-like architecture of the β-NiS. As illustrated in Fig. 2, time is the most important controlling factor in the formation process. Such a process is consistent with previous reports,24–28 for a so-called two key stage growth process, which involves a fast nucleation of amorphous primary nanoparticles, followed by a slow dissolution and crystallization of primary particles. Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism for the formation of the hierarchical flower-like β-NiS. The morphology of the final product is usually affected by changing the experimental parameters in the synthetic process. In the present paper, the influence of the amount of H2DEA on the final product is investigated systematically and elaborately. The details are shown in Table S1.†The XRD patterns and SEM images of the products obtained with various volume ratios of water to H2DEA, at 180 °C for 12 h, are shown in Fig. S3.† With the absence of H2DEA, irregular nanoparticles are obtained (Fig. S3a†). As H2DEA is introduced to the reaction system, aggregations of nanoparticles are obtained when the additive amount of H2DEA is 4 mL (Fig. S3b†). When the volume of H2DEA is fixed at 8 mL, a rudimentary hierarchical structure emerges. The SEM image (Fig. S3c†) shows that the size of the clusters is about 500–600 nm. There is no similar flower-like architecture obtained until the amount of H2DEA reaches 10 mL. As shown in Fig. S3d,† the size of the flower-like architecture is 4–5 μm and the surface of the branches is very rough, with nanoparticles anchored to it. With a continued increase in the amount of H2DEA to 16 mL (Fig. S3e†), the same defined hierarchical flower-like structure is obtained compared with the product obtained with 12 mL of H2DEA. From the discussion above, it can clearly be seen that the addition of H2DEA benefits the formation of the hierarchical architecture, by forming a complex with the NiCl2 and possibly by increasing the viscosity of the mixed solvent, which restricts the diffusion of H2S.Rationally designing electrodes with novel microstructures is an effective method to boost the electrochemical utilization of pseudocapacitive materials. Therefore, the hierarchical flower-like architecture is anticipated to enhance the electrochemical performance of the β-NiS. To demonstrate that the electrochemical performance benefits from the flower-like β-NiS architecture, the electrochemical properties of the products obtained with 8 mL (clusters with a ‘nano-bulk’ structure, marked as S1) and 12 mL (flower-like structure, marked as S2) of H2DEA at 180 °C for 12 h, respectively, were examined and we forecast that S2 with the flower-like structure would exhibit a better electrochemical performance.Fig. S4a† shows the typical initial three CV curves of S2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with a potential window ranging from 0 to 0.5 V versus Hg/HgO in 2 M KOH. Obviously, the initial curve is different from the subsequent cycles, indicating a phase transformation during the charge process, as described in reaction (4) and the reversible conversion between Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH (reaction (5)) begins with the second cycle.13 With the proceeding cycling, the degree of phase transformation increases. Fig. S4b–d† show the XRD pattern and XPS spectra of Ni2p and O1s of the S2 electrode after 300 cycles of CV. In Fig. S4b,† the degree of crystallinity is low, however, the characteristic peaks of Ni(OH)2 and carbon are observed and labeled as (Ni(OH)2: JCPDS card. 3-177). In order to further verify the existence of Ni(OH)2, the XPS spectra of Ni2p and O1s were obtained and are shown in Fig. S4c and d.† The Ni2p peak (856.20 eV) and the O1s peak (531.50 eV) of S2 after 300 cycles of CV correspond to Ni(OH)2.29,30 The reaction mechanism occurs as shown below, which has also been reported in other sulfide systems.31,32 NiS + H2O + 1/2O2 → Ni(OH)2 + S(4) Ni(OH)2 + OH− ⇔ NiOOH + H2O + e−(5)Fig. 3a and b show the typical CV curves of the S1 and S2 electrodes at scan rates of 5, 10, 20 and 50 mV s−1. A pair of redox peaks at 0.45 and 0.37 V is observed, which corresponds to the reversible conversion between Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH.33 With an increasing scan rate, the shape of the curves is maintained, indicating that the electrode has an excellent rate performance. For S2, with the flower-like morphology (Fig. 3b), it can be seen that the leveled current separation between the leveled anodic and cathodic currents is much larger than for S1 (Fig. 3a), suggesting the good electrochemical performance of S2. The average specific capacitances of S1 and S2 at different scan rates were calculated and are shown in Fig. S5.† As shown in Fig. 3c a linear relationship is observed between the anodic peak current (ip) and the scan rate (V1/2) based on the results of the CV curves, which suggests a diffusion-limited process for the redox reaction of the NiS electrodes.34 Fig. 3  (a) and (b) CV curves of S1 and S2 at various scan rates; (c) ipvs. V1/2 plots of S1 and S2; (d) galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of S2 at different current densities. The constant current galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of S2 measured at different current densities are shown in Fig. 3d. The potential plateaus in the charge–discharge curves are in good agreement with the results of the CV test. The high specific capacitance further confirms that such a design and fabrication of hierarchical architectures enhances the electrochemical performances. The building blocks shorten the diffusion paths of the electrolyte ion, thus improving the dynamic performance. Moreover, the surface area of S2 offers more active sites for electrode materials and electrolyte, maximizing the utilization of the electrode materials and realizing a high pseudocapacitance. The specific surface areas of both S1 and S2 were examined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller theory and exhibit values of 8.0289 and 24.0615 m2 g−1, respectively; the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. S6.†Both the cycling life and rate performance are important factors for evaluating a supercapacitor. The cycling performances over 1000 cycles of S1 and S2 were determined with a galvanostatic charge–discharge, at the current density of 2 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 4a. The specific capacitances are 897.12 F g−1 and 1606.32 F g−1 for the initial cycles, and maintain at 365.08 F g−1 and 709.82 F g−1 after 1000 cycles, for S1 and S2, respectively. Similar to findings from a previous report,20 capacitive decay occurs during the process of cycling. The main decrease of the specific capacitance occurs during the first 100 cycles, which could be ascribed to the consumption of the electrolyte, caused by the irreversible reaction between the electrode materials and the electrolyte.35 A further reason is that the phase transformation from NiS to Ni(OH)2 may produce a degree of collapse of the flower-like structure. Also, there is a small capacitive decay observed during subsequent cycles, owing to the hierarchical architecture further collapsing with the charging–discharging process.20 Compared with the NiS hollow spheres (a capacitance of 587.1 F g−1 retained after 1000 cycles at a current density of 4.2 A g−1 in a voltage window of −0.15 to 0.55 V),20 S2 with a flower-like structure, exhibits a capacitance of 709.82 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 in a voltage window of 0–0.5 V. The coulombic efficiencies of the S1 and S2 electrodes were calculated to be constant (∼99%) with cycling, again demonstrating the excellent reversibility of the electrodes. Fig. 4  (a) The cycling performances and coulombic efficiencies of S1 and S2 at a current density of 2 A g−1, (b) the rate performances of S1 and S2 at various current densities. The rate performances of S1 and S2 are shown in Fig. 4b. Obviously, S2 shows a remarkably better electrochemical performance; as the current density is decreased to 0.5 A g−1 and 1 A g−1, specific capacitances of 965.98 F g−1 and 894.78 F g−1 are obtained, respectively. When the current density is increased to 5 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, the average capacitance gradually decreased to 512.96 F g−1 and 480.76 F g−1 for S2. With increasing current density, the decrease of capacitance is attributed to the presence of inner active sites that are unable to sustain the redox transitions completely.35The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) was generated and is shown in Fig. S7.† The negligible semicircle in the high frequency region indicates a low charge transfer resistance. While in the low frequency region, the more vertical line, leaning to the imaginary axis of S2 compared to S1, indicates a more facile electrolyte diffusion to the surface of S2 and a more ideal capacitor behavior.36,37 The aforementioned results suggest that S2 has an excellent electrochemical performance, which is in good agreement with the cycling performances.In summary, a hierarchical flower-like β-NiS architecture has been successfully synthesized and investigated as a supercapacitor electrode. Excellent electrochemical performances are exhibited by the flower-like structure design. It suggests a potential application of the flower-like β-NiS as an electrode material for supercapacitors.This work was supported by the National Natural of Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 20971070 and 21073095) and 111 project (B12015).Notes and referencesX.
