    , Accepted 13th June 2013First published on 14th June 2013AbstractThe synthesis of poly[(4,4′-(dihexyl)dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole)] has been carried out through Kumada catalyst transfer polycondensation and its copolymerization with 3-hexylthiophene (3HT) leads to well-defined diblock copolymers in terms of molecular characteristics. These copolymers show a wider absorption window than P3HT, which is of potential interest for photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
Electronic devices based on organic materials and especially solvent-processable conjugated polymers have potential advantages such as low cost, easy fabrication, light weight and flexibility compared to those made from inorganic semiconductors.1 Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most commonly used polymers in organic photovoltaics because of its good solubility in various organic solvents, high capacity for self-assembly and high charge carrier mobility.2 As the control of the morphology of the active blend is also of major importance to access high efficiency solar cells, the block copolymers that provide high nanostructured organisation have been the subject of increased interest.3 Recently Ren et al. reported the performance of block copolymers based on two different 3-alkylthiophenes, illustrating the influence of this strategy on the morphology.4 The copolymerisation of 3-hexylthiophene with a 3-alkoxythiophene, widely reported by Koeckelberghs' group, is another example of the nanostructuration provided by the block copolymers.5 However, the relatively poor overlap between the P3HT absorption spectrum and the low-energy part of the solar emission spectrum limits the power-conversion efficiencies to values of approximately 5%, as obtained from P3HT:PCBM solar cells.6 One solution could be the synthesis of (co)polymers with improved light harvesting in the red/near-infrared region. Recently, McCullough et al. reported on the polymerization of various aromatic and heteroaromatic dibromo compounds using a method that was previously applied to thiophene-based materials.7 Using Kumada Catalyst Transfer Polycondensation (KCTP), they were able to synthesize well-defined polyfluorenes (PF),8 polypyrroles (PPy)7 and polycarbazoles (PCZ).6b The KCTP method enables chain-growth polymerization and leads to the synthesis of conjugated polymers with relatively high molecular weight, narrow dispersity and minimized termination side-reactions.9 PF-b-P3HT and PF-b-poly(p-phenylene) (PF-b-PPP) diblock copolymers were also successfully synthesized using this method.10 KCTP thus seems to open the possibility of making a large variety of new conjugated (co)polymers.
Recently, different categories of silole-containing polymers, including alternating copolymers, have been reported to show promising characteristics as materials for polymer solar cells.11 Silole has the lowest LUMO energy level as well as a relatively high-lying HOMO level among heteroarene monomer units of π-conjugated polymers such as pyrrole, furan, thiophene and pyridine. The incorporation of a silicon bridge into a bithienyl moiety significantly reduces the HOMO–LUMO gap due to the newly formed extended planar π-conjugated tricyclic system (Scheme 1, M1) and σ*–π* conjugation between the σ*-orbital of the silicon atom and the π*-orbital of the bithiophene unit. This is expected to result in a shift of the absorption spectrum towards lower energies.

This work is focused on a novel silole-based polymer architecture, i.e., block copolymers with an extended optical absorption spectrum, via the KCTP polymerization of 2,7-dibromo-4,4′-(dihexyl)dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole (Scheme 1, M1) and its sequential copolymerization with 3-hexylthiophene (Scheme 1, M2).
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 presents the synthetic route to prepare the homopolymer P1 and the block copolymer P2. Prior to the polymerization using KCTP, the Grignard formation of M1 has been studied to determine the best reaction conditions and to confirm the formation of the mono-Grignard species only. This study was performed using GC-MS with n-hexadecane as an internal standard. Two main conclusions were drawn: the formation of the monosubstituted compound is achieved after 20 minutes with a maximum conversion of above 90% and GC-MS evidenced the formation of a single species.
Based on this result, the silole-based homopolymer P1 was synthesized by the KCTP reaction. The Grignard reagent of 2,7-dibromo-4,4′-(dihexyl)dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole M1 was prepared by addition of iPrMgCl and stirring for 20 minutes at 0 °C, and then transferred to a suspension of Ni(dppp)Cl2. The crude polymer was recovered after quenching, precipitation and filtration before purification by Soxhlet extraction. Homopolymers P1 with different molecular weights were synthesized with a conversion of 85% and relatively low dispersity (<2). The newly synthesized homopolymers were then analyzed by MALDI-ToF. As presented in Fig. S1,† the distribution is characterized by a 360.1 u peak to peak mass difference that is in agreement with the monomer mass unit. Moreover, mainly H/Br as end groups are identified, in agreement with the polymerization procedure.
Concerning the block copolymer P2, the synthesis was carried out by sequential addition of 2-chloromagnesio-7-bromo-4,4′-(dihexyl)dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole (leading to the first block B1) followed by introduction of 2-bromo-5-chloromagnesio-3-hexylthiophene to the active polymer chains. The same procedure was applied to recover the copolymer. Two different block copolymers are reported here. Proton NMR of P2a and P2b (Fig. S2†) allowed us to estimate the ratio between the two blocks to be 23/77 and 38/62 B1/P3HT (Table 1), respectively and to show that the regioregularity (RR) of the P3HT block is kept as high as for the homopolymerization of 3HT by KCTP (>98%). The molecular mass and the dispersity of P2 were determined by SEC (Fig. S3†) and the diblock copolymers were characterized by MALDI-ToF analysis (Fig. S4 and S5†). This technique allows us to confirm the presence of both comonomers (360.1 and 166.1 u) covalently connected and to highlight the nature of the block copolymer's end groups as H/Br.

The thermal stability of the homopolymers and copolymers has been investigated by TGA. P3HT shows a 1.5% mass loss at 300 °C, a maximum degradation temperature (MDT) around 485 °C and is completely degraded at 550 °C. P1c is less stable than P3HT as it presents 13% mass loss at 300 °C and an MDT at 475 °C. The block copolymers show thermal properties similar to P3HT, with only 3% mass loss up to 300 °C and an MDT at 488 °C for P2b.
In order to compare the optical properties of these new materials in films with those of P3HT, poly(3-hexylthiophene) was prepared under the same conditions (entry 1 in Table 1). The thin films were prepared by drop-casting 0.1 mg mL−1 (co)polymer solutions in chlorobenzene on glass substrates. The absorption band onset of P1c is clearly shifted to higher wavelengths with respect to P3HT (Δλmax = 65 nm; Fig. 1), confirming the favorable effect of the silole bridge in terms of bandgap reduction. Surprisingly, the block copolymer P2a does not show a similar extension of the absorption towards low energies and the spectrum is broad and unstructured. The absence of a vibronic structure indicates that the chains in the film are not in a fully extended, planar conformation, which is probably related to the low molecular weight of this copolymer. In contrast, the block copolymer P2b shows a shift in the absorption onset of 75 nm with respect to P3HT and is further red-shifted by 10 nm compared to P1c. In this case a vibronic structure is clearly present, which is characteristic of organized, highly conjugated polymer chains. The absorption window of the copolymer P2b is broader than for P3HT and its optical bandgap can be estimated to be 1.72 eV from the onset of the absorption band.
 Fig. 1  UV-Vis spectra of films of P3HT (squares), polymer P1c (triangles) and block copolymers P2a (diamonds) and P2b (circles). 
The transport properties of thin films of P1c and P2b were measured in a field-effect transistor configuration. The hole mobility of the homopolymer is rather low (1.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), whereas the copolymer shows a mobility similar to that of P3HT measured under the same conditions (2.25 × 10−3vs. 2.10–3 cm2 V−1 s−1). It thus appears that the introduction of a silole-based block does not affect the transport properties of the copolymer.
The microscopic morphology of thin deposits of the (co)polymers P1 and P2 was studied by AFM. The samples were prepared by drop-casting solutions (0.1 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) onto glass/ITO substrates followed by solvent annealing. P1c self-organizes into aggregates of oval shape of 1 μm long; this morphology can explain the low mobility value measured in FETs. As seen in Fig. 2, the short copolymer P2a shows long and well defined fibrils, with a typical width of 18 nm. Those structures are thought to arise from π–π stacking of polymer chains oriented ‘edge-on’ on the substrate. Such a morphology, often observed for P3HT, is expected to favor charge transport.12 In the case of the longer copolymer P2b, a fibrillar structure is also observed but the morphology shows a mixture of long thin and shorter fibrils and a broader distribution of the fibril thickness. This morphology can be attributed to the higher dispersity of P2b and/or to the limited solubility of this copolymer.

Based on the optical, charge transport and morphological properties, it seemed interesting to test P2b in photovoltaic cells. P2b was incorporated into photovoltaic devices using P2b:PC70BM ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, which are the most common ratios used in BHJ.13 Briefly, 24 mg of the copolymer and 24 or 48 mg of PC70BM were dissolved in 2–3 mL of chlorobenzene at 80 °C in a glove box. The solution was spin-coated at 800 rpm on an ITO-coated glass previously covered with a PEDOT-PSS layer. Using thermal deposition under vacuum a layer of 20 nm of Yb was then added followed by a layer of 100 nm of Al. Annealing at 120 °C for 10 minutes was performed on the devices before characterization. Cells with an active area of 0.21 cm2 were tested under ambient conditions under AM 1.5 light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Similar 1:1 P3HT:PC70BM cells were fabricated as standard devices, using the same conditions. The resulting J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3 and the values of open-circuit voltage Voc, current density Jsc, fill factor FF and power efficiency η are summarized in Table 2 for the three types of devices. The best device showed a Voc of 0.52 V, a Jsc of 7.68 mA cm−2 and a FF of 39%, resulting in an efficiency of 1.54%. The first conclusion concerns the importance of the P2b:PC70BM ratio, by doubling the PC70BM amount the performance of the devices increased by 96%. However, the power efficiency of the P2b devices remain lower than that of P3HT:PC70BM cells. The Voc and Jsc values of those non-optimized cells are as good as those of the corresponding P3HT device and the modest performance arises from the low value of the fill factor in the P2b devices. As this parameter is mainly related to the morphology of the blend, it shows how crucial is the optimization of the processing parameters such as solvent, annealing temperature, use of additives, etc. to obtain a good microscopic morphology, as it was done for the P3HT:PC70BM cells.14 This result is thus promising in terms of improvement’s opportunity but will require substantial optimization work.

Conclusions
Poly(4,4′-dihexyl-4H-silolo[3,2:b-4,5:b′]dithiophene) was synthesized via KCTP polymerization of the corresponding monomer; good control over the polymerization was achieved and the sequential copolymerization with 3HT led to well-defined block copolymers in terms of molecular characteristics. The window of light absorption of the copolymer P2b is significantly wider than for P3HT; the morphology of the copolymer retains the fibrillar arrangement of P3HT and the charge mobility is not affected by the incorporation of the silole block. These results led us to incorporate the block copolymer P2b into bulk heterojunction solar cells. The best cells show a decent efficiency, with Voc and Jsc comparable to those of P3HT.
Experimental part
2-Bromo-3-hexyl-5-iodothiophene was synthesized using the Yokoyama method.15 2,7-Dibromo-4,4′-(dihexyl)dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole was synthesized following the pathway reported by Getmanenko et al.16 and Hou et al.10b
Standard procedure for homopolymerization
To a solution of 2,7-dibromo-4,4′-(dihexyl)dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole (0.840 g, 1.6 mmol) in dry THF (15.0 mL) stirred at 0 °C was added iPrMgCl (2.0 M solution in THF, 0.8 mL, 1.6 mmol) via a syringe and the mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 20 min. This solution was transferred via a cannula to a suspension of Ni(dppp)Cl2 (31.3 mg, 0.058 mmol) in dry THF (15.0 mL) and the mixture was stirred at 4 °C overnight. Then a 5 N HCl aqueous solution was quickly added to quench the reaction. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes and then precipitated in cold MeOH. After filtration, the product was washed with MeOH, yielding a black solid. Low molecular mass fractions were removed by Soxhlet extraction using an appropriate solvent.

1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.12 (s, 2H), 1.52–1.14 (m, 16H), 0.91–0.85 (m, 10H).
Standard procedure for copolymerization
The procedure described before was used to prepare the first block but instead of quenching the reaction, a solution of 2-bromo-5-chloromagnesio-3-hexylthiophene (1.6 mmol) in dry THF (15 mL) was added via a cannula to the active polymer chains. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at 4 °C. Then a 5 N HCl aqueous solution was quickly added to quench the reaction. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes and then precipitated in cold MeOH. The product was washed with MeOH, yielding a dark solid. Low molecular mass fractions were removed by Soxhlet extraction using an appropriate solvent. The high molecular weight fraction represents 76 to 81% of the crude copolymer.
