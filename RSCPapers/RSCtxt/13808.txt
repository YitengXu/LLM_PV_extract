1. Introduction
As energy demand and consumption continue to increase, traditional non-renewable fossil energy sources, such as oil and coal, play an important role in society, which has greatly promoted social development. However, mining and use processes have also caused serious harm to the eco-environment and the living environment of humans, and these resources are becoming scarcer.1 Therefore, the development and utilization of renewable clean energy and advanced energy storage devices are particularly urgent.2–4 Methods for developing sustainable and renewable energy, efficiently storing energy, and reducing energy losses and environmental burden is a topic that requires long term research and discussion. There is an indirect relationship between energy generation and consumption. It is essential to develop novel, low cost, and environmentally friendly energy conversion and energy storage systems, while developing new sustainable and renewable energy sources.5–7 Energy storage is an important part of energy research, and more and more researchers pay attention to energy storage and research.8–14 At present, three main types of electrical energy storage and conversion devices are batteries, electrochemical supercapacitors, and dielectric capacitors. As shown in Fig. 1, the battery usually has a high energy density, but its power density is small and it is very harmful to the environment.15 The electrochemical supercapacitor has moderate energy density and power density, but its structure is complex, the working voltage is low, the leakage current is high, and the cycle time is short.16 Compared with batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors, dielectric capacitors based on high energy density dielectric materials have advantages of high power density, wide temperature range, high charge and discharge rate, long cycle time, and are a type of energy storage device with great potential.17–19

High energy density dielectric materials are very popular in modern electronic and electrical systems, and they are important materials for manufacturing high performance capacitors, sensors, spacecraft and electrical stress control devices.21–25 In recent years, the developments of high performance electronic devices have been moving toward integration and miniaturization, and higher requirements have been set on the energy density of materials. It is hoped that materials with better comprehensive performance will be obtained.26 With the development of new energy technologies and long distance power transmission technologies, as well as the popularity of mobile devices and new energy powered vehicles, user requirements for efficient energy storage technologies and equipment are also increasing.27,28 The traditional dielectric capacitor is an excellent representative in the field of electrical storage devices and power electronic systems. At present, the shortage of dielectric capacitors is mainly due to their low energy density, which is generally caused by the energy storage medium between capacitors. The demand for improving the performance and technology of dielectric capacitors has been increasing constantly. In particular, the rapid development of new energy technologies has led to higher requirements for high energy density dielectric materials. In recent years, this field has attracted the attention of many researchers and has become a popular research topic. As shown in Fig. 2, the total number of papers published in the past decade has exhibited exponential growth, and the research has made breakthroughs and achieved progress. PVDF is a popular dielectric energy storage material with high breakdown strength, medium dielectric constant, light weight and easy processing. Adding PbZr1−xTixO3 (PZT)29 with high dielectric constant into PVDF matrix, PZT/PVDF nanocomposite film is a kind of nanocomposite material with high energy density, but it has a certain negative impact on the natural environment. With the enhancement of human awareness of environmental protection, more studies have chosen TiO2, BT, SrTiO3, BaxSr1−xTiO3 and other materials with little harm to the environment as fillers of nanocomposite films. Compared with TiO2, SrTiO3 and BaxSr1−xTiO3 and other materials, BT has a high dielectric constant. Adding BT into PVDF can improve the overall dielectric constant of materials to a greater extent, which is conducive to the improvement of energy density of materials. Among many dielectric materials, BT/PVDF nanocomposite is one of the most studied dielectric energy storage materials. Studies have found that the energy density of BT/PVDF nanocomposites can be improved by surface modification of BT,30 construction of appropriate core–shell structure,31 introduction of the third phase (silver, gold, graphene, etc.)32 and design of reasonable structure.33

Energy storage is a field with important research significance. In the past ten years, it has been extensively studied and made many substantial achievements. Polymer-based nanocomposites for energy storage applications have always been a hot topic, including various important aspects. Some reviews summarize the theories and research status of different polymer-based nanocomposite energy storage materials.34,35 Some reviews mainly summarize the influence of different structures, such as core–shell structure and multilayer structure, on the energy storage density of materials, and summarize the interface and the important role of interface of polymer-based nanocomposite dielectric.36–39 Some reviews selected PVDF-based ferroelectric polymers and PVDF-based nanocomposites filled with different fillers as discussion objects, and summarized their research progress in the field of energy storage.40 These reviews are more about how to improve the energy density of materials, but there is no detailed discussion about why the energy density will increase. In addition, there are many research papers on BT/PVDF based energy storage materials, which need to be summarized specifically. Such an article is of great significance to the research in this direction and can provide relevant theoretical views and research ideas. Therefore, in this paper the energy storage theory from the physical basis of dielectric materials and energy storage is analyzed, and the related research on BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite films with high energy density in recent years is classified and summarized. Focus is placed on the possible mechanisms of improvement of energy density under different strategies, with the expectation that the mystery of the increase in energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites will be explained, and new ideas for the development of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites with better energy density will be provided. Finally, the BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage films are summarized and the outlook for future development and the problems to be solved are provided.
2. Dielectric material and its energy storage
Based on the theoretical basis of dielectric physics, the related physical parameters, such as relative dielectric constant and breakdown strength, are briefly introduced. The factors determining the energy density of materials are discussed, providing the theoretical support for the improvement of the energy density of materials.
2.1. Physical basis for dielectric material and energy storage
A dielectric material is capable of storing energy under an applied electric field because of its polarization under an electric field. The relative dielectric constant εr represents the magnitude of the dielectric polarization, i.e., (1)Where ε is a dielectric constant, ε0 a vacuum dielectric constant, and ε0 = 8.85 × 10−12 F m−1. The dielectric constant of a material is usually expressed as a relative dielectric constant unless otherwise specified. When the dielectric constant is higher, the ability of the material to polarize is stronger, more inductive charge is generated on the dielectric surface, and more energy is stored in the dielectric material, i.e., a higher energy density is realized.
The dielectric breakdown strength (Eb) is affected by many factors, such as the properties of the material, trace impurities, micro defects, and micro structures, and is an important parameter affecting the energy density of the dielectric material. In general, a dielectric material with a lower breakdown strength has a better dielectric property.41–43 The dielectric property of dielectric materials is closely related to its energy density.
For dielectric capacitors, energy density is one of the most important parameters for evaluating the performance of dielectric energy storage. The energy density of a dielectric material refers to the electrical energy stored in a unit volume of the dielectric material. Generally, as shown in Fig. 3, the blue region is the energy density of the dielectric, the pink region the energy loss, and the red line the breakdown strength. The energy density is calculated by integrating the region between the polarization axis and discharge curve using (2)Where Ue is the energy density, and the electric displacement D corresponds to the maximum electric field strength E. When the electric field strength is constant, reducing the energy loss of the dielectric material is beneficial to increasing its energy density. The relationship between the electric displacement and the applied electric field can be expressed by D = εrε0E(3)Where ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant and εr the relative dielectric constant of the dielectric; as shown in eqn (1), the product of ε0 and εr is the dielectric constant of the material. For dielectric materials with high dielectric constant, the electrical displacement D is very close to the polarization P. Therefore, (4)
 Fig. 3  Graphical representation of polarization–electric field (P–E) loop used for energy storage calculation. The blue area is the energy density (Ue) and the pink area is the energy loss (Ul). 
For linear dielectrics, permanent dipoles are not contained, the εr value is constant, the electric displacement shows a linear variation with the electric field, and the residual polarization Pr is zero. Then, the energy density is (5)And its energy efficiency is (6)where Ue is the energy density and Ul is the energy loss.
The P–E loop of the dielectric material can be used to not only calculate its energy density, but also clearly distinguish its intrinsic physical properties. Fig. 4 shows the P–E loops for three types of typical dielectrics. In view of this, dielectric materials can be roughly classified into linear dielectrics (paraelectric materials), ferroelectric materials, and antiferroelectric materials. When the types of dielectrics are different, the changing trend of εr with E is different, the shapes of P–E loops are different, and there are pronounced differences in energy density and efficiency. For linear dielectrics (see Fig. 4a and b), since εr is independent of the applied electric field, P–E loops exhibit a linear relationship and has a high Eb, a low Pmax, a Pr value of zero, and a low energy density. For ferroelectric materials (see Fig. 4c and d), εr is related to the applied electric field, and P–E loops exhibit a distinct nonlinear relationship with high Eb, Pmax, and Pr values. Owing to the presence of electric hysteresis effect and remanent polarization, the electrical energy stored in the material is not completely released, the energy loss portion (the closed portion of hysteresis loop) should be removed from the effective energy density, and the energy density is low. Antiferroelectric materials (see Fig. 4e and f) possess high Eb and Pmax values and a small Pr value, and exhibit two distinctly different hysteresis characteristics in the P–E loop: the linear behavior at weak electric fields and the double hysteresis characteristic at high electric fields. Their theoretical energy density is generally higher than those of the first two types of materials. A higher breakdown strength and higher electric displacement indicate a higher energy density.44 Based on the above analysis, physical quantities of dielectric materials, such as dielectric constant, remanent polarization, and breakdown strength are significant for their energy storage.

2.2. High dielectric constant and high breakdown strength are critical to increasing dielectric energy density
In recent decades, polymer materials have been widely used in various fields, such as electrical and electronic engineering, engineering construction, and aerospace engineering, because of their excellent mechanical properties and processability. Polymer films with large area, high flatness, low cost, and ultra-low thickness have been produced on a large scale and used as thin film dielectric capacitors in the field of energy storage, but their relatively low energy density limits their applications.18,45,46 Among them, biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film has advantages of high breakdown strength (>600 MV m−1), low overall dielectric loss (<0.02%), low dependence of dielectric constant on temperature frequency, and excellent mechanical properties. It has become one of the most popular commercial polymer capacitor film materials. However, BOPP has a dielectric constant of only 2.2, resulting in a very small energy density (<2 J cm−3),47,48 which severely limits further development in the field of energy storage. Ceramic material has a high dielectric constant (102 to 103), but its mechanical properties are poor and the material is difficult to process. Additionally, the breakdown strength is small (∼10 MV m−1), the material is easily broken down, and its energy density is usually low.49,50 The low energy density of a single material, such as polymer or ceramic, cannot meet the future demand for high energy storage characteristics, so it is imperative to develop new high performance dielectric materials with high energy density. To effectively improve the energy density of dielectric materials for polymer film capacitors, in addition to the development of new polymers with high dielectric polarization and dielectric response, the most feasible strategy is to develop new high energy density nanocomposites composed of a polymer matrix with a high breakdown strength and fillers with a high dielectric constant. As shown in Fig. 5, organic polymers and inorganic ceramics have distinct characteristics with excellent properties as well as apparent drawbacks. It is expected that the new nanocomposites can combine the advantages of an organic polymer matrix (high breakdown strength, high flexibility, and easy processability) and inorganic ceramic fillers (high dielectric constant and high polarization), and offset their disadvantages, thus further enhancing the functional properties of the material.34 Unlike using microparticles as fillers, the use of nanoscale fillers in high dielectric constant and high energy storage composites can help reduce surface defects, increase interfacial polarization, and accommodate the needs of gradual miniaturization and integration of modern electronics industry structures. While ensuring functionality, the limited safe operating voltage must allow the largest possible safe electric field, maximally enhancing the electric displacement and energy density of the composite.
 Fig. 5  Advantages and disadvantages of organic polymers and inorganic ceramics. 
It can be gleaned from eqn (5) and (6) that the dielectric constant and breakdown strength of the dielectric material determine its energy density; that is, to obtain a dielectric material with high energy density, materials with high dielectric constant and high breakdown strength should be selected. The preparation of nanocomposites with high dielectric constant ceramics as the filler and high breakdown strength polymer as the matrix is an important method of improving the energy density of materials. It is worth noting that the dielectric constant of the filler should not be as high as possible, and the difference in dielectric constant between the filler and matrix is unfavorable for the overall performance of the composite. The inorganic nanoceramic particles with a high dielectric constant, such as BT,51–58 TiO2 (TO),59–61 CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO),62–64 SrTiO3 (ST),65,66 BaxSr1−xTiO3 (BST),67–71 Na2Ti3O7,72 Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3,73 and Ba1−x CaxZryTi1−yO3 (BCZT),74 should be selected as the fillers, which are uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix with a high breakdown strength to prepare ceramic-polymer nanocomposites. Among them, the use of PVDF, BT, and BT/PVDF as the matrix is the most widely studied. It is expected that the material can satisfy both high dielectric constant and high breakdown strength, thereby obtaining high energy density. At the same time, the dielectric properties and energy density of the nanocomposites can be adjusted by adding different types of ceramic fillers with various structures.
3. BT, PVDF, and BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage materials
As an energy storage material, the organic polymer PVDF and inorganic ceramic filler BT each have unique advantages, but also has their own disadvantages. An attempt should be made to understand their respective structures, physicochemical properties, and applications, which can have important guiding significance for the development of new BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage materials. A summary of current BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage materials can provide reference for the development of new energy storage materials.
3. 1. Properties and applications of BT materials
BT is a typical crystalline inorganic nonmetallic material with perovskite structure. The crystal form of BT changes with temperature, and differences exist among different BT crystal forms in terms of dielectric constant. Fig. 6a and b are BT unit-cell structures with Ti4+ and Ba2+ as centers, respectively. In BT crystals, Ti4+ is coordinated with six O2− ions, Ba2+ is coordinated with 12 O2− ions, and O2− is coordinated with two Ti4+ ions and four Ba2+ ions. BT has five crystal forms of hexagonal symmetry, tetragonal symmetry, cubic symmetry, trigonal symmetry, and orthogonal symmetry. Fig. 6c shows the phase transition of the BT crystal as a function of temperature, and the direction of polarization is indicated by a blue arrow. Specifically, the BT crystal undergoes a paraelectric ferroelectric phase transition at 394 K. The change in temperature causes the Ti4+ in the center of the body to become unstable, and it will shift relatively to a certain vertex of the surrounding oxygen octahedron. The structure gradually changes from a cubic structure to a tetragonal structure. When the temperature was lower than 394 K, it became a tetragonal phase, the c and a axes of the tetragonal BT become longer and shorter, respectively, and the structure was stable in the temperature range of 279–394 K. BT had an orthogonal structure in the temperature range 181–279 K, and had a trigonal phase at below 181 K. As the temperature changes, the crystal form of BT changes, and therefore its dielectric constant also changes.
 Fig. 6  (a) The BT cell structure centered on Ti4+. (b) The BT cell structure centered on Ba2+. (c) The crystal phase transition of BT crystal with temperature change. 
BT is a multi-functional material with numerous advantages. Extensive research on BT has been conducted in energy conversion, energy storage, photocatalysis, and microwave absorption, and there have been important applications in the above fields, as shown in Fig. 7. BT with a perovskite structure is a typical piezoelectric material that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The BT film can be deposited on the Pt/Ti/SiO2/(100)Si matrix and polarized. When the film was periodically bent and deformed, an output voltage of up to 1.0 V could be generated, the output current could reach 26 nA, the output current density was 0.19 A cm−2, and the power density was 7 mW cm−3.75 A custom made optical chopper was used to modulate the sunlight. The light to heat conversion bilayer film with a top layer of carbon black (CB) and a bottom layer of BT/PVDF could reach a degradation efficiency of 75% for Rhodamine B (RhB) dye within 6 h, and a highly efficient thermal catalytic reaction could be achieved by the composite film. This design provides a new idea for the use of solar energy or even waste heat for thermal catalytic reactions.76 BT has an excellent pyroelectric effect, which converts difficult to measure heat into electrical signals that are easy to measure, such as current and voltage. Even small temperature fluctuations can generate electrical signals, which can be used in the recycling of waste heat from the environment. Illumination with a light at 365 nm can generate heat. Ag/BT/Ag devices can convert heat into current, voltage, and other electrical signals, enable the detection of 365 nm light, and comprise a self-powered 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) detector. In addition, compared with UV illumination, the thermoelectric effect induced by heating enhances the light response at 365 nm, and the corresponding photoconductive gain and response rate can be significantly increased by more than 1200%.77 Lithium-ion batteries have been successfully commercialized and widely used in mobile electronic devices due to their high energy density and long service life. Si/carbon nanotube (CNT)/BT nanocomposite can be used as the anode of the battery. The Si nanoparticle undergoes lithiation to form a volume expansion when the Li22Si4 phase is formed. The stress generated when CNT constrains the expansion is transferred to BT, which can be poled, so that a piezoelectric potential is generated. The increase in ion mobility increases the discharge capacity and cycle performance of lithium ions. The new Si/CNT/BT nanocomposite anode, which utilizes the synergistic effect of Si and BT, improves its electrochemical performance and is an anode for a lithium-ion battery with great development potential.78 At gigahertz frequencies, BT is a typical relaxation dielectric material that can be used for microwave absorption.79 Molten hydrated salt was used as the reaction medium, and the superstructured cages mesocrystalline BT was synthesized in one step without adding a template. The hollow supercage and mesocrystalline structures increase the possibility of multiple reflections and interfacial polarization relaxation loss. In the high frequency region (13–18 GHz), the dielectric constant is large, the dielectric loss is large, and the microwave absorption property is excellent.80 BT-based ceramics have high dielectric constant, low energy loss, long service life, and high power density. Therefore, they are also a type of material with research value and application prospects in the field of energy storage. Ultrafine BT ceramics with an average particle size of 122 nm were sintered at 180 °C by the cold sintering (CS) method. The relative density of these ceramics was greater than 96%. At breakdown strength of 90 kV cm−1, the energy density reached 1.45 J cm−3 and the energy storage efficiency reached 85.6%. Such a high density structure is one of the main reasons for the high energy density of the BT ceramic.81 The core–shell structure is an interesting structure, and a suitable core–shell structure can improve some properties of the nanoparticles. BT@SiO2 nanoparticles with moderate shell thickness were prepared via the sol-precipitation method after adjusting the concentration of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). The SiO2 shell can affect the microstructure of the ceramics, and the remodeling of the microstructure shows considerable impact on the leakage current density and dielectric properties and has an important contribution to the energy density of ceramics. The maximum energy density of BT@SiO2 could reach 4.799 J cm−3 at 370 kV cm−1.82 0.87BaTiO3–0.13Bi(Zn2/3(Nb, Ta)1/3)O3(BT–BZNT) is a new type of relaxation ferroelectric material and can be prepared into a BT–BZNT multilayer energy storage ceramic capacitor (MLESCC) having two dielectric layers (layer thickness 5 μm). This BT–BZNT MLESCC could achieve an excellent energy density of 10.12 J cm−3 and an efficiency of 89.4% at 104.7 MV m−1, and is one of the materials with the highest energy density among lead-free relaxation ferroelectric multilayer ceramic materials.83 Reports of using BT material alone as the energy storage material are relatively rare, and BT material is usually used for doping and preparing composite materials with other components.84–86

3.2. Properties and applications of PVDF materials
PVDF is a typical dielectric energy storage material, which consists of a simple structural unit (CF2–CH2)n. PVDF exists in the forms of crystalline phase and amorphous phase. Several different crystals can be manifested in the crystalline phase, and three most representative configurations are α phase, β phase, and γ phase (see Fig. 8). For α phase, it is not polarized as a whole,87,88β phase has a large spontaneous polarization, and the polarity of γ phase is less than that of β phase.89 The different configurations of PVDF exhibit different polarities and increasing the relative content of the crystal form with a relatively high polarity is beneficial to increasing the energy density of PVDF.90 In addition, the size of the domains in PVDF has an effect on its polarization. Large domains under high electric field are not conducive to dipole polarization. When the dipole does not match the change in the electric field, the dielectric loss will increase. The nanodomains are flexible and can respond quickly to the change in electric fields. The degree of polarization is large, the dielectric loss is small, and an early occurrence of saturated polarization at the early stage of weak electric field is avoided, thereby increasing the energy density of the material. Therefore, the degree of crystallinity, relative content of various crystal phases, and sizes of domains all affect the energy density of the PVDF film.

PVDF has good mechanical, thermal, electrical, and chemical stability. It is a multifunctional polymer material with good comprehensive performance, and has been widely applied in many fields, such as energy conversion, wearable electronics, sensors, biomedicine, information storage, and bio-detection (see Fig. 9). In 1998, PVDF materials were first applied to flexible wearable devices, and the material was integrated into shoes to collect the mechanical energy generated when people are walking.92 This is an important attempt in the application of PVDF, and also has had a positive impact on the development of wearable devices. The flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator is a mechanical energy collection and conversion device that can easily collect low frequency mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy. The PVDF/Al2O3–RGO (reduced graphene oxide) flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator has high output, fast charging capability, high durability, and high stability. This high performance piezoelectric nanogenerator (HPNG) instantly illuminates multiple commercial LEDs and powers watches, calculators, treble speakers, and LCD screens. Surprisingly, even in 158400 cycles, the HPNG exhibits excellent durability and excellent power generation, and has potential applications in portable and flexible electronic devices.93 PVDF has pyroelectric properties and is a candidate material for the preparation of pyroelectric nanogenerators. A partially coated Al electrode is applied on the PVDF film, and faster and larger temperature fluctuations and optimization of the pyroelectric energy conversion efficiency are achieved by adjusting the electrode area coverage and improving heat transfer. When the electrode area was 45%, the peak voltage was 59 V and the peak current was 30 nA. At an oscillation temperature of 2.8 °C, the energy density of each thermal cycle was 66.9 μJ cm−3.94 Based on the principle of piezoelectric sensing, PVDF can be used as a sensor to simultaneously monitor heartbeat and breathing,95,96 detecting the pulsating vibration and periodic deformation of the chest wall during heartbeat and breathing and converting them into an electrical signal. The sensor patch is capable of producing heartbeat and respiratory signals consistent with commercial electrocardiograms and respiratory effort transducers, respectively, and the test results are not significantly different from those obtained from commercial products.97 There is an electric potential between the bone and the periosteum. When the bone is fractured, the potential of the part is lowered, and after the bone is healed, the potential is restored. The PVDF-based polymer film is piezoelectric, provides electrical stimulation, repairs the biological microelectronic environment, and facilitates bone regeneration.98 By controlling the content of β phase in poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene) P(VDF-TrFE), the surface potential of the membrane is adjusted to be suitable for bone regeneration, providing optimal electrical stimulation, improving bone formation, and offering the optimal effect on repairing bone defects.99 PVDF-based nanofilms have the advantages of good flexibility, strong applicability, high stability, and a simple preparation process, and have broad application prospects in bone regeneration. PVDF-based polymers are also ferroelectric and can meet the requirements of flexible memory devices. P(VDF-TrFE) films are epitaxially grown on chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene, which can be applied to metal/ferroelectric polymer/metal (MFM) capacitors and ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs)—two memory components. Al/P(VDF-TrFE)/graphene capacitors exhibit excellent ferroelectricity and high remanent polarization, and epitaxial growth of P(VDF-TrFE) plays a key role in MFM devices. FeFETs exhibit write/read cycling endurance characteristics and flexibility, and FeFETs can operate normally even under severe folding deformation.100 PVDF has high protein binding ability, high sensitivity, low autofluorescence intensity, high chemical resistances, and high resistance to mechanical damage and is an ideal film for protein analysis. The conjugated olefinic double bond formed in alkali-modified PVDF displays near infra-red emission at 750 nm, which improves the detection of high molecular weight protein (130 kDa), thereby efficiently and rapidly detecting the high molecular weight protein.101 Waterproof and breathable films that prevent droplet penetration have potential applications in chemistry, aerospace equipment, and building materials. Microsphere fiber interpenetrated superhydrophobic microporous PVDF film was prepared by the electrospinning technique, and the microporosity and pore size were controlled by adjusting the concentration of PVDF. The film has excellent waterproof and breathable properties.102 In general, polymers have an irreplaceable status in the preparation of high energy density materials due to their high breakdown strength and excellent mechanical elasticity. Table 1 summarizes the dielectric properties of common polymers. It can be found that PVDF has a high breakdown strength (150–500 MV m−1). Importantly, PVDF has a dielectric constant εr ≈ 10, which is higher than that of general polymers. High breakdown strength and a high dielectric constant are two key factors for obtaining high energy density materials. Therefore, PVDF is a popular flexible matrix material for preparing nanocomposite energy storage materials. Importantly, PVDF-based materials have very broad application prospects.

3.3. BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites
There are a large number of related studies on PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage materials, and numerous types of reinforcing phases, e.g., BT, ST, BST, TO, Al2O3, and so on. Table 2 summarizes the research progress on PVDF-based nanocomposites in recent years. BT and PVDF are a classic combination of nanocomposite energy storage materials. They usually exhibit excellent energy density and are of great research value. BT is a multi-functional material that has been widely studied. After long term research, the various properties of BT have been gradually understood by researchers. At the same time, after continuous improvement, its production process is relatively mature and its price relatively cheap. Most importantly, BT nanoparticles (NPs) are often used as reinforcing phases in composite materials and are introduced into matrix materials with high breakdown strength, such as polymer and glass, to optimize the properties of materials.120–125 Considering the existing theoretical basis and the progress of experimental research, BT is one of the most suitable materials for a composite energy storage material. While the breakdown strength is ensured, inorganic ceramic BT having a high dielectric constant is added to PVDF to increase the overall dielectric constant of the nanocomposite, thereby increasing the energy density of the material.

However, the addition of ceramic filler BT will cause some structural defects, such as pores in the polymer matrix, which inevitably lead to poor processability of BT/PVDF matrix composites, an increase in internal defects, sudden deterioration of mechanical properties, and increases in leakage current and dielectric loss.134–136 In particular, the large difference in dielectric constant between the filler BT and the PVDF matrix causes a substantial increase in the local electric field concentration, thereby reducing the breakdown strength of the composite.137 Usually, a large volume of BT is required to achieve a substantial increase in the dielectric constant of the composite, but the flexibility and processability of the material are reduced. Additionally, as the volume of the added BT increases, more pores will be produced in the material. Owing to the small dielectric constant of air, the introduction of the air phase causes the dielectric constant of the material to decrease, and the breakdown strength decreases greatly, which is disadvantageous for increasing the energy density of the material.138 Therefore, it is necessary to increase the energy density in the development of new BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage materials.
4. Improved mechanisms of energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites
Researchers have made several attempts in recent years to optimize the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites, such as constructing appropriate core–shell structures to modify the surface of BT, introducing buffer layers, selecting fillers of different dimensions, multiphase doping, and designing different structures. This series of methods has the potential to further increase the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites, but the mechanism underlying energy density enhancement of each method is not the same. Fig. 10 shows several possible mechanisms of energy density enhancements. The mechanisms of energy density enhancement of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites are diverse and complex, and one method may contain two or more enhancement mechanisms. When designing materials, researchers often try to use several methods simultaneously and expect that more mechanisms can be combined and a synergistic effect can be produced to obtain BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites with high energy density. However, such design approaches increase the complexity of the energy density enhancement mechanism, making the analysis of the mechanism underlying the energy density improvement of the designed novel BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites more difficult. In this section, the mechanisms of energy density improvement of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites are summarized and classified, and focus directed to the improvement mechanism. The main related research directions in recent years are analyzed and discussed, with the hope of uncovering the possible mechanisms of energy density improvement of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites from this novel prospective.
 Fig. 10  Schematic diagrams of various mechanisms for increasing the energy density of BT/PVDF nanocomposites. 
4.1. Improving compatibility and dispersibility
With BT being used as the filler and PVDF as the matrix, the surface energy difference between the filler and matrix is large in the process of preparing BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites, and the filler is prone to agglomeration and difficult to uniformly disperse in the matrix. When the filler BTs are zero dimensional (0D) nanoparticles, 1D nanofibers, and 2D nanosheets, respectively, the degree of agglomeration occurring under the same filler volume is different. Objectively, compared with other types of BT, since the preparation process of BT nanoparticles is a mature technology and has been commercialized, there has been relatively more research done on the preparation of nanocomposites by adding BT nanoparticles to PVDF. Since nanoparticles have large specific surface area and high surface energy, there is a strong interaction between them, which causes the agglomeration phenomenon to be most serious and the uniformity of the obtained material to be greatly affected. BT and PVDF are two types of materials with dramatically different properties. The compatibility problem existing between the two phases allows pores to be easily formed in BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites. Especially when the filler volume is relatively high can the poor dispersion of BT often cause numerous pores and defects in BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites, reducing the density of polymer-based nanocomposites. These problems will have a negative impact on the interfacial phases, such as the BT–PVDF interfacial phase, BT–BT interfacial phase, and void PVDF interfacial phase in BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites, which is not conducive to an increase in the polarization of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites. The relative dielectric constant of BT/PVDF composites decreases and the increase of dielectric loss is accelerated. In addition, the problems, such as agglomeration and voids in BT, may adversely affect the insulation properties of polymer-based nanocomposites, and reduce the breakdown strength of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites. This series of disadvantages will eventually lead to a dramatic reduction in the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites.
The distribution of BT in PVDF has an important influence on the overall performance of the composite. A quantitative method is introduced to describe the distribution of ceramic nanoparticles in the polymer matrix and a quantitative standard zm is defined. The larger the zm value, the more uniform the distribution of ceramic nanoparticles in the polymer matrix. If the value of zm is greater than 10, this situation can be considered a highly uniform and idealized distribution. Then, the effects of ceramic nanoparticle distribution on the dielectric response and breakdown strength of nanocomposites are studied by the finite element and phase field methods. Fig. 11a–d show the breakdown situations at different zm values; the blue line indicates the breakdown path, and, in most cases, the breakdown path is curved. The ceramic nanoparticles in Fig. 11d are the most ideal distribution, the distance between all the particles is the same, and the breakdown path is a straight line. As zm value increases, the dielectric response of the nanocomposite decreases slightly, but the breakdown strength is considerably enhanced. The dielectric stability of the nanocomposite is relatively high with a high electric field level being applied and shows a sharp decline with a critical electric field being applied. The uneven distribution of the BT nanoparticles can increase the concentration of the local electric field, thereby slightly enhancing the dielectric response, but severely reducing the breakdown strength of the nanocomposite.139

The original BT nanoparticles (c-BT) were treated with H2O2 to obtain surface hydroxylated BT nanoparticles (h-BT), which were then mixed with PVDF to form h-BT/PVDF nanocomposite film. As shown in Fig. 12a, during the mixing process a hydrogen bond is formed between the hydroxyl group (–OH) on the surface of the h-BT nanoparticle and the F atom on the PVDF molecular chain. As a result, the interaction between the h-BT nanoparticle and PVDF is stronger than that between c-BT particles and PVDF. Compared with c-BT/PVDF nanocomposites, h-BT particles can be better dispersed in PVDF, the compatibility is improved, and h-BT particles are tightly bound to PVDF. The breakdown strength of air is very low (3 MV m−1). The presence of pores can reduce the breakdown strength of the material. Under the same filler volume, the porosity of h-BT/PVDF nanocomposites is significantly lower than that of c-BT/PVDF, the compactness is improved, therefore, the breakdown strength of h-BT/PVDF nanocomposites is higher than that of c-BT/PVDF. In addition, the dielectric loss of h-BT/PVDF nanocomposites was 0.02, which was lower than the dielectric loss of c-BT/PVDF nanocomposites, which increases its potential application. The composite with 20 vol% of h-BT particles, via calculation, had a maximum energy density of 3.7 J cm−3.140

Surface modification of BT nanofibers (NFs) could be carried out with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS), as shown in Fig. 12b. APS is like a bridge between BT and PVDF, F atoms of PVDF and –NH2 group of APS are bonded, and the -Si(OC2H5)3 group of APS is bonded with the –OH group on the surface of BT NFs. The APS-modified BT NFs (BT NFs-APS) are well dispersed, have no apparent pores, and are strongly bound to the PVDF matrix. At 2.5 vol% of BT NFs, the energy density of surface-modified BT nanocomposites at an electric field of 330 MV m−1 was 5.6 J cm−3, which was approximately 126% higher than that of untreated BT nanocomposites at an electric field of 230 MV m−1. Compared to untreated BT NFs/PVDF nanocomposites, BT NFs-APS/PVDF nanocomposites exhibited higher energy density and efficiency. This is because, while a high dielectric constant and a low dielectric loss are maintained, the uniformity of the material is increased, considerably increasing the breakdown strength of the material.141
Good wettability is a necessary condition for the bonding of nanoparticle fillers to the matrix of the composite because contact is a prerequisite for compatibility. The surface energy difference between inorganic BT and organic PVDF hinders their good combination, which is manifested by the poor wettability of nanoparticles in solution, often leading to interface defects of nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 12c, after treatment with the titanate coupling agent TC-2, surfacecoated BT NPs (mBT) are obtained, and hydrogen bonds are formed between the hydroxyl groups on the surface of mBT NPs (–OH) and F atoms on the PVDF molecular chain. The contact angle of mBT NPs with PVDF solution is much smaller than that of the original BT NPs, and the contact angle decreases faster over time, which contributes to the improvement of the compatibility of BT NPs with the PVDF matrix. The thickness of the shell of the filler is also not negligible for the overall properties of the material. A suitable shell thickness can maximize the material breakdown strength. The breakdown strength of the material with 4 vol% of BT/PVDF was greatly increased from approximately 375 to 517 kV mm−1 for the material with 4 vol% of mBT-2/PVDF (with 0.2 mL of TC-2-treated BT) nanocomposites. At 4 vol% of mBT-2/PVDF, the maximum discharge energy density reached 11.27 J cm−3, which was approximately twice as much as that of 4 vol% of BT/PVDF.142

Fig. 12d–f correspond to the surface modifications of BT with 1-tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA), polyvinylprrolidone (PVP), and hydantoin, respectively. These three strategies can all improve the compatibility and dispersibility between BT and PVDF to some extent and improve the density, thus increasing the energy density.

Table 3 summarizes the recent studies on improving the compatibility and dispersibility of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites. The experimental data show that, by improving the compatibility and dispersibility between the filler and polymer matrix and improving the uniformity of the polymer-based nanocomposite, the problems of agglomeration, voids, and the interfacial phase caused by the introduction of BT can be alleviated, thereby improving the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites. Therefore, it can be assumed that improving the compatibility and dispersibility between the BT filler and PVDF matrix is one of the effective mechanisms for improving the energy density of the BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite.

4.2. Increasing polarization area
The polarization area is an important parameter for polarization. Increasing the polarization area can increase the polarization. Therefore, the energy density of materials is very different when the fillers with the same volume and different sizes are added to the matrix. For example, for a particulate filler, at the same filler volume, the nanoparticle provides approximately N times the interfacial area compared to coarse particles (N = R/r, where R and r are the radii of the coarse particles and nanoparticle, respectively), which can substantially enhance the interfacial polarization.
Ultrafine BT nanoparticles with an average particle size of 8.0 nm can be prepared by the “TEG (triethylene glycol)-sol” method, and the ultrathin core–shell BT@SiO2 structure can be prepared by the Stöber method, as shown in Fig. 13. The SiO2 shell layer ensures a high breakdown strength Eb of the nanocomposite (the effect of the SiO2 layer on Eb will be discussed in Section 4.4). The ultrafine core–shell structure maintains many BT/SiO2 interfaces, which is estimated to be approximately 11.5 times larger than that of the normal 100 nm filler. This is the main reason for high interfacial polarization. When the amount of coated SiO2 was increased from 0 to 8 wt%, the theoretical thickness of SiO2 was only 0.1–1.5 nm. Although the dielectric constant of SiO2 is small, the SiO2 layer is ultrathin, so the electric displacement D of the nanocomposite is mainly determined by the interface. The introduction of the SiO2 layer introduces an additional BT/SiO2/PVDF interface. Since SiO2 does not provide sufficient space charge, the SiO2/PVDF interface has relatively weak interfacial polarization. Similar to the BT/PVDF interface in BT nanocomposite films that are not coated with SiO2, the BT/SiO2 interface maintains high interfacial polarization and provides a high dielectric constant. Owing to the large specific surface area of the ultrafine BT@SiO2 structure, the high polarization BT/SiO2 interface and the low polarization SiO2/PVDF interface led to an increase in dielectric constant when the amount of coated SiO2 was 0–8 wt%. It can be seen that infinitely small BT@SiO2 particles are dispersed in PVDF to form a superuniform system. At this time, interfacial polarization is the main source of polarization, and the large polarization interface area leads to higher degree of polarization of the material, greatly enhancing the electrical displacement D, which, in turn, increases the energy density of the nanocomposite. The maximum electrical displacement of nanocomposites was 7.68 μC cm−2. At breakdown strength of 420 kV mm−1, the maximum energy density of nanocomposites was 11.5 J cm−3 and the efficiency was 64%. The energy density of BT@SiO2/PVDF nanocomposite film has increased significantly. All the samples obtained by weibull distribution calculation have β of over 30, and the cumulative failure rate of thin film capacitors obtained by this design strategy are low. This shows that the film capacitors have good stability and few defects.148

Increasing the polarization area shows an advantage in increasing the energy density of dielectric nanocomposites. In other words, increasing the polarization area is another effective mechanism to increase the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites. This provides a new technical approach to the design of high energy density composites.
4.3. Improving electric field distribution

4.3.1. Uniformizing electric field. 
There is a large electrical mismatch between BT and PVDF (due to large dielectric mismatch and conductivity mismatch). As the volume of BT increases, a large number of voids and pores are introduced, and BT may agglomerate, which will lead to an excessively high local electric field concentration in BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites, an uneven electric field distribution, a considerably reduced breakdown strength, and a reduced energy density of the material. Therefore, the attempt to make the local electric field of the material more uniform is one of the strategies for increasing the energy density of the material.
BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites were prepared using ultrafine BT nanoparticles with a diameter of 6.9 nm as fillers. Compared with coarse particle fillers, the nanocomposite film with a loading of 80% could still maintain a breakdown strength of 133 kV mm−1, indicating that the breakdown strength caused by the nanoscale pores and defects in the ultrafine BT nanoparticle-filled composite film is smaller than that of the composite film filled with normal materials (∼100 nm). At 30% loading (volume fraction), the breakdown strength of the BT/P(VDF-HFP) nanocomposite film reached a maximum of 380 kV mm−1 and the maximum Ue value reached 9.7 J cm−3. When the breakdown strength was lower than 225 kV mm−1, the material discharge energy efficiency was very high (≥75%, the volume fraction of loaded BT being 10–30%). Using a simple 2D model, the particles with two different particle sizes were used as the filler, and the polymer with a dielectric constant of 11 was used as the matrix to simulate the local electric field distribution of the composite when the applied electric field was 200 kV mm−1. As shown in Fig. 14a, the size of the nanoparticles directly affects the electric field distribution of the material, red indicating a high electric field concentration in the region and blue a weak electric field concentration in the region. The local electric field concentration generated from the nanocomposite structure using coarser particulate fillers is higher than that of the nanocomposite structure using smaller particulate fillers. A high local electric field concentration causes the breakdown of the polymer matrix in the electric field far below the inherent breakdown strength, which reduces the overall energy storage capacity of the nanocomposite. The ultrafine nanoparticles effectively disperse the breakdown strength and form a high electric field uniformity. Therefore, the overall breakdown strength and energy density of the nanocomposite film are relatively high.149

Selecting a material with a moderate dielectric constant to establish a buffer layer between BT and PVDF can achieve a stepwise change in the dielectric constant of the material. It can also alleviate the electrical mismatch, reduce the non-uniform electric field in the polymer matrix, make the electric field in the material more uniform, and maintain the breakdown strength at a high level, thereby increasing the energy density of the BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite film. The finite element method was used to simulate the electric field distribution in BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 14b, the local electric field concentration at both ends of BT NPs was too high along the direction of the electric field, the electric field distribution in the polymer matrix was uneven, and the electric field in the polymer matrix of BT NPs coated with TO nanosheets was relatively uniform. At breakdown strength of 420 kV mm−1, the energy density of a 2.5 vol% BT NPs/PVDF nanocomposite film was approximately 10.0 J cm−3. At breakdown strength of 490 kV mm−1, the energy density of a 2.5 vol% BT@TO nanosheet NPs/PVDF nanocomposite film was 17.6 J cm−3,150 which is higher than that of the pure polymer PVDF matrix (11.5 J cm−3) and 1366% times as much as that of the commercial BOPP (1.2 J cm−3).151 In addition, common materials that can be used as buffer layers are listed in Table 4. These materials have a moderate dielectric constant, act as a buffer between the BT filler and PVDF matrix, and make the electric field in the composite more uniform, thus increasing the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite.

The uniformity of the electric field affects the breakdown strength of the material, and is one of the main factors leading to the difference in energy density of the film. Therefore, selecting nanoparticles with a small particle size and constructing a buffer layer can effectively improve the energy density of the BT/PVDF film. Thus, achieving electric field uniformity in the polymer matrix is an effective mechanism to improve the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite films.


4.3.2. Control local weak electric field. 
The distribution of the electric field in a material plays a crucial role in its properties. In addition to the uniform electric field, controlling the local weak electric field is another way to improve the electric field distribution. The electric field redistribution between the layers of the multilayer nanocomposite greatly affects the various properties of the material. In the designed BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite film with a sandwich structure, a high content of BT NPs is added into the upper and lower layers of the “soft layer” to increase the dielectric constant; only a small amount of BT NPs is added to the middle “hard layer” to improve breakdown strength. The weak electric field region around the interface of hard layer and soft layer can prevent the growth of electric tree, and this uniform interface can effectively interrupt the development of conductive path. As shown in Fig. 15a–c, the middle layer is called the hard layer because a small amount of BT NPs in the hard layer can generate electron traps in the PVDF matrix, which can effectively restrict electrons from passing through the interface between nanoparticles and the polymer matrix. When the amount of added BT NPs was 1%, the breakdown strength was the highest and could reach 370 MV m−1. The contents of the fillers in the upper and lower layers were gradually increased from 10% to 50% to increase the dielectric constant. The high dielectric constant nanoparticles in the soft layer can induce a large electric displacement and reduce remanent polarization under the external electric field, but the breakdown strength of the soft layer will decrease. In this case, the high breakdown strength of the hard layer is used to increase the breakdown strength of the multilayer film. In addition, the formation of local weak field around the interface between the soft layer and the hard layer can prevent the electric tree from growing and the breakdown of the whole material, which is conducive to the improvement of the breakdown strength of the material. Under this unique multi-layer structure, when the content of BT NPs in the soft layer was as high as 20%, the breakdown strength could still be increased to 470 MV m−1, and finally the energy density reached 18.8 J cm−3.160 BT NPs were further modified with polydopamine (PDA) to produce PDA-BT, pure PVDF was used as the hard layer (middle layer) to improve the breakdown strength, and PDA-BT/PVDF composites were used as the soft layer (upper and lower layers) to enhance the dielectric properties to prepare the sandwich structured composite film, as shown in Fig. 15d and e. By optimizing the BT content, most of the applied electric field in the material will be concentrated on the middle layer, while the weak electric field area will be formed in the outer layer. This is beneficial to hinder the growth of electrical trees during the breakdown process, improve the breakdown strength of materials, and reduce the electrical conductivity of outer layer. It was found in this study that when the filler content in the upper and lower layers was 3 vol%, the breakdown strength of the material was 410 MV m−1, the energy density reached 16.2 J cm−3, and the charge and discharge efficiency reached up to 70%.161

4.4. Suppressing carrier migration
In BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites, when BT is in contact or close, the charge is easily transferred from one BT NP to another to form a local conductive path, resulting in a large material leakage current, as shown in the schematic in Fig. 16a1. If the BT loading continues to increase, the situation will become more serious. A conductive network throughout the material is formed, the dielectric loss increases rapidly, and the material is broken down. The material with excellent insulating properties is chosen as the outer shell to build the core–shell structure. Since the BT NPs are encapsulated in the shell with excellent insulating properties, the carrier movement at the interface is limited, the space charge polarization and leakage current are reduced, and the conductive path is effectively suppressed. As a result, the breakdown strength is relatively high, the remanent polarization is relatively low, the hysteresis loop is narrow and long, and the energy density is increased. Silica is a commonly used non-metal oxide material with good insulating properties and shows a strong interfacial compatibility with various surfaces such as polymers and metal oxides.162,163 It is widely used as a coating material for dielectric composites to enhance the properties of materials.

BT NPs were coated with SiO2, which has excellent insulating properties to form BT@SiO2 nanoparticles with core–shell structure, and the resulting products were then introduced into PVDF to form BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 16a2, this core–shell structure confines the charge to the SiO2 layer, which hinders the movement of the accumulated charge, thereby preventing the formation of the conductive path, substantially reducing the space charge polarization and leakage current, and reducing the dielectric loss. The effect of SiO2 layer on the dielectric breakdown process of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites was studied by the phase field method. The BT in Fig. 16a3 was coated with a SiO2 layer. To more clearly observe the breakdown of BT@SiO2, part of Fig. 16a3 is enlarged to Fig. 16a5, and the BT in Fig. 16a4 was not coated with SiO2 layer. It is difficult to break down SiO2, which has excellent insulating properties, and the Eb of the BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite is effectively enhanced. At breakdown strength of 420 kV mm−1, the maximum energy density of the nanocomposite was 11.5 J cm−3.148 The SiO2 layer with excellent insulating properties effectively suppresses the formation of conductive paths and improves the breakdown strength of composite materials, which is one of the important reasons for the increase in the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites.
The electric field and electric flux density distributions of BT–PDA NPs/PVDF and BT@Al2O3–PDA NFs/PVDF nanocomposites were simulated. As shown in Fig. 16b, the local electric fields of some adjacent nanoparticles are connected to form a channel (yellow region) along the direction of the electric field. This local electric field channel is likely to be the starting site for breakdown. In the BT-PDA NPs/PVDF composite, the yellow area is relatively large, indicating that the material has many sites that can be broken down, and the breakdown strength is small. Red indicates the maximum electric field concentration, the region that is the part that is most easily penetrated in the material, and reducing the area that is easily broken down is critical to the improvement of breakdown strength of the material. In BT@Al2O3–PDA NFs/PVDF composites, the yellow area is small, the electric field is evenly distributed, and the breakdown potential is small. The possible reason is that Al2O3 acts as an insulating layer, effectively limiting the carrier migration on the interface between the filler and the matrix. Maintaining a high breakdown strength guarantees increasing the energy density of BT/PVDF nanocomposites.164
As shown in Fig. 16c, the surface of the BT ceramic filler is modified with tetrafluorophthalic acid. One of the functions of tetrafluorophthalic acid is to act as a passivation layer. By reducing the concentration of the ionizable hydroxyl group and the ion migration on the surface of BT NPs, the number of carriers that can be generated is reduced and the migration of carriers is limited, thereby reducing ion or DC conduction and increasing the breakdown strength. After modification with tetrafluorophthalic acid, the energy density of BT NPs nanocomposites with a volume fraction of 10% reached 5.1 J cm−3, which was approximately 42% higher than that of untreated BT NPs nanocomposites. The passivation layer of tetrafluorophthalic acid effectively increases the breakdown strength of the material, and the energy density of the BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite is greatly improved.165
As shown in Fig. 16d, the surface modification of BT NPs is carried out with the novel small molecules 2,3,4,5-tetrafluorobenzoic acid and phthalic acid, and a passivation layer can be also formed to reduce carrier concentration and migration, effectively reduce energy loss, and improve the breakdown strength of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite material. This provides support for the improvement of energy density.166
The construction of metal–BT hybrid particles to produce a Coulomb blockade effect is an effective method to limit carrier migration. When BT NPs are modified by PDA, the formation of hydrogen bonds greatly improves the compatibility and dispersibility of BT NPs with the matrix poly(vinylideneflyoride-co-hexafluroro propylene) [P(VDF-HFP)], thereby enhancing the Eb of P(VDF-HFP)/BT-PDA nanocomposites. A uniformly dispersed nano-Ag is deposited on the surface of the BT-PDA to construct a strawberry structured BT–PDA–Ag hybrid particle, as shown in Fig. 16e. Nano-Ag exhibits a Coulomb blockade effect in nanocomposites, further inhibits electron migration, and inhibits accumulation of interfacial space charge, thereby reducing interfacial polarization and conductivity, further reducing the interfacial polarization and conductivity of nanocomposites, and greatly improving the Eb of BT-PDA-Ag/P(VDF-HFP) nanocomposites. As the nano-Ag content increases, the distance between nano-Ag decreases, thus destroying the Coulomb blockade effect of BT–PDA–Ag in P(VDF-HFP)-based nanocomposites. Owing to the Coulomb blockade effect, the migration and accumulation of space charge is considerably suppressed in the material, resulting in a lower dielectric constant, lower dielectric loss, lower AC conductivity, higher breakdown strength, and reduced remanent polarization of BT–PDA–Ag/P(VDF-HFP) as compared to those of BT/P(VDF-HFP) nanocomposites.167 The strawberry structured Pt@PDA@BT in Fig. 16f also has a similar Coulomb blockade effect. The Coulomb blockade effect can suppress carrier migration, which is important for the development of high energy density, high energy efficiency BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites.
As shown in Table 5, the methods of constructing a core–shell structure with a shell having excellent insulating properties and constructing suitable metal hybrid particles can inhibit carrier migration and effectively improve the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite film. Therefore, suppressing carrier migration is one of the mechanisms that increases the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite films.

4.5. Microcapacitors
According to the microcapacitor model, two multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) dispersed in the polymer matrix can be regarded as local microcapacitors. MWCNTs are used as two plates of the capacitor, and the presence of the microcapacitor causes the dielectric constant of the material to increase rapidly. The addition of BT NPs with high dielectric constant achieves the increase in the relative dielectric constant of the matrix region between MWCNTs, or the adjustment of the content and dispersion of MWCNTs in the composite allows the distance between MWCNTs to be appropriate. Both methods can further increase the dielectric constant of the nanocomposite, which is favorable for the improvement of the energy density of the material. Both MWCNTs and silane coupling agent (γ-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, MPS)-modified BT NPs are added to the PVDF matrix to obtain BT/MWCNT/PVDF three phase nanocomposites. The dielectric constants of nanocomposites were simulated, and the simulation results are in good agreement with experimental values. MWCNT was separated by BT and formed the microcapacitor with PVDF (see Fig. 17). The dielectric constant of BT/MWCNT/PVDF nanocomposite material increased significantly. The dielectric constant (71.6) of BT/MWCNT/PVDF nanocomposites with 3 vol% MWCNTs was significantly higher than that of BT/PVDF nanocomposites, and the dielectric loss was maintained at a low value (0.04) at 1 kHz. At breakdown strength of 272.43 MV m−1 the energy density of BT (37.1 vol%)/MWCNT (1 vol%)/P(VDF-HFP) was 14.5 J cm−3, and at breakdown strength of 251 MV m−1 the energy density of BT (37.1 vol%)/MWCNT (3 vol%)/P(VDF-HFP) was 19.8 J cm−3, which was 160% higher than that of pure P(VDF-HFP). Although the breakdown strength of the material decreased slightly after adding a small amount of MWCNTs, the BT/MWCNT/PVDF nanocomposite had a relatively high energy density because the dielectric constant is dramatically increased to compensate for the decrease in breakdown strength. In addition, nanocomposites have good flexibility, making them potentially useful in many flexible electronic devices and electrostatic energy storage devices.173

(e) Schematic illustration of microcapacitors of graphene segregated by BT particles. Reproduced with permission.174 Copyright 2015, Elsevier Ltd. 
Using the principle of electrostatic self-assembly, the BT particles are encapsulated with RGO sheets, and BT–RGO is added to the PVDF matrix. The overall dielectric properties of the BT–RGO/PVDF composites are good when the filler volume does not exceed the percolation threshold. The distribution state of RGO sheets is a key factor determining the excellent properties of materials. As shown in Fig. 17e, BT and RGO are separated from each other by precisely controlling the proportion of BT and RGO, so that they are evenly dispersed within the nanocomposite. RGO sheets separated by BT particles easily form microcapacitors, which greatly increases the dielectric constant. At the same time, since the gap distance between these microcapacitors is insufficient to generate tunneling conductivity, the effective reduction of leakage current maintains the dielectric loss at an ultralow level, providing support for increasing the energy density of the material.174 Therefore, controlling the filler content and dispersion and introducing a microcapacitor model is a mechanism to increase the energy density of BT/PVDF nanocomposites.
4.6. Other improved mechanisms
In addition to the several mechanisms mentioned above for increasing the energy density of BT/PVDF, other interesting mechanisms are worthy of note. The BT@TO NFs/PVDF nanocomposites prepared by the Cewen Nan Group achieved an ultrahigh energy density of 20 J cm−3 at breakdown strength of 646 kV mm−1. Importantly, this study achieved an ultrahigh energy density at a low loading (3 vol% BT@TO NFs) and the nanocomposite film maintained good flexibility. The main key to achieving ultrahigh energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites is the simultaneous enhancement of Eb and D. The enhancement of Eb is mainly attributed to the large aspect ratio and partial orientation of nanofibers, and the enhancement of D is mainly attributed to the construction of a hierarchical interface. The atomic structure of the film was characterized, as shown in Fig. 18a. At the interface between BT and TO, the mutual occupation of Ba2+ and Ti4+ exists, changing the local induced potential. Therefore, the ion displacement increases, thereby promoting an increase in D. In addition, an increase in out of plane polarization and an increase in BT tetragonality promote an increase in D.175 The group also prepared BT@TO NFs/P(VDF-HFP) nanocomposites with a hierarchical interface, as shown in Fig. 18a5, and the electric displacement of BT@TO NFs/P(VDF-HFP) nanocomposites was always higher than those of TO NFs/P(VDF-HFP) and BT NPs/P(VDF-HFP). At a low loading of 3 vol% BT@TO NFs, the Eb of BT@TO NFs/P(VDF-HFP) nanocomposites reached 797.7 kV mm−1, D was increased to 10.5 μC cm−2, and its energy density actually reached 31.2 J cm−3.176 At the interface between BT and TO (see Fig. 18a6), the mutual occupation of Ba2+ and Ti4+ is one of the main reasons for the increase in energy density. The energy density of this nanocomposite is extremely high among the research on BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage materials.

Three types of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites with different structures were designed, as shown in Fig. 18b. BT@TO NFs in Fig. 18b1 were randomly distributed in PVDF, BT@TO NFs in Fig. 18b2 were limited to the intermediate layer, and in Fig. 18b3 the PVDF in the intermediate layer of the sample in Fig. 18b2 was replaced with poly(vinylidene fluoride–trifluoroethylene–chlorofluoroethylene) (PVDF–TrFE–CFE). The results show that limiting BT@TO NFs to the intermediate layer and forming a multilayer nanocomposite can effectively increase the energy density of the material. Replacing the PVDF in the intermediate layer with PVDF–TrFE–CFE can further increase the energy density of the material, achieving a high energy density of 12.5 J cm−3 and a discharge efficiency of 70% at a weak breakdown strength of 350 kV mm−1.177 Adjusting the topological structure of the nanocomposite can excite the potential of the material energy density under weak electric fields.
Compared with BT NFs and BT@TO NFs, the core-double-shell BT@TO@Al2O3 NFs filler prepared by three layer coaxial electrospinning technique was introduced into PVDF, as shown in Fig. 18c. The material has a lower dielectric loss, higher breakdown strength, and suppressed leakage current density. The reason can be attributed to the different functions of different layers in the material. The dielectric constant of TO layer is moderate, and BT, TO, Al2O3, and PVDF form multilayer hierarchical interfaces. Al2O3 acts as an insulating layer to suppress carrier migration, and amorphous Al2O3 also contributes to the reduction of structural defects. PDA promotes the uniform distribution of fillers and improves interfacial adhesion of PVDF and fillers. The synergistic effect of different functional layers is the main reason for the improvement of material properties. When the loading was 3.6 vol% in BT@TO@Al2O3 NFs, the nanocomposite film had a maximum energy density Ue of 14.84 J cm−3 at breakdown strength of 450 MV m−1, its power density was 4.7 MW cm−3, and the ultrafast discharge speed was 0.37 μs.178
As shown in Fig. 18d1, 2D BNNSs (hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets) and 0D BT NPs were added to the matrix poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF–CTFE)] to prepare dual-filler nanocomposites. The effect of BT NPs is to improve the overall dielectric constant of the nanocomposites, and the role of BNNs is to increase the overall breakdown strength and resistivity of the nanocomposites. In addition, 2D boron nitride nanosheets (BNNs) divide P(VDF–CTFE) into small lattices, improving the dispersion of BT NPs (see Fig. 18d2). P(VDF–CTFE)/BNNSs/BT nanocomposites loaded with 12 wt% BNNSs and 15 wt% BT have high energy density (21.2 J cm−3), high charge/discharge efficiency (78%), and power density (850 MW L−1) under the synergistic effect of the two fillers, showing excellent energy density. Power density is an important criterion to evaluate the performance of energy storage equipment. Nanocomposite film capacitors filled with 12 wt% BNNS and 15 wt% BT have a power density eight times that of BOPP.179
Six different microstructures of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites were prepared and phase field simulation was performed on the breakdown situation, as shown in Fig. 18e. For all nanocomposite films, the breakdown path developed along the Z direction, but showed different characteristics in the X direction and Y direction. In the three nanocomposite films filled with spherical particles, the SLS (small–large–small) type film of the multilayer topology is in contact with the electrode and the PVDF with high potential energy barrier can effectively suppress the electrode injection charge. Therefore, energy loss is reduced, and discharge efficiency are increased. The SLS type film has a wider breakdown path, the electric tree becomes distorted, the breakdown strength increases, and the energy density increases. In the three kinds of nanocomposite films filled with fiber, the films with orthogonal distribution of fiber and those with parallel distribution of fiber become wider along the breakdown path in the X direction, which may be caused by the impedance of fiber to the breakdown path propagation in the X direction. Interestingly, the film with orthogonal fiber distribution also widens along the breakdown path in the same direction, so its breakdown strength is the largest among the six nanocomposite films. In addition, the fiber orthogonal distribution has high young's modulus and small leakage current density. Orthogonal nanofiber fillers have comprehensive advantages in effectively improving the Young's modulus, suppressing leakage current density, and hindering the development of breakdown paths. Thus, in six different microstructures of nanocomposites, nanocomposites filled with orthogonal nanofiber fillers exhibit the highest breakdown strength and energy density. In order to study the charge–discharge performance and stability of the thin-film capacitor, an electrode with an area from 1 cm2 to 100 cm2 was made for the nanocomposite film, and the charge–discharge cycle was tested. With the largest copper electrode area of 100 cm2, the energy density and efficiency of the thin film capacitor did not decrease significantly even in at least 105 charge and discharge cycles.180
In addition to conducting research based experiments, some researchers have taken a different approach, working on modeling and performing simulations. Simulation is also an interesting research method. As shown in Fig. 19a, an electrical breakdown phase field model of nanocomposites was established to simulate the breakdown of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites with different microstructures. The nanofibers (S1) distributed perpendicular to the z direction concentrate the electric field, promote the growth of the breakdown phase, and have the lowest breakdown strength (151 kV mm−1). The nanosheets (S5) distributed parallel to the z direction make the electric field uniform, suppress the growth of breakdown phase, and have the highest breakdown strength (310 kV mm−1). The shape and orientation of the filler not only determine the breakdown strength, but also affect the effective dielectric constant. As shown in Fig. 19b, when the filler volume fraction was 10%, different filler length ratios were set to reveal the effects of 400 microstructures of BT/PVDF nanocomposites on Eb, εr, and Ue. As the nanofillers changed from vertical nanofiber (S1) to parallel nanosheet (S5), Eb of the material increased and εr decreased. The composite with parallel nanosheets as the fillers showed the highest energy density.181 The phase field simulation prediction results of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites were in good agreement with existing experimental data. This theoretical simulation provides insight for experimental design and also helps in understanding the experimental data.

5. Summary and outlook
5.1. Summary
With increasing focus on the issue of electrical energy storage, high energy density flexible nanocomposite films represented by BT/PVDF are receiving increasingly more attention and become a research hotspot. Rapid developments in the fields of hybrid vehicles, electronic weapon systems, and smart-grid construction have placed higher demands on new dielectrics and developing materials with excellent comprehensive properties, such as high energy density, high power density, good stability, good processing performance, and environmental friendliness, with extreme urgency. The inorganic ceramic BT has high dielectric constant, but exhibits high brittleness, poor flexibility, high dielectric loss, and low breakdown strength, resulting in low energy density and the fact that it cannot meet the requirements of practical applications. Additionally, high sintering temperature and a complicated preparation process are not favorable for industrial production. The organic polymer PVDF has excellent mechanical properties, is easily processed into a film to achieve large-scale production, reduces manufacturing costs, and has high breakdown strength and low dielectric loss. However, its dielectric constant is low, resulting in low energy density. The single-phase organic polymer PVDF and inorganic ceramic BT cannot meet the actual needs of today's society due to the limitations of their own properties. The development of new high energy density BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites is a challenge and development direction demanding future breakthroughs. Because the properties of BT and PVDF materials are considerably different, there are many problems in the preparation of composite materials, so that the energy density of composite materials cannot reach the expected level. Over the years, researchers have tried various strategies to improve the energy density of BT/PVDF flexible nanocomposite films, such as building a suitable core–shell structure, modifying the surface of BT, and adding conductive materials. These strategies are very important to improving the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite films, but it is more important to explore the mechanism underlying them. This review summarizes six possible mechanisms for improving the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite films in common strategies: (1) improving compatibility and dispersibility; (2) increasing polarization area; (3) improving electric field distribution; (4) suppressing carrier migration; (5) microcapacitors; (6) other mechanisms. The reason for the increase in energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite films is explained, and reveals the mechanisms of the energy density improvement of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite films.
5.2. Outlook
In recent years, the energy density of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite films has been greatly improved by increasing compatibility and dispersibility, increasing polarization area, improving electric field distribution, suppressing carrier migration, microcapacitors, and other mechanisms. However, such films still cannot meet the needs of modern society, and further improvement of energy density is the focus and challenge facing their development.
A new idea for designing BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites is to design the BT/PVDF-based nanocomposites with as many improvement mechanisms as possible and use the collective effect, even the synergistic effect, to further improve the energy density from the original basis.
BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage materials are an important class of energy storage materials that are receiving increasingly more attention from the public. Based on the research situation in recent years, the following future development trends are projected (see Fig. 20), as follows.
 Fig. 20  Development trend of BT/PVDF nanocomposite energy storage film. 
(1) Optimization of raw materials. Studies have shown that compared with 0D filler, 1D and 2D fillers have large aspect ratio and surface area and show an in-plane orientation distribution perpendicular to the electric field. Nanocomposite films with excellent properties can be obtained under small filler volume. While maintaining energy density, filling a small volume fraction of BT not only allows the film to maintain a good flexibility, but also reduces material consumption and saves resources. At present, 0D BT filler is still the mainstream filler and there have been an increasing number of researches on 1D BT filler. The research of 2D BT filler is rare, which is mainly because the preparation process of 2D BT is not mature as those of 0D and 1D BT, and it is difficult to obtain 2D BT. The reports on 2D BT are rare, and the studies lack reference value. However, there is reason to believe that as research progresses the number of the reports on using 2D BT as fillers will increase, and the energy density of the obtained BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite film will be effectively increased. In recent years, orientation engineering has been carried out aggressively to produce oriented BT with better properties (the orientation in the preceding section refers to the spatial distribution of BT, and the orientation here refers to the properties of BT itself), and its application to BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage films is a direction worth exploring. In addition, it is requisite to design a PVDF matrix with a larger dielectric constant and a higher breakdown strength, which is significant for BT/PVDF composite energy storage films.
(2) Multiphase doping. An increasing number of researchers have been studying BT/PVDF three phase doping systems, and breakthroughs have been made. The doping of materials with excellent properties, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and boron nitride, into the BT/PVDF system will be a major development trend of BT/PVDF composite films in the future. When the number of components in the system increase and the mechanism of action is more complex, the chance of increasing energy density is greater. The design of a multiphase system, through precise and reasonable control, enables each component to exert its own unique advantages. In combination with such a synergistic effect, the energy density of BT/PVDF-based multiphase nanocomposite film is further enhanced.
(3) 3D modulation. The distribution of the fillers in the matrix has a great impact on the properties of the composite. Different spatial distributions of the fillers result in large differences between the obtained composite films. Generally, the materials distributed perpendicular to the direction of the electric field have a larger breakdown strength than those with a distribution parallel to the electric field direction or a random distribution, and the energy density is better. Under proper control, the effect of layered filling of the filler is better than that of the uniform filling; the hybrid filling of the nanoparticles and nanofibers shows a better effect than the filling of nanoparticles or nanofibers alone, and the layered distribution is better than the random distribution.182 Through reasonable 3D modulation of BT filler distribution, the electric field distribution is improved, the advantages of raw materials are maximized, and the energy density of BT/PVDF composites is improved. Structural design of the material through 3D modulation will be the mainstream trend of the future development of BT/PVDF-based composite energy storage materials. In addition, theoretical calculations are a very good method, and the combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies can help the design of experiments and the interpretation of conclusions. The combination of theory and practice makes the conclusion more scientific and persuasive.
(4) Optimize the process. The optimize process is very important for the quality of the film, and the quality of the film produced by different film forming processes is very different. Through optimization of process parameters, the defect structure of the BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy material can be effectively reduced, and the quality of the formed film can be improved. From raw materials to film preparation, a simpler process is more favorable for large-scale production of BT/PVDF flexible nanocomposite energy storage film. Therefore, it is necessary to design a suitable, efficient, simple, and environmentally friendly preparation process, which should be continuously optimized to realize the large-scale industrial production of high quality BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage film that can meet the requirements of practical applications at an early date.
BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage film exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can be used as flexible electronic components. With the continuous development of BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite energy storage film synthesis strategy, it is expected that BT/PVDF-based nanocomposite material will show greater application prospects in a new generation of wearable and portable energy storage electronics. Therefore, this direction has important research value and practical significance.
