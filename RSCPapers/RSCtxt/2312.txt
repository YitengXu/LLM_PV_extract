    , Accepted 7th January 2019First published on 9th January 2019AbstractTo promote dye regeneration, 1,2-dimethyl-3-acetyl-imidazolium iodide (DMA-II) is synthesized and applied as a bifunctional co-adsorbent for quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. The DMA-II can be co-adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface with the dye molecules due to the presence of a carboxy group, and the coadsorption can thus reduce the dye aggregation. Moreover, the I− species existing in the co-adsorbent are close to the dye molecules, which is favorable for fast dye regeneration and hence photocurrent generation. As compared to the typically used co-adsorbent, deoxycholic acid (DCA) that does not contain iodide, the DMA-II co-adsorbent enhances the electron lifetime and electron collection yield significantly, because the iodide in the co-adsorbent can quickly reduce the dye cation formed upon electron injection to its original neutral state. As a result, the DMA-II co-adsorbent (1 mM) achieves a power conversion efficiency of 8.97% for quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, which is higher than that (7.35%) without co-adsorption and outperforms DCA co-adsorption at 1 mM (7.81%) and at 20 mM (8.24%). Importantly, the quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell with DMA-II coadsorption demonstrates good long-term stability with an efficiency drop less than 10% after one-sun soaking for 1000 h.
Introduction
As a new photovoltaic technology, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have experienced rapid development in the past two decades.1 DSSCs are composed of a dye-loaded wide band-gap semiconductor (photoanode), electrolyte and counter electrode.2 As a key component in DSSCs, the dye plays an important role in photovoltaic performance, because it functions to absorb incident light, which is then converted to electricity.3 However, some excellent dyes4–13 with good photophysical properties suffer from molecular aggregation, leading to performance degradation. To break up the dye aggregates, various co-adsorbents14–34 have been added to the dye solutions for co-adsorption, which can improve the photovoltaic performance in spite of the reduced dye loading.
The black dye, one of the best ruthenium–polypyridyl dyes for DSSCs, has a very broad UV-Vis absorption spectrum with maximum absorption at 610 nm and an absorption onset of up to 920 nm.10 However, the existence of a conjugated terpyridine ring in the black dye leads to serious dye aggregation and hence decreases the photovoltaic performance. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) has been verified to be an effective co-adsorbent for the black dye.10,35 However, a large amount of DCA (20 mM) used for coadsorption reduces the dye loading significantly.10 Meanwhile, the formed dye/DCA compact layer restricts the diffusion of iodide in the electrolyte to the dye molecules for efficient dye regeneration. Furthermore, the long-term stability of the black dye based solar cells has rarely been investigated.
Traditional co-adsorbents (e.g. DCA) just have one function of preventing dye aggregation, but cannot promote dye regeneration. Therefore, it is a challenge to develop co-adsorbents with dual functions of both preventing dye aggregation and promoting dye regeneration. To this end, we design and synthesize a carboxy-functionalized imidazolium iodide salt (1,2-dimethyl-3-acetyl-imidazolium iodide, DMA-II, Fig. 1) as a bifunctional co-adsorbent and apply it in black dye based quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, because quasi-solid-state electrolytes have the advantages of good stability and high diffusion properties of redox species combined.36–39 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of imidazolium iodide salts being used as co-adsorbents in DSSCs. 1 mM DMA-II in the black dye solution enhances the photocurrent density from 14.36 mA cm−2 to 18.29 mA cm−2 and increases the power conversion efficiency from 7.35% to 8.97% versus the 7.81% for coadsorption of 1 mM DCA and 8.24% for coadsorption of 20 mM DCA. Compared to the traditional co-adsorbent DCA, the DMA-II has advantages of higher ability to inhibit dye aggregation, more efficient dye regeneration, longer electron lifetimes, and larger electron collection yield due to the dual function of the latter.

Synthesis of DMA-II
The synthetic route of DMA-II is shown in Fig. S1.† The compound DMA-II is synthesized according to a reference.40 1,2-Dimethylimidazole and iodoacetic acid are added to 20 mL acetonitrile and then stirred for three days under a N2 atmosphere at 70 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture is added to ethyl acetate and filtered, and a white solid powder is obtained. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 7.59 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 4.84 (s, 2H), 3.80 (s, 3H), 2.51 (s, 3H). The 1H NMR spectrum is shown in Fig. S2.†13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 167.9, 145.5, 122.6, 122.2, 50.8, 35.3, 9.8. The 13C NMR spectrum is shown in Fig. S3.† ESI-HRMS (m/z): calcd for C7H11N2O2+: 155.0817. Found: 155.0815. The HRMS spectrum is shown in Fig. S4.† TG and DSC are used to determine the thermal properties of DMA-II. The TG and DSC curves shown in Fig. S5† indicate that the decomposition temperature of DMA-II is 232 °C and the melting point of DMA-II is 153 °C.
Fabrication of quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells
TiO2 films of 25 μm thickness, including a 19 μm transparent layer (composed of 25 nm TiO2 nanoparticles) and 6 μm light scattering layer (composed of 200 nm TiO2 particles), are prepared with a screen-printing method.41 The films are sintered at 500 °C for 2 h and then treated with 0.05 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. When TiO2 electrodes are cooled down to 120 °C, the electrodes are dipped in the dye solution, which contains 0.2 mM black dye and the co-adsorbent with different concentrations in ethanol for 24 h. The Pt-coated conductive substrate (fluorine doped tin oxide, FTO) as the counter electrode and the dye-loaded film as the working electrode are separated with a hot-melt Surlyn film (30 μm) and sealed together by pressing them under heat. The quasi-solid-state electrolyte contains 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M TBP and 5 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in 3-methoxypropionitrile. The electrolyte is introduced into the interspace between the photoanode and cathode from the two holes predrilled on the back of the counter electrode. Finally, the two holes are sealed with a Surlyn film and covered with a thin glass slide under hot pressing.
Instrumentation and measurements

1H NMR and 13C NMR are measured on a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Mass spectra are obtained on a microTOF II-10257 (Bruker Compass Data Analysis 4.0). UV-Vis absorption spectra are obtained on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements are performed on a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1 FT-IR spectrometer. The photovoltaic performance of the DSSC is tested by recording the current density–voltage (J–V) curves with a Keithley 2420 source meter under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 G solar light coming from a solar simulator (Newport-94043A equipped with a Xe lamp and an AM 1.5 G filter). The light intensity is calibrated using a standard Si solar cell (Newport 91150). Action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells are recorded using an SM-250 Hyper Mono-Light system (Bunkoh-Keiki, Japan). The intensity of monochromatic light is measured with a Si detector (S1337-1010BQ). A black mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 is used during measurements to avoid stray light completely. The electron lifetimes are measured with controlled intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. IMVS/IMPS are carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner XPOT) including a white light-emitting diode (LED, 532 nm) and a corresponding control system.
Results and discussion
In order to get the optimal concentration of DMA-II, 0.2 mM black dye mixed with different concentrations of DMA-II (0.5, 1, 2 and 5 mM) is prepared. A TiO2 film with a thickness of 5 μm is immersed into the above dye solution with different concentrations of DMA-II for 24 h. The current–voltage curves of the DSSCs with a film thickness of 5 μm are shown in Fig. S6(a),† and the corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table S1.† With increasing the concentration of DMA-II in the black dye solution, the current is improved from 7.18 mA cm−2 to 7.93 mA cm−2 at 0.5 mM DMA-II and further to 9.26 mA cm−2 at 1 mM. However, the current begins to drop gradually with further increasing the concentration of DMA-II to 2 mM and 5 mM.
Fig. S6(b)† displays the IPCE curves for the DSSCs with different concentrations of DMA-II included in the dye bath. The maximum IPCE gradually increases with increasing the DMA-II concentration up to 1 mM and then decreases gradually with further increasing the DMA-II concentration more than 1 mM. The changing tendency of IPCE is in good agreement with that of Jsc. Because monomers can inject electrons into TiO2 more efficiently than aggregates,42 the mixed black dye/DMA-II layer obtained from exposure of TiO2 to dye solution containing 0.5 mM DMA-II may contain more monomers, resulting in improved IPCE as compared to that without coadsorption. The IPCE reaches the highest at 1 mM DMA-II, meaning that the dye aggregates are broken into monomers completely at this concentration. This suggests that there is still some degree of aggregation with 0.5 mM DMA-II coadsorption. At concentrations greater than 1 mM, the amount of black dye adsorbed on the film becomes reduced, offsetting the positive effect of reduced aggregates.43 Therefore, the IPCE decreases with concentrations of DMA-II higher than 1 mM.
According to the data listed in Table S1,† the optimal concentration of co-adsorbent DMA-II is determined to be 1 mM, and we apply this concentration to thicker TiO2 films (25 μm). The reason why 5 μm-thick TiO2 films are used to optimize the co-adsorbent concentration is that the thickness of thinner films is easier to control, while the thickness of thicker films is more difficult to control. As we reported previously,17,35 the best co-adsorbent concentration is independent of the photoanode film thickness, because the same TiO2 nanoparticles with the same specific surface area and pore size distribution are used for fabrication of TiO2 films. We first optimize the coadsorbent concentration using the 5 μm-thick TiO2 films, and then improve the photovoltaic performance using thicker films.
From a previous report,10 the optimal condition for DCA is 0.2 mM black dye mixed with 20 mM DCA. Therefore, 0.2 mM black dye solutions mixed with 1 mM and 20 mM DCA are also prepared for comparison at the same concentration as DMA-II and the best DCA concentration.

Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of dye loaded TiO2 films with a thickness of 5 μm without and with coadsorption of DMA-II. The absorbance at 610 nm is 0.459, 0.337, 0.232 and 0.305 for the black dye loaded film without coadsorption and with 1 mM and 20 mM DCA coadsorption and with 1 mM DMA-II coadsorption, respectively. The absorbance is decreased gradually with increasing the DCA content in the dye solution. The amount of dye adsorption is decreased by 27% and 49%, when 1 mM and 20 mM DCA is included in the dye solution, respectively. With the addition of 1 mM DMA-II to the dye bath, the dye adsorption is reduced by 34%. At the same concentration, DMA-II is able to decrease the dye adsorption to a larger degree than DCA, suggesting that the former is more effective to prevent dye aggregation than the latter. The competitive adsorption of dye and co-adsorbent reduces the black dye adsorption, decreases the amount of weakly bonded black dye, and prevents the aggregation of black dye molecules on the TiO2 surface.44 The inhibition of dye aggregation is responsible for the photocurrent enhancement.
 Fig. 2  UV-Vis absorption spectra of TiO2 films (5 μm) exposed to 0.2 mM black dye solutions containing the co-adsorbent. 
It is estimated that the absorbance is 2.295, 1.685, 1.160 and 1.525, respectively, for the black dye loaded film of 25 μm thickness without coadsorption, with 1 mM DCA coadsorption, with 20 mM DCA coadsorption, and with 1 mM DMA-II coadsorption. The light harvesting efficiency (LHE) at the maximum absorption wavelength can be estimated using the following equation LHE = 1 − 10−A(1)where A is the absorbance of the black dye with co-adsorbents on a 25 μm TiO2 film at the maximum wavelength. The LHE of the black dye loaded TiO2 film is calculated to be 99.5%, 97.9%, 93.1% and 97.0% for no coadsorption and coadsorption with 1 mM DCA, 20 mM DCA, and 1 mM DMA-II, respectively. Owing to the coadsorption, the LHE is reduced to some degree depending on the co-adsorbent and its concentration, but the decrease is not big.

Fig. 3(a) shows the current–voltage curves of the DSSCs, and the corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. From Table 1, the black dye based DSSC achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.35% with short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 14.36 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 736 mV, and fill factor (FF) of 0.695. Upon addition of 1 mM DCA to the dye solution, the Voc is reduced to 715 mV while the Jsc is increased to 16.21 mA cm−2 and the PCE is enhanced to 7.81%. On increasing the DCA concentration to 20 mM, the Voc further drops to 697 mV while the Jsc is further increased to 17.47 mA cm−2 and the PCE is further improved to 8.24%. Compared to the black dye without coadsorption, the photocurrent is improved upon DCA coadsorption and increases with increasing the DCA concentration. These results are consistent with the previous report.10 Similarly, coadsorption with 1 mM DMA-II also leads to enhancement of Jsc. The increase of Jsc upon coadsorption with DMA-II or DCA is attributed to the inhibition of dye aggregation. In addition, the positive movement of the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 caused by the proton dissociation from DCA or DMA-II followed by its adsorption onto the titania surface also accounts for the improvement of photocurrent.45 Nevertheless, the positive shift of the CB edge leads to a decrease in Voc. For the coadsorption with 1 mM DMA-II, the Jsc is 18.29 mA cm−2 and the PCE is 8.97%, which are respectively much higher than those without coadsorption and with DCA coadsorption as well.

Fig. 3(b) shows the IPCE spectra of the above DSSCs. The maximum IPCE of the black dye based DSSC at 610 nm is only 59% due to the dye aggregation. However, the IPCE is improved significantly with the addition of co-adsorbents. When 1 mM DCA is added to the dye solution, the maximum IPCE is increased to 67% and further to 71% with 20 mM DCA coadsorption. The maximum IPCE for 1 mM DMA-II coadsorption is 78%, which is higher than the maximum IPCE without coadsorption and those with DCA coadsorption. Despite the decreased absorbance (Fig. 2) or LHE, the IPCE is improved by coadsorption, suggesting that the dye aggregation is prevented by the coadsorption.
Both the J–V and IPCE results indicate that DMA-II is superior to DCA as a co-adsorbent. As the presence of I− in DMA-II is favourable for reducing the oxidized dye molecules (i.e. dye regeneration),46 photocurrent or IPCE enhancement from DCA to DMA-II coadsorption can be explained by the improved dye regeneration, which will be discussed in the following.
The IPCE can be defined as the following equation IPCE = LHE × ηcc × ηinj(2)where ηcc is the charge collection efficiency and ηinj is the quantum yield of electron injection. As LHE is slightly decreased upon coadsorption according to the previous analysis, the IPCE improvement should be attributed to the improvements of ηcc or ηinj or both according to eqn (2). Next we will analyze what factors contribute to the improvement of IPCE. In order to get insight into the effect of co-adsorbents on the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC devices, charge extraction, IMVS, and IMPS are determined.47
Conduction band edge movement
The position of the CB edge determines the electron injection and the Voc. The Voc of the device depends on the difference between the quasi-Fermi level (EF) of the TiO2 and the energy level of the redox couple. The EF, which is related to the CB edge and the free electron density (nC) in the CB, can be defined using the following equation48 EF = ECB + kBTln(nC/NC)(3)where ECB is the energy level of the CB, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and NC is the density of states in the CB.

Fig. 4(a) shows the relationship between Voc and extracted charge density (Q) at open circuit under LED light (532 nm) with different intensities, according to a literature method.49,50 The curves of Voc against lnQ are linear, and the slopes (mc) are identical (125 mV) for all four cases. Compared to the no coadsorption one, the CB edge for the case of coadsorption moves to the positive direction. Because adsorption of DCA or DMA-II leaves protons on the TiO2 surface and hence charges the surface positively, and the CB edge is thus positively shifted by the coadsorption. The positive shift of the CB edge is beneficial for electron injection and hence contributes to the photocurrent enhancement. It is thus concluded that coadsorption of DMA-II is able to break up dye aggregation and results in a downward shift of the CB edge; both changes account for the improvement of photocurrent.
 Fig. 4  (a) Dependence of Voc on charge density at open circuit. (b) Charge recombination rate as a function of photoinduced charge density. 
However, the positive shift of the CB edge also leads to Voc loss.45 The ΔECB of 1 mM DCA, 20 mM DCA, and 1 mM DMA-II is −65, −86, and −102 mV, respectively, compared to the black dye. The CB edge movement of DMA-II is the largest among them (Table S2†). The positive shift value of the CB edge theoretically corresponds to the decreased value of Voc. In addition to the ΔECB, the Q also contributes to the Voc.51 The Q of the black dye, 1 mM DCA, 20 mM DCA and 1 mM DMA-II is 125.08, 184.24, 170.84 and 235.32 μC cm−2, respectively, under 100 W m−2 LED light (Table S2†). According to Fig. 3(a), a larger Q gives larger Voc for each case. The Q increases upon coadsorption following the order no coadsorption < 1 mM DCA < 20 mM DCA < 1 mM DMA-II. Relative to the case of no coadsorption, voltage gain caused by the coadsorption is anticipated. The calculated increases in Voc, according to the relationship revealed by Fig. 3(a), are 48, 39, and 79 mV for 1 mM DCA, 20 mM DCA, and 1 mM DMA-II, respectively (Table S2†). The voltage gain caused by the increased Q partly compensates for the voltage loss caused by the positive shift of the CB edge. However, decreases of Voc are observed upon coadsorption. The collective effect of the positive shift of the CB edge and increased Q gives calculated Voc decreases of 17, 47, and 23 mV for 1 mM DCA, 20 mM DCA, and 1 mM DMA-II, respectively. The calculated decreases of Voc are in good agreement with the measured values (Table S2†). For example, 1 mM DMA-II coadsorption results in a CB positive shift of 102 mV and Voc gain of 79 mV due to the increased charge density, and the calculated Voc decrease of 23 mV is similar to the measured Voc decrease of 18 mV.

Fig. 4(b) shows the relationship between recombination current density (Jr) at open circuit and Q. Jr has the same value as Jsc at the same light intensity.52 Since the charge recombination rate is proportional to the recombination current density, Jr can be used to indicate the charge recombination rate. As compared to the case without coadsorption, 1 mM DMA-II coadsorption slows down the charge recombination rate by 7-fold whereas 1 or 20 mM DCA coadsorption retards the charge recombination rate by 3-fold at a fixed Q. These results suggest that DMA-II is more effective to retard charge recombination than DCA as a co-adsorbent. Owing to the coadsorption, the I− in DMA-II remains close to the dye molecules, and therefore the resultant dye cations, upon electron injection from excited dye molecules to the CB of TiO2, can be quickly reduced back to neutral dye molecules. The charge recombination rate is thus decreased significantly due to the remarkably reduced concentration of dye cations for the coadsorption of DMA-II. It is thus concluded that the presence of I− in DMA-II is responsible for the slowest charge recombination rate among the four cases studied. The suppressed charge recombination caused by coadsorption is advantageous to increase charge density and hence favorable for improvement of Voc, which partly compensates for the voltage loss arising from the positive movement of the CB edge.
Electron lifetime and charge collection

Fig. 5(a) shows the electron lifetime (τn) against charge density for the DSSCs with and without coadsorption. The electron lifetime decreases with the charge density, following a power law relationship. At a fixed charge density, the electron lifetime of the black dye with coadsorption is longer than that of the black dye without coadsorption. The electron lifetime of 1 mM DMA-II coadsorption is 12 times longer than that of the black dye and 2.6 times longer than that of 20 mM DCA coadsorption. DMA-II has the longest electron lifetime among these co-adsorbents, which is consistent with the charge recombination rate results (Fig. 4(b)). When DMA-II adsorbs on the TiO2 surface, the increased concentration of I− near the surface of TiO2 can enhance the regeneration of oxidized dyes compared to the co-adsorbent DCA. The improved dye regeneration reduces the concentration of dye cations, and thus slows down the kinetic rate of charge recombination. Therefore, DMA-II coadsorption achieves longer electron lifetimes than 1 or 20 mM DCA coadsorption.
 Fig. 5  (a) Electron lifetime as a function of charge density. (b) Charge collection efficiency as a function of light intensity. 
The charge collection efficiency (ηcc) plays an important role in the process of photocurrent generation. The ηcc is associated with the electron transport time (τd) and τn and can be defined as the expression ηcc = 1 − τd/τn.53 The electron transport time as a function of intensity for the co-adsorbents is shown in Fig. S7.† In order to fully understand the influence of co-adsorbents on the photocurrent generation, the effect of coadsorption on the charge collection efficiency is plotted in Fig. 5(b). The ηcc of the black dye based DSSC without coadsorption is about 70%. The ηcc is enhanced upon coadsorption following the sequence no coadsorption < 1 mM DCA < 20 mM DCA < 1 mM DMA-II coadsorption. 1 mM DMA-II coadsorption obtains the highest ηcc among these DSSCs. The results suggest that all these co-adsorbents can improve the ηcc and DMA-II is better than DCA. According to the discussions on CB edge movement and charge collection efficiency, it is concluded that the improved Jsc or IPCE is attributed to the enhancements of both ηinj and ηcc despite the slightly reduced LHE.
Almost all the black dye based DSSCs studied so far employ liquid electrolytes, which limits practical applications. To obtain good long-term stability, the black dye based quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells are investigated throughout this work. Fig. 6 shows the long-term stability of the black dye based quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells with 1 mM DMA-II coadsorption under 1-sun light soaking. After 1000 h of light soaking, the decreases of all four photovoltaic performance parameters are negligible, and the PCE retains over 90% of the initial value. This suggests that the quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell containing the black dye coadsorbed with DMA-II has good long-term stability.

Conclusions
In summary, a carboxy-functionalized imidazolium iodide salt (DMA-II) is synthesized and applied as a novel co-adsorbent to quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells for the first time. Compared to the commonly used co-adsorbent (e.g. DCA) with only one function of inhibiting dye aggregation, the DMA-II can not only prevent dye aggregation but also highly enhance the regeneration of oxidized dyes. The dual functions of DMA-II thus improve the electron collection efficiency and hence the photocurrent. As a consequence, 1 mM DMA-II coadsorption achieves a PCE of 8.97%, which is higher than that of no coadsorption (7.35%), that of 1 mM DCA coadsorption (7.81%), and that of 20 mM DCA coadsorption (8.24%). Importantly, the black dye based quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell coadsorbed with DMA-II demonstrates good long-term stability. The finding of carboxy-functionalized imidazolium iodide salts as novel co-adsorbents further improves the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs and provides new ideas to deign novel co-adsorbents for high-performance dyes with serious aggregation.
