    , Accepted 29th August 2014First published on 29th August 2014AbstractA tin (Sn) nanostructure has been applied to a gas diffusion electrode for the direct electro-reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) in a zero-gap electrolytic cell. A Sn catalyst layer was evenly applied to a carbon substrate by a controlled spraying technique and the efficient catalytic conversion of gas-phase CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) demonstrated. We observed that the overall mean faradaic efficiency towards HCOOH remained above 5.0% over the entire reduction time. In addition, due to its compact configuration and surroundings at near ambient conditions the approach described is promising in both modularity and scalability. Sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, or geothermal electricity could be used as a power source to minimize the large-scale operating cost.
1. Introduction
In the 21st century our world is still searching for strategies to overcome the challenges of climate change, dependency on fossil fuels, and finite natural resources. Solar energy is trapped as heat in the atmosphere by a number of gases, typically carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The so-called greenhouse effect is now widely acknowledged to be a long-term environmental threat. Supplies of fossil fuels and natural gas are limited, and this adds impetus to the search for renewable alternative energy supplies.
Technologies that could curtail greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, have been investigated by a variety of methods.1,2 Currently, carbon capture and storage is receiving considerable attention as a technology for dealing with large quantities of CO2 emissions.1–3 Sequestration has been a major storage option for CO2 from power plants, but a number of technological limitations remain, including environmental and safety concerns regarding the risk of leakage.3
As an alternative long-term solution for CO2 mitigation considerable efforts for the conversion of CO2 gas into value-added chemicals have been made using heterogeneous catalysis.2,4 The utilisation of CO2 gas in this way is however limited by the activation energy needed for its transformation into organic chemicals, and an improved catalyst is needed in order to overcome the high activation energy barrier. Reduction processes necessitate the use of specific metal catalysts.5 Azuma et al. have summarized types of catalysts using the periodic table, showing product distribution under specific conditions, and on this basis Hori et al. have divided catalysts into four types.6,7
Effective conversion thus requires the use of catalysts and systems which are able to handle large volumes of low cost reactants. Electrocatalysts may be categorized into sp metals (Zn, Cd, Hg, In, Tl, Pb, Ti and Sn) for HCOOH and d metals (Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au) for CO2, depending on the electronic configuration determining their electrocatalytic behavior.8 Among these metals, we have investigated Sn as an electrocatalyst for the selective production of HCOOH, since it is inexpensive and relatively less toxic than many other metals. A new approach using a zero-gap cell with a gas-diffusion electrode has been introduced for the effective electrocatalytic reduction of gas-phase CO2, alleviating mass-transfer limitations caused by the low solubility of CO2 in liquid-phase systems.
The direct production of small organic molecules from CO2 is still a long way from feasibility, and large-scale production is a challenging prospect. Among the smaller organic molecules, HCOOH produced by a CO2 reduction process gives better value than other organic products such as methanol (CH3OH), ethylene (C2H4) or methane (CH4). This is a feature of the energy required, and the significant use of HCOOH in a variety of areas, including fuels for fuel cells, fertilizers and pharmaceuticals, and as feedstock for a wide range of chemical products.9 The main mechanism for the electroreduction of CO2 at the cathode is given by eqn (1)–(5):10 CO2(g) → CO2(ad)(1) CO2(ad) + e− → ˙CO2(ad)−(2) ˙CO2(ad)− + H+ → ˙HCOO(ad)(3) ˙HCOO(ad) + e− → ˙HCOO(aq)−(4) ˙HCOO(aq)− + H+ → HCOOH(5)
The overall reaction of the formation of HCOOH is summarized in eqn (6): CO2(g) + 2H+ + 2e− → HCOOH(6)
The catalytic activity in the conversion of gaseous CO2 to the intended product, HCOOH, can be described both in terms of product yield and faradaic efficiency.11 Improving the efficiency of the conversion will therefore result in both scaling up the system and the stabilization of CO2 gas emission. Preti et al. reported a faradaic efficiency of ca. 83% in the production of HCOOH from CO2 under a pressure of 180 bar, and Yan et al. obtained a yield of HCOOH in excess of 87% at 300 °C.12,13
However, both of the studies quoted specified very high temperatures and pressure. Our previous study, carried out under mild conditions, showed that electrodeposition of a Sn coating did not provide sufficient loading or homogeneity over the entire electrode surface.14 As a result the product yield was low and variable. In the present study we describe a novel method for homogeneously coating a thin layer of Sn nanopowder on a gas diffusion electrode (GDE; Fig. 1) using a controlled spraying method, giving better performance than that of the previous studies in terms of activity and long-term stability.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Identification of gas-phase CO2 electroreduction
An immediate fundamental question arises as to whether the carbon converted to HCOOH originated from CO2 gas, since corrosion of the carbon electrode is known to occur under the high levels of voltage applied.15 Our initial investigation focused on verifying the conversion of gas-phase CO2 into the liquid form of HCOOH.
A number of liquid samples generated under a range of conditions were analyzed by UV-spectroscopy within the wavelength region 190–240 nm to identify the carbon source of HCOOH produced (Fig. 2). Deionized water was used as reference and the maximum absorbance peak at 207 nm from a commercial HCOOH solution was matched against each graph of samples. In the absence of the CO2 gas supplied, no peaks corresponding to HCOOH were observed. However, 1H-NMR analysis was conducted to precisely identify the carbon source.16,17
 Fig. 2  UV-spectroscopic analysis of the HCOOH produced to compare different conditions: (a) commercial HCOOH, for reference, (b) electroreduction of gaseous CO2, (c) electroreduction of the inert gas Ar, and (d) a baseline of deionized water. 
To trace the carbon source in HCOOH, 13CO2 gas was obtained and converted into liquid phase HCOOH by electrochemical reduction. Carbon isotopes of mass number 13 occur naturally at about 2%. In the formation of 13C-labeled HCOOH, the intensities of two types of HCOOH peaks in the 1H-NMR spectra were found to be reversed by comparison with those of commercial 12C-HCOOH. As shown in Fig. 3, it was observed that the 13C-labeled HCOOH peaks increased sharply, and this result allowed the identification of the carbon source of HCOOH as the CO2 gas.

2.2 Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and optimization of operating conditions
After confirming the origin of the carbon converted to HCOOH, the next step was to determine the optimal operating conditions for an electrolytic CO2 reduction system. Knowing how much Sn catalyst was activated at a given potential was important for optimizing the system. To examine the Sn catalyst activity for the electroreduction of CO2, LSV curves were obtained in a zero-gap cell applying Ar or CO2. As shown in Fig. 4, the voltammogram under CO2 supply gave a higher negative figure than using the same catalyst under Ar, at a cathodic sweep rate of 20 mV s−1.
 Fig. 4  Linear sweep voltammograms using Sn in (a) Ar and (b) the CO2 gas supplied. The reduction peak at −0.7 V was attributed to the electroreduction of CO2, and another peak appearing at a less negative potential was associated with hydrogen adsorption. The scan rate was 20 mV s−1. 
We believe that the higher negative current value observed at a cathode voltage around −0.7 V (vs. RHE) confirmed the reduction of CO2. Based on this observation, the optimal voltage was investigated experimentally, while maintaining the same temperature and gas flow rate (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Faradaic efficiency at various voltages: (a) −0.5 V, (b) −0.7 V, (c) −0.9 V, (d) −1.2 V, (e) −1.4 V, (f) −1.6 V, (g) −1.8 V and (h) −2.0 V. 
To suppress the production of hydrogen, the operating temperature was set at room temperature and the gas flow rate at both anode and cathode were kept at the minimum level required to prevent mass transfer limitations (ESI Fig. S1†).18,19
2.3 Long-term test for gas-phase CO2 electroreduction
Using the optimal conditions determined by the above experimental results, the electrochemical reduction of gas-phase CO2 was carried out at −0.7 V over 10 h. The liquid phase product was collected and analyzed every 20 min. The variation in current and faradaic efficiency with electrolysis time was evaluated and the outcome is summarized in Fig. 6. The Sn electrode exhibited a stable current density of 5 mA cm−2. The initial faradaic efficiency towards HCOOH, on average 12.5%, decreased to about 7% after 3 h running and remained at this level a further few hours until the completion of the experiment. The accumulated amount of HCOOH was calculated and the production rate was found to decline slightly during the course of the electrolytic process (inset of Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Electrocatalytic activity for the electroreduction of CO2 on Sn was evaluated by analyzing the production rate of HCOOH and the current density vs. time at a cathode potential of −0.7 V. The inset image shows the stable accumulated quantity of HCOOH generated from CO2 electrolysis over 10 h. 
From the product analysis, the remainder of the faradaic current for CO2 reduction was allotted to the formation of hydrogen. Decreasing CO2 reduction performance can be attributed to a number of factors, including the loss of the sprayed catalyst particles on the GDE, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the deactivation of the catalyst after exposure to high concentrations of CO2 gas.13–15,20
2.4 Morphological investigation of the electrode surface
The compactness and uniformity of the surface morphology of the electrode were characterized before and after the electrolytic process using field scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Uniformly nanostructured Sn particles were observed on the GDE initially, but the quantity decreased after the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (Fig. 7). As illustrated in Fig. 7(b), particle loss had taken place, indicating that the decomposition of Sn particles could lead to a degradation of long-term performance.
 Fig. 7  SEM images showing the top view and cross-section of the Sn nanostructure cathode with GDE, (a) as prepared, and (b) after electroreduction of CO2. Particle loss occurred during CO2 electrolysis. 
ESI Table S1† gives the weight of three samples of Sn electrode used for CO2 electroreduction after 1 h, 2 h and 5 h, respectively. From these measurements, it would be expected that the Sn catalyst layer would catalyse the CO2 electroreduction for over 10 h, since the total weight of Sn on the carbon substrate was 31.5 mg. After CO2 electrolysis for 1 h, the decrease in the weight of Sn nanoparticles was almost 2.3 mg, similar to the corresponding trend in Faradaic efficiency towards HCOOH. Hence, considering the result of the long-term electrolysis seen in Fig. 6, the relatively weak adhesion between Sn nanoparticles and the carbon electrode surface appeard to have been a factor.
In addition, changes in crystallinity during the electrocataysis were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 8, the electroreduction of CO2 did not give rise to a significant change in crystallinity.
 Fig. 8  XRD patterns of the Sn electrode (a) originally, and (b) and (c), after electrochemical CO2 reduction in a zero-gap cell for 3 h and 10 h, respectively. 
The intensities of the Sn peaks decreased due to the loss of catalyst particles from the electrode surface. The increment in the carbon substrate peak also confirmed that the catalyst had peeled off the support material. Consequently, the damage to catalyst configuration on the GDE was one of the main causes of the breakdown in CO2 electrolysis.13,14,20
Moreover, the CO2 reduction interface became significantly acidified, due to protons from the anode area.21 It was demonstrated that H2 was the dominant species by product analysis of the cathode area. This undesirable reaction pathway could be responsible for the decrease in HCOOH output. In other words, the rate-determining step (RDS) was not in fact the transportation of protons, and the mass transfer limitation problem of CO2 was compensated by the direct supply of CO2 gas to the catalyst on to the GDE in a zero gap cell system.
2.5 Investigation of RDS by Tafel slope
With this in mind, a Tafel plot was extracted by a similar CO2 reduction process to investigate the mechanistic pathway regarding the RDS. Liquid products were sampled every 20 min and partial current densities for HCOOH production were calculated from the faradaic efficiency. Electrochemical performances for the Tafel plot were measured within the window overvoltage, ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 V. The Tafel law for a multi-step reaction is given by eqn (7) (7)where i0 is the exchange current density expressed in mA cm−2, i is the electrode current density, also in mA cm−2, α is the transfer coefficient (dimensionless), η is the overvoltage (V), and f is the RT/F (V−1). The graph of η vs. logi is known as a Tafel plot, and is illustrated in Fig. 9. If the RDS is the formation of a CO2 radical anion (eqn (2)), the Tafel slope is theoretically 118 mV dec−1. We obtained a Tafel slope of 148 mV dec−1, based on Sn electrocatalyst.

Tafel slopes of CO2 reduction for determination of the reaction mechanism have in the past been employed by a number of research groups.22–27 It is reported that a Tafel slope similar to our results is consistent as the initial RDS with a CO2 reduction mechanism involving the transfer of one electron to CO2 adsorbed on the electrode surface.
Further investigations into improving the efficiency of the conversion of CO2 to HCOOH are at present in hand, in conjunction with optimizing the electrolyzer conditions, including reactor design, stacking technology and modification of the electrode configuration relative to the activation of the RDS.
3. Experimental
3.1 Production of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA)
The design of the MEA was simplified and made more effective, by loading Sn nanopowder (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%, average particle size 100 nm; 3.5 mg cm−2) as a cathode catalyst on to carbon diffusion paper with 30 wt% of Nafion solution catalyst (Sigma-Aldrich; 10%) using a spray method.13,26 This hydrophobic cathode electrode increased the humidity of the CO2 gas supply network compared to the HER, making it more suitable for the discharge of liquid products from the GDE. A Pt/C (Johnson Matthey, 40%, 0.3 mg cm−2) anode was prepared in a similar manner to the cathode. The electrodes were located on each side of a proton exchange solid polymer electrolyte membrane (Nafion 115, Dupont). The assembly, of 9 cm2 active area, was hot-pressed at 140 °C and 3 MPa pressure for 5 min.
3.2 Experimental set-up for gas-phase CO2 electroreduction
The electroreduction of CO2 was carried out in a zero gap cell operated by an electrochemical work-station (ESI Fig. S2†). A potentiostat (PGSTAT-302N, Autolab) was used to apply a cathode voltage of −0.7 V (vs. RHE). The MEA was activated with H2 (20 ml min−1) at the anode and CO2 (40 ml min−1) of 100% relative humidity at the cathode. LSV was performed at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 to test the electrocatalytic activity and a Tafel plot of CO2 reduction was extracted to obtain information regarding the reaction mechanism.
3.3 Products and electrode analysis
To determine the concentration of HCOOH produced, UV-spectroscopy (UV-1800, Shimadzu) was employed to analyze the liquid phase samples (ESI Fig. S3†). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Alliance 2690, Waters), using a Shodex RSpak KC-G and KC-811 column, was also used in evaluating the liquid phase product. Perchloric acid (HClO4; 3 mM) was used as the mobile phase at 25 °C and a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. HPLC showed that HCOOH, with a retention time of 9.19 min, was the sole liquid product generated by the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (ESI Fig. S4†). On the other hand, a gas-phase reaction product was detected by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A, Agilent Technologies, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector). A Carboxen 1006 Plot column (Superico) was used with nitrogen carrier gas at 1.5 ml min−1 (ESI Fig. S3†).
The carbon source for the formation of HCOOH was identified by 1H-NMR (Varian Inova-600 MHz, Varian) spectroscopy at the Korea Basic Science Institute, Gwangju. 13CO2 gas (99 atom% 13C, Sigma Aldrich) was used to confirm the reactive origin of carbon. The morphology and phase of the crystallites of the Sn nanopowder on the electrode were examined by FE-SEM (S-4700, Hitachi) and XRD (Miniflex II, Rigacku), respectively.
4. Conclusions
A direct zero-gap electrolytic cell has been successfully employed for the electrochemical reduction of gaseous CO2. We constructed a gas diffusion carbon electrode with Sn nanostructure for stable production of HCOOH. A Tafel plot showed that the reduction mechanism was dominated by the formation of a CO2 radical anion adsorbed on the electrode surface. A direct supply of gaseous CO2 would provide an incentive for the development of an advanced industrial process. Sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind or geothermal electricity could then be employed as a continuous power source, decreasing the overall cost.
