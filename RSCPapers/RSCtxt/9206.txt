    , Accepted 17th May 2017First published on 17th May 2017AbstractA-site cation doping in perovskite-based materials with the general ABO3 formula has a significant effect on the bifunctional oxygen activity (oxygen evolution and reduction reactions) of chemically stable electrocatalysts, enabling the design of highly active, durable, and cost-effective catalysts. In particular, the oxygen activity of double perovskite-structured NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ (NBSCF) is 0.973 V, which is much greater than that of previously reported transition metal-based nanostructures. This result is verified by examination of the electronic structure, oxidation state, and electrical properties of the perovskite-based materials using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the iodometric titration method, X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Further improvements of NBSCF for bifunctional oxygen activity are made by incorporating these synergistic hybrid structures with nitrogen doped-reduced graphene-based (N-rGO) nanostructures (NBSCF/N-rGO). The NBSCF/N-rGO has an oxygen electrode activity of 0.766 V, which is superior to that of other previously reported transition metal-based nanostructures and compares favorably to that of precious metal electrocatalysts. Furthermore, strong N-rGO provides considerably greater electrochemical long-term stability and integrity to NBSCF/N-rGO hybrid catalysts under continuous chronopotentiometric and long-term potential sweep testing conditions for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).
Introduction
According to the increasing demand for clean and sustainable energy, the number of research and development studies being carried out for new energy systems with high efficiency, low price, and eco-friendliness, such as metal–air batteries, water electrolyzers, and fuel cells, has increased to replace the conventional systems that use fossil fuels for power production.1–5 Among these new energy systems, unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs) have received significant attention as promising and clean energy conversion systems for application in fuel cell vehicles, hydrogen fueling stations, and stationary power plants.6,7 URFCs are bifunctional electrochemical devices, which produce electricity and hydrogen in the fuel cell and electrolysis mode, respectively, in a regenerative manner. In spite of the various advantages of URFCs, oxygen-related reactions for the cathode materials, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), undoubtedly play an important role in determining the overall reaction rate of URFCs.8,9 The OER is the anode reaction that produces H2 fuel in water electrolysis cells and plays an important role in energy storage with solar energy. On the other hand, the ORR is the cathode reaction in fuel cells which generates electricity through the electrochemical conversion of the chemical energy of H2 fuel.10–12
One of the technical issues which hinder the large-scale commercialization of URFCs is the sluggish kinetics of electrocatalysis, with significant overpotential loss for both the OER and ORR.13–15 Furthermore, until now, several precious metal-based catalysts such as platinum, iridium, and their alloys, which are considered the most active catalysts for both the ORR and OER, have been used to enhance the slow reaction rate ofelectrocatalysis. However, the poor durability, scarcity, and high cost of the noble metal-based catalysts limit the wide application of URFCs.16,17 With the intention of overcoming these technical issues, many types of catalysts such as non-precious metal-based catalysts, organometallic components, and heteroatom-doped carbon materials have been investigated to develop highly active and durable bifunctional catalysts with low cost.18–21 Among such classes of catalysts, perovskite-type (ABO3; A = La, Ba, Sr and B = Co, Fe, Mn) structured-oxide materials have been reported as promising catalysts for both the OER and ORR in alkaline media due to their unique crystalline structure.22–35
The perovskite structure is able to accommodate partial substitution of the A- and B-site cations with other elements, resulting in modification of the material properties such as catalytic activity, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. Furthermore, electrons (holes) or oxygen vacancies are introduced at the oxygen lattice sites, according to the charge neutrality condition.36,37 As an example, Suntivich, Risch, and Jung et al. demonstrated Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) to be an outstanding bifunctional catalyst in alkaline media.23,24,34,38 The high activity of BSCF was predicted from the eg-filling (σ*-orbital occupation) of surface B-site transition-metal cations in the oxide.39,40 Recently, Grimaud et al. exploited the versatility of the perovskite structure and reported the double perovskite PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBCO) to be a highly active and stable OER catalyst for water oxidation in alkaline solutions.41 The excellent properties of the double perovskite were demonstrated by showing that the computed O p-band center was neither too close nor too far from EF (ab initio studies). Kim et al. also stated that, unlike the ABO3 perovskite catalyst, the oxygen-deficient double perovskite catalyst (A2B2O5) has corner-linked square-pyramidal BO5 subunits.42 This oxygen deficiency could lead to higher OER performance because of the easy bonding between BO5 and OH− ions, the electronic configuration of B-site ions with high spin electrons occupying eg orbitals, and the favorable unit cell structure to transport the OH− ions.
Although double perovskite materials show promise for OER activity, thus far, less attention has been paid to their ORR activity and durability. Moreover, double perovskite materials are still significantly less active than Pt/C at the half-wave potential for the ORR with poor electrical conductivity.43,44 While carbon has often been added to catalyst materials to improve their conductivity, carbon might be harmful to the long-term performance of the materials due to its significant corrosion at high potentials.45 Hence, in this work, further advances are made in identifying highly active bifunctional OER and ORR perovskite catalysts. BSCF catalysts are modified by doping the lanthanide ions (Ln3+ = Nd3+, Sm3+, and Gd3+) into the A-site to form the double perovskite-based catalysts, LnBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ (LBSCF), through the expansion of the c-axis in the lattice. In addition, we hypothesize that the bifunctional activity (particularly, the ORR activity) of double perovskites can be improved through the supply of better electrochemical paths and reaction sites with high electrical conductivity if perovskite catalysts are well distributed on highly conductive and mechanically/chemically stable sheets. The high electrical conductivity, extremely large surface area, and high mechanical stability of graphene could be the key to fabricating successful perovskite catalysts for the ORR.46 Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of graphene can be considerably enhanced by substitutional heteroatom doping. Recently, nitrogen (N)-doping was introduced to modulate the outstanding material properties of graphene, such as increased n-type carrier concentration, reduced surface energy, and moderated work-function.47,48 In this study, further ORR improvements to the perovskite catalyst are made to take advantage of the practical benefits of the synergistic hybrid structures through the use of N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO)-based nanostructures. In order to understand the excellent performance of double perovskite materials, bulk calculations from the density functional theory (DFT) method are also carried out through an examination of the electronic structure of oxides critical to the bifunctional reactions.
Experimental
Synthesis of catalyst powders and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxides
All of the reagents were commercial materials of reagent grade and used without further purification. The Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) and LnBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ (LBSCF, Ln = Nd, Sm, and Gd) catalysts were synthesized by the glycine-nitrate process, according to our previous studies.49,50 Stoichiometric amounts of barium nitrate (Ba(NO3)2, 99.95% purity from Alfa Aesar), neodymium nitrate hexahydrate (Nd(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.9% purity from Alfa Aesar), samarium nitrate hexahydrate (Sm(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.9% purity from Alfa Aesar), gadolinium nitrate hexahydrate (Gd(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.9% purity from Alfa Aesar), strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2, 99% purity from Alfa Aesar), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 98% purity from Alfa Aesar), and iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 98% purity from Duksan chemicals) were used as starting materials. All of the precursors were initially dissolved in de-ionized (DI) water with glycine as fuel, and then heated on a hotplate above 250 °C while stirring. After auto-ignition of the precursors, the as-prepared ashes were crushed and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h. The calcined powders were ball-milled in ethanol for 24 h and then re-calcined at 900 °C for 4 h. The BSCF catalyst was also prepared via the same fabrication procedure and calcined at 1100 °C for 4 h.
For the synthesis of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO)-supported double perovskite materials (LBSCF/N-rGO), one-step exfoliation and nitrogen doping of graphene oxide (GO) were carried out by the hydrothermal reaction in a stainless steel autoclave.22,51–53 GO was synthesized from natural graphite powder (100 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) using the Hummers method.
Then an aqueous suspension of GO was homogenously mixed with DI water, LBSCF nanoparticles (the ratio of LBSCF to rGO is 2:1 by weight), and urea (Samchun chemicals) as a reducing source and doping agent in the Teflon beaker for 30 min, and then heat-treated at 180 °C for 12 h in an autoclave. Finally, the products were washed several times by filtration using DI water to remove any residual urea and then dried overnight on a hotplate. Overall catalysts are denoted as follows:
• Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ: BSCF.
• NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: NBSCF.
• SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: SBSCF.
• GdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: GBSCF.
• NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ/nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide: NBSCF/N-rGO.
Characterization of catalysts
The crystal structure of the catalysts was examined using high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) with diffraction angles ranging from 20° to 80° at a 9B beamline of the Pohang Light Source (PLS-II, Korea). The incident X-rays were vertically collimated and monochromatized using a double-crystal Si (111) monochromator (wavelength of 1.4861 Å). High-resolution synchrotron XRD data were analyzed using FullProf software for the indexing, refinement of the lattice parameters, and Rietveld refinement. The morphology of all the samples was observed using a field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4700, Hitachi High Tech) with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Oxford Instruments) analysis system. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2100F (JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
In order to analyze the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the perovskite catalysts, nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis was performed using a BELSORP-MAX (BEL) in liquid nitrogen (77 K). Prior to the physisorption analysis, a glass cell containing the sample was evacuated at 300 °C for 12 h to remove any moisture and dust. The specific surface area of the catalysts was calculated by BET theory in the relative pressure range of 0.05–0.20 for high accuracy. The total pore volume was determined at relative pressures in the range of 0.98–0.99. Pore size distribution was obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the adsorption branch of the isotherm. The Raman spectroscopy analysis was performed using a micro-Raman system (Renishaw, InVia system). The laser line (514.5 nm) with 1 μm of beam spot and 2 mW of power was used to identify the structural properties of N-rGO. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB 250, Thermo Scientific) was also used to acquire information about the chemical bonding with a monochromatized Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source, with the analysis chamber maintained in a vacuum for 1 × 10−10 Torr. The binding energy of the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV was used as a reference for the calibration.
The iodometric chemical titration method was used to obtain the oxygen non-stoichiometry (δ) using the calculation of the oxidation state of B-site ions (transition metal ions).54,55 All materials were dissolved in 10 mL of 3.5 N HCl (Samchun Chemical) aqueous solution, and 20 mL of 10% KI (Daejung Chemical) solution was then added to the HCl solution. After dissolution, the solution was purged with nitrogen gas to remove the remaining oxygen gas. Small amounts of corn-starch were then added as an indicator. The solution was titrated with 0.025 N sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3, Daejung Chemical), using a micropipette (Axygen) until the solution color began to change from dark blue to pale blue.
Electrochemical measurements of bifunctional catalysts
Electrochemical analysis of the perovskite-based catalysts was performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical analyzer (SP-150, Biologic) with a three-electrode system. A glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system (RRDE-3A, ALS). An Hg/HgO (sat. 1 M NaOH) electrode and Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The measured potentials were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique using a Pt disk as the working electrode while purging with hydrogen gas in a 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution (Daejung). In order to prepare a catalyst ink, 5 mg of carbon black (Cabot) powder, 10 mg of perovskite-based catalyst, DI water, isopropanol (Daejung), and 5 wt% aqueous Nafion solution (Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in a glass vial, and the mixture was then sonicated for 1 h to form a homogeneous suspension. 3 μL of the catalyst ink was pipetted using a microsyringe (Hamilton, Sigma-Aldrich) onto the glassy carbon electrode, and the deposited electrode was dried on a hot plate at 60 °C.
CV was performed for cleaning of the catalysts between 0.05 and 1.2 V vs. the RHE for 50 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in a N2-saturated electrolyte. The OER and ORR activity of the catalyst were measured using the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique. The OER polarization curves were obtained by sweeping the potential from 1.2 to 1.7 V vs. the RHE with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and rotation rate of 1600 rpm. The LSV for the ORR was measured from 1.2 to 0.2 V vs. the RHE at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with various electrode rotation speeds (400, 900, 1600, and 2500 rpm). The OER durability of the catalysts was investigated by performing CV between 1.25 and 1.65 V for 1500 cycles at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1. For measurement of the long-term stability of the ORR, the potential sweep was between 0.6 and 1.2 V for 10000 cycles at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1. The steady-state polarization was measured by the chronopotentiometry method for a 10 h period at 5 mA cm−2 and −3 mA cm−2 for the OER and ORR, respectively. The measured potentials for the OER were corrected by iR-compensation from the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis using an SP-150. The amplitude of the signal was controlled below 10 mV with the frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and mass-transfer resistance (Rmt) of the catalysts were fitted from the EIS results using the EC-Lab program with an equivalent circuit model. The overpotentials of the catalysts were calculated by subtracting the thermodynamic water-oxidation potential (1.23 V) from the obtained potential at 10 and -3 mA cm−2 for the OER and ORR, respectively.
Computational calculation methods
To describe the double perovskite structure of the LBSCFs, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the projector augmented wave pseudo method, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).56 Exchange-correlation was treated in the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA).57 In order to investigate the effect of lanthanides (Nd, Sm, and Gd) on the electronic structure of single and double perovskite structures, bulk calculations of BSFC and LBSCF were carried out. The O p-band center of the materials was determined from the first moment given by, (1)where Ep, EF, and Dp (E) are the p-band center, Fermi energy of the system, and density of states projected on the O p-states.
Results and discussion
Characterization of catalysts
The crystalline structures of the catalysts synthesized by the glycine-nitrate combustion method were investigated using high-resolution XRD and are shown in Fig. 1. In the XRD profiles, none of the catalysts showed extra peaks of other phases such as cobalt oxide or iron oxide in each sample. Interestingly, it was observed that the XRD peaks of double perovskite materials (NBSCF, SBSCF and GBSCF) were shifted to a higher angle of 0.6–0.9° in the full range of patterns, compared to those of single perovskite BSCF. This indicates that the lanthanide ion in the A-site of the ABO3 perovskite structure acts as a structure modifier in the unit cell because the ionic radius of lanthanide ions is smaller than that of barium ions (0.367–0.412 Å). The unit cell volumes and lattice parameters of the double perovskite catalysts also decreased with decreasing ionic radius of the lanthanide ions (Nd3+ > Sm3+ > Gd3+). Furthermore, the structure of the double perovskite materials is more oxygen-deficient than that of single perovskite materials because extra oxygen vacancies are generated to reduce the lattice energy formed by the large difference between the ionic radii.41,42

For a detailed understanding of the crystalline structure and space group of the catalysts, XRD patterns were also analyzed using the Rietveld refinement method, with a pseudo-Voigt function in computer software. The refined results (unit cell information) of BSCF, NBSCF, SBSCF, and GBSCF are shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1.† The BSCF was indexed as cubic in the Pmm (no. 221) space group, while NBSCF, SBSCF and GBSCF were indexed as the orthorhombic Pmmm (no. 47) space group. The unit cell parameters (i.e. the a-, b-, and c-axis) of the BSCF were the same value of 3.9794 Å. In contrast, the a-, b-, and c-axes of NBSCF were 3.8563, 3.8270, and 7.7365 Å, respectively, indicating that the c-axis was two times that typically found for a primitive perovskite structure.
The microstructure and morphology of the perovskite-based catalysts were characterized by FE-SEM and HR-TEM. As observed from Fig. 2, all catalysts presented a porous and tightly agglomerated feature with particle sizes in the range of 100–500 nm, typical of the morphology of combustion-synthesized ceramic powders. The porous nature of the samples was analyzed by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and their results are shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1. The BET surface area of the catalysts was determined to be 12.4, 2.8, 3.6, and 4.6 m2 g−1 for the BSCF, SBSCF, GBSCF, and NBSCF, respectively. The pore size distribution (total pore volume and pore size) obtained from adsorption branches by using the BJH method is also presented in Fig. 3b. The formed pores of perovskite oxides had a significantly small size of 8.6–33.2 nm, in agreement with other perovskite materials owing to high calcination temperature.58–63 For examination of the lanthanide material distributions in perovskite catalysts, the elemental compositions of NBSCF, SBSCF, and GBSCF were analyzed using an EDX system attached to the SEM. As shown in Fig. S2,† the lanthanides (Nd, Sm, and Gd) are well dispersed in double perovskite materials without any segregation within the detection limit of EDX. The detailed compositions of each element for the catalysts are shown in Table S2.†

Electrochemical OER and ORR activity and stability of the catalysts
In order to evaluate the OER activity of the catalysts, LSV was conducted by potentiostat/galvanostat with RDE equipment in an N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Fig. 4a and b show the OER polarization curves and the corresponding Tafel plots corrected by using the iR interruption method. The OER catalysts should have low overpotential (ηover) at 10 mA cm−2, which is relevant for a solar system for synthesizing hydrogen and oxygen fuels.

(c) ORR polarization curves with (d) the corresponding Tafel plots and (e) electron transfer numbers by Koutecky–Levich plots. (f) Oxygen electrode activities of perovskite-structured materials and NBSCF/N-rGO hybrid catalysts including precious metal nanoparticles (Ir/C and Pt/C) for bifunctional OER and ORR properties. 
The relative electrocatalytic ηover of perovskite-based catalysts increased in the order of NBSCF (0.361 V) < SBSCF (0.372 V) < GBSCF (0.390 V) < BSCF (0.416 V) at 10 mA cm−2. The NBSCF catalyst exhibits a higher current density (j) and lower onset potential (ηonset) than the other perovskite-based catalysts. The electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts was also determined by the Tafel plots in OER polarization curves. Among these perovskite-based catalysts, the NBSCF catalyst exhibits the lowest Tafel slope of 88 mV dec−1. The exchange current density (jo) of BSCF, GBSCF, SBSCF, and NBSCF for the OER is 1.22 × 10−3, 1.28 × 10−3, 1.38 × 10−3, and 1.45 × 10−3 mA cm−2, respectively. Carbon-supported Ir nanoparticles (Ir/C) were chosen to compare with the perovskite-based catalysts in the OER. The activity of the NBSCF catalyst (ηover and Tafel slope: 0.361 V and 88 mV dec−1) approached close to that of the Ir/C catalyst (ηover and Tafel slope: 0.350 V and 76 mV dec−1).
The perovskite structure-based catalysts also demonstrated remarkable ORR activities at room temperature. The LSV polarization curves of the samples for the ORR, which were measured in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH solutions at 1600 rpm and 5 mV s−1, are shown in Fig. 4c and S3.† The LSV curves of the catalysts show that the on-set potentials of BSCF, GBSCF, SBSCF, and NBSCF are 0.790, 0.805, 0.797, and 0.791 V (vs. the RHE) at −0.1 mA cm−2, respectively. The potentials required to reach −3 mA cm−2 during the ORR are 0.619, 0.648, 0.649, and 0.651 V for BSCF, GBSCF, SBSCF, and NBSCF, respectively. Similar to the test in the OER, the NBSCF showed the best ORR performance among these catalysts at the on-set potential and half-wave potential. The kinetic aspects of these catalysts were investigated using their Tafel plots and jo, as shown in Fig. 4d and e. The Tafel slopes of BSCF, GBSCF, SBSCF, and NBSCF for the ORR are −62, −56, −57, and −52 mV dec−1, respectively. Additionally, to understand the oxygen reduction pathway, the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots (the inverse current density, j−1, as a function of the inverse of the square root of the rotation speed, ω−1/2) of the perovskite oxide catalysts are obtained from LSVs for different potentials. All plots show a relatively linear relationship, indicating first-order reaction kinetics toward dissolved oxygen (Fig. 4e). The transferred electron number (n) per oxygen molecule involved in the ORR process determined from the empirical K–L equations was 3.6, 3.7, 3.7, and 3.8 for BSCF, GBSCF, SBSCF, and NBSCF, respectively, at the potentials ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 V, implying that the double perovskite oxide catalysts favor a four-electron oxygen reduction process (Fig. S4†). This four-electron pathway is preferable to achieve high efficiency ORR catalytic activity in electrochemical energy conversion systems, and indicates that almost all reacted oxygen was entirely reduced to H2O. However, although NBSCF exhibited the best performance for the ORR catalyst activity in the perovskite-based materials, a significant performance gap is still observed between the Pt/C and NBSCF catalyst at the potential of a current density of −3 mA cm−2, which is virtually the half-wave potential. The NBSCF catalyst was ∼230 mV less active than Pt/C at the half-wave potential for the ORR. Further improvements could be achieved through the use of heteroatom doped-carbon-based hybrid nanostructures. These improvements are discussed in the following section.
The catalytic stability is also one of the important parameters of the bifunctional catalyst. The OER stability of the catalysts was examined using a potential sweep method from 1.25 to 1.65 V (vs. the RHE) with a scan rate of 200 mV s−1 for 1500 cycles. Fig. S5a† shows the polarization curves of the catalyst after 1500 potential cycles and Fig. 5a shows the activity loss calculated from the decay ratio of the current density at 1.65 V (vs. the RHE) before and after the durability test. The OER activity of NBSCF decreased from 13.2 to 10.6 mA cm−2, resulting in 20.5% activity loss, while the corresponding activity losses for the SBSCF, GBSCF, BSCF, and Ir/C catalysts were 23.9, 26.1, 52.7, and 58.5%, respectively. That is, the double perovskite structured catalysts exhibited 50% less activity loss than BSCF and Ir/C (Fig. S5b†). The catalytic stability of perovskite materials with Ir/C was also evaluated by a continuous chronopotentiometric response as a function of time under alkaline conditions (0.1 M KOH) at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 for the OER. NBSCF exhibits stable OER catalytic performance with negligible degradation for the 10 h period in the time-dependent overpotential curves presented in Fig. 5b.

We also performed an accelerated durability test of catalysts for the ORR by potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.2 V (vs. the RHE) with a scan rate of 200 mV s−1 for 10000 cycles under an oxygen atmosphere. The potential difference between the catalysts at −3 mA cm−2 before and after the stability test is presented in Fig. 5c. After 10000 continuous cycling tests, all of the catalysts exhibit decreased ORR activity and the NBSCF catalyst shows a lower potential difference (higher ORR stability) than BSCF, SBCF, and GBSCF. The potential difference between the catalysts at −3 mA cm−2 before and after the stability test is presented in Fig. 5c. After 10000 continuous cycling tests, all of the catalysts exhibit decreased ORR activity and the NBSCF catalyst shows a lower potential difference (higher ORR stability) than BSCF, SBCF, and GBSCF. The half-wave potential (E1/2 at −3 mA cm−2) of the catalysts shifted negatively by 99.5, 51.9, 71.8 and 69.6 mV for the BSCF, NBSCF, SBSCF and GBSCF catalysts, respectively (Fig. S6†). Moreover, the chronopotentiometric measurement of the NBSCF at −3 mA cm−2 shows a relatively stable trace of ORR activity for more than 10 h (Fig. 5d), although some voltage fluctuation is observed during the test. These results demonstrated the excellent potential of using the NBSCF as an effective and stable bifunctional catalyst for both the ORR and OER.
Analysis of high performance double perovskite materials
In order to quantitatively compare the bifunctional activity among the catalysts for the oxygen electrode, the potential difference between 10 mA cm−2 (for the OER) and −3 mA cm−2 (for the ORR) was calculated as an indicator of oxygen activity (Table 2). The smaller difference between the two values indicates a more elevated electrocatalytic activity for the reversible oxygen electrodes.64,65Fig. 4f shows the bifunctional oxygen activity of the perovskite oxide-based catalysts. The double perovskite structured catalysts were found to be highly active for both the ORR and the OER. In particular, the oxygen electrode activity of NBSCF was 0.973 V, which is much greater than that of the previously reported transition metal-based nanostructures, as listed in Table 2.64–67

To fully understand the high performance of oxygen electrode catalysts, the relative surface area by the BET method is typically the most considered parameter, because the actual active sites for electrochemical reactions are proportional to the surface area of the catalysts with a small crystallite size.68 However, double perovskite-based catalysts exhibit very low values of surface areas, ranging from 2.8 (SBSCF) to 4.6 (NBSCF) m2 g−1, as presented in Table 1 and Fig. 3. On the other hand, most oxygen catalysts have a significantly large BET surface area of several hundred m2 g−1 (100 - 500 m2 g−1), namely, nanostructured particles displaying high mass activities. This indicates that the singular physical, chemical, and electronic properties of double perovskite structured materials contribute to the bifunctional oxygen activity, in contrast with the well-known nanostructured catalysts.
In order to understand the excellent performance of double perovskite NBSCF, bulk calculations from the density functional theory (DFT) method were carried out through an analysis of the electronic structure of oxides critical to the bifunctional reactions. As a descriptor for the catalytic activity toward the OER and ORR, the O p-band centers for perovskite materials were found to be closely related to the rate of oxygen vacancy formation and surface oxygen exchange.41 In Fig. 6a, the computed O p-band center relative to EF (eV) is schematically presented to explain the doping influence of lanthanides (Nd, Sm, and Gd) on the electronic structure of perovskite materials. The O p-band center of BSCF adjusts to higher energies (−2.33 to −2.01 eV for Nd) at low lanthanide doping at the A-site (<0.5 mol%) and then modifies to lower energies (−2.01 to −2.67 eV for Nd) for higher doping (>0.5 mol%). That is, the doping of lanthanide ions shows the shift of the O p-band center away from the EF in DFT calculations, thereby resulting in increased activity and stability of double perovskite oxides (Fig. 6b and c), in agreement with the results of recent studies.38,41,42 This result may be due to the hybridization of oxygen 2p and metal 3d orbitals and the alteration of the B–O bond length in the ABO3 perovskite structure. Additionally, the rotation and distortion of B–O octahedra caused by A (Ba and Sr) and B-site (Co and Fe) ionic radii mismatch results in a nonlinear dependence of the O p-band center of BSCF relative to the EF with lanthanide doping (Nd).23,24

The additional formation of oxygen vacancies () in oxygen lattices, formed by the difference in the ionic radius and polarizability between the Ba and the lanthanides, may contribute to improve the catalytic activity and stability of NBSCF. As the active sites for the transport of oxygen-ions, a high concentration of  localized in the lanthanide plane of the double perovskite is expected to have high adsorption and desorption capabilities for the O2 and OH− species in the ORR and OER.69,70 Furthermore, a smaller size mismatch between the host and dopant cations in the A-site of perovskite materials reduces the local strain in the lattice, resulting in more structural stability of bifunctional catalysts.42 In order to confirm this inference, the oxygen nonstoichiometry (δ) of the catalysts was calculated from the B-site oxidation states of perovskite materials using the iodometric titration method, the results of which are shown in Fig. 6d. It was found that the oxygen contents linearly increase with increasing oxidation state of B-site materials and the δ values are 0.264, 0.299, 0.347, and 0.389 for BSCF, GBSCF, SBSCF, and NBSCF, respectively, in agreement with the results of OER and ORR activity (Table 3). That is, the NBSCF catalyst showed the largest oxygen deficiency, thus resulting in excellent oxygen activity in our investigations.

It has been reported that the hydroxyl species at the surface oxygen of the catalyst enhance the oxygen evolution and reduction activity in alkaline solution.71 The rate determining step of the OER and ORR can be defined by the OH− adsorption and desorption on the oxygen surface of the catalysts. Further amounts of OH− species are governed by the chemical properties of the oxygen surface. The oxygen species such as OH− and lattice oxygen (O2−) on the catalyst surface were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S8†). Fig. 6e shows the ratio of OH−:O2− in O 1s XPS spectra of the perovskite-based catalysts. NBSCF exhibited the highest value for the ratio of OH−:O2− among the catalysts (Table 3). Furthermore, the surface OH− species indicate that the extra oxygen vacancies are generated by lanthanide ions; thus, a higher ratio of OH−:O2− implies a higher reaction rate for oxygen activity.
EIS analysis was carried out at various current densities in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz and the calculated resistance values (charge- and mass-transport resistances) of the samples are shown in Fig. 6f. The equivalent circuit model was used to divide the ohmic resistance (Rohmic) of the solution electrolyte, charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and capacitance (Cct), and the mass-transfer resistance (Rmt) and capacitance (Cmt) of the perovskite-based catalysts (in Fig. S10†). At high frequencies (>10 kHz), the x-intercepts with plots of the catalysts are almost similar, indicating that the solution resistance does not change with the applied current density and catalysts. It is clearly observed that, between 10 kHz and 100 mHz, the NBSCF presented lower Rct values than SBSCF, GBSCF and BSCF. The lower Rct values are related to the higher OER and ORR performances with low overpotential. That is, this result indicates that A-site doping has a significant effect on the oxygen activity in double perovskite-based catalysts in terms of the modification of the electronic structure and the oxidation state of B-site materials through the formation of extra oxygen vacancies in the lattice.
Bifunctional activity and stability of NBSCF/N-rGO hybrid catalysts
A considerable ORR performance gap (∼230 mV less active) still exists between the Pt/C and NBSCF catalysts at the half-wave potential, as shown in Fig. 4c and f, even though NBSCF exhibited the best performance for the bifunctional catalyst activity and stability in perovskite-based materials. Further ORR improvements of the NBSCF catalyst are carried out through the use of the synergistic N-rGO-based hybrid nanostructures (NBSCF/N-rGO) for the real application of URFCs, as mentioned earlier. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of NBSCF/N-rGO (the ratio of NBSCF to rGO is 2:1 by weight). The characteristic peaks in NBSCF/N-rGO were well indexed to the double perovskite phase (the same as the XRD pattern of the as-prepared NBSCF powders), except the broad peak at around 23°, which corresponds to the (002) peak of carbon in rGO. Furthermore, any extra peaks of other phases were not observed in the XRD patterns of the NBSCF/N-rGO. The structure and morphology of the NBSCF/N-rGO were examined by FE-SEM and TEM. The FE-SEM images (Fig. 2e) showed that the particle sizes of NBSCF/N-rGO were about 50–100 nm, which are much smaller than those of the NBSCF (Fig. 2b) synthesized by the glycine-nitrate combustion method.
Furthermore, the NBSCF/N-rGO showed the highest BET specific surface area (119.6 m2 g−1) and the highest micropore volume (0.245 cm3 g−1), which were significantly greater than those of the NBSCF (4.6 m2 g−1 and 0.011 cm3 g−1, respectively) (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The perovskite-based catalysts exhibited type II isotherms with corresponding hysteresis loops, which showed nitrogen uptake at the high relative pressure, indicating that the pores were first generated between particles. That is, the perovskite oxides showed low surface areas (large particle sizes) with small sizes of pores (agglomerated features), as mentioned earlier. In contrast, the NBSCF/N-rGO catalyst showed the type IV isotherm which is associated with capillary condensation occurring in mesopores and the limiting uptake over a range of high P/P0, thereby exhibiting a considerably high surface area (119.57 m2 g−1) with the bimodal-type pore size distributions (meso and macropores). This indicates that NBSCF nanoparticles are well decorated on the surfaces of the porous N-doped graphene networks. High specific areas and pore sizes of NBSCF/N-rGO can be utilized as electrochemically active sites for the OER and ORR.72
Raman spectroscopy is one of the most effective analysis tools to understand the structural changes of 2D shaped graphene materials. In Fig. S7,† the D band at 1347 cm−1 reveals the heteroatoms and defects in graphene, which is increased by a breathing mode of carbon-rings or K-point photons of A1g symmetry, while the G band at 1587 cm−1 indicates the graphitic level of the carbon structure, corresponding to the first order scattering of the E2g phonons of sp2 carbon atoms.77–80 The intensity ratio of the D to G bands (ID/IG) is a crucial factor to evaluate the degree of disorder and the graphene surface modified with heteroatoms.81 The NBSCF/N-rGO catalyst exhibited an ID/IG value of 1.201, indicating that the synthesized NBSCF/N-rGO holds defect sites caused by doped N atoms.81–83
XPS analysis was also carried out to investigate the interaction between the NBSCF and N-rGO, and the result is presented in Fig. S9.† For the NBSCF/N-rGO material, two characteristic peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 are observed at 780.2 and 795.3 eV, respectively, whereas the peak pairs of 779.1 and 794.4 eV can be designated as the Co 2p core-level spectra of NBSCF at 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 excitations, respectively (Fig. S9a†). This indicates that the Co 2p peaks of NBSCF/N-rGO were shifted by 1 eV to higher energies, compared to those of NBSCF. Higher shifted binding energy is caused by the interaction between doped N atoms and transition metal ions.84–86 The doped N atoms on rGO hold the negative charge and thus affect the neighbouring components. Therefore, multivalent ions (here Co or Fe) should be chemically shifted to a higher oxidation state to keep their electroneutrality.87 In addition, it is clearly observed that the N 1s spectrum of NBSCF/N-rGO was deconvoluted into several individual peaks such as pyridinic-N (398.2 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.5 eV), and graphitic-N (400.6 eV) (in Fig. S9b†). In particular, the pyridinic-N can offer electrocatalytically active sites for the OER and ORR owing to the π-electrons from the edge side of the rGO plane.88,89 Hence, we expect that the N-doped graphitic carbons as a support material compensate the chemical stability and electrical conductivity of the metal complexes.
The bifunctional oxygen activity of NBSCF/N-rGO was measured with a RRDE in 0.1 M KOH solution (Fig. 4). The NBSCF/N-rGO showed superior ORR activity (Tafel slope = −40 mV dec−1) to the perovskite-structured materials. The onset potential of NBSCF/N-rGO, determined as the potential when the current density is −0.1 mA cm−2, was 0.988 V (vs. the RHE), similar to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.990 V). In addition, the electron transfer number of NBSCF/N-rGO was 4.0 for the ORR by Koutecky–Levich analysis, indicating that the reaction occurred mainly through a four electron pathway. The OER performance of the NBSCF/N-rGO catalysts towards water oxidation was also characterized using the RDE in 0.1 M KOH electrolytes. Clearly, the activity of the NBSCF/N-rGO (ηover and Tafel slope: 0.369 V and 89 mV dec−1) showed a negligible change and was similar to that of Ir/C (ηover and Tafel slope: 0.350 V and 76 mV dec−1) (Fig. 4a and b). Moreover, as the figure of merit adopted to quantify bifunctional (OER and ORR) activity, the NBSCF/N-rGO has an oxygen electrode activity (EOER − EORR) of 0.766 V, which is superior to that of other previously reported transition metal-based nanostructures, and compares favorably to precious metal electrocatalysts (Fig. 4f and Table 4).20,67,73–76

This excellent bifunctional performance (particularly the significantly enhanced ORR activity) of NBSCF/N-rGO can be attributed to the high surface area with a microstructure (e.g. high micropore volume) that facilitates the transport of reactants and products during the process of the ORR. The BET specific surface area of NBSCF considerably increased from 4.6 to 119.6 m2 g−1 through the incorporation of nanostructured N-rGO sheets (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The severely agglomerated NBSCF powders were well dispersed on the highly conductive sheets as nanoparticles. In addition, the edge and defect sites of N-rGO act as extra active sites for the ORR, thus resulting in substantially improved ORR activity through the supply of better electrochemical reaction sites, as explained in Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S7†) and XPS analysis (Fig. S9†).
Furthermore, fast ion transport and electron conduction are important parameters for high ORR activity. We examined the importance of the nanostructured N-rGO structure for transport by using the EIS technique. It is clearly observed that the Rct of NBSCF significantly decreased from 0.568 to 0.029 Ω cm2, through the use of highly conductive N-rGO, as shown in Fig. 6f and S10.† Furthermore, the NBSCF/N-rGO presented a much lower Rmt value than NBSCF. Comparisons of the EIS results demonstrated that the high ORR activity of NBSCF/N-rGO, which has a high BET specific surface area and micropore volume, resulted from its outstanding charge and mass transport characteristics. Nitrogen-doping in rGO also provides crucial functions for the excellent ORR activity by modification of the electrical properties by excessive electrons while lowering the work-function for facile bifunctional reactions.
Strong N-rGO can provide exceedingly stronger electrochemical long-term stability and integrity of hybrid catalysts. We investigated the stability of the NBSCF/N-rGO catalysts for the OER by using a potential sweep (1.25–1.65 V) and continuous chronopotentiometric method (5 mA cm−2) under the same testing conditions as those for the perovskite materials. The OER activity of NBSCF decreased from 11.9 to 10.6 mA cm−2, resulting in a 10% loss of activity, and the potential loss at an applied current density of 5 mA cm−2 was less than 0.9% for over 10 h. The corresponding activity loss was much less than that for the other double perovskite materials and Ir/C, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. Moreover, much improved performance durability of NBSCF was achieved with the N-rGO supporters under accelerated cycling tests between 0.6 and 1.2 V (vs. the RHE) for the ORR (Fig. 5c). In addition, the NBSCF/N-rGO catalyst showed the best ORR stability for the chronopotentiometric measurement of the NBSCF at −3 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5d). As mentioned earlier, the enhanced performance durability of the NBSCF/N-rGO catalysts was linked to the synergistic hybrid structures through the use of N-rGO-based nanostructures.
Conclusions
In summary, in order to investigate the influence of double perovskite-based catalysts on bifunctional oxygen activity (OER and ORR), BSCF was modified by doping of lanthanide ions (Ln3+ = Nd3+, Sm3+, and Gd3+) into the A-site to form LBSCFs, through the expansion of the c-axis in the lattice. The unit cell volumes and lattice parameters of the double perovskite catalysts were found to decrease with the decrease of the radius of Ln3+ (Nd3+ > Sm3+ > Gd3+) from the Rietveld refinement analysis of XRD data. That is, double perovskite materials showed a more oxygen-deficient structure than single perovskite materials, since extra oxygen vacancies are generated to reduce the lattice energy formed by the large difference among ionic radii. In addition, A-site doping has a significant effect on the bifunctional oxygen activity of double perovskite-based catalysts; in particular, the oxygen activity of NBSCF was 0.973 V, which was much greater than that of the previously reported transition metal-based nanostructures, even though the NBSFC exhibited surface areas with very low values (2.8–4.6 m2 g−1). This result was attributed to the modification of the electronic structure and the oxidation state of B-site materials through the formation of extra oxygen vacancies in the lattice. This result also confirmed the computed O p-band centers (by DFT), calculated oxygen nonstoichiometry (by the iodometric titration method), the ratio of OH−:O2− (in O 1s XPS spectra), and the Rct (using the EIS technique). Further ORR improvements of the NBSCF catalyst were carried out using the synergistic N-rGO-based hybrid nanostructures for the real application of URFCs. The NBSCF/N-rGO showed superior ORR activity (Tafel slope = −40 mV dec−1) and onset potential (0.988 V at −0.1 mA cm−2) over the perovskite-structured materials. In addition, the OER activity of the NBSCF/N-rGO catalyst showed a negligible change and was similar to that of Ir/C. Moreover, a much improved performance durability of NBSCF was achieved with N-rGO supporters under long-term potential sweep and continuous chronopotentiometric conditions for the OER and ORR.
