The composites showed photocatalytic activity for Z-schematic water splitting under visible light or simulated sunlight irradiation without an electron mediator. The optimum pH for the water splitting was neutral. Water splitting over the composite proceeded via an interparticle electron transfer from BiVO4 to Ru/SrTiO3:Rh particles at the large interfacial area obtained by those preparation methods. The photocatalytic water splitting activity of the composite depended on the crystallinity and morphology of BiVO4. The composite prepared by the liquid–solid state reaction showed the highest photocatalytic activity. This was due to the formation of well-crystallized BiVO4 single-crystal-like particles. The BiVO4–Ru/SrTiO3:Rh composite photocatalyst gave a quantum yield of 1.6% at 420 nm and a stable activity. Thus, we have developed the simplest system requiring no additives, except for photocatalyst powder and water, for photocatalytic solar water splitting.
Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting using powdered photocatalysts and semiconductor photoelectrodes has attracted attention as a clean method of hydrogen production from water.1,2 Light energy is converted to chemical energy accompanied with a large positive change in the Gibbs free energy through the water splitting. Therefore, photocatalytic water splitting is regarded as artificial photosynthesis. Specifically, a powdered photocatalyst system will be advantageous for large-scale applications of solar water splitting because of its simplicity of fabrication.2,3
At the present stage, a lot of photocatalysts that show high activity for water splitting have been developed.4,5 However, most of the photocatalysts only respond to ultraviolet light. It is important to develop visible-light-responsive photocatalysts in order to harvest sunlight efficiently.
Although visible-light-driven photocatalysts for water splitting such as RhxCryO/(GaN)x(ZnO)1−x6 have been reported, the number of photocatalysts is very limited. In contrast, many visible-light-driven photocatalysts for sacrificial H2 and O2 evolution reactions, the half reactions of water splitting, have been developed. For example, WO3,7 BiVO4,8 TiO2:Cr,Sb,9 AgNbO3,10 SrTiO3:Cr,Ta,11 TiO2:Rh,Sb,12 SrTiO3:Rh,13 TaON,14 ATaO2N (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba)14 and Ta3N5.15,16 Water splitting under visible light irradiation without any sacrificial reagents has been achieved by construction of a Z-scheme photocatalyst system (two-step photoexcitation) composed of H2- and O2-evolving photocatalysts.17–39 Most of the Z-scheme photocatalyst systems employ ionic electron mediators such as IO3−/I−, Fe3+/Fe2+, [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ and [Co(phen)3]3+/2+ redox couples.17–33 The electron mediator plays an important role in electron transfer from an O2-evolving photocatalyst to a H2-evolving photocatalyst. However, the electron mediator also gives negative effects, such as backward-reactions of water splitting and the shielding of incident light. In most cases, moreover, electron mediators work at only a limited pH range. A unique Z-scheme photocatalyst system for water splitting has also been developed by employing electroconductive photoreduced-graphene oxide (PRGO) as a solid electron mediator for shuttling electrons, a H2-evolving photocatalyst (Ru/SrTiO3:Rh) and an O2-evolving photocatalyst (BiVO4).34 We have also reported a new type of Z-scheme photocatalyst system driven by interparticle electron transfer (IPET) between a H2-evolving photocatalyst (Ru/SrTiO3:Rh) and an O2-evolving photocatalyst (BiVO4) without an electron mediator.35 In this system, only SrTiO3:Rh with p-type character40 functions as a H2-evolving photocatalyst at present. Z-scheme photocatalyst systems consisting of SrTiO3:Rh and various O2-evolving photocatalysts such as TiO2,35 TiO2:Cr,Sb,35 TiO2:Rh,Sb,35 WO3,35 and Ir/CoOx/Ta3N5 (ref. 36) also show activity for water splitting. The activity of this Z-scheme system strongly depends on the dispersed state of H2- and O2-evolving photocatalysts in the reactant solution. The highest photocatalytic activity is obtained when two types of photocatalyst particles are aggregated with suitable contact under acidic pH conditions. In contrast, this Z-scheme photocatalyst system shows poor activity under neutral pH conditions in pure water, because the photocatalyst particles are independently suspended. Therefore, we are interested in constructing a new and simple composite Z-scheme photocatalyst system in which the H2-evolving photocatalyst (Ru/SrTiO3:Rh) and O2-evolving photocatalyst (BiVO4) particles strongly attach to each other to solve the problem of the poor contact between two types of photocatalyst particles.
In the present study, a BiVO4–Ru/SrTiO3:Rh composite was prepared by an impregnation method and a liquid–solid state reaction in order to construct a simple photocatalyst system for water splitting under visible light irradiation. Solar water splitting was also demonstrated using the present composite photocatalyst.
Experimental
Preparation and characterization of photocatalysts
SrTiO3:Rh(1%) as a H2-evolving photocatalyst was prepared by a solid–state reaction as previously reported.13 The starting materials of SrCO3 (Kanto chemical; 99.9%), TiO2 (Soekawa chemical; 99.9%) and Rh2O3 (Wako pure chemical) were mixed in a mortar at the ratio of Sr–Ti–Rh = 1.03:0.99:0.01. The mixture was calcined at 1273 K for 10 h in air using an alumina crucible. A Ru (0.7 wt%) cocatalyst working as an active site for H2 evolution was loaded on SrTiO3:Rh(1%) by photodeposition from an aqueous methanol solution (10 vol%) containing RuCl3·nH2O (Tanaka Kikinzoku).31,35 The Ru cocatalyst-loaded photocatalyst was collected by filtration and washed with water.
BiVO4 of an O2-evolving photocatalyst was combined with Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) by an impregnation method and a liquid–solid state reaction. In the case of the impregnation method, Bi(NO3)3 (Kanto chemical; 99.9%) and NH4VO3 (Kanto chemical; 99.0%) at an equal molar ratio were dissolved in 4 mol L−1 of an aqueous nitric acid solution (Kanto chemical) as a precursor solution. The concentrations of Bi3+ and V5+ ions were 0.4 mmol L−1. The Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) powder and a desired amount of the precursor solution were put into a porcelain crucible. Water was evaporated in a water bath. The dried powder was calcined at 673 K for 2 h in air, resulting in the formation of the BiVO4–Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) composite (Composite-Imp). The obtained composite photocatalyst was acid-treated in 0.5 mol L−1of an aqueous nitric acid solution for 5 days (Composite-Imp-AT), if necessary. In the case of a liquid–solid state reaction,8 BiVO4 was prepared in the presence of Ru-loaded SrTiO3:Rh powder. Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) and V2O5 (Wako pure chemical; 99.0%) powder was added to 0.5 mol L−1 of an aqueous nitric acid solution of Bi(NO3)3 (Kanto chemical; 99.9%). The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 5 days. Then, a BiVO4–Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) composite photocatalyst (Composite-LSR) was obtained. The flow chart of the composite preparation and their abbreviated names are shown in Fig. S1.†
The obtained composite powder was confirmed by X-ray diffraction using Cu Kα radiation (XRD; Rigaku; MiniFlex). Surface areas were determined by BET measurements (Coulter; SA3100). Photocatalyst particles fixed with carbon paste on a sample holder were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Jeol; JSM-6700F). Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (JASCO; Ubest-570) and were converted from reflection to absorbance by the Kubelka–Munk method.
Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic reactions were mainly conducted in a gas-closed-circulation system and a top irradiation cell with a Pyrex window. Photocatalyst powders (0.2–0.4 g) were suspended in water (150 mL). If necessary, the pH of the reactant solution was adjusted with H2SO4 (Kanto chemical) and NaOH (Kanto chemical). The light source was a 300 W Xe-lamp (ILC technology; CERMAX LX-300). The irradiation wavelength was controlled by a combination of a cold mirror and a cut-off filter (420 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm). The amounts of evolved H2 and O2 were determined with gas chromatography (Shimadzu; GC8A; MS-5A column, Ar carrier, TCD). A 300 W Xe-lamp (Ashahi Spectra; MAX-301) with band-pass filters was employed for measurement of an apparent quantum yield (AQY). The number of incident photons was measured using a photo-diode head (OPHIRA; PD300-UV) and a power monitor (NOVA). AQY was calculated according to eqn (1). (1)
Photocatalytic water splitting was also carried out using an Ar flow system and a solar simulator with an air-mass 1.5 filter (Peccell Technologies; PEC-L11, 100 mW cm−2). The solar water splitting was conducted using a top irradiation cell with a Pyrex window with an irradiation area of 33 cm2. The amount of evolved H2 and O2 were determined with gas chromatography (Inficon; 3000 Micro GC, MS-5A column, Ar carrier, TCD). The solar energy conversion efficiency (STH) was defined by eqn (2). (2)
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of the composite

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of BiVO4–Ru/SrTiO3:Rh composites prepared by an impregnation method and a liquid–solid state reaction. The combined amount of BiVO4 was 250 wt% to Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%). The ratio in weight was 2.5:1. In this case, the molar ratio of BiVO4 to SrTiO3:Rh was about 1.4:1. All samples gave the diffraction pattern of BiVO4 with a scheelite structure and a monoclinic phase (s–m) which showed a high photocatalytic activity,8,41 in addition to the pattern of SrTiO3:Rh with a perovskite structure. The full widths at half maxima of the (110), (011), (002) and (200) peaks for the Composite-Imp-AT (Fig. S2(B)†) and the Composite-LSR (Fig. S2(C)†) were narrower than those for the Composite-Imp (Fig. S2(A)†), indicating the higher crystallinity of BiVO4 in Composite-Imp-AT and Composite-LSR compared to Composite-Imp.
 Fig. 1  X-ray diffraction patterns of the BiVO4(250 wt%)-Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) composite Z-scheme photocatalyst. Preparation methods: (A) impregnation (Composite-Imp), (B) nitric acid treatment at room temperature for 5 days after impregnation (Composite-Imp-AT), and (C) a liquid–solid state reaction (Composite-LSR). SrTiO3:Rh was prepared by a solid state reaction at 1273 K for 10 h. Ru cocatalyst was loaded by photodeposition. 

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of BiVO4–Ru/SrTiO3:Rh composites prepared by an impregnation method and a liquid–solid state reaction. Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) without BiVO4 (Fig. 2(A)) and a physical mixture of BiVO4 with Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) powder (Fig. 2(G)) were also observed as reference samples. The SrTiO3:Rh(1%) particle without BiVO4 prepared by a solid–state reaction was an aggregate of primary particles with about 100 nm of the particle size (Fig. 2(A)). Two kinds of particles with different shapes and particle sizes were observed for the composites (Fig. 2(B–F)). SEM-EDS mappings were carried out for the samples of Fig. 2(B) and (D) to examine these particles (Fig. S3†). The particles were identified as BiVO4 and SrTiO3:Rh. It was confirmed that BiVO4 particles of about 100 nanometers for the Composite-Imp (Fig. 2(B)) and 1–2 micrometers for the Composite-LSR (Fig. 2(D and E)) were combined with the Ru/SrTiO3:Rh particles. Thus, SrTiO3:Rh(1%) was successfully combined with BiVO4 by the impregnation method and the liquid–solid state reaction (Fig. 2(B–F)), which differed from the physical mixture in which the two types of particle were separated from each other (Fig. 2(G)). The morphology of the obtained BiVO4 depended on the preparation method of the composite. BiVO4 of the Composite-Imp was an aggregate of small particles with a round shape and had many grain boundaries (Fig. 2(B)). The aggregated BiVO4 particles of the Composite-Imp became crystalline plate particles with a micrometer size after stirring in an aqueous nitric acid solution for 5 days to give the Composite-Imp-AT (Fig. 2(C)). It was due to the dissolution–reprecipitation process of the BiVO4 particles. BiVO4 of the Composite-LSR was a single-crystal-like polyhedral particle reflecting the crystal structure of the s-m phase (Fig. 2(D)). Importantly, Ru/SrTiO3:Rh particles were partly wrapped with the single-crystal-like BiVO4 particles (Fig. 2(E)), giving a large interfacial area and good contact between the Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 particles. Thus, the composite of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 with suitable contact was successfully obtained by facile methods.

Photocatalytic water splitting

Table 1 shows water splitting under visible light irradiation using the BiVO4–Ru/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) composite Z-scheme photocatalysts prepared by several methods. All composites showed photocatalytic activities (entries 1–11). The activity strongly depended on the preparation method (entries 4, 6 and 8) and the ratio of BiVO4 to Ru/SrTiO3:Rh (entries 1–5, 7, 8, 10 and 11). The Composite-Imp-AT (entry 6) showed a higher activity than the Composite-Imp (entry 4). The acid-treatment of stirring in the aqueous nitric acid solution improved the crystallinity of BiVO4. Therefore, the recombination probability of photogenerated electrons and holes was suppressed, resulting in an increase in the activity of BiVO4. Such improvement of photocatalytic activity via acid-treatment has been seen in the case of flame-made BiVO4.42 The composite photocatalyst prepared by a liquid–solid state reaction (Composite-LSR) showed the highest photocatalytic activity (entry 8) among the composites. This was due to further improvement of the crystallinity of BiVO4 and better contact as observed in Fig. 2(D) and (E). We also checked the Composite-LSR after photocatalytic water splitting by SEM (Fig. 2(F)). BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh remained as a stable composite. These results indicate that the BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh particles in the composite stayed together even under neutral pH conditions, resulting in an efficient electron transfer between the Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 particles. Entries 1–5, 7, 8, 10 and 11 in Table 1 show the dependence of photocatalytic activity on the ratio of BiVO4 to Ru/SrTiO3:Rh. The highest activity was obtained when the ratio was 2.5 in weight (the molar ratio of BiVO4 to SrTiO3:Rh was about 1.4:1) for both preparation methods. This dependence on the ratio was probably due to the balance of the amount of contact area between the Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and the BiVO4 particles and the number of photons absorbed by each photocatalyst. For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of the Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) powder and Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) physically mixed with BiVO4 powder (physical mixture) was also examined. Photocatalytic water splitting did not proceed using Ru/SrTiO3:Rh without BiVO4 (entry 12).13 In the presence of BiVO4, H2 and O2 evolved from water (entries 13 and 14). It is reported that the activity under neutral pH conditions is lower than that under acidic conditions because of poor contact between the SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 particles for the sample of the physical mixture.35 Therefore, we examined the effect of heat-treatment in air for the sample of the physical mixture, because the heat-treatment would have given a good contact between the BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh in the physical mixture (entries 15 and 16). However, the activity was decreased by the heat-treatment. This result is mainly due to the degradation of cocatalysts, because the activity of the physical mixture of non-heat-treated BiVO4 and heat-treated Ru/SrTiO3:Rh (entry 16) was quite low. We have also examined the effect of heat-treatment in air for the sample of Composite-LSR showing the highest activity (entry 9). The activity was also decreased by the heat-treatment. This result is the same as that of the heat-treated physical mixture.

The photocatalytic activity for water splitting using the present composite (Composite-LSR) under visible light irradiation depended on the pH of the aqueous solution as shown in Fig. 3. The highest and most stable activity was obtained under neutral pH conditions (Fig. S4†). This pH dependence was different from that of a mixture of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 powder (physical mixture),35 showing its highest activity at pH 3.5. As mentioned above, acidic pH conditions were required for the physical mixture to gain favorable contact by aggregation. In contrast, since the composites originally possessed suitable contact between BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh particles for electron transfer, they showed water splitting activity under a wide range of pH conditions. We measured the effects of pH on sacrificial H2 and O2 evolution over Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4, to see whether the change in photocatalytic activity shown in Fig. 3 was due to the pH or the ionic concentration in the aqueous solution (Table S1†). As the pH increased, the activities of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 increased and decreased, respectively. Moreover, BiVO4 dissolved in basic conditions above pH 10. As the balance between the positive and negative effects of pH, the optimum pH 7 was obtained. We also examined the effects of the addition of an electrolyte such as K2SO4. The activity in an aqueous K2SO4 solution at pH 7 was comparable with that in pure water. This result indicates the negligible effect of an electrolyte on the activity in the present photocatalyst system. Therefore, it is concluded that the decrease in the activity under acidic and basic conditions was not due to the presence of the electrolyte but due to pH.
 Fig. 3  Dependence of the photocatalytic activity of the BiVO4(250 wt%)-Ru(0.7 wt%)/SrTiO3:Rh(1%) composite (Composite-LSR) Z-scheme photocatalyst on pH adjusted with H2SO4 and KOH. Catalyst: 0.3 g; light source: 300 W Xe-arc lamp with a cold mirror and a cut-off filter (420 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm). 

Fig. 4 shows an action spectrum for water splitting using the composite photocatalyst. The diffuse reflection spectrum of the composite photocatalyst agreed with the sum of the diffuse reflection spectra of BiVO4 (Fig. S5(B)†) and SrTiO3:Rh(1%) (Fig. S5(C)†) powders. SrTiO3:Rh(1%) (Fig. S5(C)†) possessed two visible-light absorption band edges around 520 nm and 700 nm due to the existence of Rh3+ and Rh4+. In order to reduce Rh4+ to Rh3+, H2-reduction treatment was carried out at 673 K. The absorption band with the edge around 700 nm disappeared and the absorption band with the edge around 520 nm increased after the H2-reduction treatment (Fig. S5(D)†). It has been confirmed that the visible-light absorption band with the edge around 520 nm is due to electronic transitions from electron-donor levels consisting of Rh3+ to a conduction band of SrTiO3, while that with the edge around 700 nm is assigned to transitions from a valence band of SrTiO3 to acceptor levels consisting of Rh4+.13,43 The present composite responded to 520 nm for water splitting. This onset of the action spectrum agreed well with those of the absorption edges of H2-reduced Ru/SrTiO3:Rh (Fig. S5(D)†) and BiVO4 (Fig. S5(B)†). This result indicated that the photocatalytic water splitting proceeded by the energy gap transition of BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh particles. This result accorded well with Z-scheme systems of (Pt/SrTiO3:Rh)-(BiVO4)-(Fe3+/2+) and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh–BiVO4 driven by IPET.29–32,35 The apparent quantum yield of the BiVO4–Ru/SrTiO3:Rh composite photocatalyst was 1.6% at 420 nm.

The Composite-LSR was experimentally confirmed to show solar water splitting activity using AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) at ambient temperature and pressure (298 K, 1 atm), as shown in Fig. 5. The composite photocatalyst steadily produced H2 and O2 at the ratio of 2:1 in stoichiometric amounts. When 1 m2 of the irradiated area was assumed, the rates of H2 and O2 production were 100 and 48 mL h−1, respectively. The solar energy conversion efficiency of the system was determined to be 0.03%.

The activity of the BiVO4–Ru/SrTiO3:Rh composite photocatalyst developed by the present work was compared with those of previously-reported Z-scheme photocatalyst systems consisting of BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh as shown in Table 2.29–35 The Z-scheme photocatalyst system that employed a Fe3+/Fe2+ electron mediator29–32 (entries 1 and 2) showed a high activity for water splitting by using an aqueous sulfuric acid adjusted to pH 2.4. However, Fe3+ ions are hydrolyzed to form a precipitate under neutral pH conditions, and lose their function as an electron mediator. The Z-scheme photocatalyst systems employing [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ or [Co(phen)3]3+/2+ as an electron mediator33 (entries 3 and 4) showed a high activity for water splitting under neutral pH conditions. Although the Z-scheme photocatalyst system employing PRGO as a solid electron mediator34 (entries 5 and 6) and the IPET type Z-scheme photocatalyst system35 (entries 7 and 8) showed high activities for water splitting by using an aqueous sulfuric acid solution adjusted to pH 3.5, the photocatalytic water splitting barely proceeded without additives for pH adjustment. In contrast, the present composite photocatalyst can split pure water efficiently without any additives (entry 9). Thus, we successfully constructed a simple solar water splitting system consisting only of the powdered metal oxide photocatalyst, pure water and sunlight.

Conclusions
We have successfully constructed a unique and simple BiVO4–Ru/SrTiO3:Rh composite Z-scheme photocatalyst with activity for water splitting under visible light and simulated sunlight irradiation. The present composite photocatalyst showed a higher activity than a mixture of BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh powder under neutral pH conditions, because a suitable contact was made between BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh in the composite resulting in efficient electron transfer. Moreover, the composite photocatalyst prepared by a liquid–solid state reaction as a soft process showed the highest activity for water splitting because of the formation of well-crystallized BiVO4 single-crystal-like particles. The composite photocatalyst showed activity for solar water splitting at ambient temperature and pressure.
