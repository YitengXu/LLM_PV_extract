    , Accepted 15th February 2021First published on 19th February 2021AbstractPseudocapacitors (PCs) have attracted research interest not only due to their superior performance in energy storage devices, but also to bridge the performance gap between batteries and electrostatic double-layer capacitors. Nevertheless, the storage of charges within PCs greatly depends on the electrode materials. Recent studies have found redox organic materials to be highly advantageous over conventional inorganic electrode materials due to their improved cycling stability augmented with electrochemical reversibility. In this work, we report a new organic electrode material, i.e., 2-((3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)amino)naphthalene-1,4-dione (NQ-DP) composed of core naphthoquinone (NQ) and functionalised on the periphery with a dopamine (DP) neurotransmitter subunit. Following the fabrication of the electrode on toray carbon paper (CP), NQ-DP/CP displayed efficient pseudocapacitor performance for the three-electrode system with a very good specific capacitance of 177.9 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 measured with cyclic voltammetry (CV), and 160.8 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 measured using galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) studies. Moreover, symmetric and asymmetric two electrode devices were fabricated using NQ-DP/CP electrode materials, which displayed a good specific capacitance of 43.4 F g−1 and 65.9 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 (GCD), respectively. NQ-DP/CP devices demonstrate an excellent capacitance retention percentage of >90% for over 5000 continuous charge–discharge cycles. Importantly, the NQ-DP/CP electrode displays an energy density of 6.0 W h kg−1 and 2.6 W h kg−1 at power densities of 0.6 kW kg−1 and 6.3 kW kg−1, respectively, in the symmetric cell combination. Energy densities of 9.0 W h kg−1 and 5.5 W h kg−1 were obtained at power densities of 1.0 kW kg−1 and 7.4 kW kg−1, respectively, in the asymmetric cell combination. Overall, the organic electrode architecture design and synthesis based on NQ and DP results in an outstanding pseudocapacitor energy storage device performance, and may open new routes for the production of high performance supercapacitors in the future.
Introduction
Humanity is facing a great challenge in terms of the ongoing energy crises with respect to the depletion of non-renewable energy resources, and the fossil fuel combustion-associated problems of degrading air quality and global warming-induced climate change. This has accelerated the research efforts in exploring alternative carbon-free energy technologies in terms of cleaner energy generation and efficient energy storage. At the epitome of a clean and renewable energy resource is the wind and solar energy.1 However, harnessing this energy efficiently is a challenge in itself, as it needs the development of novel smart materials capable of energy production, supply and storage.2 Therefore, extensive research in novel materials, driven by such need-based technology for clean and efficient energy storage and supply in particular, is being conducted globally. A number of technologies for energy storage devices, such as fuel cells, batteries and supercapacitors, have been developed so far.3 Among these electrical energy storage (EES) devices, batteries have been extensively used for various scales in meeting modern energy demand.4–6 However, battery technology suffers from limitations, such as low power density, heat generation and limited cycle life, and thus lags behind in meeting the ever-increasing energy demands of society.7,8 This indicates that battery technology alone is unable to furnish the demand for the storage of produced electricity.9 To overcome these shortcomings, next-generation electricity storage devices with high energy/power density performance need to be developed. Innovative energy storage systems based on sustainable material is in demand not only for society and industries, but also for military requirements.10 In this context, supercapacitors (SCs) exhibit outstanding power density and are promising candidates in charge storage devices. SCs (ultracapacitors or electrochemical capacitors) are poised to play a key role in our future energy storage demand and applications, as they are easy to operate, exhibit a facile charge storage mechanism, renders a long cycle life, excellent dynamic response, generate less thermochemical heat, short charge/discharge time and are easy to integrate into electronics.11–13 In recent times, SCs have been widely utilized in electronic devices, military applications, memory devices and industrial power, as well as energy management.14–16 The SCs charge storage mechanism are based on either the electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) or faradaic storage of charges, such as pseudocapacitance.17,18 Pseudocapacitors (PCs) involve the rapid faradaic redox reaction process at the electrode surface-level, and display higher power densities similar to batteries.19–23 The electrochemical performance of PCs depend on the composition and effective area of electrode materials, and the interaction of the electrolyte and electrode materials.24–26 Therefore, the development of novel materials for PSCs with high capacitance performance is the goal of researchers.27–30 PSCs made up of inorganic solids, such as transition metal oxides, and conducting polymers (such as polyacetylene, polyphenylamine, polymethylene and carbon nanomaterials), have received a significant amount of attention and exhibit high performance.31–36 Among them, carbon nanotubes are extensively employed as electrode materials in the SCs device fabrication because of their high surface area and electron mobility.37,38 It is encountered that a few of these materials display restricted applications because of their complex structure, poor dispersibility and recyclability. To overcome these limitations, redox-active organic materials are attracting the attention of researchers because of their availability, diverse molecular architecture, lower adverse environmental impact, and easy processing conditions.39–42 In order to design and develop new organic electrode materials, the organic compounds need to display both electron-donating and electron-accepting characteristics to fabricate the PSCs device with high capacitance, excellent energy/power density and good cycling stability.43–45 Thus, in this regards, 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ) has been utilized as an electrode material in energy storage applications.46,47 NQs exhibit redox-active characteristics, and are explored in electrochemical applications. NQ is capable of storing two protons and two electrons in its molecular architecture during the reversible redox reaction process.48 Recent studies have demonstrated that NQ, in combination with metal–oxide and carbon nanotubes, and with the modification of the graphene surface, has also been employed as novel supercapacitor materials for energy storage application in SCs.49–51 Interestingly, there are very rare examples for the chemical functionalization of NQs and their application in PSCs. A literature search revealed that the neurotransmitter dopamine (DP) is efficiently utilized in Li-ion batteries.52,53 Moreover, the DP unit can be polymerized in basic medium, and employed in nanostructure-based SCs.54–57 We recently demonstrated that the neurotransmitter dopamine (DP) could be utilized as a new subunit to modify the molecular architecture of the organic building block for the construction of novel electrode materials, displaying efficient energy storage properties.58 Despite the application of NQ in PSC devices, the direct covalent modification of NQ with DP and its impact on energy storage PSCs have not been explored.
Herein, for the first time, we functionalize NQ covalently with DP and construct new electrode materials for pseudocapacitor applications. The covalent functionalization of NQ with DP could offer an electrode material surface, where the faradaic redox-reaction process takes place by involving four protons and four electrons. This might facilitate the fast redox-reaction and enhance the capacitance of the supercapacitor materials. We demonstrated that the NQ-DP/CP electrode in PSC exhibited high electrochemical properties, such as a specific capacitance of 177.9 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (CV) and 160.8 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 (GCD) with good power and energy density values. Our finding demonstrates the NQ-bearing DP as a stable and renewable supercapacitor material for efficient energy/power storage devices.
Results and discussion
Design and synthesis
In order to investigate the pseudocapacitor performance based on the organic molecular architecture, we designed the compound, namely 2-((3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)amino)naphthalene-1,4-dione NQ-DP (Fig. 1). Our molecular design strategy allows us to modify NQ at its core with DP. This modification resulted in significant changes into faradaic redox reactions at the electrode surface, resulting in the enhancement of the pseudocapacitor device performance.

The synthesis of NQ-DP was achieved in a single step by reacting NQ with DP in the presence of sodium acetate in ethanol at room temperature. The NQ-DP structural conformation (Fig. 1) was evaluated by employing modern techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR, 13C NMR) spectroscopies and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).
Redox properties
Cyclic voltammetry experiments for NQ-DP were performed to determine the onset reduction (Eonsetred) and onset oxidation (Eonsetox) potentials. The CV measurement was performed in an acetonitrile solvent system with and without ferrocene/ferrocenium ion as an internal standard. 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate acetonitrile (n-Bu4NPF6) was utilized as the electrolyte. The CV measurements were performed in the potential range from −2.0 to 2.0 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. A three-electrode system was used, wherein the 3 mm glassy carbon served as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl(satKCl) as the reference electrode, and Pt wire as the counter electrode, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 2A and B, respectively. The first onset oxidation and reduction potential for NQ-DP were observed as 0.67 V and −0.55 V, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were evaluated by using the equations,

HOMO = − e (4.4 + Eonsetox) and LUMO = − e (4.4 + Eonsetred), and are −5.07 and −3.85 eV, respectively. The band gap of NQ-DP was calculated electrochemically, and was found to be 1.22 eV.59
The redox characteristics of NQ-DP over the very wide potential window from −2.0 to 2.0 V suggested that the NQ-DP based electrode materials are potentially suitable for pseudocapacitor applications. To examine the electrochemical performance, several electrochemical techniques have been employed, such as CV, GCD and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). These electrochemical techniques are used to evaluate important parameters, such as current, voltage and time. Along with this, other metrics, such as specific capacitance (CS), operating voltage (Vo) and solution resistance (RS), were utilized to measure the power performance of PSCs. The three and two-electrode device configurations were both used to determine the precise specific capacitance for the PSC materials.
Electrochemical measurement of the NQ-DP-toray carbon paper electrode
The electrochemical behaviour of the NQ-DP/CP electrode material was first investigated in the three-electrode cell setup. The electrode of NQ-DP was prepared on 1 cm2 of the toray carbon paper TGP-H-60. The electrochemical properties of the newly fabricated electrode NQ-DP/CP were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) with platinum as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl(satKCl) as the reference electrode in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte at room temperature. The electrode fabrication procedure can be found in the experimental part. Fig. 3A illustrates the CV of the as-prepared electrode materials evaluated under a potential range of −0.2 to 1.0 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The CV curve of the Toray Carbon Paper was rectangular in shape, indicating that the CP exhibits charge storage capability via electrical double layer capacitance (EDLC) (Fig. 3A, red line).60 It was observed that CP does not show any faradaic redox reactions at the surface level, whereas the NQ-DP/CP displayed redox peaks at around 0.17 V (oxidative peak potential) and 0.53 V (reductive peak potential) (Fig. 3A, blue line). These faradaic redox-peaks are assigned to the pseudocapacitive characteristics of the NQ-DP/CP electrode materials. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, the NQ-DP/CP electrode materials in PSC displayed a significantly higher area under the CV curve (measure of the capacitance of the electrode materials), exhibiting the highest capacitance. Moreover, the CVs of the NQ-DP/CP electrode measured at different scan rates are depicted in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The NQ-DP/CP electrode material exhibited a broad reversible peak. The shape of the CV peak is neither a purely faradaic redox peak, nor a rectangular EDLC peak.61,62 The enhancement in the peak current with increasing scan rate is attributed to the capacitive behavior of the NQ-DP/CP electrode. It is also observed that the switching current (at the beginning and end of the CV curves, see Fig. S7, ESI†) values are higher at higher scan rates, which tend towards zero as the scan rate decreases. This is possibly due to the polarization of the NQ-DP/CP surface at higher scanning rates.63 Moreover, as the scan rate increases, the reductive and oxidative peaks shift to lower negative and higher positive potentials, respectively. This behavior of the CV at high scan rates became relatively more resistive as the electrolyte ion has a very short time for the adsorption on the electrode surface-layer. However, the CV shapes did not change, suggesting that the NQ-DP/CP electrode material can undergo fast faradaic redox-reactions and electrolyte ion diffusion.

(C) Cycling stability from GCD analysis calculated at the current density of 4 A g−1 for NQ-DP/CP, and (D) Nyquist plot of NQ-DP/CP at the open circuit potential obtained in a three-electrode system. 
The specific capacitance of the NQ-DP/CP electrode material from the three-electrode CV studies was estimated by employing the following eqn (1):64 (1)where Csp is the specific capacitance (F g−1), I is the response current (A), v is the scan rate (mV s−1), m is the average mass of the electrode active material (g), and ΔV is the voltage window (V).
The CVs at different scan rates were used to calculate the specific capacitance of the NQ-DP/CP electrode material, as shown in Fig. S7 of ESI,† and the estimated results are depicted in Table 1. The evaluated specific capacitance from the CV measurements at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 was the highest with a specific capacitance value of 177.9 F g−1. The result showed that the chemical functionalization of NQ with DP leads to a faster response of the electrodes to the applied potential. The redox reactions at the electrode surface are a proton-coupled electron transfer process. As illustrated in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and briefed in Table 1, this result clearly illustrates how the specific capacitance decreases with an increase in the scan rates from 5 to 500 mV s−1 and is attributed to the uncompensated resistance. This decrease in the specific capacitance value is due to the fast electrolyte ion diffusion, which spends very little time on the electrode surface-layer.

GCD tests were employed to evaluate the specific capacitance of the NQ-DP/CP electrode material in the three-electrode pseudocapacitor set-up. The GCD curves of the NQ-DP/CP electrode materials at various current densities are shown in Fig. 3B and the results are summarized in Table 1. The GCD measurements are complemented by the results obtained from CV experiments, indicating the charge storage characteristics of the electrodes. The GCD curves are asymmetric in nature, which correspond to the reversible redox reaction suggesting the pseudocapacitive behavior of the NQ-DP/CP electrode. The GCD characterization was executed in the potential window of −0.2 to 1 V, and the capacitance (Csp) of NQ-DP/CP was estimated from the GCD curves at various current densities by using eqn (2):65,66 (2)where I is the response current (A), Δt is the discharge cycle time (s), m is the mass of the active electrode material (g), and ΔV is the voltage window (V) and Csp is the specific capacitance in F g−1.
The specific capacitance of NQ-DP/CP in a three-electrode system estimated by GCD at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 was found to be 160.8 F g−1. The specific capacitance measured for NQ-DP/CP at 0.5 A g−1 (160. 8 F g−1) is highest among the tested electrode system from 0.5 A g−1 to 5 A g−1 (Table 1). The highest energy storage capability of the NQ-DP/CP electrode material at 0.5 A g−1 can be attributed to the following factors: optimal electrode material grafted on the carbon paper that allows for fast and efficient charge transport. This results in rapid electrochemical redox reactions, which enhances the conductivity of the as-prepared sample. This complete process in the PSC cell leads to the increase in the energy storage performance of the NQ-DP/CP electrode material, whereas an increase in the current density to 5 A g−1 resulted in a decrease in the specific capacitance due to the rapid diffusion of the electrolyte ions. Fig. 3C displays the PSC cycling stability from the GCD measurements estimated at the current density of 4 A g−1 for the NQ-DP/CP electrode material for over 5000 continuous charge–discharge cycles. The device could retain almost 98% of the initial specific capacitance value, demonstrating its excellent energy storage capacity.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the electrode–electrolyte interfacial process at the electrode surface based on the distinct regions of the Nyquist plot. The charge transfer processes can be explained from a Nyquist plot based on the high frequency semicircle and a low frequency straight line that are usually observed. The intercept of the semicircle region to the real axis depicts the solution resistance (Rs), while the diameter of the semicircle is associated with the charge-transfer resistance (Rct).67,68 The EIS measurements of the NQ-DP/CP-based PSC devices were conducted at a potential amplitude of 10 mV between 1 mHz to 1 MHz. The Nyquist plot acquired for the PSC device is presented in Fig. 3D. The EIS characterisation was conducted at an open circuit potential, and the value 2.7 Ω as the solution resistance was observed for the NQ-DP/CP electrode. No semicircle-like nature was observed in the Nyquist plot, which indicated the minimum charge-transfer resistance in the NQ-DP/CP electrode. The comparison of the Nyquist plot with bare carbon paper (CP) is presented in Fig. S8 in ESI.† The bare CP electrode showed a Rs value of 5.4 Ω, which was twice that of the NQ-DP/CP electrode. The lower Rs value of NQ-DP/CP represents the improved conductivity of the electrode surface.
IR spectral measurements and FESEM analysis were employed to determine the stability of the electrode materials and also PSC performance, and the results are shown in Fig. 4A and B, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, the –OH and –NH functional groups display IR bands at 3475 cm−1 and 3330 cm−1, respectively. The carbonyl functional group of NQ exhibited a band at 1670 cm−1, whereas the –CO group next to –NH of DP appeared at 1602 cm−1. The IR peak at 1512 cm−1 corresponds to the CC subunit. The bands at 1248 cm−1 and 723 cm−1 correspond to C–N stretching and C–H bending, respectively. In contrast, CP is the toray carbon, which does not exhibit any characteristic peaks in the IR region (Fig. S6, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  (A) IR spectrum and (B) FESEM micrographs of the NQ-DP/CP electrodes before and after 5000 GCD cycles. 
The similarities in the IR spectral results before and after 5000 GCD cycles indicate the excellent stability of the NQ-DP/CP electrodes. This was further supported using FESEM analysis, which revealed a flake-like morphology of the NQ-DP/CP electrode that was largely retained even after 5000 continuous GCD cycles, as shown in Fig. 4B. The retention of the morphological aspects even after vigorous electrochemical testing could be responsible for the high capacitance retention of 98% observed for the NQ-DP/CP electrodes.
These three-electrode set-up electrochemical properties evaluated by the CV, GCD, EIS and cycle stability results indicated the excellent potential of NQ-DP/CP for electrochemical supercapacitor devices. Therefore, the full cell prototype OSC device performance was investigated by fabricating a two-electrode solid state symmetric, as well as asymmetric capacitor cell, based on the NQ-DP/CP electrode materials. It was found that such a prototype two-electrode cell was one of the best performing small molecular architectures in terms of the specific capacitance.
Two electrode solid-state symmetric capacitor studies
A two-electrode all-solid state symmetric cell setup was prepared by utilizing the NQ-DP/CP electrode materials to estimate the specific capacitance for the PSC device prototype (see for details on the electrode and cell fabrication). CV, galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance tests were employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the two-electrode solid-state symmetric cell prototype. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, the CV of the PSC prototype employing NQ-DP/CP electrodes in the potential range of 0 to 1.2 V at variable scanning rates from 5 to 500 mV s−1 were recorded. The CV behavior was of typical (quasi-) rectangular box-like shape,69 which was characteristic of the symmetric device constructed using two similar electrodes. The following eqn (3) was utilized to evaluate the specific capacitance Csp from the two-electrode solid-state symmetric PSC from the CVs shown in Fig. 5A, and is summarized in Table 2. (3)Csp is the specific capacitance of the two-electrode set-up, I refers to the response current (A), m is the average mass (g) of the electroactive materials, v is the scan rate (mV s−1), and ΔV is the voltage window (V).70,71

At the low scan rate of 5 mV s−1, the specific capacitance estimated for NQ-DP/CP was 50.4 F g−1 in the potential window ranging from 0 to 1.2 V (Fig. 5A and Table 2, entry 1). In the same potential window, as the scan rate increased from 5 mV s−1 (50.4 F g−1) to 500 mV s−1 (11.5 F g−1), the specific capacitance of NQ-DP/CP decreases (Table 2). It was observed that the CV retained the same rectangular shape with 20% efficiency of Csp for the prototype cell at high scan rate too. The calculated specific capacitance value for NQ-DP/CP from CV measurements suggests that the electrodes in the higher scan rate system become more resistive due to the rapid electrolyte ion diffusion to and from the interface.
To further evaluate the specific capacitance of the two-electrode solid-state symmetric prototype performance, GCD analysis was used. The GCD curves of the NQ-DP/CP electrode material at different current densities in the potential window ranging from 0 to 1.2 V are depicted in Fig. 5B. The potential window depicted in Fig. 5B complement the CV results. The asymmetric shape of the GCD curves of the NQ-DP/CP exhibits a slight deviation from the symmetric ideal triangular shape. The asymmetric shapes are attributed to the pseudocapacitive behavior with the fast faradaic reactions at the NQ-DP/CP electrode surface-layer. GCD tests at various current densities (Fig. 5B) of NQ-DP/CP were employed to calculate the specific capacitance, following eqn (4):65,71 (4)where Csp is the specific capacitance (F g−1) of the two-electrode solid-state symmetric system, I is the response current (A), m is the average mass of the active electrode material (g), Δt is the discharge time (s), and ΔV is the voltage window (V).
The estimated specific capacitance values are summarized in Table 2. The specific capacitance of the NQ-DP/CP electrode material was determined to be 43.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density with the potential window from 0 to 1.2 V. Fig. 5B shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles at variable current densities. The two-electrode specific capacitance solid-state symmetric device shows decreasing specific capacitance with increasing current densities. The specific capacitance value calculated from the GCD curve at 5 A g−1 was 18.8 F g−1. Thus, at the increased current density of 5 A g−1, the NQ-DP/CP electrode material could retain 40% of the specific capacitance compared to the measured value at 0.5 A g−1. Such PSC capability with the NQ-DP/CP electrode material is ascribed to the restricted ion diffusion incurred by the system. Furthermore, the cycling stability of the two-electrode solid-state system was estimated from GCD analysis, employing cycling experiments by recording 5000 continuous charge discharge cycles at the current density of 4 A g−1. The result of the cycling stability is presented in Fig. 5C. Exceptional capacitance retention percentages of 92% for over 5000 continuous charge–discharge cycles were attained by the NQ-DP/CP electrodes in the two-electrode device configurations. The EIS studies were performed at a potential amplitude of 10 mV between 1 mHz to 1 MHz at the open circuit potential, and are illustrated in Fig. 5D. The solution resistance values of 5.7 Ω were observed from the two-electrode solid-state symmetric systems. No semicircle-like nature was observed in the Nyquist plots, which shows the minimum charge transfer in the NQ-DP/CP electrodes. The higher value of solution resistance observed in the symmetric supercapacitor device (Fig. 5D) in comparison to the three electrode system (Fig. 3D) is due to the resistance offered by the solid electrolyte.
Two-electrode solid-state asymmetric capacitor studies
The supercapacitor performance of the NQ-DP/CP electrode was also evaluated in a two-electrode all-solid state asymmetric cell setup (see electrode and cell fabrication section). CV, GCD and EIS studies were employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the two-electrode solid-state asymmetric cell prototype.
The asymmetric supercapacitor device (ASC) was assembled by employing NQ-DP/CP and Active carbon (AC)/CP as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The voltage window of the ASC device was effectively extended to 1.7 V, while avoiding excess polarization, as shown in Fig. S9 of ESI.†Fig. 6A shows an overlay of the scan rate-dependent CVs recorded from 5 to 500 mV s−1, while Fig. 6B shows an overlay of the current density-dependent GCD curves measured from 0.5 to 5 A g−1. The specific capacitance thus obtained from the CV and GCD studies have been tabulated in Table 3. From the CV studies, the highest specific capacitance of 88.9 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 was observed. From the GCD studies, the highest specific capacitance of 65.9 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 was obtained, which decreased to 35.8 F g−1 when the current density was increased to 5 A g−1, indicating a capacitance retention of 54% for the ASC device. The cycling stability tests were performed by recording 5000 continuous charge discharge cycles at a current density of 4 A g−1, which revealed the excellent stability of the ASC device with an excellent capacitance retention percentage of 95% (see Fig. 6C). The EIS studies were performed at an potential amplitude of 10 mV between 1 mHz to 1 MHz at an open circuit potential, and are illustrated in Fig. 6D. A solution resistance value of 7.1 Ω and a charge transfer resistance value of 8.3 Ω were obtained for the ASC device. The higher values of Rs and Rct in comparison to the three-electrode system are a cumulative effect of the resistance offered by the solid electrolyte and active carbon used for the device fabrication.

Impact of different electrochemical cell systems on Csp
It has been reported that the specific capacitance value for the pseudocapacitor electrode material strongly depends on the cell fabrication.21,71 The NQ-DP/CP electrode material was utilized for the construction of three-electrode and two-electrode cell configurations. The estimated specific capacitance values from CV and GCD are shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3, in three and also two-electrode systems. The evaluated Csp values for the three- and two-electrode systems clearly demonstrate a marked difference. In the case of the three-electrode set-up, extremely high values of 177.9 F g−1 (CV) and 160.8 F g−1 (GCD) were found. The two-electrode solid-state symmetric and asymmetric cell set-up showed relatively smaller Csp values of 50.4 F g−1 (CV), 43.4 F g−1 (GCD) and 88.9 F g−1 (CV), 65.9 F g−1 (GCD), respectively. It indicates the fact that only two-electrode solid-state devices allow for practical estimation electrochemical performance in PSCs. Thus, the Csp values calculated in the two-electrode system from the GCD tests is more close to the practical work of the capacitors.
Power/energy densities of the symmetric and asymmetric OSC devices
Power/energy density is a crucial parameter to estimate the end applications for both energy storage and conversion systems. Power density (P) normally evaluated by gravimetric (W kg−1) or volumetric (W L−1) methods are utilized to demonstrate the efficiency in the energy uptake/delivery, whereas the energy density (E) is utilized to describe the amount of electricity stored or delivered. GCD analysis of the two-electrode solid-state device was employed to evaluate the power performance of the PSC device using the following eqn (5):66,70 (5)The energy density was calculated from the two-electrode GCD analysis using the following eqn (6):70,71 (6)where C represents the specific capacitance (F g−1), Δt represents the discharge time (s), ΔV represents the voltage window (V), E represents the energy density (W h kg−1) and P represents the power density (W kg−1).
The Ragone plot was utilized to evaluate the performance of the PSC devices by plotting the power density vs. energy density, and is shown in Fig. 7. The two-electrode solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device based on the NQ-DP/CP electrode material exhibits the energy densities of 6.0 W h kg−1 and 2.6 W h kg−1 at power densities of 0.6 kW kg−1 and 6.3 kW kg−1, respectively. The two-electrode solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibited the energy densities of 9.0 W h kg−1 and 6.1 W h kg−1 at power densities of 1.0 kW kg−1 and 7.4 kW kg−1, respectively. The volumetric energy and power densities were also estimated for the two devices (refer to Fig. S10 in ESI†). The symmetric device demonstrated volumetric energy densities of 3.4 and 1.3 W h L−1 at volumetric power densities of 0.3 and 3.5 kW L−1, respectively. The asymmetric device demonstrated volumetric energy densities of 7.5 and 4.6 W h L−1 at volumetric power densities of 0.6 and 4.2 kW L−1, respectively. The results demonstrated using CV, GCD and EIS for the three-electrode and two-electrode systems suggested that the NQ-DP/CP electrode material has good energy density, recyclability and potential for use in real world applications.

Redox mechanism of electrode materials
The pseudocapacitive behavior of the NQ-DP/CP electrode material resulted from the faradaic redox reaction. The reversible electrochemical redox reaction of the organic molecular architecture NQ-DP in H2SO4 (1 M) electrolyte is as shown in Fig. 3A. The NQ core of the molecule gets protonated in the presence of H+ ions. The obtained protonated NQ-DP subunit further undergoes the corresponding redox reaction, resulting in quinone moieties (Fig. 8). The complete redox reaction process involves a four-electron system, and is responsible for the high specific capacitance in OSC.
 Fig. 8  Schematic presentation for the proposed plausible reversible redox reaction mechanism of NQ-DP. 
Finally, we compare the results obtained for the NQ-DP/CP-based PSC device with the literature reports on the electrochemical performance of naphthoquinone, as well as the dopamine systems, as summarized in Table 4. The PSC results obtained for the NQ-DP/CP set-up is a competitive one.

Synthesis of 2-((3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)amino)naphthalene-1,4-dione (NQ-DP)

  A 25 mL round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar was charged with 1,4-naphthaquinone 1(NQ) (0.500 g, 3.16 mmol), dopamine hydrochloride 2(DP) (0.719 g, 3.79 mmol) and 10 mL of ethanol. After that reaction mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature, sodium acetate (0.025 g, 0.316 mmol) was then added. The resulting dark red reaction mixture was stirred and refluxed for 24 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored using TLC. After completion of the starting material, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool at room temperature and poured into cold water. The precipitate was washed sequentially with water and ethanol. The light orange product was dried overnight at 100 °C to yield pure 3(NQ-DP) (0.601 g; 61.57%).

Cyclic voltammetry experiments for the energy band gap estimation. 
The CV measurements were performed by using the following conditions on a CHI-660 E series potentiostat.
Electrolyte: 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate–acetonitrile.
Working electrode: 3 mm glassy carbon electrode.
Reference electrode: Ag/AgCl(sat KCl).
Counter electrode: Pt wire.
Internal standard: Ferrocene.
Scan rate: 10 mV s−1.
Note: The solution was purged with nitrogen gas before analysis.


Electrode preparation. 
In order to fabricate the working electrodes, NQ-DP was taken an as active material, acetylene black as a conductive agent and poly(vinylidine fluoride) as a binder. The three components were thoroughly ground in the weight ratios of 70:20:10 (14:4:2 mg). 10 mg was taken from the finely ground mixture and dispersed in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent, and sonicated for 1 h to get a homogenous slurry. 0.05 mL of this slurry was drop-casted on a Toray carbon paper TGP-H-60 with dimension of 1 × 1 cm2. The electrode was then dried in an oven at 100 °C for 6 h. The performance of the electrode was studied in a three-electrode cell configuration, wherein the prepared electrode acts as a working electrode, and platinum and Ag/AgCl(satKCl) act as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, in 1 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte. The current collectors fabricated using the same procedure were used for the solid-state device fabrication studies as well. All of the tests were carried out at room temperature.


Solid-state symmetric device fabrication. 
The supercapacitor performance was analysed by fabricating a symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor device. The solid electrolyte was prepared by adding 1 g of polyvinyl alcohol in 8 mL of distilled water, followed by 2 mL of 1 M H2SO4 and stirred at 85 °C until a clear gel was obtained. This gel was saturated onto a Whatman glass microfiber separator. It was coated between two current collectors comprising the same active materials, and dried until the device was solidified.


Solid-state asymmetric device fabrication. 
The supercapacitor performance was also analysed by fabricating an asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor device. The solid electrolyte and the positive electrode were fabricated by using a similar methodology, as described above. The negative electrode was composed of active carbon (AC), and was fabricated by replacing the NQ-DP active component with AC. The electrolyte gel was saturated onto a Whatman glass microfiber separator, coated between the positive and negative electrodes, and dried until the device was solidified.

Conclusions
In summary, the dopamine-functionalized 1,4-naphthaquinone was successfully synthesized via simple experimental procedure in one step. The NQ-DP-based material was employed to construct a CP-based electrode. The electrochemical results for the three-electrode system with NQ-DP/CP material exhibits a high specific capacitance of 177.9 F g−1 (CV) and 160.8 F g−1 (GCD) at 5 mV s−1 scan rate and 0.5 A g−1 current density, respectively. In addition, the PSC device constituted by a two-electrode solid-state symmetric cell displayed the specific capacitance of 50.4 F g−1 (CV) at 5 mV s−1 scan rate, and 43.4 F g−1 (GCD) at 0.5 A g−1 current density. The two-electrode solid-state asymmetric cell displayed the specific capacitance of 88.9 F g−1 (CV) at 5 mV s−1 scan rate, and 65.9 F g−1 (GCD) at 0.5 A g−1 current density. The OSC symmetric and asymmetric devices achieved a high energy density of 6.0 W h kg−1 at power density of 0.6 kW kg−1 and energy density of 9.0 W h kg−1 at power density of 1.0 kW kg−1, respectively. An exceptional cycling stability of >90% was demonstrated by both OSC devices. These results suggest that the organic molecule-based NQ-DP/CP electrode material shows excellent performance, which demonstrated that the material has great potential to fabricate environmentally-friendly energy storage devices.
