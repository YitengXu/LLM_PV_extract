    , Accepted 23rd February 2022First published on 26th February 2022AbstractStrain engineering has been recognized as a critical strategy in modulating the optoelectronic properties of perovskite halide materials. Here, we demonstrate a self-powered, flexible photodetector based on CsPbBr3 thin films with controllable compressive or tensile strain of up to ±0.81%, which was produced in situ via a sequential two-step deposition on bent polymer substrates. The best photoresponsivity of ∼121.5 mA W−1 with a photocurrent of 5.15 μA was achieved at zero bias under a power intensity of 0.47 mW cm−2 for the maximum tensile strain of +0.81%, which corresponds to a ∼100.2% increase relative to that of the unstrained case. The in situ tensile strain adjusted the band alignments, making them favorable for enhanced charge transport and thus a higher photoresponse. The structural origin of this superlative balanced photodetection performance was systematically revealed to be associated with the distortion of coupled PbBr6 octahedra and the atomic displacement within the octahedron.

New concepts
Although there have been substantial efforts towards improving the performance of perovskite halide-based photodetectors, the true dependence and influence of lattice strain on the photodetection behavior have been very rarely reported in halide materials. Herein, we introduce an experimental method for modulating the lattice strain in situ over a practical compressive-to-tensile strain range in representative inorganic halide thin films of CsPbBr3 by using a photodetector platform with a self-powered, flexible, vertical structure on a polymer substrate. This study is the first to report a flexible photodetector based on inorganic halides, apart from the effects of in situ strain on photoresponse. The case of tensile strain resulted in substantial improvements in photoresponse, as being associated with the ideal band alignments with the contacting layers for effective charge transport. The structural origin of the photoresponse enhancement with tensile strain is also explored with the estimated changes in bond angles and bond lengths of the perovskite structure and their optical influences on the basis of experimental crystal information. The experimental approach for imposing the compressive or tensile lattice strain and the analytical outcomes concerning the strain-dependent changes in crystal structures are very unique compared to any related previous reports.

Introduction
Halide perovskite materials have been actively investigated for their potential application in photodetectors because of their advantageous properties, such as highly adjustable bandgap, strong optical absorption, low interfacial defect density, and low exciton binding energy.1–3 Recent research on halide-based photodetectors has focused particularly on improving the photodetection performance by targeting good responsivity, fast response speed, low power consumption, and high stability.4–6 Various halide materials have been investigated to achieve these targets, including methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), through the optimization of the fabrication process, compositional substitutions, and device structure.7–9 In particular, the all-inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) has been considered an ideal material for effective light absorption because of its remarkable optoelectronic properties, including its direct bandgap, high carrier mobility, and long carrier diffusion length, along with its excellent chemical stability.10–13 Inorganic perovskite halides for use in photodetectors have been studied in various forms, such as thin films, single crystals, microcrystals, and nanowires, considering that dimensional constraints and defects affect the mobility and lifetimes of the carriers generated by photo-absorption.
In particular, self-powered photodetectors based on a representative inorganic halide of CsPbBr3 have been studied using a merit of operation with no bias.14–18 As a popular choice of inducing the self-powered system, heterojunctions interfacing CsPbBr3 thin films with intermediate layers were used to produce asymmetric band alignments for effective charge transport under no external bias. For example, a self-powered photodetector structure of Au/TiO2/CsPbBr3/Al2O3/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) resulted in a photocurrent Iph of 3 μA and a photoresponsivity R of 20 mA W−1 at the applied light intensity P of 0.001 mW cm−2.14 In the case of Au:Ti/ZnO/CsPbBr3/GaN/Ni:Au, a high R of ∼44 mA W−1 was achieved with Iph of 1 μA at a low P of 0.29 mW cm−2.17 Because R is inversely proportional to P, increasing P does not accompany both the increases in Iph and R; therefore it is difficult to achieve balanced performance between Iph and R as a photodetector.
Herein, we propose an experimental approach for engineering the strain of flexible CsPbBr3 thin films in situ during deposition, which enhances the photodetection performance of a self-powered vertical system incorporating phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an electron-transport layer (ETL) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as a hole-transport layer (HTL). Strain engineering is widely recognized as a strategy for modulating optoelectronic properties by taking advantage of stress-driven changes in the band structure, which arise from changes in the crystal structure, such as the bond angle and bond length.19–22 The strain engineering of halides has been reported, mostly for use in solar cells or on the basis of theoretical analysis. Specifically, an intentional strain was experimentally imposed by substitution-driven stress,23 annealing at high temperatures,20 and thermal mismatch with the substrate.24 For example, a solar cell based on a (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 thin film exhibited a high conversion efficiency of ∼20.7% when the residual strain was vertically modulated via thermal annealing.20 Theoretical calculations on MAPbI3 suggested the possibility of large fluctuations in the band structure and density of states over a compressive-to-tensile-strain range of up to 4%.21
Interestingly, few studies on strain modulation in halide-based photodetectors have been reported. The only reported example of strain engineering in a halide photodetector was inducing an intentional lattice mismatch between α-FAPbI3 thin films and a rigid substrate to gain limited control of the compressive field in the halide.24 In the present study, a unique in situ strain-engineering process was designed to control the compressive and tensile lattice strain in flexible CsPbBr3 thin films during deposition using bent polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates. A maximum tensile strain of +0.81% attained the significant performance enhancements relative to the unstrained results, e.g., Iph from 2.58 to 5.15 μA and R from 60.7 to 121.5 mA W−1 at P ∼0.47 mW cm−2, for the flexible CsPbBr3-based vertical photodetectors. The performance of Iph and R corresponds to nearly two-fold increases relative to the values for the unstrained reference case. In particular, the origin of the enhanced photodetection performance was investigated by determining the strain-dependent band alignments that are correlative to the estimated distortion of the octahedron cells. As far as we are concerned, this study is the first example of a self-powered flexible photodetector based on inorganic perovskite halides, apart from the strain effects.
Results and discussion
Characteristics of CsPbBr3 thin films with in situ lattice strain
An in situ strain-engineering technique was employed to apply an extra compressive and tensile strain in the photoactive layer for a self-powered photodetector designed with a Ag:LiF/PCBM/CsPbBr3/PEDOT:PSS/ITO/PEN structure, where ITO represents indium tin oxide. A schematic diagram of the fabrication process for the self-powered photodetector is presented in Fig. 1a. A 70 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS film was initially spin-coated onto a patterned ITO/PEN substrate (20 mm × 25 mm). To produce lattice strain in situ, while synthesizing the halide phase, a two-step coating process was developed.25 Specifically, the PbBr2 layer was first spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 75 °C. Next, the substrate was bent in either a concave or convex manner with a given curvature. The CsBr layer was then deposited onto the pre-bent PbBr2 layer via dip-coating at 50 °C. Compressive (tensile) strain was assumed to be created after releasing the film synthesized on the convex (concave) substrate back into the flat state. The degree of curvature determined the magnitude of this in situ strain εi ranging from −0.81% to +0.81%, in which a negative (positive) sign indicates a compressive (tensile) strain. The estimation procedure of the εi values is available in Fig. S1 (ESI†), which used the equation defining the neutral plane of the multilayer structure with the consideration of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of each layer.26 For example, the CsPbBr3 thin film synthesized on a concavely prebent substrate with a bending curvature of 7.52 mm was assumed to have a tensile strain of +0.81%, whereas a smaller strain of +0.53% was assumed in the film processed with a larger radius of 11.49 mm. Finally, the PCBM and Ag:LiF layers were sequentially deposited on the flat CsPbBr3/ITO/PEN assembly.

Fig. 1b shows surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the CsPbBr3 thin films processed with εi of −0.81%, 0%, and +0.81% along with a cross-sectional image of the unstrained film as an example. Additional SEM images with the other εi values are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the εi-dependent grain size and film thickness are plotted in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Dense CsPbBr3 thin films possessing an average thickness of ∼509 nm (±33 nm) and an average grain size of ∼183 nm (±9 nm) were observed for all the samples, indicating that the variation in εi does not significantly affect the morphology development. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) patterns of the strained halide films demonstrated a phase-pure orthorhombic perovskite structure, regardless of the presence of compressive or tensile strain, as shown in the full-scale patterns in Fig. S4 (ESI†). However, the peaks revealed noticeable shifts in the peak positions with the application of εi as exemplified in the cases of (020) and (200) planes as seen in Fig. 1c. For example, the (020) and (200) peaks shifted gradually to lower 2θ angles with the increase in εi from −0.81% to +0.81%. As a result of the peak shifts, Fig. 1d presents the changes in the calculated lattice constants, with εi, indicating anisotropic lattice distortion, i.e., expansion in the ab-plane and contraction in the c-direction (out-of-plane) with tensile εi. With the opposite trends in the case of compressive εi, consequently, the volume of the unit cell appeared to increase slightly with εi across the compressive-to-tensile region, i.e., from 795.1 Å3 for the −0.81% film to 804.9 Å3 for the +0.81% film. The stress σ values induced in the films were estimated to be −32.6 MPa for the −0.81% film and +21.6 MPa for the +0.81% film according to the biaxial strain model,27,28 as seen in the εi-dependent σ plot of Fig. S5 (ESI†). All relevant values of the lattice constants, unit cell volume, and lattice stress are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
Micro-photoluminescence (PL) measurements also revealed strong evidence of the modulated lattice strain in the synthesized halide films. Fig. 1e shows the εi-dependent PL spectra detected from a ∼3 μm spot in the central region of the film, in which the main emission peak at ∼530 nm shifted gradually toward lower wavelengths as εi reached the maximum +0.81%. This lower emission with tensile strain must be understood in relation to the εi-dependent change in the optical bandgap, as will be discussed in the subsequent section, as tensile εi evidently increases the bandgap. Similarly, a higher-wavelength PL peak with compressive strain in CsPbBr3 single crystals was previously reported, wherein the concomitant red shift was attributed to the Pb–Br antibonding overlapping accompanied by contracted PbBr6 octahedra.29
It is worth mentioning that the εi-dependent strain field is assumed to be non-uniformly distributed over the length of the pre-bent substrate, as demonstrated in the strain distributions in Fig. 1f. Stronger strain fields were induced around the central region of the sample compared with those in the areas away from the center.30 Two cases with εi ∼ ±0.53% and ±0.81% are compared in the top and bottom images of Fig. 1f, respectively, and higher strain fields can be visualized by the more intense yellow area in the central region of the sample with εi ∼ ±0.81%. All the subsequent photodetection measurements were taken within a central area of ∼1.5 mm, with the strain variation of ±0.1% from the middle point. The calculated strain fields in accordance with εi and the distance away from the center are listed in Table S2 (ESI†).

In situ strain-dependent performance of CsPbBr3 photodetectors

Fig. 2a illustrates the structure of the proposed flexible CsPbBr3 photodetector incorporating an HTL and ETL, with an inset showing a photograph of an actual device. The HTL and ETL materials were selected based on their reported beneficial effects in terms of effective charge transfer.31,32Fig. 2b shows the time-dependent photoresponse behavior of the strained CsPbBr3 photodetectors under a light intensity P of 1.52 mW cm−2. Consistent responses with on/off switching cycles were observed without an external bias, confirming the expected self-powered aspect of the system. The magnitude of the photocurrent Iph in the on-state was strongly associated with the presence of in situ strain: the maximum tensile strain of +0.81% exhibited a higher Iph of ∼10.83 μA, whereas the −0.81% sample produced a very low Iph of ∼0.27 μA. Relative to the Iph of ∼5.46 μA for the unstrained sample, the highest achieved photocurrent corresponds to an increase of ∼98%. Fig. 2c presents the dependence of Iph on the incident light intensity P in the range from ∼0.47 to 11.0 mW cm−2 for different εi values, which was extracted from the extended photocurrent–time curves in Fig. S6 (ESI†). As expected, Iph was more strongly enhanced by the increase in P, reaching the highest value of ∼42.79 μA at the maximum P of 11.0 mW cm−2 for the largest εi of +0.81%. This remarkable Iph value is higher than typical reported values, e.g., ∼1 μA at P of 10 mW cm−2 in a single-crystal CsPbBr3 system33 and ∼8 μA at 640 mW cm−2 in a microcrystal CsPbBr3 system.34

(b) Time-dependent photoresponses during repeated on/off switching cycles for the CsPbBr3 photodetectors constructed from −0.81%-, 0%-, and +0.81%-strained films, which were measured at 1.52 mW cm−2 without applying a bias.

Dependence of (d) R and (e) D* on the incident light intensity for the strained photodetectors. (f) Changes in rise and decay times with in situ strain. 
The responsivity R, which is defined as the ratio of the photocurrent Iph to the incident light power P, represents the photosensitivity responding to incident optical signals, as shown in the R versus P plots of Fig. 2d. The values of R tended to decrease with increasing P for all the strained cases, whereas higher R values were observed with the larger tensile εi. For example, the maximum R of ∼121.5 mA W−1 was achieved with Iph of ∼5.15 μA at the lowest P of 0.47 mW cm−2 for the +0.81% photodetector. The best R and Iph values at 0.47 mW cm−2 are meaningful as a balanced achievement compared to the reported ones, e.g., ∼110 mA W−1 and ∼1 μA at 0.64 mW cm−2 for a 11 μm-thick CsPbBr3 microcrystal photodetector32 and ∼44 mA W−1 and ∼1 μA at 0.29 mW cm−2 for a 400 nm-thick CsPbBr3 thin-film photodetector.17 Note that our system is based on a rare flexible system on a plastic substrate, while the reported systems use rigid substrates such as glass and sapphire. It is hard to achieve balanced values between Iph and R owing to the opposite dependences of Iph and R on P.

Fig. 2e shows the change in the detectivity D* of the strained photodetectors with increasing P, which was strongly associated with the magnitude of εi at a given P value. Considering all the noise contributions by flicker, shot, and thermal noises,35–37 the noise spectral density was obtained in the frequency range from 1 to 2 × 104 Hz for the strained photodetectors, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The D* value was estimated using the noise density at 1 Hz. As a result, the maximum D* of ∼1.93 × 108 Jones (= cm Hz1/2 W−1) was achieved at 0.47 mW cm−2 for the largest tensile strain of +0.81%. The largest D* value corresponds to approximately a 10 times increase relative to ∼1.66 × 107 Jones for the unstrained photodetector. Fig. 2f also demonstrates the changes in rise time τr and decay time τd for the strained photodetectors, which were obtained from the photoresponse curves in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The rise (decay) time is defined as the time required to reach 90% (10%) of the maximum photocurrent when the response was rising (falling).38 The +0.81%-strained photodetector exhibited impressive responses with τr of 2.5 μs and τd of 2.8 μs, both faster than the corresponding values of 10.0 and 12.5 μs for the unstrained device. In contrast, the slower τr and τd values of 27.8 and 32.3 μs, respectively, were observed for the −0.81%-strained photodetectors. The response times of 2.5–32.3 μs for the strained samples are highly outstanding, particularly compared to the reported values from 40 μs to 281 ms for self-powered inorganic halide photodetectors.16,18,33,34,39,40 The remarkable values indicate that our photodetector system is very promising with the noticeable effect of in situ tensile strain.
It should be mentioned that the strained photodetectors exhibited promising performance reliability, as evaluated by subjecting them to repetitive bending operations, under humid conditions, and under continuous irradiation as seen in the corresponding results in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The photocurrent remained consistently high with extended cycling: the retentions of ∼91.3% after 4000 cycles and ∼84.8% after 8000 cycles at the bending strain of ∼1.01%. Similarly, the performance of the +0.81% photodetector was stable after being stored at 25 °C for 10 days under ambient conditions with the humidity of 60 ± 5%, as illustrated with stable phase-retention after 10 days. In addition, the photocurrent of the +0.81% photodetector was also well preserved after 20 h of continuous light irradiation.

In situ strain-driven energy band alignments
The εi-dependent photodetection performance was correlated to changes in the band alignments around the halide films. Fig. 3a and b show the optical responses of the strained CsPbBr3 thin films as characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). From the Tauc plots in Fig. 3a, which were obtained as a part of the absorption spectra in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the bandgap Eg of the strained halide films was estimated by extrapolating the curves onto the x-axis. The unstrained film had an Eg of ∼2.328 eV, which is very close to a previously reported value.41 The bandgap widened as εi changed from the largest compressive strain (Eg ∼2.317 eV at εi of −0.81%) to the largest tensile strain (Eg ∼2.340 eV at εi of +0.81%), as plotted in the inset of Fig. 3a. This bandgap widening with tensile strain coincides with the blue-shifted PL peaks, as displayed in Fig. 1e. Similarly, based on simulations, a bandgap reduction of 0.035 eV per strain % was previously reported for CsPbBr3 with an assumed hydrostatic compression of up to 2.17%.42Fig. 3b shows the secondary cut-off and low-binding-energy regions of the UPS spectra for the strained films. Notably, the position of the Fermi level EF, which is related to the secondary cut-off region, was significantly affected by εi, whereas the binding energy was mostly unaffected. As a result, the εi-dependent absolute positions of the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) were determined, as illustrated in Fig. 3c. Evidently, the tensile strain tended to reduce both the CBM and VBM levels, while increasing slightly the optical bandgap. For example, the CBM/VBM energy levels were −3.275/−5.592, −3.609/−5.937, and −3.944/−6.284 eV for the −0.81%-, 0%-, and +0.81%-strained films, respectively. The strain-dependent band structure in inorganic halides has never been investigated experimentally, except for a theoretical demonstration of band-level adjustments in CsPbBr3 with compressive strain of up to 70 GPa.34 This theoretical estimation agrees well with our results that with increasingly compressive strain, the CBM and VBM levels increased, while the bandgap narrowed. All energy levels including EF, the conduction band edge Ec, and the valence band edge Ev are available in Table S3 (ESI†).

(b) UPS spectra highlighted around the secondary cut-off and low-binding-energy (LBE) regions for the strained CsPbBr3 thin films. (c) Schematic energy band diagrams of the strained CsPbBr3 thin films, reflecting the adjusted CBM, EF, and VBM levels for various values of εi. (d) Energy-band alignments across the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsPbBr3/PCBM/LiF-Ag layers, which were reflected by the εi-dependent energy levels of CsPbBr3, along with schematically depicted charge-transport behaviors for the −0.81%-, 0%-, and +0.81%-strained cases, particularly through the modulated barrier height φB. 

Fig. 3d illustrates the projected band alignments with neighboring HTL and ETL for the −0.81%, 0%, and +0.81%-strained halide thin films. The energy levels of the CBM and VBM in halides are assumed to shift significantly relative to the energy positions of the HTL and ETL. For example, the CBM approaches the Ec of the ETL in the case of a tensile strain of +0.81%, whereas the energy gap between the halide and ETL is wider in the compressive case of −0.81%. In the case of tensile strain, the gap narrows between the CBM and EF levels, both of which approach that of the ETL. A narrower junction with a lower barrier height is expected to be created at the halide/ETL interface owing to the smaller EF mismatch that facilitates the extraction of the photogenerated electrons into the ETL. The lower CBM in the other junction with the HTL may be more effective as an electron blocking layer. Apparently, the observed higher Iph in this tensile case is directly associated with the adjusted band positions and subsequent favorable barrier height for improved charge collection. In the case of compressive strain, however, the charge transfer into the ETL would not be favorable because of the increased barrier height at the junction, even with the smaller optical bandgap. In addition, the photocurrent curves as a function of incident wavelength are available for the strained photodetectors in Fig. S11 (ESI†), confirming the higher photoresponse over the wavelength range in the case of the larger tensile strain.
Structural origin of in situ strain-driven performance
To explore the structure–property relationship based on the crystallographic information from the XRD patterns, additional structural analysis was conducted using Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis (VESTA) software.43Fig. 4a schematically represents the crystal structure of CsPbBr3 composed of connected PbBr6 octahedra, which are specified by the Pb–Br–Pb bond angles (representing the angles between the neighboring octahedra) and bond lengths between Pb and Br atoms within a single PbBr6 octahedron. According to the estimation, the length of the Pb–Br bonds increased in the equatorial direction and decreased in the apical direction in the case of tensile strain, indicating the anisotropic nature of the octahedral distortion. As shown in Fig. 4b, the average Pb–Br bond length tended to increase gradually with increasing tensile εi. As an accompanying effect of the tensile strain, the volume of the PbBr6 octahedron was found to reach a maximum of 35.29 Å3 for the +0.81% strain, in contrast with 34.86 Å3 for the −0.81% strain. The effects of enlarged unit cells on carrier dynamics are associated with weak nonadiabatic coupling owing to a reduction in the electron–hole overlap and the localization of partial charges, both of which shorten the decoherence time and suppress charge recombination, while extending the recombination time.44–46 All structural values obtained using VESTA are available in Table S4 (ESI†).

(b) εi-dependent variations in the average Pb–Br bond lengths and volume of the PbBr6 octahedron, in which the average value was calculated from the three bond lengths of Pb–BrI, Pb–BrII, and Pb–BrIII. (c) Schematic illustration of orbital coupling in the energy band diagram of CsPbBr3 according to the changes in the CBM and VBM levels with applied εi. (d) εi-dependent changes in equatorial, apical, and average angles of Pb–Br–Pb bonds in the strained CsPbBr3 thin films. 

Fig. 4c displays the orbital band structure projected for the unstrained and strained CsPbBr3. The valence band consists of a Br 4p state hybridized with an antibonding Pb 6s state, whereas the conduction band reflects the antibonding hybridization of the Pb 6p and Br 4p states. The bandgap is associated with the degree of antibonding overlap between the Pb 6s and Br 4p orbitals in the valence band, which is strongly influenced by the Pb–Br bond length.42 Larger tensile strain induces longer Pb–Br bonds, which may cause a weaker orbital coupling between Pb 6s and Br 4p, thus lowering the valence band edge and consequently contributing to a blue shift in the optical bandgap of CsPbBr3.

Fig. 4d shows the estimated changes in Pb–Br–Pb bond angles between neighboring octahedra, which can be specified with eight equatorial angles and 12 apical angles, to define the degree of lattice distortion from a unit cell of CsPbBr3 consisting of 12 corner-sharing PbBr6 octahedra (Fig. 4a). The average value of the eight equatorial angles for each εi was found to increase across the compressive-to-tensile region, while the average value of 12 apical angles reduced very slightly, thereby increasing the average value for all Pb–Br–Pb bond angles with increasing tensile εi. This increasing angle suggests that the electron–phonon coupling is weakened owing to the weak electrostatic interactions within the lattice.45 Because the resultant lowered exciton binding energy promotes charge dissociation, the tensile strain likely exhibits better photodetection performance, despite the drawback of a slightly increased bandgap. In addition, the changes in the Pb–Br–Pb bond angles represent the relative angular relationship between the neighboring PbBr6 octahedra. The increase in this angle accompanies a smaller transverse displacement of Br anions from the mid-point of the Pb–Pb distance and thus a change in the symmetry of the crystal structure.47 The changes in the average angle clearly show that the applied tensile εi straightens the octahedral framework in the lateral direction. In addition, we confirmed whether the tensile strain was beneficial or not in the photodetection performance by post-bending the unstrained photodetectors in a concave or convex manner and then by measuring the photocurrent in the bent state, as seen in Fig. S12 (ESI†). As anticipated, the tensile strain applied by the post bending also demonstrated a higher photocurrent, depending on the magnitude of tensile strain.
Conclusions
An experimental strategy for modulating lattice strain in situ over a practical compressive-to-tensile strain range was proposed for a photodetector platform consisting of a self-powered, flexible, vertical structure based on representative inorganic halide thin films of CsPbBr3. This in situ strain deposition method provides a controllable compressive and tensile strain of ±0.81%, corresponding to lattice stresses of −32.6 and +21.6 MPa, respectively. The best responsivity of ∼121.5 mA W−1 with a photocurrent of 5.15 μA at 0.47 mW cm−2 with the maximum tensile strain is very competitive over previously reported values when considering that the system is both self-powered and flexible. The in situ tensile strain resulted in an adjusted band alignment that was favorable for enhanced charge transport and thus a higher photoresponse, as highlighted by the reduced energy levels of the CBM and VBM. The longer average Pb–Br bonds and the increased Pb–Br–Pb angles in the tensile strain case were assumed to be responsible for the enhanced photoresponse, primarily owing to the weakened orbital coupling between Pb 6s and Br 4p in the straightened octahedral framework.
Experimental section
Preparation of photodetectors with in situ strained CsPbBr3
Flexible CsPbBr3 thin films were prepared using a two-step solution deposition process to impose compressive or tensile strain in situ. Prior to film deposition, an ITO-coated PEN substrate (20 mm × 25 mm) was ultrasonicated in an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) bath for 10 min followed by oxygen plasma treatment for 5 min. For the HTL, an aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083, Heraeus, Germany) was initially spin-coated onto the surface-treated substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s and dried at 75 °C for 20 min. To deposit the CsPbBr3 thin film, lead (II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.99%, TCI, Japan) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., USA) at a concentration of 367 mg mL−1 and stirred at room temperature for 5 h. Cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.9%, TCI, Japan) was separately dissolved in anhydrous methanol (CH3OH, anhydrous, Daejung, Korea) at a concentration of 15 mg mL−1. The prepared PbBr2 solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS/ITO/PEN substrate at 3500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 75 °C for 15 min. The annealed PbBr2/PEDOT:PSS/ITO/PEN sample was then uniaxially bent in a convex (or concave) manner with a known curvature to produce compressive (or tensile) strain in the subsequent thin film. A position-adjustable fixture was designed to provide different degrees of curvature (and thus strain). The bent PbBr2 film was dipped into the CsBr solution at 50 °C for 15 min to synthesize the perovskite phase. The film was then rinsed with IPA and dried at 50 °C for 10 min in an oven, and the deposited CsPbBr3 film was finally released back to its original flat state. The bending curvature was adjusted to possess different uniaxial strain εi values of −0.81, −0.53, 0, +0.53, and +0.81% in the final perovskite films. For the ETL, a PCBM (99.5%, Nano-C Inc., USA) solution was diluted in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., USA) at a concentration of 2 wt% and then spin-coated onto the flat sample at 1250 rpm for 60 s. The top electrode composed of Ag(100 nm)/LiF(1 nm) was deposited using a thermal evaporator in an Ar-filled glove box to prepare the final Ag:LiF/PCBM/CsPbBr3/PEDOT:PSS/ITO/PEN structure.
Characterization and measurements
The surface and cross-sectional microstructures were obtained from near the center of the halide thin films within ±1.5 mm (from the mid-point) using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM 7610F, JEOL, Japan) operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. For the SEM observation, specimens were prepared by cutting the film into a size of 3 mm × 3 mm in the central region and then by sputtering at 10 mA for Pt-coating with an ∼11 nm thickness. The crystal structure was examined by HR-XRD (SmartLab, Rigaku, Japan) operated in a glancing incidence mode under a fixed incident angle of 0.5° with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). A scanning range of 10–50°, a step size of 0.02°, and a preset time of 2 s were employed in the step-scan mode. The PL spectra were obtained using an Optron Micro-PL system (Dongwoo, Korea) using a 325 nm He–Cd laser source and a laser spot size of 3 μm.
The time-dependent photoresponse of the CsPbBr3 photodetector was measured using a solar simulator (Sun 2000, ABET Technologies, USA) over the wavelength range from 350 to 800 nm and a galvanostat (IviumStat, Ivium Technologies, Netherlands). As one of the critical parameters, the responsivity R was calculated as follows:  where Iph is the photocurrent, Ilight is the current under light illumination, Idark is the current generated under no light illumination, Plight is the incident light intensity, and A is the effective area. The detectivity D* was estimated using the following relation:  where B is the bandwidth and in is the noise current. The noise density at 1 Hz in the noise spectral density-frequency curves of Fig. S7 (ESI†) was used for the D* estimation. The noise spectral density was measured under dark conditions in the frequency range from 1 to 2 × 104 Hz using a dynamic signal analyzer (35670A, Agilent, USA) equipped with a current amplifier (428, Keithley, USA). For the measurements of the rise and decay response times, a light source at 470 nm was modulated using an arbitrary waveform generator (33210A, Agilent, USA) to provide square waves with a frequency of 10 kHz. The strained photodetectors were directly connected to an oscilloscope (DSOX2012A, Keysight, USA) with an input impedance of 1 MΩ. The reliability of the photodetectors was examined by measuring the photodetection behavior during extended bending cycles using a commercial one-axis high-speed fatigue machine (CTLM500, Ceratorq Inc., Korea). The photocurrent curves with the incident wavelength were attained using a photovoltaic measurement system (Solar Cell Scan 100, Zolix Ins., China). The optical transmittance and absorption spectra of the films were obtained in the wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (V-530, JASCO, Japan). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS Axis SupraTM, Kratos, U.K.) was used to determine the absolute position of the VBM. All characterization measurements were carried out within 5 h of device fabrication.

New concepts
Although there have been substantial efforts towards improving the performance of perovskite halide-based photodetectors, the true dependence and influence of lattice strain on the photodetection behavior have been very rarely reported in halide materials. Herein, we introduce an experimental method for modulating the lattice strain in situ over a practical compressive-to-tensile strain range in representative inorganic halide thin films of CsPbBr3 by using a photodetector platform with a self-powered, flexible, vertical structure on a polymer substrate. This study is the first to report a flexible photodetector based on inorganic halides, apart from the effects of in situ strain on photoresponse. The case of tensile strain resulted in substantial improvements in photoresponse, as being associated with the ideal band alignments with the contacting layers for effective charge transport. The structural origin of the photoresponse enhancement with tensile strain is also explored with the estimated changes in bond angles and bond lengths of the perovskite structure and their optical influences on the basis of experimental crystal information. The experimental approach for imposing the compressive or tensile lattice strain and the analytical outcomes concerning the strain-dependent changes in crystal structures are very unique compared to any related previous reports.
