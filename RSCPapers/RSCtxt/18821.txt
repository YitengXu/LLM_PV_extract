    , Accepted 5th November 2013First published on 6th November 2013AbstractA series of new porphyrins (LWP1–4) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were prepared by attaching pyrene or a 4-dimethylaminophenyl group in combination with anthracene to modify the porphyrin core. Fundamental studies showed that incorporation of these moieties renders feasible tuning of spectral and redox properties of the porphyrins. Significantly, DSSCs adopting the LWP1 dye exhibit energy conversion up to 800 nm without compromising the overall efficiency. This achievement is attributed to the collective effects of the broadened and red-shifted IPCE spectra, elevated energy levels at the excited states of the dyes, suitable dye soaking processes, and suitable electron-donating substituents.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have drawn much attention in recent years as a promising and economic alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells.1–5 Power conversion efficiencies (PCE, η) greater than 11% have been well demonstrated with DSSCs sensitized by polypyridyl ruthenium complexes.6–8 On the other hand, other types of sensitizers have also been intensely investigated for their lower cost, facile synthesis and modification, large molar absorption coefficients, stability, etc. Porphyrins and their derivatives have been of great interest as DSSC sensitizers due to their vital roles in photosynthesis, strong absorption in the visible region and the ease of adjusting chemical structures for light harvesting.9–23 Since Officer and co-workers reported a 7.1% DSSC efficiency using a side-anchoring and fully conjugated porphyrin dye in their milestone work in 2007,9a,12a rapid progress has been made in efficiencies of porphyrin-based DSSCs. Recently, Yella et al. have raised the PCE of a porphyrin-based DSSC beyond 12% by using a cobalt-based electrolyte, an alkyl-wrapped porphyrin, and an organic dye.13
In our continuous search for efficient porphyrin dyes, we have established that a suitable anchoring group as well as an auxochrome can largely improve the usefulness of a porphyrin dye for DSSCs. For example, the photovoltaic performance of a porphyrin-based DSSC can be effectively improved by attaching a zinc porphyrin with a shorter anchoring group (PE1),18a,b by expanding the porphyrin spectral range with an anthracene bridge (LAC3),19 by attaching porphyrin with an electron-releasing substituent (Me2N–PE1),20 or by adding a rigid fluorophore to the π-conjugation system (LD4 and LD22).21 We were also the first to successfully attain high efficiencies with alkyl-wrapped porphyrins in the classic DSSC setup (LD14 and LD16).22,23
To advance our studies, we are interested in extending the absorption range of porphyrin-based photo-sensitizers into the near-IR region (>700 nm) since a significant portion of solar energy falls within this range.4 Red-shifting the absorption bands of a sensitizer is a logical and most common way to achieve such a goal. However, this is a delicate task because it often results in a very low LUMO level or excited state of the dye. Consequently, electron injection from an excited near-IR dye to the conduction bands of semiconductors (e.g., TiO2) may be hampered. For example, DSSCs sensitized by fused or dimeric porphyrins with very red-shifted absorption bands showed only poor to modest overall efficiencies.9d In a recent study by Anderson and Snaith,24 it was shown that photovoltaic responses of a fused porphyrin in the Q band (near-IR) region disappeared when using TiO2 anodes. Intriguingly, the near-IR responses were recovered by switching TiO2 to SnO2. This phenomenon was suggested to be due to the lower conduction bands of SnO2 allowing electron injection from the said dye. Unfortunately, the SnO2 device performs less efficiently than the TiO2 counterpart. Therefore, there is still an active quest for efficient DSSCs in the near-IR region.
In this work, we report monomeric porphyrin dyes with energy conversion capability extended into the near-IR region without sacrificing the overall DSSC efficiencies. Chart 1 displays the structures of the new porphyrins (denoted as LWP1–LWP4), along with those of the parent complexes (LD14, LAC3, LD4). The common parts of the LWP dyes consist of 4-benzoic acid as the anchoring group, ethyne as the bridging moiety, and ortho-alkoxylated phenyl groups to lessen dye aggregation in non-coordinating organic solvents. In addition, the LWP dyes are attached with two auxochromes at the meso-positions in two different fashions. Anthracene, pyrene, and 4-dimethylaminophenyl groups are chosen because of their proven usefulness in expanding the porphyrin absorption range (LAC3),19 increasing the porphyrin light-harvesting ability (LD4),21a and elevating the energy level at the excited states of the porphyrin (LD14),22a respectively. In the first arrangement (LWP1, LWP2), two auxochromes are each added to the different meso-positions, allowing each substituent to interact with the porphyrin core individually. In the second arrangement (LWP3, LWP4), two auxochromes are first linked together as one giant substituent to collectively interact with the porphyrin core. By piecing potent substituents/auxochromes together in a LEGO® style, we wish to create efficient DSSC sensitizers capable of converting solar energy in the near-IR region. Ultimately, we wish to use this study as an example to demonstrate that judiciously adjusting energy levels at the excited states is as important as broadening/red-shifting the absorption bands (or IPCE responses) of a chromophore when developing efficient near-IR dyes for DSSCs.

Experimental section
Instruments
Electrochemical measurements (CH Instrument Electrochemical Workstation 611A), absorption spectra (Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer or Jasco V-670 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer) and fluorescence spectra (Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer) were recorded with the indicated instruments.
Compound synthesis and characterization
The syntheses of the LWP porphyrins are based on the Sonogashira and Lindsey's copper-free cross-coupling methods.25,26 The synthetic procedures are according to the literature report.20–22,27 Materials, synthetic details, characterization data, and the instruments used are described in the ESI.†
DSSC cell fabrication
The DSSCs were fabricated with a working electrode based on TiO2 nanoparticles (NP) and Pt-coated counter electrodes. In the fabrication of DSSC devices, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent conductors on glass substrates were first cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath and then were rinsed with water and ethanol. A layer of 30 nm sized anatase TiO2 nanoparticles was then coated on the FTO by the doctor-blade method. After drying the film at 180 °C, another layer of 400 nm sized anatase TiO2 nanoparticles was then coated as the light scattering layer. The resulting working electrode was composed of a 12 μm thick transparent TiO2 nanoparticle layer (average particle size: 30 nm) and a 4 μm thick TiO2 scattering layer (average particle size: 400 nm). The nanoporous TiO2 electrodes were then heated in an atmospheric oven first by gradually ramping the temperature from 100 °C to 500 °C and then at 500 °C for 40 min. After cooling, the nanoporous TiO2 electrodes were subjected to a dye soaking/washing procedure for dye adsorption. The dye solution was composed of 5 × 10−5 M porphyrin dye (LWP1–LWP4) in the ethanol–toluene mixture (1:1). The working electrode was first immersed into the dye solution at room temperature for 9 hours, and then was immersed into the ethanol–toluene (7:3) solvent mixture at 50 °C for 2 hours to wash off dyes that did not tightly anchor onto the TiO2 surface. Such dye soaking/washing processes were repeated two to three times. Counter electrodes of the DSSCs were prepared by depositing 40 nm thick Pt films on the FTO glass plates by e-beam evaporation. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 working electrode and a counter electrode were then assembled into a sealed DSSC cell with a sealant spacer between the two electrode plates. A drop of electrolyte solution [0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in a mixture of acetonitrile–valeronitrile (85:15, v/v)] was injected into the cell through a drilled hole. Finally, the hole was sealed using the sealant and a cover glass. A mask with an aperture area of 0.096 cm2 was used to cover the testing cell during photovoltaic measurements. For comparison, DSSCs using the reported/known porphyrin dye LD14 or ruthenium dye N719 were also fabricated under the same conditions except for different dye soaking conditions.22a,28
DSSC cell characterization
The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under illumination of the simulated AM 1.5G solar light from a 300 W xenon lamp solar simulator (Oriel 81160). The incident light intensity was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2. Photocurrent–voltage curves were obtained by applying an external bias voltage to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent. The current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs were used to extract the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (Eff.) of the DSSCs. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were measured by using a 75 W xenon arc lamp as the light source coupled to a monochromator. The IPCE data were taken by illuminating monochromatic light on the solar cells (with the wavelength from 300 nm to 800 nm) and measuring the short-circuit current of the solar cells. The IPCE measurement was conducted with a lock-in amplifier, a low-speed chopper, and a bias light source under the full computer control. In addition to the standard I–V and IPCE characterization of solar cells, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used to analyze the internal impedance properties of DSSCs. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the cells was measured by using a Gamry Reference 600 electrochemical impedance analyzer with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. During the impedance measurement, the cell was under the constant AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The impedance of the cell throughout the frequency range was then measured by applying a bias at the open-circuit voltage Voc of the cell (namely, under the condition of no dc electric current) and by using an ac amplitude of 10 mV.
Results and discussion
UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectra
The UV-visible absorption spectra of LWP porphyrins in THF are shown in Fig. 1a, along with those of LD4, LD14, and LAC3 parent complexes for comparison (Fig. 1b). The absorption maximum wavelengths and extinction coefficients are listed in Table 1. As shown in the figure, the LWP dyes exhibit typical porphyrin absorption spectra.29 B (or Soret) bands appear in the higher energy region (400–550 nm) whereas Q bands locate in the lower energy region (about 700 nm). When compared with the LD4 and LD14 dyes, the absorption bands of the LWP porphyrins are significantly broadened and red-shifted. This can be attributed to the extended π-conjugation. When compared with LAC3, the similarly broadened features in the LWP and LAC3 spectra suggest that the anthracene motif in the chemical structures of LWP and LAC3 has a dominant impact on broadening of the absorption bands. This is consistent with the literature reports of similar systems.19,21a,30,31 Remarkably, the absorption bands of LWPs are still largely red-shifted than those of LAC3.

Upon closer inspection, we found that B bands of LWPs all center around 480 nm with LWP3 and LWP4 having much broader B bands. This suggests that having one gigantic substituent is more effective than having two smaller fragments in terms of broadening the absorption bands of a dye. In addition, the Q bands of LWPs are all substantially broadened, red-shifted, and intensified compared to those of LD4, LD14, and LAC3. Specifically, the Q bands of LWPs are about 27–44 nm more red-shifted than those of the LD4, LD14, and LAC3 dyes. Also, intensified Q bands of LWP dyes make them more balanced with the B bands, suggesting the superior light harvesting ability of the LWP dyes in the near-IR (>700 nm) region. These are all welcome merits for creating efficient DSSCs in the near-IR region.

Fig. 2 compares the B band-excited fluorescence spectra of the LWP porphyrins in THF. The emission maxima are listed in Table 1. Similar to the Q-band absorptions, fluorescence spectra of LWP porphyrins are all red-shifted from those of the parent complexes due to the extended π-conjugation.

For the first reductions, the ill-shaped redox couples found around −0.70 V vs. SCE are consistent with the reduction of the anchoring group.22c Two additional reductions are observed at more negative potentials and the potentials of these quasi-reversible processes are consistent with the formation of a zinc porphyrin anion radical and di-anion.32 In general, the first porphyrin-ring reduction potentials of LWPs are similar to those of LAC3 and LD4, but all positively shifted from that of LD14. This can be attributed to the LWP's extended π-conjugation. In addition, the reduction potentials of LWP1 and LWP3 are more negative than those of LWP2 and LWP4 because of the electron-donating substituent. Furthermore, the first porphyrin-ring reduction potential of LWP1 (−1.19 V) is slightly more negative than that of LWP3 (−1.16 V), showing the effect of directly attaching an electron-donating group to the porphyrin core.
For the oxidations, two waves of quasi-reversible processes are observed for LWP1 and LWP3 whereas only one set is found for LWP2 and LWP4. The first oxidations of LWPs are consistent with the formation of a zinc porphyrin cation radical.32 The first oxidation potentials of LWP1 and LWP3 are less positive than those of LWP2 and LWP4, indicating the electron-donating effect of the 4-dimethylaminophenyl group. In addition, the first oxidation potential of LWP1 is slightly more negative than that of LWP3, once again showing the effect of directly attaching an electron-donating substituent to the porphyrin core. The second oxidation potentials of LWP1 and LWP3 around 0.90 V are consistent with the oxidations of the electron-releasing Me2N-substituents.20
To complement the experimental results, Fig. 4 shows the frontier orbital patterns of LWPs calculated by density-functional theory (DFT)33 at the B3LYP/LanL2DZ level. As shown in the figure, the MO patterns of the LWP porphyrins are consistent with the Gouterman's four-orbital model with a slight deviation.29 Delocalization of the MO patterns at the HOMO−1, HOMO and LUMO levels can be attributed to the lowered symmetry and the extended π-conjugation of the complexes. Importantly, the HOMO and LUMO patterns of the LWP porphyrins are more concentrated at the left and right part of the molecules, respectively. This phenomenon may translate to a push–pull tendency of the LWP dyes upon excitation, a welcome merit for n-type DSSC dyes. As to the calculated MO energies, DFT calculations suggest less negative (or higher) HOMO and LUMO levels for LWP1 and LWP3. This trend is in agreement with the presence of electron-donating Me2N-substituents in the chemical structures of LWP1 and LWP3, and is consistent with the electrochemical properties discussed above.

Fig. 5 shows the energy-level diagram of the LWP porphyrins, compares the ground-to-oxidized state (So/S+), the first singlet excited state (S*) of each porphyrin, the conduction bands (CB) of TiO2 and the redox energy of I−/I3−. The first porphyrin-ring oxidation potentials were used to estimate the So/S+ levels. The zero–zero excitation energies obtained from the intersection of the corresponding normalized absorption and emission spectra were used to estimate the energy gaps between the S* and the So/S+ levels.1,18–22 As suggested in the figure, all LWP porphyrins should be capable of injecting electrons to the CB of TiO2 upon excitation and the resulting cations can be efficiently regenerated by the electrolyte. The noticeably higher S* levels of the LWP1 and LWP3 porphyrins suggest that the electron injection processes from excited LWP1 and LWP3 to TiO2 may be more favourable than those of excited LWP2 and LWP4. Consequently, one could expect better photovoltaic performance from the DSSCs sensitized with LWP1 and LWP3 dyes (see below).

As compared in Table 2 and Fig. 6a, the overall efficiencies of the LWP-sensitized DSSCs show an order of LWP1 > LWP3 ≫ LWP2 > LWP4. The superior performance of the LWP1 and LWP3 cells can be understood via their better photovoltaic characteristics. The Jsc, Voc, and FF of the LWP1 and LWP3 cells are 17.77 mA cm−2, 0.73 V, 0.75 and 17.76 mA cm−2, 0.72 V, 0.74, respectively, yielding higher overall efficiencies of 9.73% and 9.51%, respectively. In contrast, LWP2 and LWP4 show poorer Jsc, Voc, and FF of 14.17 mA cm−2, 0.68 V, 0.72 and 14.20 mA cm−2, 0.68 V, 0.69, respectively, leading to inferior conversion efficiencies of 6.97% and 6.70%, respectively. For comparison, DSSCs adopting N719 and LD14 fabricated under similar conditions give rise to overall efficiencies of 8.96% and 10.03%, respectively.
As discussed earlier, higher energy levels at the excited states of the dyes suggest more favourable electron injection, contributing to higher Voc values of LWP1 and LWP3 cells. On the other hand, the Jsc values are in accordance with the IPCE spectra. As shown in Fig. 6b, the IPCE spectra of LWP cells show typical characteristics of porphyrin-sensitized cells, exhibiting strong B-band signals in the higher energy region, intense Q-band responses in the near-IR region, and a spectral valley around 530–630 nm. As would be expected from the UV-visible spectra (Fig. 1), IPCEs of the LWP cells are all red-shifted from that of the LD14 cell. More specifically, IPCEs of the LWP cells extend further than 760 nm whereas IPCE of the LD14 cell drops rapidly after 700 nm. Remarkably, the LWP1 cell demonstrates solar energy conversion beyond 800 nm while maintaining a high overall efficiency. As for the IPCE values, the LWP1 and LWP3 cells exhibit high IPCE maxima comparable to those of the N719 and LD14 cells. This trend is consistent with the Jsc results, reflecting the better sunlight-harvesting ability of LWP1 and LWP3 as photo-sensitizers than LWP2 and LWP4. The differences in IPCE and Jsc values, however, cannot be simply attributed to the differences in dye loadings (Table 2) since the LWP1 and LWP3 cells have dye loadings very similar to those of the LWP2 and LWP4 cells, respectively. Therefore, the superior photovoltaic performance of the LWP1 and LWP3 cells may be related to many factors acting in concert (vide infra).
The DSSCs were further characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to reveal important interfacial charge-transfer processes in DSSCs.34 For our measurements, the impedance spectroscopy was carried out by subjecting the cells to the constant AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination and to the bias at the open-circuit voltage Voc of the cells (namely, under the condition of no dc electric current), for better manifesting the process at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface of a cell under operation. Fig. 7 shows the EIS Nyquist plots (i.e., minus imaginary part of the impedance, −Z′′, vs. the real part of the impedance, Z′′, when sweeping the frequency) for DSSCs based on LWP dyes. For the frequency range investigated (0.1 Hz to 1 MHz), three regimes are generally distinguished: a small semicircle in the lowest frequency range (∼0.1 Hz to 2 Hz), a larger semicircle in the middle frequency range (∼2 Hz to 1 kHz), and another smaller semicircle in the highest frequency range (>1 kHz). With the bias illumination and voltage applied, the small semicircle at lowest frequencies is associated with ion diffusion in the electrolyte, the larger semicircle at middle frequencies corresponds to the charge-transfer processes at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface, and another smaller semicircle at highest frequencies corresponds to the charge-transfer processes at the Pt–electrolyte interface. As compared in Fig. 7, EIS of the DSSCs based on LWP1, LWP3, LD14, and N719 show similar characteristics and three impedance regimes can be distinguished in the Nyquist plots. In sharp contrast, EIS of the LWP2 and LWP4 cells show enormous middle-frequency semicircles, completely overriding the other two smaller semicircles. The much larger width of the middle-frequency semicircles of LWP2 and LWP4 cells indicates a much larger charge-transfer resistance at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface. This phenomenon has been suggested to be related to a thicker dye-aggregate layer on the TiO2 surface blocking electron/charge transfer processes, resulting in lowered Jsc and FF values.35 Our detailed experiments on dye soaking conditions vs. photovoltaic properties (available in the ESI†) are in agreement with the above suggestion. During the tests, the superior solubility of N719 and LD14 successfully lessened dye aggregation and we observed small second semicircles in the EIS as well as high overall efficiencies of the devices. For the LWP1 and LWP3 cells, larger second semicircles were always associated with poorer performance unless the dye soaking procedure was drastically modified (as described in the Experimental section) to effectively remove loosely attached dyes. Thus, when middle-frequency semicircles in the EIS became notably smaller, the overall efficiencies of the DSSCs were largely improved. Unfortunately for LWP2 and LWP4, their much poorer solubility in organic solutions prevented us from finding an effective way to lessen dye aggregation. Therefore, the performance of the LWP2 and LWP4 cells remains inferior and the second semicircles in the EIS remain large throughout our tests.

As for the difference in the chemical structures, one should not dismiss the fact that LWP1 and LWP3 have polar 4-dimethylaminophenyl substituents, whereas LWP2 and LWP4 have hydrophobic pyrene groups. The hydrophobic pyrene unit has been suggested to retard the recombination of the injected electron with the electrolyte, thus raising the Voc values.36 However, we must also consider (i) energy levels at the excited states of LWP2 and LWP4 being 0.14 and 0.12 eV lower than those of LWP1 and LWP3, respectively, and (ii) the ease of LWP2 and LWP4 aggregation. Both factors would mean less efficient electron injection from photo-excited dyes to TiO2. Less favourable electron injection would lead to a smaller carrier population in the conduction band of TiO2 and lower Fermi levels, thereby lowering the observed Voc values.37 In contrast, energy levels at the excited states of LWP1 and LWP3 are higher and the dye aggregation problem can be resolved. As a result, higher Voc values are observed for the LWP1 and LWP3 cells.38 Also, the polar electrolyte may be more easily accessed by the oxidized polar 4-dimethylaminophenyl moiety of LWP1 and LWP3 rather than the oxidized non-polar pyrene group of LWP2 and LWP4. This would affect dye regeneration processes, thus the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs.
In summary, the EIS results are in good agreement with the results of I–V and IPCE measurements.
Conclusions
We successfully prepared a series of new porphyrins (LWP1–LWP4) with near-IR energy conversion ability. Largely broadened and red-shifted absorption bands in the near-IR region of these dyes were achieved by attaching two potent auxochromes to the porphyrin meso-positions, namely the combination of the 4-dimethylaminophenyl group or pyrene with anthracene. Significantly, the LWP1 dye showed efficient energy conversion in the near-IR region without sacrificing the overall efficiency.
Results in this work have significant implication that, in addition to extending spectral response ranges, maintaining appropriate energy levels (for electron injection), minimizing dye aggregation by suitable dye soaking processes, and employing polar electron-releasing groups are of equal importance when developing efficient narrow-energy-gap DSSC dyes. This work concludes that these objectives can be simultaneously achieved by suitable arrangements of anthracene and the 4-dimethylaminophenyl group on a porphyrin dye.
It is worth mentioning that although the LWP1 and LWP3 cells exhibit conversion efficiencies comparable to that of the LD14 cell, higher efficiencies are not obtained at this time mainly due to their larger IPCE dips between B and Q bands. This may be supplemented by suitable co-sensitizers to achieve even higher efficiencies. The study of co-sensitization and stability issues is underway.
