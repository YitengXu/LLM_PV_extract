1 Introduction
In recent years, one of the major issues has been the reduction of toxic chemicals, waste and CO2 emission for safer and cleaner ways to obtain value-added chemicals to meet the challenges of environmental friendliness and sustainability.1–3 The field of catalysis can overcome these obstacles by adopting the concept of green chemistry. Catalysis is beneficial for the development of processes for the production of essential agricultural, bioactive and pharmaceutical organic compounds in greener ways. Catalysis can even help in creating synthetic routes to avoid the use of harsh conditions and toxic reagents and achieve easy separation with less time-consumption.3 Nowadays, focused on the utilisation of catalysts in chemical processes, the atom economy, abundance and cost of metal catalysts is of concern in the field of green chemistry. Nanomaterials (NMs) have been widely employed in diverse fields including energy transformation and storage, chemical synthesis, pharmaceutical applications, and green technology due to their ability to change their structure at the atomic level.4–11 Among the NMs reported so far, copper metal and NMs are cheap, earth-abundant and display versatile properties such as thermal and heat conductivity, ductility, strength, magnetism, antimicrobial activity, and electrical conductivity.12–14 Superior copper NMs can be obtained by controlling the size of bulk materials while maintaining their properties such as shape, size, stability, surface area, and crystal structure in the range of 1–100 nm. Copper and copper-based NMs display different properties from their bulk materials because of their increased surface area and distinct quantum properties.15 Cu and Cu-based NMs are especially attractive because of their high natural abundance and inexpensiveness compared to noble metals. Additionally, copper and copper-based NMs show excellent activity towards applications such as solar/photovoltaic energy conversion, electrocatalysis, photochemical catalysis and catalytic applications in the fields of industry and pharmaceuticals.1,16,17–21
In the past decade, scientists have focused on isolating copper materials at the atomic or nano-level and improving their properties such as thermal stability, shape, morphology, electric conductivity, optoelectronic and mechanical properties, antibacterial/antifungal activity and catalytic activity.21–23 It is well known that appropriate synthetic procedures are essential to obtain high-quality advanced NMs that possess unique and extraordinary properties.24 The main strategies for synthesizing Cu and Cu-based NMs are chemical vapor deposition,25 aqueous solution reduction,26 micro-emulsion,27 sonochemical reduction,28 laser ablation,29 metal vapor synthesis,30 biological synthesis,31 reverse micelles,32 radiation-induced synthesis,33 and the polyol method.34 However, the synthesised Cu and Cu-based NMs are delicate due to the facile nature of their oxidation states (O.S.), i.e. Cu(0), Cu(I), Cu(II) and Cu(III), and the instability of their O.S. under ambient conditions.35 Thus, Cu and Cu-based NMs easily undergo oxidation and it is challenging to maintain their catalytic activity, selectivity, robustness, and stability during their preparation.15 A decreases in the size of copper materials can increase the active surface area of copper catalysts. The sensitivity of Cu and Cu-based NMs to water, air, and other chelating materials aggregation can change during their preparation. Thus, these problems can be overcome by employing different types of supports such as silica, carbon-based materials, natural biomaterials, polymers, and many more, which can help stabilize the formation of various shapes of Cu and Cu-based NMs.3 The Cu materials have an additional excellent property, i.e., a high boiling point, and thus they can sustain or are compatible with elevated-temperature and -pressure chemical reactions. Also, they can be employed in advanced reactions, including, vapor-phase reactions, microwave-assisted reactions, continuous flow reactions and several organic transformations.
The different structures and properties of Cu materials are the two main factors affecting their catalytic performance compared to that in bulk state, where the exhibit the nano state to single atom state with an increase in surface area and improvement in pore structure and morphologies.36–38 Cu NMs and SACs can significantly improve the efficiency of materials for catalysis (organo- and photocatalytic applications) compared to their bulk materials due to their high surface area-to-volume ratio together with porous structure and morphologies. In general, the large surface area of Cu-NMs and SACs and the presence of a large percentage of unsaturated atoms on their surface, corners, and edges create more active sites, resulting in higher catalytic activity and selectivity. Another important feature of Cu NMs and Cu SACs is their porous structure, where the greater the pore size, the higher the yield. Because NMs have mesopores and macropores, they are capable of passing or diffuse different substituted initial precursor or reagent molecules, while interacting with the active sites without restricting the casting size, leading to the formation of products with better catalytic activity. The effect of the morphology of Cu NMs and Cu SACs plays a critical role in catalytic reactions, where different cluster structures and different shape materials exist. Their catalytic activity depends on the loading of copper; however, a high metal loading favours particle agglomeration and leads to a reduction in surface area, blocked pores, and unwanted phase transformations with a decrease in catalytic performance. In contrast, the smooth surface exhibited by Cu atoms uniformly distributed on a support indicates their boosted catalytic activity.39,40
This review discusses the new sustainable methods for the synthesis of Cu and Cu-based NMs, highlighting their characterization and catalytic applications regarding their highest potential activity and selectivity for photocatalytic and organocatalytic applications. These advanced applications and reported unique properties of Cu and its alloy NMs will be helpful and remain essential in the academic and industrial fields in the future.
2 Scope and focus of this review
To date, different types of nanomaterials and SACs have been explored for advanced applications using diverse characterizations tools.37,41–44 In this review, we highlight the most useful advanced methods for the synthesis of Cu and Cu-based NMs. In the synthetic strategies, we briefly discuss Cu and Cu-based NMs and their properties including catalytic activity, selectivity, surface area, thermal stability, heat conductivity and photoactivity, which can help boost photocatalysis and organic catalysis reactions. Also, the interactions between Cu NMs and SACs with various supports are discussed, which certainly help to stabilise and improve their organocatalytic and photocatalytic activity. The prepared Cu NM catalysts are visualized using characterization tools, helping to understand their excellent properties and mechanistic aspects. Simultaneously, we review a variety of Cu-based NMs for photocatalysis and organic catalysis. Furthermore, Cu-based NMs are explored for advanced catalytic applications and characterization including studies on their coordination environment, composition, size, shape and surface area and synergistic effect. Cu NMs and Cu SACs are actively involved in a wide range of catalytic reactions, such as hydrogenation, cycloaddition, oxidation, miscellaneous, cross-coupling, and photocatalytic reactions including water–gas shift reactions, redox reactions, reduction of alkyne, and oxidation of benzene and pinene (Fig. 1). These advanced applications confirm that Cu NMs and Cu SACs are among the best catalysts in terms of catalytic activity (pharmaceutical and chemical industry), selectivity, and reusability. We also extensively discuss their applications for environmental remediation including the degradation of harmful organic compounds, sensing hazardus gases, dye intermediates, drug intermediates, pesticide intermediates, and other chemicals. Therefore, this review provides adequate knowledge and summarizes the synthesis and applications of Cu NMs, which will be helpful for researchers in multidisciplinary domains, including nanotechnology, organic chemistry, materials chemistry, inorganic chemistry and chemical engineering.

3 Methods for the synthesis of Cu and Cu-based NMs
Different types of methods have been reported in nanotechnology for the synthesis of Cu and Cu-based NMs, including chemical, biological and physical methods (Fig. 2). These methods employ two approaches for the synthesis of NMs. (i) In the bottom-up approach (chemical or biological method), the structure of NMs is fabricated from atoms, molecules or clusters. (ii) In the top-down approach (physical method), a bulk material is reduced to nano or single-atom dimensions through cutting, grinding and etching techniques, i.e., NMs are prepared from larger materials without atomic-level control.51–53

The synthesis process is fundamental for improving the catalytic activity, selectivity, thermal stability and reusability of NMs, which can boost chemical reactions for industrial and pharmaceutical production. However, there are still some challenges in the synthesis of Cu and Cu-based NMs with a desired morphology and maintaining their size and shape simultaneously. This problem can be solved by employing a support, which can enhance the properties of Cu NMs, as discussed in the following section. In the design of NMs with suitable properties, it is essential to control the parameters of the synthetic strategy, resulting in the formation of different shapes of Cu NMs with controllable dimensions. Herein, we discuss the synthesis of Cu NMs using various methods such as ball milling, chemical vapor deposition, flame spray pyrolysis, hydrothermal, solvothermal, impregnation, co-precipitation, green, radiation-induced synthesis, electrochemical, chemical reduction, thermal decomposition, and sonochemical methods. These methods provide the necessary conditions for controlling the size and shape, maintaining the activity, and avoiding the aggregation of Cu NMs via cost-effective routes.
3.1 Ball milling method
Ball milling is one of the most vital approaches utilized in industry for the synthesis NMs, which is also known as mechanical alloying or attrition. In the ball milling method, frictional force is produced due to the collisions among the reactants, resulting in elevated temperature, pressure, and internal energy.54–56 It is extensively used for the production of commercial products such as metallic, clay, and coal powders.57 Ball milling procedures are effectively used for chemical reactions that occur within a short period. The ball milling technique is also employed for the preparation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), boron nitride nanotubes, metal oxide nanocrystals, and desired morphological materials by controlling the experimental parameters.28,29 The preparation of copper-coated graphene nanoplates from copper nitrate and glucose via the ball milling route was reported by He and co-workers (Fig. 3a).58

(b) Fabrication of Pt/CeO2 and Pt–Cu/CeO2 bimetallic NPs in the absence/presence of a sulfate source.63 Reproduced from ref. 63 with permission, Copyright 2013, the American Chemical Society. 
3.2 Radiation-induced method
The radiation-induced method is widely preferred for the preparation of NMs compared to traditional methods. Notably, this method can reduce the amount of metal salts efficiently without using chemical reducing agents in the absence of oxygen and particularly pure and controlled NMs free of side products can be achieved.59,60 During the synthesis of NMs, their size can be optimized by controlling specific parameters. For example, the selection of stabilizer, pH, solvent, metal ion concentration, surfactant, and absorbed dose.61 Various types of ionization sources such as electron beam, X-ray, gamma-ray, and UV light are used for the synthesis of NMs. The radiation source can be selected based on the starting material energy.62 For instance, this strategy was employed for the fabrication of Pt/CeO2 and Pt–Cu/CeO2 bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) from H2PtCl6 and CuCl2 on a CeO2 support in the absence/presence of sulfate (Fig. 3b).63
3.3 Chemical vapor deposition method
The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a technique in which a solid material is reduced to gaseous form via a chemical reaction on the substrate surface, resulting in the development of a thin film deposit.64 Using this method, coatings can be achieved on different types of supporting solid materials, such as powder, NMs, single crystals, and thin films of elemental, metal alloys and amorphous or crystalline compounds of different stoichiometry.57,65–67 The desired NMs can be grown with different properties by changing the experimental parameters including substrate material, substrate temperature, composition of the reaction gas mixture and total gas pressure flow. Accordingly, various NMs and single-atom materials can be prepared via the CVD technique, with high purity and environmentally friendly routes. Utilizing this method, a 3D-graphene-decorated g-C3N4/Cu3P composite was designed for water splitting, and hexagonal Cu3P platelets were obtained via the CVD method (Fig. 4a).48

(b) Preparation of the CuO/ZrO2 catalyst via flame spray pyrolysis.68 Reproduced from ref. 68 with permission, Copyright 2020, Elsevier. 
3.4 Flame spray pyrolysis method
The flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) process is suitable for the fabrication of a wide range of high specific surface area NMs.69,70 The features of materials such as their crystallite size, crystalline phase, degree of aggregation and agglomeration, surface area, and porosity can be controlled using this approach.71–73 Also, composites and heteroatom-doped NPs can be derived by blending different metalloorganic materials before they are fed into the spray nozzle. FSP allows the synthesis of a wide variety of Cu nanostructured metal oxides. A relatively straightforward bottom-up approach to synthesise Cu NMs was reported, where a CuO/ZrO2 catalyst was prepared using Cu and Zr precursors for CO2 hydrogenation via the FSP method (Fig. 4b).68
3.5 Thermal decomposition method
Thermal decomposition involves breaking particles using a heating (thermal) source, which is an important method for the synthesis of inorganic Cu NMs. This method is most frequently used to synthesise stable monodisperse suspensions with the ability to self-assemble.74,75 The metal precursor is first added to a hot solution in the presence of a surfactant or stabiliser for the synthesis of Cu NMs. Simultaneously, the growth of the Cu NMs occurs at a high temperature, which maintains the nucleation of individual atoms, and the whole process is performed under inert conditions.76 The synthesis of metallic Cu NMs using this method is a simple, green, cost-effective, and reproducible process, employing copper salts as the precursor.77–79 This method was employed for the synthesis of cubic Cu3P nanostructures from copper acetate and urea as the precursors, which were employed for water electrolysis (Fig. 5a).80

3.6 Electrochemical method
Electrochemical reduction (ER) is a chemical reaction in which the transfer of electrons occurs from dispersed atoms or molecules at the anode to cathode to produce electricity in an electrochemical system (anode, cathode, and electrolyte solution).82,83 This method is mostly employed for the synthesis of NPs because no stabilizing or surfactant agents and reducing agents are required. Effectively modifying the conductive surface entails adsorption, covalent bond formation, and coating with previously prepared materials.84 The current density, applied potential (constant, pulsed or ramp) and synthesis time play an important role in deciding the shape and size of the resulting nanostructures. In the past few years, NMs have attracted much attention to improve and modify the surface of electrode materials because of their fascinating physicochemical properties, which significantly differ from the corresponding rigid materials.85 For example, NMs possess an excellent surface-to-volume ratio (aspect ratio), electrical and catalytic properties, and large number of adsorption-active sites, making them particularly useful for analytical applications. Han and co-workers developed a g-C3N4/Cu2O NAs/CM catalyst for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2via the electrochemical method (Fig. 5b).81
3.7 Chemical reduction method
The most often reported chemical reduction approach is widely employed owing to its simplicity, low cost, and slightly greener mode of synthesis, employing a natural source as a reducing agent or stabilizer to produce NPs. This method can control the size of the particle by employing certain chemicals, and suitable reducing agents (hydrazine, sodium borohydride ascorbic acid, and sodium phosphinate) also play an important role, where the particle size can be efficiently extended depending on the nature of the surfactant, capping or stabilizer agent such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), ascorbic acid, etc., solvent and supporting materials.86–88 Notably, during this process, the formation of NPs depends on the reaction rate and supporting materials.89 Furthermore, the choice of surfactant or stabiliser is critical given that it influences the stability, solubility, reactivity, stability, dispersibility, and even the size and morphology of the NPs during synthesis. Thus, it is possible to control the size of NPs via the chemical reduction method. Banerjee and co-workers used a chemical reduction-based protocol to prepare red fluorescent copper nanoclusters for the reduction of Ar-NO2 (Fig. 6a).90

3.8 Hydrothermal method
Nowadays, the hydrothermal approach is one of the most commonly used methods for the synthesis of NMs. This strategy possibly reflects chemical precipitation, in which the interior of an autoclave vessel is subjected to elevated temperature to perform the aging step, delivering different types of structure NPs.91,92 In the hydrothermal process, the morphology of the NMs or single crystals is dependent on the solubility of the starting precursor in water (H2O) at high temperature and pressure. The versatility and success of the hydrothermal process result in the formation of microporous materials and solids containing an organized pore structure (size in the range of 4–20 Å). By adjusting the temperature and pressure, this approach can alter the pore size of the precursor.93–95 This protocol was employed for the fabrication of NiCu bimetallic nanoalloys confined in an NiCuN mesoporous nanowires (NWs) array embedded in an NC framework (NC-NiCu-NiCuN) for water splitting by Hou and co-workers (Fig. 6b).49
3.9 Solvothermal method
The solvothermal method has been employed in the laboratory to synthesise various materials including single crystals, zeolites, microporous materials, ionic conductors, complex oxides and fluorides, inorganic–organic mixed materials, and NMs.96–99 The nature of the solvent, temperature and pressure can control the size, shape and crystal growth of NMs and NMs in liquid form can be easily converted into a dry powder.100–102 The synthesis of a Cu1Ni2-N/CFC electrode nanocomposite material using hexamethylene tetramine (HMT), Cu(NO)2·3H2O, and Ni(NO)2·6H2O as precursors via the solvothermal method reported was by Huang and co-workers (Fig. 7a).50

3.10 Impregnation method
Recently, numerous methods have been employed for the fabrication of metal-supported nanocatalysts. Among them, the impregnation method is the most well-known and straightforward strategy for producing supported nanocatalysts for a wide range of heterogeneous processes.103,104 In the impregnation method, there are two routes for the synthesis of NMs, where in the first, a certain amount of precursor in solution form is impregnated on the support material, yielding a thin slurry, which is termed wet impregnation (WI). In the second case, a certain amount of precursor in the gas form is filled in the pore volume of the support, which is termed dry or incipient wetness impregnation (DI).105,106 In these two impregnation routes, some factors affect the as-prepared catalysts such as temperature, pressure and concentration of the precursor. Nowadays, this method has been described for the synthesis of a variety of supported NMs catalysts.107,108 Kim and colleagues used the wet impregnation process to prepare bimetallic Nb-doped Cu/ZPS catalysts for the production of valeric biofuel from levulinic acid (LA) (Fig. 7b).109
3.11 Co-precipitation method
The co-precipitation method is one of the most extensively utilised methods for the synthesis of nanocatalysts, single-component catalysts, mixed catalysts and bulk supported catalyst.110,111 The physical properties of the as-prepared NMs such as their morphology, size distribution, and composition can be controlled via a series of experimental parameters, such as the type and ratio of precursors, surface ligand, reaction temperature, and pH.112–114 The benefits of this method include the uniform distribution of components, low reaction temperature, regular particle length with reduced agglomerated particles, and low-cost.115,116 One of the most noteworthy benefits of the co-precipitation technique is that it can produce water-soluble NPs with good yields almost instantly. Employing this method, Sharma and co-workers fabricated a silica-coated magnetically separable catalyst, Cu@DBM@ASMNPs, which was employed for the A3 coupling of aromatic aldehydes and alkynes-with cyclic amines (Fig. 8a).117

(b) Ultrasonication-based strategy employed for the synthesis of the CuO@CeO2 nanomaterial and its application as a sensor.118 Reproduced from ref. 118 with permission, Copyright 2020, Elsevier. 
3.12 Sonochemical method
Sonochemical synthesis has been efficiently utilized for the production of Cu NMs with various types of morphologies such as spheres, rods, amorphous, discs, wires, and ellipsoids with the help of ultraviolet radiation.119,120 A significant advantage of this methodology is that the structure and size of the Cu NPs can be optimized by adjusting parameters such as ultraviolet frequency, reducing agents, stabilizing agents, and surfactants.121,122 This method can help reduce the reaction time, increase the yield of NPs and avoid the phase transfer of catalysts (PTCs) for the good dispersion of particles. This process was employed for the fabrication the CuO@CeO2 nanomaterial via to enhance the electrochemical detection as a non-enzymatic sensor (Fig. 8b).118
3.13 Green method
The green method has been widely employed to synthesise Cu NPs because it is cost-effective, clean, non-toxic and non-polluting.123,124 This method is followed by the bottom-up approach for the preparation of Cu NPs, while the subsequent step is a redox reaction.125–127 A green source (i.e., plant extract) is used as the reducing agent and stabiliser in the preparation of Cu NPs, which prevents aggregation or avoids the formation of hazardous by-products.128 This method enables environmentally benign reaction conditions to achieve Cu NPs. A Cu/MnO2 nanocomposite was synthesized using Cu salts and Centella asiatica L. leaf extract and utilized for the reduction of organic dyes and nitroarenes (Fig. 9).129

Together with the above-mentioned reported methods, various other strategies have also been used for the fabrication of Cu and Cu-based NPs, and here we simply group these NPs in four categories, as follows: (1) Cu and Cu oxide NPs: another type of inorganic NPs is metallic oxide NPs, which are easily produced via various methods due to the variable oxidation state of the Cu atom, as presented in Table 1. (2) Supported Cu and Cu-based NPs: here support materials can act as a stabiliser and reducing agent and produce a synergistic effect, which are beneficial to prevent the aggregation of NPs and enhance the reaction rate, as presented in Table 2. (3) Bimetallic Cu and Cu-based NPs with supporting material: recently, the synthesis of bimetallic NPs has attracted huge interest because they contain two metals with the same or different proportions and oxidation state, which are especially used in photocatalytic reactions and other reactions due to their enhanced conduction band values, as given in Table 3. (4) Ternary or multi-metallic Cu and Cu-based NPs: currently, ternary Cu NPs are employed in several applications, which show an excellent synergistic effect, are stabilised by other metals and remain stable under different conditions (Table 4).15

4 Applications of Cu and Cu-based NMs
4.1 Organic catalysis by copper and copper-based NMs
Cu and Cu-based NMs have been employed in various chemical transformations such as organocatalytic and photocatalytic reactions.15,282–284 Most organic transformations are processed using Cu NMs because of their high activity, selectivity, surface area and stability under different reactions conditions.285 Cu nanocatalyst-based chemical reactions are advantageous compared to other reported noble metal-catalysed reactions because of the lower catalyst loading, higher efficiency, lower cost, shorter reaction time, and recyclability of the catalyst.286

4.1.1 Reduction reactions. 
The reduction reaction is utilized to increase the number of covalent bonds by adding hydrogen to an unsaturated group (such as CC bond, CO group, CO2, aza group, nitro group, and aromatic ring) and selectively reduces only one group in the presence of additional unsaturated groups in a molecule.287–292 Reduction reactions play an essential role in environmental remediation, such as treating polluted waste effluent and reducing toxic nitro compounds and organic dyes into harmless chemicals.293,294 The unique and active protocols proceed under mild conditions via Cu and Cu-based NMs catalysis for a broad range of reduction reactions for instance hydrogenation and reduction of nitro compounds.295 Some recent articles on Cu-catalyzed reductions reactions are discussed here.
Cu NP-supported WO2.72 nanorods (NRs) were employed for a hydrogenation reaction initiated with ammonia borane (AB) as the reducing agent.296 The prepared Cu NPs (size 7.0 ± 0.4) and WO2.72 NRs were analysed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which exhibited that the Cu NPs possessed a uniform shape and size and the inter-fringe spacing of the WO2.72 NRs was 0.38 nm with an approximate length and width of 80 nm and 6 nm, respectively.
A series of catalysts, i.e., Cu/WO2.72, Cu/C and Cu/SiO2, was fabricated and evaluated for the conversion of 3-nitrostyrene into 3-vinylaniline in the presence of Ar–CC. Among the catalysts, Cu/WO2.72 demonstrated the highest rate of conversion of up to 99% for the chemoselective hydrogenation of the nitro functionality in the presence of AB as a hydrogen source. The synergistic effect in the Cu/WO2.72 NPs between Cu and WO2.72 selectively reduced the –NO2 group and –CC– remained unbroken because the Cu NPs activated only Ar–NO2, not Ar–CC– (Fig. 10a, entries 1–3).296 Similar to the above-mentioned reported catalysts, other bimetallic catalysts including CuNi/SiO2 and CuPd/SiO2 alloy NPs are significantly effective for hydrogen production from AB,297,298 but these catalysts lose their chemoselectivity during the reduction of 3-nitrostyrene (Fig. 10a, entries 4 and 5). The stability test revealed that the interaction between the Cu NPs and WO2.72 enhanced the reaction rate/conversion ratio and selectivity towards the formation of the product and Cu/WO2.72 exhibited excellent stability and chemoselectivity for nitro reduction (Fig. 10b).

Basu and co-workers also reported the high reactivity of Cu NPs, which were explored for a similar application. specifically, they prepared a fluorescent active Cu nanocluster from a copper-embedded cysteine [Cu5(Cys)3] complex synthesized via the chemical reduction method, reducing the nitro functionality.90 The density functional theory (DFT) study confirmed that the Cu NPs stabilised by the interaction between the copper and cysteine molecules resulted in the Cu nanocluster complex of [Cu5(Cys)3] (Fig. 11a).90 The synthesized Cu5(Cys)3 clusters were used for the conversion of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) with sodium borohydride as the reducing agent at RT (Fig. 11b). Interestingly, these nanoclusters exhibited potential catalytic activity for the conversion of Ar–NO2 to Ar–NH2 compounds. Also, besides the organic transformation, they helped to decrease the industrial pollutants without any significant loss in catalytic efficiency.

(b) Hypothetical mechanism for the conversion of 4-NP into 4-AP with a Cu catalyst.90 Reproduced from ref. 90 with permission, Copyright 2018, the American Chemical Society. 
The hydrogenation of biomass was explored by Zhang et al. using hydrotalcite (HTlc)-derived copper (CuxAl) and activated copper (CuxAl-A) catalysts synthesised using different molar ratios of Cu/Al including 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 via the co-precipitation method.299
The developed CuxAl and CuxAl-A exhibited similar activity for the catalytic conversion of furfural (FFR) in methanol as the solvent and hydrogen source to produce furfuryl alcohol (FA) and 2-methyl furan (MF) (Table 5). The commercially available CuO and CuxAl-based nanocomposites exhibited excellent conversion towards FFR (Table 5, entries 1 to 5). Among them, the catalytic activity of the Cu2Al catalyst was shown to be the best for the conversion of FA (54.7%) and MF (4.7%) from FFR because Cu exists in the Cu2+ oxidation state and decomposition of the methanol solvent generated hydrogen to reduce Cu2+ to Cu0in situ, where Cu0 acts as an active centre for the hydrogenation of FFR. In contrast, the lower loading of Cu in Cu1Al was not sufficient for the hydrogenation of FFR, while the a higher loading of Cu (Cu3Al and Cu4Al) also could not facilitate the hydrogenation of FFR. The CuxAl-A series of catalysts (Table 5, entries 6 to 9) was demonstrated to be favourable for the hydrogenation of FFR, significantly enhancing the yield of MF. The Cu0 species (Cu3Al-A) was the most active for the conversion of FFR to MF due to its higher amount of acid sites and rapidly produced hydrogen due to the decomposition of methanol (Table 5, entry 8).

The catalytic activity of Cu3Al-A was explored towards the hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to dimethylfuran (DMF) using methanol as the solvent under different conditions (Table 6). The temperature play an important role in the hydrogenation of HMF to increase the yield of DMF (Table 6, entries 1 to 5). Thus, low temperature affected the selectivity for the formation of DMF and other intermediates such as 5-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl furan were observed. It was reported that at a higher temperature and dosage, Cu3Al-A NMs delivered an excellent yield and product formation rate (PFR) for DMF, whereas in the case of a lower temperature and dosage, provided a low yield and PFR (Table 6, entries 6 and 7, respectively).

The selective hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbon by Pt–Cu catalysts, namely, the hydrogenation of olefins using the Pt–Cu frame@HKUST-1 catalyst prepared from CuCl2·6H2O and H2PtCl6·6H2O, was reported by Che and co-workers.300 The core–shell Pt–Cu alloys possessed an octahedron and flower-like well-defined structure with elemental mapping of Pt and Cu (Fig. 12a–d). Here, Pt and Cu were equally distributed throughout the solid materials with elemental mapping of Pt, Cu, Fe, C, and O (Fig. 12e and h).

The fabricated catalysts exhibited distinct catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of hex-1-ene to hexane for different times at 50 °C (Table 7). Among them (Table 7, entries 1 to 5), the performance of the core–shell Pt–Cu frame@HKUST-1 resulted in excellent yields and a higher turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) compared to the “naked” Pt–Cu alloy (Table 7, entry 5). This catalyst showed considerable stability for up to four runs without loss in activity; meanwhile, the size and dispersion of the Pt–Cu frame catalysts were maintained.

Furthermore, the catalytic activity of octahedron Pt–Cu and octahedron Pt–Cu frame@HKUST-1 was evaluated for diverse substrates such as hex-1-ene, (Z)-cyclooctene, and ethenylbenzene with selected distinct molecular sizes. The octahedron Pt–Cu frame@HKUST-1 showed excellent conversions of hex-1-ene (89%) and (Z)-cyclooctene (76%), which were better than that by octahedron Pt–Cu alloy (68%) (Fig. 13a and c). The hexane and cyclooctane yields confirmed that the HKUST-1 shell was not affected by the distribution of hex-1-ene (4.3 Å) and (Z)-cyclooctene (5.5 Å). Surprisingly, the octahedron Pt–Cu alloy revealed significantly higher activity (ca. 42% at 90 °C) for the hydrogenation of ethenylbenzene than the Pt–Cu frame@HKUST-1 structure (ca. 3%). This can be attributed to the bigger size of ethenylbenzene (6.5 Å) in comparison to the pore diameter of HKUST-1 (6.0 Å) (Fig. 13d).

In another report, the reduction of substituted nitroarene to aniline was successful achieved using Cu2O cube catalysts and AB as a reducing agent. Different forms of Cu2O nanocrystals such as Cu2O cubes, Cu2O octahedra and Cu2O rhombic dodecahedra were prepared via the sonochemical method and successfully utilized for the reduction of nitroarene.47 The structures of the as-prepared Cu2O cubes, Cu2O octahedra, and Cu2O rhombic dodecahedra with sharp faces and the randomly dispersed in Cu2O catalyst were not affected during the reduction of nitroaniline (Fig. 14a–f). Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images indicated that the Cu2O single crystals existed in the form of cubes and octahedra and the polycrystalline Cu2O as rhombic dodecahedra (Fig. 14g–i, respectively). AB (NH3·BH3) was employed as a reductant for the reduction of Cu2O to Cu crystals and a hydrogen source for the conversion of nitroaniline to 1,4-diaminobenzene in ethanol solvent (Table 8).47 The catalytic performance of the Cu2O cubes, Cu2O octahedra and Cu2O rhombic dodecahedra nanocrystals resulted in the good conversion of nitroaniline to 1,4-diaminobenzene (entries 1 to 3, respectively).

The catalytic activity of the Cu2O cube nanocrystals was evaluated via the reduction reaction for nitroarene substrates bearing different types of substituents at 30 °C for 25 min (Fig. 15).47 The Cu2O cubes showed versatility for the reduction reaction with nitroarene bearing electron-donating and withdrawing groups such as –NH2, –OH, –OCOR, –Cl, –Br, and –CHO, delivering good product yields and minimum by-products. However, in this case, commercial Cu2O powder generated a low product yield and traces of by-products.

Another report on the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons to the desired hydrocarbons, which is a crucial industrial reaction, was presented by Huang et al., employing copper nanodiamond-graphene (atomically dispersed Cu denoted as Cu1ND@G and Cu-cluster denoted as CunND@G) for the hydrogenation of acetylene.301 Graphene shells with numerous defects were generated during the annealing of ND (Fig. 16a). The HAADF-STEM images of the Cu1/ND@G confirmed the presence of Cu single atoms (bright illustrated circle) (Fig. 16b–d); however, in the case of CunND@G, the Cu species were dominated by Cu-cluster, with a very small portion of Cu (0.25%) species atomically dispersed (Fig. 16e and f).

The catalytic performance of Cu1/ND@G and Cun/ND@G resulted in the selective semi-hydrogenation of ethyne to ethene. Herein, the catalytic conversion and selectivity were controlled by temperature (Fig. 17a). For the Cun/ND@G species, the change was still < 20% even at 200 °C. In contrast, the Cu1/ND@G species delivered remarkably a high conversion yield (95%) and selectivity (98%) at 200 °C. Notably, the activity of Cu1/ND@G exhibited a better TOF of 0.0017 (4.25-times efficient compared to Cun/ND@G) and a higher yield of ethylene (Fig. 17b). According to (Fig. 17c) the activation energy values (Ea) of Cu1/ND@G and Cun/ND@G, the atomically Cu species dispersed highly contributed to the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the Cu1ND@G catalysts were found to exhibit excellent stability for 60 h (Fig. 17d).

Stylianou and co-workers synthesized Cu0 NPs via the reduction of the (Cu2[(BO)(OH)2](OH)3) synthetic mineral in the presence of AB (NH3·BH3), and simultaneously utilized the in situ-produced hydrogen for the conversion of nitroarene to aniline (Fig. 18a and b).302 The synthetic mineral consisted of cuboid-shaped single crystals, indicating the formation of Cu0 NPs before and after the reaction, while the size of the Cu0 NPs was in the range of 20–40 nm after the reaction was complete.302 The in situ-prepared Cu0 NPs demonstrated catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline in a mixture of MeOH and H2O at 25 °C (Fig. 18c). Further, the Cu0 NPs catalysed the conversion of 1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene to 4-nitroaniline, which is an intermediate commonly used in the production of herbicides, drugs and laboratory reagents. The conversion of 1,3-dinitrobenzene to benzene-1,3-diamine is utilized in the manufacture of azo dyes. Pyridin-3-amine is an important component for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals products.

The in situ-generated Cu0 NPs maintained almost the same catalytic activity as that of their original state for at least five reaction cycles. Thus, the in situ-generated Cu0 NPs showed excellent activity, good stability, and avoided the oxidation and aggregation of the catalyst compared to Cu catalysts.
Several metal oxide-based Cu NPs have been employed for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds to the equivalent aromatic amine compounds. In this regard, Cu/MnO2 NPs were synthesized via the biological method using CuCl2·2H2O and Centella asiatica L. leaf extract and their application explored for the hydrogenation of nitro compounds.129
The catalytic activity of the as-prepared Cu/MnO2 catalysts was explored in the hydrogenation of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) to 2,4-diaminophenylhydrazine (DAPH) and 4-nitrophenol (NP) to 4-aminophenol (AP) in the presence of NaBH4 (acts as an electron donor) at room temperature (Fig. 19a). Even some organic dyes such as rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR) are efficiently reduced by Cu/MnO2 NPs.129 In the mechanistic pathway, the starting molecules (4-NP) and NaBH4 adsorb on the surface of the Cu/MnO4 nanocomposite through physical adsorption, and then the electrophilic 4-nitrophenolate ion accepts an electron from NaBH4 and hydrogenation takes place to release the 4-AP product (Fig. 19b). The Cu/MnO2 NPs exhibited superior catalytic activity compared to other Cu NPs for the hydrogenation of nitro compounds.303,304

An important study on the semi hydrogenation of acetylene catalyzed by a single atom was reported by Shi et al.305 Cu/Al2O3 catalysts with different particle sizes were synthesized using copper(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate hydrate as the precursor and spherical alumina powder as the support at 250 °C for one cycle, resulting in the formation of the Cu1 SAC (0.5Cu/Al2O3) via the ALD method.305 The performance of Cu ALD at 300 °C for 1, 3, and 5 cycles using samples with distinct sizes and loading, i.e., 0.8Cu/Al2O3, 1.5Cu/Al2O3, and 2.0Cu/Al2O3, was evaluated. HAADF-STEM was employed to characterize the morphology of the catalysts with different loadings of Cu. 0.5Cu/Al2O3 was shown to possess Cu atoms evenly distributed on the Al2O3 support without the formation of any NPs and clusters (Fig. 20a–c), revealing that the Cu single atoms on the Al2O3 support have higher stability in an H2 environment below 300 °C. The synthesised Cu/Al2O3 catalysts were examined for the semi-hydrogenation of ethyne in excess ethene. The 0.5Cu/Al2O3, 0.8Cu/Al2O3, 1.5Cu/Al2O3, and 2.0Cu/Al2O3 catalysts achieved ∼100% acetylene conversion at 188 °C, 184 °C, 180 °C, and 179 °C respectively (Fig. 20d). The selectivity of the 0.5Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was shown to be 91% for the semi hydrogenation of acetylene because of the smaller size of its Cu particles (Fig. 20e). Notably, quick deactivation of the 2.0Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was observed compared to the 0.5Cu/Al2O3 catalyst because of the larger Cu particle size of ∼9.3 nm in the 2.0Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, while the decrease in the Cu particle size significantly retarded the deactivation in the 0.5Cu/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 20f).305

The catalytic performance for the semi-hydrogenation of ethyne is strongly dependent on the ethene selectivity, which at near complete conversion, increased from 84% to 91% by reducing the Cu size to single atoms.305
In recent years, biomass hydrogenation reactions have attracted great attention and interest from scientists because of their wide potential applications. Accordingly, the Cu@C-POP catalyst was prepared for the conversion of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) to 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF).306 The catechol-functionalised porous organic polymer (C-POP) was synthesized via the Friedel–Crafts-assisted template-free condensation polymerization of catechol with FeCl3 and C3H8O2 (dimethoxymethane). Subsequently, the chemical reactions of Cu NPs and Cu(OAc)2·H2O with HCO2NH4 and CuCl2·2H2O with NaBH4 delivered the Cu@C-POP-A and Cu@C-POP-B catalysts, respectively.306 The Cu@C-POP-A catalyst possessed a capsule-like morphology and Cu-NPs were randomly located on the exterior of the C-POP nanosphere surface, where the width of a single Cu capsule was 21.58 nm with Cu0 NPs (Fig. 21a and b). The Cu@C-POP-B catalyst exhibited NPs distributed over the C-POP surface with a size approximately in the range of 9.5–27 nm with Cu2O species (Fig. 21c and d). The selective performance of the Cu@C-POP-A and Cu@C-POP-B catalysts was demonstrated for the hydrogenation of 5-HMF to DHMF in ethanol at 20 bar H2 pressure and 150 °C for 10 h (Fig. 21e). The catalytic conversion and selectivity of 5-HMF to DHMF gradually decreased with the formation of side products for the Cu@C-POP-A catalyst (Fig. 21f). In contrast, a steady increase in the conversion of 5-HMF to DHMF was observed for the Cu@C-POP-B catalyst (Fig. 21g), which exhibited superior selectivity because its atomically Cu species consisted of copper ions and Cu2O species on its surface with Cu vacancies, stabilizing the transition state and lowering the energy barrier.306

4.1.2 Oxidation reactions. 
Oxidation reactions involve the addition of oxygen (removal of hydrogen from) to organic molecules to produce value-added products, which are employed in both the academic and industrial fields.307–309 There are many reported catalysts, including Cr, Mn, Pd, Pt, Co, Rh, for the oxidation reaction.32,310–314 However, they generate toxic and hazardous products and are difficult to remove from the reaction mixture. In addition, some noble metal catalysts require additional ligands to begin the reaction. Accordingly, Cu and Cu-based NPs have been efficiently applied for oxidation reactions to overcome the disadvantages of transition metal-based catalysts,315,316 and some of the latest advantages of Cu and Cu-based NMs are summarised here.
Recently, Gawande and co-workers reported the oxidative amidation of carboxylic acid using a CuO/HMS nanomaterial.317 They prepared hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS)-embedded CuO NPs via the sol–gel method and TEM images confirmed that the CuO NPs were uniformly distributed on the surface of HMS (Fig. 22a–d). The catalytic activity of the 2.5% CuO/HMS catalyst was investigated for the oxidative amidation of various substituted carboxylic acids with tert-butyl hydroperoxide as the radical initiator (Fig. 22e).

The production of the TBHP radical on CuO/HMS NPs is one of the proposed catalytic mechanisms. The TBHP radical acts as an initiator in the reaction on the Cu(II) catalyst, where benzoic acid (BA) and DMF produce carboxylate radical A or form carboxylate C, reacting with amidyl radical B to form the carbamic anhydride D intermediate, which then undergoes decarboxylation to produce aromatic amides. Among the several fabricated catalysts, the 2.5% CuO-loaded HMS the best catalytic activity and selectivity towards product formation without any side reactions. Furthermore, the environmentally benign CuO/HMS was easily recovered by centrifugation after the reaction/transformation (Fig. 23).317

Zhao and co-workers used a co-impregnation approach to produce alumina (Al2O3)-supported Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.318 The HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 24a and b) of the reduced 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst showed an individual white spot of Pt on the Cu NPs and also confirmed the presence of Pt (red colour) single atoms on the Cu NPs (green line), as clearly illustrated in the coloured map image (Fig. 24c).

C–H activation was examined using different types of catalysts including Pt NPs, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu NPs for deuterated propane (C3H7D). The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst showed functional C–H activation at 204 °C (Fig. 24d). The catalytic activity and selectivity of Pt/Cu SAA showed a superior performance compared Pt NPs from the initial and final period at 520 °C and 550 °C during 12 h for PDH (Fig. 24e). The 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst showed good specific activity and deactivation rate at 550 °C (Fig. 24f). CO was adsorbed on the surface of the Pt atom even after a long time based on the fact that there were no changes in the structure of the catalyst and the PDH reaction still proceeded on the individual Pt single atoms dispersed on the Cu NPs, with stability for 120 h on stream at 520 °C (Fig. 24g).
Tanabe and colleagues used an impregnation approach to study the oxidation of toluene with varying Cu loadings in CunOx using a fourth-generation (G4) phenylazomethine dendrimer with a tetraphenylmethane core (DPAG4) on zirconia (ZrO2).319 The HAADF-STEM images of Cu12Ox and Cu28Ox sub-nanoparticles (SNPs) (Fig. 25a and b) showed that they possessed diameters of 0.76 and 0.95 nm (Fig. 25d and e), respectively. The Cu60Ox SNPs possessed a particle size of 1.46 nm and a somewhat bigger size distribution of ±0.40 nm (Fig. 25c–f) due to the low acidity of 60 equivalent of CuCl2 species.

The catalytic oxidation of toluene was performed on CunOx@DPAG4/ZrO2 in an oxygen atmosphere (1 MPa) at 443 K for 5 h in a solvent-free reaction (Fig. 26a). According to the TON (40206), the Cu12Ox SNPs provided a significant yield of benzaldehyde (58.1%–62.1% selectivity) compared other catalysts, as shown in Fig. 26b and c. The smaller size of the Cu12Ox SNPs increased the activation; therefore, the Cu–O bond required a low dissociation energy. The catalytic activity of the Cu12Ox SNPs was investigated with o- and p-methoxytoluene, delivering better yields than with m-methoxytoluene, which stabilized the benzylic radical by the o-and p-methoxy groups and also enhanced the rate of the reaction (Fig. 26d and e).

The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added chemicals and fuels via green methods has received significant attention in recent years, but it is still difficult due to the inert nature of CO2. Lui and co-workers reported the preparation of mesoporous carbon nitride-based single atom Cu catalysts (Cu-CN-x) using varying equimolar concentrations of CuCl2 and carbon nitride (CN) and investigated their application for the carboxylation of alkynes.320 The HAADF-STEM images confirmed the formation of Cu single-atom species (yellow circle) dispersed on mesoporous C3N4 (pore size of 40 nm) with a high density (Fig. 27a and b) together with the elemental mapping image (Fig. 27c).

Previously reported catalysts were compared with the Cu-CN-x nanocatalyst for the catalytic carboxylation of the terminal alkyne at 80 °C for 10 h (Fig. 28a). Among them, the Cu-CN-8.0 catalyst produced excellent yields of phenylpropiolic acid (97%) and a high TOF of 9.7 h−1. The greater number of Cu atoms embedded in the Cu-CN-26.6 catalyst reduced the catalytic interactions with the reactant. In contrast, the Cu-CN-8.0 catalyst demonstrated good catalytic activity with an excellent yield for various types of substrates having electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents (Fig. 28b). The Cu-CN-8.0 catalyst was reused five times without discernible loss in its stability and activity.

Han et al. designed copper nanoclusters deposited on HKUST-1 thin films (Cu-HKUST-1) via the CVD and PVD method, which were employed for the oxidation of methanol.321 The Cu-HKUST-1 synthesised from SiO2/Si(100) wafers was used to grow the substrate Cu pellets and H3BTC via an e-beam evaporator and thermal evaporator for different HKUST-1. After Cu was deposited for 5 cycles on HKUST-1, 4 ML Cu-HKUST-1 (4–6 nm Cu clusters) and 8 ML Cu-HKUST-1 (8–12 nm Cu clusters) were obtained.321 The TEM images of Cu-HKUST-1 (4 ML and 8 ML) catalysts clearly revealed the presence of round-shaped embedded Cu NPs in the thin films (∼40 nm) (Fig. 29a and b). The as-prepared catalysts were evaluated for the oxidation of methanol in a high vacuum system. In particular, the 4 ML Cu-HKUST-1 catalyst was shown to selectively deliver formaldehyde from the oxidation of methanol, while the 8 ML Cu-HKUST-1 catalyst strongly oxidized methanol to formaldehyde with the formation of CO2 and H2 gas as side products (Fig. 29c). Consequently, as shown by the bar graph, a higher production of HCO2 (95%) and relatively less production of CO2 (53%) and H2 (57%) gas was catalysed by 4 ML Cu-HKUST-1 due to the smaller size of its Cu clusters compared to 8 ML Cu-HKUST-1 (Fig. 29d).

The oxidation of benzene to phenol under feasible conditions was reported by Zhou et al., who fabricated an edge-rich S and N dual-decorated Cu single-atom catalyst (Cu SAC/S–N) via the cation exchange strategy.322 The as-prepared Cu SAC/S–N catalyst was prepared using CdS NRs with a diameter of 53.9 nm and CuCl as the precursors. The characterization by HAADF-STEM showed that the catalyst was made up of hollow carbon nanotubes (microscale length and diameter of 60 nm) (Fig. 30a and b) with Cu single-atoms trapped in the polymer CNTs (Fig. 30c and d). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed that C, N, S and Cu elements were homogenously dispersed in the catalyst (Fig. 30e). The catalytic performance of the Cu SAC/S–N catalyst for the selective conversion (42.3%) of benzene to phenol (93.4%) at RT for 24 h was compared to that with other reported catalysts (Fig. 30f). Because the Cu SAC/S–N catalyst possessed N and Cu species, and S could lower the energy barrier. Furthermore, it was noted that there was no significant drop in the selective conversion of benzene and phenol compared to the other catalysts after 3 cycles (Fig. 30g).322

4.1.3 Coupling reactions. 
Generally, coupling reactions occur between an organometallic reagent with organic halide in the presence of a noble or non-noble metal catalyst.323 To date, different types of coupling reactions have been reported, such as the Heck, Suzuki, Kumada, Stille, Negishi and Sonogashira reactions for C–C bond formation, and common metals are used in this field, besides Zn, Ni, Cu, B, and Sn as activator catalysts.21,324–328 Some of the reported reactions are air- and water-sensitive, but a few reactions can be performed in aqueous medium. Therefore, in recent years, Cu NPs have become the preferred catalyst for coupling reactions due to their reliable, cost-efficient, and benign nature compared to noble metals and noble metal-based catalysts.329 In the following section, some recently reported C–C coupling reactions catalysed by Cu NPs are summarized.
Park and co-workers employed the impregnation approach for the synthesis of mesoporous silica (m-SiO2)-supported Cu2O as an egg-shell nanocatalyst and investigated its application in C–C coupling reactions.179 The prepared SiO2 nanospheres possessed an average diameter of 305 ± 10 nm and m-SiO2 egg shell (size 65 nm) (Fig. 31a and b). The elemental mapping of the catalyst clearly confirmed that copper was uniformly decorated on silica (Fig. 31c–f). The catalytic activity of the Cu2O/SiO2 egg-shell nanocatalyst was explored for the Sonogashira coupling reaction, where, for example, the reaction between benzoyl chloride and phenylacetylene with triethylamine (Et3N) produced 1,3-diphenyl-2-propyn-1-one (ynones) at 80 °C for 12 h under solvent-free conditions (Fig. 31g). Most of the substrates resulted in good conversions (66%–100%) and selectivity (85%–100%) despite the presence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents. The Cu2O/SiO2 egg-shell catalyst had a high surface area, narrow pore size distribution, effective space and catalytically active surface in its structure to activate substrates and also act as a drug delivery system.179

The benign synthesis of 2-alkynyl N-heterocycles (substituted pyrrolidines/piperidines) was achieved using fabricated hierarchically porous mixed oxide sheet-like copper-aluminium (CuAl-MO) NCs via thermal decomposition.330 The effective catalytic activity of CuAl-MO the NCs was investigated towards the synthesis of 2-alkynyl-substituted pyrrolidines/piperidines (80%–95%) with a variety of substrates such as a primary amine, alkyne and chloro-substituted ketone at 60 °C (Fig. 32). The catalyst could be recycled at a minimum of five times while retaining its catalytic activity.

In recent decades, researchers have focused on the synthesis of N-arylated azoles such as arylpyrroles, arylpyrazoles, arylimidazoles, arylindoles, and arylcarbazoles due to their importance in the pharmaceutical and materials fields. The CTSN/Fe3O4-Cu nanocomposite was fabricated using chitosan (CTSN), iron oxide and copper acetate as precursors for the synthesis of N-arylimidazole.331 The optimized catalytic activity of the CTSN/Fe3O4-Cu catalyst with the assistance of ultrasound was also investigated via the C–N coupling reaction in DMF at RT for 10 min (Fig. 33). This catalyst was further evaluated for various substituted electron-donating (–Me, –OMe, and –OH) and electron-withdrawing groups (–Cl, –COMe, –NC, and –NO2) of aryl iodide or bromide with imidazole, producing N-arylimidazole (82%–98%) in excellent yields. The reaction pathway of the C–N coupling reaction proceeds through oxidative addition and reductive elimination, resulting in the formation of the desired product. Due the synergistic effect between the synthesized CTSN/Fe3O4-Cu nanocatalyst and ultrasound waves, the C–N coupling was completed within 10 min.331 The catalyst was quickly recovered after the reaction because of the presence of the magnetic Fe3O4 in the CTSN/Fe3O4-Cu nanocomposite and reused effectively seven times without a significant decline in its catalytic activity.331

Gulati et al. synthesized reduced a graphene oxide-supported copper oxide (RGO@CuO) nanocatalyst via the impregnation process.152 Different weight ratios of malachite (MC) mineral to graphene oxide (GO) followed by calcination provided the corresponding RGO@CuO-1, RGO@CuO-2, RGO@CuO-3, and RGO@CuO-4 nanocatalysts. Among them, the RGO@CuO-2 nanocatalyst was considered the best performing and dominant nanocatalyst, which was also compared with only CuO NPs.152 The surface morphology and elemental mapping of the RGO@CuO-2 nanocomposite were studied via TEM and SEM-EDX, respectively (Fig. 34a–f). The RGO@CuO-2 nanocatalyst was used for tandem coupling, and subsequently decarboxylative C(sp3)–H activation of proline amino acid with different types of aldehydes and alkynes to α-alkynylated N-substituted pyrrolidines under benign reaction conditions (Fig. 34g).

The advantages of the RGO@CuO-2 catalyst included the minimal generation of waste, good mass efficiency reaction, and the ability to reuse the catalyst up to five times.152
The potential biological applications of 1,2,3-triazole compounds are due to their biological activities including antiallergic, antibiotic, anticarcinogenic, and antibacterial, which can also be utilised as HIV agents and for the preparation of natural products, fungicides, and functional materials for applications such as molecular recognition, chemical sensing, and herbicides.
The preparation of a supramolecular ensemble of perylene bisimide (PBI 2): Cu2O–Ag NPs via the wet chemical method was developed by Bhalla and co-workers.332 The TEM image clearly displayed the spherical NPs of the supramolecular ensemble of PBI 2: Cu2O–Ag NPs and the HRTEM image showed an isolated set of Cu2O and Ag NPs (Fig. 35a and b), respectively. The supramolecular ensemble of PBI 2: Cu2O–Ag NPs exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the synthesis of monosubstituted and disubstituted triazoles and isatin/coumarin derivatives from substituted alkynes and aliphatic halides (Fig. 35c). In all cases, excellent yields were obtained without any side products.

Coelho and co-workers reported the preparation of a Cu(II)-TBD on polystyrene and Cu2O/CS-Fe3O4 magnetic nanocomposite catalyst using PS-TBD, Cu(AcO)2 and FeCl3.333 The catalytic activity of the Cu2O/CS-Fe3O4 NCs was examined for the synthesis of substituted 1-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazoles (79%–87%) via a Chan–Lam azidation/copper alkyne–azide cycloaddition/Suzuki reaction (Fig. 36).

The one-pot reactions proceeded in three sequential steps on three different types of metal catalysts (Cu2+, Cu+1, and Pd0) immobilized on different supports (PS-TDB, CS-Fe2O3 and SiO2) (Fig. 37). In the tricatalytic system, all the catalyst could be easily removed and recovered from the reaction system.

Due to the biological importance of nitrogen-containing aryl compounds and their use as precursors in the materials chemistry and pharmaceutical fields, N-arylation reactions and improving the methodologies for their production in a greener way are still necessary. N-arylation reactions were explored on a porous cobalt-/copper-doped carbon (MC-81) nanohybrid via the pyrolysis method.334 The as-synthesised MC-81 nanohybrid was prepared using Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 4,4′-sulfonyldibenzoic acid (H2SDBA) to obtain a sulfonyl-amide based metal–organic framework (TMU-81). Subsequently, a mixture of TMU-81 and Cu(NO3)2·6H2O was poured in a ceramic boat and pyrolyzed at 800 °C for 10 h to obtain MC-81-1 (Cu 8.2% and Co 32.9%), MC-81-2 (Cu 27.4% and Co 32.3%), and MC-81-3 (Cu 30.7% and Co 33.55%).334 The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images showed that after the carbonization of TMU-81, it lost its octahedron morphology and formed a cubic shape with the development of textured porous carbon and several tiny Co/Cu NPs (Fig. 38a, b and d). The Co, Cu, C, N, and S elements were uniformly distributed on the MC-81 cage shell (Fig. 38c). The catalytic activity of MC-81-1, MC-81-2 and MC-81-3 was investigated via the Ullmann cross-coupling reaction using different substituted aryl halides with aniline to obtain N-arylated aniline (Fig. 38e). The yield of N-arylated aniline was dependent on the substituted electron-donating or withdrawing on aromatic starting precursor. The MC-81 catalysts showed excellent stability with consecutive five-run reusability without loss of their activity.334

4.1.4 Miscellaneous reactions. 
Besides the above-mentioned organic transformations, Cu and Cu-based NPs have been employed for other several advanced and important reactions, including the conversion of aryl-CN to aryl-CHO,335,336 synthesis of tetrazole amino acid,337 synthesis of polysubstituted oxazole,338 synthesis of xanthene derivatives,339 conversion of aliphatic carboxylic acids to linear olefins340 and transformation of LA to high-yield valeric acid.109 Some selected Cu-based catalysed reactions are discussed in this section.
Cu NPs (7–35 nm) were prepared using Plantago asiatica plant extract via the green method for the cyanation of aldehydes.335 The catalytic activity of the Cu NPs was demonstrated for the conversion of aryl aldehyde to aryl nitrile using the non-toxic K4Fe(CN)6 as the CN source,335 giving an excellent yield of products (85%–93%). Specially, the Cu NPs catalysed the reaction to give good yields of biologically active heterocycle products such as 4-pyridinecyanide (85%) and 3-pyridinecyanide (87%). Compared with the reported cyanation, this method provides various advantages, namely, straightforward work-up procedure, mild reaction conditions, solvent-free conditions, elimination of ligand, and shorter reaction time with higher yield.335
The Fe3O4@-SiO2@CPTMS@AT@Cu nanocatalyst was designed using Fe3O4 magnetic NPs, CuCl2 and support materials.337 The obtained Cu nanocatalyst was used for the preparation of tetrazoles via the reaction between amino acid with triethyl orthoformate and sodium azide. The catalytic activity of the Fe3O4@-SiO2@CPTMS@AT@Cu nanocatalyst was evaluated for converting substituted amino acids to obtained tetrazole-substituted amino acids, resulting in excellent yields (89%–97%) (Fig. 39a). The suggested mechanism for the formation of tetrazole-substituted amino acids on the Fe3O4@-SiO2@CPTMS@AT@Cu nanocatalyst is shown in Fig. 39b. After the reaction, the Cu nanocatalyst could be quickly separated and reused again for the next reaction, which clearly indicates that this catalyst is sturdy and stable.

Dutta et al. synthesized the Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 nanocatalyst via co-precipitation and sol–gel impregnation followed by metalation.338 This catalyst was exploited for the oxidative cyclization of amines and β-ketoesters, resulting in excellent yields of oxazole moieties (45%–100%) (Fig. 40a). However, bulky substituents resulted in a slight decrease in the conversion percentage of the product because of the steric effect, as shown in the hypothetical mechanism (Fig. 40b). This methodology can not only be applied for industrial purposes, but is operationally facile and cost-effective compared to its literature counterparts. High atom economy, outstanding TON, eco-friendly reaction conditions, and adaptability to gram-scale synthesis are some of the benefits of the Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 nanocatalyst.

Luterbacher and team reported the use of silica-alumina-supported Cu NPs for the catalytic synthesis of linear olefins from biomass-derived aliphatic carboxylic acids via hydrogenation/dehydration reactions.340 Notably, in the silica-alumina supported Cu NPs (Cu/Si–Al), Cu behaves as a mild hydrogenation catalyst, and the acid sites of silica–alumina can lead to dehydration reactions (Fig. 41a). The catalyst surface was studied through TPD (temperature-programmed desorption) and FTIR, where it was observed that the selectivity switch was ensued due to the presence of carboxylic acids on the surface of the catalyst, which inhibited the binding and subsequent over-hydrogenation of olefins (Fig. 41b–d).340

In another report, Kim and co-workers reported the preparation of an Nb-doped Cu supported on Zr-doped porous silica (Nb-Cu/ZPS) catalyst in aqueous medium.109 The surface of ZPS was not coated with the Cu NPs, whereas for 4Nb-40Cu/ZPS, the surface of ZPS was extensively covered by Cu NPs, as shown in Fig. 42a. This catalyst was the most effective for the transformation of glucose to LA via acid-catalysed hydrolysis through HMF, followed by the conversion of LA to γ-valerolactone (GVL), and GVL to VA by ring-opening using hydrogenation (Fig. 42b). The direct synthesis of valeric acid from levulinic acid was performed using the bimetallic Nb-Cu/ZPS catalyst. Due to the synergistic effect of bimetallic nanocomposites herein, the ZPS support and Nb2O5 act as Lewis acid and Brønsted acid sites and the metallic Cu0 sites were beneficial for the hydrogenation, ring-opening, and ring cyclization reactions to convert VA from LA in aqueous medium. This process is vital for the production of sustainable and cost-effective biofuel from lignocellulosic biomass. In this section, the reaction intermediates formed in reactions involving partial LA conversion include GVL, α-angelica lactone (α-AL), 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (4-HPA), and 3-pentanoic acid (3-PEA). The direct conversion of LA to VA entails many steps, which are influenced by a variety of factors such as concentration and species of acidic sites, the availability of metallic sites for hydrogenation, solvent polarity, and reaction parameters (e.g., pressure, temperature, and catalyst-feed ratio). The Lewis acid sites in ZPS enhance the adsorption of LA on the catalyst, and the metallic Cu0 and Nb2O5 sites have Lewis acidity and Brønsted acidity, aiding the catalysis of the cascade hydrogenation, ring-opening, and ring cyclization reactions to obtain VA from LA.341–343 In this bimetallic Nb-Cu/ZPS catalyst, the incorporation of Zr in the porous silica structure may result in the formation of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the support, which can improve the adsorption force of carbonyl-containing substrates (>CO) in coordination with unsaturated Zr4+ ions. Additionally, the doped Nb as a support for the Cu NPs not only creates acidic Brønsted sites in contact with water molecules, but also contributes to reducing the leaching of Cu and aggregation of the Cu NPs during the reaction.344–350 Additionally, the bimetallic Nb-Cu/ZPS catalyst effectively converted VA to various valeric esters in C1–C5 alcohol media (Fig. 43). The presence of Nb2O5 effectively eliminated metal leaching and coke formation, which are significant problems in the liquid-phase conversion of highly acidic LA in the course of the reaction.

In another report, Wei and co-workers synthesized a Pt single-atom catalyst supported on copper-mixed metal oxide (Pt/Cu-MMO) via the calcination of hydrotalcite precursor (CuMgAl-LDH) with Cu-MMO and galvanic replacement reaction with the Pt atom of tetrachloroplatinous acid (H2PtCl4).351 The Cu NPs were evenly distributed on the MMO support, as evidenced by the HRTEM images of the Cu-MMO sample and the lattice spacing (Cu NPs and MMO) (Fig. 44a and b). In the enlarged image of the PtCu-SAA catalyst, it can clearly be seen that isolated Pt atoms are dispersed on the surface of the Cu NPs (Fig. 44c and d). However, in the case of Pt-MMO, Pt nanocrystals and Pt atom were observed. The catalytic activity and selectivity of Cu-MMO, Pt-MMO, and Pt/Cu-SAA were investigated for the conversion of 1,2-propanediol from glycerol under benign conditions (200 °C and 2.0 MPa of H2 pressure).

Among them (Fig. 45a and b), the Pt/Cu-SAA sample was reported to exhibit the best conversion (99.6%) and selectivity (99.2%) (Fig. 45c) due to the single Pt atoms, which promoted the breakage of the central C–H bond and dissociation adsorption of the terminal C–O bond on the adjacent Cu atom. The intrinsic catalytic activity and synergistic effect of both the atomic Pt species and Cu NPs on the MMO support were demonstrated for the PtCu-SAA samples, which showed good a TOF for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol (Fig. 45d).351 Based on the experimental studies and data from computational investigations, the plausible reaction mechanism for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol using the PtCu-SAA catalyst was proposed, as shown in (Fig. 45e).

Firstly, the adsorption of glycerol and activation of the Pt–Cu interface occur, and the then O atom (C–O) and H atom (C–H) bond with the Cu and Pt sites, respectively. Next, the binding of glycerol atoms with the PtCu-SAA catalyst results in hydrogenolysis to provide 1,2-propanediol.
Cu single-atom catalysts have been employed for several advanced applications, where Zboril and co-workers designed 2D mixed-valence ionic copper SACs [G(CN)-Cu] with excellent selectivity (99%), conversion (98%), and good recyclability with a very low metal loading for the oxidative coupling of amine groups, and benzylic C–H bond oxidation to provide high-value pharmaceutical synthons.352 The support G-CN was prepared via the substitution of F atoms in fluorographene with –CN (nitrile) groups. Afterwards, G-CN was mixed with copper chloride to immobilize Cu(II) on the support G-CN sheets, as shown in Fig. 46a. Impressively, the catalyst was recycled even after five times with very high selectivity and 94% conversion for the catalytic benzylamine coupling reactions (Fig. 46b). The HR-TEM images showed high-contrast spots on the catalyst, which are ascribed to the copper ions (Fig. 46c and d) before and (Fig. 46e and f) after the reaction. The excellent results for the conversion amines to imines via oxidative homo-/hetero-dehydrogenation are shown in Fig. 46g and examples of oxidation of benzylic C–H bond in hydrocarbon derivatives to CO bonds are shown in Fig. 46h.

4.2 Photocatalysis by copper and copper-based NMs
Photocatalytic reactions are a subset of catalytic transformations that are inspired by natural photosynthesis and rely on energy from light for the reaction to proceed.353 Besides Cu-catalysed organic transformations, Cu and Cu-based NMs have been employed for various photocatalytic reactions. In this section, we cover the recent advancements in Cu-based NMs employed for photocatalytic reactions such as carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), water-splitting including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and Cu-catalysed organic transformations including oxidation and reduction reactions under visible light. Under visible light, a Cu-based catalyst was employed for the degradation of dyes354 and organic pollutants.197 In 1972, Fujishima et al. designed a TiO2 electrode photocatalyst for light-induced water splitting reaction, and this pioneering work introduced semiconductor photocatalysis.355 Some recent advanced Cu NM-catalysed photocatalytic applications are described below.

4.2.1 Reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals. 
The controlled release of CO2 has been a topic of wide investigation. The consumption of CO2 as an unconventional and renewable carbon source has evolved in various ways worldwide because catalytic CO2 conversion presents a renewable energy source that can fulfil the energy demand and overcome the energy crisis. Also, CO2 capture reduces the global temperature, protecting the environment.356 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to form various types of liquid fuels, hydrocarbons and C–C coupling products has been widely explored using Cu-based nanocatalysts.211,357,358
In this regard, Li et al. reported the photo-thermal catalytic reduction of CO2 to ethanol catalysed by ultra-thin porous g-C3N4 nanosheets containing AuCu alloy NPs.359 The AuCu/g-C3N4 nanosheets were prepared via the hydrothermal method. The characterization of AuCu/g-C3N4 showed that the AuCu NPs were evenly distributed on the g-C3N4 nanosheets and the particle size of the AuCu NPs size increased. The crystal planes of the AuCu NPs exhibited that average spacing of (111), (002), and (200), corresponding to 2.22 Å, 1.98 Å, and 1.83 Å, respectively, and the catalyst size was observed to be 10 nm (Fig. 47a and b). Due to its low Fermi level, the AuCu/g-C3N4 working electrode had a higher charge separation productivity than other photocatalysts, as seen by its photocurrent density (Fig. 47c). The photothermal catalytic reaction (PTCR) for the conversion of CO2 to methanol and ethanol was better than the photocatalytic reaction (PCR) and thermal catalytic reaction (TCR), simplifying the C–C coupling procedure (Fig. 47d).

Fig. 47e and f shows the PTCR selectivity for the conversion of CO2 to ethanol as a product using AuCu/g-C3N4 NMs. The AuCu NPs generate several electrons and protons in the presence of visible light and water, which can be used for the reduction CO2 to C–C coupling for the formation of ethanol. At 1.0 wt% loading and 120 °C with visible light irradiation, AuCu exhibited selectivity for the synthesis of ethanol (Fig. 47g and h). The amount CO2 consumed shows that the conversion of CO2 to alcohol with AuCu/g-C3N4 was 5.9-times higher with photothermal catalysis than thermal catalysis and 3.9-times higher than the photocatalysis reaction (Fig. 47i). The metal and g-C3N4 nanosheets created a strong interface for the movement of photogenerated charges, generating a photocurrent density 6-times that of the g-C3N4 nanosheets. An increase in temperature led to an improvement in the thermal motion of the molecules and resultant interaction of photocatalysis and thermo-catalysis, promoting C–C coupling reactions by *CO dimerization, which subsequently increased the product yield of ethanol. At 120 °C, the yield and selectivity for the CH3CH2OH product were 0.89 mmol g−1 h−1 and 93.1% for 1.0 wt% AuCu/g-C3N4, respectively, which is 4.2-times higher than of photocatalysis and 7.6-times more than thermo-catalysis.
In another approach to achieve the conversion of CO2 to fuel, Wang et al. synthesized Cu-doped TiO2 with carbon dots (CDs) for CO2 methanation using H2O in a photo-thermal scheme.360 The Cu/TiO2-C nanostructure was synthesized via a photoreduction technique for the loading of Cu on the TiO2–C support. Its TEM image and SEAD pattern confirmed the asymmetrical shape along the lattice spacing of TiO2 (0.35 nm), which is related to the 101 plane, and the carbon dots (0.33 nm) are related to the 002 plane (Fig. 48a and b), respectively. The photocurrent density of the nanostructure revealed that outstanding charge separation occurred due to the CDs.

The Cu/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2–C catalysts were both utilized for the reduction of CO2 to methane with H2O at different temperatures under UV light irradiation and in the dark (Fig. 48c and d), respectively. Consequently, superior methane (CH4) formation (8 μmol g−1 h−1 at 250 °C) under UV light treatment with Cu/TiO2 was observed. The highest methane formation achieved by Cu/TiO2–C was up to 60 μmol g−1 h−1 at 250 °C. The formation of methane was supported by incorporating Cu in TiO2 or TiO2–C. Here, at high temperature, the CDs not only acted as an electron store to generate Cu(I), but also trapped photo-generated holes similarly to TiO2 upon exposure to UV light, resulting in the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) with the corresponding trapping and release of electrons. In contrast, the synergistic effect of UV light irradiation and temperature do not arise on the Cu/TiO2 material in the absence of CDs. This work undoubtedly provides a stable platform for the CO2 reduction method involving H2O and Cu-based composites in a photo-thermal reaction and possibly delivers an innovative method to understand some of the non-spontaneous reactions in thermodynamic chemistry.
In another protocol for the reduction of CO2, Zhu et al. developed a Cu/Cu+-supported Ti3+/TiO2 (Cu/Cu+@TiO2) photocatalyst via the ionothermal approach for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.361 The morphological characterization of Cu/Cu+@TiO2 confirmed the hydrangea-like arrangement and no apparent Cu particles on its external surface (Fig. 49a–c). Cu/Cu+@TiO2 provided a great photocurrent response, which may be attributed to the role of the Cu+–O bond to speed up photon-generated transport (Fig. 49d), which was supported by density functional theory.

The photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 49e) resulted in higher CH4 production with Cu/Cu+@TiO2 than that with other photocatalysts. The synergistic effect between the external Cu and Cu+ inside Cu/Cu+@TiO2 played an important role by increasing the electron density for the reduction of CO2. The photogenerated electrons of Cu/Cu+@TiO2 were utilized on the surface of the hydroxyl groups, which were 100% used for CO2 reduction, and thus H2 evolution did not occur. The strategy in this work provides a technique for increasing of photocatalytic efficacy for CO2 reduction by photocatalysts such as TiO2. Thus, this method may also be useful for photocatalysis or photoelectrocatalysis employing metals or non-metals derived from Ti3+/TiO2.
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction results in the formation of methane, methanol, and C–C coupling products, and water splitting generates hydrogen as an energy source. All these products have tremendous potential in the energy sector as renewable fuel. Liu et al. synthesized bi-metallic Cu–Pt/TiO2–CuO nanocomposites via a two-step photo-deposition technique.362 Cu–Pt-supported TiO2 enhances the photocatalytic reaction of TiO2 for H2O splitting and CO2 conversion to CO, H2, CH4, O2, and CH3OH, where CO is the main product obtained in the CO2RR.
The characterization of the Cu–Pt/TiO2–CuO catalyst (Fig. 50a–d) showed that the Cu–Pt nanosized particles formed close contact with the CuO NPs, which were found on the surface of TiO2. The interplanar crystal spacing measures the material nano-size, where the bi-metallic analysis of the Cu–Pt structures showed that Cu was more dispersed than the Pt NPs (Fig. 50e and f). The average size of CuO was 1.5 nm in the Cu2O/TiO2 material. The Cu–Pt aggregates were around 15 nm in size, with the size distribution of 20–25 nm.

The photocatalytic activity of the fabricated TiO2, Cu2O/TiO2, and Cu–Pt/TiO2–CuO was investigated for the CO2 reduction reaction in simulated sunlight. In this protocol, Cu–Pt/TiO2–CuO was observed to result in the highest CO production among the photocatalysts, where different starting materials and light sources were also studied (Fig. 50g–i). The Cu–Pt/TiO2–CuO photocatalyst displayed excellent results, with the product yields of CH3OH, CO, and CH4 of 0.2, 15.6, and 0.05 μmol h−1 g−1, although 4.8 and 10.8 μmol h−1 g−1 H2 and O2 were produced, respectively. In their study, it was shown that weak alkaline solution and a CO2-rich atmosphere will be beneficial for the CO2RR. This research will aid in the development of photo-deposition processes and strategies for the use of Cu-based NMs in solar-fuel manufacturing.
Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a versatile material due to its tunable bandgap and anti-fluorite-type crystal structure, making it an effective catalyst for the electrochemical and photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in aqueous medium under a light source.363 Wan et al. reported the preparation of an earth-abundant, low-cost cuprous oxide (Cu2O) metal–oxide semiconductor material.364 Copper foam-generated Cu2O nanocubes were synthesized through a thermal method, followed by ultrasonication. The as-synthesized Cu2O nanocubes were employed for heterogeneous photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation in the gas phase. The Cu2O nanocubes were synthesized using the foam of bulk copper without controlling the pH or surfactants. The copper foam was heated, and then treated with acid and water to form Cu2O nanocubes, which were denoted as copper foam Cu2O (CF-Cu2O).
The TEM images showed a CF-Cu2O nanocube with dense external areas and fewer dense inner areas and the HR-TEM images displayed that the lattice planes are smaller than the nanocube core. The Cu2O nanocubes had a comparable size and cube-shaped structure to the copper foam according to the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image.
Photocatalytic CO2RR was performed using CF-Cu2O in a batch reactor. CO was the main product detected using the gas ratio of CO2/H2 = 1/1 and 5/1. The gas ratio of CO2/H2 = 5/1 produced nearly 70.3 mmol gcat−1 h−1 CO and was stable up to the first five runs, whereas an LED flow reactor produces nearly 139.6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 CO. This work offers an important step to apply a cheap and non-toxic material in photocatalysis.
In line with CO2 conversion, recently, Wu et al. developed a single photo-catalytically active Cu2O particle for CO2 reduction to methanol.141 The single Cu2O photocatalyst oxidized water equally as it reduced CO2 to methanol with a production of up to 72%. These authors synthesized two forms of Cu2O photocatalysts, one having a combination of cubic and octahedral nanocrystals, and the second mainly composed of cubic nanocrystals via the standard colloidal synthesis methods.


4.2.2 Water splitting reactions. 
The water-splitting reaction by photocatalytic materials has been intensively studied as mature technology to achieve direct and simple solar energy conversion. However, the stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen and oxygen gas evolution (H2/O2 = 2) is a challenge due to several problems, such as the poor backward reaction and unequal band potentials.365 In contrast, complete water splitting to produce H2 and O2 employing a catalyst is the conventional approach and much easier due to its potential for the production of clean hydrogen energy. Effective water splitting is mostly hindered by the OER, which is a half-reaction, owing to its four-electron transfer procedure, where the elimination of four protons by water splitting results in the formation of a new O–O bond (O2).189
In recent years, a new class of core–shell nanostructured materials has been utilized for vital chemical reactions in various fields.366,367 Wen et al. reported the preparation of CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets for outstanding photocatalytic water oxidation, exhibiting an O2 production rate of up to 3.48 mmol h−1g−1 under near-infrared light (NIR).269 A photo-induced approach was used for the preparation of the core–shell CuFeSe2@Au photocatalyst. The characterisation of the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets showed their sheet-like morphology, with a lattice spacing of 0.242 nm across the entire nanosheet, and the element mapping displayed the presence of all four Cu, Fe, Se and Au element structures (Fig. 51a and d).

(e) Oxygen evolution results: CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets under NIR light irradiation; CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets under visible light treatment; Au nanosheets under λ > 420 nm; CuFeSe2 NCs under λ > 850 nm; and a mixture of CuFeSe2 NCs and Au nanosheets under λ > 850 nm.

The CuFeSe2@Au nanosheet catalyst resulted in the maximum O2 evolution rate (3.48 mmol h−1 g−1) under visible light treatment, as confirmed by the calculated apparent quantum yield (AQY) (Fig. 51e and f). The CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets were utilized for the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction, which proceeded in the presence of Na2S2O8 as a sacrificial electron acceptor under NIR-light and visible-light irradiation. This work offers an innovative approach for the preparation of 2D core–shell and noble metal-doped semiconductor nanosheets.
The synthesis of copper-type nanocrystals in TiO2 (Cu/Cu2O/CuO/TiO2) nanofibers for photocatalytic water reduction to generate hydrogen was reported by Liu et al.158 CuO/TiO2 heterojunction nanofibers prepared by electrospinning were reduced in situ to multi-hetero-junction Cu/Cu2O/CuO/TiO2 nanofibers using a glucose-assisted hydrothermal synthesis method.
The characterization of the CuO/TiO2 nanofibers displayed randomly located nanofibers having a plane surface, 200 nm diameter and lattice borders of 0.25 nm and 0.35 nm. The SEM, TEM and HRTEM images of the multi-hetero-junction Cu/Cu2O/CuO/TiO2 nanofibers display an irregular surface and several irregular nanopores. The lattice borders of 0.35, 0.23, 0.25 and 0.21 nm are related to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2, (002) plane of tenorite CuO, (111) plane of cuprite Cu2O, and (111) plane of cubic Cu, respectively (Fig. 52a–g).

The multi-hetero-junction Cu/Cu2O/CuO/TiO2 nanofibers were utilized for H2 evolution via the photocatalytic water reduction reaction (Fig. 52h and i). The highest rate for the formation of H2 was observed when the multi-hetero-junction Cu/Cu2O/CuO/TiO2 nanofibers were synthesized by hydrothermal action with the concentration of glucose of 0.25 mg mL−1, exhibiting the rate of ∼10.04 μmol h−1, which was about 17.3-times greater than of the bare TiO2 nanofibers. This catalyst was used in at least four cycles of H2 production. This work will be useful for developing facile and effective approaches to synthesize low-cost multi-hetero-junction catalysts with higher photocatalytic activity.
In another photocatalytic study, Zhao and co-workers designed and synthesized a new dodecahedral nitrogen (N)-doped carbon (C)-coated CuO–In2O3 p–n heterojunction (DNCPH) for photocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen.368 The DNCPH photocatalyst was produced via the direct pyrolysis of benzimidazole, which improved the dodecahedral Cu/In-based metal–organic structures and showed long-term stability in aqueous triethanolamine (TEOA) solution.
The TEM and HRTEM images of the DNCPH photocatalyst revealed a huge number of small holes and interfaces between the CuO and In2O3 components (Fig. 53a–c). The photocurrent density observed with three samples at 1.3 V against Hg/Hg2Cl2 and DNCPH was higher than that with other electrodes (Fig. 53d). The platinum (Pt)-decorated CuO–In2O3 heterojunction displayed higher H2 generation than the normal CuO–In2O3 heterojunction because of the Pt electron acceptor property (Fig. 53e). A schematic of the mechanism for photocatalytic H2 generation using DNCPH with TEOA solution is shown in Fig. 53f and g.

The DNCPH photocatalyst demonstrated excellent activity for photocatalytic H2 evolution in the presence of aqueous TEOA. The DNCPH catalyst has excellent activity for H2 production because of the improved photo-generation of electron–hole pairs by the p–n heterojunction and N-doped C layer. This work delivers a viable technique for the efficient use of CuO-based catalysts in photocatalytic H2 production.
Recently, Fan and co-workers developed CuCo2O4/TiO2 nanosheets using CuCo2O4 NPs for photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction with enhanced photocatalytic action from TiO2.196 The H2 generation rate increased by up to 32 times compared to that of pristine TiO2. The CuCo2O4/TiO2 photocatalyst was prepared via a simple hydrothermal technique, followed by an in situ calcination step.
For photocatalytic H2 generation using the various synthesized catalysts with triethanolamine (TEOA), 10%-CuCo2O4/TiO2 showed the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution yields and rates (Fig. 54a and b). The schematic mechanism shows that CuCo2O4 was beneficial for the water splitting reaction (Fig. 54c).

Compared with various TiO2-based photocatalysts for H2 evolution under the same reaction conditions, notably, CuCo2O4/TiO2 showed a fast recombination rate, and TiO2 and CuCo2O4 individually showed moderately low H2 evolution rates of 151 and 42 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. The H2 production rate improved with the modification of CuCo2O4 by TiO2. Consequently, the TiO2-based CuCo2O4 photocatalyst demonstrated an H2 production rate of 4830 μmol g−1 h−1 at 10% of CuCo2O4/TiO2. This effort advances a new prospect for discovering non-noble metal CuCo2O4-based photocatalysts.
Wang and co-workers reported the preparation of mixed transition-metal oxide-based nanosheet-assembled NMs, i.e., MCo2O4 (M = Ni, Cu, and Zn), for the oxygen evolution reaction via photocatalysis.215 Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/M-cobalt acetate hydroxide was used as a precursor for the synthesis of MCo2O4 nanotubes through an electrostatic spinning approach followed by ultrasonication to obtain the nanosheet-derived MCo2O4 nanotubes.
The SEM images of the PAN core nanostructures of the CuCo2O4 nanocomposites revealed tubular rod-like structures with lengths of up to micrometres (Fig. 55a), where the ∼5 nm size porous nanosheets formed were not only in polycrystalline nature but also exhibited sets of crystalline lattice planes (Fig. 55b and c).

(e) O2 production with AQE of different catalysts under 450 nm irradiation.215 Reproduced from ref. 215 with permission, Copyright 2018, The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Among the fabricated photocatalysts, i.e., CuCo2O4, NiCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4 nanotubes, the Cu-based nanotubes (CuCo2O4) exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity and operational stability with an oxygen evolution rate of 51.1 mmol g−1 h−1 under photocatalytic conditions. It also showed the highest AQE (Fig. 55d and e). The CuCo2O4 nanotubes enhanced the photocatalytic activity due to the strong photon absorption ability and large surface area of the created hollow nanotubes. This catalyst synthetic method is useful and can be easily applied to produce other hierarchical multielement oxide-based nanosheet-created nanotubes for various innovative applications.
Another metal–oxide-based tri-component heterostructure, Au/CuO/Co3O4 nanotubes, was reported by Hu et al. to exhibit photocatalytic activity towards oxygen production through water electrolysis.268 The Au/CuO/Co3O4 tri-component nanotubes were synthesized via the electrospinning method using CuO/Co3O4 as a precursor and Au metal was introduced in the nanostructure via the photoinduced reduction technique. The SEM and TEM characterization of the Au/CuO/Co3O4 photocatalyst showed that the nanotubes have a rough surface, having pores with a diameter of nearly 210 nm (Fig. 56a and b). The SAED pattern showed that the Au/CuO/Co3O4 nanotubes exhibit a polycrystalline morphology (inset Fig. 56b), and the HRTEM image displayed the interaction among Au, Co3O4 and CuO in the heterojunction nanotubes (Fig. 56c).

(e) Schematic mechanism of O2 production with Au/CuO/Co3O4.268 Reproduced from ref. 268 with permission, Copyright 2018, the American Chemical Society. 
As shown in Fig. 56d and e, the Au/CuO/Co3O4 heterojunction nanotubes exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for water oxidation to generate O2 due to the heterojunction and plasmonic effects of the transition metal and metal oxide combination, which increased the light absorption due to their unique bandgap. The Au/CuO/Co3O4 photocatalyst was very stable and was employed in several cycles without a decrease in its catalytic activity. Thus, this work offers a new path for the fabrication of photocatalysts for very effective O2 evolution based on multicomponent heterojunction nanotubes.


4.2.3 Redox reactions. 
Photocatalysis is used for multiple conversions, with proton-coupled electron transfer (PCETs). Photocatalytic reactions occur due to the redox reactions produced by photo-induced electrons (e−) and holes (h+) formed on the surface of the photocatalyst. PCET has been used in actual oxidative and reductive reactions in photocatalysis.369,370 The oxidation of alcohols to the respective carbonyl compounds, reduction of carbonyl compounds to the respective alcohols, and oxidative coupling of various organic compounds are vital organic conversions widely used in various industries.
The fabrication of a single-atom metal (SAM) photocatalyst containing a polymeric carbon nitride (p-C3N4) support was reported by Wang and co-workers.371 Hollow carbon nitride spheres (HCNSs) were obtained from carbon nitride nanosheets by atomically dispersing Cu1N3 molecules in HCNS nanosheets (Cu1@HCNS) and Cu1N3 molecules were attached to the surface of the HCNS nanosheets (Cu1/HCNS), which were synthesized via the molecular assembly technique. The characterization displayed the atomic dispersion of Cu on both Cu1@HCNS and Cu1/HCNS, which was observed as single atom dark spots (Fig. 57a–f). The Cu1@HCNS photocurrent displayed a greater response than Cu1/HCNS (Fig. 57g), which proves that the encouraging effect of the Cu single atom depends on the location of Cu.

(g) Photocurrent density of the different photocatalysts. (h) H2 evolution by the different photocatalysts. (i) Schematic mechanism of the non-oxygen coupling of amines to imines with Cu1@HCNS.371 Reproduced from ref. 371 with permission, Copyright 2020, the American Chemical Society. 
Both Cu single atom-improved HCNS catalysts displayed greater photocatalytic action than the pristine HCNS for the H2 generation reaction (Fig. 57h), where Cu1@HCNS produced 1.6-times more H2 (3261 μmol g−1 h−1) than Cu1/HCNS (2097 μmol g−1 h−1). The photocatalytic reaction mechanism for the non-oxygen coupling of an amine to imine is shown in Fig. 57i, where water was used as the oxidant. Cu1@HCNS showed superior imine formation with different substituents on amines than the other photocatalysts. The linkage of Cu single atoms through Cu–N attachment in the carbon nitride nanosheets was more active for electronic arrangement and increased the interfacial charge transfer to improve the visible light photo-redox catalysis. The corresponding outcome strongly depends on the location of the Cu single atom in the PCN catalyst, where the coordination technique is an effective approach to introduce SAMs in the development of PCN catalysts owing to the increased metal-PCN interface. This effort will be effective for carbon nitride photocatalysis for solar fuel applications and organic synthesis.


4.2.4 Reduction reactions. 
In the field of catalysis, one of the important reactions is the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes. Accordingly, Imai et al. prepared a Pd core-Cu shell bi-metallic TiO2-based photocatalyst (Pd@Cu/TiO2) via a two-step photo-deposition technique for the hydrogenation of alkynes in alcohol suspensions of Pd@Cu/TiO2.372 The characterization of the Pd@Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst displayed that the photogenerated electrons were trapped by the Pd NPs and the electrons were used for the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu. These two elements created the core–shell structure of the Pd@Cu/TiO2 catalyst, exhibiting excellent activity for the semi-hydrogenation of 4-octyne.
The hydrogenation of 4-octyne (selectivity for 4-cis octene; 59 μmol h−1) and H2 evolution were carried out using an isopropyl alcohol suspension of Pd(0.2)@Cu(1.0)/TiO2. The Pd@Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst was also used for the semi-hydrogenation of different types of alkynes with various functional groups, resulting in the higher conversion of alkenes (Fig. 58a). The schematic mechanism of the semi-hydrogenation of alkyne shows that the oxidation of alcohol occurs initially, and then the hydrogenation of alkyne (Fig. 58b). The as-synthesized Pd(0.2)@Cu(1.0)/TiO2 material was used for the photocatalytic hydrogenation of 4-octyne to octene in a 2-propanol solution. The as-prepared Pd@Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst was also used for the semi-hydrogenation of numerous alkynes having other functional groups and worked in numerous alcohols, creating particular carbonyl compounds.

The fabrication of hierarchical Au/CuCo2O4 nanotubes for the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes via photocatalysis was explored by Hu et al.46 The Au/CuCo2O4 nanotubes were synthesized via the photo-induced reduction method. Au/CuCo2O4 was prepared via a two-step synthesis route by decorating Au NPs on CuCo2O4 nanotubes. The SEM and TEM analysis displayed that the Au/CuCo2O4 catalyst possessed a polycrystalline tube shape. The nanosheet structure showed the interaction between Au (2.15%) and CuCo2O4 in these nanotube catalysts (Fig. 59a–d).

The Au/CuCo2O4 catalyst was used to hydrogenate many unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols under visible light treatment (Fig. 59e). The visible light-induced hydrogenation reaction is an efficient approach because of the synergistic effect of the Au NPs and the CuCo2O4 support. The Au/CuCo2O4 photocatalyst could be used in several cycles without a decrease in its catalytic activity. The synergistic effect of the Au NPs and semiconducting CuCo2O4 nanosheets was ascribed to the admirable act of Au/CuCo2O4, which was attained due to the electron transition between the metal and semiconductor material. The as-prepared Au/CuCo2O4 heterostructures afford a green system for hydrogenation reactions and an operative mode for improving light-induced organic synthesis reactions.


4.2.5 Oxidation reactions. 
Oxidation reactions on the inert C–H bond of cyclohexane, benzene, and aromatic hydrocarbons were explored via photocatalysis. Mavuso et al. reported the fabrication of a Cu–CeO2 nanocatalyst for the visible light-mediated photooxidation of pinene to aroma oxygenates.172 The Cu–CeO2 nanocatalyst was synthesized via the sol–gel technique. The particle size of CeO2 (Fig. 60a) varied from 20 to 50 nm, while that of Cu–CeO2 (Fig. 60b) increased to 127 nm. The CuO–CeO2 heterojunction was used for pinene allylic oxidation and epoxidation to form different products such as pinene oxide (38.8%), verbenol (6.4%), and verbenone (3.8%). CuO exhibits a strong visible-light response because of the small bandgap of the catalyst (Fig. 60c).

The CeO2-containing metal oxides (Cu, Co, Mn, Ni, and Fe) exhibited equally dispersed nanoparticle sizes and high surface areas. The CeO2-based nanocatalyst displayed definite photocatalytic activity under visible-light treatment for pinene oxidation to aroma oxygenated compounds (Fig. 60d).
In line with mixed metal copper-based catalysts, Chen et al. reported the preparation of Cu2O/Cu nanocomposites for CO2 reduction with benzyl alcohol oxidation to produce multi-carbon compounds such as benzyl acetate under photocatalytic conditions.133 Cu2O/Cu was synthesized via the in situ reduction of Cu2O by NaBH4 through the ultrasonication method. The SEM image of the Cu2O/Cu nanocomposite displayed the presence of irregular NPs with a size of 100 nm (Fig. 61a). The HR-TEM (Fig. 61b and c) and SAED (Fig. 61d) images displayed that in situ Cu2O reduction using NaBH4 is an effective method to fabricate Cu2O/Cu nanocomposites with close interaction between Cu2O and Cu. Cu2O/Cu was employed for CO2 reduction and oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzyl aldehyde (Fig. 61e). CO2 was captured on the Cu surface, forming surface-absorbed H2CCO, which resulted in the formation of the final product benzyl acetate under visible light irradiation.

The as-prepared Cu2O/Cu photocatalyst was inactive after the photocatalytic reaction because of the oxidation of Cu to CuO; however, facile reduction could be employed to recover the activity of the photocatalyst. Thus, this work provides a strategy for photocatalytic CO2 conversion, linking photocatalytic CO2 reduction with organic compound oxidation for the formation of multi-carbon compounds.
Varma et al. reported the use of the bimetallic CuAg@g-C3N4 photoactive catalyst for the hydroxylation of benzene using visible light.373 This catalyst was prepared via the impregnation technique, where Cu and Ag NPs were doped on the surface of graphitic carbon nitride. The SEM and TEM analysis displayed that CuAg@g-C3N4 possessed a different morphology than the support g-C3N4 because of the impregnation of the Cu and Ag NPs (Fig. 62a and b). CuAg@g-C3N4 showed the best result the among the bimetallic catalysts for selective benzene hydroxylation to phenol in less than 30 min (Fig. 62c). Furthermore, the bimetallic CuAg@g-C3N4 catalyst was recycled for a minimum of 5 times without a decrease in its activity.

Using the as-synthesized CuAg@g-C3N4 photocatalyst, a sustainable protocol was developed for benzene hydroxylation via C–H bond activation. In the CuAg@g-C3N4 photocatalyst, the synergistic effect of copper and silver metal plays an essential role in the absorption of visible light in the reaction mixture for benzene hydroxylation via C–H bond activation.

5 Applications of Cu-based NMs in environmental remediation and gas sensing
Over the last two decades, the rapid growth in agricultural, pharmaceutical, and industrial activities, as well as the global population, has resulted in environmental issues such as hazardous gas emissions, release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and air, soil, and water pollution, all of which have a significant impact on global climate change and human health.374,375 Because of the wide use of automobiles and industrial combustion processes, the emission of hazardous gases such as NOx, CO, and CO2 has been increasing in recent years, causing major air pollution such as acid rain and photochemical smog, as well as hypoxia in human tissues and acute or chronic poisoning.376,377 In industrial and academic effluents, the contaminants include volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (toluene, formaldehyde and phenol), organic pollutants, and azo, methylene blue (MB), methyl red (MR), Congo red (CR), and RhB dyes. These pollutants affecting human health especially children resulting in immunosuppression, DNA damage, allergies, death of fish and other aquatic life and environmental problems.5,375,378 Thus, various methods have been developed to combat environmental pollution, such as filtration, adsorption, catalysis and combustion. Among them, catalysis is widely recognized as one of the most harmless, highly efficient, and low-energy methods. Thus far, the catalysts used for the catalytic combustion of VOCs, degradation of dyes and reduction of toxic gases are primarily classified into noble metal, zeolite, MOF and metal oxide catalysts. Copper and copper NMs are widely utilized in the photodegradation of dyes and decomposition and reduction of environmental pollutants and gases (Table 9).

In recent years, researchers have mainly focused on the development of sensitive and stable gas sensors, given that an enormous amount of polluting gases is produced in fast-growing industries and vehicles, leading to serious problems for human health and the environment.408,409 Due to their colourless and odourless nature, most gases are inhaled by people without their knowledge, causing serious health problems and even death. Long-term exposure to NO2, H2S, CO and SO2 gases at low concentrations can seriously damage the respiratory system and cause headaches, dizziness and eye and nose irritation.410–413 The flammable and hazardous gases acetone, toluene and NH3 evaporate easily in excessive concentrations and can cause environmental and human health problems such as headaches, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, leading to unconsciousness and coma.414–416 Acetic acid and formaldehyde chemicals are widely used in foods, photography, pharmaceuticals and fermentation, which are highly volatile organic compounds that cause clinical symptoms such as burning in the nose and throat, coughing and wheezing in acute effects at low concentrations.417,418 Thus, a variety of gas sensors has been reported in the literature, including solid electrolyte gas sensors, electrochemical gas sensors, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors, catalytic combustion gas sensors and other types of gas sensors.408,419 Copper and copper-based NM sensors are sensitive to detect a wide range of pollutants and noxious gases even at low ppm and ppb concentrations (Table 10).

6 Advantages of Cu-based nanomaterials for organo and photocatalysis
Cu-Based NMs are promising candidates for organic and photocatalytic processes due to their good physical and chemical characteristics. Related to noble metals, Cu-based NMs have attracted attention because they are readily available, cheap, and highly reactive for many chemical reactions via organic and photocatalysis, such as reduction, oxidation reaction, coupling reaction, water splitting, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction to form energy fuels and hydrocarbons, dye degradation, wastewater treatment, and many other applications.46,81,126,129,141,142,145,146,149,158,160,162,263,369,371,450 However, the challenges associated with NMs employed as catalysts in a variety of reactions include the synthesis of reactive NMs and their recovery from the reaction mixture. In the huge family of metallic NMs, Cu NMs have attracted significant interest as effective catalysts in countless significant chemical conversions.21 Cu-Based NMs have lightly bonded d electrons, and thus Cu-based NMs act as capable photocatalysts with good multielectron transfer properties, displaying high potential for the production of value-added chemicals, Li-ion batteries, solar cells, and water splitting reactions.141 The carbon dioxide reduction is mainly performed using noble metal catalysts (Au, Ag, Pt, and Pd), non-noble metals (Cu, Co, Ni, Fe, etc.) and bio-co-catalysts. However, other metals and supports have been investigated for the design and development of a variety of Cu-based NMs. Notably, numerous Cu-based NMs have been used to develop a variety of catalysts for efficient CO2 photoreduction including CuO/TiO2, Cu/CuO-TiO2, CuxO-TiO2, and Cu/In2O3.451 For example, a bi-metallic Pd core–Cu shell (Pd@Cu) catalyst was used for the complete hydrogenation of alkyne compounds and exhibited excellent selectivity for the production trans-alkenes.372
7 Conclusion
Copper NMs and SACs have been widely used for organic catalysis and photocatalysis reactions due to their desirable properties. These copper-based catalysts exhibit high selectivity for products with resistance to deactivation, are significantly relevant, useful and less expensive than the noble metals. This review highlighted the advancement in the synthetic strategies for Cu and Cu-based NMs such as benign, electrochemical, thermal decomposition, chemical reduction, radiation-induced, sonochemical, and other methods. These methods successfully retain the catalytic activity, selectivity, size, morphology, structure, and stability of the nanosystems, which is paramount in designing and developing Cu NMs with unique properties customized for advanced applications in organic catalysis and photocatalysis. Synthetic strategies for supported Cu and Cu-based NMs, the growth mechanism and electronic interaction of Cu NMs, and their comprehensive characterization were also revealed. This review also presented the catalytic application of Cu NMs and SACs for organic transformations and photocatalytic processes, including reduction, carbon–carbon coupling, redox, A3 coupling, biomass conversion, reduction of CO2 and miscellaneous reactions. They are applicable for transforming industrial pollutant constituents such as CO2 and aromatic nitro and nitroaromatic derivatives into value-added products to sustain the environment. Most of the Cu NMs and Cu SACs catalysts included herein were stable and recyclable without a decrease in their catalytic activity for several cycles, making them economically and environmentally viable. This review on the synthetic strategies and applications of Cu NMs and SACs will help resolve future problems in the pharmaceutical, industrial, petroleum, and academic research fields.
8 Challenges and future perspective
In the field of Cu NMs and SACs, several challenges still exist. The key obstacle is creating and producing earth-abundant Cu-based NMs, while maintaining their various properties such as surface morphology, selectivity, stability, shape, reusability and catalytic activity. In particular, the modification of Cu NMs is limited due to their facile oxidation state changes and environment-sensitive nature. Consequently, recovering catalysts from the reaction mixture is difficult. Also, the stability of Cu NMs and SACs and their tendency to leach (especially under extreme conditions such as high temperature/pressure) are crucial. In the catalytic application of Cu NMs and SACs, some toxic, hazardous, and sometimes carcinogenic materials are used to perform the reaction. Thus, in the design and modification of novel Cu NMs with sustainable and economical strategies for synthesising stable Cu NMs and SACs with different shapes, sizes and strong covalent and ionic interactions between the support and Cu NMs and SACs, these problems still need to be addressed.
(1) Nowadays, many issues are relevant to clean air, water, and energy, which are severe problems for humans and the environment, which can be possible applications for Cu NMs and SACs. Moreover, these are opportunities for scientists and researchers to resolve problems by catalysis.
(2) As briefly discussed, synthetic methods can help to improve the design and development of cost-effective synthetic strategies for the preparation of advanced NMs and SACs, which can be more valuable and recyclable, with applications in organic chemistry, materials chemistry, and chemistry and nanotechnology.
(3) The bulk-scale synthesis of Cu nanoclusters and SACs from inexpensive precursors with potential catalytic activity promises the development of new copper nanocluster-based NMs in the future.
(4) In review, different shapes and size of Cu NMs and SACs showed better catalytic activity for advanced applications. Furthermore, these Cu catalysts, combined with noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, Au, and Ag), may exhibit improved catalytic activity for a variety of chemical conversions, which become possible with two mixed metals than individual metals.
(5) We highlighted the study of the electronic interaction between the support (silica, alumina, metal oxide, metal alloys, polymer, carbon materials, and many more) and Cu, which maintains a low coordination, immobilizes individual atoms, boosts the catalytic activity and heterogeneous nature of NMs and SACs. These supports will be helpful in the synthesis of core–shell and heterogenous NMs and bimetallic SACs.
(6) Many photoactive Cu NMs and SACs catalysts have been reported for the production of clean chemicals and showed effective catalytic activity for environmental CO2 reduction to value-added chemicals; however, these photocatalysts are sensitive to air, water and harsh reaction condition.
(7) The prepared Cu NPs with supports such as MnO2 and WO2.72, and their interaction, catalytic activity, and stability should be studied, especially for synthesising single-atom and bi-metallic atom catalysts.
(8) The reported Cu NMs and SACs can be helpful in the medical field as antimicrobial agents and for the reduction of industrial waste pollutants and environmental pollution.
(9) The above-described synthesis strategies can be useful for the feasible large-scale production of Cu NMs, which will considerably increase the utilization of Cu NMs in advanced applications.
(10) We highlighted the synthetic strategies and applications of Cu NMs and SACs, which can be helpful for the synthesis of petrochemical, biologically active and industrial chemicals using continuous flow chemistry.
(11) The membrane catalyst concept enables the tuning the reaction rate by adapting the pressure to suit variable working conditions, that is, different feed concentrations and rate flows. Thus, the catalytic activity, selectivity and lifetime of Cu NMs and SACs can be improved by introducing membrane technology.
