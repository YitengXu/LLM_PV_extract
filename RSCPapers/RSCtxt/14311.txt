Broader context
The photosynthetic conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons such as methane is a promising method to reduce excess CO2 present in the atmosphere and to simultaneously produce solar fuels (e.g.CO, CH4 and CH3OH). However, the photoconversion efficiency of the process is very low because the activation of the thermochemically most stable CO2 requires highly energetic electrons. Since the one-electron reduction to CO2˙− is highly undesirable, a more favorable pathway is to reduce CO2 though proton-coupled multiple-electron transfers (PCET). In this study, Nafion (perfluorinated polymer with sulfonate groups) coated Pd–TiO2 particles (Nf/Pd–TiO2) were prepared and their reactivity for the photoreduction of CO2 was tested. The role of the Nafion layer is proposed to enhance the local proton activity within the layer to facilitate PCET reactions and to stabilize intermediates and to inhibit the re-oxidation of the CO2 reduction products. Nf/Pd–TiO2 is more active than Pd–TiO2 for the photo-production of hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, and propane). The photosynthetic activity of the Nf/Pd–TiO2 catalyst was maintained through repeated cycles of photoreaction, which confirms the stability of the Nafion layer. The proposed Nf/Pd–TiO2 should serve as a model of more practical catalysts for the artificial photosynthesis that is based on PCET reactions.

Direct solar conversion of CO2 into hydrocarbons is an ideal solution to reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere with the simultaneous production of solar fuels (e.g., CO, CH4 and CH3OH).1,2 Intensive efforts have been made to achieve this goal for many years and the photosynthetic process using semiconductor nanoparticles is being investigated as a CO2-converting artificial photosynthesis.3–9 Among many semiconductors, the titanium dioxide (TiO2) based material is one of the most frequently studied photocatalysts because of its durability, availability, non-toxicity, and low cost;10–12 however, the overall CO2 photoconversion efficiency of the titania-based material is low.13–17
The photosynthetic conversion of CO2 is limited mainly by: (i) the highly negative one-electron reduction potential of CO2 (CO2 + e− → CO2˙−, E0 = −1.9 VNHE), (ii) the strong oxidation power of photogenerated valence band holes (or OH radicals) that can react with intermediates and products of CO2 conversion (e.g., formate, formaldehyde, and methanol in reactions (1)–(4)), (iii) the low solubility of CO2 in water (33 mM @ 298 K and 1 atm), and (iv) the competition with H2 formation (reaction (5)).18–20 Many different approaches have been attempted to surpass these limitations. First of all, to overcome the thermochemically unfavorable one-electron reduction of CO2, the proton-coupled multielectron transfer (PCET) (reactions (1)–(4)) should be facilitated by modifying the surface properties of photocatalysts (e.g., loading a co-catalyst such as Pt and Pd that serves as an electron reservoir).3b,15,21–23 Further surface modification of TiO2 is required to inhibit the reoxidation of CO2 conversion products and to enhance the CO2 reduction efficiency. CO2 + 2H+ + 2ecb− → HCOOH(1) HCOOH + 2H+ + 2ecb− → HCHO + H2O(2) HCHO + 2H+ + 2ecb− → CH3OH(3) CH3OH + 2H+ + 2ecb− → CH4 + H2O(4) 2H+ + 2ecb− → H2(5)
The artificial photosynthesis should be carried out using water as an electron donor (2H2O → 4H+ + O2 + 4e−), which provides electrons and protons for reactions (1)–(5). However, many previous studies on CO2 reduction (using homogeneous metal complexes, metal sulfides, titania-based catalysts) used sacrificial electron donors.4,5,7b,20 Some studies reported the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with water used as an electron donor but the overall efficiency is still very low.8
In this study, a Nafion (perfluorinated polymer with sulfonate groups) overlayer on TiO2 was employed for the photoreduction of CO2 in the absence of a sacrificial electron donor, which is illustrated in Scheme 1. Some previous studies employed Nafion-coated TiO2 photocatalysts mainly for anchoring cationic substrates or sensitizers.24,25 In the present work, a Nafion-coated TiO2 catalyst was selected for the artificial photosynthesis on the basis of three reasons. First, being a superacid and an excellent proton conducting medium, the Nafion layer may enhance the local activity of protons near the TiO2 surface region and the PCET reaction can be facilitated within the Nafion layer over TiO2. The proton conducting property of Nafion should facilitate the diffusion of protons onto the CO2 reduction sites. Second, the intermediates of CO2 reduction might be stabilized within the Nafion layer, which should help the serial electron transfers from the intermediate to the final product. In addition, the reoxidation of the CO2 reduction products can be inhibited by the presence of the Nafion layer that should prohibit the direct contact between the products and the TiO2 surface. Thirdly, being a perfluorinated polymer, Nafion itself is stable against the photocatalytic oxidation and is inert toward the photoinduced redox reactions. Incidentally, the Nafion layer was also successfully used as a matrix that holds molecular manganese-complex catalysts for water oxidation in a dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cell.26TiO2 particles were deposited with Pd and then coated with the Nafion layer to obtain the Nf/Pd–TiO2 catalyst. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction was carried out in the UV irradiated (λ > 300 nm) catalyst suspension (under CO2-saturation) with the analysis of the hydrocarbon products in the reactor headspace. The presence of noble metal cocatalysts that accumulate conduction band electrons and subsequently reduce protons is usually required for the photosynthetic conversion.11 The resulting metal hydride species hydrogenates CO2 to hydrocarbons. In this case, palladium was selected as a cocatalyst because the recombination of H atoms is retarded on the Pd surface thus minimizing the production of H2.21–23 Compared with the common cocatalyst Pt, Pd is a poor catalyst for H2 production, which is better suited for the hydrogenation of CO2.

Fig. 1 shows the TEM and HRTEM (high-resolution TEM) images and the elemental mapping images obtained with EFTEM (energy-filtered TEM) of Nf/Pd–TiO2. The elemental mapping analysis of Nf/Pd–TiO2 clearly exhibits F (red) distribution throughout the Nf/Pd–TiO2 particles (see Fig. 1d), which indicates that the surface of Pd–TiO2 is evenly covered with the Nafion layer consisting of the fluorinated polymer. The presence of Pd on TiO2 nanoparticles is clearly seen in the HRTEM images (see Fig. 1b and S1†) and the EDX image (see Fig. S2†), confirming the distribution of 3–5 nm Pd particles on the TiO2 surface. The XPS spectra (see Fig. S3†) also show that F elements are observed only with Nf/Pd–TiO2 but not with Pd–TiO2. The Ti 2p binding energy (464.3, 458.8 eV) in both Nf/Pd–TiO2 and Pd–TiO2 was identical to that of pure TiO2.27 The 3d band of Pd in both samples was positioned at 335.1 and 340.4 eV, which exactly matches that of pure Pd0.27

Fig. 2 shows the effect of the Nafion overlayer on the zeta potential (ζ) of suspended Pd–TiO2 particles as a function of pH and Nafion loading. The point of zero charge (PZC) of Pd–TiO2 is around 7 but the loading of Nafion drastically reduces the ζ potential to the negative direction, and the shift is larger with higher Nafion loading. This is ascribed to the fact that the anionic sulfonate groups (–SO3−) in the Nafion layer outnumber the positively charged surface functional groups (TiOH2+) even at acidic pH.24

In the photosynthetic experiments that transform CO2 into hydrocarbons, the product analysis should be done very carefully because the impurity carbon residues present in the prepared catalysts may act as the precursor of the hydrocarbons produced during the photoreaction process. The contribution of these carbon residues may lead to a false result or an overestimation of the true reduction products.21,28 Therefore, the pre-cleaning process of the catalyst should be carefully performed for an accurate test. To check the possible effect of carbon impurities on the production of hydrocarbons, the photogeneration of methane on the as-prepared catalyst was compared in the presence and absence of dissolved CO2 (see Fig. S4†). With both Pd–TiO2 and Nf/Pd–TiO2 that were not pre-cleaned, the initial production of CH4 was similar regardless of the presence of CO2, which indicates that CH4 was generated from the photo-transformation of carbon impurities on the catalyst, not from CO2 photoreduction in this case. A similar phenomenon of CH4 generation from organic impurities adsorbed on UV-irradiated TiO2 was recently reported.21b The generated methane was further degraded slowly under continuous irradiation. Therefore, the careful pre-cleaning of the prepared catalysts should be an essential step for this type of experiments. The pre-cleaning in this work was carried out by irradiating the catalyst suspension with UV light for 16 h after which no further production of methane was observed.

Fig. 3 compares the production of CH4 and C2H6 in the UV-irradiated suspension of Pd–TiO2 and Nf/Pd–TiO2. When the catalyst suspension was initially saturated with purging pure CO2 gas (99.999%), methane production was not observed probably because the dissolved CO2 concentration was too low. To dissolve more CO2, 0.2 M sodium carbonate was added into the reactor and then the pH was adjusted with perchloric acid. Upon acidifying the suspension, all carbonates should be converted to CO2(aq) (and a small fraction as H2CO3) with emission of CO2(g) to the gas phase but leaving more dissolved CO2 not only in the suspension but also in the Nafion layer. After enhancing [CO2(aq)] with carbonate addition, the photosynthetic production of CH4 and C2H6 was observed as shown in Fig. 3a and b. More methane and ethane were produced with Nf/Pd–TiO2 than with Pd–TiO2. The Nafion loading effect was optimized at around 8.3 mg Nf g−1TiO2 above or below which the photosynthetic activity was reduced (see Fig. S5†). When the Nafion layer is too thick, it should serve as a barrier layer that hinders both the diffusion of CO2 (or H2CO3) and the penetration of light onto the surface of Pd–TiO2. The dark control and photolysis control experiments did not show any sign of methane formation. To confirm that methane was generated from CO2 reduction (not from the carbon impurity transformation), an isotope experiment was carried out by comparing Na13CO3 and Na12CO3 as a carbon source (see Fig. S6†). The production of 13CH4 (m/z = 17) was analyzed by using a mass spectrometer: it was detected only when Na13CO3 was added. This confirms that methane is generated from the reduction of CO2.

(c) The production of methane (@ 5 h) and ethane (@ 1 h) at pH 1, 3, and 11 on Pd–TiO2 and Nf/Pd–TiO2. The experimental conditions were [catalyst] = 1.5 g L−1 (with 1.0 wt% Pd and 0.83 wt% Nafion), initially CO2-saturated by adding 0.2 M sodium carbonate and subsequent acidification (pH 1 and 3). 

Fig. 3c compares the pH-dependent production of CH4 and C2H6. Nf/Pd–TiO2 is more active than Pd–TiO2 for CH4 production at pH 3 and 11. The Nafion effect is insignificant at pH 1 probably because enough protons are available at the surface active (CO2 reduction) sites without the need of the Nafion layer under these extreme acidic conditions. On the other hand, the Nafion-enhanced effect is more prominent for the production of C2H6 at all pH ranges. A small amount of propane (C3H8) was also detected with Nf/Pd–TiO2, but not at all with Pd–TiO2. Considering that the production of C2H6 and C3H8 requires even more protons and electrons than that of CH4 (see eqn (6)–(8)), the photoconversion reactions that need more protons seem to be preferentially favored in the presence of the Nafion layer. This is plausible because the local proton activity within the Nafion layer might be enhanced and various intermediates involved in the formation of C2H6 and C3H8 can be stabilized in the Nafion layer to facilitate the multi-electron transfer as we mentioned earlier. Although CO2 should be present in the form of carbonate (CO32−) at pH 11, it may be present in a neutral form (CO2 and H2CO3) within the acidic Nafion layer. The photosynthetic activity markedly increases with lowering the pH because the PCET reactions (eqn (6)–(8)) are favored under acidic conditions.5,20 CO2 + 8H+ + 8ecb− → CH4 + 2H2O(6) 2CO2 + 14H+ + 14ecb− → C2H6 + 4H2O(7) 3CO2 + 20H+ + 20ecb− → C3H8 + 6H2O(8)
The production of CH4 and C2H6 was accompanied by H2 generation (reaction (5)), which was also enhanced when the Nafion layer was present on Pd–TiO2. For example, the production of H2 in 5 h irradiation with Nf/Pd–TiO2 and Pd–TiO2 was 3.5 μmol and 2.5 μmol at pH 3, respectively. Assuming that the main products are CH4, C2H6, and H2 in the present photoconversion, the apparent photonic efficiency (APE = (2PH2 + 8PCH4 + 14PC2H6)/Iin) in the Nf/Pd–TiO2 system was estimated to be 0.8% and 0.7% at pH 1 and 3, respectively (see ESI†: Iin indicates the incident photon intensity and PH2, PCH4, and PC2H6 represent the rate of hydrogen, methane, and ethane production, respectively). The APE value represents the lower limit of the quantum yield of solar fuel production because not all incident photons are absorbed and there may be other products (e.g., CO, HCOOH, CH3OH) that were not analyzed in this study.4,20,21
To confirm the stability of the Nafion layer during UV irradiation, the photosynthetic conversion of CO2 to CH4 was repetitively conducted with the same batch of catalyst as shown in Fig. 4. The amount of methane evolution gradually decreased with successive cycles (from 0 to 9 h) because the dissolved CO2 was depleted (mainly because of its transfer to the gas phase). When the suspension was replenished with carbonate addition, the production of methane increased again. It is interesting to note that the production of methane at the last cycle was doubled from that of the first cycle. This is probably because the photogenerated products such as methanol and formate (not analyzed in this study) were accumulated in the suspension during the successive photosynthetic reactions and served as a hole scavenger to enhance the electron transfer efficiency.

The experimental conditions were [catalyst] = 1.5 g L−1 (with 1.0 wt% Pd and 0.83 wt% Nafion). At the end of each cycle, the reactor was purged with CO2 gas. At the point of each arrow, [Na2CO3]0 of 0.2 M was newly added and then acidified to pH 3 to obtain a fresh CO2-saturated suspension. 
The feasibility of using natural sunlight for the photoconversion of CO2 into hydrocarbons was tested outdoors for 6 h (10 am–4 pm: June 8, 2011, Pohang, Korea, 36°N latitude) (see Fig. 5). The reaction volume and catalyst loading were the same to the previous laboratory experiments. However, the total number of incident solar photons is larger in this case because the external surface area of the quartz reactor that is exposed to sunlight is larger than that of the laboratory reactor which was irradiated through a small window (3.8 cm2).11b As a result, the production of hydrocarbons under sunlight was at least 5 times higher than that of the laboratory experiment. The production of propane was also clearly observed in the solar test.

Conclusions
Introducing a thin Nafion overlayer on Pd–TiO2 significantly increased the photosynthetic activity for CO2 reduction under UV and solar light. The main role of the Nafion overlayer seems to enhance the local proton activity within the layer to facilitate PCET reactions and to stabilize intermediates and to inhibit the re-oxidation of the CO2 reduction products. The production of hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, and propane was clearly higher with Nf/Pd–TiO2 than with Pd–TiO2. The photosynthetic activity of the Nf/Pd–TiO2 catalyst was maintained through repeated cycles of photoreaction, which confirms the stability of the Nafion layer. The proposed Nf/Pd–TiO2 should serve as a model of more practical catalysts for the artificial photosynthesis that is based on PCET reactions.

Broader context
The photosynthetic conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons such as methane is a promising method to reduce excess CO2 present in the atmosphere and to simultaneously produce solar fuels (e.g.CO, CH4 and CH3OH). However, the photoconversion efficiency of the process is very low because the activation of the thermochemically most stable CO2 requires highly energetic electrons. Since the one-electron reduction to CO2˙− is highly undesirable, a more favorable pathway is to reduce CO2 though proton-coupled multiple-electron transfers (PCET). In this study, Nafion (perfluorinated polymer with sulfonate groups) coated Pd–TiO2 particles (Nf/Pd–TiO2) were prepared and their reactivity for the photoreduction of CO2 was tested. The role of the Nafion layer is proposed to enhance the local proton activity within the layer to facilitate PCET reactions and to stabilize intermediates and to inhibit the re-oxidation of the CO2 reduction products. Nf/Pd–TiO2 is more active than Pd–TiO2 for the photo-production of hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, and propane). The photosynthetic activity of the Nf/Pd–TiO2 catalyst was maintained through repeated cycles of photoreaction, which confirms the stability of the Nafion layer. The proposed Nf/Pd–TiO2 should serve as a model of more practical catalysts for the artificial photosynthesis that is based on PCET reactions.

The experimental conditions were [catalyst] = 1.5 g L−1 (with 1.0 wt% Pd and 0.83 wt% Nafion). At the end of each cycle, the reactor was purged with CO2 gas. At the point of each arrow, [Na2CO3]0 of 0.2 M was newly added and then acidified to pH 3 to obtain a fresh CO2-saturated suspension.	 

 	Fig. 5  Outdoor solar tests for the photoconversion of CO2 into hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, and C3H8) in Nf/Pd–TiO2 suspension at pH 3 (solid line: time profile of solar light intensity).
