    , Accepted 12th August 2014First published on 12th August 2014AbstractTransition metal compounds (oxides, hydroxides, etc.) are emerging electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors (ECs) due to their rich redox properties involving multiple oxidation states and different ions. Pseudocapacitance derived from the reversible faradaic reactions can be ten times higher than those of the state-of-the-art carbon-based electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). As one of the most well-known electroactive inorganic materials, extensive studies of cobalt-based compounds (Co3O4, Co(OH)2, CoOOH, CoS, etc.) for ECs have mushroomed, and the relevant literature has grown exponentially in the past ten years. This review consolidates and evaluates the recent progress, achievements, weaknesses and challenges in the research of cobalt-based compounds and nanocomposites for ECs.

1. Introduction
In the list of the “Top Ten Problems Facing Humanity for Next 50 Years” outlined by Professor Richard E. Smalley ten years ago, among the complex, interconnected and multi-faceted grand challenges, “Energy” was prioritized as the single most important problem.1,2 Ever-increasing world energy demand, coupled with the diminishing fossil fuel reserves and environmental issues associated with fossil fuel consumption, has brought increasing pressures towards the development of clean and renewable energy sources. Successful exploitation of renewable but intermittent energy sources such as solar and wind power require efficient and reliable electrical energy storage, with electrochemical energy storage serving as the key component.3–5 Electrochemical energy storage technologies include batteries, fuel cells and electrochemical capacitors (ECs).4,6–42 The differences of the trio are best simplified by a Ragone plot.4,6,22,30 Accordingly, ECs deliver much higher power density while compensatory lower energy density than batteries. The border between batteries and ECs has been blurred with recent advancements in “high rate/power” batteries and “battery-like” pseudocapacitors. However, ECs can still be differentiated from batteries based on their operational characteristics namely: (1) symmetrical (high reversibility) and sloping charge–discharge profiles, (2) very short charge–discharge time (a few seconds), (3) exceptional cycle life, and (4) continuous variation of free energy with the degree of conversion.14,43
Based on charge storage mechanisms, ECs can be categorized into two groups: electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors (also known as redox and faradaic supercapacitors). EDLCs based on high surface area carbonaceous materials continue to expand due to their versatile forms44–53 such as activated carbons,54,55 carbon aerogels,56 carbide-derived porous carbons,57 templated-porous carbons,57 carbon nanotubes54,58–63 and graphene materials.64–70 In spite of the impressive progress, carbon-based EDLCs face a major bottleneck of its intrinsic limit of charge stored in the form of electric double layer, and thus resulting in low energy density. To increase the energy density of ECs, additional charge storage systems offered by transition metal compounds43,71–78 and conductive polymers79 present a viable alternative. Pseudocapacitance reactions involve (quasi-)reversible redox reactions at the surface of electrodes. On charging (discharging), ions (K+, H+, OH−, etc.) are inserted/adsorbed to (extracted/desorbed from) an electrode; with the electrons transferring through the external circuit.
Early research on pseudocapacitors has been focused on noble metal oxides such as RuO2 and IrO2. Notably, RuO2 is a conductive metal oxide with three oxidation states accessible within 1.2 V, exhibiting an impressive reported specific capacitance up to 1580 F g−1.22,43,80 The extremely high cost limits their use in space and military applications. Hence, cheaper base transition metal oxides such as manganese oxides, iron oxides, nickel oxides and cobalt oxides are actively studied. Among them, manganese oxides are the most investigated due to their environmental abundance and low cost, with reasonably high capacitance (normally ranged in 20–400 F g−1 with some exceptional cases near to 700 F g−1) in 1 V.73 However, their poor cycling stability, low mass loading and low density, low conductivity associated with unsatisfactory high rate capability remain to be improved.
Being widely used in electrocatalysts and secondary batteries, cobalt-based compounds and composites have also been extensively studied as pseudocapacitors. Especially in the last five years, extraordinary achievements were accomplished arising from a better understanding of materials design: specific capacitances close to the theoretical value (up to 3000 F g−1),81 high areal capacitance (25 F cm−2) based on high mass loading,82 cycling stability up to 10000 cycles,83 among others. To date, nonetheless, there is no exclusive review dedicated to this important material family. This review thus presents a timely effort to critically and comprehensively evaluate the development, in order to promote future breakthroughs in this field.
We will begin the discussion with a brief account of basic properties of cobalt compounds, followed by a detailed assessment of the triangular relationship of advanced electrode materials design through various synthesis strategies, materials properties and the resultant electrochemical performance as presented in Scheme 1. Finally, a summary and outlook for future studies is presented.

2. Basic properties of cobalt compounds
2.1 Early pseudocapacitance studies and electrochemistry of cobalt compounds
Early electrochemical studies on cobalt hydroxide or oxide electrodes were motivated by the chemical similarities between cobalt and nickel.84,85 The utilization of transition metal oxides as pseudocapacitors for electrochemical energy storage was demonstrated by the pioneering work of Conway and co-workers in the 1990s.35,86,87 In 1997, Srinivasan and Weidner electrodeposited metal hydroxide films followed by heating in air to obtain porous metal oxide films.88 Cobalt oxide electrodes exhibited a specific capacitance of ∼10 F g−1 in a two-electrode device. High surface area cobalt hydroxide xerogel powder was prepared by Lin et al.89 in 1998 using a sol–gel process. Amorphous Co(OH)2 heated at 150 °C exhibited the highest surface area (198 m2 g−1) and largest pore volume (0.43 cm3 g−1), thus presenting the highest capacitance of 291 F g−1. The capacitance was attributed to a surface redox mechanism, considering the one-electron exchange redox reaction taking place on the particle surfaces.
The electrochemical reactions and formation of different cobalt phases at the cobalt-based electrodes can be interpreted by comparing the equilibrium potentials of the current peaks with those calculated from the thermodynamics and potential–pH diagram (Pourbaix diagram).90–92 The electrode potentials calculated by Behl and Toni93 as well as the half cell reactions are presented in Table 1. In the lower potential range, the redox reaction should be related to the Co(II)/Co(III) system. While at higher potential preceding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the Co(III)/Co(IV) system should predominate. Notably, the oxidation peak of CoOOH → CoO2 is often hidden by the polarization curve of OER.93–95

2.2 Oxidation mechanism between different cobalt compounds and topotactic relationship
The understanding of the oxidation mechanism84,85,105–107 between different cobalt compounds is crucial based on two reasons: (1) the syntheses of cobalt oxide and oxyhydroxide nanomaterials often involve the transformation of intermediate phases such as cobalt hydroxide,108–121 cobalt oxyhydroxides,122–124 and cobalt carbonates;113 (2) the oxidation mechanism is relevant to the electrochemical cycling rate and stability, as well as the thermal stability of the electrodes.

2.2.1 Oxidation of Co(OH)2 to CoOOH. 
Electrochemical oxidation and chemical oxidation. 
Benson et al.84 observed the phase transition of blue Co(OH)2 (α form) to black CoOOH via anodic oxidation, while atmospheric oxidation of blue Co(OH)2 in KOH solution yielded brown CoOOH. The structurally different forms of CoOOH were possibly due to two different types of mechanisms: (1) nucleation of the new phase via a solution intermediate corresponding to the slow atmospheric oxidation, and (2) transformation of the lattice by electron and proton migration through the solid phase corresponding to the anodic oxidation.
The oxidation mechanism via electrochemical/chemical routes has been further investigated systematically.106 The positive Co(OH)2 electrode dismantled from a charged Co(OH)2/Cd cell (electrolyte: 5 M KOH) over 20 h was evaluated. It was found that the oxidation reaction was biphasic. The final product was β-CoOOH particles with irregular contours. This transformation is referred to as the metasomatic process, where dissolved chemical species react on the external surface of a solid. On the other hand, chemical oxidation of Co(OH)2 to β-CoOOH with NaClO (8 M) in 5 M KOH was pseudomorphic, aka the phase change did not change the particle morphology. Accordingly, a single particle domain consisted of several slightly disoriented coherent diffraction domains. In addition, the SAED pattern of partly transformed particles indicated the topotactic relationship between the Co(OH)2 precursor and oxidized β-CoOOH product: the [001] and [110] axis directions of the β-Co(OH)2 phase were parallel to the [003] and [110] directions of the β-CoOOH phase, respectively. Both pseudomorphic retention and topotactic relationship implied that the reaction most likely occurred in the solid state. The mosaic texture was due to the induced strain within the particles during solid state growth caused by the unit cell mismatch between the β-Co(OH)2 and β-CoOOH.
Hydrothermal oxidation. 
Chemical oxidation of Co(OH)2 in 5 M KOH under hydrothermal conditions (oxygen pressure of 20 bar) produced hexagonal β-CoOOH with irregular contours exhibiting high porosity and an internal granular structure. The oxidation reaction followed two steps: (1) partial dissolution of Co(OH)2 and growth of CoOOH on the exterior or grain boundaries of the partially dissolved Co(OH)2; (2) the initial platelet cores undergo solid state transformation, which involved a proton diffusion process. The misfit due to strain thus produced an internal mosaic structure.
Isothermal oxidation. 
By isothermal heating in an air flow or water suspension, Figlarz et al.105 studied the solid evolution of β-Co(OH)2 (rose color) to CoOOH. Isothermal heating of β-Co(OH)2 at 60 °C in an air flow produced CoOOH particles with fine porosity and cracks. The decreased crystallite sizes deduced from the (101) diffractions based on the Scherrer formula were 8, 6, 7 nm, at 60, 80 and 100 °C respectively. Furthermore, the phase transformation was topotactic as revealed by SAED. The hexagonal unit cell axes of CoOOH were parallel to the unit cell axes of Co(OH)2 although the CoOOH crystallites were more misoriented.


2.2.2 Oxidation of CoOOH to Co3O4. 
Based on XRD results, CoOOH totally decomposed to Co3O4 by heating in air at 250 °C.107 The major morphology of CoOOH was retained, the inhomogeneous porosity of CoOOH however turned to Co3O4 of regular porosity with tiny round pores. According to the SAED pattern, the thermal transformation was a topotactic reaction with [001] and [111] axis directions of the CoOOH phase parallel to [110] and [110] axis directions of the Co3O4 phase. Moreover, the {110} CoOOH reflections were not separated from the {440} Co3O4 reflections due to the very close value of their interplanar spacings (1.425 Å for CoOOH d110 and 1.429 Å for Co3O4 d440).


2.2.3 Oxidation of Co(OH)2 to CoO or Co3O4. 
Topotactic transformation of Co(OH)2 → CoO125 and Co(OH)2 → Co3O4 (ref. 119 and 126) has also been reported. β-Co(OH)2 has a brucite-like layered structure with an interlayer spacing of 4.65 Å, while spinel Co3O4 has a cubic structure with 3-fold symmetry viewed along [111]. Thus, the β-Co(OH)2 to Co3O4 transition is topotactic with the relationship [001] Co(OH)2//[111] Co3O4.

3. Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) electrodes
3.1 Powder electrodes

3.1.1 Chemical precipitation127–136. 
During chemical precipitation, various process parameters are controlled to obtain Co3O4 with desirable composition, structure, morphology and properties.127,128,134,135,137–142 By tuning the amount, combination and feeding order of various reactants, Wang et al. achieved controllable synthesis of cobalt oxalates of different morphologies.127 Cobalt oxalates decomposed to Co3O4 upon calcination, largely with their original morphologies conserved. The BET specific surface area of Co3O4 nanorods, nanowires and layered parallel folding (LPF) nanostructures was 45.1, 35.6 and 75.9 m2 g−1. The average pore diameters were 17.28, 19.37 and 8.58 nm for the Co3O4 nanorods, nanowires and LPF nanostructures. Correspondingly, the samples exhibited specific capacitances of ∼128 (nanorods), ∼103 (nanowires) and ∼203 (LPF nanostructures) F g−1. The higher capacitances demonstrated by the LPF nanostructures can be attributed to their higher surface area, smaller pores and particle sizes which shorten the diffusion length of OH− ions. Morphologies influence the surface area and porosity of electrode materials and thus determine the resultant charge storage properties.127,141
Heat treatment temperatures also affected the textural properties of a material. As the calcination temperature to convert Co(OH)2 microflowers into Co3O4 porous microflowers increased from 300 to 500 °C, the crystal sizes and pore diameter enlarged.128 The BET specific surface areas for the samples heat-treated at 300, 400 and 500 °C were 77.33, 32.02 and 12 m2 g−1, respectively. The decreasing surface areas of the samples with the increasing calcination temperatures were due to nanocrystals aggregation. As expected, the sample calcined at 300 °C presented a higher specific capacitance (160 F g−1) than the samples calcined at 400 °C (88 F g−1) and 500 °C (71 F g−1).
Guerlou-Demourgues and co-workers prepared Co3O4 by chemical precipitation in ternary alkaline medium of KOH (8 M), NaOH (0.5 M) and LiOH (0.5 M).129 Their work dealt with the development of conductive spinel cobalt oxide, which is a significant aspect for high performance ECs. Generally pure Co3O4 possesses a normal cubic spinel structure (space group Fd3m) and is insulating. In the presence of LiOH, conductive nanosized cobalt oxides containing hydrogen and lithium within the structure and exhibiting a high electronic conductivity (10−1 S cm−1 at room temperature) were prepared. The markedly improved conductivity was due to the presence of Co4+ ions which ensure a charge balance and thus allow an electronic delocalization in the octahedral network.130 The average oxidation state of cobalt determined by the iodometric titration method was higher in this conductive Co3O4 (2.81) than in the ideal spinel (2.67). With only 5% of carbon black additive in the composite electrode, the maximum specific capacitance of 320 F g−1 was obtained.
Using anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) as a hard template, Xu et al. obtained Co3O4 nanotube bundles after precipitation, heat treatment and template removal.131 The BET specific surface area and the pore sizes of the Co3O4 nanotubes were 218 m2 g−1 and 38–110 nm, respectively. The specific capacitances of the Co3O4 nanotubes were 574, 551, 538 and 484 F g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 A g−1, respectively. The electrode also demonstrated good cycling stability to retain 95% of the capacitance after 1000 cycles. Polystyrene (PS) spheres and carbowax (polyethylene glycol) were used as templates to fabricate mesoporous Co3O4 and meso–macroporous Co3O4 electrodes. The meso–macroporous Co3O4 electrode exhibited a highest specific capacitance of 453 F g−1. Su and co-workers132 applied saw dust with particle sizes of 0.3–2 nm as a template to synthesize Co3O4 nanoparticles with a highest specific capacitance of 290 F g−1.
Cao and co-workers133 prepared a series of mesoporous Co3O4 nanoparticles by using mesoporous silicas, KIT-6 and SBA-15, as templates. The BET surface area and porosity of mesoporous Co3O4 nanoparticles could be tuned by different KIT-6 templates with different textural parameters. The specific capacitances decreased with the increase of the calcination temperature due to the decrease of the BET surface area. The specific capacitance of the sample with the highest BET surface area of 184.8 m2 g−1 was 370 F g−1. Large pore size and high order of mesopores in the sample facilitated ion transfer. However, the electrochemical results indicated that the interior surface of the mesoporous sample was not fully utilized probably due to the weak electrical conductivity of the metal oxide.
Thermal treatment of various precipitated precursors, such as the cobalt–citrate complex134 and cobalt acetate hydroxide135 led to mesoporous structures and hollow boxes of Co3O4 with the highest capacitances of ∼427 F g−1 and ∼278 F g−1, respectively.


3.1.2 Hydrothermal/solvothermal method143–157. 
Hydrothermal or solvothermal synthesis is a group of methods to crystallize inorganic substances from aqueous (thus named hydrothermal) or organic (thus named solvothermal) solutions at elevated vapour pressures and temperatures.143,144 In comparison to co-precipitation and sol–gel methods, the products of hydro/solvothermal are crystalline, eliminating the necessity of post-annealing in some cases.145 Overall, hydro/solvothermal methods offer benefits such as high reaction yield, low costs of equipment setup and reagents, energy efficiency and the versatility of controllable parameters.145–147 Through hydrothermal synthesis, both powder and thin-film (grown on current collectors) electrodes can be conveniently prepared via different nucleation and growth routes.
By tuning the volume ratio of water to ethanolamine, β-Co(OH)2 hexagonal nanosheets or microspheres self-assembled from nanosheets were synthesized.148 Pure phase spinel mesoporous Co3O4 were obtained by thermal treatment of β-Co(OH)2. The BET specific surface area and micropore area were 25.12 and 2.80 m2 g−1 for the Co3O4 nanosheets, 21.53 and 1.29 m2 g−1 for the Co3O4 microspheres, respectively. The average pore diameters were 26.7 and 23.5 nm for the Co3O4 nanosheets and microspheres respectively. The specific capacitances of the Co3O4 nanosheets were 92, 91, 90 and 85 F g−1 at 5, 10, 15, 20 mA cm−2. By reacting cobalt salt and urea under hydrothermal conditions followed by a thermal treatment, Co3O4 nanorods with specific capacitances of 281 and 456 F g−1 were obtained.149,150
Controllable synthesis of cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanostructures with different morphologies and their thermal conversion to pure phase Co3O4 nanostructures were reported.151–154 Among the different samples (needle-like nanorods, leaf-like nanosheets, microparticles) synthesized in PEG–H2O medium,150 needle-like nanorods presented the highest capacitance as expected from the BET specific surface area. The Co3O4 nanorods possessed a BET specific surface area of 121.5 m2 g−1, compared to 86.16 and 110.2 m2 g−1 for leaf-like nanosheets and microparticles respectively. The specific capacitances for the nanorods, nanosheets and microparticles were 111, 44 and 62 F g−1 respectively. Porous Co3O4 nanowires thermally converted from the long Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O nanowires exhibited an improved specific capacitance of 260 F g−1.152
By a suitable choice of surface directing agents (e.g. neutral surfactant Triton X-100 and biomolecule, lysine), Co3O4 complex architectures such as micrometer-length ultralayered structures155 and urchin-like Co3O4 microspherical hierarchical superstructures156 were synthesized. The microscopic ultralayers with high surface area (97 m2 g−1) and mesopore volume (0.2 cm3 g−1) allowed quicker electrolyte permeation by reducing the diffusion time of OH− ions, and secured sufficient Faradaic reactions at high rate. The specific capacitances were 604, 548, 474, 359 and 167 F g−1 at 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 A g−1. The oriented Co3O4 nanowires in the radial organization as shown in Fig. 1a–d created abundant V-shape porous channels that would facilitate the fast electrolyte penetration into the complex structures and react with the electroactive surfaces.156 An optimized ionic diffusion pathway is necessary to reduce the ionic diffusion resistance and charge transfer resistance, in order to achieve high electrochemical utilization at high rates. Each Co3O4 nanowire was formed by many connected Co3O4 nanoparticles (10–50 nm). The superstructures were stable even under prolonged ultrasonication. A type-IV N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm with a hysteresis loop in the range of ca. 0.5–1.0 P/P0 indicated that the sample possessed multi-modal and hierarchical macro/mesoporosity. The BET specific surface area, BJH average pore diameter and mesopore volume were ca. 113 m2 g−1, 28 nm and 0.32 cm3 g−1, respectively. The specific capacitances at 1 and 4 A g−1 were 614 and 536 F g−1 respectively. Based on the BET specific surface area, the capacitance attributable to the EDLC was estimated to be ca. 23 F g−1.

The morphology evolution of nanorods to sheaf-like bundles, to flower-like structures, to dumbbell-like particles, and eventually twin-spheres with an urchin-like structure was presented.157 The proposed multi-step splitting growth mechanism provided a chance to control the morphology of different dimensionalities and structures. The resultant 3D hierarchical Co3O4 twin spheres fabricated into electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of 781 F g−1, high rate capability and cycling stability.


3.1.3 Sol–gel method158,159. 
Hu and colleagues prepared cobalt oxide aerogels via an epoxy-mediated sol–gel procedure, followed by supercritical carbon dioxide drying and calcination.158 In the thermal treatment, they observed an increase of Co3O4 grain size from 8 to 12 nm with increasing calcination temperature from 200 to 400 °C. The highest specific surface area of 235 m2 g−1 was observed for samples calcined at 200 °C, followed by a drastic drop to 123 m2 g−1 at 300 °C and 69 m2 g−1 at 400 °C. All aerogel samples exhibited type IV isotherms and type H3 hysteresis loops typical for mesoporous features. The specific capacitances (potential window: 0.23–0.53 V) were 623, 239, 174 F g−1 for Co3O4 aerogels calcined at 200, 300 and 400 °C, respectively. Clearly, the specific capacitances decreased with the lowering of specific surface areas, consistent with the observations made by Popov et al.89
Lee and co-workers presented a sol–gel route coupled with a freeze-drying method to synthesize interconnected macro–/mesoporous Co3O4 nanocrystals.159 Comparatively, cryogel offers several advantageous features: (1) higher porosity due to low surface tension during drying, (2) enabling a macroporous structure from an ice-templated effect, and (3) lower agglomerations. The sample prepared by using triblock polymer P123 as a template at pH 3 exhibited a BET surface area of 82.8 m2 g−1. Although the surface area of the sample was lower than those of previous sol–gel synthesized cobalt oxide samples,89,158 it demonstrated a higher specific capacitance of 742 F g−1.

3.2 Thin film electrodes

3.2.1 Hydrothermal/solvothermal method160–167. 
Co3O4 nanoflower structures on Ni foam were prepared via solvothermal synthesis followed by post-annealing.160 The nanosheets were grown on the entire surface of Ni foam at various angles, offering efficient electron transport channels (Fig. 2a and b). The sample post-annealed at 250 °C exhibited specific capacitances of ∼1937, ∼1518, ∼1377, ∼1309 F g−1 at the current densities of 0.2, 1, 2, 3 A g−1 in a narrow potential window of 0–0.34 V. Nevertheless, the electrode suffered from a considerable loss of 21.8% capacitance after 1000 cycles, possibly due to the material dissolution in high concentration KOH electrolyte (6 M).

Zhang et al.161 deposited Co3O4 nanoparticles on a Ni sheet by a hydrothermal method without a post-annealing step (Fig. 2c and d). The authors noted that the pre-etching step of the Ni sheet determines the phase of cobalt compounds: β-Co(OH)2 was formed on a HCl-etched Ni sheet but Co3O4 was formed on a HNO3-etched Ni sheet. Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) with a mean size ranging from 50–150 nm with mesopores between neighbouring NPs were observed. The porosity helped the electrolyte ions to penetrate into the inner electrode and come into contact with a larger electroactive surface for Faradaic reactions. A specific capacitance of 928 F g−1 was obtained at 1.2 A g−1. When the current density was increased to 12 A g−1, 84% (776 F g−1) of the specific capacitance was retained, showing a high rate capability. Mesoporous Co3O4 nanowire arrays were also prepared on HCl-etched Ni foam.162 The sample exhibited improved capacitances of 1160 and 861 F g−1 at 2 and 20 A g−1 respectively, demonstrating 71% capacitance retention when the charge–discharge current density was increased from 2 to 20 A g−1.
Co3O4 nanowire arrays were grown on the seed-coated substrates (Ni foil, Ni foam and Si wafer).163 Without the presence of oxygen, only interconnected Co(OH)2 nanowalls were obtained. An annealing step was required to transform the mixed phases to the pure Co3O4 phase. The nanowires exhibited porous structures with roughened walls and a hollow center. The porosity allows easier electrolyte penetration, while roughened walls and the hollow center present a high surface-to-bulk ratio for ion transport and diffusion. The hollow Co3O4 nanowire arrays exhibited specific capacitances of 295 and 599 F g−1 before and after 1000-cycle activation. A capacitance retention of 73% was observed when the current density was increased from 2 A g−1 to 40 A g−1. Notably, a high Co3O4 mass loading of 15 mg cm−2 was used in their study and thus a high areal capacitance (∼9 F cm−2) was achieved. After 7500 cycles, the sample retained 91% and 82% of the highest capacitance value at 2 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The same research group also successfully prepared Co3O4 nanowire arrays on Ni foam by the hydrothermal method with an annealing step.164 In the presence of NH4F as a surface-directing agent, smooth and very long (25 μm) single-crystalline cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanowires were obtained (Fig. 2e and f). After annealing in argon, rough Co3O4 nanowires consisting of interconnected nanoparticles with high mesoporosity were obtained and attributed to the release of CO2 and H2O during the thermal conversion process (Fig. 2g and h). After activation, the specific capacitances were 754 and 610 F g−1 at 2 and 40 A g−1 respectively, presenting an excellent high rate capability. The electrode exhibited remarkable cycling stability for 4000 cycles.
Beside single-component nanostructures, Yang et al. reported the synthesis of hierarchical Co3O4 nanosheet @ nanowire arrays (NSWA) on Ni foam (Fig. 3).165 The hierarchical structures involved firstly the formation of nanosheet arrays on Ni foam and secondly the growth of the nanowires around the nanosheets. NH4F was an essential additive in the hydrothermal synthesis. In the absence of NH4F, the mass loading of Co3O4 NSWA was only less than 1.5 mg cm−2, about 5 times lower when the sample was synthesized in the presence of NH4F. In addition, the presence of NH4F helped to increase the adhesion between Co3O4 NSWA and the substrate. The specific capacitances of the Co3O4 NSWA were 715 and 491 F g−1 (5.44 and 3.73 F cm−2) at 5 and 30 mA cm−2, respectively. In comparison, single-component Co3O4 nanosheet arrays and nanowire arrays exhibited lower specific capacitance or inferior rate capability. The enhanced capacitance and rate capability were undoubtedly attributed to the synergistic effect of the three-dimensional architecture of the hierarchical structures. Higher electroactive surface area, hierarchical porosity and open space, enhanced electrolyte–electrode contact area and good adhesion between current-collector and active materials are all positive factors leading to an impressively high capacitance, especially an areal capacitance of ∼5.44 F cm−2.

By employing monolayer polystyrene spheres as templates, Duan and Cao fabricated a hierarchical porous Co3O4 film composed of monolayer hollow sphere arrays and porous net-like nanoflakes.166 The individual nanoflake was composed of nanoparticles with the size of ∼5 to 15 nm which showed continuous pores ranging from 2–5 nm. Compared with the Co3O4 nanoflakes synthesized without the template, the hierarchical porous Co3O4 film exhibited smaller potential separation between redox peaks and better reaction reversibility. The hierarchical porous Co3O4 film also had smaller polarization during the charge–discharge processes. The specific capacitances of the hierarchical porous Co3O4 film and Co3O4 nanoflakes were 352 and 325 F g−1 respectively at 2 A g−1. For the hierarchical porous Co3O4 film and Co3O4 nanoflakes, 82.7% and 66.8% of the capacitance were retained when discharge current density was increased from 2 to 40 A g−1. In addition, the hierarchical porous Co3O4 film also presented better cycling stability.


3.2.2 Chemical bath deposition168–181. 
Chemical bath deposition (CBD, or known as chemical solution deposition), is a simple wet chemical technique to deposit wide varieties of thin films on various substrates.168–171 CBD involves the occurrence of a relatively slow chemical reaction in solution resulting in the formation of a solid reaction product on a substrate. Similar chemical precursors can be used for CBD, hydrothermal methods and chemical precipitation. However, the hydrothermal method involves the use of a sealed autoclave and higher temperature synthesis; while the main product of chemical precipitation appears as powders.
Co3O4 nanowire arrays were deposited on Ni foam172 and the Ti substrate173 by an ammonia-evaporation method.174 The open space between the loosely packed nanowires allows easy diffusion of the electrolyte into the inner region of the electrode, resulting in reduced internal resistance and improved capacitance. With a high mass loading of 16 mg cm−2, the sample on Ni foam exhibited a high specific capacitance of 746 F g−1 in 6 M KOH.172 However, the capacitance decreased to 86% after 500 cycles. Using KOH of higher concentration, the specific capacitance increased with more pronounced redox peaks, due to the decreased internal resistance and electrolyte starvation near the material surface. The Co3O4 nanowires grown on the Ti substrate were further deposited by Ag nanoparticles. The specific capacitance of the Co3O4 nanowires–Ag was found to be 1006 F g−1, higher than 922 F g−1 of the pristine Co3O4 nanowires. More importantly, Ag deposition improved the rate capability substantially from 54.2% to 95% (capacitance retention at 10 A g−1 compared to 2 A g−1). Both the electrodes demonstrated good cycling life by retaining more than 95% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles.
Lokhande and co-workers deposited a cobalt oxide layer onto copper substrates by controlled hydrolysis of the hexamine complex.175 The maximum specific capacitance of 118 F g−1 for the sample was obtained at 1.5 M KOH electrolyte. The current under the CV curve decreased by 4.71% up to 500 cycles. On a side note, it has been widely reported that Cu substrates reacted with basic solutions (e.g. NaOH and ammonia) to form Cu(OH)2 and CuO nanostructures on the surface.176–179 Consequently, the possibility of capacitance contributed by copper oxide/hydroxide as well as long term stability of copper substrates as current collectors in alkaline electrolytes need to be further clarified.
Huang et al.180 prepared a porous Co3O4 thin film composed of spherical coarse particles on an ITO coated glass plate. The sample exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 227 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 but reduced to 152 F g−1 (67%) when the current density was increased to 1.4 A g−1. The specific capacitance dropped substantially to 66% after 500 cycles and remained stable up to 1000 cycles. The capacitance loss was believed to be associated with the loss of active material due to dissolution or detachment during early cycles. Mitlin's group has grown various Co3O4 micro/nanostructures (e.g. lath-like, necklace-like and net-like morphologies) on Ni foam by simply tuning the bath temperature.181 Among the different morphologies, Co3O4 net-like structures presented the best specific capacitance of 1090 F g−1 with a mass loading of 1.4 mg cm−2.


3.2.3 Electrodeposition182–186. 
Srinivasan and Weidner compared electrodeposited cobalt oxide's performance as either positive or negative electrodes in devices.182 In addition, the capacitances of Co(OH)2 and Co3O4 heat-treated at different temperatures were studied, along with the charge storage mechanism. When electrodeposited Co(OH)2 was heated to temperatures between 100 and 350 °C, the capacitance of the film decreased. For films heated to 300 °C and below, CVs showed the presence of a redox reaction in addition to electric double layer (EDL) capacitance. Notably, the authors commented that, at low temperature, the occurrence of H+ diffusion allows the bulk material to be accessed, while on heating, the reaction shifts to OH− adsorption on the surface. Overall, the Co3O4 film exhibited specific capacitances of 76 and 164 F g−1 as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively.
Lee et al.183 prepared different electrodeposited Co3O4 thin films on ITO glass substrates in the absence or presence of surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Without surfactant, the sample displayed a dendrite like morphology, while the sample prepared in the presence of 1% CTAB exhibited a sphere-like morphology with a mean pore size of 3–4 nm and a wall thickness of 3–4 nm. In comparison, the specific capacitance of Co3O4–CTAB (491 F g−1) was higher than those of Co3O4–SDS (373 F g−1) and Co3O4-without surfactant (255 F g−1).
Wu et al.184 prepared a Co3O4 film of vertically aligned interconnected nanowalls on Ni foam by cathodic electrodeposition followed by annealing. The open spaces between the nanowalls had a diameter of 30 to 300 nm, providing huge porosity for electrolyte diffusion and sufficient contact between the active materials and electrolyte. In comparison, the specific capacitances of the Co3O4 nanowall film and Co3O4 dense film were 325 and 230 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, respectively. In addition, the Co3O4 nanowall film exhibited a higher discharge plateau and a lower charge plateau, indicating lower internal resistance and smaller polarization. When the current density was increased 20 times to 40 A g−1, the Co3O4 nanowall film retained the specific capacitance at 76.0%, while the Co3O4 dense film secured the specific capacitance at 72.6%. Moreover, the porous film of Co3O4 nanowalls possessed better cycling stability over the dense film. After 2000 cycles, the porous film of Co3O4 nanowalls preserved its original structure, but many cracks were present in the dense film probably due to the volume change during charge–discharge cycles.
Alternatively, electrodeposition methods can be employed in the presence of template structures to replicate a wide variety of structures. By using a liquid crystalline template, Yuan et al.185 prepared a hierarchically porous Co3O4 film of interconnected porous nanowalls. In contrast to the sample prepared without the liquid crystalline template,184 the nanoflakes present a continuous net-like structure possessing fine pores of 5–25 nm. Nanoparticles in the nanoflakes showed mesoporous walls with mesopores of 2–3 nm. The hierarchical porous Co3O4 film showed a 37% increment of specific capacitance (443 F g−1) compared to the Co3O4 film prepared without the liquid crystalline template.184 The capacitance remained at 94.3% of the maximum specific capacitance after 3000 cycles. Tu and co-workers186 used polystyrene (PS) spheres as a template to prepare Co3O4 monolayer hollow sphere arrays. The skeleton of the arrays was made of interconnected 600 nm hollow spheres, and the interstices between the hollow spheres were filled with Co3O4 nanoflakes. The sample exhibited a specific capacitance of 358 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and retained 85% of the capacitance when the current density was increased to 40 A g−1. Upon cycling, the capacitance increased up to 500 cycles and remained constant over 4000 cycles, displaying excellent stability.


3.2.4 Spray deposition187,188. 
Spray pyrolysis is a solution deposition technique by spraying the solution (aerosol) directly on a heated substrate surface. By spraying a cobalt chloride solution onto heated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates, the formed Co3O4 grainy thin film exhibited specific and areal capacitances of 74 F g−1 and 32 mF cm−2.187 On the other hand, Guduru's group presented a solution precursor plasma deposition route to prepare a nanostructured and porous Co3O4 thin film on a stainless steel sheet.188 The high temperatures of plasma plume accelerated the thermo-chemical conversion of cobalt acetate solution into Co3O4 agglomerates or fused particles. The Co3O4 thin film possessed a specific capacitance of ∼250 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and this reduced to ∼150 F g−1 when the current density was increased to 4.5 A g−1. However, the thin film suffered from a capacitance loss of 27.8% after 1000 cycles.

4. Cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) electrodes
4.1 Powder electrodes

4.1.1 Chemical precipitation189–193. 
Mesoporous α-Co(OH)2 with a high BET surface area of 283 m2 g−1, a pore size distribution of 2–50 nm and an average pore size of 11 nm was synthesized by chemical precipitation.189 A specific capacitance of 341 F g−1 was obtained for the mesoporous α-Co(OH)2. The α-Co(OH)2 electrode experienced a considerable loss of 19% capacitance after 700 cycles. Subsequently, the same research group applied an ultrasonic-assisted precipitation to obtain β-Co(OH)2 whisker-like structures.190 The β-Co(OH)2 nanowhisker sample possessed a BET surface area of 112 m2 g−1 and a specific capacitance of 325 F g−1 at 20 mA cm−2 (1.33 A g−1). When the charge–discharge current density was increased to 80 mA cm−2 (5.33 A g−1), the electrode retained 85.8% (279 F g−1) of the highest specific capacitance. More importantly, the electrode demonstrated an improved cycling life and retained 93% of the initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles.
Two different series of α-Co(OH)2 with different intercalated anions (Cl−, NO3−, CH3COOH−, SO42− and dodecyl sulfate, benzoate, nitrate) were synthesized by two different research groups.191,192 The intercalated anions of different radii presented critical effects on the structural, morphological, compositional and surface properties of the α-Co(OH)2 products. For example, the specific capacitances of the samples with intercalated chloride, nitrate, acetate and sulfate were 697, 638, 526 and 420 F g−1 respectively. It is interesting to note that although the sample with intercalated sulfate possessed a smaller crystallite size, more disordered structure and almost perfect alveolate nanostructure with a large surface area, this sample gave poorer specific capacitance. This phenomenon was explained by the hydrogen bonding between the interlayer water molecules and OH groups bound to cobalt ions, and the affinity between the intercalated anions and protons. Hydrogen bonding may be beneficial to mitigating polarization of the electrode or enhancing utilization of the active materials. As shown by TG-DTG analysis and IR spectra, the content of interlayer water in the intercalated samples decreased in the order of chloride, nitrate, acetate and sulfate anions. The electrodes underwent degradation during continuous cycling for 100 cycles, thus resulting in noticeable capacitance loss.
Kong et al.193 employed a low temperature (10 °C) method to prepare α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes by precipitation, followed by heat treatment in air at different temperatures. After heating at 150 °C and higher temperatures, the samples were converted to spinel Co3O4.The as-synthesized α-Co(OH)2 showed loosely packed and interconnected nanoflakes. After heat treatment, the nanoflakes grew to a stacking structure due to the loss of H2O during annealing. The BET specific surface area of the α-Co(OH)2 and Co3O4 materials obtained at 100 and 250 °C was 85.4 and 71 m2 g−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the pore size distribution of the α-Co(OH)2 and Co3O4 was 4–20 and 5–50 nm, respectively. The specific capacitances of the α-Co(OH)2 electrode were 735, 702, 637.5 and 609 F g−1, respectively at 5, 10, 20 and 30 mA cm−2. With increasing annealing temperatures, the capacitances of converted Co3O4 electrodes decreased due to the decrease in surface area.


4.1.2 Hydrothermal method194–196. 
Zhang and co-workers developed biomolecule-assisted hydrothermal processes to synthesize different Co(OH)2 mesocrystals and nano-superstructures.194–196 When lysine was used, three-dimensional urchin-like β-Co(OH)2 microspheres were obtained.193 The oriented nanowires in a radial form created abundant V-shape porous channels. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm revealed that the sample possessed multi-modal and hierarchical macro- and mesoporosity. Pore size distribution showed a peak at ∼4.7 nm attributable to mesopores in the nanowires, and another peak at 20–100 nm attributable to the V-shape porous channels. In summary, the hierarchical 3D nanostructures exhibited a BET specific surface area of 101 m2 g−1, a mesopore volume of 0.3 cm3 g−1 and an average pore size of 15 nm. The specific capacitance of the β-Co(OH)2 sample was 421 F g−1 at 10 mA cm−2 (∼1.33 A g−1) and remained at 370 F g−1 when the current density was increased to 40 mA cm−2 (∼5.33 A g−1). After continuous 1000 cycles, the specific capacitance of the electrode decreased by ∼3.6%. Flowerlike β-Co(OH)2 hierarchical superstructures self-assembled from mesoporous (∼3 nm) nanobelts were synthesized when Co(SO4)2·6H2O was used as the cobalt precursor.196 When L-arginine was used as a hydrolysis-controlling agent,195 α-Co(OH)2 triangular nanosheets with a thickness of ∼10 nm (Fig. 4) were synthesized. Each porous nanosheet was composed of many isolated nanocrystals of 2–3 nm. Further analysis by SAED (Fig. 4h) presented a clear spotted pattern which is associated with single crystallinity characteristic of the mesocrystals. The narrow pore size distribution of the mesocrystal nanosheets was centered at 1.6 nm. At 10 mA g−1 (∼1.33 A g−1) and 40 mA g−1 (∼5.33 A g−1), the α-Co(OH)2 mesocrystal nanosheets displayed specific capacitances of 506 and 427 F g−1, respectively. The electrode showed good cycling stability to retain 97.0% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles.

4.2 Thin film electrodes

4.2.1 Hydrothermal method197,198. 
Besides growing various Co(OH)2 nanostructures in the form of powder, the hydrothermal route also allows the growth of Co(OH)2 nanostructures directly onto substrates.197,198 The one-dimensional and well-aligned nanowire arrays grown directly on substrates established efficient and fast electron transport pathways, and it is able to reduce the ionic diffusion to the inner part of the electrodes, thus improving the utilization of the active materials. The specific capacitance of the binder and additive-free α-Co(OH)2 electrode was ∼643 F g−1.196


4.2.2 Electrochemical deposition199–210. 
Gupta et al.199 fabricated α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets on stainless steel by cathodic potentiostatic deposition. The thickness of the nanosheets was 10 nm and the thickness of the deposit was several micrometers. For an α-Co(OH)2 mass loading of 0.8 mg cm−2, specific capacitances of 881 and 772 F g−1 were obtained at 1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The studies showed that the electrode exhibited remarkably high rate capability and cycling stability.
Ordered mesoporous α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets were electrodeposited on Ni foam and the Ti plate, using liquid crystals as the surface directing agent.200–202 The low angle XRD pattern of the designated HI-e Co(OH)2 sample exhibited a well-defined peak at 2θ = 1.42° corresponding to a d-spacing of 6.2 nm and a pore-to-pore distance of 7.2 nm. The ordered mesoporosity was contributed from the templating effect of the lyotropic liquid crystalline; this was further confirmed by the absence of low angle diffraction for the Aq-e Co(OH)2 sample electrodeposited without the template. Comparatively, the HI-e Co(OH)2 presented a more uniform, continuous and dense growth of interlaced nanosheets (Fig. 5), while the Aq-e Co(OH)2 exhibited a discontinuous distribution of coarse and aggregated nanosheets. Under TEM observation, the HI-e Co(OH)2 nanosheet showed a well-ordered mesoporous structure consisting of cylindrical pores of about 3 nm arranged on a hexagonal lattice. The pore wall thickness was about 4 nm with the center-to-center pore distance of about 7 nm. The specific capacitances of the HI-e Co(OH)2 and Aq-e Co(OH)2 deposited on Ti plates were 1084 and 370 F g−1, respectively. The remarkably improved capacitance of the HI-e Co(OH)2 was attributed to the nanoscale ordered mesoporosity and the corresponding higher surface area. In comparison with the planar Ti plate, Ni foam with large cavities allowed better dispersion of the α-Co(OH)2 mesoporous nanosheets, as well as easy penetration of the electrolyte to access the active materials. Specific capacitances of 2646 and 2274 F g−1 were obtained at 8 and 48 A g−1 respectively for the HI-e Co(OH)2 deposited on Ni foam.
 Fig. 5  SEM and TEM images of HI-e Co(OH)2 nanosheets deposited at various deposition potentials at 50 °C. (a and d) −0.65 V, (b and e) −0.75 V and (c and f) −0.85 V. Adapted with permission from ref. 202, ©2008 Elsevier. 
Most reported cobalt oxide and cobalt hydroxide electrodes exhibited pseudocapacitance in a limited potential window, which eventually limits the energy and power density of their devices. Nayak and Munichandraiah reported an effort to understand the origin of the small potential window of electrodeposited Co(OH)2 and to tune the potential window by varying the electrolyte and its concentration.203 They have found that the anodic and cathodic current peaks became increasingly broader by decreasing the NaOH concentration to 0.5 M, 0.1 M and 0.05 M (Fig. 6a). In addition, the peak potentials shifted towards the positive direction. The OER potential extended to about 0.85 V in 0.05 M NaOH. On the other hand, when Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte, the OER commenced at about 1.30 V (Fig. 6b). Specific capacitances obtained in 1 M, 0.1 M and 0.05 M NaOH were 487, 390 and 375 F g−1 in potential windows of 0.60, 0.75, 0.85 V, respectively. Despite the lower capacitance when 0.05 M NaOH was used, it offered a higher energy density and power density due to the larger potential window.

Chou et al. prepared 20–30 nm amorphous Co(OH)2 nanoflakes on stainless steel mesh by galvanostatic electrodeposition followed by annealing at 150 °C.204 For the smallest mass loading of 0.14 mg cm−2, the specific capacitance was 562 F g−1 at 0.1 mA cm−2. When the mass loading was increased to 0.62 mg cm−2 the specific capacitance decreased by less than 5%. After 3000 cycles, the electrode suffered a loss of 19%. Importantly, the authors analyzed the CV curves after 50 and 3000 cycles, which showed that the amorphous Co(OH)2 gradually transformed to Co3O4 during cycling. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the electrochemically active specific surface area of the electrode remained virtually unchanged after 3000 cycles, indicating that the capacitance loss after 3000 cycles was due to the phase conversion.
Dai's group synthesized Co(OH)2 nanoflakes on etched Ni foam by cathodic potentiostatic deposition in water and water–ethanol (1:1) mixed solution.205 They found that the Co(OH)2 nanoflakes deposited in water–ethanol (2369 F g−1) possessed higher specific capacitance than Co(OH)2 nanoflakes deposited in water (1035 F g−1). The significantly higher specific capacitance of Co(OH)2 nanoflakes deposited in water–ethanol was attributed to characteristics of ethanol that can reduce the surface strain and improve the attachment between the Ni foam and liquid boundary during deposition. In addition, ethanol was possibly embedded into the layered structure of Co(OH)2 to increase the layer distance between crystal lattices, thus enhancing the reversibility of the Co2+/Co3+ redox reaction.
Ma's group added various amounts of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) in their deposition solutions for cathodic potentiostatic deposition of Co(OH)2 nanosheets on stainless steel.206 In the presence of 20% NMP, the densest Co(OH)2 nanosheets of 10 nm thickness were obtained. The specific capacitances of the Co(OH)2 samples prepared with 0, 10, 20, 30 vol% NMP in the deposition electrolyte were 473, 571, 651 and 473 F g−1, respectively. Clearly, the best capacitance was achieved by the sample prepared with 20 vol% NMP in the deposition electrolyte. Although the electrode exhibited good rate capability, the electrode experienced a considerable loss of capacitance upon continuous cycling and only retained 76% after 500 cycles. The declining capacitance was probably due to slow oxidation of Co(OH)2 to CoOOH and “peeling off” of the active materials from the current collector. In another report, Kong et al. investigated the effects of deposition conditions, type of substrates, and concentration of cobalt precursor solution on the performance of electrodeposited α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets.207 The Co(OH)2 film deposited for 100 s was found to exhibit the highest specific capacitance. Beyond the deposition time of 100 s, the specific capacitance decreased due to the blockage of pores by nanosheets grown on top of the surface. For the cathodic deposition potential, the α-Co(OH)2 film prepared at −1 V exhibited the highest specific capacitance. When a more positive potential was applied, the deposition rate became slow and the film structure was compact with smaller pores that may not be favorable for electrolyte access.
In contrast, when the applied potential became more negative, the growth of crystals was too fast and films with lower specific capacitance were obtained. In addition, it was shown that the capacitance of α-Co(OH)2 deposited on Ni foam was about 2 times higher than that on the planar Ni plate. The CV curve of the α-Co(OH)2 film deposited on Ni foam consisted of two pairs of redox peaks whereas that deposited on the Ni plate only consisted of one pair of redox peaks. The additional pair of redox peaks in the former was probably due to the highly distributed active materials and more reactive sites of α-Co(OH)2 on three-dimensionally structured Ni foam.
In the absence of a hard template, most Co(OH)2 prepared by cathodic deposition exhibit a flake-like or sheet-like morphology due to intrinsic crystallographic preference. Hoshino and co-workers presented a different approach to prepare cobalt compound nanowires (CCNW) by potentiostatic electroreduction from the electrolyte containing the cobalt ammine complex, [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 in a N2 atmosphere.208,209 After the first potential sweep, the CV curve in the potential window of 0–0.55 V showed a redox pair closely similar in peak shapes and positions to the reported CV curve of the mesoporous Co(OH)2 film. Furthermore, TOF-SIMS, XPS, EDX and XRD analyses revealed that the CCNW surface was covered with Co(OH)2 while the CCNW bulk composed of cobalt metal. A maximum specific capacitance of 420 F g−1 was achieved by the CCNW electrode in 0.1 M LiOH.
By using porous anodic alumina (PAA) and lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) as dual-templates, α-Co(OH)2 mesoporous nanowires on PAA/Ti/Si substrates were prepared via cathodic potentiostatic electrodeposition (Fig. 7).210 The composition of the LLC template was similar to that used previously by Li et al.200 The low angle XRD pattern of the as-synthesized α-Co(OH)2 nanowires exhibited a strong reflection peak at 2θ = 1.24°, corresponding to the d100 plane of the P6mm space group with a d-spacing of 71.2 Å and a pore-to-pore distance of 8.2 nm. Interestingly, the templated nanowires still obeyed the rules of layered structure and sheet packing. Under HRTEM, the ordered hexagonal mesopores with cylindrical channels of about 3.6 nm in diameter, a pore-to-pore distance of about 7.9 nm and a pore wall thickness of 4.3 nm were observed. The specific capacitances of the electrode were 993, 922, 873 and 810 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively. Notably, when the current density was increased from 1 to 20 A g−1, the electrode was able to retain 81.5% of the initial specific capacitance.

5. Cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) electrodes211–214
CoOOH is well-known as a highly conductive material with a conductivity of 5 S cm−1 and a highly electroactive material.211–213 Layered hydroxide cobalt acetate (LHCA) nanosheets were first prepared by a CBD procedure, the as-synthesized LHCA films were then converted to CoOOH by alkaline treatment.211 These CoOOH nanoflakes possessed a surface area of about 100 m2 g−1 and a porosity of 65%. At 10 mV s−1, the specific capacitance of the CoOOH electrode was 200 F g−1, which remained at 79.1% and 63.6% when the scan rates increased to 250 and 500 mV s−1, respectively. The excellent rate capability was due to the high conductive nature of CoOOH as well as micro/nanometer scaled morphology. Besides, electrodeposition was also applied to prepare CoOOH nanoflake thin films on stainless steel and a specific capacitance of 449 F g−1 was achieved by the electrode.214 A capacitance loss of 44% was observed after 10000 cycles due to surface contamination or loss of active material from the substrate.
6. Cobalt sulfide (CoxSy) electrodes215–223
The electrochemical capacitance properties of amorphous cobalt sulfide was first reported by Li's group in 2007.215 Based on CV curves of the electrode in neutral and alkaline electrolytes, the mechanism of cobalt sulfide redox processes was proposed to be similar to that of Co(OH)2 in alkaline electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance obtained was 475 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−2 and the capacitance was maintained at 369 F g−1 (77.6%) when the current density was increased to 50 mA cm−2. Different self-assembled CoS nanostructures were synthesized via a L-cysteine assisted hydrothermal route.216 The capacitance of CoS nanowires (508 F g−1 at 2.5 mA cm−2) was higher than that of CoS spheres, possibly due to a looser structure and larger specific surface area. EIS analysis further indicated that CoS nanowires exhibited lower Faradaic reaction and diffusion resistances. While the prepared CoS electrodes215–217 exhibited good high rate capability, the cycling stability was not satisfactory with considerable capacitance loss of 9–23% after small cycling numbers of 100 to 500 cycles. It is clear that further investigations to understand the capacitance loss are required.
Substantial improvement in the cycling life of the cobalt sulfide electrode was achieved by Wang et al.218 In their studies, flower-like CoS1.097 hierarchical structures were synthesized by a solvothermal method. The CoS1.097 nanostructures exhibited a high specific capacitance of 555 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−2 and good rate capability to retain 86% of the specific capacitance (464 F g−1) when the current density was increased to 100 mA cm−2. The capacitance retention after continuous 2500 cycles was about 98%, demonstrating the good electrochemical stability of the electrode.
Further insights into the pseudocapacitive charge-storage mechanism of amorphous CoSx nanoparticles were revealed by Zhang's group.219 The amorphous CoSx nanoparticles (Fig. 8a) were prepared by interfacial reaction of aqueous Co(OOCCH3)2 solution and CS under hydrothermal conditions. The electrochemical capacitive performance of the as-prepared CoSx was poor (Fig. 8c). However, after continuous 240 CV cycles, the capacitance was enhanced significantly with a totally different electrochemical storage mechanism and suggested a new phase formed electrochemically. A significant change in the internal resistance of the electrode was observed before (2.34 Ω) and after (0.78 Ω) CV cycling. At the 240th CV cycle, two pairs of redox peaks were observed in the CV curves. More importantly, the CV shape resembled the reported Co(OH)2 phase in the KOH electrolyte. FTIR analysis demonstrated the existence of Co–O stretching mode, further supporting the Co(OH)2 phase formation during the CV cycles. Interestingly, TEM images showed the transformation of morphology from CoSx nanoparticles (Fig. 8a) to Co(OH)2 nanowhiskers (Fig. 8b). Specific capacitances for Co(OH)2 nanowhiskers of 910 F g−1 and 651 F g−1 could be obtained at current densities of 0.4 A g−1 and 40 A g−1, respectively. Similar electrochemically induced phase transformation of NiS to Ni(OH)2 in alkaline electrolyte was observed by the same group.220 However, it is unclear at the present stage whether this phenomenon can be generalized to other cobalt sulfide electrode materials. This calls for further fundamental studies to examine the electrochemical events of cobalt sulfide electrodes.

Lou's group synthesized microsized CoS2 ellipsoids with tube-like cavities by thermal decomposition and sulfidation of an ellipsoidal cobalt carbonate precursor in a gas flow (10% H2S: 90% N2).221 The original cobalt carbonate ellipsoids showed dense solid texture without pores. After thermal sulfidation, CoS2 ellipsoids presented unique tube-like cavities oriented from the centre to the surface with openings on both ends of the ellipsoids. The growth of the cavities, as postulated by the authors, was due to the different reactivity of H2S gas on different parts of the surface. The specific capacitances of the CoS2 electrode were 1040, 980, 965, 750 and 224 F g−1 at 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. It can be seen that the electrode showed good rate capability to retain 72.1% of the highest capacitance when the current density was increased to 5 A g−1, comparable to other reported CoS electrodes discussed earlier.215–217,219,222 However, the capacitance dropped dramatically when the current density was further increased to 10 A g−1. Similar to most reported CoS electrodes,215–217 the CoS2 electrode also suffered from detrimental cycling stability. After 1000 cycles, only 66 and 44% of the initial specific capacitance can be retained at 5 and 2.5 A g−1.
Electrodeposition is a facile way to prepare CoS nanostructured thin films directly on a current collector. Uniform CoS nanosheets were cathodically electrodeposited on Ni foam. Their specific capacitance was reported to be 1471 F g−1 at 4 A g−1 and they were able to retain 89% of the value when the current density was increased to 40 A g−1.223
7. Cobalt based layered double hydroxides (LDHs)224,225
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) represent a unique class of ionic lamellar compounds, which consist of positively charged layers with a hydrated interlayer region containing charge balancing anions.224,225 A general formula for LDHs is written as [M1−x2+Mx3+(OH)2][An−]x/n·yH2O, where M2+ is a divalent cation e.g. Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+; whereas M3+ is a trivalent cation e.g. Al3+, Fe3+, Mn3+. The identities of M2+ and M3+, the interlayer anions An− (e.g. Cl−, SO42−, CO32−) and the value of the stoichiometric coefficient x (normally 0.2–0.4) can be varied and tailored, providing an enormous class of isostructural materials. A series of Co/Ni–Al LDHs with different ratios of Co to Ni prepared via the co-precipitation method was reported by Zhang and colleagues in 2004.226 It was found that a Ni/Co mole ratio of 4:6 was the optimum composition to yield the highest specific capacitance of 960 F g−1, as compared to 140 F g−1 of Ni–Al LDH. With the incorporation of TiO2 nanotubes as a dispersing agent for the Co/Ni–Al LDH, enhanced electrical properties improved the specific capacitance to 1053 F g−1.227 Afterward, the group extended the co-precipitation scheme in sodium benzoate to obtain benzoate-intercalated Co–Al LDHs and eventually carbon-inserted double oxides.228 The specific capacitances of the three different samples were between 190 and 213 F g−1 with excellent high rate capability.
Subsequently, the same authors investigated the electrochemical capacitive behavior of Co–Al LDH in 1 M LiOH electrolyte.229 A specific capacitance of 322 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 was obtained for Co–Al LDH in 1 M LiOH. It was further found that Co–Al LDH exhibited two independent electrochemical reactions in LiOH, involving the simultaneous intercalation of the lithium cation and the hydroxyl group, which was different from the mechanisms in NaOH and KOH. Nevertheless, the process of Li intercalation/de-intercalation was not stable. The initial capacitance of 268 F g−1 decreased with cycling up to 800 cycles. The capacitance remained stable from 850 to 1000 cycles due to a complete Li ion insertion into the Co–Al LDH and the formation of a new phase.
Zhang et al. also attempted to improve the capacitance performance of Co–Al LDHs by investigating the effect of electrolyte.230 By adding hexacyanoferrate into the KOH electrolyte, the electrochemical redox reactions of Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− took place in the electrode surface layer and in the electrolyte. This resulted in the increase of the whole reaction rate. Besides Co–Al LDHs, Zhang's group prepared Co–In LDHs and Co–Cr LDHs via precipitation or precipitation–hydrothermal methods to investigate the effects of different trivalent cations on the electrochemical properties.231 Basically, the specific capacitances of Co–Al LDHs, Co–In LDHs and Co–Cr-LDHs obtained at 1 A g−1 were 447, 159, 78 F g−1, respectively.
On the other hand, preparation of Co–Al LDHs via a similar co-precipitation method was reported by Duan et al.232 Effects of post-thermal treatment on their microstructures, surface area, crystallinity and electrochemical behavior were investigated. Under an optimum thermal treatment (160 °C), the sample exhibited a high specific capacitance of 684 F g−1. However, the cycling stability is less satisfactory with 20% loss after 1000 cycles. Hu et al. synthesized Co–Ni LDHs by co-precipitation using polyethylene glycol as the structure directing agent.233 A specific capacitance of 1809 F g−1 was the maximum for Co0.41Ni0.59 LDHs, compared to 638 F g−1 and 1399 F g−1 for Co(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2, respectively.
Yang and co-workers fabricated a highly oriented and densely packed Co–Al LDH nanosheet thin film electrode by drying a transparent colloidal Co–Al LDH nanosheet suspension on a pretreated ITO glass plate.234 Electrochemical studies revealed that this electrode presented high specific and volumetric capacitances (667 F g−1 and 2000 F cm−3, respectively). Several structural features such as the open framework and highly exposed surface sites of the nanosheets, and the close contact between the Co–Al LDH nanosheet thin film and the ITO current collector were responsible for the high capacitance, high rate capability and electrochemical stability. Further studies showed that partial isomorphic substitution of Co2+ by Al3+ helped to retain the original layered structure during the redox reaction, favouring the oxidation of Co to a higher oxidation state, as well as shifting of the oxygen evolution potential to a more positive value.235 LDHs with a Co/Al molar ratio of 3:1 presented the largest specific capacitance of 833 F g−1 (2500 F cm−3).
With a co-precipitation method, the Zn–Co LDH with a composition of [Zn0.502+Co0.282+Co0.223+(OH)2][0.22NO3−]·0.55H2O was synthesized.236 The restacked assembly of exfoliated LDH nanosheets was coated on an ITO substrate and used for ECs. The specific capacitance was measured to be in the range of ∼160 to 170 F g−1. The obtained capacitance is considerably lower than those of the other LDHs constituted mainly of Ni and Co, probably due to the presence of less pseudocapacitive Zn2+. With two-step microwave-assisted hydrothermal techniques, a series of Co–Ni LDH nanocones with tuneable Co/Ni content, interlayer distance and aspect ratio were prepared by Liu and co-workers as presented in Fig. 9a–f.237 From the charge–discharge curves, the specific capacitances of Co1−xNix hydroxide nanocones can be approximated to be 490, 1100, 1580, 1400, 740 F g−1 for Co, Co0.75–Ni0.25, Co0.5–Ni0.5, Co0.25–Ni0.75 and Ni hydroxide nanocones, respectively (Fig. 9h). Obviously, bimetallic hydroxides were better than those of monometallic hydroxides.

Alternatively, different LDHs such as Co–Ni LDHs, Co–Al LDHs and Co–Ni–Al LDHs in the form of nanosheets can be prepared.238–242 Studies of various molar ratios of Co/Ni in Co–Ni LDHs demonstrated that Co0.72Ni0.28 LDHs had the highest specific capacitance of 2104 F g−1.238 On the other hand, isomorphic substitution of aluminum into pure Co(OH)2 changed the CV curve dramatically to a rectangular shape even at a low level of 8% substitution.239 Electrodeposited CoNiAl LDHs presented a distinctly different charge–discharge behavior than their CoNi and CoAl LDH counterparts.240 A nearly ideal and symmetric charge–discharge curve was observed, mainly due to the high conductive nature of the electrode. The highest specific capacitance of 1263 F g−1 was obtained for Co0.50Ni0.21Al0.20 LDHs.
Most recently, Leroux's group revisited the monometallic CoIICoIII–CO3 LDH prepared by topochemical oxidative reaction (TOR) of β-Co(OH).243 The chemical composition analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (for the surface) and iodometric titration (for the bulk) revealed that only 1/6 of the CoII sites within the hydroxide layers are oxidized to CoIII using TOR. Based on the quantification of electroactive CoII cations involved in the electro-oxidation process by CV, the obtained values are 28% for the monometallic CoIICoIII–CO3 LDH and only 10% for the bimetallic Co2Al–CO3 LDH. At a current density of 0.5 A g−1, the CoIICoIII–CO3 LDH exhibits a specific capacitance of 1490 F g−1, much higher than 760 F g−1 of the Co2Al–CO3 LDH.
8. Cobalt-based mixed and ternary oxides/sulfides
8.1 Cobalt–nickel oxide and nickel cobaltite electrodes
Nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) has been reported to possess at least two orders of magnitude higher electronic conductivity than nickel oxides and cobalt oxides. This property is particularly important for high rate charge–discharging.

8.1.1 Electrodeposition244–248. 
Co–Ni oxides were deposited on graphite and FTO substrates by anodic potentiostatic electrodeposition.244,245 The specific capacitances of the (CoNi)(OH)2·nH2O were 760, 700, 660 F g−1 at 4, 25, 50 °C respectively. By using an anodic potentiodynamic electrodeposition method, Gupta and colleagues synthesized nanostructured cauliflower-shaped Co–Ni/Co–Ni oxide composites on stainless steel.246 XRD patterns showed the presence of Co, Ni, Co3O4 and NiO. A specific capacitance of 331 F g−1 (areal capacitance of 46 mF cm−2) was obtained for the composite electrode.
Li and colleagues applied the galvanostatic electrolysis method to fabricate Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2.247 Upon heat treatment, mesoporous Co3O4/Ni(OH)2 nanosheet networks (NNs) were formed from the precursor. The presence of Ni was confirmed by EDS, giving a Co/Ni ratio of about 2. The specific capacitance of the Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2 was 823 F g−1. However, the specific capacitance dropped dramatically to 520 F g−1 after 500 cycles. The reason of such degradation was probably due to the transformation of metastable α-Co(OH)2 to β-Co(OH)2. In order to improve the cycling stability, Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2 was thermally treated at 200, 300 and 400 °C (denoted as NiCoO-200, NiCoO-300 and NiCoO-400). At 200 °C, the Co3O4 phase was observed from the XRD pattern. When the annealing temperatures were 300 °C and 400 °C, the XRD patterns could be indexed to NiCo2O4. Among the samples, the NiCoO-200 possessed the highest BET surface area of about 80.3 m2 g−1, compared to the as-synthesized sample (10.8 m2 g−1), NiCoO-300 (59.1 m2 g−1) and NiCoO-400 (37.7 m2 g−1). NiCoO-200 mesoporous NNs displayed a specific capacitance of 684 F g−1, lower than the value of as-synthesized Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2, but higher than those of NiCoO-300 (282 F g−1) and NiCoO-400 (136 F g−1) mesoporous NNs. Moreover, NiCoO-200 managed to solve the cycling instability of the as-synthesized Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2. The specific capacitance of NiCoO-200 was eventually maintained at 93.4% of the maximum value after 500 cycles.


8.1.2 Sol–gel synthesis249–252. 
Hu et al.249 devised an innovative epoxide-driven sol–gel process to prepare nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) aerogels. Structural parameters of the samples derived from N2-adsorption/desorption isotherms are presented in Table 2. Upon post-calcination of the NiCo2O4 aerogels at 200 °C, larger pore volumes and pore size attributed to the removal of physisorbed moisture and solvent were observed. However, when the calcination temperature was increased to 300 °C, a composition change from NiCo2O4 to Co3O4 took place with a significant increase of grain size from 6 to 22.4 nm. In general, post-annealing of NiCo2O4 at 200 °C presented an optimum combination of composition, crystallinity, specific surface area, pore volume and pore size, achieving a specific capacitance of 719 F g−1. A cycling study showed that 500 cycles were needed to fully activate the sample, thus achieving the highest specific capacitance of 1400 F g−1. After 2000 cycles, the specific capacitance was maintained at 91% of the maximum value.

Gong and co-workers prepared a series of Ni–Co oxides with different Ni/Co ratios by a sol–gel method.250 With increasing Co concentrations, the oxide phase changed from the NiO crystal dominant structure to the Co3O4 dominant structure. In the CV curves of three Ni–Co oxides (Ni/Co ratio of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4), the redox peaks were broadened with an increase in Co, and both anodic and cathodic peaks shift to the negative direction. The calculated specific capacitances were 1289, 1410, 1539, 1060 and 361 F g−1 for Ni(OH)2/NiO, Ni–Co oxide (1:1), Ni–Co oxide (1:2), Ni–Co oxide (1:4) and Co3O4, respectively. Comparatively, Ni–Co oxide (1:2) possesses a larger pore width and cumulative pore volume, which allow better ion penetration to react with the active material more easily. Similar to Hu's work,249 Gong observed an increase of capacitance at the initial cycling study (240 cycles). Unfortunately, the capacitance retention after 2000 cycles was only 47% due to peeling off of the active materials from the current collector.
By tuning the experimental parameters of a sol–gel process, Chen et al. prepared NiCo2O4 crystals with distinct morphologies.251 With a fairly high mass loading (5.6 mg cm−2) the specific capacitances of coral-like porous NiCo2O4 crystals, NiCo2O4 nanoparticles and submicron-sized NiCo2O4 were found to be 103, 188 and 217 F g−1, respectively. The submicron-sized NiCo2O4 exhibited excellent rate capability, retaining 92.6 and 86.6% of the highest capacitance when current densities were increased to 10 mA cm−2 and 20 mA cm−2, respectively. A multi-component NiO/NiCo2O4/Co3O4 synergistic composite with a high specific surface and mesoporous structure was fabricated by a sol−gel process.252 The composite exhibits a high specific capacitance (1717 F g−1), enhanced rate capability and excellent cycling stability.


8.1.3 Chemical precipitation253–259. 
Ni–Co oxide was also prepared via co-precipitation using Ni–Co carbonate as the precursor.253 The specific capacitances of Ni–Co oxide (molar ratio 1:1) calcined at 300, 350, 400, and 450 °C were ∼272, ∼287, ∼180 and ∼124 F g−1, respectively. A lower capacitance for the product calcined at 300 °C as compared to that calcined to 350 °C could be attributed to the incomplete decomposition of the precursor. Meanwhile, when the calcination temperature was increased to 400 °C, the nanowire morphology changed to a nanocolumn, leading to a decrease in specific surface area. The Ni–Co oxide (1:1) presented a larger capacitance than those of pure NiO and Co3O4 electrodes. According to EIS analysis, the Ni–Co oxide (1:1) had the smallest charge transfer resistance and internal resistance among other electrodes with Ni:Co ratios of 9:1, 7:3, 3:7 and 1:9.
Co0.56Ni0.44 oxide nanoflakes, NiCo2O4 spinel oxide nanostructures, Ni0.37Co0.63(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2–Co(OH)2 composites were synthesized by chemical precipitation.254–257 The BET specific surface area of the Co0.56Ni0.44 oxide nanoflakes was 110 m2 g−1, while the pore size distribution was 2–7 nm with an average pore diameter of 5.9 nm.254 The specific capacitance of the Co0.56Ni0.44 oxide nanoflakes was 1227 F g−1. A comparative study of different samples showed that the optimum product possessed a lower specific surface area and less pore volume, yet demonstrated the highest capacitance. Such improvement was attributed to the much higher electronic conductivity of the optimum sample.235 Ni(OH)2–Co(OH)2 (2193 F g−1) not only exhibited a higher maximum specific capacitance than Ni(OH)2 (1914 F g−1), but also better rate capability, retaining 63.3% of its highest specific capacitance when the current density was increased ten times, as compared to 45.7% for Ni(OH)2.257
Hierarchical NiCo2O4 porous nanowires (constructed by nanoparticle aggregates) and ultralayered mesoporous nanowires (constructed by nanosheets) were obtained.258,259 The specific surface area of the porous nanowires was 202.2 m2 g−1 after annealing at 250 °C and decreased significantly to 62.1 m2 g−1 at a calcination temperature of 400 °C.255 The BJH pore size distribution curve of the sample annealed at 250 °C was found to show a sharp peak at ∼2.4 nm and a wide peak at ∼34.0 nm. The pore volume of the sample was ∼1.14 cm3 g−1. The maximum specific capacitance of the electrode was 743 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and this was retained at 78.6% (584 F g−1) when the current density was increased to 40 A g−1.255


8.1.4 Hydro/solvothermal synthesis260–268. 
Exploiting the hydrothermal method, NiCo2O4 nanowires self-assembling into microspheres were successfully prepared.260 After annealing of the precursor, distinct mesopores on the nanowire surface were observed in the TEM images and were further confirmed by Type IV N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. The BET specific surface areas of Ni–Co–O-1 (NiCo2O4 with the starting Ni/Co molar ratio of 1:1) and Ni–Co–O-2 (starting Ni/Co molar ratio of 2:1) were 84.7 and 99.6 m2 g−1 respectively. The average mesopore sizes in Ni–Co–O-1 and Ni–Co–O-2 were 13.0 and 11.1 nm. The calculated specific capacitances at 1 A g−1 for Ni–Co–O-1 and Ni–Co–O-2 were 722 and 760 F g−1, respectively. When the current density was increased to 20 A g−1, the capacitances of Ni–Co–O-1 and Ni–Co–O-2 were retained at 79% and 70%, revealing the remarkable rate capability of the NiCo2O4 nanowires. After 3000 cycles, the capacitances of Ni–Co–O-1 and Ni–Co–O-2 were retained at 80% and 81% respectively.
Xiao and Yang261 reported a detailed account on kinetic control and mechanistic studies of the formation of sea-urchin like Ni–Co carbonate hydroxide by the hydrothermal process and its thermal conversion to porous NiCo2O4 spinel for pseudocapacitors. Upon calcination at 300 °C for 3 h, the metallic carbonate hydroxides were decomposed to desired products of Co3O4, NiO and NiCo2O4 phases (Fig. 10d and e), and nearly preserving the original morphologies (Fig. 10a–c). As expected, the smooth surfaces of carbonate hydroxides became rough and porous after thermal decomposition, due to the escape of small gas molecules. Basically, all the adsorption isotherms could be categorized as Type IV. The hysteresis loop of the Co3O4 samples could be categorized as Type H1, associated with a narrow pore size distribution (average pore diameter: 16.5 nm). Meanwhile, NiCo2O4 samples exhibited smaller mean pore size (average pore diameter: 5 nm). The hysteresis loop of the NiO samples is attributable to Type H3, featuring slit-shaped pores. The BET specific surface areas of Co3O4, NiCo2O4, and NiO were 31.3, 198.9, 186.4 m2 g−1, respectively. Fig. 11a presents CV curves of the samples. Comparatively, the CV curve of the NiCo2O4 electrode exhibits an obviously larger CV integral area, as well as a wider separated pair of redox couples than Co3O4 and NiO electrodes. Based on galvanostatic charge–discharge curves, the specific capacitances for NiCo2O4, Co3O4 and NiO electrodes were 658, 60, 194 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. When the current density was increased to 10 A g−1, the specific capacitances for NiCo2O4, Co3O4 and NiO electrodes remained at 80.5% (530 F g−1), 51.7% (31 F g−1) and 78.4% (152 F g−1), respectively. In addition to higher specific capacitance due to the richer redox reactions, the NiCo2O4 electrode is superior in terms of high rate capability, mainly contributed by the much higher electrical conductivity as shown by a lower charge transfer resistance (Fig. 11c).

When the hydrothermally synthesized Ni0.5Co1.5(OH)2CO3 nanowire arrays (NWAs) were immersed in 6 M NaOH for 6 to 18 h, small and thin nanoplatelets were formed on the surface of the NWAs. The hierarchical nanowire@nanoplatelet arrays (NWPAs) showed both high areal capacitance and specific capacitance (9.59 F cm−2 or 928.4 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−2), at least 7 times larger than those of the pristine NWAs. In addition, the NWPAs exhibited good rate capability, retaining 81% of the highest capacitance at a high current density of 50 mA cm−2.262
Su and co-workers investigated the electrochemical performances of Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2 composites specifically in LiOH solution,263 extending their previous attempt on the use of LiOH electrolyte for the Co–Al LDH.229 The Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2 were physically mixed to form a composite electrode.264 Compared to the pure Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2 electrodes, the Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2 composite with a weight ratio of 3:2 lowered the IR drops of galvanostatic discharge curves by reducing the charge transfer resistance of the electrode. For the Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2 composite, the weight ratio of 3:2 was the optimum mixture that exhibited a specific capacitance in between the two pure phase electrodes. Importantly, the pure Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2 electrodes suffered from poor cycling stability. In contrast, all composite electrodes experienced improvement in cycling stability.


8.1.5 Chemical bath deposition269–272. 
Ahn's group synthesized NiCo2O4 nanorods and nanoflakes directly on ITO and stainless steel substrates by chemical bath deposition followed by calcination at 300 °C.269,270 Comparatively, the BET surface area of the NiCo2O4 nanorods and nanoflakes was 196 and 35 m2 g−1, respectively. As expected from the higher surface area and porosity, NiCo2O4 nanorods (490 F g−1) exhibited a higher specific capacitance than NiCo2O4 nanoflakes (330 F g−1).


8.1.6 Successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR)273. 
Co–Ni mixed hydroxide films were deposited on stainless steel via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR).273 The thickness of the film was controlled by tuning the concentration of cationic solution and deposition cycles.
The Co–Ni hydroxide film was constructed by a dense layer of interconnected and agglomerated nanoparticles. On the other hand, cobalt hydroxide and nickel hydroxide films prepared from a single cationic solution consisted of smooth grains and spongy nanoflakes, respectively. The hydrophilicity of the Co, Ni and Co–Ni hydroxide films was evaluated by the water contact angle and found to be 47°, 32° and 19° respectively. Hydrophilicity is useful for the electrode surface to make intimate contact with the aqueous electrolyte. The specific capacitances of the Co, Ni and Co–Ni hydroxide films were 354, 425 and 672 F g−1, respectively. The specific capacitance of the Co–Ni hydroxide film was maintained at 57.6% (387 F g−1) when the scan rate was increased from 5 to 100 mV s−1. Nevertheless, all three films experienced considerable capacitance loss upon continuous 1000 cycles due to the loss of active materials, probably caused by dissolution and detachment during the early cycles.

8.2 Cobalt–nickel sulfide electrodes274–281
Based on the success of nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4), Chen et al. explored the use of nickel cobalt sulphide (NiCo2S4) in the application of ECs.274 Interestingly, they found that NiCo2S4 shows a much lower optical band gap energy and a much higher conductivity compared to NiCo2O4. NiCo2S4 urchin-like structures were converted from Ni–Co carbonate hydroxide by reacting with Na2S under hydrothermal conditions. The electrode presented a high specific capacitance of 1149 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, as well as an impressive rate capability to retain 77% of the capacitance at 20 A g−1, and 66% of the capacitance at 50 A g−1.
8.3 Zinc cobaltite electrodes282,283
The co-precipitated submicron crystalline ZnCo2O4 particles were mixed with carbon nanofoam and then pasted onto a stainless steel current collector.282 A symmetric cell was fabricated by sandwiching the electrodes between a polypropylene separator using 6 M KOH as electrolyte. Based on the two-electrode study, a specific capacitance of 77 F g−1 was obtained for the composite electrode.
Zinc cobaltite aerogels can also be synthesized through the epoxide-driven sol–gel method.283 The ZnCo2O4 samples were prepared in a stoichiometric (1:2) and a non-stoichiometric (1:1) molar ratio. Different gelation agents were used in the synthesis. The SEM images in Fig. 12 show that the choice of the epoxide [propylene oxide (P), glycidol (G) or n-butyl glycidyl ether (B)] and solvent [ethanol (E) or 2-propanol (P)] used could affect the morphologies. Table 3 depicts the surface and porosity properties, as well as specific capacitances of as-synthesized ZnCo2O4 aerogels and their annealed products. Based on the CV curves of the as-prepared and annealed PE (propylene oxide as epoxide and ethanol as solvent) samples, the electrical double layer capacitance was more dominant for the as-prepared than the annealed PE sample. Conversely, the annealed PE sample exhibited more pronounced pseudocapacitance correlated with a sharper redox peak. The specific capacitance of the annealed PE sample was 700 F g−1. The relatively higher capacitance than other samples may be attributed to structurally interconnected porous morphology and high specific area. Notably, similar to some other materials prepared by the sol–gel method, the annealed ZnCo2O4 underwent activation and increased capacitance in early cycles, and finally retained 95% of the specific capacitance after 3000 cycles (Fig. 13).

8.4 Other cobalt-related mixed oxides284,285
Ternary Mn–Ni–Co oxide (MNCO) composites were synthesized by co-precipitation of Mn, Ni and Co salts, followed by thermal decomposition.284 The composites were composed of Mn3O4, NiO and Co3O4. The morphology of the as-synthesized materials consisted of microparticles making up of networks of solid rods. These nanostructures increased the solid–electrolyte interfacial area, as well as provided an easier transport path for percolation of the electrolyte through the solid. CV curves of the MNCO and NCO (Ni–Co oxide) electrodes appeared similar, showing that manganese oxide did not participate in the redox process directly. However, the redox current of the MNCO electrode is higher than that of the NCO electrode, probably due to the ability of manganese oxide to store electrical charge by simultaneous injection of electrons and charge-compensating cations into the solid. According to EIS analysis, despite having a slightly higher internal resistance, the MNCO electrode has a smaller electrochemical reaction resistance and a larger capacitance than those of the NCO electrode. The specific capacitance of the MNCO composite was 1080 F g−1, about 270 F g−1 higher than that of the NCO electrode.
9. Other cobalt compounds
9.1 Co-based metal organic frameworks (Co-MOF)286
Zhang's group first utilized a Co-MOF as an intermediate to obtain Co3O4 superstructures for ECs.286 Later it was revealed by Lee et al. that a Co-MOF can be utilized directly as an electrode material for ECs.287 The Co-MOF film doctor-bladed onto the ITO substrate consisted of a mesoporous structure formed by MOF nanoparticles of 50–100 nm. Among various electrolytes i.e. LiOH, KOH, LiCl and KCl, LiOH was found to be the most suitable electrolyte for the Co-MOF film. The Co-MOF film demonstrated a specific capacitance of ∼207 F g−1 at 0.6 A g−1. In addition, the cycling stability of the electrode was evaluated for 1000 cycles. The organic–inorganic framework was highly stable in LiOH, LiCl and KCl, but the framework was destroyed in KOH due to its strong alkaline condition. After 1000 cycles in LiOH, the MOF was transformed into a fine crystalline structure. The change of morphology was probably due to the continuous deformation–formation associated with rearrangement of the MOF crystal structure during cycling. The MOF film retained 98.5% of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles, showing an excellent cycling stability.
9.2 Cobalt carbonate hydroxide288
Instead of using Co–Al LDHs as electrode materials, Sun and co-workers attempted to convert Co–Al LDH nanosheets to mesoporous cobalt carbonate hydroxide (MPCCH) nanosheets for ECs.288 The Co–Al LDH film was pink in color and constructed with nanosheets of 0.5–1 μm in length and 50–80 nm in thickness. After immersion in 5 M NaOH solution, the film color turned to dark red. The original three-dimensional nanosheet network was preserved, but the individual nanosheet became thinner with a thickness of about 10 nm after the alkaline treatment. In addition, small pores of several to tens of nanometers were observed in the alkaline treated cracked nanosheets. Combined analysis by EDS, SEM and TEM demonstrated that etching in the 5 M NaOH led to the dissolution of Al from the Co–Al LDH creating holes and cracks in the nanosheets.
Overall, alkaline treatment thinned the nanosheets, created porosity and increased the surface area, leading to better penetration of electrolytes into the electrodes and shortened the diffusion distance. The specific capacitance of MPCCH at 5 mA cm−2 was 1075 F g−1, much higher than that of Co–Al LDH (∼390 F g−1). Furthermore, at a very high current density of 50 mA cm−2, MPCCH retained 72.4% of its highest capacitance, whereas the Co–Al LDH only retained 56.8% of its highest capacitance.
9.3 Cobalt phosphate/phosphite289,290
Pang and co-workers synthesized various cobalt phosphate289 and phosphite289,290 nano/microarchitectures as electrodes for ECs. Through chemical precipitation under different formulations, NH4CoPO4·H2O with different morphologies (oblong plates, microplates, microflowers, hierarchical architectures) were obtained.289 Under hydrothermal conditions, a mixture of cobalt chloride and sodium pyrophosphate yielded cobalt phosphite (Co11(HPO3)8(OH)6) microarchitectures assembled with 20–30 μm long nanoribbons.289,290 The specific capacitance of the phosphate electrodes was higher than that of the phosphite electrode. The specific capacitance was varied from 366 to 1143 F g−1 depending on the morphologies, which may in turn control the surface–interface properties and thus the ion movement and electrolyte accessibility.
10. Cobalt compound related hetero-nanostructures82,291–308
Recently, rational synthesis of complex heterostructures becomes an important research trend to seek a breakthrough in electrochemical performance. Basically, there are two approaches in constructing hetero-nanostructures made of two or more nano-components. In the first approach, the first nano-component acts as a nanostructured current collector to allow the deposition of the second electroactive nano-component.291–296 This approach enhances the connection and contact between electroactive materials and the nanostructured current collector; maximizes the utilization of electrode materials on the high surface area current collector; provides efficient pathways for rapid charge transport and eliminates the use of ancillary binders and conducting additives. In the second approach, both components are electroactive materials to be integrated into three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures. 3D hierarchical nanostructures exhibit high specific surface area, high permeability and more surface active sites as electrode materials in ECs.82,297–305
Fan and co-workers published a series of reports on the construction of heteronanostructures for the electrochemical energy storage system by using both approaches mentioned earlier. For the first approach, they prepared an ultrathin Ni(OH)2 nanoflake–ZnO nanowire hybrid array, which demonstrated high specific capacitance, excellent cycling stability and more importantly, high rate capability.291 Among the various hybrid nanostructures, Co3O4 nanowire@ MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets,297 CoO nanowire@ Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes,298 Co3O4 nanowire@ NiO nanoflakes299 hybrid systems (Fig. 14), Co3O4 nanowire@ porous Co(OH)2 nanosheets,300 which modelled after the second approach, were exquisitely fabricated.

For the pristine Co3O4 nanowire array in LiOH electrolyte, redox peaks that correspond to the reversible reaction of Co3+/Co4+ could be clearly seen. For the Co3O4 nanowire@ MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets,297 the hybrid material exhibited a CV with an expanded integral area and became approximately rectangular. The change of the CV shape due to the presence of MnO2 suggested additional pseudocapacitance provided by MnO2. The hybrid did not exhibit a fast potential drop from 0.3 V in the discharge curve, in line with the integral area in the CV curve. The discharge areal capacitance of the hybrid was 0.56 F cm−2 at 11.25 mA cm−2, which is four times higher than the capacitance of the pristine Co3O4 nanowire array (0.135 F cm−2). When the current density was increased from 4 to 44.7 mA cm−2, the areal capacitance was maintained at 56%, which is 10 times higher than the specific capacitance of the pristine Co3O4 nanowire array. Comparatively, after 5000 cycles, the capacitance loss for Co3O4 nanowire@ MnO2 nanosheets was 2.7%, while the capacitance loss for the pristine Co3O4 nanowire array was 17.4%. The excellent electrochemical performance was attributed to the synergistic contribution from the ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets, the porous single crystalline Co3O4 nanowires and the ordered hierarchical configuration. In addition, the Co3O4 nanowire array was grown directly on stainless steel, ensuring good mechanical adhesion and electrical connection, avoiding the use of polymer binders and conductive additives that add additional contact resistance and dead mass/volume.
Fan's group prepared porous CoO nanowalls composed of small nanobricks tightly interconnected with ordered porosity of around or below 100 nm on nickel foam (Fig. 15a–d).301 The quasi-aligned CoO nanowalls (mass loading: 4.3 mg cm−2) exhibited a specific capacitance of 540 F g−1 and a remarkably high areal capacitance of 2.3 F cm−2. The CoO electrode displayed excellent cycling stability and was able to retain 95% of the capacitance after 5000 cycles. In order to further boost up the areal capacitance, the CoO porous nanowalls can be further electrodeposited with Ni(OH)2 nanolayers (Fig. 15e–g).301 The deposited Ni(OH)2 nanolayers were selected based on several criteria: to provide additional specific capacitance, to enlarge the surface area but not to block the electroactive CoO surface and to maintain the structural integrity. The optimized CoO@Ni(OH)2 hybrid electrode (∼4.84 mg) presented an extraordinary areal capacitance of 11.49 F cm−2, about three times higher than the simple addition of separate CoO (2.3 F cm−2) and Ni(OH) (1 F cm−2) components.

Extending their previous attempt of fabricating Co3O4 nanosheet @ Co3O4 nanowire arrays (NSWA) on Ni foam165 (discussed in Section 3.2.1), Sun and co-workers synthesized hierarchical Co3O4 nanosheet @ Ni–Co oxide nanorod arrays with a high mass loading of 12 mg on Ni foam.82 Significantly, the hierarchical electrode presented an impressive areal capacitance (specific capacitances) of 24.95 F cm−2 (2098 F g−1) at 5 mA cm−2 which remained at ∼73% when the current density was increased to 30 mA cm−2. In addition, the electrode was stable upon continuous cycling and remained at 96% after 1000 cycles. The electrochemical performance of this hybrid electrode was attributed to the uniform and thin (∼10 nm in diameter) Ni–Co oxide nanorods that were accessible to the electrolyte, ensuring high utilization efficiency. Concurrently, the hybrid structure was tightly bound to the Ni foam to facilitate electron transport especially at high rates.
Lee et al. fabricated binderless ITO nanowire@Co(OH)2 nanoflake heterostructures directly grown on the stainless steel substrate.292 The specific capacitances of ITO nanowire@ Co(OH)2 nanoflake and Co(OH)2 nanoflake on stainless steel substrates were 622 and 585 F g−1 respectively. When the scan rate was increased to 100 mV s−1, the capacitance retentions for ITO nanowire@Co(OH)2 nanoflake and Co(OH)2 nanoflake were 72.3 and 33.3% respectively, clearly revealing the improved high rate capability of the former sample. The improved high rate capability of the heterostructured electrode was mainly attributed to the hierarchical geometry. In the electrode, each Co(OH)2 nanoflake was directly connected to the ITO nanowire, which serves as a facile electron path for charge transport, allowing efficient electron conduction during charge–discharge processes.
Mai et al. synthesized MnMoO4 nanowire@ CoMoO4 nanowire heterostructures by a combination of micro-emulsion and refluxing methods.302 Their samples were prepared in powder form, and high weight % of conductive carbon (35.5%) and binder (4.5%) was required to fabricate the working electrode. The hierarchical MnMoO4/CoMoO4 heterostructures exhibited a specific capacitance of ∼187 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is higher than that of pure MnMoO4 (∼10 F g−1), CoMoO4 (∼63 F g−1), and the MnMoO4/CoMoO4 composite (∼69 F g−1). The differences in the capacitance of these different samples are partially related to their differences in specific surface areas. The BET surface area of MnMoO4, the MnMoO4/CoMoO4 composite and hierarchical MnMoO4/CoMoO4 was 3.17, 28.0, 54.06 m2 g−1, respectively. Furthermore, self-aggregation within the hierarchical MnMoO4/CoMoO4 heterostructures was greatly reduced to retain the effective contact between the active materials and the electrolyte. Besides, the highly dense CoMoO4 nanorods grown on the MnMoO4 nanowires possessed low crystallinity, providing more surface sites for redox reaction and enabling OH− access to the heterostructures.
The hierarchical MnMoO4/CoMoO4 heterostructures exhibited good cycling stability and retained 98% capacitance after 1000 cycles. In comparison to other heterostructures,292,297–299 MnMoO4/CoMoO4 heterostructures exhibited lower capacitance and poorer rate capability. However, the effective potential window (1 V) of this sample is noticeably larger than those of all other heterostructures.
In addition to heterostructures based on all inorganic components, conducting polymers have also been utilized to fabricate heterostructures with cobalt compounds.306–308 After growing CoO nanowire arrays on Ni foam, polypyrrole (PPy) was grown on the nanowire surface as a nanosized thin layer or in the form of nanoparticulates.307 PPy provided benefits such as high electrical conductivity (10−100 S cm−1 compared to 10−2 S cm−1 of CoO) to improve electron transport, as well as the pseudocapacitance of PPy itself. The optimized integrated electrode (CoO@PPy) exhibited both high specific capacitance (2223 F g−1) and areal capacitances (4.43 F cm−2); nearly four times higher than those of the pristine CoO nanowire electrode. On the other hand, Han et al. prepared the Co–Al-LDH nanoplatelet array (NPA) on Ni foil by the hydrothermal method, followed by electrodeposition of a thin layer of conductive PEDOT polymer onto the surface of the as-prepared LDH NPA.306 A maximum specific capacitance of 672 F g−1 was achieved, along with a good long-term cycling stability retaining 92.5% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles.
11. Cobalt compound–carbon nanomaterial composites
Although pseudocapacitive metal oxides/hydroxides generally exhibit higher specific capacitance as compared to the EDLC of carbon materials, metal oxides/hydroxides undergo physical changes during the repetitious charge–discharge cycles, and thus often have poorer durability. Meanwhile, the low conductivity of semiconducting metal oxides/hydroxides severely retards their charge storage capacity especially at high rates. Consequently, rational incorporation of carbon nanomaterials into metal oxide/hydroxide becomes an important strategy to prepare synergistic composite materials for high performance ECs.309
11.1 Composites of cobalt compounds–one dimensional carbon nanomaterials310–325
One-dimensional (1D) carbon nanomaterials are a distinct class of nanostructured carbons well known for their high electrical conductivity, high mechanical strength, high chemical stability and high surface area. Examples of 1D carbon nanomaterials are carbon nanofibers, single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Cobalt compounds can be coupled with 1D carbon nanomaterials by diverse routes, including electrodeposition, in situ precipitation/thermolysis/thermal decomposition, solid state reaction and so on.
Nickel and cobalt mixed oxides (Ni/Co)Ox were electrochemically deposited onto CNT film coated-Ni mesh as well as pristine Ni mesh.310 The CNT film could provide a large surface and interfacial area between (Ni/Co)Ox and the electrolyte solution, keeping the smaller particles from merging together after continuous 1000 cycles. The specific capacitances of (Ni/Co)Ox on Ni mesh and on CNTs–Ni mesh (Ni/Co ratio = 4:6) were 475 F g−1 and 840 F g−1, respectively. In addition, the presence of the CNT film increased the cycling stability to over 1000 cycles.
Nitric acid-treated MWCNTs were used as conductive additives in the preparation of a composite electrode based on co-precipitated Co–Al LDH hexagonal nanosheets.311 When 10 wt% treated MWCNTs were added, the specific capacitance of the electrode increased remarkably from 192 to 342 F g−1. The use of MWCNTs improved the diffusion coefficient and the conductivity of the electrode. EIS spectra demonstrated that the inner resistance and contact resistance between particles in the 10% MWCNTs–LDH composite electrode were smaller than those of the pure Co–Al-LDH. It was speculated that when mixed with LDH, the high surface area and entangled MWCNTs can set up a conductive network to facilitate facile charge-transfer and mass-transfer processes.
On the other hand, (Ni/Co)Ox were grown on a CVD-grown CNT film–graphite electrode.312 Comparative studies showed that (Ni/Co)Ox–CNTs (Ni/Co molar ratio = 1:1) had the best reversibility and capacitance. The specific capacitance of (Ni/Co)Ox–CNTs was 569 F g−1, about 3 times higher than (Ni/Co)Ox without CNTs (193 F g−1). Notably, the (Ni/Co)Ox–CNTs exhibited excellent high rate capability to retain 95.4% of the specific capacitance when the current density was increased 10 times to 100 mA cm−2.
A stepwise strategy involving the electrostatic assembly of well dispersed MWCNTs on ITO glass followed by electrodeposition of cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanoflakes was presented.313 The specific capacitance of the ITO/MWCNT/CoOOH electrode (389 F g−1) was markedly higher than that of the ITO/CoOOH electrode (209 F g−1). This capacitance enhancement clearly showed the role of MWCNTs in providing a unique porous structure and higher surface area to host the electrodeposited CoOOH nanoflakes. Improvement in the transport of electrolyte ions also facilitated the utilization of the electroactive CoOOH. Furthermore, this work demonstrated a few other unique merits: the use of neutral electrolyte (Na2SO4), a widened potential window (0.1 to 0.9 V) and tuneable MWCNT/CoOOH pairs.
NiCo2O4–SWCNTs, Ni–Co hydroxide composites, NiCoAl LDH nanosheets–MWCNTs were prepared by precipitation in the presence of CNTs.314–316 Slower hydrolysis was observed in water–ethanol (ratio 1:4) and optimum for uniform coating of NiCo2O4 nanocrystals onto SWCNT walls. The optimized electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1642 F g−1 (∼4.9 F cm−2) at 0.5 A g−1. When the current density was increased to 20 A g−1, 53.5% of the highest specific capacitance can be retained, displaying a good rate capability. The nanocomposite electrode exhibited good cycling stability, i.e. 94.1% of the initial capacitance was maintained after 2000 cycles. According to EIS analysis, the NiCo2O4–SWCNTs composite showed lower internal resistance and charge transfer resistance than those of the pure NiCo2O4 sample.
Ko and Yoon synthesized (Ni/Co)Ox–carbon fibers on Ni foam by thermal decomposition of metal salt solutions in the presence of carbon fibers.317 The specific capacitances of the (Ni/Co)Ox–carbon fiber composite and (Ni/Co)Ox were 1271 and 936 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, and 955 and 612 F g−1 when the scan rate was increased to 100 mV s−1. The mass loading of the (Ni/Co)Ox–carbon fiber composite can be increased from 0.81 to 3.26 mg cm−2 without reducing considerably the specific capacitance, while providing a high areal capacitance of ∼4 F cm−2. The same research group extended a similar synthesis scheme to prepare the CoMnO2–carbon fiber composite.83 The composite electrodes exhibited a specific capacitance of 630 F g−1, higher than that of CoMnO2 alone (419 F g−1) and excellent capacitance retention of 95% after 10000 cycles.
Mullen and Feng's group synthesized Co3O4-incorporated 1D nanoporous carbons (NPCs) via an organometallic precursor-controlled thermolysis approach.318 After thermolysis, AAO template removal and further heat treatment, the polyphenylene skeletons were transformed to 1D NPCs with homogenous dispersion of Co3O4 hollow nanocrystals. The specific capacitance of NPCs/Co3O4 was 382 F g−1 at 3 A g−1, higher than that of conventional MWCNT-supported Co3O4 (126 F g−1). At current densities of 30 and 60 A g−1, 81% and 72.8% of the capacitance were retained respectively, showing a remarkable rate capability. Corrected specific capacitances contributed by Co3O4 nanocrystals were 1066, 1028, 951, 879 and 721 F g−1 at 3, 6, 12, 30, 60 A g−1 respectively. After 4500 cycles, 89% of the initial capacitance of the NPCs/Co3O4 was maintained.
A carbon nanofiber (CNF) paper was made by thermal treatment of electrospun polyacrylonitrile fibrous paper, followed by chemical precipitation of Co(OH)2.319 Interestingly, mutually enhanced capacitances in the composite were observed: the composite paper exhibited a higher specific capacitance in the potential range of −1 to 0 V, about 24% higher than that of the pure CNF paper; while the specific capacitance of the composite paper in the potential range of −0.2 to 0.35 V was about 30% higher than that of Co(OH)2 alone. Yan and co-workers reported another study on Co3O4/CNT composites by precipitating Co3O4 onto acid-pretreated CNTs.320 The calculated specific capacitances for pure MWCNTs, Co3O4 and composites with different weight percentages of MWCNTs are presented in Table 4, along with the results of surface area and porosity. Obviously, the addition of MWCNTs significantly improved the specific capacitance of Co3O4. This improvement was achieved due to the high specific surface area and the suitable pore size distribution in favour of the adsorption and transport of electrolyte ions through the porous channels within the composite electrode. Besides, EIS analysis showed that the incorporation of MWCNTs decreased the internal resistance and charge transfer resistance of Co3O4, hence improving the overall electrical conductivity of Co3O4. Finally, the capacitance retention after 2000 cycles was determined to be 91%.

CNT–CoS composites were also prepared by several authors.321,322 Modifying a previously developed interface hydrothermal method219 by incorporating poly(sodium-4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS)-functionalized MWCNTs (FMWCNTs), Zhang and co-workers prepared amorphous CoSx nanoparticles highly dispersed on the FMWCNTs.321 PSS with negative charges could covalently functionalize MWCNTs and increase their solubility in aqueous solution. The FMWCNT surface then tethered metal ions with positive charge and resulted in the homogeneous deposition of metal sulfide nanoparticles. The use of FMWCNTs efficiently restrained the aggregation of CoSx nanoparticles and enhanced the homogeneous dispersion, thus the deposited CoSx nanoparticles had a larger exposed surface area and higher surface energy. Furthermore, the three-dimensionally entangled FWCNTs remitted the inter-particle electron hopping resistance during the redox transition and thus enhanced the electronic conductivity of the composite. A specific capacitance of 334 F g−1 was obtained for the nanocomposite at 0.4 A g−1. 89.8% (300 F g−1) of the specific capacitance was maintained when the current density was increased to 3 A g−1, displaying an excellent rate capability and surpassing all the CoSx-based electrodes. The capacitance retention was about 95% after 1000 cycles.
Xu et al.323 synthesized CoMoO4 nanoplatelets anchored on acid functionalized (AF)-MWCNTs via a solvent-free solid state reaction. The ground mixture was heated in the microwave. The BET surface area of the CoMoO4/MWCNT composite was 58.1 m2 g−1, in which the composite was found to contain ∼24.8% AF-MWCNTs (BET surface area: 110 m2 g−1) and ∼75.2% of CoMoO4 (BET surface area: 41.2 m2 g−1). The randomly oriented CoMoO4 nanoplatelets possessed an interesting crystalline–amorphous core–shell structure. In contrast to most cobalt-based compounds and composites, the CoMoO4/MWCNT electrode exhibited pseudocapacitance in a larger potential window of −0.55 to 0.25 V (Hg/HgO). The electrode produced specific capacitances of 170, 115 and 96 F g−1 at 0.1, 0.5 and 1 A g−1, respectively.
11.2 Composites of cobalt compounds–two dimensional carbon nanomaterials
Graphene is strictly a two-dimensional (2D) single-atom-thick planar sheet of sp2 bonded carbon atoms.65 However, a loose meaning of “graphene” is usually used to describe a variety of graphene-related materials, covering a broad spectrum of structural and chemical derivatives of graphene.64,65,67–70 Chemically derived graphene, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), offer advantage in terms of chemical processability to form various composites with cobalt compounds.
By using Na2S as a precursor of the depositing agent (OH−) and the reducing agent (HS− and H2S), graphene–Co(OH)2 composites were prepared via simultaneous reduction of GO to rGO and deposition of Co(OH)2.326 The specific capacitances of Co(OH)2, rGO and the Co(OH)2–rGO composite were ∼726, ∼138 and ∼973 F g−1. Fan et al. prepared the Co3O4–rGO composite by microwave-assisted synthesis followed by calcination in air.327 The highest specific capacitances of the Co3O4–rGO composite and rGO were ∼243 and ∼169 F g−1, respectively. After 2000 cycles, the capacitance decreased by 4.4% of the initial capacitance.
Co3O4,328,329 Co(OH)2,330 CoxSy,331,332 NiCo2O4,333 Co0.5Ni0.5(OH)2,334 NiCo2S4,335 Ni(OH)2/CoO composite336 nanostructures bound on rGO were fabricated via different procedures. The as-prepared Co3O4–rGO composite delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 478 F g−1, while nanosized (<50 nM) commercial Co3O4 powders and rGO sheets produced maximum specific capacitances of 118 F g−1 and 245 F g−1, respectively. In the composite, the presence of Co3O4 prevents the rGO sheets from aggregation and restacking, increasing the surface area accessible to the electrolyte. Specifically, Wang's study revealed that the BET surface area of bare rGO sheets is 93.7 m2 g−1. In the presence of Co3O4 nanoparticles as spacers, the BET surface area of the Co3O4–rGO was extended to 219.2 m2 g−1. On the other hand, the restricted particle sizes of Co3O4 formed on the graphene domain would lead to an increase of its pseudocapacitance.
Yu et al. synthesized Co3O4 nanoscrolls–rGO via a two-step chemical precipitation and thermal annealing process.337 Although the pure Co3O4 nanoscrolls presented a very low specific capacitance of ∼15 F g−1 as compared to most reported literature, the incorporation of rGO managed to elevate the specific capacitance to ∼160 F g−1. Similarly, the Co3O4–rGO composite prepared by Hu and colleagues exhibited a higher specific capacitance (291 F g−1) than the individual counterparts of rGO (56 F g−1) and Co3O4 (161 F g−1).338
While all the above examples326,327,337–339 involve the conventional chemical synthesis process, Konstantinov and colleagues presented a unique alternative route.340 In their preparation scheme, a commercial powder of Co(OH)2 was dissolved in nitric acid, then added and homogenized into a diluted GO dispersion in water. The 20% rGO–Co3O4 composite was obtained by spray pyrolyzing the suspension into a vertical type spray pyrolysis reactor at 500–1000 °C. SEM and TEM images of the rGO–Co3O4 composite obtained are shown in Fig. 16a–c, illustrating the globular structure. Co3O4 nanoparticles are wrapped within bended rGO sheets, forming an interconnected 3D network structure. Specific capacitances of the rGO–Co3O4 composite were measured from CV to be 687 and 580 F g−1 at 5 and 100 mV s−1 respectively, demonstrating a high specific capacitance and good rate capability. After 1000 continuous CV cycles, the specific capacitance decreased by 6.9%.

In contrast to the irregular nanoparticle shapes in Co3O4 and Co(OH)2 hybridized with rGO, Jin's group presented an elegant way to fabricate electrode materials by layered assembly of two types of atomically thin nanosheets, namely carboxylated graphene oxide and Co–Al LDH-nanosheet (NS).341 A reported synthesis protocol342 was adopted to obtain single-layer thin (∼0.8 nM) and positive charge-bearing [Co0.66Al0.34(OH)2]+ (zeta potential = 43 mV). Meanwhile, carboxylated GO (zeta potential = −50 mV) was negatively charged. Thus, the electrostatic interaction between GO and Co–Al LDH-NS could create a layered assembly as shown in Fig. 17. The specific capacitances of the layered composite were measured to be 1031, 854, 483, 250 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 8, 20 A g−1. After 6000 charge–discharge cycles at 20 A g−1, the capacitance remained stable. In their follow-up study, they fabricated flexible films of Co–Al-LDH NS/rGO via layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly onto surface modified-ITO substrates.343 Four films with 10, 20, 30 and 40 bilayers were prepared, with a mean thickness of about 4 nm for one bilayer (one Co–Al LDH-NS plus one GO). The specific capacitance of the four samples was in the range of 944–880 F g−1, not obviously varied with the bilayer numbers. The specific capacitances of the 40-bilayer film were 880, 713, 648, 539 and 461 F g−1 at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mV s−1, respectively. After the partial reduction of rGO to restore its conductivity, the specific capacitances of the 40-bilayer film were increased to 1204, 984, 828, 715 and 585 F g−1. On the other hand, the Co–Al LDH/rGO composite was prepared by precipitation under reflux conditions in the presence of urea.344,345 The composites showed a maximum specific capacitance of ∼700–800 F g−1.

Similar to Jin's electrostatic assembly approach,341p-aminobenzoate (PABA) ion-intercalated Co–Ni hydroxides were exfoliated to charge-bearing nanosheets and used as building blocks to construct a composite with graphene oxide.346 During a post-thermal treatment, GO was reduced by divalent cobalt while Co–Ni hydroxide nanosheets were transformed to NiCo2O4 particles. The NiCo2O4–rGO composite exhibited a specific capacitance of 835 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 which remained at 73.7% (615 F g−1) when the current density was increased to 20 A g−1. The specific capacitance of the electrode increased to 1050 F g−1 after 450 cycles and eventually remained at 908 F g−1 after 4000 cycles. Comparatively, the electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance, rate capability and cycling stability of the NiCo2O4–rGO composite was substantially better than those of pure NiCo2O4 and the mechanically mixed NiCo2O4–rGO composite.
Intriguingly, Yuan et al. present a facile approach to fabricate free-standing and binder-free flexible hybrid paper made of monolayer Co3O4 microsphere arrays grown on rGO/CNTs (Fig. 18).347 GO was reduced to rGO simultaneously during the hydrothermal treatment. Meanwhile, the CNTs were sandwiched in between the rGO sheets. The weight fraction of Co3O4 in the hybrid film was about 48%. The Co3O4-flexible paper electrode exhibited specific capacitances of 378, 364, 351, 330, 323 and 297 F g−1 at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 A g−1, respectively. The cycling performance was evaluated at increasing current densities for 2300 cycles and returned to 2 A g−1, about 96% of the initial capacitance could be recovered and maintained for another 700 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of the electrode was attributed to the intimate integration between the rGO/CNTs and the Co3O4 microspheres. Another binder- and additive-free electrode was obtained by sequential growth of vertically aligned graphene sheets on Ni foam followed by electrodeposition of Co(OH)2.348

11.3 Composites of cobalt compounds–three dimensional carbon nanomaterials50,349–354
Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs), with extremely high surface areas, controllable pore size, narrow pore size distribution, ordered pore structures and interconnected pore channels, have been studied for applications in electrochemical energy storage and sensors.50,349 Beside directly being used as electrode materials for EDLCs, OMCs can also be used as 3D supports for pseudocapacitive materials. Co(OH)2 was deposited onto the mesoporous carbon CMK-3 by a conventional chemical precipitation method.350 Without the CMK-3 support, as-precipitated Co(OH)2 consisted of amorphous particles and nanoflakes. In the presence of CMK-3, Co(OH)2 was grown with a uniform distribution of interconnected nanoflakes onto the surface of the CMK-3 wall, forming a unique 3D network structure with large surface area and inner space. The specific capacitances of the composite electrodes increased linearly with increasing content of CMK-3. The composite with 20 wt% CMK-3 achieved the highest specific capacitance of 750 F g−1, contributed by both EDL capacitance originating from the CMK-3 and pseudocapacitance from the Co(OH)2 nanoflakes. The composite electrode exhibited better high rate discharge capability compared with the Co(OH)2 electrode. The composite was able to maintain 86% of its initial specific capacitance when the discharge current density was increased from 5 to 50 mA cm−2. The mesoporous wall of CMK-3 reduces the ion intercalation distance to the nanometre range, facilitating the charge transfer. At the same time, the large mesopores (∼20–50 nm) of the interlaced nanoflakes enhance the diffusion of electrolyte ions into the porous electrode.
Beside hard templates, soft template approaches have been used to fabricate mesoporous carbon composite films containing cobalt oxide.351,352 The presence of Co3O4 nanoparticles increased the specific capacitance of the mesoporous carbon composite thin film from 22 F g−1 to 114 F g−1 (10% cobalt loading) and 125 F g−1 (20% cobalt loading). Apart from higher specific capacitance, Co-containing mesoporous carbon foams (Co-MCF) also presented better rate capability. The improvement is attributed to the improved wettability and thus better electrolyte–electrode contacts, increased graphitization degree, and faradaic pseudocapacitance contributed by cobalt. It should be noted that in both studies,351,352 cobalt compounds were used as additives to enhance the capacitive performance rather than a major electrode material.
Furthermore, NiCo2O4 nanocrystals (3–5 nm) were grown on a conductive mesoporous carbon aerogel.353 At low mass loading (∼0.23 mg), the composite electrode showed a very high specific capacitance of 1700 F g−1, excellent high rate capabilities and cycling stability. Co3O4 nanoparticles (66% of total weight) were embedded in a specially crafted mesoporous silica (SBA-15)–porous carbon membrane.354 The specific capacitance of the electrode reached 1086 F g−1 (1645 F g−1 based on Co3O4).
12. The use of 3D macroporous and other nanostructured supports or current collectors for cobalt-based electrode materials
In recent years, beside conventional planar current collectors such as metallic (e.g. Cu, Ni and Ti) foil, 3D macroporous current collectors in the form of foam or mesh are becoming more popular in ECs.355 Applications of 3D current collectors are motivated by the larger surface area, enhanced electrolyte diffusion, efficient electron pathways and effective utilization of active materials.
12.1 Nickel foam as current collector
Effects of different Ni substrates (plate vs. foam) on the specific capacitance of the electrodeposited porous α-Co(OH)2 film have been investigated.207 The capacitance of α-Co(OH)2 porous film/Ni foam is about two times the capacitance of the α-Co(OH)2 porous film/Ni plate. Apparently, the CV curve of α-Co(OH)2 porous film/Ni foam consisted of two redox pairs while there was only one redox pair for the CV curve of the α-Co(OH)2 porous film/Ni plate.
However, Xing et al. performed a cautious evaluation of the contribution of nickel foam to the specific capacitances of active electrode materials.356 Based on combinatory results from XPS analysis and electrochemical studies, they found that using nickel foam as a current collector could bring substantial error to the quantification of specific capacitances. In the continuous cycling of pure nickel foam in 1 M KOH, the redox couples relevant to various species of nickel hydroxides and oxyhydroxides were observed. The formation of nickel hydroxides or oxides on the nickel foam was also evidenced by the appearance of golden colour and the XPS analysis. These electroactive species could bring a significant overestimation of specific capacitance of other evaluated electrode materials, especially when a small quantity (e.g. <1 mg) of the electrode materials is used.198,207
Being an easily available, cheap, wide pH compatible (from neutral to basic) and high performance current collector, the use of nickel foam is obvious. However, careful subtraction of the capacitance contribution from nickel foam, or additional studies by using other inert 3D macroporous current collectors such as titanium foam, should be performed in order to avoid misleading and overestimated energy storage capacity. This is crucial especially when high capacity novel electrode materials are to be reported.
12.2 Nickel porous and nanostructured current collectors357–364
In addition to 3D nickel foam, various nanostructured nickel current collectors were also reported. The use of nanostructured current collectors provides shorter electrolyte ion transport paths and a larger surface area for high current during the redox reaction, thus achieving improved charge storage performance. Chang et al. prepared a Ni–Cu alloy layer on nickel foil by electroplating, followed by anodic dissolution of Cu from the alloy layer.357 Next, either Co3O4 (ref. 358) or Co(OH)2 (ref. 359 and 360) was deposited onto the porous Ni framework and a flat Ni foil (as a control). At the same deposited Co(OH)2 amount, the Co(OH)2–porous Ni framework (60 mF cm−2 or 2650 F g−1) obviously exhibited a higher specific capacitance than Co(OH)2–Ni foil (12 mF cm−2 or 550 F g−1). More importantly, the porous Ni framework is beneficial for loading a higher quantity of electroactive materials, leading to higher areal capacitance. The Co(OH)2–porous Ni framework presented a high rate capability to retain 93% capacitance when the CV scan rate was increased from 5 to 200 mV s−1. Notably, similar to Xing's work356 as mentioned in Section 12.1, Chang et al. observed that, upon continuous cycling of the porous nickel framework in alkaline electrolyte, Ni(OH)2 was formed and contributed to the voltammetric charge. The authors further speculated that the incorporation of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH into the deposited Co(OH)2 probably formed a Co–Ni mixed hydroxide based on an analysis of the CV curve. The incorporation of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH has significantly resolved the dissolution problem of Co(OH)2 in KOH solution.
Xia et al. prepared a 3D porous nickel film by the hydrogen bubble-templated method, followed by constant current cathodic electrodeposition of α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes361 (Fig. 19). In comparison to α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes deposited on commercial Ni foam, the α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes on a 3D porous Ni film undergo a more complete redox reaction as indicated by the appearance of an additional pair of redox couples. The specific capacitances of the α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes–3D porous Ni film were 2028 F g−1 (2 F cm−2) and 1920 F g−1 (1.9 F cm−2) at current densities of 2 A g−1 and 40 A g−1, respectively. These values were noticeably much higher than those of α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes–Ni foam (880 F g−1 and 727 F g−1, respectively). The high capacitance of the α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes–3D porous Ni film was able to remain at 94.7% after 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1.

In contrast to the above examples, a porous nickel layer was electrodeposited on hydrothermally synthesized α-Co(OH)2 nanoflake arrays.362 Incorporation of nickel (15 wt%) activated an additional pair of redox couples, shortened the potential separation between oxidation and reduction peaks and enhanced the peak currents. In addition, from galvanostatic charge–discharge curves, the α-Co(OH)2/Ni composite nanoflake arrays presented a lower charge voltage plateau and a higher discharge voltage plateau, indicating a smaller polarization. EIS analysis further confirmed a lower charge transfer resistance and ion diffusion resistance of Co(OH)2/Ni composite nanoflake arrays than those of the pristine α-Co(OH)2 nanoflake arrays. The Co(OH)2/Ni composite nanoflake arrays exhibited a high rate capability to retain 87.6% of the capacitance when charge–discharge current densities were increased from 1 A g−1 (1310 F g−1) to 40 A g−1 (775 F g−1).
Nickel grainy layer coated Si-microchannel plates (MCPs) were used as 3D supports for Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2 nanostructures.363,364 Then, α-Co(OH)2 nanostructures were deposited on the Si-MCPs by chemical bath deposition. The top walls of the Si-MCPs/Ni were covered by Co(OH)2 nanorods while the side walls were deposited with Co(OH)2 nanoflakes. An areal capacitance of 1.46 F cm−2 was obtained for the Si-MCPs/Ni/Co(OH)2 at 10 mV s−1.363 However, the electrode showed poor rate capability and suffered from 19.4% capacitance loss after 2000 cycles.
12.3 Carbon-material based 3D current collectors365–374
Carbon fiber paper (CFP) is made of interconnected conductive carbon microfibers with macroporous channels. It is extensively used in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The interconnected and conductive fiber networks in CFP provide efficient electron transport paths especially at high rates, while effective electrolyte diffusion is enabled by pore channels, establishing CFP as an attractive 3D current collector for pseudocapacitive metal oxide materials. Liu et al. coated a thin layer of Co3O4 nanonets and nanocubes on CFP (Fig. 20a–d) and studied the electrochemical capacitance of the electrode using a two-electrode setup.365 Owing to the much lower percolation threshold of Co3O4 nanonets than nanocubes, the nanonet electrode possesses more electron or ion pathways and faster charge carrier transport. In contrast to most reported Co3O4 electrodes, the CV curve of the Co3O4 nanostructures–CFP did not exhibit redox peaks commonly seen. The Co3O4 nanonets–CFP is ∼948 F g−1 at a current density of 14.06 A g−1 (mass loading = 1.4 mg cm−2), demonstrating a high specific capacitance, high rate capability and long cycling stability up to 5000 cycles. Later, the same research group fabricated 3D hierarchical CoxNi1−x double-hydroxide nanosheet coated NiCo2O4 nanowires grown on CFP with an improved rate capability and cycling stability.366

Adapted with permission from ref. 365, 367 and 374, ©2012 American Chemical Society. 
Similarly, Rakhi et al. adopted CFP as well as planar graphite paper as current collectors to grow Co3O4 nanowires by a solvothermal method.367 In their study, it was found that the configuration of nanowires was strongly dependent on the type of substrate: brush-like morphology for carbon fiber paper while flower-like morphology for planar graphite paper as shown in Fig. 20e and f. The specific capacitances calculated from the discharge curves (1 A g−1) for brush-like and flower-like morphologies in a three-electrode configuration were 1525 F g−1 and 1199 F g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the electrodes were subjected to further electrochemical analysis by a two-electrode configuration. Similar to Liu's work,365 the CV curves from the two-electrode configuration show no redox peak. The specific capacitances calculated from discharge curves based on the two-electrode configuration for brush-like and flower-like morphologies were 911 F g−1 and 620 F g−1 respectively at a low current density of 0.25 A g−1. At high current density (25 A g−1), the retained capacitances for brush-like and flower-like morphologies were 87% and 71% respectively. The better high rate capability of the brush-like morphology was attributed to the high electrical conductivity of the composite, homogenous dispersion of Co3O4 nanowires around carbon fibers, rapid transport of the electrolyte ions in the pore channels between carbon fibers and thus increased electrochemical utilization of Co3O4. Based on this work, it is worthwhile to further emphasize the differences between the 2-electrode and 3-electrode electrochemical setup.11 A three-electrode cell is definitely important to study the electrochemical characteristics of electrode materials, e.g. redox behavior of Co3O4; while a two-electrode cell is better to inform the most practical indication of a material's performance, as it simulates various factors in a packaged EC such as physical configuration, internal voltages, and charge transfer.11
Being an abundant and cost-effective material, textiles with flexibility, stretchability, and wearable and light-weight properties can be incorporated as wearable electronic and energy storage devices.368 With the availability of graphene and carbon nanotubes in the well-dispersed “ink” form, conductive textiles are now easily attained. By repeating a simple “dipping and drying” procedure, coating of poly(sodium-4-styrene sulfonate)-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) onto a textile sheet was achieved.369 β-Co(OH)2 nanopetals were then deposited onto this MWCNTs–cotton textile via a mild hydrothermal treatment. High areal capacitances of 11.22 F cm−2 and 7.71 F cm−2 were achieved at 15 mA cm−2 and 60 mA cm−2, respectively. On the other hand, mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays370 and MnO2 nanowire/CoAl LDH heterostructures371 were grown on carbon textile substrates. The NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1010 F g−1 at high current density (20 A g−1), retaining 79% of the capacitance at 1 A g−1.370
Inspired by the role of nickel foil used in chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth of graphene recently, CVD-grown graphene372 and graphite373 foams were successfully prepared by using nickel foam as a catalyst and sacrificial template. The 3D macroporous graphene foam (Fig. 20g), which retains the interconnected architectures in nickel foam, is highly conductive, and free of inter-graphene sheet resistance.372 Similar to the above examples of CFP and MWCNT–cotton textiles, a hydrothermal method was used to synthesize Co3O4 nanowires onto the graphene foam374 (Fig. 20h). The authors demonstrated that the Co3O4 nanowires–graphene foam presented a high specific capacitance of ∼1100 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 with excellent cycling stability.
12.4 Zeolite materials as 3D micro/meso-porous dispersing supports
Li and co-workers introduced an elegant way to exploit high surface area microporous zeolites as cation-exchange hosts to disperse loose Co(OH)2 nanowhiskers.375–378 Coprecipitated Co(OH)2 nanowhiskers were grown on the exterior of ultra-stable Y zeolite (USY), forming a loosely packed microstructure with ample voids (Fig. 21).375,376 Nevertheless, the composite material is able to exhibit a high specific and areal capacitance. The highest specific capacitance of the composite was 1492 F g−1, while corrected specific capacitance for the Co(OH)2 phase was 3500 F g−1, which is comparable to the theoretical capacitance value (3460 F g−1). Despite the amphiprotic nature of zeolite, the cycling stability was good, retaining ∼96% capacitance after 6000 cycles.

13. Conclusions and outlook
The above summary demonstrates the versatile synthesis approaches for nanostructured cobalt-based compounds, giving sufficiently good controllability on their structural and textural properties that are significant for surface redox reactions. Cobalt compounds, as wide bandgap semiconductors or insulators however, have intrinsically low electrical conductivity and this greatly impair the electron transport kinetics. Doped conductive oxides, nanostructured current collectors, and integration with conductive carbon nanomaterials are several rational strategies to boost their electrochemical performances. Meanwhile, cobalt-based mixed oxides and cobalt LDHs also present a wide range of new pseudocapacitive materials. The adjustable ratios, compositions and thus properties of these mixed oxides and LDHs offer new opportunities for further improvements. While substantial achievements were made in terms of materials designs, the development has always fallen short for the ever-growing demands ranging from portable electronics to transportation.
Several future trends in this field can be noted as follows:
13.1 Cobalt compounds–novel carbon nanomaterials
The emergence of new carbon materials (e.g. graphene foam,372 “activated” graphene,379 graphene quantum dots380) as well as the various existing forms provides versatile platforms for the integration with cobalt compounds and their composites. The synergistic combination of carbon nanomaterials with metal oxides can maximize the benefits from both components. For instance, graphene was found to improve the overall electrical conductivity of metal oxides, and this is particularly important for high power applications.76
13.2 Advanced 3D hierarchical hetero-nanostructures
Multi-component heteronanostructures built from nanoscale components, as well as the strategic exploitation of the remaining free space, offer unique opportunities with multi-faceted challenges.24 The complexity includes balancing various transportation requirements of the electronic, ionic and electrolyte fluid. As an example, while porous nanostructured nanomaterials offer ion transport pathways, the grain boundaries and disorders may induce additional electrical resistance. Although nanostructures have illustrated improved performance over their bulk counterparts, reports on the fundamental understanding such as electron transport for different classes of nanomaterials are scarce.
13.3 Current collectors: nano–micro–macro hierarchical architectures and unconventional one
By designing novel current collectors with suitable hierarchical systems of macropores, mesopores and micropores, a balance of efficient transport of electrolyte, ions and electrons would be achieved. In addition, unconventional current collectors such as carbon fiber papers, CNT bulky paper, flexible conductive cotton textiles and carbon cloths, flexible and transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET), sponges, paper, etc. offer a new arena for different niche designs and applications such as wearable electronics.
13.4 Asymmetric ECs9
Restricted by the intrinsic electrochemical properties of cobalt compounds, the operating potential window is typically very small (positive potential window of about ∼0.5 V). Asymmetric configuration with cobalt compounds as the positive electrode, and other negative electrodes such as carbon nanomaterials and iron oxides (ref. 381 and references therein), could possibly extend the effective potential window and give higher energy density. Various asymmetric ECs consisting of cobalt compounds and composites have been demonstrated.242,277,295,307,333,373,382–390 However, critical factors such as the electrode matching, mass ratio, suitable electrolytes, etc. for optimizing the device electrochemical performance (specific capacitance, EC voltage, energy density, power density and cycling stability) remain to be explored.391
13.5 Standardization of methods to report electrochemical capacitors' performance
Although impressive specific capacitances (F g−1) were widely reported for cobalt-based compounds and composites, many studies were performed on very low mass loading (<1 mg) of the active materials. Low mass loading possibly leads to exaggerated specific capacitance calculated, especially when an electrochemical active current collector is also used.356 Furthermore, the practical capacitance value and measured output are low. Maintaining high specific capacitance with high mass loading indicates that an electrode material offers a high utilization efficiency and is practical for real applications.82 It is proposed that authors should always report the mass loading or areal capacitances and even volumetric capacitances of their samples. Standardization of methods to evaluate the performance of electrode materials should be earnestly considered by the scientific community.11
