    , Accepted 21st August 2014First published on 21st August 2014AbstractHigh efficiency, solution processed organic–inorganic trihalide perovskite solar cells are now a reality, meaning that perovskite photovoltaics have the potential to challenge more established photovoltaic technologies. To date, some of the most efficient solution processed perovskite solar cells feature a pre-deposited Al2O3 scaffold and we have shown in a previous communication, that it is possible to make efficient devices by co-depositing the Al2O3 nanoparticles with the perovskite precursor solution. In this work, we have substituted the alumina nanoparticles with 3-aminopropyl (3-oxobutanoic acid) functionalized silica nanoparticles (f-SiO2). We observe performance enhancements in planar heterojunction (PHJ) devices made with up to 0.75 wt% f-SiO2 nanoparticles present in the precursor solution, yielding power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 12.4%, compared to the maximum PCE of 10.5% in the equivalent PHJ devices made without f-SiO2 nanoparticles. The performance enhancement arises in part from an average increase to VOC by up to 50 mV when the nanoparticles are present in the precursor solution and is attributed to substrate passivation within pinholes formed in the perovskite film during processing.
1 Introduction
It is less than two years since solid-state lead trihalide perovskite solar cells first made their appearance in the research literature1 and since then the pace of developments, especially in the rise in reported efficiencies, has been astonishing. The NREL certified maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) now stands at an impressive 17.9%,2 which brings lead halide perovskite photovoltaics into competition with established silicon technologies. The unique optoelectronic properties of the alkyl ammonium lead halide perovskite crystal structure had been studied previously by Mitzi and co-workers,3 but the first time such materials were utilised in photovoltaic applications was in 2009 when Kojima et al. employed CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites as sensitisers in liquid junction dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). They achieved a PCE of 3.8% with the triiodide perovskite.4 In 2012 the first reports of solid-state perovskite solar cells began to appear, breaking the record for a solid state DSSC type of device when a PCE of 9.7% was achieved utilising CH3NH3PbI3.1 In other work published in 2012 and focused on a mixed halide (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) perovskite it was found that electron transport was faster when an Al2O3 scaffold was utilised than when using a TiO2 scaffold. Higher efficiencies were achieved when using the insulating mesoporous Al2O3 scaffold than with a semiconducting mesoporous TiO2 scaffold/electron-acceptor. A PCE of 10.9% was achieved with VOC in excess of 1.1 V in a device utilising a sintered Al2O3 scaffold,5 it was later found that further improvements were gained when using a low temperature deposition method for the Al2O3 (PCE = 12.3%).6 Some research groups have shown that a nanoparticle scaffold is not necessary for high efficiency devices and have focused on the thin film PHJ architecture, yielding highly efficient devices of 10.8%7 and 11.4%8 in solution processed devices and an impressive 15.4% when the perovskite was co-evaporated from separate PbCl2 and CH3NH3I sources.9 Since the perovskite and the Al2O3 scaffold can both be deposited at low temperatures (<150 °C), the only high temperature heating step that remains in the most common device architecture is the sintering of the compact titania (c-TiO2) electron acceptor layer. Several approaches have been taken to tackle this issue including employing a graphene/TiO2 nanocomposite,10 utilising organic acceptor layers11–13 and solution processed c-TiO2 formed from the thermal decomposition of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) which has yielded a solution processed device with a PCE of 15.9%.14 These development have enabled the realisation of flexible perovskite cells on plastic substrates.12
To date some of the highest performing solution processed devices in the research literature have employed a mesoporous Al2O3 or TiO2 scaffold and we have shown that it is possible to co-deposit an Al2O3/perovskite layer at low temperature15 giving improvements in performance over PHJ devices manufactured without the Al2O3 nanoparticles. The improvement in device performance in this case was thought to arise from the Al2O3 favourably influencing perovskite crystallisation and reducing pinhole formation. The increase in VOC, observed has been attributed to reduced electron–hole recombination that would otherwise occur at the spiro-OMeTAD/c-TiO2 interface inside a perovskite pinhole. The importance of the effects of processing conditions upon perovskite film formation and subsequent photovoltaic performance has been firmly established as a critical factor in the manufacture of efficient devices;16 the formation of pinholes in the perovskite film has been recognised as an important issue that requires addressing17,18 and the beneficial effects of additions to the precursor solution has since been noted by other researchers who have utilised 1,8-diiodooctane to favourably modify perovskite crystallisation.19 Since our original communication15 on nanoparticle-Al2O3 additions to the perovskite precursor we have investigated a number of nanoparticles and additives and have discovered that adding small weight percentages of 3-aminopropyl (3-oxobutanoic acid) functionalized silica (f-SiO2) nanoparticles to the perovskite precursor solution of PHJ devices yields significant improvements in performance over that of devices manufactured without (f-SiO2) nanoparticles. This work will outline the improvements observed and will attempt to elucidate the mechanism by which the performance improvements are obtained.
2 Experimental
All materials were obtained from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise stated. The 3-aminopropyl (3-oxobutanoic acid) functionalized silica nanoparticles are obtained as a suspension in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The stated nanoparticle size is 15 nm (DLS). The stock suspension was diluted with DMF to give f-SiO2 weight percentages (w/v) of 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0% and 1.25%. These nanoparticle suspensions were used as the precursor solvent. The precursor solutions were made using a 3:1 molar ratio of CH3NH3I to PbCl2 and dissolved in the respective nanoparticle suspension at 40% total weight concentration. The CH3NH3I was synthesised according to the method described elsewhere.5 The c-TiO2 deposition solution was prepared by dissolving titanium isopropoxide (250 mM) in ethanol and acidified by adding ethanolic HCl to 20 mM. The c-TiO2 solution was deposited onto pre-etched NSG TEC-8 FTO coated glass (Xin Yan Technology Ltd) via spin coating, dried at 150 °C for 10 minutes before sintering at 450 °C for 30 minutes. Prior to perovskite deposition, the prepared substrates and deposition solutions were transferred to a glove box. The perovskite precursor solutions were deposited by spin coating and then annealed on a hotplate for at 100 °C for 45 minutes inside the glovebox. The hole transport layer was prepared by dissolving spiro-OMeTAD 2,2,7,7-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9(-spirobifluorene) in anhydrous chlorobenzene at 8% w/w and adding 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) to 70 mM concentration and 0.6 M bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) dissolved in acetonitrile to give a concentration of 13.6 mM LiTFSI in the spiro-OMeTAD deposition solution. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was deposited via spin coating. The devices were then taken out of the glove box and put into a desiccator to allow the spiro-OMeTAD to oxidise overnight. Gold contacts were then deposited via thermal (flash) evaporation of gold wire in an Edwards 306 bell jar evaporator. The photovoltaic performance of assembled solar cell devices was tested using an Oriel Sol 3A solar simulator, under normal illumination at 1 sun (1000 W m2, AM 1.5). The lamp output was calibrated with a reference silicon solar cell, traceable to NREL. Before IV measurement, devices were subjected to a 30 s light soak at 0 V applied bias. The reverse scan started at 1.4 V and proceeded to −0.2 V at a scan rate of 0.3 V s−1. The forward scan followed the same parameters starting at −0.2 V and ending at 1.4 V. UV-Vis spectroscopy measurements were carried out on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 750S UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Profilometry was carried out using Veeco Dektak 150 profilometer. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images were obtained using a S-4800 FEG-SEM from Hitachi (beam parameters: 12 keV, 10 μA; 8.8 mm working distance). Crystalline properties were determined by glancing angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on a Panalytical Xpert Pro diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 30 mA, and a 2θ range 10–70°, glancing angle of 1°). Photovoltage transients were measured as described previously.20 The white bias light was provided by a BRIDGELUX 9000 lumen LED array (Farnell) whilst the pulse light was provided by a bank of four OSLON PowerCluster green LED arrays (RS). Pulse intensity was chosen to ensure ΔV remained within the small perturbation regime. A pulse length of 250 μs was utilised and was generated via a fast MOSFET transistor controlled by a National Instruments USB-6251 data acquisition board (DAQ) and WaveMetrics IGOR Pro software. Voltages were measured directly using the DAQ. The opencircuit voltage was allowed to equilibrate for >60 s before the perturbation pulse was fired. The variance in photovoltage in the preceding 10 s before the perturbation pulse was fired was found to be, on average, <1.2 mV. A biphasic photovoltage decay was typically observed. The slower component of the decay was used to obtain the decay time constant. Impedance spectroscopy was carried out using a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat in a two-electrode configuration. The scans were carried out at various applied bias potentials and in the dark. The frequency range was set between 400 kHz and 10 Hz and the sinusoidal perturbation voltage was set at ±40 mV.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the results of initial experiments whereby silica nanoparticles (np-SiO2) and 3-aminopropyl (3-oxobutanoic acid) functionalized silica nanoparticles (f-SiO2) were present in precursor solutions at 1 wt%. Devices were manufactured and compared to PHJ devices where no nanoparticles are present in the precursor solution. The box and whisker plot represents a statistical analysis of the IV parameters of 12 devices in each category. The normalised PCE is shown in black and the VOC is shown in red. It can be seen that whilst no significant improvement to average PCE was observed after adding ordinary np-SiO2, there was a significant improvement in average PCE when f-SiO2 nanoparticles were present in the precursor solution. The performance enhancement that arose in this case was due to an increase in both open circuit voltage (VOC – shown in Fig. 1) and short circuit photocurrent (JSC). No significant improvement in fill factor was observed in this instance, however the performance enhancement imparted by the f-SiO2 was considered significant enough to warrant further investigation. To investigate further, a number of precursor solutions were made using various wt% f-SiO2 nanoparticle suspensions as the precursor solvent.

Fig. 2a shows a box and whisker plot that summarises the statistical IV data from that batch of solar cells and Table 1 displays the IV parameters of the highest efficiency device in each category as well as the mean and standard deviation for each category. Fig. 2b shows the IV curves for the best performing devices in each category. The number of devices in each category was 18 except for those made with a 1 wt% f-SiO2 precursor where only 17 working devices were manufactured. It should be noted at this point that hysteresis was observed in some of the devices during IV scanning and that the IV data presented here is calculated from the reverse-scan (i.e. from VOC towards JSC) IV curves only. Examples of the typical hysteresis observed in some of the devices is shown in Fig. S1.† Whilst the hysteresis observed in perovskite devices is an important issue that has begun to be addressed,21 this paper concerns the trends observed with varying wt% loadings of f-SiO2 nanoparticles and as such, for simplicity, only the reverse-scan IV data was considered. It should also be noted that we have not calculated the volume percentage of f-SiO2 nanoparticles in the crystallized perovskite films and investigating a suitable methodology of determining this value is the focus of ongoing research. As such the devices are defined by the weight percentage of f-SiO2 nanoparticles in the precursor solution used for their fabrication. The IV parameters for every device measured are shown in Table S1.†

From Fig. 2a and Table 1, it can be seen that high efficiency PHJ devices have been fabricated with efficiencies concurrent with those reported elsewhere.7,8 It can be seen that even a small addition of 0.25 wt% f-SiO2 nanoparticles increases average PCE and that further increases are observed up to 0.5 wt% f-SiO2. The maximum device efficiency (PCEmax) however, is achieved at 0.75 wt% with a PCE = 12.4%. At 1.0 wt% f-SiO2 the PCEmax decreases. The average PCE then decrease at 1.25 wt% f-SiO2. The performance increase from 0 wt% f-SiO2 to 0.5 and 0.75 wt% f-SiO2 can be attributed to an increase in photovoltage and photocurrent and although maximum device efficiency is achieved at 0.75 wt% f-SiO2, the highest mean device efficiency occurs in devices made with a 0.5 wt% f-SiO2 precursor. Devices made with a 0.5 wt% f-SiO2 precursor solution were also the most consistent of those manufactured (PCE = 11.0 ± 0.5%). These devices also had the highest average and most consistent fill factor. The decline in performance at the highest weight percentages appears to be due to a sharp decline in measured photocurrent, whilst voltages at this weight percentage remain higher than those devices made without nanoparticles. Fill factors, in general, appear to be affected little by nanoparticle wt% but the highest and most consistent fill factors are observed at a nanoparticle wt% of 0.5.

Fig. 2c shows the UV-Vis absorption, measured in reflectance mode to investigate whether f-SiO2 nanoparticles enhance light absorption in the perovskite film. The perovskite film thicknesses were also measured with a profilometer and were as follows: films with 0 wt% f-SiO2 nanoparticles had a thickness of 404 ± 47 nm, 0.25 wt% films (400 ± 40 nm), 0.5 wt% films (413 ± 30 nm), 0.75 wt% films (507 ± 34 nm), 1.0 wt% films (480 ± 52 nm) and 1.25 wt. % films had a thickness of 481 ± 33 nm. In Fig. 2c it appears that whilst the absorption of the perovskite film is affected by film thickness, the overriding trend is of increasing absorption with increasing wt% of f-SiO2 nanoparticles in films of similar thickness. The increased absorption can be attributed, either to better coverage of the substrate (i.e. fewer pinholes) or by increased light scattering caused by increasing levels of f-SiO2 nanoparticles in the perovskite film. Whichever is the main mechanism by which the absorption of the film increases, it is likely that the increase in JSC observed occurs, at least in part, as consequence of the absorption enhancement.

Fig. 3 shows low magnification SEM images of perovskite films with varying nanoparticle wt% loadings. The 0 wt% film appears to exhibit large pinholes whereby the compact c-TiO2/FTO layer is clearly visible within the voids of the perovskite layer. These pinholes reduce in size when f-SiO2 nanoparticles are present in the precursor at 0.25 wt% and appear to reduce further as the wt% of f-SiO2 is increased. At 0.75 wt% f-SiO2, it appears a plateau has been reached in terms of perovskite coverage and pinhole formation which reflects the maximum photovoltaic performance achieved at a nanoparticle wt% of between 0.5% and 1%. This phenomenon may help to explain the increase in VOC observed, as it appears that the f-SiO2 nanoparticles influence the crystallisation of the perovskite film so that the size of the pinholes is at first reduced with small f-SiO2 wt% loadings and appear to be significantly reduced in number at the highest nanoparticle wt% loadings. The pinholes in the perovskite film would likely act as recombination sites where the spiro-OMeTAD hole conductor could come into contact with the c-TiO2/FTO layer, especially if the c-TiO2 had defects or pinholes itself. Reducing the size or the number of pinholes could conceivably reduce the overall rate of recombination in a perovskite device with the consequence of increasing the VOC. The changes to the film morphology observed in Fig. 3 might also explain the increase in photocurrent observed in the perovskite devices when f-SiO2 are added to the precursor solution. It might be expected that a reduction in the size and number of pinholes in the film would increase the light harvesting efficiency of the perovskite layer due to increased substrate coverage. This is supported by the UV-Vis data in Fig. 2c and a consequence of increased light harvesting efficiency in the perovskite layer, would be increased photocurrent generation. The nanoparticles may also exhibit a scattering effect thereby increasing light absorption and therefore light-harvesting efficiency further. At the highest f-SiO2 wt% (1.25%), JSC decreases markedly. This may be caused by the higher loading of insulating nanoparticles reducing the amount of electron diffusion pathways within the perovskite film. It is however, still unclear why the photocurrent begins to reduce at higher wt% nanoparticle loadings when the UV-Vis spectra continue to show increasing absorbance up to the highest weight percentages. It is thought that IPCE data would assist in elucidating this phenomenon further but unfortunately this technique was unavailable at the time this work was conducted. IPCE data will however, be the focus of further studies on the effects of f-SiO2 nanoparticles suspended in the perovskite precursor.

To investigate whether the perovskite film morphology is altered by the addition of the f-SiO2 nanoparticles, the X-ray diffraction spectra of a 0 wt% f-SiO2 perovskite film and a 1 wt% f-SiO2 perovskite film were measured (Fig. 4). As observed by Liu et al.,9 we have identified the main diffraction peaks, assigned to the (110) and (220) crystal planes of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx crystal structure at 2θ of 13.71° and 28.06° respectively. These peaks appear in identical positions in both the 0 wt% and the 1 wt% f-SiO2/perovskite film which indicates that the presence of f-SiO2 did not significantly affect the nature the perovskite crystal structure. Scherrer peak analysis of the (110) peak in both films revealed a high crystalline range >100 nm, a result in agreement with the large and elongated crystal features observed by electron microscopy, which suggests that preferential growth and orientation of the perovskite crystals lie parallel to the surface of the c-TiO2/FTO substrate. The addition of f-SiO2 nanoparticles leads to an increase in the relative size of peaks related to alternative crystal planes meaning that the presence of f-SiO2 nanoparticles in the precursor solution leads to an increase in the growth of smaller, non-planar crystalline structures. These non-planar crystalline features can also be observed in Fig. 3e characterised by the brighter areas (also observed at higher magnification in Fig. 5).

(f) shows a pinhole at even higher magnification (×50000) where the f-SiO2 nanoparticles can be seen attached to the c-TiO2 layer. 
We have observed how the addition of f-SiO2 nanoparticles to the perovskite precursor solution has enhanced the performance of PHJ perovskite solar cells and that an increase in photovoltage is observed which can be explained by a reduction in the number and size of pinholes in the perovskite film. An increase in photocurrent is also observed which could also be due to a reduction in pinholes, yielding better substrate coverage, and also be due to light scattering by the nanoparticles. Similar consequences were observed when alumina nanoparticles were added to the perovskite precursor solutions15 and it is believed that the alumina scaffold common to the research literature also has the effect of favourably influencing perovskite crystal morphology.6 This does not explain however why the f-SiO2 nanoparticles give a performance enhancement in perovskite devices whereas non-functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles do not. Fig. 5 shows high magnification SEM images of the perovskite films where each image is focussed upon a pinhole void in the film. Fig. 5a shows a 0 wt% f-SiO2 film where pinholes are visible in the bottom corners of the image where the c-TiO2/FTO layer is clearly visible. Fig. 5b (0.25 wt%) shows a similar image, the c-TiO2/FTO layer is still visible in the void but there are now f-SiO2 nanoparticles attached to the c-TiO2/FTO layer. Fig. 5c (0.5 wt% f-SiO2) shows an apparent decrease in the size of the pinhole and the surface of the void seems to be almost completely covered in nanoparticles. The trend continues in Fig. 5d (0.75 wt% f-SiO2) and Fig. 5e (1 wt% f-SiO2) where the c-TiO2/FTO layer inside the perovskite voids appears to be covered with a monolayer of f-SiO2 nanoparticles. Deposits of f-SiO2 can now be seen within the perovskite film itself. This is also observable in the device cross-section SEM image shown in Fig. S2.†Fig. 5f shows a void in a 0.5 wt% f-SiO2 perovskite film at even higher magnification, showing in greater detail, the surface of the void covered in f-SiO2 nanoparticles. Electron dispersive X-ray analysis was performed to confirm the build up of nanoparticle deposits within the pinhole void and can be seen in Fig. S3.† Observing how the nanoparticles attach to the surface of the c-TiO2 layer it is reasonable to consider that they are anchored to the c-TiO2 layer via the carboxylic acid group of the 3-aminopropyl (3-oxobutanoic acid) chain. It is also reasonable to hypothesise therefore that the increase in VOC due to the addition of f-SiO2 nanoparticles is due in part to a surface passivation effect whereby the f-SiO2 nanoparticles hinder recombination inside a pinhole void where otherwise the c-TiO2 layer and the spiro-OMeTAD would come into contact. In order to determine whether this might be the case a selection of devices were subjected to transient photovoltage (TPV) decay experiments. Fig. 6 shows the TPV decay data for a selection of devices, comparing a 0 wt% f-SiO2 PHJ device with 0.25 and 0.5 wt% f-SiO2 nanoparticle devices. The TPV decay experiments were carried out as described previoulsy.20 The recombination kinetics in these types of devices are yet to be fully understood, however we observe a biphasic decay (Fig. 6 inset) which was typical for all devices measured and at all bias light levels. We have obtained the TPV decay time constant by fitting a first order exponential function to the slow component of the decay curve. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that the TPV decay is faster in PHJ devices with 0 wt% f-SiO2 than when f-SiO2 nanoparticles are present; this was found to be the case in all devices measured. If the observed TPV decay is representative of recombination at c-TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD interface, it suggests that the nanoparticles impart a passivation effect upon recombination at the c-TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD interface. The transient decay lifetime was similar for all f-SiO2 devices suggesting that this passivation effect occurs even at the lowest f-SiO2 nanoparticle wt% loadings studied here. For this reason, only a selection of devices are shown in Fig. 6 for clarity. To further investigate this phenomenon, impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out using the same parameters as described previously.22 Nyquist plots, obtained at applied biases of 400 mV and 800 mV are shown in Fig. S4.† It can be seen that the main impedance arc, attributed to recombination,23 has a lower resistance when there are no nanoparticles present. When f-SiO2 nanoparticles are added to the precursor solution, the resultant devices show increased recombination resistance which further supports the hypothesis of substrate passivation by the f-SiO2. In addition, similarly to the TPV decay data, it appears that no further improvements in recombination resistance are observed upon increasing the wt% of the f-SiO2 nanoparticles in the precursor solution. It appears that the passivation of the c-TiO2 layer reaches its maximum effectiveness at 0.25 wt% f-SiO2 and so further improvements to device performance upon further addition of f-SiO2 must be due to increased light absorption and improved film morphology.

It is clear from all of the data presented above, that performance enhancements are obtained when small weight percentages of f-SiO2 nanoparticles are added to precursor solutions, used to manufacture PHJ organic–inorganic trihalide perovskite solar cells. The f-SiO2 nanoparticles appear in this case, much like Al2O3 nanoparticles,15 to favourably influence crystal growth, possibly by offering increased nucleation sites, so that the perovskite films have smaller and fewer pinholes. This modification of film morphology can explain some of the increases seen in both VOC and JSC due to a reduction in recombination sites and improved light harvesting by the perovskite film. The biggest difference between the f-SiO2 nanoparticles and Al2O3 nanoparticles is that the f-SiO2 nanoparticles are functionalized by an aminoalkyl chain featuring a terminal carboxylic acid group. It appears from high magnification SEM images that the f-SiO2 nanoparticles preferentially assemble as a monolayer at the c-TiO2 surface inside the perovskite film pinholes and it is reasonable to assume that the nanoparticles are attached to the c-TiO2via the terminal carboxylic group of the functional chain. If a monolayer of insulating nanoparticles can accumulate at the c-TiO2 surface within a pinhole in the perovskite film, they could hinder any interfacial charge transfer processes that might otherwise occur at the c-TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD interface inside such a pinhole. Transient photovoltage decay data appears to indicate longer electron lifetimes when f-SiO2 nanoparticles are present and so we conclude that the performance enhancements observed in PHJ perovskite devices manufactured with f-SiO2 nanoparticles are obtained for two reasons. The first being favourable modification of the crystal morphology, by providing nucleation sites for crystal growth resulting in fewer and smaller pinholes in the perovskite film. The second reason for the performance enhancement appears to arise from a passivation effect by the nanoparticles at the exposed c-TiO2 surface with pinholes in the perovskite film.
4 Conclusions
Organic–inorganic lead trihalide perovskite solar cells offer an earth-abundant, low-cost photovoltaic technology, which combined with the rapid developments taking place in terms of device efficiency means that solar cells based on perovskite absorbers will be able to compete with more established technologies and have the potential to be rapidly commercialised. The fact that all manufacturing steps can be solution processed at low temperatures makes perovskite photovoltaics even more attractive. In order for commercialisation to occur, attention must be given to finding the right processing conditions in order to provide uniform, pinhole free perovskite films such as those obtained via dual source evaporation. One way of achieving this might be to use additives that positively influence film crystallisation without any detrimental effects to device performance.
We have shown the performance enhancements can be obtained in PHJ organic–inorganic lead trihalide perovskite cells due to the presence of 3-aminopropyl (3-oxobutanoic acid) functionalized silica nanoparticles in the perovskite precursor solution and we have determined that the enhancements are due to perovskite film morphology modifications resulting in fewer pinholes in the perovskite film and by passivation of the exposed c-TiO2 surface within the pinhole. This represents an attractive method for controlling perovskite film morphology, compatible with the commercialisation and scale-up of solution processed perovskite photovoltaics.
