    , Accepted 10th February 2016First published on 10th February 2016AbstractWe report the preparation of CuWO4 nanoflake (NF) array films by using a solid phase reaction method in which WO3 NFs were employed as sacrificial templates. The SEM, TEM and XRD results demonstrated that the obtained CuWO4 films possessed a network structure that was composed of single crystalline NFs intersected with each other. The CuWO4 NF films showed superior photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity to other CuWO4 photoanodes reported recently for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We attributed the high activity to the unique morphological and crystalline structure of the CuWO4 film, which enhanced the photoactivity by providing a large specific area, a short hole transport distance from the inside of CuWO4 to the CuWO4/solution interface, and a low grain boundary density. Hydrogen treatment by annealing the CuWO4 NF film in mixed gases of H2 and Ar could further enhance the photoactivity, as hydrogen treatment significantly increased the electron density of CuWO4 by generating oxygen vacancy in the lattice. The photocurrent density for OER obtained on the hydrogen-treated (H-treated) CuWO4 NF film is the largest ever reported on CuWO4 photoanodes in the literature. Moreover, the CuWO4 photoanodes exhibit good stability in weak alkaline solution, while the H-treated CuWO4 photoanodes exhibit acceptable stability. This work not only reveals the potential of CuWO4 as a photoanode material for solar water splitting but also shows that the construction of nanostructured CuWO4 photoanodes is a promising method to achieve high PEC activity toward OER.
Introduction
As the energy and environment crisis is threatening the future of human beings, there is an urgent need for finding a sustainable and clean energy source to replace the traditional fossil fuel.1 Hydrogen is widely recognized as an efficient, sustainable, and green fuel of the future because it produces only water upon combustion. Solar-powered water splitting based on semiconductor materials is a promising and environmentally-friendly process for hydrogen generation.1,2 Solar water splitting is in fact a thermodynamically uphill reaction driven by sunlight, which involves two electrochemical half-cell reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells have been widely used as water splitting devices to investigate one half-cell reaction because they spatially separate OER and HER.3 Compared to HER, OER is more complex and sluggish because it involves the removal of four electrons that requires the chemical bond rearrangements of two water molecules.4 Therefore, PEC OER has aroused great interest especially in recent years in the field of solar-to-chemical energy conversion.5–16
In principle, semiconductors whose valence band edge is more positive than the redox potential of the O2/H2O couple (1.23 V vs. NHE) can be used as photoanode materials for PEC OER.3 Many efforts have been made to develop photoanode materials and investigate their activity for PEC OER, and most of the investigation focused on the following semiconductors: TiO2,5,17 ZnO,9,18 Fe2O3,12–14,19 WO3,6–8,20 BiVO4,15,16 and Ag3PO4.10,11 It is clear that there are, in fact, not many semiconductors that can be used as candidate materials for PEC OER. Therefore, it is highly necessary to explore new photoanode materials that are suitable for solar-driven OER. Recently, copper(II) tungstate (CuWO4) has been demonstrated to have photocatalytic activity toward OER.21–24
Copper(II) tungstate (CuWO4) is an n-type semiconductor that has a bandgap energy of ca. 2.25–2.45 eV depending on the preparation method.21–24 This value is comparable to those of Fe2O3 (2.1–2.30 eV), BiVO4 (2.40 eV) and Ag3PO4 (2.43 eV), and is smaller than those of TiO2 (rutile: 3.03 eV, anatase: 3.20 eV), ZnO (3.37 eV), and WO3 (2.70 eV). As a result, CuWO4 absorbs a large part of the visible spectrum, which is very important for PEC OER catalysts to obtain a high photo-to-chemical conversion efficiency. The valence band edge of CuWO4 is located at ca. 2.8 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE),24 which is much higher than the potential of the O2/H2O redox couple, ensuring that the photogenerated holes in the conduction band of CuWO4 have enough energy to oxidize water. Other advantages of CuWO4 as a promising photoanode material include the low toxicity and the excellent stability against photocorrosion and chemical corrosion in acid and neutral electrolytes.21–24 However, the photocurrent density obtained at CuWO4 for OER was low compared to other photoanode materials,21–24 implying that there is room to further improve the OER performance of the CuWO4 photoanode.
It has been widely recognized that photoanodes composed of single crystalline one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured semiconductors possess better PEC OER performance due to the following reasons:8,18–20,25–28 (1) 1D and 2D nanostructured photoanodes have large specific areas that provide a large semiconductor/electrolyte interface where photoinduced holes react with water to generate O2. (2) 1D and 2D nanostructures ensure that photoinduced holes have a shorter diffusion length from where they are generated to the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, which is beneficial for improving the photo-to-oxygen efficiency. (3) Single crystalline 1D and 2D nanostructures can significantly suppress the electron–hole recombination rate by decreasing the grain boundaries in the electron transport path from semiconductors to conducting substrates, as the grain boundaries act as the electron–hole recombination centers. According to the above discussion, it is possible to improve the PEC OER performance of the CuWO4 by constructing 1D or 2D nanostructured CuWO4 photoanodes. The generation of oxygen vacancy in oxide semiconductors can improve the electrical conductivity, and then enhance the PEC performance by facilitating charge transfer.28–31 Li's group demonstrated that thermal treatment under an oxygen-deficient or reductive atmosphere is an effective way to generate oxygen vacancy in semiconductor oxides such as WO3, Fe2O3, and TiO2.28–31 Therefore, hydrogen treatment of the nanostructured CuWO4 may further improve its activity toward PEC water oxidation.
Herein, we report the fabrication of CuWO4 nanoflake (NF) array photoanodes by a template-assisted synthesis method in which WO3 NF arrays were employed as sacrificial templates. The obtained CuWO4 photoanode retained the nanostructure of pristine WO3 and exhibited high photoactivity toward OER, and the photocurrent density for OER is nearly two times higher than the values obtained previously at the same applied potentials on the CuWO4 photoanode.21–24 Moreover, we found that hydrogen treatment can further improve the activity of the CuWO4 NF array photoanode toward PEC OER.
Experimental
Chemicals and substrates
Tungstic acid (H2WO4), tungsten powder, hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), isopropanol (C3H8O), acetonitrile (C2H3N), urea (H2NCONH2) and oxalic acid (H2C2O4) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. All chemicals were used as delivered and without further purification. Fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates (F:SnO2, 8 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Asahi Glass, Japan.
Synthesis of WO3 nanoflake array films
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glasses (3 cm × 1 cm or 3.5 cm × 2.2 cm) were firstly cleaned by ultrasonication each for fifteen minutes in acetone, ethanol and deionized water, consecutively, and then dried under an N2 stream at room temperature. A layer of WO3 nanoseeds was deposited on a FTO substrate by a double-potential electrochemical deposition process, which was a modification of the previously reported approach.32 In detail, tungsten powder (2 g) was dissolved in a concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution (30%, 10 mL), and the resulting solution was diluted by adding 70 mL of deionized water and 30 mL of isopropanol. The diluted solution was used as a working electrolyte for the electrochemical deposition of WO3 nanoseeds. The electrodeposition was carried out in a three-electrode cell on a CHI 660A work station (CH Instruments Co.) A clean piece of FTO glass was used as the working electrode, and a coiled Pt wire and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All potentials are reported with respect to SCE in this work. The double-potential deposition was performed at −0.40 V for 300 s and 0.20 V for 15 s. After electrodeposition, a transparent thin layer of WO3 nanoseeds was formed on the FTO substrate, and then the WO3 nanoseed-modified FTO substrate was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min to improve the combination between the WO3 nanoseeds and FTO substrate.
Vertically aligned WO3 NF arrays were grown on the seeded FTO substrates via a hydrothermal method that was a modification of a previously reported approach.19,20 In detail, 3 mL of aqueous H2WO4 (0.05 M) solution, 0.02 g of oxalic acid, 0.02 g of urea, and 0.5 mL of HCl (6.0 M) were added into 12.5 mL of acetonitrile to form a mixed solution. The mixed solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and then the WO3 nanoseed-modified FTO substrate was immersed in the mixed solution with the seeded side facing down. The hydrothermal growth was carried out at 180 °C for 2 h. The resulting FTO supported WO3 NF arrays were rinsed with deionized water and then dried under a high purity nitrogen flow at room temperature.
Synthesis of CuWO4 nanoflake array photoanodes
CuWO4 NF arrays were fabricated on FTO substrates using the WO3 NF arrays as the sacrificial templates. The Cu(NO3)2 solution was prepared by dissolving Cu(NO3)2 in acetic acid and the final concentration of Cu(NO3)2 in acetic acid is 0.1 M. The Cu(NO3)2 solution (0.1 M, 100 μL) was drop-cast onto the surface of the FTO supported WO3 NF arrays, and the solution was dried in air at room temperature. After the drop-casting and the drying procedure was repeated twice, the samples were annealed in air at required temperatures (450 °C, 550 °C, and 650 °C) in a muffle furnace for 2 h. Then, a dark yellow film, which was a mixture of copper oxides and CuWO4,22 was obtained on the surface of the FTO substrates. The FTO supported CuWO4 NF arrays were finally obtained by immersing the sample in 0.5 M HCl for 30 min to remove the copper oxides. Hydrogen treatment of the CuWO4 NF films was carried out in a tube furnace system (NBD-O1200-801T, NBD Ltd, China) under a 5% hydrogen atmosphere (1 bar, 400 sccm H2 in Ar flow) at 250 °C for the required time.
Characterization
The morphology of the CuWO4 samples was characterized by using a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) operating at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and elemental mapping (Cu, W and O) were performed on a field emission JEM-2010F TEM/STEM (JEOL Ltd, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the CuWO4 films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku, rint2000 advance theta–2theta powder diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation. UV–vis absorption spectra were obtained by UV–vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy on a Shimadzu 3600 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical Ltd, Japan) using Mg-monochromatic X-ray at a power of 150 W with an analysis area of 800 μm × 800 μm. The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV as the reference.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI660D workstation (CHI Instruments Co.), using a 500 W xenon lamp as the light source. The exposed electrode area was 0.246 cm2 and was illuminated from the front side. The incident light intensity on the surface of the photoelectrode was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2. All electrochemical measurements were performed in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9) or 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH 7), using Pt foil and SCE as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Linear potential sweep measurements were performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Long-term stability measurements were carried out by using large CuWO4 electrodes (3.5 cm × 2.2 cm) in a PEC cell with an exposed illumination area of 1.33 cm2.
Results and discussion
CuWO4 NF array films were prepared according to the strategy presented in Fig. 1. The WO3 NF arrays, which were used as sacrificial templates to fabricate CuWO4, were first grown on FTO substrates via a two-step method that involves a double-potential electrodeposition process and a hydrothermal growth process. The double potential electrodeposition was performed to generate a layer of WO3 nanoseeds on the FTO substrates and the follow-up hydrothermal process is to grow vertically-aligned WO3 NF arrays. The obtained FTO-supported WO3 NF arrays showed a light yellow color and have a strong adhesion to the FTO substrates. Fig. 2a and b show the typical SEM images of the WO3 NF array film. The low-magnification SEM image (Fig. 2a) clearly shows that the vertically-aligned WO3 NFs grow uniformly on a large scale on the FTO substrate, and most of the NFs were intersected with each other to form a network structure, which provides a large specific area. The high-resolution SEM image (Fig. 2b) demonstrates that the WO3 NFs have a very small thickness of ca. 5 nm to 20 nm, ensuring a short length for foreign atoms to diffuse into WO3. This feature is very important for the sacrificial template synthesis strategy proposed in this work because Cu2+ and O2− ions have to diffuse into WO3 to completely transform WO3 to CuWO4 during the thermal reaction between WO3 and copper precursors.22,33

The hydrothermally grown WO3 NF arrays were used as sacrificial templates to prepare CuWO4 NF arrays on FTO substrates, as shown in Fig. 1b–d. The Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution (0.1 M, 100 μL) was drop-cast onto the WO3 nanoflake arrays and dried at room temperature in the air. When the mixture of WO3 and Cu(NO3)2 were annealed in air at 550 °C, the following reactions occurred: 2Cu(NO3)2(s) → 2CuO(s) + 4NO2(g) + O2(g)(1) WO3(s) + CuO(s) → CuWO4(s)(2)
The decomposition of Cu(NO3)2 occurred first at 170 °C and gave CuO,34 which could react with WO3 to generate CuWO4 at 550 °C.21 After the thermal reaction, a grey yellow film composed of CuO and CuWO4 was obtained. The excess CuO was removed by immersing the annealed sample in 0.5 M HCl solution for 30 min, and a bright yellow-colored film was finally obtained. Fig. 2c and d show the typical SEM images of the obtained CuWO4 film, which demonstrates that the CuWO4 film retained the flake-like nanostructure of the WO3 template though the obtained NFs are a little thicker (ca. 20–60 nm) than the original WO3 NFs (ca. 5–20 nm). We believe that the small change in the thickness was caused by the heat treatment and the solid phase reaction between CuO and WO3. The retained network structure of the CuWO4 NFs ensures that the CuWO4 film has a large specific area, which is very important for obtaining a high photo-to-oxygen conversion efficiency when the film is employed as a photoanode for solar water splitting.
TEM was employed to characterize the crystalline structure of the WO3 and CuWO4 NFs, and the typical high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of WO3 and CuWO4 are presented in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The HRTEM image of the hydrothermally grown WO3 (Fig. 3e) shows well resolved lattice fringes of 0.365 nm, corresponding to the (200) facet of monoclinic WO3, which is in good agreement with the previous report.27 However, after the thermal reaction of WO3 with Cu(NO3)2 (see the chemical eqn (1) and (2)) and removal of excess CuO, the resulting NFs no longer show the structural features of monoclinic WO3, as shown in Fig. 3b. Instead, they exhibit a single crystalline structure of CuWO4. The lattice spacing of 0.377 nm is clearly identified, in good agreement with the interplanar distance of the (01) facets of triclinic CuWO4. Moreover, the large region TEM images and selected-area electron diffraction pattern (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) provide solid evidence that single crystalline CuWO4 NFs are obtained via a solid phase reaction at 550 °C. Fig. 3c–f show the elemental (Cu, W and O) mapping of a CuWO4 NF. It can be clearly seen that, similar to W and O, Cu is evenly distributed throughout the entire NF, indicating that the obtained NFs are composed of a copper-containing compound in which Cu, W and O are uniformly dispersed. On the basis of the TEM and elemental mapping results, we can safely conclude that the strategy illustrated in Fig. 1 was successful for the preparation of CuWO4 NF arrays on FTO substrates.
 Fig. 3  Typical HRTEM images of an individual NF of WO3 (a) and CuWO4 (b). Elemental mapping images of a CuWO4 NF (c)–(f). The WO3 NFs were annealed at 550 °C for 2 h and the CuWO4 NFs were prepared by a solid phase reaction between WO3 and Cu(NO3)2 at 550 °C for 2 h. 
The TEM and elemental mapping results also imply that the annealing temperature of 550 °C is high enough to generate CuWO4via the solid phase reaction, this observation is in good agreement with the recent reports in which nanostructured CuWO4 electrodes were prepared via a solid state reaction.21,22 However, it should be pointed out herein that, for the complete conversion of WO3 and CuO powders to CuWO4 by a solid phase reaction, a temperature of at least 800 °C is required.33 To investigate if the WO3 templates were completely transformed to CuWO4 at 550 °C, XRD experiments were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 4. Before the solid phase reaction, the XRD spectrum of the WO3 film shows a diffraction pattern of monoclinic WO3, with two strong diffraction peaks of (002) and (200) appearing at 23.3° and 24.5°, respectively. However, after the solid phase reaction at 550 °C for 2 h and removal of excess CuO, the diffraction peak of WO3 totally disappears in the XRD spectrum, and the XRD pattern of triclinic CuWO4 can be clearly seen, indicating a complete conversion of WO3 to CuWO4 at 550 °C. We believe that the much lower thermal reaction temperature required in this work is due to the unique structure of the WO3 NF templates. As demonstrated in Fig. 2a and b, the WO3 NFs have a very large specific area and a very small thickness of ca. less than 20 nm, which significantly lower the reaction temperature for a complete conversion.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the FTO supported WO3 and CuWO4 films. The CuWO4 films were prepared at reaction temperatures of 450, 550 and 650 °C. 
To further investigate the effect of the reaction temperature on the crystal structure and the morphology of the resulting CuWO4 films, the solid phase reaction was performed at different temperatures. Fig. 4 also shows the XRD patterns of the CuWO4 film prepared at annealing temperature of 450 and 650 °C for 2 h. The CuWO4 film prepared at 450 °C shows a XRD pattern that is characteristic of an amorphous structure, indicating the poor crystalline quality of the resulting CuWO4 film. In addition, the diffraction peaks of WO3 are hardly identified in the XRD spectrum, suggesting that nearly all the WO3 NFs were converted to amorphous CuWO4. The CuWO4 film prepared at 650 °C has the same XRD pattern as that prepared at 550 °C, exhibiting good crystalline quality of triclinic CuWO4. Fig. 5a and b show the SEM images of the CuWO4 films prepared at 550 and 650 °C, respectively. The CuWO4 film prepared at 450 °C had a network structure of NF arrays (Fig. 5a), which resembled the microstructure of the WO3 NF templates. However, the SEM image (Fig. 5b) clearly demonstrates that the CuWO4 film prepared at 650 °C was composed of submicroparticles with an average diameter of ca. 300 nm. This microstructure is totally different from the original WO3 NF templates, providing solid evidence that the reaction temperature had a significant effect not only on the crystal structure but also on the morphology of the resulting CuWO4 film.

The light absorption properties of the semiconductor materials are one of the key parameters controlling the photo-conversion efficiency. We examined the UV-vis absorption spectra of the WO3 and the CuWO4 NF array films, and the results are shown in Fig. 6a. The WO3 NF array film shows an onset light absorption wavelength of ca. 450 nm because of its large bandgap (ca. 2.7 eV).19,20 When WO3 was converted to CuWO4, the resulting film exhibited a band edge absorption at ca. 525 nm that was well corresponded to the relatively narrow bandgap of CuWO4 (ca. 2.4 eV).21 The Tauc plots, which are obtained from the corresponding UV-vis spectra, are shown in Fig. 6b in which the band gap energy of WO3 and CuWO4 was obtained to be 2.77 eV and 2.37 eV, respectively. These values are in accordance with those reported previously.20–23 The relatively small band gap of CuWO4 allows it to absorb a wider region of the visible spectrum as compared to WO3, and this is very important when the obtained CuWO4 NF array film is used as a photoanode for solar water splitting.
 Fig. 6  UV-vis absorption spectra (a) and the Tauc plots (b) of the WO3 and CuWO4 NF array films. The WO3 film was annealed at 550 °C for 2 h, and the CuWO4 film was prepared by a solid phase reaction of WO3 and Cu(NO3)2 at 550 °C for 2 h. 
The activity of CuWO4 toward PEC water splitting was systematically investigated in a three electrode cell. Fig. 7a shows the linear potential sweep response of the CuWO4 NF array photoanode (prepared at 550 °C) in 0.1 M borate buffer solution (pH 9) in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. No oxidation current could be observed on the CuWO4 electrodes within the potential range from −0.2 V to 1.0 V vs. SCE in the dark, indicating that CuWO4 exhibited no electrochemical activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, under illumination, a large oxidation photocurrent was observed, and this oxidation photocurrent arose from PEC OER.21–24 It should be mentioned here that the OER photocurrent density reaches 0.32 mA cm−2 at 0.46 V vs. SCE (1.23 V vs. RHE). This value and those reported in the literature are listed in Table 1 for comparison. From Table 1 it can be seen that our value is among the highest ever reported for CuWO4 photoanodes.21–24,35–44 We also investigated the photoactivity of the CuWO4 electrode in pH 7 solution (0.1 M phosphate buffer solution), and found that the photoanode also exhibited good activity toward OER in neutral media. To examine the effect of the pH value and the PEC performance of the CuWO4 photoanodes, we compared the current–potential curve obtained in pH 9 and pH 7 solutions, and the results are shown in Fig. 7b. When the photocurrent density was plotted against potential vs. SCE, the current–potential curves obtained at pH 7 and pH 9 are similar to each other, except that the pH 9 curve is negatively shifted by about 0.24 V.

This behavior is determined by the Nernst equation because OH− (or H+) is involved in the water oxidation reaction. As is well known, the Nernst influence of pH can be ruled out when the photocurrent density is plotted against potential vs. RHE. The inset of Fig. 7b clearly shows that the photocurrent–potential curves obtained at pH 7 and pH 9 nearly coincide with each other when the potential was reported with respect to RHE. This result indicates that the CuWO4 photoanode has almost the same activity at pH 7–9.
We believe that the high OER photocurrent density arises from the single crystalline NF array structure of the CuWO4 film, which has the following advantages as an OER photoanode: (1) the network structure of NFs ensures a large specific area that not only benefits the light absorption but also provides a large CuWO4/solution interface where PEC OER occurs. (2) The small thickness (<60 nm) of the CuWO4 NFs ensures a very short length for photoinduced holes to transport from anywhere inside CuWO4 where they are generated to the CuWO4/solution interface and they oxidize water. (3) The single crystalline CuWO4 NFs have a low electron–hole recombination rate during the transport of photoinduced-electrons from CuWO4 to the conductive FTO substrate because the single crystalline structure greatly decreases the grain boundaries (electron–hole recombination centers) inside CuWO4.

Fig. 7a also demonstrates that the preparation temperature of the CuWO4 films has a significant effect on their photoactivity toward OER. The CuWO4 films prepared at 450 °C and 650 °C exhibit much lower photocurrent density for OER compared to the one prepared at 550 °C. We believe that the poor crystal quality was responsible for the low photoactivity of the CuWO4 film prepared at 450 °C though it retained the NF network structure (see Fig. 4 and 5a). As for the CuWO4 film prepared at 650 °C, although the film exhibited a good crystal quality (Fig. 4), it lost the NF network structure due to the formation of large CuWO4 submicroparticles at high temperatures (Fig. 5b), resulting in a significant decrease of the photoactivity toward PEC OER. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the good crystal quality and the NF network structure are two prerequisites for obtaining high activity of CuWO4 photoanodes.
It was reported that hydrogen treatment of TiO230 and WO328 could significantly enhance their photoactivity, as hydrogen treatment greatly increased the donor density (the majority carrier density) of these materials by introducing large amounts of oxygen vacancies.28,30 Inspired by this idea, we used hydrogen treatment to improve the photoactivity of the CuWO4 NF photoanode for OER. The hydrogen treatment was performed at 250 °C for 60 min in a mixed gas of H2 and Ar with a H2-to-Ar volume ratio of 1:19. Fig. 8a shows the activity of the hydrogen-treated (H-treated) CuWO4 photoanodes toward OER. It is clearly seen that hydrogen treatment can significantly improve the photoactivity of the CuWO4 electrodes especially at high overpotentials (potentials higher than 0.50 V vs. SCE). The photocurrent density of the H-treated CuWO4 photoanode is 0.84 mA cm−2 at 0.80 V vs. SCE (1.57 V vs. RHE), which is an enhancement of over 40% the value of the untreated CuWO4 photoanode. It should be pointed out here that this photocurrent density (0.84 mA cm−2 at 1.57 V vs. RHE) is over 3 to 6 times larger than those reported at the same potential (vs. RHE) in the literature (see Table 1).21–24 The photocurrent density of the H-treated CuWO4 film reached 1.0 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. SCE, which is comparable with the value obtained on many commonly-used photoanodes such as WO3,28,45 Fe2O3,46 BiVO4,47 and TiO2.48Fig. 8a also shows that the hydrogen treatment time has a very small influence on the photoactivity. We also investigated the OER performance of the H-treated CuWO4 films in neutral solution (0.1 M phosphate buffer solution at pH 7) and found that they exhibited good photoactivity (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†).
 Fig. 8  (a) Current density–potential responses of the H-treated CuWO4 photoanodes in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9) at a potential sweep rate of 10 mV s−1 in the dark and under illumination (100 mW cm−2). The current density–potential response of the untreated CuWO4 photoanode is also presented for comparison. (b) Current density–time responses of the CuWO4 and H-treated CuWO4 photoanodes at a constant potential of 0.80 V vs. SCE (1.57 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 M borate buffer solution (pH 9) under illumination (100 mW cm−2). 
The stability during solar water splitting is another important parameter for photoanode materials. It has been reported that CuWO4 is quite stable during PEC OER in borate solution with pH ≤ 7.23 Herein, we evaluated the stability of both the CuWO4 and the H-treated CuWO4 photoanodes in a weak basic buffer solution of borate (pH 9) at a potential of 0.80 V vs. SCE (1.57 V vs. RHE), and the results are shown in Fig. 8b. The responsive photocurrent density of CuWO4 remains almost constant at about 0.53 mA cm−2 during 1 h measurement, indicating that CuWO4 has a much higher stability in weak basic solution than WO3, because the latter is only stable in acid solution (pH ≤ 4) and would lose its activity even in neutral and weak alkaline media.45 The good stability of CuWO4 in a wide pH range makes it more suitable to be applied in PEC cells. The H-treated CuWO4 photoanodes show an acceptable stability though they were not as stable as the untreated CuWO4 photoanodes. Fig. 8b clearly demonstrates that the photocurrent density of H-treated CuWO4 decreased to 80% of its original value after 1 h of the reaction. Fig. 8b also shows that, in the constant potential measurements, the H-treated CuWO4 also exhibits superior PEC activity compared to CuWO4, which is consistent with the results of linear potential sweep measurements. The photocurrent density of the H-treated CuWO4 photoanode is ca. 0.69 mA cm−2 after 1 h of the reaction, which is an enhancement of about 30% compared to the untreated CuWO4 photoanode.
To elucidate the effect of hydrogen treatment on the photoactivity of CuWO4, we recorded the XPS spectra of the pristine CuWO4 and hydrogen-treated CuWO4. Fig. 9a and b show the normalized high resolution W 4f XPS spectra of CuWO4 and H-treated CuWO4, respectively. The W 4f spectra can be deconvoluted into two pairs of peaks, corresponding to the typical binding energies of the two oxidation states of tungsten, W6+ (centered at 35.5 eV and 37.7 eV) and W5+ (centered at 34.3 eV and 37.0 eV), respectively.28 All the deconvoluted peak areas of W6+ and W5+ are listed in Table 2. The atomic percentage of W5+ in CuWO4 can be calculated according to the following equation: (3)where A34.3 eV and A37.0 eV are the two deconvoluted peak areas of W5+ at 34.3 eV and 37.0 eV, respectively, and A35.5 eV and A37.7 eV represent the two peak areas of W6+ at 35.5 eV and 37.7 eV, respectively. As the hydrogen treatment provided a reducing atmosphere (mixed gases of H2 and Ar) and a relatively high temperature, a small amount of W6+ could be reduced to W5+, and as a result, the atomic concentration of W5+ in CuWO4 increased from 3.4% before to 6.9% after hydrogen treatment. The increase of the W5+ concentration indicates an increase of oxygen vacancy.28 As oxygen vacancy was regarded as a shallow donor for oxide semiconductors such as TiO2,30,49,50 WO3,28 and α-Fe2O3,29 its increase results in an increase of the majority carrier density, which is in favor of more efficient PEC performance for OER.28–31

It is well known that the electron carrier density can be calculated according to the Mott–Schottky equation:51,52 (4)where Cscr is the capacitance of the space charge region, E is the potential applied to the electrode, Efb is the flat band potential, ε is the dielectric constant of CuWO4, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, N is the donor density (majority carrier density, electron density n-type semiconductors such as WO3 and CuWO4), e is the electron charge, kB is the Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. We measured the capacitance (C) of the CuWO4/solution (0.1 M sodium borate, pH 9) interface at different potentials using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the Mott–Schottky plots of CuWO4 and H-treated CuWO4 are shown in Fig. 10. It should be pointed out that the CuWO4/solution interfacial capacitance, C, is composed of the space charge region capacitance (Cscr) and double layer capacitance (Cdl) in series. As the Cdl is much larger than Cscr, 1/Cscr2 ≈ 1/C2,51 accordingly, we can estimate the electron density in CuWO4 from the slope in the Mott–Schottky plot. As shown in Fig. 10, both the CuWO4 and H-treated CuWO4 samples show a positive slope, indicating that CuWO4 is an n-type semiconductor. H-treated CuWO4 has a much smaller slope as compared to CuWO4, and the electron densities of CuWO4 and H-treated CuWO4 are calculated to be 1.20 × 1019 cm−3 and 3.26 × 1019 cm−3, respectively, when the ε value of CuWO4 is taken as 83.53 Therefore, we can conclude that the electron density in CuWO4 is increased over 2.7 times after hydrogen treatment. Higher electron density allows a faster carrier transfer in H-treated CuWO4, and then leads to an enhanced PEC performance for OER.

Conclusions
In summary, we report the preparation of FTO-supported CuWO4 NF array films by using WO3 NFs as sacrificial templates. The obtained CuWO4 film shows a network structure that is composed of single crystalline CuWO4 NFs with an average thickness of ca. 20–60 nm. The CuWO4 NF array photoanodes exhibit high activity toward PEC OER and the photocurrent density obtained at 1.23 vs. RHE is the highest among the reported values obtained for CuWO4. The high activity toward PEC water splitting is ascribed to the network structure of single crystalline NFs, which ensures a large specific area, a short hole transport distance to CuWO4 surface, and a low density of grain boundary. Hydrogen treatment of the CuWO4 NFs generates oxygen vacancies in the lattice of CuWO4, which act as shallow donors and significantly increase the majority carrier density (electron density) of CuWO4. As a result, hydrogen treatment further enhances the photoactivity of the CuWO4 NF films, and photocurrent density of the H-treated CuWO4 NF photoanode is the largest ever reported on CuWO4 photoanodes in the literature. In addition, the CuWO4 photoanodes exhibit good stability in weak alkaline borate buffer solution (pH 9), while the H-treated CuWO4 photoanodes exhibit acceptable stability. We believe that this work reveals the potential of nanostructured CuWO4 as a promising candidate photoanode for solar water splitting.
