Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) were employed to analyze the electronic structures, optical properties and electron transfer processes under on-field and off-field conditions. The interfacial electron transfer (IET) processes across the semiconductor interface were evaluated, which have been less investigated previously. Compared to the off-field condition, the conversion efficiency of DSSCs is increased when the electric field acted on the +X axis due to the broader absorption spectra, larger ICT parameters, and larger short-circuit photocurrent density governed by the injection driving force. In addition, the further increased conversion efficiency with increased electric field strength indicates that the POM-based dye has self-promoting properties, meaning that the generated inner electric field increases the light harvesting properties of the POM-based-dye, which in turn forms stronger electric field strengths, and finally improves the performance of DSSCs. It is expected that the present study could establish the relationship between the electric field and DSSC efficiency.
1. Introduction
Traditional fossil fuel energy is constantly being consumed, which has a negative effect on the global climate. Solar energy offers the largest potential solution to the environmental pollution and energy crisis. As alternatives to conventional silicon (Si)-based solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained widespread attention owing to the lower cost, simple fabrication procedure and abundant raw materials.1 The dye is an important component in DSSCs, which plays a crucial role in promoting higher photovoltaic efficiency. The operation principle of DSSCs can be described as: the sensitizing dye grafted on the surface of a mesoporous semiconductor substrate injects photoexcited electrons into the semiconductor conduction band (CB). Then, the oxidized dye is reduced back to the neutral state by a redox mediator. Finally, the electrons are transferred to an external circuit and the redox mediator is in turn regenerated at the counter electrode, leading to a large amount of electron accumulation in the semiconductor electrode and the counter electrode. Consequently, an inner electric field is formed between the electrode and the counter electrode when DSSCs work.2–6 Zheng and co-workers reported the influence of the inner electric field on the efficiencies of various porphyrin-sensitizers.4 They found that the effects of the inner electric field on sensitizer molecules are different, and meso-substituted Zn–porphyrin sensitizers have the highest efficiency. Bai and co-workers found that the electric field along the +X axis in arylamine organic dyes can increase the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.5
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of anionic metal–oxygen clusters comprised of abundant elements, have fascinating structures and photophysical properties,7–14 and play important roles in diverse disciplines involving catalysis, materials science, analytical chemistry and DSSCs.15–23 Tunable organic groups are able to anchor on the surface of POM clusters, forming novel and flexible POM-based inorganic–organic hybrids, which can significantly red-shift the absorption bands compared with the individual components, resulting from the synergistic effect between the POM clusters and organic segments.24 Thus, POM-based dyes are expected to be highly efficient dyes for DSSCs.
An inner electric field is generated when DSSCs work, and an influence of the electric field on POM-based dyes is inevitable since dyes work under the electric field. Though the directions of the inner electric field acting on dyes are arbitrary due to the rough surface of the semiconductor electrode after dyes are adsorbed on the electrode, it is found that the main direction of the inner electric field is defined as a vector pointing from the counter electrode to the semiconductor electrode.4 POM-based dyes have been explored for screening potential highly efficient dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells. However, how does the inner electric field affect the performance of POM-based dyes in DSSCs, especially how does the direction of the electric field affect the performance, and are the effects of different direction electric fields on the performance of POM-based dyes the same? And how about the performance of POM-based dyes under different electric field strengths? Theoretical calculations as low-cost and efficient tools that have been used to evaluate the performance of POM-based dyes25–28 were used herein to further understand the function of the inner electric field in the performance of DSSCs. Apart from the electronic structure, the absorption spectra and intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) of an isolated POM-based dye as well as the interfacial electron transfer (IET) processes between the POM-based dye and TiO2 model under different electric field directions were also taken into consideration. Moreover, the performance of DSSCs with different electric field strengths was also analyzed.
2. Computation details
All the calculations for the isolated POM-based dye were performed using the Gaussian 09 D01 package.29 The ground-state geometries of all POM-based dyes were optimized with density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP30/LANL2DZ (Mo) and B3LYP/6-31G(d) (O, C, H) levels. Based on the optimized structures, the lowest 50 singlet–singlet excitation states were computed using time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) at the PBE031/6-31+G(d)/LANL2DZ level. The PBE0 hybrid functional has been proved to be reliable for simulating the absorption spectra of POM-based dyes in our previous work.32 An electric field with 5 × 10−4 a.u. strength (electric field strength, 1 a.u. = 5.142 × 109 V cm−1) parallel to the X, Y, and Z axis was applied on the POM-based dye. In addition, three different electric fields of 10, 15 and 20 × 10−4 a.u. electric field strengths parallel to the X axis were also applied. The solvent effect of ethyl acetate was taken into account based on the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM).33 In addition, the structures of dyes adsorbed on (TiO2)9 clusters through the bidentate binding mode34 were analyzed, for which the reliability was proved by Sánchez-de-Armas and Sanz et al.35 The excitation properties of the dye–TiO2 system were calculated at the PBE0/6-31+G(d)/LANL2DZ level.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Molecular structures
In this work, we selected naphthylimido-substituted hexamolybdate [Mo6O18(N-1-C10H6-2-CH3)]2− synthesized by Wei and co-workers36 with a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π linker and a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor group as a model to detect the inner electric field effect on the performance of DSSCs. The dye was constructed and is shown in Fig. 1.

The electric field is produced due to the accumulation of electrons in the electrode of the DSSC, and one of the most important factors is the directional effect of the inner electric field. One direction of the electric field is defined as the vector pointing from the electron donor to the electron acceptor of the dye, namely, the directional electric field is parallel to the X axis in the present work. The plane of the organic groups is located in the X–Y plane, and the Z axis is perpendicular to the plane.
3.2. Electronic structures
There is no doubt that the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of a dye under different electric fields provide better understanding of the electronic properties since they play a crucial role in determining the electronic excitations and transition characteristics.37 As an ideal dye for DSSCs, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level should be higher than the CB level of TiO2 (−4.00 eV), and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the dye should be lower than the redox potential energy of I−/I3− (−4.60 eV).38 This is not only to ensure efficient electron injection from the excited dye into TiO2, but also to guarantee efficient dye regeneration where the excited dye obtains an electron from I−/I3−. As shown in Fig. 2 and 3, the LUMO energy levels for the dye under different electric fields are higher than −4.00 eV, and the HOMO energy levels are lower than −4.60 eV, showing that the energy levels of the dye in off-field and on-field conditions are satisfactory in terms of energy level matching.

 Fig. 3  Frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the studied dye under different electric field strengths. 
Compared to the off-field condition, the HOMO energies increase and the LUMO energies decrease when electric fields are applied on the dye along the +X axis, resulting in a smaller HOMO–LUMO (H–L) gap, which means lower energy needed for dye excitation. In this way, the unnecessary energy loss can be reduced, thus improving the ability to utilize long wavelength light. On the contrary, the H–L gap increases due to the similar HOMO energy and the slightly increased LUMO energy compared to that of the off-field condition when the electric field is applied on the dye along the −X axis, which is unfavorable for improving the light harvesting efficiency in DSSCs. In addition, the FMO energy levels are similar to the off-field condition when the electric fields act on the ±Y axis and ±Z axis.
Taking into account the different electric field strengths, the HOMO energies gradually increase and the LUMO energies gradually decrease with increasing electric field strength; thus, the H–L gaps decrease in the order of 2.50 eV (field = 0) > 2.26 eV (field = 5) > 2.02 eV (field = 10) > 1.75 eV (field = 15) > 1.56 eV (field = 20). In addition, the L+1, L+2 and L+3 energies are hardly influenced by the applied electric fields resulting from the similar orbital distributions (Fig. S1, ESI†). For H−1, the trends of orbital energies gradually reduce with the increasing electric field strengths, while the orbital energies of H−2 and H−3 gradually increase.
The FMO distributions of the studied dye under different electric fields are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). At the same time, the molecular orbital compositions of the studied dye are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). It can be seen that the FMO distributions of the dye under electric fields along the ±Y axis are similar to that of the dye without an electric field, in which the HOMOs are dominated by the organic moieties, while the LUMOs mainly localize on the POM clusters, π linkers and acceptor groups. When the electric fields are acting on the +X and ±Z axis, the HOMOs localize on the donor groups and the LUMOs localize on the POM clusters, π linkers and acceptor groups, while the HOMO and LUMO delocalize over the POM cluster, π linker and acceptor group when the electric field is acting on the −X axis. Though the FMO distributions are complicated when the dye works under different electric field directions, the dye exhibits apparent push–pull character except for the electric field acting on the −X axis condition, predicting that the maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) of the dye under +X, ±Y and ±Z axis electric field directions could be similar to that of the off-field condition, while λmax will change when the electric field is acting on the −X axis. Meanwhile, the HOMOs of the studied dye under different electric field strengths mainly localize on the electron donor groups, and the LUMOs are dominated by the POM clusters, π linkers and electron acceptor moieties.
3.3. Absorption spectra
It is significant to examine the absorption property of the dye under different electric fields since it plays the most important role in affecting the performance of the cell. The simulated absorption spectra of the studied dye with different electric field directions are shown in Fig. 4, and the calculated excitation energies (Ev), λmax, oscillator strengths (f) and major assignments are listed in Table 1. The absorption spectra of the studied dye under different electric field directions are divided into two absorption ranges: peaks located in the range of 350–450 nm and 450–600 nm, respectively. For the dye without an induced electric field, the excitations of HOMO → LUMO (62%) and H−1 → LUMO (35%) contribute to the maximum absorption at 526 nm, while the second strong absorption at 412 nm mainly proceeds through HOMO → L+5 (83%). When the electric field is acting on the +X axis, the dye exhibits a similar λmax (525 nm) and a red-shifted second strong absorption (423 nm), while the absorption spectrum of the studied dye blue shifts when the electric field is acting on the −X axis. This is consistent with the conclusion obtained from the analysis of the electronic structures. Clearly, the absorption of the dye under the electric field along the +X axis is favorable for harvesting sunlight, thus enhancing the performance of DSSCs. At the same time, the positions of the absorption peaks for the dye under the electric fields along the Y and Z axis are similar to those in the absence of an electric field due to the zero effect on electron transfer.37 It is concluded that the electric fields along the Y and Z axis have a slight effect on the absorption property of the studied dye. In addition, the excitation energies Ev are around 2.36 eV when the dye works under different electric field directions, and the dye possesses the largest Ev (2.40 eV) when the electric field acts along the −X axis due to the largest H–L gap, resulting from the largest LUMO energy.

As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2, the simulated absorption spectra of the dye under different electric field strengths reveal that λmax red-shifts from 525 nm to 563 nm with the enhancement of the electric field strength from 5 to 20 × 10−4 a.u., for which the electron transitions mainly originate from the H−1 → L transition. There is an evident spatial overlap between H−1 and the LUMO (Fig. S3, ESI†), and the transition between these two orbitals is spatially permissible, leading to an obvious absorption peak. Furthermore, Ev gradually decreases with increasing electric field strength (from 5 to 20 × 10−4 a.u.), owing to the gradually increasing HOMO energies and decreasing LUMO energies. The oscillator strengths of the dye have an increasing trend with increasing electric field strength from 5 to 20 × 10−4 a.u., resulting from the fact that the electric field could contribute to a higher distribution overlap of the electron cloud involved in the molecular orbital.

3.4. Intramolecular charge transfer analysis
As we all know, it is crucial that the electron in a dye is transferred from the electron donor to the electron acceptor upon excitation. Compositions of donor, POM, π linker and acceptor fragments in hole and electron, as well as the hole–electron overlap in various fragment spaces, can be plotted as a heat map, so that their distribution character can be very vividly exhibited as the heat map scale. The heat map of the studied dye in the off-field condition is depicted in Fig. 6; it can be seen that the hole mainly distributes on the electron donor group, while the electron mainly localizes on POM, indicating that the ICT is attributed to the electron transfer from the donor group to the POM cluster, which is beneficial for efficient electron injection. When electric fields are acted on +X, ±Y and ±Z axis, the ICT processes are similar to the off-field condition, while the electric field along with −X axis has adverse effect on electron injection due to the large overlap between hole and electron on π linker (Fig. S4, ESI†). Furthermore, the dye has more obvious electron–hole separation as the electric field strength increases.
 Fig. 6  The heat map of the studied dye in the off-field condition. 
The ICT process occurs when light absorption induces an electronic transfer from the electron donor to the electron acceptor, which affects the generation of charge separated states. Hence, the beneficial ICT is a crucial factor to obtain high photovoltaic conversion efficiency. In order to analyze the extent of ICT, the key parameters were calculated by the Multiwfn program39 (details are shown in the ESI†) and the results are presented in Fig. 7. It is apparent that the transferred charges qCT increase as follows: 0.42 a.u. (field = X − 5) < 0.51 a.u. (field = Z − 5) < 0.56 a.u. (field = Y − 5) = 0.56 a.u. (field = Z + 5) < 0.81 a.u. (field = 0) < 1.02 a.u. (field = Y + 5) < 1.06 a.u. (field = X + 5). It is the same with the order of the charge transfer distance dCT, and the t values follow the order −3.77 Å (field = Y − 5) < −3.50 Å (field = X − 5) < −3.36 Å (field = Z − 5) < −2.57 Å (field = Z + 5) < −1.13 Å (field = 0) < −0.48 Å (field = Y + 5) < −0.41 Å (field = X + 5), showing that the inner electric fields along the X + 5 and Y + 5 axis have a positive effect on the ICT properties. Especially, the dye under the electric field along the X + 5 axis possesses the largest qCT (1.06 a.u.) and dCT (3.56 Å) combined with the largest t value (−0.41 Å), enhancing the electronic coupling between the dye and semiconductor surface, which can lead to quick electron injection. When the electric field is acting on the X − 5 axis, the small qCT and dCT resulting from the large overlap between the hole and electron are unfavorable for the ICT process. In addition, it can be found in Fig. S5 (ESI†) that the qCT, dCT and t values generally become smaller as the electric field strength increases.

3.5. Factors influencing JSC
According to eqn (S2) and (S3) in the ESI,† a large light harvesting efficiency LHE, and negative electron injection driving force ΔGinj and regeneration driving force ΔGreg can guarantee high short-circuit photocurrent density JSC. The calculated LHE values, oxidation potential of the ground state dye Edye, oxidation potential of the excited state dye , ΔGinj and ΔGreg of the studied dye under different electric fields were computed and are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The studied dye with or without electric fields has negative ΔGreg, implying that it has enough driving force to complete the sensitizer regeneration process. At the same time, the negative ΔGinj can guarantee sufficient driving force for efficient electron injection. The studied dye under electric fields along the ±X axis directions shows larger ΔGinj values, while the electric fields acting on the ±Y and ±Z axis have little effect on the ΔGinj values. In addition, the increase of the ΔGinj values with increasing electric field strength contributes to the fast charge transport process. In addition, the LHE values for the studied dye with or without electric fields are close to 1, which can lead to high JSC.

3.6. Absorption spectra of the dye–TiO2 system
A model containing a proper TiO2 substrate and the dye was constructed to elucidate the effect of the electric field on the absorption spectrum of the dye–TiO2 system, which determines the overall efficiency of DSSCs. Except the electric field along the −X axis direction, the FMO distributions of the dye–TiO2 system under different electric fields are similar in that the HOMOs delocalize over the dye and the LUMOs localize on TiO2 (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†), contributing to the electron injection from the dye to TiO2. The simulated absorption spectra of dye–TiO2 with different electric fields are shown in Fig. 8 and 9, and the calculated Ev, λmax, and f and major assignments are listed in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†). It can be found that λmax of dye–TiO2 is red-shifted compared to that of the dye in the same electric field conditions. The same as the dye, the absorption of the dye–TiO2 system with an electric field acting on the +X axis red shifts relative to that of the off-field condition, while the absorption spectrum of dye–TiO2 blue shifts with an electric field along the −X axis. The λmax values of dye–TiO2 with electric fields along the +Y, −Y, +Z, and −Z axes are 550, 550, 548, and 553 nm, respectively, which are similar to that of the dye–TiO2 system without an electric field. At the same time, the absorption spectra of dye–TiO2 with different electric field strengths are divided into two absorption ranges, except the 20 × 10−4 a.u. electric field condition. The absorption spectrum of the dye–TiO2 system with the 5 × 10−4 a.u. electric field presents λmax at 560 nm, and λmax further red-shifts with increased electric field strength, which is helpful for enhancing the conversation efficiency of DSSCs.

3.7. Interfacial electron transfer analysis
IET analysis from the dye to the semiconductor under different electric field conditions is of great importance for understanding the performance of DSSCs, which is affected by the electronic coupling between the excited state dye and TiO2. The IET process can be described as: the charge density is populated in the POM-based dye firstly, and then it spreads to the TiO2. Finally, the initial population in the dye decays to some extent and reaches an equilibrium state. In order to investigate the electron injection dynamic processes under different electric fields, the time-dependent survival probability (TDSP) curves for the dye–TiO2 system are shown in Fig. 10 and 11.
 Fig. 10  The time-dependent survival probability curves for electron injection of the dye–TiO2 system under different electric field directions. 
 Fig. 11  The time-dependent survival probability curves for electron injection of the dye–TiO2 system under different electric field strengths. 
As can be seen from Fig. 10, the TDSP curves are clearly affected by the different directions of the electric field. In the case of the dye without an electric field, the survival probability in the dye decays to about 40% at 50 fs, and the electrons are almost completely injected after 250 fs, while it will take a longer time with the +X axis and −Y axis electric field. Compared to the case without an electric field, the electron injection rate is improved when the electric field acts on the −X axis; the survival probability in the dye decays to about 20% at 50 fs and the electrons are almost completely injected after 200 fs. The electron injection rate was further accelerated when the electric fields acted along the +Y axis and ±Z axis, meaning that the electric fields are favorable for the electron injection process when they act in these directions. It is worth noting that the electron injection rate gradually improves with increasing electric field strength.
4. Conclusions
A theoretical investigation on a POM-based dye with a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor group under different electric fields was performed to analyze the influence of the inner electric field on the performance of DSSCs. Apart from the electronic properties, the absorption spectra and the ICT parameters, JSC and the IET process as major factors affecting the performance of DSSCs have been taken into consideration. The results indicate that the inner electric field is a crucial factor affecting the absorption spectra and the electron transport properties in DSSCs. The electric field is positive for the absorption spectra and ICT parameters for the POM-based dye when the electric field acts on the +X axis. When the electric field is applied along the −X axis, the overall efficiency is reduced due to the negative effect on the absorption spectra and electron transfer process. In addition, the electric field has a slight effect on the performance of DSSCs when the electric field is applied along the Y and Z axis. At the same time, the conversion efficiencies are further improved with increasing electric field, indicating that the POM-based dye has self-promoting properties. The generated inner electric field improves the light harvesting properties when a POM-based dye is applied in DSSCs, which generates stronger electric field strengths, improving the performance of DSSCs. The present results allow us to establish the relationship between the electric field and efficiency required for further understanding of the operation mechanism of DSSCs.
