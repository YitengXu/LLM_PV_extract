    , Accepted 6th December 2017First published on 7th December 2017AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently the most exciting solar photovoltaic technologies for future deployment. A conventional PSC device structure typically employs a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron transport layer. However, the low electrical conductivity of TiO2 is an obstacle to PSC efficiency enhancement. In this paper, we report on the conductivity enhancement of TiO2 by tantalum (Ta) doping and its effect on improving the device performance. In contrast to commonly used mesoporous TiO2, our work used a planar PSC device structure based on a compact TiO2 layer with the device structure being: FTO/compact-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT/Ag. Photovoltaic measurements show that Ta doping of compact TiO2 results in an improvement in the fill factor (FF) of the devices due to a decrease in the series resistance (Rs), attributed to improved charge transport and an increase in the shunt resistance (Rsh), due to reduced leakage paths. These changes were examined using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) which indicated that the Fermi level of TiO2 shifts downward upon Ta doping providing driving force for the electron transfer from the perovskite LUMO to the TiO2 conduction band resulting in higher current density. Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy analysis of the devices suggests a decrease in the charge transfer resistance with Ta-doping and an increase in Rsh due to the higher recombination resistance of doped films. PSC devices with Ta doping of 3.0% led to a 40% improvement in the overall efficiency as compared to un-doped TiO2 with the best device showing a power conversion efficiency of ca. 9.94%.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as an exciting solar photovoltaic technology due to high absorption coefficient of perovskite compounds, high charge-carrier mobility, long exciton diffusion length and a tunable band gap which allows the PSCs to offer a balance between high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and potentially low cost fabrication.1–6 The reported PCE of the perovskite based solar cells has rapidly increased from 3.9% in 20097 to 22.1% in 2017,8 indicating significant progress within a short period of time. The most common hole transport layers (HTLs) used in regular structures are spiro-OMeTAD (N2,N2,N2′,N2′,N7,N7,N7′,N7′-octakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetramine), P3HT (poly-3-hexylthiophene) and PTAA (poly(triaryl amine)). To further enhance the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD, additives such as Li-TFSI (bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt) and t-BP (4-tert-butylpyridine) are commonly used. Strategies such as use of C60 as an electron transport layer with spiro-OMeTAD have achieved a PCE of 19.1% and another group by use of a triple cation perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD as a HTL has got a PCE of 21.1%.9,10 Researchers have also sought to replace the expensive as well as moisture sensitive hole transporting layer of spiro-OMeTAD by a conjugated polymer P3HT, due to its hydrophobic nature and could prevent moisture from reaching the perovskite layer, thus rendering higher atmospheric stability. Guo et al. achieved a PCE of 12.4% with optimum doping of Li-TFSI and D-TBP (2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine) in P3HT. Although a hygroscopic nature of Li and a corrosive nature of the pyridine derivative have been found to deteriorate the perovskite. When these additives are used with P3HT, the degradation of the perovskite layer is reduced compared to cases in which spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA are employed.11
The emergence of perovskite materials with ambipolar properties has provided the platform for the development of planar heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite solar cells.12 In the PHJ perovskite, use of mesoporous TiO2 can be avoided leading to simpler and low thermal budget processing. Here, characteristics of an electron transport layer (ETL) are critical to PHJ perovskite solar cell performance due to the dual role of the ETL as electron transport as well as the hole blocking layer. In PHJ PSCs, different metal oxides have been used as ETLs. Researchers have used various materials as ETLs in PSCs such as ZnO, SiO2, and ZrO2.13 Liu et al. used a thin film of ZnO nanoparticles as an ETL in PSCs and achieved the efficiency of 15.7%.14 Tseng et al. achieved 15.9% efficiency of PSCs using a sputtered ZnO thin film as an ETL having a device structure as ITO/ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. It was found that the atmosphere of the sputtering chamber could tune the surface electronic properties (band structure) of the ZnO thin film resulting in the improved performance of the PSC.15 Recently, ultrathin SnO2 was prepared using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method and was utilized as an ETL in PSCs.16
TiO2 has emerged as a promising candidate due to its low cost and high chemical stability and hence is one of the most used ETLs for PSCs. Though, the charge transport properties such as conductivity of the TiO2 compact thin film are rather poor and need to be improved for efficient charge extraction. One of the simple and effective ways to improve the electrical and optical properties of TiO2 is its chemical doping using an appropriate ion. There are several methods reported for doping in TiO2 such as Li doping by the electrochemical method, yttrium doping using the hydrothermal method, etc.17,18 In the past, different dopants such as Y, Zn, Mg, and Nb have been used in a compact as well as mesoporous TiO2 layer and have resulted in the improved electron transport properties of the TiO2 layer; thereby improving the photovoltaic performance of PHJ PSC devices consisting of TiO2 as the ETL (doped or undoped), CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as an absorber and spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM.19–24 The improvements have been attributed to better energy level alignment leading to improved electron transport and hole blocking upon Zn doping,23 a positive shift in the flat-band potential and increased conductivity upon Nb doping.21 Recently, in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a group V element Ta was used to dope TiO2 (Ta–TiO2) electron transport layers resulting in an enhanced photovoltaic performance.25,26 In addition to PCE improvements, there are reports on reduced hysteresis too e.g. in devices using Li-doped compact TiO2 layers.27
Among various ions used for doping in TiO2, tantalum (Ta) appears as a good choice as the Ta5+ ion has an ionic radius of 0.64 Å which is comparable to Ti4+ (0.61 Å), hence it can substitute Ti4+ sites in the TiO2 framework without issues such as strain or formation of secondary phases. It is shown to work better than Nb, another group V element28 and has a negative formation energy and superior thermodynamic stability over N-doped TiO2.29 Although Ta doping results in an enhancement in current density of the devices, one study attributed it to the positive shift in the flat-band potential25 while another report showed negligible shift in the flat-band potential.30 However, most of the studies related to doping in TiO2 are on devices consisting of spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL while TiO2 has been used in mesoporous structures. Therefore, there is a need to understand the role of Ta doping in compact TiO2 layers on PSC device performance along with the use of cheaper and environmentally stable HTLs i.e. P3HT. Also, there exists a trade-off between time and efficiency when one uses a planar structure with P3HT as the HTL. In this manuscript, we present our results on a compact Ta doped TiO2 (Ta–TiO2) layer as an ETL in perovskite solar cells in a conventional planar perovskite structure of FTO/compact-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT/Ag with a device structure incorporating P3HT as the HTL instead of routinely used spiro-OMeTAD. The literature reports various methods for the preparation of the TiO2 film such as sol–gel, ALD, electrochemical deposition and DC-magnetron sputtering.31 We have used the sol–gel method for the preparation of the compact TiO2 layer. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of different Ta–TiO2 layers with varying stoichiometry (1.0–5.0 mol% doping) on device performance by conducting detailed electrical, optical and morphological characterization e.g. electrical conductivity, absorption spectra, Fermi level and surface morphology. Charge carrier dynamic studies on Ta–TiO2 thin films using photoluminescence (PL) and KPFM show that a shift in the Fermi level along with the improved conductivity of Ta–TiO2 results in a larger driving force for electron transport and thus enhance the short circuit current and fill factor of the devices rendering a maximum PCE of 9.94%.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials
Methylamine solution (CH3NH2, 40 wt% in absolute ethanol), hydroiodic acid (HI, 57% in water), lead acetate (99.999 trace metal basis) (Pb(OAc)2), anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF), poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), tantalum(V) ethoxide, and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of methylammonium iodide
Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 10 mL HI was added dropwise while stirring to 24 mL methylamine solution in 100 mL of ethanol at room temperature. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was obtained by concentrating the reaction mixture in a vacuum. The white crystals obtained were washed three times in diethyl ether and dried overnight in a vacuum oven.32
2.3 Fabrication of solar cell devices
FTO layers on glass substrates were patterned by etching with the Zn powder and 2 M HCl followed by cleaning with soap and then ultrasonication in DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol respectively for 10 min with nitrogen blow drying after each step. The cleaned substrates were UV-ozone treated for 15 min having pretreatment of UV only for 10 min and post treatment of oxygen only for 10 min. For compact TiO2 layer, solution was prepared by dissolving titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in ethanol in a 1:9 ratio with mixing of tantalum(V) ethoxide in titanium precursor solution in 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 mol% for the doped films. The solution was spin coated on the UV-ozone treated substrates at 3000 rpm for 1 min followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min on a hot plate and at 500 °C for 30 min in a muffle furnace in air resulting in ∼40 nm thin compact TiO2 films. The compact TiO2 layer coated substrates were transferred to the glove box after cooling to room temperature. For depositing perovskite layers, a solution was prepared by mixing methyl ammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and Pb(OAc)2 in a 3:1 ratio in DMF to get a 40 wt% solution which was kept in a glove box for 2 h at 70 °C. The filtered perovskite solution was spin coated on the TiO2 coated substrates at 2000 rpm for 1 min followed by bench drying for 5 min leading to the formation of a light brownish film and then maintained at 100 °C for 10 min rendering the film to become dark brownish. A thickness of the final perovskite film was measured to be ca. 250 nm. Subsequently, P3HT solution (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s having a thickness of ∼60 nm, followed by thermal evaporation of an 80 nm thin Ag layer at 0.5 Å s−1 to form the top electrodes.
2.4 Thin film and device characterization
The conductivity of compact undoped TiO2 and Ta–TiO2 films was measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter using two probe methods on the device structure of FTO/TiO2/Au. For structural analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the films was conducted on an X'Pert Pro (PANanalytical) diffractometer. Chemical states were examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a PHI 5000 (Versa Probe II, FEI Inc) while XPSPEAK 4.1 software was used for analysing the spectra. A Cary 7000 spectrophotometer (Agilent technologies) was used for absorbance measurements. A Raman spectrometer (WiTec, using laser light of λ = 532 nm) was used for Raman studies. Morphological studies of the films were conducted on an Asylum MFP-3D AFM and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Quanta 200, Zeiss). The surface potential was measured using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) using the Asylum MFP-3D AFM. Photovoltaic device characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under dark and simulated solar light (AM1.5G) using a Newport solar simulator. A Bruker DektakXT stylus profilometer was used for measuring the film thickness. Photoluminescence (PL) of the samples was measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Newport IQE200 system. Impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab 302N, Metrohm, the Netherlands).
3. Results and discussion
Initially, we fabricated a 250 nm perovskite thin film on the FTO/TiO2 substrate to study the formation of the perovskite film and its grain structure. Fig. S1† shows the XRD pattern, absorbance data and morphology of the perovskite film. The film exhibited a single perovskite phase structure with good surface coverage. The absorbance spectra of the film showed a broad range of absorbance from 400 to 760 nm suggesting that the perovskite film has good absorption in the visible region. Fig. S1(d)† shows the morphology of the pinhole free compact TiO2 film.
3.1 Structural, morphological and optical characteristics of Ta-doped TiO2 films

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of pristine TiO2 and Ta–TiO2 films having a different mol% of Ta. It can be deduced from the figure that all the samples possess an anatase phase (ICDD file no. 01-084-1285). No peak for elemental Ta or Ta2O5 could be detected in the XRD plots, suggesting that Ta is doped uniformly in the crystal lattice of TiO2. Due to the lower effective mass of electrons in the anatase phase, anatase TiO2 shows higher electrical conductivity as compared to the rutile phase and hence is the desirable phase. However, there is also significant peak broadening upon Ta doping as the intensity of (101) reflection as well as of other peaks decreases with the increase in Ta doping and the peaks shift towards the smaller 2θ as shown in Fig. 1(b). The latter is because the ionic radius of Ta5+ (0.64 Å) is greater than that of Ti4+ (0.61Å).33 As suggested by the morphological studies (shown later), the peak broadening is not associated with the decrease in the grain size and hence it could perhaps be related to decreased crystallinity of the films overall.

While XRD data provided broad and average information over a large sampling volume, Raman spectra can provide information at much smaller length scales and is sensitive to the crystallinity. The Raman spectra of undoped TiO2 and 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 mol% of the Ta doped samples are shown in Fig. 2(a). The well assigned Raman peaks at 144, 397, 521 and 639 cm−1 are observed in all the samples. Theses peaks are attributed to the vibration modes of Eg1, B1g, A1g + B1g and Eg3, respectively and thus confirm the presence of the anatase phase of TiO2. The weak peak of the anatase phase at 194 cm−1 of Eg2 can also be noticed. In the rutile phase, four Raman peaks are observed due to oxygen atom vibrations which do not involve Ti atoms. However, in the anatase phase, six active Raman vibrations are observed. Thus, Raman spectra confirm the presence of the anatase phase in the compact TiO2 layer, which is in agreement with the XRD results. Furthermore, except B1g which shows only Ti-atom vibration, all others are a mixture of both O-atom and Ti-atom motions in the anatase phase.34Fig. 2(b) shows the normalized Eg1 anatase vibration signal of the pure TiO2 and doped samples. The Raman shift as well as the increment of full width half maxima (FWHM) is observed in the doped films. The Eg peak in Raman spectra represents the symmetric stretching vibration of O–Ti–O in TiO2. If doping occurs at the substitutional position on the Ti4+, the Ti–O–Ti bond gets disturbed and new Ta–O–Ti or Ta–O–Ta bonds are formed. The Raman active mode is affected due to this new Ta–O bond which formed in place of the Ti–O bond and results in shifting and widening of peaks.35 Thus, both the Raman shift to a higher wavenumber and widening of peaks suggest incorporation of Ta doping in the TiO2 layer.29

The absorption spectra of pristine TiO2 and various Ta-doped TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 3(a). The absorption spectra of doped thin films show the red shift upon Ta doping as suggested by the band gap calculations of pure TiO2 and doped TiO2 thin films, calculated using Tauc plots (Fig. 3(b)). The band gap of various tantalum doped compact TiO2 films decreased with the increase of Ta doping percentage. The calculated value for pristine TiO2 was 3.59 eV and remains nearly the same for 1.0% Ta–TiO2 film at ∼3.58 eV. At increased doping levels, the band gap decreased from 3.55 eV (3.0 mol% Ta–TiO2) to 3.47 eV (5.0 mol% Ta–TiO2), in agreement with the previously reported values.36

The interface between the active layer and the bottom electrode has an important effect on the device performance. Therefore, it is critical to examine the roughness of the TiO2 layer. Fig. 4 shows the AFM images for the surface of pure TiO2 and tantalum doped thin films deposited on the FTO coated glass substrate showing dense and compact grains in all the thin films. However, the RMS roughness of the film slightly increases from 11.3 nm (pure TiO2) to 15.5 nm (5.0 mol% Ta–TiO2) upon increase in Ta doping.

The surface roughness of the tantalum doped TiO2 compact layer could play a significant role in electron transport as it affects the contact area between the perovskite active layers and Ta doped TiO2 compact layer. Higher roughness could lead to an increase in the contact area between the active layer and the electron transport layer leading to improved charge transportation.37,38 However, the doping level beyond 3.0% results in other problems such as formation of voids even though 5.0% Ta–TiO2 films show highest RMS roughness, resulting in lower conductivity as well as poor charge extraction as compared to 3.0 mol% doped thin films as shown in subsequent sections.
To confirm the tantalum doping in the TiO2 thin films, XPS analysis was performed to study the electronic structure and chemical changes due to Ta doping. Fig. 5(a) shows the full XPS spectra of pure TiO2 and tantalum doped TiO2 thin films. The obtained spectra illustrate that the pure TiO2 film shows the presence of only Ti and O peaks whereas the doped thin film spectra consist of peaks from Ti, O and Ta elements. Fig. 5(b) shows the characteristics binding energy peaks of Ta 4f at 26.4 eV and 28.3 eV for 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively. An increase in Ta amount is observed for 5.0 mol% Ta–TiO2 compared to the 3.0 mol% Ta–TiO2 sample while Ta is absent in the pristine TiO2 sample (Fig. 5(c)). The presence of Ta5+ in the doped thin film confirms the doping of Ta in the pristine TiO2 thin film.25,39,40 Table S1† contains atomic% of various elements for undoped TiO2 and Ta–TiO2 thin film samples which shows that Ta content increases with an increase in the Ta doping. The high resolution XPS spectrum of Ti in the undoped TiO2 sample shows 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 characteristic peaks at binding energies of 459.1 eV and 464.8 eV, respectively corresponding to the Ti4+ oxidation state (Fig. 5(d)). However, a detectable peak at lower binding energy is observed than the peak appeared at 459 eV for the 3.0 mol% Ta–TiO2 sample (Fig. 5(e)). This additional peak at 457 eV appears after the Ta doping which refers to the Ti3+ oxidation state due to the incorporation of Ta5+ ions within the crystal structure.41–43

To find out the role of Ta doping in the TiO2 work function, which could have an influence on the migration of electrons to the cathode, we conducted Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) of the undoped and 3.0 mol% Ta–TiO2 film. KPFM is an atomic force microscopy technique which measures the distributed contact potential difference (CPD) between the tip and the sample, through eqn (1), which can be used to assess the surface potential.44 (1)
Here, e is the electronic charge and ϕtip and ϕsample are the work functions of the tip and the sample, respectively. The scanned area of 5 μm × 5 μm was taken for KPFM imaging. As Fig. 6 shows, the Ta-doped TiO2 film showed the CPD value of −39 mV in comparison to the undoped TiO2 film having the CPD value of 89 mV. Thus a decrease of ∼128 mV of CPD could be manifested in the shift of the Fermi level of the doped film. The ϕtip has a value of 5.0 eV, thus the Fermi level of the sample can be calculated as ϕsample = ϕtip − eVCPD.45 The calculated value for undoped films was 4.9 eV. For 3.0% Ta–TiO2, the value was 5.04 eV. The lower edge of the conduction band (CB) in TiO2 consists of Ti4+ 3d bands and upper edge of the valance band (VB) is made of O2− 2p bands. As it is known that the n- or p-type dopant affects the CB or VB of materials but due to the defect ridden nature in TiO2, the doping affects the trap states. The doping can either decrease the deep trap density which can shift the CB and Fermi level upward. In this case, Voc increased but Jsc decreased due to a decrease in driving force for electron injection. When doping contributes to the formation of deep traps, a reverse trend is generally observed.46 In our case, due to Ta doping the CB and Fermi level shift downward which is in agreement with the reports on Ta doped films in DSSCs.25 This change in the Fermi level can result in large gap between the conduction band of TiO2 and the perovskite LUMO (Fig. 6(c)) which could improve electron injection as suggested by device characterization.46

Furthermore, to analyse whether the Ta-doped TiO2 films affect the carrier recombination or extraction at the interface, we carried out the photoluminescence measurements on the doped and undoped TiO2 films. Fig. 7 shows the steady state photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite on pure TiO2 and different mol% doped TiO2 thin films deposited on FTO glass. From the figure, it is clear that as we doped tantalum in TiO2 films, the photoluminescence of perovskite films gets quenched as evident from the decrease in the intensity of the PL peak with increasing Ta doping in TiO2 thin films with 3.0 mol% Ta doped thin films showing maximum PL quenching due to the highest conductivity of the doped thin films. This suggests that Ta doping in pure TiO2 films could be responsible for the enhanced rate of photo-generated charge carrier extraction at the compact layer and perovskite interface.

3.2 Electrical characterization of undoped and Ta-doped TiO2 films
One of the effects of Ta doping on TiO2 is to modify its electrical conductivity via promotion of the anatase phase. To analyse this variation upon Ta doping into TiO2 layer, we measured the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the device structure FTO/Ta doped TiO2 (0–5.0 mol%)/Au and the results are shown in Fig. 8. The dc conductivity (σ0) of the samples is calculated using eqn (2) I = σ0AL−1V(2)where A (9.0 mm2) is the area of the devices and L (∼68 nm) is the thickness of thin films. The conductivity of pure TiO2 was measured from eqn (2) to be 0.73 ± 0.13 × 10−3 mS cm−1. With 1.0% Ta–TiO2 the conductivity increased to 1.64 ± 0.1 × 10−3 mS cm−1. For 3.0% doping the calculated conductivity was 3.29 ± 0.18 × 10−3 mS cm−1. The conductivity showed one order increment from pure TiO2 (0.0 mol%) to 3.0 mol% Ta doping. However, at higher molar concentration (5.0 mol%), conductivity decreased to 2.68 ± 0.5 × 10−3 mS cm−1. It may be due to the formation of pinholes or higher roughness in the doped films.

3.3 Integration into perovskite solar cells and photovoltaic performance
The perovskite devices were fabricated using the device structure FTO/compact-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT/Ag, as shown in Fig. 9(a), where, the TiO2 layer was either in undoped or Ta-doped form. As the photovoltaic characteristics are shown in Table 1, the average power conversion efficiency of the devices with un-doped TiO2 films was 4.89% in the forward sweep direction with Voc ∼0.85 V, Jsc ∼18.4 mA cm−2, FF ∼0.32. Generally, researchers have used spiro-OMeTAD with Li-TFSI and tBP as a dopant and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (i.e. a mixture of methyl ammonium lead iodide and chloride) as the active layer. Having incorporated mesoporous TiO2 they have achieved high efficiency. In this device, we have used the planar structure with no doping in P3HT which is the reason behind comparatively low efficiency of the pristine device. However, the performance is comparable with the literature where researchers have used P3HT as the HTL having the planar structure.47 Furthermore, poor fill factor is mainly attributed to higher series resistance, as both compact TiO2 and undoped P3HT have low conductivity leading to a high series resistance of 48 Ω cm2. With the doping of 1.0 mol% Ta in compact TiO2, due to the increase in conductivity, the series resistance decreases to 29 Ω cm2, hence a slight increase in Jsc can be noticed. But at the same time, Voc decreases slightly from 0.85 V to 0.83 V which neutralises the enhancement in efficiency. With 3.0 mol% Ta–TiO2 doping, the efficiency increases to 6.81% due to the increase in Jsc (20.6 mA cm−2) and FF (0.41) although there was again a little decrease in Voc from 0.85 V to 0.83 V compared to undoped TiO2. These trends can be explained by the fact that Ta doping causes the Fermi level as well as the conduction band to shift downward. As Voc is defined as the difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the HTM, shifting of the Fermi level leads to a decreased Voc, as also suggested by the KPFM image in Fig. 6. However, at the same time due to larger difference between the perovskite LUMO and TiO2 conduction band, electron injection and hence Jsc increases.46 These observations are in agreement with the previous data on DSSCs using Ta doped TiO2.39 In our case, the best device was with 3.0% tantalum doping which exhibited a PCE of 9.24% with a Jsc of 21.13 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.90 and an FF of 0.49. For 5.0 mol% Ta doping, Voc further decreases to 0.75 as explained above and efficiency decreases. We also observe a decrease in the shunt resistance and an increase in series resistance for 5.0% doping, which can be correlated with the increase of roughness and voids in the film.48

The change in PCE and Jsc upon Ta doping of TiO2 is also in agreement with the changes in external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics, as shown in Fig. 9(b) where 3.0 mol% Ta–TiO2 devices show the best external quantum efficiency. Fig. 9(c) and (d) show the J–V curve of the undoped and doped (1.0–5.0%) device in (a) forward and (b) reverse sweep directions, respectively. A similar trend in the performance was also evident in the reverse sweep direction. The undoped device shows an average efficiency of 6.63% which increased to 8.17% for the 3.0 mol% Ta doped device (Table 1). It is interesting to note that Ta doping reduced the hysteresis in the J–V curves as forward and reverse sweep J–V characteristics show low difference. A small amount of hysteresis at high doping concentrations may be due to the ferroelectric hysteresis of perovskite materials or defects at the surface of these materials.49 The best device for 3.0 mol% in reverse sweep was 9.94% with an FF of 0.57 and a Jsc of 19.4 mA cm−2. Table S2† summarizes PCE data from recent literature having the planar device structure. The obtained efficiency for our devices is at par or more than the reported planar device structure having P3HT as the HTL.

Fig. 10(a) shows the J–V curve of the best device in forward and reverse scan directions. Since 3.0 mol% Ta–TiO2 devices has shown the best performance, the effect of Ta doping in TiO2 on charge transport was further analysed by impedance spectroscopy (IS). It was carried out in the dark with a bias of 0.6 V and a 5 mV AC signal was applied within the frequency range of 100 Hz to 100 kHz. Fig. 10(b) shows the Nyquist plots of undoped and 3.0 mol% Ta–TiO2 devices with the equivalent circuit (inset).50 The circuit consists of series resistance (Rs), parallel recombination resistance (Rrec) and constant phase element (CPE). The ohmic resistance is represented by Rs whereas Rrec is associated with the interface charge transport process. The non-ideal behaviour of a capacitor is associated with the CPE.51 The CPE values are 0.97 and 0.95 for undoped and 3.0% Ta doped samples, respectively indicating that the interface is not perfectly electrical.51 For the undoped device, Rs is 7.5 Ω cm2 whereas for the doped device, Rs reduces to 2.1 Ω cm2 due to the higher conductivity of the Ta doped film. Furthermore, recombination resistance is also increased from 88.9 Ω cm2 for the undoped device to 223 Ω cm2 for the doped device. This clearly confirms the effect of Ta doping on reducing the recombination losses in the devices with Ta-doped TiO2 films.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the positive effect of Ta doping in a compact TiO2 layer resulting in substantial improvement in device performance of spiro-OMeTAD free planar perovskite solar cells. Quenching of photoluminescence upon Ta doping suggests that the electrons could be extracted more efficiently from a perovskite film compared to an undoped TiO2 film. These effects resulted in an enhancement in FF due to the lower series resistance and higher shunt resistance in the devices. The device showed improved Jsc due to the lowering of the Fermi level of TiO2 shifted upon Ta doping and hence a larger gap between the conduction band and perovskite LUMO provides a greater driving force for electron transfer. Thus, enhancement in current density was observed with Ta doping. The best device was achieved for 3.0 mol% Ta doping of TiO2 with enhancement in efficiency to 9.24% in the forward scan direction and 9.94% in the reverse scan direction showing substantial improvement over the device with undoped TiO2.
