    , Accepted 11th July 2012First published on 30th July 2012AbstractSmall molecule BODIPY dyes incorporating conjugated substituents at the β sites have been synthesized. Solution processed inverted bulk heterojunction cells were fabricated from the blends of the dyes and PC71BM. The cells exhibited very high open-circuit voltages (>0.9 V) and a high conversion efficiency of 3.22% has been achieved.
Solar cells have attracted considerable interest, in both the academic and the commercial communities.1 Polymer solar cells with efficiencies higher than 7% have been achieved2 since the seminal report of Tang3 on organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). OPVs based on small molecules have also received attention in recent years. Efficiencies of >5.0% have been achieved for both vacuum-deposited layered OPV4 and spin-processed OPVs.5
Compared to polymers, small molecules have some advantages: easy synthesis and purification, and a greater tendency to assemble into ordered domains for facile carrier mobility. Our continual interest in small molecule OPVs6 prompted us to explore 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) dyes. In addition to chemical and photo-stability, BODIPY dyes normally exhibit strong absorption in the long wavelength region,7 which is desirable for using in solar cells. Moreover, the BODIPY core allows facile substitution at 3/5 (α site), 2/6 (β site), 8 (meso site) and 4 (boron site) positions (see Fig. S1, ESI†). There is growing interest in using BODIPY dyes as sensitizers for both DSSCs8 and OPVs.9 To the best of our knowledge, small molecule BODIPY dyes with conjugated substituents at the β sites have not been reported for OPVs. In this communication, new BODIPY dyes with β-conjugation will be reported, together with OPV cells of inverted structures based on these small molecules.
Structures of the BODIPY dyes are shown in Fig. 1. Scheme S1 and S2 (see ESI†) illustrate the synthetic protocol of the dyes. They were synthesized in 35–73% yields via a palladium catalyzed Stille coupling reaction10 of 4,4-difluoro-2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (I-PMBDP) with a stannyl derivative of arylamine or a Sonogashira coupling reaction11 of 2,6-diacetyl-4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (PMBDP′), prepared in a similar manner with meso-functionalized congeners,12 with appropriate arylamine-containing iodide.
 Fig. 1  Structure of BODIPY dyes. 
The absorption and emission spectra of the dyes in THF are shown in Fig. S2 (see ESI†), and the data are presented in Table 1. Characteristic absorption of the BODIPY core appears at 530–580 nm, and the peaks from 300 to 450 nm are attributed to the π–π* transition of the peripheral segments. Elongation of the conjugation length results in red shift of both bands due to the BODIPY core and the peripheries. The large twist angle (>50°, vide infra) between the BODIPY core and the thiophene ring (FBF and 2,7-CBC) may deteriorate the electronic interaction between the core and the peripheral segments. Insertion of an alkyne entity (t-FBF and t-2,7-CBC) releases the steric congestion and is beneficial to light harvesting. The luminescence data of all the compounds are presented in Table 1. The emission wavelength ranges from 656 to 679 nm. The large Stokes shift observed for FBF and 2,7-CBC suggests that the excited molecules have a more planar conformation before emission. The absorption spectra of the compounds in the film state are also shown in Fig. S2 (see ESI†). The red shifted and broadened spectra of the dyes in the film state compared to the absorption spectra in THF are attributed the solid state aggregations.

Density functional calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level were conducted. The frontier orbitals of the compounds and their corresponding energy states as well as the dihedral angles between two neighboring conjugated segments are included in Fig. S3–S5 (see ESI†). The LUMO orbitals mainly localize at the BODIPY core for all the dyes. In comparison, the HOMO orbitals largely populate on the peripheral segment at the β sites, with some contribution from the BODIPY core extending to two neighboring thienyl rings. TDDFT computations results (Table S1, see ESI†) confirm that the long wavelength absorption band (S0 → S1, mainly HOMO → LUMO) of the dyes indeed has a prominent charge transfer character. The significantly larger oscillator strength (f) of t-FBF and t-2,7-CBC than FBF and 2,7-CBC stems from a somewhat larger population of the HOMO at the core segment of the former, and is in conformity with the experimental results (Table 1). This observation witnesses the importance of incorporation of the alkyne entity.
The electrochemical data of the compounds are listed in Table 1. The cyclic voltammograms and differential pulse voltammograms of the compounds are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The first quasi-reversible two-electron oxidation wave is attributed to the oxidation of the arylamine. The lower oxidation potential of carbazole-based dyes is likely due to the capability of the electron-donating carbazolyl entity in stabilizing the diphenylamino radical cation. The slightly higher oxidation potential of t-FBF than FBF is attributed to the a somewhat electron-withdrawing nature of the alkyne entity. The second and the third quasi-reversible one-electron oxidation waves are attributed to the sequential oxidation of the BODIPY core. The HOMO energy level of these compounds was calculated to be −5.42 to −5.47 eV by comparison with ferrocene (−5.1 eV).13 This together with the HOMO–LUMO gap estimated from the absorption band edge were used to obtain the LUMO energy level (−3.39 to −3.48 eV). The atmospheric photoelectron spectrometer was also used to measure the energy level in the film state (Fig. S7, ESI†), and the data are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO levels of these dyes range from −5.20 to −5.43 eV, which are roughly consistent with those from electrochemical studies (Table 1).
OPVs with t-FBF:[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an active layer in normal and inverted geometry were first investigated. The inverted cell appeared to have a slightly better performance with higher fill factor (FF) and short current density (JSC) (see Fig. S8 and Table S2, ESI†). Moreover, etching of the ITO substrate by acidic PEDOT:PSS and facile oxidation of the low work function metal may cause problems with the conventional solution processed solar cells. The inverted structure is therefore applied in the following study. With such device configuration, the position of the cathode and anode is reversed, a buffer layer is used to provide a low work function contact for the ITO cathode, and the anode is a high work function metal oxide covered with a stable metal electrode.14 Bulk heterojunction inverted solar cells with the configuration of ITO (145 nm)/Ca (1 nm)/BODIPY dyes:[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (1:3, w/w)/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (100 nm) were thus fabricated and tested. The active layers of these devices were spin-cast from the chloroform solutions of the dyes. Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows the J–V characteristics of the cells and the corresponding external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) with t-FBF:PC71BM (1:3; w/w) as the active layer at different concentrations (therefore, different film thickness). Their device performance data are collected in Table S3 (ESI†). The film thickness of the active layer plays an important role in determining the electrical characteristics of the device.15 The open-circuit voltage (VOC) value increased only slightly by 0.02 V as the thickness decreased from 172 nm to 66 nm. However, the JSC and the PCE values of the devices varied significantly with thickness. The JSC values increased as the film thickness decreased, and the FF values also increased with decreasing film thickness. Possibly there is larger serial resistance caused by geminate and non-geminate recombinations in a thicker film, similar to that reported for the MEH-PPV–PC71BM (MEH-PPV = poly[2-methoxy-5(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene]) blend.15 Because of favorable JSC and FF values, the active layer film thickness of 66 nm (dye concentration = 15 mg mL−1) exhibited a higher EQE value in the range of 400–700 nm, and the best power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.22% as well. This represents the highest efficiency among OPVs based on BODIPY dyes. Remarkably, the efficiency is among the highest ever reported for solution-processed inverted OPVs based on small molecules.16
OPVs of different BODIPY dyes were then fabricated at a fixed dye concentration of 15 mg mL−1 for comparison. The performance data are listed in Table 2 and their J–V characteristics and EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 2. All cells exhibited VOC exceeding 0.90 V, and the VOC value for t-FBF reached 0.988 V, which is among the highest ever reported for small molecules-based OPVs.17 The better cell performance of the dyes with the alkyne entity than their congeners without the alkyne entity, i.e., t-FBF > FBF and t-2,7-CBC > 2,7-CBC, can be attributed to the higher photovoltages and photocurrents. This is in conformity with the order of light-harvesting efficiency and the order of the HOMO energy of the dyes (vide supra).

The space-charge limited current (SCLC) technique was used to measure the electron and hole mobilities in the blend film.18 The relevant data are collected in Table 2 and Fig. S10 and S11 (ESI†). Obviously, the blend films with more balanced electron and hole mobilities, t-FBF:PC71BM and t-2,7-CBC:PC71BM, exhibited better device performance than the other two. The blend with the highest ratio of electron–hole mobility, FBF:PC71BM, exhibited the lowest efficiency, and the lowest FF and JSC as well.
The morphologies of the BODIPY dye:PC71BM (1:3; w/w) blend film at the same concentration (15 mg mL−1) were also investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S12, ESI†). Due to the amorphous nature of small molecules and low-boiling point solvent (chloroform) fabrication, the films showed very smooth morphology with root-mean-square (rms) roughness (< 0.32 nm). Larger domains with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network were more prominent in the blend films of t-FBF:PC71BM and t-2,7-CBC:PC71BM. This provides further support of the better cell performance of t-FBF and t-2,7-CBC. However, even in t-FBF:PC71BM and t-2,7-CBC:PC71BM films, the domain sizes ranging from 5–40 nm are smaller than those observed in high-performance polymer blends.19 The lower FF (0.367–0.395) compared to polymer cells may be due to inferior charge transport pathways as a result of discontinuous domain structures through the active layers. This suggests that morphology optimization and hence, higher efficiency could possibly be realized through methods such as thermal and solvent-annealing.
In conclusion, new BODIPY dyes with conjugated arylamine at two β-sites have been synthesized. Prominent charge-transfer from the peripheral amine to the BODIPY core results in a large Stokes shift in the emission spectra of the compounds. Solution processed inverted bulk heterojunction cells were fabricated from the blends of the compound and PC71BM for the first time. These cells exhibited very high open-circuit voltages, and a high conversion efficiency of 3.22% has been achieved for inverted OPVs based on small molecules.
