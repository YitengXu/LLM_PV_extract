    , Accepted 16th October 2018First published on 17th October 2018AbstractSeveral side-chain-type AEMs have been synthesized for exploring the effect of the chemical architecture on the performance and degradation mechanism in the vanadium flow battery (VFB). The side-chain-type AEMs having PTA groups (PSf-c-PTA) showed higher area resistance (0.6 Ω cm2) but lower vanadium permeability than those with QA moieties (PSf-c-QA), probably due to the lower water uptake and low swelling ratio. This trade-off further led to the better performance of the single VFB with the PSf-c-PTA membrane (coulombic efficiency > 98%, energy efficiency = 84.3%) at a current density of 120 mA cm−2, while the energy efficiency was 75.5% for the cell with the Nafion 115 membrane under the same testing conditions. After the ex situ chemical stability testing of the prepared AEMs in 1.5 M VO2+/3 M H2SO4 at 40 °C for 30 days, the side-chain-type AEMs exhibited no obvious chemical degradation of polymer backbones as confirmed by NMR results. However, the control PSf-PTA membrane with the benzylethylethanaminium group underwent severe chemical degradation of both the polymer backbone and the cationic groups. These results suggest that separating the cationic groups from the polymer backbone could improve the chemical stability of AEMs in VFB. Moreover, in contrast to the ex situ stability tests, the chemically unstable PSf-PTA membrane displayed better cell performance with 60% of EE remaining after 1000 cycles, and the performance of the VFB with side-chain-type AEMs faded after only hundreds of cycles. Further characterization of the aged AEMs in the VFBs showed that mechanical degradation resulted from excessive swelling in the electrolyte solution, rather than chemical degradation, and was the dominant factor that influenced the durability of VFBs when using AEMs as the separator. This finding gives us new fundamental insights into the ex situ and in situ degradation mechanisms of AEMs for VFB application.
Introduction
Large-scale electrical energy storage plays a significant role in the integration of valuable intermittent renewable power sources into electrical supply grids such as solar and wind power sources.1–6 Among the different kinds of energy storage technologies, flow batteries are one of the most promising candidates for storing the electricity in chemical compounds and reversibly releasing the electricity according to demand,7,8 which in turn decouples energy and power due to their design flexibility.9,10 Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs), which use VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ redox couples as the catholyte and anolyte,11,12 have received significant attention for large-scale energy storage, because of their intrinsic advantages including high efficiency, long durability, and widespread availability.13–15
As one of the key components in VFBs, polymeric membranes generally separate the catholyte and anolyte and allow the transport of protons to complete the circuit.16–18 Considering the strong oxidative and acidic conditions in VFBs, an ideal membrane should possess high conductivity, low vanadium permeability, as well as excellent chemical stability.19–21 The state-of-the-art perfluorosulfonic acid membranes (such as Nafion) are commonly used in VFBs due to their high conductivity and excellent chemical stability;1,22,23 however, low ion selectivity and high cost restrict their further commercialization in VFB.8,24 Therefore, various strategies, including using sulfonated and quaternized hydrocarbon-based membranes,25,26 modification of Nafion,27–29 and the fabrication of porous membranes having thin dense layers, have been developed to reduce the crossover of vanadium and the cost of the membrane.30,31
The exploitation of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) as the separator in VFBs has been extensively investigated since it can mitigate the crossover of vanadium ions due to the Donnan exclusion effect between positively charged AEMs and vanadium ions.30,32–34 Recently, a variety of aromatic polymers, including poly(sulfone),35,36 poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene)37 and poly(phthalazinone ether ketone ketone),38 have been tethered with different kinds of organic cations, such as quaternary ammonium (QA),39 imidazolium,40,41 and pyridinium ions, for VFB application.42 Hickner et al. synthesized QA functionalized poly(sulfone) (QA-Radel) membranes with different ion exchange capacities, and the properties of the QA-Radel membranes were investigated in detail and correlated with the VFB performance.25 Subsequently, Li et al. fabricated a crosslinked AEM by reacting 4,4-bipyridine with chloromethylated poly(sulfone) and the prepared AEMs showed excellent stability and high ionic conductivity for VFB application with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.2% and an energy efficiency (EE) of 81.8% at a current density of 140 mA cm−2.43 Then, they further designed porous AEMs with positively charged cross-linked networks on the pore walls of poly(sulfone) membranes by the water vapor phase inversion method and subsequent quaternization. This unique structure endows the resulting AEMs with extremely high selectivity and stability for VFB applications, resulting in excellent battery performance with a CE of 99% and EE of 86% at a current density of 80 mA cm−2 and more than 6000 cycles.31 However, the chemical stability of the cationic groups, as well as polymer backbones, is the critical issue for AEMs in VFBs. Li and coworkers reported that the poly(sulfone)-based AEMs were prone to attack by vanadium(V) oxygen species on the ether bond of poly(sulfone), which has a detrimental effect on cell performance.44 Recently, Ramani et al.35 employed comprehensive 2D NMR technology to evaluate the chemical stability of poly(sulfone)-based AEMs with quaternary benzyltrimethylammonium groups (PSf-TMA+). The results suggested that the PSF-TMA+ membrane remained chemically stable after ex situ stability testing in 1.5 M vanadium(V) solution for 90 days. Although the significant development of AEMs was achieved for VFB application, the investigations of the structure–property relationship and the degradation mechanism of AEMs for VFBs are still in the infancy stages.
Generally, the microphase separation resulting from the changes in the position of quaternary ammonium and the synthesis of block copolymers has been developed for AEMs to improve their properties for alkaline fuel cell applications such as ion conductivity and chemical stability.45 Particularly, by separating the cationic groups from the polymer backbone via a spacer, the side-chain-type AEMs display great enhancement in chemical stability and ionic conductivity.46 Herein, a series of side-chain-type poly(sulfone)-based AEMs with different cationic groups, including quaternary ammoniums and protonated tertiary amines, have been synthesized by “click chemistry” for VFBs. The side-chain-type architecture is expected to reduce the effect of the electron-withdrawing quaternary ammoniums on the charge state of the polymer backbones, leading to the increased chemical stability of the polymer backbones in acidic and oxidative electrolytes. Thus, the ex situ and in situ chemical stabilities of AEMs were evaluated, and the degradation mechanisms were proposed. Moreover, a detailed comparative investigation of the effect of the nature of cationic groups on the properties of AEMs was performed, which was further correlated to their performance in VFBs by the measurement of the coulombic efficiency and energy efficiency at different current densities in a single cell, and capacity fading during cycling.
Experimental
Materials
Poly(sulfone) (PSf, Mn = 41000), was purchased from Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC (Alpharetta, GA). Nafion 115 membrane was obtained from DuPont, and was treated with 5% H2O2 at 80 °C for 1 h, immersed in 5% H2SO4 at 80 °C for 1 h, washed with DI water several times, and stored in DI water prior to use. Chlorotrimethylsilane (≥97.0%), p-formaldehyde (95%), anhydrous tin tetrachloride (SnCl4, 98%), sodium azide (≥99%), 3-diethylamino-1-propyne (≥99%), diethylamine, triethylamine, propargyl bromide, N,N,N′,N′′,N′′-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA, ≥98%) and copper(I) bromide (CuBr) were obtained from ENERGY CHEMICAL (Shanghai, China). Vanadium sulfate was purchased from the Huating Fine Chemical Industry (Shanghai, China). Other chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of chloromethylated poly(sulfone) (CMPSf)
Chloromethylated poly(sulfone) (CMPSf-x) with different degrees of functionalization (where x is the number of chloromethyl groups per repeat unit) was synthesized according to a previous report.47 Typically, PSf (5.00 g, 11.3 mmol), p-formaldehyde (3.39 g, 113 mmol) and chlorotrimethylsilane (14.3 mL, 113 mol) were dissolved in 200 mL of CHCl3 in a three-necked round-bottomed flask furnished with a reflux column and a magnetic stirrer under a N2 atmosphere. Then, anhydrous tin tetrachloride in CHCl3 (50 mL) was dropwise at 45 °C. The mixture was stirred at 50 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 3 days. The product obtained from this solution was precipitated in methanol as a white flocculent precipitate and was washed with methanol. Finally, CMPSf-1.4 copolymer was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. The degree of chloromethylation (x values) in CMPSf-x copolymers was calculated based on the 1H NMR spectra, and can be controlled by tuning the reaction time.47
Azidation of chloromethylated poly(sulfone) (PSf-N3)
In a typical reaction, CMPSf-1.4 (2 g, 5.48 mmol of chloromethyl group) was dissolved in 40 mL DMF, and then NaN3 (1.78 g, 27.4 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 24 h, and then precipitated into the mixture of methanol/water mixture (v/v = 3/1). The resulting solid polymer was filtered and washed with water and methanol three times. The product PSf-N3-1.4 was obtained after drying at 50 °C under vacuum for 24 h (yield, 95%).
Synthesis of poly(sulfone) containing tertiary amine groups (PSf-c-PTA-x) via click chemistry
PSf-N3-1.4 (2.00 g, 5.38 mmol of azide groups), 3-diethylamino-1-propyne (0.77 mL, 6.46 mmol), PMDETA (0.67 mL, 3.23 mmol) and CuBr (0.23 g, 1.62 mmol) were added to a Schlenk flask and dissolved in 20 mL of NMP. The flask was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles to remove the air and then placed in a 50 °C oil bath. After stirring for 24 h, the product PSf-c-PTA-1.4 was obtained by precipitation into methanol, washing with methanol/water mixture (v/v = 1/3) three times and drying at 50 °C under vacuum for 24 h (yield, 90%).
Synthesis of poly(sulfone) containing quaternary ammonium groups (PSf-c-QA-x) via click chemistry
Firstly, alkyne-functionalized quaternary ammonium, N,N,N-triethylprop-2-yn-1-aminium bromide (TEPA), was synthesized by the Menshutkin reaction with minor modifications according to our reported method.48 Then, poly(sulfone) containing quaternary ammonium groups was prepared by the “click” reaction between PSf-N3-x and TEPA, following a similar procedure to that mentioned above. Briefly, PSf-N3-1.4 (1.00 g, 1.96 mmol), TEPA (0.62 g, 2.82 mmol), CuBr (0.10 g, 0.71 mmol), PMDETA (0.29 mL, 1.41 mmol), and NMP (10 mL) were added in a Schlenk flask. After stirring at 50 °C for 24 h, the product PSf-c-QA-1.2 was obtained by precipitating into DI water, washing with water three times, and drying at 50 °C for 24 h (yield, 80%).
Synthesis of poly(sulfone) containing the tertiary amine group (PSf-PTA-x) by direct nucleophilic substitution
As a control experiment, PSf-PTA-x copolymers were synthesized by the direct nucleophilic substitution of CMPSf-x with diethylamine. Typically, CMPSf-1.4 (1 g, 2.74 mmol of the chloromethyl group) was dissolved in 10 mL of DMF, into which diethylamine (2.82 mL, 27.4 mmol) was added dropwise, followed by stirring at 40 °C for 48 h. The PSf-PTA-1.4 copolymer was obtained by precipitating the mixture into methanol, washing with methanol three times, and drying at room temperature for 24 h.
Preparation of the membrane
PSf-PTA-x, PSf-c-PTA-x, PSf-c-QA-x copolymers were dissolved in NMP (10 wt%). The solution was cast on a flat glass plate and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h followed by drying at 80 °C under vacuum for 24 h. The obtained membranes were treated with 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution for 24 h to yield the membrane with sulfate ions or hydrogen sulfate ions. Then, the membranes were washed thoroughly with deionized water to remove any residual H2SO4 and immersed in deionized water that was degassed and blanketed with flowing argon prior to analysis.
Characterization and measurements

1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX-400 spectrometer at room temperature using CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as the solvent. The attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was recorded on a PE-1710 spectrometer from 4000 to 400 cm−1 with a 4 cm−1 resolution in 64 scans using polymer thin films. Tensile measurements were conducted on a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA Q800, USA) in controlled force mode with a stretch rate of 0.50 N min−1 at room temperature. The battery performance test was conducted by a battery-testing instrument (Neware BT 2000) at constant current densities ranging from 40 to 180 mA cm−2.
Water uptake and swelling ratios of membranes in different aqueous solutions, including deionized water, 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.5 M VOSO4/3 M H2SO4 were measured. After drying the membranes in bisulfate form at 60 °C for 12 h, the dry membranes were immersed into the desired solution for 48 h at room temperature. The membranes were taken out and the excess water wiped from the surface with a tissue paper, then quickly weighed until a constant mass was obtained. The water uptake (WU) was calculated based on the following equation:  where Wwet and Wdry are the masses of the hydrated and dry membranes, respectively.
The swelling ratio (SR) was calculated according to the equation  where Lwet and Ldry are the lengths of the hydrated and dry membrane samples at room temperature, respectively. Every membrane was tested three times and the average value was used in order to reduce errors.
The experimental IEC values (IECexp) of membranes were obtained by the back-titration method.43 The membranes in chloride form were obtained by immersion in 1 M NaCl for 48 h and washing several times with DI water. Then, the membranes in chloride form were immersed in 1 M Na2SO4 for 48 h. Finally, the released chloride ions from the membrane were titrated with 0.01 M AgNO3, using K2CrO4 as an indicator. The IEC was calculated from  where VAgNO3 and CAgNO3 are the volume and concentration of consumed AgNO3 solution, respectively, and Wdry is the mass of the dried membrane.
The ionic conductivities (σ, mS cm−1) of the membranes were measured by two-point probe alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy over the frequency range from 100 mHz to 100 kHz using an impedance/gain-phase analyzer (Bio-logic VSR-300, FR). During the measurement, membranes were cut into pieces of 1 cm × 4 cm and set in a Teflon cell. Then, the cell was immersed in deionized water that was degassed and blanketed with flowing Ar gas and the impedance spectrum was collected. The conductivity was calculated based on the equationσ = d/LWR,where d is the distance between reference electrodes, W and L are the width and thickness of the membrane, respectively, R is the measured ohmic resistance of membrane.
The area resistance of the membranes in bisulfate form was measured via a conductivity cell according to the reported method.31 The cell was filled with 0.5 M H2SO4 in each cell, which was separated by the sample membrane into two compartments with an effective area of 7.07 cm2. The area resistance was measured by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) over a frequency range from 100 mHz to 100 kHz. The area resistance (R) was calculated using the formula below:R = A × (R1 − R2)where R1 and R2 are the electronic resistance of a conductive cell with and without membrane, respectively, A is the effective area of a membrane.
Vanadium permeability across the membrane was measured by using a diffusion cell according to a previous report.49 A membrane was assembled between two compartments. The donating side of the H-cell was filled with 1.5 M VOSO4 in 3 M H2SO4 solution, while the other side had 1.5 M MgSO4 in 3 M H2SO4 solution to equalize the ionic strengths and minimize the osmotic pressure effects. The solutions in both reservoirs were vigorously stirred to minimize concentration polarization. The effective area of the membrane was 2 cm2. At regular intervals, the concentration of VO2+ in the receiving reservoir was measured by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600, Japan) and the vanadium permeability (K) was calculated according to Fick's diffusion law using the following equation:  where VR is the volume in the receiving side, CR(t) is the concentration of VO2+ in the receiving reservoir, CL is the concentration of VO2+ in the donating reservoir, while A and D are the effective area and thickness of the membrane, respectively.
VFB single cell performance and ex situ chemical stability test
In a typical VFB single cell that was assembled with a membrane, 10 mL of 1.5 M V2+/V3+ in a 3 M H2SO4 solution and 10 mL of 1.5 M VO2+/VO2+ in a 3 M H2SO4 solution were cyclically pumped into the negative and positive half cells, respectively. Self-discharge started at a state of charge (SOC) of 100%. The procedure was stopped when the open circuit voltage (OCV) was lower than 0.8 V.50
A home-made VFB single cell was assembled, where a membrane was sandwiched by two pieces of carbon felt electrodes (Liaoning Jingu Tech, China) and clamped with two bipolar plates (Hongjun Shanghai Tech, China). All these components were fixed between two PMMA glass plates and the two electrolyte reservoirs were sealed to minimize the oxidation of the vanadium species. The effective area of the electrode was 4 cm2. Then, 50 mL of 1.5 M V2+/V3+ in 3 M H2SO4 solution and 50 mL of 1.5 M VO2+/VO2+ in 3 M H2SO4 solution were used as the negative and positive electrolytes, respectively, which were cyclically pumped into two half-cells. The flow rate of the electrolyte was kept at 50–60 mL min−1. The performance of VFB was recorded on the Neware BT 2000 at constant current densities ranging from 40 to 180 mA cm−2. The voltages were set from 1.7 to 0.7 V to minimize the corrosion of the carbon felt electrodes and graphite polar plates. The cycling tests were carried out at a constant current density of 120 mA cm−2.
The membranes with the size of 4 cm × 4 cm were treated with 30 mL 0.15 M VO2+ in 3 M solution in sealed glass vials at 40 °C. At regular intervals, 3 mL of the electrolyte was taken out to measure the concentration of VO2+ using a UV-vis spectrometer. Moreover, the membrane was immersed in a more concentrated VO2+ electrolyte solution (1.5 M VO2+ in 3 M H2SO4) at 40 °C for 30 days to accelerate the degradation and simulate the battery environment. The chemical structure of the membranes was characterized to determine the degradation behavior of the membranes.
Results and discussion
Polymer synthesis and characterization
In order to prepare a series of anion exchange membranes having different kinds of functional cationic groups, chloromethylation of poly(sulfone) was conducted to yield different degrees of functionalization (x, the number of chloromethyl groups per repeat unit), which was calculated from 1H NMR spectra. After the treatment with excessive NaN3 at 60 °C for 24 h, azide-functionalized poly(sulfone) was obtained. Meanwhile, alkyne-terminated QA was synthesized by reacting propargyl bromide with corresponding amines and the purity was verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S2†). Finally, azide-functionalized poly(sulfone) copolymers with different degrees of functionalization (x) reacted with alkyne-terminated QA or tertiary amine via the Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction to give the quaternized poly(sulfone) (PSf-c-QA-x) and poly(sulfone) containing protonated tertiary amine groups (PSf-c-PTA-x), respectively (Scheme 1). As a control experiment, the PSf-PTA-x copolymer with protonated tertiary amine directly tethered onto the polymer backbone was also prepared. All anion-conductive copolymers showed excellent solubility in DMF, NMP and DMSO, but were insoluble in water, as shown in Table S1.† Thus, transparent and mechanical robust membranes were obtained by solution casting, and the thickness of the membranes was controlled at 125 ± 5 μm. It was noted that PSf-c-PTA-x and PSf-PTA-x copolymers were further protonated by immersing the membranes in 1 M aqueous H2SO4 for VFBs application.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of anion-conductive copolymers. 
The chemical structure of the copolymers was confirmed by 1H NMR and ATR-IR. As shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† the appearance of new peaks at 8.27 and 8.49 ppm was attributed to the proton (H8) in the 1,2,3-triazole group for PSf-c-PTA and PSf-c-QA copolymers, respectively. The peak at 4.14 ppm assigned to the methylene protons in PSf-N3 sample completely shifted to 5.61 ppm after the CuAAC reaction, indicating the successful synthesis of the quaternized poly(sulfone) by click chemistry. Moreover, the appearance of the peak at 9.55 ppm suggested that the tertiary amine in the “clicked” poly(sulfone) was protonated by strong acid. The ion exchange capacity of anion exchange membranes was calculated by comparing the integral ratio of the peak H7 and H4 (Fig. S1†). In addition, the disappearance of the characteristic peak of the azide group at 2120 cm−1 in the ATR-IR spectra of the clicked poly(sulfone) also confirmed that the quaternized poly(sulfone) copolymers were successfully synthesized.
Water uptake and swelling ratio of membranes
Water uptake of membranes plays a significant role in the formation of charge carriers, which, in turn, affects the battery performance. However, excessive water absorption in membranes also would induce inferior dimensional stability as well as poor mechanical strength. Table 1 lists the IEC values, water uptake and swelling ratios of AEMs in 1.5 M VOSO4/3 M H2SO4 at 20 °C. The theoretical IEC values calculated based on the 1H NMR spectra were in the range of 1.36–2.18 meq g−1, which agreed well with the experimental values measured by the back-titration method. As shown in Fig. 1, the water uptake of AEMs increased with increasing in IEC values as expected. For example, the water uptake of the side-chain-type PSf-c-PTA AEMs increased from 27.9% to 40.8% when the IEC values increased from 1.56 to 1.83 meq g−1. These values were much higher as compared to the PSf-PTA membranes. It is assumed that the 1,2,3-triazole groups provided more sites for water and hydrogen sulfate to form more effective and continuous hydrogen-bonding networks.46 Additionally, much higher water uptake was observed for PSf-c-QA as compared to the PSf-c-PTA with tertiary amines, probably due to the high basicity of the quaternary ammonium groups that have a stronger hydration effect on water than tertiary amines.51 Low water uptake leads to a low swelling ratio, as shown in Fig. 1b. The water uptake of all membranes was also tested in DI water and 0.5 M H2SO4 at 20 °C, and similar water uptake and swelling ratio behaviors were observed as shown in Table S2 and Fig. S4.†

Ionic conductivity and area resistance of membranes
Ionic conductivity of AEMs in hydrogen sulfate form was measured in water using a two-probe method, and was further plotted as a function of IEC values in Fig. 2a. Normally, the ionic conductivity of AEMs increases with increasing the amount of ion exchange groups. Side-chain-type AEMs (PSf-c-PTA and PSf-c-QA) displayed higher ionic conductivities compared to PSf-PTA membranes because of the existence of the click 1,2,3-triazole group that probably provided more sites to form efficient and continuous hydrogen-bonded networks for enhanced ion transport. These results are consistent with our previous reports.45,46,48 Among all the samples, PSf-c-QA-1.2 membranes showed the highest ion conductivity (37.6 mS cm−1, IEC = 1.65 meq g−1), probably due to the high pKa value of the quaternary ammonium groups leading to the enhancement of the number of dissociated anions and water molecules.52 Generally, the membranes having high ionic conductivity possess low area resistance. As shown in Fig. 2b, the area resistance of AEMs, which was measured in 0.5 M H2SO4, decreased with the increasing of IEC values. For instance, the area resistance of PSf-c-PTA membranes decreased from 0.8 to 0.3 Ω cm2 when the IEC was increased from 1.56 and 1.83 meq g−1. It should be noted that the side-chain-type AEMs showed lower area resistance than the typical Nafion 115 membrane, which could lower the electrical loss when VFBs utilizing AEMs were charged/discharged at higher current density. In order to fully compare the area resistance between different kinds of AEMs, Table S3† lists the area resistance of the reported AEMs for VFBs application, which was replotted as a function of IEC value in Fig. 3.

 Fig. 3  Area resistance of reported AEMs as a function of IEC. 
Our side-chain-type membranes (PSf-c-PTA and PSf-c-QA) showed comparable or even lower area resistance among all the samples, indicating that the side-chain-type architecture in AEM facilitated the ion transport for VFB use.
Vanadium permeability behavior of membranes
Because of the Donnan exclusion effect between fixed cations in AEMs and vanadium ions, lower vanadium permeability was achieved for AEMs as compared to negatively-charged Nafion.53 Thus, the use of AEMs in VFB could alleviate the cross-mixing of vanadium ions between positive and negative electrolytes, resulting in the reduction of self-discharge and capacity decay during long-term operation. In this work, the permeability of VO2+ through the membrane was measured in a diffusion cell and a linear relationship between time and vanadium concentration is shown in Fig. 4. It is obvious that the slope of the line for all membranes is related to the water uptake of AEMs. Greater water uptake leads to a higher swelling ratio, which in turn increases the crossover of vanadium ions through membranes. Additionally, the permeability (Pv) of VO2+ through the membrane was calculated based on Fick's law and is illustrated in Table 2. The Pv values of AEMs with the PTA group (0.77 × 10−7 to 2.72 × 10−7 cm2 min−1) are much lower than that of Nafion 115 (12.6 × 10−7 cm2 min−1), indicating that the existence of tethered organic cations in AEMs could block the penetration of vanadium ions due to the Donnan exclusion effect. However, PSf-c-QA-1.2 showed higher Pv values when compared to Nafion 115. This can be explained by the fact that PSf-c-QA absorbed more water and led to a higher dimensional change as shown in Fig. 1. Consequently, a trade-off between ionic conductivity and selectivity needs to be considered when increasing the IEC values in AEMs.

Ex situ oxidation stability test
Since the VO2+ ion is a strong oxidant that could cause the chemical degradation of membranes, PSf-c-PTA-1.4, PSf-PTA-1.4 and PSf-c-QA-1.2 with similar IEC values were chosen for ex situ oxidative stability tests in 0.15 M VO2+ in 3 M H2SO4 solution at 40 °C. At regular intervals, the degree of membrane degradation was examined by measuring the concentration of VO2+ ions in the testing solution that was produced during the membrane degradation when VO2+ was reduced.44 Therefore, the lower generation rate of the VO2+ ions is indicative of the higher stability of the corresponding membranes. As shown in Fig. 5a, the concentration of VO2+ ions increased with the immersion time for all AEMs, suggesting that chemical degradation may occur under oxidative conditions. Although side-chain-type AEMs (PSf-c-PTA and PSf-c-QA) showed higher water uptake than the PSf-PTA membrane, the PSf-PTA membrane underwent the fastest chemical degradation. Moreover, pristine poly(sulfone) was proved to be stable under the oxidative conditions since no VO2+ ion was detected during the testing. This result indicated that the introduction of ion exchange groups may accelerate the degradation of membranes.54 After 720 h of stability testing, the obvious color change of the solution in glass bottles also manifested the chemical degradation of AEMs under oxidative conditions, as shown in Fig. 5b.

In order to clarify the degradation mechanism of AEMs under oxidative conditions, accelerated stability testing was performed by immersing the AEMs in 1.5 M (VO2)2SO4 in 3 M H2SO4 at 40 °C. After 720 h of testing, all the samples were taken out and washed several times with 0.5 M H2SO4 to remove the residual vanadium ions. The aged PSf-PTA-1.4 sample lost its mechanical properties and was broken into small pieces after stability testing. This phenomenon was also observed by Li44 and Hickner.55 Surprisingly, side-chain-type AEMs (PSf-c-PTA-1.4 and PSf-c-QA-1.2) retained reasonable mechanical properties after stability testing, as indicated by the measurement of the mechanical properties in Table 3.

Due to the good solubility of aged AEMs in DMSO, the degradation mechanism of AEMs under an oxidative environment was further elucidated by NMR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 6, the PSf-PTA-1.4 membrane with benzylethylethanaminium groups directly attached to the polymer backbone underwent significant chemical degradation after 720 h of testing. A new proton peak at 7.65 ppm appeared in the 1H NMR spectrum of aged PSf-PTA-1.4, indicating the chemical decomposition of polymer backbones. This result was further confirmed by the appearance of a new peak at 118.9 ppm, attributed to the carbon adjacent to the vanadium oxygen species in the 13C NMR spectrum of aged PSf-PTA-1.4 (Fig. S5†). Similar degradation behavior was also reported for quaternized poly(sulfone), according to the FT-IR and Raman results.44 Thus, poly(sulfone) with directly tethered cations tends to be attacked by vanadium(V) oxygen species in a strong oxidative electrolyte, leading to the poor mechanical properties of aged membranes. However, no measurable decomposition of the polymer backbone was found for the side-chain-type AEMs. It is considered that when the cations are separated from the polymer backbone via a spacer, the effect of cations on the charge state of the polymer backbone is likely lessened, resulting in improved stability. Moreover, the appearance of new peaks at 1.2 and 2.9 ppm was observed in the 1H NMR spectra of aged PSf-c-PTA and PSf-PTA membranes, suggesting the degradation of protonated tertiary amine groups. The degradation of PTA groups under oxidative electrolyte was also manifested by the decreased integration ratio of the isolated signal H8, H9 in PSf-PTA and H4, H5 in PSf-c-PTA. Thus, the degradation mechanism of PTA groups may involve the elimination of the ethyl group through being attacked by vanadium(V) oxygen species. Notably, even after exposure to 1.5 M VO2+ for 720 h, the side-chain-type PSf-c-QA membrane having QA cations remained chemically stable as confirmed by the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. It was hypothesized that the difference in electronegativity between two cations may be responsible for the diverse stability in VFBs, and PTA groups with more electronegativity are prone to be attacked by the lone pair electron on the vanadium(V) oxygen species.44 Based on the above findings, the chemical stability and proposed degradation mechanism of AEMs are summarized in Scheme 2.

VFB single cell performance of membranes
To further investigate how the chemical structure of AEMs affects the vanadium migration through membranes, a self-discharge test was carried out after the cell was fully charged. In Fig. 7, an open current voltage of 0.8–1.55 V was observed for VFBs with the prepared AEMs, which is comparable to that with the Nafion 115 membrane. After a slow decline over the first 40 h, the OCV of VFBs with the PSf-c-QA membrane displayed a sharp drop to 0.8 V. However, the times of the OCV above 0.8 V with PSf-PTA and PSf-c-PTA membranes were 66 h and 58 h respectively, which are higher as compared to that of VFB with Nafion membrane (46 h). The increased lasting time of the OCV demonstrated the low degree of vanadium crossover through AEMs, which agreed well with the previously observed trend in the VO2+ permeability of membranes measured in a diffusion cell.
 Fig. 7  Self-discharge behavior of the VFB single cell assembled with membranes. 
The performance of the VFB single cell fabricated with AEMs was firstly examined at 120 mA cm−2 and compared to that of Nafion 115. As shown in Fig. 8a, a small overpotential during the charge/discharge process was observed for the VFB with the PSf-c-PTA membrane, while the charge–discharge profile of the battery assembled with the PSf-PTA-1.4 membrane overlapped with that of Nafion 115. This result is in line with the membrane resistance trend, as shown in Table 1. Higher membrane resistance may lead to higher overpotential; consequently, the VFB with the PSf-PTA-1.4 membrane exhibited a higher CE of 99.4%, probably due to its lower vanadium permeability, while the highest voltage efficiency (VE) of 85.6% was achieved for the VFB using the PSf-c-PTA membrane with the lower area resistance. Combined with the vanadium permeability and area resistance of AEMs, the highest VFB energy efficiency of 84.3% at the current density of 120 mA cm−2 was observed for the PSf-c-PTA membrane, as shown in Fig. 8b. Furthermore, the VFB performances were investigated at different current densities, as shown in Fig. 9. Generally, when increasing the current density, the CE of flow batteries increases and VE decreases. At higher current density, a shorter time is needed during the charge/discharge process for redox-active material crossover, while more ohmic polarization loss of the cells is obtained; thus, the adverse trend in CE and VE with the increasing current density was found.19 For instance, in the VFB assembled with the PSf-c-PTA membrane, CE increased from 95.4% to 99.2% with increasing current density from 40 to 180 mA cm−2, while VE decreased from 94.8% to 79.0%. In order to fully compare the area resistance between different kinds of AEMs, the resistance of single cells assembled with side-chain-type AEMs and Nafion 115 were measured, as shown in Fig. 9d; the results displayed a trend consistent with their area resistance. Although there is a trade-off between the ionic conductivity and vanadium permeability for AEMs, VFBs with PSf-c-PTA-1.4 membrane displayed a CE of 98.4% and EE of 84.3% at a current density of 120 mA cm−2, which outperformed the benchmark Nafion 115 membrane (CE = 97.3% and EE = 75.5%), as shown in Fig. S6.†

We then investigated the cycling performance of VFBs with the prepared AEMs at 120 mA cm−2. Fig. 10a shows that the higher discharge capacity retention was observed for VFBs assembled with the PSf-PTA-1.4 membrane in the first 50 cycles. The lower vanadium permeability of the PSf-PTA-1.4 membrane is believed to be the main factor for its superior cell performance. More importantly, the EE of the VFB with AEMs remained above 60% during the first 50 cycles. In order to evaluate the chemical stability of AEMs during a continuous cycling test, the extended cycling tests were performed at 120 mA cm−2, and the change in EE value of VFBs with different AEMs was recorded with the increasing cycling numbers, as shown in Fig. 10b. After a long period of slow decline, the EE value of the VFBs with AEMs suddenly dropped to zero. To our surprise, the VFB with the PSf-PTA membrane showed the best durability in spite of its relatively poor chemical stability, and its corresponding lifetime was about 36 days. In contrast, after 22 days of cycle testing, the performance of the VFB with the chemically stable PSf-c-QA membrane faded.
 Fig. 10  (a) Cycling retention in discharge capacity and (b) energy efficiency of VFBs assembled with membranes at 120 mA cm−2. 
After cycle testing, AEMs were removed from the faded battery to explore the degradation mechanism. There were some easy-to-find small holes in the aged membrane especially at the membrane edge as shown in Fig. S7,† which may be responsible for the sudden drop in EE for VFBs. This observation is consistent with Zhang's previous report.56 The tensile strength and elongation at break of all AEMs were measured using dry and wet samples at 20 °C, and the results are listed in Table S4.† It was obvious that the tensile strength of the dry and wet PSf-PTA membranes was higher compared to the side-chain-type AEMs due to its lower swelling ratio. Moreover, due to the plasticizing effect of water, the tensile strength of wet AEMs was reduced, while elongation was increased as compared to dry samples.57,58 It is hypothesized that the formation of these fatal holes during cycling tests may have arisen from the mechanical degradation of membranes caused by the precipitation and dissolution of vanadium ions in and out of the membrane.35 Thus, the mechanical properties of aged AEMs in an operating VFB were tested and compared to pristine ones, as listed in Table 3. It is obvious that the tensile strength and elongation at break of all AEMs decrease after cycle testing in VFB. Specifically, after 36 days of cycle testing, the tensile strength of the PSf-PTA membrane with better cycling performance maintained 80% of its initial strength while the tensile strength of PSf-c-QA membrane, which showed inferior cycling performance, maintained 45% of its initial strength after 22 days of testing.
The aged AEMs after the in situ durability testing in an operating VFB were further characterized by NMR technology due to their excellent solubility in DMSO. Similar degradation behavior to ex situ chemical testing was found when the membrane underwent in-cell durability tests. As shown in Fig. 11 and S8,† both polymer backbone and benzylethylethanaminium groups in the PSf-PTA group degraded when it was assembled in VFB for cycling performance testing. The degradation of the polymer backbone in side-chain-type AEMs was not observed, while the PSf-c-QA membrane, having QA functional groups, showed no obvious chemical degradation after 22 days of cycle testing, according to their 1H and 13C NMR results in Fig. 11 and S8.† When comparing the ex situ and in situ chemical stability of AEMs in VFBs, ex situ durability testing could mimic the degradation of membranes in an operating battery. On the other hand, the chemically unstable PSf-PTA membrane showed better cycling performance in VFBs as compared to the chemically stable PSf-c-QA membrane. This unusual result indicates that the chemical degradation of AEMs in oxidative electrolytes may not be the key factor that determines the durability of VFBs, while mechanical degradation mainly contributes to the poor cycling performance, which needs to be considered in the design of AEMs for VFB applications in the future.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed polysulfone-based side-chain-type AEMs (PSf-c-PTA and PSf-c-QA), functionalized with two different cationic groups via chloromethylation, azidation and the Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction to investigate the degradation mechanism for VFB application. Compared to the control PSf-PTA membrane with the benzylethylethanaminium group, a lower area resistance (<1.0 Ω cm2) and a relatively higher vanadium permeability were observed for the side-chain-type membrane (PSf-c-PTA and PSf-c-QA), which may be ascribed to the higher water uptake of side-chain-type samples. The performance of VFBs with the prepared AEMs was investigated and correlated to the properties of AEMs. The PSf-PTA membrane with the lowest vanadium permeability demonstrated that the high coulombic efficiency and high voltage efficiency of the VFB with the PSf-c-QA membrane was achieved due to its low area resistance. In particular, due to the balanced properties between ionic conductivity and vanadium permeability, the VFB assembled with the PSf-c-PTA membrane exhibited the CE of 98.4% and EE of 84.3% at a current density of 120 mA cm−2, which outperformed the Nafion 115 membrane (CE of 97.3% and EE of 75.5%). Additionally, the similar chemical degradation behavior in 1.5 M VO2+/3 M H2SO4 at 40 °C and the in situ VFB durability test demonstrated that no obvious degradation of the polymer backbone was observed for side-chain-type AEMs, while both the polymer backbone and cationic groups were unstable for the PSf-PTA membrane, as evidenced by NMR analysis. However, the charge–discharge cycling performance of the VFB with the chemically unstable PSf-PTA membrane was better than that with the chemically stable PSf-c-QA membrane. Mechanical property testing of aged AEMs revealed that the durability of VFBs with AEM is related to the mechanical degradation of AEMs instead of chemical degradation. This result provided fundamental insight on the degradation of AEMs in VFB and gave us directions for the design of high-performance and long-durable AEMs for VFB applications.
