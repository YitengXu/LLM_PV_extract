    , Accepted 2nd June 2016First published on 2nd June 2016AbstractOne of the challenging issues in photocatalytic overall water splitting is to efficiently separate the photogenerated charges and the reduction and oxidation catalytic sites on semiconductor-based photocatalysts. It has been reported that the photogenerated charge can be separated between different facets of a semiconductor crystal with low symmetry. However, many semiconductor crystals possess high symmetry (such as the cubic phase) and expose isotropic facets, which are not suitable for charge separation between the facets. Herein, using a nanocrystal morphology tailoring strategy, we synthesized the exposed facets of high symmetry SrTiO3 nanocrystals from isotropic facets (6-facet SrTiO3) to anisotropic facets (18-facet SrTiO3), which leads to the exposure of different crystal facets. We found that the reduction and oxidation catalytic sites can be separately distributed only on the anisotropic facets of 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals, but randomly distributed on every facet of 6-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals. Based on these findings, the selective distribution of dual-cocatalysts on the anisotropic facets of 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals leads to a fivefold enhancement of apparent quantum efficiency. The superior performance can be attributed to the charge separation between anisotropic facets and the separation of the reduction and oxidation catalytic sites to reduce the charge recombination. These findings will be instructive for the rational design of a high efficiency photocatalytic system for solar energy conversion.

Broader context
Solar energy has the advantages of being clean, abundant and renewable. Therefore, solar energy to hydrogen energy conversion using photocatalytic water splitting is one of the promising methods to tackle serious energy and environmental problems. Charge separation and surface catalytic reactions are of great significance to enhance the efficiency of solar energy conversion. Cocatalysts can serve as the active sites and catalyze the water splitting reactions. Traditionally, cocatalysts are randomly loaded on photocatalysts by an impregnation or adsorption method. In this case, cocatalysts are possibly deposited on the wrong sites (e.g., the reduction cocatalyst is deposited on the hole-transferred site or the oxidation cocatalyst is deposited on the electron-transferred site), which leads to the increase of the recombination of charge carriers. Using a nanocrystal morphology tailoring strategy, we rationally synthesized high symmetry SrTiO3 nanocrystals from isotropic facets (6-facet SrTiO3) to anisotropic facets (18-facet SrTiO3). The spatial separation of charge and selective distribution of active sites can be achieved on different facets of 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals, which leads to a remarkable enhancement of apparent quantum efficiency compared to 6-facet SrTiO3. These findings will be instructive for the rational design of a high efficiency photocatalytic system for solar energy conversion.

Introduction
Hydrogen production from overall water splitting using semiconductor-based nanocrystal photocatalysts is one of the most promising routes to address energy and environmental concerns.1–8 Generally, three major steps are involved in the photocatalytic overall water splitting process: absorption of light to generate electron–hole pairs, charge separation and surface catalytic reactions. Among these steps, for a given semiconductor material, charge separation and surface catalytic reactions are of great significance to enhance the efficiency of solar energy conversion.9–13 Although the photogenerated electrons and holes may possess thermodynamically sufficient potentials for water splitting, they can easily recombine if there are no suitable active sites available for the photocatalytic reactions. Cocatalysts (either nanoparticles or molecular complexes) can serve as the active sites and catalyze the water splitting reactions.10,14 Traditionally, cocatalysts are loaded on semiconductor crystals by an impregnation or adsorption method, which, in most cases, results in a random distribution of the cocatalysts on the surface of the photocatalysts.15 Hence, the reduction and oxidation active sites are possibly located close to each other. In this case, recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes may take place before they are transferred to the reduction and oxidation active sites. Therefore, spatial separation of reduction and oxidation active sites can be presumably proposed as an effective method to reduce the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and consequently improve solar energy conversion efficiency.
Some experiments have shown the effect of exposed facets of crystals on photocatalysis, including TiO2,16–22 WO3,23–25 BiVO4,26 PbTiO3,27 and Ag3PO428,29. However, it is unclear why the morphology can result in a very different activity, particularly some exposed facets seem to be important for the photocatalytic performance of low symmetry nanocrystals. Giocondi et al. observed the preferential reduction of Ag+ and oxidation of Pb2+ on {100} facets of SrTiO3 nanocrystals. Therefore, the authors considered that the {100} type surfaces are the most active. Furthermore, the band structure of SrTiO3 nanocrystals was investigated in detail, which can be applied to predict their anisotropic properties.30,31 Chen et al. used super-resolution imaging to map both hole- and electron-driven activities on TiO2 nanorods. Using fluorescence tagging and optical microscopy, they found that the sites for photocurrent enhancement are the lower-activity sites and for onset potential reduction are the sites with a more positive onset potential, which suggests an activity-based strategy for designing photoelectrodes.32 Recently, it has been reported that spatial charge separation can be realized between the different facets (anisotropic facets) of BiVO4 nanocrystals (monoclinic phase) and this charge separation between different facets is considered to be responsible for their enhanced photocatalytic activity.33,34 This is understandable because monoclinic BiVO4 is a crystal with low symmetry (point groups: C2, Cs, C2h), which results in the formation of anisotropic facets ({010} and {110}) intrinsically. So the fundamental questions now are if the charge separation between different facets is general or just for low symmetry crystals, and if any other semiconductors with high symmetry show a similar phenomenon, such as the cubic phase (point groups: Oh, O, Td, Th, T). How to separate the photogenerated electrons and holes in high symmetry crystals? To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not been addressed so far.
In this work, to solve this problem, cubic phase SrTiO3 nanocrystals (high symmetry), which are able to split water into H2 and O2, are chosen as a model to intentionally tailor their morphology from isotropic facets ({001}, 6-facet SrTiO3) to anisotropic facets ({001} and {110}, 18-facet SrTiO3). Interestingly, we found that reduction and oxidation catalysts can be separately photodeposited on the anisotropic facets of 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals, but randomly distributed on every facet of 6-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals, unambiguously suggesting that the photogenerated charge can also be separated between the anisotropic facets of a nanocrystal with high symmetry. Furthermore, the selective distribution of dual-cocatalysts on the anisotropic facets of 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals can greatly increase the activity in photocatalytic overall water splitting, and lead to more than fivefold enhancement of apparent quantum efficiency compared with that of 6-facet SrTiO3 with only isotropic facets. The superior performance can be attributed to the high charge separation efficiency between anisotropic facets and the spatial separation of the reduction and oxidation catalytic sites to effectively reduce the recombination of photogenerated charges.
Results and discussion
Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is a typical semiconductor belonging to the cubic phase and has shown photocatalytic activity in overall water splitting.35–40 Hence, the SrTiO3 single nanocrystal is chosen as an ideal model to achieve spatial charge separation and selective loading of dual-cocatalysts as catalytic sites for photocatalytic overall water splitting.
Cubic SrTiO3 nanocrystals, with all the identical 6 facets exposed (6-facet SrTiO3), were synthesized (Fig. 1a–c). The exposed facet of 6-facet SrTiO3 is the {001} facet with O and Sr atoms on the surface (Fig. 1d), which is thermodynamically more stable than other facets, according to surface energy calculations.41

Due to the exposed identical facets for 6-facet SrTiO3, it is difficult to spatially separate the redox catalytic sites on specific facets. Considering the slightly different surface energy between the {001} and {110} facets, it is possible to simultaneously expose {001} and {110} facets by controlling the nanocrystal nucleation and growth process. In this case, all the edges of the 6-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal were tailored and {110} facets were formed at the intersection of {001} facets. Hence, a SrTiO3 nanocrystal with a new morphology, 18-facet SrTiO3, having two different types of exposed facets, was synthesized (Fig. 1e). Using this strategy, the exposed facet of SrTiO3 nanocrystals can be rationally tailored from isotropic facets to anisotropic facets. Based on this idea, we successfully designed 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals with a regular morphology and smooth surface with exposed {001} and {110} facets (Fig. 1f–i).42,43

Fig. 1 shows that the two kinds of as-synthesized SrTiO3 nanocrystals exhibit comparable crystal sizes (∼200 nm). X-ray diffraction patterns of 6-facet and 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals show the cubic phase (JAPDS No. 35-0734) (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra reveal the same adsorption edges for the two kinds of SrTiO3 nanocrystals (Fig. S2, ESI†). These results indicate that both nanocrystals are almost the same in properties, except for their exposed facets.
The in situ photodeposition method is used to determine the locations of the reduction and oxidation catalytic sites.44–46Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of SrTiO3 after photo-reduction and photo-oxidation deposition. It can be observed that photo-reduced noble metals (Pt, Au and Ag) are deposited on every facet of the 6-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals without any preferential deposition (Fig. 2a–d). A similar phenomenon is also observed for the photo-oxidation deposition of MnOx and Co3O4 (Fig. 2e and f). The noble metal deposited by photo-reduction and the metal oxides formed by photo-oxidation are respectively confirmed by XPS characterization (Fig. S3, ESI†).33,34 These results indicate that both reduction and oxidation active sites appear randomly on all facets, suggesting that photogenerated electrons and holes were distributed on all the facets of 6-facet SrTiO3.

The contents of the deposited noble metal/metal oxides are all 2.0 wt%. 
Interestingly, for 18-facet SrTiO3, it was found that the photo-reduction deposition of noble metals (Pt, Au and Ag) mainly appeared on the {001} facet of 18-facet SrTiO3, while almost no metal particles were observed on the {110} facet (Fig. 2g–j), which indicates that reduction reactions preferentially take place on the {001} facet of the 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal. MnOx and Co3O4 particles are deposited on the {110} facets of 18-facet SrTiO3via photo-oxidation (Fig. 2k and l), reflecting that oxidation reactions preferentially occur on the {110} facet of the 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal. The above results prove that reduction and oxidation active sites can be separated on the anisotropic facets ({001} and {110}) of the 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal.
To further verify the role of the spatial separation of redox sites on anisotropic facets, both noble metals and metal oxides were simultaneously deposited on the two types of SrTiO3 nanocrystals by in situ photo-reduction and photo-oxidation deposition methods. For the 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal, the photo-reduction deposition of Pt selectively occurred on the {001} facet and the photo-oxidation deposition of Co3O4 selectively occurred on the {110} facet (Fig. 3a). However, for the 6-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal, both Pt and Co3O4 were randomly located on every facet (Fig. 3b). All these results are consistent with those from the photo-reduction or photo-oxidation deposition respectively. These results further confirm that the reduction and oxidation catalytic sites can be spatially separated on the anisotropic facets of SrTiO3 nanocrystals.

As a comparison, the two types of SrTiO3 nanocrystals with dual-cocatalysts deposited were also prepared by a traditional impregnation method. It was found that both noble metals and metal oxides were randomly deposited on every facet of both 6-facet SrTiO3 and 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals (Fig. S4, ESI†). For both 18-facet SrTiO3 and 6-facet SrTiO3, reduction or oxidation cocatalysts showed a very uniform distribution on every facet. Therefore, the selective distribution of dual-cocatalysts on the anisotropic facets of 18-facet SrTiO3 by the photodeposition method did not arise from the selective adsorption but from the spatial separation of the photogenerated charge between the anisotropic facets. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) of Fig. 3 and the HRSEM image of Pt–MnOx/18-facet SrTiO3 can be seen in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
To investigate the effect of the dual-cocatalysts deposited on the SrTiO3 nanocrystal depending on the spatial separation of reduction and oxidation catalytic sites on SrTiO3 nanocrystals with isotropic or anisotropic facets, photocatalytic overall water splitting investigations for the two types of SrTiO3 nanocrystals were performed. HER takes place on the surface of the Pt cocatalyst. Therefore, the surface of the Pt cocatalyst is considered as the active site for HER. CO adsorption is used to measure the active sites of metal particles.47,48 To quantitatively compare the activities, the number of exposed Pt atoms on 6-facet SrTiO3 and 18-facet SrTiO3 were measured by the CO adsorption method and the photocatalytic activities were normalized by the number of surface active sites of Pt cocatalysts (Table S1, ESI†).
SrTiO3 nanocrystals with the dual-cocatalysts deposited are labeled as Pt–Co3O4/6-facet SrTiO3 and Pt–Co3O4/18-facet SrTiO3 (Table 1). Bare 6-facet and 18-facet SrTiO3 without cocatalysts showed almost no photoactivity (entries 1 and 5). However, H2 and O2 products in the molecular ratio of approximately 2:1 were detected for the 6-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal after photodepositing Pt as a reduction cocatalyst (entry 2). After photodepositing Pt and Co3O4 as dual-cocatalysts, the photocatalytic activity was at the same level as that with only Pt deposited as the reduction cocatalyst (entries 2 and 4), which implies that SrTiO3 itself shows a high activity in water oxidation while the oxidation cocatalysts have less contribution to the overall water splitting on 6-facet SrTiO3.

For the 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal, the photocatalytic activity was increased 2.5 times after Pt deposition compared with that of the 6-facet SrTiO3 (entries 2 and 6) nanocrystal, reflecting that the exposure of anisotropic facets of the SrTiO3 nanocrystal is beneficial for improving the photocatalytic performance. Interestingly, when both Pt and Co3O4 are separately deposited on the anisotropic facets of 18-facet SrTiO3, the photocatalytic activity could be increased by 6 times compared with that of Pt–Co3O4/6-facet SrTiO3 (entries 4 and 8). A more than doubling of the activity was observed with dual-cocatalysts, Pt and Co3O4, compared with Pt deposition alone, suggesting a remarkable synergetic effect between the dual-cocatalysts on 18-facet SrTiO3 (entries 4, 6 and 8).
Nevertheless, almost no reaction was observed for the two types of SrTiO3 nanocrystals and with only Co3O4 deposited as the oxidation cocatalyst (entries 1, 3, 5 and 7), which suggests that proton reduction may be a rate-determining step for overall water splitting on SrTiO3 photocatalyst. To further understand this phenomenon, the band structures of 6-facet and 18-facet SrTiO3 were examined by Mott–Schottky measurements (Fig. 4a). Mott–Schottky analysis is known to be a powerful and widely used tool for the determination of capacitance, carrier density and flat band potential. The flat-band potential of the semiconductor could be extracted from the x-axis intersection.49 The flat band potentials of 6-facet and 18-facet SrTiO3 were measured to be almost identical, at approximately −0.14 and −0.13 V versus RHE, which is in good agreement with the reported values.50–52 The band gaps for the two types of SrTiO3 nanocrystals estimated from UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. 4b. The conduction band levels for proton reduction for the two types of SrTiO3 nanocrystals are very close, so the excess potential for proton reduction is limited but the valence band maximum is positive enough for water oxidation.53 This is why the overall water splitting performance can only be obviously improved after the reduction cocatalyst (Pt) was deposited, but almost no effect on the enhancement was observed when only the oxidation cocatalyst (Co3O4) was deposited.

To know how a high symmetry crystal exposed with isotropic and anisotropic facets influences the photogenerated charge separation, the apparent quantum efficiencies of overall water splitting are determined and shown in Table 1. The AQE of Pt–Co3O4/18-facet SrTiO3 was more than fivefold that of Pt–Co3O4/6-facet SrTiO3, which strongly suggests that the photogenerated charges can be more efficiently separated with the anisotropic facets assisted by dual-cocatalysts. The above results lead us to the conclusion that the difference in the photocatalytic activities of the two types of SrTiO3 nanocrystals can be essentially attributed to the enhancement of the photogenerated charge separation for 18-facet SrTiO3 with anisotropic facets exposed.
To determine the photogenerated charge separation efficiency on the two types of SrTiO3 nanocrystals, apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured with half reactions in the presence of AgNO3 or CH3OH as sacrificial agents (Table S2, ESI†). When electrons were efficiently consumed by Ag+, the AQE of water oxidation for the 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal was measured to be about 4 times that of 6-facet SrTiO3, from 3.4% to 12.2%, demonstrating that charge separation efficiency is greatly improved by tailoring the exposed facet from isotropic to anisotropic facets. The apparent quantum efficiencies of proton reduction for the two types of SrTiO3 nanocrystals were comparable, which is possibly because proton reduction is a thermodynamically rate-determining step for the SrTiO3 photocatalyst. In this case, holes can be consumed very quickly on the {110} facet by CH3OH molecular and 6-facet SrTiO3 remain a little more {001} facet than 18-facet SrTiO3. Therefore, the apparent quantum efficiency of 6-facet SrTiO3 is a little higher than 18-facet SrTiO3. When proton reduction was replaced by Ag+ reduction, the reduction reaction was no longer a limiting step and the AQE of water oxidation is close to its intrinsic value. In this case, the AQE of 18-facet SrTiO3 is much higher than that of 6-facet SrTiO3, which indicates that the exposed anisotropic facets play essential roles in photogenerated charge separation.
To further understand the synergetic effect between the spatial separation of the photogenerated charges and the redox active sites, the dual-cocatalysts were deposited selectively and randomly on the two types of SrTiO3 nanocrystals for comparison. Table S3 (ESI†) lists the photocatalytic overall water splitting activities of the 6-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal with cocatalysts deposited by different methods (P.D. for the photodeposition method, Imp. for the impregnation method). The location of the cocatalysts is schematically shown at the top of the table. The photocatalytic activities for all the cases of the 6-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal were comparable regardless of whether the cocatalysts were deposited using the impregnation or photodeposition method. This result could be attributed to the identical exposed facets and random distribution of the reduction and oxidation active sites on all the facets of 6-facet SrTiO3.
However, for the 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystal (results listed in Table 2) the photocatalytic activity of Pt (P.D.)/18-facet SrTiO3 was approximately 2 times that of Pt (Imp.)/18-facet SrTiO3 (entries 2 and 3). When only Co3O4 was deposited as the cocatalyst, regardless of the deposition method, almost no photocatalytic reaction was observed, possibly owing to the fact that proton reduction is the limiting step for the overall water splitting on SrTiO3 (entries 4 and 5). Compared with entries 3 and 7, we can observe that the photocatalytic activities of Pt (P.D.)–Co3O4 (Imp.)/18-facet SrTiO3 were lower than the photocatalytic activity of Pt (P.D.)/18-facet SrTiO3, which is very similar to the activities of Pt (Imp.)/18-facet SrTiO3 and Pt (Imp.)–Co3O4 (Imp.)/18-facet SrTiO3 (entries 2 and 8). Both results indicate that the photocatalytic activity decreases after depositing the Co3O4 cocatalyst by the impregnation method. A reasonable explanation is that the random deposition of catalysts can lead to the cocatalyst particles being located on the wrong sites (e.g., the oxidation cocatalysts on the reduction sites) so that the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers can take place once they are trapped by the cocatalysts. Compared with entries 2 and 6, we found that the activity decreases after the Co3O4 depositing. This may be possibly due to part of Co3O4 cocatalyst particles are located very close to the Pt cocatalyst so that the charge recombination is enhanced even when they are deposited by the P.D. method. When both dual-cocatalysts were deposited randomly, charge recombination becomes more severe (entry 8). Nevertheless, when both cocatalysts are deposited on the correct sites, the photocatalytic activity can be enhanced more than 10 times compared with those when both Pt and Co3O4 are randomly distributed (entries 8 and 9), showing a remarkable synergetic effect of the dual-cocatalysts. These observations prove that the cocatalysts are fully functioned only when they are located on the correct facets.

The difference between Table 2 and Table S3 (ESI†) leads to the conclusion that the superior performance of SrTiO3 with anisotropic exposed facets could be attributed to the enhancement of photogenerated charge separation between different facets and the spatial separation of the reduction and oxidation active sites for overall water splitting. We also choose two cases (entry 8 in Table 1 and the last one in Table S2, ESI†), and conducted the long-time reaction several times (Fig. S6, ESI†). The time-curve shows that both overall water splitting and half reactions occur almost linearly over time, and the y-intercept is near zero at the beginning of the reaction. Raw data of Tables 1 and 2 can be seen in Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, using a nanocrystal morphology tailoring strategy, we rationally designed and synthesized cubic SrTiO3 nanocrystals with morphology from isotropic facets to anisotropic facets. We found that the spatial separation of photo-reduction and photo-oxidation catalytic sites on SrTiO3 can only be achieved for 18-facet nanocrystals with anisotropic facets but not for 6-facet SrTiO3 with isotropic facets. Based on these findings, we rationally assembled dual-cocatalysts on the anisotropic facets of 18-facet SrTiO3 and a fivefold enhancement of apparent quantum efficiency in photocatalytic water splitting can be achieved. The superior performance can be attributed mainly to the spatial charge separation between anisotropic facets and the separation of the reduction and oxidation catalytic sites. These findings will be instructive for the rational design of highly efficient photocatalyst systems based on semiconductor nanocrystals for solar energy conversion.
Experimental
Materials
SrTiO3 nanocrystals were prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis method as previously reported.42 Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) aqueous solution was used as the titanium precursor and strontium chloride (SrCl2) aqueous solution was used as the strontium source. All chemicals used in our experiment were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Aqueous solutions were prepared using ultrapure water.
In a typical synthesis, 0.26 mL of TiCl4 was dropwise added into 25 mL of deionized water containing 2.0 g of methanol (1.0 g 1,2-propanediol) cooled in an ice bath. After stirring for 5 min, 30 mL of LiOH solution containing 4.0 g of LiOH H2O was added. After stirring for 30 min, 10 mL of SrTiO3 solution containing 0.7 g of SrCl2 6H2O was added. After stirring for another 30 min, the resultant solution was transferred to a homemade 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Subsequently, the autoclave was heated for 48 hours at 180 °C, and then it was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. Afterwards, the sample was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 8 min. Finally, the 6-facet (18-facet) SrTiO3 particles were centrifuged five times in deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, respectively, and dried at 80 °C for 12 hours.
Photo-deposition of noble metals and/or metal oxides
The photo-deposition of Pt (Au, Ag) was achieved with H2PtCl6 (HAuCl4, AgNO3) as the precursor. In a typical procedure, 50.0 mg of the SrTiO3 sample was suspended in 150 mL of deionized water. Then H2PtCl6 solution (1.37 mL, 0.73 mg mL−1) (HAuCl4: 0.22 mL, 4.55 mg mL−1; AgNO3: 1 mL, 1.00 mg mL−1) was added and the suspension was then irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (Ushio-CERMAXLX300) under constant stirring. After reaction for 2 hours, the suspension was centrifuged five times in deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, respectively, and dried at 70 °C for 12 hours in a vacuum oven.
The photo-deposition of Co3O4 (MnOx) was achieved with Co(NO3)2 (MnSO4) as the precursor, and NaIO3 was employed as the electron acceptor. In a typical procedure, 50.0 mg of the SrTiO3 sample was suspended in 150 mL of deionized water containing 4.0 g of NaIO3. Then 0.5 mL of Co(NO3)2 solution (2.00 mg mL−1) (MnSO4: 1 mL, 1.00 mg mL−1) was added and the suspension was then irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (Ushio-CERMAXLX300) under constant stirring. After 2 hours of photo-deposition, the suspension was centrifuged five times in deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, respectively, and dried at 70 °C for 12 hours in a vacuum oven.
Test of photocatalytic overall water splitting performances
Photocatalytic overall water splitting reactions were carried out in a closed gas circulation and evacuation system using a 300 W Xe lamp (Ushio-CERMAXLX300). Normally, 50.0 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 150 mL of deionized water in a Pyrex reaction cell. Before irradiation, the reaction system was thoroughly degassed by evacuation in order to drive off the air inside. The amount of evolved H2 and O2 was determined using an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent, GC-7890, TCD, Ar carrier). The rate of H2 and O2 evolution in the initial one hour was recorded for comparison. The amount of Pt cocatalyst was first optimized without the oxidation cocatalyst and the optimal Pt amount was 0.1 wt%. Under the conditions of the optimized Pt amount, different amounts of Co3O4 were deposited by photo-oxidation deposition. The optimal amount of Co3O4 was 0.01 wt%.
Characterization
The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray power diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/Max-2500/PC powder diffractometer. The sample power was scanned using Cu-Kα radiation with an operating voltage of 40 kV and a current of 200 mA. The scan rate of 5° min−1 was applied to record the patterns in the range of 20–80° at a step size of 0.02°. UV-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (JASCO V-650) equipped with an integrating sphere. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a VG ESCALAB MK2 spectrometer with monochromatized Al-Kα excitation, and the C 1s peak (284.6 eV) was used as the reference, arising from adventitious carbon. The morphologies and particle sizes were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Quanta 200 FEG scanning electron microscope. Ultra-high resolution scanning electron microscopy was carried out using a Hitachi high-technology S-5500 with an operating voltage of 40 kV. The CO adsorption of the samples was measured using a Quantachrome Instruments Autosorb-1. The HRTEM images were obtained on a Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin (FEI Company).
Mott–Schottky measurements
SrTiO3 thin film photoelectrodes are prepared by electrophoretic deposition of corresponding SrTiO3 samples on the FTO substrate. Electrophoretic deposition is carried out in acetone solution (70 mL) and iodine (30 mg). The FTO electrode is immersed parallel to the Pt electrode with a distance of 80 mm and a 40 V bias controlled by a potentiostat (ITECH IT6834) was applied for 3 min. SrTiO3 deposited electrodes are dried in the air at room temperature and subjected to calcination at 623 K for 30 min. Mott–Schottky experiments are carried out on a three-electrode electrochemical setup using 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte. The SrTiO3 deposited electrode, the platinum electrode and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) are used as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively.

Broader context
Solar energy has the advantages of being clean, abundant and renewable. Therefore, solar energy to hydrogen energy conversion using photocatalytic water splitting is one of the promising methods to tackle serious energy and environmental problems. Charge separation and surface catalytic reactions are of great significance to enhance the efficiency of solar energy conversion. Cocatalysts can serve as the active sites and catalyze the water splitting reactions. Traditionally, cocatalysts are randomly loaded on photocatalysts by an impregnation or adsorption method. In this case, cocatalysts are possibly deposited on the wrong sites (e.g., the reduction cocatalyst is deposited on the hole-transferred site or the oxidation cocatalyst is deposited on the electron-transferred site), which leads to the increase of the recombination of charge carriers. Using a nanocrystal morphology tailoring strategy, we rationally synthesized high symmetry SrTiO3 nanocrystals from isotropic facets (6-facet SrTiO3) to anisotropic facets (18-facet SrTiO3). The spatial separation of charge and selective distribution of active sites can be achieved on different facets of 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals, which leads to a remarkable enhancement of apparent quantum efficiency compared to 6-facet SrTiO3. These findings will be instructive for the rational design of a high efficiency photocatalytic system for solar energy conversion.
