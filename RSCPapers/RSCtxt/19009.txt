    , Accepted 18th November 2014First published on 19th November 2014AbstractThere is a growing interest in the conversion of water and solar energy into clean and renewable H2 fuels using earth-abundant materials due to the depletion of fossil fuel and its serious environmental impact. This critical review highlights some key factors influencing the efficiency of heterogeneous semiconductors for solar water splitting (i.e. improved charge separation and transfer, promoted optical absorption, optimized band gap position, lowered cost and toxicity, and enhanced stability and water splitting kinetics). Moreover, different engineering strategies, such as band structure engineering, micro/nano engineering, bionic engineering, co-catalyst engineering, surface/interface engineering of heterogeneous semiconductors are summarized and discussed thoroughly. The synergistic effects of the different engineering strategies, especially for the combination of co-catalyst loading and other strategies seem to be more promising for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts. A thorough understanding of electron and hole transfer thermodynamics and kinetics at the fundamental level is also important for elucidating the key efficiency-limiting step and designing highly efficient solar-to-fuel conversion systems. In this review, we provide not only a summary of the recent progress in the different engineering strategies of heterogeneous semiconductors for solar water splitting, but also some potential opportunities for designing and optimizing solar cells, photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 and pollutant degradation, and electrocatalysts for water splitting.Xin LiXin Li received his BS and PhD degrees in Chemical Engineering from Zhengzhou University in 2002 and South China University of Technology in 2007, respectively.

1. Introduction
The depletion of fossil fuels and the disastrous environmental pollution arising from their combustion have been recognized as two main challenges in the near future.1 At present, exhaustible fossil fuels account for ∼80% of the total world energy supply.2 Furthermore, the combustion of fossil fuels can also result in global warming and frightening climatic consequences due to the greenhouse effect. Therefore, in order to face various energy challenges in this century, there is an urgent need to develop a clean, renewable, cheap and sustainable source of energy to replace fossil fuels and meet the increased energy demand. Fortunately, the average rate of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface is about 10000 times larger than the current rate of worldwide energy utilization by humans.1,3 Solar energy is a free, clean, non-polluting, decentralized and inexhaustible natural resource, and thus has long been considered one of the most promising renewable energy sources to effectively address the world's energy problems. Because the solar electricity produced by photovoltaics is still very expensive and hard to store for fairly long periods of time and distribute over long distances, the efficient and inexpensive conversion of solar energy into chemical energy such as hydrogen energy has been considered to be a highly desirable way to satisfy long-term energy needs.4
Hydrogen is also a regenerative and environmentally friendly fuel of the future since its combustion generates only water, and thus it has received a great deal of attention by scientists over the past three decades.5,6 It is generally accepted that H2 can become an alternative to classical fossil fuels, but only if it is also produced by a sustainable energy. However, at present, the large-scale production of H2 in a sustainable manner is still one of the major challenges, because H2 is mainly produced from fossil fuels by steam reforming of natural gas or high-energy consumption processes, which are not environmentally friendly and economic.7 Thus, it is highly expected that H2 can be generated through the most promising and economic pathways, especially, using a source of renewable energy.
Photocatalytic (PC) or photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting (WS) into H2 and O2 using solar energy and semiconductors (SCs) is a promising way to solve both the solar energy storage and green production of H2 fuel. It is usually called artificial photosynthesis (APS) because these reactions are similar to those in natural photosynthesis. So far, APS has received more and more attention and it has been regarded as one of the most important challenges in the coming decades.8,9 The key reactions in APS, which are water reduction and oxidation,4 have been extensively studied since the pioneering works by Honda and Fujishima.10 Compared to the two-electron H2-evolution reaction (HER), the O2-evolution reaction (OER) is comparatively more complex because this reaction requires a four-electron oxidation of two water molecules coupled to the removal of four protons to form a relatively weak oxygen–oxygen bond.11 The decisive factor of energy storage in APS gives the efficiency of the SCs.
So far, many different heterogeneous12–14 and homogeneous15 SCs have been developed and extensively studied in PC and PEC WS over the past three decades. Compared to homogeneous SCs, heterogeneous SCs have received more attention due to their further advantages and wider range of potential applications.12,16,17 Furthermore, a large number of visible-light-driven SCs (such as BiVO4,18 Ta3N5,19 TaON,20 GaN:ZnO solid solution,21 CoO,22 Ag3PO423 and C3N424) have also been discovered in recent years. However, most of them still have a poor efficiency and stability for practical photosynthetic WS. To some extent, it still remains a great challenge to develop highly stable and efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts for WS, and thus overall WS under visible light had been once described as one of the “Holy Grails” of chemistry.16 It is well accepted that no single SC material can meet all the requirements (a suitable band gap (1.8–2.4 eV), matching energy band for H2 and O2 evolution, high quantum efficiency and stability) for PC and PEC applications.25 Therefore, besides the continuous development of new visible-light-driven SCs, it is also of significant importance to enhance their selectivity, stability and activity for WS under visible light irradiation through the modification of existing SCs. In recent years, many great achievements in engineering SC-based photocatalysts have been made, and a series of new engineering strategies have emerged recently. Although there are also some excellent reviews regarding one or several strategies,13,26,27 most of them paid more attention to the utilization of the oxidation of toxic pollutants.27,28 So far, there is still no a review towards systemically introducing these strategies in the application of both PC and PEC WS from the viewpoint of engineering strategies. We believe that a new and comprehensive review on this subject would not only promote the further design and development of highly efficient and stable photocatalysts for PC and PEC WS, but also provide a good reference and inspire new ideas to engineer SC-based photocatalysts for energy and environmental applications. Here, the focus will be on the different engineering strategies for enhancing the selectivity, stability and efficiencies of heterogeneous photocatalysts for PEC and PC WS. By studying the different design strategies, it may open a new opportunity for designing highly effective photocatalysts for PC and PEC H2- and O2-evolution half reactions as well as overall WS.
2. Fundamentals of solar water splitting
2.1 Thermodynamics of solar water splitting
The overall WS reaction is composed of two half-reactions, the HER (eqn (1)) and OER (eqn (2)). The free energy ΔG and the standard redox potential ΔE0 of the multi-electron WS are given in eqn (3). Thermodynamically, the WS reaction (eqn (3)) is an uphill reaction because of a large positive change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG0 = +237.2 kJ mol−1). It is also known that the OER (eqn (2)) is an essential component of light-driven WS systems, which provides protons and electrons for the production of hydrogen. 2H+ + 2e− → H2(g) ΔE0 = −0.41 V(1) 2H2O(l) → O2(g) + 4H+ + 4e− ΔE0 = +0.82 V(2) H2O(l) → H2(g) + 1/2O2(g)ΔG0 = +237.2 kJ mol−1 ΔE0 = 1.23 V(3)
The fundamental principle of solar WS for SC photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, the electrons can be excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of the SC under light irradiation of suitable wavelengths, leaving holes in the VB. These electrons and holes can then transfer to the surfaces of the photocatalysts and initiate the HER and OER, respectively. Therefore, to achieve overall WS, the matching of the CB and VB levels of the photocatalyst with the redox potential of the HER and OER is very important. From the viewpoint of thermodynamics, the bottoms of the CB must be located at a more negative potential than the reduction potential of H+ to H2 (−0.41 V vs. NHE at pH 7), while the top of the VB must exceed the oxidation potential of H2O to O2 (0.82 V vs. NHE). Thus, the minimum band gap energy (Eg) of the photocatalyst should be 1.23 eV (1000 nm) to convert the energy into H2 and O2. In addition, due to the energy losses, kinetic overpotentials are needed to drive the HER (ΔEH in Fig. 1) and the OER (ΔEO in Fig. 1), and thus the Eg of a single SC material should lie in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 eV.4,29

Furthermore, it is known that the CB potential of a SC material in aqueous solutions usually exhibits a pH dependence described according to eqn (4).30–32 ECB = E0CB(pH = 0) −0.059 pH(4)
Interestingly, the redox potentials of water also have the same linear pH dependence with a slope of 0.059 V per pH, leading to no change in the overpotentials of photogenerated charges for water redox at different pH values.32 Besides pH dependence, it should be noted that sulfide ions which are stabilizers in aqueous solutions can also cause a cathodic shift of the flatband potential (Efb) of CdS by ca. −60 mV/log[S2−], as given by eqn (5).33,34 Efb(vs. NHE, pH = 7) = −1.16 − 0.06log[S2−](5)
This favorable Efb shift of CdS in solutions just containing S2− leads to an enhanced overpotential for H2 production. However, the decreased photoactivity of CdS towards H2 production was observed due to the formation of S2−2, which has a strong light absorption and a less negative reduction potential than the protons. Fortunately, the formation of S2−2 was found to be suppressed via adding reducing agents such as SO3−2. Therefore, a S2−/SO3−2 mixture has been widely used to enhance the photoactivity of sulfide SCs for H2 generation.34
2.2 Materials for solar water splitting
So far, several hundreds of SCs have been found to be capable of producing H2 or/and O2 from WS under light irradiation.12,13,35 The composition elements and their roles in these heterogeneous SCs for solar hydrogen generation or WS are summarized in Fig. 2. Among the various kinds of metal-based photocatalysts, metal cations with d0 or d10 electronic configurations have been usually used to construct CBs, whereas their VBs are usually composed of non-metal elements, such as N, O, S and Se (Fig. 2).17 Furthermore, the platinum-group elements (including Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt, Ag and Au) are good candidates for H2-evolution or O2-evolution co-catalysts; especially, Ag and Au nanoparticles, which also have an additional role in the enhancement of the H2-production rate under visible light irradiation, due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects induced by the collective oscillations of the conduction electrons.9,36,37 In addition, the first-row transition metals and their oxides such as Cr, Co, Ni, Mn, Fe and Cu, have been recognized as good earth-abundant co-catalysts for PC hydrogen generation.38,39 Some alkali and alkaline earth ions could only be applied in the construction of the crystal structure in perovskite compounds or layered structures.12
 Fig. 2  Elements and their roles in semiconductor-based photocatalysts for solar WS. 
Many types of representative photocatalysts for solar WS are summarized in Table 1. Among these photocatalysts, TiO2 is the most studied photocatalyst for WS because it is stable, non-corrosive, environmentally friendly, abundant and inexpensive. However, the large band gap (∼3.2 eV) of TiO2 limits its utilization of the solar spectrum to only the UV region. Thus, more and more visible-light photocatalysts have been developed over the past few decades (as shown in Table 1). The band edge positions of some visible-light photocatalysts are also presented in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, there are many SCs (i.e. CdSe, CdS, Ta3N5, TaON, C3N4 and SiC) with suitable band positions for solar overall WS into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Although CdS,152 TaON66 and Ta3N566,71 possess narrow band gaps for visible light absorption and sufficiently negative CB potentials for water reduction, they are not stable in aqueous environments due to photocorrosion. Furthermore, some visible-light photocatalysts with very positive VB potentials (i.e., WO3, Fe2O3 and BiVO4) can only be applied in the solar water oxidation half-reaction due to their unsuitable CB positions for water reduction, whereas some SCs with small band gaps (i.e., Si, Bi2S3, GaAs, Cu2O and GaP) are only suitable for the solar water reduction half-reaction because of their unsuitable VB positions for water oxidation. However, these two kinds of photocatalysts could be also used in overall WS through the construction of Z-scheme photocatalyst systems.

Moreover, it is well accepted that co-catalysts play very important roles in enhancing the PC activity for solar WS. Various kinds of co-catalysts are also summarized in Table 1. So far, it is known that Pt and Pd are two of the best co-catalysts for the HER, whereas RuO2 and IrO2 are two of the best co-catalysts for the OER. They can be easily identified from OER and HER “volcano” relation plots.4 Unfortunately, they are all composed of precious metal elements which are too scarce and expensive, thus seriously prohibiting their wide-scale development for commercial energy production. Hence, much effort has been directed towards the development of environmentally friendly, inexpensive, highly active and earth-abundant co-catalysts for the HER and OER, which remains a major challenge towards the conversion of solar energy into H2 energy in a sustainable manner.
These earth-abundant co-catalysts could be divided into two types: HER and OER co-catalysts in PC and PEC systems, which are shown in Fig. 4. Clearly, metal oxides,21,107–109 and hydroxides118,119,122,123,153 can act as both HER and OER co-catalysts. Furthermore, earth-abundant metal carbides,141,149 phosphides,130,133,136 sulphides91,99,154 and alloys84,89 have been found to be good HER co-catalysts in recent years, whereas, metal phosphates,11,146 borates143,144 and oxyhydroxides125–127 are the famous OER co-catalysts. For example, the famous MoS293 and Nocera's Co-Pi11,233 have been extensively investigated as HER and OER co-catalysts, respectively. In addition, the development of composite earth-abundant co-catalysts deserves more attention. For more details about the various kinds of co-catalysts, readers are invited to refer to the recent review.155

In future, the combination of earth-abundant visible-light photocatalysts and co-catalysts should be one of the most promising directions in the solar WS. Thus, it is highly expected that new earth-abundant co-catalysts and visible-light photocatalysts should be continuously developed through different technologies. At this point, combinatorial approaches156,157 and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations158 may provide potential opportunities to develop visible-light photocatalysts with optimized band gaps and band positions for solar WS. Furthermore, the matching performances and charge transfer mechanisms between photocatalysts and co-catalysts also deserve more attention in future studies.
2.3 Evaluation of a photocatalyst and its photocatalytic activity

2.3.1 Band gap. 
The Eg of a SC can be calculated by the Tauc analysis, shown in eqn (6).159,160 The Eg values can be determined from the intercept of the straight-line portion in the plot of (ahν)2/nversus energy (hν). Ahν = k(ahν − Eg)n/2(6)where α, h, ν and k are absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, light frequency and a constant, respectively. In addition, n is a constant determined by the type of optical transition of a SC, which is equal to 1 for a direct-gap material, and 4 for an indirect-gap material.


2.3.2 Band edge positions. 
The positions of the CB and VB for each photocatalyst could be calculated using the following empirical formulas (eqn (7) and (8))31 ECB = X − Ec − 1/2Eg(7) EVB = ECB + Eg(8)where X is the absolute electronegativity of an atom in a SC, expressed as the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the constituent atoms, which is defined as the arithmetic mean of the atomic electro affinity and the first ionization energy; Ec is the energy of free electrons of the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV); ECB is the CB potential and EVB is the VB potential.
Besides, for an intrinsic SC, the difference between the CB and Fermi levels is expressed by the following eqn (9)74 ECB = Efb − kBTln(Nc/Nd)(9)where Nd is the effective state density, Nc is the carrier density including the accumulated electrons, Efb is the flat band potential, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Generally, Efb can be determined by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plot, the linear variation of C−2 against potential follows eqn (10) for an n-type SC161,162 C−2 = [2/(εsε0eND)][E − Efb − (KBT/e)](10)where C is the interfacial capacitance, εs is the dielectric constant of the SC, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, e is the electronic charge, ND is the donor density, and E is the applied potential.
The Efb of the SC–electrolyte interface can be obtained from the intercept on the potential axis, whereas the slope of the straight line is related to the carrier concentration. In general, ECB is more negative by about −0.1 or −0.2 V than the Efb for many n-type SCs, while the EVB is about 0.1 or 0.2 V below the Efb for many p-type SCs.31
In addition, the VB level of a given SC can be also measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)163 or the valence band X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS).164 Then, the CB level can be estimated from the VB level according to eqn (8).


2.3.3 Lifetime of photogenerated carriers. 
A good water-splitting photocatalyst or photoelectrode must efficiently transport photo-generated minority charge carriers to the surface active sites to carry out the reactions of WS. Thus, the lifetime and transport of the photo-generated charge carriers are important factors influencing the overall efficiency. They can be estimated by time-resolved technologies such as time-resolved fluorescence emission decay spectra,165,166 time-resolved infrared absorption measurements73 and transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy.165,167


2.3.4 Evaluation of activity. 
The PC and PEC activity for WS can be directly evaluated by the H2 or O2 gas evolution rate (μmol h−1 or μmol h−1 gcatalyst−1) and photocurrent density (mA cm−2), respectively. For PC systems, two important points (the time course and stoichiometry of H2 and O2 evolution) should be taken into account for the evaluation of activity. In addition, the applied potential (for PEC systems), wavelength and intensity of incident light should also be provided when performing an evaluation of activity.
However, the gas evolution rate and photocurrent density are strongly dependent on the detailed experimental procedures and conditions. Thus, in order to compare the activity of photocatalysts under different reaction conditions, it is important to determine the overall quantum yield (QY) or apparent quantum yields (AQY) of a given photocatalyst for solar WS. They are usually defined by eqn (11) and (12), respectively. (11) (12)
In general, the obtained quantum yield is usually the AQY because it is difficult to determine the real number of absorbed photons by a SC in a PC or PEC system due to light scattering.12
Similarly, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) or incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) in a PEC system describes the ratio of “effective photons” or generated charges that generate electrochemical current at the SC electrolyte interface to “incident photons” of monochromatic light. It is calculated as a function of the output photocurrent density (Iph, A cm−2) and incident light power density (Pin, W cm−2) at each wavelength λ (nm), as given by eqn (13).168 IPCE(%) = 1240[Iph/(λPin)]100(13)where Iph is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) at the measured bias, λ is the wavelength (nm) of incident radiation, and Pin is the incident light power intensity on the SC electrode (mW cm−2).
However, due to the presence of light reflection or transmission, the number of photons absorbed is generally less than that of incident photons. Thus, it is better to calculate the efficiency according to the number of photons absorbed. It is known that the absorbance of a thin film sample at wavelength λ (Aλ) can be determined directly through UV-vis spectroscopy in terms of Beer's Law, as given by eqn (14)29 Aλ = −log[I/I0](14)where I is the measured output light intensity, and I0 is the initial input light intensity. Then, the ηabs (light harvesting efficiency) can be calculated according to eqn (15) ηabs = [(I0 − I)/I0] = 1–10−Aλ(15)
Thus, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) or absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE), which defines the efficiency of a PEC device in terms of collected photocurrent per absorbed photon, can be determined by the portion of actual “absorbed photons” by a SC, as shown by eqn (16). APCE(%) = [IPCE/ηabs] = [IPCE/(1–10−Aλ)](16)
Clearly, the value of IPCE is usually smaller than that of the APCE because the ηabs is always less than 100%.
In addition, if the amount of hydrogen evolved in the PEC cells could be measured, the solar-to-hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination can be calculated according to eqn (17). (17)
If the amount of hydrogen evolved cannot be directly measured, the STH can also be calculated through the voltage, current, and the faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution (ηF), which is the so-called solar conversion efficiency (ηc) of a PEC system, as defined by eqn (18).4,169 ηc = STH = [Iph × (1.23-Vbias) × ηF/Pin]AM 1.5G(18)
Generally, a true ηc should be measured in a two-electrode cell. Especially, if the Vbias is zero, Iph is the short-circuit photocurrent density (jSC, mA cm−2). Thus, ηc can also be calculated according to eqn (19). ηc = STH = [jSC × 1.23 × ηF/Pin]AM 1.5G(19)
Furthermore, assuming 100% Faradaic efficiency, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) could then be obtained using a J–V curve in a two-electrode system, as shown in eqn (20): ABPE (%) = [Iph(1.23-Vbias)/Pin]AM 1.5G(20)
Lastly, the turnover number (TON) for H2 generation is usually defined by the number of reacted molecules to that of an active site, as given by eqn (21). (21)
Similarly, the turnover frequency (TOF) for H2 generation is defined by the number of reacted molecules per second to that of an active site, as shown by eqn (22). (22)
It should be noted that the TOF and TON are usually used in molecular systems. However, it is often difficult to evaluate SC photocatalysts using these equations since their active sites cannot be accurately determined.12 Alternatively, in SC systems, the TON can be calculated according to eqn (23) or (24). (23) (24)
Clearly, the TON in eqn (23) and (24) are generally smaller than the real TON in eqn (21) due to the larger number of atoms compared to that of real active sites.12


2.3.5 Photocatalytic stability. 
Many SCs such as CdS, Cu2O and Ta3N5 are not stable under light illumination because of extensive photocorrosion. Thus, it is necessary to investigate photostability because a practical photocatalyst must be highly efficient and stable. In most cases, a long-time experiment or a repeated experiment should be carried out under light illumination.

2.4 Systems for solar water splitting
In addition to developing novel SCs and co-catalysts for solar WS, the construction of various operating systems is also an efficient strategy to further enhance the overall efficiency for solar WS. WS systems are summarized in Fig. 5 according to the different properties of the SCs in its systems. Generally, there are two kinds of systems for solar WS: PC WS systems (including half-reaction and overall WS systems) and PEC water-splitting systems (including single-photoelectrode and dual-photoelectrode systems).
 Fig. 5  Summary of the different systems for solar water splitting. 
In general, PEC WS systems could be easily achieved with the help of an external electric field, which usually exhibit relatively high efficiency for solar WS.4 Some famous systems for PEC WS are summarized in Table 2. As observed in Table 2, multi-junction PEC cells and nanostructured Si photoelectrodes can offer very high solar conversion efficiencies (even >10% in some cases) in comparison with those of other PEC cells. However, these cells are expensive and unstable in practical applications. Thus, it is of great importance to decrease the fabrication cost of these cells by developing a new method to prepare crystalline silicon170 and enhance their photostabilities through loading suitable protective layers.89,171,172 Furthermore, WO3, Fe2O3 and BiVO4 photoelectrodes exhibit very high activities and stabilities for PEC water oxidation under AM 1.5G illumination, due to their much narrower band gaps and more positive VB potentials. When considering the abundance, cost and safety, Fe2O3 looks much more promising for the application of PEC WS. However, more effort should be paid to further enhance the PEC activity of Fe2O3-based cells. In addition, Ta3N5 and Cu2O are also promising, but their stabilities are very poor. Accordingly, future work should focus on improving the photostabilities of Ta3N5 and Cu2O photoelectrodes.62,173 Besides the development of new SCs materials or highly efficient and stable composite SCs for PEC WS, it is also a promising direction to construct unbiased or self-biased PEC systems by combing different photoelectrodes or solar cells for highly efficient solar WS.174–177

Compared to PEC WS systems, PC WS systems are the most studied ones due to their simple operation and low cost. Some famous systems for PC WS are summarized in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, it is observed that the quantum efficiencies of overall WS systems are much lower than those of half-reaction WS systems due to the uphill nature of the overall WS reaction, especially under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of solar energy conversion and utilization, the water reduction half reaction is more important than that of water oxidation because hydrogen is an important energy carrier in future. Thus, more effort has been made in PC H2-generation half-reaction (water reduction) systems. However, it should be noted that they are not real overall WS reactions due to the presence of sacrificial reagents.

Furthermore, PC overall WS systems can be divided into two types: one-photon systems and Z-scheme systems. It is generally accepted that one-photon overall WS systems under visible light are the greatest challenge in the fields of WS. So far, only a few excellent photocatalyst systems such as (Ga0.82Zn0.18)(N0.82O0.18) loaded by Rh2−xCrxO3 (5.9% of QY at 420–440 nm) and nanostructured CoO (STH = 5%) have been reported in which visible-light overall WS was achieved.22,234 Alternatively, the Z-scheme system cannot only enlarge the application of photocatalysts with improper band positions in overall WS, but also efficiently separate the active sites of H2 and O2 evolution, thus suppressing the undesirable surface back reactions (SBA) to form water from the H2 and O2 evolved. Thus, the Z-scheme system has been intensively investigated and widely used in the field of overall WS, which will be summarized in Section 3.3.3.
In addition, it is also observed from Tables 2 and 3 that the high activities for solar WS were generally achieved through the combination of different engineering strategies, such as loading co-catalysts, constructing solid solutions and heterostructures. Thus, besides the development of novel systems, the optimization of the existing SC photocatalysts through different engineering strategies also seems to be important, which could help us better understand underlying mechanisms and rate-limiting steps, thus leading to the continually enhanced efficiency of solar WS. In other words, all these systems and their corresponding engineering strategies deserve more attention in future studies.
2.5 Mechanism and kinetics of solar water splitting
Although there are significant differences in the design and operation of the above mentioned systems for PC WS reactions, the SCs in the different systems usually possess similar PC processes under light irradiation. A thorough understanding of PC processes is beneficial for the development and design of highly efficient photocatalysts. The detailed mechanism of PC overall WS on heterogeneous SCs has been studied since the Honda–Fujishima effect of water photolysis using a PEC cell composed of Pt and TiO2 electrodes was discovered in 1972.10 Especially, PC overall WS using SC particles has received much attention since Bard extended the principles of PEC cells to suspended SC particle systems.315–317 It is generally accepted that the PC properties of SC particles come from the production of photo-generated charge carriers on their surface.318,319 Typically, the main processes in the PC overall WS reaction are illustrated in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, overall WS on a SC photocatalyst occurs in the following steps.
 Fig. 6  Processes in PC WS. WRC, water reduction co-catalysts; WOC, water oxidation co-catalysts; SBR, surface back reaction. 
The first step (i) is the generation of excited charges (e−–h+ pairs) in the SC particles by light absorption. As shown in eqn (25), SCs can be excited only when the wavelength of incident light is smaller than a threshold wavelength,159 thus the utilization of solar energy is strongly dependent on the Eg of a SC. As a result, to enhance the PC efficiency of wide-band-gap SCs and utilize visible light, one important strategy is to make their band gap smaller than 3.0 eV (λ > 415 nm) through band gap engineering. λ(nm) ≤ 1240/Eg(eV)(25)
The second step (ii) in Fig. 6 shows the separation of photo-excited carriers and their migration to the surface without recombination, whereas step (iii) represents the recombination of the excited charge carriers in the bulk, which is a competition process of step (ii). Generally, to reduce step (iii), the transfer distance of photoinduced charge carriers to the surface reaction sites can be shortened through the micro/nano engineering of SCs. Meanwhile, surface/interface engineering strategies also play a very important role in improving the photo-generated charge transfer and separation. In addition, the intrinsic material parameters, such as electrical conductivity, carrier mobility, excited state lifetimes, crystal structure, crystallinity and defect concentrations can also be improved by bulk doping/solid solution engineering.
Steps (v) and (vi) in Fig. 6 include the trapping of excited charge carriers by water oxidation and reduction co-catalysts and their driven OER and HER processes on the surface of the co-catalysts, respectively, while step (iv) displays the recombination of the excited charge carriers on the surface, which is the main competition process of steps (v) and (vi). Because the slow kinetics for the HER and OER are the important bottlenecks in the PC WS, it is usually necessary to load suitable amounts of co-catalysts onto the surface of a SC through co-catalyst engineering. Furthermore, co-catalysts can enhance the photostability of the SC. In addition, proper surface modification seems to be also very important to enhance the PC activity for WS.
Unfortunately, the co-catalysts also have different roles in accelerating the undesirable surface back reaction (SBR). The final step (vii) describes the SBR including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the recombination reaction of H2 and O2, which generally has a negative effect on PC WS. As seen in eqn (26), the SBR could easily proceed thermodynamically because of a large negative ΔG0 value. Moreover, since the photoadsorption of O2 is usually observed on the surface of a semiconductor material,319 the ORR involved in fuel cell cathodes and PC degradation of pollutants can also occur through a 4e− (eqn (27)) or a 2e− (eqn (28) and (29)) pathway. Thus, the surface of both photocatalysts and co-catalysts should be carefully designed to suppress the SBR and speed up the forward reactions through surface/interface engineering strategies. 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O ΔG0 = −237.2 kJ mol−1E0 = 1.23 V(26) O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O E0 = 1.229 V(27) O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2E0 = 0.67 V(28) H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → 2H2O E0 = 1.77 V(29)
However, the process of PEC WS is quite different from that of PC WS (Fig. 7). It is clear that the photo-generated electrons at the photoanode can easily migrate to the back contact, and then to the counter electrode (usually Pt) to produce hydrogen with the aid of an external bias applied on the PEC set-ups. Thus, the surface recombination of the excited charges and SBR are much lower because electrons and holes react with water at two spatially separated electrodes, which is the main advantage of the PEC route. Despite the difference between PC and PEC WS, the important factors in both systems, such as the fast volume recombination of electrons and holes during migration, poor kinetics of WS and photocorrosion are essentially the same. As a result, many strategies applied in PC WS can also play crucial roles in enhancing the PEC activity for WS. Here, we will discuss the application of these engineering strategies in both PEC and PC WS.
 Fig. 7  Processes in PEC WS. WOC, water oxidation co-catalysts; SC, semiconductor. 
Photosynthetic reactions are determined primarily by all the processes during WS, such as light-harvesting processes, charge generation and separation/migration, surface catalytic reaction processes and SBR.320,321 In other words, the solar energy conversion efficiency (ηc) is strongly dependent on the cumulative effect of the efficiency in all the processes, including light absorption efficiency (ηabs), charge separation efficiency (ηcs), charge migration and transport efficiency (ηcmt), and charge utilization efficiency (ηcu) for H2 generation. The relationship between them could be expressed according to eqn (30): ηc = ηabs × ηcs × ηcmt × ηcu(30)
Therefore, to design highly efficient photocatalysts for PC H2 evolution, all of these typical processes must be comprehensively considered and optimized. The current bottleneck in photocatalysis lies in its low quantum yield, which is strongly affected by the fast surface and bulk recombination of the electron–hole pairs and the SBR. In addition, the stability of photocatalysts is also very important for enhancing the PC activity.17 So far, the efficiency improvement of solar WS is one of the most challenging tasks in photocatalysis. It is clear that the overall efficiency for solar WS strongly depends on the balance of thermodynamics and kinetics of these processes, which is influenced by the bulk and surface properties and electronic structure of a photocatalyst. The important factors influencing the efficiency of solar WS and the corresponding engineering strategies are summarized in Fig. 8. As observed in Fig. 8, a good photocatalyst must be efficient, stable, safe, cheap and visible. To achieve these aims, many processes play important roles and must be taken into account, such as improved charge separation and transfer, promoted optical absorption, optimized band gap position, lowered cost and toxicity of photocatalyst and enhanced surface reaction kinetics for water oxidation and reduction. Therefore, the possible strategies to enhance the overall efficiency, including band structure engineering, micro/nano engineering, bionic engineering, co-catalyst engineering, surface and interface engineering, will be discussed in detail in the next section.

3. Strategies for engineering heterogeneous semiconductors
3.1 Band gap engineering
Generally, the optimization of band gaps can be achieved through introducing structural defects or chemical impurities into the lattices of a SC, which not only tunes its electrical conductivity, such as the electron concentration, mobility and lifetime of the carriers, but also narrows its band gap and makes it active under visible light.322,323

In most cases, proper dopants not only enhance the absorption of visible light due to the formation of localized or delocalized electronic states,324,325 but also enhance the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs.326 In addition, multiple impurities in a small confined NC can enhance disorder effects, thus altering the electronic structure via a quantum confined Urbach tail mechanism.325 So far, doping with metal cations, non-metal anions or non-metal molecules has been extensively studied in the fields of WS during the past few decades.
On the one hand, light metal-ion dopants (with a lower dopant content) can introduce localized electronic states, such a donor level above the VB (Fig. 9a) or an acceptor level below the CB (Fig. 9b) in the forbidden band of wide band gap photocatalysts (such as TiO2 and others), which can narrow their band gaps and thus greatly enhance their PC activity under visible light irradiation. TiO2 is the most investigated photocatalyst with a wide band gap, whose doping by different metal ions has been summarized in the previous reviews in detail.12,13,327 In general, La3+, Rh5+, Cr3+, Zn2+, Sb5+, Nb5+, Rh3+ and Ta5+ cations can be used to create an acceptor level below the CB, thus leading to enhanced photoactivity towards H2 evolution, whereas the donor level above the VB could be formed through the doping of Pb2+, Rh3+, Bi3+, Sn2+, Ag+ and Ni2+ cations.13 Furthermore, metal-ion dopants such as Cu causes significant changes in the exposed facets and crystal phases of TiO2 films, thus improving its PC activity for H2 evolution from WS.328 However, such trap sites introduced by metal-ion doping can also act as recombination centers for photo-excited charge carriers, generally leading to a significant decrease in PC activity under UV-vis irradiation.323,324,329 Thus, the optimized concentration of dopant atoms incorporated is very crucial for achieving high activity for WS.
 Fig. 9  Donor level (a), acceptor level (b) and mid-gap states (c) formed by metal ion doping. 
On the other hand, heavy dopants (with a sufficiently high dopant content) can achieve multiphoton excitation of a wide band gap SC through the formation of band of delocalized states in the middle of the band gap (the intermediate band or mid-gap states), as depicted in Fig. 9c.324,325 For example, Sn doping introduces a partially filled intermediate band in the forbidden band gap of CuGaS2 or CuInS2, which is further demonstrated by photoluminescence and DFT calculations.230 The resulting thin-film CuIn0.96Sn0.04S2 photoelectrode exhibits an improved PEC activity with a photocurrent density of 3.52 mA cm−2 at 0 VAg/AgCl, due to the formation of the intermediate band located 0.8 eV above its valance band maximum. More interestingly, some intrinsic mid-gap states in undoped single-phase photocatalysts (such as PbS and CuB2O4) are even observed.330,331 Importantly, it was revealed that the presence of the mid-gap states in the films of PbS nanocrystals played important roles in promoting the charge transport in dark and photo-conductivity under light illumination.331 However, it should be noted that only mid-gap states with suitable positions and powerful enough redox potentials for WS reactions could improve the absorption of visible light and enhance PC activity. Thus, a deep understanding of the roles of mid-gap states in solar WS is highly expected in future studies.
Here, more attention will be paid to the metal-ion doping of some potential visible-light-driven photocatalysts. For narrow band gap photocatalysts, metal ion doping can improve their electronic structure, such as the mobility of charge carriers and electrical conductivity, which can promote the transport and separation of charge carriers and thus greatly enhance their PC and PEC activity. It is known that the Ni doping (10%) of InTaO4 can significantly enhance its visible-light activity for WS due to the formation of the Ni 3d level in the forbidden band.60 Recently, many doped photocatalysts with enhanced water oxidation activity have also been reported, such as W doped BaTaO2N,332 Ba-doped Ta3N5 nanorod photoanode,199 W–Mo co-doped BiVO4,333 and Ta or Ti doped Fe2O3 photoanode.217,334 Therefore, the alkali and d0 metal cations look promising as dopants for the modification of visible-light-driven photocatalysts.
Meanwhile, since nitrogen-doped TiO2335 were successfully applied in the fields of photocatalysis, nitrogen doping of TiO2-based SCs is by far the most popular procedure to enhance their PC performance under visible light. However, there is a lively debate on the root causes of the red shift of the absorption onset of nitrogen doped TiO2 to the visible region. To date, five possible schemes have been proposed: (1) narrowing of the band gap resulting from the broadening of the VB (Fig. 10a); (2) introduction of localized states above the VB (Fig. 10b); (3) introduction of localized states below the CB (Fig. 10c); (4) formation of color centres in the band gap (Fig. 10d); and (5) sensitization by compounds containing nitrogen species (Fig. 10e).327,336 Even so, in most cases, nitrogen doping is an efficient strategy to enhance the visible-light activity of wide-band-gap SCs. For instance, nitrogen doped Sr2Ta2O7−xNx, anatase TiO2 sheets and ZnO nanowire arrays exhibited increased visible light absorption and improved activities for WS under visible light irradiation, as compared to a pure sample without nitrogen doping.337–339 However, it should be noted that the photocatalysts doped with nitrogen are quite different from those of pure (oxy)nitride materials. In (oxy)nitrides, N atoms as constituent elements, not dopants, can partially or fully replace O atoms in a metal oxide, leading to the upshift of the VB tops and the formation of narrow band gaps.17 For example, TaON shows good visible light absorption and a high AQY for oxygen evolution due to the formed hybridized N 2p and O 2p orbitals in the VB and the smooth migration of photogenerated holes in the VB.20 Therefore, a deep understanding of the intrinsic structural factors and electronic mechanisms behind complicated nitrogen doping remains an interesting topic. For more information about nitrogen-doped photocatalysts, readers are invited to refer to the excellent reviews.327,340,341 Nevertheless, as a doping strategy, nitrogen doping can continually play vital roles in the modification of photocatalysts, electrocatalysts as well as nano-carbon materials.
 Fig. 10  Five schemes illustrating the possible mechanisms for the red shift of the absorption onset in non-metal doped TiO2: (a) narrowing of the band gap resulting from the broadening of the VB; (b) introduction of localized states above the VB; (c) introduction of localized states below the CB; (d) formation of color centres in the band gap; (e) sensitization by compounds containing nitrogen species. 
Besides nitrogen doping, carbon, boron, sulfur and non-metal molecule doping also deserves more attention. For example, Bard and his coworkers demonstrated that carbon doping can decrease the band gap of TiO2 nanotube arrays. The resulting carbon-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays exhibited much higher PEC activity for WS as compared to an undoped photoanode under visible-light illumination (>420 nm), which was more than 20 times higher than that of a P-25 nanoparticulate film under the same conditions.342 In another example, although sulfur doping can slightly increase the band gap of graphitic C3N4, the S-doped C3N4 (C3N4−xSx) showed a 7.2 or 8.0 times increase in the H2 evolution rate compared to that of C3N4 under λ > 300 or 420 nm, respectively, due to an increased VB width and the elevated CB minimum.339 Recently, it was also revealed that non-metal molecules can also be used to strongly enhance the PC and PEC activity of a photocatalyst under visible light by altering its electronic structure. Recently, 0.5% PO4-doped BiVO4 showed the best photocurrent density and PC O2 evolution rates, which is about 30 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 due to greatly improved charge-transfer characteristics.343 Another interesting result from Lou's group showed that carbonate doping could enhance the hydrogen production rate of TiO2 microspheres by three orders of magnitude, compared to undoped TiO2 microspheres and P25, due to good crystallinity, high specific surface area and increased visible light absorption.344
In addition, more attention has been paid to the synergistic effects of co-doping with coupled heteroatoms (such as non metal–non metal, metal–non metal and metal–metal) on the activity for WS under visible light irradiation. Co-doping can increase the maximum dopant depth and content, which could efficiently promote the homogeneous distribution and abundance of the implanted heteroatoms at the atomic level, thus leading to an enhanced visible-light-driven activity for WS.327,345 For example, co-doping titanium dioxide by Ti3+–N,346 B–N347 and W–C181 have been reported to exhibit enhanced PC or PEC activity for WS under visible light irradiation. Thus, the challenge is to find the best combination of coupled heteroatoms through theoretical calculations and experimental research.


3.1.2 Multicomponent solid solutions. 
The fabrication of multi-component SCs through a solid-state reaction provide a good strategy for making full use of the advantages of different components.348 Moreover, the band gap energy of multicomponent SC NCs can be continuously tuned by changing the composition via the control of constituent stoichiometries, which will be quite helpful for achieving an optimized balance between visible-light absorption and redox potential.64,349 To date, a great variety of multicomponent SCs, such as La5Ti2MS5O7 (M = Ag, Cu),350 Sm2Ti2S2O5,74 (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx),21,64 BaTaO2N,351 LaTiO2N,73 (Ag0.75Sr0.25)(Nb0.75Ti0.25)O3,349 (CuxNa1−x)2Ta4O11 and CuxNa1−xNb13O33,352 (AgIn)xZn2(1−x)S2,69 ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2,284 Zn1−xCdxS100,278,283,353–355 and ZnIn2S4356 have been available in PC WS. For example, although ZnO and GaN are not active under visible light irradiation, their solid solutions show significant visible-light activities for WS due to the formation of narrow Eg. The formation of a GaN:ZnO solid solution can be confirmed by the shifts of XRD peaks and optical absorption edges.64 In another example, the calculated CB edge potential of the Zn1−xCdxS solid solution becomes more favourable for H2 generation, whereas the increasing Eg is unfavourable for the visible light absorption, as is increasing the content of Zn (Fig. 11a).278 Thus, the optimal H2-production activity under visible-light irradiation was achieved over the Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution due to the balanced CB potentials and Eg (Fig. 11b). Especially, the earth-abundant and non-toxic elements, such as Cu, W, Mo, Zn, Fe, Sn, Ta and Ti deserve more attention in constructing multicomponent SCs. For example, Choi's group found that CuW0.35Mo0.65O4 electrodes exhibited a reduced optical band gap (2.0 eV) and an enhanced efficiency for PEC WS.357

However, most of these mixed oxides are prepared by a high temperature solid-state reaction, leading to a very low activity and surface area. Thus, it is highly desirable to prepare these mixed oxides with mesoporous structures, high surface area and crystallinity by soft chemistry routes, such as hydrothermal synthesis and polymerizable complex methods.12 Meanwhile, it is still a great challenge to find multicomponent SCs with a low cost, high activity and stability under visible light irradiation. Recently, through a first principles high throughput screening system, Wu et al. proposed that Ti3O3N2, La2TiO2N2 and Li5MoO4N have great potential to be applied in the field of WS as visible-light-driven photocatalysts, which even exhibit better PC performance than the best oxynitride photocatalysts known today.158 The commercial piezoelectric inkjet printer156 and scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM)168,217,333,358 provide especially powerful tools to quickly find highly efficient mixed-metal oxide/sulfide photocatalysts for practical photosynthetic WS. Especially, the SECM has also proven to be a very useful tool for the discovery of complicated multicomponent electrocatalysts25,359 and photosensitizers360 with optimal properties.


3.1.3 Defect engineering. 
It is widely accepted that high crystallinity is advantageous for enhancing the PC activity for WS due to the higher mobility and lower recombination of excited charges within the defect-free solid.12,361 However, numerous reports have demonstrated that a proper amount of defects, such as oxygen vacancies and step edges plays critical roles in improving photo-generated carrier transfer and the PC activity for WS.362–365 Moreover, the electrical conductivities, optical, dissociative adsorption and reductive properties of metal oxides can also be improved by oxygen vacancies.366 In general, oxygen vacancies can be effectively created on the surface of metal oxides by thermal treatment under a reducing, oxygen depleted atmosphere or vacuum, bombardment using high energy particles, and doping with metal or non-metal ions.365 Recently, Li's group reported that oxygen vacancies as shallow donors can be created by the H2 treatment of metal oxides. All the oxygen-deficient metal oxides, including TiO2,211 ZnO,367 WO3,211 BiVO4368 and Fe2O3,369 showed enhanced activities for PEC water oxidation, because of improved electrical conductivities and separation of e−–h+ pairs.366,370 Meanwhile, the O-vacancy-rich ultrathin In2O3 porous sheets-based photoelectrode exhibits a much higher visible-light photocurrent than the O-vacancy-poor and bulk samples due to the narrowing of the band gap and improving the carrier separation efficiency.364 Recently, it was also found that defects in TiO2 can also be created by a facile low-temperature vacuum process, leading to a 4-fold enhancement in PC activity for H2 production.371 In addition, self-doped Ti3+ is also an effective strategy to enhance the PC activity of TiO2 for H2 generation under visible light because of the band gap narrowing and the introduction of an oxygen vacancy.372
However, defects can also act as charge recombination centers to lower the efficiency. As an effective strategy, the roles of defects in photocatalysis seem to be complex and not fully understood. The density, location, the relative concentration ratio of bulk defects to surface defects as well as the stability of defects should be paid more attention in the future studies.373,374 In addition, it is of significant importance to develop new methods or techniques to characterize the bulk defects because scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is only effective to study the surface or subsurface defects.373 It is also expected that the defects in SCs can be efficiently controlled and governed in the nanometer-scale to better utilize them in PC and PEC WS.

3.2 Micro/nano engineering
Besides the tunable compositions, another simple way to tune the optical, electrical, and redox properties of SCs is to manipulate their micro/nano-architecture. Generally, SC nanomaterials have several advantages over their bulk counterparts for solar fuel generation due to the following reasons: higher surface area, higher optical absorption, shorter charge transport pathways between the material interior and surface, higher solubility and tunable electronic structures.375

3.2.1 Colloidal nanocrystals. 
Since Graetzel, in 1981, first pointed out that a single colloidal SC particle treated with appropriate electrocatalysts could be a promising and simplest means of PC WS,376 the application of nanocrystals (NCs) in PC WS has received a great deal of attention in the past decades. Compared to the bulk sample, these small colloidal NCs have increased surface areas, number of active sites and surface area-to-volume ratios, leading to an efficient separation of photo-excited charges.16 Generally, with a decrease in particle size, the activity of NCs for WS greatly increased.377,378 For example, the Fe2O3,379 CdS,380,381 Ta3N5382 and NaTaO3383 NCs with a nano size and high surface area showed enhanced H2-production yields. However, surface recombination also greatly increased and crystallinity significantly decreased with the decreasing particle size.16,384 For example, TiO2, WO3, and La2Ti2O7 photocatalysts with a large size and high crystallinity show high water-oxidation activities.385
Meanwhile, it is known that the Eg of colloidal NCs along with the redox levels of the CB and VB increases by decreasing the particle size of a SC below a critical diameter (the Bohr radius) due to quantum size effects.384 It was observed that the PC H2-production activity of CdSe NCs (1.75–4.81 nm) strongly depends on the degree of quantum confinement, showing a constant decay of normalized H2 evolution rate with increasing particle size.75 However, a decreased activity of SrTiO3 for H2 evolution was observed by decreasing its particle size, because of an increased electrochemical overpotential for the OER and a decreased light absorption due to a quantum size effect.361 Thus, it is important to balance high surface area, crystallinity, nanosize effect and quantum size effect when optimizing the PC efficiency of NCs for WS. In addition, NCs should also be capped with polymers or immobilized on an inert support to prevent their agglomeration.16
Besides the nanosize effect and quantum size effect, the surface chemistry and morphology of nanocrystals also play important roles in the energy level shift of a material.386 For example, although the bandgap of CoO nanocrystals (∼2.6 eV) is very close to that of bulk CoO powders, the CB position of CoO nanocrystals is lower than that of the powders by more than 1 V.22 As a result, the band alignment of CoO nanoparticles makes them have very high photoactivity for overall WS, while the bulk CoO powders cannot exhibit PC activity for WS due to the unsuitable CB edge for the HER.22 The results clearly show that both the bandgap and its position should be accurately evaluated in developing nanocrystal photocatalysts and a deeper understanding of their photocatalysis enhancement mechanisms is needed.


3.2.2 One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures. 
Compared to bulk materials and 0D NCs, one dimensional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanowires (NWs), nanotubes (NTs), nanofibers (NFs), nanorods (NRs) and nanobelts (NBs) have a high surface area and an improved transport property of charges, thus reducing the recombination losses at grain boundaries.378 Moreover, a small diameter can minimize the distance for charges to SC/electrolyte interface, which contributes to a faster transfer/separation of charges during photocatalysis.387,388
It is well known that the ZnO NWs,389 Ta3N5 NRs,71,390 and TiO2 NWs/NTs arrays342,346 exhibit a much higher photocurrent for PEC water oxidation than bulk films due to the shorter transfer distance of photogenerated electrons to the back contact. For PC systems, due to the shortened distance for charges to the surface of 1D SC, 1D anatase-TiO2 NFs,391,392 Zn2GeO4 NRs393 and C3N4 NRs394 also exhibited significantly enhanced PC activities for WS under proper light irradiation, respectively, as compared to bulk materials. In particular, the CdS NRs/NWs have also been extensively investigated for PC WS.99,263,395,396 It is clear that the 1-D nanostructure plays an important role in enhancing PC H2-production activity of CdS.396 The destruction of the NR structure can lead to a significant decrease of H2-production activity.263,395 More interestingly, Amiravet et al. demonstrated that an AQY of 20% at 450 nm for H2 production can be achieved by tuning the length of a CdS rod and the size of an embedded CdSe seed.261 In an another novel system using 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) as the sacrificial hole acceptor, an IQE of 13.6 ± 1.0% was obtained for CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod NRs.397
So far, 1D nanostructures, especially for 1D core–shell structured SCs, have gained much interest due to their solar energy conversion efficiency. Therefore, it is very important to precisely control the diameter, length, surface structure, crystallinity as well as the band structure of 1D nanostructures to obtain the maximum PC activity for WS.


3.2.3 Crystal facet engineering (nanosheets). 
Since Lu and his co-workers first reported that uniform anatase single crystals with 47% (001) facets displayed superior photoactivity,398 crystal facet engineering has proven to be an effective strategy to finely tune the efficiency and selectivity of heterogeneous photocatalysts for different applications. Usually, different facets of a single-crystalline material possess distinctive physiochemical properties, such as adsorption, catalytic reactivity and selectivity, due to the different geometric and electronic structures.399 Meanwhile, crystal facets can also facilitate the separation of electrons and holes.400
It is generally accepted that the (101) facets are more reductive than (001) facets, which could act as possible reservoirs of photogenerated electrons, while (001) facets as oxidation sites play a major role in the photooxidative processes.400,401 For example, Pan et al. reported that low index facets of anatase TiO2 follows the photoreactivity order of (001) < (101) < (010) for PC hydrogen evolution and ˙OH radical generation.402 Similarly, the data from TiO2 nanocrystals through a seeded growth technique also demonstrated that the (101) facets of anatase TiO2 are more active than the (001) for PC WS.403 Surprisingly, it was even found that the PC activity for H2 production over the (111) facet exposed anatase TiO2 is about 5, 9, and 13 times higher than that of the TiO2 sample exposed with dominant (010), (101), and (001) facets, respectively.404 However, most researchers ignored the synergetic effects of various co-exposed facets in one sample. More attention has been paid to finding special facets rather than the balanced ratio of different exposed facets for the best PC efficiency of WS.
Recently, Yu's group found that an optimal ratio of the exposed (101) and (001) facets played a significant role in the enhancement of PC performance of TiO2 for the reduction of CO2.405 As shown in Fig. 12, the surplus electrons on the (101) facets will overflow to the (001) facets and then have a fast recombination with the holes on the (001) facets if the percentage of (101) facets is too low to hold all the photo-excited electrons, thus leading to a decrease in the PC activity. The results clearly showed that it is of significance to find the balanced ratio of different exposed facets in obtaining the best PC efficiency due to the synergetic effects of adjacent facets.406 This finding may shed light on the design and fabrication of advanced nanosheet-based SCs for WS.
 Fig. 12  The electron overflow effect on the (101) facets of TiO2. 
Besides TiO2, ultrathin CdS nanosheets,407 CdxZn1−xS nanosheets,408 exfoliated CsCa2Ta3O10−xNy409 and C3N4 nanosheets410,411 were also developed successfully, which showed significantly enhanced visible-light driven PC activity toward H2 production compared to their bulk counterpart. Recently, it was reported that the PEC activity for WS over a zinc chromium layered double hydroxide (ZnCr:LDH) nanosheet photoanode was 10 times higher than that of a ZnCr:MMO film fabricated by ZnCr:MMO powders under visible light.176 In the future, more effort should be focused on the development of feasible synthetic routes (such as the liquid exfoliation of layered materials412 and ion-exchange reactions408,413), controlling the ratio of the different exposed facets, and decoration of facets with co-catalysts or other 2D nanostructured SCs to form more efficient facet exposed SCs for extensive applications.


3.2.4 Mesoporous structures. 
Since mesoporous TiO2 was first synthesized by Antonelli and Ying in 1995,414 the synthesis of SC nanoparticles (NPs) with a mesoporous structural network has become a promising strategy to effectively increase the active sites, specific surface area, interfacial transport, light harvesting arising from multiple scattering in the pores and improve the accessibility of reactants to the catalyst surfaces.415–417 Furthermore, the porous morphology allows for photogenerated carriers to be collected over relatively short distances in an orthogonal direction, resulting in a high AQY for the collection of photogenerated carriers.418 All these factors can subsequently enhance the PC and PEC activity.
The higher activities of mesoporous SCs for WS can be verified through a series of mesoporous/nanoporous SCs, such as CdS,152 Ta2O547,419 and C3N478,420 reported by Domen's group. All these photocatalysts synthesized by using the hard template exhibited a very large BET surface area and a very high PC activity for H2 production. In particular, the PC activity of the mesoporous mpg-C3N4 for H2 production from water can be improved by 10 factors through introducing mesoporosity into polymeric C3N4, which can be ascribed to the increased surface area, improved SC properties and the increase of defects.78 Furthermore, the mesoporous TiO2 films exhibited about a 10-fold increase in PEC efficiency for WS relative to their counterparts obtained from crystalline TiO2 NPs.421 The reasons might be attributed to the insufficient electronic connectivity of NP-based metal oxide films. In addition, the photocurrent density of porous WO3 electrodes was 6 times higher than that of compact WO3 films under simulated AM 1.5G illumination due to improved separation and collection of photo-generated carriers.418
Thus, as a very important strategy, the synthesis and applications of crystalline mesoporous metal oxides have attracted extensive attention. To take advantage of the unique characteristics of mesoporous materials to develop practical photocatalysts, it is necessary to load suitable SCs or co-catalysts into the mesopores with confinement effects and high crystallinity walls. Furthermore, the complicated interaction between the pore walls and loading components in the channels also needs a deeper study.


3.2.5 Hierarchical micro-/nanoarchitectures. 
Recently, many efforts have been directed towards more advanced three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architectures assembled by the nanoscaled building blocks, such as NCs, MWs, NBs, and nanoplates. Due to anisotropic properties, high specific areas and porous nanostructured surface layers, these 3D hierarchical microstructures show unique optical, electronic, and PC performances, and favor the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and their transfer to surface active sites, consequently improving the AQY.422
3D-hierarchical microspheres, such as nanoflowers, are a simple kind of hierarchical microarchitecture. For example, the reported 3D flowerlike metal sulfide nanostructures, such as CuInS2,423 ZnS,424 ZnIn2S4425 and Cu3SnS4289 exhibited enhanced PC activity for H2 generation from WS. It was found that the flowerlike morphology is important for excellent PC activity. In addition, the combined effects of several factors, such as large surface areas, the existence of mesopores, and suitable Eg and band positions, are also beneficial for the enhancement in the photoactivity of the hierarchical nanoflowers.
The hierarchical core–shell nanoarchitectures present an important candidate for the application of photocatalysis. Recently, Cheng and his coworkers demonstrated that the mesoporous ZnS shell in hierarchical CdS–ZnS core–shell particles can promote the unique spatial distribution of the photo-excited charge carriers, and thus greatly enhance the hydrogen evolution rate, which is 169 and 56 times higher than that of ZnS and CdS under visible light, respectively.273 The unique SnO2/SiC hollow sphere nanochains were synthesized by topological morphology conversion of SnO2@C nanochains via a vapor–solid reaction process.426 The resulting SnO2/SiC hollow core–shell nanochains exhibit excellent PC activity and stability for H2 evolution due to the efficient charge separation and unique nanostructure. In addition, a series of 3D artificial forest-like Si NWs photoelectrodes with WO3 microstructured shells,427 TiO2, InGaN and ZnO NRs branches428–431 have been reported to exhibit enhanced PEC efficiencies for WS. The large surface area, good charge transport properties, and large porosities might be the main reasons for the enhancement. These 3D hierarchical nanotree heterostructures with Si NRs trunks and other NRs branches shed some light on the development of high-performance electrodes using high-density 3D NW networks. Future research efforts regarding hierarchical nanoarchitectures should focus on accurately controlling the length, diameter and number, as well as chemical composition of the trunks and branches.
The hierarchical (semi-)hollow architecture is another attractive system owing to the well-defined morphology, high specific surface area, high light-harvesting efficiency and fast mobility of the charge carriers.432,433 As shown in Fig. 13, it is clear that the hollow and urchin-like hollow spheres have better light absorption than the solid spheres due to multiple reflections within the structure. For example, hollow C3N4 nanospheres can function as both light-harvesting antennae and nanostructured scaffolds. A 25-fold enhancement in the H2-generation rate over Pt–C3N4 nanospheres was achieved compared to that of bulk g-C3N4 under 420 nm irradiation.297 Similarly, a hierarchical metastable γ-TaON with urchin-like hollow nanostructures exhibited a H2 evolution activity of 381.6 μmol h−1, with an AQY of 9.5% at 420 nm, which was about 47.5 times higher than that of the conventional TaON.291 This excellent activity is ascribed to the unique urchin-like nanostructure, metastable crystal structure, increased light absorption, appropriate electronic structure and the efficient charge carrier separation.
 Fig. 13  Schematic illustration of the light-harvesting behavior of solid, hollow and urchin-like hollow spheres. 
In addition, photonic crystal-based SCs with unique optical properties can increase the light/photocatalyst contact time and light absorbance, and thus enhance the PC activities for WS. The large surface area, huge pore volume, highly crystalline frameworks, and continuous morphology of hierarchically ordered macro-/mesoporous films can also greatly enhance the PC and PEC activity for WS.434 Recently, it was found that the H2 evolution over a Pt-loaded TiO2 hierarchical photonic crystal photocatalyst can be enhanced by a factor of 2 compared to that of nanocrystalline TiO2 due to slow photon enhancement and multiple scatterings.435 An inverse opal WO3 photoanode exhibited a 2-fold increase in photocurrent intensity under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) compared to a disordered porous WO3 photoanode.436 Therefore, it is expected that the photonic crystal-based photocatalyst with visible light absorption could be extensively studied and utilized in the field of WS in future studies.

3.3. Bionic engineering
It is known that natural photosynthesis can capture sunlight very efficiently and convert it into organic molecules. Inspired by this, to enhance the PC or PEC efficiency for solar fuel production in APS systems, bionic engineering has been developed in recent years.437,438 The so-called bionic engineering refers to learning from the key elements and processes of natural photosynthesis (such as the structure and function of hydrogenase enzymes), and developing efficient and robust components, working systems or photocatalysts for solar WS.439,440 In addition to mimicking natural photosynthesis, the direct biocatalysts (enzymes) modification of photocatalysts is also included here. All these bionic systems, such as the Z-scheme, enzymes and biomimetic complex modification, will be discussed in this section in detail.

3.3.1 Biocatalysts (enzymes) modification. 
In nature, the enzyme responsible for hydrogen metabolism in many green algae and cyanobacteria is called hydrogenase. The hydrogenases (H2ases) generally include [Fe]-H2ase, [NiFe]-H2ase, and [FeFe]-H2ase.441 All of them can catalyze the reversible reduction of protons to H2 with remarkable reaction rates. Especially, the activity of [FeFe]-H2ase for H2 evolution is pretty high, and its TOF generally lies in the range of 103–104 s−1 at 30 °C. Therefore, the coupling of hydrogenase and SCs for PC WS seems to be attractive in the past few years.
The first example of a hydrogenase used in a PEC cell was reported by Hambourger et al. in 2008.442 In this wired PEC system, the H2 production rate over Ca[FeFe] hydrogenase immobilized on a carbon felt electrode was comparable to a Pt electrode when the same photoanode, a porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 NP, was used. Similarly, a hybrid system consisting of [NiFeSe]-hydrogenases attached to Ru dye-sensitized TiO2 NPs was able to produce H2 at a TOF of about 50 s−1 at pH 7 and 25 °C under visible light illumination.443 Based on these works, in order to further enhance the activity, visible-light-driven CdTe nanocrystals and CdS nanorods were introduced in the hybrid system by Brown and coworkers,444,445 respectively. Typically, as shown in Fig. 14, a TOF of 380–900 s−1 was obtained over the complexes of CdS nanorods capped with MPA and clostridium acetobutylicum[FeFe]-hydrogenase I (CaI).445 The kinetics of electron transfer (ET) between the light-absorbing CdS NRs and the [FeFe]-hydrogenase showed that the ET rate constant is in good agreement with those for the decay of photoexcited electrons in CdS NRs.167 Therefore, a further improvement of efficiency can be achieved through the structural modification of NCs and decreasing the average number of CaI moieties per CdS NR.

Although [FeFe]-hydrogenase can be used as a H2 evolution or oxidation catalyst, it suffers from considerable oxygen sensitivity for the application of H2 evolution.446 Relatively speaking, [NiFe]-hydrogenase seems to be more promising because of its tolerance to oxygen.447,448 In addition, they are too costly to be scaled up to satisfy technological demands.449 Therefore, the design of cheaper biomimetic molecular complexes with similar functions as hydrogenases looks more promising due to the tolerance to O2 and the tunable structures.440


3.3.2 Biomimetic complexes (molecular electrocatalysts) modification. 
Inspired by the remarkably high activity and the structure of hydrogenases, many metal complexes (such as [FeFe]-hydrogenase mimics,450–454 cobaloxime,455,456 diimine–dioxime cobalt,457 Ni(dimethylglyoxime)2,458 [Co(bdt)2]−(bdt,benzene-1,2-dithiolate),459 and DuBois-type nickel (NiP)460–462) have been designed and developed for PC or electrocatalytic WS. All these metal complexes have quite high quantum efficiencies and product selectivity for H2 evolution. So far, the nickel bisdiphosphine catalysts designed by DuBois's group exhibited the highest catalytic activities for H2 evolution to date. A remarkable TOF of 106000 s−1 from a protonated acetonitrile–water solution can be achieved under 600 mV overvoltage.461 The covalent attachment of a nickel bisdiphosphine onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes can result in a very low overvoltage and high catalytic activity for H2 evolution under strongly acidic conditions.449 Therefore, it is a good strategy to prepare highly efficient photocatalysts with high selectivity and activity by combining photoactive SCs with metal complexes capable of electrocatalytic H2 evolution. In this complex/SC hybrid photocatalyst system, a facilitated charge separation can be achieved due to the fast rate of photoexcited electron transfer from the SC to the complex, which benefits a deep understanding of the mechanisms of water reduction at the molecular level.
Li and coworkers successfully assembled a hybrid artificial photosynthetic H2 evolution system using a SC (ZnS) as the light-harvester and an [Fe2S2] hydrogenase mimic ([(μ-SPh-4-NH2)2Fe2(CO)6]) as the catalyst for H2 evolution. This system showed a very high H2-evolution activity with an initial TOF of 100 h−1 and a total TON of more than 2607 for up to 38 h in water and DMF.463 Further results showed that CdS exhibited no activity in this combination system due to the unsuitable CB potential. In order to increase the solubility of the hydrogenase mimic in water, Wu's group reported a series of integrated systems consisting of a hydrogenase mimic and SC NCs, such as CdTe450,454 and CdSe.464 Especially, a water-soluble artificial photosynthetic system can be formed through the interface-directed assembly of a simple precursor of [FeFe]-H2ase mimic on CdSe QDs. As a result, a very high efficiency for H2 evolution with a TON of 8781 and an initial TOF of 596 h−1 under visible light can be achieved by this system.
In addition, cobaloximes and Ni-based molecules were also extensively used to couple with the SCs to construct composite systems. Interestingly, CdS,465 CdSe/ZnS Core/Shell QDs466 and g-C3N4 nanosheets467 were successively used to construct hybrid photocatalysts with cobaloximes. Among them, the CdSe–ZnS QD–cobaloxime hybrid system exhibited the highest H2 evolution activity, with a TON of more than 10000 H2 per QD in 10 h under visible light illumination.466 Optical transient absorption spectroscopy also revealed that the electron transfer from the QDs to cobaloxime proceeds much faster than the charge recombination in the QDs. In another typical example, Han and coworkers reported a highly active and robust system, which is composed of a novel water-soluble Ni–thiolate complex for proton reduction, CdSe nanocrystals capped with DHLA as a light absorber and ascorbic acid (AA) as an electron donor (Fig. 15).271 Surprisingly, the precious-metal-free system showed undiminished activity for at least 360 hours under irradiation at 520 nm, achieving a total TON of more than 600000 and a high QE in water of over 36%. In addition, a self-healing and exceptional artificial photocatalyst, hybrid Nih-CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots, exhibited high activity for H2 production from a 2-propanol aqueous solution, giving a constant rate of ∼153 μmol h−1 mg−1 and an internal QE of 11.2% at 410 nm.272 The PC system is stable under visible-light irradiation with TON of 15340 and 18000 with respect to the CdSe QDs and nickel, respectively, for 10 h illumination (λ > 400 nm). Furthermore, in a glycerol and water solution, the modified CdS QDs show the greatest affinity toward Ni2+ ions and the highest activity for H2 evolution, with a high H2 evolution rate of approximately 74.6 μmol h−1 mg−1 and a high TON of 38405.468

However, many hydrogenase mimics and metal complexes suffer from low solubility in water.469 Moreover, these metal complexes as photocatalysts require a suitable electron donor (such as a toxic organic solvent) in the photo-excited states, because there is no photocatalyst complex capable of extracting electrons from H2O.16 At this point, the water-soluble Ni complexes appear to be more promising. In addition, a deep understanding of the relationship between their molecular structures and performance is still highly needed for developing highly efficient PC systems.


3.3.3 
            Z-Scheme. 
Inspired by the natural photosynthesis of green plants, the Z-scheme system for WS with visible light was originally introduced by Bard in 1979,315 then was achieved using two different photocatalysts and an appropriate shuttle redox mediator by Abe et al. in 2001.470,471 The so-called Z-scheme is the SC-based artificial photosynthetic system, and is composed of an H2-evolving photocatalyst, an O2-evolving photocatalyst, and an electron mediator.472,473 Each photocatalyst in the construction of the Z-scheme is only responsible for one half-reaction of WS (HER or OER), which results in the formation of separated reduction and oxidation reaction sites in two different photocatalysts, thus effectively avoiding the occurrence of the SBR. Importantly, many narrow band gap SCs can be used to construct the Z-scheme system for solar WS, which is the advantage of the Z-scheme.474 Various Z-scheme WS systems are summarized in Table 4. As observed in Table 4, apart from the liquid-state Z-scheme systems, all-solid-state Z-scheme and direct Z-scheme systems have recently received increasing attention, all of which will be discussed here in detail.

The most widely investigated liquid-state Z-scheme systems are generally composed of two separate SCs and a reaction solution containing a suitable redox mediator. In these systems, enhanced reduction and oxidation power for solar WS could be realized because the photo-generated electrons in one SC with a lower CB minimum (with a lower reduction power) could recombine with the photo-excited holes in the other with a higher valence band maximum (with a lower oxidation power) by means of suitable redox mediators. Thus, the redox couples, co-catalyst, proper SCs and their matching properties are important factors affecting the activity in the liquid-state Z-scheme system. So far, many successful examples have been available. For example, Kudo demonstrated that Ru loaded on SrTiO3:Rh as an effective co-catalyst can greatly enhance the activity for overall WS in the Z-scheme photocatalysis system using an Fe3+/Fe2+ electron mediator.478 Domen's group reported a famous Z-scheme system consisting of Pt/ZrO2/TaON, Pt/WO3 and IO3−/I− pairs (Fig. 16).473 An AQY of 6.3% at 420.5 nm was achieved, which was about 6 times greater than that of a TaON analogue. Recently, Kudo found that [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ and [Co(phen)3]3+/2+ redox couples can also serve as electron mediators for Z-scheme photocatalyst systems composed of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 powders for overall WS.482 Tang and co-workers developed two organic SC-based Z-scheme systems involving a g-C3N4 SC and a robust metal oxide (BiVO4 or WO3) for overall WS under visible light. More interestingly, a Z-scheme unbiased PEC device using two separate PEC cells (Pt–W/Mo–BiVO4 and Zn0.2Cd0.8Se) was first developed by the Bard group recently.174 This conceptual design of unbiased Z-scheme PEC systems for solar WS may provide inspiration for the construction of new Z-scheme or unbiased PEC WS systems.174 In future, it is expected that crystalline two-dimensional SC nanosheets (such as g-C3N4,410,411 CdS,407 BiVO4115,504 and WO3505 nanosheets) with exposed active sites could be further optimized by different strategies and used to construct highly efficient Z-scheme WS systems.
 Fig. 16  Schematic energy diagram of PC WS for a two-step photoexcitation system. 
Besides the liquid state Z-scheme, a new and interesting concept of an all-solid-state Z-scheme composed of a CdS/Au/TiO2 nanojunction was first presented by Tada et al., in which the CdS (reduction site), TiO2 (oxidation site) and the interconnect Au are spatially fixed.484 This three-component system exhibits a high PC activity, far exceeding those of the single- and two-component systems, as a result of vectorial electron transfer driven by the two-step excitation of TiO2 and CdS. To enhance the visible-light absorption of TiO2, an improved CdS/Au/TiO1.96C0.04 solid state Z-scheme system was developed, and the H2 evolution activity over it was about 4 times higher than that of CdS/Au/TiO2 under visible light irradiation.487 In another example, Amal and co-workers constructed an interesting all-solid-state Z-scheme PC WS system using RGO as the solid electron mediator. As shown in Fig. 17, the photo-generated electrons in the CB of BiVO4 can transfer to the vacancies in the impurity levels of Ru/SrTiO3 through the RGO. Simultaneously, the electrons in Ru/SrTiO3:Rh reduce water to H2 on the Ru cocatalyst, while the holes in BiVO4 oxidize water to O2, accomplishing a complete WS cycle.492 Furthermore, the tandem photoelectrode in PEC cells is one typical kind of all-solid-state Z-scheme PC system.4,506–508 In this system, the ohmic contact is usually created by the ITO, FTO and precious metal NPs. Therefore, in theory, any conductor (such as metal NPs and nanocarbon) can serve as a solid electron mediator in all solid state Z-scheme systems. The optimization of geometry architecture, electron mediators, contact interface, mass ratio and composition of two SCs play important roles in achieving highly efficient all-solid-state Z-scheme PC systems for WS.509
 Fig. 17  Schematic image and mechanism of WS in a Z-scheme photocatalysis system consisting of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and PRGO/BiVO4 under visible-light irradiation. 
Clearly, the liquid-state or solid-state redox mediators play important roles in shuttling the photo-generated carriers between O2-evolution and H2-evolution photocatalysts in Z-scheme systems. However, the presence of a shuttle redox mediator can also decrease the efficiency of Z-scheme systems due to the undesirable SBR, light-shielding effect and competitive oxidation of redox couples.496 That is, the oxidation of I− competes with the oxygen evolution by photo-generated holes in the O2-evolution photocatalysts, whereas the reduction of IO3− competes with water reduction by photo-generated electrons in the H2-evolution photocatalysts. Thus, the direct Z-scheme WS systems without a redox mediator have drawn more and more attention recently.496,498 For example, the 1 wt% Pt-loaded (ZnO)1/(CdS)0.2 heterostructure exhibits a very high activity for H2 evolution (3870 μmol h−1 g−1) because the direct transfer and recombination of photo-generated electrons in ZnO and holes in CdS could greatly prolong the lifetime time of carriers in this heterostructure (as shown in Fig. 18).494 As compared to the SC heterostructures, more powerful photo-generated electrons and holes in the direct Z-scheme systems are used to perform the HER and OER, respectively, thus leading to enhanced activities for solar WS. More recently, it was demonstrated that many systems, such as BiVO4–Ru/SrTiO3:Rh,497 WO3–CdS,502 SiC–CdS501 and rutile–anatase TiO2503 composite photocatalysts show a direct Z-scheme mechanism for PC solar WS without an electron mediator. In the future, it is expected that more and more direct Z-scheme composite photocatalysts with high activity could be developed and applied in solar WS.
 Fig. 18  Schematic of band structures and charge transfer in the direct Z-scheme mechanism in ZnO/CdS heterostructures. 
In addition, the stability of SCs in Z-scheme WS systems should be paid more attention because mostly unstable SCs with narrow band gaps were usually used. Thus, the SCs loaded by appropriate co-catalysts should be further developed and applied in the liquid state and all-solid-state Z-scheme WS systems in future studies.472


3.3.4 Biotemplates. 
One smart feature of natural materials concerns their beautiful organization in which structure and function are optimized at different length scales.438 Therefore, biological systems provide an ideal environment for synthesizing non-natural materials with control of morphology and crystal structure.510 Moreover, it allows for the production of porous solids at a lower cost. To imitate the structure and functionality of biological systems, another strategy to enhance the PC and PEC efficiency is to design and fabricate 3D hierarchical photocatalysts using biotemplates, such as green leaves,246 cellulose nanofibers,511 butterfly wings512 and viruses.510,513 For instance, the promising 3D artificial inorganic leaf (AIL) architecture of TiO2 was produced utilizing natural leaves as the template.246 The activity for H2 evolution over this material was about 8 times higher than that of TiO2 NPs synthesized without templates, and about 3.3 times higher than that of P25 in 20% aqueous methanol. The loading of 2 wt% Pt NPs can cause another 10-fold enhancement in activity, and a high hydrogen evolution rate, 1401.70 μmol h−1 (QE = 15.54%), can be achieved. The enhanced activities were attributed to the synergy of nitrogen self-doping, the hierarchical structures derived from the natural leaves and high specific surface areas.246 Besides natural leaves, viruses can also be used as biotemplates to construct artificial photocatalysts. The M13 virus templated IrO2–porphyrin and SrTiO3 nanowires also exhibited better activities for oxygen and hydrogen evolution, respectively.510,513 Especially, the hydrogen evolution rate of SrTiO3 nanowires is 370 μmol g−1 h−1, which is around 10 times higher than that of P-25 and commercial SrTiO3 nanopowders due to the smaller particle size providing a larger surface to volume ratio and the high crystallinity preventing excited charge recombinations at lattice defect sites.510 In addition, original butterfly wings were also used as templates to produce artificial butterfly wing architecture TiO2 (ABWA–TiO2). The PC efficiency of ABWA–TiO2 was 7 times higher than that of TiO2 NPs without the template (NT–TiO2).512 In addition, the activity of 1.5 wt% Pt loaded ABWA–TiO2 was still 2.3 times higher than that of 1.5 wt% Pt loaded NT–TiO2. The results suggest that the hierarchical architecture borrowed from the butterfly wing template plays a significant role in enhancing the catalytic activities for H2 evolution. Thus, as a concept of learning from nature, biotemplate synthesis could give a broad scope of developing micro/nanostructured photocatalysts with unrealized hierarchical architectures using conventional methods, which should be extended broadly for the efficient conversion of solar energy to sustainable chemical fuels.

3.4. Co-catalyst engineering
Since loading Pt on the surface of TiO2 was first introduced by Kraeutler and Bard in 1978,514 the loading of Pt co-catalysts has been regarded as a popular strategy to improve the PC performance for the HER from WS because the overpotential for the HER on a Pt co-catalyst is very low. A TiO2 particle loaded with Pt can be thought of as a “short-circuited PEC cell” which provides reduction sites for the HER.315,316 Thus, loading electrocatalyst (co-catalysts) NPs onto different photocatalyst particles has become a common strategy (or a benchmark technology) to obtain high activities and reasonable reaction rates because each SC particle can act as a microelectrochemical cell.16,316 It is generally believed that the co-catalysts can extract the photogenerated charge carriers from SCs, provide reaction sites, minimize the overpotential necessary to drive the multielectron HER and OER, and decrease the activation energy for gas evolution.515,516 Another function is to provide a junction/interface between the co-catalysts and SCs to enhance electron–hole separation or charge transport.516,517 To some degree, suitable co-catalysts play decisive roles in achieving the highly efficient PC activity for WS, which can improve the reduction and oxidation activities of water by an order of magnitude or even more. Here, we will highlight some co-catalysts which are considered to be attractive for engineering SCs for highly efficient WS.

3.4.1 Structural engineering of co-catalysts. 
Generally, to achieve overall WS, the best known catalysts for the HER are precious metal co-catalysts (e.g., Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt), which could be loaded selectively at reaction sites of SCs by an in situ photodeposition method. However, they could also serve as co-catalysts to promote an undesirable SBR, water formation from H2 and O2, leading to a decrease in activity. Therefore, for suppressing the SBR, the development of co-catalysts with different structures has attracted increasing interests in PC and PEC WS due to their improved charge separation and catalytic activity.
One of the most viable options is the construction of core–shell structured NPs as co-catalysts, which has been widely investigated for a long time. Particularly, in the 1980s, Domen's research group first found that the core–shell structured Ni/NiO can be used as co-catalysts to achieve the PC decomposition of H2O into H2 and O2 over SrTiO3 powders.54,518 This is because the Ni metal core can improve the transfer of an electron between both SrTiO3 and NiO and that the NiO shell layer can suppress the SBR on metal Ni. Since then, the NiOx as a popular co-catalyst for the HER has been widely applied in many heterogeneous PC systems such as Ta-based photocatalyts to achieve high activity.12,13,155 Meanwhile, they also found that the Rh/Cr2O3 (core/shell) co-catalysts on (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) exhibited a significant enhancement in PC activity for H2 evolution.519 Further studies by model electrodes revealed that a Cr2O3 layer could suppress the SBR.520 As illustrated in Fig. 19a, the promoted HER can occur at the interface between the Rh core and the Cr2O3 layer. In addition, it was demonstrated that the TiO2 photocatalyst loaded by Au/Pd core–shell structured NPs yielded a remarkable H2 evolution rate of ∼0.9 mmol h−1 in ethanol or glycerol solutions, corresponding to an AQE of ∼70%, which is superior to those of TiO2-supported Au, Pd and their alloy NP photocatalysts.243 The results suggested that the reduced surface accumulation of electrons for Au/Pd core–shell structured NPs facilitated the storage and release of photo-excited electrons for catalysis. The above results indicated that the formation of core–shell structured co-catalysts is also a useful strategy to design a highly effective co-catalyst for the HER with suppressed O2 photoreduction.

Recently, many efforts have been made to construct multi-layer structured co-catalysts, especially for PEC WS. It was found that Ni/NiO bilayer nanofilms can also be used as OER co-catalysts to suppress the photocorrosion of n-type silicon (n-Si) photoanodes and achieve highly efficient photo-oxidation of water under neutral and basic pH conditions. The oxygen evolution onset potential is even reduced to below the thermodynamic water oxidation level.521,522 Thus, the results may open up some additional possibilities for the extensive application in photochemical WS. It is expected that bifunctional NiOx co-catalysts can be fully designed and widely used for both the OER and HER from WS.523 Furthermore, it was found that Co3O4/Co(II)/Ta3N5 array photoanodes with a bilayer co-catalyst exhibited not only a negatively shifted onset potential, but also significantly improved photocurrent and stability. This was mainly ascribed to the uniform loading of co-catalysts and an order of magnitude reduction in the resistance to charge transfer at the Ta3N5/H2O interface.202 More recently, Choi and Kim found that the BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH photoanode with dual-layer oxygen evolution co-catalysts achieved outstanding performances for PEC WS, and a photocurrent density of 2.73 mA cm−2 at a potential as low as 0.6 V versus RHE.125 As shown in Fig. 19b, the FeOOH layer reduces recombination at the interface between BiVO4 and co-catalysts while the NiOOH layer creates a more favorable potential drop to achieve faster water oxidation kinetics.125 These results indicated that the modification of dual-layer co-catalysts is a promising strategy for designing and tailoring SC photoelectrodes to enhance their PEC performances for WS.
Therefore, both core–shell and multi-layer structured co-catalysts deserve more attention in the general fields of photochemical WS due to their excellent performances. The precise control of the thickness of each layer and the PC mechanism studies on these composited co-catalysts played very important roles in constructing highly efficient co-catalysts. Significantly, for the practical application of photocatalysts, much attention should be also paid to the improvement in the stability of the photocatalysts and the suppression of SBR on the surface of the co-catalysts. Both problems can be solved through the structural engineering of co-catalysts. In addition, it is also important to better understand the mechanistic role of co-catalyst NPs and minimize the metal co-catalyst loading.


3.4.2 Composition engineering of co-catalysts. 
Another important breakthrough was achieved by Domen and co-workers in 2006. The mixed metal oxide co-catalyst, Rh2−yCryO3, was successfully developed and applied in the photocatalyst (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx). An AQY of 2.5% for overall WS at 420–440 nm was achieved over the photocatalyst, (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) loaded with Rh2−yCryO3 co-catalysts.21 The optimized photocatalyst, (Ga0.82Zn0.18)(N0.82O0.18) loaded with Rh2−yCryO3 (2.5 wt% Rh, 2 wt% Cr) and post-calcined at 823 K, could exhibit a 2-fold enhancement in the AQY (ca. 5.9% at 420–440 nm).234 These results clearly indicated that the construction of mixed metal oxide co-catalysts with proper compositions is a powerful strategy to improve the PC activity for WS over SCs. Based on this strategy, a series of cobalt-based oxide electrocatalysts, such as CoOx, Co3O4 and Fe100−y−zCoyNizOx, have been developed through composition engineering.108,524,525 For example, CoOx as co-catalysts has been coupled with the SCs such as LaTiO2N,73 Sm2Ti2S2O5,309 TaON,107 Ta3N5307 and g-C3N4526 to significantly improve their stability and activity for OER.
More importantly, these useful strategies for constructing mixed metal oxides can be easily applied in other systems, such as alloys, metal sulfides and carbides co-catalysts. The nickel-based HER electrocatalysts, such as Ni–Mo,84–87 Ni–Zn,90 Ni–Mo–Zn,88,89 NiMoNx151 and NiWSx106 have been also developed through adjusting the composition, which exhibit great potential to act as co-catalysts for the PC HER. Although the nickel alloy co-catalysts exhibit high activity for the HER in alkaline electrolytes, it often degrades in acidic solutions. Since a MoS2 nanocatalyst has been found to show high activity and stability for the HER in acidic environments,527,528 Mo-based co-catalysts for the HER (e.g. MoS2,91,94 MoSx,95,96 Mo3S497,98 and Cu2MoS4,105) with different compositions have also been extensively developed. Therefore, Co-, Ni- and Mo-based electrocatalysts developed through composition engineering may provide many potential co-catalysts for PC and PEC WS.
Recently, it was also found that the co-catalyst of oxidized platinum clusters in a higher oxidation state can also act as an efficient H2 evolution site.529 The PC activity for HER over PtO/TiO2 is nearly 4 times higher than that over Pt/TiO2 in methanol aqueous solutions due to the suppression of the SBR, and the oxidation of H2 to H2O. The possible reaction mechanism of H2 evolution over PtO-clusters and Pt co-catalysts is illustrated in Fig. 20. The control of the valence state of platinum is expected to be a new strategy to achieve the suppression of H2 oxidation in PC WS, which may provide some inspiration for the development of other high-efficiency co-catalysts.
 Fig. 20  Schematic PC H2 evolution and back-reaction processes over both PtO-clusters and metallic Pt NPs co-catalyst. 
Therefore, a deeper understanding and investigation of the photocatalysis mechanism over these multi-component co-catalysts might be helpful for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for WS. Meanwhile, to get the highest activity for the HER or OER, the loading methods, composition, amounts, location and the size of co-catalysts should be comprehensively taken into account and carefully optimized.


3.4.3 Spatially separated dual co-catalysts. 
On the basis of the above analysis, it is natural to expect that co-loading of both H2 and O2 evolution co-catalysts onto the same photocatalyst would improve WS activity due to the accumulative catalytic effect and enhanced charge separation. Unfortunately, few successful and reliable examples of photocatalyst systems with two different co-catalysts for WS have been reported,530–533 since the initial reports on loading both Pt and RuO2 onto TiO2 or CdS for WS by Graetzel and his coworkers.376
In 2010, a proof-of-concept using GaN:ZnO loaded with Rh/Cr2O3(core/shell) and Mn3O4 NPs as H2 and O2 evolution co-catalysts, respectively, was successfully developed by Domen's group.530 Further results showed that the co-loading of RuO2 and Rh/Cr2O3 on GaN:ZnO catalysts can also suppress oxidative decomposition of GaN:ZnO during PC WS and thus improve the stability of photocatalysts.534 Similarly, significant improvement of stability can be also observed through the co-loading of colloidal IrO2 on a less-defective TaON (ZrO2/TaON) modified with core/shell-structured RuOx/Cr2O3 NPs.535 However, in all these systems, the co-loading of O2 evolution co-catalysts can only improve the activity for HER to some degree, by a factor of 1.4 at most, suggesting that most photocatalysts lack surface H2-evolution sites rather than O2-evolution sites.17,536 Another possible reason is that two different co-catalysts for OER and HER were randomly loaded on the surface of SC NPs, leading to the inevitable SBR. Therefore, it is highly expected that the spatially separated dual co-catalysts can deal with these problems and further improve the activity for WS.
Recently, Domen and coworkers demonstrated a proof-of-concept using a SiO2–Ta3N5 core–shell photocatalyst loaded with Pt NPs on the inner Ta3N5 shell surface as an electron collector and IrO2 or CoOx on the outer shell surface as a hole collector. As shown in Fig. 21, the separated co-catalysts are favorable for the separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes toward the inner and outer surfaces, respectively, thereby suppressing their recombination and the SBR. As a consequence, a significantly enhanced water reduction and oxidation performance was achieved over these core–shell photocatalysts with spatially separated co-catalysts under visible light irradiation.
 Fig. 21  A proposed reaction mechanism for visible-light-driven overall WS on core–shell Ta3N5 photocatalyst loaded with two separate Pt and IrO2. 
This strategy also has potential applications in other heterojunction photocatalysts with controllable morphology and components. In this regard, another recent work from Li's group is particularly noteworthy. They selectively deposited the reduction co-catalyst (Pt) and the oxidation co-catalyst (MnOx) onto the electron-rich (010) facet and the hole-rich (110) facet of BVO4, respectively.115 As a consequence, this BiVO4 photocatalyst exhibited a much higher activity in both the PC and PEC water oxidation reaction, as compared with the photocatalyst with randomly distributed co-catalysts. The enhanced activity can be attributed to the synergetic effect of the different facets and two separated co-catalysts.115 This work may open a new opportunity for improving the PC activity for WS through selective deposition of suitable HER and OER co-catalysts onto the different facets of SCs. Particularly, more attention should be paid to visible-light-driven photocatalysts with two spatially separated earth-abundant co-catalysts.


3.4.4 Amorphous co-catalysts. 
Besides highly crystallized co-catalysts, amorphous materials as co-catalysts have also garnered considerable attention from researchers due to their outstanding activity arising from their defect sites. So far, many amorphous electrocatalysts, such as Co-Pi,11,89,146 Co–Bi,146 Ni–Bi,145 a-FeCoNiOx,108,537 FeOOH,127 MoSx92,93,97,260,282,538 and NiOOH108 have been reported to be active for OER or HER. They can be also used as co-catalysts to enhance the efficiency of PC WS by coupling with photocatalysts.
Among them, Co-Pi with an amorphous structure has proven to be a highly efficient co-catalyst on SCs for OER. Kanan and Nocera first reported that a Co-Pi based electrocatalyst can be prepared by in situ electrodeposition in an aqueous neutral phosphate medium containing Co2+ ions, which exhibited high water oxidation activity and stability at low overpotentials (an overpotential of only 0.41 V at pH 7).11,138,539 Soon after, Choi demonstrated a general route to load Co-Pi catalysts onto ZnO photoanodes by in situ photodeposition method.540 Since then, Co-Pi has been successfully coupled with various SCs, such as a-Fe2O3,539 Ta3N5,199 C3N4,305,541 WO3,210 BiVO4189 and Si,542 and improved activity and stability were achieved due to the enhanced kinetic rates for water oxidation. More interestingly, Cobo et al. demonstrated that a Janus Co-Pi catalytic material could be converted into H2-CoCat in a phosphate buffer by altering the applied potential, which can catalyze HER from water.139 For example, Barber et al. reported that the Co-Pi electrocatalyst can be loaded on the surface of a mesoporous graphitic-carbon–nitride (mpg-CNx) photocatalyst via a scalable method. The resulting Co-Pi/mpg-CNx composite photocatalysts exhibited enhanced activities for O2 evolution, which were 400 times higher than those of the untreated mpg-CNx.305 The PC results indicate that the Co-Pi catalysts can trap photo-generated holes and promote the separation of photo-generated charge carriers, leading to enhanced O2 evolutions. More interestingly, Co-Pi could be converted into a H2–CoCat HER electrocatalyst under visible light illumination in methanol solution, which can significantly promote the PC activities of mpg-CNx for HER.305
Since the HER activity of MoS2 NPs with the un-coordinated S atoms at the edges was theoretically and experimentally verified,527,543 the earth-abundant MoS2 has also been used as an efficient co-catalyst on a variety of SC photocatalysts for HER. For example, Li et al. found that 36-times enhancement in the activity for HER was achieved through the loading of MoS2 onto CdS by an impregnation–sulfidation method due to the formation of heterojunctions.91 The results also verified that MoS2 on CdS was more efficient for the H2 evolution than Pt on CdS. Recently, Hu's research group found that amorphous MoSx electrocatalysts in powder and films have more unsaturated S atoms and higher electrocatalytic activity for the HER than the highly crystalline molybdenum sulfide species.92,93 Therefore, in theory, amorphous MoSx can also be used as a co-catalyst to enhance PC activity for HER. The research group of Alivisatos showed that amorphous MoS3 can be formed on the surface of CdSe-seeded CdS nanorod photoabsorbers by a microwave-deposition method. They found that the PC HER activity of initially amorphous MoS3 was comparable to platinum, but the activity decreased as MoS3 was reduced to MoS2 during the PC process.260 Chorkendorff et al. demonstrated that a p-type Si SC coated by incomplete cubane-like clusters (Mo3S4) could exhibit an improved PEC activity for HER with an STH efficiency in excess of 10%.97 They also found that a Ti–n+p Si photoelectrode by deposition of amorphous MoSx could show an unprecedented anodic onset of the HER for a non-Pt catalyst in acidic medium.538 Wei et al. demonstrated that the loading of amorphous MoS2 on ZnIn2S4 can show a significantly promoting effect for the PC hydrogen evolution rate, which is 10 times as great as that over bare ZnIn2S4 under similar conditions.282 More interestingly, a new concept has emerged recently, that is the design of highly efficient SCs for PC and PEC WS by employing photosensitizers and amorphous MoSx.544,545 This concept is also quite promising because both amorphous MoSx co-catalysts and organic photosensitizers are derived from earth-abundant materials. It may pave a new way for the application of amorphous MoSx in solar WS. However, the poor crystallinity of amorphous MoS2 may lead to a relatively high solubility and a poor electrochemical stability in the acid electrolyte, as well as a slow electron transport rate. One possible solution to solve these problems is the construction of composite co-catalysts by coupling the amorphous MoSx with conducting carbon-based co-catalysts.

3.5. Surface engineering
As mentioned above, PC reactions mainly occur on the surface of SCs. Thus, the surface properties of SCs, such as the number of active sites, defects or co-catalysts play significant roles in enhancing the light absorption, charge separation, PC activity and selectivity for WS, as well as the stability of the SCs. To some degree, surface modifications are the key strategies to develop highly efficient and stable photocatalysts for WS. In general, typical strategies of surface modification include the removal or loading of the surface layer, surface disorder, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, and surface sensitization/passivation, which will be discussed below in detail.

3.5.1 Removal of the Surface layer. 
The surface passivation (or inactive) layer of photocatalysts can usually serve as recombination centers of photogenerated carriers, leading to the low efficiency of the photoelectrodes or photocatalysts. Moreover, the formation of defects on the surface can also act as recombination centers. Thus, the removal of surface defects can enhance the electron transfer from the surface to the co-catalysts or reactants, resulting in a significant enhancement in efficiency. For instance, it was reported that the thermal or mechanical exfoliation of the surface layer, acting as recombination centers, can remarkably improve the PEC performance of a Ta3N5 photoelectrode. Furthermore, the loading of a Co(OH)x co-catalyst can lead to a significant increase in the saturated photocurrent for a sample with surface mechanical exfoliation treatment, as compared to that for samples without such treatment, suggesting that the removal of the surface layer plays a very important role in enhancing the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers.200 Domen's group also reported that removing defective surface reconstructed layers of LaTiO2N particles by a brief aqua regia treatment (for 0.25 min) can double the PC activity.546 This study demonstrated that an etching treatment of the top surface reconstructed layers at the atomic scale can enhance the activity of SC photocatalysts due to the improved separation and transfer of charge carriers by the formation of surface heterojunctions. Therefore, as an advanced strategy, the removal of the surface passivation layer of photocatalysts before loading co-catalysts deserves more attention and deeper studies to optimize the PC performance.


3.5.2 Surface disorders. 
Another breakthrough in the PC splitting under full solar radiation was achieved through hydrogenated black TiO2.164 Chen, et al. found that hydrogenated black TiO2 NPs had a band gap of 1 eV and a clearly-seen disordered surface layer (about 1 nm) was observed with HRTEM.164 The hydrogenated black TiO2 nanocrystals displayed a largely enhanced PC hydrogen production rate in water/methanol solution under sunlight (i.e.10 mmol h−1 g−1 cat.), which is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of most SC photocatalysts. It was found that the lattice disorder resulted in the formation of lower-energy midgap states, which prevent fast recombination photo-excited e− and h+ and enhanced PC activity under sunlight.
Following this report, numerous studies have been carried out. Surface disorders have been confirmed by different groups, though different preparation methods such as hydrogen and Al reduction.547–549 Meanwhile, other non-metal dopants such as N, S and I have also been incorporated into the disordered TiO2−x to further enhance charge separation and PC activity for WS under full solar light.550,551 As a conceptually new strategy of enhancing solar absorption, the surface disorder has lead to extensive applications in different fields, such as lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells. It is highly expected that surface disorder engineering can be used to develop highly efficient co-catalysts (electrocatalysts) for WS.552


3.5.3 Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. 
Another efficient strategy for improving the PC activity of photocatalysts under visible light is to utilize localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which is an intrinsic property of metal NPs such as Au, Ag and Cu.9 These plasmonic NPs as optical antennas or photosensitizers showed strong visible light absorption through the LSPR effects, which resulted in the collective oscillation of the free electrons, and thus enhancing the concentration of charge carriers and the rates of PC reactions in a neighbouring SC.553,554 Three possible enhancement mechanisms have been proposed, including plasmonic induced light absorption and charge transfer from excited plasmonic metal into the SC,555,556 near-field electromagnetic enhancement,557 and scattering of resonant photons.558 As a consequence, most of the fundamental interests towards the interesting LSPR effects of plasmonic metal NPs have focused on the PC or PEC WS under visible-light irradiation.
It has been recognized that the frequency and intensity of LSPR are strongly related to the composition, size, morphology, interparticle distances, local dielectric environment, as well as medium of the metal nanostructures, especially gold and silver.559 For example, it was found that P25 supported 0.2 wt% gold NPs with 1.87 nm size exhibited the highest activity for WS (AQY(H2) = 7.5% and AQY(O2) = 5.0% at 560 nm) because of the LSPR induced light absorption and charge transfer, as shown in Fig. 22.555 Liu et al. reported that the performance of TiO2 films for PEC WS could be enhanced 66-fold through the deposition of plasmonic Au NPs under visible light (λ = 633 nm) due to the LSPR induced near-field electromagnetic enhancement.557 Meanwhile, a 10-fold enhancement in PC activity for the HER was observed by loading 5 wt% plasmonic Ag on nitrogen doped TiO2 because of the formation of intense electric fields at the Ag particle surface, while the addition of Au NPs on nitrogen doped TiO2 has only a small effect on activity for WS.560 Li et al. demonstrated that TiO2 nanowires deposited with a mixture of Au NPs and NRs showed enhanced activities for PEC water oxidation in the entire UV-visible region.561 The results showed that it is a useful strategy to achieve the photoactivity of plasmonic electrodes in the entire visible region by adopting Au nanostructures with different shapes. Furthermore, a Janus Au–TiO2 and an asymmetric Au–CdX plasmonic photocatalyst exhibited a higher activity under visible light than the samples with a symmetrical shell–core structure due to improved LSPR effects by controlling the fine structural configuration.562,563 These two results highlighted that the non-centrosymmetric coupling of plasmonic metal and SCs played a critical role in generating extremely strong local electric near fields. In addition, the coupling of plasmonic Au NPs with photonic crystals or graphene is a promising strategy to achieve a high photocurrent density for PEC water oxidation under visible light due to the synergistic effects of LSPR and photonic crystals.242,564,565
 Fig. 22  Enhancement mechanisms of plasmonic Au NPs on TiO2. 
More interestingly, some plasmonic systems for WS without SCs have also been reported recently. In these systems, all charge carriers were derived from the excitation of surface plasmons. For example, the Pt-tipped Au NRs exhibited much higher activity for PC H2 evolution under visible-NIR light compared with fully covered samples, because the hot electrons from surface plasmons in excited Au NRs can be efficiently transferred to Pt.566 In another plasmonic system, an electron filter and appropriate electrocatalysts are integrated in a gold NR array photoelectrode, leading to an autonomous plasmonic solar water splitter.567 Although the reported STH efficiency (∼0.1%) from this water splitter is too low for practical use, the results demonstrated that it is possible to perform PEC WS by all the effective charge carriers resulting from surface plasmon decay.
Unfortunately, so far, the quantum efficiency for H2 formation over these systems is still relatively low because the LSPR intensity is not strong enough to harvest sufficient incident light. In addition, the chemical and structural stability of plasmonic metal NPs is still very poor, especially for Ag NPs. Thus, from the viewpoint of application, the core–shell structured alloy nanosphere with excellent plasmonic property and stability may shed some light on their applications in PC WS.568 Meanwhile, the coupling of plasmonic metal NPs and nano-carbon is also an advanced strategy, which not only enhances the stability of metal NPs, but also improves the transfer of charges from LSPR, thus leading to enhanced activity.242,569 Furthermore, it is also important to achieve more efficient electron transfer by increasing the contact area between the plasmonic metal NPs and SCs matrix, and protecting the metal NPs from moving together and coagulating.570 In addition, plasmonic metal Cu571 and copper chalcogenide572 NPs deserve more attention in future studies because Cu is an earth-abundant metal compared to Au and Ag. However, Cu and copper chalcogenides are easily oxidized and are unstable in air, and thus the protective layer is crucial for their long-term application.


3.5.4 Surface passivation. 
Due to the presence of surface trapping states, many SCs with lower optical band gaps, such as Si, a-Fe2O3 and BiVO4 suffer from undesirable surface recombination losses and photocorrosion. Thus, passivating the SC surface with a layer of stable material not only reduces the recombination losses and photocorrosion, but also serves as an electro-catalyst to improve the poor OER kinetics. For example, it has been reported that the surface recombination sites of a-Fe2O3 can be efficiently passivated by the surface coating layers containing Al3+ or Sn4+,573 or the overlayers of Al2O3574,575 or Ga2O3,576 thereby partially suppressing surface recombination. Meanwhile, the electrocatalysts Co-Pi577,578 and CoOx574,579 can also be used to passivate the surface of a-Fe2O3 and enhance the OER kinetics. More importantly, these surface treatments can even enhance the thickness of the space charge/electron depletion layer and improve the electron depletion within the film, resulting in a cathodic shift of the photocurrent.574
Another typical example is Si. It is known that silicon NRs with high surface roughness would favor the enhancement in PEC activity for WS, but suffer from undesirable surface recombination losses and photocorrosion, resulting in low efficiency and stability.580 Thus, it is necessary to passivate its surface to enhance its efficiency and stability. So far, the surface passivation of Si has been extensively investigated. Typically, many efficient passivation strategies have been developed, including cobalt-based,542 molybdenum-based97 or nickel-based85,171 treatments, MnO,581 TiO2172,185 and carbon580,582,583 overlayers. Interestingly, Lewis and his coworkers reported that a Si photoanode coated with a layer of amorphous TiO2 (4 to 143 nm thick) and Ni oxide electrocatalysts can exhibit high activity (>30 mA cm−2) and stability (>100 hours), because transparent TiO2 coatings with electronic defects will have a little influence on the absorption of light, but promote hole conduction and transfer to electrocatalysts, thus leading to excellent stability against photocorrosion.172 In addition, for Type I core–shell particle photocatalysts, the shell layer is always used to passivate the surface trap states of the core, thus leading to a strongly enhanced PC activity for WS, as well as improved photostability. For example, the enhanced activity for HER was observed in the core–shell structured CdSe/CdS584 or CdS/ZnS273,585 system due to the passivation effects of the shell layer. For this core–shell system, the control of the shell thickness and porous structure is very important and deserves special attention.273 Therefore, surface passivation should be taken into serious consideration to optimize the stability and activity of photocatalysts for WS.


3.5.5 Surface sensitization. 
Surface sensitization is another strategy to improve the PC activity for WS under visible light irradiation. Dyes and QDs are two of the most commonly used sensitizing reagents to achieve the surface sensitization of wide band-gap SCs. Since the pioneering reports about dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by O'regan and Grätzel in 1991,586 dyes sensitization technologies have been widely used in the PC WS for H2 production because of their ease of fabrication, environmental compatibility and low fabrication cost.587 The mechanism of PC H2 production for dye-sensitized photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 23a. It is clear that dye-sensitized photocatalysts have many advantages, such as good sunlight harvesting in the visible region, and improved charge separation by the SC/sensitizer interface. For example, PC hydrogen evolution has been reported for the dye-sensitized TiO2,588,589 BiVO4,590 C3N4294,295,591 and polyoxotungstate592 and NiO.587 It was found that the molecular electrocatalysts or electron transfer mediator can enhance their efficiencies and stabilities.588,589,593 However, their efficiencies have, so far, been very low because the charge recombination reaction is faster than the catalytic four-electron OER. Thus, it is highly expected that new molecular dyes can be developed for the application of PC WS.594,595 On the other hand, the improvement of efficiency and long-term stability of dye-sensitized photocatalysts are still a great challenge for practical applications.588,593
 Fig. 23  The mechanism of H2 production for (a) dye- and (b) QDs-sensitized SCs. 
Since stable and efficient dyes are very rare, QDs have proven to be a good alternative to conventional organic dyes as sensitizing agents due to their relative stabilities and tunable absorption spectrum through changing the particle size, composition or internal structure. Furthermore, they can generate multiple electron–hole pairs from single absorbed photons, which can greatly enhance the device efficiency. Thus, QDs has been widely used to sensitize SCs with wide band gaps for PC WS. The mechanism of H2 production for QDs-sensitized photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 23b. For example, it is well known that CdS,596 CdSe597,598 or CdTe599 QDs-sensitized, or CdS/CdSe co-sensitized600–602 TiO2 or ZnO photoelectrodes exhibited a significant enhancement in PEC H2-generation activity under visible light illumination due to enhanced visible light absorption by the QDs and improved charge transfer by the interfaces. Meanwhile, Yu et al. demonstrated that CdS QDs-sensitized Zn1−xCdxS solid solutions exhibited enhanced PC H2-production activity from aqueous solutions containing Na2SO3 and Na2S as sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation. This is mainly attributed to the quantum size effect of CdS, leading to the improved electron transfer and enhanced photoactivity.355 However, the QDs in these systems have a similar problem as bulk material. That is, the stability of all cadmium chalcogenide QDs is still very poor owing to hole-induced photocorrosion. Recently, water-oxidation catalysts such as IrOx, CoOx and RuO2 have been found to completely suppress the photocorrosion of cadmium chalcogenide QDs,602,603 which may provide some new ideas for designing highly efficient and stable QDs-sensitized photocatalysts. In addition, the hybrid system made of QDs and molecular co-catalysts has attracted increasing interest recently.271,466,604 As a new direction, it deserves more attention. However, it is still a great challenge to enhance the efficiency and stability of these systems because most reported quantum yields are still below 40%.
Besides CdTe, CdS and CdSe, other QDs with a low cost and toxicity (e.g., Ta3N5,205 silicon,605 C3N4,606 carbon607,608 and GO609) have attracted increasing attention in recent years, which may have great potential to enhance the activity of wide-band-gap SCs for PC and PEC WS under visible light irradiation. In addition, the stability of these potential QDs must be governed carefully when optimizing the PC efficiency of these systems for H2 production.

3.6. Interface engineering (junction)
The junctions of SC/SC and SC/co-catalysts play crucial roles in enhancing the PC or PEC activity for WS. Generally, a tight interface connection between them can lead to an efficient electron transfer, thus causing the improvement of the PC activity for WS; whereas a loose interface may result in the decay of the PC activity. Besides the tightness of the interface, the favorable charge transfer from SC to SC (or co-catalyst) is also particularly important for enhancing the activity for solar WS, which strongly depends on the electronic properties of SCs and co-catalysts. Typically, based on the properties of the solids at the two sides of the interface, the junctions can be divided into three types: phase-junctions, hetero-junctions and Schottky junctions, which are shown in Fig. 24.
 Fig. 24  Schematic diagram of charge transfer in a photocatalytic system with phase-junctions (a), n–n heterojunctions (b), p–n heterojunctions (c) and Schottky junctions (d). 

3.6.1 Homojunctions (phase-junction). 
Constructing phase-junctions (homojunctions) is an alternative strategy to increase PC activity due to improved charge carrier transfer and separation in the interface region between two different phases in close contact. Typically, for TiO2, it is also well known that the anatase has a much higher PC activity than the rutile and brookite. Mixed anatase/rutile including P25 displayed an enhanced PC performance for H2 generation compared to the pure phase due to the synergistic effects between these two phases and the formation of phase-junctions. Therefore, as an efficient strategy, the construction of phase-junctions is widely used in improving PC activity for WS.
For example, Li's group reported that TiO2 samples with different bulk and surface crystalline phases can be obtained by calcination at different temperatures. They found that the PC activity of TiO2 NPs is directly related to the surface-phase composition in the TiO2 sample. The proposed mechanism is shown in Fig. 24a. It is clear that the formation of exposed anatase/rutile phase junctions on the TiO2 surface can facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of the rutile phase to the trapping sites on the anatase surface, thereby improving the charge separation efficiency and enhancing the PC activity.610 The further results demonstrated that SO42− as a stabilizer for the anatase phase can enhance the crystallinity of mixed-phase TiO2 at high temperature calcinations, leading to excellent H2 production activity.611 Recently, enhanced PC activities for H2 production were also reported for the α–β phase junction of Ga2O3.236 It was further verified that the simultaneous exposure of both phases in the outer region is crucial for the charge separation.
However, since the wide band gaps of TiO2 and Ga2O3 limit the practical application of phase-junctions under visible light irradiation, the design of non-titania based visible-light-driven photocatalysts with heterophase junctions has attracted much attention in recent years. Many visible-light-driven photocatalysts with homojunctions have also been reported for PC or PEC WS. For example, recent studies revealed that the heterophase612 or twin613 structure in spherical multi-metal ZnS-based photocatalysts can lead to anisotropy in photocatalysts, which can significantly improve charge transport and separation, thus resulting in an enhanced PC H2 evolution rate. More interestingly, it was reported that the QE of 62% for solar hydrogen evolution can be achieved over twin-induced one-dimensional Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanorod homojunctions without noble metal loading because of the efficient photo-generated charge separation.279 The results further indicated that the construction of photocatalysts with long-range ordered homojunctions at the nanoscale is a powerful strategy to enhance the PC activity for WS. In another interesting report, distributed tungsten-doped BiVO4 homojunctions were created through a gradient dopant method.193 The results demonstrated that charge separation efficiencies of 80% could be achieved by a photoanode made of W-doped BiVO4 homojunctions. A tandem PEC cell composed of amorphous Si junctions, Co-Pi and BiVO4 homojunctions can show a 4 mA cm−2 photocurrent, corresponding to a STH efficiency of 4.9%. Therefore, the formation of homojunctions, especially in visible-light-driven photocatalysts, is of considerable interest and worth noticing for the application in the PC WS.


3.6.2 Heterojunctions. 
The fabrication of SC heterojunctions including p–n and n–n junctions is another important strategy to enhance the PC activity for WS due to the improved separation efficiency of e−–h+ pairs by the internal electric field.614 In general, a built-in electric field will be established at the interface between two contacted SCs when they acquire an equalized Fermi level (as shown in Fig. 24b and c). The built-in electric field can further promote the separation of e−–h+ pairs, thus leading to an enhanced PC activity for the HER or OER.
It is known that n–n heterojunctions have been widely reported in PC or PEC WS due to the promoted separation of photogenerated charges and enhanced activity for WS. For PC WS, CdS/TiO2 composite photocatalysts are the most widely studied n–n heterojunctions, which exhibit significantly enhanced activity towards H2 generation from water containing sulfide/sulfite or absorbed H2S as sacrificial reagents.615–617 Moreover, different strategies (such as loading suitable co-catalysts484,618–622 and controlling the size and morphology of TiO2 or CdS622) have been used to further improve the photoactivities of the CdS/TiO2 heterojunctions for H2 evolution. Other n–n heterojunctions, such as Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3(La,Cr),623 CdS/C3N4395 and CdS/CeOx303 have also been constructed and applied in PC WS under visible light irradiation. For PEC WS, the planar624 or nanostructured197,625 WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanodes have been reported to show an enhanced PEC activity for the OER because of the efficient separation of photo-excited charges at the interface of the WO3/BiVO4 junction. Recently, Feng's group demonstrated that RGO sheets as an excellent electron transporter can accelerate the charge transfer across the heterojunction between a Fe2O3 nanorod array and BiV1−xMoxO4,626 resulting in an enhancement of PEC activity. To further enhance the PEC activity for water oxidation, a 3D branched Co–Fe2O3-nanorod array/MgFe2O4627 heterojunction photoanode was successfully developed by the same group, which showed a 2.69 times enhancement in the photocurrent density as compared to the Fe2O3-nanorod array. In addition, they also reported that a 3D branched WO3 nanosheet array/C3N4/CoOx layered heterojunction photoanode with face contact exhibited a significantly enhanced PEC activity for the OER.213 The enhanced light-harvesting ability, the unique 3D layered nanostructure, improved water oxidation kinetics, and excellent charge transfer and separation are the possible reasons for the enhanced properties.
Besides n–n junctions, p–n junctions and multi-junctions have also been constructed to perform PC and PEC WS, as shown in Fig. 24c. For instance, Lee et al. first prepared a particulate p–n junctioned composite photocatalyst of CaFe2O–PbBi2Nb1.9W0.1O9 according to the concept of a photochemical p–n heterojunction diode. The results showed that the efficient charge separation lead to the enhanced PC activity for individual H2 and O2 evolution from aqueous solutions containing methanol and silver nitrate, respectively.628 Recently, they also reported that a five-fold enhancement of the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. NHE was achieved by the introduction of a CaFe2O4 over-layer onto a TaON photoanode without any co-catalyst under simulated sun light.206 The formation of intimate contact heterojunctions is critical for efficient charge separation, thereby leading to the enhancement of PEC activity. Furthermore, Lewis and his coworkers demonstrated that a Pt/n+p–Si nanowire array radial-junction photocathode was relatively stable and yielded an energy-conversion efficiency >5% under AM 1.5G illumination, which was far higher than the efficiency <0.2% of a p-Si wire-array photoelectrode.629 In addition, one of the best known examples is the monolithic PEC/photovoltaic device reported by Turner and Khaselev in 1998.178 They used a tandem photocathode composed of a p-type GaInP2 and a single GaAs p–n junction. This resulted in an impressive efficiency of 12.4% (STH). But the photoelectrode materials in this cell are costly and not stable under operating conditions, which can undergo photocorrosion. In addition, Nocera and his coworkers constructed triple-junction wired and wireless cells for WS, which showed good stabilities and very high STH efficiencies of 4.7% and 2.5%, respectively.89 All of these results show that the p–n junction and multi-junction are very promising candidates for PEC or PC WS.
In future studies, it is of great interest to construct 2D layer-by-layer composite photocatalysts because the layered junction with face contact has a large contact surface and a short charge transport time and distance compared to the interface with point contact or line contact, which is beneficial for promoting the separation of electron–hole pairs and enhancing activity and stability.630 Furthermore, three-component multi-heterojunctions with the appropriate band alignment are also promising in the application of solar WS.631,632 Especially, core–shell structured three-component nanostructures involving two low band gap photoactive materials and a stable wide-band-gap SC are attractive and may be considered as third generation materials that could serve as photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for solar WS.632 This is because a stable wide-band-gap SC as a shell layer can passivate the surface of the other two SCs with low band gap in the core, and improve their stability, thus enhancing charge separation.632 In addition, to obtain high quality heterostructures, there are many other factors, such as the matching of the lattice and energy band, and the tightness of the interface between the two SCs, which should be carefully designed and optimized.


3.6.3 Junctions between co-catalyst and SCs. 
The interface between the co-catalyst and an SC is another important junction because the loading of a suitable co-catalyst has been regarded as a popular strategy to promote the activity for solar WS. Among all kinds of junctions between a co-catalyst and SC, the Schottky junction is commonly used due to the favorable charge transfer and increased active sites. The mechanism of charge transfer in a PC system with Schottky junctions is shown in Fig. 24d. As observed in Fig. 24d, a metal and an n-type SC have different Fermi level positions. When coupling them together, electrons can transfer from the SC to the metal until the two Fermi levels are aligned. Thus, a Schottky barrier can form at the metal–SC interface due to the upward surface band bending of the SC, which can serve as an efficient electron trap to prevent electron–hole recombination, thereby leading to an enhanced activity for solar WS.319 Meanwhile, the metal can also play an important role in providing active sites for the PC hydrogen evolution. It was first reported that the formation of Schottky junctions in a Pt/TiO2 system can promote the charge separation and lead to an enhancement in PC activity for WS because Pt has the largest work function and the lowest activation energy for H2 evolution among many noble metals.633 Besides Pt, the Schottky junction between the SC and other noble metals such as Ag has also been reported. However, the promoting effects for H2 production in these systems are generally lower than that in the Pt/SC system. In general, it is accepted that the morphology or geometrical factor of Pt does not affect the PC properties of the mixed system because of the low optimum loading of Pt (about 1.0 wt%) and the small Pt particle size (2 nm).319 However, recently, it was found that the Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the H2 evolution rate for PC WS.634–636 For the system of Pt/TiO2, the maximum H2 production rate was found for Pt46 due to the size dependent electronic properties of clusters with respect to the band edges of the SC.636 In another example, plasmonic Au was introduced into the interface between TiO2 and CdS, thus forming an interfacial Schottky barrier, which greatly increases the charge transfer lifetime, reduces the trap-state Auger rate, suppresses the long-timescale back-transfer and partially compensates the negative effects of the surface trap states.621 Thus, it is expected that the Schottky junction can be better governed and used in highly efficient systems for solar WS.
In addition, Boettcher and Lin recently discovered that redox-active ion-permeable electrocatalysts, such as Ni(OH)2 or NiOOH yield ‘adaptive’ SC/electrocatalyst junctions where the effective Schottky barrier height changes in situ with the oxidation level of the electrocatalyst.637 It was also pointed out that the junction between Co-Pi (or FeOOH) and BiVO4 is also an adaptive junction. In contrast, dense, ion-impermeable IrOx electrocatalysts yield constant-barrier-height ‘buried’ junctions. Thus, such a new class of adaptive SC junctions may provide new insight for the rational design of highly efficient photoanodes for WS.


3.6.4 Junctions between nano-carbon materials and SCs. 
In addition to homojunctions and heterojunctions, metal-free nano-carbon materials also play significant roles in improving the HER activity of SCs. Importantly, they are rather cheap, abundant, stable and non-toxic. Indeed, early studies have demonstrated that the hybridization of nano-carbon materials and SC photocatalysts provides a powerful strategy to design highly efficient photocatalysts for the PC WS due to the formation of the Schottky junctions between nano-carbon materials and SCs (as shown in Fig. 24d). Among various nano-carbon materials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene are the most attractive candidates due to their outstanding properties.
It is known that CNTs possess a unique one-dimensional structure, black color, large electron-storage capacity, good electron conductivity, good chemical stability, excellent mechanical strength, a large specific surface area (>150 m2 g−1), and mesoporous character. All of these features favor an enhancement in the PC performance of composite photocatalysts for the HER. So far, it has already been verified that CNTs in nanocomposites not only enhance photon absorption as a photosensitizer and increase the surface reaction centres as an alternative co-catalyst, but also suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in SCs as electron collectors and transfer channels. Sometimes, they can also play important roles in anchoring photoctalysts as conducting scaffolds or supports.638–642 As a consequence, CNTs have attracted increasing interests in the construction of highly efficient composite photocatalysts.
However, compared to applications in the photo-degradation of organic pollutants, there are too few reports on the application of SC–CNT nanocomposite photocatalysts in the fields of PC WS. Typically, for TiO2, CdS, CdxZn1−xS, Ta2O5 and g-C3N4, significant enhancement in the PC activity for the HER were generally achieved. As an example, Kim and Park reported that the hybrid of CNTs and CdS can significantly enhance the PC activity for HER by a factor of 17, but it was very sensitive to the surface-treatment of CNTs.643 In binary hybrids, CdS modified by the CNTs annealed at 500 °C exhibited the best hydrogen production due to improved purity and crystallinity of the CNTs. However, in ternary hybrids, CdS/acid-treated CNT/Pt has the largest amount of hydrogen production due to a larger amount of Pt adsorption on the CNTs.643 Yu et al. reported that a loading of 0.25 wt% CNTs on Cd0.1Zn0.9S can achieve an AQY of 7.9% for H2 production at 420 nm, which was 3.3 times higher than that of the pure Cd0.1Zn0.9S, indicating that the CNTs can suppress the recombination of charge carriers and enhance the activity for H2 evolution as effective co-catalysts and excellent electron collectors and transporters.644 Surprisingly, Domen et al. reported that nanocarbon–Ta2O5 hybrid photocatalysts exhibited a 35 times higher activity for the HER via sacrificial WS than comparable materials such as Ta2O5–NTs. The single-crystalline nature of the coating and the formation of a tight Schottky-type junction between the SC and CNTs were thought to be important factors achieving remarkable enhancement in the activity for HER.249
Compared to CNTs, there have been many reports about SC–graphene nanocomposite photocatalysts for PC H2 evolution because graphene has some advantages over CNTs. It is clear that graphene has a much higher optical transmittance, conductivity (∼5000 Wm−1 K−1), electron mobility (200000 cm2 V−1 s−1), specific surface area (∼2600 m2 g−1) and contact area than CNTs.645,646 Meanwhile, the reported reduction potential of graphene/graphene˙− (about −0.08 eV vs. SHE, pH = 0) is a little higher than the energy level for water reduction (0.00 V vs. SHE, pH = 0).275 Furthermore, graphene is nontoxic and biocompatible. Interestingly, partially oxidized graphene oxide (GO) itself can be directly applied as a photocatalyst for H2 generation under UV illumination, and its bandgap can also be tuned by its oxidation level.647 Thus, significant advances have been made on the developments of SC/graphene-based photocatalysts since the pioneering studies by Kamat and coworkers.648,649
For instance, Yu and coworkers investigated the PC H2 evolution property of RGO–ZnxCd1−xS nanocomposites.275 They found that the PC H2 evolution rate over 0.25 wt% RGO-loaded Zn0.8Cd0.2S was 4.5 times higher than that of pristine Zn0.8Cd0.2S, which is even higher than that of 1 wt% Pt-loaded Zn0.8Cd0.2S. The results demonstrate that RGO is a promising co-catalyst to replace noble metals, which can play important roles in promoting the charge transfer and separation, and increasing the surface active sites for water reduction. Similar results were also reported for RGO/TiO2 and RGO/C3N4 systems by the same group.247,296 To further improve the PC performance of graphene-based materials, the anchoring of suitable co-catalysts on graphene as composite co-catalysts are also widely used.648 For example, the ternary CdS/Pt/graphene (Fig. 25a) and TiO2/MoS2/graphene (Fig. 25b) hybrid photocatalysts were also reported by the same group.94,259 The results revealed that the optimized TiO2/MoS2/graphene and CdS/Pt/graphene reached a QE of 9.7% at 365 nm and a QE of 22.5% at 420 nm, respectively. The significantly increased activity was likely caused by the synergetic effects between the graphene and supported co-catalysts, such as MoS2 or Pt (Fig. 25b). It is also noticed from the above results that the highest PC activity can be generally obtained at an appropriate amount of graphene (≤1 wt%) because the excess graphene loading would block a portion of the active sites and render light absorption due to the light-shielding effects, thus leading to a significant decrease of the PC activity.
 Fig. 25  Schematic illustration of the charge separation and transfer in the CdS/Pt/graphene system (a) and TiO2/MoS2/graphene system (b). 
Besides, it has been reported that heteroatom-doped CNTs or graphenes are highly efficient electrocatalysts in the ORR or OER.650–652 More recently, a reported composite of graphitic-carbon nitride and nitrogen-doped graphene showed an unexpectedly high electrocatalytic activity toward HER with a comparable overpotential and Tafel slope to Pt electrocatalysts.653 Furthermore, the nitrogen-doped carbon-based photocatalysts or photoelectrodes also showed enhanced activity for WS.582,609,654 Generally, nitrogen impurities can facilitate the formation of catalytic sites. Thus, it is highly expected that promising heteroatom-doped CNTs or graphene can be deeply investigated and applied in PC WS.655 In addition, since a highly efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalyst based on carbon nanotube–graphene complexes was reported,656 the synergistic effect of CNTs and graphene on improving electrocatalytic and PC properties has also become a topic of constant interest in the field of WS, which still deserves deep studies in the near future.

4. Conclusion and prospective
A growing interest in the conversion of water and solar energy into H2 fuels using earth-abundant materials has emerged due to the depletion of fossil fuel and serious environmental problems in recent years. In general, to achieve sufficient efficiency for solar WS, it seems necessary to design heterogeneous SCs by combining different engineering strategies because many SCs and co-catalysts suffer from one or several limitations, such as poor activity and stability, high cost and toxicity, complicated synthesis methods, and low visible light absorption. Over the past few decades many different strategies listed above have been successfully designed and applied in solar WS, and significant progress has been made in constructing heterogeneous photocatalysts for solar WS.
More effort should be focused on investigating the synergistic effects of the different engineering strategies on the activity for solar WS in future studies. It is known that a single strategy only improves the activity for WS to some degree in general rather than dealing with everything. For instance, although the one-dimensional or multi-dimensional nanostructure photocatalysts exhibit improved activities for solar WS, the intrinsic properties of SC materials cannot be solved by the unique nanostructure. So far, the coupling of different strategies has led to many famous photocatalysts with high visible-light activities for WS, such as solid solution (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) loaded with Rh2−yCryO3 co-catalysts,21 Pt–PdS–CdS,268 twinned Cd0.5Zn0.5S anisotropic nanorod279 and nanostructured CoO.22 Among them, special attention should be paid on the loading of co-catalysts, which cannot only enhance the kinetics of water oxidation and reduction and thus suppress the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes on the surface of SCs, but also increase the stability of SCs. It is worth noting that the suitable loading of co-catalysts can improve the activities of WS by 1–2 order of magnitude. Thus, the combination of co-catalyst loading and other strategies seems to be more promising in developing highly efficient photocatalysts. In addition, surface and interface performances must be taken into account, considering they also play important roles in enhancing activity for WS. Generally, a close contact interface with low defects can benefit the charge transfer and separation, thus leading to the improvement of activity for solar WS.
Meanwhile, future efforts should be directed to the further understanding of the detailed thermodynamics and kinetics in interfacial electron and hole transfer at the fundamental level.657–659 The manipulation of interfacial charge transfer plays an important role in improving the PC and PEC efficiency. Importantly, a thorough understanding of the charge-transfer thermodynamics between SCs and SCs (or co-catalyst/sacrificial donors) is critical for finding the key efficiency-limiting step and designing more efficient solar-to-fuel conversion systems.165 In addition, it is of significant importance to deeply understand the relationships between the molecular-level structures and the PC/PEC properties of heterogeneous SCs, which could be partially addressed through first-principle DFT calculations.
There are still many scientific and technical challenges and open questions in the field of solar WS. Fundamental studies are essential to tackle the bottleneck problems in the field (i.e., improved charge separation and transfer, promoted optical absorption, optimized band gap position, lowered cost and toxicity, and enhanced stability and WS kinetics). So far, many different engineering strategies, such as band structure engineering, micro/nano engineering, bionic engineering, co-catalyst engineering, surface and interface engineering, of heterogeneous SC photocatalysts are now available for designing highly efficient photocatalysts for solar WS. It is highly expected in future that artificial photosynthesis devices will “see the light of day”,660 and the breakthroughs for bringing this technology to reality can occur when all these problems and engineering strategies above have been taken into consideration and the PC system has been well designed.
