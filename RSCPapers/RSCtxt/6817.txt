    , Accepted 17th July 2020First published on 22nd July 2020AbstractBismuth based perovskites are emerging as a candidate for photovoltaic applications due to their low-toxicity, high structural stability, and suitable applications in photovoltaic applications. Here in this work, bismuth halide perovskite films with the stoichiometric composition of ABi3I10 (A = Cs, FA and MA) are synthesized by a one step solution process. By optimizing the appropriate anti-solvent dripping techniques, the surface morphology and optical properties of these perovskite thin films have been improved. Among the synthesized materials, CsBi3I10 perovskite showed extended absorption up to 700 nm and the bandgap was reduced to 1.75 eV. An inverted planar perovskite solar cell (PSC) employing the CsBi3I10 as an absorber layer was fabricated which showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 0.63%. In addition, the fabricated PSC exhibited a red-shifted incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) up to 740 nm, which is higher than those of the existing bismuth-based PSCs. This improvement in the IPCE shows the potential of CsBi3I10 as an absorber for Pb-free PSCs.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications have been attracting attention over the past decade due to their excellent optical and electrical properties combined with the low production cost. During the developmental stage, many improvements have been experimentally realized regarding the properties of the perovskite compounds such as structural stability and band-gap optimization in order to increase the resulting device performance with high open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and better lifetime of the device.1–5 With stage by stage development over the years, current Pb based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have managed to show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 25.2% (ref. 6) at the laboratory scale. However, some factors still limit the commercialization of PSCs, like (i) toxicity of Pb and (ii) low device stability in the ambient atmosphere. Hence, metals with similar optoelectronic properties to Pb are under constant investigation.7
The replacement of Pb with other materials must be attempted to develop Pb-free perovskite materials using metal elements such as Sn, Ge, Bi and Sb.8–10 However, none of these materials exhibit better or similar photovoltaic performance as compared to Pb-based PSCs. Apart from Pb, Tin (Sn) based perovskite materials have gained noticeable momentum among these materials; for example, FASnI3 has achieved promising efficiency.11–16 Unfortunately, Sn-based perovskite materials are prone to oxidation in the ambient environment because Sn2+ is very easily oxidized to Sn4+ due to the high-lying 5s orbitals of Sn2+. Hence, the Sn-based PSCs require an environmentally controlled and very sophisticated fabrication facility to prevent oxidation.17,18 In this regard, bismuth (Bi) based halide perovskite has emerged as a promising alternative for the replacement of Pb with an additional advantage of demonstrating little evidence of toxicity.19 Moreover, Bi3+ has similar electronic configuration ([Xe] 4f145d106s26p0) as compared to Pb2+ in the perovskite configuration. Bismuth halides form a stable Bi3+ oxidation state which leads to stable 6s2 valence electrons providing an opportunity to replicate the perovskite electronic structure.20 Due to these advantages, Bi based PSCs are slowly gaining momentum. Despite much effort, the performances of the Bi-based PSCs are still very low.21–23 Out of many factors, the poor morphology of the bismuth perovskite absorber layer including pinhole formation leads to short circuit of the overall device, larger optical band-gap, poor solubility in common solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL), low absorption and energy level mismatch with the electron/hole transport layers. To overcome some of these problems, recently, we have reported a two-step simple evaporation technique to obtain pinhole-free compact MA3Bi2I9 (MBI) perovskite thin-films, where we evaporated methylammonium iodide over spin-coated BiI3 thin-films and improved the film morphology of the MBI perovskite films.24 Ran et al. reported the thermal deposition technique to improve the MBI perovskite films.25 Although these reported methods resulted in a better film formation but the fabrication cost and longer processing time remain arguable as compared to those for the solution-based process.26 Sanders et al. reported the synthesis of MA3Bi2I9via a one-step spin coating method for PSCs, but their fabricated films showed very poor morphology, weak photoluminescence emission and a very low efficiency of 0.2%.27 Even though MBI perovskite shows better performance, it has a serious solubility problem with common solvents such as DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide), DMSO (N,N-dimethylsulphoxide) and GBL (γ-butyrolactone). Park et al. reported the synthesis of cation Cs+ substituted bismuth-based perovskite solar cells through solution processing techniques and found that Cs based bismuth triiodide perovskites showed better properties compared to MBI perovskites.28 M. B. Johansson et al. extensively studied the photophysical properties of both Cs3Bi2I9 and CsBi3I10 perovskites, and the results suggested that CsBi3I10 has a wide range of absorption up to 700 nm with a photocurrent higher than those of all the other bismuth halide perovskites.29 Additionally, the same group reported metal halide compounds prepared from solution and consisting of a mixture of two crystalline phases, Cs3Bi2I9 and BiI3, using a ratio intermediate of the stoichiometry and pure BiI3. Higher PCE (0.62%) and lower band gap (1.77 eV) were recorded compared to the pure crystalline phase. However, the absorption was limited due to the poor surface morphology. The respective PSCs showed the best incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) at 700 nm.30 Shin et al. fabricated CsBi3I10 based PSCs and achieved a PCE of 1% with a mesoporous device structure.31 Kadhka et al. recently reported Cs+ cation based bismuth halide PSCs with inverted planar device configuration and the device showed 35% light absorption in the 400–650 nm region due to the large band gap (2.03 eV) and poor surface morphology with the presence of numerous pinholes.32 A study of several of these reports on bismuth-based perovskite reveals that the optimization of perovskite layers to improve the surface morphology is essential to achieve high performance devices. In this regard, numerous studies have been reported on solvent assisted crystallization techniques.33–35 Moreover, the lack of systematic investigation on morphological tailoring, a practical route to fully utilize the potential of the CsBi3I10 perovskite material, might be a bottleneck for implementing CsBi3I10 in photovoltaic applications.
In this work, we report the synthesis and fabrication of low band-gap bismuth-based perovskite materials with the chemical composition of ABi3I10 (A = MA, FA and Cs) as a light-harvesting layer in Pb-free PSCs. We have developed systematic studies of solvent engineering and anti-solvent dripping techniques for the synthesis of CsBi3I10 perovskite active layers to improve the surface morphology with a homogeneous and pinhole free surface. We observed improved optical properties from our fabricated CsBi3I10 thin films compared to FABi3I10 and MABi3I10. CsBi3I10 shows enhanced absorption and low optical band-gap (1.75 eV). Besides, we explain the effect of different anti-solvents such as chlorobenzene, toluene, isopropanol, diethyl ether, chloroform, and methanol in the perovskite crystal on film formation. After optimization, we fabricated PSCs in the low temperature processed inverted planar device structure with CsBi3I10 which showed a PCE up to 0.63%. The IPCE of the respective PSC red-shifted in the visible region up to 740 nm, which is a promising result compared to other bismuth-based counterparts.
Experimental section
Materials
BiI3 (TCI chemicals, 98%), CsI (Kanto chemicals, 99.99%), methylammonium hydroiodide (TCI chemicals, 98%), Formamidine hydroiodide (TCI chemicals, 98%), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.8%), anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%), PCBM (99.5%, Lumtec Co., Taiwan), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), toluene, and methanol were purchased from Wako, Japan. All the chemicals were utilized without any purification process.
Solar cell fabrication
Indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned by using an ultrasonic process in isopropanol, ethanol and acetone for 1 h each. After drying under a nitrogen stream, the substrates were further cleaned using UV Ozone for 30 min. The HTM layer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), was spin-coated on the ITO substrate in two steps, first at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and was dried at 150 °C for 15 min. An ABi3I10 perovskite solution was spin-coated on top of the HTM layer with two steps of spin coating, first at 1000 rpm for 12 s and then at 5000 rpm for 30 s. While spinning, a certain amount of anti-solvent was dropped onto the perovskite film 10 s before the start of the spin coating at 5000 rpm. Finally, the film was annealed at 130 °C for 10 min. After cooling down to room temperature, a solution of PCBM in chlorobenzene (20 mg L−1) was spin-coated on top of the film at 3000 rpm for 20 s followed by a saturated methanol solution of bathocuproine which was spin-coated on top of the PCBM layer. The device fabrication was completed by thermal evaporation of a 70 nm thick film of Au as the cathode. The pictorial representation of thin film coating is depicted in Scheme 1.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the ABi3I10 (A = FA, MA & Cs) perovskite films was performed by using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku MiniFlex 600) with irradiation of Cu Kα (1.540598 Å). The spectra were obtained using a D/teX Ultra 2 detector for 2θ = 5° to 70° at a step width of 0.02° at a 1° min−1 scanning rate with a source slit width of 1 mm. UV-Vis spectroscopy was performed with a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. A photoemission yield spectrometer, Riken Keiki AC-3E, was used to measure the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the respective films. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) of the ABi3I10 (A = FA, MA and Cs) perovskite film was performed using a Hitachi FE-SEM SU83230 and SII L-trace. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were conducted with a J. A. Woolman M-2000U. The J–V characteristics were measured by using a WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan with an active area of 0.09 cm2 under AM1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained with a CEP-2000BX, Bunko Keiki under a monochromatic incident light intensity of 1 × 1016 photons per cm in direct current mode.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern obtained for the CsBi3I10 perovskite layer deposited on ITO substrates by a one-step solution process without anti solvent dripping. The XRD patterns for the respective ABi3I10 (A = Cs, MA and FA) films are shown in Fig. S1(a)† for comparison and were prepared by the same one-step solution process without introducing any anti solvent. The most significant peaks for all CsBi3I10, MABi3I10 and FABi3I10 were in accordance with the reported results.31 The (006) peaks of the MABi3I10 and FABi3I10 films were relatively weaker than the (006) peak of the CsBi3I10 film. The most significant peaks for the CsBi3I10 perovskite structure were (003), (006) and (300) at 12.8°, 25.25°, and 42°, respectively. This suggests that the growth direction of CsBi3I10 is along the growth direction of the BiI3 structure.29 In addition, the XRD patterns of the MABi3I10 and FABi3I10 films show a strong peak (105) at 24.8°, while this peak is absent in the CsBi3I10 film. Cesium (Cs+) cation based perovskite has been chosen due to the enhanced materials properties as reported in earlier work.29–31 It was found that most of the efficient PSCs are obtained with Cs+ cations rather than methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+) cations in bismuth halide perovskites. The choice of the Cs+ cation was based on its small radius (188 pm) compared to those of MA+(217 pm) and FA+ (253 pm); thus the anti-distortive octahedral distortions induced in the edge-sharing octahedral network due to the large size of the A cation shifted against nearly octahedral and these completely inorganic counterparts may improve the structural stability of the perovskites.36,37

Fig. 1(b) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the CsBi3I10 perovskite thin-film and the UV-visible spectra of other cation (MA+ and FA+) based perovskite thin-films are shown in Fig. S1(b).† All the three different cation based bismuth perovskites showed enhanced absorption up to 700 nm. Fig. S1(c)† shows that the bandgap decreases dramatically for all ABi3I10 (Cs, FA and MA) perovskite thin-films in comparison with other bismuth-based perovskite compositions (A3Bi2X 9 (2.0–2.2 eV)) and bismuth-based double perovskite materials (A2BBiX6 (2.2–2.6 eV)).21,22 Of these three different cation-based films, CsBi3I10 showed enhanced light harvesting in the visible region with lower bandgap (1.75 eV) than the MABi3I10 (1.95 eV) and FABi3I10 (1.9 eV). This band-gap improvement is due to the BiI3 rich composition. A large red-shift of the band-gap energy was obtained from the CsBi3I10 perovskite with a bandgap of 1.75 eV (700 nm).29,31
Fig. S1(d)† presents the valence band (VB) level of the ABi3I10 perovskite thin-films determined from the photoemission yield spectroscopy measurement. The valence band energy (Ev) values of the ABi3I10 perovskite thin films are −5.9 eV (CsBi3I10), −6.1 eV (MABi3I10) and −6.0 eV (FABi3I10). Based on the difference between the HOMO level and band gap of the perovskite materials CsBi3I10 (1.75 eV), FABi3I10 (1.9 eV) and MABi3I10 (1.95 eV), the LUMO level has been calculated for all the three materials to be −4.15 eV (CsBi3I10), −4.1 eV (FABi3I10) and −4.15 eV (MABi3I10). Our solution-processed CsBi3I10 perovskite thin-films showed a lower Ev value (−5.9 eV) than the previous reports (Ev = −6.13 eV).29–31 The conduction band energy (Ec) was recorded at −4.15 eV in respect to the optical band gap of 1.75 eV. This lower bandgap and enhanced optical properties indicate the improvement of light-harvesting, which is more crucial for the photovoltaic applications. Fig. S2(a–c)† shows the surface morphology of the ABi3I10 perovskite thin films observed by SEM. The SEM images reveal that ABi3I10 films were homogeneous with full surface coverage. In particular, the surface of the CsBi3I10 film is more uniform than those of the MABi3I10 and FABi3I10 films. Based on the above-mentioned optical properties, due to it possessing enhanced absorption, low bandgap and suitable energy level compared to FABi3I10 and MABi3I10, we have selected the CsBi3I10 perovskite materials for further optimization and device fabrication. Moreover, this bismuth halide perovskite has a suitable band gap for the perovskite–perovskite tandem device structure due to the broader band gap and the solution-processed top-layer production simplifies the processing steps further.
By using the mixed solvent approach of the DMF:DMSO solvent system, we have optimized the crystallization and growth dynamics of the CsBi3I10 perovskite layer. Additional control of the surface morphology has been achieved by using the anti-solvent dripping technique in perovskite layer formation with the optimized DMF:DMSO solvent system. It is well known that DMF and DMSO are the suitable solvents used for perovskite phase formation due to their capability of forming intermediate complexes in the perovskite precursor solution. To optimize the volume ratio of the DMF:DMSO solvent system, different ratios (5:5, 6:4 and 7:3) have been used for the perovskite thin-film formation. Due to the better interaction of the perovskite precursor materials with the solvents, the surface morphology of the films has been improved which is observed in the SEM images (Fig. 2(a–d)). For the films fabricated with DMF only, the perovskite growth was distorted and non-uniform with an uneven surface. The SEM images of perovskite films prepared with 5:5 and 6:4 volume ratios of solvents show larger pinholes with severe non-uniform coverage on the respective substrates, indicating that these volume ratios are not adequate for the full perovskite film conversion from the respective precursor solutions. In this solvent engineering process, we observed that the 7:3 ratio of DMF:DMSO can lead to successful formation of the perovskite material after annealing at 130 °C. To further elucidate the absorption capability of the CsBi3I10 perovskite layer prepared with different volume ratios of solvents, UV-visible spectroscopy was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 3(a). It is noticeable that in the UV-visible spectrum of the 5:5 and 6:4 volume ratio solvent-based thin-films absorption decreases with the increased amount of DMSO, due to the presence of unreacted BiI3 in the respective precursor solution. The absorption coefficient of the thin-film prepared by using a 7:3 volume ratio of the DMF:DMSO solvent system is higher than those of the perovskite thin-films prepared with other volume ratios of solvents (5:5 or 6:4) and only DMF.

(d) Enlarged view of the XRD pattern with relative peak intensity difference between pristine (without anti-solvent) and chlorobenzene treated CsBi3I10 perovskite thin films prepared with a 7:3 (DMF:DMSO) solvent ratio. 
To further enhance the surface morphology of the CsBi3I10 perovskite thin films we adopted the anti-solvent dripping technique. In the solvent/anti-solvent crystallization process, the formation of small crystals is induced by rapid precipitation of the super saturation level and the reduction of solution is seen in the anti-solvent treatment process. The rapid precipitation of the super saturation level depends on the miscibility of the anti-solvent with the solvent. In the process of the anti-solvent dripping technique, the local super saturation level was created by the anti-solvent in the precursor solution. With the principle of immiscibility and miscibility, we have performed our experiments with different anti-solvents such as chlorobenzene, toluene, isopropanol (miscible in both DMF and DMSO), diethyl ether (miscible only in DMF), chloroform and methanol. We have conducted UV-visible spectroscopy measurements to determine the absorption capability and intensity of the CsBi3I10 perovskite layer treated with different anti-solvents and the results are presented in Fig. 3(b). The absorption spectra of the CsBi3I10 perovskite layer fabricated by using chlorobenzene, toluene and isopropanol overlap with each other. All three films exhibited similar band edge at 700 nm, which corresponds to the band gap excitation of the CsBi3I10 perovskite material. Furthermore, the CsBi3I10 perovskite layer treated with diethyl ether, methanol and chloroform anti-solvents led to an extremely low absorption spectrum and these anti-solvents completely dissolved the perovskite precursors, which consequently affected perovskite nucleation. Therefore, diethyl ether, methanol and chloroform are unsuitable as anti-solvents for the preparation of the Bi halide based perovskite layer. Fig. 3(c) shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite films treated with different anti-solvents. After the anti-solvent treatment, the XRD patterns of the CsBi3I10 perovskite films treated with chlorobenzene, toluene and isopropanol show the complete formation of CsBi3I10 perovskite with significant peaks of (003), (006) and (115). For comparison, the XRD pattern of the pristine CsBi3I10 perovskite film prepared without anti-solvent treatment is added in the graph. Fig. 3(d) shows the XRD pattern for peak intensity comparison between the pristine (without anti-solvent) CsBi3I10 perovskite film and the chlorobenzene anti-solvent treated film. It shows improved intensity in the peaks corresponding to the chlorobenzene treated CsBi3I10 perovskite film, which indicates the improvement of crystallinity in the respective perovskite film. This is in contrast to treatment with the other anti-solvents such as chloroform, diethyl ether and methanol, for which the significant peaks of CsBi3I10 perovskite were not present, which indicates that perovskite formation was not completed due to the weak interaction of the perovskite precursor with the respective anti-solvents.

Fig. 4 shows the surface morphology (SEM images) of the CsBi3I10 perovskite thin-films with different anti-solvent treatments (chlorobenzene, toluene, isoproponal, diethyl ether, methanol and chloroform), along with the photographs of anti-solvent treated perovskite thin film samples (inset images). In the thin-film fabrication process, the anti-solvents were added dropwise on the surface of the perovskite layer. Here we have fixed the anti-solvent amount at 140 μl after the trial experiments with different amounts of anti-solvent (180 μl, 200 μl, 400 μl, 500 μl, 600 μl and 800 μl). The solution of the anti-solvent can effectively reduce the solubility of the solute in the precursor solution, but it does not completely inhibit it. It also drives the homogeneous nucleation due to super-saturation. In the present study, only three anti-solvents (isopropanol, chlorobenzene, and toluene) have been considered suitable among all the other anti-solvents (diethyl ether, methanol and chloroform) for the CsBi3I10 layer fabrication. The influence of the anti-solvent dripping on the surface morphology and structural properties of perovskite films was studied in detail.
 Fig. 4  Top-view SEM images of CsBi3I10 films prepared from a 7:3 (DMF:DMSO) solvent ratio and treated with different anti-solvents, (a) chlorobenzene, (b) isopropanol, (c) toluene, (d) chloroform, (e) diethyl ether and (f) methanol. 

Fig. 4(a)–(c) show the surface morphology of the CsBi3I10 films, where the resultant film shows better surface morphology. This result suggests that the interaction between the perovskite precursor and chlorobenzene is much better for the crystallization process, which was confirmed by the XRD pattern of CsBi3I10 films treated with chlorobenzene. The perovskite thin films treated with isopropanol and toluene anti-solvents also show relatively good surface morphology. The high magnification SEM images of chlorobenzene, isopropanol and toluene are also shown in Fig. S3.† However, in Fig. 4(d)–(f), it can be seen that CsBi3I10 thin-films treated with the anti-solvents chloroform, diethyl ether and methanol, respectively, can result in discontinuous coverage and pinholes on the surface of the CsBi3I10 films. For the diethyl ether and methanol treated CsBi3I10 films, only unreacted BiI3 is present on the surface of the film.
To evaluate the performance of the optimized CsBi3I10 perovskite thin-film prepared with a 7:3 ratio of the DMF:DMSO solvent system and treated with the chlorobenzene anti-solvent, we have fabricated an inverted planar type PSC structure using the following device configuration (Fig. 5(a)): ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsBi3I10/PCBM/BCP/Au. Fig. 5(b) shows the energy levels of the various layers employed in the PSCs. Here, the ITO substrate is used as a conductive transparent electrode, PEDOT:PSS as a hole transport layer, CsBi3I10 perovskite as a light absorber layer, PCBM as an electron transport layer and BCP as a carrier collection layer, and for all these layers the energy levels were determined from the band gap obtained from the UV-Vis absorbance spectrum and HOMO levels were obtained by photoemission yield spectroscopy. The valence band of the optimized lead-free CsBi3I10 is −5.9 eV and the bandgap is 1.75 eV which is very low compared to those of the other types of bismuth-based perovskite materials. In this device structure, the bottom PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer combines a suitable conduction band (−3.0 eV) and the valance band (−5.1 eV). These features are expected to be suitable for the hole transfer from the CsBi3I10 to the ITO substrate through the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer. In this work, a low temperature processed inverted planar device is used instead of a mesoporous device structure, which was previously used for Bi based PSCs.31 The reason for using an inverted device structure is that the hole transport layers such as spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA and P3HT dissolve the CsBi3I10 layer due to the presence of solvents and additives like acetonitrile, 4-tertbutylpyridine and lithium salt (used as an additive in spiro-OMeTAD). Fig. 5(c) displays representative J–V characteristics (forward and reverse sweeps) for the fabricated CsBi3I10 PSC measured under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2 illumination) with an active area of 0.09 cm2. We have obtained a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.38%. The short circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor of the fabricated solar cells are 2.20 mA cm−2, 0.65 V and 27%, respectively, in forward bias. Under reverse bias scanning, we have obtained a PCE of 0.63% with a Voc of 0.7 V, Jsc of 2.66 mA cm−2 and fill factor of 34%.

The device performance comparison for other anti-solvents is also shown in Table ST1.† We have obtained the maximum PCE with the chlorobenzene treated film and the other anti-solvent treated devices show comparatively very low performance. Fig. 5(d) shows the IPCE spectrum of the CsBi3I10 PSC device. It can be clearly understood that CsBi3I10 can accumulate over a broad IPCE spectrum extending across the whole visible region (300–740 nm) corresponding to the UV-visible spectrum of CsBi3I10 perovskite with a bandgap of 1.75 eV. The IPCE onset for the CsBi3I10 PSC is as high as 740 nm with an IPCE of 10% at 700 nm, which is higher than those of the other bismuth based PSCs reported till now.21,22,29,31 The CsBi3I10 PSC shows a steady IPCE of 20% and above in the 370–680 nm region.
Conclusion
We have synthesized and investigated the low toxicity bismuth-based perovskite ABi3I10 (A = Cs, FA and MA) for their use in solar cell devices as absorbers. The improved morphology obtained with the CsBi3I10 perovskite composition by employing solvent engineering and anti-solvent treatment techniques has been shown in the SEM results. UV-visible measurements of the CsBi3I10 perovskite layers show an extended absorption spectrum in the visible region compared to the other bismuth halide based perovskites and the IPCE spectrum shows photocurrent response up to 740 nm with almost a 100 nm red-shift. The inverted planar structure is introduced for the CsBi3I10 perovskite solar cell with PEDOT:PSS as a hole transport layer for the first time, and it shows better energy level balancing with the perovskite layer. We have obtained a PCE of 0.63% with a Voc of 0.7 V and Jsc of 2.66 mA cm−2. Even though the device performance was very low, we could be able to achieve improved surface morphology of the perovskite layer. Moreover, this material provides a lot of avenues for further research towards the enhancement of PCE, such as employing different electron transport and hole transport layers to solve the energy level mismatch problem. Our observations of the conducted experiments highlight the influence of solvents and anti-solvents on the bismuth based perovskite film and optical properties. Here, we can conclude that CsBi3I10 is one of the promising low-toxicity candidates for photovoltaic applications with good optical properties.
