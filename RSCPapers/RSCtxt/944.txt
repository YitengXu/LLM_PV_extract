    , Accepted 8th April 2020First published on 13th April 2020AbstractThe commercialization of metal–air batteries requires efficient, low-cost, and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for reversible electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The modification of natural coal by heteroatoms such as N and S, or metal oxide species, has been demonstrated to form very promising electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER. However, it remains elusive and underexplored as to how the impurity elements in coal may impact the electrocatalytic properties of coal-derived catalysts. Herein, we explore the influence of the presence of various trace metals that are notable impurities in coal, including Al, Si, Ca, K, Fe, Mg, Co, Mn, Ni, and Cu, on the electrochemical performance of the prepared catalysts. The constructed Zn–air batteries are further shown to be able to power green LED lights for more than 80 h. The charge–discharge polarization curves exhibited excellent and durable rechargeability over 500 (ca. 84 h) continuous cycles. The promotional effect of the trace elements is believed to accrue from a combination of electronic structure modification of the active sites, enhancement of the active site density, and formation of a conductive 3-dimensional hierarchical network of carbon nanotubes.
1. Introduction
A looming energy crisis and environmental pollution are major problems facing humanity today, consequently, the development and use of non-polluting and sustainable renewable energies has received extensive attention. Achieving efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly energy conversion and storage systems is inevitably urgent for both current and future development.1–4 The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are a pair of reversible electrochemical reactions involved in electrochemical energy conversion devices such as fuel cells and metal air batteries, among others, that are key to future green energy systems. However, slow kinetics and frustratingly poor reversibility are key hindrances that limit the energy efficiency of metal–air batteries and regenerative fuel cell systems.5,6 The best catalysts for ORR invariably consist of Pt, however, the OER activity of Pt is unsatisfactorily poor,7,8 meanwhile, oxides of Ru and Ir are benchmark OER catalysts but exhibit dismal ORR activity.8,9 A commonly adopted strategy for designing effective bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts involves the integration of individually excellent ORR and OER catalysts into a composite material embodying both functions. To this end, alloys of Pt, Ir, and Ru have been widely evaluated as bifunctional oxygen electrodes and they represent the archetypical benchmark, especially when used under acidic conditions. However, wide-scale technological application of such materials is evidently prohibitive due to their high cost and scarcity.10–13 As such, the pursuit of non-precious and effective bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts is a research undertaking of topical importance.
Some of the most promising potential replacements that have been developed in recent years include heteroatom (e.g. N, S, P, B and Si) and single metallic atom (e.g. Fe, Mn and Co)-doped carbon materials, among others. It is believed that the heteroatoms doped in carbon will alter the local spin or charge density of the adjacent carbon atoms leading to enhancement of electron transfer and favorable adsorption/desorption of reactants, intermediates and products on the carbon surfaces.14–19 Among the carbon-based materials, coal has the advantages of low cost and abundant availability. Nagai et al. reported the use of coal as a raw material to prepare electrocatalysts for the ORR in acidic media.20–23 We have also reported the feasibility to convert coal into promising ORR, OER and bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media.11,24–26 It was previously demonstrated that coal can be directly modified into ORR, OER or bifunctional ORR/OER active catalysts without prior purification. However, natural coal has a very complex composition, consisting of C, H, O, N and S together with other inorganic elements (e.g. Si, Fe, Mn, Al, Ca and Mg).20,24 The electrocatalytic properties of carbon can be tremendously altered by the mere presence of traces of particular elements, either individually or through their interaction with other elements present in the coal. It would thus be prudent to understand how the various impurities in coal impact its electrocatalytic properties.
Here, we study for the first time the influence of traces of Fe, Al, Ca, K, Co, Si, Mg, Cu, Ni, and Mn, the notable impurity elements in coal, on its electrocatalytic ORR and OER performance. To achieve this, natural coal was first purified through treatment with hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid to remove inorganic impurities. The purified coal was then impregnated with 1 wt% of precursors of the elements of interest and subsequently treated in a stream of ammonia at 1050 °C. Electrochemical ORR and OER studies of the investigated elements show that traces of Fe, Al, Ca, K, and Co promote electrocatalysis of the ORR and OER. Promotion of the ORR and OER by Fe and Co is consistent with those results reported over M–N/C type catalysts for ORR, as well as metal oxides supported on, or embedded inside carbon structures.13,14 The promotional effect of Al, Ca and K is quite interesting. So far, there are five possible hypotheses that could account for this observation. Firstly, we observed the formation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) when purified coal impregnated with Fe, Al, Ca, K, and Co was treated in ammonia at 1050 °C. This observation is not surprising in the case of the Fe and Co containing samples, as they are commonly used catalysts for the growth of CNTs. In this case, the carbon precursors for growth of the CNTs are expected to be the volatile organic components in the coal. It was also reported that the CNTs were successfully grown on a pyrolytic graphite paper tape using CaSiO3 as the catalyst. The growth of the CNTs was ascribed to the critical melting temperature of CaSiO3 and silicate that seemed to play an important role similar to transition metals.27 But the growth of CNTs from purified coal samples impregnated with Al, and K after treatment in ammonia at 1050 °C was surprising as these elements are not known to catalyze the growth of CNTs. Although it is possible that the purified coal could still have contained residual transition metallic species that facilitated growth of the CNTs in the case of the Al, Ca, and K containing samples, it is evident to infer that growth of the CNTs must have contributed to enhancement of the ORR and OER activity. In addition, much as Al, Ca and K may not directly function as catalysts to grow the CNTs, they are well-known reduction agents,28–30 and could possibly facilitate reduction of the real trace catalyst prior to growth of CNTs. Secondly, in the case of growth of the CNTs, Al, Ca and K, may contribute to enhancement of the ORR and OER activity of the catalyst through electronic modification of the active sites, either when encapsulated inside the CNTs, or in tandem through direct interaction with the active sites. Thirdly, transition metals and Ca have been reported to favor the reactivity of coal pyrolysis and the decomposition of unstable volatiles.11,26,31 The existence of those trace metals would lead to surface defects such as multiple atom vacancies arising from structural reconstruction of the coal-based pyrolyzed carbon by the removal of heteroatoms (e.g. S and N). Meanwhile, a more porous structure with higher surface area is expected to be formed. Fourth, the melting points of the used precursors AlCl3 (192.6 °C), KNO3 (334 °C), and CaCl2 (772 °C) are all far below the employed thermal temperature of 1050 °C. Thus, the infusion of these species through the carbon network under these pyrolysis conditions is not only likely to induce the formation of a porous structures but also uniquely tailor the properties of the final catalyst. Finally, despite the rather low solubility, product of Ca(OH)2, Al, K and Ca are all expected to dissolve as aluminates Al(OH)4−, KOH and Ca(OH)2 through reaction with the electrolyte based on the fact that Al is known to dissolve from Al from RANEY® nickel during its activation by treatment in a concentrated alkaline solution, which should naturally lead to increase of the material porosity to some degree. The same is expected also for the K and Ca samples.
2. Results and discussion
The original brown coal (OC) was first crushed by ball milling followed by drying in an oven at 378 K for 4 h to obtain air-dried coal. After acid pretreatment with HCl and HF, the purified coal (PC) was obtained. It was then added to different trace element precursors (FeCl3·6H2O, AlCl3, CaCl2, KNO3, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, SiCl4, MgCl2, C4H6CuO4·H2O, NiN2O6·6H2O, or C4H6MnO4·4H2O) in an ethanol solution. The trace element (Fe, Al, Ca, K, Co, Si, Mg, Cu, Ni, or Mn) to PC weight ratio was 1 wt%, respectively. After thorough mixing of the suspension, it was dried at room temperature overnight. The samples were thermally treated in a stream of NH3 and Ar (1:9 volume ratio) at 1050 °C for 2 h in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor. The prepared catalysts are denoted as NPCC (N-doped purified coal-derived carbon), without the addition of trace elements, as the reference sample, Fe-NPCC, Al-NPCC, Ca-NPCC, K-NPCC, Co-NPCC, Si-NPCC, Mg-NPCC, Cu-NPCC, Ni-NPCC, and Mn-NPCC (see ESI† for the proximate analysis and EDS spectrum of OC, and more experimental details).
The composition of C, H, N, S, O, and other trace elements, in OC, PC, and NPCC were characterized by elemental analysis, as summarized in Table 1. The content of impurities was drastically decreased after the acid purification steps, and even decreased after thermal treatment. Decrease of the H and O contents after thermal treatment was due to the release of unstable volatile components.11 The N content clearly increased after thermal treatment of the samples under ammonia at 1050 °C, demonstrating successful introduction of nitrogen in the carbon. It seems that the acid pre-purification processes did not facilitate the removal of S, however, a significant decrease of the sulphur content was observed after the thermal treatment step, suggesting the removal of unstable sulphur components.

The morphology of the PC, NPCC, and NPCC incorporated with trace elements (Fe, Al, Ca, K, Co) was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 1). No growth of CNTs was discerned in PC and NPCC samples (Fig. 1a and b). Interestingly, although no extra carbon source was introduced during the thermal treatment, bamboo-like CNTs ranging from a few tens to hundreds of nanometers in diameter were clearly observed when the above trace metal elements were introduced into PC before thermal treatment. It is believed that the PC itself was the carbon source, and the introduced trace elements were the possible active domains for catalyzing or promoting the growth of CNTs from volatile organic compounds arising from decomposition of the coal. It is known that transition metals such as Fe, Co, Ni promote CNT growth.32–34 Interestingly, here we found that Al, Ca, and K can also facilitate the growth of CNTs. It is well known that Al, Ca, and K are reduction agents, which may have an effect on reducing real trace metal catalysts left in the PC residual during thermal treatment, thus promoting the growth of CNTs. Note that the formation of CNTs improved the electrical conductivity and facilitated creation of a 3-dimensional hierarchical structure in the PC-derived carbon which is beneficial for enhanced mass transport of the electrolyte, thus contributing to improvement of electrocatalytic performance. Some extra SEM images and the corresponding elemental mapping and EDS spectra of five NPCC samples incorporated with trace metals are presented as Fig. S2,† qualitatively revealing the presence of corresponding trace elements.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further employed to examine the microstructure of the prepared samples, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S3.† In all trace metal containing NPCC samples, dark spots were seen, which are typically embedded in a carbon network, indicating the existence of metal nanoparticles. CNTs were also identified, consistent with SEM observation. The high-resolution TEM images and fast Fourier transforms (FFT) confirm that the lattice fringes of 0.37, 0.58, 0.20, 0.19, 0.19, 0.16, 0.19, and 0.11 nm correspond to the Fe2O3 (210), Fe2O3 (110), Al2O3 (022), CaCO3 (332), K2O (311), Co3O4 (422), Co3O4 (331) and Co3O4 (551) planes, respectively. The TEM images of PC and NPCC display the co-existence of both the graphitic and amorphous carbon structures. However, no metals could be discerned in these two samples, demonstrating that most of the trace elements in the pristine coal were washed away during acid pretreatment (Fig. S3d and S3e†).

Raman spectroscopy provides insight into the graphitization degree of the prepared carbon materials (Fig. 3a). The two strong peaks at 1342 (D band) and 1586 cm−1 (G band) correspond to disordered sp3 structures and sp2-hybridized graphitic carbon, respectively.35 Generally, the higher the intensity ratio of the D-to the G-band (ID/IG), the higher the defect degree and content of disordered carbon in the carbon materials.36 The ID/IG value of PC (0.73) was considerably much smaller than that of the other samples (NPCC: 1.25; Fe-NPCC: 1.00; Al-NPCC: 1.14; Ca-NPCC: 1.10; K-NPCC: 1.10; Co-NPCC: 1.06). This indicates introduction of defects when PC was pyrolyzed in ammonia at 1050 °C. This observation is in accordance with previous results that ammonia being a reactive gas naturally induces a different kind of mechanism compared to classical pyrolysis under an inert atmosphere. These synthesis conditions generally favored the formation of graphitic nitrogen, where the nitrogen occupies lattice positions of carbon, thus leading to increase of disorder in the carbon structure.11,37 On the other hand, with the presence of trace metals influencing the properties of coal pyrolysis, surface and edge defects may be created along with reconstruction of the carbon structure during the release of unstable volatiles from the carbon matrix at elevated temperature, which also contributed to a higher degree of disorder in the resulting coal-derived carbon structures.26 Upon introduction of trace metals prior to the pyrolysis, the intensity ratio of D-to-G-bands slightly decreased. This is due to the decomposition of unstable volatiles generated from the PC carbon matrix catalyzed by the trace metals during the thermal treatment.25,38 However, no clear peak shifts or line broadening of the G- and D-bands was observed, indicating that the properties of the carbon structure remained apparently unchanged after the doping.39 The 2D-band (2680 cm−1) and (D + G)-band (2920 cm−1), which originate from the crystalline graphitic domains and structural disorder or defects, respectively, could be seen for the trace metal-containing NPCC samples. This suggests that stronger structural distortion of the aromatic graphitic carbon domains took place when trace metals were introduced into NPCC.25,26,40,41

The XRD patterns of the PC and NPCC-based samples are presented in Fig. 3b. Both PC and NPCC samples have broad reflections at ca. 2θ of 18 to 29°. In the case of PC, this was because of presence of carbon with a predominantly amorphous structure, while for the NPCC sample, the ordered arrangement of graphene stacks was distorted by the dopant nitrogen atoms after thermal treatment in NH3. For the trace metal-containing NPCC samples, dominant reflections with a clear peak at ca. 26° were observed. This is attributed to the formation of a higher proportion of graphite-like structures with the trace metals, facilitating catalytic decomposition of the unstable volatile carbon-rich organic components.38 The presence of a pronounced peak at ca. 44° is indicative of the presence of domains of ordered graphene sheets.20,32,42 Unfortunately, the presence of the trace metals could not be revealed by XRD at such low concentrations.
XPS was employed to investigate the surface chemical compositions and oxidation states of the samples. Fig. 4a shows the wide-survey XPS spectra of the PC, NPCC, and metal-containing NPCC samples, which confirm the existence of C, O and N atoms in all cases. However, the presence of the metals cannot be identified at this low-resolution probably owing to their low concentrations. The O 1s spectra were deconvoluted into three different contributions at 530.8, 531.8, and 532.9 eV (Fig. 4b). The peak centered at 530.8 eV is due to anionic oxygen associated with oxide species (O2−) of metals, such as Fe, Al, Ca, K, and Co. The peaks at 531.8 and 532.9 eV are related to CO and C–O functional groups on the carbon surface, respectively.9 Their relative distributions are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. S4a.† The total oxygen content was drastically decreased after high-temperature treatment. This is mainly attributed to its loss as part of the high-temperature decomposition products, and the exchange with nitrogen atoms during N-doping treatment.24 Among the three oxygen species, the relative contribution of O2− groups in the NPCC-based samples generally increased after the thermal treatment, indicating the formation of metal oxides. Three nitrogen species, namely, pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N were deconvoluted from the high-resolution N 1s spectra, as shown in Fig. 4c. As summarized in Table 2 and Fig. S4b,† the total nitrogen content increased after thermal treatment in NH3. Among the three species, the content of pyridinic-N significantly increased, and the content of graphitic-N also increased in general after the high-temperature treatment, which has been reported to promote the oxygen reduction.7,8 The N 1s XPS spectrum of NPCC was deconvoluted into three peaks at 398.5, 400.5, and 401.5 eV, corresponding to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N, respectively. However, an apparent peak shift in the characteristic binding energy of pyridinic-N was observed in the NPCC samples containing trace metals, which could arise from the formation of metal–N–C moieties.20,43,44Fig. 4d presents high-resolution Fe 2p, Al 2p, Ca 2p, K 2p and Co 2p XPS spectra of NPCC-based samples. The main signal of the Al 2p spectrum in Al-NPCC was at 73.8 eV, which is attributed to the presence of Al2O3.45 The Ca 2p spectrum of Ca-NPCC consisted of two bands associated with Ca 2p3/2 (347.4 eV) and Ca 2p1/2 (350.9 eV) demonstrating that chemical state of Ca was identified as Ca2+.46 However, no clear characteristic 2p signals of Fe, K, and Co could be observed in the respective Fe-NPCC, K-NPCC, and Co-NPCC samples. Because XPS is a surface-sensitive technique with a maximum detection depth of ca. 10 nm on the sample surfaces,47 the results imply that the surface concentration of the metals in these catalysts was too low to be detectable by XPS, or the metals were most likely encapsulated inside CNTs or graphitic carbon layers as observed by TEM in our previous studies.

The electrocatalytic performance of the PC-derived catalysts towards the ORR was examined in 0.1 M NaOH saturated with O2 (Fig. 5 and Fig. S5, S6†). The important parameters including the onset potential, half-wave potential, and Tafel slope of different samples are investigated and summarized in Tables 3 and S4.† Shown in Fig. 5a and b are linear sweep voltammograms for the ORR recorded at the RRDE disk, and corresponding potential-dependent current response for H2O2 oxidation at the Pt-ring poised at a constant potential of 0.4 V (Ag/AgCl 3 M KCl), which can be a marker for the catalyst selectivity during the ORR. Among the prepared samples, the Ca-NPCC displayed the most positive onset potential (1.014 V) at a current density of −0.1 mA cm−2, followed by Fe-NPCC (0.990 V), Al-NPCC (0.973 V), K-NPCC (0.970 V), and Co-NPCC (0.968 V). All these catalysts are better than the metal-free N-doped catalyst NPCC with an onset potential of 0.928 V (Fig. S7a†). Ca-NPCC, Fe-NPCC, Al-NPCC, K-NPCC, and Co-NPCC also exhibited excellent half-wave potentials (E1/2) of 0.921, 0.921, 0.881, 0.865, and 0.870 V, respectively, remarkably higher that for NPCC (0.811 V) (Fig. S7b†). Results for the electron transfer number per oxygen molecule (n) for ORR determined from the RRDE data are presented in Fig. 5c. Note that n is higher than 3 in the potential range of 0.2–0.8 V for all the samples. In particular, n is close to 4 for Ca-NPCC, Fe-NPCC, Al-NPCC, K-NPCC, and Co-NPCC, outperforming that of the catalysts incorporated with many other elements (e.g. Mg, Ni, Si, Mn, Cu) (Fig. S6†). The Tafel plots derived from Fig. 5a are shown in Fig. 5d. Ca-NPCC, Fe-NPCC, Al-NPCC, K-NPCC, and Co-NPCC all exhibited considerably smaller Tafel slopes of 53, 43, 57, 48, and 65 mV, respectively, in contrast to 85 mV dec−1 for NPCC. This indicates that introduction of these trace metals significantly enhanced the ORR kinetics. For the samples with a Tafel slope close to 60 mV dec−1, the rate-determining step is likely the chemical step following the fast one-electron transfer step. However, the Tafel slopes of the other NPCC samples are close to 120 mV dec−1, indicating that the ORR mechanism involved a slow charge transfer step preceding a fast-chemical step. A Tafel slope between 60 and 120 mV dec−1 implies that the ORR process is governed by both mechanisms.26 The addition of Mg, Mn, Ni, Cu and Si was found to be unable to improve the ORR performance of NPCC (Fig. S6†).

The long-term stability of ORR electrocatalysts is crucial for their practical application as cathode materials. Therefore, ORR durability tests for the three best catalysts (Ca-NPCC, Fe-NPCC and Al-NPCC) were performed galvanostatically at a constant current density of −1 mA cm−2. As displayed in Fig. 5e, all the three catalysts showed very promising stability with the potential remained almost unchanged after 280 hours. The potential retention was 98%, 98%, and 93% for Ca-NPCC, Fe-NPCC, and Al-NPCC, respectively. The three samples were further exposed to methanol to evaluate their response to possible fuel crossover effects (Fig. 5f). The presence of methanol is notoriously known to rapidly poison the ORR activity of Pt group metals due to strong adsorption of methanol oxidation products, or intermediates such as CO molecules that block ORR active sites. When methanol (3 M) was added to the electrolyte, the ORR currents for Ca-NPCC, Fe-NPCC, and Al-NPCC were unaffected, thus revealing their excellent tolerance to methanol crossover. Whereas the commercial reference catalyst Pt/C suffered from a sharp decrease in ORR current as a result of the oxidation of methanol on the catalyst surface and possible formation of CO that blocks the ORR active sites.48
We further explored the electrochemical performance of the prepared catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Linear sweep voltammograms were recorded between 1.0 and 2.0 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with electrode rotation at 1600 rpm in 0.1 M NaOH. As shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. S5, S8,† both Fe-NPCC and Al-NPCC exhibited higher current densities and smaller onset potentials than the other catalysts. The onset potential for Fe-NPCC and Al-NPCC, defined as the potential corresponding to a current density of 1 mA cm−2, were 1.40 and 1.34 V, respectively. The potentials at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, a metric relevant to solar fuel synthesis,8 were 1.77 and 1.72 V, respectively, for Fe-NPCC and Al-NPCC, better than that for Pt/C (1.90 V).49 The Tafel plots for the OER derived from Fig. 6a are shown in Fig. 6b. A Tafel slope of ca. 60 mV dec−1 usually suggests that a chemical step after the first electron transfer is rate limiting, while a Tafel slope close to 40 mV dec−1 means that the second electron transfer step of the OER determines the reaction rate.25 We note that the Fe-NPCC and Al-NPCC had the smallest Tafel slopes of 36 and 35 mV dec−1, respectively, demonstrating superior OER kinetics compared to the other electrocatalysts. We subsequently tested the OER stability of Fe-NPCC and Al-NPCC by continuously running CVs between 0.0 to 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl in O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH. The LSV curves recorded before and after 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammograms for the two samples are presented in Fig. 6c and d, respectively. Excellent preservation of the OER activity of the catalysts can be clearly observed. In the case of Al-NPCC, a slight but noticeable improvement of the OER performance was observed after the long-term CV experiment, probably due to morphological or surface property changes of the catalyst such as increase of porosity induced by the partial dissolution of trace metals, the increase of surface and edge defects created during alkaline corrosion on carbon material, or increased exposure of graphitized carbon structures by removal of unstable carbon, which may simultaneously improve mass transport, the density of active sites and conductivity of the sample. Fig. S9† presents the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the DFT pore size distribution curves of the Al-NPCC sample before and after 0.1 M KOH treatment. A combined feather of Type I and IV isotherms are observed for Al-NPCC, which demonstrates that the original Al-NPCC sample contains both micro- and mesopores indicating a hierarchical porous structure.50–52 Conversely, the isotherm of dealuminated Al-NPCC sample displays only Type I behavior demonstrating that the micropores are the more predominant form of the pores. The BET surface area of Al-NPCC was drastically decreased from 1189 m2 g−1 to 640 m2 g−1 after alkaline treatment. We ascribe this phenomenon to a possible expunction of unstable carbon containing a high ratio of micro- and mesopores along with the removal of the trace metal particles under strong oxidation environment. The DFT pore distribution results proof our assumption that the amount of both micropores and mesopores are less after alkaline treatment. Although BET result could not evidently demonstrate the creation of pores by dealumination in alkaline solution, it is known that Al will be dissolved in alkaline as a basic fact, especially when an oxidative potential is applied to the sample.

The bifunctionality of the catalysts for both ORR and OER were judged by the difference between the potential required for ORR at a current density of −1 mA cm−2 and the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Fe-NPCC and Al-NPCC achieved a voltage difference of only 0.780 and 0.743 V, respectively, indicating a remarkable performance for a reversible oxygen electrode. Although Ca-NPCC showed excellent ORR performance, the catalyst presented rather dismal OER activity.
The excellent bifunctional ORR/OER activity of the metal-doped NPCC catalysts stimulated us to further examine their practical application as reversible oxygen electrodes for rechargeable Zn–air batteries. We therefore constructed a rechargeable Zn–air battery, which consisted of a Zn-foil as an anode, metal-containing NPCC catalysts loaded on carbon paper as the air electrodes, and 6 M KOH with 0.2 M ZnCl2 as the electrolyte. The addition of ZnCl2 was to ensure occurrence of a reversible Zn/Zn2+ electrochemical redox reaction at the anode.5,53 A green light-emitting diode (LED, 2 V) powered by such two Zn–air batteries in series with the cathode constructed using metal-incorporated NPCC catalysts sustained bright light for more than 80 h (Fig. 7a and b and Fig. S10†), underlining the robustness of the developed catalysts. Moreover, the constructed batteries also showed outstanding rechargeability and cycle durability. Galvanostatic charging and discharging tests at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7c and d and Fig. S10†) revealed that the voltage difference between the charging and discharging processes remained constant over 84 hours (500 cycles with 600 s for each cycle). This confirms excellent bifunctional capability of the batteries, in accordance with the results from the half-reaction tests. The voltage difference of the Al-NPCC containing battery increased slightly during the cycling process, which is attributed to partial dissolution of unstable metals as aluminates (Al(OH)4−) into the electrolyte and detachment of loosely attached amorphous carbon. After this initial deactivation process, the voltage difference between the charging and discharging process was then maintained through the 500th cycle with ΔE being only as low as 0.62 V. The steady voltage difference between the charging and discharging voltages of Fe-NPCC, Ca-NPCC, K-NPCC, and Co-NPCC after 500 test cycles were 0.73, 0.76, 0.78, and 0.78 V, respectively. Although the incorporated trace metals might partially dissolute into the alkaline solution with time, the porous carbon structure with defects coincidently enhances the performance of oxygen reaction, thereby ensuring long-term stability.54–57 On the contrary, the NPCC-constructed Zn–air battery showed a fair performance with a much higher voltage difference between the charging and discharging processes (1.27 V after 120 cycles) and limited power output to light the LED (Fig. S11†). The superior rechargeability of the batteries fabricated in this study unequivocally demonstrates the potential application of coal derived carbon catalysts incorporated with trace metals in building functional Zn–air batteries.

3. Conclusion
To summarize, we made a systematic study of the role of various trace metals on the performance of N-doped coal-derived carbon (NPCC) materials as bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts for rechargeable metal–air batteries. We found that modification of purified coal-derived carbon doped with nitrogen (NPCC) with trace amounts (1 wt%) of Fe, Al, Ca, K, and Co can significantly enhance the ORR. Among the investigated catalysts, NPCC modified with traces of Fe, Al, and Ca delivered the best ORR activity, and the obtained catalysts maintained stable ORR performance at −1 mA cm−2 for 280 h, and also exhibited excellent resistance against methanol resistance, much better than Pt/C. Both Fe- and Al-containing NPCC catalysts, that is Al-NPCC and Fe-NPCC, also presented good OER performance with excellent stability. Moreover, the as-prepared NPCC samples with trace metals also exhibited very promising potential as durable air electrode catalysts for rechargeable metal–air batteries. Green LED bulbs powered by two custom-made Zn–air cells connected in series maintained bright light for more than 80 h. Charge–discharge tests revealed impressive rechargeability and cycle durability of the constructed Zn–air batteries. As demonstrated through the various characterizations, the materials have a mixed composition that includes: porous carbon, CNTs, surface and edge defects, heteroatoms such as N and the metallic species, that may include M–N/C groups (M = metal) as well as metallic oxides, that can all be involved in oxygen electrocatalysis, both ORR and OER. On the one hand, the 3-dimensional structure constructed with hierarchical pores and CNTs favors enhanced mass transfer of the electrolyte. On the other hand, the active sites such as N-dopant, the M–N/C groups, the metallic oxides, and the surface and edge defects will cooperatively improve the adsorption and desorption of oxygen and its intermediates during ORR and OER electrocatalysis. This work uncovers the possibility of converting source-abundant coal into highly promising electrocatalysts for energy applications especially in rechargeable metal–air batteries.
