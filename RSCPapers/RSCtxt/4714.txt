    , Accepted 2nd November 2012First published on 5th November 2012AbstractA photoactive PbS film synthesized by successive cycles of coating with ionic solutions and reaction can function as a performance-promoting counter electrode for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). The PbS film has a wide absorption spectrum that extends to the near infra-red region, making it capable of absorbing the long-wavelength light that penetrates the photoanode of a QDSSC. Under simulated one-sun illumination, this PbS film exhibits a p-type photovoltaic response in a polysulfide electrolyte, showing a quasi-Fermi level shift of +0.25 V. For QDSSCs consisting of a TiO2/CuInS2/CdS/ZnS photoanode and a polysulfide electrolyte, the PbS film outperforms Pt and CuS films as a counter electrode even though CuS has a much higher electrocatalytic activity in the polysulfide electrolyte than PbS. The photoactive characteristics of the PbS electrode increase the photocurrent of the resulting QDSSC. The p-type conductivity of the PbS forms a partial tandem junction between the PbS and the anode, increasing the photovoltage and the fill factor. Under one-sun illumination, a QDSSC assembled with the photoactive p-type PbS counter electrode achieves a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.7%, which is more than 15% greater than that of a cell assembled with the highly electrocatalytically active CuS.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention as alternatives to silicon-based solar cells because they are produced from low- to medium-purity materials through low-cost processes and effectively convert incident photons to electrical current.1–11 The design of DSSCs is based on an optically transparent film of TiO2 particles coated with a monolayer of a charge-generating dye to sensitize the film for light harvesting. The high efficiency of these cells is due to the effective separation and transportation of the opposite charges generated in the dye molecules. In addition to molecular dyes, inorganic quantum dots (QDs) are highly promising next-generation sensitizers because they have tunable band gaps and discrete energy levels for generating multiple excitons from single-photon absorption through impact ionization.12–14 Another advantage of QDs is their flexibility in a tandem arrangement, which expands the spectral response window of the solar cell.15 Using a photoactive counter electrode to achieve additional light absorption and therefore enhance the solar energy conversion is a promising tandem design for QDSSCs. It is important to note that very high solar conversion efficiency devices have previously been reported using the tandem cell approach with III–V-type semiconductors.16–21
II–VI-type semiconductor (such as CdSe, CdS, and PbS) QDs and ternary chalcopyrite CuME2 (M = Ga, In; E = S, Se, Te) QDs show promise for sensitizer applications because of their high absorption coefficients and band gaps that match the solar spectrum well.7–9,12,13,15,22–29 Thus, expanding the spectral absorption range and enhancing the separation of photogenerated charges could greatly improve their photo-conversion performances. To assemble QDs on TiO2 electrodes, previous studies used presynthesized colloidal QDs with subsequent attachment or the in situ preparation of QDs on TiO2 by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR).30–36 The most interesting photoanodes are CdS- or CdSe-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes prepared through SILAR. These photoanodes have a simple QD assembly on a TiO2 film and a high surface coverage.7,8,30,37–39 However, difficulty in controlling the sizes of the QDs prevents SILAR from being able to tune the optical absorption spectrum by varying the size.31–33
In addition to SILAR method, the use of rapid convective deposition (RCD) has also been employed for the deposition of micro/nano-particles resulting in 2-D close-packed monolayer particle arrays.40,41 The use of the RCD method has resulted in highly uniform deposition on large area devices including III-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs),40,42 organic LEDs,43 and solar cells.44 However, the applicability of RCD for coating QDs on porous TiO2 films requires further study. Our previous study reported a high-performance QDSSC based on a TiO2/CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS photoanode.45 This photoanode incorporated the advantages of colloidal presynthesis for CuInS2 QDs and SILAR deposition for CdS/ZnS.
To achieve efficient charge separation in QDSSCs, the regenerative polysulfide redox couple used (S2−/Sx2−) is more compatible with the sulfide sensitizer than the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple commonly used in DSSCs. As for the counter electrodes of QDSSCs, previous studies have reported various materials exhibiting acceptable electrocatalytic activities in the S2−/Sx2− redox reaction, including CoS,46,47 CuS,45,47 CuS/CoS,48 Cu2S,37,46,49 and carbon-based materials (nanotubes, graphite, carbon black, and mesoporous carbon).50–53 The efficient charge transfer between sulfide sensitizers and the polysulfide redox couple generates a large short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) in QDSSCs.45,46,54–58 However, the large charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode results in a low fill factor (FF) and the small difference between the TiO2 Fermi level and the S2−/Sx2− redox level confines the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc). A promising strategy to increase the Voc value without sacrificing the high Jsc, is to use a p-type and narrow band gap semiconductor as the counter electrode to provide an auxiliary tandem effect.
This study demonstrates the advantages of using p-type PbS as the counter electrode in QDSSCs. Fig. 1 shows the conceptual design of a QDSSC consisting of the reported TiO2/CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS photoanode,45 a polysulfide electrolyte, and a PbS counter electrode for harvesting the residual red or infra-red light penetrating the photoanode. Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the energy bands and the related charge transfer processes in the QDSSC. The PbS electrode serves as a counter electrode and a photocathode to facilitate electron injection to the electrolyte to achieve a higher Jsc. The Voc of the cell is the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi levels (qEf) of the anode and cathode,15i.e., Voc = Voc1 + Voc2. The quasi-Fermi level of an electrode, either the anode or the cathode, depends on the equilibration between the electrode and electrolyte solution. Illuminating the photoactive electrode shifts the quasi-Fermi level toward the vacuum Fermi level. Using a p-type PbS counter electrode with a photovoltaic response, the QDSSC exhibits a noticeable Voc2 under solar illumination.

 Fig. 2  Schematic energy band diagram and charge transfer processes in the QDSSC shown in Fig. 1. The PbS electrode serves not only as a counter electrode, but also as a photocathode to facilitate electron injection to the electrolyte. CB and VB are the conduction and valence bands of the electrodes, respectively. Voc1 stands for the absolute difference between the electrode quasi-Fermi (qEf) level and the electrolyte potential for the photoanode, and Voc2 for the photocathode. The total photovoltage (Voc) in the QDSSC is equal to the sum of Voc1 and Voc2. 
This study shows that a PbS electrode synthesized by successive ionic solution coating and reaction (SISCR) outperforms Pt and CuS electrodes. The TiO2/CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS photoanode countered by the PbS electrode provides a light-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) of 4.7% under one-sun illumination. This study presents a detailed characterization of the cell performance.
Experimental section
Materials
Lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2, 99.99+%), copper(I) chloride (CuCl, 99.995%), indium(III) chloride (InCl3, 99.999%), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 99+%), sodium sulfide (Na2S, 98+%), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (97+%), titanium chloride (TiCl4, 98+%), potassium chloride (KCl, 99.5%) and oleylamine (OA, 70%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Cadmium nitrate (99+%) and sulfur (99.999%) were obtained from Acros (USA). A TiO2 powder (P25, a mixed phase of 70% anatase and 30% rutile; average size 30 nm) from Degussa (Japan) was used to prepare TiO2 anatase nanoparticles for the photoelectrodes. Polyethylene glycol (PEG; molecular weight 20000) and ethyl cellulose from Fluka (Germany) were used to suspend TiO2 particles in viscous solutions. Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.5%) and copper(II) nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O, 99.7%) were supplied by J. T. Baker (USA). Hexane (99.9%) and methanol (99.9%) were purchased from Tedia (USA), and ethanol (99.5%) was obtained from Merck (Germany). All the materials were used without further purification.
Preparation of the PbS and CuS counter electrodes
SISCR deposition was used to deposit PbS films, forming the counter electrode. A mask, with a window bordered by commercially available 3M scotch tape (810 dX 3/4′′), was used to define the active area of the PbS electrode (1.3 × 1.3 cm2). A 0.5 M Pb(NO3)2 water–methanol solution (1:1 volume ratio, ca. 1 mL) was first dropped on a clean conducting glass substrate (SnO2:F coated glass, FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide); Hartford Glass TEC7, USA). A doctor-blade method, similar to the method used to spread TiO2 suspensions in DSSCs, was then used to remove the excess Pb(NO3)2 solution, yielding a thin layer of Pb(NO3)2 on the FTO. 1 mL of a 1 M Na2S water–methanol solution (1:1 volume ratio) was uniformly dropped onto the Pb(NO3)2 decorated FTO. Lead and sulfur ions reacted rapidly after dropping, and the color immediately changed from colorless (Pb(II)) to black, implying the formation of PbS. The remaining nitrate, sodium ions, and non-reacted Na2S and Pb(NO3)2 were removed by rinsing with deionized water. The substrate was then dried with an air-gun under atmospheric conditions. The two-step dropping, rinsing, and drying procedure represents one SISCR deposition cycle of PbS. The amount of PbS incorporated can be increased by repeating the deposition cycle.
For the purpose of comparison, this study prepared CuS films using SISCR deposition with Cu(NO3)2 and Na2S as the precursors. Our previous study showed that four cycles of SISCR deposition was optimal for preparing a CuS counter electrode.45 In this study we used the 4-cycle CuS electrode to compare with the PbS electrodes.
Preparation of the colloidal CuInS2 QDs
We synthesized CuInS2 QDs using a solvothermal method described previously.59,60 In brief, a mixture of 0.99 mg of CuCl (0.01 mmol), 2.2 mg of InCl3 (0.01 mmol), and 0.198 mL of OA was heated to 150 °C and maintained there for 1 h with stirring. The resulting mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (200 mL in capacity) containing 30 mL of hexane, followed by injection mixing with a sulfur solution (1 mmol dissolved in 1 mL OA). Nucleation and the subsequent growth of CuInS2 QDs occurred in the sealed autoclave at a temperature of 110 °C for 50 min. The products were then washed and centrifuged with an ethanol–methanol (1/2, v/v) solution. The resulting OA-capped QDs were dispersed in hexane for storage.
To achieve the subsequent self-assembly of CuInS2 QDs on the TiO2 electrodes, the OA ligands on the QDs were exchanged with MPA, which is a bifunctional linker molecule containing carboxylic acid and thiol groups. This process involved dispersing the dried OA-capped CuInS2 QDs in a methanol solution of MPA (60 mM) and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (70 mM),53 and sonicating the mixture for 30 min to obtain a clear dispersion of MPA-capped CuInS2 QDs. The MPA-capped QDs were precipitated by the addition of an ethyl acetate–hexane (12/50, v/v) solution, and redispersed in methanol.
Fabrication of the CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS QDSSC
The TiO2 film on the photoanode in this study consisted of a compact underlayer, a transparent mesoporous layer (phase-pure anatase with a particle size of 20 nm), and a scattering layer (rutile with a particle size of 400 nm) on the top. The compact layer was deposited by immersing the FTO substrate in an aqueous TiCl4 solution (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by rinsing with deionized water and ethanol.61 Previous research has described the synthesis of the TiO2 suspensions used in the transparent and scattering layers.59,62–66 The thickness of the mesoporous films was approximately 15 μm (11 μm for the transparent layer and 4 μm for the scattering layer), as measured by a Tencor Alpha-step 500 (USA) surface profiler.
The mesoporous TiO2 electrodes were subsequently sensitized with CuInS2 QDs and CdS by self-assembly and SILAR, respectively. For CuInS2 QD self-assembly, the TiO2 electrodes were heated to approximately 110 °C and immersed in an acetonitrile solution of MPA (1 M) and sulfuric acid (0.1 M) for 12 h.67 The modification of the TiO2 surface with MPA facilitated the adsorption of CuInS2 QDs. The electrodes were then thoroughly rinsed with methanol before being transferred to the CuInS2 QD solution. The MPA-modified TiO2 films were left in the MPA-capped QD/methanol solution for 24 h to ensure the saturated entrapment of the QDs on the TiO2 electrodes. For the in situ growth of CdS layers, the TiO2/CuInS2-QD electrode was successively dipped in 0.05 M Cd(NO3)2/methanol, rinsed with methanol, dipped in 0.05 M Na2S/methanol, and rinsed with methanol again. The dipping time was 30 s for each of the Cd2+ and S2− solutions, and the SILAR cycle was repeated 11 times. All the electrodes analyzed in this study were coated with ZnS by one SILAR cycle, which consisted of dipping alternately in the 0.2 M Zn(NO3)2 and 0.2 M Na2S solutions once, with 1 min per dip. The QDSSCs were assembled with QD-sensitized photoanodes and PbS, CuS, or Pt counter electrodes using a Surlyn (DuPont 1706, USA) spacer to maintain a distance of 30 μm between the two facing electrodes. The polysulfide electrolyte was a water–methanol solution (3:7 by volume) containing 2 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl. The active area of the cell was 0.16 cm2.
Measurements
Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were obtained using a Jeol JSM-6700F (Japan) at a beam potential of 10 kV. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-4100 (Japan) spectrophotometer. The crystal structures of the counter electrode samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku RINT-2000 (Japan) diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, excited at 40 kV and 40 mA. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were obtained with an impedance analyzer (Zahner IM6, Germany) at zero bias potential, and an AC potential amplitude of 10 mV over a frequency range of 0.02–105 Hz. The EIS measurements were based on a symmetric configuration consisting of two identical electrodes and the polysulfide electrolyte.60,68,69 The potentiostatic current–voltage polarization curves of the Pt, CuS, and PbS electrodes were recorded using a Zahner IM6 analyzer in a three-electrode configuration with a Pt-gauze counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference.
The photocurrent–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) of the QDSSCs were recorded under illumination with a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel class A, SP91160A, USA) at 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) using an electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments 614B, USA). The intensity of the simulated light was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell. All measurements were conducted under ambient conditions with no antireflective layer.
Results and discussion
Physical characteristics of the counter electrodes

Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of the PbS electrode deposited on a glass substrate using the SISCR process. According to the PbS standard pattern provided at the bottom of Fig. 3 (JCPDS file no. 01-0880), the product obtained from the SISCR deposition was PbS with low crystallinity. Fig. 4 shows the top-view SEM images of the PbS electrodes obtained from deposition on an FTO substrate with varying numbers of SISCR cycles. The PbS coverage was low for one-cycle deposition and the majority of the FTO surface remained uncovered (Fig. 4a). Three cycles of SISCR completely covered the FTO substrate with a PbS layer (Fig. 4b). After five deposition cycles, the PbS precipitates aggregated to form a smooth and compact layer covering the FTO substrate (Fig. 4c), producing long-range uniformity of the PbS film. The one-, three-, and five-cycle PbS films were 0.34, 0.53, and 0.77 μm thick, respectively.

 Fig. 4  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the PbS films deposited with varying numbers of SISCR cycles: (a) 1 cycle, (b) 3 cycles, and (c) 5 cycles. The deposited PbS completely covered the FTO substrate after 3 and 5 SISCR cycles (panels b and c). 

Fig. 5 compares the absorption spectra of the TiO2/CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS photoelectrode and the 5-cycle PbS electrode. The photoelectrode shows an absorption onset of approximately 800 nm, and the absorption spectrum of the PbS electrode extends to wavelengths exceeding 1000 nm. The ability to absorb long-wavelength irradiation makes PbS an ideal counter electrode for harvesting the residual light that penetrates a photoanode such as TiO2/CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS. In addition to the light-harvesting ability for expanding the spectral response window, Fig. 2 shows that a photoactive cathode with p-type conductivity increases the photovoltage through the auxiliary tandem junction. The next section will analyze the conductivity type of the PbS electrode.

Electrochemical characteristics of the counter electrodes
The sulfide ions (S2−) in QDSSCs scavenge the photogenerated holes in the anode, and the oxidized ions (Sx2−) travel across the electrolyte zone to accept electrons at the surface of the counter electrode, forming Sx−12− and S2−. The counter electrode ensures the regeneration cycle continues. We used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to investigate the charge transfer resistance (Rct),45,68–70 which is closely related to the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrodes in reducing the polysulfide electrolyte. Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist impedance spectra obtained at zero bias in a symmetric two-electrode cell sandwiching the polysulfide electrolyte. The cell assembly used the Pt and CuS electrodes and the PbS electrodes with varying numbers of SISCR cycles. Fig. 6 also shows the equivalent circuit used for fitting the impedance data, where Rs is the equivalent series resistance, ZN is the Nernst diffusion impedance of the electrolyte, Rct is the charge transfer resistance, and Cdl is the electric double layer capacitance. Fitting the impedance data with the equivalent circuit model produced Rct values of 370 and 4.5 Ω cm2 for the Pt and CuS electrodes, respectively.45 The Pt electrode had a strong resistance to interaction with the polysulfide electrolyte, whereas the CuS electrode exhibited a much lower Rct for interaction with the polysulfide electrolyte. The EIS measurements of the PbS electrodes produced Rct values of 61, 47, 30, and 30 Ω cm2 for the electrodes produced from 3, 4, 5, and 6 deposition cycles, respectively. The resistance of the PbS electrode decreased as the number of deposition cycles increased, and stabilized at approximately 30 Ω cm2 after 5 deposition cycles. The PbS electrodes had smaller Rct than the Pt, but larger Rct than the CuS.

The numbers in the parentheses stand for the number of cycles in the SISCR deposition. The inset at the top right shows the magnified low Z′ (high frequency) regions of the original impedance plots, and the other inset shows the equivalent circuit applied for the impedance data fitting, where Rs is the ohmic series resistance, Cdl is the electric double layer capacitance, Rct is the charge transfer resistance, and ZN is the Nernst diffusion impedance. 

Fig. 7 shows the potentiostatic current–voltage polarization curves of the Pt, CuS, and 5-cycle SISCR PbS electrodes in the polysulfide electrolyte, obtained with a three-electrode configuration with a Pt-gauze counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference.45,46 The polarization-induced current indicates the electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes. Without light irradiation, the polarization measurements for the electrocatalytic activity in the polysulfide electrolyte are in the order CuS > PbS > Pt, agreeing with the Rct results obtained from EIS. The electrocatalytic activity has a significant effect on the performance of QDSSCs. Fig. 7 also shows the polarization curves of the CuS and PbS electrodes irradiated with simulated solar light at one-sun intensity. The Pt electrode was not affected by irradiation and its data are not shown. The CuS electrode exhibited little difference under irradiation, indicating that the CuS electrode lacked photovoltaic properties. In contrast, irradiation significantly affected the polarization of the PbS electrode, which exhibited a negative voltage shift at the zero-current position. The variation induced by the irradiation indicated the p-type conductivity of the PbS electrode because achieving an electrode–electrolyte equilibrium (i.e., the zero-current situation) requires a negative voltage bias.
 Fig. 7  Potentiostatic current–voltage polarization curves of the Pt, CuS, and 5-cycle PbS electrodes in the polysulfide electrolytes obtained in the dark, and under simulated solar light irradiation of one sun (100 mW cm−2). 
We elaborate on the photoresponse of the polarized PbS electrode in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a schematically shows the band positions of the PbS electrode in equilibrium with the polysulfide electrolyte in the dark. The quasi-Fermi level of the PbS and the redox potential of the electrolyte (Eredox) equilibrate, and the conduction band and valence band edges (Ec and Ev, respectively) bend in response, accordingly. This equilibrium leads to zero current, and current flow occurs under polarization (see measurements under dark conditions in Fig. 7). Fig. 8b shows the band positions of the PbS electrode under light irradiation, indicating that qEF shifts in the positive direction because of the p-type conductivity, and the conduction and valence bands become flattened. To prevent electron flow from the electrolyte to the electrode, Fig. 8c shows that a negative voltage bias for the electrode (i.e., an upward shift of qEf) is necessary to reach the zero-current situation (see measurements under light conditions in Fig. 7). The scheme in Fig. 8 and the data in Fig. 7 show that the vacuum Fermi level of the PbS electrode was at least 0.25 V more positive than the redox potential of the electrolyte. The more positive potential of the PbS electrode implies that a PbS counter electrode has the ability to increase Voc in QDSSCs because Voc is the difference between the quasi-Fermi levels of the anode and cathode (Fig. 2).

In (a), the quasi-Fermi level of the PbS (qEf) and the redox potential of the electrolyte (Eredox) equilibrate, and the conduction band and valence band edges (Ec and Ev, respectively) bend in response to the equilibration. 
Performance of QDSSCs based on PbS counter electrodes

Fig. 9 shows the photocurrent–voltage characteristics (J–V curve) of the QDSSCs assembled with the TiO2/CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS photoanode and different counter electrodes under simulated one-sun illumination. Using Pt as counter electrode, the cell exhibited Jsc, Voc, and FF values of 14 mA cm−2, 0.43 V, and 37%, respectively, resulting in a low power energy conversion efficiency (η) of 2.3%. This low η was due to the poor electrocatalytic activity of the Pt in the polysulfide electrolyte, which leads to a low FF value. Compared with the Pt electrode, CuS significantly improved Voc and FF, which were 0.55 V and 42%, respectively, resulting in η of 4.0%. This is primarily because of the relatively low Rct. The QDSSC assembled with the 5-cycle PbS electrode exhibited better performance (η = 4.7%) than the cell with CuS due to increased Jsc, Voc, and FF values even though PbS had a larger Rct than CuS. The ESI† shows the J–V curves of QDSSCs using Pb electrodes produced using varying numbers of SISCR cycles. The parameters (Jsc, Voc, and FF) increased with the number of SISCR cycles used to produce the PbS counter electrode, and reached an optimum performance at 5 cycles. Table 1 presents a summary of the key performance parameters of the cells obtained from the J–V curve measurements.

The better performance of the PbS electrode relative to that of the CuS is attributed to the p-type photovoltaic response of the PbS electrode. The wide absorption spectrum of PbS resulted in the absorption of residual long-wavelength solar irradiation by the PbS counter electrode. This irradiation may have excited the PbS and facilitated the injection of electrons from the conduction band into the electrolyte, leading to higher Jsc and FF values in the PbS-QDSSC compared to those in the CuS-QDSSC (Table 1). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency data of the QDSSCs (ESI†) support the assertion that the enhanced light absorption by PbS promotes the photocurrent. The p-type character of PbS results in a positive shift of qEf (Fig. 8b), and therefore increases Voc according to the schematic interpretation in Fig. 2. However, with irradiation from the photoanode side, the number of photogenerated charges in the PbS does not meet that of the photoanode. The electron transfer to the electrolyte through the PbS electrode follows two pathways: one is associated with the ordinary electrocatalytic reaction, and the other is the injection from the PbS conduction band. Electron transfer through the tandem configuration, that is, the latter pathway, only partially contributes to the electron transport in the PbS-QDSSC. Therefore, the Voc increase, relative to the Voc of the CuS cell, is not as large as the voltage shift with irradiation observed in Fig. 7. The simultaneous increase of the Jsc, Voc, and FF values increased the maximum conversion efficiency from 4.0% for the CuS cell to 4.7% for the PbS, achieving an increase of more than 15%. The specific optical and electronic characteristics that lead to the auxiliary tandem arrangement with the photoanode make PbS a promising counter electrode material for polysulfide-based QDSSCs.
Conclusions
This study reports the synthesis of a p-type PbS electrode via SISCR for high performance QDSSCs. This p-type PbS has a wide absorption spectrum and exhibits a photovoltaic response under illumination. When combined with a TiO2/CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS photoanode and polysulfide electrolyte to form a QDSSC, the PbS counter enhanced the Voc value of the cell because of its p-type and photovoltaic characteristics, forming a partial tandem junction with the photoanode. Although the CuS electrode had a larger electrocatalytic activity than the PbS electrode, the photoactive properties of the PbS electrode enhanced electron injection into the electrolyte and subsequently increased the Jsc and FF values of the cell. The optical and electronic features of PbS mean that a PbS counter electrode can increase the overall performance of polysulfide electrolyte-based QDSSCs to the next level.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of a QDSSC consisting of a TiO2/CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS photoanode, a polysulfide electrolyte, and a PbS counter electrode.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematic energy band diagram and charge transfer processes in the QDSSC shown in Fig. 1. The PbS electrode serves not only as a counter electrode, but also as a photocathode to facilitate electron injection to the electrolyte. CB and VB are the conduction and valence bands of the electrodes, respectively. Voc1 stands for the absolute difference between the electrode quasi-Fermi (qEf) level and the electrolyte potential for the photoanode, and Voc2 for the photocathode. The total photovoltage (Voc) in the QDSSC is equal to the sum of Voc1 and Voc2.	 

 	Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction pattern of a SISCR PbS film deposited on a glass substrate. The standard pattern of PbS (JCPDS file no. 01-0880) is provided at the bottom.	 

 	Fig. 4  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the PbS films deposited with varying numbers of SISCR cycles: (a) 1 cycle, (b) 3 cycles, and (c) 5 cycles. The deposited PbS completely covered the FTO substrate after 3 and 5 SISCR cycles (panels b and c).	 

 	Fig. 5  Optical absorption spectra of the TiO2/CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS photoelectrode and the 5-cycle SISCR PbS electrode.	 

 	Fig. 6  Nyquist impedance plots of Pt and CuS electrodes and PbS electrodes produced with varying numbers of SISCR deposition cycles (indicated in parentheses). The numbers in the parentheses stand for the number of cycles in the SISCR deposition. The inset at the top right shows the magnified low Z′ (high frequency) regions of the original impedance plots, and the other inset shows the equivalent circuit applied for the impedance data fitting, where Rs is the ohmic series resistance, Cdl is the electric double layer capacitance, Rct is the charge transfer resistance, and ZN is the Nernst diffusion impedance.	 

 	Fig. 7  Potentiostatic current–voltage polarization curves of the Pt, CuS, and 5-cycle PbS electrodes in the polysulfide electrolytes obtained in the dark, and under simulated solar light irradiation of one sun (100 mW cm−2).	 

 	Fig. 8  Schematic energy-level diagrams of a p-type PbS semiconductor under sequentially varied conditions: (a) in equilibrium with the polysulfide electrolyte in the dark, (b) irradiated with light, and (c) with a negative voltage applied to meet the chemical potential of the electrolyte. In (a), the quasi-Fermi level of the PbS (qEf) and the redox potential of the electrolyte (Eredox) equilibrate, and the conduction band and valence band edges (Ec and Ev, respectively) bend in response to the equilibration.	 

 	Fig. 9  Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of QDSSCs assembled with the TiO2/CuInS2-QDs/CdS/ZnS photoanode and the Pt, CuS, or 5-cycle PbS counter electrode under simulated solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2.
