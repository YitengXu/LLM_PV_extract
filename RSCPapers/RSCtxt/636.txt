    , Accepted 2nd February 2020First published on 3rd February 2020AbstractStarting from fluorinated metal–organic β-diketonates, we report the synthesis of undoped and lanthanide-doped alkaline-earth fluoride (Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+ tri-doped CaF2) thin films through two different chemical approaches: a metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method and a combined sol–gel/spin-coating procedure. Both chemical approaches have the advantage of being very reliable and reproducible for the fast production of thin films with a high degree of uniformity over large areas. The fluorinated metal precursors act as a single-source in both processes, and an accurate control of the process parameters allows the optimization of the doped CaF2 films. X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis have been used to characterize the deposited films. Upconversion emission, typical of the lanthanide ions, in the visible and near infrared regions upon laser excitation at 980 nm is clearly observable. The emissions are in the central region of the CIE1931 color coordinate space.
Introduction
Nowadays, fluoride-based materials are among the most promising inorganic functional systems for a wide variety of applications in dielectrics, optics, optoelectronics, and photonics.1 In particular, lanthanide-doped binary or multicomponent fluorides are nowadays extensively investigated for their excellent chemical and optical properties, which find applications in microelectronics and photonics, as well as nanomedicine, both in massive and also in nanostructured forms.2
In recent years, the exponential growth of research activities in the production of new and more efficient photovoltaic (PV) devices has boosted the research activity towards the fabrication of fluoride materials in thin film form as energy converting layers.3 In fact, one interesting strategy to enhance the efficiency of PV devices is to collect the solar radiation outside of the absorption range of the photoactive material (e.g. silicon) and to shift its energy to a more suitable optical region, i.e. the visible range, in which it can be efficiently harvested by the PV device. To this aim, trivalent lanthanide ion (Ln3+)-doped fluorides have been considered to be among the most effective materials for energy conversion processes.4 In particular, properly lanthanide ion-doped (e.g. ytterbium/erbium, Yb3+/Er3+, or ytterbium/thulium, Yb3+/Tm3+) binary (e.g. CaF2 or SrF2) and ternary (NaYF4,5 NaGdF42f,6 or LiYF47) fluorides have been demonstrated as very efficient hosts for energy down-conversion or upconversion (UC) processes. UC is a process in which two or more photons, typically in the near infrared region (NIR), are converted into photons with higher energy, usually in the visible or ultraviolet (UV) regions. The so-called energy transfer upconversion (ETU) process, typical of lanthanide-doped inorganic materials, is efficiently able to generate strong UC emissions in the visible and UV regions upon NIR excitation, usually close to 1 μm. The UC mechanism involves sensitizers, such as Yb3+ ions, that efficiently absorb photons in the NIR region around 980 nm and transfer energy to activator ions, such as Er3+, Tm3+ or Ho3+, in several steps, thanks to the peculiar ladder-like energy level scheme of the Ln3+ ions, in order to obtain photons with higher energy.8 Ln3+ codoped fluoride materials are also of paramount interest as inorganic phosphors for producing white light emission through mixing of red, green and blue emissions due to Er3+ and Tm3+ ions in appropriate proportions. These systems have the advantages of being cheap, showing efficient luminescence and, if available through an easy synthetic route, also being appealing for industrial production.2c,9 Interestingly, Ln3+-doped fluoride compounds in thin film form show promising luminescence properties in microelectronic applications such as micro- and nanoscale thermometry, due to the tight correlation between temperature and luminescence behavior of the emitting doping ions.10
Among the binary fluorides, calcium fluoride has been regarded as one of the most efficient hosts for Ln3+ luminescent ions for energy conversion systems, due to its low phonon energy, which minimizes non-radiative de-excitation processes.11 Some investigations have been reported in the literature on doped CaF2 nanoparticles for applications in nanomedicine,2b,e while differently Ln3+-doped CaF2 thin films have been much less investigated. Specifically, CaF2 thin layers have been grown through physical vapor deposition techniques,12 such as electron beam evaporation13 and molecular beam epitaxy.14 Nonetheless, few reports are known on chemical deposition techniques performed via either solution or vapor phase routes.15,16 Ternary fluorides such as NaYF4 and NaGdF4, deeply studied as nanoparticles,17 have also been recently investigated in thin film forms.18,19
In the present paper, an in-depth study is reported describing the MOCVD and sol–gel approaches for the fabrication of binary fluoride CaF2 thin films, also doped with lanthanide ions. The two methods are compared by using the same β-diketonate precursor for the formation of the CaF2 phase, namely the fluorinated “second-generation” Ca(hfa)2·diglyme·H2O (Hhfa = hexafluoroacetylacetone; diglyme = bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether). After the sol–gel procedure, the spin-coating deposition has been applied for the formation of compact thin films. Lanthanide tri-doped systems, namely CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+,Tm3+, have been obtained by the MOCVD and sol–gel/spin-coating methods, through simple and easily scalable processes by adding the analogous Ln(hfa)3·diglyme (Ln = Yb, Er, and Tm) adducts as doping agents in the precursor sources.
X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses allowed an accurate determination of the physico-chemical properties of deposited layers, while their functional properties were assessed through luminescence spectroscopy.
Experimental
Precursor syntheses
Calcium oxide (purity 99.95%), Ln-acetates with Ln = Yb, Er, and Tm (purity 99.9%) and Hhfa (purity 98%) purchased from STREM Chemicals, and diglyme (purity 99.5%) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich were used without further purification. All the Ca(hfa)2·diglyme·H2O and Ln(hfa)3·diglyme precursors (structures reported in Scheme S1, ESI†) were synthesized by reaction of metal oxides or acetates with Hhfa and diglyme in dichloromethane under reflux for 1 h. Detailed synthetic procedures are reported in ref. 20 and 21.
Film syntheses
MOCVD depositions take place in a customized, horizontal, hot-wall reactor (Fig. S1, ESI†), under low-pressure using argon (150 sccm) as carrier gas and oxygen (150 sccm) as the reactant gas, which was introduced in the main flow in proximity to the reaction zone. The films were deposited on Si(001), glass and quartz in the 400–550 °C temperature range. Quartz substrates were used for the samples deposited at the highest nominal deposition temperature of 600 °C. Two substrates (placed at A and B positions, Fig. S1, ESI†) were coated simultaneously. The molten precursor source of doped CaF2 was heated at 120 °C, which is a useful temperature for efficient vaporization. K-type thermocouples were used to measure the temperature of the vaporization zone and to experimentally determine the temperatures in the A and B positions by inserting them into the reactor under deposition conditions of temperature, carrier and reaction gasses.
The sol–gel reaction occurred in water/ethanol solution (total volume 3.42 ml) with trifluoroacetic acid as catalyst for the hydrolysis reactions, starting from 1 mmol of Ca precursor (eqn (1)) and, for the doped films, from 0.79 mmol of Ca precursor and the related doping ion amounts (0.18 mmol of Yb, 0.02 mmol of Er and 0.01 mmol of Tm precursors) as defined in eqn (2).18,19
The sol was aged at 60 °C for 20 h and spin-coated on Si(001) and glass substrates. The spin-coating process was carried out using a multistep procedure in which four times of spin-coating deposition are alternated with fast annealing steps at 350 °C or 400 °C in air for 10 min. Finally, the films were annealed at 350 °C or 400 °C in air for 1 h. For the annealing procedure, the furnace was maintained at the required temperature, so the treatment was carried out without any heating and cooling rate. A Spin-Coater SPIN-150 SPS Europe system has been used with a ramping rate of 1000 revolutions per minute (rpm), a spinning rate of 3000 rpm and a time of 60 s.
Film characterization
Film structure was analyzed by XRD using a Smartlab Rigaku diffractometer in grazing incidence mode (0.5°), equipped with a rotating anode of Cu Kα radiation operating at 45 kV and 200 mA. Film surface morphology was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using a ZEISS SUPRA 55 VP. The films deposited on glass were Au-coated prior to FE-SEM characterization. The atomic composition of the samples was analysed through energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, using an INCA-Oxford windowless detector, having a resolution of 127 eV as the FWHM of Mn Kα.
Upconversion emission measurements
A 980 nm diode laser (CNI Optoelectronics Tech) was used as an excitation source to generate UC emission. For measuring the decay curves, the Arduino hardware platform and proper software were used to modulate the 980 nm laser, generating a 10 Hz wave with a decay time of 1 μs. The emission spectra were recorded using a half meter monochromator (Andor, Shamrock 500i) equipped with a 300 lines per mm grating and an iDus CCD camera. The emission signal was collected with a 40× microscopy objective (Nikon, Plan Fluor) using a dichroic mirror (Semrock, 925 nm edge BrightLine beamsplitter). The decay curves were acquired with a GaAs photomultiplier (Hamamatsu) and a 500 MHz oscilloscope (LeCroy, Waverunner). The laser power density was calculated from the exciting laser beam power (measured with an Ophir AN/2E photometer) and the measured beam spot size (0.5 mm diameter).
Results and discussion
Vapor phase and solution routes have been implemented for the deposition of calcium fluoride thin films applying the same precursors as those of the type M(hfa)n·diglyme. These complexes act as single-source precursors for all the required elements Ca, Ln (Ln = Yb, Er, and Tm) and fluorine in both processes. Undoped CaF2 films and tri-doped CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+,Tm3+ ones have been deposited through the MOCVD and sol–gel/spin-coating approaches. To assess reproducibility of the used approach, each experiment, either through sol–gel or MOCVD, has been repeated two or three times.
Fabrication of binary fluoride CaF2 and Ln3+ tri-doped CaF2 films through a sol–gel/spin-coating approach
The Ca(hfa)2·diglyme·H2O adduct has been applied in a sol–gel approach under acidic conditions with the following reagent molar ratio: 1Ca(hfa)2·diglyme·H2O:58C2H5OH:2H2O:0.53CF3COOH(1)The sol is heat-treated at 60 °C for 20 h to produce an incipient gel, which is spun to yield CaF2 films through iterative spinning and thermal treatment both on Si and glass substrates. The final annealing temperature was 350 °C or 400 °C.
The same procedure has been applied to the preparation of tri-doped CaF2:Yb(18%),Er(2%),Tm(1%) thin films using Yb(hfa)3·diglyme, Er(hfa)3·diglyme and Tm(hfa)3·diglyme as Yb, Er and Tm sources respectively, by means of the following reagent molar ratio: 0.79Ca(hfa)2·diglyme·H2O:0.18Yb(hfa)3·diglyme:0.02Er(hfa)3·diglyme:0.01Tm(hfa)3·diglyme:58C2H5OH:2H2O:0.53CF3COOH(2)The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, performed on the films obtained on both Si and glass, show diffraction patterns with features attributable to the pure CaF2 phase, confirming its formation for all the samples independent of the substrate nature (see Fig. S2, ESI†). In Fig. 1, the XRD patterns of undoped CaF2 film, annealed at 400 °C (orange pattern), and CaF2:Yb(18%),Er(2%),Tm(1%) samples annealed at 350 °C (red pattern) and 400 °C (blue pattern) show characteristic peaks at 2θ = 28.25°, 47.00°, and 55.75° corresponding to reflections of the (111), (220), and (311) lattice planes, respectively, typical of the CaF2 phase (ICDD diffraction card 35-0816).
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of sol–gel/spin-coated films on Si(100): undoped CaF2 film (400 °C, orange line), CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+,Tm3+ (350 °C, red line), and CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+,Tm3+ film (400 °C, blue line). Graphite reflections are indicated as green lines. 
The observed peak intensities match exactly those reported in the ICDD card, thus indicating the formation of polycrystalline films without any preferential orientation. It is interesting to observe that the tri-doped sample treated at 350 °C (red pattern, Fig. 1) shows a lower crystallinity degree, while the sample treated at 400 °C (blue pattern, Fig. 1) is more crystalline, as indicated by the higher intensities of the peaks. The internal graphite standard has allowed us to find that the diffraction peaks of the tridoped Ln3+ samples are shifted towards higher angles than those of the undoped CaF2, indicating a smaller a-axis parameter (see Table S1, ESI†). This behaviour clearly demonstrates that the dopant lanthanide ions are incorporated in the crystal host (see also the results for samples prepared by the MOCVD technique). Moreover, the absence of other peaks in the patterns suggests the exclusive formation of the phase of interest.
The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images in Fig. 2 of the pure CaF2 films obtained on Si and glass substrates, under the same deposition conditions (annealing at 350 °C and 400 °C), show different morphologies. Samples deposited on Si (Fig. 2a and c) show quite homogeneous surfaces, even though the surface presents some shrinkage due to the annealing temperature.
 Fig. 2  FE-SEM images of sol–gel/spin-coated pure CaF2 film annealed at 350 °C and 400 °C on Si (a and c) and glass (b and d). 
In contrast, the samples deposited on glass in Fig. 2b and d show the formation of more homogeneous coatings with small grains of the order of about 150–200 nm, and the presence of some cracks. In particular, the sol–gel CaF2 film deposited on glass at 350 °C shows a surface with some outgrowths (Fig. 2b). Nevertheless, the chemical nature of these outgrowths is the same as the surface underneath. In fact, because the image was recorded using a secondary electron detector, the outgrowth grains appear lighter due to a topographic effect and not to a different composition.
For tri-doped films treated at 350 °C or 400 °C, the EDX analysis has yielded a stoichiometry for the layer of 0.80Ca:0.18Yb (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The homogeneity of the layer was assessed through EDX maps (Fig. S4, ESI†) and various EDX site analyses on the surface (Table S2, ESI†). Erbium and thulium elements are not detected, their amounts being under the detectability limit of the technique. On the other hand, their presence has been undoubtedly confirmed by their spectroscopic properties, as described below. The FE-SEM images of the tri-doped films deposited on Si at 350 and 400 °C show a quite homogeneous morphology (Fig. 3a and b, respectively), similar to the undoped ones, with grains of about 50 nm. The FE-SEM cross-sectional images (Fig. 3c and d) show a thickness of about 700 ± 35 nm and 750 ± 45 nm for the films treated at 350 °C and 400 °C, respectively. From these characterizations, it can be stated that the two different temperatures adopted for the thermal treatment do not significantly affect either the morphology or the phase nature, but only the crystalline characteristics of the layer, fixing the minimum temperature to reach the crystalline CaF2 phase at 350 °C. In fact, annealing at 300 °C produces an amorphous layer under these experimental conditions (Fig. S5, ESI†).

Conversely, the substrate nature seems to play an important role in film homogeneity, indicated by a lower homogeneity for films deposited on Si with respect to those deposited on glass.
This may be likely due to the different wettability of the untreated Si and glass substrates. In addition, the cracking and the shrinkage may be due to the thermal treatment after spin-coating, which is a well-known phenomenon in sol–gel prepared samples.22
In addition, all the samples show the formation of single phase CaF2, as assessed by XRD, on both the two different substrates.
The properties of these films are comparable to those previously reported for the unique example of sol–gel-grown pure CaF2 films on glass substrates.23 Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the present samples are obtained at treatment temperatures that are 100–150 °C lower than those previously reported.23
Fabrication of undoped and Ln3+ tri-doped CaF2 films through the MOCVD approach
MOCVD has been successfully applied to the deposition of the CaF2 phase using the same Ca(hfa)2·diglyme·H2O adduct. Preliminary depositions using only the Ca precursor indicate that the films are crystalline, pure CaF2 phase, compact and homogeneous on the whole area of 10 × 10 mm2. One of the crucial issues in the fabrication of doped layers is to accurately tailor the composition of the deposited layer and to monitor the relationship of the film composition and precursor mixture stoichiometry.
Dynamic thermogravimetric (TG) measurements of the single metal precursors and of a multicomponent mixture containing the main component Ca and Yb adducts in a 0.80:0.20 ratio have shown a good thermal behavior proper for application in a MOCVD process (Fig. 4). In particular, the TG curve of the Ca adduct shows a single step weight loss with a very low residue of about 1.8%. Similarly, the Yb(hfa)3·diglyme, Tm(hfa)3·diglyme and Er(hfa)3·diglyme curves show a single step loss with a residue of about 2%. The TG curve of the Ca–Yb precursor mixture indicates that the mixture behaves as a “single-source” precursor with a single step loss and a residue of 2%, thus indicating a unique vaporization step for the two precursors. The reactivity of the mixture is instead correlated to the different decomposition rates of the components at the different temperatures.
 Fig. 4  Comparison of thermogravimetric curves of the single precursors, Ca(hfa)2·diglyme·H2O and Ln(hfa)3·diglyme (Ln = Yb, Er and Tm), and of the Ca(hfa)2·diglyme·H2O and Yb(hfa)3·diglyme mixture in a Ca:Yb mole ratio of 0.80:0.20 (the main components of the CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+,Tm3+ films). 
Thus, specific depositions (Table 1) were designed to assess the relationship between the precursor mixture ratios and the composition of the layers, with the aim to properly prepare suitable lanthanide doped films for efficient UC emission, in particular with a lanthanide molar ratio Yb:Er:Tm of 0.18:0.02:0.01. This doping concentration represents one of the best ratios to achieve good upconversion properties.2f

Since small percentages of Er3+ and Tm3+ ions are difficult to be quantified with the usual analytical techniques employed for thin films, depositions with higher Er3+ and Tm3+ percentages have been carried out, in particular with a precursor molar metal ratio Ca:Yb:Er:Tm of 0.70:0.10:0.10:0.10. The correlation between the starting lanthanide molar percentages (indicated with red lines) and the actual percentages assessed through EDX, for Yb3+, Er3+ and Tm3+ ions, is reported in Fig. 5, while a typical EDX spectrum is reported in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The three graphs shown in Fig. 5 indicate the distribution (as atomic percentage obtained through EDX) of each element, namely Yb, Er and Tm, for the two different positions A and B in the hot-wall reactor (A and B positions are indicated in the reactor scheme reported in Fig. S1 ESI†). The homogeneity of the layer is assessed through EDX maps (Fig. S7, ESI†) and various EDX site analyses on the surface (Table S2, ESI†).
 Fig. 5  Er, Yb and Tm percentages in CaF2 doped films determined through EDX analysis vs. deposition temperatures. The concentration of the doping ions in the precursor mixtures is 10% (red line) in all cases. Numbers indicate the deposition (see Table 1), while the circles indicate the deposition temperatures at which the nominal composition is mainly maintained. 
For a given nominal deposition temperature, A and B positions have 50 °C and 100 °C lower temperatures with respect to the nominal one, respectively. In Table 1, the legend of the sample names shown in Fig. 5 is reported. All the temperatures reported in the following refer to the real deposition temperature based on the sample position (see Fig. S1, ESI†).
At 500 °C nominal temperature, i.e. at a deposition temperature of 400 °C in A position, the metal atomic ratio of the sample is found to be practically identical to the nominal composition of the mixture, while for the samples in the B position (at 450 °C), a slightly higher amount of doping ions is found. At higher nominal temperatures (depositions 2 and 3), lower amounts of doping ions are found at the A position, while higher amounts are found in the B samples with respect to the nominal composition. These trends can be rationalized by hypothesizing a different decomposition temperature of the precursors, with the Ca precursor likely decomposing at a temperature lower than those of the analogous lanthanide ones. Thus, in position A, the calcium precursor deposits in greater amount with respect to the doping lanthanides, resulting in a net lower percentage of dopants in the final film. In contrast, in position B, i.e. at higher temperatures, the vapor precursor mixture is richer in dopants than in calcium (already partially consumed in A), resulting in a net higher percentage of doping lanthanide ions.
Therefore, the multicomponent mixture shows appropriate thermal behavior for its application in MOCVD processes, allowing an easy control of the film doping composition as a function of the desired deposition temperature. A suitable stoichiometric ratio of the multicomponent precursor mixture of 18%Yb, 2%Er and 1%Tm will be used at temperatures of 400 and 450 °C to prepare suitable lanthanide doped films for efficient UC emission.
It is worth noting that the use of the same polyether (diglyme), to complete the coordination sphere of calcium and lanthanide ions, avoids any possible ligand exchange.
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the undoped CaF2 films deposited by MOCVD in the 400–550 °C range (Fig. S8, ESI†) do not show any difference either as a function of the temperature or the substrate nature, analogous to what was found for the sol–gel/spin-coated films. It is instead interesting to notice the difference due to the lanthanide doping both in terms of peak positions and intensities. For a similar system, it has been previously observed24 that upon doping with Yb, Er or Yb, Tm, the peaks shift to higher 2 theta angles up to around 18% Yb3+ doping concentrations. This corresponds to a decrease of the a-axis parameter for the doped film with respect to that of the undoped sample, while the 23% doped sample shows the same a-axis parameter as the 18% ytterbium doped CaF2 (see Table S1, ESI†).24
In Fig. 6, the XRD patterns of the Ln3+ tridoped 1A and 1B (see Table 1 and Fig. 5) CaF2 films (Ca:Yb:Er:Tm ratio of 0.70:0.10:0.10:0.10) prepared at two different temperatures are reported in comparison with a typical pattern of an undoped CaF2 film deposited at 450 °C. In the case of the tri-doped films, with an actual total Ln3+ (Yb + Er + Tm) concentration of 28% (1A sample) and 38% (1B sample), the a-axis cell parameter is equal to 5.47(6) Å and 5.47(7) Å, respectively.
 Fig. 6  X-ray diffraction patterns of the undoped and tri-doped 1A (blue line) and 1B (red line) CaF2:Yb3+(10%),Er3+(10%),Tm3+(10%) thin films prepared by MOCVD on the Si substrate. 
These concentrations have been estimated by using the EDX results reported in Fig. 5, while the a-axis cell parameters have been estimated using graphite as an internal standard and by using the relationship between hkl and the lattice parameter for a cubic structure. The a-axis values for the tri-doped systems are larger than that obtained for the undoped CaF2 film, which is found to be 5.46(0) Å. The a-axis cell parameters for undoped and tri-doped samples are reported in Table S1 (ESI†).
Two contributions may be considered for the a-axis parameter variation in the doped samples with respect to the undoped one: (i) the difference of the ionic radii of the metal ions and (ii) the effect of the charge compensation. The first contribution, i.e. the slightly smaller ionic radius of Ln3+vs. Ca2+ (Yb3+ (r = 0.985 Å), Er3+ (r = 1.004 Å), Tm3+ (r = 0.994 Å), and Ca2+ (r = 1.12 Å) in eightfold coordination) is responsible for the decrease of the a-axis parameter, but this effect may be compensated by the second one, which is the insertion of interstitial fluoride ions or clusters, needed to balance the system charge. Thus, at this high (≈ 30%) doping, it is likely that the amount of fluoride ions or clusters to balance the charge is so substantial that it not only compensates the effect of the smaller lanthanide ionic radii but produces even larger a-values. A similar trend has been previously reported for highly doped CaF2 nanoparticles.25
In addition, it is interesting to observe that the relative intensities of peaks do not match very well with those reported in the ICDD database. In particular, for the sample deposited at 450 °C, the 311 reflection is the most intense peak, while it has only a 33% intensity in the ICDD card, and the 200 peak is the second most intense peak, while it is only around 1% in the ICDD card. This may be rationalized considering that the Ln3+ ions substitute Ca2+ ones and, being heavier, have larger scattering factors, thus producing a change of the peak relative intensities. Thus, if on one side, the amount of doping ions plays a role in the relative peak intensities, since the intensity variation parallels the doping increase, on the other hand, some preferential orientation may not be ruled out considering that also in the undoped CaF2 films, the relative intensities do not perfectly match the ICDD card values.
The FE-SEM images (Fig. 7) show the morphology of the CaF2:Yb3+(10%),Er3+(10%),Tm3+(10%) films (samples 1A and 1B) on Si and glass substrates. All the samples present very homogeneous surfaces with similar grains in form and dimension. The films deposited at lower temperature, independent of the substrate nature, have very small grains coalescing to form large aggregates of hundreds of nm. At 450 °C, films deposited on Si and glass show similar morphologies with single grains of about 100 nm. From these images, it can be stated that the two substrates used do not significantly affect the final morphology of the films at higher deposition temperature. Taking into account all these results, we adopted the best experimental conditions (Tnom = 500 °C, see Table 1) for the deposition at 400 °C and 450 °C of tri-doped Yb, Er and Tm CaF2 films on Si and glass substrates, using a source mixture atomic ratio Ca:Yb:Er:Tm of 0.80:0.18:0.02:0.01, denoted as CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%).

The EDX analysis confirmed that the films have a Ca:Yb stoichiometry of 0.79:0.18 (see Fig. S9, ESI†).
Analogous to what was observed for the sol–gel/spin-coated tri-doped samples, the erbium and thulium elements are not detected by EDX.
The FE-SEM images of the CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) films are reported in Fig. 8. The morphologies are comparable to those obtained for the highly doped systems, whose morphologies are reported in Fig. 7. This implies that the morphologies are mainly affected by the deposition temperature and substrate nature and not by the lanthanide doping amount.

The cross-sectional images of the CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%), films deposited on Si at 400 °C and 450 °C (whose plan views are shown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively) are reported in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The cross-sections indicate a thickness of about 980 ± 20 nm and 780 ± 20 nm, respectively, for the films deposited at 400 and 450 °C on Si, for an average growth rate of about 1 μm h−1. A similar growth rate is observed on the glass substrate (Fig. S10, ESI†). These films have diffraction patterns similar to those of the CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ film deposited at 500 °C on Si.24 A typical pattern of the CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) film deposited at 400 °C is reported in Fig. S11 (ESI†).
Upconversion properties of the thin films prepared by the sol–gel method
Upconversion spectra for the CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) thin films prepared by the sol–gel method and annealed at 350 and 400 °C on a glass substrate are shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. S12 (ESI†), respectively. Typical emission bands due to Er3+ ions and Tm3+ ions in the visible and near infrared region (NIR) are shown, indicating that these ions are present, although too diluted to be detected with the EDX technique, as described above. The assignments of the emission band to the lanthanide transitions are indicated in the caption of Fig. 9 and Fig. S12 (ESI†) and the upconversion mechanisms following 980 nm excitation are shown in Fig. 10. The emission profile for each band is very similar for samples prepared at different temperatures, indicating that the local crystal fields experienced by the lanthanide ions are similar. The relative intensities of the emission bands with respect to the strongest one in the red region (around 650 nm) are similar for the samples prepared at 350 and 400 °C. One evident difference of the UC spectra is the relative intensity of the Tm3+ emission band around 470 nm, which is slightly stronger for the sample annealed at 350 °C (see Fig. 9 and Fig. S12, ESI†). This behaviour could be due to different efficiencies of the energy transfer processes among the Er3+ and Tm3+ ions, due to slightly different lanthanide ion average distances. It can also be correlated to the different crystallinity and to the domain size of the samples annealed at different temperatures, as indicated by the X-ray diffraction patterns, see Fig. 1. In particular, the heat treatment at 400 °C generates a more crystalline sample than that at 350 °C. The difference in the relative intensities for the Er3+ and Tm3+ emissions is particularly evident for heavily doped Tm3+ and Er3+ CaF2 thin film samples, as described below for the samples prepared through the MOCVD technique.

The macroscopic homogeneity of the samples was further tested by measuring the UC emission, exciting in different spatial positions and by keeping the power laser constant. The integrated UC emission for the CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) thin film prepared by the sol–gel technique and annealed at 350 °C is shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), measured for laser spots in a square region of 6 × 6 mm2. From the analysis, it can be noted that the standard deviation of the integrated emission is lower than 10%, corroborating the good homogeneity of the thin film, as found in the morphological analysis. Therefore, successive UC investigations were performed on a single spot region for each film.
In order to evaluate the upconversion emission efficiency of the obtained thin films, we adopted an alternative method with respect to the much more difficult measurement of the upconversion quantum efficiency using an integrating sphere. Our simpler method is based on the measurements of the minimum power density of the exciting laser source needed to generate emissions that can be detected by the present experimental setup, very similar to those commonly used in typical spectroscopy laboratories (see Experimental section). Therefore, the upconversion spectra of some emission bands for Er3+ and Tm3+ ions were measured as a function of the laser power and they are shown in the insets of Fig. 9 and Fig. S12 (ESI†) for the samples prepared by the sol–gel technique and annealed at 350 and 400 °C, respectively. As is typical for upconversion emissions, at low laser power densities, we found a behaviour in agreement with the equation:26I(UC) ∝ Pnwhere I(UC) represents the upconversion intensity, P is the laser power and n is the order of the upconversion process. The slopes of the fits of the power studies for the sol–gel samples, typically n > 1, are shown in the inset of Fig. 9 and are found to be in agreement with those reported for an Er3+,Tm3+,Yb3+ tridoped CaF2 single crystal,27 denoting a two photon UC process, involved in the population of the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 excited energy levels of Er3+ ions, and creating the green and red emissions, while a three photon UC process, involved in the population of 1G4 excited energy level of Tm3+ ions, creates the blue emission. Most interestingly, the lowest laser powers at which upconversion signals were observed are around 70 mW cm−2 and 90 mW cm−2 for the samples annealed at 350 °C and 400 °C, respectively. It is worth underlining that no paper on alkaline-earth CaF2 or SrF2 upconverting thin films report any information about the upconversion efficiency of the materials. On the other hand, a few papers have been published describing the upconversion properties of Er3+ and Yb3+-doped NaYF4 thin films,19,28 but quantitative data on the upconversion efficiency of such thin films are still missing. Although some power studies on Er3+–Yb3+ codoped upconverting fluoride-based nanoparticles have been reported in the literature,29 it is not easy to directly compare those results with our experimental data. In fact, while in our samples, the laser optical path inside the sample on which the experiments have been carried out is well known (film thickness of 700–750 nm, see Fig. 3 above), no optical paths for the laser excitation radiation are reported for the investigated samples in the literature.29 We expect, in fact, that the upconversion emissions strongly depend on the active volume of sample involved in the generation of the upconversion emission. Nonetheless, in a quite recent paper, Fan et al.30 reported that microparticles of Er3+,Yb3+ doped β-NaYF4, a material that is among the most efficient upconverters, show a minimum power density for the upconversion power study of 700 mW cm−2, while a minimum value of 400 mW cm−2 was used for evaluation of the absolute emission quantum yield. In our systems, the minimum values of the laser power needed in the present samples (70 mW cm−2 and 90 mW cm−2, for the 350 °C and 400 °C samples, respectively) points to a very high upconversion efficiency.
In order to gain information on the excited state dynamics of the lanthanide ions in the thin films, we measured the decay curves of the upconversion emissions, as shown in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  Emission decay curves for the CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) thin films on the glass substrate deposited by the sol–gel technique and annealed at 350 °C (left) and 400 °C (right). Blue line: λem = 480 nm; green line: λem = 550 nm; red line: λem = 660 nm. 
As can be noted, the decay curves show a non-exponential decay for emission originating from both Tm3+ and Er3+ ions. This behaviour is most probably due to the slightly distorted environment in which the lanthanide ions are accommodated and to energy transfer processes among the lanthanide ions. Due to the non-exponential nature, the lifetimes of the lanthanide ion energy levels have been estimated by the time elapsed to decrease the emission intensity from the initial value I0 (for t = 0) to I0/e.
The obtained lifetimes for the Tm3+ and Er3+ ions and uncertainties for the two samples prepared by the sol–gel technique at 350 °C and 400 °C are reported in Table 2. The experimental decay times for the 4S3/2 level of the Er3+ ion in both samples (120 ± 43 μs and 184 ± 9 μs) appear to be lower than the radiative lifetime (565 μs) calculated for an Er3+-doped CaF2 single crystal.31 This behavior indicates that non-radiative processes are present in the thin films, as multiphonon relaxations and possible energy transfers from Er3+ to other lanthanide ions, such as Tm3+ ones. Also, the decay time for the 1G4 level of Tm3+ ions is significantly lower than that observed for a Tm3+-doped CaF2 single crystal32 (1.1 ms for a center with C3v site symmetry), suggesting again the presence of non-radiative relaxations in the present samples. Moreover, the lifetimes for both Er3+ and Tm3+ ions appear to be significantly longer for the sample annealed at 400 °C than for the one annealed at 350 °C.

This behaviour could be explained by a slightly less distorted average local environment around the lanthanide ions due to the higher crystallinity of the sample and to a larger domain size caused by annealing at higher temperature. This is in agreement with the results obtained by the X-ray diffraction patterns and also by the upconversion spectra. Due to non-negligible concentrations of the Er3+ (2%) and Tm3+ (1%) ions in the crystalline host, it is conceivable that energy transfer (ET) processes between lanthanide ions (i.e. between Tm3+ and Er3+) are present, in particular involving the 4S3/2 and the 4F9/2 excited energy levels of the Er3+ ions. In fact, Yeh et al.33 found, for an Er3+ and Tm3+-codoped barium–thorium fluoride glass, several Er3+ → Tm3+ energy transfer processes, in particular involving the 4S3/2 energy level of the Er3+ ion, described by the ET mechanisms: 4S3/2(Er3+) + 3H6(Tm3+) → 4I9/2(Er3+) + 3F4(Tm3+)(3) 4S3/2(Er3+) + 3H6(Tm3+) → 4I11/2(Er3+) + 3H5(Tm3+)(4)
Other energy transfer processes can involve the 4F9/2 energy level of the Er3+ ion: 4F9/2(Er3+) + 3H6(Tm3+) → 4I11/2(Er3+) + 3F4(Tm3+)(5) 4F9/2(Er3+) + 3H6(Tm3+) → 4I13/2(Er3+) + 3H5(Tm3+)(6) 4F9/2(Er3+) + 3H6(Tm3+) → 4I15/2(Er3+) + 3F2,3(Tm3+)(7)These possible Er3+ → Tm3+ energy transfer processes for our upconverting systems are shown in Fig. S14a (ESI†). Relevant Er3+–Tm3+ energy transfers, in line with the results obtained in the present investigation, were also found by Rivera et al. for Er3+–Tm3+-codoped germanium-tellurite glasses.34 Furthermore, the non-exponential nature of the emission decay curve for the Tm3+ ion can also be due to cross-relaxations between Tm3+ ions, as underlined by Wang et al. for NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ microcrystals,35 described by the ET mechanism (see Fig. S14b, ESI†): 1G4(Tm3+) + 3H4(Tm3+) → 3F4(Tm3+) + 1D2(Tm3+)(8)This mechanism can induce the shortening of the 1G4 energy level lifetime of the Tm3+ ions with respect to that observed for a Tm3+ doped CaF2 single crystal,32 as in fact observed for the present thin film samples (see Table 2).
Upconversion properties of thin films prepared by MOCVD
Tridoped Er3+, Tm3+ and Yb3+ heavy doped samples (10%Er3+, 10%Tm3+ and 10%Yb3+ ion concentrations) were prepared by the MOCVD technique at two different deposition temperatures, at 400 and 450 °C. Their upconversion spectra are shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). Emissions in the 500–550 nm green region and in the 625–700 nm region are observed and easily assigned to the Er3+ ions. It has to be noted that only a very weak emission band observed around 800 nm can be attributed to Tm3+ ions. This behaviour is due to very efficient Tm3+ → Er3+ energy transfer processes, suggested by Rivera et al.:34 3F2,3(Tm3+) + 4I15/2(Er3+) → 3H6(Tm3+) + 4F9/2(Er3+)(9)and also by Chan et al.,36 3F4(Tm3+) + 4I11/2(Er3+) → 3H6(Tm3+) + 4F9/2(Er3+)(10)that are very relevant for high doping levels for both Tm3+ and Er3+ ions (see Fig. S14c, ESI†). It is worth noting that both (9) and (10) mechanisms can induce an increased population of the 4F9/2 level of the Er3+ ions and therefore, in turn, an increase of intensity of the band at 660 nm due to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. In fact, from Fig. S15 (ESI†), it can be noted that the relative intensity of the band at 660 nm is much higher with respect to those observed in the 500–550 nm green region, corroborating the presence of the above-mentioned mechanisms increasing the population of the 4F9/2 level of the Er3+ ions.
The upconversion spectra for the tri-doped CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) thin films deposited on glass through MOCVD at 450 °C (B position) and 400 °C (A position) are shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. S16 (ESI†), respectively.
 Fig. 12  Upconversion spectra as a function of the laser power density for the CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) film deposited on glass by MOCVD at 450 °C (B position). Band attribution: (a) Er3+,2H9/2 → 4I15/2; (b) Tm3+,1G4 → 3H6; (c) Er3+,2H11/2 → 4I15/2; (d) Er3+,4S3/2 → 4I15/2; (e) Er3+,4F9/2 → 4I15/2; Tm3+,1G4 → 3F4; (f) Tm3+,3H4 → 3H6. Inset: Upconversion power studies and slopes from fits. 
Emission bands due to Er3+ ions and Tm3+ ions in the visible and near infrared region (NIR) are evident, and the spectra are similar to those observed for the samples prepared by the sol–gel technique. In this case, the emission spectra for the samples prepared at different deposition temperatures appear to be very similar, indicating that the local crystalline environment around the lanthanide ions is barely influenced by the difference in deposition temperature. This observation may be explained considering that at 400 °C, films have already a good crystalline structure (Fig. 6). In analogy with the samples prepared using the sol–gel technique, the upconversion spectra of the emission bands were measured as a function of the laser power. The integrated emissions vs. laser power density and the slopes from fits are shown in the insets of Fig. 12 and Fig. S16 (ESI†), for deposition temperatures of 450 and 400 °C, respectively.
It is worth noting that in these cases, we were also able to measure significant emissions, both in the green and red regions, at a laser power density as low as 100 mW cm−2 for both the samples (see Fig. 12 and Fig. S16 (ESI†)), similar to what was found for the sol–gel prepared samples (see Fig. 9), suggesting an efficient upconversion emission upon 980 nm laser excitation.
The decay curves for the emission of Tm3+ and Er3+ ions embedded in the crystal host for the MOCVD prepared thin films are shown in Fig. 13. In all cases, a non-exponential behaviour of the curves is noted, and lifetimes for the MOCVD grown films, obtained using the same procedure described above for the sol–gel prepared samples, are reported in Table 3. The lifetimes are slightly shorter than those obtained for the sol–gel prepared samples (cf., Table 2).

This behaviour suggests a slightly more distorted environment for the lanthanide ions in the crystal lattice that induces a shortening of the lifetimes with respect to the sol–gel prepared samples.
In order to investigate the colour properties of the emission of the tri-doped samples, a chromaticity coordinate analysis was carried out on all the UC spectra. This analysis is an important tool to understand how the human eye will perceive the color of a certain emission. It consists in weighing an emission spectrum with the response of the cones of the retina of a human eye to radiation in the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) ranges. The color coordinates are plotted in the CIE 1931 space. The color coordinates were calculated for the emission spectra obtained at the maximum excitation power and they are shown in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  CIE 1931 color coordinates: (a) CaF2:Yb3+(10%),Er3+(10%),Tm3+(10%) (MOCVD, 400 °C, 1A); (b) CaF2:Yb3+(10%),Er3+(10%),Tm3+(10%) (MOCVD, 450 °C, 1B); (c) CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) (MOCVD, 400 °C, A position); (d) CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) (MOCVD, 450 °C, B position); (e) CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) (sol–gel, 350 °C); (f) CaF2:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%),Tm3+(1%) (sol–gel, 400 °C). 
As can be easily noted from Fig. 14, emissions of the heavily lanthanide doped samples (prepared by MOCVD, shown as (a) and (b) coordinates) lie in the orange region of the CIE 1931 color space. This is due to the lack of blue emission from Tm3+ ions. On the other hand, the MOCVD and sol–gel samples doped with 18%Yb3+, 2%Er3+ and 1%Tm3+ show color coordinates located in the central part of the CIE 1931 color space, due to the presence of the blue emission of Tm3+ ions ((c), (d), (e) and (f) points in Fig. 14). In particular, the sol–gel sample heat-treated at 350 °C shows an almost perfectly white emission with (0.33, 0.36) color coordinates.
Conclusions
A comparison between vapor phase and solution route approaches for the preparation of pure and Ln-doped CaF2 thin films has been reported using the same starting reagents, i.e. β-diketonate glyme adducts. Both methods are reliable and reproducible, and moreover the fluorinated metal precursors act efficiently as single-sources, thus avoiding the use of external fluorine sources during the synthetic processes. The morphologies of the doped films are quite uniform, with the MOCVD grown layers having a better homogeneity. Thus, the present results indicate that both methods are appealing strategies for preparing these materials on different substrates. A balance of pros and cons between the two synthetic approaches designates the present MOCVD method as a fast, compared to the aging time needed in the sol–gel process, and industrially appealing process, due to its easy scalability. On the other hand, the sol–gel process, if combined with a spraying deposition procedure, would have the advantage of being a low cost approach with a great potential for scaling up. The Yb3+, Er3+,Tm3+ ion tri-doped CaF2 thin films show a strong upconversion emission, especially in the visible region, with features typical of these lanthanide ions. In fact, the power studies indicate that the upconversion emission can be generated with relatively low laser power densities, pointing to very good upconversion efficiencies for both the sol–gel/spin-coated and MOCVD prepared Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ ion tri-doped CaF2 thin films. Color coordinates indicate that the UC emission is in the central region of the CIE1931 color space. For one sample, an almost perfectly white emission with (0.33, 0.36) color coordinates was obtained, thus these systems have the potential to be used as efficient emitting systems in optic applications.
