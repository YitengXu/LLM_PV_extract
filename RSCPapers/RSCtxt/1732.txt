    , Accepted 5th October 2022First published on 5th October 2022AbstractNovel chiral hybrid perovskites are highly demanded for various advanced applications such as spintronics, optoelectronics, photovoltaics etc. However, the scope of these new materials is still limited. Herein, we present new 2D hybrid perovskites based upon chiral α-amino acid L-histidine. The generalized formula of these new compounds can be denoted as (L-HisH)2PbBrxI4−x (where L-His = L-histidine; x = 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.4 and 0). All perovskites are characterized by a very similar structural motif that consists of corner-sharing lead halide octahedra arranged in one-layer thin inorganic slabs interleaved by organic layers established by L-histidinium(1+) cations. L-Histidine provides a breaking of spatial parity of these perovskites that results in their non-centrosymmetric crystal structures. These compounds show a multiband absorption up to 590 nm for iodide perovskite. In addition, new compounds display pronounced single-peak photoluminescence, which finely blue shifts upon the gradual substitution of iodine by bromine. New perovskites exhibit excellent thermal stability up to 490 K and 445 K for bromide and iodide compounds, respectively. These results show the ability of L-histidine to produce novel and highly demanded chiral hybrid perovskites.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have attracted significant research interest due to their promising applications in optoelectronic,1–5 spintronic6 and photovoltaic7–11 devices. Within a decade, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has increased from 3.8% to a certified value of 25.7%,12,13 the highest value among the solution-processable thin-film photovoltaics. Among the whole family of perovskites, three-dimensional (3D) halide perovskites have shown superior photovoltaic efficacy. This can be attributed to their unique optoelectronic properties, such as direct and suitable band gap,14 extremely high absorption coefficient,15 long charge carrier diffusion length,16 excellent ambipolar charge carrier transport properties,17 high defect tolerance,18 and the possibility of solution processing at low temperatures.19 3D organic–inorganic perovskites feature the general formula of ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation, e.g., methylammonium (CH3NH3+),20,21 formamidinium (HC(NH2)2),22,23 aziridinium (CH2(NH2+)CH2),24etc.25–27 B is typically a metal cation and X is a halide anion such as I−, Br−, and Cl−.
Unfortunately, the main disadvantage of 3D halide perovskites is their poor stability towards environmental factors (humidity, heat, UV-radiation etc.).28,29 The low stability of 3D perovskites urged many lines of research to seek alternatives based on more stable low-dimensional perovskites.30,31 Layered low-dimensional perovskites are also referred to in the literature as 2D perovskites and in virtue of their layered structure these compounds are characterized by their extraordinary stability which stems from their low ion migration and water-resistant nature.32 Besides, compared to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites offer unique structural flexibility, which provides the possibility to incorporate a great variety of functional organic cations to generate unique electronic and optical properties.33–36 According to this, various chiral cations can be incorporated into the structure of 2D hybrid perovskites which renders them with unique physical properties attributed to breaking of spatial parity, such as ferroelectricity,37–40 nonlinear optical response,41 circular dichroism,42,43 circularly polarized photoluminescence44etc.
Interestingly, chiral low-dimensional perovskites can exhibit such phenomena as the ferroelectric–photovoltaic effect.45 Such an effect offers efficient pathways to accomplish charge separation in materials. The biggest difference between the photovoltaic effect in a ferroelectric material and that in a conventional semiconductor p–n junction is the magnitude of the electric field that separates the photogenerated electron–hole pair; the effective electric field in a ferroelectric material is around one order of magnitude higher than in a p–n junction. Thus, compared to conventional photovoltaic materials, ferroelectric photovoltaic materials can produce voltages that are significantly higher than the bandgap. Besides, electric-field control over domain structure allows the photovoltaic effect in such materials to be reversed in polarity or turned off.
Among the whole scope of chiral organic molecules bearing amino group(s), chiral α-amino acids are the most interesting. Chiral α-amino acids are ubiquitous in nature and therefore they are easily accessible precursors. Previously, there were reports on hybrid halide perovskites incorporating chiral α-amino acids such as lysine,46 ornithine,46 alanine47 and proline.48 However, examples of hybrid perovskites incorporating chiral α-amino acids are still rare.
Special attention is drawn to the chiral α-amino acid histidine, which is one of the essential amino acids. This molecule is interesting due to its chirality and the side chain aromatic imidazolium ring which is small enough (reff = 2.58 Å)49 to intrude in cuboctahedral cavities and facilitate the charge distribution between the organic and inorganic parts of hybrid perovskites. As was shown previously, the incorporation of imidazole-ring-containing molecules into hybrid perovskite structures may result in the narrowing of their band-gap. As an example, Li et al. reported a chiral hybrid perovskite (C5H11N3)SbI5 (where C5H11N32+ is the histammonium cation) with a surprisingly low band gap of ∼1.79 eV as for a Sb-containing perovskite, which results in its black color.50 Besides, temperature-dependent conductivity measurements confirmed the semiconductivity of this hybrid perovskite.
Previously, it was shown that hybrid perovskites incorporating organic molecules based on the imidazole ring may be promising for photovoltaic applications. Mao et al. proposed a thin film solar cell based on a 2D hybrid lead iodide perovskite (HA)PbI4 (HA = histammonium cation) which shows a maximum efficiency of 1.13%.51 Another study showed a thin film photovoltaic cell incorporating the same hybrid perovskite with a power conversion efficiency of 1.83%.52 It should be noted that this is the highest value obtained thus far for pure one-layer thick lead-iodide perovskites and is more than 20 times higher than those obtained for materials based on more traditional cations such as phenylethylammonium (0.08%).52
Owing to the chirality of L- or D-histidine, it can be used to produce noncentrosymmetric polar coordination compounds that are efficient for second-harmonic generation.53,54 Recently, Tofanello et al. proposed a novel strategy to provide magnetism to a 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite using histidine molecules as a spacer, which could induce charge rebalancing at the interface of the inorganic layer. It was proposed that the imidazole group, possibly assisted by the carboxyl group close to the vicinity of the terminal amine, is provoking charge rearrangement from Pb2+ to paramagnetic Pb3+ ions, resulting in a positive magnetic moment.55
According to all aforementioned achievements, histidine-based hybrid perovskites may be promising for various applications including photovoltaics, optoelectronics, spintronics etc. Unfortunately, the field of hybrid perovskites incorporating histidine molecules is still not explored.
Here we report new chiral 2D organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites based on chiral α-amino acid L-histidine, namely (L-HisH)2PbBr4 (Br4), (L-HisH)2PbBr3I (Br3I), (L-HisH)2PbBr2I2 (Br2I2), (L-HisH)2PbBrI3 (BrI3) and (L-HisH)2PbBr0.4I3.6 (Br0.4I3.6) (where L-His = L-histidine).
According to single-crystal XRD, these compounds consist of single-layered inorganic lattices with corner-sharing lead halide octahedra [PbHal42−]∞ that proliferate in two dimensions and are interleaved with organic layers presented by L-histidinium(1+) cations and co-crystalized water molecules. These 2D structures result in strong quantum confinement that leads to pronounced luminescence in the visible range.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure determination
The perovskites I4, Br0.4I3.6, and Br4 were crystallized in the form of large crystals suitable for single-crystal XRD measurements. According to single-crystal XRD, the perovskites I4 and Br4 crystallized in the chiral space group C2221 of the orthorhombic crystal system. However, in the case of the Br0.4I3.6 perovskite, a lowering of symmetry is observed. This perovskite crystallized in the chiral space group C2 of the monoclinic family. The crystal data and structure refinement details are summarized in Table 1.

Taking into account that the crystal structures of all obtained perovskites are very similar, only the fragments of the crystal structure of I4 are shown in Fig. 1.

The thermal ellipsoids are drawn at the 50% probability level. (b) The hydrogen bonding scheme showing the principal hydrogen bonds between the inorganic and organic parts of I4; (c) Three types of hydrogen bonds inside the organic layer of I4. (d) The packing diagram of I4 showing the inorganic/organic layers. The shortest distance between the adjacent inorganic layers is of 15.33 Å. Symmetry codes: (i) −½ + x, ½ − y, 1 − z; (ii) −½ + x, ½ + y, + z; (iii) +x, 1 − y; 1 − z; and (iv) −½ + x, −½ + y, +z. 
According to X-ray crystallography, the crystal structure of I4 is built up from an anionic [PbHal4/2Hal2/12−] inorganic framework (Hal4/2 denotes four equatorial atoms bonded in a corner-sharing manner and Hal2/1 denotes two axial halogen atoms bonded only to Pb atoms), organic L-HisH+ amino acid cations and co-crystallized water molecules in a 1:2:0.22 ratio (Fig. 1(a)). At the same time, for the Br4 and Br0.4I3.6 perovskites there are no co-crystallized water molecules in their crystal structures.
The central Pb2+ ions are coordinated with six halides forming a slightly distorted PbHal6 octahedron. The bond lengths and bond angles slightly deviate from ideal octahedral values (Tables S1 and S2†). The maximum Pb–Hal bond lengths of I4, Br0.4I3.6 and Br4 are 3.2134(11) Å, 3.1872(14) Å and 3.100(3) Å, respectively. Such a decrease in maximum bond length is in agreement with the substitution of iodine with bromine. The same tendency is observed for the minimum Pb–Hal bond lengths which are 3.1496(13) Å, 3.094(6) Å and 2.953(3) Å for I4, Br0.4I3.6 and Br4, respectively.
The bond angles between cis halogens (cis-Hal–Pb–Hal angles), which are helpful to assess the distortion of the octahedra, vary from 82.144(15)° to 101.30(5)° for I4 and from 81.039(8)° to 104.86(11)° for Br4. Interestingly, a similar variation between the cis-angles is observed for Br0.4I3.6 which changes from 80.2(3)° to 98.741(8)°. In contrast to the cis-angles, for the trans-angles only a slight variation in their values is observed. For example, the bond angles between trans halogens (trans-Hal–Pb–Hal angles) vary from 176.42(5)° to 177.95(5)° for I4 while for Br4 these angles vary from 174.07(12)° to 177.83(14)°. Interestingly, the Br0.4I3.6trans-angles change from 178.3(2)° to 178.6(2)°.
It is worth noting that the perovskite Br0.4I3.6 is characterized by the lowest variation of its trans-angles compared to other perovskites described here.
The angle distortion parameter  (where αi are the twelve cis-Hal–Pb–Hal angles around the metal atom) is often used to estimate the coordination-sphere distortion. The value of Σ for I4, Br0.4I3.6 and Br4 is 36.82°, 41.94° and 41.73°, respectively. It should be emphasized that Br0.4I3.6 is characterized by the highest degree of coordination-sphere distortion among histidine-based perovskites.
Bond length distortions,  (where di denotes the six Pb–Hal bond lengths and d is the mean Pb–Hal bond length) and bond angle variances,  (where θi denotes the individual cis-Hal–Pb–Hal bond angles), quantify the distortions of individual PbHal6 octahedra relative to an undistorted octahedron. The gradual increase in σ2 values upon the gradual substitution of iodide with bromide is observed. These values are 25.13 (°)2, 28.63 (°)2 and 36.04 (°)2 for I4, Br0.4I3.6 and Br4, respectively. The calculated Δd values are also gradually increasing and are 6.79 × 10−5, 1.47 × 10−4 and 4.10 × 10−4 for I4, Br0.4I3.6 and Br4, respectively.
As was shown previously, the in-plane M–Hal–M bond angle between two adjacent corner-sharing octahedra (where M = Pb, Sn, etc., Hal = halide anions) has the greatest impact on tuning the band gap of hybrid perovskites.56 Bending the in-plane M–Hal–M bond angle away from 180°, where the orbital overlap is achieved, decreases the width of both the valence and conduction bands and increases the band gap. The in-plane Pb–Hal–Pb bond angles of I4 and Br4 are 176.42(5)° and 174.08(12)°, respectively. Interestingly, in the case of Br0.4I3.6, the in-plane Pb–Br/I–Pb bond angle is 178.3(2)°. The values of the in-plane M–Hal–M bond angles for all hybrid perovskites slightly deviate from the ideal value of 180°. To the best of our knowledge, these in-plane Pb–Hal–Pb bond angles for histidine-based perovskites are among the highest for 2D hybrid perovskites.57,58 It is important to note that such high values of in-plane Pb–Hal–Pb bond angles for the histidine-based perovskites are due to the comparable sizes of the imidazolium binding group (reff = 2.58 Å)49 and the cuboctahedral cavities (2.60 Å for lead iodide perovskites),59 which leads to less-distorted inorganic lattices.
The inorganic motifs of all the perovskites are derived from the cubic perovskite structure sliced along the 〈100〉 direction and established by corner-sharing lead halide octahedra which form infinite 2D layers. The shortest distance between the adjacent inorganic layers is 15.33 Å, 15.36 Å and 14.91 Å for I4, Br0.4I3.6 and Br4, respectively. The inorganic 2D layers are interleaved by organic cation layers, which consist of protonated L-histidine molecules. The organic cations are aligned parallel to the c-axis. Structural analysis shows that L-histidinium cations interact with inorganic lattices both through the protonated amino groups and the imidazolium rings. The protonated amino groups form N–H⋯Hal hydrogen bonds with apical halide atoms. At the same time, histidinium cations intrude into the inorganic lattice and form C–H⋯Hal hydrogen bonds with apical halide atoms (Fig. 1(b)). Besides, in the case of I4, the co-crystallized water molecules are engaged in hydrogen bonding between the organic cations and inorganic lattices. Thus, water molecules interact with the imidazole ring through N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds. In turn, the water molecules bond to the inorganic lattice through O–H⋯I hydrogen bonds with equatorial iodide atoms.
The cohesion inside the organic layers is established by three types of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1(c) and Table S3†). As a result, the main crystal packing motif can be characterized as a three-dimensional supramolecular network as shown in Fig. 1(d).
The correspondence of the powder samples of I4 and Br4 to the described single crystals was confirmed by PXRD (Fig. S1 and S2†).
Rietveld refinement
As was previously shown, the halide substitution of hybrid perovskites can progressively change their optical properties.60 In order to demonstrate the applicability of the halide substitution strategy on histidine-based hybrid perovskites, we obtained three compounds: BrI3, Br2I2, and Br3I. Unfortunately, these mixed-halide perovskites do not form large crystals but precipitate as high-crystalline powders that are only suitable for PXRD measurements. Thus, we performed Rietveld refinement to index the crystal structure of these mixed-halide perovskites under ambient conditions. Our refinement data indicates that all mixed-halide hybrid perovskites crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2 with lattice parameters that are summarized in Table 2. A clear trend of reduction in unit cell parameters along the three principal crystallographic axes is observed with an increase in the content of bromide ions in hybrid perovskite structures (Fig. 2).

Therefore, we can conclude that mixing the stoichiometric amounts of lead halide and L-histidine amino acid results in the formation of hybrid mixed-halide perovskites of desirable compositions. Thus, our histidine-based hybrid perovskites offer the possibility to fine tune their optoelectronic properties in a wide range. The Rietveld refinement data is shown in Table 2 and the Rietveld refinement plots are shown in Fig. S3–S5.†
Thermogravimetric analysis
To investigate the thermal stability of these compounds at elevated temperatures, TGA measurements were conducted under nitrogen flow from 300 to 620 K (Fig. 3). According to TGA measurements, compounds I4 and Br4 start to decompose at 445 K and 490 K, respectively (Fig. 3a). The temperatures of decomposition of these hybrid perovskites are within the expected range for the layered 2D hybrid perovskites (Fig. 3a).61,62 The mixed-halide perovskites BrI3, Br2I2 and Br3I show a ∼1.2% decrease in weight up to 450 K and after that temperature–weight loss attains an abrupt character (Fig. 3b). A multiple-step decomposition profile for all five hybrid perovskites can be observed. Unfortunately, due to the strong overlay of the first and second steps of weight loss, we cannot precisely quantify the weight losses at these steps of decomposition. Therefore, any assignment of each step of weight loss to volatilization of a particular component of these hybrid perovskites is difficult. However, we can assert that the overall weight loss of these hybrid perovskites can be attributed to the removal of water, the corresponding HHal acid and partially to the L-histidine molecules.63

Optical properties
UV-vis measurements
UV-vis measurements were performed for the bromide and iodide perovskites, but also the 1:1 perovskite to see the effect of halogen mixing. Fig. 4(a) shows the solid-state UV-vis absorption spectra of compounds I4, Br2I2 and Br4 deposited on a quartz substrate measured at room temperature. It is found that there are two distinct absorption peaks in the absorption spectra of these compounds. The lower energy absorption peak finely shifts from 568 nm to 493 nm and 411 nm, respectively, upon the gradual substitution of iodine on bromine (Fig. 4(b)). These wavelengths are, to the best of our knowledge, the highest values observed for PbHal4-based (Hal = Br, I) perovskites. In addition to the main excitonic peak, a second absorption peak is detected at 390 nm for I4, 367 nm for Br2I2 and 317 nm for Br4 (Fig. 4(b)). The excitonic absorption peak at a higher wavelength mainly arises from the electronic transitions within the inorganic layer. Such electronic transitions occur from the top of the valence band consisting of a mixture of Pb(6s)–Hal(np) (where Hal = Br, I or Br/I, n = 4 for Br or 5 for I) states to the bottom of the conduction band consisting of the Pb(6p) state.64,65 The absorption peaks at lower wavelengths shown in Fig. 4 are presumably attributed to both the charge transfer transition between the organic and inorganic layers and the higher order exciton transition energy levels.66–69

(b) Plot demonstrating the position of the low (red dotted line) and high (blue dash dotted line) energy absorption peaks of different perovskites prepared as a function of the halide composition. 
Photoluminescence measurements
Previous studies on various organic–inorganic lead(II) compounds have demonstrated their strong luminescence in the visible range, arising from the electronic transitions within the inorganic layers. As was shown previously, hybrid perovskites incorporated with imidazolium-based organic molecules are prone to exhibit strong photoluminescence.51,70–73Fig. 5 shows the solid-state emission and excitation spectra of all five hybrid perovskites measured at room temperature.

(b) The room-temperature excitation spectra of I4 (red line), Br4 (blue line), BrI3 (green line), Br2I2 (purple line), and Br3I (yellow line). 
The photoluminescence spectra of these hybrid perovskites feature a single peak emission. The emission and excitation wavelengths for all perovskites are shown in Table 3. Considering that saturated organic molecules show no photoluminescence bands and cannot lead to luminescence in the visible region allowed us to conclude that these bands are related to the inorganic part of these perovskites and lead to the luminescence in the visible region (Fig. 5). Consequently, the observed bands are due to the electronic transitions and recombination of excitons in the anionic part [PbHal4]2−. The photoluminescence emission spectra of all compounds show a red shift as the halogen progresses from Br to I, which is consistent with the previously reported results.74 Besides, these emissions are characterized by wide full-widths at half-maximum (FWHMs) (Table 3).

These results show the ability of histidine-based perovskites as efficient luminescent materials whose emissive properties can be readily manipulated by systematic variation of the halide ratio in the aimed perovskite. Besides, taking into account the chirality of these hybrid perovskites, it is assumed that these materials may be promising for applications in advanced optics and spintronics.
Conclusions
In this work, we have synthesized and characterized new chiral 2D hybrid perovskites based on the α-amino acid L-histidine. According to XRD studies, these compounds are characterized by a very similar structural motif that consists of corner-sharing lead halide octahedra arranged in 〈100〉-oriented anion layers interleaved by organic cation layers established by monoprotonated L-histidine molecules. Importantly, histidine-based hybrid perovskites are characterized by high values of in-plane Pb–Hal–Pb bond angles, which slightly deviate from the ideal value of 180°. To the best of our knowledge, these in-plane Pb–Hal–Pb bond angles are among the highest for 2D hybrid perovskites. This shows the ability of L-histidine in producing new hybrid perovskites with less distorted inorganic lattices that will result in a lower band gap. Interestingly, the compounds I4 and Br4 crystallized in the chiral orthorhombic space group C2221, whereas the mixed-halide compounds Br3I, Br2I2 and BrI3 crystallized in the less symmetric chiral monoclinic space group C2. This observation showed that the halogen substitution strategy is a promising approach not only for the manipulation of the optical properties of perovskites but also for the control of their crystal structures.
According to UV-vis measurements, the absorption spectra of the compounds I4, Br2I2 and Br4 feature two distinct absorption peaks, which are finely blue shifted upon the gradual substitution of iodine by bromine. Besides, photoluminescent measurements showed the distinct halide-substituent dependent emission properties of all the five perovskites, which are in good correlation with the UV-vis absorption measurements. Thus, I4 emission peaks at 610 nm whereas for Br2I2 and Br4, the emission maximum is observed at 554 nm and at 445 nm, respectively. These results show that modification over halide composition has a great impact on the optical properties of these hybrid perovskites. According to thermogravimetric analysis, the newly fabricated hybrid perovskites exhibit good thermal stability. Such stability combined with chirality and highly tunable luminescence properties makes these materials promising for various potential applications in advanced optoelectronic and spintronic devices.
