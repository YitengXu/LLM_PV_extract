    , Accepted 1st March 2016First published on 1st March 2016AbstractElectrochemical transformation of CO2 into functional materials or fuels (i.e., carbon, CO) in high temperature molten salts has been demonstrated as a promising way of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) in recent years. In a view of continuous operation, the electrolysis process should match very well with the CO2 absorption kinetics. At the same time, in consideration of the energy efficiency, a molten salt electrochemical cell running at lower temperature is more beneficial to a process powered by the fluctuating renewable electricity from solar/wind farms. Ternary carbonates (Li:Na:K = 43.5:31.5:25.0) and binary chlorides (Li:K = 58.5:41.5), two typical kinds of eutectic melt with low melting points and a wide electrochemical potential window, could be the ideal supporting electrolyte for the molten salt CO2 capture and electro-transformation (MSCC-ET) process. In this work, the CO2 absorption behaviour in Li2O/CaO containing carbonates and chlorides were investigated on a home-made gas absorption testing system. The electrode processes as well as the morphology and properties of carbon obtained in different salts are compared to each other. It was found that the composition of molten salts significantly affects the absorption of CO2, electrode processes and performance of the product. Furthermore, the relationship between the absorption and electro-transformation kinetics are discussed based on the findings.
Introduction
The sustained increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has caused great concern for its effect on global climate change. In fact, carbon dioxide is not only a greenhouse gas but also an abundant C1 resource. Therefore, in addition to CO2 capture and storage (CCS),1,2 converting CO2 into useful products such as hydrocarbons and other chemicals is highly desirable for sustainable development.3,4 Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) is very attractive as a mid-term solution owing to the reduced burden on limited geological storage sites in CCS processes.5,6 Electrochemical transformation of CO2 into chemicals, fuels and functional materials, especially driven by renewable electricity is one of the most promising ways of CCUS.
The investigated electrolytes for CO2 electro-transformation include aqueous solutions,7 ionic liquids,8 high temperature molten salts9 and solid electrolytes.10 Electrochemical reduction of CO2 into low-carbon fuels in aqueous solution is a proven technology.11,12 However, the reaction kinetics, current efficiency and the selectivity of products in aqueous solution is still unsatisfactory due to the poor solubility of CO2 and limited electrochemical window of the electrolyte, which has driven research into efficient electro-catalysts for CO2 conversion.13,14 Ionic liquids are more satisfying candidates due to their low vapour pressure, higher CO2 absorption capacity and electrochemical stability, but the high cost as well as the slow reaction kinetics currently prevent them from large scale application.15,16
High temperature molten salts are cheaper, more abundant and available with a high ionic conductivity, low vapour pressure and wide electrochemical window.17,18 The reaction kinetics can be easily accelerated at elevated temperature without the use of complex and costly catalysts.19–23 Besides, there are plenty of industrial experiences in primary aluminium and magnesium production to scale up the process. Although there is very limited data on the solubility of CO2 in high temperature molten salts so far, it was recently reported that the absorption capacity of solid absorbents for CO2 can be activated and improved by molten salts.24–27 In fact, the absorption of CO2 in molten salts can be enhanced by a chemical reaction between the acidic CO2 and alkaline absorbents. Alkali metal oxides and alkali earth metal oxides have strong basicity and would be preferential absorbents. Table 1 presents the equilibrium activity of MxO (M = Li, Na, K, Ca) under CO2 pressure of 1 atm at 450 °C. All the data is lower than 10−4 M, in other words, the equilibrium partial pressure of CO2 is in the range of 10−2 to 10−19 atm if the activity of the oxides in the melt could be kept at 0.01 M. From the data in Table 1 and as evidenced by experiments from different groups,9,20,28,29 carbon is the preferential product when Li2CO3 and/or CaCO3 is a component of molten salts. Therefore, CO2 can be absorbed and decomposed in the high temperature molten salts with Li2CO3 and/or CaCO3, which forms the foundation of the molten salt CO2 capture and electrochemical transformation (MSCC-ET) process.

The possible products of electrochemical transformation from CO2 in high temperature molten salts mainly include carbon (in the form of carbon powder, film or compounds with metals) and/or carbon monoxide, depending on the temperature and applied cell voltage.30,31 In some cases, syngas can be obtained when water vapour is present.32–34Table 2 briefly summarises the major molten salt systems and the transformation products of the MSCC-ET process reported in literature in recent years. The supporting electrolyte (molten salt) can be roughly divided into two categories, molten carbonates and molten chlorides. Usually the melt contains alkaline carbonate or oxide as absorbent, Chen et al. recently pointed out that alkaline earth metal oxides/carbonates (CaO, BaO) can also be used as absorbents for CO2.28

Carbonate melts have been successfully applied in molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) for a long time. It recent decades, ternary, binary or single molten alkali carbonates have been applied as the electrolyte for MSCC-ET in the temperature range of 450–950 °C as listed in Table 2. In the early 2000s, Groult et al. synthesised nanostructured carbon by electro-reduction of carbonate anion in fused ternary alkaline carbonates and investigated its potential application as negative material for lithium ion batteries.20,35 Kaplan et al. reported the process of converting CO2 to CO in molten Li2CO3 at 850–900 °C using a titanium cathode and a graphite anode,36 and the reported thermodynamic efficiency exceeded 85%. Licht et al. proposed a solar thermal electrochemical photo (STEP) carbon capture process in a molten Li2CO3 electrolyte with a nickel cathode and a Pt anode, CO2 was reduced to CO and C at 750–950 °C.22 Wang et al. reported that CO2 can be converted into value-added carbon and oxygen using a SnO2 inert anode in molten Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 at 500 °C.23 The influences of temperature and cell voltage on the process have recently been investigated in detail.37 Chen et al. also reported carbon powder by electro-reduction of CO2 in Li2CO3–K2CO3 at 500–700 °C.19 More recently, Chery et al. analysed and reviewed the thermodynamics of the reduction of CO2 in molten carbonates.30,31
As shown in Table 2, the reduction of CO2 can also be achieved directly or indirectly in carbonate-containing molten halides.39 Ito and Kawamura reported that carbon film deposited on an aluminium electrode in LiCl–KCl–K2CO3 melts when CO2 was fed into the cell. The current density was 100 mA cm−2, much higher than that reported in aqueous solution.21 Thermodynamically K2CO3 was converted into Li2CO3 in the melt for the Gibbs energy change of 2LiCl + K2CO3 = Li2CO3 + 2KCl is −105.31 kJ mol−1. Similar works were reported in LiF–NaF–Na2CO3 melt and LiCl–Li2CO3 melt.40,41 More recently Chen et al. reported carbon deposition in CaCl2–CaCO3–LiCl–KCl, confirming the possibility of CO2 capture and reduction from CaCO3-containing molten chlorides.28 It was also reported that mild steel or titanium can be electro-carburized using CO2 feedstock in molten carbonate salts to form a hardened surface.38,42 These studies demonstrated that the electrochemical reduction of carbonate/CO2 are significantly influenced by electrolysis temperature, cell voltage and melt composition, etc.
The mechanism for the MSCC-ET process can be briefly presented as eqn (1)–(4). In the molten salts containing MxCO3 (M = Li, Ca, …), the carbonate is reduced to carbon (eqn (1) and (2)) or carbon monoxide (eqn (1a) and (2a)) with release of metal oxide and oxygen. The difference between eqn (1) and (2) is due to the difference in the anodic reaction. Depending on the experimental conditions, the formed CO can be further reduced to C (eqn (3)). The as-formed oxides can absorb CO2 to regenerate carbonates (eqn (4)), maintaining the sustainable operation of the process. The molten salt suitable for production of carbon from CO2 should be able to dissolve oxygen ions by which CO2 can be absorbed and converted to carbonate ions. 3MxCO3 = 3MxO + C + 2CO2 + O2(1) 4MxCO3 = 4MxO + 2CO + 2CO2 + O2(1a) MxCO3 = MxO + C + O2(2) 2MxCO3 = 2MxO + 2CO + O2(2a) 2CO = 2C + O2(3) MxO + CO2 = MxCO3(4)
If the MSCC-ET process was driven by electricity from fossil fuels, it will generate more CO2. A desirable process is driven by renewable energy and/or industrial waste heat, therefore, maintaining a molten salt bath at relatively low temperature would be more preferential to prevent heat loss and corrosion of structural materials. Furthermore, carbon thermodynamically tends to be the reduction product from CO2 at lower temperature.30,31 It is well known that Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 (43.5:31.5:25 mol%) and LiCl–KCl (58.5:41.5 mol%) are typical eutectics with a low melting point, 393 °C and 353 °C, respectively. Besides, they all have a wide electrochemical window and are able to dissolve alkaline oxides or carbonates. As shown in Table 2, the reduction products were significantly influenced by the composition of molten salts as well as experimental conditions such as temperature and electrode materials. In fact, due to their different physicochemical properties of molten salts such as basicity, solubility, viscosity and etc., both CO2 absorption and electrochemical reaction processes would be affected by the molten salt composition. In this work, the absorption kinetics, electrochemical behaviour, energy efficiency, and properties of the products of the two kinds of low temperature MSCC-ET electrolyte were investigated and compared in detail. Furthermore, the kinetic coupling between the CO2 absorption and electrochemical transformation was also discussed based on the obtained results.
Experimental
CO2 absorption
CO2 absorption studies were carried out by a home-made gas absorption experimental set-up. The set-up consisted of two high temperature vessels (a gas storage vessel and a CO2 absorption vessel, interconnected by a valve) with identical volume (3.5 L). An alumina crucible with 100 g salts (typically, 180 mmol kg−1 Li2O-containing molten Li–Na–K carbonates or 180 mmol kg−1 Li2O/CaO-containing molten Li–K chlorides) was placed on the bottom of the absorption vessel. Before absorption, the connected vessels were purged with argon and evacuated to near vacuum repeatedly at room temperature, and then they were separated from each other by turning off the valve. The set-up was then heated to 450 °C at a rate of 5 °C min. A certain amount of CO2 gas (99% purity) was purged into the gas storage vessel after the temperature was stable. After equilibrium, CO2 was introduced into the absorption vessel by turning on the valve quickly. The internal pressure and temperature was automatically monitored by a digital pressure indicator with a precision of ±0.001 kPa and a thermal couple with an accuracy of ±0.01 K, respectively, which were recorded and stored in a personal computer. All trials were carried out for at least 3 times, and the mean value is reported here. The absorption amount of CO2 was calculated according to the transient pressure of the reactor: (5)where nCO2 (mmol) is the absorption amount of CO2 at given time t (min), Pg (kPa) is the initial CO2 pressure in the gas storage vessel, P (kPa) is the CO2 pressure at time t (min), and Pv (kPa) is the saturated vapour pressure of eutectic melts. Vg (cm3) and Ve (cm3) are the volume of the gas storage and the absorption vessel, respectively. Vm (cm3) and Vc (cm3) represent the volume of molten salts and crucible, respectively.
Cyclic voltammetry and electrolysis
Cyclic voltammetry was applied to investigate the electrochemical behaviour of the eutectic melt with different compositions under CO2 atmosphere. Molten Li–Na–K carbonates (43.5:31.5:25 mol%) or molten Li–K chlorides (58.5:41.5 mol%) with 2 mol% Li2CO3/CaCO3 were used as the electrolytes. Approximately 500 g salt was dried at 250 °C under argon for up to 24 h to remove original moisture before it was heated to the desired temperatures under CO2. CO2 was continuously bubbled into the melt through an alumina tube during the tests. CV measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI-1140, CH Instrument Co. Ltd., USA) using a three-electrode configuration. The reference electrode consisted of a silver wire placed in an alumina tube filled with 0.5 mol% Ag2SO4-containing molten Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 or 0.5 mol% AgCl-containing LiCl–KCl respectively. The working and counter electrode were a nickel (Ni) wire (1 mm in dia., 0.64 cm2 in electrolyte) and a graphite rod (6 mm in dia., 4.00 cm2 in electrolyte), respectively.
Galvanostatic electrolysis at a current density of 25 to 100 mA cm−2 was carried out in different melts using a computer-controlled power source (Shenzhen Neware Electronic Co. Ltd., China). A Ni sheet (24 cm2 area) and graphite rod (44 cm2 area) served as cathode and anode, respectively. CO2 was bubbled into the melts during electrolysis. Products deposited on the cathode were collected and rinsed with 1 M HCl and distilled water to remove the adherent frozen electrolyte, and were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 hours.
Characterization and electrochemical performance of the obtained carbon
The obtained products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Sirion field emission), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD, Shimadzu X-ray 6000 with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 250 mA, λ = 0.154 nm), Laser Confocal Raman Microspectroscopy (Renishaw RM1000, UK) at room temperature with an excitation wavelength at 514.5 nm from a diode pumped solid-state laser and a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 automatic analyser at liquid N2 temperature.
The capacitive performance of carbon samples was investigated in 6 M KOH with a two-electrode testing cell. The electrodes were prepared into carbon films by mixing the carbon with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and commercial acetylene black (8:1:1). Nickel foam was used as a current collector and was covered by the carbon film with a surface area of about 0.8 cm2. The mass loading of the active material was approximately 5 mg cm−2. Two electrodes with almost identical mass loading were assembled in a cell for the measurements. Their capacitive performances were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements, which were carried out on a PGSTAT 302N Autolab Electrochemical Workstation. The gravimetric capacitances Cg (F g−1) were then calculated from the measured capacitance and the mass of active material.
Results and discussion
The static absorption curves of CO2 by different molten salts at 450 °C under the CO2 partial pressure of 50 kPa are shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, absorption of CO2 in blank molten LiCl–KCl is negligible, while CO2 solubility in oxide-free molten ternary carbonates was much higher, approximately 6 mmol CO2 was absorbed by 100 g blank Li–Na–K carbonates. The results demonstrated that the structure and composition of molten salts has a significant effect on the CO2 absorption. Molten carbonates have a stronger interaction with CO2 than molten chlorides. The following chemical capture mechanism43,44 (eqn (6) and (7)) could be possible for molten carbonates. CO2 + CO32− = C2O52−(6) CO2 + nCO32− = Cn+1O3n+22−(7)

Interestingly, very different absorption behaviour was present when 18 mmol Li2O or CaO was added into 100 g salts, respectively. CO2 can be rapidly captured when Li2O or CaO was added into molten LiCl–KCl. The LiCl–KCl melt with CaO and Li2O absorbed 17 mmol and 16.9 mmol CO2, respectively when the equilibrium was reached. According to the absorption reaction as shown in eqn (4), the conversion efficiency was around 94% for Li2O and CaO in the molten chlorides. Besides, it took less time to reach absorption equilibrium in molten chlorides than in molten carbonates with CaO or Li2O, totally different from the blank molten salts. The absorption kinetics of CaO in molten chlorides is much faster and reached equilibrium within 2 hours although its absorption equilibrium constant was much lower than that of Li2O. The conversion efficiency of Li2O in molten carbonate (approximately 45%) is much lower than that in molten chlorides (approximately 94%), suggesting the property of molten salt affects both the absorption thermodynamics and kinetics of Li2O. This phenomenon might be due to the lower activity of Li2O in the molten ternary carbonates and the stronger interaction between CO2 and carbonate slow down the diffusion rate of CO2 in the melt. It seems that CaO was a stronger absorbent for CO2 in molten LiCl–KCl due to its faster absorption rate and higher conversion efficiency. The experimental results demonstrated that Li2O and CaO can serve as a good absorbent in molten salts so that it can act as a shuttle to maintain the MSCC-ET process given by eqn (1)–(4). It should be pointed out that the absorption behaviour of CO2 is affected by its partial pressure, temperature and the concentration of Li2O/CaO as well as the composition of molten salts. The curve shown in Fig. 1 is a boundary condition where no forced convention is involved.
To evaluate the electrochemical transformation behaviour of the captured CO2 (in the form of carbonate), cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted in molten Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3, 2 mol% Li2CO3–LiCl–KCl and 2 mol% CaCO3–LiCl–KCl under CO2 atmosphere at 450 °C with a Ni wire working electrode. As shown in Fig. 2, there are obvious reduction peaks before the deposition of alkali metal in the three kinds of electrolyte, suggesting the reduction of carbonate anion can take place before the decomposition of electrolyte. However, there exists some differences in the CV curves obtained in the three molten salts. From Fig. 2a, there is only one reduction peak at −2.1 V (vs. Ag+/Ag) before the cathodic limit in molten Li–Na–K carbonates, which could be ascribed to the reduction of CO32− to carbon with 4-electron transfer, as presented by eqn (1) and (2). However, there are two reduction peaks before the deposition of alkaline metals on the CVs in molten LiCl–KCl containing Li2CO3 as shown in Fig. 2b. The reduction of carbonate/CO2 in molten LiCl–KCl containing 2 mol% Li2CO3 occurred in the potential range from −1.2 to −2.2 V (vs. Ag+/Ag). Two reduction peaks were presented at −1.5 V and −1.9 V, respectively. The two-step electrochemical reduction might be caused by the quasi-reversible reduction of CO2 to a CO22− radical (eqn (8)) and followed by the reduction of chemically as-formed CO (eqn (9)) to carbon (eqn (10)).9,30 Also, it was reported that carbonate ions can be reduced in another two steps as represented by eqn (12) and (13),9 firstly reduced to CO22−, and CO22− was then reduced to carbon. First step: quasi reversible reduction: CO2 + 2e− = CO22−(8) Second step: chemical formation of CO: CO22− = CO + O2−(9) Third step: irreversible electro-reduction of CO to carbon: CO + 2e− = C + O2−(10) Overall reaction: 3CO2 + 4e− = C + 2CO32−(11) CO32− + 2e− = CO22− + O2−(12) CO22− + 2e− = C + 2O2−(13)

Solid line: cyclic voltammetry conducted in original molten mixture. Dashed line: cyclic voltammetry conducted after potentiostatic electrolysis at −2.2 V. 
In the salt of 2 mol% CaCO3–LiCl–KCl, a different CV profile was recorded for the first cycle as shown by the solid line in Fig. 2c. There is only one reduction peak in the potential range of −1.2 V to −0.8 V, and no carbon deposit was found by potentiostatic electrolysis using a nickel sheet electrode in the potential range. It is likely that the reduction peak is related to the reduction of the carbonate ion to CO on nickel electrode in the melt. It is different from that in Li2CO3 containing chloride melt, and also different from that in the CaCO3–CaCl2–LiCl–KCl melt with a high CaCO3 concentration in which a one-step reduction to carbon was proposed.28 However, a carbon deposit was obtained by electrolysis at a more negative potential (−2.2 V) in the melt. More interestingly, after that, two similar reduction peaks were found in 2 mol% CaCO3–LiCl–KCl (dashed line in Fig. 2c), the reduction peaks at −1.1 V and −1.4 V, respectively were more positive than that for Li2CO3 reduction. And then carbon deposit was found under potentiostatic electrolysis of −1.8 V. The possible reason might be the partial transformation of CaCO3 to Li2CO3 under the electrolysis condition, as the standard equilibrium constant for the reaction of 2LiCl(l) + CaCO3(l) = CaCl2(l) + Li2CO3(l) is only 2.97 × 10−3 at the temperature. The different CV behaviours demonstrate that the reduction of carbonate ion was very sensitive to the composition of molten salts as well as electrode materials, which remains to be investigated. Besides, it should be noted that a weak anodic peak was found at −0.3 V (vs. Ag+/Ag), which can be ascribed to the oxidation of deposited carbon on Ni wire working electrode by eqn (14) and/or eqn (15). By contrast, more intensive oxidation peaks were found in Li2CO3-containing molten salt as presented on Fig. 2a and b. This difference might be caused by poorer adherence for the deposited carbon and stronger evolution of formed CO in CaCO3-containing LiCl–KCl. C + 2CO32− = 3CO2 + 4e−(14) C + 2O2− = CO2 + 4e−(15)
Galvanostatic electrolysis was carried out in the three kinds of melts at a current density ranging from 25 mA cm−2 to 100 mA cm−2 by passing the same amount of electrical charge (2000 mA h). The cell voltage–time plots were recorded and displayed in Fig. 3. As can be seen, cell voltage in Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 was much lower than that in molten chlorides at either 25 mA cm−2 or 100 mA cm−2. The cell voltage for carbon deposition at 25 mA cm−2 was in the vicinity of 2.6 V for molten carbonates while it was nearly 3.2 V in carbonate-containing chlorides. It is noted that the cell voltage in CaCO3 containing system is slightly lower than that in Li2CO3 containing chloride. When the current density was increased to 100 mA cm−2, the voltage–time profile is quite different in the three salts as shown in Fig. 3b. The cell voltage in the ternary carbonates was low and gradually decreased with time, probably due to the decrease in real current density on the cathode. While the cell voltage profile in carbonate containing chlorides showed a sharp increase, followed by a gradual increase and then reached stability. These might be partially due to the concentration polarization of carbonate ion in the electrode/electrolyte interface. It is noted that the cell voltage in CaCO3 containing salt is 200–300 mV higher than that in Li2CO3-containing chlorides, due to the more complicated and sluggish reduction kinetics in the CaCO3 containing melt, consistent with its CV behaviour as shown in Fig. 2. The lowest cell voltage for CO2 reduction in Li–Na–K molten carbonates is beneficial to decrease the energy consumption of the process.

Current efficiency at different current density in the melts was calculated based on the mass of the carbon product and depicted in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the highest current efficiency of approximately 90% was obtained in the ternary carbonate melt, and the current efficiency decreased with increasing current density. Current efficiency in Li2CO3 containing chlorides is higher than that in chlorides with CaCO3. The efficiency is higher than 65% for all experimental conditions, which demonstrated that carbon is the preferential reduction product at the temperature in all electrolytes. Combing this with the cell voltage and current efficiency data, the energy consumption for electrolytic reduction of CO2 to carbon in ternary carbonates is the lowest.

The SEM images of carbon deposited in various molten salts at the same current density (50 mA cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen, carbon obtained in molten Li–Na–K carbonates consisted of highly aggregated nanoparticles of 50 nm to 100 nm in size. Meanwhile the morphology of carbon deposited in 2 mol% Li2CO3–LiCl–KCl was quite complex, including nanoparticles, quasi-spherical carbon as well as micron-sized carbon sheets. Likewise, similar morphology of the deposited carbon was found in 2 mol% CaCO3–LiCl–KCl, which mainly consisted of micron-sized carbon sheets and shell-like carbon, and a small quantity of nanoparticles was also observed. It is interesting that the morphology of deposited carbon is significantly influenced by the composition of the molten salts. The results inferred that the appearance of micron-sized carbon sheets is relevant to Li–K chlorides and electrolysis temperature, since no carbon sheet was found in molten LiCl–Li2CO3 at 650 °C.41 However, carbon particles with much smaller size were obtained in Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3, which might be ascribed to a much higher concentration of Li2CO3 in the ternary carbonates, compared with the quasi-spherical carbon in a size of 500–800 nm obtained in Li2CO3-containing molten halides.41,45 Possibly due to the template effect of chloride salts, carbon sheets were obtained in the melts at the experimental temperature. While the shell-like morphology observed in CaCO3 containing chlorides might be related to its special reduction mechanism, i.e., CO as an intermediate product.

The deposited carbon at 50 mA cm−2 in various molten salts was further studied by XRD as shown in Fig. 6a. They are amorphous as reported elsewhere23,37 since no obvious diffraction peak was found. Fig. 6b displays the Raman spectra of the carbon obtained in different salts. Two bands located at 1395 and 1592 cm−1 represent the characteristic disordered (D) and graphitic (G) planes of carbon material, respectively. The lower D band peak suggests the appearance of a low degree of structure defects in the carbon material. The ratio of intensity of D and G bands (ID/IG) for the carbon obtained in the three melts are shown in Table 3. It is around 0.7 for the carbon obtained from molten chlorides, but it is 0.86 for the carbon from the ternary carbonates. The low ID/IG indicates the relatively high degree graphitic structure in the as-prepared carbon in molten chlorides, this is related to the existence of carbon sheets as found in products obtained in carbonate-containing LiCl–KCl. Meanwhile there are more defects in the carbon obtained from molten carbonates under the experimental conditions, suggesting a highly activate surface carbon with a large amount of defects. The specific area and the porosity information of the products were further measured by N2 adsorption–desorption automatic analysis and calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the Barrett–Joyner–Halender (BJH) method, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 6c and d and Table 3. The porosity and the specific surface area of carbon deposited in Li–Na–K carbonates is much larger than that of carbon obtained in carbonate-containing LiCl–KCl. The BET area of carbon from molten carbonates is 897.4 m2 g−1, much higher than that from molten chlorides (113.9 and 157.9 m2 g−1, respectively). Also, its pore volume is much larger.

Fig. 7 and 8 present the electrochemical performances of the carbon obtained in different molten salts investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge tests, respectively using a carbon film electrode. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, CV plots for carbon obtained in Li–Na–K molten carbonates and CaCO3-containing LiCl–KCl were more rectangular, and the corresponding current density of the plateaus were larger than those of carbon deposited in Li2CO3-containing LiCl–KCl. Accordingly, the results of galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments also demonstrate the promising capacitive properties of carbon obtained in Li–Na–K molten carbonates with 240 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, while capacitance for carbon deposited in 2 mol% Li2CO3–LiCl–KCl and 2 mol% CaCO3–LiCl–KCl were 102 F g−1 and 145 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 8a). The results of capacitance measurement at 2 A g−1 of charge–discharge current density were 202 F g−1, 71 F g−1 and 110 F g−1 respectively as presented in Fig. 8b. This result suggests better electrochemical performance of deposited carbon can be obtained in Li–Na–K molten carbonates attributed to its higher surface area and porosity. Capacitive property of carbon obtained in CaCO3-containing LiCl–KCl seems to be more attractive than carbon deposited in Li2CO3-containing LiCl–KCl due to its higher surface area as shown on Table 3. Different morphology, structure and electrochemical performance for carbon obtained in molten salts with different composition may suggest a different application field for the relative products.

Prospects
For the continuous operation of the MSCC-ET process, it is expected that the kinetics of CO2 absorption and the diffusion of carbonate ion should be well matching with the electrochemical kinetics on the electrodes, just like industrial production of primary aluminium in which the dissolution of alumina should be well coupled with the electrode kinetics. Therefore, based on the absorption curve of CO2 as shown in Fig. 1, the CO2 transportation rate in molten salt was calculated and analysed according to damping-film theory.46 The relationship between absorbed CO2 and absorption time can be stated as follows: ln[(ne − n)/ne] = −Kt(16)where ne (mmol) denotes the uptake amount at absorption equilibrium and n (mmol) is the mole of absorbed CO2 at any time, which can be calculated by eqn (5). And K represents the reaction rate constant.

Fig. 9 shows the absorption rate of CO2 calculated by eqn (16) based on the data in Fig. 1. The slope of each curve represents the instant absorption rate of the melt. As can be seen, absorption rate of CO2 in CaO-containing LiCl–KCl was the fastest. Also it can be found that the curves in the three molten salts were pseudo-linear within the initial 300 seconds, suggesting a constant uptake rate during the first 5 minutes. Thus the apparent absorption rate of CO2 capture can be calculated by eqn (17) according to the results of CO2 absorption kinetics. The optimum coupling electrolysis is assumed when the electrochemical regeneration rate of oxygen ions (eqn (18)) equals the consumption rate of oxygen ions by CO2 absorption (eqn (20)). Following this idea, the suitable current density for electrolysis with 100% efficiency can be calculated by eqn (21) according a 4-electron transfer mechanism as shown by eqn (18). (17)n (mmol) – absorbed amount of CO2, m (g) – the weight of molten mixture, M (g mol−1) – the molar weight of molten mixture, t (h) – pseudo-linear absorption time. CO32− + 4e− = C + O2− (regeneration) + 2O2− (anodic-oxidation)(18) 2O2− (anodic-oxidation) = O2 + 4e−(19) O2− (consumption) + CO2 = CO32−(20) (21)F (C mol−1) – Faraday constant, S (cm2) – area of cathode.

As an example, Table 4 presents the calculated value of the electrolysis current density matching the static apparent absorption rate under the selected conditions based on a Ni cathode with an area of 24 cm2. As can be seen, the process rate of MSCC-ET in CaCO3-containing CaO–LiCl–KCl can be run above 239.5 mA cm−2 molsalt−1, followed by Li2CO3-containing Li2O–LiCl–KCl and Li2O-containing Li–Na–K molten carbonates, with 150.5 mA cm−2 molsalt−1 and 53.6 mA cm−2 molsalt−1, respectively. Although the data are not very accurate and are obtained under specific experimental conditions, it can provide some insights on the process. (1) The kinetics of CO2 capture and reduction in CaCO3-containing molten chlorides is more likely limited by electrochemical kinetics, which might be improved by applying strong electrochemical polarization within the electrochemical window; (2) the electrochemical kinetics in Li2CO3-containing salts is faster compared with the absorption kinetics, the process kinetics can be improved by increasing the concentration of Li2O and partial pressure of CO2 or temperature, and by stirring or bubbling the electrolyte. It was found in the authors' lab that the absorption rate can be accelerated by adding more Li2O into the melt.

Summary
The effect of the composition of molten salts on CO2 absorption and the electrochemical reduction process as well as the properties of the converted carbon at 450 °C was investigated. With the same mole amount of alkali/alkali earth oxide, CaO containing LiCl–KCl melt has the fastest absorption kinetics but the electrochemical kinetics in the melt is more sluggish and complicated. The electrochemical reduction in molten ternary carbonates is a one-step reduction process while it is a two-step process in Li2CO3 containing molten chlorides. For the constant current electrolysis in a two-electrode system, the cell voltage in the ternary carbonates is the lowest with highest current efficiency, demonstrating the best energy efficiency in molten carbonate. The morphology, density of structure defects, specific surface area as well as pore volume of the obtained carbon is also significantly influenced by electrolyte composition. Nano-carbon particles with a specific surface area of approximately 900 m2 g−1 and high ID/IG ratio (0.86) were obtained in the molten carbonates at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. While carbon sheets with a specific area of approximately 150 m2 g−1 and low ID/IG ratio (around 0.7) were obtained in carbonate containing molten chlorides, the cation also has some effect on the property of the products. The carbon obtained in Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 has a specific capacity of more than 200 F g−1 due to its higher surface area and porosity. The coupling kinetics between the absorption reaction and electrochemical transformation process was further discussed based on the measured absorption and electrode kinetics. However, the process kinetics are also affected by the concentration of absorbent, temperature, pressure as well as the convention conditions in the melt, which should be the subject of further investigation in future.
