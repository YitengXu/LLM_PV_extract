    , Accepted 28th March 2013First published on 2nd April 2013AbstractThe main obstacle for the practical application of common titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysts is that they can only absorb ultraviolet sunlight. Fluorite TiO2 has attracted considerable interest since it may utilize more abundant visible sunlight. However, its electronic properties have not yet been confirmed according to the previous theoretical investigations. In this study, density functional theory with different exchange–correlation functionals was employed to explore the electronic structure of fluorite TiO2 materials. Our results demonstrate that the perfect fluorite TiO2 crystals are indirect semiconductors. The size of supercells plays an important role for the calculation outcomes due to the Brillouin zone folding. The theoretical band gap energy of fluorite TiO2 using the hybrid DFT method is 2.31 eV, which supports its photocatalytic activity with visible light. The surrounding static electric fields of Ti cations of fluorite TiO2 are responsible for the reduced bang gap energies on the basis of crystal field theory. According to our theoretical deduction, possible visible-light responsive TiO2 photocatalysts were proposed by tuning the atomic configurations of the rutile TiO2 (110) surface.
1. Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysts have demonstrated capabilities to directly utilize solar energy to remediate the environment or to generate clean energies.1–4 Although notable progress has been achieved in recent years, the wide band gap energies of the common TiO2 polymorphs (>3.0 eV) limit their photoactivity to the ultraviolet (UV) region of the sunlight spectrum, which is just 5% of sunlight.5–6 To tune TiO2 into visible-light responsive materials, various band gap engineering approaches have been developed through chemical modifications, such as cation or anion doping,7 alloying,8 sensitization by organic dyes or inorganic quantum dots, and upconversion.3,9–11 These approaches have succeeded in reducing the band gap energies of TiO2 photocatalysts to realize visible-light photocatalytic activity, such as the nitrogen doped TiO2 materials.11–12 However, the energy conversion efficiencies of modified TiO2 photocatalysts are still too low for practical applications.3 One of the disadvantages of these chemical modification approaches lies on the fact that the modifiers can be the recombination or trapping centres for the photo-generated charge carriers.9 Therefore, synthesizing visible-light active TiO2 photocatalysts without any chemical modifications becomes attractive.13–15
TiO2 shows a rich phase diagram under wild or elevated pressures and temperatures, such as rutile, anatase, brookite, baddeleyite, fluorite, and cotunnite phases.16–17 Previous theoretical studies indicate that the pure fluorite-type TiO2 crystals may be visible-light active.16,18–20 Among all the properties of fluorite TiO2, its electronic structure is the key feature to determine their performance in photocatalysis or solar power generation applications. Unfortunately, the direct detection of their electronic properties is rather difficult in experiments since fluorite TiO2 materials can only be synthesized under high pressure (>48 GPa) around 2000 K.21 To explore the electronic structures of fluorite TiO2, some theoretical studies have been performed based on traditional density functional theory (DFT), quasi-particle approximation (GW) or the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method.16,18–20 However, the previous theoretical conclusions on its electronic properties are inconsistent. Kong et al., Mattesini et al., and Abbasnejad et al. found that fluorite TiO2 was an indirect semiconductor according to its band structure using the DFT, GW or QMC methods.18–20 Conversely, Kuo et al. proposed that the fluorite TiO2 was a direct semiconductor.16 Since the electronic structures are crucial in determining the photoactivity of TiO2 materials, a precise understanding of their electronic properties is thoroughly necessary.
In the previous theoretical studies on fluorite TiO2, the DFT method using local (local density approximation, LDA) or semi-local (general gradient approximation, GGA) exchange correlation (XC) functionals has been employed.16,19–20 These DFT calculations generally underestimate the band gap energies of semiconductors to an extent of 30%.22–25 While the GW and QMC methods used in the previous studies are more advanced technologies to get better electronic structures of materials, the current computational resource still limits their application.18–19,26 An alternative to deal with these issues in a first-principle manner is the hybrid DFT method, in which a component of non-local Hartree–Fock exchange is included into the XC functional.27–28 In this work, we employed the recently developed screened hybrid functionals in periodic systems to examine the electronic structures of fluorite TiO2 materials.27 Our calculations demonstrate that they are indirect semiconductors with visible-light activity. The orientation of the Ti 3d orbitals of the fluorite TiO2 in their surrounding static electric fields plays the key role in reducing their band gap energy.
2. Computation methods
All calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP) based on DFT with the all-electron projected augmented wave (PAW) method in this study.29–31 A plane-wave basis set was employed with a kinetic energy cut-off of 400 eV. Valence states included the Ti 3p, 4s, and 3d states, and the O 2s and 2p states. We used the PBE32 and HSE06 XC functional33 for the GGA-level and screened hybrid DFT-level calculations, respectively. The screening parameter for exchange of the HSE06 functional was 0.2 Å−1.34 An exchange functional of 20% exact HF exchange with 80% PBE exchange was employed in this study since calculations with such a ratio accurately predicted the lattice constants and the band gap for rutile and anatase TiO2 materials.35–36
To understand the origin of the visible-light activity of fluorite TiO2, the structural and electronic properties of rutile, anatase and fluorite TiO2 polymorphs were calculated and compared. We performed Brillouin-zone (BZ) integrations using Monkhorst–Pack grids of special points with (4 × 4 × 6), (6 × 6 × 2) and (6 × 6 × 6) meshes for rutile, anatase and fluorite TiO2 supercells, respectively. Each supercell of rutile TiO2 includes 6 atoms while each anatase or fluorite supercell has 12 atoms, as shown in the black frames of Fig. 1A–C. The rutile (110) surface atoms were engineered to form fluorite-type structures in this study because this surface is the most well studied one. The rutile (110) surface was modelled by a slab with the (1 × 1) surface cell comprising 18 atomic layers separated by a vacuum region of 10 Å. A (4 × 6 × 1) k-point mesh was used in this study. The reconstruction occurs in one surface of the slabs. When the geometry was optimized, all the atoms were allowed to relax. The corresponding k-mesh densities and the cut-off kinetic energy have been justified in our previous studies.38–40 The other calculation parameters for the hybrid DFT calculations have been validated below through comparison with the experimental values.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Rutile and anatase
To validate the calculation parameters for the hybrid DFT calculations in this study, we have calculated the structural and electronic properties of rutile and anatase TiO2 crystals first. Rutile and anatase are the most common polymorphs of TiO2 in nature and practical applications. The theoretical lattice constants and band gap energies are listed in Table 1, along with the experimental data.16,37 It can be found that the theoretical lattice constants calculated both with the PBE and HSE06 functionals are very close to the experimental values. The biggest discrepancy is less than 0.1 Å. However, the band gap energies of rutile and anatase materials using the PBE functional are about 40% lower than the corresponding experimental values (3.00–3.40 eV).41–44 Using the HSE06 XC functional, the theoretical bang gap energies are 3.08 and 3.34 eV for rutile and anatase TiO2, respectively. The significant improvement through the hybrid DFT calculations confirms the advantage of this method employed in this study. The images of density of states (DOS) of rutile and anatase TiO2 materials are also shown in Fig. 1D–E, which will be compared with that of the fluorite TiO2. Our results are similar to those using the same level computational methods,35–36,45 which demonstrates that the calculation parameters used in this study are valid.

3.2 Structural and electronic properties of fluorite TiO2
Compared with rutile and anatase TiO2, the fluorite-type crystals show higher symmetry. The atomic structure of fluorite TiO2 crystals belongs to the cubic Fm3m space group, as shown in Fig. 1C.21 After the structure optimization, the theoretical lattice constants are 4.833 and 4.786 Å for the PBE and HSE06 functionals, respectively (see Table 1). Our results are in agreement with previous theoretical values, but slightly less than the experimental data.16,18–21 It should be noted that the experimental data was not directly measured since fluorite TiO2 can only be stable at high pressure and high temperature.21 The experimental lattice constant was extrapolated according to the lattice constants measured under 10–55 Gpa pressure.21 Thus, the theory–experiment discrepancy may not be fully ascribed to the computation accuracy. According to our PBE results, the average volume per TiO2 unit in fluorite crystals is 28.2 Å3, which is at least 13.3% smaller than those in rutile and anatase crystals. It matches the experiments, in that the fluorite phase can only be produced under the high pressure.21
From Table 1, the theoretical band gap energy with the PBE functional is 1.10 eV, which is 1.21 eV lower than that with the HSE06 functional. Our PBE value is close to the previous ones obtained using the same level functionals.16,20 And the band gap energy obtained through the screened hybrid DFT method is similar to that using the GW (2.37 eV)19 or QMC (2.44 eV)18 methods. Since the computation costs of the screened hybrid DFT method are much less than those of the GW and QMC methods, the great advantage of the screened hybrid DFT method used in this study is shown.
On the basis of our calculations, the band gap energy of fluorite TiO2 is about 1.0 eV lower than that of the rutile and anatase phases. The reduced band gap energy of fluorite TiO2 is mainly due to the change in the surrounding chemical environments of Ti atoms.16 In rutile and anatase TiO2 crystals, the coordination number (CN) of the Ti atoms is six through the formation of a [TiO6] octahedra with the D2h symmetry. In fluorite crystals, the CN of the Ti atoms is eight in the perfect [TiO8] cubes with the Oh symmetry (see Fig. 2). According to crystal field theory, the five degenerate Ti 3d orbitals split into t2g and eg orbitals by the interactions between the Ti 3d electrons and their static electric fields generated by the surrounding O anions. In the [TiO8] cubes, the Ti 3d t2g orbitals point to the edge of the cubes (the green squares in Fig. 2A), and the Ti 3d eg orbitals point to the face centres of the cubes (the black squares in Fig. 2A). As a result, the shorter distances from the Ti 3d eg orbitals to the oxygen atoms (0.5dO–O, and the dO–O is the shortest O–O distance in crystals) leads to a stronger repulsion between the electrons in the Ti 3d t2g orbitals and the surrounding O anions. Such repulsion means that the energy levels of the Ti 3d t2g orbitals are lower than those of eg orbitals.16,20 The partial DOS (PDOS) images of Ti and O atoms in fluorite TiO2 have been calculated with different functionals, as shown in Fig. 3. The PDOS images confirm the order of conduction bands in fluorite TiO2 according to the deduction of crystal field theory.

On the other hand, the symmetry of the [TiO6] octahedra in rutile and anatase TiO2 is different from that of the [TiO8] cubes. The distances from the Ti 3d eg orbitals in the [TiO6] octahedra are shorter since they point to the edge of the [TiO6] octahedra (the black squares in Fig. 2B). Thus, the energy levels of the Ti 3d t2g bands in the rutile and anatase TiO2 are lower than those of eg bands. Such electronic structure is reverse to that in the fluorite TiO2.16,20 In addition, the distance from the Ti 3d t2g orbitals to O anions is 0.577dO–O in the [TiO6] octahedra, which is shorter than that in the [TiO8] cubes (0.707dO–O). As a result, the Ti 3d eg bands in the [TiO8] cubes shift towards the Fermi energy level because of the relatively weak repulsion between the electrons in Ti 3d eg and O anions (see Fig. 1). The band gap energy of fluorite TiO2, therefore, reduces. The theoretical band gap energy (2.31 eV) of the fluorite TiO2 supports that they can absorb visible sunlight with a wavelength less than 537 nm.
3.3 Comparison between different functionals
The data in Table 1 show that the calculations both with the PBE and HSE06 functionals can give accurate structural properties of TiO2 materials. The crucial improvement using the screened hybrid DFT method is the band gap energies of the systems.
Comparing the DOS images in Fig. 1 and 3, it can be found that the position of the conduction bands, using the GGA/DFT methods is about 1.0 eV lower than that of the screened hybrid DFT method, which leads to the underestimation of the band gap energies of all TiO2 materials. This discrepant value (∼1.0 eV) has been used in GGA/DFT calculations to adjust the band gap energies while it is totally empirical.16 Another differentia related to the functionals is the width of the bands. According to our calculations, the widths of bands with the PBE functional are smaller than their counterparts with the HSE06 functional. One example is that the width of the upper valence band is 7.4 eV with the PBE functional for the fluorite TiO2, which is about 0.7 eV smaller than that with the HSE06 functional. From Fig. 3, the Ti 3d t2g band width with the HSE06 functional is almost twice that using the PBE functional. However, the DOS images in Fig. 1 and 3 also indicate that the order and shapes of the various bands of TiO2 are similar. Such similarities suggest that we may still use the GGA/DFT methods, which can reduce computation costs significantly to study more complicated systems, to approximately analyze the electronic properties of TiO2 materials.
3.4 Nature of electronic structure
The main discrepancy of previous theoretical studies is whether fluorite TiO2 materials are direct semiconductors or not. Kong et al., Mattesini et al. and Abbasnejad et al. have proposed that fluorite TiO2 is an indirect semiconductor. The indirect transition is from the conduction band minimum (CBM) at the Γ point to the valence band maximum (VBM) at X as the minimum band gap.18–20 On the contrary, Kuo et al. found that fluorite TiO2 is a direct semiconductor with the minimum band gap at the Γ symmetry point based on their GGA/DFT calculations.16 Since the hybrid DFT calculation can improve the prediction of band gap energies compared to those using the GW and QMC methods, the calculations using the hybrid DFT calculations are expected to repeat the conclusion using the GW or QMC methods. In this regard, we have calculated the band structure of fluorite TiO2 from the Γ point to the X point using both traditional DFT and screened hybrid DFT approaches, as shown in Fig. 4A–B.
 Fig. 4  Band structures of fluorite TiO2 crystals from Γ to X symmetric points with (A) the PBE and (B) the HSE06 functional. Band structures from W-L-Γ-X-W-K of fluorite TiO2 crystals with (C) a conventional unit cell including four Ti atoms and eight O atoms, or (D) a primitive cell (it includes one Ti atom and two O atoms) using the PBE functional. 
Unfortunately, the results suggest that the nature of band structures is independent of the choice of the functionals. The fluorite TiO2 is a direct semiconductor with the minimum band gap at the Γ symmetry point both with the PBE and the HSE06 functionals. There must be another factor causing the discrepancy found in the previous studies.
The previous studies on the anatase TiO2 revealed that the size of supercells in calculations may affect the band structures.45 Considering the computational costs of the GW and QMC methods are very high, the primitive cell of the fluorite TiO2 crystal may be used in those calculations. The primitive cell of the fluorite TiO2 includes one Ti atom and two O atoms, whose size is one quarter of that of the conventional unit cell used in this study before. Based on this consideration, the band structures of the systems with primitive or conventional supercells were calculated using the PBE functional (see Fig. 4C–D). When the primitive cell was employed, the band structure shows that the fluorite TiO2 is an indirect semiconductor, which is same as those reported by Kong et al., Mattesini et al. and Abbasnejad et al.18–20 However, the system changes into a direct semiconductor when the bigger conventional supercell including four Ti atoms and eight O atoms was used. Thus, the size of supercells affects the band structures of fluorite TiO2. The size effect can be ascribed to the folding of the BZ.46 Since the conventional supercell is larger than the primitive one, the first BZ of the conventional supercell is smaller. Consequently, the VBM at the X point in the first BZ of the primitive supercell is folded back onto the Γ symmetry point in the first BZ of the conventional supercell, which causes the nature of the band structure of fluorite TiO2 materials to changes. Since the band structures using the primitive supercell describe the correct electronic properties of the systems, fluorite TiO2 is, therefore, demonstrated to be an indirect semiconductor.
3.5 Reconstructed surfaces with [TiO8]
Since the change of the static electric fields of Ti cations can tune the band gap of TiO2 into visible-light activity, engineering the surface structures to form highly symmetric [TiO8] becomes a possible approach to avoid the high pressure required by the formation of the fluorite TiO2 bulk. To verify this theoretical deduction, the stable rutile TiO2 (110) surface was deliberately reconstructed to form [TiO8] in the surface. Two three-coordinated O atoms in the rutile TiO2 (110) surface were shifted half of a unit vector length along the <001> direction to generate [TiO8] cubes, as shown in Fig. 5A–B. After the atomic optimization, the [TiO8] in the surface do not have perfect Oh symmetry, but very close to it. Such atomic structures can lead to the same electronic structure as that of the fluorite TiO2 since the static electric fields of Ti cations in both systems are similar. As a result, the similar visible-light activity can be expected.

Key: red - oxygen, blue - titanium. 
The total DOS (TDOS) images shown in Fig. 5C demonstrate that the CBM of the reconstructed surface indeed shifts towards the Fermi energy level. The location of the CBM is close to that of the fluorite TiO2 crystal. The further PDOS analysis of the Ti atoms in the reconstructed surface (see the magenta line in Fig. 5D) reveals that the shift of the CBM is ascribed to the formation of the eight-coordinated surface Ti atoms in [TiO8]. As a comparison, the CBM of the PDOS of the six-coordinated Ti atoms in the bulk (the orange line in Fig. 5D) locates at a similar position to those of bulk rutile. The shift of the CBM of the reconstructed surface demonstrates that the visible-light response of the bare TiO2 photocatalyst can be achieved through surface engineering to change the static electric fields of Ti cations in the surface. Recently, Etacheri et al. found that the oxygen-rich anatase TiO2 surfaces possess visible-light activity.14 At the same time, the reconstructed rutile (011) surface under the oxidizing condition was also found to be visible-light active without any doping.13 Such uncommon visible-light response may also be explained by the formation of [TiO8] cubes under the oxygen-rich conditions. The recent experiments to use the hydrofluoric acid as a facet controlling agent to produce a high-energy anatase (001) surface can be used as a model to synthesize visible-light active surfaces with [TiO8] cubes.40,47–48
4. Conclusions
In this study, we have studied the rutile, anatase and fluorite TiO2 crystals using both the GGA/DFT and the screened hybrid DFT methods. The employment of the screened hybrid DFT method improves the prediction of the band gap energies of TiO2 photocatalysts significantly. The theoretical values with the HSE06 functional are almost identical to the experimental values. Through our calculations, the fluorite TiO2 materials have been confirmed to be indirect semiconductors with a minimum band gap from the CBM at the Γ point to the VBM at the X point. A band gap energy as low as 2.31 eV supports the prediction that the fluorite TiO2 phase is visible-light active. Such visible-light response is related to the structural change of TiO2 by the formation of [TiO8] cubes. The change in the static electric fields of Ti cations can tune the band gap energies of TiO2 on the basis of crystal field theory. To this end, TiO2 photocatalysts with [TiO8] cubes in the surfaces are proposed to be visible-light active, which were theoretically confirmed in this study. Thus, surface engineering of TiO2 is a doable approach to achieve their visible-light activity without any doping.
