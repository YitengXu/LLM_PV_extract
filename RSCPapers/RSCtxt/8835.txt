X-ray diffraction analyses and transmission electron microscope observations evidenced that the phase, size and shape of NaYb1−xGdxF4nanocrystals were closely related to the Gd3+ content. Particularly, when the Gd3+ content reached 60 mol%, the final products were highly uniform and monodisperse hexagonal NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4nanorods. By doping appropriate lanthanide activators, these nanorods exhibited efficient dual-sensitizing multicolor emissions, i.e., Gd3+ sensitizing down-conversion by an ultraviolet light excitation orYb3+ sensitizing up-conversion by a near-infrared one. The lanthanide activator doped NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4nanorods with tunable up-conversion luminescence and proper paramagnetism originating from Gd3+ ions may find potential applications in bio-probes and magnetic resonance imaging.
1 Introduction
During the past decades, rare earth (RE) compounds, such as oxides, phosphates, vanadates, fluorides, and chlorides, have become a new focus of research due to their unique properties arising from the 4f electron configuration and potential applications in ultraviolet absorbents, solid-state lasers, optical amplifiers, displays, solar cells as well as bio-labels.1–11 Among them, sodium rare earth fluorides (NaREF4) have been considered as excellent hosts for various optically active lanthanide (Ln3+) ions since they possess a high refractive index and low phonon energy (<400 cm−1) leading to low non-radiative relaxation probability and consequently high luminescence efficiency of Ln3+ ions.12–14 As is well known, NaREF4 exists in two phase structures, i.e., cubic (α) and hexagonal (β), and a phase transition from cubic to hexagonal will induce great intensification of the up-conversion (UC) emissions. Particularly, the hexagonal NaYF4 offers an order-of-magnitude enhancement of UC efficiency compared to its cubic counterpart, and is regarded as the most efficient green and blue UC host.15–19 So far, great efforts have been devoted to study the phase, size and optical properties of the Ln3+ doped NaYF4 nanocrystals (NCs).20–27
Recently, Ln3+ doped NaYbF4 nano- and micro-crystals were demonstrated to exhibit intense multicolor, such as ultraviolet, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, pink as well as near-infrared (NIR), UC luminescence under a single NIR (980 nm) laser irradiation benefited from the high Yb3+ content in the host.28–33 On the other hand, NaGdF4 NCs are known to be an efficient host for the multicolor down-conversion (DC) luminescence of Ln3+ ions under single ultraviolet (UV) light excitation, where Gd3+ acts as an intermediate to allow energy migration over the Gd3+ sub-lattice and finally transferring to the activators.34–37 Herein, we report the successful preparation of Ln3+ activator-doped NaYb1−xGdxF4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanocrystals with dual-sensitizing luminescence (Gd3+ sensitizing DC orYb3+ sensitizing UC emissions) and paramagnetic properties originating from Gd3+ ions by a modified liquid–solid–solution solvothermal route for the first time. The impact of Gd3+ content on the phase structure, size and shape of the NaYb1−xGdxF4 NCs was systematically investigated.
2 Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout. Ln(NO3)3·6H2O (Ln = La–Yb), oleic acid, NaOH, NH4F, cyclohexane and ethanol were all supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company.
Synthesis of nanocrystals
In a typical synthesis of NaYb1−xGdxF4 NCs, an aqueous solution (3.5 ml) of Yb(NO3)3 and Gd(NO3)3 (total 0.4 mmol) was mixed with ethanol (5 mL), oleic acid (5 mL) and NaOH (0.3 g) under thorough stirring. Then, 1 mL NH4F (2 mmol) solution was dropwise added to the mixture. After vigorous stirring at room temperature for about 30 min, the colloidal solution were transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 130–230 °C for 12 h. The final products were collected, washed several times with ethanol/cyclohexane, and purified by centrifugation. The Ln3+ ions (such as Eu3+, Tb3+, Ce3+/Eu3+, Ce3+/Tb3+, Ce3+/Eu3+/Tb3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+, and Er3+/Tm3+) doped NaYb1−xGdxF4 NCs were prepared by adding the corresponding metal salts with designed concentrations to the reaction system.
Characterization

XRD analysis was carried out with a powder diffractometer (DMAX2500 RIGAKU) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The size and shape of the samples were observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS). TEM specimens were prepared by directly drying a drop of a dilute cyclohexane dispersion solution of the products on the surface of a carbon-coated copper grid. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer IR spectrometer using the KBr pellet technique. The DC or UC emission spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a xenon lamp (450 W) or an adjustable laser diode (975 nm) as the excitation source. To enable comparison of the emission intensities among different samples, the emission spectra were measured with the same instrumental parameters (for example: same mass of samples, same excitation wavelength and power, same excitation and emission slits, and so on). The room temperature and low temperature (2 K) magnetization as a function of the applied magnetic field ranging from −80 to 80 KOe was measured using a Quantum Design PPMS-7 magnetometer.
3 Results and discussion
Similar to the well known NaYF4, NaYbF4 exists either in cubic α-phase or in hexagonal β-phase. XRD patterns of NaYbF4 NCs synthesized at various temperatures are presented in Fig. 1. When the temperature is relatively low (i.e., 130 °C), only pure α-NaYbF4 NCs are obtained after 12 h reaction. As the temperature reaches 180 °C, a small amount of β-NaYbF4 is observed together with the α-NaYbF4 NCs. With temperature further increasing to 230 °C, the quantity of β-NaYbF4 increases significantly. Unfortunately, pure β-phase could not be fabricated under the present synthesis conditions.

          XRD patterns of NaYbF4 NCs prepared at various temperatures: (a) 130 °C, (b) 180 °C, and (c) 230 °C. The bars represent standard cubic α-NaYbF4 (JCPDS 77-2043) and hexagonal β-NaYbF4 (JCPDS 27-1427) data. 
With the addition of Gd3+ ions to NaYbF4 NCs, the situation is dramatically altered. As exhibited in XRD patterns of NaYb1−xGdxF4 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) NCs prepared at 130 °C shown in Fig. 2, with increase of Gd3+ content the product transforms from the cubic phase to the hexagonal one, and pure β-NaYb1−xGdxF4 is achieved as the Gd3+ content reaches 40 mol%. With further increase in Gd3+ content, no extra diffraction peaks are observed, indicating the formation of a homogeneous β-NaYb1−xGdxF4 solid solution. The sequential shifting of XRD peaks towards the low-angle side with increasing Gd3+ content is due to the substitution of Yb3+ (0.101 nm) by the larger Gd3+ (0.108 nm). Interestingly, it is also observed that the diffraction peaks of β-NaYb1−xGdxF4 tend to be broadened with increasing Gd3+ content, suggesting a reduction in their mean grain size.

TEM observations on the synthesized samples are presented in Fig. 3. TEM micrograph and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3a) of the pure sample (x = 0) demonstrate the near-cubic-shaped NaYbF4 NCs with cubic structure. With the addition of 20 mol% Gd3+, two distinct particle morphologies that include small nanocubes and large hexagonal plates (Fig. 3b) are observed, in good agreement with the XRD result of the mixed cubic and hexagonal phases (Fig. 2). In the presence of 40 mol% Gd3+, the NaYb1−xGdxF4 product is uniform nanorods of pure hexagonal structure (Fig. 3c). Upon further increasing the Gd3+ content, the size of β-NaYb1−xGdxF4 reduces obviously while their shape tends to be irregular (Fig. 3d–f). The detailed lattice structures of the cubic NaYbF4 nanocrystal and the hexagonal NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4nanorod are revealed by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images shown in the insets of Fig. 3a and Fig. 3d. Evidently, the EDS spectrum taken from the NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4nanorods (inset of Fig. 3d) verifies that the Yb/Gd content ratio is close to 2/3.

As shown in Fig. 4, there are several vibration bands in the FT-IR spectrum of the NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4nanorods. Those at 1350–1700 cm−1 and 2800–3050 cm−1 are assigned respectively to the vibrations of CO and CH2 groups in the oleic acid molecule,8 while the broad band around 3450 cm−1 is ascribed to the O–H stretching vibrations originated from oleic acid and water.9 These results evidence the existence of capping ligands on the NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4 surfaces.

Adopting the same experimental procedure, other lanthanide ion (60 mol%) doped NC samples (NaYb0.4Ln0.6F4, Ln = Tm–La) were prepared, and the impact of the lanthanide element on the phase structure of the product was investigated based on the XRD results presented in Fig. 5. Interestingly, according to the radius of the doped lanthanide ion, the synthesized NCs are divided into three groups. For Tm, Er, and Ho with small ionic radii (group I), the products are a mixture of cubic and hexagonal phases, and the quantity of hexagonal NCs increases with increasing lanthanide ionic radius; for Dy, Tb, Gd, Eu, Sm, Nd, and Pr with intermediate ionic radii (group II), the product is pure hexagonal phase, and the NC size decreases monotonously with increasing lanthanide ionic radius; for Ce and La with relatively large ionic radii (group III), the dominant product is hexagonal REF3 (RE = Ce or La) NCs.

          XRD patterns of NaYbF4 (a) and NaYb0.4Ln0.6F4 NCs with Ln = Tm (b), Er (c), Ho (d), Dy (e), Tb (f), Gd (g), Eu (h), Sm (i), Nd (j), Pr (k), Ce (l), and La (m) synthesized at 130 °C. 
As a comparison, pure NaLnF4 (Ln = Tm–Pr) NCs were synthesized under the same experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, for the Ln3+ ions with smaller ionic radii such as Tm, Er, and Ho, the synthesized NaTmF4, NaErF4 and NaHoF4 NCs are mixtures of cubic and hexagonal phases, and the quantity of hexagonal phase increases with increasing lanthanide ionic radius; for Ln3+ ions with larger ionic radii such as Dy, Tb, Gd, Eu, Sm, Nd, and Pr, the products are pure hexagonal phases. This ionic radius-dependent growth behavior of NaLnF4 NCs might be ascribed to the inference that a lanthanide ion with a larger radius has a lower energy barrier to form the hexagonal phase,12,26 which could also be the reason for the cubic to hexagonal phase transition of NaYbF4 when some Yb3+ ions are substituted by the other lanthanide ions (such as Gd3+) with larger radii.

In addition, from the XRD results shown in Fig. 6, it is found that the size of the hexagonal NaLnF4 NCs decreases with increasing Ln3+ radius, which is further evidenced by the TEM observations presented in Fig. 7. This phenomenon might be explained by the hypothesis proposed recently by Liu et al.27 based on the first principle calculations that the larger the Ln3+ radius, the higher the electron charge density on the surface of NaLnF4 NCs: when NaLnF4 NCs with Ln3+ having larger radius, the increased surface electron charge density hinders the diffusion of the negative F− ions needed for crystal growth from the solution to the crystal as a result of the charge repulsion, consequently resulting in retardation of the nanocrystal growth. Naturally, the gradual size reduction of NaYb0.4Ln0.6F4 with expansion of Ln3+ radius and NaYb1−xGdxF4 with increasing Gd3+ content (x) is attributable to the same reason.

It is known that the point symmetry of the Ln3+ ion in the α-NaLnF4 lattice is Oh (centric symmetry) while it is C3h (acentric symmetry) in β-NaLnF4.15 To study the influence of phase structure on the optical properties, 0.5 mol% Eu3+ (acting as the structure probe) doped NaYb1−xGdxF4 NCs were prepared and their photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation (PLE) spectra were recorded, as shown in Fig. 8. In PLE spectra, besides the routine Eu3+ excitation bands, a 272 nm excitation peak originating from the Gd3+: 8S7/2 → 6IJ transition is detected for the Eu3+ doped β-NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4 or β-NaGdF4 NCs, indicating the existence of efficient energy transfer from Gd3+ to Eu3+. Obviously, the emission intensity of Eu3+ in β-NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4 or β-NaGdF4 is far higher than that in α-NaYbF4 ascribed to both the favorable crystalline structure and the large size of the β-phase.38 Evidently, the 5D0 → 7F2/5D0 → 7F1 intensity ratio increases after phase transition from cubic to hexagonal, which is due to the symmetry decrease of the Eu3+ ligand field.39,40 Note that, because of the large energy mismatch (∼2500 cm−1) between the 5D0 → 7F6 transition of Eu3+ and the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition of Yb3+, the cross-relaxation between Eu3+ and Yb3+ as well as its effect on the Eu emission spectra are negligible.

To demonstrate the color-tunable DC luminescence, the PLE and PL spectra of Ce3+/Tb3+, Ce3+/Eu3+, and Ce3+/Tb3+/Eu3+ doped NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4 NCs were recorded, as shown in Fig. 9. In PLE spectra of the Ce3+/Tb3+ and Ce3+/Eu3+ co-doped samples, besides the Tb3+: and Eu3+: 4f → 4f absorption transitions, there are a broad band at 254 nm and a sharp line at 272 nm ascribing to the Ce3+: 4f → 5d and Gd3+: 8S7/2 → 6IJ transitions. These results indicate that the energy transfer proceeds via the Ce3+→(Gd3+)n → Ln3+ (Ln = Tb or Eu) process where the Gd3+ ion acts as the intermediate, as shown in Fig. 9d, similar to the case of the Ce3+/Ln3+ co-doped GdF3 nanocrystals reported previously.41 Due to strong absorption around 254 nm resulting from the allowed 4f–5d transition of Ce3+, the Ln3+: NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4 NCs exhibit intense DC emissions of Tb3+: and Eu3+: 4f → 4f transitions under UV irradiation, and their luminescent colors can be easily tuned by changing the Tb3+ content and the Tb3+/Eu3+ content ratio (Fig. 9b, c, e). It is worth mentioning that the converse variation trends for the UV-blue emissions and the green ones with increasing Tb3+ content are ascribed to the cross-relaxation of 5D3 + 7F6 → 5D4 + 7F0 between Tb3+ ions.

Similarly, the tuning of UC luminescence color can be achieved through single doping Ho3+, Er3+ or Tm3+ in the NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4 NCs with the help of the sensitizer Yb3+, as shown in Fig. 10a–c. The 0.5 mol% Ho3+ or Er3+ doped NCs yield apparent green or yellow light due to the different combination of green (Ho3+: 4S2, 5F4 → 5I8 or Er3+: 2H11/2,4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and red (Ho3+: 5F5 → 5I8 or Er3+: 4F9/2 → 4I15/2) emissions. The 0.5 mol% Tm3+ doped NCs exhibit blue luminescence resulting from the integrated emissions of Tm3+: 1I6 → 3H6 (UV), 1I6 → 3F4 (UV), 1D2 → 3H6 (UV), 1D2 → 3F4 (blue), 1G4 → 3H6 (blue), 3F2,3 → 3H6 (red) and 3H4 → 3H6 (NIR). In addition, a UV emission corresponding to the Gd3+: 6P7/2 → 8S7/2 transition is also detected. Based on energy matching conditions,13 the possible energy transfer processes from Yb3+ to Ho3+, Er3+ or Tm3+ are depicted in Fig. 11. The excitation of Gd3+ is achieved by energy transfer from Tm3+: 3PJ to Gd3+: 6IJ followed by non-radiative relaxation to Gd3+: 6PJ.42,43 Interestingly, the NIR (∼800 nm) luminescence corresponding to the Tm3+: 3H4 → 3H6 transition is dominant in the emission spectrum of the 3.0 mol% Tm3+ doped NCs, benefiting from the 1G4 + 3F4 → 3F2 + 3H4 cross relaxation.10 In a further set of experiments, it is demonstrated that the multicolor fine-tuning of UC in the visible region can also be achieved via co-doping Er3+/Tm3+ into NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4 NCs, as presented in Fig. 10d. Appropriate modification of the Er3+ content in the range of 0.1–0.8 mol% leads to a prominent change in the green and red emission intensities. As a consequence, the combination of red, green and blue emissions results in multicolor luminescence from cyan to green including white, as shown in Fig. 10e.

Apart from UC luminescence, the Ln3+: NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4nanorods exhibit paramagnetism at room temperature (Fig. 12a), originating from the intrinsic magnetic moment of Gd3+ with non-interacting and localized nature.44–47 The magnetization of the nanocrystals at 20 KOe is around 1.5 emu/g, close to the reported value of the nanoparticles used for common bio-separation.48,49 At low temperature (2 K), these nanorods exhibit superparamagnetism with a saturation magnetization value of 90 emu/g (Fig. 12b). Hopefully, the Ln3+: NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4nanorods with tunable UC luminescence and proper paramagnetism may find potential applications in bio-probe and magnetic resonance imaging after further converting them into hydrophilic ones by a ligand exchange treatment.50–52

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully prepared NaYb1−xGdxF4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanocrystals by a facile solvothermal method for the first time. It was interestingly found that the addition of Gd3+ into NaYbF4 nanocrystals prompted the phase conversion from cubic to hexagonal, and the mean size of hexagonal nanocrystals was monotonously reduced with increasing Gd3+ content. Further experiments evidenced that the addition of other lanthanide ions with radius larger than Yb3+ has a similar effect as that of Gd3+. Importantly, by doping appropriate active lanthanide ions into the monodisperse NaYb0.4Gd0.6F4nanorods, they exhibited multi-functionality, i.e., tunable down- and up-conversion emissions as well as proper paramagnetism.
