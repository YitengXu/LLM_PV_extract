    , Accepted 12th September 2018First published on 14th September 2018AbstractOrganic electrode materials are promising for electrochemical energy storage devices because they have a high theoretical capacity, structural diversity, and flexibility. In addition, they are light weight, inexpensive, and environmentally benign. Organic electrode materials are a promising alternative to conventional inorganic materials. Various organic materials, such as conducting polymers, organodisulfides, nitroxyl radical polymers, and conjugated carbonyl compounds, have been studied as electrode materials for lithium batteries. Among them, small organic carbonyl compounds and polymers containing carbonyls have been widely studied as electrode materials because of their high theoretical capacity, fast redox kinetics, and structural diversity. However, these materials have intrinsic drawbacks, such as solubility in electrolyte media and a low conductivity. Herein, methods to solve these problems by increasing the polarity are discussed. The polarity of small molecules could be increased by forming salts. In addition, the conductivity could be enhanced using a chemical doping strategy or forming a composite with a conductive additive. This review provides guidance for the design of a new type of organic material for next-generation rechargeable batteries.Manik E. BhosaleManik E.

1. Introduction
The global demand for energy has continuously increased because of an increase in the world population and improvement in the standard of living in developing countries. Technological advances, such as portable electronics and electric vehicles, have also increased the energy demand. The majority of this energy is provided by fossil fuels, such as oil, coal, and natural gas, although the availability of such fuels is decreasing. In addition, the overconsumption of fossil fuels may lead to environmental issues. Gases emitted by burning fossil fuels, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and carbon dioxide, have contributed to global warming and acid rain.1 Thus, two major challenges of the 21st century are meeting growing energy demands and solving environmental problems. Overcoming these challenges requires clean and efficient renewable energy sources, such as solar power, wave power, and wind power.2 As solar and wind energy cannot be obtained on demand, appropriate energy storage devices are required to optimally use these renewable energy sources. However, the demand and consumption of electricity are constant because small fluctuations in power supply can cause interruptions that cost tens of billions of dollars per year.
The transportation sector is a major consumer of fossil fuels and carries a major responsibility for global warming. Currently, a technology that could completely replace the internal combustion engine is unavailable. Electric vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles offer potential to minimize the consumption of fossil fuels, thereby reducing global warming by replacing combustion engines in the transportation sector. However, such applications require a high energy density, a high power density, a long cycle life, and safe systems.3 The development of rechargeable batteries began in 1859 when Gaston Pante, a French physicist, invented lead–acid batteries.4 Subsequently, rechargeable nickel–cadmium and nickel–metal hydride batteries emerged as alternatives for lead–acid batteries. In the 1970s, the first rechargeable lithium batteries were used in military applications, although these applications failed owing to safety concerns. In 1983, Yoshino proposed an operational model of a rechargeable lithium-ion battery (LIB) that contained polyacetylene as the anode and LiCoO2 as the cathode. Al foil was used as the cathode current collector, and Cu foil was used as the anode current collector.
After numerous pioneering studies, Sony commercialized the LIB in 1991.5Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the energy densities of these rechargeable batteries.6 Owing to their higher energy density and better cyclability than other rechargeable batteries, LIBs have attracted significant attention for use in various applications ranging from portable electronics to electric vehicles.

In conventional LIBs, lithium transition metal oxides or phosphates, such as LiCoO2, LiMnO4, or LiFePO4, constitute the cathode material. LiCoO2 has been used extensively in practical applications. The theoretical capacity of LiCoO2 is 274 mA h g−1 assuming complete extraction of Li+ from LiCoO2.7 However, the practical capacity achieved for LiCoO2 is 130 mA h g−1 at 4.0 V compared with Li/Li+, indicating extraction of only 0.5 moles of Li from LiCoO2. Complete extraction of Li from LiCoO2 is required to obtain high-capacity batteries; however, this can be prevented by the formation of highly unstable CoO2 and the evolution of O2.8,9 Achieving high stability requires only half of the Li ions to be de-intercalated from the cathode. Although LiCoO2 is used in commercial LIBs, the toxicity, high cost, and availability of these transition metals will become important considerations if all cars become electric. Therefore, LiFePO4 and mixed layered oxides, such as LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2, were introduced by Ohzuku et al.10 The theoretical capacity of LiFePO4 is 278 mA h g−1, and the capacity obtained from this mixed layered oxide is approximately 200 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 2.5–4.6 V. LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 also provides a higher rate than other layered oxides.
Unfortunately, these inorganic materials have limitations. Some of these materials can achieve only half of their theoretical capacity, and some require elements that are not naturally abundant, which would raise the price of inorganic materials in the future. Furthermore, large-scale production and the use of these transition metals are unsustainable. For inorganic materials, a large amount of energy is required for synthesis and recycling, and waste electrode materials contain heavy-metal ions, which cause significant environmental problems.11,12 The energy densities of inorganic electrode materials are difficult to improve, and there are structural changes during fast charging and discharging, which leads to poor cyclability and a low power density. Thus, developing new electrode materials for rechargeable batteries that are free from heavy metals and offer a high capacity, high specific energy, and high specific power is an important research objective.
The study of using organic materials as an electrode material for lithium batteries has been carried out as long as that of inorganic ones. However, interest in organic electrodes has decreased as inorganic materials gained success in the late 1980s and the development of conductive polymers as rechargeable cathodes has slowed down. Recently, attention has been given to organic electrodes because inorganic materials have reached critical limits in their performances.12 In addition to the theoretical capacity, which is generally higher than 400 mA h g−1, organic materials offer advantages that are not readily available for inorganic compounds. They are inexpensive because they have no expensive elements and can be recycled. They could be used to design many functional devices, such as all-plastic flexible batteries. In addition, the high-temperature annealing required for inorganic materials for achieving adequate purity, crystallinity, and electrode performance is not required for organic materials; therefore, they have environmentally and economically friendly manufacturing processes.11 Various types of organic materials, such as conducting polymers, organodisulfides, nitroxyl radical polymers, conjugated compounds, organic salts, and non-conjugated polymers, have been studied. In recent years, the superior performance of organic materials has been reported to be beyond the limits of inorganic materials. This study provided a comprehensive review of the recent progress and challenges of various types of organic electrode materials for LIBs.
2. Structures and redox mechanisms
Based on the discussion above, the redox mechanisms of various electroactive organics are listed in Table 1. In addition, the type of organic structure and redox mechanism that can be used for electrode materials should be determined. Research on organic electrode materials over the past decade can be categorized into seven types of structures (Table 1). Conjugated thioethers and conjugated amines are p-type organics. Organodisulfides and conjugated carbonyls are n-type organics, and conjugated hydrocarbons and nitroxyl radicals are bipolar organics. Although nitroxyl radicals are bipolar, in practice they are considered as p-type organics to obtain a stable electrochemical performance.

3. Advantages of organic electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries
In recent years, replacing inorganic materials with organic materials has been evaluated for photoelectric devices, and many organic materials have been applied in photoelectric devices,13,14 such as field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaic devices.15,16 The photoelectric performance of organic materials is comparable or superior to that of conventional inorganic materials.
In addition, organic electrode materials have numerous advantages over inorganic materials, as detailed in the following sections.
3.1 High energy density
Although organic cathode materials have a lower redox potential than inorganic materials (Fig. 2), organic molecules have a higher theoretical capacity.17 Thus, organics may provide a high energy density. For example, benzoquinone (BQ)18 has a redox potential of 2.8 V, and its theoretical capacity is 496 mA h g−1, whereas its theoretical energy density is approximately 1400 W h kg−1. This is higher than that of inorganic-based materials (the capacity of commercial LiCoO2 is 550 W h kg−1).

3.2 High power density
The power density depends on the reaction kinetics of the material, which is faster for organic molecules than for inorganic molecules. Therefore, organic materials have a high power density. Almost all organic molecules provide a high rate performance, except some molecules, such as organodisulfides and thioethers. For example, the poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl vinylether) nitroxyl radical polymer19 retains 97% of its theoretical capacity at a discharge rate of 60C in an aqueous electrolyte.
3.3 Structural diversity
Although numerous studies have been performed on inorganic materials, it is difficult to find new types of inorganic materials and obtain breakthrough battery performance. However, for organic materials, determining new types of organic structures with desirable electrochemical properties is possible.20,21
3.4 Flexibility
Inorganic materials are fragile and heavy, making the fabrication of electrodes difficult. However, organic materials are light weight and flexible; thus, there are numerous fabrication methods for organic electrodes, such as vapour deposition, printing, casting, etc. Therefore, organic electrodes are of interest for producing small, thin, and flexible devices.
3.5 Sustainability
The large-scale production and recycling of transition metals consume significant energy and cause serious environmental concerns. The large-scale use of transition metals as electrode materials is unsustainable because of their limited availability. Conversely, most organic molecules can be extracted directly from biomass22,23 or synthesized from inexpensive raw materials. In addition, organic materials can be recycled through carbon-dioxide cycling with less energy consumption.
4. Challenges
The main advantages of organic molecules as electrode materials for LIBs and sodium-ion batteries (NIBS) have been shown. However, currently, many challenges remain in the research and commercialization of organic electrode materials.
4.1 Low mass density
Organic molecules contain non-metal elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, which have a low mass density. This is acceptable if only the gravimetric energy density is considered. However, if the volumetric energy density is considered, then the volume of rechargeable lithium batteries must be increased, which increases the volume of portable electronic devices, such as cameras, mobile phones, etc.
4.2 Low electronic conductivity
Almost all organic electrode materials, except conducting polymers, are electrical insulators, which hinders the full utilization of active materials. Exploiting active materials requires a large amount of conductive additives (30–60%) during electrode preparation; however, this reduces the actual capacity of the battery. The low electronic conductivity of organic electrode materials decreases the performance of the battery.
4.3 Solubility
Dissolution of active materials in the electrolyte is an issue for organic electrode materials. Batteries made from organic materials show poor cycle stability owing to the solubility in the electrolyte of the active materials of the electrode. The most efficient way to solve this problem is by synthesizing organic polymers with a stable skeleton. However, the polymeric form decreases the theoretical specific capacity, increases electrochemical polarization, and complicates lithium-ion transport.
5. Requirements for electrochemical performance
A basic requirement for electrochemical performance is that every organic small molecule or polymer should undergo a reversible electrochemical redox reaction.24 For organic electrochemical cell candidates, the basic requirements for the electrochemical performance are described below.
5.1 Reaction reversibility
Chemical reversibility, as well as thermodynamic reversibility, is required for electrochemical performance. Reaction reversibility is an important factor to determine the electrochemical polarization and rate of the electrode material. Different organic molecules have different reaction kinetics. For example, organodisulfides have slow reaction kinetics, because bonds are broken and S–S bonds are created, which require a large activation energy. Other organic molecules, such as nitroxyl radicals and conjugated carbonyl compounds, have fast reaction kinetics and high rates.
5.2 Redox potential
The cell potential of a battery depends on the redox potentials of cathode and anode materials. Obtaining a battery with a high voltage requires a large voltage difference between the cathode and anode.25 Materials with a higher (lower) redox potential serve as cathode (anode) materials. Usually, organic cathode materials have a redox potential between 2 and 4 V versus Li/Li+, which is lower than that for inorganic cathode materials. However, the redox potential of organics can be tuned by introducing electron-withdrawing groups (–Cl, –CN, and –NO2) or electron donating groups (–OCH3, –NH2, and –OH). Electron donating on the anode (cathode) and electron withdrawing groups on the cathode (anode) can expand (shrink) the voltage difference (see Fig. 3). To prevent decomposition by the reduction (oxidation) of electrolytes, the redox potential of the cathode (anode) should be lower (higher) than that of the LUMO (HOMO). This substituent is not involved in the redox reaction; however, it directly affects the theoretical capacity of the active material because the capacity is inversely proportional to the molar mass of the compound.

Eg is the electrochemical window of the electrolyte for thermodynamic stability. VOC is the open-circuit voltage of the lithium-ion battery. 
5.3 Theoretical specific capacity
The theoretical capacity of an organic electrode material can be calculated as follows. (1)
The parameter Ct is the theoretical specific capacity, and n is the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction. The parameter F is the Faraday constant, and Mw is the molecular weight of the structural unit. According to this formula, the theoretical specific capacities of organic electrode materials may be increased in two ways: increase the number of electrons transferred and increase the number of redox groups or reduce the molecular weight of the structural unit.
5.4 Synthesis and cost
Compared with inorganic materials, organic materials are easier to design and synthesize. The cost of raw materials to synthesize organic molecules is not important until the application stage. Thus, simple organic structures with inexpensive raw materials and facile synthesis are preferable.26,27 Almost all of these requirements are fulfilled by conjugated carbonyl compounds; therefore, these compounds are promising electrode materials for next-generation rechargeable batteries, particularly LIBs and NIBs.
6. Development of organic electrode materials
6.1 Conducting polymers
Since the discovery of conducting polymers by MacDiarmid, Shirakawa, and Heeger in 1977,28 these materials have been used as electrode materials for rechargeable batteries because of their electronic conductivity and redox activity. Five conducting polymers have been used as electrode materials for rechargeable LIBs: polyacetylene (PAc),29,30 poly-paraphenylene (PPP),31,32 polyaniline (PAn),33,34 polypyrrole (PPy),35,36 and polythiophene (PTh). Among them, PAn, PPy, and PTh have been used as p-type organics, whereas PAc and PPP have been used as bipolar organics. The theoretical capacity of these conducting polymers depends on their doping level (see Fig. 4). PAc, PPP, PPy, and PTh have a theoretical capacity less than 150 mA h g−1 because of their low doping level. PAn has a theoretical capacity of 295 mA h g−1 because of its high doping level. However, the practical capacity of these conducting polymers is lower than their theoretical capacity. In addition, they have a low coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability, and self-discharge hinders their use in rechargeable LIBs.
 Fig. 4  Conducting polymers, and their doping levels and theoretical capacities. 
6.2 Organodisulfides
Since 1988, Visco et al. and Oyama et al. have focused on organodisulfides as cathode materials for LIBs because the theoretical capacity of these materials is higher than that of conducting polymers. To understand the electrochemical behaviour of organodisulfides, they have been divided into the following three types.

Dimeric organodisulfides. 
In 1988, Visco et al. first used tetraethylthiuram disulfide as a positive electrode material for sodium ion batteries.37 Furthermore, they studied various dimeric organodisulfides, such as tetramethylthiuram disulfide, dimethyl disulfide, di-fluorophenyl disulfide, etc., as an electrode material for LIBs38 (see Fig. 5). However, the electrochemical performance of these organodisulfides is poor because of their solubility in the organic electrolytes used in the battery.
 Fig. 5  Dimeric organodisulfides and their theoretical capacities. 
Polymeric organodisulfides with S–S bonds in the main chain, such as poly(2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole), poly(tetrathio ethylenediamine), poly(trithiocyanuric acid), and poly(dithio piperazine), have been studied as energy storage materials for LIBs because of their high theoretical specific capacities and their energy storage mechanism is based on the reversible two-electron reactions of the disulfide (S–S) bonds39 (see Fig. 6). However, the reduction products of this type of polymeric organodisulfide are soluble in the organic electrolyte, which leads to poor cycle performance.
 Fig. 6  Polymeric organodisulfides and their theoretical capacities. 


Polymeric organodisulfides with S–S bonds in side chains. 
To overcome the solubility problem of organodisulfide polymers with disulfide bonds in the main chain, the side chain of the conducting polymer should contain disulfide bonds. Poly(2,2′-dithiodianiline) (PDTDA)40 has S–S bonds interconnected between two electronically conductive aniline moieties. PDTDA has a high specific capacity and fast reaction kinetics; however, its cycle stability is poor because dislocation of the two main chains occurs after discharging, and it is difficult to rebuild the S–S bond during charging. Deng et al. studied poly(5,8-dihydro-1H,4H-2,3,6,7-tetrathia-anthracene),41 which contains S–S bonds on the side chain of the same chain (see Fig. 7). This design solves the dislocation problem; however, the electrochemical performance remains poor because of the poor conductivity of the polymer and the poor diffusion of lithium ions in the polymer film.
 Fig. 7  Polymeric organodisulfides and their theoretical capacities. 

6.3 Nitroxyl radical polymers
A majority of the research on nitroxyl radical polymers (see Fig. 8) has been performed by Nakahara et al. and Nishide et al. In 2002, Nakahara et al.42 first used poly(2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA) as a nitroxyl radical polymer for the cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. PTMA has a high rate and good cycling stability because of its fast reaction kinetics and stable polymer structure. In addition, they studied photocrosslinked 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-substituted (TEMPO-substituted) polynorbornene43 as a cathode material. This polymer has a specific capacity of 106 mA h g−1, tuneable solubility, increased mechanical toughness, and improved flexibility. This polymer also allows patterning on the device. Furthermore, they studied TEMPO-substituted polyacrylamide44 as a cathode material in an aqueous electrolyte with a high charge/discharge performance and an adequate cycle performance. Poly(2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-1-oxyl-3-yl ethylene oxide)45 has a specific capacity of 147 mA h g−1 with a 103 cycle stability and high rate. In general, the nitroxyl radical polymer has a high electron-transfer rate constant. This is the most important feature for obtaining a rechargeable battery with a high rate. However, it has a low theoretical capacity.
 Fig. 8  Nitroxyl radical polymers and their theoretical capacities. 
6.4 Conjugated carbonyl compounds
Organic conjugated carbonyl compounds are promising electrode materials because of their high theoretical specific capacity, fast reaction kinetics, high structural diversity, and high cycle stability.46 Quinones are well-known organic carbonyl compounds with adequate electrochemical activity, and many conjugated carbonyl compounds exhibit electrochemical redox reactions similar to those of quinones.47 The electrochemical redox reaction of benzoquinone is based on a two-electron reaction, as shown in Fig. 9. To understand the electrochemical behaviour of conjugated carbonyl compounds, they have been categorized into four types.
 Fig. 9  Electrochemical redox mechanism of benzoquinone. 

6.4.1 Organic small molecules. 
In 1969, Williams et al.48 first used dichloroisocyanuric acid (DCA) as a cathode material for a primary lithium battery. Then, Alt et al.49 studied chloranil as an electrode material for secondary LIBs. Since then, many carbonyl-based molecules have been used for LIBs. Fig. 10 shows some carbonyl-based molecular structures and their theoretical capacity. Most of them have a high capacity, high energy density, and poor cyclability because of the solubility of the active material in the electrolyte. To solve this problem, Boschi et al.50 designed large molecules, such as nonylbenzo-hexaquinone (NBHQ), which had a planar structure and a theoretical capacity of 489 mA h g−1. However, NBHQ has a capacity of only 127 mA h g−1, which is 25% of its theoretical capacity. Genorio et al.51 used an immobilization approach to solve the solubility issue. They grafted a quinone derivative of calix[4]arene onto the surface of carbon black and nanosized silica particles with a high specific surface area. However, the electrochemical performance obtained with this strategy was unsatisfactory. The best way to solve the solubility problem is by increasing conjugation or by introducing perfect functional groups.
 Fig. 10  Organic small molecules based on conjugated carbonyl groups and their theoretical capacities. 
Chen et al.52 synthesized three thermally stable redox active naphthalene diimide (NTCDI) units in a rigid and cyclic constitution (see Fig. 11a), which had a capacity of 146.4 (58.1) mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.1C (100C). Three redox active naphthalene diimide units delivered a 71.1 mA h g−1 capacity at 10C after 300 cycles. They found that this high performance was because of the proper arrangement of the redox active units, and the introduction of intrinsic nanoporosity allowed fast diffusion of Li+ ions. In addition, this approach affected the solubility of the active material in the organic electrolyte. Through a simple organic reaction, Lee et al.53 synthesized naphthoquinone derivatives (see Fig. 11b) as a cathode material for lithium organic batteries. 2,3-Diamino-1,4-naphthoquinone (DANQ) had an initial discharge capacity of 250 mA h g−1 and 99% retention of the capacity with respect to its initial capacity after 500 cycles at a rate of 0.2C. At a rate of 20C, DANQ has 47% discharge capacity compared with that at the rate of 0.2C. Kim et al.54 synthesized a series of PMDI-based redox-active compounds, (see Fig. 11c) containing two rigid macrocycles, and measured their electrochemical performance as active materials for LIBs. The macrocycles (−)-2PMDI and (−)-3PMDI-Δ exhibited through-space electron delocalization because of the forced proximity between the redox units. There were significant differences in the electrochemical performance of (−)-2PMDI and (−)-3PMDI-Δ, with only the latter compound producing the desired one-plateau voltage profile because of dense clustering within the narrow voltage range of the six redox potentials of (−)-3PMDI-Δ. This difference was because of the repulsive interactions between the reduced PMDI units, which were strong in (−)-2PMDI because of the cofacial orientation and strain in the cyclic dimer. However, for a triangular macrocycle, both are reduced. Kim et al. concluded that controlling the delocalization of the reduced states and minimizing the electron repulsion between the redox-active units were important considerations for designing active materials for organic rechargeable batteries.

Luo et al.55 reported the application of TPB as a high-performance cathode for rechargeable LIBs. Because of four rigid phthalimide groups, TPB was insoluble in aprotic electrolytes. Meanwhile, the four rigid aromatic groups lowered the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the molecule, providing more active carbonyl sites with an extended conjugated structure. Therefore, TPB showed a high voltage potential of 3.05 V, a high initial discharge capacity (223 mA h g−1, 0.2C), long cycling stability (91.4% capacity retention after 100 cycles), and a high rate capability (155 mA h g−1, 10C). It was found that six lithium ions bound/unbound reversibly during the discharge/charge process because of a redox couple, Li6TPB/TPB (see Fig. 12).

Xie et al.56 proposed two stable ladder-like non-polymeric dianhydride structures, NDA-4N and PDA-4N, based on large naphthalene and perylene building blocks (Fig. 13). The two cathodes (NDA-4N and PDA-4N) showed reasonable initial reversible capacities (141.8 mA h g−1 and 116.4 mA h g−1, respectively), with excellent average coulombic efficiencies (CEs) (99.09% and 99.71%, respectively) and adequate rate performance (up to 1000 mA g−1). Long-term cycling was obtained and a large improvement (36.5%) in the capacity retention was achieved when switching the backbone from naphthalene to perylene. These results indicated obvious advantages over conventional NDA and PDA small molecules and their polymer structures.

Liang et al.57 synthesized a series of carbonyl-based electrode compounds that contained various fused heteroaromatic structures, such as furan (benzofuro[5,6-b]furan-4,8-dione), thiophene (benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione), and pyridine (pyrido[3,4-g]isoquinoline-5,10-dione) (see Fig. 14). Furthermore, these compounds were superior as cathode materials for rechargeable LIBs with respect to their benzene-fused analogue (anthraquinone), revealing a versatile yet unexplored strategy for the design of organic electrode materials with multi-electron reactions.

Two NTCDI derivative salts were prepared with a carbon chain spacer between the nitrogen atom and anionic group. Both compounds are readily obtained from the reaction of naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride with neutralized glycine, producing NTCDI (MeCarb-Na)2 (1), or with neutralized taurine to yield NTCDI (EtSulf-Na)2 (2). NTCDI (MeCarb-Na)2 exhibited a reversible capacity of 147 mA h g−1, while NTCDI (EtSulf-Na)2 showed a reversible capacity of 113 mA h g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency over 50 cycles (see Fig. 15).58 Computational and experimental studies revealed that the cyclability may be increased without affecting the battery capacity by introducing two –CO2Li groups for various quinones. Shimizu et al.59 synthesized p- and o-quinones that had two –CO2Li groups, and they verified the effect of –CO2Li on the cycle performance of LIBs. In this study, Bhosale et al.60 designed a carboxylic acid-containing perylene diimide (benzoic-PDI) as the cathode material because carboxylic acid is hydrophilic and decreases the solubility of the benzoic-PDI in the organic electrolyte solution used in the battery. Chemical reduction, which is commonly known as n-doping in the organic-semiconductor literature, could precondition molecules for faster lithium-ion association and disassociation. Furthermore, n-doping increases the conductivity of the carbonyl-containing molecules, which increases the rate. The battery comprising reduced benzoic-PDI exhibited 100% coulombic efficiency and specific capacity, while discharging at a rate of 20C. This battery also exhibited a high specific energy (213 W h kg−1) and specific power (8548 W kg−1) (see Fig. 16).

6.4.2 Organic polymers. 
In 1986, Foos et al.61 introduced a polymeric quinone as a cathode material for lithium batteries because of its high theoretical capacity (505 mA h g−1), energy density, and insolubility in organic electrolytes. However, the capacity of this polymer is 25% of its theoretical capacity, and the cycle performance is poor, which may be because of defects in the synthesis and nonoptimized electrode construction. Numerous attempts have been made to synthesize and use an organic polymer containing redox groups, such as quinones and imides, as electrode materials for LIBs. Here, various quinone- and imide-based organic polymers and their theoretical capacities were discussed (see Fig. 17). Poly(anthraquinonyl sulfide) (PAQS)62 was synthesized and studied as the cathode electrode material for rechargeable lithium batteries and had a capacity of 198 mA h g−1 with excellent cycle stability. Poly(vinylanthraquinone)63 was used as the anode material for polymer air batteries and had a capacity of 214 mA h g−1, which was 93% of its theoretical capacity. In 2010, Song et al. introduced polyimides as the cathode material for LIBs because of their high mechanical strength and good thermal stability. Polymer-bound pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone64 has excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 231 mA h g−1, a high rate performance of 90% of its capacity (even at 30C as compared with 1C), and high cycling stability. However, polymers are insulators, which require the addition of a large amount of conducting additives during electrode preparation, causing slow electron transport in electrodes.
 Fig. 17  Organic polymers based on conjugated carbonyl groups and their theoretical capacities. 
Häupler et al.65 performed Knoevenagel condensation between two carbonyl groups of 2-vinylanthraquinone and two dicyanomethane groups that were conjugated to the remaining anthraquinone π system. Then, the material was polymerized by free radical polymerization with azobisisobutyronitrile as the initiator to form the pendant-type polymer poly(2-vinyl-11,11,12,12-tetracyano-9,10-anthra quinonedimethane) (PTCAQ). This polymer underwent a two-electron redox reaction, in which, during the first reduction step, a destabilized twisted radical anion structure formed. Therefore, to stabilize and re-aromatize the structure, the second reduction was more favourable and occurred at the same potential. This material had a specific capacity of 156 mA h g−1 at 1C and an average cell voltage of 2.25 (3.05) V during discharging (charging). In addition, polyTCAQ had excellent cycling stability. After 500 charge/discharge cycles, it had a capacity loss of only 12% at a consistently high coulombic efficiency of 99%. Häupler et al.66 introduced a polymer containing pendants of 2-vinyl-4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]-dithiophene-4,8-dione (PVBDT). In accordance with the expectations, the heterocycle-appended polymer PVBDT (T7) had a specific capacity (217 mA h g−1) that exceeded that of the other polymers detailed in this review (see Fig. 18). Häupler et al. found that the highest-performing electrode fabricated from this polymer contained 10 wt% of the active material combined with polyvinylidene difluoride and vapour-grown carbon fibres as conductive additives in an ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate (1:1 v/v), 1 M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) electrolyte. This low active-material content provided a potential of 2.59 (2.23) V during charging (discharging). After 100 charge/discharge cycles it retained approximately 52% of its capacity.

Jing et al.67 designed and synthesized two oligomeric heteroaromatic-fused quinones and investigated the factors that influence their electrochemical properties for Li-ion storage. Fig. 19 shows that PBDTD (poly(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione-2,6-diyl)) and PBDTDS (poly(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione-2,6-diyl sulfide)) are composed of a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDTD) unit in the backbone. Both quinones share the poorly electronically conducting cross-conjugated structure due to the quinone building blocks and sp3 sulfur atoms in the backbone. Over 200 mA h g−1 capacity is demonstrated for both quinones. PBDTD barely dissolves in polar solvents (e.g. DMF and NMP) and only dissolves in concentrated sulfuric acid, while PBDTDS shows extremely poor solubility in all solvents. As a result, PBDTD demonstrated 96% capacity retention after 250 cycles. For PBDTDS, the capacity first increased from 121 to 145 mA h g−1 in the first 50 cycles and 95% of the highest capacity is retained after 250 cycles. Such stability is a significant improvement from that of previously reported PVBDT. These results indicate that heteroaromatic-fused oligomeric quinones could effectively suppress dissolution of active materials. Cross-conjugated PBDTD evolves to through-conjugated PBDTD after being fully discharged, which could significantly improve intra-chain electron conduction.

In PBDTD, cross-conjugation (blue) evolves to through-conjugation (green) during lithiation. In PBDTDS, cross-conjugation (blue) remains during lithiation due to the bifurcation point being at S atoms (reproduced with permission from ref. 67 copyright 2017 Science Direct). 
Patil et al.68 designed redox-active polymers (RAPs) which are copolymers bearing catechol- and Li+ ion-conducting anionic pendants and demonstrated that RAPs have ultrarobust electrochemical energy storage features when combined with carbon nanotubes as a flexible, binder-, and metal current collector-free buckypaper electrode. The structure-optimized RAPs could exhibit high-capacities of 360 mA h g−1 at 5C and 320 mA h g−1 at 30C in LIBs with an excellent cyclability (capacity retention of 98% over 3400 cycles at 30C). The high-ion and electron mobilities within the cathode material enabled producing 96 mA h g−1 (24% capacity retention) at an extremely high C-rate of 600C (6 s for total discharge) without any degradation of the active species. Excellent cyclability was also noted with a capacity retention of 98% over 3400 cycles at 30C.
Sharma et al.69 synthesized different polyimides of perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) using ethylenediamine, hydrazine, and urea to produce EDP, HP, and UP (see Fig. 20), and compared the electrochemical performances of these polymers. The excellent electrochemical performance of the UP electrode in terms of capacity, cycle stability, and rate may be attributed to the presence of an additional carbonyl group and enhanced conductivity upon cycling. UP had an initial capacity of 80 mA h g−1, which increased to 130 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. HP had an improved cycling performance of approximately 84.6% retention of the capacity after 50 cycles. π-conjugated redox polymers, such as P(NDI2OD-TET) and P(NDI2OD-T2), have also been studied for use as ultrafast LIB cathodes. Although the theoretical capacities of these polymers are 52.7 and 54.2 mA h g−1, respectively, these polymers have a high rate performance. P(NDI2OD-T2) delivered 95% of its theoretical capacity at a rate of 100C and 96% retention of the capacity after 3000 cycles at 10C. Liang et al.70 found that the intrachain charge transport within the π-conjugated backbone of P(NDI2OD-T2) enhanced the electronic conductivity, whereas that of P(NDI2OD-TET) relied on less-efficient interchain charge hopping (see Fig. 21).

Recently, polymers containing thioethers and quinones have been evaluated as energy storage materials.71–73 Xie et al. designed a ladder-structured heterocyclic dithioether-containing poly(quinone) and poly(2,3-dithiino-1,4-benzoquinone) (PDB) as a stable electrode material for all-plastic batteries (Fig. 22). Free-standing electrodes were prepared by mixing the prepared PDB and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and these electrodes exhibited good flexibility. For proof-of-concept, they employed heterocyclic poly(quinone) as a bi-functional electrode, enabling the construction of an all-plastic-electrode-based symmetric full-battery. In their research, PDB delivered a long stability of more than 1000 cycles as an active cathode. In addition, the fabricated PDB full-battery exhibited a high energy density of 276 W h kg−1 and a large capacity retention of 119 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles. This battery outperformed almost all current all-plastic-electrode rechargeable batteries, indicating that their work presented a rational design to develop flexible, stable, and high-storage bi-functional electrodes for future high-performance all-plastic batteries.

Mukherjee et al.74 introduced a mesoporous triptycene-related, rigid network polymer with a high specific surface area as the electrode material for a rechargeable LIB. Poly(dihydroanthracene succinic anhydride) (PDASA) (see Fig. 23) was designed with a three-dimensional rigid porous network to allow free movement of ions and the electrolyte, as well as to facilitate its interaction with the active anhydride moieties (containing two carbonyl groups). The intake of Li+ ions provided a high specific capacity of 1100 mA h g−1 at a discharge current of 50 mA g−1 and approximately 120 mA h g−1 at a discharge current of 3 A g−1, with an excellent cyclability of up to 1000 cycles. This rate, which is one of the highest reported to date among organic porous polymers, makes the triptycene-related rigid three-dimensional network a good choice for LIBs and provides a new method to design polymer-based electrode materials for metal-ion battery technology.

Sun et al.75 synthesized hyperbranched conjugated Schiff base polymers using condensation between 4,4′,4′′-nitrilotribenzaldehyde and p-phenylenediamine. In the conjugated Schiff base polymer, the Schiff base functional group accepted an electron during discharge to form radical anions, and the Schiff base was reformed by losing an electron during charging. The conjugated Schiff base polymers had a specific capacity of 140 (60) mA h g−1 at 0.4C (16C). The discharge capacity decreased, and the coulombic efficiency remained above 99% after 500 cycles, indicating outstanding cycle stability. Linear polyimides were synthesized by polycondensation of aromatic dianhydrides with bifunctional amines. These porous polyimides were obtained by polycondensation of aromatic dianhydrides with trifunctional amines (see Fig. 24). Tian et al.76 reported the synthesis of three polyimides: PI-1, PI-2, and PI-3, by the polycondensation of 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene with pyromellitic dianhydride, 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride, and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride, respectively. PI-1 had an initial capacity of 61.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 25 mA g−1, which decreased gradually with the cycle number. However, PI-2 and PI-3 had initial capacities of 103.4 and 78.1 mA h g−1, respectively. PI-2 (PI-3) had 66.2% (74.1%) capacity retention after 30 (65) cycles. LIBs are a commercial technology that could satisfy the energy storage requirements of current and emerging applications. However, the use of transition metal-based cathodes precludes them from being inexpensive, sustainable, and environmentally benign, even with recycling programs. In their study, a highly stable organic material that could be used instead of transition metal cathodes was discussed. To solve the stability issue, Schon et al.77 synthesized a 3D framework PDI-Tc by reacting triptycene with perylene dianhydride (PI-4) for obtaining the cathode material of LIBs. PDI-Tc had a capacity of 75.9 mA h g−1. The battery retained a near-perfect coulombic efficiency and over 80% of its capacity after 500 cycles.

To understand the structure and performance relationship, Yang et al.78 synthesized two crystalline Schiff base covalent organic frameworks by reacting 2,7 diaminobenzo [lmn][3,8] phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone with 1,3,5-triformyl-phloroglucinol (Tp) and 1,3,5-triformylbenzene (Tb) to obtain the Tp–DANT-COF and Tb–DANT-COF, respectively, in different solvents at 120 °C under an argon atmosphere for five days (see Fig. 25). The Tp–DANT-COF had an initial discharge capacity of 93.4 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 78.9 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1.5C. Upon cycling, the reversible capacity of the Tp–DANT-COF increased because of the increased electrochemical reaction kinetics, whereas the Tb–DANT-COF had an initial discharge (charge) capacity of 144.4 (135.4) mA h g−1, at a current density of 0.34C. Furthermore, the Tb–DANT-COF electrode retained a reversible capacity of 80.1 mA h g−1, after 300 cycles at 3.4C. The Tp–DANT-COF and Tb–DANT-COF exhibited an adequate specific capacity, a high rate performance, and a high cycle stability.

Wang et al.79 illustrated a new strategy to increase the diffusion controlled redox reaction in covalent organic frameworks using exfoliation of the covalent organic framework. The DAAQ–ECOF had a specific capacity of 145 mA h g−1 after 70 cycles by achieving 96% of its theoretical capacity at a current density of 20 mA g−1. The non-exfoliated COF (DAAQ–TFP-COF) had a specific capacity of 110 mA h g−1 by achieving 73% of its theoretical capacity. This indicated that the redox group was deep inside the one-dimensional channels, thereby hindering it from participating in the electrochemical redox reaction. In addition, the DAAQ–ECOF had capacities of 107 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1, which was approximately double that of the DAAQ–TFP-COF, and 76 mA h g−1 at 3000 mA g−1, which was triple that of the DAAQ–TFP-COF. In addition, the DAAQ–ECOF had a capacity of 104 mA h g−1 at a current density of 500 mA g−1 after 1800 cycles. In addition, two new COFs with a high theoretical capacity and high discharge potential were synthesized (see Fig. 26).

6.4.3 Polymer–carbon nanotube/graphene composites. 
To increase the rate performance and decrease the solubility of the material in the electrolyte, Wu et al.80 synthesized CNT nanocomposites (see Fig. 27a) for use as the organic cathode material in LIBs. PTCDA had a discharge capacity of 127 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1C; however, this capacity decreased with an increasing current density. The composite of PTCDA with CNTs (PTCDA@5% CNT) had discharge capacities of 125 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 115 mA h g−1 at 2C. The high electronic conductivity of PTCDA@5% CNT provided a high rate performance. To increase the cycle stability, Wu et al. polymerized PTCDA with ethylene diamine in the presence of CNTs to create a PI/CNT composite. PI/CNT had a capacity of 115 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, and the cycle stability of the PTCDA/CNT composite material at a current density of 100 mA g−1 was 73% retention of the capacity, whereas PI/CNT had 93% retention of the capacity after 300 cycles with approximately 100% coulombic efficiency. Similar composites composed of polyimide81 or polydopamine82 and CNTs were recently reported to exhibit significant coulombic efficiency and appreciable cycle stability.

(b) TEM images and charge–discharge curves of PAQS-graphene and PI-graphene composites (reproduced with permission from ref. 83 copyright 2012 American Chemical Society). 
Fan et al.81 demonstrated that polyimide (PI)@carbon nanotube (CNT) composites could be used as cathode materials for Li+, Mg2+, and Al3+ batteries, and these metal/PI batteries had a high power density and long cycle life. They prepared the cathode materials using in situ formation of the PI@CNT composite, in which the CNTs were connected with each other to construct a 3D electron conductive matrix. The PI@CNT cathodes provided a highly reversible capacity of 180 mA h g−1, approximately 130 mA h g−1, and 110 mA h g−1 for Li, Mg, and Al ion batteries, respectively. The PI@CNT could also reversibly store Na ions with a high capacity of approximately 150 mA h g−1 and exhibited a good cycling stability. The cycle life of the PI@CNT cathodes could be further enhanced by tuning the electrolytes. As the electrolyte was changed to a 4 M LiFSI DME electrolyte, no capacity decay was observed after 10000 cycles for the LIB. The PI@CNT composite maintained a high rate capability and long cycling stability at a low temperature for all three ion batteries. The excellent cyclability, high rate capability, and superior low-temperature kinetics suggested ion insertion into the PI@CNT through a different ion storage mechanism than that of previously reported inorganic crystal materials.
Liu et al.82 investigated polydopamine as a high-performance organic cathode material for rechargeable Li- and Na-ion batteries. Dopamine was self-polymerized on the surface of FWNTs in alkaline aqueous solutions, during which the loading of polydopamine could be controlled by the mixing time and concentration of dopamine. Free-standing and flexible hybrid films were assembled using a vacuum filtration method. These were used as cathodes in Li- and Na-cells. The hybrid electrodes exhibited gravimetric capacities of 133 mA h g−1 in Li-cells and 109 mA h g−1 in Na-cells through double layer capacitance and multiple redox-reactions.
The polydopamine in the hybrid electrodes could exhibit high capacities of 235 mA h g−1 in Li-cells and 213 mA h g−1 in Na-cells. Moreover, these hybrid electrodes showed a high capacity of 139 mA h/g at a high current density of 10 A g−1 and an excellent cycling stability of 115 mA h g−1 without any decay at 0.1 A g−1 after 10000 cycles.
Song et al.83 demonstrated the one-pot synthesis of PAQS–graphene and polyimide–graphene composites. They observed the high electronic conductivity of these polymer–graphene composites, which show a very high charge–discharge performance and ultimately high-power density. After the initial activation cycles, PAQS has a reversible capacity of 177 mA h g−1 with a utilization ratio of 79%, whereas PAQS–graphene composites have reversible capacities of 187 mA h g−1 with a utilization ratio of 88% and 165 mA h g−1 with a utilization ratio of 88% with the addition of 6 and 26 wt% graphene, respectively. The rate performance of PAQS–graphene nanocomposites increases with the increasing graphene content. Song et al. reported the same electrochemical performance for PI–graphene nanocomposites (see Fig. 27b).
Ai et al.84 synthesized vat dye/graphene composites as organic cathodes for high performance LIBs. A representative example of vat dyes, Vat Green 8, is a green color dye containing a large condensed aromatic ring system with electroactive conjugated carbonyl groups. (see Fig. 28a). They claimed that the pi–pi interactions between Vat Green 8 and graphene sheets afford a stable composite structure, which can not only effectively suppress the dissolution of active materials but also guarantee fast electron transportation during the electrochemical reactions. Consequently, the Vat Green 8/graphene (VG 8/G) composite exhibits long-term cycle stability and excellent high-rate capability. VG 8/G-0.5 shows the best performance with a capacity of ≈272 mA h g−1 without any decay upon 200 consecutive cycles (at a current density of 100 mA g−1) and superior rate performance (≈74 mA h g−1 at 3200 mA g−1). (See Fig. 28b).

6.4.4 Organic salts. 
Some scientists have tried to solve the solubility problem of small organic molecules by forming metal salts of their corresponding dicarboxylic acids, hydroxyl quinones, and imides. A majority of the studies in this field have been performed by Armand, Poizot, and Tarascon. In 2008, Xiang et al.85 introduced this concept for LIBs to decrease the solubility of small organic molecules in the electrolyte. They synthesized and checked the electrochemical performance of dilithiated 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone. During the first ten cycles, a 23% capacity loss occurred. Tarascon later used dilithiated oxocarbon to obtain a specific capacity of 580 mA h g−1 and specific energy density of 1300 W h kg−1.86 However, a loss of approximately 43% capacity occurred after 25 cycles because of the solubility of the material. Based on these results, Xiang et al. found that multiple charge formation was important to decrease the dissolution. However, the additional charge formation increased the cycle stability and decreased the theoretical capacity and working potential. For example, the lithiated anthraquinone derivative had a 212 mA h g−1 theoretical capacity and 2.25 V working potential, and anthraquinone had a 257 mA h g−1 theoretical capacity and 1.8 V working potential. However, this anthraquinone derivative had a better cycle performance than anthraquinone.87 In 2011, Piozot used a pyromellitic diimide dilithium salt as an electrode material because no significant loss in theoretical capacity occurred since the difference in the formula weight between H+ and Li+ was small. However, its working potential decreased by 0.38 V compared with that of its corresponding diimide.88
The salt formation strategy was adequate for organic molecules that could serve as anode materials for rechargeable batteries because their working potential decreased after salt formation. Tarascon and co-workers synthesized and investigated the electrochemical performance of dilithium trans-muconate as an electrode material for LIBs.89 Dilithium muconate had a specific capacity of 205 mA h g−1, which reduced after 80 cycles to a specific capacity of 125 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.1C. The LIBs based on dilithium terephthalate had a capacity of 300 mA h g−1, which was 100% of its theoretical capacity. After 50 cycles, this reduced to 234 mA h g−1, which was approximately 78% retention. Fig. 29 shows various organic salts and their theoretical capacities.
 Fig. 29  Organic salts based on conjugated carbonyl groups and their theoretical capacities. 
Lee et al.90 used lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), another naturally derived quinone, to achieve high electrical and ionic conductivities in organic cathode materials. Two other synthetic quinones were used as controls: menadione (also referred to as vitamin K3, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), which is occasionally used as a nutritional supplement, and 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ). The electrical/ionic conductivities of lawsone were several orders of magnitude higher than those of menadione and NQ. The lithium batteries based on the lawsone cathode delivered a high discharge capacity of 280 mA h g−1 (theoretical value of 283 mA h g−1) with 99% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5C, with excellent rate capability.
Recently, another type of organic salt, azo compounds, has also been investigated by several research groups.91,92 Luo et al. discovered that azo compounds, which can be electrochemically reduced from nitro compounds, are a new family of organic electrode materials with superior electrochemical performance in LIBs. Two nitrobenzoic acid derivatives, the 4-nitrobenzoic acid lithium salt (NBALS) and 4-nitrophenylacetic acid lithium salt (NPALS), were selected as model nitro compounds to evaluate their electrochemical performance as Li-ion battery electrodes. In addition, a benzoic acid lithium salt (BALS), without a nitro group, was used as a control to demonstrate the electrochemical activity of the nitro group. Among them, the NBALS exhibits high cycling stability and high rate capability, but a low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE, 27.3%).

6.5 Heteroatomic conjugated compounds
Peng et al.93 reported the synthesis of conjugated quinoxaline-based heteroaromatic molecules (3Q) by condensation of cyclic carbonyl molecules with o-phenylenediamine. 3Q featured a number of electron-deficient pyrazine sites, where multiple redox reactions occurred. When hybridized with graphene and coupled with an ether-based electrolyte, an organic cathode based on 3Q molecules displayed a discharge capacity of 395 mA h g−1 at 400 mA g−1 (1C) in the voltage range of 1.2–3.9 V and approximately 70% capacity retention after 10000 cycles at 8 A g−1. It also exhibited a capacity of 222 mA h g−1 at 20C, which corresponded to 60% of the initial specific capacity. Their results indicated that the heteroaromatic molecules with multiple redox sites are promising for developing high-energy-density, long-cycle-life organic rechargeable batteries. Lin et al.94 reported free-standing nitrogen-rich graphene-like HCP (NG-HCP) nanosheets with well-defined microporous graphene-like subunits through low-temperature solution-processed polycondensation. The morphology, porosity, and packing motifs of these NG-HCP nanosheets were systemically investigated using a series of characterization tools. Using the NG-HCP nanosheets as anodes, high-capacity lithium-ion storage with an excellent cycle performance was observed. These NG-HCPs with homogeneous micropores of 11.65 Å and a thickness of 1.0 ± 0.2 nm were synthesized through solution-processed polycondensation. The prepared NG-HCP (band-gap 1.25 eV) exhibited a high electrical conductivity. A typical AB…stacking mode between the NG-HCP layers was revealed by HR-TEM, which further proved that the well-defined large π-conjugated plane was a graphene-like structure. The well-dispersed NG-HCP nanosheets with a high conductivity and the synergistic effects of the micropores and N-doping made NG-HCP an excellent anode for LIBs. The fabricated LIBs displayed a high reversible capacity of 1320 mA h g−1 (at 20 mA g−1), an adequate rate capability of 257 mA h g−1 (at 2.5 A g−1), and a long-term cycling performance (>600 cycles). Xu et al.95 also reported similar heteroatomic conjugated polymeric structures having a near-unity coulombic efficiency and energy density with an adequate cycle stability of 62% retention after 50 cycles.
To overcome the low electrical conductivity of organic polymers, organic compounds with large conjugated structures may be used to induce charge transfer. In addition, the redox reaction in organic polymers may occur on a redox functional group. Furthermore, experiments and calculations have shown that each C6 ring accepts six electrons during discharge and returns six electrons during charging. Thus, Wu et al.96 synthesized large π-conjugated ladder-polymer nanoparticles, such as poly(benzobisimidazo benzophenanthroline) (BBL) and its derivative (SBBL), and tested them as anode materials for rechargeable LIBs (see Fig. 30). In the first discharge cycle, small peaks appeared at approximately 2.1, 1.6, and 1.0 V, which are associated with the reduction of the carbonyl group and the addition of Li to unsaturated nitrogen. In addition, a broad reduction peak appeared below 0.7 V owing to the lithiation of the conjugated aromatic rings. BBL had specific discharge (charge) capacities of 1285 (1098) mA h g−1 at room temperature and 1787 (1592) mA h g−1 at 50 °C. These results are several times greater than those obtained with commercial graphite anodes. Subsequently, as an anode material for LIBs, Xie et al.97 developed nanostructured poly(1,4-dihydro-11H pyrazino[2′,3′:3,4]cyclopenta[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one) (PPCQ) as a conjugated ladder polymer that contained a large number of heteroatoms. This novel PPCQ delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 1678 mA h g−1. Moreover, its capacity retention was 972 mA h g−1 at a 100 mA g−1 current density after 120 charge/discharge cycles and 489 mA h g−1 at a 2.5 A g−1 current density after 1000 cycles. PPCQ thus had an excellent cycle stability and rate. Xie et al. also determined that conjugated ladder polymers with heteroatoms produced superior anode materials for LIBs. Moreover, the facile synthesis of this polymer, the low-temperature reaction conditions, and the non-metal structures constitute potential ecological arguments in favour of using these materials in sustainable energy-storage devices. Wu et al.98 prepared the conjugated ladder polyazacene analogue poly(1,6-dihydropyrazino[2,3g]quinoxaline-2,3,8-triyl-7-(2H)-ylidene-7,8-dimethylidene) (PQL) using the re-precipitation method. PQL had a high electronic conductivity which is a crucial factor to achieve a high rate. PQL had a discharge (charge) capacity of 1231 (1020) mA h g−1 in the second cycle at room temperature, and at 50 °C, it had a discharge (charge) capacity of 1249 (1146) mA h g−1 in the second cycle. During cycling, the capacity gradually increased and finally stabilized at approximately 1770 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.05C. PQL had a high specific capacity, large cycle stability, and an adequate rate, and offered the best operating characteristics of an organic-molecule-based anode material. The electrochemical properties of the heteroatomic conjugated compounds described in this study are listed in Table 6.

6.6 Non-conjugated compounds
Organic compounds have structural diversity, flexibility, and molecular-level designability. Previously reported small organic carbonyl molecules for electrochemical performances often comprise conjugated structures, such as benzene and naphthalene rings, wherein conjugated moieties stabilize enolic structures. However, the variety of conjugated carbonyl-containing small organic molecules is small, and thus, the screening of conjugated carbonyl-containing organic electrodes is limited. Therefore, recently, non-conjugated compounds have been investigated by several researchers.99,100
Ma et al.99 considered the organic compound 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (C8H12O4, CHDA), which contained a non-conjugated six-membered ring and two carboxylates in contrapositions. The structural design was created to prevent electron stabilization from double bond reformation and was expected to form orbital conversion from p* to s induced by hydrogen transfer between two neighbouring molecules. The conjugated carboxylate compounds stabilized the added electrons by the double bond reformation mechanism; however, 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (C8H12O4, CHDA) with a non-conjugated ring (–C6H10–) connected with carboxylates underwent electrochemical reactions with two Na ions, delivering a high charge specific capacity of 284 mA h g−1 (249 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles) and adequate rate performances of 125 mA h g−1 at 2.0 A g−1 and 257 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 (see Fig. 31).

Wu et al.100 reported a scalable non-conjugated dicarboxylate based on sodium humate (Na2HA) for sodium–organic batteries. An Na2HA/rGO-hybrid electrode was prepared through functionalization with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (see Fig. 32). This hybrid electrode delivered a high reversible discharge capacity of 133 mA h g−1 at a current density of 500 mA g−1, achieving a capacity retention of 91.6% over 2000 cycles. Based on the experimental results and DFT calculations, it was found that the molecular structure of Na2HA non-conjugated dicarboxylate groups was stable and reversible upon continuous Na-insertion/deinsertion processes. The electrochemical properties of the non-conjugated compound described in this study are listed in Table 7.

7. Summary and perspectives
In this review, organic materials have been shown to be promising candidates for low cost and high-performance electrode materials for rechargeable batteries (see Fig. 33). Organic electrode materials are important for rechargeable batteries because they can decrease the cost of the device, allow flexibility, and can also create opportunities for the use of multivalent ions without the problems associated with inorganic compounds. In addition, organic electrode materials have high potential to achieve a high energy density and power density owing to their high theoretical capacity and fast redox kinetics. However, organic electrode materials have a commercialization issue owing to the solubility of organic small molecules in the electrolyte, and organic polymers have a low conductivity. To address these issues, several strategies have been proposed. Functionalization of organic small molecules with ionic groups has been performed to solve the solubility issue. The structural modification of organic molecules with an electron withdrawing group and an electron donating group can tune the redox potential. Substituting carbon with another heteroatom, such as sulfur and nitrogen, could also tune the redox potential. Moreover, the chemical reduction strategy of organic molecules can increase the conductivity of the molecules and high rate performance of the battery. Forming a composite with graphene can increase the conductivity and rate performance of organic polymers. In addition, a three-dimensional rigid porous polymer with a high surface area allows the free movement of ions and electrolytes to obtain a high rate of performance.
 Fig. 33  Image shows the properties of organic molecules and their application in various devices. 
The conjugated carbonyl system is currently one of the most promising structures. It has the potential to obtain a high energy density and power density because of two-electron redox reactions accompanied by a high cycling stability and fast kinetics. However, it is still challenging for carbonyl materials to achieve high energy and power densities accompanied by high material content and activity. There are still many possibilities to improve the theoretical and practical capacities and the electrode kinetics of organic carbonyl compounds to discover more efficient electroactive structures. For sustainability, it is important to consider the production cost. Most carbonyl compounds are extracted from biomass or synthesized with inexpensive raw materials; thus, organic carbonyl materials are promising electrode materials for the next generation of rechargeable batteries. A promising organic electrode material could be created by designing the appropriate covalent organic framework or conjugated microporous polymer by choosing high capacity redox-active building blocks from renewable sources. In addition, high capacity redox-active molecules should be designed as pendant groups on conjugated conducting backbones for the next generation of rechargeable stationary and redox flow batteries.
