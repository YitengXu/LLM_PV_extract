    , Accepted 26th February 2017First published on 14th March 2017AbstractGate-tunable Schottky junction solar cells (SJSCs) based on graphene and graphene mesh electrodes on n-type Si are fabricated and the effect of the external gate voltage (Vg) on the photovoltaic characteristics is investigated. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of both devices continuously increase with increasing absolute values of Vg. Importantly, despite the slightly lower PCE values at Vg = 0 V, the graphene mesh on Si SJSC shows more rapid enhancement of PCE values, from 5.7% to 8.1%, with Vg varied from 0 V to −1 V. The finite element simulation highlights the benefits of the graphene mesh electrodes from the non-uniform and dynamic modulation of potential distributions driven correlatively by a work function change in the graphene regions and electric-field penetration through the hole regions.
Introduction
Schottky junction solar cells (SJSCs) that utilize a built-in potential across metal–semiconductor or metal–insulator–semiconductor junctions have an advantage over standard p–n junction solar cells in that complementary doping is not indispensable for a Schottky junction.1,2 However, the SJSCs still remain inferior to p–n junction solar cells mainly due to the cost of making reliable Schottky contact electrodes.1 Recently, SJSCs made with graphene electrodes, intended to replace vacuum-evaporated metal grids, have attracted interest due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), simple structure and easy fabrication process.3–11 Graphene is in principle advantageous over normal metal grids in that the optically active built-in potential can be developed over regions just beneath graphene. Nevertheless, the first graphene on Si (Gr–Si) SJSC showed relatively poor performance with a PCE of 1.5%.6 It is associated with the relatively low work function (built-in potential) of graphene as well as the high sheet resistance. Subsequently, fast increases in the PCE have been achieved, up to 8.6%, by using chemically doped graphene,12 and up to ∼12.4% by optimizing the interfacial oxide thickness.10 Interestingly, for chemically doped graphene, SJSC with a 1.5 nm thick interfacial oxide exhibited the highest PCE, although the optimal oxide thickness slightly depends on the doping and illumination levels. This rapid enhancement of the PCE, still lower than the best record for Al/Si Schottky junction solar cells (∼20%),2 suggests that the carrier transport or charge recombination across the junction potential plays an important role in cell performance and there remains lots of room for improvement.
In this regard, a new approach to modulating the interface potential of the SJSCs by applying an external field could improve photovoltaic efficiency. One way of exploiting the benefits of an external gate voltage (Vg) was first proposed by Call et al. in the early 1970s for Au/Si solar cells.13 In those early devices, the applied Vg developed additional potential gradients over the regions between the metal grids, which improved the photocarrier collection efficiency; however, the electric field was screened by metal grids and thus has no substantial contribution to the interface potential modulation at the Au/Si junction. Recently, Wadhwa et al. advanced this concept by employing nanotube (CNT)-based conducting electrodes on Si SJSCs. Here, the CNT film has advantages over the metal grids in terms of its superior optical transparency and substantial permeability to the electric field. Indeed, they demonstrated the unprecedented modulation of the junction potential at the CNT/Si Schottky contact via the Vg induced work-function tuning, made available by the low density of electronic states of the CNTs. In this way, photocarrier recombination at both the interface traps and the defects was minimized by the external field, thereby enhancing the photovoltaic efficiency.14–19 However, the CNT film that consists of randomly interconnected nanotube bundles possesses high tube-to-tube contact resistance and forms a very rough and narrow interface with Si.
Analogous to CNT films, graphene's work function can be electrically tunable (e.g., by Vg),20 but an important feature of graphene is that it could provide a larger, atomically flat, and well-defined interface, thereby forming a more reliable contact to Si. Owing to its one-atom thickness and low density of state near the Dirac point, graphene is also substantially permeable to an electric field when external bias is applied over graphene;11,21 however, its direct contribution to the electric potential in the Si active region is negligible compared with that driven by its change in work function. Accordingly, to realize the full benefit of the use of Vg in the SJSC, it is important to engineer the screening or penetration of an electric field through the Schottky electrode so as to manipulate not only graphene's work function, but also the electric potential of the Si active region.16,18,21 Herein, we introduced graphene and graphene mesh sheets as Schottky electrodes on n-Si SJSCs and investigated their power generation characteristics depending on the Vg applied to the cells. Compared with the SJSC with graphene, the cell with graphene mesh exhibited a higher PCE and a more sensitive response to photovoltaic parameters (e.g., the open-circuit voltage and fill factor) at Vg. The advantages of the graphene mesh can be attributed to the existence of holes that increase the work function and permeability across the electric-field, which are confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and finite element analysis (FEA) modelling, respectively.
Experimental
Graphene and graphene mesh synthesis
Graphene and graphene mesh were synthesized on 25 µm-thick Cu foils (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), following previously developed procedures.22,23 The monodisperse silica spheres with a diameter of ∼400 nm were assembled into hexagonally close-packed structures on the Cu foil surface by the Langmuir–Blodgett assembly method. The Cu foils with and without silica spheres were placed in the quartz tubular reactor that was then pumped to vacuum. The samples were annealed at 1000 °C and 500–800 mTorr with H2 gas flow for 30 min, and then methane gas was introduced as a precursor to initiate graphene growth. After 10 min of graphene growth, the tube was rapidly cooled down to room temperature. In the case of Cu foil deposited with silica spheres, we could achieve a graphene mesh structure since the graphene growth did not occur below the silica spheres. To remove the silica spheres, the graphene mesh sample was immersed in diluted 10% HF solution for 5 min. Both graphene and graphene mesh samples were coated with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) protecting layer to transfer them to device substrates (i.e., Si/SiO2 substrates).24 Before transfer, the samples were gently placed on the 50 mM ammonium persulfate solution to etch the underlying copper foils, followed by rinsing with water. Finally, the graphene (graphene mesh) coated with PMMA was moved to the target substrates, and the PMMA layer was removed by an acetone solution.
Device fabrication and measurement

Fig. 1a provides a schematic of the cell structure, in which the active region consists of bottom to top n-Si, graphene (Gr) or graphene mesh (GM), as well as ion gel gate dielectrics that are electrically connected to the bottom (B), top (T), and gate (G) electrodes, respectively. First, a 600 µm × 600 µm window was defined by removing the 300 nm-thick SiO2 on n-type Si (1–3 ohm cm−2) via photolithography and buffered oxide etching. Next, the top and gate electrodes (Ti/Au/Ti) were deposited on SiO2 around the Si window and adjacent to the window. The graphene and graphene mesh were then transferred over the Si window using the standard poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) transfer method.24 After the transfer and removal of the PMMA layer by acetone solution, chemical doping of the graphene and graphene mesh was performed by spin-casting of a AuCl3 solution.25 The bottom electrode of Ga–In eutectic alloy (99.99% Sigma-Aldrich) was made on the backside of the Si substrate. Finally, ionic-gel based on P(VDF-HFP)[EMI][TFSA] that was prepared by in situ radical polymerization of vinyl monomers was transferred over the graphene on the Si window and the side gate electrode.26 A semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent Technologies 4156C) equipped with a probe station (TTP-4, Desert Cryogenics) was used for gate voltage-dependent photocurrent measurements. During the measurement, 1 sun AM1.5G illumination with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was achieved using a solar simulator (150 W, Newport Oriel).

Results & discussion
The J–V characteristic curves of the Gr–Si SJSCs were recorded in the dark and under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 2a). The SJSCs show typical rectifying behavior in the dark, illustrating a Schottky junction formed at the graphene and Si interface. From the representative J–V curve under illuminations with no external Vg, the characteristic parameters of the short circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF) and the PCE (η) are extracted to be Jsc = 27.0 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.42 V, FF = 0.58 and η = 6.5%, respectively. The performance of this solar cell is comparable to or better than those of initial Gr–Si SJSCs (η = ∼1.5–8.6%),6,12,27 but somewhat poorer than the best devices (η = 12.4%)10 achieved with optimal interfacial oxide. When the negative Vg was applied to the cells through ionic gel; however, the J–V characteristic curves shifted right, and the performance of the cells gradually improved with increasing absolute values of Vg (Fig. 2b). At Vg = −1 V, both Voc and FF increased from 0.42 V to 0.44 V, and 0.58 to 0.61, respectively, which resulted in the PCE increase from 6.5% to 7.0%.

(c and d) J–V characteristics of the GM–Si SJSC under dark and AM1.5G illumination conditions with no external Vg (c) and under AM1.5G illumination and various Vg values (d). 
The enhancement of solar cells by the external Vg could be described by the electrical doping effect of graphene (Fig. 2b, inset).11,20,21,25 With the electrical potential applied to the graphene, its work function was tuned, which in turn modulated the Schottky junction characteristics at the graphene/Si interface. In the case of n-type Si, the negative gate bias resulted in an increase in the graphene's work function, which was positively correlated with a built-in potential and Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the junction.7,11,25 The larger built-in potential minimizes the recombination rate across the Schottky junction, thereby increasing the Voc of the Gr–Si SJSC. At the same time, the larger built-in potential widens the depletion region width that enables a more efficient collection of photo-generated carriers, which results in an increased FF. Besides the junction structure modulation by Vg, the electrical doping-induced conductivity increases in the graphene electrode may also contribute to its improvement.
We have also fabricated SJSCs by replacing the graphene with graphene mesh for the top Schottky window, while maintaining other conditions and processing under exactly the same conditions (Fig. 2c). Compared with the Gr–Si SJSC, the GM–Si SJSC showed slight decreases in the Jsc and FF from 27.0 to 26.3 mA cm−2 and from 0.58 to 0.52, respectively. This result can be attributed to the higher sheet resistance and reduced depletion area due to the presence of many holes in the graphene mesh. As a consequence, the PCE of the GM–Si SJSC (η = 5.7%) became lower than that of Gr–Si solar cells.
Given that Voc is associated with the photocarrier recombination process and edge defects act as traps or recombination centers, the Voc of the GM–Si SJSC could also be expected to be reduced substantially; however, in contrast to our expectation, there was no noticeable decline in the Voc. The result might be associated with the electrical potential change in the graphene mesh. In our previous electrical characterization, the graphene mesh field-effect transistor (FET) exhibited a more positive shift of the Dirac point (i.e., larger work-function) than that of the graphene FET, presumably owing to the edge defects.28 An increase of work function of the graphene mesh was further confirmed by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement (Fig. 3a and b). The work function is estimated by the following eqn (1) φ = hν − (Ecut-off − Ef)(1)where hν is the photon energy of the He(I) source (21.2 eV), and Ecut-off and Ef are the secondary electron cut-off energy and Fermi edge, respectively. From the UPS spectra, the work functions of graphene and graphene mesh were estimated to be 4.50 eV and 4.65 eV, respectively. Accordingly, a higher built-in potential was developed at the graphene mesh/Si junction, which compensates the negative effect by higher recombination rates due to edge defects, and eventually makes the GM–Si SJSC have a similar Voc value.

The Ecut-off values are determined by extrapolating two linear lines from the baseline and slope line in the secondary electron cut-off. With the Ecut-off, the work functions of graphene (blue) and graphene mesh (red) were estimated to be 4.50 eV and 4.65 eV, respectively.

(d) Plots of the Vg-dependent FF (closed circles) and PCE (open circles) for Gr–Si (blue) and GM–Si (red) SJSCs. 
Despite the poor performance with no Vg, the GM–Si SJSC exhibited a more rapid performance improvement with applied Vg. With increasingly negative Vg, the J–V curves shifted very sensitively to the external Vg and Voc increased substantially (Fig. 2d). Detailed comparisons of the changes in the key solar cell parameters depending on the applied Vg are displayed in Fig. 3c and d. While only slight decreases in Jsc were observed from both SJSCs, the Voc and the FF increased more rapidly in the GM–Si SJSC, compared with the case of the Gr–Si SJSC. In particular, when the GM–Si SJSC was operated with a Vg of −1 V, the Voc and the FF increased by 15% and 27%, which are ∼7 times and ∼5 times larger, respectively, than the corresponding increases seen for the Gr–Si SJSC (Fig. 2d and 3c). As a result of the steady increases in both Voc and the FF, the GM–Si SJSC showed a rapid increase in the PCE from η = 5.7% at Vg = 0 V to η = 8.1% at Vg = −1 V; not only the PCE values but also their increments were 5 times higher than that of the Gr–Si SJSC (Fig. 3d). Indeed, the PCE value is still lower than the best record of 12.4%,10 achieved from a similar device with no antireflection layer. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the PCE (Voc and FF) values increased linearly with increasing |Vg|, and were hardly saturated until Vg = −1 V, which is the practical limit of ionic gel for stable operation (Fig. 3c and d).26 This result illustrates that the cell performance could be further optimized by applying a more negative gate potential to the cells, for example, by introducing high-κ dielectric materials with higher dielectric strengths (Table 1).

The advantage of graphene mesh compared with graphene, especially driven by the rapid increment of Voc with Vg, can be understood by the different electrical potential distributions and their modulations with the external bias at the Schottky junction interfaces. To visualize the electric-field effect on the SJSCs and to explain the different response to Vg, we performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) modeling for Gr and GM electrodes on n-type Si. Fig. 4 displays the simulation results for the potential distributions under varied Vg values of 0, −0.3 V, −0.9 V and −1 V for Gr–Si (Fig. 4a) and GM–Si (Fig. 4b). An increased work function associated with the external electrical field resulted in a built-in potential (Vbi) increase at the graphene/Si junction.7,11,25 As a consequence, the depletion region becomes wide with Vbi, as its width (W) can be estimated by the following relationship:   
 Fig. 4  (a and b) FEA simulation results for Gr–Si (a) and GM–Si (b) SJSCs with an applied Vg. In the simulation, the following parameters were used for Si and dielectric material: Si (band gap: 1.1 eV, doping concentration: n-type, ND: 5 × 1015/cm3) and gate dielectric (dielectric constant: 500, thickness 10 µm). The work functions of graphene and graphene mesh were set to 4.5 eV and 4.65 eV, respectively, based on the UPS measurement. The graphene and bottom contact held at 0.3 V for all simulations.

where Vbi is the built-in potential in the Schottky junction under applied Vg; and εs and ND are the permittivity and electron carrier concentration of Si, respectively.
On the other hand, the graphene mesh has many empty holes, in which n-Si directly contacts the ion–gel dielectrics; through the hole, the external gate field directly influences the electronic potential of the Si active region, and therefore its contribution is more significant compared to the graphene region that responds indirectly to Vg (i.e., via work function modulation) owing to substantial electric-field screening.15,16 To make this point clearer, we compared the change in depletion zones, i.e., the area whose electrical potential is smaller than 4.26 eV (white dotted lines in Fig. 4), with Vg for Gr and GM electrodes on n-type Si (see Fig. S1, ESI†). With a gradually increasing negative Vg, the depletion zone widens more rapidly at the hole region compared with the graphene region, and at Vg ≈ −0.9 V, both regions have the same depletion width (Fig. 4b, third panel from left). More importantly, despite the smaller depletion area in the GM–Si junction at Vg = 0 V, its overall response to Vg is more sensitive and, at Vg ≤ −0.3 V, the total depletion area in the GM–Si overtook that in the Gr–Si (Fig. S1, ESI†). Accordingly, the more enhanced potential gradient and junction layer width suppressed the charge recombination and enhanced the power generation characteristics of the GM–Si SJSC. When the positive Vg was applied, both cells showed a decrease in the PCE values, but the GM–Si SJSC have a more sensitive response to Vg than the Gr–Si SJSC, like the cases shown under negative Vg. This can also be understood by the increased electric-field permeation via the holes and therefore by the more rapid change in the built-in potential in those regions (see Fig. S2, ESI†).
It is also noted that the devices that have initially poor performance, due to lack of optimization, exhibited more rapid advancements in their photovoltaic parameters with negative Vg (see Fig. S3, ESI†). In particular, more than 3 times enhancement in PCE (from 1.6% to 5.3%) was achieved from the GM–Si SJSC, in which the poor performance at Vg = 0 V originates from poor interface controls and the low quality of the Schottky electrodes. This result illustrates that the external bias can be exploited to compensate not only for the lower PCE value, but also for its additional degradation with time.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have exploited graphene and graphene mesh as gate-tunable Schottky contact electrodes on Si SJSCs and performed experimental and FEA modeling studies for active modulation of the photovoltaic performance. While the built-in potential and depletion layer development in the Si active region were determined mainly by the change in work function in the graphene electrode, the holes in the graphene mesh provide substantial electric-field permeability, leading to the direct modulation of electric potentials in Si. As a consequence, the GM–Si SJSC exhibited a more sensitive response of Voc and the FF to Vg, which, with additional benefit from the edge-defect induced work function change, allows it to have higher PCE values with Vg. Indeed, the PCE values were hardly saturated and increased continuously until Vg = −1 V, illustrating that there remains a lot of room for improvement via the introduction of dielectric materials with higher dielectric strength. Moreover, given that there is no power loss due to a constant Vg, this approach, which exploits the light transparent and electric-field permeable electrodes, would provide new opportunities to optimize the electrical potentials and therefore to reach the maximum theoretical efficiency limits of energy-conversion devices, such as the Shockley–Queisser limit of solar cells.29

 	Fig. 1  (a) 3-Dimensional and cross-sectional (right) schematic illustrations of the GM(Gr)–Si SJSC covered with transparent ionic gel dielectrics. (b) SEM images of graphene (left) and graphene mesh (right). A hexagonal array of circular holes with an average diameter of ∼250 nm was formed in the graphene mesh. (c) Typical Raman spectra of graphene (blue) and graphene mesh (red), which confirmed that graphene and graphene mesh are mostly monolayers. The D peak at 1338 cm−1 for graphene mesh is associated with the edge defects in holes.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a and b) J–V characteristics of the Gr–Si SJSC under dark and AM1.5G illumination conditions with no external Vg (a) and under AM1.5G illumination and the indicated Vg applied to the gate electrode (b). Vg varies in the range of 0 to −1 V, with a step size of −0.2 V for each curve. Inset: Schematic diagram of energy band modulation with external Vg. (c and d) J–V characteristics of the GM–Si SJSC under dark and AM1.5G illumination conditions with no external Vg (c) and under AM1.5G illumination and various Vg values (d).	 
φ = hν − (Ecut-off − Ef)	(1)

 	Fig. 3  (a) UPS spectra of graphene (blue) and graphene mesh (red). (b) UPS spectra of the secondary electron cut-off region. The Ecut-off values are determined by extrapolating two linear lines from the baseline and slope line in the secondary electron cut-off. With the Ecut-off, the work functions of graphene (blue) and graphene mesh (red) were estimated to be 4.50 eV and 4.65 eV, respectively. (c) Plots of Vg-dependent Jsc (closed squares) and Voc (open squares) for Gr–Si (blue) and GM–Si (red) SJSCs. (d) Plots of the Vg-dependent FF (closed circles) and PCE (open circles) for Gr–Si (blue) and GM–Si (red) SJSCs.

 	Fig. 4  (a and b) FEA simulation results for Gr–Si (a) and GM–Si (b) SJSCs with an applied Vg. In the simulation, the following parameters were used for Si and dielectric material: Si (band gap: 1.1 eV, doping concentration: n-type, ND: 5 × 1015/cm3) and gate dielectric (dielectric constant: 500, thickness 10 µm). The work functions of graphene and graphene mesh were set to 4.5 eV and 4.65 eV, respectively, based on the UPS measurement. The graphene and bottom contact held at 0.3 V for all simulations. Potential plots for diverse Vg (Vg = 0, −0.3 V, −0.9 V, −1 V) for (a) Gr–Si and (b) GM–Si.
