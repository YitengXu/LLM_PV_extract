    , Accepted 1st October 2018First published on 2nd October 2018AbstractSb-based perovskite structures have been studied as the potential materials to replace lead hybrid perovskite. However, their broad band gap makes them unsuitable for single-junction solar cells, which spurred researchers to design new strategies to narrow the band gap and broaden their photovoltaic application. Herein, a general doping strategy was designed to obtain lead-free and large size Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystals. Their crystal structures and valence states were investigated in detail by X-ray diffraction and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, revealing distinct lattice expansion, thus demonstrating the successful doping of Sn2+. After the doping of Sn2+, a significant 296 nm red-shifted light absorption peak was clearly observed, and the carrier mobility enhanced by about two-fold, as investigated by space charge-limited current (SCLC) and Hall effect measurements. The trend of the band gap determined by the first-principles calculations matches well with that of experiments. The corresponding narrowing mechanism of band gap after the doping is also revealed in detail. These extremely promising photoelectric properties of Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 shown herein motivate further exploration of their photovoltaic application.
Introduction
Since the lead-based perovskite was first reported as a light absorber on the solar cells with an efficiency of 3.8%,1 solar cells have obtained the certified efficiency of 23.3%,2 matching that of mainstream multi-crystalline silicon.3,4 The high performance of lead based perovskite solar cells arises from their ideal band gap, long electron–hole diffusion lengths, low recombination rates, low trap density and low-temperature process ability, which lead to the promise of both high efficiency and ultra-low fabrication cost.5–12 Despite the high efficiency of these lead-based perovskite solar cells, the problems associated with such cells, such as the toxic nature of lead and the instability of devices, have hindered their optoelectronic applications and led to a new research direction that focuses on lead-free and high stability perovskite materials.12
Significant efforts have been made, and a new class of photovoltaics perovskite materials have been discovered, such as Sn-based perovskites including MASnI3 and FASnI3 with the low band gap of around 1.10–1.4 eV13–15 and the toxin-free Bi-based materials with high stability, tunable bandgaps and solution processability.17,18 However, the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in Sn-based perovskites12,16 and the high exciton binding energies of A3Bi2X9 that lead to the low short-circuit current densities (Jsc) and low photo conversion efficiencies (PCEs, ca. 1%)19–21 suggest that these materials cannot be widely used for photovoltaics applications. A few recent reports on Sb-based perovskite structures have demonstrated the materials to be worthy for further exploration with the champion efficiency of over 2.77%,21 thus presenting a promising replacement for Pb-based perovskites as photoabsorbers. However, the broad band gap of the Sb-based perovskites hinders their further applications in single-junction solar cells.22,23
Herein, a novel structure of Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystal was designed to narrow the band gap and expand their optoelectronic application. The characterization techniques including powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction, and UV-vis spectroscopy, were used to elucidate their intrinsic structures and optoelectronic properties. After doping of Sn2+, the band gap decreased significantly with an enhancement of carrier mobility and shortening of response time of photodetector, thus exhibiting a great potential application in photovoltaics and other optoelectronics devices.
Results and discussion
The black and shiny large size MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystals (Fig. 1) were grown by a hydrothermal process at 220 °C for 24 h. The SEM image indicated the layered growth of Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 with Sn2+ successfully doped, as observed in their mapping image in Fig. S1.† The content of Sn2+ was also demonstrated by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry measurement (Table S1†). The similar single crystals of Sn-doped MA3Bi2I9 were also obtained, as shown in Fig. S2, S3.†

Corresponding powder X-ray diffraction patterns of these crystals confirmed the pure perovskite phase of both the single crystals, as shown in Fig. 2. All the XRD diffraction patterns match well with the calculated XRD patterns (Fig. 2a and c). After doping with Sn2+, the crystal structure did not change and did not form MASnI3, but a small shift in the XRD peaks toward the smaller angle region is clearly observed, which is similar to that of Sn-doped MA3Bi2I9 (Fig. S4†). In addition, an increase in lattice parameters was demonstrated due to the larger ionic radius of Sn2+. The same phenomenon can also be observed clearly from the calculated XRD patterns and their XRD patterns of thin films, as shown in Fig. 2c–d and Fig. S5.† The existence of Sn2+ can also be demonstrated by the XPS map shown in Fig. 2e–f. As we know, the peak assigned to Sn element was deconvoluted into two main peaks; the peaks at 486.3 eV and 487.3 eV are associated with Sn2+ and Sn4+, respectively. Furthermore, the Sn 3d5/2 peak at 486.3 eV demonstrated the oxidation state of Sn2+. Good air stability was also exhibited by the perovskite, even in the presence of Sn2+, as shown in Fig. S6.†

X-ray diffraction studies indicate that both the crystal structure of MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 belong to the hexagonal P63/mmc space group rather than the cubic Pmm space group of MASnI3.13 The ball-and-stick diagrams of their crystal structures are shown in Fig. 3, with the deepening colour of the micro size single crystals observed clearly after doping with Sn2+. C and N atoms in the C/N structural unit present the disorder phenomenon so that the distribution of C and N atoms is random around the C–N bond. The related single-crystal parameters are presented in Table S2,† with larger parameters and volume of Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 compared with those of pristine MA3Sb2I9. This result matches well with the XRD patterns of Fig. 2, further demonstrating the existence of Sn2+. Moreover, we also obtained the similar crystal structure of hexagonal P63/mmc space group24 for MA3Bi2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Bi2I9, as shown in Fig. S7.† The lattice expansions may lead to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces and further improves the open circuit voltage and fill factor.25 Consequently, the photovoltaic performance of MA3Sb2I9 may also improve.

The UV/Vis/NIR diffuse reflectance spectra of Sn doped MA3Sb2I9 powder reflect the broader absorption area directly than that of MA3Sb2I9, as given in the Fig. S8,† which indicated a significant red-shifted light absorption peak of Sn doped MA3Sb2I9. Similar phenomenon was also displayed from MA3Bi2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Bi2I9 (Fig. S9†). It is known that light harvesting in the region beyond 800 nm (near-infrared region: NIR region) is necessary to realize high-efficiency tandem perovskite solar cells.26 Thus, the Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 exhibit a great potential application than MA3Sb2I9 in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. In order to determine the trend of the band gap and the mechanism of band gap narrowing of MA3Sb2I9 after the doping of Sn2+, we performed first-principles calculations,27,28 as shown in Fig. 4. Based on our experimental data, the crystal structure of the intrinsic MA3Sb2I9 was constructed. The lattice constants from DFT calculations are in good agreement with the experimental values (a = 8.32 vs. 8.55 Å and c = 22.37 vs. 21.53 Å). Sn2+ doping was introduced to the intrinsic MA3Sb2I9 by replacing one of the four Sb atoms with an Sn atom in the unit cell. The geometrically optimized structures of the intrinsic MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 are depicted in Fig. 4a. The electronic properties of intrinsic MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 were studied using hybrid functional calculations. A widely used method to correct band gaps using hybrid functional calculations is to find the percent contribution of the Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange that reproduces the experimental results.29 To determine the HF exchange that reproduces the experimental results, we conducted hybrid functional calculations of MA3Sb2I9 with the HF exchange contribution set as 0, 7, and 25%, respectively. The ideal HF exchange contribution was found to be 5.4% (see Fig. 4b), which reproduced the experimental band gap of MA3Sb2I9 (1.92 eV). A 5.4% contribution was also adopted to conduct the hybrid functional calculation of the Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 in order to ensure consistency. It is known that the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects of 5th row post-transition metals (e.g. Sn, Sb) are much weaker than that of 6th row counterparts (e.g. Pb, Bi). Thus, the weak SOC effects of Sn and Sb allow us to predict reliable band gaps without including SOC effects. The calculated band structures of the intrinsic MA3Sb2I9 and the Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 are shown in Fig. 4c. The band gaps of the intrinsic MA3Sb2I9 and the Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 were predicted to be 1.92 eV and 1.43 eV, respectively. Sn doping significantly reduced the band gap of the MA3Sb2I9 crystal, showing good agreement with the trend of experimental results. The total and partial densities of states (DOS) plots of these two scenarios are shown in Fig. 4d. The lower part of the conduction bands of both crystals are formed by the antibonding state of Sb 5p and I 5p orbits. The upper part of the valence bands of the intrinsic MA3Sb2I9 are formed by the bonding state of Sb 5s and I 5p orbits. In comparison, the upper part of the valence bands of the Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 is composed of the bonding state of Sn 5s and I 5p orbits, resulting in a decrease in the band gap.

The percent contribution of HF exchange that reproduces the experimental band gap is indicated by the dashed lines. (c) The calculated band structures of the intrinsic MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9. (d) Total density of states and partial density of states of the intrinsic MA3Sb2I9 (top) and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 (bottom). 
The trap-state density (ntrap) and the carrier mobility (μ, μ = μp ≈ μn, where μp and μn are the hole and electron mobility, respectively) of MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystals were estimated according to the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model, as shown in Fig. 5(a, b).26,30–32 With the increase in bias voltage, ohmic and quadratic regions are clearly separated, where the kink point is the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), determined by the defect density,32 as follows (eqn (1)): (1)where e is elementary charge, nt is defect density, L is the thickness of MA3Sb2I9 (0.53 mm) and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 (0.80 mm), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the relative dielectric constant.

(b) Dark current–voltage curve of Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystal for space charge limited current analysis. The value of frequency, capacity, dielectric constant, trap-state density (ntrap) and the carrier mobility (μ) are listed in the following Table 1. (c, d) Mobility and resistivity measurements of MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystal by Hall effect at room temperature. 
Both the defect density of MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystals were estimated to be in the order of 1010 cm−3 using relative dielectric constant under different frequencies. The defect density of MA3Bi2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Bi2I9 single crystals are shown in Fig. S10 and Table S3.† The carrier mobility of MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 were also estimated according to the Mott–Gurney's power law:33 (2)where JD, ε, ε0, μ, Vb, and L are the dark current, the relative dielectric constant, the vacuum permittivity, the mobility of single crystals, the applied voltage, and the thickness of the single crystal, respectively. Clearly, the mobility values of Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 are larger than that of MA3Sb2I9. The detailed values of both the single crystals under the different frequency are listed in Table 1. The trap density and higher mobility values are also supported by the Hall effect measurements (Fig. S11† and Fig. 5c), which match well with the estimation of SCLC. Moreover, after the dopant of Sn2+, the resistivity (rho) of MA3Sb2I9 also reduced, as shown in the Hall effect measurements in Fig. 5d.

The improvement in the photoelectric properties can also be demonstrated by the dark current–voltage (I–V) curves of their thin films, as shown in Fig. S12(a, b).† Clearly, the current increased by one order of magnitude after the doping of Sn2+, which matched well with their resistivity obtained via Hall effect measurements. Moreover, the photo-response properties were estimated, as shown in Fig S12(c–f),† indicating an enhancement in photoelectric properties of Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9.
The MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystals also exhibit good thermostability, which was determined by the thermogravimetric analysis. Fig. S13(a–c)† show the TGA and DSC curves of the single crystals. The decomposition temperatures of both MA3Sb2I9 and Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 single crystals are about 250 °C, which is higher than that of MASnI3. Thus, the decomposition temperature of the perovskite did not reduce after Sn2+ doping, indicating that Sn-doped MA3Sb2I9 exhibits good thermal stability. The DSC at low temperatures ranging from 100 K to 400 K was also measured to determine the phase transition temperature, as shown in Fig. S13(d–f).† It can be clearly observed that there are two distinct phase changes for MA3Sb2I9 single crystals at about 150 K and 200 K and one for MASnI3 at about 135 K. However, after the doping with Sn2+, the phase transformation point of MA3Sb2I9 disappeared. The detailed reason for this finding needs to be further researched.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated a great improvement in the optoelectronic properties of the MA3Sb2I9 single crystals by the doping with Sn2+. Detailed characterizations, including the EDS, XPS, XRD, UV-Vis spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and space charge-limited current (SCLC) and Hall effect measurements were used to confirm the existence of Sn2+ and discuss the narrow band gap and higher carrier mobility. Upon combining with the theoretical investigations, the mechanism of band gap narrowing of MA3Sb2I9 after the doping with Sn2+ was revealed. This study provides a simple technique for the band engineering of single crystals, resulting in much improved optoelectronic properties, such as narrow band gap and higher carrier mobility. We believe that such improved properties have potential applications in photovoltaic and other optoelectronic devices.
