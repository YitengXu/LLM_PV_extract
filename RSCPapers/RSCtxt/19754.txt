    , Accepted 18th June 2015First published on 19th June 2015AbstractTwo hexacyclic lactam building blocks, TD1 and TD2, and four D–A copolymers have been developed. Compared with thiophene copolymers, selenophene analogues PSeTD1 and PSeTD2 possess medium optical bandgaps, better packing, higher hole mobilities, enhanced EQE, and higher Jsc. Inverted PSeTD2:PC71BM solar cells exhibited a decent PCE of 8.18%, which is a record for D–A copolymers using selenophene as the donor unit.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have advantages such as low cost, flexibility, lightweight, and easy fabrication.1 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs are determined by three parameters: open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). Voc is proportional to the difference between the HOMO energy levels of the donor materials and the LUMO energy levels of the acceptor materials.2Jsc correlates with sunlight harvesting capability, charge carrier mobility, and morphology of the active layers.3 Charge carrier mobility and lifetime as well as morphology affect FF significantly.3,4 Polycyclic D–A copolymers are promising donor materials because of their extended conjugation length, reduced bandgap, enhanced π-electron delocalization, strong π–π stacking, and high hole mobility.5 As a result, polycyclic D–A copolymers can achieve high PCEs via increasing Jsc and FF and maintaining high Voc. However, many efforts have been focused on polycyclic donor units, and excellent polycyclic acceptor units are rare, such as naphthobisthiadiazole, naphthobistriazole, isoindigo, pyridophenanthridine, and dihydropyrroloindoledione.6
Recently, a pentacyclic lactam acceptor unit thieno[2′,3′:5,6]pyrido[3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]-isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione (TPTI) was first reported by our group.7 D–A copolymer PThTPTI possesses good light absorption, a deep HOMO energy level, partial crystallinity, and good hole-transporting properties.7a However, the photovoltaic performance was limited by a moderate optical bandgap of 1.86 eV with an absorption onset of 666 nm. Further lowering the bandgap and widening the absorption spectra favour harvesting more photons and enhancing the efficiency. Hence, two bigger hexacyclic lactam acceptor units TD1 and TD2 with extended conjugation length were developed (Scheme 1). The new units can be regarded as the derivatives of TPTI by replacing the benzene ring with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT). Fusing rigid and coplanar TT into conjugated building blocks can extend the effective conjugation length, leading to lower optical bandgaps.8 Moreover, the ordered packing and strong interchain interactions caused by TT can improve charge carrier mobility, which is beneficial to high Jsc.9 Another effective strategy to reduce bandgaps is replacing thiophene with selenophene. Compared with the sulfur atom (2.58), the selenium atom possesses smaller electronegativity (2.55), therefore selenophene exhibits lower aromatic resonance energy (1.25 eV) than that of thiophene (1.26 eV) and stronger electron-donating capability, leading to longer effective conjugation length and reduced optical bandgap.10 The larger, easily polarizable Se atom and the strong intermolecular Se⋯Se interaction can facilitate interchain charge transfer, thus enhancing hole mobility.11 In a word, replacing thiophene with selenophene can increase Jsc and FF, stabilize Voc, thus enhancing PCEs. In this work, four D–A copolymers PThTD1, PSeTD1, PThTD2, and PSeTD2 using TD1 or TD2 as acceptor units and thiophene (Th) or selenophene (Se) as donor units were developed (Fig. 1). Solar cells based on selenophene polymers exhibit higher PCEs than the cells based on thiophene polymers, and the inverted PSeTD2:PC71BM solar cells exhibit a decent PCE of 8.18%.

The centrosymmetric TD1 and TD2 were constructed by six fused aromatic rings with a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene at the center, two thiophenes at the end, and two pyridones as the bridges. In order to endow monomers and polymers with good solubility, 2-octyldodecyl (OD) or 2-hexyldecyl (HD) as side chains were introduced onto TD1 or TD2, respectively. As shown in Scheme 1, monomer synthesis started from bromination of diethyl thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-3,6-dicarboxylate (1).12 Compound 2 was hydrolyzed to produce compound 3, which reacted with oxalyl chloride, and then with N-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-3-amine or N-(2-hexyldecyl)thiophen-3-amine to produce 4a or 4b, respectively. TD1 or TD2 was obtained via intramolecular coupling reaction. In 1H NMR spectra, two double peaks at 7.51–7.12 ppm confirm the chemical structures of TD1 and TD2 (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Monomers TD1-Br and TD2-Br were synthesized via bromination of TD1 or TD2, respectively. Polymerization of TD1-Br or TD2-Br with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene or 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)selenophene using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst in toluene refluxing for 24 h afforded four target copolymers. The crude products were purified by Soxhlet extraction sequentially with methanol and hexane to remove monomers and low MW polymers, followed by extraction with chloroform. The chloroform extract was concentrated and added dropwise into methanol to precipitate the polymers. All polymers possess good solubility in common organic solvents at room temperature, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, and toluene. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PThTD1, PSeTD1, PThTD2, and PSeTD2 are 58.1, 70.8, 33.2, and 35.5 kDa, with PDI of 5.78, 3.58, 4.41, and 2.63, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). The decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% wt loss) of the four polymers are 439, 429, 442, and 443 °C, respectively, suggesting excellent thermal stability for solar cell applications (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The absorption spectra for polymers PThTD1, PSeTD1, PThTD2, and PSeTD2 in chloroform and as thin films are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†) and Fig. 2, and the corresponding optical data are listed in Table 1. The polymers show two absorption peaks both in solution and in the solid state. In solution, four polymers showed long-wavelength absorption peaks at 617, 632, 619, and 637 nm, while in solid state the long-wavelength peaks locate at 630, 651, 629, and 656 nm, respectively, displaying red shifts of 13, 19, 10, and 19 nm, respectively. Selenophene-based polymers exhibited remarkable red-shifts, which might be due to stronger π–π stacking.11 Selenophene-based polymers PSeTD1 and PSeTD2 possess narrower optical bandgaps of 1.75 eV than thiophene analogues (1.82 eV).

The electrochemical properties of the four polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and all potentials were corrected against Fc/Fc+ (Fig. S5, ESI†). The energy levels of the polymers were calculated according to the empirical formulas: HOMO or LUMO = −(Eonsetox or Eonsetred + 4.8) eV.13 All polymers exhibited similar HOMO energy levels of −5.36 to −5.30 eV. PSeTD1 and PSeTD2 showed deeper LUMO energy levels (−2.70 and −2.74 eV) than PThTD1 and PThTD2 (−2.56 and −2.63 eV) (Table 1). The bandgap reduction for PSeTD1 and PSeTD2 results from the lowering of their LUMO energy levels.
Solar cells with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were firstly investigated. The best devices for the four polymers had a D/A ratio of 1:0.8 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 110–125 nm, 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive in chlorobenzene, and took no thermal annealing. PThTD1, PSeTD1, PThTD2 and PSeTD2 solar cells exhibited PCEs of 5.95%, 6.03%, 6.86% and 7.73%, respectively (Fig. S6 and Table S14, ESI†). Inverted solar cells with a structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were also fabricated using the optimized conditions for conventional cells. The J–V curves and EQE spectra for the best cells are shown in Fig. 3 and the performance data are listed in Table 2. High Voc in the range of 0.83–0.87 V were obtained for all solar cells due to the deep HOMO energy levels. Inverted cells exhibited higher PCEs than conventional cells because of enhanced Jsc, which results from higher transmittance of ZnO.14 The polymers with shorter side chains exhibited higher efficiencies (6.90% for PThTD2 and 8.18% for PSeTD2) than the polymers with longer side chains (6.02% for PThTD1 and 6.22% for PSeTD1). Shorter side chains favour polymer backbone packing, leading to higher hole mobility and photocurrent.15 Compared with thiophene analogues, selenophene-based polymers show enhanced EQE (Fig. 3b). The best inverted PSeTD2:PC71BM solar cells exhibited a PCE of 8.18%, with a Jsc of 13.55 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 V, a FF of 71.06%, and over 65% EQE at 471–668 nm. 8.18% is the highest PCE for D–A copolymers using selenophene as the donor unit.16 The integrated photocurrents from the EQE spectra are 9.33, 10.73, 11.43 and 12.90 mA cm−2 for PThTD1, PSeTD1, PThTD2 and PSeTD2, respectively, which are consistent with those from the J–V measurements.

Morphologies of the blend films were studied using an atomic force microscope (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†), DIO addition can effectively reduce the surface roughness for all blend films. The RMS roughnesses were reduced from 5.89 nm to 2.08 nm for the PThTD2:PC71BM blend film, and from 6.28 nm to 2.57 nm for the PSeTD2:PC71BM blend film. PThTD2:PC71BM and PSeTD2:PC71BM blend films without a DIO additive show large domains (Fig. 4a and c), which significantly reduce the D/A interface, and are unfavorable for exciton dissociation, leading to low Jsc and FF (Tables S10 and S13, ESI†). PThTD2:PC71BM and PSeTD2:PC71BM blend films with DIO show ideal phase separation with sufficient D/A interfaces. The bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the blend films favors exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport, enhancing Jsc and FF.

The mobilities for the blend films were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S9, ESI†). The hole mobilities for PThTD1, PSeTD1, PThTD2 and PSeTD2 are 4.06 × 10−4, 9.79 × 10−4, 5.98 × 10−4 and 2.53 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. To further understand high hole mobilities for selenophene polymers, the polymer films were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). All polymers exhibited two diffraction peaks at 3.97–4.58° and ∼25° (Fig. S10 and Table S15, ESI†). The diffraction peaks at ∼25° indicated that the d-spacing for π–π stacking for all polymers is ∼3.55 Å. The interlayer d-spacings for PThTD1 and PSeTD1 (∼22 Å) are longer than those for PThTD2 and PSeTD2 (∼19.4 Å), which might be due to the longer side chains (OD vs. HD).17 Selenophene polymers, especially PSeTD2, possess better lamellar packing than thiophene polymers, explaining well the higher hole mobilities for PSeTD1:PC71BM and PSeTD2:PC71BM blend films.
In conclusion, four D–A copolymers based on novel fused-ring acceptor units have been developed. These materials possess good solubility, medium optical bandgaps, and low HOMO energy levels. An 8.18% PCE was obtained from inverted PSeTD2:PC71BM solar cells, which is a record for D–A copolymers using selenophene as the donor unit. Our results indicate that extending the conjugation length of the acceptor units and replacing the thiophene donor unit with the selenophene unit can effectively reduce the optical bandgaps of D–A copolymers and enhance solar cell performance synergistically.
