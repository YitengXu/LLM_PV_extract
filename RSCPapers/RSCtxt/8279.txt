    , Accepted 13th April 2019First published on 18th April 2019AbstractEffective assembly of perovskite quantum dots is a huge challenge to develop high-performance optoelectronic devices with large scale integration functionality. Here, we demonstrate a facile way to fabricate one-dimensional arrays consisting of aligned perovskite quantum dots and their remarkable application as high-performance photodetectors. All inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) quantum dots, synthesized by a hot injection method, are precisely assembled into the one-dimensional arrays using a liquid bridge induced assembly strategy. Systematic studies have shown that photodetectors based on such one-dimensional CsPbI3 quantum dot arrays have excellent performance in terms of high responsivity and high detection sensitivity. It is suggested that the availability of more oxygen-rich hole trapping states on the surface of the quantum dots play an important role in the photocurrent generation. This work presents a significant step forward towards scalable self-assembly of perovskite quantum dots into one-dimensional arrays, indicating an enormous potential in manufacturing of high-performance integrated optoelectronic sensor circuitry.
1. Introduction
All inorganic hybrid perovskites, especially CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), have attracted much attention in recent times because of their excellent photoelectronic properties and much needed low-cost production processes.1–5 The promising applications for various photoelectronic devices, such as light emitting diodes, lasers, solar cells, and photodetectors, have been extensively studied.6–9 The large-scale growth or assembly of horizontally aligned semiconductor 1D nanowires (NWs) is highly desirable for next-generation integrated photonic and dissipationless electronic devices. The ultra-long directional growth of CsPbX3 NWs is an important step in their integration into practical devices, but it is still a great challenge. Recently, ultralong organic–inorganic perovskite 1D nanowires have been synthesized by a combination of template and solution methods.10,11 However, the ultra-long directional solution growth of all-inorganic perovskite nanowires is difficult due to the lower solubility of inorganic perovskites and the more complex Cs–Pb–X phase diagram problems. Nonetheless, perovskite CsPbBr3 1D NWs with a diameter of several hundred nanometers and a length of several millimeters are obtained by controlled growth of in-plane orientation by a graphoepitaxial effect.
Recent studies have shown that the surface states on semiconductor 1D NWs can cause significant band bending. This induces separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby significantly extending the carrier lifetime and achieving high photocurrent performance.12,13 However, most of the research on nanowire photodetectors is based on single crystal nanowires, which is only suitable to achieve radial modulation of the band edge on a limited surface. In these cases, the conduction and valence band edges are still flat in the axial direction. This provides a fast path for carrier transport when an external electric field is applied, increasing the recombination of electrons and holes. This inevitably leads to high dark currents and small gain, thus limiting the device performance.
Perovskite QDs have the advantages of a low cost and simple synthesis method, and importantly, their bandgap can be expediently adjusted by controlling the halide composition or by quantum size effects, covering the entire visible spectrum (400–800 nm).14–22 In addition, the lead halide perovskite QDs exhibit comparable photoluminescence quantum yield, narrower full width at half maximum and wider color gamut than the conventional Cd-based QDs. Compared with the perovskite 1D NW, the perovskite QDs have a larger specific surface area and active surface states. But the question of how to effectively assemble the perovskite quantum dots into micro-integrated photoelectronic devices is a huge challenge. The capillary bridge is a universal phenomenon observed between two neighbouring solid surfaces in nature. The capillary bridges can dominate the self-organization of mesoscale pillars into ordered, hierarchical helical assemblies.23–25 We have previously successfully demonstrated free-standing 1D assemblies of gold nanoparticles by a combined top-down and bottom-up approach in conjunction with the capillary bridge.26
Here, we present a high-efficiency, liquid bridge induced assembly (LBIA) method, which can fabricate one-dimensional aligned perovskite quantum dot arrays. We also show that different all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots can be assembled into aligned one-dimensional quantum dot arrays. After arranging the CsPbI3 quantum dots, the photoelectric detection characteristics of the devices are systematically studied, revealing their excellent performance, including responsiveness and detection sensitivity. Our technique provides a versatile approach to perovskite quantum dots with designable structure for future photoelectronic applications.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Materials and chemicals
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.995% trace metal basis), lead(II) chloride (PbCl2, 99.999% trace metal basis), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.999% trace metal basis), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999% trace metal basis), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%, technical grade), oleylamine (OLA, 70%, technical grade), diisooctylphosphinic acid (DPA, 90%, technical grade), and toluene (99.5%, analytical reagent), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Isopropanol (IPA, 99.5%, analytical reagent) was purchased from Merck. All reagents were used without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of Cs precursor solution
The reaction was carried out using a standard Schlenk line. Cs2CO3 (0.1 g, 307 μmol) was suspended in a solution of ODE (5 mL) and DPA (0.5 mL) in a 50 mL three-neck flask, and heated to 120 °C under vacuum with magnetic stirring. The solution was degassed for 1 h at the target temperature. The suspension was then heated to 140 °C under N2, with the temperature then maintained until all Cs2CO3 had fully dissolved. The solution was then kept at 100 °C before use.
2.3 Synthesis of CsPbI3 solution
The reaction was carried out using a standard Schlenk line. 188 μmol PbX2 (50 mg for PbCl2, 70 mg for PbBr2, 87 mg for PbI2) was suspended in a solution of ODE (5 mL), DPA (0.5 mL), and OLA (0.5 mL) in a 50 mL three-neck flask, and heated to 120 °C under vacuum with magnetic stirring, with the temperature maintained for 1 h. In the case of PbCl2, the volume of DPA and OLA was doubled for a full dissolution. After the dissolution of the PbX2, the temperature of the reaction solution was increased to 140 °C under N2. Then, 0.4 mL of the preheated Cs precursor solution was injected into the reaction solution, and after 5 s the flask was submerged in a water bath to quench the reaction. The crude solution was stored under ambient conditions for future use. The crude CsPbX3 solution in ODE was mixed with anti-solvent IPA in a 1:3 ODE:IPA volume ratio. The mixture was then centrifuged for 5 min at 10000 rpm in a Beckman Coulter Allegra™ X-22R centrifuge. The clear supernatant was discarded and the CsPbX3 precipitate was re-dispersed in toluene for characterization and device fabrication.
2.4 Fabrication of microgroove-structured template
The microgroove-structured template was fabricated on nitrogen-doped 〈100〉 oriented silicon wafers using a direct laser writing device (Heidelberg DWL200) followed by deep reactive ion etching. The whole process of fabricating the microgroove-structured template can be found in our early study.27
2.5 Characterization
UV-Vis absorbance spectra for suspensions of QDs in toluene were collected using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer. Photoluminescence spectra for suspensions of QDs in toluene were collected using a Horiba Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer. Samples were prepared for PXRD measurements by depositing suspensions of NCs in toluene on a glass substrate and heating the substrate at 80° to evaporate the toluene. XRD patterns were acquired on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using a Cu source (Kα = 1.54 Å) at 40 kV, 40 mA, and a LynxEye detector. TEM images and selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern were obtained on a FEI Tecnai G2 T20 transmission electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 electron source operated at 200 kV. Images were acquired by either a Gatan Orius SC200D CCD camera or a Gatan Orius SC600 CCD camera. Fluorescence microscopy image characterizations were carried out by Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (Nikon Instrument A1Rsi) coupled with three solid-state lasers to cover the three types of perovskites QDs of 405 nm, 488 nm, and 635 nm. Optical properties including the PL spectra and mapping were characterized through the WITec confocal microscope system (alpha 300R) with a 50× objective lens (NA = 0.6) at ambient environment. Specifically, the PL spectra and mapping were excited and collected by a 532 nm laser using the piezo-crystal-controlled scanning stage. This micro-confocal setup with a 532 nm laser was also employed to excite the photoresponse of a single perovskite nanowire device. The source meter unit (Agilent, B2902A) was used to measure the photoelectric response data of the perovskite devices at room temperature under ambient conditions.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the schematic diagram of a LBIA strategy for aligned perovskite quantum dots. High-quality perovskite QDs dispersed in an organic solvent were sandwiched between a metal electrode coated substrate and a microgroove-structured silicon template (Fig. 1a and b). Within this structure, the organic solvent evaporated, leading to the rapture of the liquid film. As a result, regular “liquid tails” within the precise positions in the corners between the microgroove sidewalls and the supporting substrate were generated. The positions of these “liquid tails” are dominated by the microgrooves, endowing the patterning with different perovskite quantum dots. After further dewetting of these “liquid tails”, the assembly of the perovskite QDs happened along the solid–liquid–gas triphase contact line. As a result, 1D perovskite QD arrays could be fabricated by the LIBA strategy, yielding the potential to serve as high-performance photodetectors.
 Fig. 1  A liquid bridge induced assembly (LBIA) strategy to align perovskite quantum dots (QDs) in one direction upon the on-desired substrates. (a and b) A metal electrode coated substrate was horizontally placed. Then, the perovskite QD suspension was gradually released onto a metal electrode coated substrate and covered by a microgroove-structured silicon template, forming a sandwich type assembly system. (c) The organic solvent evaporated, allowing a linear-shaped micropillar array serving as defects of wetting. In this case, the QD solution would be ruptured regularly, leading to parallel “liquid tails” within precise positions in the corners between microgroove sidewalls and the supporting substrate. Each “liquid tail” can serve as a size-reducing confined space for the QD aggregation. Finally, the QDs could be closely packed to form the linear assembled arrays upon the supporting substrate. (d) After peeling off the microgroove-structured template carefully, the 1D QD assemblies with precise positions can be fabricated accordingly, serving as highly sensitive photodetectors. 
The CsPbX3 perovskite QDs were synthesized by following our previously reported hot-injection synthesis technique.1 In short, the PbX2 and Cs2CO3 precursors were dissolved separately in the solvent (octadecene) with the help of two ligands (diisooctylphosphinic acid, oleylamine) at an elevated temperature, then the Cs precursor was injected into the Pb solution, yielding the CsPbX3 perovskite QDs. The perovskite QDs were then precipitated out from its crude solution by using IPA as the antisolvent and separated through centrifugation, and finally redispersed in toluene for future usage.
The TEM images (i.e.Fig. 2a and b) indicate that the corresponding average sizes of the CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 QDs were 10.6, 11.0, and 10.2 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2d–f, the XRD spectra were then carried out to examine the crystal phase of the perovskite QDs, all three perovskite QD samples were found to adopt cubic phases at room temperature. Moreover, the broadening of the XRD peaks provided evidence of their nano-crystalline nature.3 The UV-Vis absorption and PL measurements showed that the perovskite QDs have a halide composition dependent band gap, with the emission wavelengths located at 400 nm, 505 nm and 680 nm for the CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 in Fig. 2g–i, respectively. This is consistent with the band edge energy of the perovskite QDs being largely determined by the Pb and X orbital interactions.2 The perovskite QDs exhibited emission widths of 11 nm, 26 nm and 37 nm for the Cl, Br and I, respectively.

The XRD patterns of CsPbCl3 (d), CsPbBr3 (e), and CsPbI3 (f) QDs, together with standard JCPDS cards, respectively. The absorption and PL spectra of CsPbCl3 (g), CsPbBr3 (h), and CsPbI3 (i) QDs, the inserts are the photographs of the perovskite and methylbenzene dispersion system. 
The as-prepared inorganic perovskite QDs were assembled on the SiO2/Si substrate by the LBIA strategy. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 3a) and optical image (Fig. 3c) show that the well-ordered, uniform-sized, large-area (100 × 100 μm2) aligned perovskites 1D QDs deposited in large-scale 1D arrays with strict alignment and with microscopic separation of ≈4 μm, which is consistent with the geometric parameters of the microgroove design. The high-magnification SEM image (Fig. 3b) presents a single nanowire assembled from the quantum dots. The nanowires have a width of approximately 250 nm. The aligned quantum dots with cubic shapes were not altered as compared to the as-synthesized quantum dots.

As shown in Fig. 3c, the point-to-point PL mapping and random PL spectrum indicate that the assembled quantum dots still retain strong luminescence properties. This confirmed that the quality of quantum dots was not affected during the LBIA process. Furthermore, we extended the LBIA strategy to different inorganic perovskite quantum dots. The fluorescence microscopy images of the aligned 1D QD arrays using these different perovskites are sequentially presented in Fig. 4. The fluorescence microscopy images of these QD arrays showed significant fluorescence emission excited by three solid-state lasers of 405 nm, 488 nm, and 635 nm, respectively. This verified that the LBIA strategy to assemble the perovskite quantum dots with universal feasibility, thus laying the foundation for the subsequent perovskite 1D QD photoelectronic devices.

Fig. 5a shows an example of the fabricated 1D perovskite QD array photodetector device with a single wire illuminated by a 532 nm confocal laser. It should be noted that the number of 1D perovskite QD channels is controllable by the length of the gold electrodes and the density of the 1D QDs is determined by the silicon mold as described in the capillary-mediated assembly process. In this device fabrication, the inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 QDs solution was drop-casted onto a pre-deposited gold electrode, followed by the molding process by a one-dimensional silicon microgroove. The well-assembled perovskite 1D QDs made via the capillary-bridge mediation demonstrates the feasibility of aligning perovskite QDs into 1D directly on the electrode patterns, paving the way for future scalable manufacturing of perovskite photodetectors, particularly compatible with the lithography-sensitive organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.

(b) The current–voltage curves of the 1D QD photodetector under dark and 532 nm laser illumination of 4.2 nW. (c) The time-dependent photoresponse of a single 1D QD photodetector under 532 nm laser irradiance with intensity of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 3.0, 4.2, and 5.4 nW at +4 V bias voltage. 
To examine the electrical and photoelectronic properties of the as-fabricated perovskite 1D QDs devices, we first measured the current–voltage characteristics of a single perovskite 1D QD under dark and illumination conditions at room temperature, as plotted in Fig. 5b. In the dark condition, the perovskite 1D QD was almost nonconductive with a small current in the magnitude of 10−11 at +4 V bias, which could be ascribed to the polycrystalline morphology of the 1D QD assembled from the individual QDs with insulating surface surfactants. By contrast, the current of the device increased greatly after the illumination of merely one of the 1D QDs with a green confocal laser over the wide channel of 25 μm. It is expected that the illumination of more parallel perovskite 1D QDs would drastically enhance the magnitude of the collected photocurrent. Another feature observed in the current–voltage curves is that the photocurrent generation of the perovskite 1D QDs device showed a threshold voltage, implying a potential energy gap existing between the individual QD contact interfaces. It should be noted that the non-ohmic contact and Schottky barrier at the perovskite/Au contact may also contribute to the nonlinear current–voltage curves, which are commonly seen in perovskite photodetectors. However, in our perovskite nanowires that are assembled from individual quantum dots, we believe the threshold voltage mainly arises from band-bending within individual crystals. We will explain this photocurrent generation mechanism further in the next section.

Fig. 5c shows the time-dependent photoresponse of the single perovskite 1D QD photodetector, measured by periodically switching a 532 nm confocal laser. It is evident that the photocurrent can easily turn on and off with good repeatability with a wide intensity response range. For example, a photocurrent on/off change of the perovskite 1D QD photodetector can be clearly distinguished with several cycles under 0.6 nW laser illumination.
To quantify the light detecting performance, the photocurrent (Iph) and responsivity (R) were calculated with the change of the incident laser power, as plotted in Fig. 6a. While Iph = Ilight − Idark, measured at different laser intensities, R is determined by the photocurrent generated by the laser shining on the active area of the 1D QD, that is,R = Iph/(Plight·A),where A is the effective area under the laser and Plight is the laser power.28 The photocurrent versus laser power shows a nearly linear increasing trend, with a maximum responsivity of ≈60 mA W−1 obtained at +4 V bias. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the perovskite 1D QD device is further calculated by the equation below.EQE = hcR/(eλ),where h is the Planck constant, c is the velocity of light, e is an electron charge, and λ is the light wavelength, respectively. The resulting peak EQE of the perovskite 1D QD photodetector reached ≈14%, indicating the efficient conversion from incident photons to carriers in the QD-assembled structure. We note that the photodetection efficiency is relatively moderate in comparison with the reported values of perovskite photodetectors, mainly due to the small illumination area being limited to a single laser spot in a single nanowire. However, the responsivity and EQE here are still in the comparable level of several perovskite photodetectors, such as the perovskite thin film photodetector with 36.7 mA W−1 and 5.84%,29 the perovskite nanosheet photodetector with 36 mA W−1,30 and the perovskite nanowire network photodetector with 100 mA W−1.31

(b) Temporal photocurrent response. The rise time (≈4.4 ms) is defined as the time when the current increases to 70% of the photocurrent while the fall time (≈6.7 ms) is the time for the current to decrease to 30% of the photocurrent. (c and d) Schematics of the charge generation and transport mechanisms in the perovskite 1D QDs photodetectors under laser exposure. 
Response time, an important figure of merit for photodetectors, was determined by the photo-switching experiment. Fig. 6b shows the temporal photocurrent response of the perovskite 1D QD device to a 532 nm laser intensity of 1.8 nW. Specifically, the rise time and decay time were measured to be around 4.4 ms and 6.7 ms, respectively, which are faster than or comparable to those single-crystalline or polycrystalline perovskite photodetectors.29,30,32,33 This is indicative of efficient carrier transit across the long 1D QDs made of the perovskite QDs and the low recombination process of the photogenerated carriers.
The excellent photoresponse performance of the perovskite 1D QDs device could mainly be attributed to the unique photocurrent generation and transport mechanisms within the granular 1D (Fig. 6c and d). For NW photodetectors, high photoelectric performance is generally associated with the oxygen-related hole trap states present at the NW surface.9 These states tend to adsorb oxygen molecules from the air, resulting in the capture of free electrons on the QD surface, O2 + e− → O2−,12,34 as shown in Fig. 1d. This surface band bending establishes an internal electric field which spatially separates the photogenerated electron-holes, thereby suppressing the carrier recombination and significantly increasing the carrier lifetime.35 At the same time, the photogenerated holes are reported to participate in the oxygen desorption of the surface, thereby releasing the trapped free electrons and increasing the free carrier concentration.36,37 Compared with the NW single crystals that generally possess a smooth track for carrier transport, the perovskite 1D QDs in this study have larger surface area and density of surface states, which would result in surface band bending and thus the formation of internal electric fields efficiently separating the photo-induced electron-holes.13,28,38 Moreover, the electron transport energy barriers arising from the crystalline grain boundaries in the perovskite 1D QD arrays assembled from the isolated QDs could sufficiently suppress the dark current of the perovskite 1D QD photodetector.39 Upon laser illumination, the energy barrier height would reduce due to the excessive photogenerated carriers around grain boundaries, resulting in an efficient carrier tunnelling through these barriers. This is also presumably a contributing factor for the observation of the threshold voltage in the current–voltage characteristics in Fig. 5b.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a facile way to fabricate one-dimensional aligned perovskite quantum dot nanowire arrays and have demonstrated their use as high-performance photodetectors. The high-quality all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots synthesized by the hot-injection synthesis were assembled into one-dimensional quantum dot arrays by the liquid bridge induced assembly (LBIA) strategy. After arranging the CsPbX3 quantum dots, the photoelectric detection characteristics of the devices were systematically studied, revealing their excellent performances, including responsiveness and detection sensitivity. Their high performance stems from the rich oxygen-related hole trapping state. In general, the wetting system developed in our work not only provides a facile and effective method to manufacture highly aligned perovskite quantum dots, but also can be extended to other material systems for microstructure integration.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  A liquid bridge induced assembly (LBIA) strategy to align perovskite quantum dots (QDs) in one direction upon the on-desired substrates. (a and b) A metal electrode coated substrate was horizontally placed. Then, the perovskite QD suspension was gradually released onto a metal electrode coated substrate and covered by a microgroove-structured silicon template, forming a sandwich type assembly system. (c) The organic solvent evaporated, allowing a linear-shaped micropillar array serving as defects of wetting. In this case, the QD solution would be ruptured regularly, leading to parallel “liquid tails” within precise positions in the corners between microgroove sidewalls and the supporting substrate. Each “liquid tail” can serve as a size-reducing confined space for the QD aggregation. Finally, the QDs could be closely packed to form the linear assembled arrays upon the supporting substrate. (d) After peeling off the microgroove-structured template carefully, the 1D QD assemblies with precise positions can be fabricated accordingly, serving as highly sensitive photodetectors.	 

 	Fig. 2  The TEM images of CsPbCl3 (a), CsPbBr3 (b), and CsPbI3 (c) QDs, respectively. The XRD patterns of CsPbCl3 (d), CsPbBr3 (e), and CsPbI3 (f) QDs, together with standard JCPDS cards, respectively. The absorption and PL spectra of CsPbCl3 (g), CsPbBr3 (h), and CsPbI3 (i) QDs, the inserts are the photographs of the perovskite and methylbenzene dispersion system.	 

 	Fig. 3  The SEM image (a) and the zoom SEM image (b) of the perovskite 1D QDs aligned by the capillary-bridge mediated assembly on the SiO2/Si substrate, and the large-area optical image (c) and the PL mapping (d) of the point-by-point scan of the perovskite 1D QD arrays, the insert is one of the random PL spectra in (d).	 

 	Fig. 4  The fluorescence microscopy images of CsPbCl3 (a), CsPbBr3 (b), and CsPbI3 (c) 1D QD arrays, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  Photoresponse of the perovskite 1D QD photodetectors. (a) Optical microscope image of an assembled perovskite 1D QD photodetector under 532 nm laser illumination. Scale bar, 20 μm. (b) The current–voltage curves of the 1D QD photodetector under dark and 532 nm laser illumination of 4.2 nW. (c) The time-dependent photoresponse of a single 1D QD photodetector under 532 nm laser irradiance with intensity of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 3.0, 4.2, and 5.4 nW at +4 V bias voltage.	 
R = Iph/(Plight·A),
EQE = hcR/(eλ),

 	Fig. 6  Performance characterization of the single perovskite 1D QD photodetector. (a) Photocurrent and responsivity versus the intensity of 532 nm laser at a voltage bias of +4 V. (b) Temporal photocurrent response. The rise time (≈4.4 ms) is defined as the time when the current increases to 70% of the photocurrent while the fall time (≈6.7 ms) is the time for the current to decrease to 30% of the photocurrent. (c and d) Schematics of the charge generation and transport mechanisms in the perovskite 1D QDs photodetectors under laser exposure.
