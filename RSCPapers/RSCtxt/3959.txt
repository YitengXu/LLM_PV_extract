    , Accepted 27th November 2018First published on 8th December 2018AbstractA thin film of (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x has been developed as a photocathode for solar water splitting for the first time. A superior photoelectrochemical performance has been achieved, mainly attributed to the formation of a solid solution by CuInS2 and ZnS, which proved to be an effective strategy to improve the onset potential and efficiency of CuInS2 photocathodes.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using semiconductor photoelectrodes is a promising approach to store solar energy in the renewable hydrogen fuel.1 Assembly of photoanodes and photocathodes in standalone wireless PEC cells represents the simplest and most cost-effective means for achieving efficient solar water splitting.2 In such configurations, both the photoanodes and photocathodes must generate a large photovoltage at their semiconductor/electrolyte junctions to drive the water oxidation and reduction reactions, while at the same time a high photocurrent density at their working potential in certain configurations is also needed to enable efficient water splitting reactions. In this respect, development of robust photoanodes and photocathodes that have sufficient onset potential and high photocurrent density in their half-cell PEC configurations is critical.3
Remarkable progress has been made in developing efficient photocathodes that achieve a high photocurrent density at 0 VRHE, however, their onset potentials remain relatively negative which has long been hampering the construction of efficient photoanode–photocathode PEC devices. Therefore, to improve the onset potential of photocathodes is an urgent task.
Chalcopyrites are promising candidates for photocathodes because they have a high optical absorption coefficient and a relatively high carrier mobility.4 Surface modifications of Cu-chalcopyrite based photocathodes with suitable n-type semiconductors to form p/n junctions have been reported to improve the PEC performances significantly.5 For example, Kumagai et al. reported a CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2 photocathode that can produce a photocurrent density of ∼30 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE and a positive onset potential of ∼0.7 VRHE under simulated sunlight with the surface modified with CdS, Mo, Ti and Pt. As a result, the maximum half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (HC-STH) reached 8.5% at 0.38 VRHE.6 Besides surface modifications, the formation of solid solutions has also been reported to be effective for the enhancement of hydrogen evolution from water.7 A series of CuInS2-based solid solutions, such as (CuIn)xZn2(1−x)S2,8 ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2,9 and (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x10 photocatalysts have been reported for enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 production in aqueous solutions containing sacrificial reagents. Recently, Kaneko et al. reported that the thin film photocathodes composed of ZnSe:Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solid solution prepared using a co-evaporation method showed a remarkable onset potential of ∼0.89 VRHE.3a,11 A hierarchical thin film of Cu2In2ZnS5 was reported as a counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells with the power conversion efficiency reaching up to 6.1%.12 Cu2In2ZnS5 was also used as a photoanode for PEC water oxidation.13 However, to the best of our knowledge, the investigation of CuInS2:ZnS as a photocathode for PEC hydrogen production has never been reported.
In the present work, CuInS2 and ZnS solid solution, (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x thin films were prepared using a simple electrodeposition and sulfurization method. Controlled amounts of Cu, In and Zn layers were deposited on the Mo-coated soda-lime glass substrates as a precursor. After sulfurization of the deposited metal layers, (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x thin films were obtained. The prepared (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 thin films were then coated with CdS thin layers on their surfaces to facilitate charge separation of photoexcited carriers through the formation of surface p/n junctions and decorated with Pt as a hydrogen evolution catalyst. The Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathode yielded a photocurrent density of 16.7 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE and an onset potential of +0.84 VRHE, which is one of the most positive onset potentials among all I–III–VI2 chalcopyrite related photocathodes with a long absorption edge. A high HC-STH of 5.6% was achieved at +0.45 VRHE. Compared to the conventional CuInS2-based photocathodes, a 0.26 V positive shift of the onset potential was realized and a photocurrent of 6.5 mA cm−2 and an HC-STH of 3.8% at 0.6 VRHE were obtained. These results indicated that the formation of a solid solution is an effective approach to obtain a facilitated photocurrent with a positive onset potential for efficient overall solar water splitting.
(CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x thin films were fabricated on Mo-coated soda-lime glass substrates by sequential electrodeposition of Cu, In and Zn metallic layers followed by sulfurization. The detailed experimental conditions are mentioned in the ESI.† The CuInS2 mole fraction x, which corresponds to the In/(In + Zn) atomic ratio, was determined via EDS (Table S1, ESI†). As the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show in Fig. 1a, the prepared (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x solid solution thin films show very similar diffraction peaks to the chalcopyrite structured CuInS2 (JCPDS 27-0159).14 There are no unexpected diffraction peaks belonging to ZnS, which suggests the successful formation of (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x solid solution without phase separation. The prominent intensity of the (112) diffraction peak of (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x indicated a preferred orientation which is the same as that of CuInS2 thin films.
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns of the prepared (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x films. The peak at 2θ of 27° labelled with * is indexed to ZnS with a wurtzite phase. (b) Normalized XRD patterns of the (112) peak for the (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x films. The CuInS2 mole fraction x corresponding to the In/(In + Zn) atomic ratio was 1, 0.96, 0.92, 0.81, and 0, respectively as determined by EDS. 
CuInS2 belongs to the family of I–III–VI2 chalcopyrite semiconductors. It is a ternary analogue of the II–VI binary semiconductors with a zinc-blende structure. As we know, the unit cell of the chalcopyrite structure can be identified as two zinc-blende unit cells piled along their c-axis.15 For example, the unit cell of CuInS2 can be seen as stacking of two unit cells of ZnS and replacing all Zn sites with In and Cu atoms (as shown in Fig. S1, ESI†). Therefore, ZnS and CuInS2 have a similar crystal structure, and the (111) plane in zinc-blende ZnS corresponds to the (112) plane in chalcopyrite CuInS2. The structural similarity would allow them to form a solid solution easily. Fig. 1b compares the difference of the (112) XRD peaks between CuInS2 and (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x. The (112) XRD peak of the (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x film is clearly shifted to a higher angle, indicating that the film was made of (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x solid solution instead of mixtures of CuInS2 and ZnS as discussed above. The shift of the XRD peak to a higher angle and linear diminution of the d-spacing (Fig. S1c, ESI†) with the increase of the ZnS content is due to the smaller ion radius of Zn2+ (0.74 Å) compared to that of In3+ (0.81 Å) and Cu1+ (0.96 Å).16
The surface morphology of the as-prepared (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x film was observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S2, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2a, the surface of the (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 film consists of crystallite agglomerates, which is similar to that of the CuInS2 film in our previous report.14 The molar ratio of In/Zn was found to be ∼4.36 according to the result of simultaneously performed EDS analysis shown in Table S1 (ESI†), which is slightly higher than that of 4.0 as controlled in our electrodeposition process. To reveal the elemental distributions in the (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 film, compositional mapping in a cross-sectional view was conducted. As shown in Fig. 2, the mapping results suggest that Cu and In elements were uniformly distributed throughout the film; meanwhile, the Zn element presented a novel gradient distribution with a gradual increase of the Zn content from the surface-side to the back-contact-side. The gradient in the composition was further verified by the linear scanning results of Zn as displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the PEC properties of bare photoelectrodes were proved. A CuInS2 electrode generated a cathodic photocurrent under chopped simulated sunlight, indicating its p-type semiconducting character. In contrast, the ZnS electrode showed an anodic photocurrent, indicating that it is an n-type semiconductor. For the (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 electrode, a cathodic photocurrent was observed, suggesting that it is a p-type semiconductor.
Before the PEC measurements, the CdS buffer layer and the Pt catalyst were deposited on the CuInS2 and (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 surfaces by chemical bath deposition (CBD) and PEC deposition, respectively. Fig. 3a shows the representative current–potential (J–E) curves of Pt/CdS/CuInS2 and Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19. Compared to Pt/CdS/CuInS2, Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 delivered a higher cathodic photocurrent over the entire tested potential region, especially in the positive range. At 0 VRHE, the photocurrent density reached −16.7 mA cm−2 with the Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathode which was larger than that of −13.4 mA cm−2 for the Pt/CdS/CuInS2 photocathode. In addition, the onset potential of Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 was +0.84 VRHE, which is one of the most positive onset potentials reported for photocathodes based on I–III–VI2 chalcopyrites.3,5,17 As for the Pt/CdS/CuInS2 photocathode, the onset potential was +0.58 VRHE. At this working potential, the photocurrent density of the Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathode already reached −7.3 mA cm−2. The HC-STH conversion efficiency of the Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathode reached 5.6% at 0.45 VRHE, which is two times higher than that of 2.3% at 0.26 VRHE for Pt/CdS/CuInS2, as shown in Fig. 3b. Furthermore, Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 can provide a photocurrent of 6.5 mA cm−2 and an HC-STH of 3.8% at 0.6 VRHE, which makes (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 a promising photocathode for PEC water splitting combined with a variety of photoanodes without the application of an external bias voltage.
 Fig. 3  (a) Photocurrent density–potential curves and (b) corresponding HC-STH curves of the Pt/CdS/CuInS2 and Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathodes. The curves were measured under chopped AM 1.5G illumination in an aqueous electrolyte of 0.5 M potassium phosphate (KPi) at pH 7. 
DFT calculations suggested that the S3p and Cu3d orbitals mainly contribute to the formation of valence bands in the (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x solid solution, and the In5s5p and Zn4s4p orbitals mainly contribute to the formation of the conduction band of the (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x solid solution.8a,18 The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) positions of (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x solid solution are located between those of ZnS and CuInS2 (band edge potentials for ZnS and CuInS2 are shown in Fig. S5, ESI†).8a,19 Therefore, the VBM potential for the (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x solid solution is expected to be deeper than that for CuInS2. The deepening of about 0.15 V of the VBM potential for (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 compared with CuInS2 was estimated via the photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) results shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). We thus suggest that the positive shift of the onset potential of (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 is because of the deepening of its VBM potential which resulted in an improved flat band potential (Fig. S7, ESI†). The improved onset potential and the increased photocurrent density are crucial factors for improving water splitting efficiency. Therefore, the formation of a solid solution with a wide-bandgap material is an effective strategy to improve the PEC performance of the p-type material by deepening its VBM. This strategy could be applied to other systems when the two materials have an analogue crystal structure.

Fig. 4a plots the incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 and Pt/CdS/CuInS2 photocathodes. The IPCEs were calculated by measuring the photocurrent density under monochromatic light illumination at 0 VRHE. The IPCE of the (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathode reached ∼67% in the 400–600 nm range, indicating a high photon-to-current conversion efficiency. It started to decrease at wavelengths longer than 600 nm. As shown in the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 and CuInS2 films in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the light absorbance of (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 at wavelengths longer than 650 nm was decreased by alloying with large bandgap ZnS. On the other hand, Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 showed higher IPCEs at <650 nm due to the facilitated charge separation caused by the deeper VBM of (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 than that of CuInS2. To obtain further facilitated IPCEs especially at around the absorption edge wavelength, the introduction of a composition gradient structure into the (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x layer should be beneficial.

(b) Hydrogen and oxygen evolution of the Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathode (area: 0.27 cm2) in a three-electrode configuration under AM 1.5G illumination at 0 VRHE. The theoretical amount of evolved hydrogen and oxygen was denoted as e−/2 and e−/4 respectively, and is indicated by the dashed line. 
The CdS-modified sulfide-chalcogenides, such as CuInS2, Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu(InGa)S2, suffer from a degradation problem as per our previous report14 and other results,3b,5c and the photocurrents decay dramatically to ∼20% within one hour under continuous light illumination without protective layers. The electrodes are usually tested under chopped-light illumination,20 which is beneficial for retaining the photocurrent. The stability of Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 was also tested in the current work (Fig. S9, ESI†). After continuous light illumination for 1 h at an applied potential of 0 VRHE, the percentage of remaining photocurrent remained at 72%. The faradaic efficiency of the Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 electrode was evaluated through the analysis of evolved gases. The hydrogen and oxygen evolution for a Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathode and a Pt counter electrode were quantified via gas chromatography in a three-electrode configuration with an applied potential of 0 VRHE in the three-electrode configuration under AM 1.5G irradiation. As shown in Fig. 4b, continuous hydrogen and oxygen evolution was detected under light illumination, with the total amounts of 39 and 19 μmol for hydrogen and oxygen after the reaction for one hour. The ratio of evolved hydrogen and oxygen was close to stoichiometry of 2:1, with a faradaic efficiency of approximately 100%. The gas evolution results suggested that the photocurrent contributed to the hydrogen evolution without side redox reactions.
The performance of (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19-based and reported chalcogenide photocathodes is summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). In comparison with literature data, the Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathode yielded a relatively high HC-STH, the most positive onset potential and the highest photocurrent at 0.6 VRHE among the reported photocathodes so far based on polycrystalline materials.
In conclusion, (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x solid solution thin films were prepared by sulfurization of the electrodeposited metal precursors. After surface modifications with n-type CdS layers and Pt catalysts, the Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathode exhibited a high photocurrent density of 16.7 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE with a positive onset potential of +0.84 VRHE. The maximum HC-STH reached 5.6% at 0.45 VRHE under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight illumination. The onset potential showed a ∼0.26 V positive shift compared to that of the Pt/CdS/CuInS2 photocathode. A photocurrent density of 6.5 mA cm−2 and HC-STH of 3.8% was achieved at 0.6 VRHE. Our results demonstrated that formation of a solid solution is a highly effective strategy to improve the PEC onset potential and efficiency of a CuInS2 photocathode. The (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x photocathode with a positive onset potential and a high photocurrent density can be used as a promising photocathode combined with a wide-bandgap photoanode for cost-effective overall PEC water splitting. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that formation of a solid solution by two or more materials with an analoguous crystal structure is an effective strategy to improve the PEC performance of p-type materials, and this strategy is expected to be further applied to other materials.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns of the prepared (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x films. The peak at 2θ of 27° labelled with * is indexed to ZnS with a wurtzite phase. (b) Normalized XRD patterns of the (112) peak for the (CuInS2)x(ZnS)1−x films. The CuInS2 mole fraction x corresponding to the In/(In + Zn) atomic ratio was 1, 0.96, 0.92, 0.81, and 0, respectively as determined by EDS.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Top-view SEM image, (b) cross-sectional STEM-DF image, and (c–f) corresponding EDS mapping results for the (CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 film. Scale bars are 250 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Photocurrent density–potential curves and (b) corresponding HC-STH curves of the Pt/CdS/CuInS2 and Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathodes. The curves were measured under chopped AM 1.5G illumination in an aqueous electrolyte of 0.5 M potassium phosphate (KPi) at pH 7.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Wavelength dependent IPCE curves of the Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 and Pt/CdS/CuInS2 photocathodes measured at 0 VRHE under monochromatic irradiation using a Xe lamp equipped with bandpass filters (FWHM of ∼10 nm). (b) Hydrogen and oxygen evolution of the Pt/CdS/(CuInS2)0.81(ZnS)0.19 photocathode (area: 0.27 cm2) in a three-electrode configuration under AM 1.5G illumination at 0 VRHE. The theoretical amount of evolved hydrogen and oxygen was denoted as e−/2 and e−/4 respectively, and is indicated by the dashed line.
