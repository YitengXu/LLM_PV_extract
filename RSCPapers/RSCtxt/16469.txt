Hydrogenation dramatically increases the quantum yield, suggesting that hydrogen-terminated sites work as electron reservoirs. NDs can also be used as effective photocatalysts to reduce graphene oxide. The resulting composites exhibit high and stable photocurrent generation upon visible light irradiation.
Nanodiamonds (NDs), synthesized by the detonation of carbon-containing explosives, have the potential to achieve widespread usage on a large scale, as comparable to that of the carbon nanotubes (CNT). NDs consist of an inert insulating sp3 core (Eg = 5.5 eV), and a chemically active surface that can host a variety of functionalized moieties. Research in the area of NDs has been traditionally centered on their mechanical reinforcement properties.1 Their low toxic nature and nitrogen/vacancy color centers also promise great biomedical applications, through suitable surface functionalization.2 Despite low conductivity, the ND film has been recently considered as an appropriate electrode material for photovoltaic cells.3,4 Herein, we report remarkable photocatalytic activity of detonated NDs in water for the H2 generation upon 532 nm laser irradiation. The photoelectrochemical/electrochemical properties of NDs were found to depend on the hydrogen and oxygen treatments of the surface.4–6 We observed consistently that the surface treatment had a strong influence on the ND photocatalytic efficiency.

Graphenes, the highly prospective two-dimensional carbon nanostructures, have been successfully synthesized by acid oxidation of graphite and subsequent reduction process.7 One of the reduction methods is UV-assisted photoreduction, which has a benefit of being a clean process, and the nanocrystals (NCs) served in promoting the photoreduction.8–10 In the present work, we have developed a new reduction method by using the photocatalytic reducing power of the ND. A number of studies showed the composites of a NC photosensitizer and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) produce promising optoelectronic devices.11–14 However, the ND has never been used as a photosensitizer for the RGO. We demonstrated that the resulting reduction products are uniquely non-covalently linked ND–RGO composites generating high photocurrent under visible light irradiation.
The detailed synthesis and characterization procedures are described in the ESI.† Acid-purified NDs, oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2) treated NDs were prepared, and referred as “PND”, “OND”, and “HND”, respectively. Their respective TEM, IR, Raman, and UV-visible absorption spectrum data are shown in the ESI†, Fig. S1–S4. IR spectra revealed that the oxygenation produces large amount of carbonyl bonds (CO), whereas hydrogenation eliminates them. It was also noted that the samples were highly stable, even after exposure to air for several weeks. The measurements of photocatalytic H2 generation were carried out by using 532 nm laser pulse irradiation (Nd-YAG laser, 20–100 mJ per pulse, 10 Hz, 10 ns pulse width). The H2 evolution was monitored as a function of time by gas chromatography and its quantity was calibrated by using a standard gas mixture. The total evolution of H2 from distilled (deionized) water (100 mL) after 3 h, 80 mJ per pulse laser irradiation, was 90, 60, and 270 μmol in the case of 100 mg PND, OND, and HND, respectively (Fig. 1a). It was observed that H2 treatment resulted in highest efficiency. However, O2 treatment led to the lowest efficiency. We observed no O2 evolution from the HND. As methanol (30 wt%) was used, the evolution rate of H2 increased by 40% to 390 μmol. However, no increase was observed in the case of OND.

For the HND, we measured the H2 evolution as a function of laser intensity, as shown in Fig. 1b. The non-linear curve indicates a significant contribution of a multiphoton process. Due to the larger band gap than one photon energy (2.6 eV), the multiphoton absorption was involved in the reaction which resulted in H2 evolution. We conducted further experiments to test the three-times recycling by adding fresh water after each run, as shown in Fig. 1c. The results revealed an excellent stability in the photocatalytic activity. The TEM analysis provided an evidence for no change in the morphology of the ND (see ESI†, Fig. S1). IR spectroscopy revealed that after irradiation, there was an increase in the amount of C–H bonds of both OND and HND, and disappearance of the CO bond of OND (see ESI†, Fig. S2). The 532 or 1064 nm laser pulse irradiation was used to enhance the dispersion by eliminating the surface carbons or to decompose them into graphites.15,16 In our experiment, we adjusted the laser intensity to monitor the water reduction without causing significant damage to the ND.
Two decades ago, Landstrass and Ravi reported that the H2 plasma-treated diamond film showed substantial conductivity upon exposure to air.17 The source of the conductivity has been a matter of controversy since that time. One of the most promising proposals, the so-called “transfer doping” model, assumes that the H-terminated surface behaves as an electron reservoir.17–20 The commonly accepted mechanism describes the presence of a hole in the accumulation layer due to an electron transfer from the valence band (VB) into electronic empty states of an adsorbate layer, resulting in a p-type surface conductivity. The existence of positively charged H atoms bonded to the negatively charged surface atoms creates the surface electric bilayer, such that the weakly trapped electrons on the surface can be easily transferred to the outside. This type of surface conductivity and the related electron transfer vanish on the O-terminated surface, due to its higher ionization potential. Fig. 1d depicts the energy diagram of the H- and O-terminated diamond (Eg = 5.5 eV). The conduction band (CB) and VB of H-terminated diamond in contact with water are approximately 0.3 and −5.2 eV, respectively.20 The O-termination lowers the CB by ∼1 eV, which places the VB at E = −6.2 eV.
Based on the transfer doping model and the same energy level, we suggest that the higher H2 generation rate of the HND than that of OND would be due to the presence of the surface electric bilayer on the hydrated surface. Once the HND generates the electron–hole pairs upon the multiphoton absorption, the electron reduces the H3O+ (adsorbed in the bilayers) to produce H2. The VB position in HND is not positive enough to compensate the holes by producing O2; O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH− (pH = 6; E = −5.3 eV). One possible hole scavenging reaction is 2H+ + 2e− → H2 (pH = 6; E = −4.0 eV), where the generated H2 undergoes the protonation to produce the H3O+ in the bilayers. It results in more H-termination on the surface, which can be supported by the increase of C–H bonds during the water reduction. The hole–electron recombination is too fast to generate H2 with a maximum efficiency. The addition of methanol as scavenger enhances the hole compensation (CO2 + 5H2O + 6e− → CH3OH + 6OH−), and the H2 generation becomes more efficient. On the other hand, due to the more positive valence band position of the OND, the oxidation reaction may capture the holes to avoid electron–hole recombination, without any assistance from the other hole scavenger. The PND exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity than the OND, but lower than the HND, probably due to the lower number of C O bonds than that of OND.
We calculated the photon fluxes of the laser irradiation as 12.8 mmol h−1. The apparent quantum yield for H2 evolution from water (0.090 mmol h−1) was calculated to be 0.70% for HND. The low efficiency was directly related with the multiphoton process. Nevertheless, the positive response to visible-light irradiation is encouraging and reflects the potential of ND for solar energy conversion. To extend the application of NDs in the area of photovoltaic cells, we produced the ND–RGO composites.
GO was synthesized by following a modified version of Hummers' method. For a typical photoreduction of GO, an aqueous solution which contained GO:HND in a ratio of 1:5 was placed and illuminated by 532 nm (20 mJ per pulse) laser pulses for 30 min. After irradiation, the color of the sample turned black, indicating the formation of RGO (Fig. 2a). For comparison, “only GO” and “only ND” samples were analyzed under similar conditions and a less color change was observed in both the cases, suggesting the crucial role of NDs as photocatalysts in the reduction process of GO. Upon laser irradiation, the accumulated electrons within NDs served to reduce the epoxy and carboxylated groups of GO sheets.

Recently, some research has been carried out on the synthesis of ND–RGO and –CNT composites to obtain the stable conductive materials.21,22 The photoconductance of H- and O-terminated diamond patterned electrodes has also been investigated.23 However, still no optoelectronic phenomena have been reported for the ND–RGO composites. We fabricated the visible light photodetector devices consisting of non-covalently linked ND–RGO composites that were produced by using laser irradiation, as described above. Fig. 2b corresponds to the TEM image of the HND–RGO, showing that the ND was homogeneously attached to the RGO sheets. The positive surface charge of HND might facilitate the binding with the negatively charged GO or RGO sheets.24
The assembled electrodes on the silicon oxide substrate were fabricated by the dielectrophoresis (DEP) technique. The ND–RGO composite sheet was deposited between a gap of 2 μm in the microelectrodes to function as a channel. The details of the device fabrication can be found in the ESI.† We performed AFM height profile measurement to confirm the presence of 4 nm thick RGO sheets and 5 nm diameter NDs between the electrodes (Fig. 2c). Fig. 2d shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the photodetectors that consisted of the HND–RGO, under dark conditions and upon 514 nm Ar ion laser irradiation (20 mW). The current of the “RGO only” (chemically reduced) devices showed negligible change upon illumination.14 The I–V curves were nearly linear within the measured range, indicating Ohmic contact of the devices. The photocurrent (ΔI) was measured to be 17 μA, and the photosensitivity, which was defined as the ratio of ΔI to that in the dark (I0), was 900%. The photocurrent (ΔI) was measured in real time with light on/off cycles, at a bias voltage of 2 V, as shown in Fig. 2e. There was an instantaneous increase/decrease in the current (<0.1 s) when the illumination was in on/off condition. There was no decay of the photocurrent, indicating great stability against photooxidation. The changes in current upon illumination were as a result of the charge transfer from the ND to the effective conducting RGO channel. The photoinduced electron/hole of NDs could transfer to or from the RGO, whose work function was assumed to be like that of graphene (4.5 eV). Once the excitons were generated by 514 nm absorption, there was transfer of charge carriers to the RGO, with resultant flow towards the oppositely charged electrodes.
In summary, we report that NDs (dia. = 5 nm) exhibit remarkable photocatalytic activity towards the H2 generation by reduction of water upon Nd:YAG 532 nm laser pulse irradiation, accompanied by a multiphoton absorption process. The H2 treatment of the surface (HND) dramatically increased the quantum yield, probably due to the function of the H-terminated sites as electron reservoirs. The HND was used as an excellent photocatalyst to reduce the GO. The resulting products were non-covalently linked ND–RGO composites, which demonstrated stable, fast, and sensitive photoresponse upon visible light irradiation (514 nm Ar ion laser). These low-cost carbon hybrid nanostructures stimulate the possibility of fabrication of high-performance transparent optoelectronic nanodevices.
