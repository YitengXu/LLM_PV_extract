    , Accepted 17th December 2021First published on 17th December 2021AbstractA large and rapidly expanding class of two-dimensional (2D) metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides called MXenes, with their interesting photovoltaic applications and tunable surface termination, has found a vast range of applications in improving the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By doing simulations, we report the influence of adding Ti3C2Tx MXene into the absorber layer, and at the interfaces in a PSC, to achieve physical understanding about its impact on the improvement of the performance of the PSC. In this work, the considered architecture contains the methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) absorber layer, TiO2 electron transport layer, and Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer. The simulations show that the addition of Ti3C2Tx to the halide perovskite and TiO2 layers induces an electric dipole at the interfaces that can change the band alignment between the charge transfer layers and absorber layer. The combined action of the work function tuning and interface engineering can modify the electric field distribution in the layers, which can increase the built-in potential, affect the photocurrent and current density, and finally improve the performance of MXene-modified PSCs with respect to reference cells without MXene. This work provides a theoretical discussion to display the promising role of MXenes to be used in PSCs to improve their performances.
I. Introduction
The great concern of improving the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has triggered many efforts to employ new compositions as absorber layers and charge transfer layers (CTLs).1 In this context, two-dimensional (2D) materials have extensively been beneficial to promote the performance of PSCs.2–11 Regarding PSCs, the mission of this family of materials is to modify the chemical and/or physical properties of the involved layers12–17 and improve the charge collection/injection performed by the contacts in the PSC structure. A new family of 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides constitute MXenes,18–27 and are presented with the general formula Mn+1XnTx (n = 1, 2, 3), where M represents an early transition metal, X is the carbon and/or nitrogen atom, and Tx is the surface-terminating functional groups. One of the exciting applications of 2D Mxenes is to modify the work function (WF) of the layers by appropriate functionalization.28–30 In PSC structures, adjusting the WFs of the involved layers will allow energy level alignment to make a suitable energy offset between the absorber layers and CTLs, and establish a higher built-in potential for more efficient charge collection at the contact electrodes. MXenes could vary the WF, by employing both the transition metal and X element.31 Besides, the surface of the naturally functionalized MXenes can change the electrostatic potential, and, therefore, alter the electronic structure that shifts the WF.32 Alternatively, surface termination can affect the WF. For example, OH termination can give a WF of 1.6 eV, while O termination can increase this amount to 6.25 eV.33,34 This feature of MXenes has inspired researchers to incorporate them into the photovoltaic structures of PSCs.35 For instance, Ti3C2Tx MXene has been employed in the perovskite absorber layer to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by about 12% with respect to the cells without MXenes.33 Incorporating MXenes into the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL)34 provided an improved charge mobility that led to an increase in PCE of 6.5%.
Agresti et al. used two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene with various termination groups (Tx) to tune the WF of the perovskite absorber and the TiO2 ETL, and engineer the perovskite/ETL interface.35 They designed and fabricated four cells: a reference device (RD) without MXene and three other ones with MXene. The architectures of the RD and three other cells including type A (TA), type B (TB), and type C (TC) with Ti3C2Tx MXene are summarized in Table 1. In this table, mTiO2 and cTiO2 refer to mesoporous and compact TiO2, respectively. It is reported that doping MXene does not affect the bandgap energy of the absorber layer, and influences the WF of the ETL and absorber layer.35

In PSCs, the built-in asymmetry, created by electrode contacts, extracts the charge carriers generated within the active layer, to make a net photocurrent. The built-in electric field arises from the difference between the WFs of the electrode contacts. In this regard, it is of uttermost importance to investigate the correlation between the added MXene into the PSC structure and the built-in potential, photocurrent density, and band structure. In this paper, we describe the nature of the driving forces responsible for charge extraction and their contestants that limit the photocurrent density in the RD and devices with MXene.
II. Results and discussion
We use a well-established drift-diffusion model within the frame of SCAPS (ver.3.3.08) software36 to fulfill the simulation work. In the present simulations, ionic effects37,38 have not been considered. In the current study, first, we reproduce the current density–voltage (J−V) curves of the four cells given in ref. 35, which is based on the parameters35,39–45 tabulated in Table 2. In the table, NA and ND denote acceptor and donor densities, respectively, ε is the relative permittivity, χ is the electron affinity, Eg is the bandgap energy, μn and μp are the mobilities of an electron and a hole, Nt is the defect density and NC and NV are the effective density of states of conduction and valence bands, respectively. In the simulation, we take the thermal velocity of the electron and hole as . Two interfaces were included at the TiO2/perovskite and perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD to consider the interfacial recombination. For the interfaces, the recombination capture cross-section parameter was set to be 10−19 cm2 for the electron and hole. The work functions of the front and back metal contacts are 4.16 eV and 5.1 eV, respectively. The technological and geometrical parameters of the initial cell were extracted from the experimental and theoretical evidence given in ref. 35, and then were varied until the produced J−V curves follow the experimental data. Fig. 1 depicts the experimental points adopted from ref. 35 and theoretical fits based on the parameters in Table 1. The excellent matching between experimental data points and calibration provided by our parameters proves the validation of our simulation.

 Fig. 1  
J–V curves of (a) RD, (b) TA, (c) TB, and (d) TC. The experimental points and theoretical calculations (solid lines) are based on the parameters introduced in Table 2. 
First, we investigate the photocurrent density as a function of the applied voltage of these cells. The photocurrent density in the forward bias is Jph = J(V) – Jdark,(1)where J(V) is the current density under illumination. Ideally, the photocurrent is independent of the applied voltage; however, practically, the interplay between charge carrier recombination and extraction will ultimately regulate the photocurrent density as a function of the applied voltage.46,47 The photogenerated current is almost entirely due to drift caused by the internal electric field approximated as , where Vbi is the built-in potential, and d is the thickness of the device. Within this approximation, when the applied voltage increases beyond Vbi the photocurrent flows in the reverse direction.
To understand the behavior of the photocurrent and the recombination profiles, and their correlation with Vbi, in a reaction on adding Ti3C2Tx MXene in the PSC structure, we performed numerical simulations based on a drift-diffusion model on the perovskite devices. It should be noted that, in the numerical calculations, Jph is obtained by utilizing Eqn (1). To reveal the role of the added MXene in the CTLs, and the perovskite active layer, simulations with and without CTLs (metal–insulator–metal) were performed. In the absence of the CTLs, the structure becomes a metal–insulator–metal (M–I–M) device.
a) M–I–M structure

Fig. 2 depicts the J−V and Jph−V curves for M–I–M structures when the CTLs of the RD and TA cells are decreased. The photogenerated current due to the internal electric field has already been modeled.48–50 (2)where μ is the charge carrier mobility, τ is the charge carrier lifetime, V is the applied voltage, and d is the sample thickness. Eqn (2) could suggest that the intersection of the Jph(V) curve and the voltage axis would give Vbi. The photocurrent curve of the RD intersects the voltage axis at V = Vbi. This way, a built-in potential of 1.02 V for the RD is observed. However, the photocurrent curve of the TA device does not intersect the voltage axis. We discuss that the electric field distribution across the MXene-assisted perovskite absorber layer and intrinsic high mobility of the charge carriers are responsible for this behavior. In the perovskite absorber layer, the high mobility of the carriers enables them to move fast enough against the reversed electric field and reach the selected contacts. In this case, one should extrapolate the falling-off region of the photocurrent to intersect the voltage axis and obtain the built-in potential. This way, a built-in potential of 0.67 V can be calculated for the TA cell. The electric field inside the absorber layer for two cells is depicted in Fig. 3. In the low applied voltage regime (V ≪ Vbi), the electric field across the absorber layer of the RD decreases monotonically with increasing applied voltage resulting in a low charge separation in the absorber layer. Consequently, the recombination rate shown in Fig. 4 grows by increasing the voltage. Increasing the applied voltage for the TA cell causes a partial decrease in the electric field across the absorber. Despite the applied voltage elevation, the electric field spikes up for the regions close to the anode. Comparing the recombination rate of the RD with TA in the low applied voltage regime, one can observe a lower recombination rate for the RD, which recovers the relatively higher photocurrent of this cell. When V ≪ Vbi, for both samples, the electric field inside the absorber layer stays positive, and does not change direction.

 Fig. 4  The recombination rate of the M–I–M structure for the absorber layer of the pristine sample (a–c), and the sample with MXene (d–f). 
For V ≈ Vbi, the photocurrents are characterized by a falling-off region, and the declining behavior of the electric field versus raising the applied voltage is repeated. However, the electric field in the RD changes the sign to be negative partially for elevated voltages, while it is not the case for the TA cell. The strong positive electric field in the regions close to the anode results in a net positive current. The flat-band condition can be established when V = Vbi. In this case, diffusion is the only charge extraction mechanism that competes with recombination. The close observation in the recombination curves for two cells reveals that the recombination in the MXene-assisted one is markedly less than that of the RD, exploring the role of the added MXene to shrink the recombination and allow the diffusion mechanism to dominate the recombination and keep the photocurrent positive.
With increasing the applied voltage far beyond the built-in potential (V ≫ Vbi) for the RD, the electric field across the perovskite layer gets reversed completely. In this case, the photocurrent curve flows in the reverse direction and forms another plateau. The interplay of the growing electric field in the reverse direction and a high recombination rate in this voltage range causes a saturated reverse photocurrent of about 2 mA cm−2, which is noticeably smaller than the current density in the first plateau region (V ≪ Vbi). At the same time, for the TA cell, beyond Vbi, the electric field somewhat gets reversed and develops more negatively with increasing applied voltage. The interesting feature of the photocurrent with this sample is that establishing a reversed electric field inside the absorber layer does not make the photocurrent flow in a reversed direction. In other words, the additive MXene in the absorber layer causes the photocurrent to flow in the previous positive direction as the applied voltage goes beyond the built-in voltage. The attenuation of the photocurrent for V ≫ Vbi, when the flat-band condition continues to be abiding, is a result of the competition between the high recombination rate (see Fig. 4) and non-negligible amount of photogenerated charges diffusing against the reversed electric field.51,52
b) N–I–P device
Upon comparing the two sets of samples with and without CTLs, the importance of the CTLs, which is palpable in the increase in the open-circuit voltage (VOC), is promptly visible. As can be noted in Fig. 5, the photocurrent behavior of the RD is distinctly different, with the photocurrent remaining positive for voltages well above the built-in potential. The electric field distribution of the RD with CLTs is disparate from the one without CTLs (Fig. 6). The presence of a strong electric field with a positive sign inside the absorber layer affects the resulting photocurrent to preserve its positive sign, even for higher voltages. Moreover, for the regions with negative electric fields, photogenerated charge carriers with high mobility could diffuse against the strongly reversed electric field at very high forward-bias voltages. It is noteworthy that the photocurrent for V ≫ Vbi is firmly dependent on both the charge recombination in the active layer and the electric field strength.

 Fig. 6  The electric field distribution of the N–I–P structure across the involved layers of the cells for V < Vbi (a and b), V ≈ Vbi (c and d), and V > Vbi (e and f). 
The photocurrent curves are composed of two plateaux and one falling-off region. When the applied voltage satisfies a nearly short current condition (V ≪ Vbi), like the M–I–M case, increasing the applied voltage decreases the electric field strength in the absorber layer. The electric field across the absorber layer stays positive and does not change direction. Fig. 7 shows the recombination rates of the cells within the same voltage region. For the cells with and without MXene, increasing the applied voltage causes more recombination in the absorber layer, which leads to a very slow declining slope of the photocurrent. It can be observed that TC has the least recombination in the perovskite active layer, which could be the reason for the highest photocurrent density of this cell in this voltage range. The recombination rate in the RD spikes in the hole transport layer (HTL). Meanwhile, it stays low for the MXene-added cells. This will further legitimate the lowest photocurrent density of the RD among all.

To provide more essential insights into the role of the MXene, we use a simplified analytical description of the photocurrent density.53 This model will be valid when the electric field inside the absorber layer is uniform and the charge carrier lifetime is almost constant in this layer. Besides, the carrier diffusion length should be much larger than the active layer length. Knowing that all these requirements are met in PSCs, the effective extraction time for holes collected by the HTL is given by (3)where UHTL is the potential difference across the HTL, Labs and LHTL are the absorber layer and HTL thickness, respectively, and μHTL is the hole mobility in the HTL. When V ≪ Vbi, the electric dipole, formed at the absorber/HTL interface in the MXene-added cells, establishes a significant potential difference across the HTL layer ; therefore, the extraction time of the holes from the HTL will be much shorter than the charge carrier lifetime in the absorber layer (τcol ≪ τ), and the photogenerated charge carriers in the absorber layer will be extracted immediately. The electric dipole formed at the absorber/HTL interface of the RD has much less strength compared to the MXene-assisted cells leading to (UHTL)RS ≪ (UHTL)MXenes, which gives (τcol)MXenes ≪ (τcol)RS. This means that in the MXene-assisted cells, the waiting time of the photogenerated carriers is acutely descended compared to their counterparts in the RD. As the generated carriers in the active layer of RD must wait for a more prolonged time to be extracted through the HTL, they will assuredly be lost. Applying more voltages, the interfacial electric dipole of the RD is considerably diminished, i.e., UHTL ≈ 0. Then the effective extraction time for holes by the HTL will be . This makes a comparable effective extraction time of holes with the charge carrier lifetime in the absorber layer (τcol ≈ τ ≈ 100 ns) and requires an almost commensurate recombination rate with the MXene-added cells in the HTL.
When V ≈ Vbi, the electric field across the HTL grows in the reverse direction, for the RD. The establishment of the reversed electric field itself in the HTL causes a great extraction time of the holes from the HTL (UHTL < 0). This is manifested in an ample effective extraction time (τcol ≫ τ) following eqn (3). On the other hand, the accumulative strength of the electric field with a reversed polarity in the HTL limits the recombination rate in this layer. The electric field across the absorber layer of the RD starts to change the direction partially. With increasing the applied voltage, for the TA cell, the polarity of the electric field nearby the ETL changes. The TB and TC cells maintain their previous direction of the electric field but with less strength. This indicates that the built-in potential of TC and TB will be greater than that of the TA cell and explains the higher PCE for these cells. Within the same voltage range (V ≈ Vbi), in the MXene added cells, the polarity of the electric field in the HTL has a positive sign which dictates UHTL > 0, which indicates a much less effective extraction time of holes for the MXene-assisted cells compared to the RD.
For V ≪ Vbi, the photocurrent of TC is the largest one, and its bulk recombination rate is the lowest among all cells. The meager rate of the charge extraction by the HTL in the RD sets the smallest photocurrent density for this sample. When the applied voltage approaches the built-in potential (e.g. V = 0.7 V), the bulk recombination of the RD grows extensively and further declines the photocurrent density. Nevertheless, for V ≈ Vbi, the bulk recombination rate of the RD falls behind that of the TB and TC cells, but precedes the TA cell. To explain this behavior, we investigate the current density of the cells versus the applied voltage in the inset of Fig. 5. As seen, the reversed current density of the RD is greater than the other samples, and the current densities can be ranked as JRD > JTA > JTB > JTC in the voltage range of 1 < V < 1.2. The higher bulk recombination of the RD compared to the TA cell requires more significant current density for the TA cell. Still, the measured current densities introduce a contradiction and add an ambiguity. To remove this ambiguity, we turn our attention to the effect of the added MXenes in energetic offsets between the charge transport levels of the extraction layers and those of the absorber layer. These energetic barriers affect the boundary conditions for the charge carrier and influence the built-in voltage of the device. We now introduce energetic offsets of the conduction (CBO) and valence (VBO) bands, respectively, as CBO = χabsorber − χETL,(4) VBO = χHTL − χabsorber + Eg,HTL − Eg,absorber.(5)
The relationship between the simulated VOC and built-in voltages with CBO and VBO, for different sample types, is shown in Table 3 and leads to several fascinating observations. First, for any energetic offset, the built-in potential always surpasses the VOC. For instance, in the case of TC, Vbi = 1.20 V is predicted, which is 0.1 V higher than the corresponding Voc. The table shows a remarkable recovery of VOC and Vbi in PSCs when the MXene is employed. The activation energy of the interfacial recombination at the ETL/absorber and absorber/HTL interfaces, respectively, is given by11 Ea,ETL = Eg − ∣CBO∣,(6) Ea,HTL = Eg − ∣VBO∣.(7)

The activation energy for the interfacial recombination of the cells is summarized in Table 3. It is obvious to see that the activation energy of the interfacial recombination at the ETL/absorber interface for the RD is more significant than that of the TA cell, which indicates a relatively more extensive interfacial recombination of the TA cell. This can rationalize the higher reversed current density of the RD than the TA cell, in the voltage range as mentioned above. As the bulk recombination of the TB and TC cells is comparable, the higher Ea,ETL of the TC cell requires less photocurrent density for this sample.
With V ≫ Vbi, the reversed electric field in the HTL of the RD is more strengthened and causes a sizeable effective extraction time for the holes (UHTL ≪ 0). The reversed electric fields for TA and TB cells are observed, too. In these samples, the polarity of the electric field in the absorber layer, in response to the applied voltage, acts inertially to change the direction. The TC cell shows colossal inertia to change the polarity in the absorber layer which results in the most considerable built-in potential.
As seen from the inset in Fig. 5, the magnitude of the reversed current densities is ranked as JRD > JTC > JTB > JTA, in the voltage range of 1.2 ≤ V ≤ 1.3. The bulk recombination order in Fig. 7 does not follow the current density order. This behavior can be attributed to the interfacial recombination that rearranges the total recombination and affects the photocurrent and current density. For example, in the bulk recombination for V = 1.3 V depicted in Fig. 8, the TA cell has the least bulk recombination and is expected to have the most prominent current density. However, amongst the MXene-assisted cells, the TA cell possesses the least Ea,ETL, which considerably enhances the interfacial recombination. This will again explain the lowest current density of this sample compared to the other MXene-assisted cells. In brief, one then concludes that adding MXene into the PSC structure will boost the interfacial recombination, playing a role to adjust the photocurrent density when V ≥ Vbi. The RD without the added MXene has the least interfacial recombination, and the TC cell has the same position amidst the cells doped with MXene.

Shedding more light on the origin of the Vbi recovery, we pay attention to the charge density distributions in the cells for V ≈ Vbi, as shown in Fig. 8. The formation of an electric dipole at the absorber/HTL interface in Fig. 5 is an indication of the high density of both electrons on the absorber layer side, and holes on the HTL side. For the MXene-assisted cells and voltages about and above the built-in voltage, the electric field is concealed in the absorber bulk setting up a flat band (Fig. 9). This in turn creates a nearly constant charge density of both kinds inside the absorber layer. However, for the RD, the distribution of the electrons and holes varies notably in the bulk of the absorber layer.
 Fig. 9  The band structure of the N–I–P cells for the different applied voltages. 
It is well known that the maximum built-in voltage emerges when a superlative energetic alignment between the HTL and absorber layer occurs (|VBO| ≪ 1).54 The VBOs of the RD and devices with MXene are summarized in Table 3, and are apparent in Fig. 9. When the nearly ideal condition is met, the VOC of the devices shows a noticeable increase compared to the RD(|VBO|≠0). Interestingly, the energy misalignment in the RD impacts the FF negatively and assigns the least value of this parameter to this cell. When V ≤ Vbi, the energy misalignment, seen in Fig. 8, in the RD leads to higher interfacial recombination. This can be displayed quantitively using the calculated activation energies for RD and MXene-added cells. The activation energy of the interfacial recombination of the RD is less than that of the cells with MXene. In the samples with MXene, the self-introduced interfacial dipole at the absorber/HTL interface lowers the energy offset to reduce the interfacial recombination and thus significantly enhances the effective built-in potential of the device.
III. Conclusion
This work demonstrates pieces of evidence to determine how modifying the WF of the perovskite absorber layer and CTLs, by adding Ti3C2Tx MXene into the cell structure, could lead to an optimized band alignment. We showed how adding MXene at the ETL/absorber interface tunes the interface band alignment to further reduce the interfacial recombination compared to the samples when MXene is just added to the absorber layer and ETL. Furthermore, adding MXene into the PSCs will diminish the effective extraction time of the holes from the HTLs. This will help to reduce the recombination rate and thus improve the cell efficiency.
