    , Accepted 25th February 2013First published on 27th March 2013AbstractWe demonstrated the preparation of graphene-embedded 3D inverse opal electrodes for use in DSSCs. The graphene was incorporated locally into the top layers of the inverse opal structures and was embedded into the TiO2 matrix via post-treatment of the TiO2 precursors. DSSCs comprising the bare and 1–5 wt% graphene-incorporated TiO2 inverse opal electrodes were compared. We observed that the local arrangement of graphene sheets effectively enhanced electron transport without significantly reducing light harvesting by the dye molecules. A high efficiency of 7.5% was achieved in DSSCs prepared with the 3 wt% graphene-incorporated TiO2 inverse opal electrodes, constituting a 50% increase over the efficiencies of DSSCs prepared without graphene. The increase in efficiency was mainly attributed to an increase in JSC, as determined by the photovoltaic parameters and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising substitute for conventional silicon solar cells due to their relatively high photon-to-electric efficiency and low fabrication and material costs.1–3 A photon-to-electric conversion efficiency of 11–12% is typical of state-of-the-art DSSC devices prepared using a nanocrystalline TiO2 photoelectrode sensitized with ruthenium-based dyes, along with a liquid redox electrolyte, under AM1.5 and 1 sun illumination conditions.2
In nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes, numerous trap states and random pathway morphologies can slow down electron transport. It has been reported that more than 90% of electrons may become trapped during operation.4 Thus, many studies have sought to enhance the electron mobility and transport by incorporating more conductive materials, such as SnO2, ZnO, or a variety of carbon nanomaterials.5–9
The incorporation of conducting carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs),10–12 fullerene,13 graphitic carbon14 and, recently, graphene sheets,15–20 into TiO2 has shown promising results. CNTs possess a high electrical conductivity and a band alignment compatible with that of TiO2 materials. CNT incorporation into conventional TiO2 forms bridges between TiO2 nanoparticles to enhance charge collection and transport.10,18 Graphene sheets have also been incorporated into conventional TiO2 electrodes.15–18,21 Graphene has recently received more interest than other carbon nanomaterials, because it displays a high specific area (theoretically, the order of 1000 m2 g−1, cf. the order of 100 m2 g−1 for multiwalled CNTs) and a high electron mobility (the order of 10000 cm2 V−1 s−1).22–24 Recent work comparing graphene with CNTs showed a higher photocurrent density and, therefore, a 35% higher efficiency for DSSCs comprising graphene in the TiO2 electrodes.18 Longer electron lifetimes were obtained upon graphene incorporation, which was attributed to better contact with the TiO2 nanoparticles.21
In this letter, we describe the incorporation of graphene into TiO2 inverse opal (IO) electrodes. IO structures fabricated using colloidal crystal templates have been studied as an alternative to conventional TiO2 electrodes.25–29 IO structures provide full 3D connectivity among TiO2 particles to facilitate electron transport, similar to 1D nanotube arrays.6,26,28 Moreover, these structures present a well-developed/fully connected pore structure that facilitates electrolyte infiltration and transport.29 We prepared graphene-embedded TiO2 (G-TiO2) IO for use in DSSCs. The graphene sheets could be locally arranged on the top layers of IO structures. The spatial arrangement of graphene near the top surface was advantageous because it reduced the light absorption by graphene itself. Here, we achieved a photon-to-electric conversion efficiency of 7.5% under 1 sun illumination conditions.
2 Experimental
Preparation of graphene oxide–TiO2 nanoparticle dispersion
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by the Hummers method.30 In a typical experiment, graphite flakes (Aldrich) and 0.01 M NaNO3 (Aldrich, >99%) were added to a H2SO4 solution (Aldrich, 95–98%). Subsequently, 0.02 M KMnO4 (Aldrich, >99%) was added as a reducing agent, and an H2O2 solution (Aldrich, 3 wt%) was added to complete the oxidation. The product was washed with distilled water and dried in a 100 °C oven overnight, leaving behind a graphene oxide powder. The size of GO sheets ranged from 200 nm to a few micrometers under the SEM measurement after sieving with a 15 μm mesh. The GO was mixed with the TiO2 aqueous colloidal suspension (with an average particle size of 15 nm, Nanoamor Inc.). The concentrations of GO were 1 wt%, 3 wt% or 5 wt% relative to the mass of TiO2 nanoparticles.
Preparation of graphene-embedded TiO2 IO electrodes
Polystyrene (PS) colloids were synthesized by dispersion polymerization, as reported elsewhere.29 Briefly, the styrene monomer (Aldrich, 99%) was polymerized using a 2,2-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile) (initiator, 1 wt% of the monomer), and 0.25 mM polyvinylpyrrolidone (Aldrich, Mw 40 K), yielding monodisperse particles around 750 nm in diameter. The PS colloidal solution was cast onto the FTO substrate; 1 ml of the solution per 1 cm2 area was applied to obtain the thickness of colloidal crystals of around 15 μm. Then, the GO–TiO2 dispersion solution was then infiltrated into the templates. The samples were heat-treated under a nitrogen atmosphere at 500 °C for 3 h to remove the PS templates. The films were treated with hydrazine vapor to reduce GO to graphene. Finally, the G-TiO2 IO structure was obtained after an extended post-treatment using an aqueous TiCl4 solution.
Assembly of the DSSCs
The G-TiO2 IO electrodes were immersed for 20 h in a dye solution containing 0.5 mM N719 dye (Dyesol Inc.) in anhydrous ethanol (99.5%, Aldrich). Subsequently, an active area of the TiO2 electrode was formed by scraping. The surface areas were around 10 mm2. The counter electrode was prepared by applying a 0.7 mM H2PtCl6 solution coating in anhydrous ethanol to the FTO substrate. The G-TIO2 IO electrode was assembled with the counter electrode. The gap distance between electrodes was fixed at 60 μm using a polymeric film spacer (Surlyn, DuPont). The electrolyte solution was then injected into the gap between the two electrodes. The redox couple/electrolyte solution contained 0.05 M LiI (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.03 M I2 (Yakuri), 0.7 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich), and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GSCN) (Wako), in a solution of acetonitrile (Aldrich) and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v).
Instruments and characterization
The surface morphologies were measured by SEM (Hitachi). Raman spectra were collected using a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR equipped with an air-cooled Ar-ion laser operated at 541 nm. XPS measurements were performed with an ESCALAB 250 XPS System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) using monochromated Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The photocurrent and voltage of the DSSCs were measured using a Source Meter (Keithley Instruments). These measurements were performed under simulated solar illumination produced using a 150 W Xe lamp (Peccell) and AM 1.5G filters. The intensity was adjusted using a Si reference cell (BS-520, Bunko-Keiki) to a power density of 100 mW cm−2. The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured using a potentiostat (Versastat, AMETEK) under 1 sun illumination and open-circuit conditions. The frequency range explored in the impedance measurements was 105–0.1 Hz.
3 Results and discussion
The route used to prepare microporous carbon spheres was illustrated in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Scheme for a G-TiO2 IO structure. (a) Fabrication of a GO–TiO2 IO structure by using PS colloidal crystal templates (b) G-TiO2 IO structures after the reduction of GO and subsequent post-treatment of TiO2 precursors. 
In Scheme 1a, the IO structure was obtained by using the mixture solution of GO and TiO2 nanoparticles and colloidal crystal sacrificial templates. Subsequently, the films were treated with hydrazine vapor to reduce GO to graphene. Specifically, the infiltration of the graphene layer was limited to several layers of the PS colloidal crystal as shown in Fig. 1a and b because the size of the planar graphene ranged from 100 nm to a few μm square, which is large relative to around 200 nm cavities among the PS spheres. In Scheme 1b, the post-treatment using an aqueous TiCl4 solution was followed to obtain a G-TiO2 IO electrode. The post-treatment grew clusters of 30 nm rutile TiO2 nanoparticles over the IO surface (Fig. 1c) as shown in Fig. 1d. The extensive post-treatment largely enhanced the specific area of IO structures.26

The arrows indicate the graphene layer embedded in the TiO2 IO structures. 
The reduction of graphene oxide in IO TiO2 to graphene as well as chemical states of graphene-embedded TiO2 was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. Fig. 2 compares the peaks before and after GO reduction. The broad peak centered at 285 eV before the reduction was narrowed to the sp2 C–C component. The peaks of epoxide group (C–O) and carbonyl (CO) groups in the range of 286–287 eV was decreased during the reduction.31–33 This loss of oxygen-containing components implied a reduction to graphene. Meanwhile, the peak at 282.5 eV was observed, indicating the C–Ti carbide bonds. The growth of a peak corresponding to carbide bonds upon reduction may indicate the formation of C–Ti bonds.34 The binding of graphene and TiO2 may be advantageous for the transport of electrons through graphene–TiO2 composites.

G-TiO2 IO structures were applied as photoelectrodes for DSSCs; the concentrations of graphene were controlled to be 1 wt%, 3 wt% and 5 wt% relative to the mass of TiO2 nanoparticles. A bare TiO2 IO structure was also prepared to compare to G-TiO2 IO electrodes. Fig. 3 shows the J–V curves for the DSSCs, and Table 1 lists the J–V parameters extracted from the J–V curves, including the JSC, VOC, FF, and the overall conversion efficiency (η), calculated using JSC × VOC × FF/(100 mW cm−2). Briefly, as the presence of graphene in the TiO2 increased, the efficiency reached a maximum value of 7.5% for the 3 wt% sample. This efficiency constituted a 55% enhancement over the efficiencies of DSSCs prepared using bare TiO2 IO electrodes.

The observed dramatic increase in efficiency was attributed to an increase in the JSC. The JSC is related to light harvesting, electron injection, and the electron collection efficiencies. The light-harvesting efficiency is affected by the dye adsorption and optical property of the electrode film.
The dye adsorption measurements showed that the dye adsorption did not depend on the embedding of graphene (0.032 μmol cm−2 for bare TiO2 IO and 0.035 μmol cm−2 for 5 wt% G-TiO2 IO). This is attributed to the fact that the graphene sheets were embedded in the post-treated TiO2 cover layer. Regarding the optical property, the addition of graphene enhanced the visible light absorption as shown in Fig. 4; the absorption was increased as increasing the graphene content. Since the absorption increase was attributed to the light absorption by the graphene itself, the graphene incorporation rather decreased the light absorption by dye molecules. Thus, these measurements revealed that the graphene incorporation impaired the light harvesting efficiency. Meanwhile, the injection efficiency mainly depends on shifts in the conduction band energy state of TiO2.35,36 Thus, the embedding graphene into the TiO2 matrix may not increase the injection efficiency. Thus, we can conclude that a higher JSC for DSSCs prepared using G-TiO2 IO may be attributed to an increase in the collection efficiency.

The enhancement in JSC for G-TiO2 IO electrodes was further analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 5 shows the EIS spectra of DSSCs prepared using bare TiO2 IO and G-TiO2 IO electrodes with various wt% graphene. Here, the large semicircle over the frequency range of 1–103 Hz indicated charge transfer at the TiO2–electrolyte interface.37 Charge transfer mainly occurs between electrons in the trap states of TiO2 and I3− ions in the electrolyte solution. We constructed a simple equivalent circuit (R–RC–RC) to characterize the series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2–electrolyte interface and the chemical capacitance (Cμ) of the TiO2 electrodes, respectively.19 These values are listed in Table 1.

Compared the 3 wt% G-TiO2 electrodes to the bare TiO2 IO electrodes, the Rct decreased by 27%, whereas Cμ increased by a factor of 2. The characteristic timescale obtained from the combination of Rct and Cμ, i.e., the electron lifetime (τn), was found to increase by 1.6 times. In other words, this analysis revealed that the incorporation of graphene sheets into the IO TiO2 structure enhanced τn by sufficiently increasing Cμ to offset a decrease in Rct. In DSSCs, electrons undergo trapping–detrapping motions in the band gap states before recombining with the redox ions or collecting on the FTO substrate. Cμ of the electrode describes the density of states below the conduction band.38,39 The capacitance measured under illumination and open-circuit conditions is often related to electron injection,40 but here, graphene may not, itself, affect the electron injection step because it was embedded in the TiO2 layer. Instead, the graphene sheets serve as efficient electron acceptors and transporters. Previously, the addition of graphene sheets can increase the electrical conductivity of the electrodes.17,18 G-TiO2 composite films yield conductivities that are a factor of 2 higher than the conductivity of bare TiO2.17,20 Thus, the enhanced conductivity may be contributed to the higher value of Cμ. Moreover, the increase in τn can be understood in terms of facile charge separation and transport due to the presence of graphene.
Meanwhile, the JSC values of DSSCs prepared using 3 wt% or 5 wt% G-TiO2 IO electrodes were 17.10 and 13.57 mA cm−2, respectively, corresponding to a 20% reduction in efficiency in the 5 wt% electrodes as compared to the 3 wt% electrodes. EIS analysis showed that Cμ decreased by 31% and τn decreased by 21%. The decrease in Cμ at higher graphene sheet loading in the TiO2 electrodes may result from an increase in the light absorption by graphene as shown in Fig. 3.
The effect of embedment and spatial arrangement of graphenes in the G-TiO2 IO electrode on the photovoltaic characteristics is described. First, graphene sheets were incorporated inside the TiO2 matrix by the post-treatment layer. The embedded graphene sheets may not increase the recombination loss by preventing the direct exposure of graphene sheets to the electrolyte solution. Fig. S1† clearly shows that the direct contact of graphene with the substrate induced the loss of JSC. Second, graphene incorporation, as described here, was limited to the few surface layers of 3D IO structures. The electrons generated near an electrode surface have a higher potential for electron loss by recombination due to a longer transport time prior to collection at the FTO substrate. Thus, this surface-limited incorporation can improve the overall electron transport in an effective manner. Previously, the effect of spatial arrangement of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the TiO2 electrode has been studied.41,42 They revealed that the efficiencies of electrodes with CNTs localized on the top electrode surfaces were similar to the efficiencies of DSSCs prepared with CNTs that were uniformly distributed over the entire electrode surface. Meanwhile, the graphene absorbed the light by itself. Thus, the top surface-limited incorporation of graphene minimizes the light absorption by graphene and effectively maintains the light harvesting efficiency by dye molecules.
4 Conclusion
We demonstrated the preparation of graphene-embedded IO electrodes for use in DSSCs. The relative sizes of the graphene sheets and the cavities in the template induced a local infiltration of graphene to the top several layers of the TiO2 IO structures. Embedding in the TiO2 matrix was proceeded under post-treatment of the TiO2 precursors. The presence of graphene in the TiO2 matrix was confirmed by XPS measurement. Here, we compared DSSCs prepared with 3D TiO2 IO electrodes either with or without graphene incorporation. The mass content of graphene was varied to determine the effects on the photovoltaic parameters. A high efficiency of 7.5% was achieved in DSSCs prepared using 3 wt% G-TiO2 IO electrodes, a 55% increase compared with DSSCs prepared without graphene incorporation. The increase in efficiency was mainly attributed to an increase in JSC. Two factors affected the JSC in a compensatory manner. Graphene incorporation enhanced charge separation and transport, as characterized by EIS and the equivalent circuit analysis, but graphenes reduced photon harvesting by the dye molecules due to the visible light absorption itself. In the experiment, the 3 wt% G-TiO2 IO electrodes showed a 38% increase in JSC compared with the bare TiO2 IO electrodes, and the higher graphene content (5 wt%) decreased JSC. Specifically, this result indicated that a local arrangement of graphene can effectively enhance JSC and, therefore, the efficiencies of DSSCs. The synergistic effects of graphene and 3D IO structures suggest that 3D IO structures may provide an alternative electrode for next-generation DSSCs.
