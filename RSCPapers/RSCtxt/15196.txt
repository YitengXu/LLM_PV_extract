    , Accepted 1st January 2023First published on 6th January 2023AbstractAlkyl chains are commonly used as solubilizer to guarantee the solubility of conjugated polymers. More importantly, the position, length, and type (linear/branched) of alkyl chains in conjugated polymers also have a substantial influence on the molecular configuration, intermolecular interaction, and associated stacking/packing modes. In this work, two donor polymers based on a benzothiadiazole (BT) unit, PBDT-T12BT with linear side chains and PBDT-TEhBT with branched side chains, were synthesized for application in organic solar cells (OSCs). It was found that the introduction of branched alkyl chains could not only improve the aggregation of polymer backbones both in solutions and thin films, but also enhanced the crystallinity in blended films. The higher aggregation/crystallinity of PBDT-TEhBT provides optimal morphology, enhanced charge-transporting ability, and suppressed charge recombination in blended films. Hence, PBDT-TEhBT-based OSCs exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.5% compared to 5.7% for cells based on PBDT-T12BT, presenting the highest performance based on BT-polymers as donor in OSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on electron donor and acceptor are considered as a promising solar-energy-harvesting technology due to their low cost, light-weight, and roll-to-roll printing compatibility.1–8 The studies of OSCs have made significant progress in recent years due to the development of p-type donor and n-type acceptor materials.9–12 Numerous high-performance conjugated materials have been developed, particularly for the evolution of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structured non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs),13,14 which contain an electron-rich core (D) and two electron-deficient terminal groups (A).15–18 NFAs have unique advantages over fullerene derivatives, including low production cost, easy regulation of energy levels, high electron mobility,19–22 and strong absorption of both visible and near-infrared light,23,24 so that they have become dominant in recent years.25–27 The PCEs of single-junction devices based on NFAs have reached over 19% recently.10,28–31 However, the development of pair donor materials has been stagnated in recent years.
It is significant to develop appropriate medium or wide band gap donor polymers that have complementary absorption with low band gap acceptors to achieve high-performance non-fullerene OSCs.32–34 Nowadays, high-performance polymer donors are mostly constructed via thiophene-substituted benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) unit,35 such as PBDB-T,36 PM6,37etc. However, these donor polymers show the complicated synthetic routes and purifications, resulting in the enhanced production cost for application. For comparison, benzothiadiazole (BT) is an electron-deficient unit with a simple fused aromatic core, which can be used to construct conjugated donor polymers.20 Moreover, BT unit can be finely regulated in absorption, frontier energy levels, and crystallinity through side-chain engineering or heteroatom substitution.38,39 Therefore, the BT unit is considered as a promising block to construct conjugated donor polymers. In another aspect, alkyl chains in conjugated polymers are commonly used as solubilizers to guarantee solubility in organic solvents. Since the position, length, and volume of alkyl side chains will strongly influence the aggregation behavior, including intermolecular interaction and associated stacking/packing motif, the effect of alkyl side chains on the photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers is elusive.40 Therefore, studying the effect of alkyl side chains on the properties of conjugated polymers will help to understand the structure–property relationship and provide a rational design for novel conjugated materials.41–43
In this work, we have synthesized two new donor polymers (PBDT-TEhBT and PBDT-T12BT, Fig. 1) containing the electron-donating benzodithiophene (BDT) block and the electron-withdrawing BT unit.44 The difference between the two donor polymers is the type of alkyl side chains, including linear and branched alkyl chains. The two conjugated polymers exhibited well-matched energy levels with the non-fullerene L8-BO acceptor, which can be used as electron donor in OSCs.45 As compared with the polymer PBDT-T12BT, PBDT-TEhBT exhibited higher hole and electron mobility, better crystallinity, and optimal phase separation, so that it provided a high PCE of 15.5% in OSCs, which is among the highest PCEs based on BT-polymer donors (the statistical plot is shown in Fig. 1 and the corresponding references are summarized in Table S1†).

2. Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of the BT donors are shown in Scheme S1 and the detailed procedures are provided in the ESI.† The key monomers 4a and 4b were synthesized from 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole by a two-step procedure, including Stille coupling with tributyl(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)stannane and tributyl(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)stannane, and bromination of the coupling products 3a and 3b. PBDT-T12BT and PBDT-TEhBT were synthesized via Stille polymerization by using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst in toluene at 115 °C. High-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement showed that PBDT-T12BT and PBDT-TEhBT have number-average molecular weights (Mns) of 4.9 and 6.9 kDa with dispersity values (ĐMs) of 4.19 and 5.43, respectively (Fig. S1†).
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of PBDT-T12BT and PBDT-TEhBT in chloroform (CF) solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively, and the corresponding parameters are presented in Table 1. It was found that, the two polymers exhibit similar absorption spectra due to their similar structures. In CF solution, the absorption range of PBDT-T12BT and PBDT-TEhBT is 300–700 nm. Among them, the maximum absorption peaks of PBDT-T12BT and PBDT-TEhBT are 584 and 590 nm, respectively, which can be denoted as the 0–0 transition peak due to the intramolecular charge transfer between the electron-rich and electron-deficient unit.6,46 In thin films, the absorption spectra of these polymers were slightly red-shifted due to enhanced aggregation, providing the optical bandgaps of 1.73 eV and 1.76 eV for PBDT-T12BT and PBDT-TEhBT. The variation of the absorption range between the solution and film implies more coplanar structures and stronger interchain π–π stacking existing in the film. The relatively lower 0–1 transition peak than the 0–1 transition peak indicated a typical H-aggregation for these polymers.47 Moreover, the higher 0–0/0–1 peak ratio of PBDT-TEhBT than that of PBDT-T12BT suggests better molecular aggregation both in solution and films. We then measured the temperature-dependent absorption spectra of these two polymers, as shown in Fig. S2.† It is observed that, all these polymers exhibited a decreased intensity of vibronic shoulder peaks (0–0 transition peak). At 110 °C, this peak in PBDT-TEhBT almost disappeared while PBDT-T12BT still retained a weak vibronic shoulder peak, which might be due to the high solubility of the branched side chains.48 The thermal properties of the polymers were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. These two donors exhibit excellent thermal stability at decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) above 420 °C (Fig. 2c). No thermal transition was observed in the DSC curve (Fig. S3†), implying that the two donor polymers have a low crystallization tendency during the rapid heating/cooling processes. The TGA and DSC results indicated that the alkyl side chains has a negligible influence on the thermal properties of the donor polymers.

The electrochemical energy levels of the two polymers were measured by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. The oxidation and reduction potentials of each material could be obtained from the corresponding curves (Fig. S4†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated as −5.49/−3.56 eV for PBDT-T12BT and −5.57/−3.58 eV for PBDT-TEhBT, respectively (Table 1). The small difference in frontier orbital energy levels may be due to the different degree of aggregation in the film state. Compared with donor polymers, the acceptor L8-BO possesses a HOMO level of −5.68 eV and a LUMO level of −3.90 eV,45 respectively. The LUMO offsets between the two polymers and L8-BO were more than 0.3 eV, which ensured a sufficient driving force for the electron transfer, and the HOMO offsets were lower than 0.2 eV which ensured the minimization of the energy loss (Fig. 2d).49,50
We then applied these donors into OSCs with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BT-polymer:NFAs/PFN-Br/Ag by using the L8-BO45 as electron acceptor. The fabrication conditions for photoactive layers, including the solvents, additives, annealing temperatures, and thickness were carefully optimized in detail (Tables S2–S5†). The optimized J–V curves and the photovoltaic parameters are presented in Fig. 3a and Table 2. In general, all the photoactive layers were prepared from chloroform solution with a concentration of 12 mg mL−1 using 1,3-dibromo-5-chlorobenzene (DBCl) as additive, and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min before PFN-Br deposition. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 2, for the PBDT-T12BT:L8-BO-based solar cell, an inferior PCE of 5.75% was obtained, with short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) of 16.87 mA cm−2, 0.79 V, and 0.43, respectively. Similarly, the PBDT-T8BT polymer with a linear octyl chain exhibited a PCE of 5.65% (Fig. S5†). But for PBDT-TEhBT-based devices, a high PCE of 15.55% was realized with simultaneously enhanced VOC, JSC, and FF. The higher VOC of PBDT-TEhBT-based OSCs could be ascribed to the deeper HOMO energy level. The enhanced JSC could be reflected by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra with a wide response range of 300–950 nm in Fig. 3b. And the EQE value of PBDT-TEhBT:L8-BO based OSCs could reach above 0.8, while the PBDT-T12BT:L8-BO system was less than 0.7, respectively. The integrated JSCs from the EQE curve well matched with those observed in the J–V measurement with errors below 5%. Space charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement was conducted to study hole and electron mobilities of the solar cells (Fig. 3c and d). PBDT-TEhBT:L8-BO blend exhibited hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of 8.65 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.33 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are superior to that of the PBDT-T12BT:L8-BO based solar cells (1.50 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, Table 1). The higher and balanced charge carrier mobilities of PBDT-TEhBT:L8-BO blend than that of PBDT-T12BT:L8-BO blend resulted in an enhanced JSC and FF value. PBDT-TEhBT as electron donor was also used to fabricate solar cells with other acceptors, which showed much improved PCEs compared to PBDT-T12BT based solar cells (Table S6†).

The photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) was measured to study charge generation and extraction properties, where Jph was saturated at Jsat as the Veff was close to 1 V.51 The exciton dissociation efficiency was determined using the equation P(E, T) = Jph/Jsat. As seen in Fig. 4a, when the measurements were conducted under the conditions of a short-circuit current, the two devices showed different trends of Jph–Veff curves. The poor exciton dissociation efficiency of the PBDT-T12BT:L8-BO based device could be indicated by the Jph–Veff curve, which was below the saturated photocurrent, while the P(E,T) values of PBDT-TEhBT:L8-BO devices was 97.3%. Therefore, PBDT-TEhBT:L8-BO based OSCs have a higher exciton dissociation efficiency. Meanwhile, the dependence of VOC and JSC on the light intensity was measured to study the charge recombination behavior in OSCs (Fig. 4b and c). Generally, VOC ∝ n·kBT/q·ln(Plight), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, and Plight is the incident light intensity. When the slope is close to 2kBT/q, monomolecular or trap-assisted charge recombination is dominant, while when the slope is close to kBT/q, the bimolecular charge recombination is dominant.52,53 The slopes of PBDT-T12BT and PBDT-TEhBT-based OSCs were 1.63kBT/q and 1.35kBT/q, respectively, indicating that the PBDT-T12BT based OSCs showed a nongeminate recombination and PBDT-TEhBT-based cells exhibited a typical geminate recombination. JSC ∝ Pαlight (α ≤ 1), where α is the exponential factor, which would be equal to 1 on completely suppressing the bimolecular recombination loss in devices.52–54 As shown in Fig. 4c, the α values of PBDT-T12BT and PBDT-TEhBT-based OSCs were 0.93 and 0.98, indicating the effectively suppressed and negligible bimolecular charge recombination in the PBDT-TEh:L8-BO-based OSCs. The higher extraction probability and lower charge recombination kinetics would result in the highest JSC and FF in photovoltaic devices.

The morphology and crystalline properties of the BT-polymers:L8-BO blends were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 5a and b and S6†) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement (Fig. 5c–e). The corresponding crystalline parameters are presented in Table 3. AFM height images showed that both blends showed relatively uniform and smooth surface morphology, and the root mean square roughness (RMS) of PBDT-T12BT- and PBDT-TEhBT-based blends were 0.81 nm and 1.13 nm, respectively. Compared with PBDT-T12BT-based blends, PBDT-TEhBT-based blend film exhibited a smoother surface with a more distinct phase separation and better interpenetrating networks, which facilitated the charge separation and transport in OSCs. In terms of GIWAXS measurement as shown in Fig. 5c and d, PBDT-T12BT blends exhibited a mixed molecular orientation with (010) peaks mainly in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and (100) lamellar stacking both in the OOP and in-plane (IP) direction, while the PBDT-TEhBT blends exhibited a preferential “face-on” packing motif. In addition, the d-spacing distance of the (100) lamellar stacking for PBDT-TEhBT with branched side chains was smaller than that of PBDT-T12BT with linear side chains. We then calculated the coherence lengths (CLs) of (100) and (010) peaks according to the Scherrer formula.55 As shown in Table 3, PBDT-TEhBT:L8-BO blends showed enhanced CL values both for (100) and (010) peaks, indicating a larger crystallite size than PBDT-T12BT blends. From the above analysis, it can be concluded that donor polymers with a branched side alkyl chain exhibit better crystallinity in thin films, which is beneficial for better charge transport in blended films.

3. Conclusion
We have successfully synthesized two conjugated polymers based on the BT unit and applied them into OSCs. The effect of side chains of conjugated polymers, linear or branched chains, on the crystallinity and photovoltaic properties was studied in detail. It was found that the BT-polymer with branched side units exhibited better crystallinity and hence much improved PCEs in OSCs. As a result, a high PCE of 15.5% in non-fullerene OSCs based on BT-polymer donors was obtained, representing the highest PCEs based on these polymers. We envision that BT-polymers with a rational design will show great potential in OSCs.
