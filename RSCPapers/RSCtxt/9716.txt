    , Accepted 31st May 2011First published on 23rd June 2011AbstractWe report on a flexible quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSSC) based on ZnO nanorods with a length of 2 μm. Due to the good coverage of CdSe QDs on ZnO by the electrophoretic deposition method, a maximum power conversion efficiency of ∼1% is achieved for the flexible QDSSC.
Recently, there has been increased interest in developing flexible photovoltaic cells based on plastic substrates.1 The flexible photovoltaic cells have many advantages: they are light weight, thin, bendable, produced at a low cost, and suitable for portable and wearable applications. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a multi-functional material with a wide direct band gap (3.37 eV) and large exciton binding energy (60 meV),2 and has attracted tremendous attention as a potential candidate for applications in field emissions,3dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),4 and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).5 Besides a proper energy level and high electronic mobility, ZnO has other unique advantages suitable for applications in QDSSC photoanodes. For example, ZnO can be grown on the flexible substrate by the hydrothermal method, which is considered to be used as the photoelectrode in the flexible photovoltaic cells.6
However, the efficiency of QDSSCs based on ZnO is rather low. One of the main reasons for the poor performance is the inadequate amount of QDs adsorbed onto the ZnO nanorod, which is due to the lower surface area of ZnO compared to mesoporous TiO2, thereby leading to the non-uniformly covered film on the surface. It was reported that QDs can be well dispersed on ZnO film by some methods, such as chemical bath deposition (CBD),7 and chemical adsorption using a bifunctional linker molecule.8 Recently, a fast and efficient method for assembling QDs on semiconductor surfaces has been reported. For example, Salant et al. have reported a better covered photoanode by using the electrophoretic deposition of CdSe QDs onto TiO2 mesoporous electrodes within 2 h under a DC voltage of 200 V.9 Kamat and co-workers also used the electrophoretic deposition method to fabricate a CNT-CdSe QD nanocomposite for employing in QDSSCs.10
Herein, we report the fabrication of the flexible QDSSC by electrophoretic deposition of CdSe QDs onto ZnO nanorods with low applied voltage. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.74% can be achieved for this flexible QDSSC.

        ZnO
        nanorod films were grown on ITO/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by a hydrothermal method at low temperature. In brief, a thin layer (50 nm) of ZnO seeds was deposited on the ITO/PET substrate by spin-coating a gel solution containing 0.02 M Zn(Ac)2 and 0.03 M NaOH in methanol.11 After drying at 80–90 °C for 1 h, the substrate was immersed into a 0.01 M zinc nitrate and 0.01 M hexamethylenetetramine solution in an autoclavable screw cap bottle and heated at 90 °C for 6 h. We synthesized oleic acid (OA)-capped CdSe QDs in a toluene/acetonitrile (1:1 vol%) solution.12 The CdSe toluene/acetonitrile solution (0.2 mM) was transferred to a small vial in which two ZnO electrodes were kept at a distance of 5 mm, and a DC voltage (30 V, 35 V, 40 V, 45 V and 50 V) was applied using a Keithley 2400 Sourcemeter. After 5 min, CdSe QDs were loaded on the ZnO electrode and the fabrication of the ZnO/CdSe photoanode was completed. Finally, we fabricated QDSSCs with Pt-sputtered ITO as the counter electrode using a thermal-plastic spacer, and an electrolyte solution which was composed of 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.6 M 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide in methoxyacetonitrile. After coating with a ZnS passivation layer against charge recombination in QDSSC,13 the flexible QDSSCs with 2.5 nm and 3.5 nm CdSe QDs were named as cell A and B, respectively.

Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of photoanodes with two different sizes of CdSe QDs in a toluene/acetonitrile (1:1 vol%) solution. From the excitonic transition peaks at 530 and 573 nm for the photoanodes, the sizes of these QDs are estimated to be 2.5 nm and 3.5 nm, respectively, based on the analysis reported in the literature.14

Fig. 1b shows the absorption spectra of ZnO/CdSe photoanodes fabricated by electrophoretic deposition of 3.5 nm CdSe QDs on a ZnO nanorod under the applied voltages of 30 V, 35 V, 40 V, 45 V and 50 V. It can be seen that the features at 465 and 573 nm appear, indicating the CdSe QDs are adsorbed onto the ZnO nanorod. The inset of Fig. 1b is the photo image of the photoanodes. When the applied voltage reaches 30 V, the color of the photoanode changes, indicating that some QDs are deposited on the ZnO nanorod. With the increased applied voltage, the color of the photoanode is deeper and deeper, demonstrating higher amounts of CdSe QDs migrating to the electrode and being deposited on the ZnO nanorod. The concentration of CdSe QDs adsorbed onto the photoanodes can be calculated by the concentration difference of the QD solutions before and after sensitization: 1.2 × 10−7 M, 1.8 × 10−7 M, 2.5 × 10−7 M, 2.9 × 10−6 M and 4.4 × 10−7 M for the five photoanodes with the applied voltage varied from 30 V to 50 V, respectively. It is worth noting that the applied voltage for electrophoretic deposition is needed as high as 210 V when the acetonitrile is not added into the CdSe–toluene solution.9 With the acetonitrile–CdSe solution, the deposition time and applied voltage can be largely reduced. However, when the applied voltage is exceeding 45 V, the adsorption intensity of the photoanode is reduced due to the aggregation of CdSe QDs and bad coverage of the ZnO surface.

Fig. 2a and b show the FESEM images of ZnO nanorods grown on ITO/PET before and after electrophoretic deposition of CdSe QDs under 45 V, respectively. It can be seen that the ZnO nanorod arrays grow vertically on the substrate with a diameter of 50–60 nm and a length of 2 μm. After sensitization of CdSe QDs by the electrophoretic deposition method, the ZnO nanorod surfaces are fully covered with CdSe QDs (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c shows the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum of the ZnO/CdSe photoanode. It can be seen that the ratio of Cd:Se is close to 1:1. The high concentration of carbon is mainly due to the oleic acid ligand which is linked to CdSe QDs. Fig. 2d shows the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of CdSe/ZnO. It can be seen that CdSe QDs were uniformly dispersed on the ZnO nanorod surface.

Fig. 3a shows I–V characteristics of QDSSCs with 3.5 nm CdSe QD deposited on the ZnO nanorod photoanode under different applied voltages. Table 1 shows the photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, PCE) of the flexible QDSSCs taken from the I–V characteristics curves. It can be seen that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) increases as the applied voltage increases, which implies that the amount of CdSe QDs adsorbed on ZnO increases. Accordingly, Voc is also enhanced because the quasi-Fermi level in the ZnO increases with the increase in density of the electrons injected from the CdSe QDs into the ZnO conduction band.15 Meanwhile, the increase in fill factor (FF) indicates that the charge recombination is reduced due to the better coverage of CdSe QDs on the ZnO nanorod surface. Belaidi et al. have pointed out that the variation of I–V parameters is related to the thickness of absorber on the ZnO surface.16 In our case, the absorbance of the photoanode is increased with the increase in applied voltage, thereby leading to an increased Jsc. With the increased thickness of CdSe QDs on the ZnO surface, the shunt resistance of the cell is largely increased, leading to a increase in Voc from 0.47 to 0.58 V, and FF from 29.9 to 47.4%. However, when the applied voltage exceeds 45 V, the thickness of the CdSe QD on the ZnO surface is still increasing. The series resistance is increased, resulting in a decreased FF and PCE value due to the lower diffusion length of QD than that of the photo-generated charge carriers.16 Therefore, the maximum PCE value of QDSSC is 0.74% with Jsc = 2.70 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.58 V, and FF = 47.4% with an applied voltage of 45 V.

Fig. 3b shows the Nyquist plots of the five cells at a frequency range from 10−1 Hz to 106 Hz, with an AC amplitude of 10 mV under the illumination of one Sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The region (101–102 Hz) of the EIS spectrum was associated with the chemical capacitance (CPE1) of the ZnO nanorod and the charge recombination resistances (Rr).17 The high-frequency peak (102–105 Hz) can be fitted to a charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the chemical capacitance (CPE2), which is due to the charge transfer at the interfaces of the redox electrolyte/Pt counter electrode.18 The inset of Fig. 3b is the equivalent circuit. Rs is the series resistance. Using the equivalent circuit, Rs, Rr and Rct values at various applied voltages can be measured, shown in Table S1 (ESI)†. From Fig. 3b, it can be seen that two semi-circles exist in the high-frequency region and middle-frequency region for these cells. It is clear that the Rr value for the flexible QDSSC applied with 45 V is found to be smaller than the other cells, demonstrating that the charge recombination is efficiently suppressed in the QDSSC. And it also displays the lowest value of Rct among these cells, indicating that more efficient charge transfer process occurs at electrolyte/Pt electrode interfaces. Therefore, higher FF and PCE values for this cell can be obtained.

Fig. 3c and d show the I–V characteristics of cell A and B before and after bending to a radius of 5 mm under simulated 100 mW cm−2 irradiation, and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of cell A and B. From Fig. 3c, it can be seen that PCE increases from 0.62% (cell A) to 0.98% (cell B) mainly due to the increased Jsc from 2.60 mA cm−2 (cell A) to 3.58 mA cm−2 (cell B), consistent with the IPCE trend in Fig. 3d. The green curves shown in Fig. 3c are cell A and B measured under strong bending to 5 mm, resulting in the reduced Jsc values, FFs and PCEs. The reduced PCE value of QDSSC upon bending is attributed to the loss of light absorption, which is reflected in the decreased value of Jsc. Meanwhile, when the flexible QDSSC is bent, the contact between Pt and electrolyte becomes non-uniform, subsequently decreasing the efficiency of the redox reaction in the electrolyte. Therefore, the FF value is lowered, indicating that the charge recombination rate is enhanced after mechanical bending. The inset of Fig. 3d shows the photo images of the flexible cell after bending to a radius of 5 mm.
In Fig. 3d, the IPCE peak matches the first exciton absorption as shown in Fig. 1b exactly, i.e. at 530 and 573 nm. The maximum IPCE is 13% for cell A and 22% for cell B at the wavelength of 400 nm. It can be seen that cell B has a broader spectrum than cell A, indicating that more photons can be adsorbed by the photoanode of cell B. Therefore, the photocurrent is generated in a wider range for cell B, leading to higher values of Jsc and PCE (Fig. 3c). The inset in Fig. 3d shows the photographs of cell A and B after bending to a radius of 5 mm with the color changing from orange to red, which is in agreement with the absorption spectra.
The flexible QDSSCs have been fabricated by using the electrophoretic deposition of CdSe QDs on ZnO nanorods. Due to the large loading and good coverage of CdSe QDs on ZnO film with optimal applied voltage, a PCE value of 0.98% for the flexible QDSSC can be obtained.
