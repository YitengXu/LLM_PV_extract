    , Accepted 22nd April 2014First published on 23rd April 2014AbstractIn this work, hexagonal phase NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanocrystals were obtained by solvothermal method. The upconversion emission tuning from green to red in NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanocrystals was successfully achieved by replacing Y3+ ions in the nanocrystal structure with Ce3+ ions under 980 nm excitation. The red upconversion emission intensity was enhanced with Ce3+ concentration increasing. The output colors for the samples can be clearly observed in a confocal microscopy setup. It was found that two efficient cross-relaxation processes between Ho3+ and Ce3+ ions had been employed to enhance red emission and suppress green emission. The possible upconversion mechanisms and conversion efficiency between Ho3+ and Ce3+ ions were investigated in detail. In addition, the influence of the matrix and surface properties on the upconversion emission of the samples was also discussed. The red upconversion emission of Yb3+, Ho3+ and Gd3+ codoped nanocrystals in this work will have great potential applications in biological imaging, magnetic resonance imaging agents, and display and anti-counterfeiting applications.
1. Introduction
Rare-earth (RE) doped upconversion (UC) materials have presented great potential applications in lighting, solar cells, three-dimensional displays, solid-state lasers, biological markers and imaging due to their unique emission properties in the infrared to visible light region.1–7 Especially, the hexagonal phase NaYF4 crystals have been considered as a most efficient UC emission host materials because of their low phonon energy.8–10 It was reported that they are bright enough so that a single UC nanocrystal with a diameter of 27 nm can be observed by confocal microscopy.11 Many different synthesis methods have been employed to obtain NaYF4 nanoparticles, including hydrothermal method, solvothermal routes, high-temperature thermal decomposition of trifluoroacetate precursors, and liquid–solid two-phase approaches.12–16 Note that the structure, morphology and size of nanoparticles can be successfully tuned by adjusting the reaction time, temperature, pH value, adding capping agents and codoping different ions.17–20 For example, Liu and his co-workers showed that by introducing additional RE ion, such as Gd3+ ion, at a high doping level in NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ crystallites can decrease the crystallization reaction time and temperature, resulting in ultra-small hexagonal phase UC nanocrystals.21 In addition, Gd3+-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals exhibit paramagnetism at room temperature, originating from the intrinsic magnetic moment of Gd3+ ions in the host.22,23 Hence, Gd3+-doped UC nanocrystals have been widely studied as bio-imaging and magnetic resonance imaging agents.
Obtaining a pure single UC emission has been the focus of extensive research and remains a challenge to date. Because of the abundance of 4 fN electronic states in lanthanide ions, they typically emit multicolor fluorescence emission that is tunable from ultraviolet to near-infrared (NIR). Many approaches can produce multicolor UC emissions, which include doping different ions, changing crystal structure, surface modification and tuning particle size and morphology.24–27 Recently, several attempts have been made to obtain a high-purity, single-band UC red emission that is attractive for anti-counterfeiting and color display applications.28 High red-to-green emission ratio was achieved by increasing Yb3+ concentration in Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals.29 In addition, Mn2+ co-doped NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals exhibited pure single-band red UC emission because of the energy transfer between the Er3+ and Mn2+ ions.30 Similar to Er3+, Ho3+ is an intriguing active ion for UC emission because it has a broad fluorescence spectrum that ranges from vacuum ultraviolet to near infrared.31 Typically, the UC emission from Yb3+ and Ho3+ codoped systems results in an intense green emission accompanied by a weak red emission.32–34 However, few reports have been found on the red emission enhancement in Yb3+ and Ho3+ codoped system. The enhanced red UC emission is observed in LaF3:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanoparticles due to the presence of organic ligands that stabilize the nanoparticles and quench green emission, and high phonon energy host of YVO4 nanocrystals with high Yb3+ concentration.35,36 Zhang et al. had reported that the UC emission from Yb3+/Ho3+ codoped cubic phase NaYF4 nanocrystals was tuned from green to red by introducing Ce3+ ions.37 Trivalent cerium ions have a simple energy structure, and have been considered as an ideal candidate for enhancing the population of intermediate excited state 5I7 of Ho3+ that can result in a strong red UC emission.38 It is well known that the UC emission intensity of the hexagonal NaYF4 (β-NaYF4) nanocrystals is much stronger than that of the cubic-phase NaYF4 (α-NaYF4) ones.39,40 Tuning UC fluorescence emission of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanocrystals from green to red by codoping Ce3+ ions will extend their application to color display applications and biological images. However, studies on tuning UC emission in the β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanocrystals by codoping Ce3+ ions have been barely reported.41 In this study, we attempted to tune the UC emission in β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanorods through codoping with Ce3+ ions, and systematically studied their spectral properties with a confocal microscopy setup. The UC emission mechanism and cross-relaxation (CR) processes were investigated carefully.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Materials
All chemicals used in the current study were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Y(NO3)3·6H2O, Yb(NO3)3·6H2O, Ho(NO3)3·6H2O and Gd(NO3)3·6H2O are obtained by dissolving Y2O3, Yb2O3, Ho2O3 and Gd2O3 (99.99%. Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Co.), respectively, in dilute nitric acid solution at elevated temperature followed by evaporating the superfluous nitric acid. Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Co. HNO3 (65.0–68.0%), NaF (98.0%), NaOH (98.0%), oleic acid (90.0%) and ethanol (99.7%) were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
2.2. Synthesis of β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+/Ce3+ nanocrystals
β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+/Ce3+ nanocrystals were synthesized via a solvothermal method by using oleic acid as a stabilizing agent, for which the detailed process is given in ref. 21. Ethanol (10.0 ml), oleic acid (12.0 ml) and 2.0 ml solution of 0.6 g NaOH were mixed under stirring. Then, 1.0 ml of RE(NO3)3 (0.5 M, RE = Y, Gd, Yb, Ho and Ce) solution and 3.0 ml of NaF (1.0 M) solution were added under vigorous stirring for about 15 minutes. Subsequently, the colloidal solution was transferred into a 40 ml of Teflon-line autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 hours. The final products were collected by centrifugation, and washing with deionized water and ethanol for several times. The collected samples were finally dried at 60 °C for several hours.
2.3. Sample characterization and spectral measurement
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement were performed with a D/Max2550VB+/PC X-ray diffraction meter with Cu Kα (40 kV, 40 mA) irradiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The XRD spectra were recorded at a scanning rate of 8° min−1. The morphology of the particles was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 200). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was measured with a Brucher EQUINX55 spectrometer. For spectroscopic measurements, YAG:Nd3+ (Quanta Ray Lab-170) pulse laser and Ti sapphire femtosecond laser (Mira-900) were employed as excitation sources. The spectrometer (SP2750i, 0.008 nm) with a PIXIS 100 charge coupled device (CCD, ACTON) and a PD471 photomultiplier tube (PMT, ACTON) was used for luminescence collection and detection. The luminescence photographs were obtained by a confocal microscope (OLYMPUS-BX51) and camera (Canon 600D). The appropriate notch filters were placed in front of the entrance of the monochromator to block the scattering light. All of the spectroscopic measurements were carried out at room temperature.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. XRD and TEM
The typical XRD patterns of NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+ nanocrystals with different Ce3+ concentrations are given in Fig. 1. All the strong and sharp diffraction peaks from the samples with or without Ce3+ are indexed to pure hexagonal-phase NaYF4 (JCDPS no. 16-0334). No obvious extra diffraction peaks were detected even with the increase in Ce3+ ion concentration to 12%, indicating the formation of a Y–Gd–Ce solid solution. In addition, it is noticed that the diffraction peaks shifted slightly to the low angle side as a result of the increase in unit-cell volume because of the substitution of Y3+ (r = 0.115 nm) ions by bigger Ce3+ (r = 0.128 nm) ions in the host lattice (Fig. 1).42,43

Fig. 2 shows typical TEM images and EDS spectra of β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanoparticles with codoping different Ce3+ concentrations. A series of Ce3+-doped β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanorod crystals have an average diameter of 28 nm and a length of 320 nm, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a–c). These results suggested that codoping Ce3+ ions had no obvious effect on the size and morphology of the β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanorods. Further high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the nanorod showed an interplanar spacing of 0.52 nm, corresponding to the {100} planes of β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4 nanorods in Fig. 2(d). This result confirmed that the nanorods grow along the c-axis, namely, the [0001] direction.44 The fast Fourier transform diffraction patterns obtained from the HRTEM image confirmed that the single crystalline nature of the nanorods, as shown in inset of Fig. 2(d). The incorporation of Ce3+ ions was further proved by performing the EDS under SEM measurement for β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+ and β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+/12%Ce3+ nanorods, as shown in Fig. 2(e and f). The EDS results confirmed that the main elemental components of the samples are Na, Y, Yb, Ho, Ce, Gd and F in Fig. 2(e and f). The intensity of the Y elemental peak was reduced after introduction of Ce3+, which further indicated that Y3+ ions were substituted for Ce3+ in β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4 host lattice.

3.2. Effective color tuning to the UC emission

3.2.1. UC emission and corresponding transitions. 
The UC luminescence emission of β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanorods with codoping Ce3+ was measured with a confocal microscopy setup. Fig. 3 displays the UC emission spectra, the luminescence photographs, the peak area of the green and red emission, intensity ratio of red to green (R/G) emission, and the CIE chromaticity coordinate diagram of β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanorods with codoping Ce3+ concentration from 0% to 12% under NIR 980 nm excitation. The dominant emission peaks at 541 nm and 644 nm are assigned to the transitions of 5S2/5F4 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 of Ho3+ ions in Fig. 3(a).33,34 Some weak blue emission (484 nm) and NIR emission (750 nm) can also be observed, which are associated with the transitions 5F3 → 5I8 and 5S2/5F4 → 5I7, respectively. Interestingly, with the increase of the Ce3+ concentration from 4% to 12%, the increase of green emission is inhibited, and the red emission rises gradually, which can be confirmed by the comparison of peak area of the green and red emissions in Fig. 2(b). The output color of β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanorods is tuned from green to red (in inset of Fig. 3(a)), and the R/G ratio increase from 0.64 to 7.31 in Fig. 3(c). Accordingly, the CIE chromaticity coordinate (x, y) is also changed from (0.2811, 0.6624) to (0.6110, 0.3106) as the Ce3+ concentration increased from 0% to 12% in Table 1, which is an obvious indication of the luminescence color change. The region of tunable luminescence color in β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanorods with different Ce3+ concentration is shown in Fig. 3(d).

To understand the observed phenomenon, the energy levels and possible relaxations and transitions of Yb3+/Ho3+/Ce3+ system were illustrated in Fig. 4. It is known that Yb3+ ions have a larger absorption cross-section for infrared light and longer excited state lifetime than that of Ho3+. Thus, the main pathway, assumed to populate the upper emitting states of Ho3+ ions, should be through the energy transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+ ions. Under NIR 980 nm excitation, 5I6, 5F5, and 5S2/5F4 states of Ho3+ were populated through three successive energy transfer (ET) processes from Yb3+ to Ho3+. The strong green (541 nm) and very weak NIR (750 nm) emissions can be generated through radiative relaxations from the 5F4/5S2 states to the 5I8 and 5I7 states. The transition from the 5F5 state to the 5I8 ground state produces strong red UC emission at 644 nm. There are two possible processes to populate the excited state 5F5. One is the nonradiative transition from the higher excited states of 5F4/5S2. The other is the population of the long-lived 5I7 level initially by the nonradiative 5I6 → 5I7 or by radiative decay of 5F4/5S2 → 5I7, and then populating the 5F5 level of 5F4/5S2 → 5I7, and then populating the 5F5 level through the ET process from Yb3+ to Ho3+. However, the nonradiative transition probability strongly depends on the phonon energy of the host lattice. The multiphonon nonradiative relaxation rate WNR(T) can be expressed by:45 (1)where WNR(T) is the rate at temperature T; ΔE is the energy gap between two energy levels; and hν is the phonon energy of the host. According to the energy gap law, nonradiative transitions can barely occur when the gap between the two energy states in an activator is much larger than that of the vibration energy of the host lattice.46 Thus, the above mentioned two nonradiative relaxation processes should not be efficient because both energy gaps are about 3000 cm−1 large, which is approximately eight times that of the maximum phonon energy of NaYF4 host (370 cm−1).8,47 This explains the experimental observation of relatively weaker red emission and small R/G ratio in the UC luminescence spectra for the samples before Ce3+ ions are codoped (see Fig. 3).

3.2.2. Effective color tuning by Ce3+ ions. 
As presented in Fig. 3, the red emission is increased when Ce3+ is introduced into the system, and the overall color of the UC emission is gradually tuned to red. In order to investigate the mechanism of tunable color induced by different amounts of Ce3+, the pumping power dependence of the green and red emission of β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+ nanorods with codoping Ce3+ was firstly measured, as shown in Fig. 5. The slopes of 1.91 and 1.86 of the green and red emission of β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+ nanorods were obtained by fitting the experimental data in Fig. 5(a), and the slopes of 1.81 and 1.71 of the green and red emission of β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+/12%Ce3+ were obtained by fitting the experimental data in Fig. 5(b). It is should be noted that the slopes of red emission in β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+/12%Ce3+ nanorods were slightly smaller than that without codoping Ce3+ in β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+ nanorods. This was mainly attributed to the two-photon 5S2/5F4 → 5I7 process, populating the intermediate level of the UC red in β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+ nanorods, which is canceled in β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+/12%Ce3+ nanorods due to the quenching of the green UC emission. To explore the mechanism of Ce3+ to change the emission of Ho3+, we plot the energy diagram of Ce3+ to the right side of Ho3+ in Fig. 4. Considering that the energy gap of Ce3+ is also about 3000 cm−1, which is similar to the non-radiation relaxation gaps of Ho3+ that are involved in the red emissions, the possible cross relaxation process between Ce3+ and Ho3+ could effectively increase the population of the 5F5 and 5I7 of Ho3+, leading to the enhancement of red emission. Specifically, the CR processes of 5S2/5F4 (Ho3+) + 2F5/2 (Ce3+) → 5F5 (Ho3+) + 2F7/2 (Ce3+) and 5I6 (Ho3+) + 2F5/2 (Ce3+) → 5I7 (Ho3+) + 2F7/2 (Ce3+) occurred after Ce3+ is codoped to the β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ system. These two resonant energy transfer processes can effectively increase the populations of 5F5 and 5I7 states from the 5S2/5F4 and 5I6 states, thereby increasing the red emission and reducing the green emission.

The steady-state rate equations were established based on the UC processes in Yb3+ and Ho3+ ion systems in order to further verify the proposed UC mechanism and explain an enhancement of the red emission due to the presence of Ce3+ codoping. We firstly introduce NHo(Yb),i, Wi, and Wij (i > j, i, j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) to denote the population densities, radiative, and nonradiative transition rates of 5I8, 5I7, 5I6, 5I5, 5I4, 5F5 and 5S2/5F4 states of Ho3+, and 2F7/2 and 2F5/2 of Yb3+ ions, respectively. k1, k2 and k3 are defined as energy transfer rates from the excited Yb3+ to 5I6, 5F5, and 5S2/5F4 states of Ho3+ ions, respectively. r1 and r2 are the cross-relaxations coefficients between Ho3+ and Ce3+ at 5I6 and 5S2/5F4 states, and NCe0 denotes the population density of the ground state2F5/2 of Ce3+ ions. Considering that the radiative relaxation probability of the 5I5 and 5I4 states is very low due to the small neighbored energy gap, we ignore the terms of radiation rates in the rate equations. Thus, the rate equations for the discussed system are formulated as follows:37 (2a) (2b) (2c) (2d)
Taking dNi/dt = 0, and solving the eqn (2a)–(d), one can get the following formula for NHo,2, NHo,5 and NHo,6. (3) (4) (5)
Based on eqn (4) and (5), we can get the mathematical expression of R/G ratio: (6)
Thus, the R/G ratio increases with the increase of r1 and r2. However, r1 and r2 are determined by the distance of doping ions. The distance between the ions affects the energy transfer between them; therefore, with increase of Ce3+ concentration, the value of r1 and r2 should increase, leading to the enhancement of red emission from Ho3+. This agrees well with experimental observation (see Fig. 3(a)).
The effect of Ce3+ concentration on the enhancement of transitions between Ho3+ and Ce3+ can be further proved by observing NIR emission of Ho3+ at 1180 nm. Fig. 6 shows the NIR emission of the 5I6 → 5I8 transition of Ho3+ ions in β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+ nanorods with codoping Ce3+ concentration from 0% to 12% under 980 nm. The NIR emission intensity decreases with Ce3+ concentration increasing, which demonstrates the occurrence of CR1 of 5I6 (Ho3+) + 2F5/2 (Ce3+) → 5I7 (Ho3+) + 2F7/2 (Ce3+). The radiative transition rates of the 5I6 and 5I7 states of Ho3+ ions are supposed to be much larger than their UC emission rates.37 Thus, the UC emission rates can be ignored in the eqn (3). According to eqn (3), we can get: (7)

Based on eqn (7) and the measured relative fluorescent intensity in Fig. 6, we get: (8)
The conversion efficiency of the CR1 process is: (9)
This result indicates that the CR1 process of 5I6 (Ho3+) + 2F5/2 (Ce3+) → 5I7 (Ho3+) + 2F7/2 (Ce3+) is very efficient.
To assess the occurrence of CR2 process of 5S2/5F4 (Ho3+) + 2F5/2 (Ce3+) → 5F5 (Ho3+) + 2F7/2 (Ce3+) between Ho3+ and Ce3+ ions, we considered the 532 nm photons and directly excited Ho3+ to the 5S2(5F4) excited states. The down-conversion emission spectra of β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:20%Yb3+/2%Ho3+ nanorods with different Ce3+ concentrations is shown in Fig. 7(a). It was found that the green UC emission intensity was reduced, while the red UC emission was increased with increasing Ce3+ concentration, and the corresponding R/G ratio was changed from 0.22 to 0.85 in Fig. 7(b). According to the energy level diagram of Ho3+, the population of the 5F5 state mostly originated from 5S2/5F4 excited states by the nonradiative relaxation in Fig. 7(c). Thus, the enhancement of red emission can effectively indicate the occurrence of CR2 process of 5S2/5F4 (Ho3+) + 2F5/2 (Ce3+) → 5F5 (Ho3+) + 2F7/2 (Ce3+) between Ho3+ and Ce3+. The conversion efficiency of the CR2 process can be calculated based on the following equation:48 (10)where τ and τ′ are the decay time of Ho3+ with and without the presence of Ce3+ in the sample, respectively. The measured fluorescence decay times of 5S2/5F4 state are 154.6 μs and 98.4 μs for 0% and 12% Ce3+ (Fig. 7(b)), respectively. Thus, the efficiency, η2, is 36.3% for 12% Ce3+ ions doped sample. This result indicates that the CR2 process plays the assistant role for the CR1 process to covert the green UC emission into red UC emission.

3. 2. 3.  The possible influence of the surface and matrix properties. 
It is well known that the UC efficiency of nanocrystals depends on the surface impurity and the matrix properties, which indicates that the presence of organic ligands on the surface of the samples could also result in the enhancement of red emission. Hence, it is necessary to measure FTIR spectrum for identifying the chemical bonds at the sample surface. Fig. 8 presents the FTIR spectrum with different Ce3+ concentration. Several vibration bands were observed from β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanorods with different Ce3+ concentration. The bands in the regions 1350 cm−1–1700 cm−1 and 2800 cm−1–3050 cm−1 corresponded to the vibrations of the CO and CH2 groups in the oleic acid, respectively, whereas the broad band at around 3450 cm−1 is ascribed to the O–H stretching vibration that originated from the oleic acid and water.49 These results show the existence of capping ligands on the surface of samples, but no evident change is detected after Ce3+ is introduced to the samples, even when its concentration is increased to 12%. This indicates that the possible nonradiative relaxations from the surface capping ligands of the nanorods are not rampant even when Ce3+ ion is codoped in the host, which suggests that the output color tuning of the UC emission is caused by the CR processes between Ho3+ and Ce3+.

More samples, including the β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+ microplates and microprisms codoping with Ce3+ ions, were also prepared for studying the morphology and matrix dependence of the discussed color tuning with Ce3+ ions. The XRD, SEM, EDS and CIE chromaticity (x, y) of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+ microplates and microprisms with codoping Ce3+ concentration of 0%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 12% are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 and Table S1.† The stronger diffraction peaks of XRD patterns (Fig. S1†) of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+ microplates and microprisms with codoping Ce3+ ions indicate that they have high crystallinity. Fig. S2† shows that β-NaYF4 particles are regular microplates and microprisms, and codoping of Ce3+ has no effect on the morphology of β-NaYF4 crystals. The spectral measurement on the UC emissions from Ho3+ in two groups of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+ crystals with different shapes presents similar color change by a third codopant Ce3+, which is presented in Fig. 9(a) and (b). The R/G ratio of the microplates and microprisms increased from 1.24 to 10.06 and from 0.52 to 7.02, respectively, as shown in Fig. 9(c). The corresponding luminescence photographs are shown by the inset of Fig. 9(a) and (b). The CIE chromaticity coordinates for microplates and microprisms are approaching the red region from yellow and green region, respectively, as shown in Fig. 9(d). Thus, the UC emission of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+ crystals can also be tuned to red by codoping Ce3+ ions, but the tunable regions of UC emission are different for different host morphologies. That is to say, the tunable fluorescence emission not only depends on the sensitized ion, but also relies on the morphology and the host matrix.

4. Conclusions
The UC luminescence emissions were successfully tuned in β-NaY(Gd0.4)F4:Yb3+/Ho3+ nanorods by introducing Ce3+ ions. The effects of Ce3+ ions on the UC luminescence of the nanorods were studied with 980 nm excitation, and the corresponding mechanism was investigated. It was found that the R/G ratio was increased by increasing Ce3+ concentration, which was primarily attributed to the two efficient CR processes of 5S2/5F4 (Ho3+) + 2F5/2 (Ce3+) → 5F5 (Ho3+) + 2F7/2 (Ce3+) and 5I6 (Ho3+) + 2F5/2 (Ce3+) → 5I7 (Ho3+) + 2F7/2 (Ce3+) between the Ho3+ and Ce3+ ions. The conversion efficiency of CR1 and CR2 was calculated based on steady-state equations, which indicated that the CR2 process plays the assistant role for the CR1 process to convert the green UC emission into red UC emission. Further observation on the color change of UC emission from β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Ho3+ microplates and microprisms through codoping Ce3+ suggested that Ce3+ is an effective sensitizer to tune UC emissions for extending their application in display and biological images, and the color tuning range and emission intensity were also affected by the host material and the morphology of particle samples.
