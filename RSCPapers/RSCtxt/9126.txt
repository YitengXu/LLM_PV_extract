    , Accepted 30th July 2019First published on 31st July 2019AbstractControl of interfacial layers is highly effective in tuning charge injection and transport processes in various organic optoelectronic architectures for high device performance. Herein, we developed a thermal imprinting and vapor annealing (TIVA) method to regulate the microstructures of the widely used poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) interfacial layer. The introduced ammonia vapor can reduce the acidity of the PSS units and facilitate the formation of continuous hole-transport channels. Meanwhile, the sub-micron patterns can be efficiently transferred from the flexible template to the PEDOT:PSS layer via thermal imprinting (TI) treatment. Interestingly, the synergistic effects on the PEDOT:PSS hole-injection layer (HIL) result in a current efficiency (CE) of 36.62 cd A−1, power efficiency (PE) of 27.60 lm W−1 and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 18.80% with a more than 35% efficiency enhancement for the blue phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). This novel TIVA method applied to the regulation of a PEDOT:PSS HIL benefits the performance of PhOLEDs in two ways: (1) to regulate the microstructures of PEDOT:PSS and construct continuous hole-transport channels in the intrinsic PEDOT:PSS layer, and (2) to enlarge the interfacial contact and thus create more hole-transport paths from HIL to hole-transporting layer. These findings will provide a new platform for the rational regulation of HILs with efficient and rich charge-transport channels and thus further advance the realization of high-performance OLEDs.
Introduction
Sandwiched between metal electrodes and organic active layers, cathode/anode interfacial layers play a critical role in various optoelectronic devices, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),1,2 organic photovoltaics (OPVs),3 perovskite light emitting diodes4–6 and solar cells (PSCs).7,8 The introduced interfacial layers can modify the work function of the metal electrodes, decreasing the carrier injection barrier, smoothing the surface of electrodes and enhancing the adhesion to the organic active layer. Therefore, the research on interfacial engineering has been an important aspect in the rapid development of various optoelectronic devices. Besides the sophisticated design of novel interfacial materials ranging from metal oxides, polymers/small-molecules, and metal salts/complexes, to organic–inorganic composites,9–11 many physical strategies such as solvent treatment,12–14 introduction of dopants,15,16 surface modification by dipole layers17 and employing periodical patterns18,19 have also been reported focusing on the interfacial structure modifications.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) composed of conducting polymer PEDOT and water-soluble insulating polymer PSS is one of the most widely used interfacial layer materials. Due to its high optical transmittance, high mechanical flexibility, and excellent thermal stability, PEDOT:PSS materials functioning as hole-injection layers (HILs) for OLED devices and hole-transporting layers (HTLs) for OPV/PSC devices have been widely reported.20,21 To further regulate the microstructural and electrical characteristics of solution-processed PEDOT:PSS interfacial layers, solvent treatment as one of the most efficient methods is widely used in various optoelectronic devices. For example, Kim et al. demonstrated a significant improvement in the cohesion and electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the OLED devices using DMSO doped PEDOT:PSS films exhibited an 18% increased current efficiency.22 Wei et al. reported that adding ethylene glycol (EG) to the PEDOT:PSS solution improved the crystallinity of PEDOT and the ordering of the PEDOT nanocrystals in the solid films, thus increasing the carrier mobility from 0.045 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 by ion-gel transistors.23 Liu et al. introduced alcohol based vapor annealing of PEDOT:PSS layers for fabricating inverted PSCs; solvent vapor annealing (SVA) induced improved hole conductivity and enhanced phase separation between PEDOT and PSS, yielding an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 16.1 to 17.3%.24 These results indicate that solvent treatment is an efficient regulation means in adjusting the nature of the PEDOT:PSS interfacial layer.
Although the physical properties of the PEDOT:PSS interfacial layer can be well regulated via different kinds of solvent treatments, the acidic nature (pH ∼ 1) originating from the PSS dopant25–27 was seldom adjusted in view of the fact that the introduced solvent molecules generally could not directly react with PEDOT:PSS. Moreover, the charge-transport channels may be affected by the insulating PSS aggregates during solvent treatment. In order to realize the adjustment of the PEDOT:PSS interfacial layer from multiple perspectives, a novel approach of thermal imprinting and vapor annealing (TIVA) was developed to regulate the PEDOT:PSS interfacial layer. Unlike the commonly used solvents, volatile aqueous ammonia [NH3(aq)] was employed to adjust the PEDOT:PSS layer here. Since NH3 could react with the PSS polymer, both the acidity and the work function (WF) of PEDOT:PSS would be altered upon NH3(aq) SVA treatment. The applied thermal imprinting (TI) technique would further strengthen the effect of NH3 on the PEDOT:PSS layer with the assistance of a flexible patterned poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) template. Meanwhile, the sub-micron stripes with an enlarged interfacial area were built up on the HIL through TI treatment. The synergistic effects of NH3 vapor and the patterned template could optimize hole-transport channels in both the PEDOT:PSS layer and the HIL/HTL contact interface, thus achieving a 35% external quantum efficiency (EQE) enhancement for blue phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs). Therefore, the novel film-processing method could expand the route of interfacial modification and hold great potential for various high-performance organic optoelectronic devices.
Results and discussion
Thermal imprinting and vapor annealing (TIVA)
In this work, we present a novel approach for the regulation of the PEDOT:PSS interfacial layer via the TIVA method, as shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, a PDMS template with periodic stripes was pressed on the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS layer, during which thermal annealing (TA) treatment was employed. During this period, the sub-micron pattern is transferred from the PDMS template to the PEDOT:PSS layer with the assistance of the thermal imprinting (TI) treatment. NH3(aq) as a weak base is expected to modify the acidic nature and the electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, the NH3(aq) SVA treatment was applied to the sub-micron patterned PEDOT:PSS layer. To take advantage of the solvent adsorption ability of the PDMS polymer matrix, the PDMS template was not peeled off until the SVA treatment was finished. Finally, the following functional layers were separately thermally evaporated to fabricate the integrated PhOLEDs.

Since the PDMS template remains in contact with the PEDOT:PSS interfacial layer during TIVA, the function of the PDMS template in the regulation of the HIL needs to be further investigated. To reveal the role of the PDMS template in different processing stages, several PEDOT:PSS references were fabricated under different processing conditions. As one of the references, the PDMS template was peeled off immediately after the PEDOT:PSS layer was treated by the TI technique. Then, the PEDOT:PSS layer without the PDMS template was further treated by SVA. In addition, the pristine PEDOT:PSS layers just processed by NH3(aq) SVA or TI as two other references were also prepared and investigated.
Properties of modified PEDOT:PSS layer
The effect of NH3(aq) vapor on the nature of PEDOT:PSS was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and pH measurement. The XPS spectra (Fig. 1a) show two characteristic S 2p peaks from the PEDOT:PSS layers: the S 2p peak with a binding energy of 167–171 eV represents the sulfur atoms in the PSS units, whereas the relatively smaller S 2p peak with a binding energy of 163–166 eV corresponds to the sulfur atoms in the PEDOT units.28,29 Since the water-soluble PSS units are closely concerned with the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS, the NH3(aq) vapor treatment mainly affects the molecular state of the PSS unit. The two decomposed peaks near 169 eV correspond to the neutral and ionic sulphur in the PSS dopant.30 Specifically, the spin-split peak at 169.4 eV (blue line) originates from the neutral sulfonic acid group (–SO3H), and the additional peak at 168.0 eV (green line) originates from the ionic sulfonate group (–SO3−).31,32 After NH3(aq) SVA treatment, the relative magnitude of these two peaks (peak area ratio: A169.4/A168.0) decreases from 0.958 to 0.660, indicating the formation of more ionic sulfonate groups (–SO3−NH4+). Meanwhile, the appearance of the N 1s peak at around 402 eV further demonstrates the formation of ammonium salt after NH3(aq) SVA. Further confirmation for the effect of the NH3(aq) vapor on the PEDOT:PSS layer was obtained using FTIR spectra (Fig. 1b). With the treatment of the NH3(aq) SVA method, the stretching vibration modes of the OH group appearing at around 3400 cm−1 are shifted to the low-frequency region (3137 cm−1) and the peak corresponding to the bending modes of ammonium ions at 1400 cm−1 becomes more pronounced.33 These variations indicate that the introduced NH3 molecules could indeed react with the acidic PSS units and form ammonium salts.

As a hole injection material, the WF of a PEDOT:PSS layer plays a crucial part in determining the efficiency and performance of its OLED devices. Here, the WFs of PEDOT:PSS with and without (W/O) NH3(aq) SVA treatment were characterized by UPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 1c, the secondary-electron cut-off (Ecut-off) at 16.08 eV indicates that the WF of pristine PEDOT:PSS is around 5.14 eV. After SVA treatment, the Ecut-off shifts towards a higher binding energy and the corresponding WF value is decreased to 4.95 eV. In fact, the energy barrier between the HIL (PEDOT:PSS) and the HTL (TAPC: −5.30 eV) exhibits a certain degree of increase after SVA treatment, which will inevitably inhibit the hole injection process from the ITO electrode to the emitting layer. To investigate the variation in acidic properties, the solid PEDOT:PSS layers treated by NH3 vapor for different times were redissolved in water and the pH values of the corresponding solutions were characterized by a pH meter (Fig. 1d). The pH value increases from 1.73 to 2.73 with increased treatment time, which further demonstrates that a portion of acidic PSS units could react with NH3 molecules and the extent of the neutralization reaction is determined by SVA treatment time. Besides, the film transmittance of the HIL, which is relevant to the final device performance, was also investigated by using UV-vis transmission spectra and the PEDOT:PSS layers fabricated W/O and with post-treatments all show high transmittance (Fig. S1, ESI†).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atom force microscopy (AFM) were applied to explore the morphologies of the PEDOT:PSS layer and the upper surface features of the integrated device with different post-treatments (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, there is no significant variation occurring in the surface morphology of the PEDOT:PSS layer before and after NH3(aq) SVA treatment. The film roughness of the PEDOT:PSS layer enhances only slightly from 1.41 to 1.50 nm, which should be related to the aggregation of PSS units during SVA treatment. Except for the SVA post-treatment, the TI strategy was also employed to regulate the interfacial properties of the PEDOT:PSS layer. As shown in Fig. 2c, the pattern of the PDMS template has already been successfully transferred to the PEDOT:PSS layer, in which stripes with a width of around 500–600 nm and depth of around 30 nm are formed. When the TIVA method was applied to the PEDOT:PSS layer, the depth of the stripes is about 40 nm (Fig. 2d). After the complete OLED device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TAPC/mCP:10 wt% FIrpic/TmPyPB/LiF/Al has been fabricated on the sub-micron patterned PEDOT:PSS layer, periodic stripes with a depth of around 15 nm could still be maintained on the upper surface of the OLED device (Fig. 2e). When the TIVA method was used for the PEDOT:PSS layer, the upper surface of the complete device shows similar periodic stripes with a depth of around 20 nm (Fig. 2f). Compared to the TI-treated PEDOT:PSS layer, the deepened stripes observed for the TIVA method (Fig. 2d and f) indicate that the introduced NH3 vapor can further promote the formation of well-regulated patterns with a larger interfacial area. The sub-micron patterned structure formed in the PEDOT:PSS interfacial layer is expected to expand the charge-transport paths in the complete OLED devices.

Performance of OLED devices based on TIVA-treated PEDOT:PSS layer
The OLED devices with the same emitting layer (EML) were fabricated using the modified PEDOT:PSS layers and the corresponding energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 3a. In order to prepare the patterned PEDOT:PSS layer by means of the TI method, a relatively thick PEDOT:PSS layer (100 nm) was used as the HIL to construct the OLED device. It has been demonstrated that the thickness of a PEDOT:PSS layer exhibits a negligible effect on the final device performance (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI†). The NH3(aq) SVA processing time, which is closely related to the properties of PEDOT:PSS and the final device performance, has also been optimized during SVA treatment (Fig. S3, ESI†). The results reflect the remarkable enhancement in turn-on voltage (Von), current efficiency (CE) and power efficiency (PE) under different annealing times (Table S2, ESI†). Fig. 3b plots the current density/luminance versus voltage (J–V–L) characteristics of the device fabricated under the optimal solvent annealing time, showing that the Von value is enhanced slightly from 3.27 to 3.32 V when inserting the NH3(aq) SVA-treated PEDOT:PSS interfacial layers. As demonstrated previously, the decreased WF of NH3(aq) SVA-treated PEDOT:PSS could not well match with the HOMO level of the HTL (TAPC), thus leading to the enlargement of the hole injection barrier and the enhancement of Von value. Intriguingly, due to the large luminance and relatively low current density, the CE, PE and EQE of the optimal devices fabricated with NH3(aq) SVA-treated PEDOT:PSS layers are remarkably enhanced from 26.95 cd A−1, 22.05 lm W−1, and 13.84% to 30.93 cd A−1, 25.40 lm W−1, and 15.88%, respectively (Table 1). The lower current of the SVA-treated device should be due to the suppressed electron current. After the SVA treatment, PSS aggregates will be formed that hinder electrons from injecting into the PEDOT:PSS layer,34,35 resulting in a better hole and electron flux balance for improved device performance. To eliminate the influence of H2O from NH3(aq), the PhOLED devices fabricated with a H2O SVA-treated PEDOT:PSS layer were also prepared as a reference and the corresponding performance improvement is almost negligible (Fig. S4 and Table S3, ESI†). To further demonstrate the beneficial role of solvent vapors in the regulation of the HIL for better device performance, various solvent vapors including diethylenetriamine (DETA), ethanolamine (MEA) and isopropanol (IPA) have also been tested. The results indicate that the solvent vapors containing amino groups (NH3, DETA and MEA) generally lead to the higher device performance (Fig. S5 and Table S4, ESI†). We speculate that the amino group tends to react with the PSS polymer, facilitating the formation of continuous hole-transport channels in the PEDOT:PSS layer. Specifically, the NH3 SVA-treated PEDOT:PSS layer exhibits the best device performance.

When the TI-treated PEDOT:PSS layer with sub-micron sized periodic stripes was used for PhOLED devices, a substantial increase in device efficiencies with a CE, PE and EQE of 31.88 cd A−1, 23.22 lm W−1 and 16.37%, respectively, was found, as shown in Table 1. Meanwhile, the corresponding Von is also enhanced from 3.27 to 3.54 V after the formation of periodic stripes. We speculate that additional charge traps have formed in the upper surface during the construction of the sub-micron patterned HIL, thus leading to the remarkable raised Von. To demonstrate the effect of periodic stripes formed on the PEDOT:PSS layer, a plain PDMS template without patterns was used to regulate the PEDOT:PSS layer. The corresponding PhOLED device exhibits slightly lower efficiencies (Fig. S6, ESI†). Thus, the construction of periodic structures in the PEDOT:PSS layer should be of critical importance in enhancing the device performance. In particular, the PhOLED device fabricated with TIVA-treated PEDOT:PSS exhibits the highest efficiencies, reaching 36.62 cd A−1 for CE, 27.60 lm W−1 for PE and 18.80% for EQE (Fig. 3c). Since the PDMS template used for TI has been contacting with the PEDOT:PSS layer during solvent treatment, the flexible template plays a dual role in the microstructural regulation of the HIL. To illustrate the synergetic effect, the patterned PEDOT:PSS layer as a reference was also treated with NH3 vapor after the PDMS template had been completely peeled off. It was found that the stripe patterns disappeared when the TI-treated PEDOT:PSS layer was placed in the NH3 vapor atmosphere (Fig. S7, ESI†). Meanwhile, there was almost negligible performance improvement on the corresponding PhOLED device except for the significantly enhanced Von value (Fig. S8 and Table S5, ESI†). The dual effect of the PDMS template in both the construction of sub-micron sized patterns and the enhancement of NH3/PEDOT:PSS intermolecular interactions ensures the efficient regulation of PEDOT:PSS HILs and the performance improvement of the whole PhOLED device.
In fact, periodic grating as an efficient light out-coupling strategy has been widely used in HILs for the construction of periodic light out-coupling structures.36–39 The constructed light out-coupling structures allow a drastic boost in EQE in the OLEDs.40,41 Though a similar periodic nanostructure was constructed in our work, the maximum luminance (Lmax) of the corresponding devices exhibited negligible variations after TI treatment. Therefore, we speculate that the optimized hole-injection and hole-transport channels rather than light out-coupling structures play the dominant role in the enhancement of device performance.
To further reveal the effect of NH3(aq) vapor as well as the TI patterned structure on the performance of the OLED devices, hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TAPC/mCP/TAPC/MoO3/Al were fabricated to investigate the carrier injection and transport processes (Fig. S9, ESI†). It was found that the hole-only current significantly decreases for the NH3(aq) SVA treated PEDOT:PSS condition; nevertheless, the pristine PEDOT:PSS and H2O SVA treated PEDOT:PSS layers applied to the OLED device exhibited a similar hole-only current (Fig. S10, ESI†). This significant difference further confirms that NH3 vapor rather than H2O vapor plays a decisive role in the regulation of PEDOT:PSS microstructures. Even though NH3(aq) SVA treatment reduces the hole mobility of the PEDOT:PSS interfacial layer, a significant enhancement in CE, PE and EQE was clearly observed when the SVA-treated PEDOT:PSS was used as the HIL. The improved performance of the PhOLEDs by NH3(aq) SVA treatment should be attributed to the reduction of leakage current with the formation of insulating ammonium salt PSS-aggregates, which can prevent the electron injection into the PEDOT:PSS layer. Meanwhile, the periodic stripes in PEDOT:PSS could provide more charge-transport paths from HIL to HTL, and thus the hole mobility (μh) enhances from 2.92 × 10−7 to 1.20 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 after TI treatment. When the PDMS template was applied to the upper surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer, the effect of NH3 vapor on the PEDOT:PSS microstructures would be further enhanced due to the solvent adsorption ability of the PDMS matrix, thus facilitating the formation of deeper stripes. As a result, the applied TIVA method supplies a relatively boosted μh value (4.97 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1) benefiting from the increased contact interfaces.
Since only insulating polymer PSS units in the PEDOT:PSS complex exhibit solubility in aqueous solution, the conducting polymer PEDOT unit can be compared to a rigid core, which is encapsulated by the PSS unit (Fig. 4).22 The insulating PSS barriers will separate the conducting PEDOT-rich cores during the formation of PEDOT:PSS layers. When this composite film was exposed to an NH3(aq) vapor atmosphere, the PSS unit would react with NH3 to form the ammonium salt and a portion of PSS-rich shells would be destroyed followed by the formation of PSS aggregates, which prevents charges from injecting into the PEDOT:PSS layer to cause the reduced leakage currents. When the TI technique was combined with SVA treatment, the PEDOT:PSS interfacial layer with periodic stripes could supply additional hole-transport channels. Therefore, TIVA treatment can enhance the hole injection and transportation but suppress the electron transportation for a better hole and electron flux balance and significantly improved device performance of blue PhOLEDs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have proposed a novel interfacial layer modification method, namely TIVA, to regulate the chemical and physical properties of PEDOT:PSS. This technique, which rationally aligns NH3 vapor annealing with imprinting, can benefit from both SVA and TI treatments. The introduced NH3 vapor, which can react with the acidic PEDOT:PSS material, efficiently transforms a certain amount of PSS into ammonium salt and induces PSS aggregation to suppress the current leakage. Meanwhile, the TI treatment produces periodic stripes of sub-micron size in the PEDOT:PSS HIL, thereby providing more interfacial areas between HIL (PEDOT:PSS) and HTL (TAPC) for efficient hole transport. Both the increased interfacial contact area induced by TI and the PSS aggregates constructed by SVA contribute to the significant efficiency enhancement by TIVA treatment. Impressively, the TIVA treated PEDOT:PSS layer applied to blue PhOLEDs results in high efficiencies with EQEs up to 18.8% in the intensively investigated PhOLEDs based on the mCP host and FIrpic guest, showing a more than 35% enhancement in EQEs compared to the untreated devices. These results clearly demonstrate that the newly proposed TIVA technique could offer a platform for the rational regulation of HILs to establish efficient and rich charge-transport channels for significantly enhanced OLED performance.

The aqueous ammonia [NH3(aq), 28% in H2O] solution was purchased from Aladdin. All chemicals were used as obtained.
Fabrication of PDMS template
The PDMS template was prepared by mixing PDMS oligomer and curing agent (10:1, v/v). Then, the mixture was poured onto a standard digital versatile disc (DVD), from which the protective polymer film had been removed to expose the patterned metallic layer. After degassing, the mixture became clear and then it was thermal-cured at 60 °C for 4 h. Finally, the PDMS template was cooled to room temperature before being peeled off from the DVD.36 The thickness of the PDMS template was about 3 mm.
Preparation of TIVA-treated PEDOT:PSS layer
PEDOT:PSS with the thickness of 100 nm was prepared by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS solution at a relatively low speed (1800 rpm). The PEDOT:PSS spin-coated layer covered with a PDMS template and a precleaned glass cover slide was thermal-annealed at 100 °C for 15 min, during which a swallow tail clip was employed to clamp these layers. Then, the sandwich structure containing the PEDOT:PSS layer was placed in an NH3(aq) vapor atmosphere for a few seconds. After solvent vapor annealing (SVA), the sandwich structure was thermal-annealed again to remove the residual solvent. Finally, the upper glass cover slide and PDMS template were peeled off and the TIVA-treated PEDOT:PSS layer was obtained.
Device fabrication
OLED device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS (100 nm)/TAPC (20 nm)/mCP:10 wt% FIrpic (20 nm)/TmPyPB (30 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm). The pre-patterned ITO substrates were cleaned via sonication in deionized water, acetone, and ethanol followed by UV ozone treatment. A thick (∼100 nm) PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated on the clean ITO substrates followed by different post-treatments. All of the other functional layers were thermally evaporated under high vacuum conditions (<5 × 10−4 Pa). TAPC (20 nm) was used as hole transporting material. mCP doped with 10 wt% FIrpic (20 nm) was used as the emitting layer (EML). TmPyPB (30 nm) was used as the hole blocking/electron transporting layer. The cathode was composed of LiF (0.8 nm) and Al (100 nm).
Measurements and characterization
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, ESCALAB 250 system) with a He I (21.22 eV) gas discharge lamp was used to ascertain the work function. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments for elementary analysis were also carried out with an ESCALAB 250 system. The measurement chamber was equipped with a monochromatic Al Kγ X-ray source (hγ = 1486.6 eV). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples in KBr pellets were recorded using a Bruker Model VECTOR22 Fourier transform spectrometer. The pH value of the PEDOT:PSS solution was characterized by a pH meter (Sartorius, PB-10). Optical characterization was conducted using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 35 PerkinElmer). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atom force microscopy (AFM) were performed to characterize the film morphology. SEM images were obtained using an S-4800 system (Hitachi High-Technology). A Bruker Dimension Icon AFM equipped with Scanasyst-Air peak force tapping mode was carried out to study the surface topography. The thickness of various organic layers was measured by using a DEKTAK XT stylus profiler (Bruker, Germany). The J–L–V characteristics of the devices were measured by a Keithley 2602B source measuring unit and an ST-86LA luminance meter. Electroluminescence (EL) spectra were characterized by a SpectraScan PR655 spectrophotometer.
