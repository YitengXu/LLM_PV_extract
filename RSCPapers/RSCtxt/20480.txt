1 Introduction
The large-scale extraction and consumption of fossil fuels, especially since the Industrial Revolution, has led to a continued rise in atmospheric CO2 levels. This appears to be tipping the balance of Earth's energy, and concerns have been raised in recent years by drastic changes in Earth's climate.1 It is necessary to develop advanced technologies to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Therefore, CO2 must be captured and stored, or converted into environmentally friendly products. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology can capture CO2 in carbon-intensive industries or the atmosphere and deposit it in depleted oil/gas reservoirs, deep aquifers, coal seams, and the deep ocean.2 However, the safe storage of CO2 has special requirements of ambient pressure and temperature.3 It also faces the risk of damaging geological structures and endangering marine fish.4 Inspired by plant photosynthesis in nature, artificial photosynthesis (photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis) can convert CO2 into gaseous products (CO,5–13 CH414–21 and so on) and liquid products (CH3OH,22–24 HCOOH,25–27 CH3COOH,28,29 CH3CH2OH30–32 and so on). In the photocatalytic CO2 reduction system, the photoactive semiconductor absorbs incident light with energy higher than its band gap to generate electron–hole pairs, and then the carriers are separated and migrate to the active site on the surface of the material to participate in the redox reaction, which can convert CO2 into a range of hydrocarbon fuels. In particular, the photoelectrocatalytic system applies a bias voltage on the basis of photocatalysis, which can promote the transfer of charges. However, CO2 molecules exhibit strong thermodynamic and kinetic stability. Although solar energy can be used as the energy input to drive the CO2 RR, limited by catalysts and reaction systems, the energy conversion efficiency, product selectivity and stability of photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR systems are still unsatisfactory.
To further improve the performance of photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR, researchers have made great efforts in recent years. In the development of advanced catalysts, the materials are mainly modified around a supporting non-precious metal,33–35 combined with molecular catalysts,36–38 a heterojunction is constructed,39–41 localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is introduced,42–45 or element doping is done.46–51 At the same time, several excellent review articles have analyzed in detail around the above aspects.52–56 Besides, developing new preparation strategies to control the shape and size of catalysts is of great significance for optimizing the surface properties, charge transport capability, and catalytic performance.57 0D nanoparticles have a large specific surface area, which can be uniformly dispersed on the substrate by controlling the preparation parameters. However, due to the high surface energy of nanoparticles, agglomeration easily occurs after long-term operation, resulting in catalyst deactivation.58 2D and 3D materials also show a larger specific surface area and expose more active sites, which are conducive to the multi-proton CO2 RR, but their preparation process is cumbersome and the synthesis environment is harsh. 1D materials have a high aspect ratio, which not only exposes a large surface area, but also constrains the carrier transport path to facilitate the separation and transfer of electron–hole pairs.59–61 Importantly, common semiconductor materials can be designed into 1D nanostructures by relatively simple fabrication methods. For example, TiO2 has been widely studied as a mature photocatalyst, but its wide band gap and high carrier recombination rate limit its application. In addition, TiO2 nanoparticles are prone to agglomeration under illumination, resulting in a rapid decrease in their catalytic activity during the CO2 RR. Intercalating TiO2 into 1D structures such as nanorods, nanotubes, nanofibers, and nanowires can increase its specific surface area and broaden the photo-response range to the visible light region.62,63 Besides, 1D nanostructures can also act as a channel for carrier transport to facilitate the separation of electron–hole pairs. Currently, there is no material that simultaneously possesses superior light absorption capability, carrier separation capability, CO2 reduction capability, product selectivity, and stability. Catalysts with various superior properties can be prepared by the hybridization of various semiconductor materials. For example, loading 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D semiconductors on 1D TiO2 to construct heterojunctions can further optimize the band gap and carrier separation rate of the composites. The large specific surface area of the 1D structure is conducive to the full contact of the semiconductor interface. Therefore, in recent years, a series of 0D/1D, 1D/1D, 2D/1D, and 3D/1D composites have been developed for photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR.64 In summary, 1D nanostructured catalysts have the following advantages. (1) 1D nanostructured catalysts with regular arrays allow multiple reflections of incident light, which offers a significant advantage in light harvesting. (2) In addition, the elongated structure can effectively promote the separation and transport of carriers. (3) The surface area of 1D nanostructured catalysts tends to be several times larger than that of planar structures, which means that 1D nanostructured catalysts have a larger area for absorbing incident light and supporting co-catalysts. (4) Most semiconductor materials can be designed into 1D nanostructures, and their preparation methods are diverse and simple.
However, the research progress in improving the photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR performance by constructing 1D nanostructured catalysts has not been systematically summarized. This review analyzed the basic principles of photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic CO2 RR. At the same time, the preparation methods and the main advantages of 1D nanostructured catalysts are introduced. In particular, we mainly focus on the research progress in 1D nanostructured catalysts applied in photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR. At the end of this review, the current technical difficulties and development prospects of 1D nanostructured catalysts are summarized. We strongly believe that this review can provide guidance for the rational design of photocatalysts and photoelectrodes to further improve the conversion efficiency of CO2.
2 Basic principles of photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR
2.1 Theory of photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR
Artificial photosynthesis has been extensively studied in the field of catalysis since Fujishima and Honda successfully split H2O into H2 and O2 using TiO2 under UV light in 1972.65 In subsequent studies, Inoue et al. used light to irradiate TiO2, ZnO, CdS, GaP, and SiC to reduce CO2 to HCOOH, HCHO, and CH3OH.66 This research provided an environmentally friendly and convenient way to convert CO2 into value-added chemicals. Band structure is a fundamental property of semiconductor materials, as shown in Fig. 1(a); the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) are separated by a stable band gap. When the semiconductor material absorbs incident light with energy higher than the bandgap energy, electrons in the VB will transition to the CB and leave holes at the corresponding position of the VB, thereby generating electron–hole pairs. The electrons and holes are then separated and transported to the semiconductor surface, where redox reactions take place at the active sites, respectively. H2O will be oxidized to O2 by photogenerated holes, and CO2 will be reduced to a series of products such as CO and CH4 by photogenerated electrons. Since the reaction environment of the photocatalytic CO2 RR system is relatively mild and the energy input is derived from solar energy, a large number of researchers have devoted great efforts to the establishment of high-performance photocatalytic systems. Some photocatalysts with good performance have been developed, such as g-C3N4, Cu2O, CeO2, BiVO4 and WO3, etc.

Photoelectrocatalysis is a special combination of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Unlike conventional conductive electrodes, semiconductor electrodes are applied in photoelectrocatalytic process. The system of PEC CO2 RR generally consists of a cathode, anode and reference electrode. According to the different types of electrodes, it can be divided into three modes as shown in Fig. 1(b–d). A traditional H-type reactor with a photoanode and photocathode as an example is shown in Fig. 1(b). Similar to the photocatalytic process, the photoanode absorbs photons with energy above the semiconductor bandgap; then electrons transition from the VB to the CB to create electron–hole pairs. The holes are transferred to the surface of the photoanode to participate in the oxidation reaction, which splits H2O into oxygen and protons. The protons are transferred to the photocathode through the proton exchange membrane to participate in the reduction reaction. At the same time, electrons are continuously transported to the photocathode under external bias to promote CO2 RR. A similar process also occurs at the photocathode.53 Finally, CO2 can be reduced to a variety of products such as CO, CH4, HCOOH, CH3OH, CH3COOH, and CH3CH2OH. In photocatalytic (PC) systems, the CO2 RR efficiency and product selectivity are poor due to the rapid recombination of electron–hole pairs. In the electrocatalytic (EC) system, the additional external bias provides a constant flow of electrons to the working electrode, and CO2 can be effectively reduced to the target product by adjusting the voltage of the external circuit. Unfortunately, the overpotential is high due to the direct contact between the working electrode and electrolyte solution. The PEC system combines the advantages of PC and EC as follows. (1) Compared with photocatalysis, the additional external bias can effectively promote the separation and transport of electron–hole pairs, thereby significantly improving the energy conversion efficiency. (2) Compared with electrocatalysis, the photoelectrode can generate a certain photovoltage under illumination to compensate for the potential required for CO2 RR. In other words, the PEC system can reduce the power consumption to a certain extent. (3) Redox reactions take place at the anode and cathode, respectively, which can effectively improve the CO2 RR efficiency.67,68 Therefore, it could reduce CO2 to a series of economical products with relatively high efficiency.
2.2 Mechanism of photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR
It is well known that CO2 is composed of two CO bonds with higher bond energies than C–C (336 kJ mol−1), C–H (430 kJ mol−1) and C–O (327 kJ mol−1).69,70 Therefore, the activation and reduction of CO2 are very difficult. The thermodynamic potentials of different CO2 reduction products and water splitting reactions vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) are shown in Table 1, when the pH of the aqueous solution is 7, the temperature is 25 °C, and the pressure is 1 atm.71–73 It can be clearly seen that the single-electron activation of CO2 to CO2˙− requires more negative potential.74 When protons are involved, the reaction energy of CO2 reduction will be correspondingly decreased. Therefore, the proton-assisted multielectron reduction process taking place on the surface of catalyst is considered to be appreciable.71 It is generally believed that CO2 combines with protons to form *HCOO or *COOH first. The *CO intermediate is then generated, and the target product can be obtained through subsequent reaction steps at the corresponding potential.72

Different adsorption modes and intermediates determine the diversity and complexity of reaction pathways. Reduction products such as CH4, CH3OH and C2+ involve multiple electron transfer and C–C bond coupling, and their reaction paths are often very complicated.75 Taking the 8-electron reaction to generate CH4 as an example, the reaction pathways can be summarized as the formaldehyde pathway (CO2 → HCOOH → H2CO → CH3OH → CH4) and the carbene pathway (CO2 → CO → CH3 → CH3OH/CH4), as shown in Fig. 2.76 H2CO and CH3OH are two important intermediates in the formaldehyde pathway. When the binding energies of H2CO and CH3OH on the catalyst surface are weak, they will desorb as side products. Therefore, designing a catalyst with good adsorption capacity for the main intermediates is one of the effective ways to improve the product selectivity, which we will analyze in Section 2.3. Using *CO as the initial reactant, three possible pathways for the formation of C2+ products are shown in Fig. 3.69,77 The favorable *CO adsorption energy is considered to be the key factor for the formation of C2+ products. When the adsorption energy of the catalyst for *CO is weak, *CO will easily desorb and form a gaseous CO side product. When the adsorption energy is strong, the poisoning process of *CO will hinder the reduction reaction. In the first reaction pathway, CH3COO− is formed by the coupling of *CH2 and *CO, and C2H6 is formed by dimerization of *CH3. In this process, *COH as the precursor of *CH2 and *CH3 is very important for the selective generation of C2+. In the second reaction pathway, *CHO is an important precursor to generate C2H2O2 and C2H6O2. At the same time, *CHO is also an important intermediate to selectively generate CH4. Due to the relatively high selectivity of CH4, the yields of C2H2O2 and C2H6O2 tend to be very low. The third reaction pathway is the main form for the formation of C2+, and the C–C coupling of the two *CO intermediates is a key step in the formation of C2H4, C2H5OH, and n-CH3CH2CH2OH. Although a lot of work has been carried out in the field of CO2 RR mechanisms and pathways, a complete and precise set has not yet been summarized.

2.3 Strategies for optimizing the performance of photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR
In the photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR system, the energy conversion efficiency, catalyst stability and product selectivity are the main indicators for evaluating its performance, which are affected by the light harvesting ability, carrier separation, transfer efficiency, and interfacial reactions. In general, a catalyst with excellent performance should meet the following characteristics. (1) The semiconductor should have a suitable energy band structure. An excessively large bandgap is not conducive to the generation of photoelectrons in a large wavelength range, while an excessively narrow bandgap cannot satisfy the potential required for the redox reactions. Generally, it should be satisfied in thermodynamics that the CB of the semiconductor is more negative than the reduction potential of CO2, and the VB is more positive than the oxidation potential of H2O. The band structures of the common semiconductors, CO2 reduction potentials, and H2O oxidation potentials are shown in Fig. 4.67 (2) The catalyst should have good electrical conductivity for carrier separation and electron transport. (3) The catalyst should have abundant surface topography to enhance the light-harvesting ability and provide a large number of active sites. (4) During the working process, the catalyst should maintain high stability to achieve long-term work.67

The band structure of the semiconductor determines its photo-response range. Semiconductor materials with wide band gaps, such as TiO2 (∼3.2 eV), can only generate photogenerated electrons under the irradiation of UV light.78 The band gap of the catalyst can be optimized by element doping and semiconductor hybridization, thereby enhancing its photo-response in the visible and near-infrared ranges.46,73,79,80 By loading plasmonic metals, such as Au, Ag and Cu, LSPR can be triggered, which can make the absorption spectrum red shift.44,81,82 Besides, rationally designing the surface topography of the catalyst to expose more light-absorbing area and optimize the light propagation path inside the material can also significantly improve its light-absorbing ability, such as the design of 1D nanostructured catalysts.
In the practical application of photo(electro)catalysis, the high recombination rate of electron–hole pairs in the interior and surface of the catalyst becomes the main factor restricting its energy conversion efficiency. The establishment of internal potential by ion doping can promote the separation of carriers, and the transport of carriers can be promoted by loading materials with good electrical conductivity such as rGO and CNTs.32,83–86 Apart from this, coupling two or more semiconductors with staggered band structures to construct heterojunctions is considered to be a mature strategy to promote carrier separation, and semiconductor hybridization can also improve its light-absorbing ability to a certain extent.30,87–89 According to different charge transfer mechanisms, heterojunctions can be divided into type I, type II, Z-scheme and Schottky junction systems, as shown in Fig. 5.90 In type I, the energy band of semiconductor B is located inside semiconductor A, and the electrons and holes of semiconductor A are transferred to the CB and VB of semiconductor B, respectively. Type II and Z-scheme systems have similar structures, with the band staggered arrangement of semiconductor A and semiconductor B. In type II, the electrons of semiconductor A are transferred to the CB of semiconductor B, and the holes of semiconductor B are transferred to the VB of semiconductor A. In the Z-scheme system, the holes located on the VB of the semiconductor A combine with the electrons located on the CB of the semiconductor B, thereby retaining the electrons with strong reducibility on the CB of the semiconductor A. The Z-scheme system can take into account both the carrier separation efficiency and the reduction performance of the catalyst, so it has been widely used in photo(electro)catalytic water splitting for hydrogen production,91,92 dye degradation93–95 and CO2 reduction.43,96–99 Another special junction, the Schottky junction, is formed by the coupling of metal co-catalysts and semiconductors. Driven by the potential difference between the Fermi levels of the two materials, photogenerated electrons can be transferred from the semiconductor surface to the co-catalyst. Schottky junctions can act as electron traps to gather photoelectrons, thereby facilitating the separation of charge carriers and kinetically facilitating the reduction of CO2.81,90

Optimizing the redox reaction on the catalyst surface is an effective solution to improve the CO2 conversion efficiency and product selectivity. According to the mechanism of CO2 RR, increasing the concentration of CO2 on the catalyst surface can promote the reduction reaction kinetically. The adsorption of CO2 can be promoted by supporting MOFs or functional co-catalysts on the semiconductor surface.34,100–105 Besides, increasing the electrolyte pressure can improve the solubility of CO2 in aqueous solution, thereby increasing the CO2 concentration on the catalyst surface.106,107 Obviously, conventional photoreactors do not allow pressure regulation. In the field of PEC CO2 RR, continuous flow reactors based on gas diffusion electrodes have been successively developed.108,109 On the one hand, a more compact structure can realize flexible regulation of pressure. On the other hand, the gas diffusion electrode has a porous structure, which is conducive to the sufficient contact between the catalyst and the electrolyte. Similarly, moderately increasing the adsorption capacity of the catalyst for major intermediates can significantly improve the product selectivity. The intermediates can be effectively stabilized by exposing the crystal facets with the main intermediate adsorption activity or supporting functional co-catalysts. For example, the Cu2O(111) facets preferentially adsorb H3CO−, so the major product at the Cu2O(111) facet is CH3OH, while the major product at the Cu2O(100) facet is CH3CH2OH.110,111 In addition, electrolyte pH also has a certain influence on the formation and stability of intermediates. For example, the selectivity of CO2 reduction products on Cu/Cu2O photoelectrodes is largely affected by pH. Under weak alkaline conditions, the concentration of hydrogen radicals is dominant, which is beneficial for the formation of CH3OH. In contrast, the predominance of hydroxyl radicals under strong alkaline conditions is beneficial for the formation of C2H4O and CH3COCH3.112,113
The stability of the catalyst determines whether it is suitable for long-term work and is also one of the important indicators to judge the performance of the photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR system. In practical applications, most catalysts exhibit unsatisfactory stability. For example, since the redox potential of Cu2O is within its band gap, it will be simultaneously reduced by photogenerated electrons and oxidized by holes under illumination.114 Therefore, Cu2O-based catalysts generally exhibit poor stability in the reported studies. Photo-corrosion can be effectively improved by constructing heterojunctions, supporting MOFs, and designing a nanostructure to facilitate the separation and transport of charge carriers.114,115 In addition, creating a stable microenvironment by coating the surface with a “protective film” is also the main strategy to inhibit photocorrosion.33,34,100,116,117
3 Preparation of 1D nanostructured catalysts
Recently, a series of 1D nanostructured catalysts have been developed and applied in P(E)C CO2 RR, such as nanowires (Si NWs,118 GaN NWs,119–121 Cu2O NWs,122 α-Fe2O3 NWs,123 Co3O4 NWs124 and so on), nanorods (CuO/Cu2O NRs,109 α-Fe2O3 NRs,125 ZnO NRs,126 WO3 NRs127 and so on), and nanotubes (TiO2 NTs,128 Fe2O3 NTs,129 Co3O4 NTs,130 Ta3N5 NTs131 and so on). In terms of material type, there are many categories of 1D nanostructured catalysts, and the preparation method of each material is unique. Therefore, this section introduces the preparation methods of several common 1D nanostructured catalysts in detail.
3.1 Preparation of nanowire catalysts
Si NWs can be obtained by laser ablation (LA),132–135 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),136,137 metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE),138,139 and so on. However, LA and CVD are often limited by factors such as expensive preparation equipment and poor product morphology.140 In recent years, MACE has been adopted by a large number of researchers. During this process, redox reactions occurred simultaneously on the surface of the Si plate. First, Ag+ ions were reduced to Ag nanoparticles by capturing the electrons of Si, and then deposited on the surface of the Si plate. Next, SiF62− ions that can be dissolved in HF solution were formed (Fig. 6(a)).118 The dissolution of Si oxide meant that the reaction between Ag+ and Si could be carried out continuously, thus forming the nanowire structure (Fig. 6(b)).118 Si NWs with corresponding lengths could be obtained by controlling the time of chemical etching. In addition, some novel fabrication methods have also been used to prepare Si NWs in recent years. For example, Li et al. used the deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) method to prepare Si NWs with larger diameters.141 On this basis, in order to improve their photovoltage output, a heavily arsenic-doped n+ layer was applied on Si NWs. For suppressing the corrosion phenomenon of Si NWs, a layer of TiO2 film was covered on its surface. The preparation methods of Si NWs are summarized in Table 2.

GaN NWs are typically grown vertically on Si substrates using a plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE) method under nitrogen-rich conditions. First, HF solution was used to dissolve the oxides and organics on the surface of the Si plate, and then the GaN NWs were grown on the Si plate in the MBE chamber. By changing the growth environment, the size of the GaN nanowires could be precisely controlled.120,121,144–146 The fabrication of GaN NWs by PA-MBE under different conditions is listed in Table 3.

In the process of preparing Cu2O NWs, Cu(OH)2 NWs were often generated first. Then, the Cu(OH)2 NWs were annealed to obtain Cu2O NWs. For example, Minggu et al. prepared the Cu(OH)2 NW precursor by the wet chemical oxidation method.147 The pretreated copper foil was immersed in the growth solution to obtain Cu(OH)2 NWs, and the Cu(OH)2 NWs were further annealed to obtain Cu2O NWs. In another study, Lee et al. obtained Cu(OH)2 NW precursors by electrodeposition.122 Similarly, Cu(OH)2 NWs were converted to Cu2O NWs after annealing. In order to enhance the CO2 adsorption and activation ability of the catalyst, they used the dipping method to wrap a TiO2 film on Cu2O NWs and loaded Cu+ species on their surfaces. Besides, Cu NWs148 and α-Fe2O3 NWs123 could also be prepared by electrodeposition directly.
3.2 Preparation of nanorod catalysts
The difference between nanorods and nanowires is mainly reflected in the aspect ratio. A consistent structure implies a similar preparation method. Homayoni et al. successively used three methods of sol–gel synthesis, thermal annealing and electrodeposition to fabricate a CuO/Cu2O hybrid nanorod photocathode.109 Firstly, Cu(OH)2 was generated by sol–gel synthesis. Then, the precursor Cu(OH)2 was converted into CuO nanoribbons by thermal annealing. Finally, Cu2O nanocrystals were electrodeposited on the above CuO nanoribbons in a CuSO4–C3H6O3 bath. When the electrolysis time was longer than 15 min, CuO nanoribbons were transformed into the nanorod structure. In another study, β-FeOOH precursors were synthesized by the hydrothermal method, followed by thermal annealing to prepare Fe2O3 films with a nanorod structure.125
3.3 Preparation of nanotube catalysts
Among the nanotube catalysts for P(E)C CO2 RR, TiO2 NTs (TNTs) have the advantages of having various preparation methods and being inexpensive. TNTs can be prepared by anodic oxidation, a sol–gel method, a hydrothermal method and so on. In various preparation methods, the operation process of anodic oxidation is relatively simple; so it has been widely used since the first report by Zwilling et al.149 The main operating steps for the fabrication of TNTs by one-step anodic oxidation are as follows (Fig. 7(a)). First, the titanium sheet was polished with different types of sandpaper to remove oxides from the surface. Degreasing treatment was then performed, and the titanium sheets were sequentially cleaned several times in an ultrasonic bath with acetone solution and ionized water. Before the anodization, titanium sheets were etched with a hydrochloric acid solution. Then, a titanium sheet was used as the anode for electrolysis to grow TNTs. After the electrolysis, the electrode was washed several times with deionized water and dried. Finally, thermal annealing was performed to obtain TNTs with a regular structure.150–153 On this basis, the two-step anodic oxidation method (Fig. 7(b)) has been applied to prepare TNTs with special structures in recent years. After the first electrolysis, the electrodes were sonicated to remove the nanotube arrays, leaving a layer of ordered hexagonal imprints on the surface of the titanium sheet. The titanium sheet was then electrolyzed again as an anode to grow nanotube arrays under the layer of ordered hexagonal imprints. Finally, thermal annealing was performed to obtain TNTs with a composite structure. The propagation of incident light and the loading of co-catalysts could be optimized due to a layer of regular hexagonal grids on top of the nanotubes.154–156 Similar to the preparation of TNTs, Fe2O3 NTs,129 Co3O4 NTs130 and Ta3N5 NTs131,157 can also be prepared by the anodic oxidation method. The preparation methods of nanotube catalysts are listed in Table 4.

4 Characteristics of 1D nanostructured catalysts
The geometry of semiconductor materials has multiple effects on their catalytic performance. In recent years, a series of catalysts with 0D (nanoparticles), 1D (nanowires/rods/tubes), 2D (nanosheets/plates) and 3D structures have been prepared.158 0D nanoparticles have the characteristics of a small size and large specific surface area, but agglomeration often occurs after long-term work, which seriously affects the stability of the catalyst. The large specific surface area of 2D structured materials can expose a large number of active sites, the short electron migration path can minimize the carrier recombination rate, and the abundant surface defects can improve the electrical conductivity. Therefore, catalysts with 2D structures such as layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and MXenes have been widely used for photo(electro)catalytic CO2 RR.51,70,159–164 3D catalysts with spatial mesoporous structures, such as copper foam, nickel foam and MOFs, have large surface areas, regular and ordered pore structures, and certain adsorption capacities for CO2 and intermediates, which are of great significance for studying the mechanism of CO2 reduction.100,165,166 1D nanostructures also exhibit the advantages of a large specific surface area, high carrier separation rate and transport efficiency. Importantly, compared with 0D, 2D, and 3D structures, 1D nanostructures have high aspect ratios and more reasonable carrier transport paths, facilitating the transfer of photogenerated electrons along the axial direction. In addition, the preparation methods of 1D nanostructured catalysts are simpler and more diverse, and the material structure is regular with fewer defects. They can also be used as a general platform to support 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D structured catalysts to construct heterojunctions to optimize the CO2 reduction performance.63
The morphological characteristics of natural organisms can be referenced to improve the P(E)C performance of the catalyst. Soudi et al. analyzed the form and main mechanism of photon collection by plants and proposed that surface reflection and microscale light trapping could enhance the photon capture ability (Fig. 8).167 P(E)C is a heterogeneous catalytic process; the large surface area of the catalysts not only provides active sites, but also increases light absorption.168 1D nanostructured catalysts, including nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes and so on (Fig. 9), have attracted the attention of many researchers due to their significant advantages in light absorption, co-catalyst loading, and carrier transport.169

4.1 Light absorption
Thermodynamically, the light responsiveness of semiconductors depends on the band structure. When the energy of incident light is not lower than the band gap, photogenerated electron–hole pairs can be generated accordingly. However, the high reflectivity of planar semiconductor surfaces limits the efficient utilization of incident light. 1D nanostructured catalysts possess regular arrays, which can properly avoid this problem.170,171
The presence of the 1D array enhances light trapping, thereby reducing the surface reflectivity of incident light. Taking nanowires as an example, incident light reaching the surface of the semiconductor is not directly reflected into the air above (Fig. 10(a)).172 The light can be reflected multiple times within the regular 1D array, thereby increasing the effective transmission path and contact. As Allad et al. concluded, the reflectivity of Si NWs was 5–10% lower than that of Si plates in specific spectral regions.118 In addition, the 1D array grown in the vertical direction increases the surface area of the semiconductor, which also increases the actual light absorption area. In a study by Dong et al., a 1D nanostructured photocathode was constructed by vertically growing GaN nanowires on a Si substrate, which has a surface area 16.8 times larger than that of planar Si.146 Therefore, the 1D nanostructured catalyst can improve its light absorption ability from the light propagation path and exposed area.

Only 1D nanostructures with a reasonable size and regular arrangement can fully exert their unique structural advantages. Cu2O NWs and Cu2O MY are two easily prepared 1D copper oxides. Compared with Cu2O MY, the uniform 1D structure can increase light scattering and refraction, making Cu2O NWs exhibit good light absorption from the ultraviolet to visible light regions.147 It shows that nanowire arrays with suitable gaps and regular arrangement play a positive role in the light absorption capacity of the catalyst. The densely arranged and disorderly 1D structure tends to hinder the propagation of light, which weakens the light-responsiveness of the material. Therefore, the rational design of 1D nanostructures is very important.
4.2 Co-catalyst loading
A large specific surface area can also satisfy the loading of more co-catalysts. It is well known that the loading amount and distribution of co-catalysts play a key role in the performance of catalysts. More co-catalyst loading means more active sites, while dense loading will reduce the light absorption area of semiconductors. 1D nanostructured catalysts can simultaneously exhibit better co-catalyst loading capacity and light absorption capacity. Equal amounts of metal nanoparticles are loaded planar and 1D nanostructured semiconductors (Fig. 11(a)).173 It is confirmed that more nanoparticles can be loaded on the 1D nanostructure, and the additional loading does not increase the shading area compared with planar semiconductors. On the other hand, due to the guidance of the 1D structure, the nanoparticles can obtain a better distribution. Kong et al. investigated the effect of the Si NW aspect ratio on nanoparticle loading and distribution.141 They found that the nanowires with a larger aspect ratio were more conducive to the uniform loading of nanoparticles (Fig. 11(b)).

4.3 Carrier transport
The performance of PC CO2 RR systems is constrained by the massive recombination of charge carriers. In the PEC CO2 RR system, the external potential can promote the separation and transport of photogenerated electron–hole pairs; there is still a large recombination rate during the carrier migration. 1D nanostructures have smaller diameters, which can shorten the migration distance in the horizontal direction (Fig. 10(a)).172 In addition, the 1D structure can act as a channel for electron transport in the vertical direction.
Combining two semiconductors with matching band structures to construct 1D nanostructured catalysts can improve the extraction rate of electrons. Taking Si/GaN NWs as an example, the CB edges of GaN and Si were closely connected (Fig. 10(b)).120 The photoelectrons generated by the Si substrate can be smoothly transferred to the CB of GaN. Then, a sufficient amount of photogenerated electrons can be continuously transported to the surface of GaN NWs and participate in the CO2 RR.120 Therefore, 1D nanostructures also show special advantages in terms of carrier separation and transport.
5 Application of 1D nanostructured catalysts in photocatalytic CO2 RR
5.1 Application of nanowire catalysts in photocatalytic CO2 RR

5.1.1 Cu-based nanowires. 
Copper-based photocatalysts have good photo-response ability and CO2 affinity, which enables them to selectively reduce CO2 to CH4, CH3OH and CH3CH2OH. Since their redox potentials are within their own band gaps, copper-based photocatalysts will be simultaneously oxidized by photogenerated electrons and reduced by photogenerated holes under illumination; so they often show poor stability in practical applications. The photo-corrosion phenomenon of copper-based photocatalysts can be improved by promoting the rapid transfer of carriers. Zeng et al. assembled MXene quantum dots onto Cu2O NWs to construct 0D/1D heterostructured Ti3C2 QD/Cu2O NW/Cu photocatalysts.174 Ti3C2 QDs could significantly improve the stability of Cu2O NWs by enhancing the charge transfer rate. The synergistic effect of 0D T3C2 QDs and 1D Cu2O NWs promoted the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH with a yield 8.25 times higher than that of Cu2O NWs/Cu. Wu et al. used Cu3(BTC)2 (BTC = 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylate) to wrap Cu2O NWs, and the introduction of MOFs further increased the surface area of the catalyst and enhanced the CO2 concentration at the reaction interface.175 Importantly, MOFs could facilitate the rapid transfer of charge carriers from the Cu2O NWs, thereby avoiding their own oxidation. Therefore, the performance and stability of the Cu2O@Cu3(BTC)2 composites for reducing CO2 to CH4 under illumination were significantly enhanced.
Hybridization of narrow-bandgap p-CuO (1.53 eV) with a band-matched n-type semiconductor can optimize its photocatalytic performance. For example, Wang et al. loaded ZnO islands on CuO NWs, and the construction of p–n junctions could facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from CuO to ZnO.176 Kim et al. used Cu2O/S–TiO2 to cover CuO NWs to construct a p–n–p heterojunction for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4.177 In addition, assembling 2D nanosheets on 1D CuO NWs to construct 2D/1D heterojunctions can not only promote the separation of carriers, but also effectively increase the specific surface area of the material. Duan et al. loaded CdxCu1−xS nanosheets on CuO NWs to prepare a columnar cactus-like 2D/1D CdxCu1−xS@CuO shell–core structure photocatalyst.178 Due to the improved specific surface area, light harvesting and carrier separation ability, the performance of CdxCu1−xS@CuO to reduce CO2 to CH3OH under sunlight was 2.18 times higher than that of CuO NWs.


5.1.2 Tungsten oxide nanowires. 
Tungsten oxide has been proven to be an alternative semiconductor material for photocatalytic CO2 RR. In particular, ultrathin W18O49 NWs with abundant oxygen vacancies exhibit excellent ability for photocatalytic CO2 RR. Elemental doping can lead to the formation of intermediate energy bands and oxygen vacancies, and doping ions on the catalyst surface can promote carrier transport and CO2 adsorption.179 Zhang et al. prepared Cu+-doped W18O49 NWs by a solvothermal method.180 The doping of Cu+ promoted the separation of carriers and the introduction of oxygen holes was beneficial for the activation of CO2. Besides, the surface of Cu+–W18O49 exhibited hydrophobicity, which was beneficial for the adsorption of CO2. Jiang et al. assembled W18O49 NWs on Au/TiO2.181 The Au NPs could not only induce LSPR to generate high-energy hot electrons, but also adsorb CO2, protons and intermediates to promote the conversion of CO2 to CH4 with a product yield of 35.55 μmol g−1 h−1; the product selectivity was 93.3%.
Crystal facet engineering is also an effective method to improve the catalytic performance of semiconductor materials. For example, the affinity of catalysts for target intermediates can be enhanced by preferentially exposing the specific crystal facet. Zhang et al. loaded CuO nanoparticles onto 1D WO3 nanowires (110) and 2D WO3 nanosheets (001), respectively.182 Since the VB of 1D WO3 NWs was more negative, they had a stronger reduction ability. In addition, the construction of p–n junctions between CuO NPs and WO3 NWs facilitated the separation of carriers and improved the efficiency of CO2 to CH4 conversion.

5.2 Application of nanorod catalysts in photocatalytic CO2 RR

5.2.1 TiO2 nanorods. 
The photocatalytic CO2 RR directly on the surface of TiO2 exhibits an unsatisfactory performance, which is limited by the photo-response range and carrier recombination. Incorporating TiO2 into nanorods can improve its surface optical properties and carrier separation efficiency. On this basis, combining TiO2 NRs with other visible light-active semiconductors or photosensitizers can further improve their photocatalytic properties. For example, the light-absorbing ability of the catalyst could be significantly improved by loading the polymeric cobalt phthalocyanines (CoPPcs) on TiO2 NRs as a photosensitizer.183 In addition, the heterojunction formed by p-type TiO2 and n-type CoPPcs could promote the separation of carriers. Similarly, Yang et al. anchored Cu2O NPs on TiO2 NRs.184 Due to the accelerated separation of electron–hole pairs by the p–n junction, as shown in Fig. 12(a), the TiO2/Cu2O-15% composite NRs could reduce CO2 to CH4 with 3.07- and 15-fold higher yields than TiO2 NRs and Cu2O NPs, respectively. Doping elements on TiO2 NRs is also a convenient way to improve their catalytic performance. However, different doping methods and doping levels have important effects on the product selectivity. Zhang et al. used N2H4 or NH3 as the nitrogen source, respectively, to study the effect of different chemical bond forms on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance and product selectivity of N–TiO2.185 Under visible light irradiation, N–TiO2 doped with NH3 could reduce CO2 to CO, while CH4 was the main product on N–TiO2 doped with N2H4. Compared with NH3, N2H4 contained both N–H and N–N groups, which promoted the conversion of CO2 to CH4, as shown in Fig. 12(b). Therefore, the product selectivity could be controlled by controlling the chemical bond of the nitrogen sources.

(a–c) have been adapted from ref. 185, 186 and 188, respectively, with permission from Elsevier: ref. 185, copyright 2022, ref. 186, copyright 2015 and ref. 188, copyright 2020. 
Loading of plasmonic metals Au, Pt and Ag on TiO2 NRs can induce LSPR. On the one hand, the working range of photocatalysts can be extended to visible light and even near-infrared light. On the other hand, the existence of Schottky junctions can promote the separation of charge carriers, in which the metal NPs act as electron traps.186 Tahir et al. loaded ZnFe2O4 microspheres onto Ag/TiO2 NRs to study their photocatalytic CO2 RR performance.187 Compared with TiO2 NPs/Ag/ZnFe2O4, TiO2 NRs/Ag/ZnFe2O4 could selectively reduce CO2 to CO with a 1.4-fold increase in yield, which confirmed the advantages of the 1D nanorod structure in improving light absorption and carrier separation. As shown in Fig. 12(c), ZnFe2O4 and TiO2 could construct a Z-scheme heterojunction system, and Ag NPs as conductors of the two semiconductor materials further promoted the carrier transport, making the photoactivity of ZnFe2O4/Ag/TiO2 NRs 1.49 times higher than that of ZnFe2O4/TiO2 NRs.
The small specific surface area of conventional photoreactors limits the utilization of solar energy. The optofluidic planar reactor combines microfluidic technology and optical technology, which can increase the light utilization rate by increasing the light transmission area and promote mass transfer by rationally adjusting the flow parameters, which significantly improves the photocatalytic CO2 RR efficiency.188 Cheng et al. prepared Cu2+-doped TiO2 nanorod films and studied the effects of different doping concentrations, CO2 flow rate and reaction temperature on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance in an optofluidic planar reactor system as shown in Fig. 13.189 Under optimal conditions, the yields of methanol and ethanol were 36.18 μmol gcat−1 h−1 and 79.13 μmol gcat−1 h−1, respectively. In the follow-up study, Cheng et al. prepared TiO2 NRs by the hydrothermal method and loaded Cu2+ and CdS quantum dots on their surfaces to study the effects of CdS concentration, CO2 flow rate and operating parameters on the yield of reducing CO2 to ethanol.188 Under optimal conditions, the yield of ethanol was 109.12 μmol gcat−1 h−1. In addition to the inherent advantages of the optofluidic planar reactor system, the combination of Cu2+-doped TiO2 NRs and CdS quantum dots promoted carrier separation and broadened the visible light response.

5.2.2 Cu-based nanorods. 
Cu2O has excellent photoresponsivity and good selectivity for products such as CH4 and CH3OH in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Since the VB of Cu2O is located above the oxidation potential of H2O, the performance of Cu2O-based catalysts is usually optimized by elemental doping or construction of heterojunctions with wide-bandgap semiconductors. Yu et al. investigated the OER and CO2 RR performance of Cl-doped Cu2O NRs driven by visible light.190 First, Cl doping optimized the band structure of Cu2O, making it exhibit good performance for both the OER and CO2 RR at the same time, as shown in Fig. 14(a). Second, Cl doping enhanced the conductivity of Cu2O NRs, which effectively promoted the transfer of photogenerated electrons. Then, the Cl–Cu2O NRs exhibited a good *CO adsorption capacity, thereby enhancing the selectivity of CH4. More importantly, due to the timely consumption of photogenerated holes, the oxidation of Cu2O could be prevented, thereby avoiding photo-corrosion and improving the stability of the catalyst. Zhou et al. supported Cu NPs on Cu2O NRs to construct metal–metal oxide semiconductor heterojunctions, as shown in Fig. 14(b).191 The 1D nanostructure optimized the photoresponsivity of Cu2O@Cu, and the Cu NPs enhanced the conductivity of the catalyst and promoted the transport of photogenerated electrons, thereby improving the stability of Cu2O@Cu. Under visible light, Cu2O@Cu could reduce CO2 to CH4 and C2H4 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.40% and still maintained good activity after 4 photocatalytic cycles.
 Fig. 14  Schematic diagram of the mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 on (a) Cl–Cu2O nanorods, (b) Cu2O@Cu, (c) rGO–CuO nanorods, and (d) C–Cu2O.

(d) has been adapted from ref. 194 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2016. 
Combining Cu2O with carbon nanomaterials with good electrical conductivity can facilitate the transfer of carriers. On the one hand, its catalytic performance can be improved. On the other hand, Cu2O can be prevented from being oxidized and reduced due to the fast transfer of electrons and holes. Gusain et al. supported CuO/Cu2O NRs on rGO to study the effects of the nanorod structure and Cu valence on their photocatalytic CO2 RR performance, as shown in Fig. 14(c).192 Cu2+ exhibited better performance under the same conditions, and the methanol yield on rGO–CuO NRs was 5 and 7 times higher than that of rGO–Cu2O and rGO–CuO. Coating a “protective film” on the surface of Cu2O is also an effective way to improve its stability. Yu et al. used a carbon layer to wrap Cu2O NRs with a mesoporous structure as a “protective film”.193 The Cu2O NRs with a mesoporous structure provided a large surface area and a large number of active sites, which enhanced their CO2 adsorption capacity. The carbon layer promoted the separation of electron–hole pairs and acted as a protective layer to improve the stability of Cu2O, as shown in Fig. 14(d). The apparent quantum efficiency of CH4 and C2H4 at 400 nm was 2.07%, and the material still maintained good stability after 6 photocatalytic cycles.


5.2.3 Other types of nanorod catalysts. 
ZnO nanorods have good photo-response ability and good performance in carrier separation and transport, so they have been widely studied in the field of photocatalytic CO2 RR.194,195 The charge separation and transport performance could be further optimized by loading Cu2O on the tip of ZnO NRs to construct p–n junctions. CO was the main CO2 reduction product, and the yield increased with the increase of Cu2O loading.196 To further improve the catalytic performance and stability of Cu2O/ZnO NRs, Zhang et al. synthesized Ag–Cu2O/ZnO NR ternary composite catalysts.197 Ag–Cu2O/ZnO NRs exhibited better stability than Cu2O/ZnO NRs due to the ability of Ag NPs to facilitate the transfer of photogenerated holes on Cu2O. Similarly, Thang et al. loaded Ag NPs onto g-C3N4/ZnO NRs.198 Ag NPs could improve the visible light response range of the catalyst and facilitate multi-electron CO2 RR, which converted CO2 to acetone. Under the same conditions, the product yields on Ag–g-C3N4/ZnO NRs were 8.4-fold and 7.5-fold higher than those on ZnO NRs and g-C3N4/ZnO NRs, respectively.
Combining 2D, 3D semiconductors and 1D CdS NRs to construct heterojunctions can enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS. Yang et al. constructed 2D/1D heterojunctions from BiOBr nanosheets and CdS nanorods, and the yields of reducing CO2 to CO under sunlight were 1.8 and 6.4 times higher than those of BiOBr nanosheets and CdS nanorods, respectively.199 Yu et al. prepared rGO–CdS NRs for photocatalytic selective reduction of CO2 to methane.200 As an electron acceptor and carrier, rGO could promote the separation of carriers and enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2. Therefore, the yield of methane on rGO–CdS NRs was about 10 times higher than that of CdS NRs. Kandy et al. constructed a heterojunction by in situ growth of LaPO4 microspheres on the surface of CdS NRs.201 The close contact between LaPO4 and CdS significantly promoted the separation and transfer of carriers. LaPO4/CdS could convert CO2 to CO at a rate of 960 μmol h−1 g−1, which was 3.9 times that of CdS NRs.

5.3 Application of nanotube catalysts in photocatalytic CO2 RR

5.3.1 TiO2 nanotubes. 
TiO2 NTs have good visible light responsiveness and superior carrier transport properties. The yield of photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CH4 on TiO2 NTs is 2.33 times higher than that of TiO2 NPs. TiO2 NTs have a larger specific surface area and special hollow structure, which make the CH4 yield 1.48 times higher than that of TiO2 NRs.202 As shown in Fig. 15(a), the photocatalytic CO2 conversion performance could be optimized by loading Au NPs on TiO2 NTs, and the visible light absorption could be enhanced by LSPR.203,204 In the study by Khatun et al., the photocatalytic activities of TNTs and Au–TNTs for the conversion of CO2 to CH4 were 8.26% and 14.67%, respectively.204 On this basis, Perini et al. used a unique pressurized photoreactor with an aqueous solution containing the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the medium to study the effect of Au NPs, the ionic liquid and the pressure on the CO2 RR performance.205 The loading of Au NPs reduced the band gap of TiO2 NTs from 3.2 eV to 2.9 eV, as shown in Fig. 15(b). At 5 atm, methanol and methane yields on TNT/Au NPs were 279.6 mmol L−1 and 98.8 mmol L−1, respectively. The quantum yield at 440 nm was 1.12%. Pan et al. used single-atom binary metal components (Pt–Au) to modify defective TiO2 NTs.206 Pt and Au could stabilize the defective TiO2 NTs and enhance the separation and transport efficiency of electron–hole pairs. When the content of single-atom binary metal components was 0.33 wt%, the photocatalytic performance of Pt–Au/R-TNT was 149 times higher than that of R-TNT, and the total apparent quantum yield was 17.9%. Under sunlight, the main reduction products were CH4 (360.0 μmol g−1 h−1) and C2H6 (28.8 μmol g−1 h−1).

Electrodeposition of Cu2O NPs on TiO2 NTs to construct heterojunctions is one of the effective ways to modify TiO2.207 Cu2O/TNTs have better visible light absorption and exhibit high photocatalytic activity in the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH.208 Similarly, Kim et al. coupled TiO2 NTs and ZnIn2S4 nanosheets to construct 1D/2D heterojunctions.209 The TNT/ZIS composite exhibited an attractive light-absorbing ability, and the construction of the heterojunction could also facilitate the flow of carriers from ZnIn2S4 to TiO2, as shown in Fig. 15(c). When the loading of TNTs was 10 wt%, the CO formation rate was 4.41 mmol g−1 h−1, which was 1.5 times that of ZIS. Li et al. supported MgO on the surface of TiO2 NTs to prepare a composite photocatalyst with a network nanotube structure for CO2 emission.210 MgO had a strong adsorption capacity for CO2 and could also form magnesium carbonate species during the CO2 reduction process to promote the conversion of CO2 to CH4.


5.3.2 Other types of nanotube catalysts. 
Abou Asi et al. synthesized Ag@AgBr/CNT composite photocatalysts with different lengths and investigated the effects of CNT length, solution pH, and Ag@AgBr NPs on the performance of photocatalytic CO2 RR.211 The results showed that longer nanotubes were more favorable for charge transport, and CO2 could be converted into products such as CH4, CO, CH3OH, and CH3CH2OH under neutral and weak alkaline conditions. As shown in Fig. 15(d), Ag@AgBr NPs could promote carrier separation and exhibit good stability. Lashgari et al. synthesized a CNT/NiO/Fe2O3 ternary photocatalyst by supporting the metal oxide semiconductor Fe2O3 on the binary composite CNT/NiO and selectively reduced CO2 to CH3OH in aqueous solution.212 The introduction of Fe2O3 could reduce the material resistance and increase the light absorption area, the yield of CH3OH was twice that of CNT/NiO, and the product selectivity was 93%. Wang et al. used CNTs to decorate UIO-66-NH2 with regular pores and CO2 adsorption properties.213 On the one hand, CNTs could prevent the aggregation of UIO-66-NH2 and expose more active sites. On the other hand, CNTs could enhance the electrical conductivity and surface area of the composites. Therefore, UIO-66-NH2/CNT exhibited considerable CO2 reduction performance under sunlight and could suppress the hydrogen evolution competitive reaction.
Bending the 2D layered material into a tubular structure leads to deformation of the material, which can promote the formation of defects and oxygen vacancies, thereby increasing the active sites for CO2 reduction.214–216 Liu et al. synthesized phosphorus-doped g-C3N4 NTs using g-C3N4 nanosheets as precursors.217 P-g-C3N4 had a unique mesoporous structure and amino-rich surface, resulting in a 3.14-fold improvement in CO2 adsorption capacity. Phosphorus doping optimized the band structure of g-C3N4 and promoted charge transport, resulting in a 3.10-fold and 13.92-fold increase in CO and CH4 yields, respectively.

6 Application of 1D nanostructured catalysts in photoelectrocatalytic CO2 RR
6.1 Application of nanowire catalysts in photoelectrocatalytic CO2 RR
Nanowires have a larger aspect ratio, which can further increase their specific surface area. Besides, it is beneficial for the uniform distribution of the co-catalyst. In some cases, nanowires can also inhibit the agglomeration of co-catalysts. Therefore, a large number of photoelectrodes with nanowire structures have been developed to improve the efficiency of PEC CO2 RR.

6.1.1 Si-based nanowires. 
Si (1.12 eV) has been extensively studied in the field of photovoltaics and PEC CO2 RR because of the excellent photoelectric capabilities. However, the smooth surface of the Si plate reflects a large amount of incident light, which significantly affects the photocurrent density. Si NWs have good photoresponsivity, carrier transport rate, co-catalyst loading capacity, and stability. Therefore, CO2 can be reduced to CO and HCOOH directly using bare Si NWs as a photocathode.142,218
To improve the PEC performance of photocathodes, Si NWs are usually combined with co-catalysts. A well-performing semiconductor/co-catalyst system should take into account both the light absorption and CO2 RR processes. Ag is considered to be a promising co-catalyst for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO. Assembled Ag NPs on Si NWs as photocathodes could reduce CO2 to a H2/CO mixture (Fig. 16(a)).142 SEM images (Fig. 17(a) and (b)) show that the Si NWs were approximately 23 μm in length and 150 nm in average diameter. The current density of Si NWs was almost 7 times higher than that of the Si plate, which verified the outstanding advantages of Si nanowire arrays in photon capture and carrier separation. By adjusting the size of Ag NPs in the range of 4.2–16 nm, the molar ratio of H2/CO mixed gas products of 1–4 could be achieved. It could be seen that the selectivity of reduction products could be improved by rationally adjusting the size of the co-catalyst.

The structure of co-catalyst has a certain influence on the type and yield of the reduction products. Ma et al. fabricated Si NWs by MACE and loaded Ni@In co-catalysts with a shell–core structure on them (Fig. 16(b)).139 The average size of the Ni NPs was about 9.6 nm and the thickness of the in-shell was about 1.8 nm (Fig. 17(c) and (d)). The core–shell structure (Fig. 16(c)) could rapidly separate carriers and facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, thus providing a high photogenerated current density. Under simulated sunlight, the Ni@In/Si NWs could convert CO2 to HCOOH with a product formation rate and faradaic efficiency of 58 μmol h−1 cm−2 and 87%, which were 24 times and 12 times higher than those of the bare Si NW catalyst.
Non-metallic nanoparticles can be supported on Si NWs as co-catalysts for PEC CO2 RR. Weng et al. used CN to encapsulate CoN in situ transformed from ZIF-67 as co-catalysts to synthesize the Si NWs@CoN/CN photocathode.219 It could be seen that CoN/CN coatings were 20–50 nm thick, the CoN NPs were approximately 0.21 nm in size and the surfaces of CoN NPs were wrapped by approximately 0.34 nm thick porous graphitic carbon (Fig. 18). The combination of the Si NWs@CoP/CN photocathode and Pt anode exhibited outstanding PEC performance, which was attributed to the synergistic effect between CN and CoN. CoP/CN converted from ZIF-67 could inherit the porous nature of the precursor and build a rational interface during in situ growth, which could guide the development of novel co-catalysts with low reduction potential, high selectivity and good stability.

The construction of heterojunctions can further facilitate the transfer of electrons. Taking the PbS/Si NW photocathode as an example, due to the relatively matched energy bands between PbS and Si, the photogenerated electrons could be easily transferred from the CB of Si to the CB of PbS (Fig. 19(a)).118 On the surface of PbS, CO2 could be reduced to CH3OH. Most biological molds, which can be directly extracted from plants, have efficient catalytic properties. Combining biocatalytic and PEC systems is a considerable route to improve the efficiency of CO2 RR. Lian et al. used Cu foam soaked in chlorophyll solution as the photoanode and Si NWs as the photocathode to reduce CO2 to CH3OH under an external bias of 0.5 V.143 Due to the Z-scheme constructed between Cu and Si NWs (Fig. 19(b)), the CO2 RR could also be achieved without a bias voltage.

6.1.2 GaN nanowires. 
GaN has been widely used because of its low manufacturing cost and good stability. However, the large bandgap of GaN leads to its poor photoresponsivity. Vertical growth of GaN NWs on the Si substrate is one of the approaches to construct 1D nanostructured catalysts. GaN NWs not only enhance the stability of the Si substrate, but also improve the carrier extraction rate.121 The combination of two light-harvesting semiconductors can generate stronger electrons in complementary ways. Furthermore, the 1D nanostructure of GaN NWs can suppress the Fresnel reflection, which can further enhance the light-harvesting ability of the photocathode. The larger specific surface area of GaN NWs also increased the loading of the co-catalyst, thus significantly improving the catalytic activity of the photocathode. Shan et al. coupled n-GaN NWs to the n+–p–p+ Si substrate.121 Under simulated light irradiation, the n-GaN NWs readily absorbed photoelectrons from the Si substrate and transferred them to a ruthenium-based co-catalyst and reduced CO2 to HCOOH with a faradaic efficiency of 64%.
Cu-based catalysts are widely used in both PC and PEC, supporting Cu NPs on Si/GaN NWs as the photocathode could reduce CO2 to CH4 and CO (Fig. 20(a)).120 However, their low affinity for CO2 led to suboptimal reduction efficiencies. The establishment of a metal/metal oxide interface or multi-metal interface could improve its PEC performance. Based on Si/GaN NWs, Zhou et al. investigated the effect of the binary Cu–Fe co-catalyst on the performance of PEC CO2 RR.144 Combining molecular beam epitaxy and electrodeposition technology, the GaN NWs grew on the Si substrate, and the Cu–Fe co-catalyst was uniformly deposited on it. The synergistic effect of binary Cu–Fe co-catalysts was beneficial for the activation of CO2 and promoted the reduction of CO2 to CH4.

Reducing CO2 into CO/H2 syngas is a feasible way to convert greenhouse gases into high value-added products. However, the CO/H2 ratio plays a key role in the further industrial application of syngas. The reverse water–gas shift process is commonly used in the industry to control the CO/H2 ratio. However, this process will cause large-scale carbon emissions, which is contrary to modern environmental requirements. Chu et al. supported Pt/TiO2 on GaN NWs to construct a metal/oxide interface for reducing CO2 to CO/H2 syngas and tuned the CO/H2 ratio in the range of 4:1 to 1:6.145 In the course of subsequent research, they assembled GaN NWs on a Si plate. Then Au NPs and Pt NPs were loaded on the top and side of GaN NWs to reduce CO2 to CO/H2 syngas (Fig. 20(b)).220 The ratio of CO/H2 in the syngas was successfully controlled at 1:99–10:1 by changing the composition of the double co-catalyst. Gas emissions in the industry are often a mixture of components. Dong et al. supported Cu NPs on GaN NWs to convert the CO2/H2S mixed gas into HCOOH (Fig. 21).146 During the reaction, H2S gas doped in CO2 converted Cu NPs to CuS NPs, which obtained photogenerated electrons from the Si substrate through GaN NWs to reduce CO2 to HCOOH.

6.1.3 Other types of nanowire catalysts. 
Catalysts with porous structures tend to exhibit a better CO2 reduction ability. Their large surface area and porosity are beneficial for capturing photons, supporting co-catalysts, promoting the transport of carriers, and providing more active sites. As a new type of porous material, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are composed of metal ions and organic ligands. In the past decade, MOFs have received extensive attention in the fields of CO2 capture and utilization. It is well known that increasing the concentration of CO2 on the catalyst surface can significantly improve the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Combining MOFs and nanowire catalysts for PEC CO2 RR will accelerate the process of efficient CO2 utilization. In addition, it will be possible to study CO2 reduction intermediate reactions and mechanisms at the molecular level using MOFs as platforms.221 Shen et al. combined ZIF-9 with a porous structure and Co3O4 NWs as a photocathode for CO2 reduction (Fig. 22).124 ZIF-9 was connected by benzimidazolate with Co(II) ions as nodes, and its unique porous structure was conducive to the adsorption of CO2. The Co(II) ions from ZIF-9 were combined with O atoms, which have the function of CO2 activation. During the PEC CO2 RR process, CO2 was reduced to HCOOH with close to 100% selectivity as a liquid product at a low overpotential of 290 mV.

Cu-based catalysts are widely used for CO2 reduction, and bare Cu2O as a photocathode can reduce CO2 to CH3OH. However, the high overpotential and instability of Cu-based photocathodes in aqueous solutions limit their further development. The above problems can be effectively improved by constructing nanostructures on the surface of the Cu-based photocathode. Lee et al. wrapped TiO2 on Cu2O NWs and supported Cu+ on the surface as a photocathode.122 The intercalation of Cu+ made TiO2 active for CO2 adsorption. The faradaic efficiency of the photocathode reached 56.5%, which was twice than that of the bare Cu2O NW. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have a porous structure similar to metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Wang et al. used free-base porphyrin-COFs to wrap carbon fibers and assembled Cu NWs on their surfaces to obtain a Cu@porphyrin-COF photocathode.148 The photocathode exhibited unusual PEC performance due to the better proton and light absorption ability of Cu NWs.
α-Fe2O3 is an n-type semiconductor with the advantages of abundant Earth reserves, cheap manufacturing cost, stable chemical properties, and environmental friendliness. However, the short hole diffusion length and light penetration depth of α-Fe2O3 do not match. This results in a higher electron–hole pair recombination rate and slower electron mobility. Designing α-Fe2O3 into a 1D structure can provide sufficient light absorption area and reasonable electron migration paths. Wang et al. fabricated FeOOH nanowires on an FTO glass substrate by electrodeposition. Then, α-Fe2O3 nanowires were in situ grown on it. Finally, Ag NPs were deposited on the nanowires to obtain Ag/α-Fe2O3.123 The loading of Ag NPs extended the light absorption ability of Ag/α-Fe2O3 to a wider wavelength range. Besides, the LSPR induced by Ag NPs enhanced the generation and separation of charges. At −0.5 V vs. RHE, the Ag/α-Fe2O3 photocathode reduced CO2 to CH3OH with a faradaic efficiency of 51% and exhibited long-term stability over an operating time of over 50 h. Biocatalytic artificial photosynthesis (BAP) uses biocatalysts to combine enzymatic reactions and photocatalytic reduction reactions. Nam et al. loaded cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) on α-Fe2O3 NWs as a photoanode for hydrolysis–oxidation reactions.222 The CO2 reduction system combined the PEC regeneration of nicotinamide cofactors (NADH) with the enzyme-linked reaction of CO2 to continuously reduce CO2 to HCOOH.
ZnO has a suitable energy band structure and light absorption ability, making it a potential candidate material in the field of PEC CO2 RR. Moreover, the optical and chemical properties of ZnO can be tuned by lattice defects and appropriate elemental doping.126 Maarouf et al. used density functional theory (DFT) to discuss the adsorption of CO2 and CO on ZnO NWs and revealed the effect of element doping on the chemisorption energy of Zn-based nanowire catalysts.223 The bandgap of ZnTe is about 2.26 eV, which is a promising p-type semiconductor. It has an extremely negative CB edge (1.63 V vs. RHE) and can easily transfer photoelectrons to the acceptor in the electrolyte. Jang et al. supported the plasmonic metal Au on ZnTe/ZnO NWs to construct a heterojunction for PEC CO2 RR (Fig. 23).224 Au/ZnTe/ZnO NWs had a large absorption range in visible light due to the LSPR effect induced by Au NPs. Au NPs and ZnTe formed a Schottky junction, resulting in the enhanced band bending of ZnTe, which was beneficial for the separation and migration of electron–hole pairs. It is worth noting that Au/ZnTe/ZnO NWs could suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction due to the enhanced selectivity of CO2 reduction by Au NPs. The results showed that Au/ZnTe/ZnO NWs exhibited a 410-fold increase in CO production and a 47.5-fold increase in selectivity compared with bare ZnTe/ZnO NWs.

6.2 Application of nanorod catalysts in PEC CO2 RR
The small aspect ratio of nanorods leads to a certain decrease in their light absorption capacity and co-catalyst loading capacity. But a 1D array of nanorods is thicker, making them adaptable to harsher reaction environments. For example, under high-speed stirring or continuous scouring, the 1D arrays can maintain their original shape and will not be easily broken.
Due to the low solubility of CO2 in water, the surface chemical reaction rate is slow and the product selectivity is poor. Referring to the field of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production, Nishiyama et al. realized a large-area continuous photocatalytic reaction.225 Although CO2 RR is more complicated, the introduction of gas diffusion electrodes creates the possibility to realize the continuous reaction of high concentration CO2 on the electrode surface. In recent years, several excellent review articles have provided detailed analyses of continuous flow electrocatalytic systems. The design of a novel continuous flow reactor, the development of a gas diffusion electrode, and the effect of various operating parameters on the efficiency of the electrocatalytic process were summarized.106,107 To increase the conversion of PEC CO2 RR to a meaningful level, a continuous flow device can be used to overcome the limitation of mass transport. In recent years, several continuous-flow PEC reactors (CFPR) have also been developed.108,226,227 Homayoni et al. synthesized CuO/Cu2O photocathodes, which was performed in a microchannel continuous flow system to reduce CO2 to ethanol at −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl.109 Since the surface of the photocathode was continuously scoured by the electrolyte, a new preparation method was used to obtain CuO/Cu2O nanorod arrays with larger sizes and denser structures. In flow reaction systems, thick and robust nanorod structures could withstand mechanical stress from the electrolyte flow. In another study, Kalamaras et al. used a hydrothermal method to synthesize α-Fe2O3 nanorods and electrodeposited CuO particles with a cubic structure on them.125 The construction of the heterojunction significantly improved its carrier separation rate. More importantly, the α-Fe2O3/CuO electrode was used in a continuous microfluidic PEC cell (Fig. 24) for CO2 reduction. CO2 could be reduced to HCOOH and CH3OH with an STF efficiency of 0.48% at the optimal electrolyte flow rate of 0.08 ml min−1. The performances of various nanowire/rod photocathodes for PEC CO2 RR are summarized in Table 5.

6.3 Application of nanotube catalysts in PEC CO2 RR
Nanotubes have a hollow structure, which means that there is a shorter migration path in the horizontal direction. Therefore, the recombination rate of carriers can be further reduced. In recent years, nanotube catalysts including TiO2 NTs,228–230 Fe2O3 NTs,129 Co3O4 NTs,130 and Ta3N5 NTs131 have been successively applied to PEC CO2 RR.

6.3.1 TiO2 nanotubes. 
Since Inoue et al. first reported the PEC CO2 RR on TiO2 in 1979, TiO2 has been widely studied due to its strong redox ability, stable chemical properties, low cost, and environment friendliness.231 Different from other structures, TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) have the advantages of a larger surface area, more active sites, and more stable redox ability. However, the wide bandgap of TiO2 limits its working conditions to UV light, which only accounts for nearly 4% of the spectrum. This defect directly limits the wide application of TiO2. A large number of researchers have loaded photosensitive materials or plasma metals on TNTs to make them work in a larger wavelength band and promote the rapid separation and transport of carriers by constructing a heterojunction.232 In addition, loading materials with a CO2 adsorption capacity on the surface of TNTs can improve the interfacial reaction. Based on this, TNTs have been widely used in both photocathodes and photoanodes.233,234
A photoanode plays a dual role in the PEC system. On the one hand, the photoanode can provide a voltage to compensate for the potential of the working electrode. On the other hand, the hydrolysis reaction at the photoanode continues to transport photoelectrons and protons to the working electrode.235 The modification of TNTs with noble metals such as Ag,128 Au,236 Pt,235,237 and Pd234 as the photoanode can significantly improve the reduction efficiency of PEC CO2. Raj et al. supported Ag dendrites on the TNT surface as a photoanode to promote CO2 RR.128 In the ultraviolet region, Ag could capture the photoelectrons generated in TiO2 through the Schottky barrier. At the same time, a large number of hot electrons were generated due to the LSPR effect induced by Ag and injected into the CB of TiO2. In a follow-up study, Au NPs were loaded onto TNTs. Similar conclusions on Ag@TNT were drawn that the loading of the plasmonic metal was beneficial for improving the light absorption ability in the visible light region. Furthermore, the generation and injection of hot electrons improved the efficiency of the PEC system.236 Compared to the photoanode, TNTs are often used as the working electrode to reduce CO2. Therefore, this section focused on analyzing the application of TNTs in photocathodes.
6.3.1.1 Reasonable loading on TiO2 nanotubes. 
When TNTs are modified with semiconductor materials, the loading quantity, morphology, and preparation process play an important role in the PEC performance. CuFeO2 has the advantages of a narrow bandgap (1.5 eV) and non-toxicity. Like other p-type semiconductors, CuFeO2 also faces the problem of high carrier recombination rate. Zhang et al. fabricated photocathodes by combining p-type CuFeO2 and n-type Nb-doped TiO2 nanotubes (TNNTs) and investigated the effect of different CuFeO2 coating thicknesses on the performance of CuFeO2/TNNTs.150 When the loading of CuFeO2 was 1.8 g m−2, it had a better coverage area and thickness. The introduction of CuFeO2 (1.8 g m−2) significantly improved the light absorption capacity of the CuFeO2/TNNT composite electrode (Fig. 25(a)). Furthermore, two semiconductor materials could build a Z-scheme heterojunction, in which holes on CuFeO2 combined with weaker electrons on TNNTs to retain the strong electrons on CuFeO2 for CO2 RR (Fig. 25(a)). The CuFeO2/TNNT photocathode could reduce CO2 to CH3CH2OH with a yield of 3.3 μmol 5 h−1 cm−2.

The visible light absorption ability of TNTs can be significantly improved by loading CdSeTe NS (Fig. 25(b)).238 The sheet-like CdSeTe possessed excellent electron transportability, which provided sufficient electrons for the reduction reaction. Its CB potential (−0.46 eV) was more negative than the reduction potential of CO2/CH3OH, and the VB potential (1.02 eV) was also positive to the water oxidation potential (Fig. 26(c)). At a potential of −0.8 V, CO2 could be reduced to CH3OH with a faradaic efficiency of 87.95% on the CdSeTe NS/TiO2 NT photocathode. To explore the effect of different CdSeTe structures on the photocathode performance, Wei et al. prepared (CdSeTe NPs)/TiO2 NTs and (CdSeTe NSs)/TiO2 NTs, respectively.239 Due to the more reasonable geometry and distribution of CdSeTe NPs, (CdSeTe NPs)/TiO2 NTs exhibited better product selectivity and a 16-fold higher CH3OH yield than (CdSeTe NSs)/TiO2 NTs. Besides, the detailed mechanism of the 6-electron reaction of reducing CO2 to CH3OH was also proposed (Fig. 26(b)).

Changes in the preparation sequence often result in products with different structures and properties. By loading InP and SnO2 on TiO2 nanotubes in different orders, InP/SnO2/TiO2 NT and SnO2/InP/TiO2 NT photocathodes could be obtained with different structures.240 The SnO2/InP/TiO2 NTs had a regular network structure, while the surface of InP/SnO2/TiO2 NTs formed an irregular structure. Since SnO2 had better light transmittance than InP, the SnO2/InP/TiO2 NTs had a better visible light absorption range by loading SnO2 in the outer layer without hindering the light propagation (Fig. 25(c)). On SnO2/InP/TiO2 NTs, photoelectrons were finally transferred from TNTs to SnO2 through InP. The transfer direction of the photoelectrons was consistent with the electron transfer direction generated by the external bias, and their superposition could promote the reduction reaction. Besides, the holes generated on TNTs and SnO2 could be transferred to the InP surface, thus avoiding electron/hole recombination (Fig. 26(d)). However, on InP/SnO2/TiO2 NTs, the electrons were hindered in transport due to the opposite migration direction of the photogenerated electrons and the electrons generated by the external bias. A large number of holes were transferred to the catalyst surface, which was unfavorable for electrons to participate in the reduction reaction (Fig. 26(e)). Therefore, SnO2/InP/TiO2 NTs had better PEC CO2 RR performance in practical operation (Fig. 25(d)).
6.3.1.2 Loading MOFs on TiO2 nanotubes. 
As mentioned above, MOFs with high chemical stability and a large specific surface area have shown remarkable achievements in the field of PEC. Irikura et al. used a solvothermal method to precipitate Ru3(BTC)2 on Ti/TiO2 NTs as a photocathode to reduce CO2 to CH3OH.151 The average diameter of TNTs was about 100 nm and the thickness was about 18 nm (Fig. 27(a) and (b)). Ru3(BTC)2 with a thickness of 5 nm was uniformly deposited on the surface of Ti/TiO2 NTs. The introduction of Ru3(BTC)2 reduced the bandgap from 3.22 eV to 2.81 eV, increasing its light absorption capability in the visible spectrum (Fig. 28(a)). Due to the adsorption properties of Ru3(BTC)2 to CO2, the efficiency of CO2 RR had also been improved accordingly. At −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 314 μmol L−1 of CH3OH was generated after 3 h experiment. Cardoso et al. supported ZIF-8 with an average particle size of 50–57 nm on Ti/TiO2 NT (Fig. 27(c) and (d)).152 The absorption ability of Ti/TiO2 NT–ZIF-8 to visible light was stronger than that of Ti/TiO2 NT and ZIF-8 (Fig. 28(b)). It could reduce CO2 into CH3CH2OH and CH3OH under UV-vis irradiation at a potential of +0.1 V. Then, they used ascorbic acid as a sacrificial agent to study its effect on the PEC performance of Ti/TiO2 NT–ZIF-8.241 The addition of ascorbic acid effectively consumed the holes on the electrode surface, which was beneficial for the separation of electrons and holes. The conversion rates of CO2 to CH3OH and CH3CH2OH were increased by 22% and 12%, respectively.

6.3.1.3 Loading plasma metal NPs on TiO2 nanotubes. 
The LSPR effect of nanoparticles such as Au and Pd can effectively improve the light absorption ability of TNTs in the visible and near-infrared light regions. Shen et al. doped Au NPs to TiO2 NTs as light collectors coupled with nanotube photonic crystals (NTPCs).154 To stabilize the species and yield of the reduced products, Cu NPs were loaded onto TiO2–Au NTPCs. Finally, the Cu@TiO2–Au NTPC photocathode was obtained. Cu NPs and Au NPs were uniformly deposited on the surface and were relatively independent without forming alloys (Fig. 27(e)). Due to the periodic porous nanostructure of NTPC, multiple reflections and scattering would occur when light passed through (Fig. 28(c)). The introduction of Au NPs promoted the light absorption ability in the visible light range, and the oscillation peak in the visible light region was more intense. The Cu NPs also triggered the LSPR effect, which further enhanced the light absorption capability of the Cu@TiO2–Au NTPC photocathode in the range of 400–600 nm. Since the work function of Cu NPs was below the Fermi level of TiO2, the band edges of TiO2 bent downward accordingly when they were in contact with each other. The hot electrons generated by Au NPs could be smoothly transferred to the surface of Cu NPs, thereby promoting the CO2 RR (Fig. 29). At −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the selectivity of the main reduction product HCOOH was 98%, and the faradaic efficiency was 82.6%.

Graphene and its derivatives have a wide range of applications in the fields of PC and PEC due to their good electrical conductivity and large specific surface area. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are made of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with excellent electron mobility and thermal conductivity. Moreover, the 2D structure enables GNRs to have more crystal defects and active sites. Souza et al. loaded Cu, Pd, and Pt on GNRs in different ratios and deposited them on TNTs as photocathodes for reducing CO2 to CH3OH and CH3CH2OH.242 Similarly, Ru et al. supported Pd NPs and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) onto TNTs grown on Ti wires (Fig. 27(f)).243 The TNTs/Ti supported by Pd NPs and RGO showed a black color, which was favorable for Pd/RGO/TNTs/Ti to absorb sunlight. The UV-vis spectrum (Fig. 28(d)) showed that the absorption ability of Pd/RGO/TNTs/Ti in the UV region was enhanced. Moreover, due to the LSPR effect induced by Pd NPs, the electrode underwent a slight redshift. Since the regular 1D arrays of TNTs provided suitable electron transport channels, rapid electron transfer was facilitated. A large number of electrons gathered in the RGO layer to ensure the adsorption and reduction of CO2. In addition, Pd NPs located on the surface of TNTs could also promote CO2 reduction. At the applied potential of 0.8 V, Pd/RGO/TNTs/Ti exhibited the best PEC CO2 RR performance. The yields of CH3OH and CH3CH2OH were 1624 nmol h−1 cm−2 and 536 nmol h−1 cm−2, respectively (Fig. 28(e)).
6.3.1.4 Construction of heterojunctions on TiO2 nanotubes. 
Oxides or sulfides of Earth-abundant metals (Fe and Cu) with suitable band structures and stability can be used as working electrodes to reduce CO2 to organics. Combining them with TNTs to form a heterojunction can optimize the bandgap and optimize the electron transfer path to improve the carrier separation rate. Jiang et al. uniformly loaded α-Fe2O3 NPs onto TNTs with a dual morphology (Fig. 30(a)).156 The structure of the bilayer was composed of TNTs with diameters of 50 nm and 150 nm, which provided a sufficient surface area for the loading of α-Fe2O3 NPs. α-Fe2O3 NPs with a particle size of 5 nm were uniformly supported on the outer and inner walls of the TNTs. Compared with TiO2, α-Fe2O3/TiO2 NTs exhibited significant absorption peaks in the visible region (Fig. 31(a)). TiO2 generated electron–hole pairs under the irradiation of light, and the lower CB position of α-Fe2O3 promoted the transfer of electrons. A large amount of CO2 adsorbed on the surface of α-Fe2O3 could be converted into CO2˙−, which was further converted into an HCO3 in aqueous solution. Finally, CO2 was reduced to HCOOH on the electron-rich α-Fe2O3 surface (Fig. 32(a)). Under the optimal conditions, the yield of HCOOH reached 74896.13 nmol h−1 cm−2, and the selectivity was 99.89%. Han et al. used FeS2 and TiO2 NTs to synthesize worm-like FeS2/TiO2 NTs.153 After the modification of FeS2, FeS2/TiO2 NTs had excellent visible light absorption ability. The bandgap was narrowed to 1.70 eV and could be excited by incident light with wavelengths less than 730 nm (Fig. 31(b and c)). Since the prepared electrode had a heterojunction structure, the separation of carriers was effectively promoted. The FeS2/TiO2 NT electrode exhibited better PEC performance compared with FeS2 and TiO2 NTs. Zhang et al. intercalated CuO into TiO2 NTs to prepare CuO NPs@TiO2 NTs for PEC CO2 to CH3OH.244 Compared with traditional preparation methods, the conversion of part of Ti(IV) in TiO2 NTs to Ti(III) by electrochemical reduction was more favorable for the intercalation of CuO. The electrochemically reduced TNTs exhibited a better conductivity and active surface. CuO could be uniformly deposited on the surface and pores of TNTs (Fig. 30(b and c)). CuO combined with TiO2 to form a Z-scheme heterojunction, and the photogenerated electrons located in the CB of TiO2 could recombine with the holes located in the VB of CuO, thus retaining stronger photoelectrons on CuO. The CO2 was reduced to HCHO, which was further oxidized to CH3OH under the action of an external potential (Fig. 32(b)). The applications of various nanotube photocathodes for PEC CO2 RR are summarized in Table 6.

6.3.2 Other types of nanotubes. 
Fe2O3 and Co3O4 can also be designed as nanotube structures for PEC CO2 RR. Fe2O3 has a narrow band gap (1.96 eV), which can absorb light in a large visible light range. Designing it into a nanotube structure can further enhance its light-absorbing ability and electron-transport ability, but its weak reducing ability limits its application. Cu2O can reduce CO2 to CH3OH with high selectivity, which has been reported in the fields of PC and PEC. It is worth noting that Cu2O has a band structure matching that of Fe2O3 and its CB is more negative than Fe2O3. Therefore, the combination of Cu2O and Fe2O3 NTs can satisfy both the light absorption and the reduction performance of the photoelectrode. Li et al. supported spherical Cu2O on Fe2O3 NTs and obtained several Cu2O/Fe2O3 NT photoelectrodes with different morphologies by controlling the electrodeposition time. The product with an electrodeposition time of 30 min had the best PEC performance, which could reduce CO2 to CH3OH with a faradaic efficiency of 93%.129 Besides the synergy between the two materials, the excellent performance of the Cu2O/Fe2O3 NT photocathode also depended on the synergy between PC and PEC. Co3O4 can be directly used as a photocathode to reduce CO2 to HCOO−, but the low electron–hole separation rate limits its catalytic performance. Designing Co3O4 into a nanotube structure can improve its conductivity and facilitate the separation of electron–hole pairs. Loading nanoparticles on the surface of nanotubes can improve the adsorption performance of electrons and reaction intermediates. Shen et al. supported Cu NPs on Co3O4 NTs to obtain a Cu/Co3O4 NT photocathode for reducing CO2 to HCOO− with nearly 100% selectivity and faradaic efficiency.130 The CO2 in the electrolyte was captured by Cu NPs that accumulate a large number of electrons and adsorbed on the Cu NPs in the form of O–Cu. The CO2˙− suspended in the electrolyte was easily protonated to form the HCOO− radical.

7 Conclusion and outlook
This review briefly introduced the progress of P(E)C CO2 RR based on 1D nanostructured catalysts. In particular, we studied the preparation methods, structural characteristics, and applications of 1D nanostructured catalysts in the field of P(E)C CO2 RR. In summary, 1D nanostructured catalysts have the following advantages:
(1) The regular array increases the light trapping, thereby enhancing its light-harvesting ability.
(2) The large surface increases the light-absorbing area and active sites and has a high loading potential.
(3) The 1D linear structure provides a suitable electron migration path, which is beneficial for improving the carrier separation rate and electron migration speed.
(4) The existence of a concentration gradient on the 1D structure can promote the surface mass transfer and optimize the interfacial reaction.
Although 1D nanostructured catalysts have been widely used in the field of P(E)C CO2 RR due to their special geometric structures and properties, the development is still in the initial and exploratory stage, and further research work needs to be continued. Its main development prospects are as follows:
(1) The preparation of most 1D nanostructured catalysts involves the use of HF, HNO3 and NH4F. Considering environmental issues, new environmentally friendly preparation methods still need to be studied.
(2) Although 1D arrays are excellent supports of metal co-catalysts, the aggregation and detachment of metal nanoparticles will still occur after long-term operation. The loading mode of the co-catalyst can be optimized and the “binder” can be developed to achieve the uniform and stable loading of the co-catalyst.
(3) The aspect ratio of 1D nanostructures often affects the light-harvesting ability and the loading of co-catalysts. However, the key parameters affecting its PEC performance are unclear.
(4) The large loading of the co-catalyst can enhance the CO2 RR. However, the excessive loading will affect the light absorption ability of the catalyst. The relationship between co-catalyst loading, interfacial reaction, and light absorption capacity is critical for the development of new catalysts in the future.
(5) The loading of a multicomponent co-catalyst can lead to competing reactions. How to rationally design the composition and distribution of a multiple co-catalyst on 1D arrays to facilitate an efficient interfacial reaction requires further exploration.
