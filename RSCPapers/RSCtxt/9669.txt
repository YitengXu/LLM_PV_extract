    First published on 19th May 2016AbstractIntegration of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials and their composites into energy storage devices, especially rechargeable batteries, offers opportunities to timely tackle the challenges of ever growing clean and sustainable energy demands. Therefore, it is crucial to design hybrid 2D electrode materials for high performance rechargeable batteries and to fundamentally understand their storage mechanisms at the atomic or nanoscopic levels. This review firstly describes some of the exciting progress achieved in the economic production of graphenes, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), and their composites. Then we survey the recent developments in their electrochemical energy storage pathways and present the associated three kinds of storage mechanisms. In addition, we highlight the uncovered structure–performance relationships while utilizing advanced microscopic techniques, such as in situ high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and spherical aberration-corrected scanning TEM (STEM), both leading to deep unveiling and understanding of the atomic-scale ion storage/release mechanisms and hence providing clear guidance for designing optimized 2D nanostructured electrode materials. Finally, the major challenges and opportunities that researchers have to face in this field are outlined. We hope that this review can deepen the Chemical and Material Science Communities' understanding of this field and thus effectively contribute to the smart design of future-generation 2D nanostructured electrodes and exploitation of their microscopic mechanisms toward novel high-performance rechargeable batteries.

1. Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are an important class of rechargeable batteries which work owing to shuttling of Li ions between anodes and cathodes immersed in electrolytes. They have been widely used in our daily life for powering portable electronics (mobile phones, pads, laptops, etc.) and burgeoning hybrid and electric vehicles. The commercial success of LIBs mainly depends on their respective high energy density (an order of 100 W h kg−1),1 no/little memory effect compared with nickel–cadmium and nickel–metal-hydride batteries,2 and long lifespan (usually >500 cycles).3 Latest concerns in regard to the excessive consumption of fossil fuels and the resultant environmental burdens have drawn people' attention towards renewable energies, such as solar, wind, hydropower, etc. Importantly, harvesting of these intermittent energies also needs the development of rechargeable batteries for temporary storage. However, one may see that the current LIB technology is still not satisfactory with respect to the ever-growing demands for scalable and economic electricity storage in both stationary and mobile vehicle applications. More efforts are still needed to create advanced electrode materials with higher energy and power densities.
Today, the most common anode material used in LIBs is graphite with a capacity of 372 mA h g−1.4 Other potential anode materials, like various metals, silicon, phosphorus, sulphur, metal oxides, as well as their composites, have been investigated and drawn attention due to their high theoretical capacities.5–14 However, challenges related to these high-capacity anodes (associated with their poor cycling and rate performances) still exist; these are caused by the poor electrical conductivity and breakage of electrode materials due to the large volume changes during cycling. Over the last 5 years, a new class of LIB anode materials, i.e. inorganic two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and their composites, have shown promising performances with high capacities, impressive cycling stabilities and high-rate capabilities.15 These TMDC materials have a typical layered structure with 2D crystals stacked together by weak van der Waals forces, making them favourable electrode candidates in LIBs or sodium ion batteries (SIBs) in view of these peculiar structural features. Although exciting progress has been achieved in this field, we note that the reported TMDC-based battery performances are still considerably varying, indicating that there are still many unknown factors and mechanisms to be uncovered. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of electrochemical performance and regarded material degradation for the TMDC-based anodes, particularly at the microscopic or even atomic levels, is critical for the rational design of high-performance and reliable batteries. For instance, cutting-edge in situ high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques allow one to directly study the structural evolution of an individual nanostructured electrode during charging and discharging at atomic or near-atomic resolutions and in real time, providing a powerful tool for in-depth electrode evaluation.
According to the material dimensionality, for a battery electrode, the architectonic blocks can be classified into 0D, 1D and 2D morphologies. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, 0D structures (like nanoparticles of elemental substances or oxides) possess large surface areas but they usually exhibit low thermal and electrochemical stabilities. Typical 1D structures (like nanotubes and nanowires) produced via oriented growth are highly crystalline, but their specific surface areas and porosity properties are difficult to tune in a wide range. Whereas 2D structures (nanosheets) often have spacious exposed surfaces and specific facets. It is much easier to engineer the textural and porosity properties of the latter nanostructures due to their layered nature; thus their exposed surface area and porosity can be adjusted via different ways, such as enlarging interlayer distances (i.e. slit-shaped pores), and stress-caused layer rolling and distortions. All such structural modifications could be achieved via hetero-2D layer hybridization or chemical doping. Thus, the 2D nanostructured electrodes with larger and highly active spaces and sites provide greater opportunities for energy storage applications than 0D and 1D nanostructures. Furthermore, they are ideal nanoarchitectonic blocks for building electrodes with fast Li/Na storage; the latter requires high stability, large active surface areas and shortened open paths for Li/Na insertion/deinsertion.
This review highlights the recent advances in the field of hybrid 2D TMDC materials used in LIBs, emerging SIBs and other rechargeable batteries. We will firstly introduce the progress on a large-scale and economic production of graphenes, 2D TMDC materials, and their composites, particularly, the 2D–2D TMDC–graphene composites. Then, considerable attention will be paid to the remarkable results documented for these hybrid 2D layered materials in LIB, SIB and other rechargeable battery applications. To get an in-depth understanding of battery performances and the key factors associated with them, we will then discuss their electrochemical energy storage pathways and mechanisms. Four classified themes will be discussed in detail: (i) intercalation/de-intercalation mechanisms, (ii) alloying/de-alloying mechanisms, (iii) conversion storage mechanisms, and (iv) surface capacitive adsorption/desorption mechanism. In addition, by utilizing advanced in situ TEM and STEM techniques, important advances have been achieved in the direct observation of insertion/de-insertion processes, surface energy storage, strain changes, volume variations, and synergistic-effects during charging/discharging, all unveiling the atomic-scale ion storage/release mechanisms.
2. Fabrication of 2D layered nanomaterials and their hybrids
2D few-layered materials, when carefully tailored, are considered to be promising in rechargeable battery anode and cathode applications; their range includes but not limited to graphene, MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, WSe2, SnS2, VS2, etc. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have predicted the existence of over 50 stable single-layered 2D few-layered TMDC compounds with a formula of MX2 (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, and W; X = O, S, Se, and Te).16 However, the battery performances of these TMDC materials, especially in regard to their rate abilities and cycling life, are still not sufficient for practical applications. To overcome such problems, hybridization of different 2D layered materials has been found to remarkably improve the performances, especially for the hybrids based on graphene and other 2D layered materials. This is because there is a notable in-plane lattice mismatch existing in these hybridized 2D–2D composites, which leads to the formation of layer distortions, void/pore structures and a resultant large number of exposed active sites (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Illustration of the unit cells for 2D crystals (left) and comparison of their in-plane lattice constants (right table). The lattice constants of the 2D crystals shown here are adopted from their bulk data directly (ref. 33–40). A lattice mismatch is normalized to graphene. 
In this part, we will present an overview of the experimental syntheses of 2D layered nanostructures and their hybrids with 0D, 1D and 2D nanomaterials. Numerous scalable preparation methods developed in recent 5 years for obtaining 2D layered “nanoinorganics” and their hybrids, including top-down chemical and physical exfoliation strategies from bulk materials, bottom-up hydrothermal and CVD growth, thermal reactions, etc. are described and summarized. We will also discuss the current challenges toward the massive, efficient and high-yield production of uniform monolayer/few-layered 2D nanosheets using all mentioned preparation techniques and the possible breakthroughs which are awaited in this field.
2.1 Graphene and doped graphene materials
The synthesis approaches and properties of graphene or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been reviewed in great detail in many previous articles, and therefore herein we only present a brief overview of the methods for obtaining few-layered graphene and doped graphene materials.
Mechanical exfoliation is the first method which has led to the isolation of high-quality, single- and few-layered graphene sheets which then can be placed on substrates. This so-called “Scotch-tape” technique is able to provide a decent sample size and quantity for research studies.17 While the interest on graphene materials is still increasing, various top-down18 and bottom-up19 methods to obtain few-layered graphene have been developed, including Hummer's chemical exfoliation, liquid-phase exfoliation, chemical intercalation–exfoliation, electrochemical exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth, organic synthesis, etc. Among them, the scalable and industrial fabrication methods of few layered graphenes for battery applications have mainly been limited to the top-down exfoliation methods, including chemical and physical exfoliations. Chemical exfoliations, such as Hummers' and modified Hummer's methods for the preparation of GO, rely on using violent oxidative reagents for the functionalization of graphite and its exfoliation to form GO aqueous suspensions under stirring or sonication.20–22 Ball milling of graphite in a dry ice was also reported to produce few-layered graphene sheets.23,24 Many alkali metals, like K,25–29 Rb,25,26 Cs,25,26 Li,30 Ca30 and Li alkylate31 as well as interhalogen compounds, like ICl and IBr,32 can be intercalated within graphite interlayers to form stable intercalated graphites (IGs). Further treatment of these IGs with water or other reactive solvents yields exfoliated graphene sheets. Lately, inorganic acid and salts that contain SO42− units, such as H2SO4, (NH4)2SO4, Na2SO4, K2SO4, have also been found to be easily intercalated into graphite cathode interlayers toward further exfoliations.41,42 An important advantage of such exfoliation is that the products are usually very thin (1–3 atomic layers). After reduction, the residual functional groups and introduced in-plane defects in rGO become beneficial for battery, supercapacitor and catalysis applications. However, this method suffers from poor yields, heavy pollutions, complicated post-cleaning steps, and severe damage of graphene structures.32 Moreover, to date, the technique of chemical exfoliation has mainly been limited to the fabrication of graphene materials; successful efforts to extend this method toward the fabrication of other 2D layered systems, especially TMDC nanomaterials, have seldom been reported.
Physical exfoliation is thought to be more suitable for large-scale production of few-layered graphenes, and thus it has received much more attention. With the assistance of external mechanical forces (sonication, shear, ball milling, etc.) and suitable solvents, this technique can yield few-layered graphene nanosheet suspensions. However, the efficiency of the related processes is still low, which also need the involvement of a large amount of organic solvents.
Doped graphenes refer to the graphene-based materials having heteroatom-carbon bonds after chemical doping.43 Introducing one or multiple heteroatoms, e.g. B, N, P, and S, into a graphene network induces atomic charge density and/or spin density redistribution, partly breaks perfect honeycomb-like lattices, and causes 2D structure distortions. Such doping is beneficial to widen the graphene interlayer distance and provides a larger slit tunnel for ion transport. It also creates more exposed active sites. Both pyrrolic and thiophenic 5-member-rings cause the stress and curving of graphene layers, similar to the cases of fullerenes. For P atoms, unlike for the cases of N- and S-doping, it is unfavourable to form the conjugated P–C bonds. Thus, replacing the C atom with the P atom in a graphene layer and forming the sp3-hybridized P–C bonds introduce structural stresses and curving of graphene backbones, leading to the formation of enlarged graphene interlayer distances, see Fig. 2.

Theoretical simulations have predicted that all these heteroatom-doping sites can store more and different Li+/Na+ ions, and can result in higher overall battery capacities. Most of the reported N-, P-, and S-doped graphenes show maximum LIB capacities >1000 mA h g−1.44 Using different doping methods, the achieved doping degrees usually range from ∼1 to ∼16 at% for N,45–56 <1 to ∼5 at% for S,57–61 and ∼1 to ∼7 at% for P.62–65 Furthermore, the formed doped structures can vary, especially in the case of N-doping.66 However, the doping route toward improving the battery capacity is rather challenging due to the fact that doping degrees for graphene are low and have certain limitations,67,68e.g. both experimental and theoretical simulations have predicted that the upper doping level of N in graphene is around 33.3 at% (keeping in mind graphene structural integrity and stability).67 Doping with non-conjugated hetero-atoms, like P atoms, is accompanied by loss of other important properties, such as electrical conductivity and stability. Furthermore, rGO and doped graphene materials are prone to quick capacity fading and poor rate performances, in addition they are still rather expensive.
2.2 Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
Similar to graphene, TMDC materials can also be obtained via top-down exfoliation and bottom-up growth. And these methods may also decently work to fabricate 2D–2D hybrid materials (as will be discussed in Section 2.4).
Exfoliation of bulk layered materials is a typical top-down method that is most commonly used for the massive production of few-layered 2D TMDC nanosheets. Recent in situ TEM experiments have revealed that a specific surface energy of ∼0.11 N m−1 needs to be overcome during MoS2 mechanical exfoliation.72 Based on the nature of exfoliation techniques and obtained products, most of the developed methods for TMDC exfoliations belong to the physical exfoliation protocol. Liquid exfoliation can yield few-layered nanosheet suspensions with the assistance of suitable solvents and mechanical forces (Fig. 3a), including sonication, shear, ball milling, etc.15,69,73,74 Besides, some alkali metals (Li, Na and K)75,76 and their organometallic (ML, M = Li, Na, K; L = n-butyl, naphthyl, etc.) compounds71,77–80 can be spontaneously intercalated into weakly stacked planes to expand layered materials, while the electrons are transferred from negatively charged organic groups to TMDC layers (Fig. 3g and h). Further treatment of such materials with reactive solvents results in an effective exfoliation of the layers, as has been documented for MoS2, WS2, etc.71,81 It is noted that the ground state phase of some TMDCs (2H) changes into the metastable 1T phase due to the electron transfer during intercalation, which is very different from the case of graphene exfoliations.79,80 Electrochemical intercalation of Li ions has been recently utilized to fabricate MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets after material incorporation into a coin cell,11,82Fig. 3e and f. Cui's group has prepared a 1T-MoS2 phase through the electrochemical intercalation of Li+ ions into the 2H-MoS2 (Fig. 10a).70,83 In their synthesis, an edge-terminated MoS2 nanofilm and a piece of Li foil have been assembled into a pouch battery cell. As seen in the galvanostatic discharge curve (Fig. 3h), by tuning the Li intercalation potential, a controlled semiconducting 2H to metallic 1T phase transition and expansion of the van der Waals gap have been realized. This is an effective approach for optimizing the catalytic/electrochemical activity.84 A SO42− anion, which has been used for graphite electrochemical exfoliations,32,42 is also found to be effective for bulk MoS2 exfoliations (Fig. 3b–d).85

Hydrothermal growth is another efficient method to obtain few-layered TMDC materials. To date, various types of TMDC precursors have been developed for such growth. They include: (1) a single precursor that simultaneously contains the required metal and chalcogen components, like (NH4)2MoS4 and (NH4)2WS4; (2) binary precursors. For this type of precursor, metal and chalcogen components are provided by different compounds, e.g. for the hydrothermal growth of MoS2, Mo can be provided by Na2MoO4, MoO3, MoCl6, (NH4)6Mo7O24, etc., while organic sulfides, like thiourea, thioacetamide and L-cysteine can serve as the S source. Similarly, WCl6, SnCl4, SnCl2 and K2SnO3 have also been found to be useful precursors for the synthesis of WS2, SnS2 and SnS, respectively, see Tables 3 and 4 for details.
2.3 2D–0D and 2D–1D hybrid materials
Many 0D nanoparticles and 1D nano-wires/rods/belts made of elemental substances (P, S, Si, Sn, Ge, Co, etc.) and oxides (NiO, CuO, CoO, Co3O4, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, SnO, SnO2, MnO2, etc.)86,87 can be loaded into graphene or other 2D matrices to form 2D–0D and 2D–1D hybrid electrode materials. More details related to these types of hybrids can be found in other reviews covering the topics of graphene–metal oxide and graphene–elemental substance composites and their versatile applications, including LIBs.8,88–90 Both elemental substances and oxides are able to offer high gravimetric capacities, most of which are much larger than that of commercial graphite. They additionally show more positive lithium insertion and extraction voltages. The major concern related to these classes of 0D and 1D architectures is their unsatisfactory cycling performances, largely related to the enormous volume changes during ion intercalations and desertions. Another problem is their relatively low electrical conductivity, which usually leads to poor rate properties. An appropriate design of 2D–0D/1D hybrid structures can improve their electrochemical properties, including cycling and high-rate performances, compared with their bulk counterparts. Recent progress in the design of these 2D–0D/1D hybrid structures has relied on interface chemistry engineering between the matrix and loaded particles, e.g. better cycling stabilities have been observed in graphene/graphite–phosphorous composite anodes in which P nanoparticles are anchored to graphene/graphite due to chemical bondings.91,92
2.4 2D–2D hybrid layered materials

Preparation methods. 
In this subsection, we discuss on hybrid 2D–2D materials composed of graphene and TMDC nanosheets. To obtain the 2D–2D nanosheet composites, a straightforward way (1) is as follows: firstly, the fabrication of different nanosheet suspensions via exfoliations is separately accomplished, and then different nanosheet suspensions are mixed together at a specific ratio. After separation (filtering, centrifugation, etc.) and post treatment (annealing, chemical reduction, etc.), the aimed 2D layered composites are created (Fig. 4). (2) Another efficient and frequently adopted method is the hydrothermal growth of layered TMDC nanosheets on GO surfaces; this has been applied for the preparation of TMDC–rGO 2D–2D composites (Fig. 5). Compared to the exfoliation-mixing method, the 2D–2D layered material composites via the hydrothermal growth may be prepared with a higher yield. They contain various product morphologies. However, the latter method requires relatively high energy consumption, is of high cost and may hardly be utilized for continuous and scalable industrial fabrication.

The exfoliation method, as described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, is a generally applicable technique for most of the 2D layered materials; this is also very convenient for the preparation of 2D–2D hybrids. The advantage of this method is its possibility to well maintain the in-plane structural integrity of 2D nanosheets, and thus no further recovery steps are required for chemically exfoliated products. This technique is also adaptive to scalable production; this greatly reduces the fabrication cost. However, liquid-phase exfoliated 2D nanosheet products are usually much thicker than those after chemical exfoliation, and may be contaminated by solvents.32 By contrast, the usage of non-oxidative intercalation methods produces high-quality pristine clean 2D nanosheets. This method is scalable, more efficient and eco-friendly and gives much higher yields than the liquid-exfoliation technique. However, the products are usually thick, a common problem for physical exfoliation methods too. Proper uniform mixing of different components is another concern in regard to this strategy.
Alternatively, a hydrothermal growth may also be an efficient route to prepare 2D–2D composites (Fig. 5). Usually, GO colloids/suspensions are used as substrates, while TMDC precursors are introduced in the solutions. During the growth process, GO is spontaneously reduced to graphene (rGO).95 Thus, further annealing treatments are not necessary. The TMDC composition in the obtained hybrids varies in a wide range from 22 to ∼97 wt%.96,97 Compared with the exfoliation method, the 2D–2D layered composites prepared along with the hydrothermal route are featured by a high yield, varying product morphology and porosity. However, some drawbacks of the hydrothermal technique are notable, especially in relation to the problems of relatively high cost and difficulty in achieving a continuous large-scale industrial production. Very different from the structural design growing TMDCs on GO or graphene surfaces, our group has recently developed a novel simple route to fabricate a MoS2–C composite with a reversed structure (Fig. 5e). We have firstly grown porous C precursors (MOFs) on the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet surfaces in solutions, and then convert the precursor shells to a porous C layer under thermal annealing. Thus, the obtained MoS2–C composite has a reversed structure: a core made of MoS2 nanosheets and the shells made of porous C. Such a structure is beneficial for building an ultimate 3D electron-conducting network in a composite, as well as for TMDC component protection.98
Besides exfoliation and hydrothermal pathways, other methods, like CVD growth and thermal reactions, have also been recently developed. Cao et al. have reported a thermal decomposition method to grow MoS2 nanoflakes on CVD-derived 3D graphene sheets. The formed MoS2 flakes show a lateral size of less than 100 nm. They exhibit decent Li storage performances, comparable to those of the MoS2–rGO composites obtained via exfoliation and hydrothermal growth.99 Choi et al. have used ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of GO, PS nanospheres and (NH4)2MoS4/water suspension at 800 °C to directly fabricate the MoS2–graphene microsphere-like composites with opened pores.100 Luo et al. have proposed a two-step way to grow a SnS2–rGO composite, demonstrating another possible route toward TMDC–graphene hybrids. In the case of SnS2–rGO composite preparation, SnO2 particles (i.e. a precursor of SnS2) have firstly been decorated on GO during hydrolysis reactions. Then, the received SnO2–GO phase has been annealed in H2S to generate the final composite.103 The sulfurization process can also be conducted under ambient conditions under H2S bubbling if a hydroperoxostannate (Sn(OOH)6) bonded GO is used instead, as described in ref. 104. This method may also be utilized for the synthesis of other TMDC–graphene 2D–2D composites.


Structural features and advantages of 2D–2D composites. 
In TMDC–graphene composites, the role of graphene is not just providing electron transport networks. Due to the lattice mismatch and weak interactions between graphene (or doped graphene) and TMDC layers in a composite, the van der Waals force-induced “heterostacking” of the components is not as perfect as in bulk layered materials. This “imperfect” stacking would unavoidably cause porous structures in the formed hybrids. Besides, a thin 2D layer can be rolled and distorted during the exfoliation, mixing, or solution growth steps, and this forms cylinder-shaped or irregular pores,19,105–107e.g. after mixing and reducing the exfoliated MoS2 and GO nanosheets, there are meso- and macropores (2–60 nm) created in a MoS2–rGO architecture with a specific surface area of up to 202 m2 g−1, which is much larger than that of MoS2 nanosheets (42 m2 g−1),94 see in Fig. 4. Furthermore, the interlayer spaces can be tuned up to ∼1 nm for MoS2 sheets and up to 0.66 nm for WS2 using hydrothermal growth methods, while the lateral sizes can be controlled to become less than 100 nm.8,108,109 Another important aspect of using TMDC composites for rechargeable batteries is the nearly negligible volumetric changes of TMDCs under lithiation/de-lithiation; e.g. there is only ∼5% lattice expansion in the MoS2c- and a-directions caused by Li intercalation, compared with over 400% and 80% expansions for Si and S particles, respectively.110,111 This is an important advantage of the TMDC-based anodes giving them excellent cycling stability.
The presence of the regarded open pores in the composite structures (would be immersed with electrolytes after assembling into batteries) facilitates several effects: (1) greatly shorten ion diffusion path between electrolytes and active sites, which favours rapid Li or Na ion intercalations and extractions. The strategy of nanostructuring any active components and establishing these nanosized electrolyte-accessible tunnels is crucial for the development of next generation super-rapid and high-capacity rechargeable batteries112,113 although the increased specific surface area may also cause the formation of larger SEI interlayers and induce an increased irreversible battery capacity loss during the first charge/discharge cycle.114 (2) Buffering the volumetric changes of the anode materials during ion intercalations/desertions and electrochemical reactions. Since considerable void spaces (or those filled with liquid electrolytes) are constructed between the composite hetero-layers, volumetric changes caused by working ions during charging/discharging processes can be effectively buffered. This characteristic, combined with the low volumetric change nature of the TMDC components, is very important for prolonging a rechargeable battery cycling life.

3 Battery performances
3.1 Thermodynamic and kinetic issues
It is known that commercially used graphite anode materials are featured by their cyclic stability and excellent rate capability.4 Since rGO materials usually contain many structural defects and residual functional groups, their reported capacities are usually higher than those of graphite, ranging from 540 to 1054 mA h g−1.4,115,116 However, these loosely stacked graphene layers usually face a low packing density problem, resulting in low volumetric energy density that is unfavourable for portable electronic applications.1 Other problems, such as large capacity fading and high cost of the materials, also restrict the commercialization.
The battery properties of sole TMDC materials have been investigated theoretically and experimentally, e.g. bulk- or micro-/nano-MoS2, as the typical TMDC material, shows an enhanced theoretical (669 mA h g−1)117,118 and experimental (up to ∼900 mA h g−1)119–123 Li storage capacity compared to a graphite anode. Reversible Li ion intercalation into the bulk MoS2 layers takes place from 3.0 through 1.1 V (vs. Li/Li+) during the discharging process, as shown in eqn (1) of Table 1. In a potential window of ∼1.1 and ∼0.6 V, the intercalated LixMoS2 undergoes the reversible transformation from LixMoS2 to Li2S and metallic Mo. The irreversibility of TMDC anodes mainly comes from the conversions between Li2S and S during the first cycle.124 In SIB applications, MoS2 shows a theoretical capacity of 146 mA h g−1 during Na ion intercalations at 3.2 to ∼0.8 V (vs. Na/Na+),125 and a theoretical capacity of 425 mA h g−1 during further electrochemical reactions between NaxMoS2 and Mo + Na2S in a potential window of ∼0.8 V to <0.4 V (Table 2). Such a high theoretical SIB capacity of MoS2 (571 mA h g−1) proves its superiority compared to a conventional graphite anode (<35 mA h g−1)126,127 and an expanded graphite anode (284 mA h g−1).128 Recent in situ experiments have shown that a 2H phase of MoS2 changes into the 1T phase with the Li+/Na+ ions occupying the interlayer S–S tetrahedron sites during the initial intercalation stage.129,130

The rate performances of rechargeable batteries are highly dependent on the kinetics of cation transport in solid state electrodes. An ion flux in the solid follows Fick's law:  here J is the cation ion flux, dC/dX is the concentration gradient of the ions and D is the diffusion coefficient. Thus the cation transport equation becomes:  andD = Ae−Ea/kTbased on the Arrhenius equation, where Ea is the diffusion energy barrier, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and A is a pre-exponential factor.
Thus, at a given temperature, cation transport in a solid electrode is dependent on the ion concentration gradient and the diffusion energy barrier of ions in a solid. Li et al. have performed DFT calculations and found that the energy barrier Ea for Li diffusion on MoS2 monolayer sites is 0.21 eV, which is much lower than that in the MoS2 bilayer (0.32 eV) and bulk MoS2 (0.49 eV).131 The measured Li diffusion coefficients in MoS2 nanosheets are located in a range of 10−12 to 10−11 cm2 s−1.132 Lower diffusion barriers, as well as higher diffusion coefficients, have also been documented for other TMDC monolayers.133–135 Thus, reducing the dimensionality or enlarging the layer distance of layered electrode materials is helpful to enhance the diffusion of cations. The reported diffusion coefficient of Li ions in graphite is ∼10−10 cm2 s−1,136 which is much larger than that of bulk/2D MoS2.137 Further introduction of structural disorders and hetero-atom dopants into graphene can further boost the Li diffusion coefficients.52 Based on these facts, we can infer that a design of hybridized 2D–2D TMDC composites is beneficial for the acceleration of cation transport in the electrodes, and thus will improve the rate performance of the batteries.
Numerous TMDC materials, including MoS2 and MoSe2, have also been explored for SIB applications.73,138 A hydrothermally grown MoS2 usually shows better capacity, rate and cycling properties due to the enlarged interlayer distances of the products. This characteristic is advantageous for SIBs. The recent results for MoS2 nanomaterials in Na ion batteries highlight the important progress in this direction; the cycling life for the battery has been prolonged for over 1500 cycles, revealing bright perspective for the future of these TMDC phases in low-cost and stable SIB applications.139
3.2 LIB performances of 2D–2D composites
As analysed in the previous section, many advantages of using 2D–2D TMDC–graphene composites for Li ion storage can be envisioned, especially because of their high capacities, cycling stability and rate capabilities. The reversible LIB specific capacity of >1500 mA h g−1 has been reported for MoS2–graphene composites.143 There are only a few other electrode materials having higher theoretical capacity, such as silicon (4200 mA h g−1)144 and sulphur (1672 mA h g−1).1 However, while comprehensively comparing their cycling life, rate capability and cost, TMDC–graphene hybrid anodes still look preferential.
After incorporation of the MoS2 component into a graphene matrix, e.g. at a low content of 55 wt%, the reversible LIB capacity of the composite has remarkably enhanced to over 915 mA h g−1 at a current density of 500 mA g−1.140 The Coulombic efficiency has increased from initially 67.8% to >97% after the third cycle. It is noticeable that having an ultrahigh current density, up to 20 A g−1 in the anode rate tests, this MoS2–rGO composite has still retained ca. a half capacity value compared to that at 0.5 A g−1 (see Fig. 6a–c). Such impressive cyclic and rate performances of the MoS2–graphene composites are explained with respect to their textural features. As shown in Fig. 6g, meso- and macro-pore-associated hysteresis loops are evident in the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the MoS2–graphene hybrids along with the increased SSAs.142 Due to the advantages of the TMDC–graphene composites discussed in the previous section, one can expect an excellent performance of these materials in a battery. Generally, under a moderate current density of 100 mA g−1, the reported reversible LIB capacities of MoS2–graphene materials with different compositions are in a range of ∼600–1546 mA h g−1 (Table 3), and these are influenced by the TMDC component, content and preparation methods. The state-of-art hybrid anodes made of MoS2 and rGO exhibit almost no capacity degenerations (vs. 2nd discharge capacities) after >100 cyclic tests with high Coulombic efficiency throughout cycling.108,124,140,146,147 This means that the formed SEI interlayers during the first cycle are considerably stable and their further formations are limited. For WS2 and other TMDC–graphene composites, Lee et al. have reported the hydrothermal growth of an N-doped graphene–WS2 composite with 76.37 wt% WS2. This shows a high specific capacity of 905 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, impressive rate capability (only 20% reduction with the increase of current density from 0.1 to 5 A g−1), and low average capacity fading per cycle of 0.08% over 100 cycles.141 The high rate capability for a WS2–graphene composite has also been tested at the ultra-large current density of 14 A g−1. It has been shown that ∼296 mA h g−1 capacity can be maintained compared with a value of 647 mA h g−1 at 0.35 A g−1, further confirming the good rate performance for such anodes (Fig. 6d–f).109 However, for the SnS2-based composites, it is more challenging to maintain their capacities during cyclic tests; usually, they exhibit a much larger capacity loss during the first discharge/charge cycle (most of the reported SnS2–graphene composites have shown ∼1/2–2/3 irreversible capacity decay at that cycle),97,103,148–152e.g. Jiang et al. have reported on the hydrothermal growth of a SnS2–rGO composite with the main pore diameter of 18 nm and the SSA value of 47 m2 g−1 which have then been employed for LIB investigations. The SnS2–rGO composite displays an initial discharge capacity of 1740 mA h g−1, and reversible capacities of ∼600 and 504 mA h g−1 at the 2nd and 200th cycles under a current density of 250 mA g−1, see Fig. 6h and i. Further studies to tackle such an irreversible capacity decay mechanism for the SnS2-based composites during the first charge/discharge (that may be possibly due to the irreversible alloying and de-alloying between Li and Sn particles) are necessary. Very recently, some new 2D TMDCs/graphene hybrids, such as MoS2–3D graphene,153 MoS2–PPY–rGO,154 MoS2–graphene (84 wt%),155 VS2–graphene (96.1 wt%),156 have been reported to show excellent electrochemical performances toward lithium storage.

3.3 SIB performances of 2D–2D composites
Lately, we have evidenced the rise of tailored 2D layered material composites in SIB anode explorations, which is still a hot topic presenting many chances and challenges. While chemistry of Na is similar to Li, batteries working on Na+ ions would certainly afford a lower cost. A series of TMDC materials or their graphene hybrids, including MoS2,93,157,158 WS2,159 SnS145 and SnS2,104,160,161 have been investigated for SIB applications. Herein we summarize the main SIB properties of the TMDC–graphene composites developed in recent years in Table 4. The main challenge of SIBs is their poor cycling properties and respective low capacity. A possible reason for this is the conversion between the metal species, like Mo, and Na2S to MoS2 during a discharge process at a potential <0.4 V vs. Na/Na+ (Table 2), which may not be totally reversible and cause quick capacity degeneration during cycling.139,158 The detailed mechanism studies are summarized in Section 4.
Singh et al. have reported on the preparation of a flexible MoS2–graphene composite paper through mechanical mixing of GO and chlorosulfonic acid-exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets at different mass ratios. The Na-ion battery tests show the best capacity of 218 mA h g−1 at a constant current density of 25 mA g−1 with a Coulombic efficiency of ∼99% after 20 cycles.93 A MoS2 phase with the interlayer spacings expanded during lithiation can also be adopted to prepare the composites with graphene for SIB applications.157 Such a composite consisting of 77 wt% MoS2 is able to deliver a SIB capacity of 313 mA h g−1 over 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1, i.e. with the capacity retention of 81%. More recently, a MoS2–C nanocomposite with the 66.7 wt% MoS2 component obtained via a hydrothermal method has displayed an improved SIB capacity of 400 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles at 670 mA g−1, as well as good rate capability at a current density up to 1.34 A g−1 (390 mA h g−1).162 The MoS2–graphene microsphere-like composite reported by Choi et al. and prepared using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis has demonstrated a relatively high and stable SIB capacity of 480 and 322 mA h g−1 when cycled at 0.2 and 1.5 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 7d–f).100 Furthermore, by choosing the working voltage range in 0.4–3 V that avoids the electrochemical reaction step (step 2, Table 2), the cyclic performances for SIBs have been remarkably improved (without loss after 1500 cycles),139 see Fig. 7a–c. The role of the hetero-interface in composites is also starting to attract full attention. Xie et al. have investigated the correlations between the hetero-interfacial areas of the MoS2–rGO composite and the resultant SIB capacities, and have documented that an improved Na+ ion storage capacity can be achieved through increasing the hetero-interfacial area. The mechanism behind such a phenomenon may be related to the ability to adsorb more Na+ ions in these hetero-interfacial regions.163 And interestingly, such an interfacial effect also boosts the research on pseudocapacitive Na ion intercalation/deintercalation between TiO2–graphene interfaces. This is because effective channels with a much lower ion diffusion energy barrier can be constructed between the TiO2–graphene interfaces.164

WS2– and MoSe2–rGO 2D–2D composites exhibit comparable and reversible SIB capacities as MoS2–rGO composites do. They delivered reversible capacities of 594 and ∼440 mA h g−1 after the second cycles at 20 and 200 mA g−1, respectively.138,159 And interestingly, SnS2 and SnS-based 2D–2D composites show the best reversible capacities among all the TMDC composite materials. Based on the report of Zhou et al., a reversible capacity of up to 940 mA h g−1 (at 30 mA g−1) may be achieved for a SnS–graphene composite, which is comparable to the LIB capacities of many TMDC composite systems, see Fig. 7g–i. The SnS component in this SnS–rGO composite is converted from SnS2 nanosheets through a calcination treatment at 600 °C.145 The origin of such impressive high capacities of SnS and SnS2-based composites is derived from their multiple-structural-phase transformation mechanism: e.g. SnS transforms from orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn and then to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn, while the SnS2 evolves from hexagonal-SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn and then to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn during discharging. The final alloying processes provide an additional capacity of 847 mA h g−1 besides the intercalation capacities.165
In spite of the considerable progress witnessed in the field of 2D TMDC-based electrodes for LIBs/SIBs,166–168 there remain fundamental drawbacks, including a low packing density (<0.5 g cm−3) and thus low volumetric capacity due to the ultrahigh surface areas. In order to increase the mass loading of the active materials, some efforts have been made. For example, many novel structures, such as 3D graphenes,169 or sandwiched hybrid structures,170,171 and doped 3D graphene foams,172 have successfully been fabricated.
3.4 MIB performances
In addition to LIB and SIB applications, other rechargeable battery types, like magnesium ion batteries (MIBs) that rely on Mg2+ ion shuttling between the anode and the cathode have also been reported. Many potential advantages of MIBs, such as the abilities to deliver more electrons, less volumetric/structural changes during charge/discharge processes (less balanced cations in a given electrode material are needed), better reversibility, higher working potential, and more abundant Mg resources, make them attractive for the design of secondary batteries.173 However, due to slow diffusion rates of highly polarized divalent Mg ions in a solid, bulk graphite and TMDCs are unsuitable for MIB anode materials.174 This problem can be solved if their interlayer spacings are efficiently engineered. The discharge MIB capacities of MoS2–rGO composites obtained through the hydrothermal growth have been reported to be ∼104 mA h−1 at 20 mA g−1.175,176 CVD grown WSe2, according to Shen's group results, can deliver a relatively high reversible capacity of 203 mA h g−1 over 160 cycles at 100 mA g−1, as well as a high rate retention of 83.5% with the current increasing from 100 to 800 mA g−1 during MIS tests,177 see Fig. 8. More recently, Liang et al. have found that the capacity of MoS2 is boosted to 75 mA h g−1 when its interlayer distance is enlarged from 0.62 nm to 1.45 nm, thus approaching the theoretical value for multi-layered MoS2 (Mg1/3MoS2, 111.6 mA h g−1).174

Commercial micrometer-scale low-cost MoS2 may undergo an electrochemically derived 2H-to-1T phase transformation, which makes it possible to reversibly store Mg2+/Li+ and Mg2+ in all-phenyl-complex (APC) electrolytes with and without Li+, respectively. For example, a MoS2/graphene composite178 can deliver a high capacity (225 mA h g−1) and superb cyclic stability in a Li+-containing APC electrolyte. Furthermore, Yao et al.179 have demonstrated that TiS2 can show excellent stability in a high areal capacity MIB cell and reveal the dendrite-free deposition behaviour of Mg under high current density (2 mA cm−2). While using some electrolytes with higher salt concentration or a wider electrochemical window, its energy density can further be enhanced, leading to new application opportunities in large-scale energy storage. These efforts represent important advancements toward TMDC-based materials usage for MIB anodes. Certainly, further improvements of the capacity and cyclic performance are needed in order to make MIBs more competitive.
3.5 Full batteries and solid batteries
All the battery performances reported above are based on the half-cell tests using metals as the counter and reference electrodes. The data obtained from the half-cell tests properly reflect the essential battery performance for a given material, and make the comparison between various electrode materials easy. However, alkali metals, including Li, Na and Mg, are excluded from commercial rechargeable battery applications due to safety issues. Thus, a search for matching counter electrodes (usually cathodes) is necessary for assembling a full battery. A MoS2–rGO composite, which shows a reversible capacity of 1240 mA h g−1 in a half-cell test at 0.1 A g−1, still delivers a comparable capacity of 1163 mA h g−1 from the 2nd cycle in a full MoS2–rGO//LiCoO2 battery at the same current density.180 The MoS2 nanoflakes grown on flexible carbon cloth are applicable for further design and fabrication of flexible LIBs. As reported by Yu et al., a film-like full LIB using MoS2–C and LiCoO2 as the anode and cathode, respectively, exhibits small capacity changes under battery bending for 45° and 60°.181 Furthermore, Gao et al. have explored the full battery performances using SnS2–rGO nanoribbons and LiCoO2 electrodes. The capacity and rate capability of the SnS2–rGO composite only show a slight decrease.182 However, the most common problem of the current full batteries using 2D hybrid TMDC anodes is the quick capacity decay. The main reason behind this is a mismatch between anode and cathode materials' optimal rates and a lack of optimized technical parameters.
In addition, in the classical secondary LIBs, SIBs and MIBs, their electrodes are immersed in liquid organic electrolytes, which are flammable, explosive and toxic. Such a battery structure creates some safety risks if used improperly. Possible solutions are the development of solid electrolytes with high cation conductivity, and design of all-solid-state rechargeable batteries. Taken the advantages of tiny thicknesses and excellent flexibility of hybrid 2D TMDC electrode materials, such directions look promising.
Chen et al. have utilized the fast Li+-ion conducting solid lithium argyrodites, i.e. Li6PS5Br, as a solid electrolyte for solid LIB fabrications. The MoS2 cathode exhibits a reversible capacity of 190 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles at 67 mA g−1 and room temperature in a voltage range of 1–3 V, and a reversible capacity of up to 270 mA h g−1 at 134 mA g−1 at 70 °C. The latter reversible capacity corresponds to 85% retention of the initial capacity after 700 cycles at 134 mA g−1.183 When ceramic Li2S–P2S5 has been used as a solid electrolyte, more stable cycling performance is achieved for both crystalline MoS2 and amorphous MoS3 (containing S22− and S2−) in all-solid-state cells, as reported by Tatsumisago's group.184,185 Many other TMDC compounds have also been explored for solid battery applications using a similar ceramic-glassy Li+/Na+-conducting electrolyte, including TiS2,186–190 SnS,191–194etc. And many novel inorganic solid electrolytes possessing very high cation conductivities have recently been discovered.195 However, strictly speaking, all these solid batteries that utilize inorganic ceramic-glassy solid electrolytes are not entirely flexible. Thus Wei et al. have fabricated ultimately flexible solid batteries using single-layered graphene and modified graphene composites as the cathodes, and poly(ethylene glycol) borate ester as the polymeric Li+ conducting electrolyte.197,198 The graphene composite displays a high mass capacity of up to 240 mA h g−1 (41% of its initial value) maintained after 100 cycles at a discharge/charge rate of 149 mA g−1, implying that the utilized depositing/printing technique is indeed rather promising.197
Although this field becomes more and more important and many achieved results are really interesting, one should still notice some existing challenges. No matter which inorganic or polymeric electrolytes are adopted, the power densities for a solid battery are still much lower compared with the classical rechargeable batteries, not to mention its high cost. With respect to polymeric solid batteries, their cycling stability and other parameters still need to be improved.
4. Microscopic mechanisms of 2D electrode nanomaterials
The design of high-performance rechargeable batteries basically relied on understanding electrochemical processes and material degradation mechanisms. Since 2010,199 a novel nanobattery assembly and a testing platform inside TEM have been designed, which allows for a direct investigation of the structural evolution of individual nanostructured electrodes under near-atomic resolution and in real time. In addition, STEM and other advanced microscopy techniques have also demonstrated their potential in not only mapping individual O atoms, but also Li and Na atoms. In this part, recent progress in the study of several important 2D layered electrode nanomaterials is summarized. The consistency between in situ and ex situ results is shown, thereby validating the new in situ testing paradigm. Comparisons between a variety of nanostructures lead to the conclusion that electrochemical reaction and mechanical degradation are material-specific, size-dependent, and geometry- and composition-sensitive. This section also aims at highlighting the past, present and future of these exciting methods which are based on the enormous advances in microscopic techniques over the last 5 years.
4.1 Intercalation/de-intercalation mechanisms
An intercalation/de-intercalation-based anode, such as that made of graphite, graphene, or MoS2, is one of the most important types for rechargeable batteries. It is necessary to get deep insights into the structure–property relationship at the nanoscale during charging–discharging. In situ nanobattery experiments inside a TEM are state-of-the-art approaches for advancing the fundamental understanding of electrochemical reactions and material degradation, which paves the way for the rational design of high-performance batteries. In this subsection, we highlight recent progress with respect to the nanoscale mechanism study on 2D electrode nanomaterials (e.g. MoS2, graphene, TiO2, carbon, and olivine NaMnPO4) through building an individual nanosheet battery device under an in situ TEM and a STEM.52,222–224 The related charging/discharging electrochemical processes and atomic-scale mechanisms are also described.
Nowadays, graphene is becoming one of the most important and promising electrodes or supports in the field of rechargeable batteries. In order to deeply understand the intercalation–deintercalation mechanisms during discharging–charging, Liu and coworkers have built an in situ TEM electrochemical setup (Fig. 9a) and studied the electrochemical behaviour of few-layer graphene nanoribbons (GNRs).196Fig. 9a shows the schematic illustration of a solid cell, which is composed of two electrodes, made of GNRs and Li, while the solid electrolyte is a naturally grown Li2O layer.225–227 When a potential of −2 V has been applied between the GNR and Li, lithiation takes place (Fig. 9b and c). As seen from Fig. 9d and e, a nanocrystalline Li oxide layer covers the surfaces and edges of the GNRs upon lithiation, while most Li2O is removed upon delithiation, indicating that the lithiation/delithiation processes occurred mainly at surfaces. It also suggests the possible formation of a stable SEI layer on the graphene surfaces. It is notable that the lithiated GNRs exhibit mechanical robustness during both tension and compression tests (Fig. 9f), in contrast to the lithiation-induced embrittlement of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). As shown in Fig. 9g, due to the unconfined stacking of planar carbon layers in GNRs, a weak coupling between the intralayer and interlayer deformations takes place, thus leading to the ease of insertion/deinsertion of Li+ ions into the graphene layers. By contrast, because of the cylinder-like confinement in CNTs, large tensile hoop stresses are generated within closed C layers after Li-insertion, causing a brittle fracture. These results clearly show that the mechanically robust graphene with its enormous surface area is indeed a superior material for LIBs, either as an active material or as a stable scaffold.

Among all members of the graphene family, N-doped graphene (GN) is expected to be a good candidate as an anode material, because of its high electrical conductivity, fast electron transport, flexible porous structures, numerous lithium storage sites and short Li+ diffusion distances.46,47,228–231 For example, GN has been found to possess higher rate capability and capacity for lithium storage than pure graphene. However, there is a lack of direct experimental evidence and fundamental understanding of the storage mechanisms at the atomic scale. Through building an in situ nanobattery inside a TEM in our lab (Fig. 9h–l), the atomistic insights into the GN energy storage have been revealed; the lithiation process on edges and basal planes has directly been visualized.52 Upon lithiation (Fig. 9j–f), the discharging process occurs along the GN edges, being initiated from the edge to the center. Note that the main composition of the as-formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is identified to be Li2O. There is a 16.6% expansion induced by lithium intercalation into the graphene layers after lithiation, smaller than that for pure graphene along the d0002 direction (7.2% increase). This indicates that more loose and void spaces between GN layers, preferable for ultrafast lithium storage, have been formed. In addition, the pyrrolic N “hole” defect and the perturbed solid–electrolyte–interface configurations have been observed, and charge transfer states for three N-existing forms have also been investigated by first-principles DFT calculations. Pyrrolic and pyridinic defect structure (N2-GN and N3-GN) sites are found to be energetically more favourable for Li atom adsorption, unlike the case of graphite (Li+ ions prefer to occupy the centers of C6 rings, Fig. 9m and n).
Recently, 2D structured MoS2 and its hybrids have drawn significant attention of the battery community because they allow for a design of operational devices with minor safety concerns. As mentioned in Section 2.1, there are two phases of MoS2: semiconducting 2H and metallic IT. Bai's group has demonstrated the electrochemical dynamic atomistic process of MoS2 nanosheet lithiation using in situ TEM.129 As shown in the time-lapse TEM images (Fig. 10a–g), morphological evolution of a MoS2 nanosheet during the first Li-ion intercalation is nicely seen. Based on the detailed HRTEM interface information and the corresponding simulations (insets in Fig. 10e and g), upon lithiation, trigonal prismatic 2H-MoS2 has been confirmed to change into the octahedral (1T) phase, while Li+ ions occupy the interlayer S–S tetrahedron sites in the 1T-LiMoS2. As a result of such electron–lattice interactions, pseudoperiodic structural modulation composed of polytype superlattices has been formed. In addition, via checking the dynamic phase boundary movement, these authors have also testified the shear mechanism for the 2H–1T phase transition. Similarly, Yu and Wang et al. have studied the controversial phase transition from 2H to 1T MoS2 upon electrochemical Na intercalation at the atomic scale by using aberration-corrected STEM (Fig. 10h–j).130 They have evidenced the phase changes of products with different contents of Na ions intercalated, and found that x = 1.5 in NaxMoS2 is a critical concentration for the reversibility of the structural evolution. Gao et al.232 have also investigated the Na intercalation process of MoS2 by using in situ TEM in real-time; an ∼2 nm thick phase boundary has been found. Different from Li+ insertion, a sluggish kinetics for Na+ intercalation has been observed (<10 nm s−1 of the velocity of the phase boundary, one order of magnitude slower than that of lithium diffusion). Therefore, these findings should enrich the knowledge of phase transitions and intercalation chemistry in MoS2.

Very recently, Chhowalla and coworkers (Fig. 10k) have shown that 2D metallic 1T-MoS2 nanosheets can act as excellent supercapacitor electrode materials. These have been proven to be electrochemically intercalated by various ions, such as H+, Li+, Na+ and K+, with an extraordinary efficiency.233 Ultrahigh capacitance values ranging from ∼400 to ∼700 F cm−3, Columbic efficiencies at the excess of 95%, and stability over 5000 cycles have been achieved in a variety of aqueous electrolytes. Via refined X-ray diffraction analysis, the material hydrophilicity and high electrical conductivity, as well as its ability to be dynamically expanded and intercalated by various ions, have been concluded to play a role in the electrochemistry of 1T MoS2 layers. These results shed new light on the future material design and applications of 2D MoS2 and its hybrids in many areas.
4.2 Alloying/de-alloying mechanisms
As was pointed out, both lithiation and sodiation of SnS and SnS2 2D materials evolve alloying processes. Many other high-capacity materials also rely on the alloying/de-alloying mechanism to realize reversible Li+/Na+ storage, such as Si,234 Sn, P, S, and Ge. Although exhibiting impressive high capacity via incorporating a high concentration of Li+/Na+ ions, anode materials based on the alloying/de-alloying mechanism usually suffer from a short cycle life due to extreme volumetric and structural changes which occur during cycles. These phenomena cause severe mechanical fracture and exacerbated side reactions, and result in poor cycling performances. Thus, understanding and then overcoming the drawbacks of such alloying/de-alloying processes are very important. In this part, we present the recent advances in various technologies developed for understanding such fundamentals and mechanisms, particularly in regard to in situ TEM-based techniques.
Si is a representative anode material that works based on alloying/de-alloying processes; it shows a theoretical capacity of as high as 3579 mA h g−1 (when forming a Li15Si4 alloy).225,235 Liu et al. have studied the dynamic lithiation process of single-crystalline Si under in situ TEM. Through constructing an individual Si nanobattery device in TEM, it has been uncovered that the lithiation kinetics is controlled by the migration of the Si and LixSi interfaces. Lithiation preferably undergoes along 〈110〉 and 〈112〉 directions with a 280% volume increase, rather than along the compact 〈111〉 direction through layer-by-layer peeling of the {111} atomic facets.236 Such anisotropic insertion favouring the 〈110〉 directions has further been verified via construction of an in situ graphene liquid cell in TEM. The latter setup is close to realistic liquid environments during lithiation of Si anodes, as reported by Yuk et al.237
To overcome the drawbacks faced by alloying/de-alloying anodes,238–240 many smart designs have been proposed and tested. Liu et al. have synthesized pomegranate-like Si@C hierarchical structures to tackle the problems of volume expansion and mechanical fracture in Si anodes. As revealed by in situ TEM, Si nanoparticles, encapsulated by conductive carbon shells with enough void spaces, have suppressed the structure cracking during lithiation and delithiation.241
Among alloying/de-alloying-based anode materials for SIBs, elemental phosphorus (P) is one of the most attractive candidates with an ultrahigh theoretical capacity of 2596 mA h g−1. The key challenge associated with a phosphorus anode is its rapid structural degradation caused by its large volume change (>490%) during cycling. In order to overcome this problem, Cui et al. have recently developed a viable anode material for Na-ion batteries – a hybrid made of a few phosphorene layers sandwiched between graphene layers, as shown in Fig. 11a.171 It delivers an ultrahigh specific capacity of 2.440 mA h g−1 (at 0.05 A g−1) and holds a 83% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Through in situ TEM analysis (Fig. 11a), the authors have found the following reasons behind such large capacity: Na+ ions are intercalated along the x axis of the phosphorene layers followed by the formation of a Na3P alloy. At the same time, graphene layers can act as both the mechanical backbones and electrical highways, ensuring that a suitable elastic buffer space accommodates the anisotropic expansion of phosphorene layers along the y and z axial directions for stable cycling operations.

More recently, our group has designed a novel hybrid anode structure by using an innovative methodology and fabricated a flexible paper made of N-doped graphene and amorphous P (P@GN) that effectively tackles the large structural degradation problem. This new material design achieves a superb cycling stability. In order to clarify this, a direct in situ HRTEM study of the P@GN structural changes has been performed (Fig. 11b). During the sodiation process an individual P@GN has immediately expanded along both the longitudinal and transverse directions (Fig. 11b). Moreover, Na3P is detected as the main phase in the sodiated product. Finally, DFT calculations have unveiled the exact role of N-doped graphene: it not only contributes to an increase in capacity for Na+-insertion but is also helpful to enhance the rate capability.242
Ebner et al. have utilized synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) to visualize the electrochemical and mechanical evolution during SnO lithiation (SnO → Li2O + Sn → Li2O + Li4.4Sn) and de-lithiation processes. This method directly provides useful information related to core–shell structure formation, volume expansion, fracture of SnO particles during initial reduction and redensification during subsequent oxidation, and thus should guide the development of strain-tolerant and durable electrodes.243
Other 2D carbon or graphene-buffered structures have also been confirmed to improve the cycling performances remarkably better than solo components, like Si,246–254 S,255–257 P,171etc.258,259 Such a material design is able to accommodate the insertion-induced strains, prevents the loss of active components and thus presents a high Coulombic efficiency and relatively long cycle life.
4.3 Conversion mechanism
In addition to the above-mentioned mechanisms, the conversion mechanism is another known electrochemical working principle based on the reversible formation–decomposition of a Li2O nanomatrix within transition metal oxide anodes (e.g. CuO, Co3O4, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, MnFe2O4, Co9S8, and CoS2).260 Although high reversible capacities (500–1500 mA h g−1) have been documented for such conversion type electrodes, owing to the multiple electron reactions, big volume changes still take place and unavoidable electrolyte decomposition occurs during the first cycle, leading to the formation of a SEI layer over the active particle surfaces. As a result, many issues, such as huge irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle, large volume variation, higher redox potential, polarization and poor cycle-ability, have hindered the commercialization of these anodes, a similar problem which is faced by alloying/de-alloying electrodes. It is therefore necessary to deeply understand the mechanisms governing the battery performance and to optimize the regarded LIBs' anodes. Herein, some recent advances in electrochemical observations of the conversion-mechanism-based nanostructures at the nanoscale via in situ TEM and STEM are briefly introduced.
For example, our group261 has constructed a nano-LIB device based on a single CuO nanowire (NW) in TEM, and directly observed the lithiation–delithiation processes, and interestingly, revealed the reasons behind large irreversible capacity losses in the initial cycle, but high reversibility in the following cycles. In addition, Xu and co-workers have reported the dynamic behaviours and the conversion mechanism of Fe2O3/graphene towards Li storage by in situ TEM.262 There have been obvious volume expansion and morphological changes observed upon Li-insertion. Conversion reaction can also be proved by the fact that many Fe nanograins have been found to be embedded in a Li2O matrix during discharging. Surprisingly, not Fe2O3, but FeO has been realized to be the final delithiated product, thus accounting for the irreversible electrochemical process and the large capacity fading of the anode in the 1st cycle. Different from the previously recognized mechanism for Fe2O3, herein a new mechanism has been considered. The reversible electrochemical phase conversion occurring between Fe and FeO nanograins and accompanying the formation and disappearance of the Li2O layer has been accounted for this. Furthermore, the authors have also checked lithiation–delithiation processes of CoS/graphene hybrids, in which single-crystalline CoS2 particles have been found to convert to Co nanocrystals of 1–2 nm in size embedded within the Li2S matrix after the 1st lithiation.265 With booming interest in this area, more and more research studies have been reported while using in situ TEM and STEM routes, such as for Co3O4, RuO2, Fe3O4, MnFe2O4, Co9S8, and Ti3C2X electrodes.265–273 Such direct data on structure/phase evolution in such anodes provide deep insights into the reaction mechanism toward a design of new electrode materials.
4.4 Surface capacitive adsorption/desorption mechanism
Generally, the total stored energy for an electrode material should be divided into three parts: the diffusion controlled insertion/de-insertion process, the surface capacitive effects (pseudocapacitance), and non-Faradaic contribution caused by a double-layer effect. And the latter two capacitive components cannot be separated. For the traditional Li-storage materials, the two latter phenomena are negligible to be considered. However, 2D nanomaterials hold very large surface areas. In addition, many defects induced by doping or functional groups usually exist on their surfaces. Therefore, for 2D nanomaterials, the Faradaic contribution caused by a charge transfer process on surface atoms has to be taken into account, as illustrated in Fig. 13a. In the way towards unveiling this mechanism, the powerful TEM/SEM/AFM techniques have been proved to be useful, such as identification of defects, spacing and active sites.
Firstly, the disordered carbon, especially 2D graphene, has been evidenced to deliver exceptionally high reversible capacities (794–1054 mA h g−1).115 The dramatically improved capacity in disordered graphene nanosheets has also been proved to be mainly ascribed to additional reversible storage sites, such as edges and other defects. The highly distorted sp2 nanodomains are believed to produce the considerable surface capacitive effects.
Secondly, doping-induced absorption effects are also important for 2D nanostructures. For example, Lin and Mizuno have used first-principles calculations (DFT) to study the multilayer graphene for sodium storage. For a few-layered graphene, the charge carriers, i.e. Li+/Na+, can either be intercalated between layers, or be adsorbed on the surface. As shown in Fig. 13b, one can see the intercalation and adsorption of Na in bi-layer and tri-layer BC3 and the intercalation in bulk 3D-BC3. The average voltage for Na intercalation is ∼1.1–1.3 V, whereas it is ∼0.4–0.5 V for Na adsorption. And the adsorbed Na only reacts with one layer, while the intercalated Na interacts with two graphene layers in a multi-layered graphene. Note that the intercalation and the adsorption voltages are significantly affected by the number of layers. Therefore, their capacities are also of discrepancy.
Similarly, our group has also studied these effects and their differences in N-doped graphene (GN) and pure graphene (G). To quantitatively distinguish the effects from the total storing energy, the voltammetric sweep rate dependence approach has been applied according to the following equation:i(V)/ν1/2 = k1ν1/2 + k2where i represents the current; ν is the sweep rate; k1ν and k1ν1/2 correspond to the current contributions from surface capacitive effects and diffusion controlled insertion processes, respectively. The area under the CV curves stands for the total amount of stored charge which originates from both Faradaic and non-Faradaic processes. With the help of in situ TEM, the disorder and non-disorder structures on the surface of GN were observed.
From Fig. 13c, it can be concluded that introducing N dopants significantly enhances both the insertion capacity and the surface capacitive contribution due to GN bending and its disordering, and appearing many defects, especially 2D-conjugated C atoms. In addition, other elements (e.g. F, Cl, Br or I) doping into oxygen-containing 2D materials would also promote the enhanced reversible capacity or better cyclability.276 There are two underlying reasons: (1) the effect of the different electronegativity of halogen atoms (χ = 2.66–3.98), and thus a different ability of electron loss, compared to O2− (χ = 3.44); (2) a lower electrostatic repulsion of halogen ions than that for O2−, facilitating Li+-insertion/extraction and thus stabilizing the host structures during cycling.
In addition, a control of the inter-distance between graphene sheets through functional groups or interacting molecules is another effective way to enhance the storage capacity. For instance, Wang's group264 has reported that an expanded graphite with functional groups (Fig. 13d) can exhibit a high reversible capacity of 284 mA h g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1, and is able to maintain a capacity of 184 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. An enlarged interlayer lattice distance of 0.43 nm and an analogous long-range-ordered layered structure in graphite are believed to contribute to such superb performances. As shown in Fig. 13d, there are two stages in the sodiation curve of EGs: the monotonic sloping high voltage profile (>0.3 V versus Na/Na+) corresponds to the insertion/extraction of Na between graphene layers in EG, and an inclined voltage plateau (<0.3 V versus Na/Na+) represents the Na+ insertion/extraction in the pores/defects. Moreover, in situ transmission electron microscopy has also demonstrated that the Na+ ion can be reversibly inserted into and extracted from expanded graphite. Honma et al.4 have demonstrated that some interacting molecules, such as CNTs or fullerenes (C60), can influence the layer spacing between the graphene nanosheets, which is crucial for the enhancement of the storage capacity. Fig. 13e depicts the relationship between d-spacings and charge capacities for graphite and the GN families. It can be seen that reversible capacity is enhanced with an increase in d-spacing of a material. The different electronic structures of these hybrids and the additional sites for Li+ accommodation (produced by the enlarged d-spacing) are believed to be the two main reasons behind this.
MoS2 is another typical 2D nanomaterial in the energy storage fields. Tolbert et al.277 have demonstrated that ordered mesoporous thin films of MoS2 can act as pseudocapacitive energy storage materials with a specific capacity of 173 mA h g−1 for Li-ions and 118 mA h g−1 for Na+ at 1 mV s−1. A synchrotron grazing incidence X-ray diffraction technique and detailed electrochemical kinetic analysis have proved that energy storage for Li+/Na+ in MoS2 is based on a pseudocapacitive mechanism. Lee et al.153 have also reported on a 3D porous graphene composite with uniformly incorporated MoS2 flocculent nanostructures. This can serve as a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) with LIB-type anodes and electric double layer capacitor-type cathodes. For instance, the materials exhibit a high rate capability of 688 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 8 A g−1 and a stable cycling performance (997 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles at 2 A g−1).
4.5 Other advanced microscopic technologies developed for mechanism studies
Remarkable progress has been witnessed while using spherical aberration (Cs)-corrected STEM techniques, which can provide comprehensive information with respect to electrode materials at the atomic level. The notable developments in this direction should further boost a search for new promising electrode materials. In this section, we summarize recent advances in this field, while describing annular bright-field (ABF) imaging, STEM equipped with an annular dark-field (ADF) detector and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), liquid in situ TEM techniques, and X-ray microscopy (XM). These developments can shed additional light on the factors that limit the electrodes' performances.
In LIB studies, detection and observation of light elements, such as Li, play a very important role in uncovering physical properties and electrochemical performance.278–280 In a STEM system equipped with a ADF detector, the image contrast is roughly proportional to the square of the atomic number (Z2).281 A Cs corrector is usually attached in the STEM, making it possible to discern sub-Å details in various materials.282–288 In 2009, a new technique, i.e. annular bright-field (ABF) imaging, was developed for the use in STEM mode.289,290 In this technique, an annular detector is located within the bright-field (direct-scattered) region, as illustrated in Fig. 12a. Therefore, it is effectively used to simultaneously image columns of both light and heavy elements with a good signal-to-noise ratio. In this field, Ikuhara's group has performed considerable work.284,285,288 For example, they have directly observed Li+ ions in LiFePO4 at atomic resolution by using STEM and ABF.244Fig. 12b–d depict ABF micrographs, in which Li+ ions of partially delithiated LiFePO4 at every other row can be clearly identified. Furthermore, it has been found that the remaining Li ions preferably occupy every second layer in the partially delithiated LiFePO4, along the b axis. This new finding doubts the previously proposed LiFePO4/FePO4 two-phase separation mechanisms.291 In addition, the STEM technique in combination with first-principles calculations shows power for understanding the energy storage of anodes at the atomic level, for example, elucidating Li+ rearrangements within lithiated-Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) electrodes, investigating the phase boundary involved in this presumably topotactic two-phase reaction and the electronic charge distribution after lithiation. In addition, this technique has provided direct evidence that would lead to a clear Li+-storage picture in Li4Ti5O12,292 and has uncovered the interfacial structure formed during a two-phase transition reaction. In the discharging–charging process, the Li+ ions change the site with Li+ occupying only the 8a sites and the 16c sites in Li7Ti5O12. Furthermore, Wan and Guo et al. (Fig. 12e–m) have measured Li4Ti5O12 nanosheets terminated with rutile-TiO2 by means of STEM, and revealed the structural reasons for the improved rate capability and specific capacity, compared with pure Li4Ti5O12 nanosheets.245 It is noted that the orientation of rutile-TiO2 at the edge of LTO-RT-600 toward the surface is along the [100] direction, this direction is treated as the most favourable for fast Li+ ion transport owing to the highest Li+ ion diffusion coefficient (10−6 cm2 s−1). Moreover, our group has demonstrated a Cu/LTO ensemble consisting of nanoporous Cu scaffolds and encapsulated LTO NPs with highly exposed (111) planes.293 Being tested as an anode in LIBs, Cu/LTO has documented superior performances: >2000 cycle lifespan and an ultrafast charging time. DFT calculations and detailed HRTEM characterization have revealed its unique storage mechanism (8a + 16c), which differs from the transition between 8a and 16c in bulk LTO. These findings indicate that increasing the population of high-energy planes on the electrodes' surface is another promising method for the fabrication of effective electrodes for lithium storage.

Despite tremendous successes, the most commonly used in situ TEM experiments modelling LIBs are still based on open-cell configurations, in which either solid Li oxide or an ionic liquid are used as the electrolyte, and the point contacts are used as electrodes. Such a nanobattery in a TEM inherently differs from a real battery, where a liquid electrolyte is used and there is a conformal contact with electrode materials. Therefore, several new liquid in situ TEM techniques have been designed in order to address this issue, such as construction of an operando TEM electrochemical liquid cell, an in situ TEM graphene liquid cell (GLC), and a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based TEM electrochemical liquid cell. The researchers then can observe the lithiation–delithiation behaviours in real-time on Si nanowires294 and Si nanoparticles sandwiched between graphenes.237 As seen in Fig. 14a, Lee et al. have integrated a nanodevice into the GLC-TEM. This experiment deepens the understanding on the critical first lithiation of Si, especially in realistic liquid environments. Interestingly, the initial lithiation of Si nanoparticles shows anisotropic volume expansion favouring the [110] directions because of the smaller Li diffusion energy barrier at the Si–electrolyte interface along such orientations. The liquid in situ TEM is also a powerful tool to study other aspects of rechargeable batteries, e.g. one can visualize electrode–electrolyte interfaces in the LiPF6/EC/DEC electrolyte for LIBs,295 quickly and directly probe the degradation mechanisms in electrolyte solution,296 image the nanoscale distribution of ions during electrochemical charging of a battery,297in situ study the lithiation/delithiation of MoS2 nanosheets in a LiPF6/EC/DEC commercial electrolyte,298 directly observe the solid electrolyte interphase formation in LIBs,299 and even see Li metal dendritic growth and solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) layers.300 Very recently, Cui's group301 has designed a novel platform to capture the first in situ optical images of Li intercalation in MoS2 nanosheets, shedding new light on the dynamics of the intercalation process and the associated spatial inhomogeneity and cycling-induced structural defects.

STEM coupled with the EELS technique is particularly valuable for structural and morphological electrode characterization, e.g. Meng et al. have reported the direct application of STEM/EELS for all solid-state batteries and e-beam damage quantification in order to deeply understand the role of interfaces.274 The first evidence of Li accumulation at the anode/current collector (Si/Cu) and cathode/electrolyte (LixCoO2/LiPON) interfaces has been given, resulting in the irreversible capacity losses. It also suggests that interfaces may significantly limit the Li-transport in the solid-state batteries. Also the electrochemical oxidation process of Li2O2 in Li–O2 cells has been checked by Mao's group.302 Another new route to check the interface is building a micro-battery via in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) recently developed by Hu et al.275 The latter has been used to study MoS2 flakes as Na+ ion anodes. The setup is shown in Fig. 14d, this microscale battery is comprised of MoS2 flakes with Cu connections and a Na reference. It works in a dry room environment. Such a system not only provides quantitative data on the SEI thickness for MoS2 electrodes in Na-ion batteries for the first time, but also allows one to accomplish topographical observations in an open cell configuration due to a low vapour pressure of the electrolyte.
X-ray microscopes (XMs) are also powerful and effective tools for the research of rechargeable batteries; these can provide non-destructive, well resolved (tens of nanometers) X-ray images.303 There are two most common X-ray microscopy techniques: transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) and scanning transmission microscopy (STXM), in which 3D elemental imaging can provide substantial information. Yang and coworkers have utilized a multi-modal TXM tool to spatially resolve changes in a chemical phase, oxidation state, and morphology within a high voltage cathode during cycling.304 Moreover, Liu and co-workers have used the high-resolution 3D TEM to characterize the porous carbon nanofiber (CNF) loaded with spherical SnSb nanoparticles,258 which are believed to benefit for a Na+ ion storage when tested as anodes for rechargeable SIBs. In addition, Wood and coworkers have reported on using a new approach: X-ray tomography, which can provide the time-resolved, 3D chemical composition and morphology within a single electrode particle. Therefore, the origins of electrochemical evolution of the single particles and even their capacity changes during Li-insertion/Li-deinsertion can now be visualized and quantified.
5. Summary and outlook
2D nanostructured materials and their hybrids, such as graphene, transition metal chalcogenides and transition metal oxides, are now receiving increasing attention with respect to energy applications. The integration of 2D hybrid nanomaterials into energy storage devices for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors offers opportunities to address many challenges driven by growing green energy demands.106,305 This review gives a detailed analysis of 2D hybrid nanomaterial preparation for the energy storage, storage mechanisms at the atomic scale and the latest advances in the advanced microscopy techniques. This contribution should guide future 2D hybrid nanostructured electrode developments and design of new microscopic tools to study structure–performance relationships.
Despite much important progress achieved in the energy storage of the 2D hybrid structures, many problems associated with this field have not been solved as yet. Some important issues and challenges in future research (Fig. 15) are listed as follows:
 Fig. 15  Schematic illustration of the future development in the 2D electrode material field for energy storage including advanced electron microscopy techniques. 
(1) Suitable textural structures of the electrode materials
As we mentioned in this review, a suitable textural design is desirable for the next-generation super-high rate, high-capacity and durable rechargeable electrode materials. An electrode material with a certain content of void/porous structures is helpful to speed up the battery dynamic charging/discharging processes, improve the battery capacity due to the exposure of more active storage sites, buffer the volumetric changes of the active materials and thus prolong their life span. Certainly, larger surface areas usually cause a larger initial capacity loss of the battery due to the formation of irreversible SEI layers. Thus, the question how to balance such textural factors becomes a critical issue in rechargeable battery designs. For example, Li's group230 reported on an effective route to greatly improve the energy density per unit volume of 2D nanosheets: integration of graphene sheets with electrolytes to form highly compact graphene paper electrodes. Besides, other features of the 2D nanoarchitectonics, like flexibility and stability, are highly desirable for a qualified electrode material.
(2) Scale-up and low-cost fabrication method
To be commercially viable, 2D-structured electrode materials must substantially over-perform the existing materials at the comparable manufacturing costs. Therefore, the development of scalable and low-cost production methods plays the key role in commercialization. Although a considerable amount of progress has been made in the synthesis of 2D hybrid structures at a laboratory level, cost-controlled and efficient methods that are adaptive to industrial procedures are still scarce. We envision that the following efforts should be vital to solve this problem: (a) development of top-down exfoliation methods using synergistic techniques (mechanical and electrochemical processes, etc.); (b) design of scaled-up, continuous and solvent-recyclable wet growth methods; (c) realization of large-area, continuous, and possibly substrate-free chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth; (d) implementation of new methods to greatly improve the tap density and volumetric energy density of 2D layered materials.
(3) Safety and reliability issues
Safety is still a big problem for LIBs. Nowadays, the commonly used flammable electrolytes, heat management, stability of the SEI layers are still the potential risk factors for LIBs.
(4) Novel advanced microscopic techniques
New cutting-edge microscopic methods are highly desirable for rechargeable battery mechanism studies. For example, seeing structural details in electrode materials under atomic resolution, such as ordered Li and O vacancies, would provide essential information for the special Li+/Na+ ion transport paths. Furthermore, another key factor to determine the battery performance would be control of the interfaces between the electrode and the electrolyte. It is worth noting that it is still challenging to visualize Li+/Na+ diffusion across the interface employing the current TEM techniques.
(5) Theoretical calculations
In order to deeply and in detail analyse and understand the storage mechanisms peculiar to electrodes, theoretical calculations are also needed; these will guide searching and designing better 2D electrode materials. A combination of theoretical calculations and in situ observations of cation transport can uncover the transport/storage mechanisms of Li+/Na+ ions inside new 2D electrode nanomaterials during electrochemical cycles.
(6) Novel energy storage mechanisms
With the assistance of the new preparation approaches, advanced microscopic and novel calculation methods, more and more 2D nanostructured materials and their hybrids can be designed and fabricated. And the profound insights into the novel energy storage mechanisms that govern such electrodes' performances are expected to be entirely disclosed. It is conceivable that these novel mechanisms will definitely provide a smart design of new electrode materials and thus greatly promote the rapid development of new energy storage pathways and technologies which are environmentally benign and cheap. In the future, one might create the ideal 2D structured electrode materials with optimized energy/power densities, lifetime, safety, and at the potentially reduced cost, while minimizing any negative environmental impacts. Above all, revolutionary designs, concepts and architectures should significantly reduce the system and maintenance costs of large and powerful energy storage systems.
