    , Accepted 7th October 2016First published on 7th October 2016AbstractHere, a class of organometallic compounds, metallocenes, are explored to serve as both catholyte and anolyte redox species for non-aqueous lithium-based redox flow battery (Li-RFB) applications. The prototype of all-metallocene-based Li-RFB exploits ferrocene (FeCp2) and cobaltocene (CoCp2) as the redox-active cathode and anode, respectively. The reaction rate constants of metallocenes are determined to be as high as 10−3 cm s−1, two orders greater than most redox-active materials applied in conventional redox flow batteries. This designed Li-RFB yields a working potential of 1.7 V, and by introduction of methyl groups on the ligand rings of CoCp2, the working potential can be further increased to 2.1 V. The fabricated full cell shows capacity retention of over 99% per cycle with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of >95% and an energy efficiency of >85%. These results demonstrate a generic design route towards high performance non-aqueous RFBs via rational screening and functionalization of metallocenes.

Broader context
Effective use of sustainable energy from intermittent sources like solar and wind power requires efficient energy storage systems. As an emerging rechargeable battery, lithium redox flow batteries (Li-RFB) represent an important advance which is distinct from conventional solid-state rechargeable batteries in the structural diversity of electroactive materials, modulated battery design, and decoupled energy content and power output, and a step beyond conventional RFBs, which are limited due to low operating potentials and low round-trip efficiencies. Different from conventional flow battery chemistries based on metal ions, metallocenes with a metal center sandwiched between two cyclopentadienyl ligands allow more freedom to tune both the physical and chemical characteristics via molecular engineering methods, and herein we propose a prototype Li-RFB by exploiting appropriate metallocenes to serve as both cathode-active and anode-active materials. This all-metallocene-based Li-RFB shows that organometallic materials represent an important direction towards high performance non-aqueous RFBs.

A RFB is one in which the active materials involved in the electrode reactions are soluble.1,2 The cell is charged with the input of external electrical energy to drive the overall cell reaction in a thermodynamically uphill direction. Oxidized species are produced in the cathode part and reduced species are formed in the anode part. Upon discharge, electricity is produced in these cells when the stored reactants flow back into the cell and react at the electrodes. Technically speaking, a flow battery is akin to a fuel cell in that they both require a continuous source of redox-active materials to sustain the chemical reaction. Fuel cells based on hydrogen or synthetic fuels, however, are commonly considered as energy conversion devices and cannot be electrically reversed efficiently. Therefore, fuels cells hold promise in electric vehicle applications considering their merits of high energy density, zero-emission and higher efficiency compared with diesel or gas engines.3,4 As for flow batteries, these devices are of great importance as secondary or rechargeable batteries, especially for grid-scale electrical energy storage applications. The general criteria for an ideal RFB include: (i) high solubility of the active materials so as to minimize the storage volume/mass and achieve high energy densities; (ii) suitable formal potentials of the redox couples in order to maximize the cell voltage; (iii) fast heterogeneous reaction rate which limits the power density; (iv) stability of the active materials, which is related to the cycle life; and (v) safety, cost and abundance of the active materials considering commercial applications.5,6 A number of redox couples have been proposed for such systems in conventional RFBs.1 A difficulty in these energy storage devices is the inevitable crossover of the components between the two half-cells because of imperfect separators or membranes, which leads not only to a loss of capacity and efficiency but more seriously to the contamination of electroactive species.
Recently, Li-RFBs using Li ions as charge carriers were proposed and intensively investigated.7–9 The potential window is broadened in an aprotic electrolyte, but the main challenges of these Li-RFBs arise from the lack of appropriate anode-active materials with the desired redox potential and reversibility.10 Currently, metallic lithium is usually used as the anode.11,12 Despite its great electropositivity, the major disadvantage lies in safety issues resulting from dendritic and mossy lithium growth and low Coulombic efficiency due to electrolyte decomposition under such a low potential of Li+/Li.13–15 Though some organic-based anode materials have been proposed,16,17 the redox potential is relatively high, usually >2.5 V vs. Li+/Li, thus restricting the working potential of the full battery (<2 V). Recent investigations suggest that organometallic compounds such as metallocenes might be good alternatives to displace the inorganic-based redox couples used in conventional RFBs.11,18 Typically, metallocene is a compound consisting of two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands, C5H5, bound to a metal center (M) in the oxidation state of II on opposite sides. It's known that the π-orbitals of the Cp rings and the d-orbitals in the metal center are mainly in charge of the coordination and chemical reactivity.19 Different electronic structures, together with the variation of the M–C bonds and the valence electron count, give rise to different properties. Metallocenes and their derivatives were investigated as catalysts in the early stages.20 Together with a co-catalyst, metallocene has been adopted as a homogeneous Ziegler–Natta catalyst in olefin polymerization.21 Moreover, the use of metallocenes in electron-transfer processes,22 as anticancer reagents,23 as fuel additives,24 in bioorganometallic chemistry,25etc. has contributed greatly to the rapid growth and rapidly moving frontiers of these compounds. Despite the wide prospect of metallocene-based materials, insights into their applications in energy storage has just recently been proposed.18,26,27 Generally speaking, the redox reaction between metallocene and its onium is a standard reversible process with a broad potential range, which should be associated with the particularly simple electron-transfer process involving only electron transport without significant alternations in the molecular form.28 What's more, the solvent dependence of metallocenes affects both physical and chemical properties as well,29 making the rational design of Li-RFBs possible by screening appropriate metal centers and corresponding solvents.
In this research, we propose a prototype all-metallocene based Li-RFB by exploiting appropriate metallocenes to serve as both cathode-active and anode-active materials as schematically demonstrated in Fig. 1. FeCp2, of which the redox potential reaches as high as 3.7 V vs. Li+/Li in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), was selected as the cathode-active species. While CoCp2, which typically shows a redox potential around 2.0 V vs. Li+/Li, serves as the anode-active species. Considering the voltage discrepancy, the proposed all-metallocene Li-RFB system should output an operating potential of 1.7 V, higher than conventional flow batteries (<1.6 V) based on redox species in aqueous medium restricted by the potential window of water.1,2,30 Compared with the semi-liquid batteries directly using Li metal as the anode, this Li-metal-free battery can circumvent the potential dangers related to Li anodes.12 In addition, the solubility of metallocenes can be manipulated simply by solvent screening. For instance, the solubility can reach as high as 1.5 M in ethers like tetrahydrofuran or dioxolane.31 Last but not least, metallocenes maintain highly tailorable properties, and the molecular design on Cp rings can tune both the redox potential and solubility furthermore.11,26 A further step in this research shows that functionalizing ten methyl groups on Cp ligands can lower the redox potential of CoCp2 to 1.5 V vs. Li+/Li, and the output potential of the all-metallocene based full battery reaches 2.1 V accordingly. While preparing this manuscript, we noted that Kim’s group also tried to utilize metallocenes as redox species for flow batteries, but the electrochemistry of the metallocene family was not touched upon.30 On the other hand, the experimental demonstration of flow batteries was not provided to show the proof-of-concept implementation. Therefore, a comprehensive study integrating structural analysis, electrochemical characterization, and battery design is still needed to better elucidate the redox characteristics of the metallocene family, especially for organic flow battery applications.

A key property of metallocene is their ability to exist in the form of various oxidation states with a variable number of d-electrons between 14 and 20, which is not usually the case for other families of inorganic or organometallic complexes.19 These various oxidation states are characterized by cyclic voltammetry, with each wave corresponding to a change of oxidation state as summarized in Table 1. As a prototype of metallocene, the molecular structure of FeCp2 has been fully explored.32 It was found that in this sandwich structure, the energy barrier separating the staggered (D5d point group) and eclipsed (D5h point group) rotational orientations of the bounded Cp ligands was very small.19 In idealized D5d symmetry, interaction between two Cp ligands splits the 10 π orbitals into combinations of a1g, a2u, e1g, e1u, e2g and e2u. Similarly, the metal valence orbitals in the ligand field are generated qualitatively into a1g, e1g, e2g, a1g, a2u and e1u. Thereupon the overall molecular orbital is given by the interaction of the ligand orbitals with the center metal orbitals.33,34 Molecular orbitals of CoCp2 and its corresponding onium and analogs also follow this order, which was corroborated by subsequent electron spin resonance (ESR) and magnetic susceptibility studies.19 Similarly, the ground-state electron configuration of VCp2, NiCp2 and other metallocenes can be obtained by tuning the number of electrons to the configuration of FeCp2 respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Furthermore, a rotating disk electrode (RDE) test was carried out to reveal the different electrochemical performances of metallocenes. Voltammograms of FeCp2, CoCp2 and NiCp2 at different rotation rates in common organic solvents yield mass-transport-limited currents (Fig. S3a, b and S4, ESI†). The Levich equation in eqn (1) establishes the relationship between Levich current and related parameters, where ilim is the Levich current, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, A is the electrode area, D is the diffusion coefficient, ω is the angular rotation rate, v is the kinematic viscosity and C is the concentration. ilim = 0.620 × nFAD2/3ω1/2v−1/6C(1)
The linear relationship between ilim and the square root of ω indicates a well-defined mass-transfer-limited process (Fig. S3c, d and S5, ESI†), through which the diffusion coefficients could be determined to be 9.6 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for FeCp2, 2.9 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for CoCp2, and 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 for NiCp2, which are in the same order of magnitude with the redox couples used in conventional RFBs,35 but larger than that of Li ions in solid state batteries.36 Koutecky–Levich analysis at different overpotentials (Fig. 2a, b and Fig. S6, ESI†) could be extrapolated to an infinite rotation rate to get the heterogeneous rate constant limited current iK, which represents the current in the absence of any mass-transfer effects and is only dependent on the reaction kinetics. Fitting iK to the Butler–Volmer equation (Fig. 2c, d and Fig. S7, ESI†) yielded the reaction rate constant (k0) of 2.0 × 10−3 cm s−1, 5.3 × 10−4 cm s−1 and 1.7 × 10−3 cm s−1 for FeCp2, CoCp2, and NiCp2 respectively. Compared with the heterogeneous rate constants of the redox species used in conventional RFBs (Table S1, ESI†),1 the redox kinetics for metallocene is relatively fast, which should be ascribed to the simple electron-transfer process, only with electron transfer and resolvation involved without significant alternations in the molecular structure. Thanks to the fast reaction kinetics demonstrated above, the voltage loss due to the electrochemical polarization caused by a net surface reaction rate should be mitigated considerably. In light of the Butler–Volmer formulation of the electrode kinetics, a redox reaction with a larger k0 would achieve equilibrium faster and the faradaic current should be proportional to the rate constant, therefore the assembled battery should have the potential to achieve a higher energy efficiency than conventional RFBs.37 After a systematic study of a series of metallocene, namely, FeCp2, CoCp2 and NiCp2, the electrochemical characteristics of this family of redox species were elucidated. In spite of the fact that NiCp2 maintains both a high diffusion coefficient and a constant reaction rate, FeCp2 and CoCp2 were selected to construct the all-metallocene flow battery considering the highest potential difference.

To gain a better understanding of the half-reaction of metallocene, FeCp2 and CoCp2 were subjected to half-cell electrochemical measurements using metallic lithium as the anode, respectively. In this study, a home-made cell was adopted to demonstrate the performance; this cell is composed of a current collector of activated carbon, metallocene in a certain common organic solvent as the catholyte, a NASICON-type Li1+x+3zAlx(Ti,Ge)2−xSi3zP3−zO12 (LATP) membrane as the separator, and Li metal as the anode. The detailed assembling process can be found in our previous work.18 The redox behaviours of both FeCp2 and CoCp2 show strong solvent-dependence as the solvent might interact with metallocenes as presented in Fig. 3. The dQ/dV profiles of 0.1 M FeCp2 and 0.1 M CoCp2 at 0.4C (nC denotes delivery of the theoretical capacity in 1/n hour) in dioxolane (DOL), tetrahydrofuran (THF), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) indicate that the highest redox potential for both FeCp2 and CoCp2 was achieved in DMA, followed by DMF and THF with DOL being the lowest. One empirical model is constructed to relate any physicochemical quantity to well-known solvent parameters,38 leading to the expression between the formal redox potential Ef and four contributions: Ef = E0f + ΔEp + ΔEH + ΔEs(2)in which E0f is the formal redox potential without any solvent interactions, ΔEp is the term associated with the electrostatic interactions between the solvent dipoles and the charges of the redox species, ΔEH is an interaction related to the changes in internal solvent order contributed by the two oxidation states, ΔEs indicates the specific solvent effects, such as the hydrogen bonding between the solvent and solute, the π–π interaction between the solvent and solute and the Lewis acid/base interaction. Accordingly, the potential shift in different solvents should be attributed to all four factors. It was found that DMF should be the most suitable for the catholyte considering its higher redox potential than DOL/THF and its better round-trip efficiency than DMA. Meanwhile, DOL is more suitable than the others as the solvent for the anolyte since CoCp2 exhibits the lowest redox potential and a good round-trip efficiency.

Fig. S8 (ESI†) demonstrates the galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of the FeCp2PF6 and CoCp2 half cells respectively. The initial capacity reached 129 and 127 mA h g−1 for FeCp2 and CoCp2, respectively, corresponding with ca. 88% of the theoretical capacity. Given the fast reaction kinetics and high diffusion coefficient, the untapped capacity should be due to the limited Li ion conductivity of the Li ion membrane (∼10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature).8 The charge/discharge capacity was stable with a decay of about 0.2% per cycle, and the CE was stabilized to nearly 100%. It should be pointed out that the alleviated polarization for the FeCp2 half-cell upon cycling should be due to the wettability of the carbon current collector and the interface between the separator and electrolyte. As for the CoCp2 half-cell, the deteriorative polarization after cycling should result from the passivation of the solid electrolyte when the potential reached below −2 V vs. NHE.
Based on these results, an all-metallocene based full cell can be built using FeCp2PF6 and CoCp2 as the high and low potential active species respectively. As a proof-of-concept system, a similar cell structure was designed, with activated carbon as the current collectors for both the catholyte and anolyte, and an LATP membrane as the separator sandwiched in between. The anolyte contains 0.05 M CoCp2, 0.5 M LiTFSI in DOL and the catholtye contains 0.05 M FeCp2, 0.05 M FeCp2PF6, and 0.5 M LiPF6 in DMF. The potential–time profile shows that the as-prepared full cell maintains the potential at 1.7 V during discharge and 1.8 V during charging, as presented in Fig. 4a. This result also correlates well with the half cell tests, in which the discharge potential of FeCp2PF6 reaches about 3.7 V vs. Li+/Li in DMF and the charge potential of CoCp2 is about 2.0 V in DOL. The steady voltage profile over time demonstrates the reversibility and stability of the metallocene redox species during the electrochemical process. Owing to the LATP membrane separator, the crossover of the active species can be limited to the minimum extent considering the stabilized Coulombic efficiency (CE) is over 95%. In the cycling test, the stabilized capacity can reach 81% of the theoretical value in the second cycle, and the capacity retention shows over 99% per cycle with a voltage efficiency (VE) of over 90% and an energy efficiency (EE) of about 85%, both of which exceed most of the current state-of-the-art non-aqueous flow batteries greatly (EE ∼ 20–50%).5 The capacity fading should be due to the imperfect Coulombic efficiency (Fig. 4b) without unlimited Li sources. Additionally, Fig. S8 (ESI†) also illustrates the capacity degradation of the FeCp2PF6- and CoCp2-based half cell using Li anode. The imperfect Coulombic efficiency might be caused by undesirable side reactions, degradation of the LATP membrane, or the reaction irreversibility of the metallocenes. Given the difference between the half cell and full cell, it should be reasonable to see more obvious capacity fading in a full cell. It has been reported that a stable resistive solid–liquid electrolyte interphase will be formed on the membrane, which leads to an increased Coulombic efficiency after cycling, as shown in Fig. 4b.39 Increasing the concentration of active materials led to higher utilization of the active materials, though the stabilized CE, EE and VE remained almost unchanged (Fig. S9, ESI†). Even when the concentration of CoCp2 was lifted to 1 M, the demonstrated volumetric capacity could reach 13400 mA h L−1 (Fig. S10, ESI†), which is higher than most of the reported non-aqueous redox flow batteries.5 Furthermore, the performance of a flow-mode battery was also demonstrated. Fig. S11 (ESI†) shows the polarization curve of the flow mode battery at a flow rate of 4 mL min−1, in which a power density of 1.8 mW cm−2 can be achieved at a current density of 1.5 mA cm−2. The power density is comparable with that of reported non-aqueous flow batteries but lower than aqueous flow batteries.5 Improvement in the battery design or utilization of advanced membranes should lead to enhanced performances.

Compared with the recently developed RFBs (Fig. S12, ESI†),16,17,40–44 the all-metallocene based full cell can provide a potential comparable with non-aqueous RFBs. Besides, the solubility of the anode-active material can also reach a very high value (∼1.5 M), which is usually the limiting factor for non-aqueous RFBs and Li-RFBs. To further prove the stability of the solid electrolyte when exposed to a reductive CoCp2 anolyte, the half cell of CoCp2 was tested in the potential range of 0.05 V and 2 V (Fig. S13, ESI†), and it appears that the reduction of the solid electrolyte mostly takes place below 1 V (Fig. S14, ESI†), and this reaction is not reversible. Therefore, the reduction of the solid electrolyte will not be an issue, nor contribute to the reversible capacity of the full cell.
Different from conventional RFBs based on metal chelates, the Cp rings in metallocenes provide more convenience to tune the physical and chemical properties using molecular engineering methods.45 The oxidation potentials of metallocene derivatives referenced to that of metallocenes should correlate linearly with the HOMO of metallocene derivatives with respect to that of metallocene.46 Therefore, the introduction of electron-donating groups should increase the energy level and then lower the redox potential of metallocenes. Herein bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) cobalt () was adopted in the anolyte instead. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the oxidation potential of  is decreased to ∼1.5 V compared with ∼2 V of CoCp2. Thus, the working potential of the corresponding full cell is increased to 2.1 V, which is high enough to power up a yellow LED bulb with an on-set potential of 2 V (Fig. 5b). Similarly, functionalization of FeCp2 with electron-withdrawing groups, such as a nitro group and a cyano group, will also lead to an increase in the working potential of the full cell. However, the utilization of  and the cycling performance is not satisfactory probably due to the poor compatibility of the  solution with the LATP solid electrolyte at such a low potential. This issue is expected to be circumvented by designing a more advanced Li ion conducting membrane with a broadened potential window. For example, the Li3PS4-based solid electrolyte holds great promise with a broadened working potential range of 0.22–5 V, and the Li10GeP2S12 has both a high ionic conductivity and a high decomposition potential as a Li ion conducting solid electrolyte.47,48

Conclusions
In summary, using metalorganic compounds such as metallocenes, would enable non-aqueous Li-RFBs to operate at higher cell potentials and to achieve higher energy densities and energy efficiencies, if the structure of the metallorganic compounds could be properly modified and functionalized. Here, we investigate a promising non-aqueous Li-RFB, which utilizes FeCp2 and CoCp2 as the cathode-active and anode-active species respectively. FeCp2 demonstrates a highly reversible single electron transfer at 3.7 V vs. Li+/Li, whereas CoCp2 shows a relatively low redox potential at 2.0 V vs. Li+/Li. By introducing electron withdrawing/donating functional groups on the Cp rings, the redox potential could be potentially further increased/decreased so as to maximize the overall operating potential of the full cell. Moreover, enhanced solubility of the redox species in polar organic solvents can be achieved via introduction of long chain ethers, which is beneficial to realize a high energy density of the flow battery. In this demonstrated proof-of-concept cell, the electrochemical couple of FeCp2 and CoCp2 discharge and charge from 1.6–1.7 V and 1.8–1.9 V, respectively, with a capacity decay less than 1% per cycle, and Coulombic and energy efficiencies of ∼95% and ∼85%, respectively. Furthermore, molecular engineering on the anode species boosts the potential of the full cell by 0.5 V, which is high enough to light up a yellow LED bulb. Compared with other Li-RFBs based on a metallic Li anode, the substitution of the anodes by a low-potential redox species can circumvent the safety issues related to the high reactivity and dendrite formation of Li. All these results demonstrate a generic design route towards high performance non-aqueous Li-RFBs by using electroactive organometallic species, which offer opportunities for the design and synthesis of a novel organometallic molecule with a tailorable redox potential, solubility, and activity.

Broader context
Effective use of sustainable energy from intermittent sources like solar and wind power requires efficient energy storage systems. As an emerging rechargeable battery, lithium redox flow batteries (Li-RFB) represent an important advance which is distinct from conventional solid-state rechargeable batteries in the structural diversity of electroactive materials, modulated battery design, and decoupled energy content and power output, and a step beyond conventional RFBs, which are limited due to low operating potentials and low round-trip efficiencies. Different from conventional flow battery chemistries based on metal ions, metallocenes with a metal center sandwiched between two cyclopentadienyl ligands allow more freedom to tune both the physical and chemical characteristics via molecular engineering methods, and herein we propose a prototype Li-RFB by exploiting appropriate metallocenes to serve as both cathode-active and anode-active materials. This all-metallocene-based Li-RFB shows that organometallic materials represent an important direction towards high performance non-aqueous RFBs.
