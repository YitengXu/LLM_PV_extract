    , Accepted 11th September 2020First published on 15th September 2020AbstractA spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene], often described as a “low-cost spiro,” has been functionalized with terminal diketopyrrolopyrrole units to generate a promising, three-dimensional non-fullerene acceptor. The new acceptor, coded as SFX1, was readily synthesized using the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction and was sufficiently soluble in a variety of commonly used, film-processing solvents such as chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. SFX1 displayed promising optoelectronic properties and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels complementary to the commercially available and commonly used donor polymers P3HT and PTB7. The joining of two high-potential building blocks – the spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] and diketopyrrolopyrrole – demonstrates a new strategy where the device performance [D:A 1:1.2 = 9.42% (D = PTB7)] validates its use as a potential, three-dimensional non-fullerene acceptor.
1. Introduction
The thin-film technologies such as organic and dye-sensitized solar cells have been explored thoroughly, and are well understood and becoming increasingly industrially-viable commercial solutions.1,2 Organic derived bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells in particular are promising as they can be transformed into cheap, portable and remotely installable photovoltaic modules. Such devices are constructed with the active layer composed of donor and acceptor materials in which fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), PC71BM or ICBA, have dominated the acceptor materials’ market.3,4 Though power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >10% can be achieved using the fullerene-based acceptors,5 it seems that such acceptors cannot exhibit higher performance using simple and scalable device fabrication strategies. Potential causes of this limitation relate to such acceptors suffering from restricted chemical and energetic tuning via structural modification, insufficient absorption in the visible region and undesirable as-cast morphology.6 Such disadvantages have encouraged researchers to seek alternative structural types which can be easily synthesized, scaled-up and compete with fullerene acceptors by keeping desirable properties such as high electron mobility, solubility, chemical and thermal stabilities and excellent accepting strength. Such alternative structural types – termed non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) – have been shown to blend with the commercially and cheaply available donor polymers, e.g. P3HT, but also exhibit additional merits such as extended conjugation for strong absorption, tuned energy levels and structural diversity.7,8 Such BHJ solar cells have achieved high PCEs ranging 13% to 17%.9–13 Therefore, it is important to extend research into NFAs to evaluate design strategies capable of building upon the merits described above.
Several structural types have been developed as efficient NFA targets,14–18 including acceptor–acceptor–acceptor and three-dimensional (3D) NFAs, with the twisted configuration of the latter showing most promise to replace fullerene-based counterparts.19,20 NFA targets based on a small molecule approach usually exhibit higher crystallinity and coplanar structures, thus, resulting in aggregation leading to unfavourable, as-cast blend morphologies and hence inferior device outcomes. This issue may be solved with the development of 3D, non-planar systems where strong intermolecular aggregation can be prevented by the inherent structure while still sustaining elongated conjugation for efficient photon harvesting. Moreover, such non-planar arrangements can provide enhanced solubility, high thermal stability, and can help to reduce charge recombination.21 It is therefore reasonable to explore 3D, non-planar formats for generating efficient NFAs.
In order to achieve a 3D architecture, a structural unit/building block can be placed centrally and it then allows various functionalities to be linked at its edges/peripheries. A number of recent reports disclose key examples of NFAs based on 3D formats where a variety of cores such as, tetraphenylmethane, tetraphenylsilane, 9,9′-bifluorenylidene, 9,9′-spirobi[fluorene], 4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene], truxene, spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] and tetraphenylethylene have been used.22–25 We have also reported one such NFA target where spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) has been used as the central block and functionalized with cyanopyridone units.26 The SFX core in particular is reported as a ‘‘low-cost spiro’’ and has been used for applications such as luminescence, perovskite solar cells and organic light emitting diodes.27–34 Given the simple and scalable synthetic strategy to produce the SFX unit together with its low-cost and multidisciplinary use, we thought to explore this core further by attaching strongly accepting diketopyrrolopyrrole units at its peripheries to produce SFX1 (Fig. 1). The use of functionalities such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) can certainly help to generate highly conjugated target structures that can fulfil challenging requirements needed of high-performing NFAs, including a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), thermal stability, and solubility in most of the commonly used and thin-film processing solvents. We have used DPP unit in one of our previous studies where it was conjoined with the central tetraphenylethylene unit to generate a 3D NFA target.15 Though the Voc of the device was very high (1.18 V), but the efficiency was moderate. By keeping the aims of (1) efficiency improvement, (2) producing efficient NFAs with the use of cheap raw materials and straightforward synthetic strategies, and (3) enriching the library of NFAs based on non-planar, 3D formats, herein we report SFX1 and its initial assessment as an acceptor or “n-type” material by using it in solution-processed BHJ devices along with two different donor polymers P3HT and PTB7.

2. Results and discussion
Compound SFX1 was synthesized in modest yield via the commercially viable Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromospiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (compound 1) and 2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3-(5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (compound 2) (Scheme 1; Experimental details). The reaction was conducted in toluene:aliquat solvent mixture (9.2:0.8 w/w) at 100 °C for 48 h using potassium carbonate as a base and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) as the catalyst. The structure of SFX1 was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, and elemental analysis (for experimental spectra, see ESI†). SFX1 was sufficiently soluble in routinely used, film-processing solvents such as chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform and dichlorobenzene. The thermal stability of SFX1 was observed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. It was noticed that thermal stability of SFX1 was excellent (decomposition and melting temperatures >200 °C), a result that suggests that the devices may be annealed at a higher temperature, if required (Fig. S1 for TGA and DSC curves, ESI†).

The absorption spectra of SFX1 in solution, pristine and blend films are represented in Fig. 2. In solution, SFX1 exhibited strong absorption with an absorption maximum (λmax) at 520 nm (molar extinction coefficient (MEC) = 52790 M−1 cm−1; solution concentration = 4.13 μM). As a pristine film on a cleaned glass substrate (as-cast, spin-coated film (∼70 nm at 2000 rpm)), SFX1 displayed broader absorption peak and λmax was red-shifted by ∼10 nm. This red-shift in the thin film form of SFX1 was more prominent in the range 550–650 nm, which is certainly advantageous when blended with the donor polymers such as PTB7. This further suggests an effective π–π stacking in the pristine film state. Not only is the extension of absorption complementary to donor polymer's (PTB7) absorption, but enables the blend to afford superior light-harvesting. As a result, the resultant blend film spectrum (PTB7:SFX1 1:1.2 w/w; ∼70 nm at 2000 rpm) revealed intense and broad absorption over the entire visible spectrum (380–800 nm).

The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to understand the theoretical density distributions, i.e. the HOMO and the LUMO distributions, on the molecular backbone and were performed using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs35 and the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. Apart from the fact that the HOMO and the LUMO densities were distinctly segregated, the LUMO density was evenly distributed over the entire molecular backbone (see Fig. 3), a finding that is somewhat customary with high-performing, small molecule NFAs.36–38 DFT calculations further supported the structure of SFX1 to be non-planar as the torsional angle between the thiophene ring planes (of DPP) and phenyl ring planes (of SFX) was ∼59° (see Fig. S2, ESI†). Such an arrangement is beneficial in the design of efficient NFAs as not only it unveils sufficient π-surface for effective electron transport, but can prevent strong intermolecular aggregation.39–41 The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) map of SFX1 as shown in Fig. S3, ESI† indicates a positive charge density on most of the molecular backbone, thus, forming the acceptor part of the molecule and showing its ability to accept electrons. We also conducted the time-dependent DFT calculations (TD-DFT) using the 6-31g(d) basis set. The computed absorption spectrum (see Fig. S3, ESI†) shows a major transition peak at 628 nm, which is primarily described as a transition from the HOMO to the LUMO (97%). The photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) measurement was carried out to estimate the HOMO energy level. It was performed on thin solid film to measure work function that corresponds to the HOMO level (for PESA curve, see Fig. S4, ESI†). The HOMO level resided at around −5.67 eV. For calculating the LUMO energy level, the absorption onset of pristine film of SFX1 (670 nm) was used. The HOMO energy level was also measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and we observed a similar trend to the results obtained in PESA experiment (CV HOMO: −5.50 eV (with reference to ferrocene/ferrocenium internal reference); PESA HOMO: −5.67 eV; Fig. S5, ESI† for cyclic voltammogram). Moreover, the LUMO and the band gap values were in close proximities too (CV LUMO: −3.50 eV; PESA LUMO: −3.82 eV; CV ΔE = 2 eV; PESA ΔE = 1.85 eV). The presence of oxidation and reduction potentials in the observed cyclo-voltammogram is reasonable, given the nature of SFX and DPP units. The values from PESA experiment were used to generate the energy level diagram (Fig. 4) where it is anticipated that the BHJ devices incorporating SFX1 and donor polymers, P3HT and PTB7, could afford a high Voc.

[Note: the HOMO values were taken from the PESA measurements, the band gaps values were calculated using the onsets of thin film absorption spectra, and the LUMO energies were calculated by adding the bandgap to the HOMO values.] 
We evaluated the performance of SFX1 as an NFA with two different, well-known and cheaply available donor polymers, P3HT and PTB7. Given the complementary absorption of PTB7 with SFX1, we predicted the device outcome to be superior when compared with the outcome based on P3HT-based devices. The main reason to test SFX1 with the latter polymer was to check its performance with the benchmark, well-studied polymer, and to understand its morphological behaviour. We chose a simple and well-studied device architecture, ITO/PEDOT:PSS (38 nm)/active layer (∼75 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm), mainly because of factors such as fabrication simplicity, processability, and reproducibility, where the active layer was a 1:1.2 blend of D/A (w/w; ∼75 nm at 2000 rpm), respectively. Moreover, we anticipated that an appropriately designed NFA should work with a variety of device architectures, for instance simple, inverted and tandem, if it were to be trialled for commercial applications. We used o-dichlorobenzene as the processing solvent and annealed the blend surfaces at 100 °C for 5 min.
Under the optimized weight ratios of 1:1.2 (D:A), the BHJ devices afforded very encouraging results. With the PTB7:SFX1 combination, the best cell parameters; Voc, short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE, reached 1.03 V, 14.52 mA cm−2, 0.63, and 9.42%, respectively. With the P3HT combination, the maximum PCE reached 6.55% post-annealing, which is ∼15% higher than the as-cast device prepared. For a comparative device (P3HT:PC61BM), the maximum PCE was 3.05% when the device was fabricated under similar annealing conditions. Clearly, the PTB7-based devices performed better than the devices based on P3HT, a result of the complementary absorption and superior blending of the former polymer with SFX1. The Voc > 1 V is an encouraging result for a single-junction BHJ device, especially when fabricated using the commercially available donor polymers and newly-designed NFAs based on DPP. Annealing of active surfaces at a higher temperature (120 °C) resulted in visible cracks and enhanced surface roughness, and the device performance dropped significantly (below 50%). The J–V curves are represented in Fig. 5, and the detailed device parameters together with the distribution curves of device efficiency are given in Table S1 and Fig. S6 (ESI†), respectively.

Solid and dashed lines correspond to pre- and post-annealing conditions, respectively, blend ratio = 1:1.2 D:A w/w. The device structure was: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (38 nm)/active layer (∼75 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm). 
We believe that the improvement in the performance of PTB7-based devices is mainly due to an increase in the Jsc, which not only is consistent with the broader blend film spectrum, but is evident from a stronger and broader response from the IPCE measurement. For the devices based on PTB7 and P3HT, the IPCE maxima of 68% (at 620 nm) and 56% (at 550 nm) were recorded, respectively (Fig. 6 for IPCE spectra). These spectra indicated that both the donor and acceptor components contributed to the observed IPCE and the Jsc. However, the PTB7-based IPCE spectrum was much broader and covered the entire visible spectrum (380 nm–840 nm), thus, suggesting superior light-harvesting ability and an excellent and favourable blending of the donor and acceptor components. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis in the tapping mode was carried out to observe blend surface morphology. The real surface morphologies (1:1.2 D:A w/w) are portrayed in Fig. 7. For PTB7-based as-cast blend, the surface appeared interwoven and well-organized with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.14 nm. The surface roughness became slightly greater in size upon annealing (2.33 nm), thus, suggesting a change in the morphology, typically from amorphous to somewhat crystalline. Such intermixed blend surfaces with morphologies such as granular, bush, fibrous, and worm are considered advantageous for efficient exciton dissociation and result in improved outcome of photovoltaic devices as is the case of PTB7:SFX1. On the contrary, the P3HT-based, as-cast blend was much rougher (RMS roughness = 5.13 nm), albeit the components suggested good miscibility. Clearly, the surface appeared amorphous and much irregular when compared with the PTB7-based, as-cast blend. The surface roughness of P3HT:SFX1 blend grew larger upon annealing (RMS roughness = 5.75 nm), a result that corroborates the marginal improvement of device efficiency (∼15% improvement in PCE).

It was apparent in our experimentation that SFX1 is a unique acceptor which is highly miscible with two different types of donor polymers, though the superior morphological properties of PTB7:SFX1 blend had a greater effect on device efficiency when compared with P3HT:SFX1 blend. TEM analysis confirmed the superiority of PTB7-based blend, which was observed to be featureless, slightly fibrous and well-interlaced, when compared with the blend based on P3HT (Fig. S7, ESI†). It is becoming more evident in the recent literature that featureless and fibrous surfaces usually result in improved current and fill factor values as is noted for the blend based on PTB7. Furthermore, the electron mobility measurement was carried out using the space charge limited current method (for details, see ESI†). A higher order of magnitude of electron mobility was observed for PTB7-based blend when compared with the blend based on P3HT [μe(PTB7:SFX1) = 8.63 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe(P3HT:SFX1) = 2.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1]. The higher mobility of PTB7-based blend is certainly beneficial to achieve higher values of FF and Jsc, and reflects in PCE. It is evident that the observance of good electron mobilities, excellent light-harvesting, adequate solubility, and an exceptional intermixing with the donor counterparts justify the idea of exploring 3D, non-planar acceptors for organic photovoltaic applications. This further highlights the importance of building blocks that have been utilized in designing SFX1. Considering the recent literature reports on the use of 3D NFAs based on non-planar formats, it is reasonable to mention that the device efficiency reported in this work is among the leading numbers, and provides a strong incentive for and validation of the current research strategy. The use of SFX1 with other donor polymers, such as PTB7-Th and PM6, is also in our pipe-line and is the work of near future.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a new, spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-functionalized, 3D acceptor material (coded as SFX1) was designed, synthesized, characterized and utilized for organic photovoltaic applications. The new material SFX1 is a non-planar structure, and exhibited good solubility, thermal stability, and promising optoelectronic properties. The energy levels were complementing those of the commercially available, cheap and two different types of donor polymers namely P3HT and PTB7. SFX1 produced well-intermixed blend surfaces with both donors, though the surface quality of PTB7-based blend was much superior. The device efficiency of PTB7:SFX1 combination (9.42%) is a result that is among the best efficiency numbers in the current literature using 3D acceptors based on non-planar formats and the commercially and cheaply available donor polymers. It is evident that not only is SFX1 a highly promising n-type material that enriches the library of 3D NFAs, but its design paves the way for other acceptor functionalities, such as naphthalene diimide and rhodanine, to be used at the peripheries of SFX unit.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Molecular structure of SFX1.	 

 	Scheme 1  Synthetic pathway to get SFX1.	 

 	Fig. 2  The absorption spectra of SFX1 in solution (chloroform; SFX1 S), as a neat film (SFX1 F), and as a blend with donor polymers (P3HT:SFX1 and PTB7:SFX1; blend composition = 1:1.2 D:A (w/w)).	 

 	Fig. 3  The orbital density distributions for the frontier molecular orbitals of SFX1. DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs and the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.	 

 	Fig. 4  The energy level diagram showing the alignment of different components of a BHJ device architecture based on SFX1 together with the commercially sourced donor polymers, P3HT and PTB7, and the conventionally used acceptor, PC61BM. [Note: the HOMO values were taken from the PESA measurements, the band gaps values were calculated using the onsets of thin film absorption spectra, and the LUMO energies were calculated by adding the bandgap to the HOMO values.]	 

 	Fig. 5  The J–V curves for the best BHJ devices based on SFX1 in blends with PTB7 and P3HT. Solid and dashed lines correspond to pre- and post-annealing conditions, respectively, blend ratio = 1:1.2 D:A w/w. The device structure was: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (38 nm)/active layer (∼75 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm).	 

 	Fig. 6  The IPCE curves of the best performing devices described in Fig. 5. The solid lines correspond to the IPCE spectra whereas the dotted lines represent blend film absorption profiles.	 

 	Fig. 7  AFM images for the unannealed (a and c) and annealed (b and d) blend surfaces of SFX1 with PTB7 (a and b) and P3HT (c and d). The RMS roughness of 2.33 nm and 5.75 nm were observed for the annealed blend surfaces of PTB7 and P3HT, respectively.
