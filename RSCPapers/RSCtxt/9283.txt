    , Accepted 12th September 2011First published on 28th September 2011AbstractReal-time monitoring of dye loading (N3 and N719) under continuous flow conditions on TiO2 photoanodes for dye-sensitized solar cells has been applied to quantitatively investigate dye uptake kinetics, demonstrating that static impregnation provides in all cases higher dye loading and, as a consequence, better working devices.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1 are attracting widespread academic and industrial interest as a low-cost alternative to conventional silicon solar cells. Since the pioneering work by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 the performances of DSSCs have been remarkably improved and overall power energy conversion efficiencies up to 11.1% for N719 dye,2 over 10% for Ru terpyridyl “black dye”,3 and 11.5% for C1014 have been reported. However, fabrication of state-of-the art devices is far from being a straightforward and reproducible process. Device production is indeed a rather complex multistep procedure in which a number of steps have not been fully rationalized yet. As a consequence, the fabrication of a DSSC is often based on the meticulous repetition of reported protocols and subjected to a large batch-to-batch variability making difficult to evaluate univocally the real performance of a new dye as well as the impact of an innovative electrolyte. From the industrial viewpoint, it is unlikely that fabrication procedures, originally optimized for prototype cells, are implemented to scale up the manufacture of DSSCs, not to mention the fact that a low reproducibility contrasts with the strict industrial quality control criteria.
This communication focuses on the dyeing process, which has a fundamental impact on both cell performance and scale-up perspective. Although recently faster procedures have been reported,5–8 a general dyeing procedure consists in soaking the photoanode into a dye solution at room temperature, with contact times from 15 to 20 hours. Reduction of sensitization times is a key-point, especially for DSSCs industrialization, but the control of other fundamental parameters, such as dye coverage and adsorption/desorption kinetics, is as well mandatory.

Dye loading is typically evaluated by ex situUV-Vis spectrophotometry after dye desorption, which is a time consuming and destructive protocol, while dye uptake kinetics are frequently determined by monitoring dye depletion in the solution above the TiO2 film by UV-Vis spectrophotometry measurements. A powerful way to reduce the bias associated with the monitoring procedures takes advantage of in situ techniques.7,9
Herein we describe a new tool for the real-time study of the TiO2 dyeing process under continuous-flow conditions by in situUV-Vis monitoring. A detailed description of the apparatus used in the study can be found in the ESI.†
The real-time approach allowed us to determine the kinetics of the dynamic dyeing process and to compare it with the traditional impregnation.

Dyes were allowed to flow through the cell at a constant rate flow (200 μL min−1), which allowed keeping the TiO2 substrate always in contact with a fresh solution rather than with a stagnant dyeing bath, in which concentration gradients are easily developed. The dye can thus be considered in a steady state concentration, simplifying the kinetic modelling of the process. Moreover, the use of an optically transparent TiO2 layer composed of nanoparticles with the diameter well below the critical diameter for light scattering in the visible spectral range allowed the direct monitoring of dye loading under transmission conditions along the entire film thickness. As a result, a signal with an optimal signal/noise ratio was recorded.
The dyeing process of two benchmark dyes for a DSSC, namely cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N3) and di-tetrabutylammoniumcis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) (N719) dyes, has been studied, considering two concentrations: 0.5 mM, usually adopted for dyeing by impregnation, and a tenfold more concentrated solution (5.0 mM).

        N719 and N3 showed markedly different uptake kinetics, the loading of N719 on TiO2 being much slower than N3 (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Time course of the dye uptake of N3 (left) and N719 (right) dyes at different dye concentrations (0.5 mM and 5.0 mM in ethanol). 
This difference can be explained considering that N719 dye carries two tetrabutylammonium counterions, whose sterical hindrance slows down the absorption process. However, for both dyes, the absorption kinetic curve is composed of two main contributions: a first rapid growth (in the range from tens to hundreds of seconds) followed by slow absorption increase (in the range of hours), indicating a two-step process for dye uptake.
The first step can be satisfactorily modeled by a pseudo-first order kinetic process: (1) (2) (3)where T refers to the sites of the TiO2 surface available for dye attachment, D and TD indicate the dye in solution and loaded onto the TiO2 surface, respectively. k1 is the kinetic constant for the direct reaction; the inverse process is not considered being assumed to be much slower. Since the dye concentration in flowing solution, [D], can be considered constant during the observation, its value is incorporated in k1, thus obtaining the pseudo-first order kinetic constant for dye absorption . In addition, the free sites on titania, [T], are related to the total sites initially available, [T]0, and to those already occupied, [TD], by the following mass balance (eqn (4)): [T] = [T]0 − [TD](4)The second contribution to the loading curve was a slow linear growth of the dye uptake, which can be fitted with a zero order kinetic law: [TD] = [TD]′ + k2t(5)where [TD]′ refers to the amount of dye loaded at the time when the absorption kinetics changes from the fast to the slow stage.
Two step kinetics for N3 uptake has been firstly remarked by Fillinger and Parkinson,10 who explained it due to the two carboxylic groups involved in binding the TiO2 surface. More recently, Holliman et al.6 observed the same behaviour, attributing it to the several processes that are believed to take place during the dye loading, namely rapid surface adsorption along with slower mass transfer.
As expected, the pseudo-first order phase becomes faster upon increasing the dye concentration (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the slower contribution (Fig. 2b) is independent from the concentration of the dye, in line with a zero-order profile.
 Fig. 2  Fitting of the dye uptake curves for an N3 molecule at two different concentrations: (a) fast initial phase fitting with eqn (3); (b) slow kinetic regime fitting with eqn (5). Low (0.5 mM, full circles) and high (5.0 mM, open circles) dye concentrations are applied. Solid lines are fittings of the experimental data. 
Final dye loading obtained by static impregnation is not affected by dye concentration (entries 1 and 2 in Table 1). In contrast, under continuous flow conditions, the loading of the N3 increases by 30% upon changing the concentration of the dyeing solution from 0.5 mM (entry 3) to 5.0 mM (entry 4). We note here that the dye loading in flow is markedly lower than the one under static conditions in both the cases under study.
This difference can be rationalized in terms of the kinetic behavior of the dyeing process. Under flow conditions, the quasi-plateau regime, reached rather quickly, corresponds to the end of the fast, pseudo-first order, kinetic phase of the N3 dye uptake. During this stage, only about 60–70% of the maximum amount of dye is loaded onto the TiO2 layer. As a confirmation, an estimation of the amount of the dye loaded under flow conditions at 20 hours on the basis of the zero-order kinetic constant led to a value comparable with that achieved under static conditions.
The behavior of dye N719 is markedly different since both dynamic and static dyeing yield a similar dye loading upon concentration increase. This is likely due to a leveling effect resulting from the slower binding kinetics of N719 with respect to N3. By comparing the pseudo-first order kinetic constants, an increase of almost one order of magnitude in the value of  under dynamic loading (from 2.8 to 22 s−1 by increasing dye concentration from loading at 0.5 to 5.0 mM) was recorded for N3. In the case of N719,  increase was not as relevant as recorded for N3 (0.4 to 1.0 s−1). This implies that, for short dyeing times, the rate in loading for N719 is not fast enough to allow a significant increase in the overall dye content.
Sequential UV-Vis measurements carried out at increasing dyeing times for static loading using a 0.5 mM dye solution indicate almost the same value of  for static as well as dynamic impregnation in the case of N719, while a remarkable increase (0.9 to 2.8 s−1) was recorded for N3. The shape of the entire loading curves for N3 and N719 dyes is the same for both loading methods and the zero-order kinetic constants for N3 and N719 are almost identical. These data imply that the same mechanism is operating for both dye uptake.
The  increase from static to dynamic loading of N3 is most likely due to the slower mass transfer process taking place when N3 is immobilized onto titania by static impregnation: concentration of dye molecules available for grafting is depleted at the surface contact between dye solution and TiO2. In the case of dynamic uptake, no depleted regions are present at the interface, due to the continuous refilling of dye molecules by the flowing solution.
The value of  is almost the same for N719 in static and dynamic uptake for 0.5 mM solution: probably as a result of the ammonium counterions that slow down the uptake rate. This latter effect results thus predominant if compared to the mass transfer process (in contrast, N3, though still binding with two carboxylic functions,11 possesses four acidic groups for which the absence of counterions translates into faster kinetics).
Interaction of dye molecules with the TiO2 surface was investigated with infrared spectroscopy in order to verify if different loading approaches could result in different grafting modes. However, infrared analyses showed no differences between cells sensitized with different techniques, thus indicating that N719 and N3 dyes graft on the titania surface in only one way, irrespectively of the sensitization technique.
Different dye loadings are reflected by dissimilar photoconversion efficiencies (PCE) for DSSCs fabricated under static or dynamic impregnation (Table 1). For both N3 and N719, photoanodes prepared by static impregnation presented slightly better photovoltaic performances than those prepared in flow. This result is in line with the lower dye loading achieved under dynamic impregnation. In all the cases, the concentrated dyeing solutions led to improved functional properties. In particular, differences of about 9% and 12.5% in photoconversion efficiency have been recorded for N3 and N719 dyes, respectively, for the best operating cells by different impregnation protocols.

This study sharply points out that care should be taken when comparing dynamic and static impregnation. The two approaches give indeed very similar results only if compared homogenously in terms of dye loading and contact time.
Nevertheless, we do believe that dynamic sensitization is a powerful tool towards the reproducible fabrication of DSSCs through the full control of the critical parameters of the dyeing process. Moreover, and perhaps more relevant, it is expected to be strategic for the co-sensitization of photoanodes with dyes of complementary absorption spectra.12–15 A sequential loading of more than one dye at concentrations chosen a priori is expected to be possible under flow conditions.
