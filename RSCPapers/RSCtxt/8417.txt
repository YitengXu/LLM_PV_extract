1. Introduction
The research on nonlinear optics has received much interest since the birth of lasers in the 1960s. Nonlinear optics mainly involves the study of nonlinear effects produced by the interaction between light and materials. Nonlinear optical (NLO) technology not only helps people understand the NLO phenomena, but also enables a variety of novel nonlinear photonic devices such as lasers,1 all-optical switches,2 optical limiters,3 optical modulators,4 Kerr shutters,5 photodetectors,6 and optical memories.7 The nonlinear photonic devices play important roles in light generation, propagation, and detection. For instance, compared with the traditional electro-optical switch, the all-optical switch has the advantage of ultrafast time response, which can meet the needs of high-speed all-optical communications.8 Optical modulators can be used for the generation of ultrashort pulsed lasers, which are useful in medicine9 and processing of industrial materials.10 Current nonlinear photonic devices are mainly based on traditional NLO materials such as crystals and semiconductors.11–17 However, there are some limits in using the traditional NLO materials. For instance, nowadays the molecular beam epitaxy-grown semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors are widely used for the generation of ultrashort pulsed lasers due to their high flexibility and stability.1 But semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors require complex preparation protocols and suffer from high preparation cost as well as narrow operation bandwidth. Moreover, for better integration into chips in the future, smaller nanoscale photonic devices need to be designed. Therefore, developing novel candidate materials with facile fabrication and integration, broadband operation bandwidth, and outstanding NLO performance is highly desirable for next-generation photonic nanodevices.
Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (also known as quantum dots) have been widely studied for several decades due to their facile preparation, unique physicochemical features, and extensive applications.18 In terms of fluorescence properties, colloidal semiconductor NCs show high luminescence efficiency, narrow luminescence bandwidth, and wide color gamut. In addition to their fluorescence properties, colloidal semiconductor NCs also exhibit outstanding NLO performance. Colloidal semiconductor NCs show size-tunable exciton resonance, strong NLO properties, and ultrafast relaxation time, as well as facile preparation and integration, etc., making them a class of promising NLO materials for photonic nanodevices.19–25
There are a few review articles on colloidal semiconductor NCs.26–36 However, the recent advances on the NLO properties and related nonlinear photonic device applications of colloidal semiconductor NCs have not been systematically summarized. The research on the nonlinear optics and ultrafast photonics of colloidal semiconductor NCs is still increasing and a related comprehensive review is urgently needed. In this review article, the recent advances of colloidal semiconductor NCs for third-order NLO properties and the related NLO device applications are summarized. Four classes of colloidal semiconductor NCs are introduced, including the conventional metal chalcogenide NCs (ME, M = Cd, Zn, Pb, and E = S, Se, Te), emerging plasmonic semiconductor NCs (e.g., Cu2−xS and Cu2−xSe), metal halide perovskite NCs (e.g., CH3NH3PbBr3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3), and quantum dots (QDs) derived from two-dimensional (2D) layered materials (e.g., black phosphorous, MoS2, and Ti3C2 MXene). The structure and bandgap of these colloidal semiconductor NCs are provided. The liquid-phase synthetic methods for these colloidal semiconductor NCs are introduced. In the following, the third-order NLO properties of these colloidal semiconductor NCs are summarized. Afterward, the related nonlinear photonic device applications of these colloidal semiconductor NCs are demonstrated. Finally, the potential challenges and prospects of these colloidal semiconductor NCs for NLO properties and practical optical device applications are discussed (Fig. 1).

2. Basic properties of several colloidal semiconductor NCs
Colloidal semiconductor NCs have been widely studied for several decades due to their unique physicochemical features and widespread applications. Most of the colloidal semiconductor NCs maintain similar lattice structures with their bulk counterparts and may have improved or novel physicochemical properties due to the quantum confinement effect. Four classes of colloidal semiconductor NCs have been extensively studied in the field of nonlinear optics and ultrafast photonics, including the conventional metal chalcogenide NCs, emerging plasmonic semiconductor NCs, metal halide perovskite NCs, and QDs derived from 2D layered materials (2D-QDs). The structure and bandgap energy are two fundamental factors that affect the optical properties of colloidal semiconductor NCs. Therefore, in this section, we introduce the basic properties of these four classes of colloidal semiconductor NCs from the aspect of structure, bandgap energy, etc.
2.1 Conventional metal chalcogenide NCs
Conventional metal chalcogenide semiconductor NCs mainly refer to II–VI or IV–VI compounds, CdE, ZnE, and PbE (E = S, Se, Te). CdE and ZnE compound semiconductors exist in either the cubic zinc blende or hexagonal wurtzite structure. PbE compounds exhibit a face-centered cubic structure at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 2(a).37 These conventional metal chalcogenide semiconductor NCs have covalent chemical bonds, making their crystal structures stable in common solvents such as water and toluene, which is important for practical applications. The bandgaps of bulk ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdSe, and CdTe are around 3.16–4.25 eV, 2.58 eV, 2.26 eV, 2.42 eV, 1.74 eV, and 1.61 eV, respectively.38 PbS, PbSe, and PbTe have narrow bandgaps of about 0.41 eV,39 0.3 eV,40 and 0.32 eV,41 respectively.

The conventional metal chalcogenide semiconductor NCs are one of the most studied NCs in the past thirty years. The first synthesis of the colloidal semiconductor NCs was the preparation of CdS NCs in an aqueous solution by Brus and coworkers in 1983.42 In this report, the size-dependent electronic properties were also investigated.42 Since then, a lot of research has been performed on colloidal semiconductor NCs. In general, when the size of the semiconductor NCs reduces, the corresponding bandgap would increase due to the quantum size effect. Besides, changing their elemental compositions, introducing dopants, and constructing core/shell heterostructures (type I, type II, and reverse type I) or composite heterostructures can also adjust the bandgap of the NCs. Overall, the conventional metal chalcogenide semiconductor NCs are generally direct bandgap semiconductors with bandgaps in a broad range from about 4.68 eV43 to 0.3 eV.44 Furthermore, it is known that quantum confinement is realized when the radius of the semiconductor nanoscale materials is comparable to their exciton Bohr radius in bulk materials.45 PbS, PbSe, and PbTe have large exciton Bohr radii of 18 nm,39 46 nm,46 and over 100 nm,47 respectively. Thus, the large exciton Bohr radius of PbE (E = S, Se, Te) makes the quantum confinement effect achievable with a relatively large size.48 Due to their attractive optical characteristics, the conventional metal chalcogenide NCs are usually applied in biomedical49 and optoelectronic areas.50,51
2.2 Emerging plasmonic semiconductor NCs
Some heavily doped semiconductor NCs show a strong absorption band in the infrared (IR) wavelength region due to their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties.52 These LSPR-active semiconductor NCs can be named plasmonic semiconductor NCs.29,30,52 Plasmonic semiconductor NCs mainly include copper chalcogenide (e.g., Cu2−xS), and metal oxide (e.g., WO3−x, MoO3−x, In:CdO, Al:ZnO, and Sn:In2O3) NCs.30 Among them, Cu2−xE (E = S, Se, Te) NCs are the most studied. Therefore, here we mainly focus on the Cu2−xE (E = S, Se, Te) NCs. Although much work on the preparation of Cu2−xS NCs had been performed earlier, it was the report in 2009 by Zhao and coworkers that initiated the research in the field of plasmonic copper chalcogenide NCs.53 Cu2−xE (E = S, Se, Te) NCs are self-doped NCs, where the vacancies in copper result in p-type doping.54 The crystal structure of Cu2−xE (E = S, Se, Te) is stoichiometry dependent.55,56 For example, there are eight different crystal structures in Cu2−xS according to the different copper vacancy concentrations, which are listed in a recent review article.30 For example, Fig. 2(b and c) show the crystal structures of Cu1.8S with a cubic phase57 and CuS with a hexagonal phase.22 The bandgap of Cu2−xE (E = S, Se, Te) also exhibits stoichiometry dependence, for instance, when the factor (2 − x) in Cu2−xS is varied from 1 and 2, the bandgap reduces from 2 to 1.2 eV.56
One main feature of Cu2−xE (E = S, Se, Te) NCs is that the LSPRs and quantum-confined excitons can be realized within the same NCs, which provides the possibility for strong interaction between photonics and electronics, with implications for applications in many areas.55,58,59 For instance, the exciton peak of Cu2−xS NCs with an average size of 2–6 nm blue shifts compared with their bulk counterparts.55 Meanwhile, these NCs show LSPR properties in the IR window, which arise from p-type carriers in vacancy-doped Cu2−xS NCs.55 Besides, the Cu2−xE (E = S, Se, Te) NCs generally have a lower free carrier density compared with the common noble metal nanoscale materials (e.g., Au, Ag), resulting in Cu2−xE (E = S, Se, Te) NCs with tunable LSPR wavelengths in the IR spectral window from about 1 to 7 μm by simply changing the doping concentration.55,58,60–64 The easy accessibility and wide tunability of the LSPR peak in the IR spectral region enable the Cu2−xE (E = S, Se, Te) NCs as promising candidates for applications in various fields such as photothermal therapy63 and luminescence enhancement.30
2.3 Emerging metal halide perovskite NCs
Metal halide perovskites have a history of more than 120 years. However, only in 2009 they began to attract increasing interest worldwide due to their outstanding performance in solar cells.65 3D metal halide perovskites have the chemical formula of ABX3, where A is CH3NH3+ (MA), CH(NH2)2+ (FA), Cs+ or Rb+, B is Pb, Sn, or Ge ions, and X is Cl, Br, I, or mixed halogen ions. Metal halide perovskite NCs include organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic metal halide perovskite NCs. The crystal structure of the 3D cubic phase metal halide perovskite consists of a 3D network of corner-sharing [BX6]4− octahedra, where B ions locate in the center of the octahedra, and A ions fill the voids created by the eight nearest octahedra (Fig. 2(d)).66
Colloidal organic–inorganic hybrid MAPbBr3 perovskite NCs were first prepared by Schmidt et al. in 2014.67 Soon after, all-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, mixed halogen) perovskite NCs were prepared by Protesescu et al. in 2015.68 One attractive characteristic of metal halide perovskite NCs is that the direct bandgap of metal halide perovskite NCs can be easily tuned from about 1.3 to 3.02 eV by changing their elemental composition.68–70 Specifically, the bandgap of perovskite NCs is tunable from 1.69 eV (MAPbI3) to 3.05 eV (MAPbCl3),71 1.77 eV (CsPbI3) to 3.02 eV (CsPbCl3),68 and from 1.68 eV (FAPbI3) to 3 eV (FAPbCl3).72 Compared with the influence of the X-site ion on the bandgap of the perovskite NCs, the A-site cation has less effect on the bandgap. For example, (EA)x(MA)1−xPbBr3 NCs (x = 0–1) have bandgap tunable from 2.38 eV to 2.94 eV by changing their x value.73 Furthermore, the B-site cation also plays a role in adjusting the bandgap of the perovskite NCs. For instance, when Pb2+ is replaced by Sn2+, the bandgap obtained from the emission wavelength of the resulting CsSnX3 perovskite NCs decreases from 2.8 eV (Cl) to 1.3 eV (I).70 Metal halide perovskite NCs exhibit excellent optical properties such as large absorption coefficients and high emission efficiency74 and have potential applications in optoelectronics75–77 and photovoltaic devices.78 However, metal halide perovskite NCs suffer from stability problems when they are in contact with air, water, heat, or light. Therefore, a great deal of research has been devoted to improve their stabilities, such as using other cations with suitable tolerance factors (e.g., FA, Cs) to replace MA ions.79 In addition, the surface passivation and encapsulation strategies are also used for improving the stabilities of metal halide perovskite NCs, as mentioned in a recent review article.80
2.4 Emerging 2D-QDs
2D-QDs are smaller forms of their native 2D layered materials in terms of the lateral size.81 The first report on 2D-QDs was the colloidal MoS2 and WS2 quantized nanoclusters with particle sizes in the range of 1–3.5 nm, which were fabricated by the cleavage of their van der Waals (vdW) layers via penetration by acetonitrile solvent molecules.82 2D-QDs exhibit excellent physical, chemical, and biological properties due to quantum confinement effect and edge effect while maintaining most intrinsic properties of their 2D layered forms, and have aroused intensive interest in the past few years.81,83 Until now, lots of 2D-QDs have been theoretically predicted and experimentally prepared,81 showing applications in catalysis,83 energy,84 photonic and optoelectronic devices,45,85 and medicine.86 Here, we introduce the commonly studied 2D-QDs in the fields of nonlinear optics and ultrafast photonics, which mainly include graphene QDs (GQDs), black phosphorous QDs (BPQDs), antimonene QDs (AQDs), bismuth QDs (BiQDs), transition metal chalcogenide QDs (TMD QDs), and transition metal carbide or nitride MXene QDs (MQDs).
Generally, 2D-QDs maintain similar lattice structures to their 2D counterparts. The 2D layered materials possess intralayer covalent bonds and weak interlayer vdW interactions. Graphene has a flat hexagonal honeycomb structure with single-atom thickness (Fig. 2(e)).87 Unlike graphene with a flat structure, phosphorene shows a folded structure (Fig. 2(f)).88 Each P atom binds with three other P atoms in the same layer, while it binds with the fourth P atom at a parallel adjacent layer, resulting in an in-plane anisotropic structure of phosphorene.89 However, BP is easily oxidized in air. Antimony and bismuth also belong to the group V elements. Theoretical calculation results show that 2D antimonene and bismuthene are stable under ambient conditions.90,91 Different from the stable α phase orthorhombic structure of phosphorene, the most stable form of antimonene and bismuthene is the β phase rhombohedral structure with a hexagonal lattice with the buckled surface.90,91 The crystal structure of layered rhombohedral antimony is shown in Fig. 2(g).92 Theoretical calculation results show that there is a change from a semimetal to an indirect semiconductor when the thickness of gray antimony is reduced to a monolayer.90,93 Similar to antimony, bulk bismuth is a semimetal, while the single-layer bismuthene is a semiconductor.94,95 TMD is a type of 2D layered material with the chemical formula of MX2, in which M is a transition metal element (e.g., Mo, W, or Re), and X is S, Se, or Te. In the X–M–X unit layer, the M atomic layer is sandwiched between two X atomic layers (Fig. 2(h)).96 Some TMDs (e.g.; MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2) are semiconductors with direct bandgaps in monolayers and indirect bandgaps in bulk materials.97,98 MXenes have the general chemical formula, Mn+1XnTx, in which M is a transition metal element, X is C or N, Tx is O, OH, or F, and n is 1, 2, and 3.99 Ti3C2Tx MXene was first isolated in 2011100 and several different MXenes have been experimentally prepared or theoretically predicted considering different factors such as composition and surface groups. From the side view, the MXene monolayer is composed of 2n + 1 sheets (n = 1, 2, and 3), where the X sheets are sandwiched by two M sheets (Fig. 2(i)).101
For 2D-QDs, the lateral size has influence on the bandgap energy due to the quantum confinement effect. For instance, graphene is a semimetal with a zero bandgap, but GQDs show semiconductor properties with a discrete bandgap.102 The bandgap of MoS2 QDs is ∼4.56 eV, which is higher than that of 2D MoS2.103 The bandgap of bulk MXene was about 0.1 eV, while that of Ti3C2Tx MQDs was about 2.84 eV, obtained from the absorption result.24 Recently, the influence of size on the bandgap of Ti3C2O2 QDs has been studied theoretically. Results showed that the energy gap of Ti3C2O2 QDs with H passivation changes from 2.76 to 1.14 eV when the lateral size increases.104 In addition to size, the bandgap of some 2D-QDs can also be tuned by other factors such as doping,105 and surface functionalization.106 For instance, Na doped AQDs were prepared with a direct bandgap of 0.88 eV.107 2D-QDs show a broad range of bandgap energy from the ultraviolet (UV) to IR spectral region, suggesting their potential applications in a broad spectral region.
3. Synthesis
Various methods have been used for the preparation of colloidal semiconductor NCs, such as the liquid-phase method and vapor phase epitaxial growth method. Although the vapor phase epitaxial growth method has been successfully used for the synthesis of size-tunable NCs, there are some drawbacks such as the use of expensive experimental instruments and difficulty in separating NCs from the substrates. The liquid-phase preparation method is facile and has been widely applied for the preparation of various monodispersed NCs in different solvents. The liquid-phase synthetic method consists of the bottom-up and top-down methods. In the following, the main liquid-phase preparation methods of colloidal semiconductor NCs are provided.
3.1 The hot-injection (HI) method
The HI method is one of the most commonly used bottom-up methods for the synthesis of colloidal semiconductor NCs. The HI method was first reported for the synthesis of monodispersed CdM (M = S/Se/Te) NCs by Murray et al. in 1993.108 Later, one great improvement for greener synthesis was reported by Peng et al., who used little toxic CdO instead of Cd(CH3)2 to prepare CdM (M = S/Se/Te) NCs.109,110 Typically, the precursor solution is rapidly injected into a preheated mixture solution containing the remaining precursors, ligands (or surfactants), and organic solvents, followed by a fast and complete mixing of the mixture under vigorous stirring (Fig. 3(a)111). The HI method has been used for the preparation of various colloidal semiconductor NCs including CdE,111–114 ZnE,115–117 PbE,47,118,119 Ag2E (E = S, Se, Te),120–122 InP,123 CuInS2,124 AgInS2,124 Cu–Sn–S,125 Cu2−xS,55 Cu3−xP,58 Sn:In2O3,126 CsPbX3,68 Cs4PbX6,127 MAPbBr3,128 MAPbI3,128 FAPbBr3,129 FAPbI3,130 FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3,130 FAPb(Cl1−xBrx)3,131 and Cs2SnI6132 NCs. Alloyed, doped, and heterostructure NCs such as PbS/graphene oxide,133 PbS/graphene,134 CdSe/ZnS/CdSe,135 Ag2SxSe1−x,136 InP/ZnS,137 Mn doped ZnSe,138 PbS–MAPbI3,139 and PbS–FAPbI3140 NCs can also be obtained. By changing the ratio of the chemicals (precursors, ligands, and solvents),55,141 the reaction time110 and temperature,142 the size of the metal chalcogenide NCs prepared using the HI method can be adjusted. In contrast, the nucleation and growth kinetics of the metal halide perovskite NCs are very fast (usually within a few seconds) due to the ionic nature of the chemical bonds in metal halide perovskite NCs. Therefore, the size of the CsPbX3 NCs prepared using the HI method can be adjusted by changing the type and ratio of the added chemicals,129 and the reaction temperature.68,129

The nucleation and growth mechanism based on the LaMer model is widely used to describe the kinetics of colloidal semiconductor NCs.143 A general procedure for the synthesis of monodispersed and uniform NCs requires fast nucleation and a relatively slow growth process. The nucleation time depends on the injection rate and the mass transfer in the reaction systems.144 Therefore, rapid precursor injection and vigorous stirring would lead to a short nucleation time.144 Generally, the formation process of NCs consists of three stages.56,145 In the first stage, the precursors react immediately to form monomers in the reaction system. In the second stage, the supersaturated monomers aggregate into nuclei until the monomer concentration drops below a critical threshold. In the third stage, the pre-formed nuclei grow into NCs without the formation of new nuclei. However, the LaMer mechanism did not describe the particle size evolution during the growth stage. Soon after that, Reiss and coworkers reported a diffusion model and the mechanism of focusing the particle size distribution in the growth stage, that is, the smaller particles grow more quickly than the bigger particles when there are plenty of monomers.146 If the growth is stopped when it is still in the size-focusing regime, NCs would have a narrow size distribution.74 However, sometimes, other competition growth processes such as the Ostwald ripening process should also be considered.56
By employing the HI method, monodispersed colloidal compound semiconductor NCs with high crystallinity, narrow size distribution, and good control over composition and size can be obtained. However, the HI method usually requires high temperature and is not suitable for large scale preparation at one time. Additionally, the NCs obtained using the HI method are usually dispersed in an organic solvent and further modification steps are usually required to make them well-dispersed in an inorganic solvent such as water for special applications.
3.2 Aqueous synthesis
To prepare water-soluble NCs, the aqueous bottom-up synthetic method is usually employed. The earliest method used to synthesize colloidal semiconductor NCs was to prepare CdS NCs in an aqueous system in the 1980s.42,147 Generally, the aqueous synthesis of semiconductor NCs is realized through a precipitation reaction between cationic and anionic precursors in the presence of stabilizers under flux conditions with a suitable solution pH value.148 A water-soluble thiol molecule like thioglycolic acid or 3-mercaptopropionic acid was usually used as the stabilizer. The hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 3(b)),149 microwave-assisted heating,150 or photochemical synthesis22 was also employed for improvement of the aqueous synthesis of colloidal semiconductor NCs. In the hydrothermal method, the precursors and suitable solvents are transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and the reaction takes place at high temperature and high pressure. The hydrothermal synthesis is helpful for materials that are difficult to crystallize at lower temperatures. By using the microwave strategy, heat can be distributed more evenly throughout the reactor and the material synthesis usually occurs in a very short time, even in minutes. In photochemical synthesis, chemical reactions could take place under photo-irradiation at a mild synthesis temperature without heating. The aqueous synthetic method has been used for preparing various colloidal semiconductor NCs, including CdE,151–153 ZnE,154–156 Ag2E157–159 (E = S, Se, Te), PbS,160 PbSe,161 AgInS2,162 CuInS2,163 Cu2−xS,22 Cu2−xSe,164 graphene QDs,165–167 Mo2S QDs,168–176 and MXene QDs.177–182 In addition, alloyed, doped, and core/shell heterostructure NCs such as Zn1−xCdxSe,156 Ag:CdTe,152 and CdTe/CdS183 NCs were also prepared via the aqueous route. By adjusting the type of stabilizer,184 the concentration of the chemicals,185 the reaction temperature186 and time,187 the size of the conventional metal chalcogenide NCs prepared using the aqueous based synthesis can be changed.
The hard and soft (Lewis) acids and bases (HSAB) theory could be used to qualitatively understand the thermodynamics of the aqueous synthesis of semiconductor NCs. Based on HSAB theory, the aqueous synthesis of semiconductor NCs is mainly based on the Lewis acid/base reactions. Generally, hard acids react more quickly and form stronger bonds with hard bases, while soft acids react more quickly and form stronger bonds with soft bases. In this context, HSAB theory is helpful to qualitatively understand the reactions involved and the stability of compounds. Furthermore, the classical LaMer model containing three stages is also widely used to understand the growth kinetics of the aqueous synthesis of semiconductor NCs.143 However, the cation and anion as major monomers can react very fast after the injection of the precursor solution, leading to the rapid consumption of the monomers. The Ostwald ripening process would be dominated in the growth stage if there are not plenty of monomers, resulting in NCs with a broader size distribution.56
The aqueous method usually uses more environmentally friendly materials and the experimental temperature is usually lower than that of the HI method. The products could be dispersed in water. However, the size distribution of the NCs is usually broader than that obtained using the HI method. The optical properties such as the luminescence quantum yield of the products obtained through the aqueous routes also need to be improved.
3.3 Ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method
The bottom-up LARP method is often used for the preparation of metal hybrid perovskite NCs. In 2015, Zhong's group reported the LARP synthesis of MAPbX3 QDs for the first time.189 Typically, a mixture of MABr and PbBr2 was dissolved in the polar solvent DMF (good solvent) with the ligands n-octylamine and oleic acid. The mixed solution was added dropwise into the nonpolar solvent toluene (poor solvent) under intense stirring (Fig. 3(c)).188 The solvents induce an instantaneous supersaturation and lead to rapid nucleation and growth of metal halide perovskite NCs. The as-prepared MAPbBr3 QDs are nonstoichiometric with a Br-rich surface. Besides, MAPbCl3 and MAPbI3 QDs were also prepared by changing the precursors or cation change. The LARP method has been used for the synthesis of both the organic–inorganic hybrid and all-organic metal halide perovskite NCs, including MAPbX3,189 FAPbX3,190 CsPbX3,191 Cs3Bi2X9,192 CsxFA1−xPbX3 (X = Cl/Br/I),193 MA3Bi2Br9,194 Cs3Sb2Br9,195 CsPb2Br5,196 and FAxMA1−xPbX3 (X = Br/I).197 By varying the precursor198 and ligand concentrations,199 the size of the metal halide perovskite NCs can be changed. The LARP method is based on the supersaturated recrystallization mechanism. Ions can be spontaneously separated from the solution and a new crystal would be formed when the ion concentration suppresses the saturated concentration. The experiment is performed at room temperature. However, the concentration of metal halide perovskite NCs obtained using the LARP method is low. Additionally, large amounts of toxic solvents are usually required in this method.
3.4 Top-down liquid-phase exfoliation method
The top-down liquid-phase exfoliation method is usually used to prepare 2D-QDs. While the bottom-up synthesis of 2D-QDs makes use of small-molecule precursors, the top-down method mainly uses the bulk 2D layered materials as the precursors. In the bottom-up synthesis of 2D-QDs, small-molecule precursors are aggregated to form 2D-QDs in aqueous or nonaqueous solvents through hydrothermal/microwave (introduced in Section 3.2) or solvothermal route. In the top-down methods, 2D-QDs are usually exfoliated from their native 2D layered materials via chemical or physical routes, including ultrasonication, electrochemistry, pulsed laser ablation, hydrothermal/solvothermal/microwave, and intercalation methods. Generally, functional groups and defects were first created on 2D nanosheets in these routes, resulting in the exfoliation of 2D layered materials into smaller 2D-QDs.81 Here, we mainly introduce the top-down liquid-phase exfoliation method for the synthesis of 2D-QDs.
The ultrasound-assisted technique is one common method used for the exfoliation of various bulk 2D materials into 2D-QDs. In this method, the bulk 2D material sources are mixed with suitable solvents under ultrasonication conditions. The ultrasonication energy breaks the vdW forces of the 2D layered materials, resulting in the exfoliation of the bulk 2D layered materials into 2D-QDs (Fig. 4(a)).200 During ultrasonication exfoliation, an ice bath is often used to maintain a low temperature. Besides, choosing a suitable solvent is important to determine the quality of the final product. The surface energy of the solvent is required to match that of the bulk 2D materials, resulting in effective exfoliation with a minimal energy cost.201,202N-Monthylpyrrolidinone (NMP) is a common solvent used for ultrasonication exfoliation.203,204 In addition to NMP, other organic or inorganic solvents were also employed for the exfoliation of 2D-QDs.205–207 The ultrasonication method usually requires a long time, and the yield of 2D-QDs is usually low. Therefore, sometimes, hydrothermal/solvothermal/microwave treatment, grinding, or probe sonication is used in combination with ultrasonication to help enhance the exfoliation efficiency of 2D-QDs. Various 2D-QDs such as GQDs,208 BPQDs,209 AQDs,210 BiQDs,211 TMD QDs,204 and MQDs212 were prepared. 2D-QDs prepared by using the ultrasonication exfoliation technique at a higher ultrasonication power or longer time usually exhibit smaller lateral sizes.213 In addition, as the centrifugation rate of the 2D-QD dispersions increases,214 2D-QDs with a smaller lateral size can also be obtained.

Other top-down liquid-phase exfoliation methods have also been used for the synthesis of 2D-QDs. In the electrochemistry method, the generation of free radicals leads to the exfoliation of the bulk 2D material into QDs. The electrochemistry methods have been used for preparation of GQDs,215 TMD QDs,216 phosphorene QDs (Fig. 4(b)),217 Na-doped AQDs,107 fluorinated BPQDs,218 and N-containing phosphorene QDs.217 The top-down hydrothermal/solvothermal/microwave method has been used for the fabrication of GQDs,219 TMD QDs,220 MQDs,221 and BPQDs (Fig. 4(c)).222 Moreover, S and N-codoped, N-doped, and S-doped MQDs were also obtained by using a top-down hydrothermal process.223,224 The pulsed laser ablation method has been used for the preparation of GQDs,227 BPQDs,228 MoS2 QDs,229 and WS2 QDs (Fig. 4(d)).225 In the intercalation-assisted method, the alkali metal intercalates into the interlayers of the 2D materials, resulting in a larger layer distance and weaker vdW force. The intercalation-assisted method has been used for synthesis of TMD QDs (Fig. 4(e)),226 MQDs230 and monolayered GQDs.231
The ultrasonication assisted method is simple; however, it usually requires a long sonication time and the yield is usually low. The hydrothermal/solvothermal/microwave method is simple and controllable. However, the disadvantage of the hydrothermal/solvothermal/microwave method is that it usually requires a high temperature. The pulsed laser ablation strategy is simple and ultrafast. However, this method needs a pulsed laser equipment. The electrochemistry method has the advantage of low cost for mass production. However, the electrochemistry method usually requires a complex post-treatment process. The intercalation-assisted method is suggested to be the most suitable method for the large-scale synthesis of monolayer 2D-QDs. However, the intercalation-assisted method may introduce extra elements.
4. NLO properties of colloidal semiconductor NCs
Nonlinear optics has aroused much interest since the observation of optical harmonic generation by Franken et al. in quartz in 1961.232 The third-order NLO effects such as saturable absorption (SA), two-photon absorption (TPA), and optical Kerr effect are the commonly observed processes and are thus widely used in various fields such as ultrashort pulse laser,233 imaging,234 and optical switch.235 Compared with their bulk counterparts, semiconductor NCs usually exhibit stronger NLO response due to the modulation of their electronic structure and electronic density of state by structural low dimensions.236 In this section, the recent progress on the third-order NLO properties of the colloidal semiconductor NCs is introduced.
4.1 Fundamentals of nonlinear optics and experimental methods
Under the excitation of an intense laser, the electric polarization intensity vector P of the material can be written as follows:P = ε0χ(1)E + ε0χ(2)E2 + ε0χ(3)E3 +⋯where, E is the incident electric field, and ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant. χ(1), χ(2), and χ(3) are the linear, second- and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities, respectively. χ(1) describes the linear optical effects. If the incident light field is high, χ(n) (n ≥ 2) becomes significant. χ(2) is related to second-order NLO effects. χ(3) is related to third-order NLO effects. χ(n) (n typically larger than 5) is related to n-th-order NLO effects. Generally, the interaction strength of the NLO process decreases with n. The second-order NLO effects occur in a material that lacks the inversion symmetry center. On the contrary, third-order NLO effects are allowed in all materials. In this section, we mainly introduce the third-order NLO effects and corresponding parameters. The third-order NLO susceptibility χ(3) is a complex number with a real and imaginary part. Re(χ(3)) (the real part of χ(3)) is related to the nonlinear refraction (NLR) effect of the material, while Im(χ(3)) (the imaginary part of χ(3)) is related to the nonlinear absorption (NLA) effect of the material. The relationship between Reχ(3), Imχ(3), NLA coefficient β, and NLR index n2 is as follows:237 Im(χ(3)) = n02ε0c2β/ω, and Re(χ(3)) = 2n02ε0cn2. Here, n0 is the linear refraction, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, c is light velocity, and ω is the light frequency.
SA and reverse SA (RSA) are two kinds of NLA response. In the SA effect, the absorption coefficient of the material gradually decreases and tends to saturation when the incident intensity is large. SA is useful for ultrashort pulse laser generation applications.233 For semiconductors, SA generally happens in the resonant region where the photon energy is larger than or equal to the bandgap of the materials through single-photon absorption238 and can be explained using the Pauli blocking principle.239,240 Under the resonant conditions, electrons in the valence band can jump to the conduction band through single-photon absorption. With increasing light intensity, the upper energy states are gradually occupied by the electrons from the valence band. Since it is impossible for two electrons to occupy the same energy state, further light absorption is blocked and SA occurs. However, sometimes SA also occurs in the nonresonant region where the photon energy is lower than the bandgap of the materials.241–245
In the RSA effect, the absorption of the material increases with increase in incident intensity. The absorption becomes larger and the transmission lowers when the incident laser intensity exceeds the threshold. RSA can be used in areas such as optical limiters.246 The RSA properties of nanostructured materials is complicated and mainly due to the two-photon absorption (TPA), excited state absorption (ESA), or free carrier absorption (FCA) mechanism. TPA effect refers to the phenomenon that electrons absorb two photons at the same time and jump from one state (usually the ground state) to a higher energy (usually an excited state). The FCA is an intraband absorption process under single-photon excitation. FCA requires a pre-existing carrier in the excited band (an electron in the conduction band, or a hole in the valence band), where the carrier can move freely. FCA needs the assistance of phonons or impurities to conserve the momentum.247 ESA is a process in which the electron is excited from an excited state to a higher energy excited state. One difference between ESA and TPA is that ESA can occur through single-photon excitation while TPA cannot.
The NLR property is also called the optical Kerr effect. When the incident intensity is low, the refractive index of the material does not change. When the material is excited by a strong light, the refractive index of the material will no longer be a constant. The relationship between the refractive index of the material (n) and the incident light intensity (I) is as follows: n = n0 + n2I. Here, n0 and n2 are linear and nonlinear refraction indices, respectively. Due to the Gaussian distribution of the laser power densities, the light field intensity in the center of the material is different from that at the edge when the laser passes through the material. When the sign of the NLR index n2 is positive, the material will focus the laser beam (self-focusing effect). When the sign of n2 is negative, the material will make the beam diverge (self-defocusing effect). The NLR process is attributed to the electronic Kerr effect, or the thermal lensing, etc.
The NLA effect has been described using different models. In the simplest equation, absorption coefficient (α) of the sample can be described as follows: α(I) = α0 + βI, where α0 and β are the linear absorption and NLA coefficients, respectively. A model describing the SA process can be described as follows:240α(I) = αs/(1 + I/Is) + αns, where Is is the saturation intensity, I is the incident intensity, αs and αns are SA and non-saturable absorption coefficient, respectively. When the incident intensity is low, α is equal to (αs + αns), while α is equal to αns when the intensity is strong. The maximum change of the absorption is equal to αs, which is also known as the modulation depth ΔR. Is, ΔR, and αns can be used to describe the SA performance of materials. With the concurrence of SA and TPA, the above expression can be written as follows:248α(I) = αs/(1 + I/Is) + αns + βI. In this expression, the term (βI) is related to TPA. Moreover, considering both the NLA and NLR processes, a figure of merit (FOM, FOM = n2/βλ)152 can be used to describe the NLO characteristics of the materials.
There are many methods to measure the third-order NLO susceptibility coefficients, such as the optical Z-scan measurement249 and the balanced twin-detector method.250 By using the open- and closed-aperture Z-scan techniques, the values and signs of β and n2 can be achieved simultaneously. Then, Im(χ(3)), Re(χ(3)), χ(3), and FOM values can be calculated using the above mentioned formula. ΔR, Is, and αns can also be obtained. The sample is placed after the lens and can be moved around the focal point of the lens in the Z-direction (Fig. 5(a)242). For the open-aperture Z-scan technique, all the signal transmitted through the sample is collected by a detector. Through the open-aperture curve, the NLA coefficient β can be obtained. For the closed-aperture Z-scan measurement, an aperture is located in the center of the beam before the detector. Only a small portion of the signal from the center of the transmitted beam can be collected by the detector. The signal collected by the detector is thus not only dependent on the transmission of the material but also the beam diameter after the material, which is related to the beam induced refractive index change of the material. After acquiring the measured open- and closed-aperture Z-scan curves, the NLR index n2 of materials can be obtained. When a single laser beam passes through an NLO material, the transverse distribution of the beam causes an additional phase. The measurement of the additional phase using the Z-scan technique is realized by measuring the amplitude change of the incident laser at different positions by diffraction conversion. The Z-scan technique is one of the most commonly used methods to measure the NLO properties of materials. With the balanced twin-detector system (Fig. 5(b)250), the SA characteristics of materials including ΔR and Is can be obtained simultaneously.251 The balanced twin-detector measurement method is easy to operate and is one of the usually applied techniques for measuring the SA characteristics of materials.

4.2 Third-order NLO properties of colloidal semiconductor NCs

Recent studies on the NLO properties of conventional metal chalcogenide NCs have mainly focused on CdSe, PbS, and PbSe QDs. When the intensity of the incident laser (532 nm, ns) increases, the NLO process of the CdSe QDs changes from SA to RSA (Fig. 6(a–d)).3 The SA properties are due to ground state bleaching and the RSA is caused by FCA of CdSe QDs.3 PbS QDs with a small size (3.2 nm) show TPA and NLR properties in the wavelength range of 1.3 to 2.0 μm (Fig. 6(e)).252 This can be explained as follows. The bandgap of PbS QDs with a smaller size of 3.2 nm can be estimated to be around 1.27 eV, according to the approximate formula, which is larger than the incident photon energy.252 Electrons cannot be excited to the higher level through the single-photon process. With the energy of two photons in the wavelength range of 1.3 to 2.0 μm, electrons can jump to the higher energy level through the TPA process. Therefore, TPA process can be observed in this work. PbSe QDs (7.3 nm) exhibit TPA and NLR properties in the wavelength range of 1.6 to 2.0 μm (Fig. 6(e)).252 The bandgap value of PbSe QDs obtained from the luminescence spectra is about 0.75 eV. When the incident wavelength is in the range of 1.7 to 2.0 μm, the incident energy is lower than the bandgap of PbSe QDs, indicating that electrons cannot be excited to the higher energy level through single-photon absorption but TPA process.252 However, no SA effect is observed when the incident wavelength is 1600 nm, which is close to one-photon transition. This is due to band anisotropy, where the breaking of the inversion symmetry of the wave functions has to be included, as theoretically predicted for PbS and PbSe QDs by Nootz and coworkers.254 In some other reports, the PbS QD-based film exhibits SA properties under excitation wavelengths of 1550 nm (Fig. 6(f)),253 1565 nm,255 1566.58 nm,256 and 1568 nm.257 The PbSe QD-based film shows SA properties under excitation of 1064 nm.258 In ref. 255–257, the estimated bandgaps (0.73 eV, 0.72 eV, and 0.72 eV) of PbS QDs (6.8 nm,255 7 nm,256 and 7 nm257) are smaller than the incident energy. So, the SA process can be observed in these three studies. In ref. 258, the incident energy is 1.165 eV, which is larger than the bandgap of PbSe QDs (1.02 eV) as estimated from the approximate formula between the bandgap and the size.252 So, SA occurred in this study.

The NLO properties of colloidal metal chalcogenide NCs have been reported to be affected by factors that are related to the materials such as size, composition (pristine, doped, multicomponent), structure (core/shell, core/shell/shell) and state (dispersion, film). For instance, CdSe QDs with various sizes (2.1, 3.3, 4.7 nm) show similar NLA performance; however, the values of the measured NLA coefficients were different.111 CdSe QDs with a size of 3.3 nm have a larger NLO susceptibility of 1.81 × 10−10 esu because of resonance absorption. In another study, CdSe/ZnS/CdSe core/shell/shell QDs exhibit a larger TPA coefficient and NLR index compared with that of CdSe and CdSe/ZnS QDs under excitation of 532 nm, 30 ps pulse laser.135 The larger NLA coefficient of CdSe/ZnS/CdSe core/shell/shell QDs is due to the quantum confinement effect, as well as the localization of charge carriers and electronic passivation of QD surface in the core/shell structure. Au or Ag nanoparticles exhibit LSPR properties and the enhanced localized electric field is one way to enhance the NLO properties of NCs. For example, the NLR index near the band edge is enhanced more than 35 times by Ag ion doping.152 The enhanced NLR is due to the increase in the excitonic absorption and local electric field in the Ag-doped CdTe NCs.152 The fabrication method,259 dispersant,260 or stabilizing agent261 also has effects on the NLO properties of colloidal metal chalcogenide NCs. For example, PbS QDs prepared using a cation-exchange method show RSA properties and self-focusing properties at 532 nm.259 The RSA properties of the prepared PbS QDs may be due to FCA. The difference in the NLO activity of PbS QDs prepared using different preparation methods is probably due to the difference in the intrinsic crystal nature. The excitation conditions such as wavelength (resonant or nonresonant) and pulse width also exert influence on the NLO properties of the colloidal metal chalcogenide NCs.
Recent third-order NLO studies on plasmonic semiconductor NCs have mainly focused on Cu2−xS, Cu2−xSe, Cu3−xP, and Cu12Sb4S13 NCs. Due to their unique LSPR properties in the IR region (Fig. 7(a)164), the NLO properties are usually studied in the IR region. For instance, CuS NCs prepared using the photochemical method exhibit SA properties with a large modulation depth and a high damage threshold at 1030 nm.22βeff is around −1.015 ± 0.007 cm GW−1, which is higher than those of graphene, MoS2, and BP.22,262–265 Cu2−xS NCs exhibit SA properties at 800, 1200, 1400, and 1550 nm.59 The fast decay time of Cu2−xS NCs is about 315 fs. Recently, it has been shown that Cu1.8Se NCs show SA properties at 800 nm, 1060 nm, and 1550 nm (Fig. 7).164 In addition, the Cu1.8Se NC-based films show SA properties at 1960.3 nm and 2864.6 nm (Fig. 7).164 Cu1.8Se NCs show an ultrafast response of about 360–520 fs. The ultrafast response and large NLO coefficient are caused by plasmon ground-state bleaching in Cu1.8Se NCs. Results indicate that the plasmonic semiconductor NCs show strong SA properties in the wide-IR wavelength region, indicating their promising applications as an ultrafast and broadband saturable absorber for the generation of pulse lasers.

Metal halide perovskite NCs also exhibit attractive NLO properties. Most of the NLO studies on metal halide perovskite NCs focus on CsPbBr3 NCs due to their structural stability. The NLO properties of CsPbBr3 NCs were first reported by Sun et al. in 2015.266 CsPbBr3 NCs show TPA properties with a TPA coefficient of about 0.097 cm GW−1 and a large TPA cross-section of 1.2 × 105 GM at 800 nm (Fig. 8(a)),266 suggesting that CsPbBr3 NCs are promising candidates as nonlinear absorbers for photonic applications. CsPbBr3 NCs exhibit different NLA properties due to their different material parameters and measurement conditions. For example, CsPbBr3 NCs exhibit TPA properties at 787 nm267 and 800 nm.266,268–270 However, in other studies, CsPbBr3 NCs show SA properties at 515 nm (Fig. 8(b))271 and 800 nm.242,272 In addition, the CsPbBr3 NC-based film shows SA properties at 1060 nm,245 1563 nm,273 and 2010 nm.274 In ref. 266–270, the incident energies (1.58 eV267 and 1.55 eV266,268–270) are lower than the bandgap of CsPbBr3 NCs as the absorption peak of CsPbBr3 NCs is located in the visible wavelength region. Electrons can jump to a higher energy level through the TPA process. However, in ref. 271, the incident energy (2.407 eV) was a little higher than the bandgap of CsPbBr3 NCs (2.403 eV); so, in this work, CsPbBr3 NCs exhibited the SA process. In ref. 242, CsPbBr3 NCs show the SA process at 800 nm with the incident light intensity at the focal point smaller than 1.5 GW cm−2 (Fig. 8(c)).242 Compared with ref. 266, where colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs exhibited the TPA effect when the incident intensity at the focal point is 20 GW cm−2, the authors deduced that there is an incident intensity threshold of TPA in CsPbBr3 NCs. When the light intensity at the focal point is 0.1 GW cm−2, the signal is mainly noise. When the light intensity at the focus point increases to 1 GW cm−2, hot carriers can be excited to a higher energy level, while the intensity is still lower than the threshold of TPA. In addition, the MAPbBr3 QDs exhibit TPA activities (Fig. 8(d))242 under the same excitation conditions; so, the SA properties of the CsPbBr3 NCs in this report may be also due to the structural difference between Cs+ and MA+. In this report, MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3 QDs also exhibited a self-defocusing effect (Fig. 8(e)).242 In ref. 245, 273 and 274, the incident wavelengths were 1060 nm,245 1563 nm,273 and 2010 nm (Fig. 8(f)),274 respectively. In these three references, the CsPbBr3 NC-based film was prepared using the solution treatment method and there was a broadband absorption from 0.8 to over 2.2 μm, which may have been caused by edge states and crystallographic defects of the film. So in these three refs, SA processes were observed and the SA mechanism may be due to the absorption saturation by the edge states and crystallographic defects.

The structural differences have influences on their correlated optical properties. For instance, the NLO properties of CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 QDs were compared at 800 nm (130 fs).242 MAPbBr3 QDs exhibit TPA activities while CsPbBr3 QDs show SA properties. In addition, MAPbBr3 QDs show enhanced NLA coefficients compared with that of CsPbBr3 QDs, which is mainly due to the photoinduced orientation effects that correlate with the structural difference between MA+ and Cs+. In another study, the NLO properties of CsPbCl3 and CsPb(Cl0.53Br0.47)3 NCs were studied.20 The TPA coefficients of CsPb(Cl0.53Br0.47)3 NCs are stronger than those of CsPbCl3 NCs because the structure of CsPb(Cl0.53Br0.47)3 NCs is less stable than that of CsPbCl3 NCs and the delocalized electrons in CsPb(Cl0.53Br0.47)3 NCs are more easily redistributed than those of CsPbCl3 NCs. The two Stegeman's figures of merit (W, T) of CsPb(Cl0.53Br0.47)3 NCs satisfy the demand of W > 1 and T < 1 at most of the excitation wavelengths, indicating that the NCs can be applied in all-optical signal processing devices. In the following study, the NLO properties of the pristine and Ni-doped CsPbBr3 NCs were studied.270 Ni-Doped CsPbBr3 NCs exhibit larger χ(3) than that of pristine CsPbBr3 NCs, which is attributed to the localized surface plasmon-induced charge transfer (at the metal–semiconductor interface). Recently, it has been shown that the colloidal Au–CsPbBr3 NCs exhibit enhanced SA properties compared to that of the colloidal pure CsPbBr3NCs at 800 nm.272 These results show the structure–property correlations in the metal halide perovskite NCs.
Most of the reports on the NLO properties of 2D-QDs mainly concentrate on BPQDs. In 2016, Xu and coworkers reported the third-order NLO properties of BPQDs under fs excitation at 800 nm (Fig. 9(a)).264 The BPQDs (2.1 ± 0.9 nm) show SA properties with ΔR of about 36% and Is of about 3.3 GW cm−2. When compared with the BP nanosheets, the BPQDs demonstrate a higher ΔR and lower Is, which are mainly due to the quantum confinement effect of the ultrasmall BPQDs. In the following study, it was found that BPQDs also exhibit SA properties under the excitation wavelengths of 370 nm (Fig. 9(b)),275 532 nm,200 1050 nm,243 1064 nm,200 1350 nm,243 and 1550 nm (Fig. 9(c)).243 In addition, the BP QD-based film also exhibited SA properties at 400 nm, 800 nm, 1560 nm, and 1930 nm.276 The results indicate that BPQDs or BP QD-based film exhibit excellent broadband SA properties from the UV to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength region and may serve as a novel broadband saturable absorber material for ultrafast photonics applications. For the same BPQD sample, when excited at different wavelengths, the BPQDs exhibit different NLA performances. For instance, the SA behavior of BPQDs (5.7 ± 0.8 nm) was measured at 800 nm, while the TPA process was observed at excitation wavelengths of 1160 nm, 1300 nm, 1550 nm, and 2000 nm.277 In this ref, the bandgap of BPQDs is estimated to be around 1.4 eV according to the absorption spectrum and the approximate formula between the absorption gap and the size of BPQDs. The incident energy is lower than the bandgap of BPQDs. Electrons cannot be excited to a higher level at excitation wavelengths of 1160–2000 nm through the single-photon process. Also, the BPQDs show different excitation intensity- and wavelength-dependent NLA properties from BP nanosheets with similar thicknesses due to quantum confinement effects. In another report, BPQDs with an average lateral size of about 2–3 nm exhibited a broad absorption band spanning from the UV to the near infrared (NIR) region as well as a broad absorption band from 1250 to 1630 nm with two obvious peaks at 1438 and 1550 nm.243 The absorption at the UV-visible range is similar to that of the 2D BP and the NIR absorption peaks may be attributed to the defect states of the ultrasmall QDs. BPQDs exhibit broadband optical limiting effects at 500, 700, and 900 nm.243 The optical limiting effects of the BPQDs are attributed to TPA through fs pump–probe measurements. When excited at 500–900 nm (1.38–2.48 eV), electrons cannot be excited through the single-photon process. With the energy (2.76–4.96 eV) of two photons at 500–900 nm, electrons can jump to a higher energy level through the TPA process. In contrast, SA activity due to ground-state bleaching was observed under fs excitation at 1050 nm, 1350 nm, and 1550 nm. The ground-state bleaching may be due to the strong absorption in the NIR wavelength region caused by the defect states of the ultrasmall BPQDs. The results indicate that BPQDs can be used as an optical limiter in the visible wavelength region or as a saturable absorber in the NIR wavelength region for ultrafast photonics.

Besides BPQDs, the NLA properties of other 2D-QDs under different excitation conditions were also investigated. GQDs with an average lateral size of 3–5 nm and a few layers exhibit RSA properties at 532 nm (8 ns), while showing SA activity at 532 nm (21 ps).278 In this report, when the incident pulse changes from ns to ps, the change from RSA to SA occurs because the lifetime of the excited state is much longer than ps. Under ps excitation, the ground state carriers would deplete, while the excited state was almost occupied, resulting in the SA process. Later, the NLO properties of the GQDs were studied at 355 nm, 532 nm and 1064 nm in the ps regime.279 Under UV excitation (close to the linear absorption peak of GQDs), both SA and optical Kerr effects were observed simultaneously, while at 532 nm and 1064 nm, only an optical Kerr effect was observed. MoS2 QDs show RSA activity due to the TPA process at 532 nm.280 Recently, it was found that the BiQD film exhibited SA properties under 1.34 μm281 and 2 μm excitations.282 The orthorhombic phase of yellow β-PbO QD/PS film shows SA properties with excitation wavelength from 540 nm to 1064 nm.283 Very recently, it has been known that the Ti3C2Tx MQDs exhibit SA properties from 800 nm to 1550 nm.24
Besides NLA properties, the optical Kerr effect was reported by using the Z-scan or spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) technique. BPQDs with an average size of about 3 nm exhibited optical Kerr properties at 1500 nm through the close-aperture Z-scan technique.235 By using the SSPM technique at visible wavelengths of 532 and 633 nm, AQDs showed an optical Kerr effect with the NLR index n2 as high as 10−5 cm2 W−1.284 The results suggest that BPQDs and AQDs can be applied in nonlinear photonics devices such as optical switches, Kerr shutters, and beam shapers.
5. NLO devices based on colloidal semiconductor NCs
NLO devices fabricated based on the optical nonlinearities of materials have promising applications in many fields. For instance, materials with SA properties could be used as saturable absorbers (a type of material with SA properties) to obtain ultrashort pulsed lasers.233 The ultrashort pulsed laser plays important roles in medicine,9 and industrial materials processing10 benefiting from its narrow pulse width, large peak power and pulse energy. Many colloidal semiconductor NCs exhibit excellent SA properties, indicating that they are promising candidates as saturable absorbers for the generation of pulsed laser. Since 2016, ultrashort pulsed lasers generated by using the colloidal semiconductor NCs as the saturable absorbers have been developed rapidly.58,59,245,255,264,285,286 In this section, we mainly introduce the pulsed lasers (fiber and solid-state) achieved based on the colloidal semiconductor NCs as saturable absorbers. In addition, other NLO devices including the lasing devices, as well as Kerr switches and wavelength converters based on the colloidal semiconductor NCs are also mentioned.
5.1 Saturable absorbers and pulse laser technologies
The fiber and solid-state lasers are two main methods to obtain pulse lasers. The fiber laser uses fibers as the gain media while crystals, glasses, or ceramic materials are usually employed as the gain media in the solid-state laser. In both lasers, there are two main modulation technologies (active and passive) to turn the continuous-wave (CW) output into a train of optical pulses.1,287 In the active modulation technology, electronic devices controlled by an external driving power source are used. In contrast, in the passive modulation technology, a saturable absorber is inserted into the laser cavity to transform CW into a pulsed laser output by either Q-switching or mode-locking. The passive modulation technology has the advantages of being simple, compact, and inexpensive. Therefore, passive Q-switching and mode-locking are currently two of the main technologies to obtain ultrashort pulsed lasers.
The passive Q-switching technology can be used to obtain high energy pulses (usually μJ to mJ). In the passive Q-switching technique, the cavity loss and the Q-factor are periodically adjusted so as to obtain high energy pulses. In the early stage, the Q-factor is low when the SA performance of the saturable absorber material does not occur; energy can only exist in the form of particle number inversion and continuously accumulates. This would lead to the SA performance of the saturable absorber and a sudden increase of the Q-factor. The gain of the laser will greatly exceed the loss, and the accumulated energy will be released to produce a high energy pulse. There is a formula for the criterion of a passive Q-switching laser.324,325 From this criterion, it can be seen that the properties of the laser crystal (long upper-level lifetimes), saturable absorber (relatively long recovery times and large modulation depths), and short linear cavity are required to be considered. However, blindly increasing the modulation depth of the saturable absorbers would increase the cavity loss; so, it is necessary to keep a balance between cavity gain and loss.
The mode-locking technique is usually used to obtain an ultrashort laser pulse (usually ps to fs). When a saturable absorber is put in the cavity, only the “spike” components of the spontaneous emission noise from the gain medium survive. These components are then amplified by the gain medium and reshaped by the saturable absorber. After iteration of this process, a pulse train is produced.1 In the frequency domain, when the optical phase of each longitudinal cavity resonance mode keeps constant or locked to each other, an ultrashort laser pulse is obtained. There is also a theoretical formula for the criterion of a passive mode-locking laser.324,325 According to this criterion, suitable parameters of the saturable absorber (modulation depth, saturation intensity/energy/fluence), gain medium, and the laser cavity are important for mode-locking lasers. The product of modulation depth and saturable fluence should satisfy the criterion. In addition, two other conditions also need to be satisfied, i.e., the bandgap of the saturable absorber should be smaller than that of the operating laser and the carrier relaxation time should be shorter than the cavity round-trip time.
The advantages of colloidal semiconductor NCs as saturable absorbers for the generation of pulsed lasers mainly include the tunable and broadband bandgap, good SA performance, ultrafast relaxation, and ease of synthesis and integration. First, the bandgap of colloidal semiconductor NCs can be tuned in a broad range from the UV to the MIR spectral region by simply changing their size or composition. Second, lots of colloidal semiconductor NCs show good SA performance. In addition, compared with their quantum-well counterparts, colloidal semiconductor NCs could, in principle, exhibit lower saturation fluence.292 For instance, the saturation intensity of the CdTe/CdS core/shell QDs (3.0 nm) is smaller than that of graphene and MoS2 dispersions.293 Third, some colloidal semiconductor NCs exhibit an ultrafast relaxation time. Many colloidal semiconductor NCs are direct bandgap materials and their corresponding carrier lifetimes are relatively short, suggesting that the direct bandgap materials have superiority in realizing ultrashort pulses. For example, Cu2−xS NCs show an ultrafast response (∼315 fs at 1.3 μm),59 which offers a great advantage for the modulation of ultrashort optical signals. Finally, the preparation and integration methods of colloidal semiconductor NCs are facile.
Once the colloidal semiconductor NCs are prepared, their integration into fiber or solid-state laser cavities to form saturable absorbers is a key issue that affects their subsequent pulsed laser generation applications. The easiest method to construct a saturable absorber is to deposit the colloidal NCs onto the mirrors directly. Saturable absorbers fabricated by this approach are often used for solid-state lasers. For fiber lasers, different techniques have been employed to incorporate the NC-based saturable absorbers into the fiber laser system. Here, three common techniques are introduced. One simple method is directly depositing the NCs onto the fiber end facet or onto a tapered fiber. There are two ways for the direct deposition method. One way is that the NC solution is drop cast on the fiber connector end using a syringe, followed by evaporation. The other way is that the fiber ferrule connector end is flooded into NC suspension, followed by keeping the connector vertical during drying. The direct deposition procedure is simple for integration of colloidal semiconductor NCs into fiber. However, the NC film is not uniform and the thickness of the NC film cannot be controlled. Polymers are often introduced to help fabricate a uniform NC film. The second method is that the NCs are mixed with polymer to construct a uniform NC film. This type of saturable absorber has a simple structure; however, it suffers from a low thermal damage threshold due to the polymer host. To enhance the thermal damage threshold, the third method is based on microfiber. The NCs are coated onto the cross section of the polished microfiber based on the evanescent field interaction. When using this method, the linear transmission spectra and balanced twin-detector measurement technique are usually used to further characterize the integrated microfiber based saturable absorber to evaluate whether the integration process was successful or not.
5.2 Colloidal semiconductor NCs as saturable absorbers for passively mode-locked fiber lasers
The passive mode-locking fiber laser could be used to generate an ultrashort pulsed laser output, which has applications in communication and medicine. Since 2016, there have been lots of relevant studies on passive mode-locking fiber laser with the colloidal semiconductor NC-based saturable absorbers.59,245,264,285Table 2 summarizes the main parameters of the generated passively mode-locked fiber lasers based on the colloidal semiconductor NCs as the saturable absorbers.

Passive mode-locking fiber lasers at around 1 μm and 1.55 μm were achieved by using the conventional metal chalcogenide NCs as the saturable absorbers. In 2017, CdSe QDs296 and PbSe QDs258 were used as the saturable absorbers in mode-locked Yb-doped fiber (YDF) to generate pulse lasers centered at around 1 μm. In the following report, PbS QDs were used as the saturable absorbers in Er-doped fiber (EDF).253 In previous work, the long-time operation of laser pulse based on the QDs has seldom been reported. The reason may be that QDs are unstable due to the trap states on their surface. Constructing a core/shell structure is an effective way to passivate the trap state and improve the photostability of QDs. Core/shell structures such as PbS/CdS QDs were prepared and used as saturable absorbers for the generation of fiber lasers.297 The laser pulse spectra were measured over 10 h and a long-time stable mode-locked operation was obtained. PbS/CdS core/shell QDs have a type-I structure, in which the bandgap of PbS core is confined by the CdS shell. The electron and hole states are confined in the PbS core and the trap states at the PbS surface are passivated, improving the optical stability. Up to now, the shortest pulse duration of the generated mode-locked fiber laser based on the conventional metal chalcogenide NCs was 559 fs with PbS QDs as the saturable absorber in the EDFL.253 The maximum repetition rate of the generated mode-locked fiber laser by using the conventional metal chalcogenide NCs was 14.5 MHz with CdSe QDs as the saturable absorber in the EDFL.296 These results show that the conventional metal chalcogenide NCs could be used as the saturable absorbers for the generation of passively mode-locked fiber lasers in the NIR spectral region.
Plasmonic semiconductor NCs were used as saturable absorbers for the generation of passive mode-locking fiber lasers at around 1.55 μm. In 2016, Guo and coworkers prepared Cu2−xS NCs with an LSPR peak centered at around 1300 nm.59 The plasmonic semiconductor NCs show ultrafast NLO response and large modulation depth as large as 63.3%. Mode-locking fiber laser at 1562.6 nm was first achieved.59 In addition, the generated laser pulses remained stable over 2 h. In the following report, Cu3–xP NCs were used as a saturable absorber to generate mode-locked fiber lasers at 1570 nm with a repetition rate as large as 31 MHz.61 The preparation of Cu3–xP and Cu2−xS NCs often requires a high temperature and an air-free environment. Recently, it has been shown that CuS NCs prepared using a photochemical method show good stability and broad absorption in the visible to NIR region.22 A mode-locking fiber laser at 1.55 μm was obtained based on CuS NCs. So far, the shortest pulse width and the maximum repetition rate of the mode-locking fiber laser with the plasmonic semiconductor NCs were 295 fs (with Cu2−xS NCs based saturable absorber59) and 31 MHz (with Cu3–xP NC based saturable absorber61). These results indicate that the plasmonic semiconductor NCs also have promising applications in the generation of passive mode-locking fiber lasers in the NIR region.
When using metal halide perovskite NCs as the saturable absorber, mode-locked fiber lasers centered at the NIR and MIR spectral region (around 1 μm, 1.6 μm, and 2 μm) were achieved. All the studies based on the metal halide perovskite NCs as the saturable absorbers employ CsPbBr3 NCs because of their structural stability. Specifically, In 2016, CsPbBr3 NCs were prepared and used as a saturable absorber for mode-locked Yb-doped fiber laser (YDFL) for the first time by Zhou and coworkers.245 Mode-locking single pulses centered at 1076 nm with a duration of 216 ps are obtained in a polarization-maintained YDFL. In the following report, a dissipative soliton with a pulse duration of 14.4 ps at 1600 nm was achieved in the mode-locked EDFL based on CsPbBr3 QDs.273 With a 25 m single-mode fiber, the pulse width can be compressed to 1.046 ps. Recently, CsPbBr3 NCs have been used as a saturable absorber for mode-locking fiber laser at 1992.9 nm (Fig. 10).274 Until now, the shortest pulse duration of the generated mode-locked fiber lasers based on CsPbBr3 NCs as the saturable absorbers is 1.046 ps at 1600 nm.273 The maximum repetition rate of the obtained mode-locked fiber lasers with CsPbBr3 NC based saturable absorber was 16.6 MHz in the Tm-doped fiber laser (TDFL) at 1992.9 nm.274 These studies suggest that the metal halide perovskite NCs are other potential candidates to achieve a passively mode-locked fiber laser output in the NIR and MIR wavelengths.

By employing the 2D-QDs as the saturable absorbers, mode-locked fiber lasers were realized at around 1 μm and 1.55 μm. The usage of 2D-QDs as the saturable absorber for pulsed laser generation was first reported in 2016 by Xu and coworkers.264 In their report, ultrasmall BPQDs were employed as saturable absorbers for pulsed laser generation at the telecommunication band in a passive mode-locking EDFL. The results confirm the creation of an ultrashort laser pulse with a width of about 1.08 ps at 1567.5 nm. Since the first report, various 2D-QDs have been applied as the saturable absorbers for pulsed laser generation applications. In the following study, BPQDs were used as an efficient saturable absorber for delivering bound soliton at the telecommunication band in passively mode-locked EDFL.285 In another report, with microfiber-based phosphorene QDs as the saturable absorber, self-starting laser pulses were generated at 1561.7 nm.250 In addition, polarization locked vector solitons were also observed. Later, with microfiber-based BPQDs, a mode-locked fiber laser with a duration time as short as 291 fs was achieved.313 Besides BPQDs, other 2D-QDs including NbSe2,322 GaTe (Fig. 11),323 and orthorhombic phase of yellow β-PbO QDs283 were also used as the saturable absorbers for the generation of mode-locked fiber lasers. For instance, stable ultrashort mode-locked laser pulse trains with a duration of 765 fs or 380 ps were generated from EDFL or YDFL with NbSe2 QDs as the saturable absorber.322 Recently, by using WS2 QDs as a saturable absorber, polarization domain wall solitons have been produced for the first time in a passively mode-locked EDFL.319 There are two separate orthogonally polarized spectra in the spectrum of the polarization domain wall, one at 1561.1 nm with horizontal polarization and the other one at 1561.5 nm with vertical polarization. Very recently, it has been shown that MXene Ti3C2Tx QDs show wideband SA properties from 800 to 1550 nm.24 MXene Ti3C2Tx QDs were used for the generation of ultrashort pulses in mode-locking EDFL or YDFL with a pulse duration as short as 170 fs. Additionally, an ultranarrow fiber laser with a full width at half maximum of 5 kHz is obtained. Until now, the shortest pulse duration and the maximum repetition rate of the obtained mode-locked fiber laser based on 2D-QDs as the saturable absorbers were 115 fs (from GaTe QDs) at 1530.9 nm323 and 19.347 MHz (from WS2 QDs) at 1561.1 nm,319 respectively. These results show that 2D-QDs are promising saturable absorbers for nonlinear photonic applications in mode-locked fiber lasers in the NIR spectral window.

It is noted that by employing colloidal semiconductor NCs as the saturable absorbers, the generated passive mode-locking fiber laser is mainly centered at around 1 μm, 1.55 μm, and 2 μm. The gain medium contains YDF, EDF, and TDF. The shortest pulse duration time was 115 fs when using GaTe QDs as the saturable absorber in the mode-locked EDFL at 1530.9 nm.323 The maximum repetition rate was 31 MHz with a pulse duration of 423 fs when using Cu3–xP NCs as the saturable absorber in the mode-locked YDFL at 1570 nm.61 The current research mainly focuses on wavelength from 1 to 2 μm. However, there is no report on passive mode-locking fiber laser at visible wavelength or longer wavelength especially at 3 μm. It is reported that the bandgap of PbE (E = S, Se, Te) NCs can be tuned to the IR region, while plasmonic semiconductor NCs have absorption peaks in the IR region due to their LSPR properties, suggesting that these materials can be used in the MIR region. Therefore, the reason why there is no report on passive mode-locking fiber laser based on colloidal semiconductor NCs at longer wavelengths may be due to the limitation of the experimental conditions (e.g. synthesis of high quality NCs and choosing suitable gain medium). Despite the limitations, it is found that colloidal semiconductor NCs can serve as saturable absorbers for the generation of ultrashort passive mode-locking fiber lasers.
5.3 Colloidal semiconductor NCs as saturable absorbers for passively Q-switched fiber lasers
The passive Q-switching fiber laser could be employed for the generation of high-energy laser pulse, which is helpful for industrial processing. Since 2016, colloidal semiconductor NCs including the conventional metal chalcogenide and plasmonic semiconductor NCs have been used for the generation of passive Q-switching fiber laser pulses.255,286Table 3 summarizes the parameters of the generated passively mode-locked fiber lasers based on the colloidal semiconductor NCs as the saturable absorbers.

When using conventional metal chalcogenide NCs as the saturable absorber, Q-switching fiber lasers could be achieved in the NIR range (around 1 μm and 1.5 μm). In 2016, PbS QDs255 and CdSe QDs286 were used as the saturable absorbers for the generation of passively Q-switched fiber lasers. The colloidal PbS QDs were prepared first. Then, the PbS QD–polymer composite thin film was directly sandwiched between two fiber ferrule connectors. The pulse in the passive Q-switching EDFL based on PbS QDs as the saturable absorber is at around 1.55 μm with a pulse duration of 3.3 μs.255 With CdSe QDs as the saturable absorber, the pulse width of the generated Q-switched laser from a YDFL at 1081 nm is 3.65 μs.286 These two reports lay a foundation for further applications of the conventional metal chalcogenide QDs as saturable absorbers in passively Q-switched fiber laser generation. CdSe QDs,326 PbS QDs,255–257 and CdS QDs (Fig. 12)300 were used as the saturable absorbers to generate Q-switching fiber laser at around 1.55 μm. So far, in the passive Q-switching fiber laser with conventional semiconductor NCs as the saturable absorbers, the maximum pulse energy was 1.1 μJ based on the CdSe QDs at 1081.5 nm,296 the maximum average output power was 40.19 mW based on the PbS NCs at 1567.8 nm,257 and the shortest pulse width was 235.7 ns based on PbS/CdS core/shell QDs.299

The plasmonic semiconductor NCs have been used for the generation of Q-switched fiber laser from the NIR to MIR wavelength region (around 1.55 μm, 2 μm, and 2.8 μm). In 2016, Liu and coworkers prepared Cu3–xP NCs with LSPR absorption tunable from 1390 to 1710 nm.58 Cu3–xP NCs were used as saturable absorbers to generate stable and high-energy Q-switching pulses at 1567.14 nm. The SNR of Cu3−xP-based fiber laser is larger than 48.5 dB. In addition, broadband Q-switching was produced, suggesting that Cu3–xP NCs could work as NLO media in a broadband range. The shortest pulse width was 6.092 μs. Moreover, the laser pulses show good stability and repeatability. In the same year, Guo and coworkers used Cu2−xS NCs as the saturable absorber to generate Q-switching pulse laser near 2.8 μm.59 These early studies show that the plasmonic semiconductor NCs are excellent saturable absorbers for Q-switched fiber laser applications in the IR spectral region. Later, Cu3−xP NCs were employed as the saturable absorbers for Q-switching fiber lasers at around 1.5 μm.61 Cu1.8S NCs can be used as the saturable absorbers for Q-switching fiber lasers at around 1.5 μm302 and 2 μm.304 Recently, it has been known that Cu1.8Se NCs demonstrate an ultrafast response (∼360–520 fs), strong SA (−1.4 × 103 cm GW−1), and broadband (from 800 to 3000 nm) SA in the IR spectral region.164 Q-switched lasers in EDFL (at 1533.8 nm), TDFL (at 1960.3 nm), and Ho/Pr-codoped ZBLAN fiber laser (at 2864.6 nm) were obtained, respectively (Fig. 13).164 Up to now, the shortest pulse width (∼0.75 μs) and maximum output power (214 mW) were from the Cu2−xS NC-based saturable absorber in the Q-switched Er-ZBLAN fiber laser at 2769 nm.59

It is noted that by employing the colloidal semiconductor NCs as the saturable absorbers, passively Q-switched fiber lasers can also be generated in a broad spectral region (around 1 μm, 1.55 μm, 2 μm, and 2.8 μm). The gain medium includes YDF, EDF, TDF, Yb/Er-codoped fiber, Nd-doped fiber, Ho/Pr-codoped ZBLAN, and Er-doped ZBLAN. The maximum average output power was 214 mW when using Cu2−xS NCs as the saturable absorber in the Q-switched fiber laser at 2769 nm.59 The maximum pulse energy was 120 μJ based on the Cu3–xP NC saturable absorber in the Q-switched fiber laser at 1560.9 nm.61 The shortest pulse width was 235.7 ns based on PbS/CdS core/shell QDs in Nd-doped fiber laser at around 1 μm.299 It should be noted that the saturable absorbers contain the conventional metal chalcogenide NCs and plasmonic semiconductor NCs. However, until now, there is no report on the passively Q-switched fiber laser with perovskite NCs and 2D-QDs as the saturable absorbers. This may be due to the limitations of the experimental conditions, such as the difficulty in designing the suitable parameters of the cavity to meet the design criterion.
5.4 Colloidal semiconductor NCs as saturable absorbers for solid-state lasers
The solid-state laser typically consists of a free-space cavity with a solid-state gain medium, which is suitable for achieving high-energy and high-peak-power laser pulses, and has promising applications in industry, research, and military areas. In 2016, Cu2−xS NCs as the saturable absorber were first introduced in a solid-state laser application.59 Since then, lots of colloidal semiconductor NCs have been explored for solid-state laser applications. Colloidal semiconductor NCs have a broad bandgap (from the UV to MIR region), large modulation depth (as large as 63%59), and low saturation intensity (as low as 157 kW cm−2300), making a class of saturable absorber materials for solid-state laser applications. Table 4 summarizes the parameters of the generated passively Q-switched and mode-locked solid-state lasers based on the colloidal semiconductor NCs as the saturable absorbers.

For conventional metal chalcogenide NCs, passive Q-switching bulk lasers at 721 nm, 640 nm, 607 nm, and 522 nm were obtained by using CdTe/CdS core/shell QDs (a quasi-type-II structure) as the saturable absorber.183,292,293 Results show that CdTe/CdS QDs could be promising in generating ultrashort pulse visible lasers. Later, passive Q-switching solid-state laser at 1.064 μm was obtained by using the CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD based saturable absorber.298 By using the plasmonic semiconductor NCs, solid-state lasers at around 1 μm and 2 μm were obtained. For instance, a continuous-wave mode-locked solid-state laser pulse at 1030 nm with a duration of 7.8 ps was achieved by using Cu2−xS NCs as the saturable absorber.59 A passively Q-switched Yb:YAG solid-state laser at 1025 nm was achieved with Cu2−xSe QDs as the saturable absorbers.303 Recently, a passive Q-switching bulk laser at 2 μm has been obtained based on Cu12Sb4S13 NCs.305 For metal halide perovskite NCs, CsPbBr3 QDs exhibited a strong SA response at 515 nm and were used as the saturable absorber in a passively Q-switched visible solid-state laser centered at 522 nm.271 As for 2D-QDs, by using BiQDs as the saturable absorbers, a passive Q-switching bulk laser at 1 μm,318 1.3 μm,281,318 and 2 μm (Fig. 14)282 was achieved.

It is noted that the generated solid-state laser pulse is centered at the visible, NIR, and MIR spectral regions (522 nm, 607 nm, 640 nm, 721 nm, ∼1 μm, ∼1.3 μm, and 2 μm). The gain medium contains Pr:YLF, Nd:GdVO4, Yb:LuYAG, Yb:YAG, (Tm,La):CaF2, and Tm:YLF. The shortest pulse duration time was 150 ns when using BiQDs as the saturable absorber in the Q-switched solid-state laser at 1.06 μm.318 The maximum repetition rate was 84.17 MHz with a pulse duration of 7.8 ps when using Cu2−xS NCs as the saturable absorber in the mode-locked solid-state laser at 1030 nm with Yb:LuYAG as the gain medium.59 Until now, most of the reports on the solid-state lasers that use colloidal semiconductor NCs as the saturable absorbers focus on the passive Q-switching solid-state lasers. There is only one report on passive mode-locking solid-state laser (7.8 ps) by using Cu2−xS NCs as the saturable absorber at 1030 nm.59 The reason may be that designing a mode-locked solid-state laser is more difficult than designing a Q-switched laser because, besides the performance of the laser crystal and the saturable absorber, other factors such as the thermally stable area, the dispersion of the resonant elements, and mode matching of the pump and oscillating beams are all required to be taken into account.325 Further exploration on passive mode-locking and Q-switching solid-state lasers based on colloidal semiconductor NCs as the saturable absorber materials is still on the way.
5.5 Other NLO devices based on colloidal semiconductor NCs
In addition to being a saturable absorber to achieve ultrashort pulsed lasers, the metal halide perovskite NCs can also be used as an optical gain material in frequency upconverted stimulated emission (lasing) due to their two-photon and multi-photon absorption and luminescence properties.266,327–330 For instance, the intensity dependent frequency-upconversion luminescence spectra from the CsPbBr3 NC-based film excited at 800 nm are shown in Fig. 15.266 The detailed research on lasing devices based on colloidal semiconductor nanostructures is introduced in a recent review article.27 The results suggest that the emerging metal-halide perovskite NCs are effective frequency-upconverted optical gain media.

BPQDs can also be used for all-optical signal processing applications. The nonlinear optical Kerr effect and the corresponding optical signal processing application based on BPQDs were reported in 2019.235 By using the BPQD-decorated microfiber, an all-optical Kerr switch with an extinction ratio of ∼20 dB and an FWM-based wavelength converter with a −40 dB conversion efficiency were demonstrated. The results suggest that BPQDs are useful for nonlinear photonics devices such as Kerr switches and wavelength converters. These results have opened a new door for 2D material-based photonic applications in all-optical communication. It should be pointed out that the development of these all-optical devices has just started, and much work needs to be further studied.
6. Conclusion and outlook
The research and application of colloidal semiconductor NCs have attracted increasing interest in recent years. This review summarizes the recent advances of colloidal semiconductor NCs, including the liquid-phase preparation methods, third-order NLO properties and corresponding NLO device applications. The study focuses on four classes of colloidal semiconductor NCs including conventional metal chalcogenide semiconductor NCs, plasmonic semiconductor NCs, metal halide perovskite NCs, and 2D-QDs. The basic properties (structure and bandgap energy) of these colloidal semiconductor NCs are provided. The liquid-phase synthesis methods for preparing colloidal semiconductor NCs are introduced, including the HI, aqueous synthesis, LARP, and the top-down liquid-phase exfoliation methods. Then the recent advances of the third-order NLO properties (mainly SA, RSA, and optical Kerr effect) of colloidal semiconductor NCs are summarized. Based on these NLO properties, many NLO device applications are demonstrated. We mainly focus on the ultrashort pulsed laser generation applications that benefited from the excellent SA properties of the colloidal semiconductor NCs. In addition, other NLO devices such as the optical gain medium in frequency upconverted stimulated emission (lasing) and all-optical signal processing devices are also mentioned.
The extensive NLO device applications of colloidal semiconductor NCs have experienced rapid development and a series of important results have been achieved. However, some challenges remain to be addressed. First, how to precisely control the parameters of the materials (e.g. size, composition, structure, and dispersants) by changing their preparation conditions (e.g., the synthesis method, reaction temperature, reagent types and concentration, the pH value of the solution, and reaction time) to achieve the required NLO properties, so as to meet the application requirements of specific NLO devices. On one hand, for special NLO device applications, some important NLO parameters of colloidal semiconductor NCs should be considered. With the design criterion of passive Q-switching and mode-locking lasers, suitable SA parameters should be explored for passively Q-switched (large modulation depth and long carrier relaxation) or mode-locked lasers (suitable modulation depth, saturable intensity, and recovery time). For all-optical switches, materials with a large NLR index (n2) and a small NLA coefficient (β) are usually needed to satisfy the requirement of good nonlinear FOMs. On the other hand, the material parameters that influence the NLO performance of colloidal semiconductor NCs mainly include their size, composition, structure, and dispersant. Therefore, the design and preparation of colloidal semiconductor NCs with precise material parameters are beneficial to obtain colloidal semiconductor NCs with controllable NLO performance. In addition, it is significant to study the nonlinear optics theory of colloidal semiconductor NCs in depth for improvement of their NLO properties and development of NLO device applications. Second, how to prepare colloidal semiconductor NC-based NLO devices with high quality. For practical device applications, semiconductor NC dispersions cannot be used directly and the preparation of NC-based films is usually required. The thickness, uniformity, and high damage threshold of the NC-based film need to be considered. Third, how to extend the application scope of colloidal semiconductor NCs. Some colloidal semiconductor NCs show excellent SA characteristics and can be used as saturable absorbers for the generation of ultrashort pulse laser. However, the current research is mainly in the NIR wavelength region. The research in other wavelength regions, especially the MIR region, is still not enough. Developing more colloidal semiconductor NCs with a suitable bandgap or strong absorption in the MIR region is needed. Fourth, the commercialization of NLO devices based on colloidal semiconductor NCs is still challenging. This challenge mainly lies in the long-term stability of device performance and low manufacturing cost. Some facile techniques for synthesizing colloidal semiconductor NCs with high quality, as well as for coating and packing the NCs, need to be explored for improving the stability of NLO device performance and reducing the cost.
For further development of the colloidal semiconductor NC-based photonic nanodevices, the following aspects may be considered. (1) Attempts to explore novel colloidal semiconductor NCs with excellent NLO properties, tunable and broad bandgap, and high damage threshold are still needed. (2) The core/shell structure or vdW-integrated heterostructure made by two or more suitable materials is expected to have excellent properties and studies on NC-based core/shell structures or vdW heterostructures are also exciting. (3) Exploration of efficient methods to obtain high quality NC film. It is reported that the NC film was prepared by using the electrospinning technique276 or the in situ inkjet printing strategy,331 indicating efficient ways to prepare uniform NC films. In addition to the electrospinning method and in situ inkjet printing strategy, other strategies are also required to be explored to fabricate high quality NC film. (4) More attempts to improve the NLO device parameters are expected. For example, the output pulsed laser performance could be further improved via many routes, such as improving the stability of the semiconductor NC-based saturable absorber, developing a suitable incorporation method, and optimizing the cavity design.
