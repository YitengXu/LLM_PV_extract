    , Accepted 13th September 2017First published on 13th September 2017AbstractIn the present work, we report the exploration of a transparent CdS@TiO2 nanotextile photoanode with boosted photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) efficiency and stability, by the controllable coating of an amorphous TiO2 ultrathin layer via the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The optimal CdS@TiO2 nanotextile photoanode with a 3.5 nm TiO2 ultrathin layer exhibits a photocurrent density of 1.8 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, which is 11 times higher than that of the pristine CdS counterpart. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of CdS@TiO2 ranges up to 47.5 mmol g−1 h−1, which is superior to those reported for one-dimensional CdS-based counterparts. Moreover, the photocurrent of CdS@TiO2 nanotextile photoanodes shows only 9% decay after 9 h, suggesting its profoundly enhanced PEC stability, in comparison with that of pristine CdS photoanodes (almost down to zero after 3 hours). It is verified that the introduced TiO2 nanoshells could limit the charge recombination, facilitate the charge separation, reduce the charge transfer resistance, and enhance the wettability of the electrodes, resulting in their significantly enhanced PEC performance.
1 Introduction
The production of chemical fuels by solar energy conversion is an attractive and sustainable solution to the energy problem. Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen by the direct use of sunlight is an ideal and renewable method for hydrogen production, which could integrate solar energy collection and water electrolysis into a single photoelectrode. Among the members of the semiconductor family, cadmium sulfide (CdS, with a direct band gap of 2.3 eV) is recognized as one of the most fascinating semiconductors, due to its versatile and exciting properties, such as a relatively low work function, excellent transport properties, unique photocatalytic activities and strong visible-light absorption, as well as high electronic mobility.1–3 In contrast to the traditional products, one-dimensional (1D) CdS nanowires (NWs) can provide direct electron pathways for rapid collection and transportation of the photo-generated electrons, which consequently bring an enhanced PEC performance to the photoelectrode.4–8 However, the inevitable oxidation of sulfide ions by the photogenerated holes is an intrinsic drawback of CdS-based photocatalysts,9,10 which greatly limits their practical applications.
Recently, numerous efforts have been made to suppress the photocorrosion of 1D CdS-based photocatalysts, such as by combining CdS with other semiconductors/polymers for hybrid photocatalysts,11–13 embedding CdS particles in mesoporous materials,14 using sacrificial agents such as sulfide and/or sulfite salts,15 and so on. Among these strategies, it is worth noting that surface coating of CdS with a thin layer (e.g., amorphous carbon, SiO2, TiO2 and ZnO) can be highly effective to stabilize the surface (i.e., lowering the toxicity of leached Cd2+ ions) and inhibit the photocorrosion process.6,15–20 For instance, Liu et al. prepared a nanotree-like ZnO branched hierarchical structure anchored on CdS nanorods through heteroepitaxial growth with significantly enhanced photoactivity for the selective reduction of 4-NA as compared to pure CdS NWs;21 Yang et al. reported 1D mutilayered MoS2 coatings on CdS nanowires, which facilitated the charge transfer and improved the performance of PEC cells.22 However, the exploration of CdS-based photoanodes with synergistically enhanced efficiency and stability is still a grand challenge.
Herein, we report the exploration of transparent core–shell CdS@TiO2 nanotextile films with enhanced PEC activities. Firstly, the large-area photoanodes of CdS nanotextile films were prepared through dispensing highly dispersed CdS NWs. The homogeneous nanotextile films were then coated with an ultra-thin TiO2 layer through the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process at low temperatures, with precisely controlled thicknesses and compositions at the angstrom scale. It is found that the coated pinhole-free TiO2 layers with fixed thicknesses of 0.5–10 nm are effective to stabilize the CdS textile electrode with improved PEC efficiencies, which could not only reliably suppress the active photocorrosion, but also create a tunneling barrier for photogenerated holes,23–26 suggesting their promising application for the efficient evolution of H2.
2 Experimental
2.1 Material
Cd(CH3COO)2 2H2O (99 wt%), S (≥99.98%) and ethylenediamine (≥99.8%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. FTO glass (7–8 ohm sq−1, OPV-FTO-22-07) was purchased from PV Tech. Co., Ltd.
2.2 Preparation of the anode electrode
The CdS NWs were fabricated via a facile hydrothermal method, similarly to the reported work.27 Specifically, 2 mmol Cd(CH3COO)2 2H2O and 4 mmol S powder were dissolved in 80 mL ethylenediamine and then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 200 °C for 12 h. Then the as-prepared CdS NWs (∼20 mg) were uniformly dispersed in a mixture of diacetone (600 μL) + distilled water (2 mL) under rigorous ultrasonication. In order to form a CdS nanotextile film with a uniform density distribution, the suspension (40 + 40 μL) was evenly distributed onto the exposed area (1.0 × 1.0 cm2, the remaining area was protected by insulating tape) of the conductive side of FTO glass (1.5 × 10 cm2, 7–8 ohm sq−1, OPV-FTO-22-07) at 65 °C. After rapid volatilization of organic compounds and vacuum drying under 60 °C, the electrode was cleaned with a mixture of acetone, ethanol and deionized water. The insulating tape on the edge of the FTO glass was removed once the suspension was dried in nitrogen. After that, the CdS textile electrode was obtained after maintaining it at 300 °C for 1 h under vacuum conditions. Subsequently, a copper wire was connected to the conductive side of the FTO glass using conductive silver tape, in which the uncoated parts were isolated with parafilm after the conductive silver tape was dried.
2.3 Structural characterization
The obtained products were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan), X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Quantax-STEM, Bruker, Germany), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS Ultra DLD, Shimadzu, Japan) using 150 W Al Kα radiation, and Raman spectroscopy (Raman spectrometer, inVia, Renishaw, UK) on excitation with 532 nm laser light. The UV-Vis measurements of the obtained electrodes were performed on a UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer (U-3900, Hitachi, Japan). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected at room temperature (RT) by using a spectrometer (Fluromax-4P, Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) excited using a He–Cd laser with a wavelength of 325 nm. The contact angle was tested on a Theta/Attension optical tensiometer. The theoretical simulations were carried out using the FDTD solutions software (Lumerical Solutions, Inc.).
2.4 Atomic layer deposition of TiO2
TiO2 films were deposited onto the CdS textile substrates at 150 °C using a Cambridge Nanotech S200 ALD system. The CdS textile substrates were prepared as described above and loaded immediately thereafter into the ALD chamber. Each ALD cycle consisted of a 0.05 s pulse of H2O, followed by a 0.10 s pulse of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%). A 25- s purge under a constant 0.05 L min−1 flow of research-grade N2 (g) was performed between each precursor pulse. When idle, the ALD system was maintained under a continuous N2 purge with a background pressure of 2.7 × 10−1 Torr. The ALD samples with 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 cycles of pulsed precursors were grown on CdS textile substrates, allowing the growth of TiO2 films with thicknesses of ∼0.3, 1, 2.2, 3.5, 4.1, 5.5, 7.7 and 10.3 nm, respectively, which responded to a growth rate of ∼1 Å per cycle. The ellipsometrically measured and fitted film thicknesses agreed with those obtained from TEM observations (Fig. S1†).
2.5 PEC water splitting experiments
The electrochemical analysis was carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell. The as-prepared CdS@nCTiO2 textile substrate (nC refers to the cycle number of ALD on the FTO electrode) was used as the working electrode. Ag/AgCl and Pt were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M Na2SO3 aqueous solutions were used as the electrolytes. The experiments were conducted using a 150 W Xe lamp with an AM1.5 filter and an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from the back (glass) side of the film. The linear-sweep voltammograms were recorded on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI Instruments). The measurement of incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was performed under illumination with respect to a calibrated silicon diode. The monochromatic light was supplied by xenon light illuminating through a Cornerstone monochromator. A chopper was placed after the monochromator, and the signal was collected by Merlin lock-in radiometry after amplification by a current preamplifier. Gas chromatography (Trustworthy Instrument, GC-2020N, China) was used to verify the composition of bubbles evolved both on the photoanode and the counter electrode. The impedance versus frequency spectrum study was performed at open circuit potential over the frequency range between 100 kHz and 0.01 Hz, with an AC voltage magnitude of 10 mV amplitude. The newly prepared ferri/ferrocyanide solution was set at 10 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 10 mM K4Fe(CN)6, and 1 M KCl. Cyclic voltammetry was performed at 100 mV s−1. The FTO glass was deposited with 3–10 nm TiO2via ALD, and the deposition of 5 nm Au was done by the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique. These modified FTO glasses, Ag/AgCl and Pt served as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and microstructure of CdS@nCTiO2 textiles

Fig. 1a presents a typical SEM image under a low magnification, suggesting the large-scale growth of CdS NWs. The magnified SEM image in Fig. 1b shows that the CdS NWs were randomly interlaced and tightly packed on the FTO substrate, resulting in a textile configuration. Fig. 1c is a typical digital photograph, showing uniform and compact CdS nanowire films with pale yellow color and high light transmittance, suggesting that they can significantly shorten the optical path length and reduce the light trapping.28 The CdS NWs with a mean diameter of ∼50 nm are piled up, leading to the formation of compact layers with an average thickness of ∼300 nm, as shown in Fig. 1d and e, respectively.

To hinder the photocorrosion of CdS, protective TiO2 nanolayers were deposited around the surface of CdS NWs through ALD. Owing to the fact that the electrical and optical activities of the heterostructures strongly depend on the shell thicknesses of the TiO2 nanolayer,29 we firstly carried out an investigation on the correlation between the shell thicknesses and the number of ALD cycles via HRTEM observations, as shown in Fig. S1.† It seems that the shell thicknesses increase linearly with the increase of ALD cycle numbers (Fig. S2†). According to the EDX pattern and elemental mappings (Fig. S3†), the surface state of CdS@TiO2 core/shell NWs has been changed, which comes from the ALD of TiO2 outlayers.

Fig. 2a shows the crystallographic structure of CdS/FTO and CdS@nCTiO2/FTO samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The diffraction peaks agree well with hexagonal CdS with lattice constants of a = b = 4.136 Å and c = 6.716 Å (JCPDS Card No. 41-1049), respectively. Notably, almost no diffractions could be ascribed to TiO2 in all samples, which are mainly attributed to the relatively low crystallinity and low content of TiO2 nanolayers within the core–shell hybrids. However, as compared to that of bare CdS NWs, the introduced TiO2 nanolayer makes a dramatic loss in the diffraction intensity. Fig. 2b shows the UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) of pristine CdS and CdS@nCTiO2 textile electrodes, implying that both of them absorb most of the visible light. With the increase of the ALD cycle numbers, their absorption peaks undergo a slight blue-shift, as marked by the dashed arrow, suggesting the growth of TiO2 films. Fig. 2c shows Raman spectra of pristine CdS and CdS@nCTiO2 textile films. The Raman patterns of the pristine CdS textile are centred at 300 cm−1 with a high intensity, which is assigned to the first order longitudinal optical (1 LO) and the 2 LO phonon mode at 600 cm−1.5 The spectra of CdS@TiO2 textile films, for comparison, have an additional peak at 149 cm−1,30 which can be attributed to the surface optical phonon vibration mode of Ti–O,31 confirming the presence of TiO2 nanolayers. As shown in Fig. 2d, the weak-light vertical line located at ∼150 cm−1 can be ascribed to the characteristic peak of amorphous TiO2 within the CdS@30CTiO2 textiles.

The obtained hybrid CdS@TiO2 NWs were further characterized by TEM (Fig. 3a), using the sample with 30 ALD cycles deposition. Obviously, a thin TiO2 layer can be observed, as compared to the pristine counterpart. Fig. 3b provides its selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, which can be indexed as hexagonal CdS (JCPDS Card No. 41-1049). The corresponding HRTEM image, as shown in Fig. 3c, represents its core–shell structure with a CdS core and a thin TiO2 shell (∼3.5 nm), respectively. The inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) image provides two sets of lattice fringe spacings of 0.24 and 0.32 nm, corresponding to the (102) and (101) planes of hexagonal CdS with an exposed (010) plane, respectively (Fig. 3d). The undetected TiO2 diffraction signal in the CdS@30CTiO2 sample implies its amorphous nature. Nonetheless, the EDX analysis (Fig. S3†) verifies the formation of a Cd-rich core and a Ti-rich shell within the as-fabricated CdS@30CTiO2 nanowire textile. Moreover, the XPS characterization further confirms the formation of CdS@TiO2 hybrids (Fig. S4†).

3.2 PEC performances of CdS@nCTiO2 textiles
To explore the solar water splitting activity of these textile electrodes, we employ PEC cells to measure their photocurrent densities. Fig. 4a shows the potential-dependent photocurrent densities (J–V) characteristics under the illumination of chopped AM 1.5 illumination on the CdS textiles with various ALD cycles. The pristine CdS textile exhibits a limited photocurrent density of 0.18 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE and large photocurrent decay, which is reduced to 0.09 mA cm−2 in the second scanning (Fig. S5†). However, their photocurrents are remarkably enhanced with the ALD of the TiO2 layer, regardless of the various ALD cycles introduced. The highest photocurrent density can be achieved once the ALD cycles are fixed at 30 (i.e., 2.8 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE), which is 11 times higher than that of the pristine CdS counterpart. However, it exhibits a slight decrease from 2.8 to 1.2 mA cm−2, with the layer thicknesses increased from 3.5 nm (30 ALD cycles) to 10.3 nm (100 ALD cycles, Fig. S2b†). Such TiO2-thickness-dependent photocurrent densities of the CdS@nCTiO2 nanotextiles could be mainly attributed to the fact that the integrated ultra-thin TiO2 with a suitable thickness would contribute to the generation of more separated charge carriers caused by the band bending at the interface of TiO2/CdS. Accordingly, a thick shell of TiO2 would reduce the photon absorption, especially in the visible light region. Fig. 4b shows their calculated photoconversion efficiencies (η), which is also termed the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) (see Notes S1†). The maximum ABPEs for the pristine CdS and CdS@nCTiO2 (nC = 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 C) electrodes are 0.15% (at −0.25 V vs. RHE), 0.31% (at 0.23 vs. RHE), 0.82% (at 0.21 V vs. RHE), 1.70% (at 0.05 V vs. RHE), 1.34% (at 0.18 V vs. RHE), 1.12% (at 0.14 V vs. RHE) and 0.57% (at 0.33 V vs. RHE), respectively, evidencing the enhanced photoconversion efficiencies of CdS@nCTiO2 textiles. To further investigate the photoresponse of the CdS@nCTiO2 electrodes, their transient photocurrent densities at 0.1 V vs. RHE under light chopping are studied, as shown in Fig. 4c. All the textile electrodes behave a rapid photoresponse under the chopped illumination, signifying that the charge transport has been significantly enhanced. Moreover, it discloses that the stability of the photocurrent densities of the CdS@nCTiO2 electrodes is remarkably improved as compared to that of the pristine CdS counterpart. Fig. 4d shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to disclose the interface charge transport response. Apparently, the arc radius of the CdS@30CTiO2 textile electrode is much smaller than those of pristine CdS and other CdS@TiO2 hybrids with different ALD cycles. As we know, a smaller arc in the Nyquist plot represents a lower charge transfer resistance at the interface of the electrode, and thus facilitates a faster interfacial charge transfer and more efficient separation of the photo-induced electron–hole pairs.32 These results as mentioned above demonstrate that the CdS@30CTiO2 textile electrodes significantly boost the charge mobility by limiting the recombination of holes and electrons, which is compliant with its faster and higher photoresponse.

(b) The corresponding photoconversion efficiencies. (c) The corresponding photocurrent responses held at 0.1 V vs. RHE under chopped illumination and N2 purging. (d) The corresponding Nyquist plots at open-circuit potential. 

Fig. 5a shows the current–time chronoamperometric response of the CdS@30CTiO2 textile electrode at 0 V vs. RHE over 9 h, which suggests its high durability with only a 9% attenuation of the initial current density, clarifying its satisfactory photoelectrochemical stability, while for the pristine CdS counterpart, the photocurrent density is profoundly decayed to almost zero, demonstrating that the deposited 3.5 nm TiO2 thin layer around the CdS plays a crucial role in its stability. This trend is also observed in PEC measurements in a 1 M NaSO4 electrolyte with little significant attenuation for the CdS@30CTiO2 textile electrode (Fig. S6†), demonstrating that the TiO2 thin layer can perfectly protect the CdS textile core. Besides, the XRD patterns of the CdS@30CTiO2 textile electrode before and after the PEC reaction of 9 h show almost no change, indicating that the structure of the CdS@30CTiO2 textile electrode has excellent long-term PEC stability. The production of H2 gas is determined by the formation of bubbles evolving off the photocathode immediately after illumination and during the stability measurement, which is given in Fig. 5b. After passing 38.5 C through the photoanode under continuous illumination at 0 V vs. RHE, an amount of 4.45 mL of H2 gas is detected by gas chromatography measurements, which is consistent with the expected amount of 4.46 mL, corresponding to a Faradaic efficiency close to 100%. More interestingly, as shown in Table S1,† the photocurrent (1.8 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE) and photocatalytic H2 evolution rates (47.5 mmol g−1 h−1) of the CdS@30CTiO2 textile are superior to those recently reported for 1D CdS-based photocatalysts.11,15,33–48 Meanwhile, the PEC activities of the CdS@30CTiO2 textile electrode can be comparable to those of CdS-based cocatalysts, which are composed of other typical ones such as WS2, MoS2, Pt or Ni2P (e.g., CdS/WS2, 27.5 mmol g−1 h−1; MoS2/CdS, 58.3 mmol g−1 h−1; 5% Pt/CdS-N, 16.27 mmol g−1 h−1; Ni2P/CdS, 553 mmol g−1 h−1).33,35,39,43,49,50

3.3 Discussion on the heterostructure framework that contributed to PEC activities

Fig. 6a shows the proposed mechanism to clarify the role of the built core–shell structures of CdS@TiO2 in the PEC performances. The optical band gaps of amorphous TiO2 and CdS are indicated from Tauc plots in Fig. S8.† The CdS core is a narrow bandgap semiconductor whose conduction band is more negative than that of TiO2, which greatly improves the production and separation of photo-induced electrons and holes. Therefore, the photon-excited electrons in the valence band are injected into the conduction band of the CdS core. Afterwards, the electrons are rapidly transported from the conduction band of the CdS core to the conduction band of the TiO2 shell, followed by being transferred laterally to the counter electrode for the hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, at the interface between the CdS@TiO2 textile film and the electrolyte, the ultrathin TiO2 shell can act as a passivation layer, yet does not impede the hole injection from the CdS core into the electrolyte (the detailed discussion is proposed in the following section).18 Consequently, the holes maintained in the valence band of the CdS core are tunneled through the ultrathin TiO2 shell and can be efficiently trapped by the sacrificial reagent to accomplish a whole loop circuit. It is worth noting here that a TiO2 layer with ∼3 nm thickness could not only protect the CdS nanotextures against photocorrosion, but prompt efficient transport of electrons and holes, which was also reported similarly in an Ir/2 nm TiO2/n-Si system.25

(c) Cyclic voltammograms of the ferri/ferrocyanide solution for FTO/3 nm TiO2/5 nm Au (light), FTO/10 nm TiO2/5 nm Au (light) and FTO/3 nm TiO2/5 nm Au (dark). (d) The IPCE spectra of CdS, CdS@30CTiO2 and TiO2 electrodes collected at 0 V vs. RHE. (e–f) The simulated cross-sectional electromagnetic wave distributions of the CdS and CdS@TiO2 nanowires at a wavelength of 300 nm. 
To validate the above speculations, the valence band maximum (VBM) edges of CdS and CdS@TiO2 textiles are found to be ∼1.86 and 2.03 eV below the Fermi level (Ef), respectively, based on the valence band (EVB) X-ray photoelectron spectra (VBXPS) in Fig. 6b. The EVB shift of 0.17 eV will cause the holes to be transferred from the VB edge of TiO2 to that of CdS. Thus, the type-II band alignment in the semiconductor nanoheterostructure would cause the photo-induced carriers to migrate between CdS and TiO2. Besides, the introduced TiO2 nanolayer on the CdS textile further lowers the kinetic barrier for interfacial charge transition at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which enhances the migration rate of the electrons and holes in the PEC. These behaviors agree well with the Mott–Schottky analyses (Fig. S9 and Notes S2†), where the flat band potential of the CdS textile electrode is 800 mV lower than that of the TiO2 film. In order to clarify the role of the protection layer, the efficiency of charge carrier transport across the ultrathin layer (TiO2) was characterized using an electrolyte solution composed of ferri/ferrocyanide ions. It seems that the sample without light illumination exhibited no observable Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox peaks, indicating that hot electrons can be activated by the introduction of Au nanoparticles (NPs) under illumination.51 The FTO with 3 nm ALD-TiO2 and 5 nm Au displayed a symmetry cyclic voltammetry curve, indicating the efficiency of the redox process, in which the anodic peak is due to the photo-generated holes (Fig. 6c). In contrast, light cyclic voltammetry of FTO/10 nm-TiO2/5 nm Au reveals an asymmetric form with a significantly weakened anodic peak. This is consistent with the presence of electrons to reduce Fe(III) and lack of sufficient holes to oxidize Fe(II), which evidences the decreased hole transfer of the thick TiO2 shell layer. It is also the cause of the low photocurrent response observed from the CdS@100CTiO2 (with ∼10 nm layer of TiO2) electrode as compared to that of CdS@30CTiO2. The rapid separation of electrons and holes at the CdS@TiO2 textile anode–electrode interface could prolong the lifetime of photo-generated carriers. Furthermore, according to the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements at 0 V versus RHE (Fig. 6d), the wavelength of the photoresponse for the CdS@30CTiO2 textile is over 10% between 300 and 500 nm with a maximum IPCE of ∼20% at 300 nm. By contrast, the pristine CdS textile electrode shows a photoresponse from 320 to 600 nm with an IPCE below 5%. To illustrate the effect of the TiO2 layer on the PEC activities of CdS@30CTiO2 electrodes, the cross-sectional electromagnetic wave distributions of individual CdS NWs without and with ultrathin TiO2 coatings (Fig. 6e and f) are modeled by finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulations, to clarify the changes of the electric fields under the UV light irradiation. The FDTD simulation was chosen from the longitudinal section model derived from the cross-section view of the SEM image, showing the tightly packed NWs, as shown in Fig. S10.† It seems that both NWs show low reflectance at 300 nm (Fig. 6e). However, in comparison with the pristine CdS counterpart, the electric field interaction within CdS@TiO2 NWs has been greatly enhanced by forming apparent cavity resonance (the electric field is enhanced by 6 times in this local area, as shown in Fig. 6f), implying the significantly enhanced generation and transfer of photo-induced carriers. The cavity resonance is of great significance for the improvement of PEC performance. In order to verify this point, a planar CdS film was electrodeposited on the FTO substrate with 300 nm thickness, followed by the identical TiO2 ALD deposition (Fig. S11a†). This discloses that a CdS@30CTiO2 planar film shows no obvious cavity resonance in comparison with the textile film (Fig. S11b† and Fig. 6f). Significantly, the flat film shows 2 times lower photocurrent density (photocurrent density of 1.0 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE) than that of the textile film, which exhibits a highly dense cavity resonance (Fig. S11c†). The extended lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers can be illustrated by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. S12†). A sharp protuberance at 532 nm in the PL intensity is observed for the pristine CdS textile electrode, while that of CdS@TiO2 is rather weaker owing to the suppressed recombination of photo-induced carriers, which contributes to the PEC activity for H2 evolution.52 The residual weak PL peak of the CdS@TiO2 textile at ∼528 nm can be ascribed to the near-band-edge emission.
In order to further clarify the relationship between the thicknesses of TiO2 films and the PEC performances, the charge separation properties were probed,53,54 as shown in Notes S3 and Fig. S13.† It seems that, as compared to that of the pristine CdS counterpart, the charge separation efficiency (ηsep) has been improved by more than 1 order of magnitude after the surface modification of TiO2 with 30 ALD cycles (18% at the applied potential of 0.6 vs. RHE), which implies that the deposited TiO2 nanoshell is beneficial for improving the electrical conducting properties of CdS. The increased IPCE is primarily derived from the higher value of ηsep in the CdS@TiO2 heterojunction photoanode (Fig. 6d), since the diameter of CdS NWs (∼30 nm) is much shorter than the effective diffusion length of electrons in CdS (∼0.65 μm).55 However, the charge separation efficiency exhibits only 3-fold improvement by the surface modification of TiO2 with 100 ALD cycles, clarifying that too thick a TiO2 layer exceeding a certain value (∼3–4 nm) would bring about a deleterious effect on the charge separation efficiency.
The wettability of the anode electrode is considered another important issue affecting the PEC activities.56,57Fig. 7a and b present the hydrophilic performance of the water droplets on the electrode surface. The contact angle of the CdS@TiO2 textile electrode is ∼38.5° (Fig. 7a), which is much less than that of the pristine CdS counterpart, i.e., up to ∼97.3° (Fig. 7b), indicating that the CdS@TiO2 textile is highly hydrophilic. The desired smaller contact angle is due to the high content of Ti-OH induced by the ALD treatment (Fig. S4e†). The as-prepared highly hydrophilic frameworks can increase the wettability of the electrodes, facilitate access to electrolytes, and consequently enhance the activity and reaction kinetics (Fig. 7c).

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the exploration of transparent CdS@TiO2 nanotextile photoanodes with totally enhanced PEC activities. The large-area core–shell CdS@TiO2 nanotextile photoanode was prepared through dispensing highly dispersed CdS NWs followed by depositing TiO2 layers via the ALD technique. The introduced ultrathin TiO2 layer prevents the photocorrosion of CdS, and the desired transparency of CdS@TiO2 nanotextile films is beneficial for constructing the front electrode in the PEC system. It was discovered that the CdS nanotextile conformally coated with TiO2 nanolayers with a thickness of 3.5 nm exhibits a remarkably improved stability with the highest photoresponse, which could be 11 times higher than that of the pristine CdS counterpart. Its photocurrent and photocatalytic H2 evolution rate are up to 1.8 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE and 47.5 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively, which are superior to those reported for 1D CdS-based photocatalysts. The enhanced photoeletrochemical activities could be mainly attributed to the introduced TiO2 nanoshells around the surface of CdS NWs, which could limit the recombination of holes and electrons, facilitate the migration of the photo-generated carriers, enhance the wettability of the electrode, as well as improve the electrical conducting properties of the CdS matrix.
