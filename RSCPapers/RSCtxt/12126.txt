    , Accepted 13th March 2020First published on 14th March 2020AbstractWe experimentally demonstrate that oriented assembly of red algal photosystem I (PSI) reaction centers on a plasmonically active Silver Island Film (SIF) leads to strong enhancement of both the fluorescence intensity and photocurrent generated upon illumination. PSI complexes were specifically attached to a monolayer of graphene deposited on the SIF layer. The results of comprehensive fluorescence microscopy point to the critical role of the SIF layer in enhancing the optical response of PSI, as we observe increased emission intensity. Hence, importantly, the strong increase of photocurrent generation demonstrated for the biohybrid electrodes can be directly associated with the plasmonic enhancement of the optical and electrochemical functionalities of PSI. The results also indicate that the graphene layer is not diminishing the influence of the plasmonic excitations in SIF on the absorption and emission of PSI.
Introduction
Controlled assembly of hybrid nanostructures, where each component provides a desired function, has been at the same time the key challenge and requirement for designing optimal functional materials. Such an approach may often yield materials with multiple functionality, frequently described in the context of optoelectronics,1,2 biosensing,3,4 theranostics,5 and solar energy conversion.6–8 In many of these areas, metallic nanostructures, which feature plasmon resonance, have been particularly important and useful as nanoscale antennae for both influencing the optical response of emitters9–11 and directing the emission.12 The unique ability of metallic nanoparticles to increase the efficiency of light absorption and fluorescence quantum yield has been applied not only for efficient sensing down to single molecules9,13 or local precise heating in photothermal therapy,14,15 but also to increase the catalytic reactivity in hybrid nanostructures.16,17
In this work, we demonstrate successful fabrication of a hybrid device, where the efficiency of energy conversion in photosystem I (PSI) natural photosynthetic complexes is enhanced through plasmonic coupling with metallic nanostructures. It is achieved by controlled oriented assembly of PSI on Single Layer Graphene (SLG) placed on Silver Island Film (SIF). The PSI complexes are structures composed of over 200 photoactive/redox active cofactors, predominantly chlorophylls (Chls) and carotenoids (Cars), but also 2 phylloquinones and 3 iron–sulphur clusters, which all take part in primary photosynthetic solar-to-energy conversion processes.18,19 The combination of high (reaching almost 100%) quantum efficiency of the charge separation process (ratio of separated charges to absorbed energy quanta) with robustness of the PSI complexes against illumination, temperature or pH renders these natural photosynthetic complexes attractive building blocks in solar energy-converting devices.18,20–22
There are a number of high-quality reports focused on interfacing PSI complexes (or other photosynthetic reaction centers) with other materials for efficient implementation of these biomolecules in solar energy conversion. Promising results regarding functionality of photosynthetic hybrid structures have been obtained for various photoactive biomolecules immobilized on metallic electrodes,23–26 nanoparticles and nanostructures,27–30 or rough surfaces,31,32 as well as on various semiconductors.32–35 Moreover, incorporation of PSI complexes into scaffolds of suitable architecture has been shown to tune and improve their photoactive functionality,36 in particular with regard to enhancing the photocurrent generation37 and stability.38
We have previously shown that oriented immobilization of PSI complexes on graphene via cytochrome c553 (cyt c553), a redox active protein cofactor that serves as the natural electron donor to photooxidized PSI,39 results in generation of cathodic photocurrents reaching densities up to 370 nA cm−2 for an overpotential of −300 mV. Graphene and other carbon-based materials were used as substrates for attaching PSI complexes, owing to the rather exceptional electrical, chemical and mechanical properties.40 Graphene features nearly constant, wavelength-independent absorption over the whole visible spectral range, which makes it an attractive energy and electron acceptor for various emitters, including photosynthetic complexes.40–43 Importantly, interfacing graphene-based materials and PSI complexes leads to generation of photocurrents44–46 that can be further improved by conjugating PSI with graphene using developed protocols of surface chemical modifications.47,48
Here, we combine the strategy for the specific attachment of PSI complexes to the SLG substrate with the incorporation of a planar plasmonic nanostructure, SIF, which has been used previously to increase the absorption of photosynthetic complexes.9,49–51 Indeed, for PSI complexes deposited on SIF, a 100-fold enhancement of the fluorescence intensity has been reported,49 although without any control over the PSI orientation and its distance to the SIF layer. Both these parameters are critical in controlling the interaction. An important question standing out from these results concerns translating the effect of the plasmonic enhancement of the optical properties of PSI complexes into their electrochemical activity. There are so many effects involved in conversion of solar energy into charges and/or fuels that the efficiency of the whole process can be improved at several stages, including enhancement of the absorption cross-section of photosynthetic complexes coupled with metallic nanoparticles.
Our experiments obtained for PSI complexes deposited with controlled orientation on a plasmonically active SIF layer on SLG demonstrate strong enhancement of photocurrent generation. The monolayer of graphene acts as a conductive, highly transparent platform that facilitates: (1) oriented binding of PSI complexes, and (2) charge and energy transfer between PSI and SLG. We find on average over a 5-fold enhancement of the photocurrent density, associated with modification of the optical properties of PSI through coupling with the plasmonic excitations in the SIF layer, as evidenced by the strong increase of the emission intensity.
Materials and methods
Preparation of bioelectrodes
The procedure of bioelectrode fabrication is depicted schematically in Fig. S1 (ESI†). First, a SIF layer was deposited on the FTO substrate using the procedure published previously for glass substrates.9 In the second step, the SIF layer was covered with SLG, transferred beforehand from Cu foil, as described previously.52–54 In order to facilitate the specific attachment of PSI complexes, the SLG surface was functionalized with a moiety containing Co-NTA-pyrene and cyt c553, as described in detail in ref. 39. In the final step of bioelectrode fabrication, the PSI complexes from Cyanidioschyzon merolae, purified as in ref. 22 and 34, were attached to the bioelectrodes39 by dipping the electrodes in the PSI suspension. In this way, a structure with several layers of PSI on SLG can be obtained.45 As shown previously,39 the three-dimensional organization of PSI/cyt c553 features a stack of about 6–7 PSI monolayers, leading to an approximately 85 nm thick PSI multilayer (as the thickness of the PSI complex in the membrane plane is 10.6 nm). In addition to the structure containing the SIF layer, a reference one without the plasmonic layer was fabricated in parallel.
Optical characterization
The morphology and optical properties of the structures were characterized using a Zeiss/Supra 55 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy with a Cary 50 spectrophotometer, respectively. The obtained SLG on SIF/FTO surface was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (WITec alpha300 Raman microscope) (Fig. S2, ESI†).
Wide-field fluorescence microscopy of biohybrid electrodes was carried out using a microscope equipped with LED illuminators of wavelengths: 365 nm, 405 nm, 480 nm, 535 nm, and 630 nm, keeping the power constant and equal to 100 μW. A dichroic mirror (Semrock, FF665 DiO2) and appropriate filters (Thorlabs, FELH0650 and FB690-10) were used for selecting the PSI emission. For experiments a microscope objective lens (Nikon, LPlan SLWD 100×, NA = 0.70) was used in conjunction with an EMCCD detector (Andor, iXon3). An acquisition time of 0.5 s and gain of 300 were applied throughout.
Photoelectrochemical analysis
Photoelectrochemical experiments were performed with a Versa STAT 3 (Princeton Applied Research) potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with a KL 2500 LCD halogen white light source (Schott). All measurements were conducted in a Teflon three-electrode cell filled with 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing FTO glass as a working electrode (WE), an Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference (REF), and a glassy carbon rod as a counter electrode (CE). The bioelectrodes were connected with copper tape with a conductive adhesive (6.4 mm width, 1181, 3 M) to provide electrical contact. The geometric surface area of the analyzed samples was calculated as 0.4185 cm2 according to the Viton O-ring with its internal diameter of 7.3 mm. Before each photochronoamperometric experiment the open circuit potential (OCP) was recorded under dark conditions until a stable potential was achieved. During photochronoamperometric measurements all the samples were illuminated with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at different potentials (vs. REF/OCP) with 30 s light ON/OFF periods. All the electrochemical experiments were conducted in aerobic conditions at ambient temperature.
Results and discussion
Structural and optical characterization of bioelectrodes
Scanning electron microscopy images of the SIF/FTO substrates before and after covering with the SLG layer are shown in Fig. S3a and b (ESI†), respectively. The SIF layer fabricated on FTO features islands of irregular shapes, with sizes in the range from 50 nm to 300 nm. They are well separated and rather uniformly placed over the whole area of the sample. In the background of the images displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†), crystals of FTO are visible. Clearly the morphology of the SIF layer is different, as compared with previous studies,49,50,55 where the islands were denser and generally smaller in diameter. Upon covering the SIF layer with SLG, the image becomes less sharp due to lowering the contrast with the graphene layer. We found that the SLG layer was of high quality, with essentially no defects. Raman scattering spectra confirmed the successful transfer of the graphene layer onto the FTO surface. The D, G and 2D peaks were identified following excitation of SLG on SIF/FTO substrates at 488 nm, and their energies were measured at 1331 cm−1, 1584 cm−1, and 2657 cm−1, respectively (see Fig. S2, ESI†). Moreover, the very low intensity of the D band and a sharp and symmetrical 2D band in conjunction with a high 2D/G peak intensity ratio of 2.8 (Fig. S2, ESI†) confirm the high structural quality of the SLG used for bioelectrode assembly. Such substrates were further used for assembling bioelectrodes as described previously,39 with the difference in the ion used for coordinating His-tagged cyt c553 used for orienting PSI complexes.29 Namely, instead of Ni, Co was used as the metal redox center. The choice of metal redox center within the organic conductive pyrene-NTA interface was motivated by the recent work postulating improved cathodic direct electron transfer for such metal coordination.56,57
The monomeric PSI complex from an extremophilic red microalga Cyanidioschyzon merolae is a pigment–protein supercomplex containing in total 157–210 Chl a molecules and 35–54 Cars depending on the growth conditions of the cells from which it is obtained.18,22,58 Of all the pigments, a pair of Chl a molecules forms the primary charge-separation reaction center (so-called P700) with 2 additional Chl pairs, 2 phylloquinones, and 3 iron–sulfur clusters serving as electron transfer cofactors. The remaining Chls and Cars play a role in light-harvesting and photoprotection.22,59,60 The absorption spectrum of PSI (Fig. 1, black curve) shows contributions of both Chl a and Cars. The Soret band of Chl a is located in the UV-blue spectral region, while the second strong absorption band located in the red spectral region can be attributed to the Qy transition of Chl a. Absorption of Cars can be found in the green spectral region. The fluorescence emission of the PSI complex in buffer solution (Fig. 1, green curve) is observed at 678 nm, and it originates from the electronic transitions in Chl a molecules. The broadening of the PSI emission towards longer wavelengths can be attributed to so-called red chlorophylls, characterized by lower energies of excited states with respect to the major population of Chl a molecules.61,62
 Fig. 1  Spectral characterization of SIF and PSI. The extinction spectrum of SIF is shown in violet, while the absorption and emission spectra of PSI in buffer solution are presented as black and green lines, respectively. The emission spectrum was measured using excitation at 405 nm. 
The extinction spectrum of the SIF layer (Fig. 1, violet curve) exhibits a broad peak, which can be attributed to the plasmon resonance in the silver islands.49,50 Its maximum is located around 430 nm, but the resonance broadens strongly towards longer wavelengths, reaching the near-infrared spectral region. One of the key parameters determining the strength of interaction between an emitter and a metallic nanostructure is the overlap between its absorption/emission spectra and the plasmon resonance. Comparison of the optical spectra displayed in Fig. 1 indicates strong overlap between the SIF plasmon resonance and the absorption of PSI, supporting pronounced interaction of pigments within the photosynthetic complex and plasmon excitations in the SIF layer.
Fluorescence studies
Fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy provide insight into interactions that occur between the components of the bioelectrode, such as plasmon coupling31,61 and energy transfer.43,63 Wide-field fluorescence microscopy imaging was applied to assess the homogeneity of PSI deposition on the SLG substrates, as well as the excitation wavelength-dependence of the PSI fluorescence intensity. The experiments were carried out on samples containing PSI complexes oriented with the P700 photochemical reaction center toward the SLG surface via the pyrene-NTA-Co-His-cyt c553 interface (PSI@SLG and PSI@SLG/SIF, respectively in Fig. 2). We also measured non-emitting blank samples without PSI complexes. In general, the approach was based on collecting fluorescence images for the same area of the electrode upon sequential illumination by light with wavelengths of 630 nm, 535 nm, 480 nm, 405 nm, and 365 nm. Many such sequences were obtained for each structure to assure statistically relevant datasets and reinforce the conclusions.
 Fig. 2  Wide-field fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence intensity maps obtained for samples PSI@SLG and PSI@SLG/SIF excited at 480 nm are shown in panels (a) and (c), respectively. The results collected for these samples excited at 630 nm are presented in panels (b) and (d), respectively. 
In Fig. 2 we show representative fluorescence intensity maps measured for PSI@SLG and PSI@SLG/SIF electrodes excited at 480 nm and 630 nm. The images measured for a given architecture feature similar patterns of bright and dark fields, indicating that they were obtained for the same sample area. For the PSI@SLG samples the images are rather homogeneous, indicating uniformity of both the coverage by PSI complexes and the interaction between PSI complexes and graphene. Random, clearly visible areas of irregular shapes, characterized by considerably higher fluorescence intensities, can be attributed either to PSI aggregates or defects in the SLG sheet, which would result in higher emission intensities of PSI complexes due to the absence of energy transfer.41,42 In contrast, for the PSI@SLG/SIF electrode the observed fluorescence intensities for both excitation wavelengths are considerably higher than for PSI@SLG due to the plasmon enhancement of PSI fluorescence.
The interaction between plasmon excitations and emitters is very complex and different mechanisms can be observed depending on the distance between interacting objects: the optimal distance for observation of metal enhanced fluorescence is around 8 nm–20 nm.64 For longer distances the impact of plasmon excitations on the optical properties of emitters decreases gradually. However, shorter distances of only a few nanometers often lead to strong energy transfer from excited molecules to metallic nanoparticles, leading to quenching of the emission.65 In this respect, the SLG layer combined with all the associated chemistry may play not only a role of a nanoengineered conductive platform for controlled PSI deposition and reducing of its P700 reaction center side, but it can also act as a spacer between plasmonically active SIF and photosystems, providing spatial separation, which could be desired from the point of view of optimizing their performance via plasmonic effects. The estimated length of the electron transfer chain used for immobilization of PSI, containing cyt c553 molecules and Co-NTA groups, is around 70 Å,66,67 suggesting that plasmon-enhanced fluorescence of PSI could be indeed expected. However, the possible interactions are here even more sophisticated as the impact of graphene needs to be also taken into consideration. Graphene and its derivatives are well known as energy and charge acceptors.40,43 Therefore, the presence of SLG in the bioelectrode can modify both the optical and electrochemical properties, as we have shown previously.39
It is well established that the interaction between plasmon excitations and emitters is strongly spectrally- and distance-dependent.64 In addition to the spectral overlap between the plasmon resonance and the emission/absorption bands of the emitters (see Fig. 1), the distance dependence should also be taken into account as PSI complexes contain many photoactive cofactors. As the size of the PSI complexes (14 nm × 4 nm)59,60 is comparable to the spatial range of plasmonic interactions, even some subpopulations of cofactors within the same protein complex can interact with the plasmon excitation in the SIF layer in a different manner. For instance, the subset of pigments within PSI located very close to the SIF layer can be quenched due to energy transfer, while some more distant pigments can exhibit optimal conditions for plasmonic enhancement. Consequently, in the case of plasmonic biohybrid electrodes a much broader distribution of fluorescence intensities is expected.31,68 Indeed, this effect is observed in Fig. 3, where the distributions of the emission intensities measured for all sets acquired experimentally are plotted. The results obtained for the PSI@SLG/SIF and PSI@SLG electrodes are represented by blue and grey bars, respectively, and in the case of the former the distributions are substantially broader. Such broadening has been frequently observed for similar hybrid devices.9,50,51,69 Remarkably, the emission intensities measured for the PSI@SLG/SIF electrode are considerably higher than for the PSI@SLG sample for both excitation wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 3. We attribute both the increase of the PSI emission intensity and the broadening of the intensity distribution to the emergence of the plasmon interactions between the PSI complexes and the SIF layer.
 Fig. 3  Fluorescence intensity analysis. Histograms of the fluorescence intensity for samples PSI@SLG (grey bars) and PSI@SLG/SIF (blue bars) are shown in panels (a) and (b), for excitation at 480 nm and 630 nm, respectively. 
As wide-field fluorescence imaging of PSI-based bioelectrodes was carried out for five different excitation wavelengths,39 it was possible to extract the excitation wavelength dependence of the emission intensity measured for both electrodes: PSI@SLG and PSI@SLG/SIF. By dividing the values obtained for the plasmonically active bioelectrode (PSI@SLG/SIF) by the reference one (PSI@SLG), we calculated the dependence of the average fluorescence enhancement on the excitation wavelength, as displayed in Fig. 4. Interestingly, the highest value of the enhancement (8.9) was obtained for the 535 nm excitation, which corresponds to the absorption minimum for the PSI complex (see Fig. 1). This enhancement is most likely due to plasmonic interactions with the so-called ‘blind’ chlorophylls present in the structure of PSI, in line with the previous study.29 Excitation at 365 nm yielded the lowest enhancement of 4.5. This excitation wavelength corresponds mainly to the Chl a Soret band. The spectral dependence of the enhancement factor is non-monotonic, as often observed for multichromophoric systems, where different molecules are present and the interactions between them and with the plasmon excitations in metallic nanostructures can be rather complex.29,51,69 While the curve shown in Fig. 4 differs from the absorption of the PSI complexes, it at the same time is rather similar in shape to the SIF extinction spectrum, although somewhat red-shifted. This red-shift may be due to the change in local refractive index around the SIF, due to the presence of both SLG and PSI complexes. We conclude that such a clear dependence of the fluorescence enhancement on the excitation wavelength is directly associated with the interaction between electronic states of the pigments of PSI and the plasmon excitations in the SIF layer.

Electrochemical analysis
In order to determine the impact of plasmonic excitations in the SIF layer on photocurrent generation in the PSI-based bioelectrode, we carried out photochronoamperometric studies on both the PSI@SLG/SIF and PSI@SLG samples. Fig. 5 shows representative photocurrents recorded for the electrode containing the SIF layer compared with the reference at a potential of −300 mV. The incorporation of the SIF layer in the electrode structure results in an approximately 5-fold enhancement of the photocurrent output.
 Fig. 5  Photochronoamperometric analysis of PSI-based bioelectrodes with (blue line) and without (black line) the SIF layer. Photocurrents have been recorded in 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) under aerobic conditions. Recorded signals were normalized vs. the current axis (n = 2). 

Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent densities obtained for the PSI-based bioelectrode (blue) compared with the reference (black). In general, within the whole potential range applied (from +100 mV to −300 mV), we observe a significant enhancement of the cathodic photocurrent densities for the structures involving the SIF layer (compare Fig. 6 and Fig. S4, ESI†). Control experiments carried out for structures without any proteins reveal the positive effect of the SIF in the case of the reference electrodes. In general, the current density is slightly higher or similar for the SLG-based electrodes with the SIF in the potential range used in the study. Functionalization of FTO/SLG electrodes with pyrene-NTA-Co2+ (SLG:Co sample in Fig. S4, ESI†) is unlikely to result in significant electron transfer in the potential range of +100 mV to −100 mV (see Fig. S4, ESI†) as the current density values are similar to those obtained for the control samples. Interestingly, application of a more negative external potential (−200 mV and −300 mV) results in a 3- and 6-fold (respectively) increase of the photocurrent densities compared to those recorded at 0 mV from the SLG:Co reference electrode. Thus, we conclude that the cooperative action of SIF and the pyrene-NTA-Co2+ conductive interface may lead to significant electron transfer from the SLG-electrode to the pyrene-NTA-Co2+ complex. This effect is even more pronounced upon including the PSI layer, as in the full assembly. Moreover, our control experiments demonstrate a conductive behavior of the SIF layer. The currents generated from the SLG-pyrene-NTA-Co2+ samples prepared on the SIF are significantly higher compared to those without the SIF layer (compare the SLG:Co/SIF and SLG:Co samples in Fig. S4, ESI†). This difference is found over the whole range of applied potentials and is increasing when applying more negative potentials. Thus, at −300 mV, the current density reaches 224.4 nA cm−2, which translates to more than a 7-fold increase compared to the currents obtained at no bias (see Fig. S4, ESI†). With no external bias applied, the photocurrent output for the PSI@SLG/SIF structure is over 22.6-fold improved over the result measured for the PSI@SLG reference. Indeed, at the OCP, the average value of current densities recorded from two independent measurements reached around 5 nA cm−2. The cathodic photocurrents obtained for the PSI@SLG bioelectrode were increased by applying an external negative bias, achieving a maximum value of 340 nA cm−2 at −200 mV. In contrast, the highest values of the photocurrent densities (1.50 μA cm−2) for the PSI@SLG/SIF bioelectrode were detected at −300 mV external bias, thus yielding a 5.4-fold enhancement over the PSI-based sample without the SIF layer (280 nA cm−2, see Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Comparison of photocurrent densities obtained for two bioelectrodes at different bias voltages. The results measured for the PSI@SLG sample are shown as grey bars, whereas the results for the PSI@SLG/SIF assembly are presented as blue bars. Photocurrents have been recorded in 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) under aerobic conditions. Results taken from two independently prepared electrodes (n = 2). 
As expected, when a positive bias of +100 mV was applied the resultant anodic photocurrent densities generated on both electrodes were lower compared to the cathodic photocurrents, confirming the preferential orientation of PSI with its P700 reaction center towards the SLG surface.39 Importantly, the specific orientation of the first layer of PSI with its hole-generating side towards the SLG surface provides an efficient entry point for the electrons ejected from the SLG electrode. This is exactly the rationale behind orienting the PSI layer closest to the SLG surface as a means to minimize any wasteful back reactions. Indeed, it is strong evidence that appropriate orientation of the first PSI monolayer on various types of electrode materials provides without a doubt a rational approach to significantly improve the photocurrent output.34,39 Therefore, we conclude that the plasmonic interactions between SIF and PSI complexes assembled in an oriented way on a graphene electrode, as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy, lead to considerable enhancement of the photocurrent output.
Conclusions
We demonstrate that incorporation of a plasmonically active SIF layer in a bioelectrode employing robust PSI complexes attached specifically to graphene leads to enhancement of both light harvesting and electrochemical functionalities of the device. This is manifested respectively by a strong, spectrally-dependent increase of the PSI emission intensity, and an improvement of the photocurrent generation. Our experiments carried out on a rationally designed oriented photocathodic energy conversion assembly confirm and underline the potential for applying plasmonic excitations in metallic nanostructures for improving the performance of solar cells, especially those involving naturally evolved photosynthetic proteins.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Spectral characterization of SIF and PSI. The extinction spectrum of SIF is shown in violet, while the absorption and emission spectra of PSI in buffer solution are presented as black and green lines, respectively. The emission spectrum was measured using excitation at 405 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  Wide-field fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence intensity maps obtained for samples PSI@SLG and PSI@SLG/SIF excited at 480 nm are shown in panels (a) and (c), respectively. The results collected for these samples excited at 630 nm are presented in panels (b) and (d), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  Fluorescence intensity analysis. Histograms of the fluorescence intensity for samples PSI@SLG (grey bars) and PSI@SLG/SIF (blue bars) are shown in panels (a) and (b), for excitation at 480 nm and 630 nm, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Wavelength-dependence of the fluorescence enhancement factor. The presented enhancement factors were calculated as the ratio of average fluorescence intensities for different excitation wavelengths, measured for PSI@SLG/SIF and PSI@SLG.	 

 	Fig. 5  Photochronoamperometric analysis of PSI-based bioelectrodes with (blue line) and without (black line) the SIF layer. Photocurrents have been recorded in 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) under aerobic conditions. Recorded signals were normalized vs. the current axis (n = 2).	 

 	Fig. 6  Comparison of photocurrent densities obtained for two bioelectrodes at different bias voltages. The results measured for the PSI@SLG sample are shown as grey bars, whereas the results for the PSI@SLG/SIF assembly are presented as blue bars. Photocurrents have been recorded in 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) under aerobic conditions. Results taken from two independently prepared electrodes (n = 2).
