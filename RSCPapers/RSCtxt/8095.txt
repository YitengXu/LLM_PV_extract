    , Accepted 20th April 2012First published on 20th April 2012AbstractTime-resolved fluorescence spectra from the RuN719 dye exhibit very short lifetimes (<30 fs) in solutions, on non-injecting substrates and on injecting ones. This reveals <10 fs intramolecular energy redistribution competing with the injection. We conclude that injection proceeds on a sub-10 fs time scale from non-thermalized levels of the dye.
The principle of the dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) is based on the use of metal-based molecular complexes, of which the RuN3 ([Ru(dcbpyH2)2(NCS)2]) dye is the most popular, adsorbed onto a semiconductor substrate (usually TiO2). Upon absorption of visible light by the singlet metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (1MLCT) state of the dye, injection of an electron into the substrate occurs.1 A central issue for the optimization of the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells is the detailed understanding of the mechanism and time scale of electron injection. Much effort has been devoted to this aim in the past 15 years, mainly using nanosecond and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in the visible, near-IR, and mid-IR spectral regions.2–12 Overall these studies concluded that at least part of the photo-induced electron transfer in the RuN3–TiO2 films occurs in <100 fs. This was also one of the reasons to believe that the electron injection may occur from non-thermalized vibrationally excited states prior to internal energy relaxation in the sensitizer. Sundström and co-workers addressed this question in a systematic way by transient absorption spectroscopy of RuN3 on TiO2 in the 400–1100 nm range with a time resolution of ∼30 fs. In particular, at the shortest time delays, which deal with injection from the 1MLCT state, they probed the stimulated emission at 600 nm, observing an instantaneous rise of the signal and a decay with a time constant of ∼30 fs to a level, caused by the overlapping ground state bleach, that remained constant for several picoseconds. This was supported by a measurement of the 3MLCT state formation, which was probed at 1050 nm, a region where its absorption is supposed to be broad and featureless, and therefore insensitive to cooling processes. However, the probed region also contains a non-negligible absorption by the conduction band electrons. By measuring the rise time of the 3MLCT of RuN3 in solution they estimated an intersystem crossing (ISC) of ∼70 fs. From this value and the total relaxation rate of (30 fs)−1, they concluded that the injection occurs at a rate of (50 fs)−1 and that it proceeds from a non-thermalized singlet state. Prior to Sundström et al.'s work, there were several pieces of evidence suggesting that injection competes with intramolecular energy redistribution. For the RuN3-semiconductor system, this came from the excitation wavelength dependence of the photo-induced electron-transfer quantum yield.13 Upon nanosecond excitation, a high quantum yield of electron injection was obtained only when the excitation wavelength was sufficiently short to populate the excited states of RuN3 above the conduction-band edge of the studied semiconductor (Nb2O5, TiO2). Later, higher vibronic states of the sensitizer were found to be involved in electron injection from surface photovoltage spectroscopy studies.14
Ultrafast time-gated fluorescence is ideal to investigate the evolution of excited molecules because it only involves the ground and the initially excited state(s), whereas transient absorption contains several overlapping contributions due to ground state bleach, excited state absorption and stimulated emission. A first study of charge injection dynamics with the femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion technique with monochromatic detection was performed by Rehm et al. on coumarin 343 dye adsorbed on TiO2 nanoparticles at a time resolution of 250 fs.15 Here we present the first study of ruthenium dyes on TiO2 using a broad band detection. Concerning these dyes, Bhasikuttan and Okada reported the first femtosecond fluorescence measurements with monochromatic detection of the RuN3 dye in ethanol with a resolution of 130 fs.16 They deduced an ultrafast decay of the Franck–Condon state of ∼40 fs at 600 nm, which they attributed to intersystem crossing and internal conversion. They also noted a lengthening of the decay time towards longer emission wavelengths. As pointed out by them, the limited data available under such conditions did not allow to get a full picture of the ultrafast relaxation kinetics. We recently reported polychromatic time-resolved fluorescence studies with a time resolution of ∼100 fs that allow recording the entire emission profile of the system at a given time delay after excitation.17–19 We presented results on [Ru(bpy)3]2+,20 RuN719 and RuN3,21 and [Fe(bpy)3]2+,22 in various solvents and for different pump wavelengths, detecting not only their short lived 1MLCT fluorescence but also the 3MLCT phosphorescence of the tris-bpy complexes. For all systems, the decay time of the 1MLCT emission was found to be ≤40 fs, and the 1MLCT fluorescence exhibited already at zero time delay, a band with a mirror-like profile with respect to the absorption band. In the case of RuN719 and RuN3, we also found a somewhat longer component (150–190 fs) on the red side of the fluorescence, which was attributed to lower lying states of the singlet MLCT manifold.
The mirror-like profile with respect to absorption of the t = 0 fluorescence implies intramolecular energy relaxation processes such as internal conversion (IC) in the manifold of 1MLCT states and intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), which we estimated to occur in <10 fs.21 Thus, the singlet MLCT emission bands of Ru-complexes in solution stem from a vibrationally “cold” state as far as the high frequency Franck–Condon modes are concerned. Since the time-zero emission spectra exhibit mirror-image symmetry with respect to the absorption band and show no solvent dependence, we can exclude solvation dynamics as being responsible for this behaviour. Given the evidence for electron injection in DSSCs from non-thermalized states,3,13,14,23 these IC/IVR processes should therefore compete with the electron injection. Here we present the first femtosecond fluorescence studies of the RuN719 dye ((Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2]2−, [dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine]) adsorbed on Al2O3 and TiO2. The choice of RuN719 (the deprotonated derivative of RuN3) was made in order to avoid formation of aggregates on the substrate and to be sure to have only one monolayer of adsorbed molecules.24 Our results deliver a picture in which injection from the 1MLCT state and ultrafast IVR and IC processes compete with each other on a similar sub-10 fs time scale.

Fig. 1 (upper panel) shows the absorption spectra of RuN719 adsorbed on mesoporous TiO2 and Al2O3, along with the spectra of the substrates only. The emission centred around 750 nm stems from the 3MLCT state, as seen in ethanol and acetonitrile.21 The absence of this signal in the case of TiO2 is evidence of an efficient injection from the excited states of the dye. The lower panel shows the resulting time-wavelength plots under 400 nm excitation. The plots are normalized to 1 at the maximum of the fluorescence (∼570 nm).
 Fig. 1  Upper panel shows the steady-state absorption of the RuN719 dye adsorbed on TiO2 (blue line) and on Al2O3 (red dashed line) along with their substrate alone (corresponding light colour). Lower panels: 2D time-wavelength plots of the normalized emission of RuN719 adsorbed on mesoporous TiO2 and Al2O3 under 400 nm excitation. 

Fig. 2 shows the normalized kinetic traces and the time gated spectra of the fluorescence of RuN719 on TiO2, Al2O3 and in water solution (from ref. 21). The time gated spectra show similar behaviour in all three systems (the Raman line of the water solvent is missing for the adsorbed dye). We performed a global analysis of the 2D plots of Fig. 1 and the results are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Just as for the water solvent,21 two components are recovered with comparable time scales, indicating that the kinetic behaviour is identical in solutions and on the two substrates. In particular, the evolution of the kinetic traces as a function of detection wavelength is very similar in all three cases, pointing to the fact that the “cold” fluorescence is basically unaffected by the presence of an injecting substrate such as TiO2. Considering the evidence about injection from non-thermalized states of the dye and given the time resolution of our experiment, it is not surprising that the time profiles are similar in solution, on an injecting substrate and on a non-injecting one. The only criterion that could identify the effect of injection under these circumstances is the intensity of the fluorescence at t = 0 in the different media, since it would affect the population of remaining molecules that emit. Comparing intensities is however impossible due to differences in the number and geometry of adsorbed molecules, and in the absorption and scattering properties of the two substrates.

For a better comparison of the kinetic behaviour, the time traces are normalized to the maximum. Peak at 460 nm in the top panel is a Raman line from water. 
The observations of Fig. 1 and 2 have a direct incidence on the functioning of the DSSCs. The important result here is the invariance of the 1MLCT decay for RuN719 in solution and on TiO2 and Al2O3 substrates. Indeed, this reveals that IVR and IC on the TiO2 substrate occur on the same time scales as in solution and on Al2O3. Since the observed injection in TiO2 has to compete with these ultrafast intramolecular processes, this speaks for an injection time from the initially accessed states closer to 10 fs than to 50 fs, which is the upper limit derived by Sundström and co-workers.23 Although all precautions were taken to avoid aggregates, even if the time profile we measure were due to them, it would reinforce our argument as the molecules in direct contact with the substrate would be completely quenched.
The injection into TiO2 is significantly slowed down when the system is in the cold 1MLCT, as shown by the presence of the 120–190 fs component in all three environments (Fig. S1, ESI†). Furthermore, injection from the 3MLCT state occurs on even longer time scales.24,25 From this we conclude that there is therefore a dramatic drop of injection rate by almost one order of magnitude over ∼0.85 eV corresponding to the energy difference between the initial excitation and the relaxed singlet state. An additional drop of injection rate occurs in the triplet state,24,25 which corresponds to a further decrease in energy by ∼0.65 eV, if we refer to the case of RuN719. Along with the dye electronic and molecular structure and the way it is adsorbed onto the substrate, which determine the electronic coupling,26 a key parameter that influences the injection efficiency is the energy of the excited state(s) of the dye relative to the bottom of the conduction band of the TiO2 substrate. This formally determines the driving force for the excited state electron injection into the manifold of the unoccupied states of the substrate.
Several theoretical studies have been reported aimed at rationalising the electron injection mechanism and its time scale, mostly focussing on organic dyes adsorbed on TiO2.26–30 Recent DFT/TDDFT studies of RuN719 on TiO227,31 reported the density of states (DOS) of the bare and loaded substrate. They predict an ultrafast, instantaneous electron injection component on the basis of the strong coupling and of the matching of the visible absorption spectrum and density of TiO2 unoccupied states. Quite surprisingly, the absorption profile of the adsorbed dye is almost identical to that in solution, even though the picture is that underlying excited states have a drastically different nature. As a consequence, this work concluded that there is no lower limit to the injection time except the electron dephasing times in the semiconductor, which are typically <10 fs. These calculations should however be mitigated by the fact that they concern mainly one state (S18) of the MLCT manifold, and that they do not consider structural changes upon excitation of the MLCT states.32 It is very likely that the other states of the manifold will be differently coupled to the substrate.
Our results introduce IC and IVR as intramolecular processes that compete with the injection. Since IC and IVR occur on a sub-10 fs time scale, this implies that the injection from non-thermalized levels should therefore also occur on a <10 fs time scale. The delocalised nature of adsorbate/substrate excited state from the DFT/TDDFT studies27,31 would however imply an injection on an attosecond time scale. As already mentioned, these studies concern only the S18 state which represents the most extreme case, while the other states of the 1MLCT manifold must be more weakly coupled to the substrate than the former, but still strong enough to ensure a sub-10 fs injection time. The latter is in agreement with experimental results obtained using different dyes and techniques: (a) Huber et al. investigated alizarin adsorbed on TiO2 and ZrO2 colloidal nanoparticles, using transient absorption spectroscopy with 20 fs time resolution. A very fast electron injection was found to occur from the photo-excited dye within 6 fs into the conduction band of TiO2, which was not observed for the non-injecting alizarin/ZrO2 system;33 (b) Schnadt et al.34 identified electron injection from RuN3 adsorbed onto TiO2 by comparing the resonant photoemission (RPE) spectrum with the X-ray absorption spectrum at the K-edge of nitrogen. Deviations appeared between them as a disappearance of the LUMO + 1 and LUMO + 2 bands in the RPE spectrum, while no such effect was observed on the LUMO band, the latter lies below the conduction band of TiO2 while the former lies within it. In the presence of the core hole an electron residing in the LUMO can therefore not be transferred into the substrate, while for an electron in the LUMO + 1 and LUMO + 2 a transfer is energetically feasible. Based on the N K-edge core hole lifetime, the authors estimated the time scale for electron injection into the substrate to be <3 fs.
The one order of magnitude drop in injection rate from the initially excited levels to the 1MLCT lowest emitting level that is inferred from our measurements can qualitatively be accounted for by the DOS of RuN719 on TiO2 reported by De Angelis et al.27,31 The further drop as the system ends up in the 3MLCT state is not reflected in the DOS and is probably due to the adsorption geometry and/or the spin of the excited state.
Conclusions
Our conclusions are summarized in Fig. 3. The initially excited levels undergo competing electron injection and IC/IVR processes on similar <10 fs time scales. Once the system has reached the emitting 1MLCT state, the injection rate drops by more than an order of magnitude, as witnessed by the presence of a >150 fs fluorescence component. In the 3MLCT state, the injection time further extends to several picoseconds. If the first two steps can be accounted for by the energy variation of the DOS, the last drop is due to factors such as adsorption geometry and nature of the electronic state. These observations are of importance for optimising the performance of DSSCs.

Materials and methods
The set-up is described in detail in ref. 17–19. Briefly, the sample was excited by 400 nm pulses with typical width 60 fs, power 80 nJ per pulse, focal spot 30 μm FWHM, and at a repetition rate of 250 kHz. The emission, collected in forward-scattering geometry, was up-converted in a 250 mm thick -barium borate (BBO) crystal by mixing it with a gate pulse at 800 nm. The up-converted signal was detected with a spectrograph equipped with liquid-N2-cooled CCD camera in polychromatic mode. The detectable spectral range was limited to the 450–690 nm region. The time resolution of the setup is ∼100 fs, as measured by the FWHM of a kinetic trace of the Raman line of H2O. Typical data acquisition times were approx. half an hour per scan, no significant intensity variations of the signals were observed from scan to scan, and the laser flux was verified before and after each measurement.
The RuN719 ((Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2]2−) dye was synthesized according to ref. 35. It was then adsorbed onto anatase nanocrystalline titanium dioxide and aluminium oxide films by soaking them into 0.05 mM RuN719 solutions in ethanol for a suitable time to have the same dye cover (0.3 OD at 400 nm) on both substrates (∼12 h).1 The adsorbed dye molecules were then covered with a film of the redox inactive ionic liquid (1-ethyl-2-methylimidazoliumbis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl)imide).36 To minimize photo-damage, the solid samples were mounted on a spinning cell coupled with a horizontal motorized translation stage.
