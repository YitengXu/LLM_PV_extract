    , Accepted 25th January 2021First published on 30th January 2021AbstractWe attempted to describe a set of flavylium derivative molecules through quantum density functional methods, which may lead to a better understanding of the physicochemical properties of these organic systems. Consequently, such empirical and hypothetical flavylium compounds have a suitable route to obtain their molecular structures. The role of optical transitions in the benzopyrylium derivatives is understood as an electronic communication between the benzopyrylium (A,B-ring) and substituent (C-ring) moieties, and the obtained results are promising for the novel design of new solar cells based on their optical properties. In this framework, optical properties were analyzed in their ground and excited states using time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) methodologies. In this sense, the wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) red shift that is observed could contribute towards enhanced applications. Furthermore, the emission pathway obtained was in agreement with the experimental results. Our results provide interesting insights for new experimental assemblies of heterocyclic flavylium compounds and their performance could contribute to optimized dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Furthermore, the main bonding characteristics involved in the formation of these interesting compounds were investigated by taking advantage of the energy decomposition analysis-natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV), thus enabling the elucidation of the energy components and their chemical nature through a detailed bonding picture.
Introduction
Flavylium derivatives represent a widespread kind of compound including anthocyanidins, anthocyanins, and chalcones among others, which are frequently characterized by a marked absorption band in the UV-vis region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These derivatives represent an attractive focus of research due to their particular electronic properties, which can be widely described through analysis of their electronic structure. In this framework, well-known anthocyanidins and anthocyanins are found as the main pigments in flowers, fruits, and vegetables1–4 and are responsible for their intense colors. Some benzopyrylium(flavylium) salts5,6 exhibit a strong luminescent response,7 which is of the utmost importance for designing optical devices with potential applications as molecular sensors8,9 and pH-based photochromism10–13 and as a result the acid-induced chalcone-flavylium species is labeled as a molecular switch.14,15 Besides this, due to the presence of chelating groups, flavylium derivatives16,17 have been used in host–guest chemistry to obtain tunable properties7,18,19 and in the co-pigmentation3 process for food chemistry where the interaction charge transfer to the pyrylium moiety performs a fundamental role. Additionally, flavylium compounds have been involved in biological issues.19,20
In this sense, benzopyrylium salt derivatives incorporate a continuous scope in significant fields such as food chemistry21,22 and renewable energies, rendering them the focus of much research. Thus, the anthocyanins are considered as a relevant subgroup of flavonoids and are among the most used natural colorants in the food industry,4,22–25 as well as having been studied as sensitizers in dye sensitized solar cell (DSSCs)26–29 with promising results. Even though benzopyrylium compounds are broadly found in nature, the experimental synthesis and theoretical modeling of new flavylium salt derivatives allow us to modulate their properties, generating interesting knowledge in the respective area. Therefore, a smart strategy for obtaining these compounds is carried out by a ring closure reaction via intramolecular acid condensation, coupled with a photoisomerization reaction30 from a chalcone species towards the formation of an organic benzopyrylium salt. Most of the time, these reactions are performed by inexpensive methods and with a large number of available precursors, which is favorable for designing new flavylium compounds, enhancing the range of their applications.31,32
Previous surveys show that the spectroscopic properties of these chromophores depend mainly on their characteristic and chemical structures. Thus, the functionalization in the corresponding backbone (BA–C rings, see Fig. S1, ESI‡) includes suitable substituents that do not generate interference in the delocalization of the π electron cloud, which can lead to modulation of the absorption and emission pathway in such benzopyrylium derivatives. Thereby, the modeling and design of the reported and new hypothetical flavylium compounds becomes a useful tool in order to obtain the desired optical response. Therefore, the inclusion of luminescent precursors to obtain flavylium compounds ensures a simple strategy towards radiative chromophores. Thereby, theoretical calculations incorporate a deep insight into the photophysical properties of these derivatives, providing a better understanding of their electronic properties.
Herein, we carried out a theoretical assessment for a set of benzopyrylium ion derivatives, which include emissive precursors (Fig. 1) that can be assembled for a classical aldol reaction route (see Scheme S1, ESI‡) and are labeled hereafter as 1a, 2a, and 3a, and 1b, 2b, and 3b molecules (Fig. 2). The structure of the flavylium derivatives was selected with the aim of analyzing the effect of replacing the homocycle with a heterocycle and with a delocalized group.

 Fig. 2  Ground state structures of flavylium derivatives labeled as 1a, 2a, and 3a and 1b, 2b, and 3b in the series. 
In this framework, to obtain the electronic structure of this whole set of molecules, we carried out quantum chemical calculations. Thus, we propose a theoretical methodology to evaluate both the electronic and optical properties of current flavylium derivatives within the density functional theory (DFT). In this sense, DFT methods offer a suitable performance in the computation of organic molecules. Finally, TDDFT methods are employed to properly study the emission and absorption spectra of these compounds. Such results converge in tandem towards optimized DSSCs. The current study is carried out to predict and study the electronic structure of a set of flavylium derivative chromophores, surveying their electronic structure and determining their potential inclusion in solar cell technology.
Computational details
Density functional theory33 calculations were carried out by using ADF 2017.02 code,34 incorporating scalar corrections via the ZORA Hamiltonian.35–37 Slater-type triple-ζ plus polarization basis set38 (STO-TZP) were employed together with the B3LYP hybrid functional.39 The B3LYP functional uses the Becke's three parameter exchange functional (B3)40 together with the correlation function provided by Lee Yang Parr (LYP)41 and the local correlation functional of Vosko Wilk Nusair (VWN).42
The ground state equilibrium geometries were undertaken without any symmetry restraints via the analytical energy gradient method implemented by Versluis and Ziegler,43 where the energy minima for the optimized geometries were confirmed by calculation of the vibrational frequencies. The energy decomposition analyses (EDA) were carried out according to the Ziegler–Rauk scheme.44–46 Hence, we performed an energy decomposition analysis within an extended transition state in combination with the natural orbitals for the chemical valence ETS-NOCV scheme.47–51 The excitation energies were estimated by the scalar time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)52–54 including the CAM-B3LYP functional.55 The excited state geometry of the compounds was determined using the B3LYP/TZP methods. It was possible to model the emission band at the TDDFT level.56 The first step in our computations was the optimization of the singlet excited state. Thus, for such geometry we performed a TDDFT calculation toward the emission spectra, this type of calculation can be associated with the molecular emission of one molecule57 and has also been employed to describe optical properties of clusters.58–60 Most insight about emission properties is obtained by using the ZORA Hamiltonian, which incorporates the electric dipole radiative lifetime (τ) constants. Solvation effects were modeled by a conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO).61
The NEGF62,63 approach was employed to obtain the transmission function τ(ε) of molecular junction arrays by means of the BAND quantum chemistry package.62
Results
The structural energy minima for the studied molecules are shown in Fig. 2. These structures were obtained at the B3LYP/TZP level. The structural parameters of flavylium compounds 1a to 3b exhibit a quasi-planar structure in the backbone and may have a successful response similar to those that we have studied previously64 (Table S1, ESI‡). The experimental parameters5 were collected and compared with the calculated structures and are in good agreement, indicating that DFT as the theoretical level provides a reliable route for the modeling of the ground and excited states of such organic species. At the same time, their energy values converge to show enhanced results at the B3LYP/TZP level, labeled as a recurrent method in the organic arrays.
In this sense, for 1a, 2a, and 3a, the bonding distance between the benzopyrylium (A,B-rings (Fig. S1, ESI‡)) and the substituent moiety (C-ring) is around 1.46 Å, while for their 1b, 2b, and 3b counterparts, the distances are approximately 1.43 Å, suggesting that such bonds have pseudo π-character, taking into account that the single bond length distance of [–C–C–] is generally 1.54 Å, thus, π-conjugation can be found between such bond and A or C-ring. Furthermore, the dihedral angles in the a-series ϕ[O–C–C–C] are approximately 13°, whereas in the case of the b-series, the ϕ[S–C–C–C] angles are about 1.0°, which accounts for shortening in such distances for the planar flavylium structures found in the b-series (see Fig. 2) in slight contrast with the quasi-planar structure in the a-series. Moreover, the distance [–C1–C12–] (Fig. S1, ESI‡), which corresponds to the carbons that connect the benzopyrylium part (B,A-rings) with each corresponding C-ring group, is modified concomitant with the dihedral angle observed in the flavylium compounds.
Spectroscopic properties
The calculated data of compound 2a are compatible with the experimental absorption spectra of the compound. All data results are collected in Table 1. The experimental absorption spectra14 of the cycled 2a species was obtained in a methanol–water solution with a maximum absorption peak at 531 nm, whereas the calculated value was 520 nm, such a situation indicates an excellent performance for the level of theory employed. The absorption spectra of the a- and b-series are shown in the Fig. 3. These compounds generally follow a photochromic chalcone–flavylium equilibrium path.13 However, the radiative decay is attributed to the flavylium species.7,14 Then, the obtaining of the carboxylic flavylium derivative was carried out as an acid-photoinduced reaction where the protonated species are pH-dependent solutions in order to gain higher relevance. Our calculations were carried out modelling the protonated species, thus avoiding the case of the zwitterionic flavylium species. The UV-vis absorption spectra include the long-range correction CAM-B3LYP functional for gas and solvated molecules and such results were contrasted with the B3LYP functional displaying minor deviations from experimental results as in a previous report,64 where the solvated molecules in the cationic species generally depict a better match with the experimental reports,7,14,64 consequently, the solvated calculated absorption transitions in the a-series are located at 540, 520, and 440 nm, going from 1a to 3a as well as the maximum absorption band for 1b to 3b, which are located at 535, 526 and 455 nm for the solvated ones (see Table 1 and Fig. 3).

Those results have small differences between the a-series and the b-series measurements (when the benzopyrylium moiety is connected to a benzyl or thienyl group, respectively). On the other hand, in the comparison between the solvated method and the gas phase in the TDDFT results, some significant deviations can be found for the current compounds. Thus, the inclusion of the solvated level obtains a better performance for the experimental data in the literature. An example of this is that the 2a compound shows an empirical absorption band located at 531 nm,14 whereas our calculated value is 521 nm. (see Table 1). This observed situation supports the fact that the solvated species stabilize the cationic flavylium derivatives in an improved way when compared with the gas-phase,64 which is in agreement with experimental evidence.
The whole flavylium studied herein exhibits a UV-vis absorption band that involves solely HOMO–LUMO transitions. Furthermore, the respective analysis of the molecular orbitals (Mos) belonging to such transitions mainly displays a π → π* character. Thus, in compounds 1(a,b) and 2(a,b), the promoted electron goes from a π-bonding highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) delocalized mainly between the benzopyrylium (B,A-rings) moiety (see Fig. 4 and Fig. S4, ESI‡), including the amine substituents on the B-ring, toward a π*-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) that is delocalized mainly in the A–C-rings. This situation reflects clearly that the electron promotion is delocalized from the B to C-ring whose bridge or the intramolecular transfer channel is the pyrylium A-ring. In this sense, it could be observed that there is electronic communication between the B-ring and C-ring supported by the A-ring bridge in compounds 1(a,b) and 2(a,b). Thus, such electronic transitions are delocalized in the flavylium backbone. In the compounds 3(a,b), there is a similar situation that leads us to conclude that such a transition band is delocalized along the π-orbitals of the flavylium backbone [A,B,C]-rings, without involving the phenyl substituents. Such observations suggest that the carboxyl substituent can act as the dye donor group of the dye for potential inclusion in DSSCs solar cells. Throughout the a and b-series the benzopyrylium derivatives have a π–π* transition that exhibits an interesting bathochromic shift from 3(a,b) toward the 1(a,b), 2(a,b) derivatives, reaching a larger red-shift in 1(a,b) whose corresponding transitions are observed at 540 and 535 nm, obtained through our theoretical results. Fig. 4 shows the molecular orbitals involved in such transitions, a hypochromic shift is observed for 3(a,b), which can be related mainly to the stabilization (Table 1) of the HOMO–LUMO that occurs to the most energetic λmax with a higher energy-gap value and the charge is delocalized in the π-orbitals (Fig. 4 and Fig. S4, ESI‡) of the flavylium backbone, where the substituent functionalization does not reach remarkable relevance. This is in contrast with 1(a,b) and 2(a,b) where the functionalization of flavylium promotes a clear red shift. Thereby, the absorption spectrum for these molecules exhibits a variation of the optical properties that covers a broad visible region, according to the inclusion of functional substituent groups, resulting in an improvement to their performance in suitable applications.

Emission properties
The purpose of the current work is to survey some previously obtained flavylium derivatives and a new hypothetical design of flavylium derivatives with enhanced properties by including precursors that bring out an emissive behavior that modulates such properties. Therefore, the 2a compound exhibits an emission band at 631 nm,7,14 whose emission pathway was modeled using TDDFT calculations. Thus, the calculated emission spectra (Fig. 5) show a singlet signal located at 669 nm in water solution, which is in good agreement with the observed experimental value measured in polar water solution. Thereby, whereas 1(a,b) and 2(a,b) show a higher oscillator strength, 3(a,b) (Table 2) show an emission band with lower oscillator strength values, which indicates a higher probability of radiative behavior in the 1,2-series.

Moreover, such calculated potential emissions exhibit an electric dipole radiative lifetime (τ) calculated at the spin–orbit level, containing values between 10 × 10−7 s to 10 × 10−8 s (Table 2), suggesting a decay time lying in the fluorescent region. This radiative behavior could be supported with the inclusion of amine and thiophene64 groups, which generate a rigid planar excited geometry whose delocalized orbitals are found in the benzopyrylium backbone. Additionally, the effect of the dynamics of the electron injection mechanisms depicts a crucial finding in the solar cell field. This analysis reveals that the injection process can be observed by the transient absorption spectrum of the oxidized dye that decays just before the transition of free electrons in the conduction band and the absorption signal of the oxidized dye generally shows considerable overlap with the emission band of the dye. Hence, the characteristics of the emission band can indicate the rate of electron injection. Thus, the injection process onset from the relaxed excited state of the dye is considered. Such energy values directly affect the free energy change injection (ΔGinject).65
Dye-sensitized solar cells
Here we relate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the dye sensitizer molecule with the iodine/iodide redox potential and the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 semiconductor (see Fig. 6) that accounts for a crystalline cluster system. Thus, the corresponding FMOs of the flavylium are of remarkable interest since they are involved in the electronic transitions, as was shown in the spectroscopic properties section. In this regard, the reduction potential of the conduction band should have a more negative energy level than the LUMO of the dye to provide the driving force for the charge transfer to occur. Koopmans’ theorem estimates that the vertical reduction energy in the ground state of the dye is the LUMO level. Such a situation suggests that whole flavylium derivatives should be able to transfer or inject electrons on the conduction band of the cell. Otherwise, the dye regeneration is determined by the potential difference among the dye and redox couple (I−/I3−),66 the oxidation potential of the dye is the HOMO energy in the ground state and must have a more positive value (or more negative energy than the redox couple (see Fig. 6) than the auxiliary electrode or redox couple, in this case it is 4.6 eV for I−/I3−, ensuring enough driving force toward dye regeneration and enabling a fast and efficient process. From Fig. 6 and Table 3 we can observe that all flavylium molecules have HOMO levels that are more stable than the I−/I3− couple, which ensures enough driving force for electronic dye regeneration. Further, the conduction band edge of the TiO2 semiconductor is strongly related to the dye energy gap (HOMO–LUMO), this amount enables the exploration of electron-injection efficiency on the cell. Therefore, dyes that exhibit a smaller energy gap can more easily support photoinduced electronic excitation and increase the probability of an efficient electron injection in the conduction band. Fig. 6 exhibits the energy gap of the current molecules denoting that 3(a,b) depicts the highest quantities in the whole series, suggesting minor activity. Additionally, the HOMO–LUMO levels are implicated in the UV-vis transitions of the current compounds, hence, when observing these corresponding orbital isosurfaces (Fig. 4, and Fig. S4, ESI‡), it is straightforward to notice that in the 1(a,b) and 2(a,b) compounds the photoinduced charge excitation going from the BA-ring moiety to the C-ring moiety, which allows dye–TiO2 charge transfer to occur from the –COOH anchor group in the C-ring. Instead in 3(a,b) the HOMO charge density is delocalized in the BA–C rings, such electronic density is stabilized by charge conjugation at a most stable level. Additionally, the τ decay is in the order of 10 × 10−7 s contrasting with 10 × 10−8 s in the other dyes. Consequently, the energy of the LUMO in the dye should remain above (more positive energy) the lower limit of the TiO2 conduction band. The regeneration of the oxidized dye occurs with higher efficiency if the HOMO energy of the dye stays below (more negative energy) the redox potential of the redox mediator agent (I−/I3−) in a suitable environment, which is regenerated by a metallic catalyst (commonly Pt) at the counter-electrode, closing the circuit66 (see Fig. 6).

In this framework, theoretical parameters with the experimental controls such as open-circuit (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc) can be calculated.67–71 The photo-induced electron injection in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is viewed as a charge transfer related to the free energy change for the electron injection (ΔGinject) process.72,73 ΔGinject is related to the electron injection driving force. Generally, negative values of ΔGinject are obtained, the electron-injection depicts a spontaneous process and is calculated as ΔGinject = Edye* − ECB.74 The Edye* is the excited-state oxidation potential for the dye, which is associated with the redox potential of the ground state of the dye (Edye) and the vertical transition energy (λmax) in concordance with the equation: Edye* = Edye − λmax. Hence, the calculated Edye* and ΔGinject of the absorption bands of the flavylium dyes are shown in Table 3. The results display ΔGinject negative quantities on 1(a,b) and 2b, whereas 2a presents a close to zero value (0.04 eV) indicating a favorable electron injection in these compounds for the solvated phase and consequently a larger driving force to promote a fast injection rate, enhancing the overall efficiency. Thereby, it contributes to obtaining a greater short-circuit current density Jsc with higher power conversion.75 On the other hand, 3(a,b) shows positive values with a more difficult pathway towards rapid electron injection. Many works have reported electron transfer dynamics considering different anchor groups including the carboxylate anchor. The modeling of interfacial bonding between the crystal layer of the semiconductor and the corresponding dye allows quantification of electron transfer. The adsorbed dye presents a bidentate binding mode for the carboxylate oxygens in a more stable configuration, the interfacial electron transfer on the carboxylate anchor in a given dye/TiO2 system is made through a quantum dynamics procedure that delivers the survival probability of the photoexcited electron on the dye, such findings lead to evaluation of the electron injection efficiency, and the carboxylate anchor show a good performance since most of the electron charge occurs from the adsorbate LUMO into the TiO2 conduction band within the 100 fs time scale.76–78
The efficiency of the solar cell comprises the photophysical properties of the semiconductor, the nature of the dye, and the electrolyte regenerator, hence, we studied the flavylium dye properties in order to introduce them as sensitizers for the building of novel solar cells.
Therefore, the overall efficiency of the DSSCs is the dye behavior in response to incident light, which is obtained through theoretical analysis relating the oscillator strength (f) with its maximum wavelength (λmax) as light harvesting efficiency (LHE), expressed asLHE = λ−10−A = λ−10−fwhere A(f) is the absorption (or oscillator strength) of a dye linked to their λmax. These results are readily obtained from TDDFT computations, the values of the LHE accounts for a fraction of light intensity absorbed by the dyes. Hence, obtaining a larger value (Table 3) enables us to maximize the photocurrent efficiency. The set of flavylium dyes discussed herein displays LHE values within a favorable narrow range of 0.811–0.902 in solvated molecules, these amounts increase from 1(a,b) to 3(a,b) and this fact is related to the fact that in 3(a,b) the transition is delocalized in the BA–C-rings showing a more energetic value. 3(a,b) could generate a greater photoinduced transition probability since the H–L gap is highest79 in these compounds, however, they show worse results when comparing them with other molecules. Besides, the ΔGinject has a positive value for 3(a,b), whereas for 1(a,b) and 2b, the values are −0.081, −0.200 and 0.053 eV showing a more negative value in 1b, which suggests there is enough driving force for a higher electron-injection efficiency from the excited state to the TiO2 surface and therefore a better photocurrent response.
Transmission properties
Lastly, the current organic molecules comprise a nanojunction system where two TiO2 layers are connected with a flavylium one, such a junction is depicted in Fig. 7, showing the molecule–electrode junction. This array comprises a finite molecular conductor and two semi-infinite electrodes or leads, the junction is considered to be a remaining part of the electrodes joined (reservoirs) to an organic flavylium bridge. When the equilibrium system reaches an overall Fermi level defined in the nanojunction, then, the energy states underneath the Fermi level stay occupied and the above ones remain empty. Thus, the isolated organic species in contact with the electrodes add finite lifetime charge carriers, which can be described by transport calculations. Taking advantage of accurate approaches based on the scattering theory63 for the description of the charge transport of the molecular nano junctions are employed. In this context, diverse theoretical approaches have been developed for the study of the charge transport issue. Here, the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) is applied.62 This formalism is based on the single-particle Hamiltonian, the electronic structure of which in the nanojunction model can be obtained by density functional theory (DFT) methods to describe the transmission function that is directly related to the conductance of the nano-molecular array.
 Fig. 7  The molecular nano-junction on the TiO2–flavylium system. 
The corresponding transmission functions were computed to contrast the probability of transmission with the result of electron injection in the former solar cell section, these functions are represented in Fig. 8 and Fig. S5–S7 (ESI‡). The Fermi level is in the 0.0 eV value in the spectra finding resonance peaks with transmission values in the 0–1 range, which are associated with a resonant electron transport probability through discrete energy levels, obtained when the molecular and electrode Green's operators are projected onto the molecular subspace. Allowing the occupation of a set of discrete orthonormal bases that span the molecular-leads range, this discrete set can be interpreted as transmission orbitals in the scattering region with a certain probability of being transmitted and are denoted as charge or electron carriers. The carrier orbital can be delocalized in the organic bridge as well as a coupling in the lead-bridge space. Thereby, the resonance peaks close to the Fermi level depict transmission channels with certain coupling lead-bridge. In this sense, the molecules 1a and 2a (Fig. 8) show close Fermi peaks that are coupled for the interaction of the π-conjugate orbitals of the organic bridge with the orbitals of the semi-infinite TiO2 leads. Further, by comparing the transmission resonance peaks of the whole organic set, the higher transmission probability lies in the 1a bridge, which is in concordance to the negative close to zero value of the ΔGinjection quantity (Table 3). Such a situation accounts for the higher capacity of electron transport in molecules of a planar structure whose π-clouds are in better coplanarity for all molecular space, in contrast with 3(a,b). In general, the π-structure in combination with their particular optical properties facilitates the electronic communication between the flavylium–TiO2 array and makes them a promising material in the solar-cell field.

Bonding analysis
Consequently, the nature of the π-orbitals connecting the A-ring with the C-ring can be observed from an EDA-NOCV scheme, the electronic communication among the BA–C moieties is viewed from the electronic transitions. In this context, the excited state geometries in the flavylium derivatives do not display significant differences in such a series. However, in the a-series the dihedral angle connecting the BA–C rings evolves from ∼13° to ∼1.0°, denoting the excited structure as more structurally rigid, shortening the [–C–C–] distances and favoring a more likely radiative decay accounting for the corresponding transitions involved in those molecular fragments. Accordingly, bonding analysis is carried out to elucidate the σ- and π-electronic density contribution of the bond that links the A–C rings. Thus, we performed an energy decomposition analysis within an ETS-NOCV scheme,47–51 which serves as the main strategy for the understanding of the chemical bond from the natural orbitals (NOCVs). Such a situation implies the formation of a molecule AB (with wave function ΨAB) from adequate fragments. Thus, the energy interaction (Eint) is decomposed into chemically meaningful terms in order to:ΔEint = ΔEelstat + ΔEPauli + ΔEorb + ΔEdisThen, the ΔEelstat term accounts for a change in the electrostatic energy when the distorted fragments are combined and remain in their final positions of the structure, the ΔEPauli term accounts for the normalization and antisymmetric wave function ΨAB. The corresponding sum of the electrostatic and the Pauli terms is denoted as steric energy ΔEsteric = ΔEelstat + ΔEPauli,.44,45 The energy increase is supported by electrostatic factors. Lastly, the ΔEorb term is depicted when the densities of the fragments are located in the final ΨAB molecular orbitals. This term involves the interactions that occur between occupied molecular orbitals with unoccupied molecular orbitals in the fragments as well as the corresponding mix of virtual and occupied orbitals of the same fragment charge rearrangements). This term supports the leading chemical bond components.
Next, the energy decomposition analysis through the ETS-NOCV approach accounts for the pathway picture in the assembly of the [–C–C–] bond linking two fundamental parts of the flavylium structure such as the BA–C rings, besides those bonds are involved in the main reaction to obtain the current flavylium molecules. This descriptor helps us to get more insight into the charge transfer energy for such bonds, allowing us to be aware of their strength as well as their chemical type. Therefore, in Fig. 9 the main terms resulting in the BA–C bond formation are given. The results of Table 4 indicate that the character of the overall interaction ΔEint is attractive or stabilizing and generates the arising of the components formerly described in the total energy equation. The destabilizing Pauli term (Table 4), which is physically depicted by an increment of the kinetic energy of the valence electrons due to interactions among the electron clouds of both fragments is a slightly higher value in the b-series in accordance with the minor bond distances observed. This demonstrates that this repulsive quantity increases as the bond becomes shorter. As ΔEelstat and ΔEPauli show quantities with opposite signs, their sum, namely ΔEsteric, (Table 4) is a better chemical interpretation.80 Then, the steric interactions in compounds 1b, 2b and 3b denote higher values that decrease the bond distance. The energy interaction that arises between the occupied orbitals of the fragment and unoccupied orbitals of the other fragment and the unoccupied and occupied orbitals in the same fragment, lead to an energy interaction that is represented by the ΔEorb term (Table 4). This term was obtained from homolytic (unrestricted) fragments and serves to clarify the specific character of the bond involved from a bonding picture representation and contributes noticeably to the overall attractive components (electrostatic, orbital and dispersion ones). The orbital interaction for the [–C–C–] bond is obtained from the NOCVs scheme as the eigenvectors that diagonalize the deformation density Δρ = ρ − ρ0, providing energy change and a schematic representation of their charge transfer channels. The leading advantage of this strategy lies in the fact that ΔEkorb can be decomposed into only a few complementary pair orbitals, Δρk, which contributes to a greater rate of the bond formation for suitable chemical understanding (see Fig. 9)

Table 5 describes the leading orbital energy interaction that brings out most of the information about the charge transfer for the fragments, as well as a bonding scheme (Fig. 9) whose values denote the charge transfer pathway, which is depicted as the charge outflow that goes from the red to blue orbital-phase. From this orbital representation is labeled the σ and π contributions to the flavylium bond assembly. Table 5 collects the total orbital energy change values for these compounds, showing increasing energy going from a- to b-series. Such variation is because the dihedral angle is minor in the b-series, which enables a more geometrical relaxation for the p-orbital interaction contribution (Table 5). Consequently, these quantities amount to 1a −661.07, 2a −666.79, 3a −672.55, 1b −681.54, 2b −689.98, and 3b −698.20 kcal mol−1, the higher observed values indicate that the bond is supported mainly by the orbital interactions. In Table 5, the elucidation of the σ- and π-contributions is collected, for the flavylium bond formation, the σ-contributions depict similar values in both the (a,b)-series. The key factor lies in the π-contributions that describe a pseudo aromatic bond, whose overall values are 1a −145.75, 2a −146.64, 3a −145.52, 1b −150.73, 2b −153.03, and 3b −150.68 kcal mol−1. The π-contributions bear more stabilizing interactions in the b-series for geometrical issues. Indeed, in Fig. 9 we can see that the electronic density goes from the red orbital on the C-ring towards the blue π-orbitals, in addition, the b-series have lone-pairs in the C-ring or thienyl group in comparison to the benzyl group on the a-series to bear these incoming π-interactions.

Conclusions
In summary, novel flavylium derivatives were studied through several theoretical approaches using DFT calculations to understand the bond formation in the corresponding reaction, their electronic structure, their optical transitions, and their performance as free-metal dye photosensitizers for optimized DSSCs applications. Thereby, a rational understanding of the electronic structure attempts to correlate the main parameters offering significant information about the physical properties of these interesting experimental and hypothetical compounds. At first, the EDA-NOCV determines the contributions involved in the bond formation of such benzopyrylium derivatives, stable structures are found for the reported and theoretically proposed derivatives. The [–C–C–] bond in the BA–C-rings is formally a single one, however, this is the bridge bearing the intramolecular electronic communication between the BA and C rings and therefore displays a significant π-character that is slightly larger in the b-series, where most small dihedral angles are found, which lead to co-planar structures with long range π → π* transitions.
Consequently, the UV-Vis spectra are supported by TD-DFT calculations, showing accurate results when a comparison with the experimental data is made. Thus, the solvated method gave rise to more accurate results in the flavylium cation derivatives since this path leads to stable energy levels and hence towards a more realistic situation. Further, it can be observed that 1(a,b) and 2(a,b) depict a higher bathochromic behavior in comparison with 3(a,b) compounds. This fact is explained through the observation of HOMO energy levels with more negative or stable values because their electrons are excited with a minor λmax or a more energetic route in 3(a,b) compounds. The leading electronic transitions of the whole molecules are associated with a π → π* HOMO → LUMO promotion, indicating good splitting of the frontier orbitals and resulting in an accurate response. Additionally, the emission pathway for all the molecules was successfully modeled. The difference between the ground and excited geometries accounts for the small deviations, where the excited states show ring co-planarity with a bridge [–C–C–] rigid bond, which could have a minor possibility of vibrational decay in 1(a,b) and 2(a,b), whereas the larger and flexible structures in 3(a,b) have a greater probability of vibrational decay with shorter τ-values. Consequently, the flavylium salts were investigated as photosensitizer dyes for DSSCs cells and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the overall a,b-set show a suitable energy gap, which would make it possible for them to be part of a solar cell device as potential free-metal dyes. Consequently, in this set of studied molecules, the electronic promotion generates a LUMO with delocalized electronic density close to the carboxyl donor moiety (the anchored group), which enables electron injection into the TiO2 surface, the ΔGinject exhibits values according to such purpose, complemented by a favorable dye regeneration. Thus, our results are expected to provide relevant insight into metal-free organic dyes in terms of their molecular design, taking advantage of other experimental results, for their useful performance towards optimized DSSCs.
