    , Accepted 20th May 2021First published on 20th May 2021AbstractDeveloping practical water-splitting devices that convert earth-abundant solar energy and water into renewable fuel holds promise for a sustainable energy future; however, its successful commercialization for practical applications is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we developed a high-efficiency and low-cost three-dimensional (3D) OER electrode via electrochemical integration of amorphous NiFeOOH on surface activated carbon fiber paper (CFP). The as-synthesized 3D-a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode exhibits an ultra-low overpotential η(O2) of 170 mV to afford 10 mA cm−2 current density, together with a Tafel slope of 39 mV per decade, and excellent stability under OER conditions. Apart from the synergistic effect, the excellent OER activity of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP is attributed to the unique 3D structure with enriched active sites and the improved electrical conductivity that facilitates the fast OER kinetics and mass transport properties. As a result, the catalyst achieves a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.99 s−1 and mass activity (jm) of 2527 A g−1 at η(O2) 270 mV, which outperforms so far reported state-of-the-art OER catalysts and commercial IrO2. Besides, an alkaline anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer fabricated with the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP anode delivers 1 A current at 1.88 V with a long-term durability of 240 h. These findings highlight the design of high-efficiency OER catalysts and significant advancements towards the utilization of NiFeOOH catalysts for commercial applications.
1. Introduction
Oxygen electrochemistry plays a critical role in the development of renewable energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water splitting, fuel cells, electrochemical CO2 reduction, and rechargeable metal–air batteries.1–4 In particular, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a sluggish and energy-intensive multi-step electron transfer reaction that demands a minimum thermodynamic potential of 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), limits industrial applications of these systems. Therefore, tremendous research efforts are being made to explore highly efficient, durable, and earth-abundant electrocatalysts that perform the OER at appreciable rates.5,6 To date, precious metal oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2 are considered as the benchmark catalysts for the OER since they meet the technological requirements. However, their scarcity and low pH confined OER activities impede their preference for practical applications.6–8 In this regard, earth-abundant first-row transition metal-based catalysts, especially transition metal oxides and (oxy)hydroxides are emerging as outstanding alternatives due to their high activity and stability;9,10 however, typically, they require high pH (∼14) to compete with the OER performance of IrO2.6,11,12
Among non-precious metal oxides, nickel (Ni)-based materials, mainly, nickel–iron (NiFe) (oxy)hydroxides are extensively investigated because of their high intrinsic (per metal cation) OER activity.13–15 Interestingly, they exhibit remarkable stability at a wide range of pH values under alkaline and neutral pH conditions.16 The change in the intrinsic electronic structure of NiFe in the combined state (synergetic effect) and favorable bonding interactions with oxygen intermediates (OH*, O*, OOH*) – a critical factor that governs the rate of OER activity on the Sabatier-type analysis,11 lead to the superior OER activity of NiFe oxy(hydroxides). Furthermore, the introduction of Fe3+ to Ni(OOH) promotes the higher oxidation of Ni, and its typical layered double-hydroxide-like structure also enhances the electrochemical activity of these materials.9,13,17,18 However, their activities are still inadequate compared to IrO2 due to their poor electrical conductivity and fewer available active sites for the electrochemical reactions. To address these issues, various strategies have been introduced such as the introduction of foreign metal ions (multi-metallic),19–21 hetero-structures and/or composites with other materials or the utilization of conductive 3D electrode supports (e.g. Ni foam, Cu-foam, and carbon fibers, etc.), which boost the OER activity of NiFe-based materials.5,22 Particularly, NiFeOOH on 3D electrode metal foam substrates can afford an industrially relevant current density of 500 mA cm−2 at ηO2 < 300 mV.23 Likewise, most of the NiFeOOH systems reported to date highlighted the optimized synthetic methodology, morphology and Ni/Fe composition to achieve highly efficient oxygen evolution under the half-cell conditions. However, to the best of our knowledge, no report has yet explored the OER efficiency of NiFeOOH in the commercial water electrolysis systems, especially under industrial conditions, which is highly required to demonstrate the real value of the catalyst towards large scale H2 production.24,25
Herein, for the first time, we report the fabrication of a durable alkaline anion exchange water electrolyzer (AAEMWE) system using high-efficiency 3D-a-NixFeyOOH electrodes prepared via electrochemical integration of an amorphous NiFe (oxy)hydroxide catalyst on N-doped carbon fibers without any complex carbonization process. In general, N-doped carbon materials are attractive electrode supports due to their exceptional electrochemical activity and stability for energy conversion reactions. Doping highly electronegative nitrogen into the carbon matrix can induce uneven electric charge distribution on the adjacent carbon atoms, and so enhances oxygen electrochemistry on the N-doped carbon substrates. In addition, doping nitrogen through plasma treatment improves the surface roughness and wettability of the electrodes, resulting in better integration of NixFeyOOH with carbon fibers.26 Thus, integrating the unique advantages of the amorphous phase and N-doped carbon support results in a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at ultra-small η(O2)of 170 mV, small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec−1, and a faradaic efficiency of 98.5%. Significantly, the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode in commercial AAEMWE exhibits excellent operational stability of 240 h at an industrially relevant current density of 1 A, which demonstrates its applicability for practical H2 production.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Morphology and structural characterization

Fig. 1a illustrates the fabrication process of the 3D-a-NiFeOOH oxygen evolving electrode via a single-step co-electrodeposition method. Before the electrodeposition process, the CFP surface was treated using N2 plasma at room temperature for 180 s. Then, the co-electrodeposition of Ni and Fe was carried out in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) surfactant at 30 °C. High power X-ray diffraction was used to identify the crystal phase of the as-synthesized electrode materials. As shown in Fig. 1b, X-ray diffraction peaks of bare CFP can be indexed to (002), (101), (004), and (110) planes of graphitic carbon (JCPDS no. 98-000-0231). However, no apparent change in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns was observed after electrodeposition, which implies that the as-prepared NiFeOOH films are predominantly amorphous in nature. The surface characteristics of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP were further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 1c. The observed Raman bands at 313 and 465 cm−1 are attributed to the Ni2+–O, while a broad Raman band at 713 cm−1 is related to Fe3+–O.27,28 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the surface morphology and distribution of metal ions. Fig. 1d shows the randomly arranged porous 3-D carbon-microfibers of ∼2 μm. This porous carbon micro-fiber structure enhances the interaction between the carbon substrate and metal particles, which facilitates the nucleation and growth of the catalyst layer. As a result, the metal particles (Ni and Fe) are coupled strongly with each carbon fiber during electrodeposition (Fig. 1d and e), and the arrangement of these individual carbon-microfibers creates a thin film of NiFeOOH catalyst layer on the CFP surface. As depicted in Fig. 1e, SEM imaging of a-NiFeOOH/CFP revealed sphere-like aggregated structures. However, the HR-TEM images (Fig. 1f) showed no lattice fringes consistent with XRD data and further confirmed the amorphous nature of the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP catalyst. Besides, the TEM energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed the uniform distribution of Ni, Fe, C, N and O on the carbon surface and confirmed the formation of NiFeOOH (Fig. 1g).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to analyze the elemental states and chemical composition of the as-prepared materials. High-resolution XPS spectra of Ni2+ in Fig. 2a exhibit two peaks at binding energies of 855.8 and 873.5 eV attributed to Ni2+.22,29–31 The high-resolution spectrum of Fe 2p displays multiple peaks in the range between 705 and 730 eV, as shown in Fig. 2b. Peaks observed at ∼710.6 and 726.3 eV correspond to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 2b). Besides, a characteristic satellite peak for FeOOH observed at 717.8 eV confirms the +3-oxidation state of Fe in a-NiFeOOH.22,29 The high-resolution C 1s spectra (Fig. 2c) exhibit two peaks centered at 284.3 eV and 285.7 eV, indicating the presence of –C–C– (sp2 graphitic like carbon) and –C–N– (carbon bound with nitrogen).32–34 Furthermore, the high-resolution XPS N 1s spectra shown in Fig. 2d deconvoluted into three distinct peaks at 398.5, 401.3, and 403.3 eV, implying the presence of different nitrogen functional groups on the CFP surface. Most importantly, the presence of a graphitic-N peak at 401.3 eV evidenced the nitrogen doping on the CFP surface. Since carbon possesses a similar atomic size to that of nitrogen, it permits the nitrogen substitution on its surface and also creates strong covalent interaction with nitrogen. In addition, the n-doping effect by nitrogen improves the electrical conductivity and charge-carrier density of the CFP electrodes, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of electrodes.32 Meanwhile, the high depth profile analysis of CFP electrodes (Fig. S2a, ESI†) illustrates that the surface etching time significantly affects the level of nitrogen doping on the electrode surface. Furthermore, the deconvoluted O 1s spectrum (Fig. S2b, ESI†) shows three components at 529.5, 531.6, and 532.7 eV, which correspond to the metal–oxygen bond, hydroxide species, and adsorbed H2O, respectively. Furthermore, the chemical formula of NiFe is calculated as Ni0.86Fe0.14 from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.

2.2. Half-cell studies
Initially, the OER activity of the catalysts was measured through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) studies in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH electrolyte using a standard three-electrode system with a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. Commercial IrO2 was used as an OER benchmark. The OER performances of a-NiFeOOH/CFP, NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) on NF, NiOOH/CFP, and bare CFP were also tested under the same conditions for comparison. The polarization curves of NiFeLDH, NiOOH and a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrodes display a typical Ni2+ redox behavior at 1.35 V (vs. RHE). As shown in Fig. 3a, the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode demonstrated the best OER performance among all, exhibiting a small overpotential (ηO2) of 170 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was 80, 120 and 260 mV less than those of alkaline benchmark NiFeLDH/NF, commercial IrO2/CFP, and bare CFP, respectively. Significantly, the achieved overpotential is 45 and 160 mV lower than that of a-NiFeOOH/CFP (without surface activation) and NiOOH (without Fe doping). The above results clearly demonstrate that the surface activation and Fe-doping play a key role in the enhanced OER activity of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrodes. Most significantly, the obtained OER activity of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP outperformed those of previously reported NiFe based OER catalysts supported on Ni-foam with high mass loading (Table S1, ESI†). In particular, our OER electrode achieves high current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm−2 at extremely low ηO2 of only 240 and 290 mV, respectively.

(c) Nyquist plots of the catalysts measured at 1.5 V during the OER and equivalent circuit for the EIS spectrum. (d) The capacitive currents (Δj) at the potential of 0.94 V (vs. RHE) as a function of scan rates for a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP, a-NiFeOOH/CFP, NiOOH/CFP, and bare CFP (Δj = ja − jc). (e) Comparison of the TOF value of our catalyst with those of the state-of-the-art NiFe-based catalysts and IrO2 reported in the literature. (f) Chronopotentiometric curves of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP and commercial IrO2 electrodes at a constant applied current density of 100 mA cm−2 for 24 h. 
The OER kinetics of the above catalysts was further evaluated by the Tafel slope derived from the steady-state polarization plots shown in Fig. 3b. The Tafel slope values of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP, a-NiFeOOH/CFP, NiFeLDH/NF, IrO2/CFP, NiOOH/CFP and bare CFP electrodes were 39, 42, 48, 54, 59 and 130 mV per decade, respectively. The lowest Tafel slope value of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP indicates that it reaches a high current density with a small increment of overpotential, demonstrating its efficient charge transfer kinetics at the catalyst–electrolyte interface.
Electrochemical impedance measurements (EIS) were performed as a function of applied potential, to gain more insights into the charge transfer kinetics of the electrode materials. Fig. 3c shows the Nyquist plots of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP, a-NiFeOOH/CFP, NiFeLDH/NF, IrO2/CFP and bare CFP obtained at 1.5 V and their corresponding equivalent circuit (RC) model (inset of Fig. 3c). The appearance of a depressed semicircle in the high-frequency region (Rct) and the shift of Nyquist plots from zero magnitude suggest a charge-transfer process during the OER process along with solution resistance (Rsol). Hence, the following elements were used to fit the obtained Nyquist plots: solution resistance (Rsol), charge transfer resistance (Rct), and constant phase element (CPE). a-NiFe-OOH/N-CFP shows a much smaller Rct value (3.2 Ω) than a-NiFeOOH/CFP (8.2 Ω), NiFeLDH (14.8 Ω) and IrO2 (40.12 Ω), which suggests the high electronic conductivity and fast charge transfer kinetics of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP at the electrode–electrolyte interface during the OER, in agreement with the steady-state polarization results (Fig. 3a).
Fig. S3a (ESI)† shows the multistep-chronopotentiometric response of the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode measured in 1 M KOH solution as a function of applied current density from 10 to 500 mA cm−2. Upon applying 10 mA cm−2 current density, the potential of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP immediately levels off at 1.42 V and remains stable for 500 s. Similarly, it reaches a stable operating potential of 1.47 and 1.58 V at 100 and 500 mA cm−2, respectively. These results reflect the excellent mass transport properties, conductivity and mechanical robustness of the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode.22
To further evaluate the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the as-prepared catalyst was estimated through CV measurements in the non-faradaic region (Fig. S5, ESI†).35,36 As shown in Fig. 3d, the Cdl of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP is 1.6 mF, higher than 0.26 mF for IrO2/CFP, 0.229 mF for NiOOH, and 0.11 mF for bare CFP, indicating that a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP possesses high electro-chemically active sites for the electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, to reveal the effect of N2 plasma treatment on the OER activity, the Cdl value of a-NiFeOOH/CFP was compared with that of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP. In Fig. 3d, N2 plasma-treated CFP with a-NiFeOOH shows higher Cdl (1.6 mF) than bare CFP with a-NiFeOOH (0.34 mF) as a result of increased surface roughness of the electrode (Table S2, ESI†). Also, the Cdl analysis of samples with different plasma treatment times (120 s, 180 s, 300 s) did not show any significant effect. These results demonstrate that the improved ECSA and surface roughness can be achieved through N2 plasma treatment.34 Besides, surface wettability measurements of the as-prepared electrodes further showed the optimum electrical contact and high surface area by exhibiting a small contact angle of 89° compared to 113° for bare CFP (Fig. S6, ESI†).37,38 This can be attributed to the amorphous nature of as-prepared a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP, which affords more active sites for electrochemical reactions.
2.3. Intrinsic OER activity
To investigate the intrinsic OER activity of the as-prepared materials, the electrochemical active surface area normalized current density (jECSA), mass activity (Jm)and TOF (Fig. 3e) were calculated at ηO2 = 270 mV.35,39 As shown in Fig. S7(ESI),† a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP exhibits a higher jECSA than all other catalysts. For example, to attain jECSA = 10 mA cm−2 a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP requires an overpotential of 250 mV, which is 30, 91, and 118 mV smaller than those of a-NiFeOOH/CFP (280 mV), IrO2/CFP (341 mV) and NiOOH/CFP (368 mV), respectively. The a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP catalyst's high intrinsic OER activity is also reflected in its higher mass activity and TOF values. The TOF of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP (0.99 s−1) is much higher than that of a-NiFeOOH/CFP (0.243 s−1), NiFeLDH/NF (0.142 s−1) and the OER benchmark IrOx (0.0089 s−1). Significantly, we achieved a mass activity of 2527 A g−1 with a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP, 24-fold higher than NiFeLDH/NF, which is the highest mass activity reported for the OER in an alkaline solution.
2.4. Stability
Apart from the good OER activity of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP, its long-term stability is also an important factor to consider when fabricating a practical electrolyzer. To evaluate the durability, a constant high current density of 100 mA cm−2 was applied to the electrodes, and the corresponding potential was measured as a function of time (Fig. 3f). At j = 100 mA cm−2, the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode displayed a ηO2 of 230 mV and remains constant for 24 h. By contrast, under similar conditions, the IrO2 electrode exhibited a 370 mV overpotential with significant decay in the stability due to the acidic binder. Furthermore, the EIS spectra measured after the stability studies show a decrease in the charge transfer resistance (Fig. S8, ESI†). The above findings demonstrate the reproducibility and mechanical robustness of the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrodes for the OER.
2.5. Conventional electrolyzer
Inspired by the excellent OER performance of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP, an alkaline water electrolyzer was fabricated using a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP as an anode and Pt-coated Ti mesh (Pt–Ti mesh) as a cathode, to evaluate its performance for practical water splitting. For comparison, a commercial Pt/C//IrO2 electrolyzer and NiFeLDH/NF//Pt–Ti mesh electrolyzer were also fabricated and tested under similar conditions. Remarkably, our electrolyzer required a cell voltage of 1.485 V to afford 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4a), in comparison with 1.55 V for the NiFeLDH/NF//Pt–Ti mesh electrolyzer and over 1.62 V for the Pt/C//IrO2 electrolyzer. Moreover, such a moderate cell voltage for practical water splitting is impressive and outperforms the so far reported non-noble metal-based catalysts in the literature (Fig. 4c).29,40–54 Furthermore, the stability of the electrolyzer for the continuous operation was tested through the chronoamperometric method at 1.5 V, as shown in Fig. 4b. The a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP//Pt–Ti mesh electrolyzer showed a current density of 20 mA cm−2 and remained stable for 100 h, demonstrating its excellent durability for the continuous electrolysis. The remarkable OER activity of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP is attributed to the highly exposed metal active sites, and improved electrical conductivity due to the presence of amorphous NiFe on the surface-activated 3D-conductive substrate and a combination of the synergistic effect of Ni and Fe.

(b) Long-term stability of the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP-based electrolyzer at a constant potential of 1.5 V for 100 h. (c) Comparison of the cell voltage required to drive 10 mA cm−2 current density of our electrolyzer with currently available other state-of-the-art noble metal free metal-based electrolyzers. (d and e) Demonstration of the current density j and Ecell/V for the unbiased water splitting using the P-V integrated a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrolyzer. 
Furthermore, we integrated the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP//Pt–Ti mesh electrolyzer with a commercial P-V to demonstrate solar-driven water electrolysis. Fig. 4d and e demonstrate the P-V powered a-NiFeOOH/CFP electrolyzer that efficiently converts solar energy to hydrogen without any applied potential (ESI Video 1, ESI†). As depicted in Fig. 4d, our P-V integrated electrolyzer system directly converts the solar energy to H2 with an average current density of 161 mA cm−2 at 1.82 V with exceptional stability of 96 h on continuous operation. These results further verify the feasibility of our catalyst for practical water-splitting applications.
2.6. Physicochemical and electrochemical characterization of the NiFe-OOH/N-CFP after continuous electrolysis
To further probe the structural stability of our catalyst during the OER, physicochemical characterizations were performed after 100 h of continuous electrolysis. As shown in Fig. 5a, the XRD pattern of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP after electrolysis remained almost unchanged compared to the initial one, indicating that the amorphous nature of the catalyst was still preserved. However, we observed significant changes in the XPS spectrum of the catalysts after continuous electrolysis. In the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 5b; inset b), the appearance of an additional peak at ∼856.2 and 875.1 eV indicates the Ni3+ generation on the surface of the catalyst during the OER. Similarly, the peak observed at 533.4 eV in the high resolution O 1s spectrum demonstrates the surface adsorbed water molecules after the OER (Fig. 5d; inset b). However, the Fe 2p peaks (Fig. 5c; inset b) shifted to lower binding energies and some of the peaks disappeared after the continuous OER. These results are consistent with the previously reported results of NiFe-based OER catalysts. Besides, the SEM image in Fig. 5e revealed the sphere-like structure of the NiFeOOH/N-CFP catalyst, which was retained well after OER catalysis. Also, the ICP-MS analysis (Fig. S12, ESI†) after continuous electrolysis shows negligible degradation of the catalytic material during continuous operation. Furthermore, the LSV curve (Fig. 5f) recorded after continuous electrolysis shows no obvious changes compared to the initial curve, indicating the excellent stability of our electrode. The above findings confirm the long-term mechanical robustness and electrochemical stability of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrodes, which is important for practical applications.

2.7. Proof of concept: non-platinum group metals (non-PGM) based AAEMWE fabrication and analysis using an ultra-pure water electrolyte
Finally, a non-PGM based AAEMWE (Fig. 6a) was fabricated using a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP as an anode and MoNi4/MoO2–nickel foam (NF) as a cathode, and a solid polymer electrolyte (FAA-3-50, Fumatech) as a separator. For comparison, a commercial IrO2 based electrolyzer was also fabricated and tested under similar conditions. Fig. 6b shows the polarization curve of the AAEMWEs measured in ultra-pure water. Impressively, the AAEMWE with the a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP anode exhibits far superior water splitting performance than the commercial IrO2 electrolyzer. At 50 °C, our electrolyzer requires only a cell voltage of 1.88 V to achieve an industrially relevant current of 1 A, suggesting ∼80% electrical-to-fuel efficiency. On the other hand, the AAEMWE with commercial Pt//IrO2 catalysts affords the same current at a high applied cell voltage of 2.08 V. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest performance achieved for non-PGM based AAEMWEs reported so far, particularly in terms of its catalyst mass and synthesis process. Furthermore, the long-term stability of the AAEMWE was tested by applying a constant cell voltage of 2.0 V for 240 h, as shown in Fig. 6c (ESI Video 2, ESI†). On continuous operation, our electrolyzer demonstrated stability retention of 95.6% with an impressive membrane electrode assembly (MEA) degradation rate of 0.15 mA h−1, and a faradaic efficiency of 98.5% (Fig. 6d), which reveals the practicability of our system for the practical H2 production.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we developed a simple and scalable approach for the fabrication of an amorphous 3D-a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP O2 evolving electrode for efficient water-splitting applications. The as-obtained a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP electrode exhibited an ultra-small ηO2 of 170 mV, TOF value of 0.99 s−1, and overall durability of 500 h. Significantly, the outstanding OER performance and durability of a-NiFeOOH/N-CFP can be attributed to several features: (i) increased surface roughness (N2 plasma treatment), (ii) enriched surface-active sites due to the amorphous nature and sphere-like nanosheet array structure from Fe-doping, (iii) enhanced electrical conductivity by the electronic modulation via Fe-doping (synergistic effect), and (iv) the fast reaction kinetics and the enhanced durability as a result of efficient gas evolution and release properties due to the 3D conductive substrate. Furthermore, the remarkable OER activity in AAEMWE validates its practicability for large-scale hydrogen production. Besides, when combined with a solar cell, this AAEMWE efficiently converts solar energy to H2 without any external bias, demonstrating the promise of our electrode for energy and environmental science.
