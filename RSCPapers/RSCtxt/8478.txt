In the preparation process, TiO2 and phosphor particles were mixed to make photoelectrodes with bilayer (TiO2/mix), 3-layer (TiO2/mix/TiO2) and 4-layer (TiO2/mix/TiO2/mix) structures. The cell with the bilayer structure (TiO2/mix) after treating with TiCl4 solution showed the highest light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency (8.78%), which was ∼25.8% higher than that of a cell with a pure TiO2 layer under the same experimental conditions. The improvement in the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs was attributed to phosphor enhanced incident light-harvesting via up- and down-conversion luminescence processes, resulting in an increase in the photocurrent.
1. Introduction
The first dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) reported by Dr Grätzel's group in 1991 is a remarkable renewable energy device with a simple method of fabrication, eco-friendliness, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), and low cost.1–5 A DSSC generally contains a photoelectrode (PE) with a dye loaded on a nanoporous TiO2 film, a platinized counter electrode and an electrolyte solution. The PE is one of the most important components for determining the PCE of cells because the absorption spectrum of the PE determines the amount of light absorbed in a cell. For DSSCs, the PCE relies to a great extent on the harvesting of incident light, and the dye plays a key role in converting that light to electrical power. Many synthetic dyes have been used to improve light harvesting and increase the photocurrent of DSSCs. Most common Ru(II) dyes (usually N3, N719, N749), however, only absorb UV and visible light at wavelengths between 300 and 800 nm,6 meaning that most of the solar UV and IR irradiation cannot be utilized. More incident solar light can be utilized if the UV and IR radiation can be transformed to visible light and reabsorbed by dye molecules in DSSCs, which will enhance the photocurrent of DSSCs.
Phosphor particles have been applied widely in many research fields, including displays,7 lasers,8 bioimaging,9 and solar cells.10,11 Among them, Er-doped luminescent nanomaterials are attractive from both practical and fundamental viewpoints because of their unique optical properties arising from the intra 4f transition, which gives strong visible green emission.12,13 Recently, some other phosphor materials have been studied as a strategy for enhancing the light conversion efficiency of DSSCs. For example, Lu2O3:Tm3+, Yb3+ phosphor particles showed improved incident light harvesting via the down-conversion luminescence process and increased photocurrent. As a p-type dopant, rare-earth ions elevate the energy level of an oxide film and increase the photovoltage.14 As a result, the PCE of DSSCs with Lu2O3:Tm3+, Yb3+ doping has reached 6.63%, which is a 11.1% increase compared to DSSCs without Lu2O3:Tm3+, Yb3+ doping. Li et al. fabricated up-conversion hexagonal phase TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals and added them to the TiO2 photoanodes of DSSCs.15 Their results suggested that TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanodes can emit visible light under 495 or 980 nm excitation, and this visible light can then be absorbed by N719 dye to improve light harvesting. The PCE of the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell was increased by 10% compared to the pure TiO2 cell.
On the other hand, the PCE of DSSCs can also be improved by treating nanoporous TiO2 films with titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) solution followed by calcination in air, which results in the formation of TiO2 crystallites on the surface of nanoporous TiO2 films.16 The crystallites derived from the TiCl4 treatment increased the surface area of the film, which increased the absorption of dye molecules.17 The TiCl4 treatment also reduced the charge carrier recombination; hence, it improved the PCE of DSSCs.18,19
To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no reports about using a phosphor material with both DC and UC properties as a multilayer photoelectrode. Therefore, the present work departs from these interesting studies in terms of the effective use of phosphor nanoparticles with DC and UC properties for enhancing the efficiency of DSSCs. A range of PE structures were created by layer-by-layer deposition, and the cell efficiency was estimated to determine the optimal fabrication conditions.
2. Experimental details
2.1. DSSC fabrication
TiO2 pastes were prepared using the methodology described in the literature.20 TiO2 powder (P25, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5% purity) with a mean particle size of approximately 21 nm was used. FTO glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in acetone and ethanol with ultrasonication for 10 min each. The paste was coated on the FTO glass using the doctor blade technique, dried for 3 min at 100 °C and the coating process was then repeated to thicken the TiO2 layer. The coated PE was then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h.
To prepare the TiO2/mix PE, Gd2O3:1 mol% Er3+ phosphor particles were first synthesized using a previously reported procedure.21,22 The dried phosphor precipitates were calcined in air at 900 °C for 2 h. The Gd2O3:1 mol% Er3+ powder was dispersed further in 5 ml ethanol under ultrasonication for 20 min, and 5 ml of a TiO2 colloid solution was then added and stirred vigorously for 45 min. The TiO2/phosphor ratio was fixed to optimum 100:6 (molar ratio) in the final solution.10,14 The resulting mixed colloid was deposited on the already deposited TiO2 layer via repeated doctor blade coating and annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. The obtained TiO2/mix films were treated further with TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 0.5 h and calcined at 500 °C for 1 h. After the sample was cooled to approximately 90 °C, the TiO2/mix PE was immersed in a 0.5 mM N719 (Solaronix S. A.) dye solution in ethanol at room temperature for approximately 24 h and the films were rinsed with ethanol and dried with a nitrogen stream.
The counter electrode was fabricated by dip-coating the FTO glass into a chloroplatinic acid H2PtCl6 (Sigma-Aldrich, 37.5% Pt basis) solution followed by annealing at 400 °C for 0.5 h. The cell was assembled by sandwiching the photo-electrode together with the counter electrode using a 100 μm hot-melt polypropylene spacer. The space in between was filled with the liquid electrolyte (dyesol-TIMO). The other samples were also fabricated using a similar methodology to compare their conversion efficiency.
2.2. Characterization
The crystal phase of the prepared samples was characterized by X-ray power diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Discover) using Cu-Kα (λ = 0.15405 nm) radiation. The morphology and composition of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi-S4700). Elemental analysis was carried out by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; Horiba, 6853-H). The photoluminescence (PL, Hitachi F-7000) was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The UC emission spectra of the phosphor samples were recorded using a Hitachi F7000 spectrophotometer with a 975 nm diode laser as the excitation source. The current–voltage curves of the cells produced were measured under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Pecell Technologies Inc., PEC-L12 model) using a computer-controlled potentiostat (CHI-660B, CH Instruments). The active area of the cells was 0.16 cm2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by applying a bias of the open circuit voltage under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, and the data were recorded over the frequency range, 10−1 ∼ 105 Hz, using a 10 mV ac signal. The Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of the impedance data were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model and fitted with Z-view software. The incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were measured as a function of the wavelength from 300 to 800 nm using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (PV Measurements, Inc. QEX7).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the layered photo-electrodes used for DSSC fabrication. We examined the effects of different fabrication conditions, such as (a) phosphor addition and its location, and (b) the TiCl4 treatment effect on the overall performance of the DSSC. Both factors play an important role in enhancing the overall DSSC efficiency.

Fig. 2a presents a cross-sectional SEM image of a uniform 23 μm thick doctor bladed film with TiO2 nanoparticles. The SEM images of the Gd2O3:Er3+ (Fig. 2b) showed that the Er3+ ion doped Gd2O3 particles consisted of monodisperse spheres with a mean particle size ranging from 180 to 250 nm. A bilayer photo-electrode was created by coating a mixing layer on top of the TiO2 nanoparticle layer (Fig. 2c). The thickness of the TiO2 layer was ∼12.2 μm, whereas the TiO2/mix layer was ∼11.2 μm. The phosphor particles were dispersed homogeneously within TiO2 and a porous structure was formed throughout (Fig. 2d). The phosphor particles on the surface of TiO2/mix PE could not be observed due to the tiny phosphor particle concentration in the TiO2 colloid. EDX analysis of the TiO2/mix surface was performed to show the presence of phosphor particles within TiO2. The spectra revealed the presence of Ti, O, Gd, and Er on the surface of the TiO2/mix, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Therefore, Gd2O3:Er3+ particles were confirmed to be present within TiO2 nanoparticles.

The XRD patterns of TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. S2, ESI†) showed that the nanostructures contain mixed anatase (a) and rutile (r) phases. The XRD peaks at 25.2°, 37.8°, 47.9°, 54.0°, and 55.0° 2θ were assigned to the (101), (004), (200), (105), and (211) planes of the anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS no. 21-1272), respectively. The peaks at 27.5°, 36.1° and 56.6° 2θ were assigned to the (110), (101) and (220) planes of the rutile phase (JCPDS no. 21-1276), respectively. Fig. S3 (ESI†) presents the XRD pattern of Gd2O3:1 mol% Er3+ particles calcined at 900 °C for 2 h. The XRD patterns matched the characteristic peaks of the Gd2O3 standard cubic structure (JCPDS no. 88-2165). No additional peaks from the doped components were detected because of the low concentration of dopant ions.
Fig. S4a (ESI†) shows the normalized room temperature down-conversion (DC) emission spectra of Gd2O3:1% Er3+ particles under continuous 380 nm excitation. The emission peaks in the green region, at 522 nm and 537 nm, were assigned to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transition and the peaks at 550 nm and 562 nm were assigned to the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions. Fig. S4b† presents the up-conversion (UC) luminescence spectra of the same Gd2O3:1% Er3+ particles with continuous 975 nm NIR excitation (ESI†). The optical transitions within the 4f levels of Er3+ yield emission bands at 482–494 nm (blue), 512–581 nm (green) and 650–675 nm (red),which were assigned to the 4F7/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively.12,23 According to the literature, N719 dye has the strongest absorption in the green region (∼500–550 nm).20 Phosphor particles in the PEs can help to convert NIR and UV radiation into visible light photons, which can be later absorbed by N719 dye molecules. Thus, enhancement in light absorption can be achieved from the optical property of phosphor particles.

Fig. 3 shows the current density–voltage characteristics of DSSCs before the TiCl4 treatment, measured using cells with an active area of 0.16 cm2 under simulated 1.5 AM solar illumination. Table 1 lists the short circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and light to electrical energy conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs. A baseline device was fabricated with the bare TiO2 coating only on the FTO glass surface as the photo-electrode. Compared to the efficiency of the baseline device (PCE = 5.43%), the efficiency was enhanced to 6.51% using the bilayer with a TiO2/mix photo-electrode. The current density changed with the bilayer, ranging from 11.12 to 12.98 mA cm−2. This was attributed to the improved light absorption range of N719 from the UC-DC phosphor particles in the device. On the other hand, the efficiencies of the three layered (TiO2/mix/TiO2) (PCE = 4.44%) and four layered (TiO2/mix/TiO2/mix) (5.41%) devices were less than that of the baseline device. This might be due to two reasons. Since Gd2O3 is a wide band-gap material, it blocks the electron movement from the semiconductor TiO2 to the FTO glass inside the TiO2 layer. Therefore, the contact points and the interface between the TiO2 nanoparticles for the 3- and 4-layered become longer, resulting in reduced electrical contact among the nanoparticles, and reduced charge transport. In addition, the macro-pores generated by the size mismatches of TiO2 and phosphor particles can be penetrated by the electrolyte due to surface tension, and the charge recombination increased between the semiconductor and electrolyte. In addition, one can see that more light can be harvested (both from DC and UC processes) when a mixed layer is located on the top of composites (bilayer and four-layered photo-electrodes). Thus, the efficiency of DSSCs decreased for three layered, and then slightly increased again for the four layer structure.

The improvement in the open-circuit voltage was examined by measuring the interior impedance of the cells with different PEs, which were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS spectra exhibited three typical semicircles in the Nyquist plot and three characteristic frequency peaks in the Bode phase plot in the measured frequency range, 0.1–100 kHz (Fig. 4 and S5, (ESI†)). The EIS spectra fitted well to the corresponding equivalent circuits, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).

Table 2 lists the estimated fitted parameters. According to the literature,24 the ohmic serial resistances, Rs,R1, R2, and R3, are associated with the series resistance of TiO2/FTO glass substrates, interface of the electrolyte/Pt electrode, interface of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte, and electrolyte diffusion, respectively. The diameter of the first semicircle in the high frequency region presents the impedance corresponding to charge transfer at the counter electrode and/or electrical contact between the conducting substrate and TiO2. The diameter of the second semicircle in the middle frequency region provides information on the impedance at the TiO2–phosphor multilayer/dye/electrolyte interface related to charge transport/recombination, which is important for determining the efficiency of these DSSCs. The diameter of the third semicircle in the low frequency region indicates the Nernst diffusion resistance of the electrolyte. Rs,R1 and R3 were similar because the counter electrodes, TiO2 layer coating on the FTO glass, and electrolyte were all obtained in the same way. R2, which represents the interfacial resistance of the TiO2–dye/electrolyte interface, was 20.65 Ω for the nanoporous TiO2 layer cell and 17.86 Ω for the bilayer TiO2/mix cell. In the case of the bilayer with the TiO2–phosphor mixture device, a smaller R2 indicated a decrease in the interfacial resistance, which is beneficial to the enhanced fill factor and PCE. On the other hand, R2 increases when the number of layers in the PE is increased to 3 and 4. An increase in R2 means an increase in the recombination rate and indicates low electron transfer in the cells.

In addition, the electron lifetime (τe) was determined from the Bode-phase plots using the following equation:τe = 1/2πfmaxwhere fmax is the maximum peak frequency in the plot. From Table 2, the longest τe was observed in the case of the device with a bilayer (10.05 ms) compared to the other cases (7.92 ms for pure TiO2, 5.04 ms for 3 layers and 8.08 ms for 4 layers). A higher τe with a larger dye loading would contribute to a higher current density for the bilayer device.

Fig. 5a and Table 3 show the J–V characteristics of DSSCs with different photo-electrodes after the TiCl4 treatment. The devices with the bilayer, three-layer and four-layer photoelectrodes showed a conversion efficiency of 8.78%, 8.13% and 8.21%, respectively, which is higher than that of the baseline device (PCE = 6.98%). The device with the bilayer showed the highest conversion efficiency. This increase in current density is probably due to both light scattering caused by mixing the phosphor and TiO2 layer and the good dye uptake. The optimized bilayer was used further to fabricate devices functionalized with phosphor.

As shown in Fig. 5a, the current density increased for the bilayer, three layer and four layer photoelectrodes, indicating the enhanced light harvesting capability of N719 dye molecules. Fig. 5b shows the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency spectra of pure TiO2, bilayer, 3-layered, and 4-layered cells. The pure TiO2 photoelectrode exhibited an IPCE maximum of 46%, whereas the devices with a bilayer, 3-layers and 4-layers showed an IPCE maximum of 77%, 54% and 59% respectively. The IPCE of the phosphor layer devices was higher in both UV and visible regions. Also, the bilayer, 3 layer and 4 layer DSSCs showed an apparent increase in IPCE in the range of 650 to 675 nm, which was not observed in the pure TiO2 PE. Compared to the pure TiO2, the bilayer, 3 layer and 4 layer devices showed a higher IPCE value over a longer (>600 nm) wavelength range. This suggests that mixing of the up-/down-conversion particles with TiO2 makes it possible to harvest more solar photons in the NIR spectrum.

Fig. 6 and S7† show the EIS Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of the cells using different treated PEs. Table 4 lists the EIS data obtained by fitting the impedance spectra of these DSSCs. The size of the second semicircle (R2) in the cell with pure TiO2, bilayer, 3 layers, and 4 layers was 14.84 Ω, 12.63 Ω, 12.81 Ω, and 12.73 Ω, respectively. R2 represents the interfacial resistance of the TiO2–dye/electrolyte interface and recombination of injected electrons into the TiO2 film with an electrolyte. The Bode phase plots display the frequency peaks of the charge transfer process at different PEs. The specific low frequency peak (fmax) of the device with the bilayer, 3 layer and 4 layer electrodes shifted slightly to a lower frequency compared to the pure TiO2 PE. The peak shift from a high frequency to a low frequency revealed a more rapid electron transport process. Therefore, the electron lifetime for the recombination of the cells with the bilayer, 3 layers and 4 layers is longer than the electron lifetime of the TiO2 cell. These results suggest that the introduction of a TiO2–phosphor mixture as the scattering layer favors electron transfer and suppresses or reduces electron recombination.

After the TiCl4 treatment, the impedance R2 decreased significantly (Fig. S8(a), ESI†) and the electron lifetime increased (Fig. S8(b), ESI†). The TiCl4 treatment can enhance the connection of TiO2 particles, improving charge transportation through the TiO2 electrode. In summary, the lower resistance for electron transport and the longer electron lifetime for recombination could favor a higher charge collection rate of photogenerated electrons, which enhances the efficiency of DSSCs.
Fig. S8(c) in the ESI† shows the dependence of efficiency on the different PEs for the untreated and TiCl4-treated DSSCs. The efficiencies of the devices with the TiCl4-treated PE were higher than those of the devices without the treatment. The multilayer TiO2 and phosphor mixed with TiO2 particles hydrolyzed from TiCl4 had the following advantages. (1) The TiCl4 treatment increases the specific surface area significantly, which favors a higher level of absorption of sensitizer dye molecules, and increases the current density in DSSCs.25,26 (2) The macro-pores of all the films were filled with tiny TiO2 particles from the hydrolysis of TiCl4. The contact points and the interface between the nanoparticles become closer. Therefore, electrical contact among the nanoparticles was improved, and charge transport was enhanced. TiO2–phosphor material mixture films with more light scattering facilitate light capture and improve the light harvesting capacity of the PE; hence, pure TiO2 has the lowest efficiency. (3) A larger number of micro-pores were produced by the tiny TiO2 particles, where the micro-pores cannot penetrate the electrolyte due to surface tension, resulting in a decrease in charge recombination between the semiconductor and electrolyte.27 (4) The phosphor particles have up and down conversion properties. Therefore, a peak at 660 nm was observed in the IPCE spectra from UC emission at 660 nm of the phosphor from the bilayer, 3 layer, 4 layer electrodes, but not in the pure TiO2 electrode. Therefore, the better efficiency parameter for the DSSC containing phosphors than those for the DSSC lacking them indicates that the phosphor particles transform UV light and NIR light to visible light, which the dye N719 can absorb effectively; thereby increasing the sunlight harvesting and improving the efficiency of DSSCs.
4. Conclusion
This paper reported an efficient method to enhance the power conversion efficiency by improving the harvesting of incident light using a TiO2–phosphor mixture on a nanoporous TiO2 layer. The results showed that the additional surface treatment with TiCl4 solution improves the conversion efficiency of DSSCs from 6.51% for a TiO2/mix photoelectrode to 8.78%. The overall improvement in the DSSC efficiency was attributed to the improved light harvesting of dye molecules, which was achieved by the addition of phosphor particles into the photoelectrode followed by TiCl4 treatment.
