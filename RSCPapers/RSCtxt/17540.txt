Increasing the number of core perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) units and conjugating them with thienothiophene (TT) or dithiophenepyrrole (DTP) π-bridge units enhanced the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and also increased effective conjugation, thereby, improving the light absorption and molecular packing. The absorption coefficient of hPDI-DTP-IC2F (two PDI with DTP) has the highest value (8 × 104 cm−1) because it featured the greatest degree of ICT, being much larger than that of PDI-TT-IC2F (one PDI with TT), hPDI-TT-IC2F (two PDI with TT) and PDI-DTP-IC2F (one PDI with DTP) (1.64 × 104 cm−1). The PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F device provided the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.6%; this value was more than twice that of the PM6:PDI-DTP-IC2F (4.8%) device. This large increase in the PCE of the devices from the one-PDI core to two-PDI core case can be attributed to the two-PDI core case having (i) a stronger ICT, (ii) proper molecular packing that provided higher and more balanced carrier mobilities and (iii) a smaller energy loss than for the one-PDI case. Therefore, increasing the number of PDI units that were conjugated with suitable chromophores for stronger ICT in small molecule acceptors can be an effective way for enhancing the efficiency of organic photovoltaics.
Introduction
Harnessing energy from the sun through organic photovoltaics (OPVs) having bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) architectures,1–3 where the photoactive layer consists of an electron-acceptor and -donor blend, holds great promise because such devices display low-cost processability, environmental friendliness, and flexibility. The development of OPVs4,5 based on BHJ structures has progressed rapidly with major breakthroughs in the last five years, mostly as a result of the syntheses of new conjugated small molecule electron-acceptor materials,6–8 with potential applications in large-area, flexible, light-weight, and inexpensive solar energy conversion technologies.
When it comes to the design of novel electron acceptors for high-performance devices, the OPV research community has developed several strategies based on various state-of-the-art small-molecule acceptors9 used as replacements for fullerene derivatives, thereby overcoming the hard-to-adjust energy levels, relatively low absorption coefficients and high energy losses resulting from fullerene-incorporated devices. Typical design strategies include (i) band gap engineering,10 (ii) energy level engineering,11 (iii) side chain engineering,12–14 and (iv) heteroatom substitution.15 Variations and combinations of these strategies can also result in synergistic effects, thereby leading to elucidation of their fundamental mechanisms. When combining donor (D) and acceptor (A) building blocks into A–DA′D–A structural frameworks, which have been used widely in Y-series nonfullerene acceptors,16,17 the resulting OPV devices have demonstrated power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching beyond 18%.18–22 The low cost of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) and its various structural combinations have made it a useful building block core for small-molecule acceptors.23 Moreover, the absorption coefficient of PDI can be increased through fused-ring oxidation reactions to form a graphene-like structure at its bay position.24,25 Although structural versatility combined with additional ring-fusion makes PDI derivatives particularly useful in a broad range of research applications,26 close packing of the pyrene moiety can lead to substantial aggregation and recombination.27 The spatial dimensionality28 and polarity differences in the functional building blocks of PDI-based small molecules29,30 are the main reasons why these novel derivatives have been explored more systematically than others.31,32 Increasing the dimensionality with branched scaffolds enables the generation of functional structures combining multiple conjugation pathways.33,34 Varying the topologies and molecular features (e.g., the polarity and the linking of building blocks) of small organic molecules can lead to desired optical properties,35,36 better packing morphologies, enhanced inter- and intramolecular interactions,37 longer photoluminescence lifetimes,38 and increased carrier mobilities. Because these electronic and optical properties form the basis of high-performance OPVs, a clearer understanding of the structure–property relationships39 of organic molecules will accelerate progress toward more efficient organic solar cells and other electronic devices.
In this study, we synthesized four new small-molecule acceptors (PDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, hPDI-TT-IC2F, and hPDI-DTP-IC2F) having the structure A–D–A′–D–A40—where A, A′, and D represent the end group acceptor units, the central acceptor unit, and the π-bridge donor units, respectively—by varying the number of PDI units in the core and the nature of donor moieties. First, we used PDI as the A′ moiety of the central unit; we then increased the number of PDI units to form the twisted graphene-like PDI dimer41,42 to take advantage of the substantial increase in absorbance after fusing two PDI units. For the D units, we choose thienothiophene (TT) and dithiophenepyrrole (DTP)43 for their different electron-donating properties, aiming to strengthen the D/A oscillator when attaching them to the PDI cores and, thereby, increasing the intensity of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)44 absorption band. We choose fluorine-substituted 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN)45 to function as the end A units. We positioned odd-carbon-number α-branched dipentyl chains in both the PDI and DTP units in an attempt to balance their crystallinity and solubility. For the alkyl chain in TT, we used an undecyl group to maintain the same carbon number; undecyl chains have proven9,46 to be effective components in A–DA′D–A systems. To prevent the substantial aggregation of the PDI units that might have hindered phase separation, we used a single bond to link the central PDI and the dangling D–A units, thereby forming an A–D–A′–D–A system; we also suspected that the twisted conformation of the PDI dimer would prevent strong aggregation of the central unit. Our four synthesized small molecules displayed unique optical properties, owing to the differences between their PDI and hPDI cores as well as to the two different donor units positioned between the PDI/hPDI cores and the fluorinated INCN units. After blending with the state-of-the-art polymer PM6, the device incorporating hPDI-DTP-IC2F provided the highest PCE (11.6%) among all of these tested small molecule cases, along with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.91 V. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE ever reported for a device incorporating a twisted PDI dimer derivative as one component in the binary blend active layer. In contrast, the optimal PCEs of the devices based on PM6:PDI-TT-IC2F, PM6:PDI-DTP-IC2F, and PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F were 4.8, 4.8, and 5.2%, respectively; these relatively low PCEs of these devices arose mainly from their relatively lower absorption coefficients and high energy loss. Our success in obtaining a high PCE by varying the number of PDI units and the nature of the donor units in PDI-IC hybrid materials paves the way for the future design and modification of other useful fused-ring derivatives.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of the small-molecule acceptors PDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, hPDI-TT-IC2F, and hPDI-DTP-IC2F. Table S1 and Fig. S1† provide the thermal properties of these four small molecules. The decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of hPDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F (>320 °C) were higher than that of PDI-DTP-IC2F (250 °C), revealing that both hPDI-DTP-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F possessed good thermal stability. Scheme S1† outlines the synthetic procedures we used to prepare the four small molecules. Fig. 1b presents the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the acceptor materials, along with the energy levels of all of the other layer materials of the inverted OPV devices. Cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S2†)47–49 revealed that the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of the small molecules were −3.59/−5.70 eV for PDI-TT-IC2F, −3.76/−5.64 eV for PDI-DTP-IC2F, −3.71/−5.78 eV for hPDI-TT-IC2F, and −3.98/−5.72 eV for hPDI-DTP-IC2F, respectively. Thus, PDI-DTP-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F that possess dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) units had lower HOMO/LUMO energy levels than those of PDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-TT-IC2F having thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units, being consistent with the fact that the incorporated DTP units increase the effective conjugation length of the molecule more than incorporated TT units.

Fig. 2a and b present the UV-vis absorption spectra of dilute solutions and films of the four small molecules and PM6. The spectrum of the film of hPDI-DTP-IC2F featured broad absorptions in the range from 450 to 770 nm, with the absorption maximum at 656 nm; for the film of hPDI-TT-IC2F, absorptions appeared in the range 450–650 nm, with a maximum at 564 nm. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of hPDI-DTP-IC2F featured apparent broadening of the signals, relative to that of hPDI-TT-IC2F, suggesting strong ICT between the DTP linkers and the hPDI core. The absorption coefficients (ε) of the hPDI-DTP-IC2F and hPDI-TT-IC2F films from 300 to 430 nm were larger than those of PDI-TT-IC2F and PDI-DTP-IC2F, implying the effect of the twisted PDI dimer core when incorporating the dangling functional chromophores with substantially localized π–π* transitions, and larger intramolecular electron delocalization.50–52 With their hPDI cores, hPDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F had absorption coefficients from 450 to 700 nm that were higher than those of PDI-TT-IC2F and PDI-DTP-IC2F, indicating that the hPDI units interacted more strongly with the IC2F end groups than did the single PDI units, suggesting a more planar molecular geometry for hPDI. Fig. S3† reveals that the absorption coefficient (ε) of the PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F blend film at 636 nm (6.3 × 104 cm−1) was the highest among the four binary blend films; this blend film displayed a strong and broad absorption response in the range from 350 to 700 nm—desirable behavior for capturing more photons and enhancing the short-circuit current densities (JSC) of its OPV devices. Compared with the UV-vis absorption spectra of PDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, hPDI-TT-IC2F, and hPDI-DTP-IC2F in solution with absorption maxima at 516, 578, 546, and 608 nm, respectively, the spectra of the films featured their absorption maxima red-shifted to 524 nm (with a ε value of 3.96 × 104 cm−1), 588 nm (4.25 × 104 cm−1), 564 nm (4.69 × 104 cm−1), and 656 nm (6.46 × 104 cm−1), respectively. The absorption maxima of the films were slightly red-shifted because of certain degrees of aggregation of their PDI/hPDI cores and IC2F end groups.51,53 To further elucidate the interactions of the PDI and hPDI cores, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these films (Fig. S4†). Fig. S4a–d† reveal that the small molecules PDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, hPDI-TT-IC2F, and hPDI-DTP-IC2F exhibited broad PL peaks in the range from 770 to 875 nm when excited at the wavelength of each of the corresponding highest absorption peak. The PL emission peaks of PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F at 750 nm and PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F at 805 nm displayed stronger PL quenching than those of PM6:PDI-TT-IC2F at 757 nm and PM6:PDI-DTP-IC2F at 838 nm, indicating that the hPDI unit enhanced exciton dissociation and charge transfer between the donor and acceptor units.54 Fig. S4e† shows the PL spectra of PM6 and its binary blends, with excitation at a wavelength of 530 nm; the quenching efficiencies of the blends prepared with the hPDI-containing small molecules were slightly higher than those prepared with the PDI counterparts. Fig. 3a–d present the optimized geometric structures of PDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, hPDI-TT-IC2F, and hPDI-DTP-IC2F, calculated using density functional theory (DFT; B3LYP/6-31G** level). Fig. S5† displays the energy levels of the frontier orbitals of the HOMOs and LUMOs of the four small molecules; the dihedral angles a1 (66.83°) for PDI-TT-IC2F, b1 (68.07°) for PDI-DTP-IC2F, c1 (49.71°) and c2 (75.83°) for hPDI-TT-IC2F, and d1 (43.13°) and d2 (75.06°) for hPDI-DTP-IC2F are defined as being between those of the PDI/hPDI cores and the IC2F end groups. hPDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F, with their hPDI cores, had smaller dihedral angles, leading to larger degrees of conjugation that would presumably be beneficial for intermolecular packing.51,55

Fig. 4a and b show the current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves, respectively, of devices incorporating the binary blends of the synthesized small molecules and PM6. Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters of these OPVs. The VOC values of the devices involving hPDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F molecules having double PDI units are 0.90 and 0.91 V, respectively, that were greater than the VOC values of 0.74 and 0.77 V for the devices based on PDI-TT-IC2F and PDI-DTP-IC2F having a single PDI unit, respectively. To confirm these differences in their VOC values, we compare the energy loss that is defined by Eedge/q − VOC, where Eedge/q is a function of EQEedge.

Based on the Eedge/q − VOC equation, we obtained the energy losses for the devices of PM6:PDI-TT-IC2F, PM6:PDI-DTP-IC2F, PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F and PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F to be 1.23, 1.20, 1.10 and 1.00 eV, respectively, as demonstrated in Fig. S3a.† On the other hand, the optical band gaps of the PM6:PDI-TT-IC2F, PM6:PDI-DTP-IC2F, PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F and PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F blends films were 1.80, 1.67, 1.78, and 1.67 eV, respectively, indicating energy losses of 1.06, 0.90, 0.88, and 0.76 eV, respectively. Thus, the energy losses of the devices based on the two-PDI-unit core acceptors were smaller than those of the devices featuring the one-PDI-unit core acceptors in both energy loss methods that involve their EQE curves and the onsets of UV-vis curves56 (Fig. S3c†). The short-circuit current density (JSC) was the primary factor affecting the performance of our four different devices. The PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F device displayed the highest value of JSC (16.5 mA cm−2) because its active layer featured a broad absorption range (from 350 to 700 nm) with higher absorption coefficients than those of the PDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, and hPDI-TT-IC2F devices. The integrated photocurrents for the devices based on PM6:PDI-TT-IC2F, PM6:PDI-DTP-IC2F, PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F, and PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F were 10.3, 13.2, 9.4, and 15.6 mA cm−2, respectively. The EQE curves revealed that hPDI-DTP-IC2F, with its hPDI core, resulted in EQEs from 350 to 750 nm that were higher than those in the other cases, owing to the fact that hPDI-DTP-IC2F retained the 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide core conjugated structure of its hPDI unit and high absorption coefficients.57 The measured values of JSC of the devices and those calculated from the integrated EQE curves were quite similar, with deviations ranging from 1.5 to 4.2%. The fill factors (FFs) of these four devices were widely different, ranging from 46 to 74%, suggesting that the planarity of the core unit affected the blend morphology through its aggregation properties. Charge mobility is one of the key features affecting variations in PCEs. We used the Mott–Gurney equation to measure the hole and electron mobilities of the devices:  
The hole mobilities in the devices based on PM6:PDI-TT-IC2F, PM6:PDI-DTP-IC2F, PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F, and PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F were 1.03 × 10−5, 5.93 × 10−5, 1.55 × 10−4, and 2.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively; their electron mobilities were 1.92 × 10−5, 8.78 × 10−5, 2.57 × 10−5, and 3.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The ratio of hole-to-electron mobility was best-balanced, with a value of 0.71, for the device incorporating PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F; its small-molecule acceptor featured an hPDI unit conjugated with DTP units, not only resulting in a higher degree of charge transport but also more balanced hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities, along with a high value of JSC and a high FF, indicative of a better morphology. Furthermore, this OPV exhibited the highest PCE (11.6%) among our tested devices.
To investigate charge transfer phenomena and exciton generation in PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F and PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F systems, we applied ultra-broadband pump–probe spectroscopy to measure the time and photon energy-resolved transient absorption difference (ΔA) in the visible range from 500 to 670 nm. Fig. 5 shows ΔA spectra measured at a delay of 1 ps (5 ps) for the samples of PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F, PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F, PM6, pure hPDI-TT-IC2F and pure hPDI-DTP-IC2F, respectively. For all of the samples, the ΔA signal is dominated by the ground state bleaching (GSB)—a negative band extending from 500 nm to 670 nm. The ΔA signal amplitudes for PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F and PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F blends are comparable to that of PM6 but much larger than those of pure hPDI-TT-IC2F and pure hPDI-DTP-IC2F. This implies that the ΔA signal of PM6 dominates the ΔA signals of blend samples. The signal of pure hPDI-TT-IC2F and pure hPDI-DTP-IC2F samples appears at the probe wavelength shorter than 610 nm and longer than 630 nm, respectively. Therefore, the ΔA signal in the probe wavelength region from 610 nm to 630 nm is thought to reflect the primary kinetics of the electron excited in the electron donor, PM6. For the three samples of PM6, PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F and PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F, the ΔA traces are fitted by a single exponential function in the probe wavelength region from 610 nm to 630 nm. The estimated lifetimes are shown with the standard deviation in the wavelength region (see Fig. S8 in the ESI† for the detailed data). For the case of PM6, the lifetime is estimated to be τ = 13.3 ± 2.0 ps which can be assigned to charge relaxation through non-radiative recombination.58,59 The charge transfer lifetimes of the PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F blend and PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F blend are estimated to be τ = 4.4 ± 0.8 ps and τ = 6.8 ± 0.6 ps, respectively, being twice faster than that of PM6. The decay lifetimes of the blend samples can be ascribed to efficient charge transfer.59–61 This suggests that pure hPDI-TT-IC2F and pure hPDI-DTP-IC2F incorporated into PM6 result in charge transfer from PM6 to pure hPDI-TT-IC2F and pure hPDI-DTP-IC2F, respectively. The lifetime of the PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F blend is significantly shorter than that of the PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F blend, which indicates that charge transfer for producing photocurrent in the PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F blend is more efficient than in the PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F blend. This is thought to explain the reason why PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F has a higher PCE than PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F.62

We used two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to analyze the structures and orientations of our four binary blend films. Fig. 6 presents the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the PDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, hPDI-TT-IC2F, and hPDI-DTP-IC2F small molecules and their binary blend films. Fig. 7 shows the corresponding one-dimensional (1D) in-plane and out-of-plane GIWAXS profiles of the four small molecules and their binary blend films, measured along the qxy and qz directions, respectively. Fig. 6a reveals that the pristine hPDI-TT-IC2F, and hPDI-DTP-IC2F films possessed random molecular orientations, with weaker signals for the π–π (010) and lamellar (100) planes, owing to their smaller dihedral angles and stronger packing order. Fig. 7 reveals that the small molecule hPDI-DTP-IC2F mainly featured a mixed packing orientation in its pristine state. The spacings between the (100) planes of hPDI-TT-IC2F (qz = 0.36 Å−1), PDI-DTP-IC2F (qz = 0.38 Å−1), hPDI-TT-IC2F (qz = 0.33 Å−1), and hPDI-DTP-IC2F (qz = 0.40 Å−1) were 17.4, 16.5, 19.1, and 15.7 Å, respectively. The spacings between the other labelled (010) planes of hPDI-TT-IC2F (qz = 1.51 Å−1), PDI-DTP-IC2F (qz = 1.44 Å−1), hPDI-TT-IC2F (qz = 1.47 Å−1), and hPDI-DTP-IC2F (qz = 1.57 Å−1) were 4.2, 4.4, 4.3, and 4.0 Å, respectively. With their hPDI core units, hPDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F displayed packing behavior stronger than that of PDI-TT-IC2F and PDI-DTP-IC2F, consistent with the smaller dihedral angle leading to more planar and extended conjugated structures that favored intermolecular packing. After blending PM6 with the four different small molecules, the crystallinity of the polymer changed slightly. We determined the relative crystallinity of the PM6 crystallites from the intensity of the out-of-plane (100) peak. Based on Fig. 6b, the relative crystallinities of the PM6 crystallites in the blend films with the small molecules hPDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F were much higher than those in the blend films with PDI-TT-IC2F and PDI-DTP-IC2F, suggesting that the latter were dispersed relatively well in the blend films, owing to their relatively large dihedral angles making room for the crystallization of PM6. The peak intensities of the hPDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F phases in the blend films (Fig. 6b) were relatively weak, indicating that these small molecules were more highly dispersed in the amorphous matrices.

We used tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine the surface morphologies of our four blend films (Fig. S9†). The height images of the PM6:PDI-TT-IC2F, PM6:PDI-DTP-IC2F, PM6:hPDI-TT-IC2F, and PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F films provided root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughnesses of 2.23, 2.18, 2.34, and 2.29 nm, respectively. The four blend films displayed a smooth and rather uniform morphology, indicating that the perylenetetracarboxylic diimide unit had a suitable-for-aggregation smooth interfacial contact that increased the contact area, thereby achieving a more efficient charge carrier extraction from the active layer to the anode. To better understand the miscibility between PM6 and the four small-molecule acceptors, we measured the surface energies of the individual small molecules (Fig. S10†). The surface energies of PM6, PDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, hPDI-TT-IC2F, and hPDI-DTP-IC2F were 35.48, 41.06, 39.56, 37.28, and 37.13 mN m−1, respectively. The surface energy of hPDI-DTP-IC2F was closest to that of PM6, thereby allowing hPDI-DTP-IC2F to have miscibility with PM6 higher than that of PDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, or hPDI-TT-IC2F. Interestingly, we observed significant differences in the surface energies of the small molecules having the PDI and hPDI cores; we suspect that the hPDI core, with its greater number of alkyl chains, decreased the surface energy of the small-molecule acceptor, thereby modulating the miscibility of the two components in the active layer and forming a more suitable BHJ morphology.63

Fig. 8a shows that after 200 hours of storage in a glove box filled with nitrogen, the hPDI-DTP-IC2F, hPDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F and PDI-TT-IC2F devices retain 93%, 82%, 74%, and 73%, respectively, of their initial PCE values, indicating that hPDI-DTP-IC2F and hPDI-TT-IC2F with the two-PDI-unit core show better photostability than that of PDI-DTP-IC2F and PDI-TT-IC2F. Fig. 8b shows that after 720 minute-annealing at 85 °C in a N2-filled glove box without encapsulation, the hPDI-DTP-IC2F, hPDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, and PDI-TT-IC2F devices retain 85%, 63%, 82% and 57%, respectively, of their initial PCE values, indicating that the thermal stability of the hPDI-DTP-IC2F and PDI-DTP-IC2F with dithiophenepyrrole (π-bridge donor units) devices degraded slower as compared to that of the PDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-TT-IC2F cases. Fig. S11† shows that the VOC almost remained identical regardless of the four acceptors used by treating the devices at 85 °C in a N2-filled glove box after 720 minutes. In contrast, the JSC and FF of the devices with dithiophenepyrrole as π-bridge donor units such as PDI-DTP-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F devices degraded slower as compared to that of the PDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-TT-IC2F devices. This result confirms that the molecular structure incorporating dithiophenepyrrole (DTP) as π-bridge donor units improved the thermal stability of the devices.

Table S3† summarizes the detailed structural characteristics of all of the active layers and the corresponding device performances. We suggest three main reasons why the devices incorporating PM6/hPDI-DTP-IC2F displayed the best photovoltaic performances.
First, the short-circuit current densities of the devices based on PDI-DTP-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F, featuring DTP π-bridge donor units, were higher than those of the devices based on hPDI-TT-IC2F and PDI-TT-IC2F, featuring TT π-bridge donor units. The greater degree of conjugation of the symmetrical DTP π-bridge donor units with the two PDI units in the hPDI-DTP-IC2F structure produced a stronger ICT effect and, thereby, led to broader light absorption than in the case of hPDI-TT-IC2F. Furthermore, the devices incorporating the acceptors with DTP π-bridges had more balanced charge carrier mobilities that minimized charge accumulation, relative to those incorporating acceptors with TT π-bridges. (ii) The hPDI cores (two PDI units) had higher absorption coefficients from 450 to 700 nm for hPDI-TT-IC2F and hPDI-DTP-IC2F, in contrast to the amorphous structures of PDI-DTP-IC2F and PDI-TT-IC2F. Both factors contributed to a greater value of JSC for the device based on PM6:hPDI-DTP-IC2F, relative to the other OPVs.
Second, the FFs of the OPVs ranged from 44.1 to 74.0%, with the device incorporating hPDI-DTP-IC2F having the highest value, implying that hPDI (two PDI units), with its more planar core, enhanced the packing of its binary blends, consistent with calculated smaller dihedral angle providing a larger degree of conjugation.
Third, based on the absorption onset and EQE edge data, the hPDI-DTP-IC2F device exhibited smaller loss in the open-circuit voltage than the PDI-DTP-IC2F device, implying that the hPDI core unit more effectively decreased the energy loss, relative to the PDI core unit.
Conclusions
We have synthesized four new small-molecule acceptors (PDI-TT-IC2F, PDI-DTP-IC2F, hPDI-TT-IC2F, and hPDI-DTP-IC2F) having A–DA′D–A alternating acceptor-and-donor structures, with different numbers of core PDI acceptor units and different types of bridging donor units that provide different degrees of intramolecular charge transfer. These small molecules displayed unique optical properties, owing to their different PDI and hPDI core units and the different donor units (TT and DTP) positioned between their PDI/hPDI cores and terminal fluorinated INCN units. The device incorporating hPDI-DTP-IC2F blended with PM6 provided the highest PCE (11.6%) among all the tested devices, along with a high value of VOC (0.91 V); in contrast, the device incorporating PDI-DTP-IC2F provided a PCE of 4.8%. We conclude that the higher performance of the device based on the small-molecule acceptor hPDI-DTP-IC2F than that based on PDI-DTP-IC2F resulted from (i) the DTP π-bridge donor units, with their high electron density and lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom, increasing the ICT absorption band, (ii) the twisted structure of the hPDI dimer core unit, relative to the flat PDI core unit, decreasing the steric bulk of the small molecule and enhancing π-stacking for higher and more balanced carrier mobilities in the active layer and (iii) a smaller open-circuit energy loss. This strategy of engineering the core acceptor unit and π-bridge donor units of an A–D–A′–D–A small molecule appears to be a general one for improving the performance of OPVs.
