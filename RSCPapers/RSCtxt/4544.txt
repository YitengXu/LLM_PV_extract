Introduction
Rylene dyes,1,2 particularly the naphthalene and perylene diimides, NDIs and PDIs respectively, continue to emerge as quintessential chromophores in a variety of photofunctional molecules, materials, and supramolecular assemblies.3–7 In addition to their desirable dye properties including visible-to-near-IR light-harvesting capacity and impressive fluorescence properties, both small and higher-order rylenes have established niche applications in molecular switching, dye lasers, chemical sensing, organic electronics including field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaics, as well as biological labeling.1–7 While the myriad of organic materials constructed from these versatile building blocks is truly impressive, metal–organic molecules and metallo-supramolecular structures bearing rylene dyes have expanded the inventory of available photochemistry and photophysics from these chromophores and as a result their potential applications. It is these latter topics that comprise the focus of the present treatment. This Perspective will not consider the expansive literature related to rylene-based macrocyclic architectures, including metalloporphyrin- and metallophthalocyanine-rylene conjugates, as the metal center in these molecules is nominally a spectator with respect to excited state dynamics and decay. Similarly, only metal compound-rylene compositions whose photophysical and/or photochemical reactivity have been explored will be discussed in detail.
Metal complex–naphthalimide conjugates

  The first report of coordination complex–naphthalimide conjugates using ligand 1 emerged from the author's laboratory in 2001, namely [Ru(bpy)2(1)]2+ and [Ru(1)3]2+.8 These molecules were originally designed to take advantage of the visible light harvesting properties of the 4-piperidinyl-1,8-naphthalimide (PNI) subunit(s) whose intense singlet fluorescence overlaps the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption bands characteristic of the Ru(II)-diimine core. This strong spectral overlap coupled with the short distances separating the tethered chromophores provided idyllic conditions for facilitating resonance energy transfer,9–11 which indeed was the case as evidenced by the near quantitative quenching of the NI singlet fluorescence in these polychromophores with corresponding sensitization of the orange MLCT photoluminescence. This is precisely where the “textbook” behaviour ends and the ramifications of having closely lying triplet manifolds in the excited states of the composite molecules become readily apparent. If one measures the luminescence intensity decay of [Ru(bpy)2(1)]2+ and [Ru(1)3]2+ in the region of the MLCT emission, their associated single exponential decays ranged from 16 to 115 μs, depending upon the number of PNI subunits and the solvent. The emission kinetics correlated well with the absorption transients, each primarily reporting on the excited state decay of each composite chromophore. The combined data were consistent with excited state equilibrium between the higher lying triplet MLCT state and the lower-lying PNI triplet state, much like that observed in numerous Ru(II)-pyrenyl molecules.12–17 Please note that McClenaghan and co-workers have recently reviewed the general phenomenon of integrating metal complexes with organic chromophores with the intention to generate extended excited state lifetimes.18 Several years later we applied nanosecond step-scan Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to [Ru(bpy)2(1)]2+ and [Ru(1)3]2+ in order to identify how the characteristic imide CO bands would shift in response to formation of the ligand-localized triplet state on the PNI subunit(s).19 Much to our surprise, triplet state formation was easily detected by the fact that all the bands significantly red shifted by 60–100 cm−1 upon formation of the PNI triplet excited state and these results were correlated to appropriate DFT calculations.
In 2011, the same PNI ligand 1 was coordinated to a Re(I) tricarbonyl chloride complex, Re(1)(CO)3Cl, producing record-setting excited state lifetimes (650 μs) for the associated MLCT state through the equilibrium-generating reservoir effect, a net 3000-fold increase in lifetime with respect to the Re(phen)(CO)3Cl charge transfer model compound.20 However, distinct from all prior studies investigating triplet state equilibria, this work monitored excited state decay using 3 different transient spectroscopic domains (absorption, luminescence, and infrared) with time scales ranging from ∼150 femtoseconds to hundreds of milliseconds. The MLCT excited state was monitored by transient IR using CO vibrations through time intervals where the corresponding signals obtained in conventional visible transient absorption were completely obscured by overlap with strong transients originating from the pendant PNI chromophore, as illustrated in Fig. 1 and 2. Following initial excitation of the singlet ligand centered (1LC) state on the PNI chromophore, energy is transferred producing the MLCT state with a time constant of 45 ps, a value confirmed in all three measurement domains within experimental error. Although transient spectroscopy confirms the production of the 3MLCT state on ultrafast time scales, Förster resonance energy transfer calculations using the spectral properties of the two chromophores support initial singlet transfer from 1PNI* to produce the 1MLCT state by the agreement with the experimentally observed energy transfer time constant and efficiency. Intersystem crossing from the 1MLCT to the 3MLCT excited state is believed to be extremely fast and was not resolved in this study. Finally, triplet energy was transferred from the 3MLCT to the PNI-centered 3LC state in less than 15 ns, ultimately achieving equilibrium between the two excited states. Subsequent relaxation to the ground state occurred via emission resulting from thermal population of the 3MLCT state with a resultant lifetime of 650 μs. The Re(1)(CO)3Cl chromophore represents an interesting example of “ping-pong” energy transfer wherein photon excitation first migrates away from the initially prepared 1PNI* excited state and then ultimately returns to this moiety as a long-lived excited triplet which disposes of its energy by equilibrating with the photoluminescent Re(I) MLCT excited state. The molecular photophysics of Re(1)(CO)3Cl are summarized in the energy level diagram in Fig. 3.

  Interested in producing phosphorescence from NI molecules, we collaborated with the Zhao group in Dalian on the Pt(II) complex 2,21 where intimate coupling of the Pt heavy atom into the aromatic backbone was afforded by the acetylide linkage.22,23 Indeed, room temperature phosphorescence was observed from a naphthalimide species for the first time in this square planar chromophore. The combination of static and time-resolved absorption and photoluminescence data were uniformly consistent with triplet state photophysics localized on an appended CC–NI unit following excitation into the low energy absorption bands. This molecule features rather impressive long-lifetime, high quantum efficiency NI-based room temperature phosphorescence (τ = 124 μs, Φ = 0.215) centered at 621 nm (Fig. 4), exemplifying how the Pt-acetylide linkage strongly promotes intersystem crossing in the NI subunit, representative of a class of molecules whose excited states are typically dominated by singlet fluorescence. The group in Dalian soon after produced a series of related molecules exhibiting similar photophysics.24

A recent report from the Petoud and Star groups at Pitt demonstrated that a 3rd generation PAMAN dendrimer whose periphery was decorated with 32 individual 1,8-naphthalimide light-harvesting chromophores could be used as an effective ligand scaffold for Eu(III) ions.25 In the final coordination assembly, 8 Eu(III) ions were incorporated into the PAMAN interior and the composite material served as an effective solid state O2 sensor using both Eu(III) photoluminescence, with the antenna effect imparted by the NI peripheral chromophores, and electrical conductance for signal transduction when present on the surface of single walled carbon nanotubes.
Metal complex–naphthalenediimide conjugates
Transition metal complexes covalently tethered to naphthalenediimides represent metal dye-rylene constructs largely investigated in the realm of intramolecular excited state electron transfer photochemistry. The earliest studies linking Ru(II) polypyridine sensitizers to NDIs occurred in 1997 by workers in Japan and the US. In the former case, the Haga group reported the excited state electron transfer processes occurring in a Ru(II)–NDI–Os(III) triad using picosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.26 Predominant excitation of the Ru(II) CT chromophore first results in proximate charge separation producing the Ru(III)–NDI−˙ ion pair followed by an additional charge shift reaction reducing Os(III) to Os(II). Ultimately, charge recombination between the two distal metal centers occurred with a time constant of 110 ns. Dixon and co-workers investigated excited state electron transfer processes in the Ru(II)-NDI dyad 3 using dynamic fluorescence experiments in the presence and absence of calf thymus DNA to see if the donor–acceptor electronic coupling would be modulated as a result of NDI intercalation.27 Even though the NDI subunit intercalates DNA as evidenced by circular dichroism and a bathochromic shift in its UV-Vis spectrum, this has negligible consequences in the photoinduced charge transfer reaction. The average rates derived from a tri-exponential model of the data in aqueous buffer with and without DNA are 1.6 × 109 and 6.8 × 108 s−1, implying that the activation energy in addition to the electronic coupling for the forward electron transfer reaction are strangely unaffected by the DNA support.

  These initial electron transfer dyads were linked together by flexible chains resulting in a range of conformers being sampled using transient spectroscopic measurements. This flexibility can also assist in charge recombination and as a result following selective excitation of the MLCT core, the charge separation time constant can be largely attenuated in its magnitude. Interested in circumventing these limitations, an extensive collaborative effort in Sweden produced seven distinct Ru(II) bipyridyl and terpyridyl molecules covalently tethered to a single NDI.28 The two series of conformationally rigid donor–acceptor complexes were primarily investigated using femtosecond transient absorption spectrometry. The terpyridyl-based molecules did not show any evidence of quenching whatsoever whereas the bipyridyl analogues each demonstrated excited state oxidative quenching as indicated by characteristic transient signals emanating from the NDI radical anion at 474 and 605 nm. The dyad with the closest donor–acceptor center-to-center distance exhibited separation and charge recombination electron transfer rate constants of 5.0 × 109 s−1 and 7.0 × 109 s−1, respectively. In the longer aryl spaced donor–acceptor molecules the story was not as straightforward since biphasic forward electron transfer kinetics were observed and approximately 20% of the charge-separated state was formed through the NDI triplet state.

  
  This work was later extended to include a manganese complex playing the role of donor in triad 4.29 In this comprehensive study, EPR and optical spectroscopy were used to demonstrate the light-induced formation of the long-lived electron transfer products. Excitation of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ core ultimately results in the oxidation of the manganese dimer (formally Mn2II,III) and concomitant reduction of the NDI subunit (NDI−˙), the latter radical persisting for a record 600 μs at room temperature and to almost 1 s at 140 K. This enhanced charge separation lifetime was attributed to the significant reorganization energy (∼2.0 eV) with origins predominantly associated with the inner sphere reorganization of the appended Mn2 complex, thereby creating conditions favoring long-lived charge separation in the Marcus normal region.
In a related study, a triad constructed from a triphenylamine donor, an Ir(III) MLCT complex, and NDI acceptor (5) also produced a long-lived charge-separated state of 120 μs at room temperature in CH3CN.30 Due to significant spectral overlap, selective excitation of the MLCT complex is not possible and 355 nm laser excitation gives rise to the observation of transient signals from the oxidized triphenylamine and the reduced NDI, ultimately recombining with the 120 μs time constant mentioned above.

  Similar to the author's work on the naphthalimides, in 2008 Weinstein and co-workers synthesized the first example of the Pt(II)-naphthalenediimide complex (6) and applied a battery of photophysical techniques to unravel the excited state composition and dynamics associated with this chromophore.31 Excitation into the low energy absorption bands of 6 (355–395 nm) initiates a series of processes wherein many distinct excited states are involved, including 1NDI* (0.9 ps), 3MLCT* (3 ps), vibrational cooling of 3NDI* (19 ps) and finally decay of the extremely long-lived 3NDI* state (520 μs). Similar to the PDI triplet excited state, the 3NDI* state possesses ν(CO) vibrations at 1607 and 1647 cm−1 that are shifted quite significantly red-shifted with respect to their ground state counterparts. Distinct from all the other NDI systems described above, there is no spectroscopic evidence for excited state electron transfer but rather energy migration to the 3NDI* state dominates excited state decay in 6.

  Finally, Miller and Schanze described the dynamics of triplet exciton and negative polaron (electron) transport within a series of monodisperse platinum acetylide oligomers terminated with NDI end groups (7) in 2011.32 Negative polaron transport was investigated using pulse radiolysis/transient absorption whereas triplet exciton migration was investigated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. In pulse radiolysis experiments, electrons are attached to the oligomeric structures and the resultant absorption changes monitored, eventually leading to the production of the NDI−˙ radical anion. Similarly, near visible excitation with ultrafast laser pulses generate triplet excitons localized on the Pt-acetylide chains, ultimately yielding a charge-separated state with characteristic NDI−˙ signatures. The combined results suggested that both triplet excitons and negative polarons migrate over large distances quite rapidly in these oligomeric structures, ∼3 nm in less than 200 ps. Analysis of the dynamics modeled using a site-to-site hopping mechanism indicated that diffusive transport occurred with time constants of ∼27 ps for triplet excitons and <10 ps for electrons.   
Metal complex–perylenediimide constructs
Coordination at the imide nodal region
Before proceeding it is worthwhile to mention that at present there is only one published example of metal complex/perylene monoimide molecules from Espinet and co-workers, whose photophysics is completely singlet state dominated.33 However, the realm of metal complex containing PDI structures continues to develop and provided significant motivation for the composition of this Perspective. The first molecules to be described herein are those where the PDI is coordinated to the metal at the imide region that effectively decouples the electronic structures of the PDI and metal components as a result of the node located at those bonding positions.3,6
Würthner and his co-workers in Germany are credited with synthesizing the first two examples of coordination compounds bearing PDIs in 2000, specifically tetranuclear Pd(II) and Pt(II) molecular squares featuring cis-geometry enforcing chelating bis-phosphine corners, 8a and 8b.34 Unlike those molecular squares that take advantage of the spin–orbit coupling properties of the metal ions resident in the structure,35,36 these molecules were designed solely to take advantage of metal–ligand coordination-directed self-assembly while retaining the singlet state fluorescence and redox properties of the PDI linkers.37 This was further exploited in a pyrenyl-decorated PDI Pt(II) square, which contained 16 pyrenes and 4 PDIs, ultimately achieving periphery-to-center energy and electron transfer chemistry.38 In a structurally analogous molecule containing 16 ferrocene subunits, each electroactive species could be independently addressed electrochemically via one-electron oxidation.39 Concurrent with their work on the molecular squares, the Würthner group also constructed linear coordination metallopolymers using a bifunctional PDI with phenyl-terpyridyl appended at the two terminal imide positions.40 These macromolecules also retained the red fluorescence properties of the starting monomer and were also deposited on solid supports through coordination chemistry driven layer-by-layer deposition on quartz substrates. Along similar lines, Müllen and Stang combined forces to produce rhomboid and rectangular polynuclear structures containing PDI linkers also driven by Pt(II) self-assembly.41

  Workers in Spain have recently contributed in this area, evaluating an Ir(III)–PDI dyad (9) proposed as a red-light emitting electrochemical cell exhibiting an external quantum efficiency of 3.3%.42 In a subsequent report, these investigators elucidated the molecular photophysics of 9, illustrating intramolecular energy transfer occurring between the Ir(III) MLCT excited state and the PDI triplet.43 The 3PDI* state characteristically exhibits a major T1 → Tn absorption band that is displaced blue with respect to the ground state bleach and is therefore easily distinguished from the red-shifted PDI radical anion generated in excited state electron transfer reactions.
Fukuzumi and co-workers have prepared a series of 3 donor–acceptor molecules constructed from electron donating ferrocenes and electron accepting core-substituted perylenediimides.44 The combination of ultrafast and conventional transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that excited state electron transfer takes place in all three molecules in benzonitrile. The lifetime of the charge separated state in the dicyano-PDI-ferrocene triad containing 2 ferrocene subunits was more than twice that of the associated dyad, suggesting that presence of the second ferrocene helps to stabilize the CT state. Electron transfer quantitatively quenches the singlet state of the PDI in the dipyrrolidine substituted PDI-ferrocene chromophore and the subsequent charge recombination reaction leads to the production of the long-lived PDI localized triplet state.

  A collaboration between research groups at Northwestern, Yale, and North Texas probed ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer from an iridium-based water oxidation catalyst Cp*Ir(ppy)Cl (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) to PDI derivatives (10a and 10b),45 the latter is an extremely strong photooxidant owing to the presence of 4 CF3 electron withdrawing substituents present in the bay positions. Photoexcitation of the PDI in each dyad results in reduction of the chromophore to PDI−˙ occurs with time constants <10 ps, a process that outcompetes any generation of 3PDI*. Biexponential charge recombination largely to the PDI–Ir(III) ground state is suggestive of multiple populations of the PDI−˙–Ir(IV) ion-pair, whose relative abundance varies with solvent polarity. Electrochemical studies of the dyads show strong irreversible oxidation current similar to that seen for model catalysts, indicating that the catalytic integrity of the metal complex is maintained upon attachment to the PDI photosensitizer.
Functionalization in the aromatic bay region
In 2007, Rybtchinski and co-workers intended to purposely alter the electronic structure, excited state decay, and the resultant photofunctionality of PDI chromophores by placing σ-bonded Pd(II) subunits 1,7-in the aromatic bay positions.46 Both dinuclear molecules were synthesized through oxidative addition of the corresponding 1,7-Br2-PDI precursor with Pd(dba)3 in the presence of either PPh3 or 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe), respectively. Unfortunately, even in the presence of two proximate heavy atoms, the PDI-based fluorescence quantum efficiencies remained large, Φ = 0.65 and 0.22, and the singlet excited state lifetimes were also on the nanosecond time scale. The combined experimental results, also corroborated by TD-DFT calculations, revealed that the Pd(II) centers were well decoupled from the PDI aromatic π-system even though they were directly σ-bonded.
Interested in the potential of utilizing triplet excitons in organic photovoltaics,47,48 we designed molecules 11–13 in 2008 hoping to efficiently generate the triplet state of PDI following photoexcitation in three distinct Pt(II) mononuclear square planar structures.49 The platinum-acetylide motif was selected because this combination is known to induce strong spin–orbit coupling facilitating rapid (kisc > 1011 s−1) singlet → triplet intersystem crossing in the appended organic chromophore(s).50 Structures 12 and 13 examined the influence of cis- vs. trans-PDI-acetylide ligation whereas 11, inherently possessing a more complex electronic structure, addressed the consequence of positioning a 3CT excited state energetically proximate to the PDI triplet. In all three molecules the PDI singlet fluorescence was quantitatively quenched, 1O2 photoluminescence was efficiently sensitized at 1270 nm, and conventional transient absorption difference spectra illustrated production of the 3PDI excited state with long associated lifetimes, Fig. 5. Unfortunately, no phosphorescence could be detected from these structures at room temperature. In the following year, we evaluated the ultrafast transient absorption dynamics of these chromophores and contrasted the results with the “free” acetylene-terminated ligand, abbreviated as PDI-CCH.51 Upon ligation to the PtII center, the bright singlet-state fluorescence (Φ = 0.91, τ = 4.53 ns) of the free PDI-CCH chromophore is quantitatively quenched and no long wavelength photoluminescence is observed from any of the Pt-PDI complexes in deaerated solutions. Ultrafast transient measurements revealed that upon ligation of PDI-CCH to the Pt(II) center, picosecond intersystem crossing (τ = 2–4 ps) from the 1PDI excited-state is followed by vibrational cooling (τ = 12–19 ps) of the hot 3PDI excited state, whereas only singlet state dynamics, including stimulated emission, were observed in the “free” PDI-CCH moiety. Recently, we have extended this work to include the terpyridyl variant, [Pt(tBu3tpy)(CC-PDI)]+, whose HOMO and LUMO orbitals calculated by DFT (Gaussian '09) in a CH2Cl2 continuum (PCM) are presented in Fig. 6. The calculated orbitals depicted in Fig. 6 are intended to illustrate the strong ligand-localized character of the lowest energy optical transition and the minor perturbation imparted by the Pt(II) center. It should be noted that bimolecular reactions occurring between metal-containing chromophores and PDIs also represent another emerging area of investigation. For example, the strong singlet fluorescence associated with PDI chromophores makes them attractive molecules as acceptors/annihilators in photon upconversion schemes based on sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation.52,53

  Rybtchinski and co-workers recently developed a unique approach for non-covalent nanoscale synthesis using a single a molecular building block containing a PEG substituted PDI chromophore and a terpyridyl ligand covalently attached to the diagonal bay position (14);54 this work has been recently highlighted by Frauenrath as well.55 Prior to metal coordination, 14 self-assembles into long fibers (at least several microns long) from water/THF mixtures as established from cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) images. These fibers possessed all the characteristics of face-to-face π-stacks (H aggregates) of PDI structures stacked in a perpendicular fashion with respect to the fiber axis. Compound 14 behaves as a disassembled molecular species when dissolved in CH2Cl2. The supramolecular self-assembly process was markedly modified by the coordination of Pd(II), Pt(II), and Ag(I), producing tubular, vesicular, and nanoplatelet aggregates, respectively, as determined by cryo-TEM. Most notably, the aggregated structure derived from Pt(II) coordination exhibited the usual optical hallmarks of Pt(II)–Pt(II) metal–metal interactions typically observed in Pt-terpyridyls in both the solid state and in solution aggregates.56,57 The PDI-based singlet fluorescence intensity decays in all aggregates formed displayed pump fluence dependence interpreted as having its origin in exciton annihilation processes whereas the corresponding disaggregated structures measured in chloroform did not display any power-dependent singlet fluorescence behaviour. In 2011, the same group further elaborated this concept, preserving the features of the Pt(II) derivative of 14 whilst integrating peptide conjugates through thiolate coordination at the Pt(II) center.58 An interesting facet of the newly produced structure lies in its self-assembly processes in aqueous media that are under kinetic control, enabling pathway-dependent assembly sequences wherein different resultant nanostructures are elaborated in a stepwise manner. At the time of this perspective, photophysical characterization of the various aggregated structures described in this report have yet to be elaborated.

  Interested in the development of photocatalytic systems for solar energy conversion that preserve as much photon energy as possible, Wasielewski and co-workers recently investigated photoinduced singlet charge transfer in a ruthenium(II)–PDI complex (15).59 Similar to that observed in the ferrocene–PDI molecules explored by Fukuzumi,44 selective excitation of the PDI subunit in 15 results in reductive quenching of the 1PDI* state forming the Ru(III)–PDI−˙ charge-separated ion pair in less than 150 fs. The vibrationally hot ion pair exhibits fast relaxation with a time constant of 3.9 ps and eventually nearly complete charge recombination regenerating the ground state in 63 ps. The residual transient signal that persists into microseconds time scale is consistent with the 3PDI* state likely formed as a result of radical pair intersystem crossing induced by the paramagnetic Ru(III) center.
Conclusions
This contribution highlights numerous creative approaches explored to date integrating NI, NDI, and PDI chromophores with transition metal complexes. As a result, noteworthy excited state behaviour, such as lifetime extension based on the triplet reservoir effect, has been achieved. Fundamental explorations into excited state electron transfer have been accomplished where the rylene dye is used either as the electron acceptor or the selectively excited chromophore eventually leading to charge separation and in some instances, impressive charge separation lifetimes. Topologically pleasing polynuclear metallocyclic and linear structures have been synthesized, exhibiting either singlet and triplet state dominated photophysics, depending upon the nature of the covalent linkage to the metal complex or metal center. Similarly, rylene-based mononuclear complexes of Ru(II), Ir(III), and Pt(II) show promise for contributing in the general areas of light-emitting electroluminescent devices, triplet-based organic photovoltaics, and photocatalytic solar fuels production. By taking advantage of metal-coordination driven self-assembly processes in tandem with solvent programmable PDI aggregation, new opportunities have emerged for the study of large supramolecular metal–organic materials with fascinating nano-to-microscale structures. Although still in its infancy, merging metal complexes with rylene dyes represents a powerful combination of structures that will continue to make fundamental contributions ultimately paving the way for a variety of photonics-based applications.

 	Fig. 1  Ground state FTIR spectrum and time-resolved infrared difference spectra of Re(1)(CO)3Cl in THF following 400 nm pulsed excitation (90 fs fwhm). The spectral resolution for the time-resolved measurements was ∼4 cm−1 and the experimental delay times are specified. Reprinted with permission from ref. 20.	 

 	Fig. 2  Ground-state FTIR spectrum (bottom) and time-resolved step-scan FTIR difference spectra (top) of Re(1)(CO)3Cl in THF following 410 nm pulsed excitation (5–7 ns fwhm). The sample was purged with argon and pumped through a flow cell with a path length of 330 μm. The spectral resolution for the time-resolved measurements was ∼8 cm−1, and the approximate experimental delay times are indicated. Reprinted with permission from ref. 20.	 

 	Fig. 3  Energy level diagram describing the photophysical processes of Re(1)(CO)3Cl in THF at room temperature. The solid lines represent radiative transitions, and the dashed lines represent non-radiative transitions. The presented time constants (τ) are the inverse of the observed rate constants for the associated processes. Reprinted with permission from ref. 20.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 4  Absorption and photoluminescence spectra of 2 (solid black lines) and the terminal acetylene NI ligand (dash-dotted blue lines) in MTHF at room temperature. Reprinted with permission from ref. 21.
