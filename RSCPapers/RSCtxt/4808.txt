    , Accepted 24th May 2016First published on 25th May 2016AbstractRapid advances in organometallic trihalide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have positioned them to be one of the leading next generation photovoltaic technologies. However, most of the high-performance PSCs, particularly those using compact TiO2 as an electron transport layer, require a high-temperature sintering step, which is not compatible with flexible polymer-based substrates. Considering the materials of interest for PSCs and corresponding device configurations, it is technologically imperative to fabricate high-efficiency cells at low thermal budget so that they can be realized on low-temperature plastic substrates. We report on a new photonic curing technique that produces crystalline anatase-phase TiO2 films on indium tin oxide-coated glass and flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. The planar PSCs, using photonic-cured TiO2 films, exhibit PCEs as high as 15.0% and 11.2% on glass and flexible PET substrates, respectively, comparable to the device performance of PSCs incorporating furnace annealed TiO2 films.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have seen tremendous improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over the past several years, achieving PCE levels of more than 20%, comparable to those of the leading thin film photovoltaic technologies such as CIGS and CdTe.1,2 The high photovoltaic performance demonstrated by PSCs is primarily attributed to the excellent properties of perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, CH3NH3PbI3, etc.) including strong light absorption, excellent charge transport, low carrier recombination, and tunable optical bandgaps, accompanied by new material design and advances in processing techniques.3–9
To date, however, most of the high-efficiency perovskite solar cells, especially those with conventional device architecture, have used compact TiO2 as the electron transport layer (ETL), which requires a high-temperature (∼500 °C) sintering step.10,11 Hence, it is incompatible with low-temperature polymer-based plastic substrates due to the fact that they substantially deteriorate at such high processing temperatures. To address this problem, Yang et al. developed a room-temperature magnetron sputtering process to prepare highly dense TiO2 layers, and associated PSCs were shown to exhibit PCEs as high as 15.1% on plastic substrates.12 At about the same time, Qiu et al. reported a low-temperature electron beam evaporation method to prepare TiO2 layers, demonstrating 14.6% and 13.5% PCEs on glass and flexible substrates, respectively.13 More recently, Vaenas et al. demonstrated a solution-processing method that uses a temperature of 150 °C to yield anatase TiO2 films for PSCs with a PCE of 13.7%.14 Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is another approach that was used to deposit TiO2 layers, however, the device performance using ALD-deposited TiO2 is poor to date.15
Compared to these techniques, photonic curing, an intense pulsed light sintering technique, is more promising due to its significantly reduced overall processing time and its roll-to-roll (R2R) compatibility, preferred for manufacturing.16–18 Photonic curing is a low-thermal budget technique that uses high-intensity photonic pulses to treat thin film materials on a variety of substrates, including temperature-sensitive plastics (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)). Unlike conventional high-temperature furnace annealing, the photonic approach enables sintering of thin films including solar cell materials19–21 within an extremely short period of time (in the order of milliseconds), thus eliminating the damage to the underlying layers or substrates.22 In addition, its compatibility with R2R processing makes this technique very attractive for industrial scale manufacturing.
In this work, we have demonstrated the viability of the photonic curing technique in achieving high-quality sol-gel-processed TiO2 films on both indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass and PET substrates. In addition, the effect of moisture on the perovskite film growth and associated device performance has been investigated. PSCs fabricated with optimized perovskite film growth on photonic-cured TiO2 layers exhibit PCEs as high as 15.0% and 11.2% on glass and flexible PET substrates, respectively, which are comparable to those reported to date.
An illustration of the photonic curing technique in an envisioned R2R configuration is shown in Fig. 1a, where a plasma arc lamp, capable of producing extremely high power densities up to 20000 W cm−2 in milliseconds, is used to produce a broadband radiant spectrum with wavelengths ranging from 200 nm (ultraviolet) to 1400 nm (infrared). Sol–gel processed TiO2 films on glass or PET substrates are exposed to consecutive high-intensity pulses for a very short pulse duration (in the order of milliseconds). Details of processing steps are described in the Experimental section. The simulated temperature-versus-time profiles of a single photonic pulse on ITO/TiO2-coated glass and PET substrates, shown in Fig. 1b, indicate that the high intensity pulses from the flash-lamp heat the films to temperatures high enough to sinter the thin film material but not to the level of melting or decomposing the underlying substrate due to the extremely short pulse duration.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of the photonic curing technique. (b) Simulated temperature vs. time profiles for the photonic curing procedure used to sinter the TiO2 layer on glass and PET substrates: parameters used are a bank voltage of 200 V and pulse duration of 7 ms for the glass substrate, and 200 V and 2 ms for the PET substrate. 

Fig. 2a shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of an ITO/TiO2 (60 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (300 nm)/Spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm)/Ag PSC with photonic-cured TiO2 on the ITO glass substrate, showing a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.3 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.04 V, a fill-factor (FF) of 63.8%, and an overall PCE of 12.8% in the forward bias (FB) to reverse bias (RB) scanning direction and a JSC of 19.2 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.98 V, FF of 58.3%, and PCE of 11.0% in the RB-FB direction, under standard illumination (100 mW cm−2), measured in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The presence of J–V hysteresis may stem from the use of a planar device architecture or ferroelectric properties of the perovskite material.23,24 To better evaluate the performance, the stabilized current density and power output at maximum power point (∼0.78 V) of the same device were determined, demonstrating a PCE of 12.7% (Fig. 2b). The integrated JSC value of 19.2 mA cm−2 from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the same device is consistent with the value extracted from the J–V curve. In order to demonstrate the performance reproducibility, a series of PSCs were fabricated incorporating photonic-cured compact TiO2 layers, exhibiting an excellent average PCE of 12.6 ± 0.9% (Fig. 2d and Table 1). By comparison, Fig. S1a† shows the J–V curves of a typical PSC fabricated using a furnace-annealed (at 500 °C) TiO2 layer, exhibiting a JSC of 20.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.03 V, FF of 65.2%, and PCE of 13.6% in the FB-RB scan direction, and a JSC of 20.2 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.97 V, FF of 64.5%, and PCE of 12.6% in the RB-FB direction, with an average PCE of 13.1%. The PCE histogram based on 30 devices with furnace annealed TiO2 compact layers shows an average PCE of 13.3 ± 0.7% (Fig. S1b†). In addition, the PCEs of the champion devices with photonic-cured and furnace annealed TiO2 layers are 15.0 and 15.1%, respectively (Fig. S2†). These results clearly demonstrate the viability and potential of the photonic curing technique for high-efficiency PSCs.

In addition to its capability to yield high-quality films for high-performance devices, the photonic curing technique has another major advantage over the conventional furnace annealing, that is, it significantly reduced the overall processing time. By comparison, the annealing of a TiO2 layer using photonic curing (25 pulses with 7 ms of pulse duration and 500 ms of time gap between consecutive pulses) takes ∼13 s of total curing time, while the furnace annealing takes ∼1 h, meaning that photonic curing can reduce the overall curing time by more than 200-fold.
It is noteworthy that, in this study, we also took into consideration the effect of relative humidity as it plays an important role during the perovskite film growth.6,25 The device performance based on perovskite films that are annealed in air is superior to that of devices based on films annealed in a controlled environment, for example, N2 (Fig. S3†). This is due to the fact that N2-annealed perovskite films have a relatively high density of pinholes compared to air-annealed (relative humidity of ∼35%) samples (Fig. S4†). Such pinholes lead to reduction in the volume fraction of the absorber material, effectively resulting in a lower number of photogenerated charges for the N2-annealed film.26 Another significant observation is that air-annealed films exhibit higher VOC, which is most likely associated with the reduced nonradiative recombination.26 These observations are consistent with the previous reports on the effect of moisture on the perovskite film growth and device performance.27,28
In order to understand how photonic curing changes the electrical and optical properties of the TiO2 films, the crystallinity and morphology of the films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis absorption, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 3a shows the XRD spectra obtained on the as-cast, furnace annealed, and photonic-cured TiO2 films. While the as-cast film does not show the characteristic anatase peak reflection at ∼25.3°, formation of the desired anatase phase is evident for both the furnace annealed and photonic-cured films. Fig. 3b shows the absorption spectra of the same samples. The optical bandgaps using the Tauc plot (inset in Fig. 3b) of the as-cast, photonic-cured and furnace-annealed films are estimated to be 3.43, 3.46, and 3.82 eV, respectively. To provide further insight, as well as to obtain quantitative information about the film roughness, the as-cast, photonic-cured and furnace-annealed TiO2 films were analyzed by AFM measurements. Fig. 4 compares the surface morphology of the TiO2 films for various annealing treatments. While the as-cast film shows a smooth and uniform surface morphology with very small crystal sizes, both furnace annealed and photonic-cured films demonstrate large grains and relatively rougher surface morphologies, indicating an increase in crystallinity and thus conductivity. The average root-mean-square roughness value (rRMS) on a 5 × 5 μm area for the as-cast film is 0.24 nm, which gradually increases to 0.58 nm and to 1.1 nm for the furnace annealed and photonic-cured counterparts, respectively.

The excellent photovoltaic performance of the devices obtained on glass substrates motivated us to translate the photonic curing process to flexible substrates. Fig. 5a shows the J–V characteristics of the champion PSC on an ITO/PET substrate with a JSC of 16.9 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.09 V, a FF of 61.0%, and an overall PCE of 11.2%. The measured EQE spectrum of the same device is shown in Fig. 5b, yielding a JSC of 16.2 mA cm−2, which is reasonably consistent with the JSC value obtained from the J–V characteristics. In order to investigate the mechanical flexibility of the flexible devices, a stringent and repetitive bending test was carried out on flat devices using a metal cylinder with 3 mm radius of curvature. Devices retain about ∼70% of their initial PCEs after 1000 bending cycles (Fig. 5c), demonstrating their mechanical robustness. The observed slight degradation likely results from the cracking of the ITO layer after repetitive bending, abruptly increasing the sheet resistance of the ITO/PET electrode.20,29 The average PCE from flexible PSCs is 9.4 ± 0.9%, based on 10 devices, which is on a par with the highest reported PCE on flexible PSCs.

In summary, we have successfully demonstrated a roll-to-roll compatible photonic curing technique as a promising replacement of conventional furnace annealing to achieve high-quality compact TiO2 films on both glass and flexible substrates, significantly reducing the processing time and thermal budget. Devices fabricated incorporating photonic-cured TiO2 demonstrated excellent photovoltaic performance, which is comparable to that observed on furnace annealed TiO2 layers. More importantly, flexible devices exhibit a high PCE reaching to 11.2%, which is on a par with most of the reported values for state-of-the-art devices.
Experimental section
Materials and solution preparation
The TiO2 solution for the compact electron transport layer was synthesized by adding 365 μl of titanium isopropoxide into 5 ml of anhydrous isopropyl alcohol in the presence of 70 μl 1 M hydrochloric acid and stirring vigorously for 2 h, followed by filtering using a 0.2 μm pore size PTFE filter. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursors – methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead iodide (PbCl2) – were purchased from 1-Materials and Sigma Aldrich, respectively and used as received. MAI and PbCl2 were mixed in the 3:1 weight ratio and dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at a total concentration of 40%. The hole transport material, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine) 9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, Sigma Aldrich), was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) for a concentration of 90 mg ml−1 and doped with 45 μl lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution (170 mg ml−1 in acetonitrile) and 10 μl of 4-tertbutylpyridine (tBP) solution. Both LiTFSI and tBP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Device fabrication
First, ITO-coated glass (15 Ω sq−1) and PET (60 Ω sq−1, Sigma Aldrich) substrates were cleaned sequentially by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol and subsequently baked at 70 °C for 1 h. The TiO2 solution was dispensed onto UV-ozone-treated ITO-coated glass and PET substrates and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 40 seconds in air. The TiO2 films were then soft-baked at 80 °C for 10 min to drive off the residual solvent before they were either annealed at 500 °C for 30 minutes in a muffle furnace or cured using a PulseForge 3300 processing system from NovaCentrix. For the glass substrates, the TiO2 films were exposed to 25 pulses under a radiant exposure from a plasma arc lamp with a bank voltage of 200 V, a pulse duration of 7 ms, and a repetition rate of 2 Hz (corresponding to 500 ms delay between consecutive pulses). The films on PET substrates were exposed to 10 consecutive pulses with 2 ms pulse duration. Subsequently, the heated perovskite solution was spin-coated onto TiO2/ITO-coated glass and PET substrates at 2000 rpm for 50 s in a N2-filled glovebox and immediately annealed at 100 °C for 70 min in air. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s on top of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films, and the substrates were stored in a desiccator for ∼12 h for oxygen doping. Finally, 100 nm Ag was thermally deposited at 1 Å s−1 at a vacuum level of 5 × 10−6 mbar, using a shadow mask to complete the fabrication of the devices. The device area of 7.5 mm2 was calculated by using a high-resolution optical microscope.
Film and device characterization
Current–voltage (J–V) curves of the fabricated devices were recorded by scanning from the forward bias to reverse bias (1.2 V to −0.2 V) direction and vice versa, using a source meter (Keithley 2400, USA) and a solar simulator (Radiant Source Technology, 300 W, Class A) under standard illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated using a NIST-certified Newport Si reference cell. The voltage step during the scan was fixed at 35 mV with a delay time of 50 ms. EQE measurements were conducted in air using a Newport QE measurement kit under short circuit conditions. Perovskite film morphology was studied by using a Zeiss Merlin VP scanning electron microscope (SEM). The AFM measurements were carried out using a Bruker Dimension Icon operating in tapping mode. X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted using a high-resolution PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD diffractometer with a Cu-Kα source (wavelength 1.54050 Å). The UV-Vis absorption spectrum was recorded using a Varian Cary UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer.
