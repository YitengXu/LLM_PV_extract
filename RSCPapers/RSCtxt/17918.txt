    , Accepted 20th September 2022First published on 24th September 2022AbstractThe rapid transformation to renewable energy will require an equal uptake of energy storage technologies. Therefore, green hydrogen production via water electrolysis has been touted as a practical solution for large scale energy storage. To further secure an environmentally sustainable future the deployment of electric vehicles and energy generation/storage devices will need to continue. This puts a high demand on scarce resources such as expensive platinum group metals which also results in an emerging waste problem at the end of life of these technologies. However, this provides an opportunity to take advantage of a major metal containing waste stream for urban mining which could relieve the pressure on natural resources and reduce both material and energy consumption. In this review it is outlined that there is an emerging application for this waste, i.e. electrocatalyst fabrication for use in water electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. It is identified that not only are battery materials suitable, but other sources of metal waste such as mass produced materials like stainless steel and refined minerals can be repurposed. Therefore, recycling such waste streams not only relieves the stress on mining ever more scarce elements but presents an opportunity to develop cost effective catalysts for green hydrogen production.
1. Introduction
The excessive use of fossil fuels to power industry and the transport sector has resulted in the continual increase of CO2 emissions to a level of 420 ppm which according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report must be urgently addressed to reduce global warming. Therefore, energy systems based on renewable sources need to be rapidly deployed to ensure a sustainable and safer future.1 However, this requires the ability to store energy from intermittent renewable energy sources which is a significant technical challenge.2 Practical energy storage should satisfy several criteria, including high energy and power densities, excellent efficiency, economic and environmental viability which can be easily integrated with emerging green energy sources into the existing energy network. Among the many available energy storage technologies (thermal, pumped hydroelectric, compressed air energy storage, batteries, and supercapacitors) hydrogen storage has been identified as one of the most sustainable and promising approaches for large scale seasonal storage of renewable electricity.2–6
Electrochemical water splitting provides a green route for hydrogen production if the process is powered by renewable energy. It involves two half-reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) where H2 is produced at the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) where O2 is produced at the anode. The HER but more so the OER include several electron transfer steps that result in sluggish reaction kinetics and high overpotentials.5 In this regard, the catalysts' role is to overcome kinetic barriers and minimize the overpotentials for both the OER and HER to enhance overall water splitting for the efficient production of H2 and O2.6,7 The necessity for hydrogen is clear but the production of oxygen is also beneficial where several applications are now emerging including wastewater treatment and use in aquaculture.8 Therefore, electrocatalysts are a critical component which impact the overall efficiency and cost of an electrolyser. Electrocatalysts based on noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt and Ir) or platinum group metals (PGMs) are efficient water splitting electrocatalysts that are commercially available in proton exchange membrane (PEM) based electrolysers.5 However, the limited sources of these noble metals, their high market price and concern about their long-term stability restricts the mass production of electrolysers that is urgently required. The oxides/hydroxides based on transition metals (e.g., Ni, Co, Fe and Mn) are efficient electrocatalysts for the OER while the chalcogenides and phosphides of these metals are suitable for the HER,9–19 which operate under alkaline conditions and would ultimately be more cost effective than commercially employed PEM catalysts. Hence, there have been significant research efforts in developing alkaline water electrolysers which can use membrane technology in an analogous fashion to PEM technology. Although Ni, Co and Mn elements are earth-abundant, their price has increased rapidly due to increasing demand for manufacturing electronic and energy storage materials (e.g., batteries and supercapacitors).20,21 Therefore, there is an emerging interest to recycle these metals from waste resources and use them for the synthesis of catalyst materials for electrochemical water splitting which is the main focus of this review.10,11
This recycling approach has the potential to lower the cost of electrocatalysts and reduce the energy consumption and environmental footprint in comparison to primary sources that requires mining, refining, purification and conversion to the appropriate formulation required for either the HER or OER. Often specific modifications are required which necessitates interface engineering to further improve the catalyst’ performance22–26 thereby adding additional steps to the process. In many cases, which will be discussed in this review, the recovered materials from batteries can be used directly for water splitting without any treatment, or if required, the modification steps are straightforward and can be carried out under mild conditions. Even though electronic and energy storage devices contain valuable metals, the majority of end-of-life devices still enter landfill. This is also problematic given the well documented environmental contamination issues of landfill27 which is not discussed here. However, recycling metal containing electronic waste opens up the possibility of addressing these environmental issues while also lowering the production cost of functional materials in the future with an established recycling industry.28–32 Another source of electrocatalytically active materials that has not been explored in any great depth is repurposing waste from mass production processes such as mining and steel manufacturing. These industries produce significant quantities of off-cuts and tailings that are rich in transition metals that can in principle be repurposed by either chemical and/or electrochemical approaches to generate active electrocatalysts for water splitting.
At present there is rapid endangerment of PGMs and indeed many other transition metals (see Fig. 1 showing the periodic table's endangered elements33) due to scarcity arising from either a lack of natural abundance, increased use or geopolitical factors. Therefore, the need to recover and reuse metals from batteries, fuel cells, electronic waste and utilising mass-produced materials such as stainless steel, iron ore and metallic electronic waste is becoming highly important. In this review, we focus on the recovery of materials from waste and sources that can be repurposed as functional electrocatalysts with an emphasis on electrochemical water splitting.

2. Battery recycling
Batteries are extensively used in everyday products (e.g. power tools, toys, remote controls, clocks, etc.), electronic devices (e.g. laptops, mobile phones, etc.) and electric vehicles that include both primary and secondary batteries. Primary cells, such as primary alkaline batteries are single-use, while secondary batteries are rechargeable which include lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and Ni-based batteries (such as Ni–Cd and Ni-metal hydride). The major component of these batteries (>50%) are metals (i.e., Fe, Co, Mn, Zn and Cu) that are valuable secondary resources of these increasingly scarce elements. Battery recycling has been studied extensively and is now commercially undertaken in several countries. Several review articles have been published detailing a variety of methods that have been employed to recycle battery components as well as outlining technoeconomic factors to support the validity of this emerging industry. For readers interested in methods of battery recycling they are directed to these sources.34–40 However, the recycling aspect is not the focus of this review or the re-use of materials as battery electrodes but rather on using these recovered materials as electrocatalysts for green hydrogen production.
2.1 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
Since the discovery of LIBs in the 1990s they have become ubiquitous and are found in small portable devices up to electric vehicles (EVs)41 while recently grid level storage has been demonstrated.42 There has also been a rapid development of home storage applications which are now commercially viable.43 With increasing deployment of technology based on LIBs there will be a significant surge of end of life batteries which contain valuable and useful nanomaterials that will require recycling not only from an economic viewpoint but also for safety and environmental reasons.
In a typical LIB, the cathode active material is made of intercalation materials which host and release lithium ions during charge and discharge cycles.44 Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) was the first and is still the most widely used cathode material.45 Transition metal oxides are generally the first choice for cathode materials due to their high specific capacity, low discharge at rest and better overall life cycles. Various other types of cathode materials with different crystal structures have been developed and reported including layer structured lithium nickel oxide (LNO), nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium cobalt phosphate (LCP), lithium iron fluorosulfate (LFSF), lithium titanium sulfide (LTS), lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO2), lithium manganese oxide (LMO), spinel structured LiMn2O4 and nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA).43,46 Some of these are commercially available while others are at still at the research laboratory phase. The anode consists of a material that should avoid the formation of lithium dendrites which may result in short circuiting and therefore carbon is used commercially. It is still the first choice due to good electrical conductivity, high performance and abundancy. Various types of LIBs have been developed to meet the high demand of battery-powered devices while also considering cost and efficiency constraints as well as practical viability. Therefore, there have been many developments by using and combining different types of cathodes, anodes, electrolytes, and separators.47,48 As a result, the current market consists of various types of lithium-ion batteries used in a variety of commercial and domestic applications which can be problematic for mass recycling efforts and is an area which needs further attention.
In particular, the production of LIBs has been on the rise since 2000 and based on this usage pattern, the global waste coming from only LIBs is estimated to be around 200–500 million tons (MT) of Li and Co metals where Australia in particular accounts for up to 3340 tons per year of spent LIB waste.49 With the rising production and usage of LIBs, the world must deal with these spent batteries and the waste it creates as there are serious environmental consequences if the waste is not handled efficiently. If flammable lithium batteries are not discharged completely, the lithium material captured in the anode electrode can be released to landfill and cause significant environmental hazards. Moreover, the cost of transition metals (Li, Co, Ni and Mn) will be subject to price rises with increasing usage. Therefore spent LIBs that contain these expensive materials can be recycled, regenerated and reused to increase the economic feasibility of other processes50 and open up new economic opportunities in recycling and advanced manufacturing.
As mentioned previously there have been several reports on efficient recycling techniques and advancements in recovering valuable metals from spent LIBs and the recovery procedures include but are not limited to physical recovery techniques and chemical methods, mechanical treatment, pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, electrochemical and bio-metallurgy.30,40,51–55 Given the large diversity of battery chemistries in the market the recycling method varies depending on the amount and type of metal recovered from spent batteries,56 and for LIBs in particular the recycling process is challenging.57 A possible solution to help alleviate some of the difficult economic factors associated with recycling is to use these recovered materials in emerging industries. Therefore, there is increasing interest amongst researchers to use the recovered materials in applications other than re-use in LIBs. In particular, it is now considered possible to re-use electrode materials in other energy related applications such as new battery technologies (metal-air), electrochemical water splitting and supercapacitors.58 In the next section, we focus on the generation of effective novel electrocatalysts recovered from spent LIBs mainly for use as catalysts for water electrolysis.
2.2 Using recovered LIB materials as electrocatalysts for water splitting
Nanomaterials can be recovered from the cathode and anode materials of spent LIBs and potentially used to replace expensive metals (Ir and Ru oxides) for the OER to facilitate electrochemical water splitting. In particular, transition metal oxides have been reported as highly efficient electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline media.59,60 An important point to consider when determining if repurposing battery materials is good for such an application is benchmarking against existing water splitting electrocatalysts. To benchmark materials for the OER, one of the primary figures of merit is the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 per geometric area. This is approximately the current density expected for a 10% efficient solar-to-fuels conversion device.61 In more recent publications catalysts are being benchmarked at much higher current densities62 of >500 mA cm−2 for periods of electrolysis of up to days63 rather than hours to demonstrate commercial viability and these conditions should also be considered when reporting any new catalyst.
Natarajan et al.64 reported the electrocatalytic activity of spinel structured manganese cobalt oxide, lithium cobalt oxide and lithium manganese oxides regenerated from spent batteries for the OER in alkaline media. In the first step, LIBs were subjected to physical dismantling, chemical leaching of the active components with acetic acid followed by precipitation with ammonium carbonate. In the second step, MnCo2O4 was newly synthesized by thermal treatment at 650 °C. To characterize the OER performance, linear sweep voltammograms are undertaken where a typical example is shown in Fig. 2a which was recorded at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH. The large increase in current is due to the evolution of oxygen and ideally should occur as close as possible to the theoretical value of 1.23 V for the most energetically efficient water splitting. As mentioned previously, determining the potential at which a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is passed is an important benchmark. However, it should be noted that there is significant variation in the literature for the choice of electrolyte which will impact the current densities that can be achieved. The most common electrolyte for alkaline water electrolysis is KOH using a concentration of either 0.1 or 1.0 M. There are also other factors that influence performance such as the support electrode, electrode fabrication techniques and cell configuration which are discussed in more detail in the outlook section. Fig. 2a shows the OER data for recovered microspheres of spinel MnCo2O4, LiCoO2, LixMnOx+1 compared to commercial nanomaterials such as c-Co3O4, c-MnO2 and c-RuO2, demonstrating the promise of this approach in recovering functional materials. Promisingly, the performance of spinel MnCo2O4 is comparable to commercial RuO2 and exhibited an overpotential of only 400 mV at 10 mA cm−2, with the advantage of being significantly less expensive than RuO2.

A further method for benchmarking OER electrocatalysts is to present Tafel plots which provide information on the electron transfer kinetics for the reaction as well as providing some mechanistic insight into the rate determining step.65Fig. 2b shows the Tafel plots for the same materials presented in Fig. 2a which indicates that the recovered MnCo2O4 material has a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec−1 which is comparable to commercial c-RuO2 with a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec−1 indicating that the kinetics of electron transfer and mechanism is very similar for both materials. Fig. 2c is a typical SEM image of the recovered MnCo2O4 which shows sub-micron sized spherical particles with a porous morphology which is advantageous for increasing the surface area and allowing access to active sites within the material.
Garcia et al.66 developed a new OER anode for water splitting using the cathode material from a spent LIB containing lithium cobalt oxide. After physically dismantling the spent LIB, the cathode was heated to obtain the active material (lithium cobalt oxide) and carbon black. The electrochemical measurements were performed at electrodes made from mixing different amounts of regenerated active material from the LIB with graphite. Furthermore, a modified recycled electrode containing both LiCoO2 and Co3O4 exhibited OER currents of up to 1010 mA cm−2, indicating that blending recovered materials with a well-known catalyst such as Co3O4 ref. 67 for the OER is an additional strategy that can improve the sluggish OER and could minimise the use of expensive catalyst materials.
Chen et al.68 compared the electrocatalytic activity of recycled lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) from spent LIBs after a different number of charge/discharge cycles. The LCO was recovered from a matrix of super P, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and solvent after a series of physical and chemical treatments. The effect of the number of cycles on the structural change and hence, the corresponding oxygen evolution activity were studied in 0.1 M KOH. Their results showed that the number of cycles that had been undertaken in the battery had a direct positive effect on the electrocatalytic activity. The battery that had been cycled 500 times before recovery of the active material showed superior electrocatalytic activity for the OER in terms of current density when compared to the pristine material. This also resulted in a decrease in the Tafel slope from 72 to 67 mV dec−1 for the pristine and cycled material, respectively, indicating improved electron transfer kinetics. It was also reported that there was a change in the morphology of the material after 500 cycles showing evidence of particle cracking and roughening which may explain the increased activity due to higher surface area and more readily accessible active sites. These results give confidence that recovered metals from such spent batteries can have comparable performance to commercially available materials for the OER in alkaline medium. The performance of these materials for the OER is illustrated in Fig. 3 where comparisons to other catalysts from different waste streams as well as commercial catalysts are outlined.

2.3 Recycling primary batteries
Alkaline and zinc–carbon (Zn–C) batteries are examples of primary batteries that are still in high demand due to their use in low power household and commercial applications such as watches, clocks, portable equipment, cameras and remote controls.69 Zn–C alkaline batteries consist of a negative zinc electrode and a manganese oxide positive electrode in a KOH electrolyte. These low power batteries are single-use and predominantly discarded at end of life, where they are either incinerated or sent to landfill instead of recovered and recycled due to the cost associated with recycling technologies.70 Therefore providing an alternative use of these materials such as catalyst fabrication for use in water electrolysis may be economically more palatable. As is the case with LIBs, they contain materials which are hazardous for the environment and can have negative health effects.71,72 Unfortunately, many countries including the United States of America (excluding the state of California), China and Iran consider alkaline zinc–carbon batteries as non-hazardous waste and usually discard them in municipal waste after use.73,74 Encouragingly, there is progress in this area and many countries and regions have their own policies to govern and regulate the recycling of waste portable batteries. For example, the European Portable Battery Association (EPBA) sets different collection targets each year and encourages EU states to follow directives and achieve a set number of recycled batteries.75
To recover metals from waste primary batteries, several approaches have been studied to produce a cost-effective and energy-friendly recycling method suitable for commercialization.76 Most of the approaches are based on hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical techniques77,78 with some reports on reusing the recovered materials in further energy and electrochemical related applications. A typical waste alkaline battery comprises of almost 28% Mn.79 Manganese oxide (MnO2) can in principle be recovered and utilized as an anode catalyst for the OER during water splitting or as a binder free cathode electrode for lithium secondary batteries.80–82 In this section, we review studies that have recovered and regenerated metals from spent primary cells and reused them for water splitting and energy storage applications.
2.4 Reusing recovered materials from primary batteries for electrochemical water splitting and supercapacitor applications
MnO2 catalysts synthesized from spent primary batteries are interesting materials for water splitting and are an ideal candidate due to their high metal content.80 The applicability of manganese oxides for the OER has been well documented by previous studies.83 Significant advantages include low toxicity and good corrosion resistance, however improvements in activity are still required. Farzana et al.84 demonstrated a sustainable pathway to derive manganese oxide from a spent Zn–C cell and employed it as a catalyst for the OER under alkaline conditions. The recovered manganese oxide in the form of Mn3O4 was immobilized on a stainless steel (SS) substrate which exhibited an onset potential of 1.51 V vs. RHE and a low overpotential of 360 mV for the OER in 0.1 M KOH (Fig. 3). The low impedance that was recorded for this electrode and a low Tafel slope value of 64 mV dec−1 indicated favourable electron transfer kinetics which resulted in a performance that was found to be comparable with commercial MnO2 nanomaterials. It is also competitive with a recent chemically synthesized δ-MnO2 nanosheet arrays catalyst on a Ni foam (NiF) (NS–MnO2) electrode that exhibited an overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm−2.17 This is promising given that the Mn3O4 material recovered from the battery was immobilized on a low surface area support electrode. The pyrolysis approach resulted in the formation of pure Mn3O4 powder in the form of nanoparticles without any trace of carbon or Zn impurities that may have compromised activity. This form of manganese oxide is also interesting given the many different crystallographic polymorphs that are possible for this material85 that are more studied than spinel Mn3O4 for the OER. This approach not only eradicates the environmental concerns of sending these types of batteries to landfill but also indicates a new way to synthesize Mn oxide-based electrocatalysts.
Although the main focus of this review is employing recycled materials for water splitting, it is worth noting that recovered manganese oxides can have a wider range of applications from new battery technologies to supercapacitors owing to their higher energy density and efficient energy storage. Farzana et al.86 synthesised nanoparticles of manganese oxide from a spent Zn–C battery which were then used for supercapacitor applications. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis for the synthesised Mn3O4 nanoparticles in 0.6 M KOH electrolyte solution demonstrated an excellent capacitive performance of up to 125 F g−1. Another study by Hassan et al.87 reported utilising a spent Zn–C battery for the synthesis of carbon free active zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) on a silicon substrate and applying it in supercapacitor applications. The electrochemical activity of the synthesized NPs was analysed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry in a 0.6 M KOH electrolyte solution which exhibited capacitive and faradaic processes to give a specific capacity of 547 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1. The production of pure nanoparticles in the form of a uniformly distributed ultra-thin layer on a porous silicon substrate allowed it to exhibit better specific capacitance than ZnO materials synthesized from other methods, such as sol–gel or electrochemical deposition methods. Meng et al.88 developed a process for recycling manganese oxide from spent alkaline batteries for use as an air electrode with high catalytic activity for zinc-air batteries. The developed process was based on leaching the cathode material in 0.5 M HCl solution and annealing it in air at 250 °C which resulted in the formation of a highly active material for both the OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with high surface area and porosity with results comparable to commercial catalysts such as Pt/C + iridium oxide.
Therefore, it can be summarised that the re-use of battery materials is gaining significant traction due to increasing demand in not only the electronics and transport sectors but also their use in domestic and large-scale energy storage applications. Although recycling is largely limited to re-use as battery materials there is a significant opportunity to re-use the electrode materials as water splitting electrocatalysts as outlined in this review. However, it is important to consider that the effect of battery age, number of cycles, cycling rate (i.e. battery history) will have a significant impact on electrocatalytic performance if used directly without further modification. The existence of impurities either from binding materials or intercalated ions in the metal oxide materials will also need to be considered given the sensitivity of electrocatalytic reactions to the presence of dopants and/or impurities.89
In addition, it should be noted that supercapacitor use is also growing dramatically for use in electronics with high power requirements such as memory backup, electric vehicles, telecommunications and power system protection. Although the market is still small in comparison to Li ion batteries it is anticipated that sales will grow with an annual increase of about 24%, from 240 million at present to 2 billion USD by 2026.90 A supercapacitor reaches its end-of-life (EOL) when its nominal capacitance is decreased by 20% and the initial equivalent series resistance is increased by 100%. Although it may not be suitable for its original application it may have further use for lower power applications as discussed recently by Saha et al.91 However even supercapacitors will ultimately need to be recycled, in particular if they are based on pseuodcapacitive or hybrid systems that use faradaic reactions as part of the charge storage process. These types of supercapacitors employ a wide range of metal oxides such as MnO2, RuO2, CuO, LiCoO2, Ni(OH)2 ref. 92,93 which could in principle be recovered for use as water splitting electrocatalysts.
3. Utilizing repurposed mass-produced materials as electrocatalysts
Materials such as stainless steel and iron ore tailings that are mass produced or processed on very large scales often have significant waste. Promisingly, these materials contain electrocatalytically active metals that in principle could be harnessed for various reactions including the OER and HER to achieve cost effective electrochemical water splitting. Indeed the steel industry is now recognising that the reuse and recycling of by-products is important for the future of the sector which is gaining traction in Europe in pursuing a circular economy.94 In this section, recent developments on the use of stainless steel and iron ore have been detailed. In particular, the affecting parameters and accompanying results for the reactions have been outlined.
3.1 Modification of stainless steel into water splitting electrocatalysts
Stainless steel containing high contents of nickel, iron and chromium has gained significant attention as a potential electrocatalyst for the OER. SS316L in particular, with a Ni content of 10–14%, has been reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER owing to the presence of both Fe and Ni in the material which is an established combination for effective OER catalysis.95,96 Moreover this grade of steel demonstrates even better catalytic activity than alloy steel ‘Ni42’ when appropriately treated even though the latter has a much higher content of Ni,97 when compared to SS316L. The following section details the various approaches in conditioning the surface of stainless steel to achieve good water splitting performance.
The direct use of stainless steel as the active material rather than only a current collector is evident in various studies and considered an exciting development in utilising abundant materials directly as an active OER electrocatalyst. Colli et al. reported the use of stainless steel SS316L as a highly stable anode material for alkaline water electrolysis with an overpotential of 550 mV when operated at high current densities of 1 A cm−2 at 75 °C in a 2 electrode configuration in concentrated KOH (using RANEY® as a cathode for the HER).15 The long term stability of the electrolysis cell was also demonstrated by sustained electrolysis at 300 mA cm−2 for 30 days. Moreover, Yu et al. directly used SS316L as a highly efficient anode material to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 370 mV overpotential and a small Tafel slope value of 30 mV dec−1.98 Stainless steel mostly consists of Fe but an iron only electrode as a control only exhibited a very low current density of 8 mA cm−2, indicating the requirement for Ni to be present in the surface layer. During the OER, the iron electrode was subjected to corrosion, while the SS was corrosion resistant due to the presence of nickel and chromium.
Moureaux et al.99 used an activation process to enhance the performance of stainless steel SS316L for the OER which demonstrated good long term stability. The activation was based on slow surface modification during the OER (in situ) or by varying the applied potential steps (ex situ) resulting in a stable electrocatalyst that was run continuously for more than 300 hours at current densities of >100 mA cm−2 in 5 M alkaline electrolyte. They also explored the activation procedure in both KOH and LiOH electrolytes and found that KOH was the preferable electrolyte due to Li+ species being rather-irreversibly inserted in the NiOx layer, in contrast to K+ ions. This highlights the influence that counter ion insertion into electrocatalytic surface oxide layers has on the OER and may be applicable to many other metal oxide systems. This type of approach was also adopted by Zhang et al.100 where they activated stainless steel using a cathodisation approach and then synthesized an electrocatalyst using SS mesh achieving a low overpotential of 275 mV to give a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER. Zhang et al. also developed an interconnected nanosheet of nickel iron on a stainless steel mesh (SSNNi) without using any binder which was found to be highly active for the OER.101 It was demonstrated that using both NH4HCO3 and nickel salt, a well uniformed 3D nanosheet was formed containing closely packed nickel and iron crystals that are active for the OER. SSNNi showed a low overpotential of 230 mV at a slightly higher current density than normally reported of 20 mA cm−2 with a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec−1 which was smaller compared to commercial RuO2 (62 mV dec−1). Wu et al.102 employed a cathodic plasma bombardment technique to modify the surface of stainless steel 304 which resulted in an overpotential of 323 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH. The comparative electrochemical data for the OER is outlined in Fig. 3. It is apparent that the electrochemical performance of the stainless-steel electrodes is superior to the materials recovered from batteries. This is most likely due to the composition of the materials where the Fe/Ni combination in steel is more applicable to the OER than the Mn and Co based oxide materials recovered from batteries which has been well documented for the OER under alkaline conditions at chemically synthesized materials.103–106
Due to this composition difference, modified stainless steels have been investigated for the other half of the water splitting reaction, namely the HER. In fact, these materials have also been investigated as bifunctional catalysts that are active for both HER and OER and can therefore be used for overall water splitting. Ekspong et al. synthesized such a nanostructured bifunctional catalyst from a stainless steel mesh (SSM) SS316L with improved performance by activating and modifying the nickel iron surface to achieve the optimum composition for the OER.107 After sonicating the SSM316L in various solvents to clean the surface, it was anodized in a 7.5 M NaOH solution to form nanosheets of nickel/iron oxide (Fig. 4a). It was then subjected to reduction by heating for 30 min at 250 °C followed by heating at 60 min for 450 °C to fabricate a cathode material for the HER (Fig. 4b) which resulted in the formation of nanoparticles on the surface. It was found that the treated steel was better than IrO2 for the OER (Fig. 4d) but could not reach the performance level of commercial Pt/C for the HER (Fig. 4c). However, even though the HER was inferior to commercial materials, this approach could be significant to fully utilise the electrocatalyst in the large-scale manufacturing of water electrolysers, where cost constraints will be a significant consideration.

A further development in bifunctional catalyst synthesis was reported by Sultana et al. who demonstrated the successful transformation of SS316 into an active electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.108 They converted AISI316 stainless steel into a bifunctional electrocatalyst by electrochemical modification using repetitive potential cycling in 6 M NaOH at room temperature followed by a galvanic replacement approach to incorporate traces of gold into the surface layer which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER where an overpotential of 264 mV was required to pass 10 mA cm−2 with a low Tafel slope value of 29 mV dec−1 which outperformed commercial RuO2. Moreover, the electrochemical analyses (CV and LSV) combined with material characterization analyses (SEM and TEM imaging, and XPS) showed that Ni/Fe oxides and gold were, indeed, responsible for both the OER and HER activity under commercially relevant conditions of 6 M alkaline electrolyte. Promisingly for the HER, the modified stainless steel electrode outperformed Pt/C at high current densities >100 mA cm−2. This study opens a pathway to synthesising bifunctional electrocatalysts which are tolerant to high current density conditions suitable for commercial water electrolysers. The HER activity of these materials and from various other sources under mostly alkaline conditions are outlined in Fig. 5. It can be seen that although some of the repurposed materials perform better compared to individual metal catalysts such as Co,109 Fe110 and Ni111 there is still progress to be made to be as competitive as materials such as chemically synthesized Ni2P,112 Ni3P4 ref. 113 or commercial Pt (alkaline electrolyte114 acidic electrolyte115) when comparing catalysts with the benchmark of the overpotential required to pass 10 mA cm−2.

3.2 Modification of natural minerals into water splitting electrocatalysts
Another material that contains Fe and Ni components suitable for potential use in water splitting electrocatalysis are natural ores. Taking advantage of this synergetic effect of iron and nickel, Sayeed et al.116 used a ball milled iron ore sample to reduce the particle size and then modified it with uniformly distributed Ni(OH)2 on the surface of the iron ore particles to make a stable electrocatalyst for the OER under alkaline conditions. It was found that the outer layer of Ni(OH)2 was converted into the highly active β-NiOOH form but required the iron ore core for best performance. The catalyst was characterized after the OER which indicated a uniform distribution of Fe, Ni and O within the catalyst and lattice fringes in the TEM indicating the presence of β-NiOOH and β-Ni(OH)2 while further analysis revealed the presence of Fe2O3, indicating the formation of multiple active sites. This material was able to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 280 mV with a Tafel slope of 72 mV dec−1 and maintained its activity for extended periods of electrolysis (20 h) under alkaline conditions. In order to synthesise a bifunctional catalyst for commercial water electrolysis, Sayeed et al.117 further explored a different ore composition with a higher Ni content that also consisted of metal sulfide phases such as pentlandite ((Fe, Ni)9S8), thereby avoiding the need for any surface modification. Here it was found that the material was an active electrocatalyst for both the HER and OER which could open up new investigations into ore deposits which are naturally abundant for sustainable hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting. Moreover, the metal sulfide species at the surface was the active component for the HER while the Fe/Ni oxide species was the active site for the OER. This material was able to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 270 mV with a Tafel slope of 67 mV dec−1 for the OER under alkaline conditions which is better than the previous example of iron ore modified with an outer shell of Ni(OH)2. The HER data indicated that high current densities of 100 mA cm−2 could be achieved at −0.45 V with a Tafel slope of 128 mV dec−1, indicative of water reduction being the rate determining step.65 Analysis of the catalyst layer revealed the presence of dense particles consisting of Fe, Ni, O and S species with some concentrated regions containing Fe, Ni and S confirmed to be FeNiS crystalline phases by TEM (Fig. 6a and b). Interestingly after the OER, the porosity of the material increased substantially as well as the crystallinity (Fig. 6c and d). Promisingly, for both the OER and HER stability at high current densities of 100 mA cm−2 was demonstrated (Fig. 6e).

Konkena et al.118 demonstrated that the synthetic version of the natural ore pentlandite with a defined composition of Fe4.5Ni4.5S8 is active for the HER under acidic conditions with an overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm−2. In addition, this decreased to 190 mV after 96 h of electrolysis due to surface sulfur depletion, which changes the electronic structure of the catalytically active nickel–iron centres. This indicates that ores/synthetic versions of this type are not only suitable for alkaline water electrolysis but could have applications for proton exchange membrane water splitting. Recently Hatem et al.119 also chemically synthesized pentlandite-like FexNi9−xS8 (x = 0–9) nanoparticles with distinct Fe:Ni ratios using a mechanochemical method. The OER performance was optimized through tailoring the surface properties resulting in an overpotential of 354 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for the OER with a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec−1. This shows that natural iron ores can demonstrate comparable OER activity to chemically synthesized materials of the same type and indicates that taking advantage of abundant naturally occurring ores is of potential benefit.
Rather than using a natural material that contains active species for water splitting, Mei et al.120 demonstrated that the in situ growth of three types of transition metal nanoparticles (Ni, Co and Fe) on readily abundant and environmentally friendly feldspar minerals (albite and microcline) resulted in an electrocatalyst that was active for the OER. Out of the three metals used, the Co-modified microcline named as C-KASO showed the best performance with an overpotential of 330 mV (at a current density of 10 mA cm−2) which was stable for 70 hours.
4. Recycling other types of metal containing waste
4.1 Recycling electronic waste
From previous sections, it is evident that the development of electrocatalysts from sources other than pristine transition metals is a promising approach and gaining much-needed attention in the field of water splitting. With rapid technological advancements, electronic waste is an emerging problem with a rapid increase in electronic devices, printed circuit boards (PCBs) and electric cable wires. In almost every type of electronic waste, valuable metals are present which could be recycled, recovered and re-used in other applications such as water electrolysis. Although there is a rising trend in the recycling and recovering fields,121–123 a lot of work is still needed to address the current alarming situation of electronic waste around the world. In a recent review, Karthik et al.27 summarized the potential utilisation of this hazardous waste in the form of electrocatalysts for water splitting reactions and is based on an elemental analysis of electronic waste and the different techniques which have been used to recover the endangered elements from various waste streams. This analysis is beneficial to identify what species could in principle be recovered and then used as an anode or cathode in water splitting reactions and provides a vision for researchers working in the field of waste recovery. The following section focuses on recent examples where electronic waste has been practically used in some form for water splitting reactions.
Baber and co-workers investigated the use of copper wires from waste electronics as a catalyst support material for the OER.124 They successfully converted a waste electrical wire comprised of copper using a chemical oxidation process followed by electrodeposition of an active NiFe layer which resulted in the formation of a core–shell nano-NiFe LDH/Cu(OH)2/Cu catalyst. This material exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 275 mV to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm−2. The high efficiency was due to excellent charge transfer and large surface area due to the formation of Cu(OH)2 nanowires on the Cu surface, demonstrating the potential use of waste Cu wires as a low cost current collector for water electrolysis. In addition, Jothi et al.125 reported a catalyst based on nickel cobalt phosphide grown directly on a recycled copper wire (Fig. 7a). The material was highly active for both the HER and OER as well as overall water splitting (Fig. 7b). During the OER the catalyst formed oxy/hydroxy derivatives of NiCoP such as NixCoyOOH which was identified as the active component for the OER. This bifunctional catalyst required an overpotential of only 220 mV (OER – Fig. 7c) and 178 mV (HER – Fig. 7d) in an alkaline medium. The transfer of charge between the catalyst and the highly conducting recycled copper wire and high surface area of the catalyst was responsible for such good activity. For materials of this type the OER performance was superior to commercial RuO2 but was inferior to commercial Pt/C for the HER which is consistent with many transition metal-based catalysts.

There have not been many reports of electrocatalyst development from electronic waste and therefore it is open to much more exploration given the variety of active species present within numerous electronic waste streams. For completeness it is worth mentioning, however, that there are some reports on reusing carbon from waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) for supercapacitor applications. Hossain et al.126 reported the fabrication of activated carbon with a high surface area and capacitance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies revealed that the synthesized activated carbon was highly conductive, even though no external conductive material was used during the fabrication process, where it was found that various functional groups were present on the activated carbon in the form of oxygen and nitrogen. Rajagopal et al.127 also reported the synthesis of activated carbon from waste printed circuit boards for supercapacitor applications which exhibited a specific capacitance of up to 220 Fg−1 with a high retention value after many cycles. The waste PCBs were subjected to a pyrolysis process at 800 °C to convert it into a residue followed by a separation process where activated carbon was obtained by physical activation at 850 °C for further use.
A recent japanese study128 considered recycling various components of not only electric vehicles but also standard-size conventional vehicles, small-size conventional vehicles, mini-size conventional vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. The parts considered were not only the Li ion battery but also audio and navigation systems, controllers, next-generation vehicle-specific parts, and other parts such as O2 sensors, heating wires in rear windows and printed wiring boards. It was indicated in this study that the precious metal content (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ag and Au) in these various parts of the vehicle is significant across all vehicle types and varied between 0.2 to 6.0 g per unit. Therefore, this indicates that consideration should also be given to recycling additional electrical components other than batteries in the future. To summarise, Table 1 outlines OER and HER performance data for recovered and repurposed materials discussed in this review.

4.2 Recycling platinum group metals from spent fuel cells
With the increasing development of clean hydrogen production, fuel cells that use this hydrogen to generate clean energy or for use in heavy transport are gaining even more attention. The expensive platinum-group-metals (PGMs) are the key metals used in fuel cells and considered a determinative factor in the commercialisation and mass rollout of the technology.129 However, with the increased usage of pristine PGMs, the cost of fuel cells and the prospect of scaling up the technology becomes challenging. Alternatives to PGMs for fuel cell applications have also not reached commercial fruition. Therefore, recycling and using scarce and expensive precious PGMs from end-of-life fuel cells may be required leading to a more sustainable technology. This is not critical to address in the short term, however with deeper penetration of fuel cell vehicles in the market in the long term, recycling Pt to satisfy demand will become important.130 Several groups have investigated this emerging area of research, however, in this review we focus on recycling and reutilising spent catalysts from fuel cells for electrocatalytic reactions or only the recovery of pure PGMs that in principle can then be used in PEM electrolysers. Sharma et al.131 demonstrated a highly desirable closed loop economy to synthesise a platinum on carbon (Pt/C) electrocatalyst from the spent electrode of a waste polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). In their work, nanoparticles of platinum from the gas diffusion layer were recovered through electrochemical dissolution by a polyol method with a high efficiency of more than 90% to form (NH4)2PtCl6. The high efficiency of this recycling process could be suitable for large scale applications. Sharma et al.132 also investigated recycling Pt by employing electrochemical dissolution through a potentiodynamic process. The Pt dissolution rate increased with an increase in HCl concentration. Greater dissolution (more than 90%) was achieved after 50 potential cycles in 1 M HCl compared with 0.1 M HCl which required 250 cycles to achieve the same dissolution percentage. However, recycling the spent membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is challenging where the imperative is to delaminate the assembly prior to Pt dissolution. If this step is not performed there is a possibility of losing the electronic connection required for a potentiodynamic dissolution process. Therefore, there is still room to address such issues and to optimise and develop recycling techniques. Koper et al.133 also showed that Pt nanoparticles could be recovered from spent fuel cell catalysts under mild conditions at room temperature in 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.1 M HCl by electrochemical potential cycling between 0.5–1.1 V where dissolution rates as high as 22.5 mg cm−2 per cycle could be achieved. This ensured a short dissolution timescale of 3–5 h at a Pt loading of 0.35 mg cm−2 on carbon support particles. In addition, the carbon support was preserved with minimal corrosion which would enable its use in other applications. To minimise environmental effects, Pt nanoparticles have also been recovered in acid free electrolytes.134 This process involves potentiodynamic dissolution along with potentiostatic electrodeposition and avoids the need for concentrated complexing species in solution such Cl− ions. This continuous removal of Pt ions significantly promotes the overall reaction kinetics, and an increase in dissolution rate by a factor of two or more than observed previously in non-complexing electrolytes.
Recycling membrane electrode assemblies for the recovery of Pt has also been identified as being important for alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells.135 Given that the MEA containing expensive metals such as Pt and Ir is also an integral part of PEM electrolysers, recycling has also been identified as being necessary to meet the projected capacity demands for electrolysers before 2050.136 There are many future energy roadmaps based on hydrogen which detail the construction of hydrogen generation facilities at the GW scale within the next 10 years.137 The European Union has projected up to 40 GW of stationary electrolyser capacity by 2030138 which will be difficult to meet given that the current production of iridium and platinum for PEM electrolysers could only support an estimated 3–7.5 GW annual manufacturing capacity.139 In addition the stack life of an electrolyser is around 7–10 years,136 therefore recovering the PGMs from the MEA will be critical in the future when hydrogen production plants at the GW scale are being considered. Carmo et al.140 have recently outlined a process for making catalyst coated membranes for easy recovery of both Pt and Ir separately from PEM electrolysers of up to 97% as shown in Fig. 8A. Importantly the Nafion membrane can also be recovered and reused. New MEAs were assembled for use in water electrolysers and comparable performance was achieved using the recycled components compared to the original MEAs (Fig. 8B). Although the active area was only 25 cm2 it shows a promising approach for recycling this critical part of the cell when active areas of up to >1000 cm2 in the stack layer will be required to reach the scale required for large scale hydrogen production.

All the electrochemical characterizations were performed at 80 °C, ambient pressure, and using a water flow of 50 mL min−1. This figure has been adapted and reproduced from ref. 140 with permission from Elsevier, copyright, 2019. 
A recent review has also outlined the importance and emerging relevance of not only recycling PEM fuel cells but also solid oxide fuel cells that contain yttria-stabilised zirconia as the anode which has supply risk issues as well LaMnO3 as the cathode135 which in principle could be converted into a Mn oxide material for the OER.
4.3 Recycling PGMs from catalytic convertors
Another source of PGMs is catalytic converters where the automotive catalysts lose approximately 25% of their initial efficiency after 160000 km. When the regeneration of automotive catalysts is no longer a viable option, they are then considered as solid waste.141 In general the PGM concentration in these catalysts range between 0.1% and 0.2%, which is significant compared to a mine where the concentration is typically 0.001%142 Given that the global annual sales of catalytic converters was around 140 million units by 2019143 it indicates that this is a valuable source of electrocatalytically active materials that could in principle be repurposed for use in PEM electrolysers. The most commonly employed recovery methods are pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy and biohydrometallurgy.144 It is now deemed that these metals must be recycled from both economic and environmental points of view144 if proper handling is ensured to avoid leaching into the environment. With such considerations, electrochemical approaches as used for PGM extraction from PEM fuel cells have been investigated. Diac et al. employed an electrochemical technique to achieve recycling rates as high as 50% in 24 h without any pretreatment of the catalyst, however acidic conditions were required.142 Recently however, Firmansyah demonstrated that separation of PGMs was possible using phosphonium-based ILs making the process more environmentally sustainable.141 Although there are no specific examples of using these recovered PGMs for water electrolysis, it is a direction that may gain traction with the widespread adoption of PEM electrolyser technology.
5. Cost considerations
At present there is a significant lack of literature detailing full techno-economic analyses on recycling waste materials for the applications proposed here. One report by Iloeje et al.145 investigated how the techno-economic feasibility of recycling depends on uncertainties associated with the feed input to the recovery process and the impacts that has on decision making. In that work they examined a recycling facility for Ni metal hydride batteries using a solvent extraction process and an economic model for a separation facility. It was found that the scale of the plant and the uncertain rare earth element composition in the battery feed significantly affects the capital and operating economics of recycling. Choices regarding separation of the individual rare earths or forming alloys also impacted the economic viability. It should be noted that this study only considers selling the pure recovered elements on the market and does not consider the proposal here to recycle materials with as little intervention as possible for water splitting applications.
In addition, the cost associated with the whole life cycle of the catalyst and not just the fabrication process needs to be considered. Compared to virgin resources and the economic cost associated with extraction, transportation, purification and further processing for optimising and customising the precursor for catalyst fabrication, the recycling process is anticipated to be cheaper if simple recovery techniques can be employed. The environmental cost must also be considered when comparing the whole life cycle of the catalyst and efforts should be made to quantify intangible environmental benefits into economic models. Recently the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), released an Assessment Report on the Diverse Values and Valuation of Nature146 which found that there is a dominant global focus on short-term profits and economic growth, often excluding the consideration of multiple values of nature in policy decisions. It is anticipated that this report will allow policy makers to better understand the different ways that people interact with and benefit from nature, while also providing the tools to measure these. With the emergence of such platforms and the possibility of carbon taxes and emission trading schemes, it suggests that recycling scarce materials for green energy applications will eventually not only become economically viable but expected from modern societies.
6. Conclusion and future outlook
From the review of the literature there is an emerging interest in repurposing metal containing waste streams for electrocatalytic applications, in particular electrochemical water splitting to produce green hydrogen. Although the electricity price is the main cost for green hydrogen production, reductions in the cost of electrolysis facilities are also needed as they are the second largest cost component of this technology. It is estimated that the capital costs should be reduced by 40% in the short term to 80% by 2050.139 Therefore, significant reductions in catalyst production costs are required which could be achieved by repurposing the diverse waste sources covered in this review.
It is envisaged that recycling primary and Li ion batteries will mature even further and will extend beyond re-use as a battery material and provide valuable resources for catalyst manufacturing. There is also the emergence of new battery chemistries such as secondary Zn, Mg and Al ion batteries which require intercalation cathode materials based on metal oxides such as MnO2, Co3O4, NiCo2O4, LiMn2O4, CoxNi3−xS,147–153 which in principle could all be recovered and used as water splitting catalysts. Although Li ion batteries currently dominate the market it is anticipated that these alternative battery chemistries may also reach commercial applicability for a range of applications and therefore the possibility of recycling batteries of this type should also be considered. One particular area that is worth focusing on is recycling electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) at their end of life given their recent uptake in major regions. Indeed, it is estimated that there will be an increase from 1.3 to 2 billion vehicles globally by 2030.154 As discussed in this review recycling Li ion batteries provides a significant array of materials that could be used as water splitting catalysts.
Recycling electronic waste such as electrical cabling and PCBs is gaining momentum and forms part of the emerging industry of Urban Mining. The various methods used to recycle PCBs have been outlined in an excellent review by Kaya155 where a variety of physical and chemicals methods have been used to isolate the various components that make up a PCB. However, there remains challenges associated with metal and nonmetal separation and the recovery of valuable metals from the PCB leach liquors.155 This opens up an opportunity for electrochemical fabrication processes to generate isolated metals from these liquors which has significant potential for creating either highly conducting support electrodes or highly active electrocatalysts, however this area of research is in its infancy.
Many studies carried out in this area involve alkaline water electrolysis which is expected given the composition of the waste sources. A further possibility would be identifying waste streams or modification processes to generate electrocatalysts that are active and stable under acidic conditions for application in PEM electrolysers. Although this review focused mainly on the use of these recovered materials for water splitting reactions, it can also be expected that many of the identified metals and minerals will also have activity for other electrocatalytic reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction for fuel cell applications where it has been shown that recovered battery grade LiFePO4 is an ideal source of Fe and P to construct a heteroatom doped Fe-based carbon material that is highly active for this reaction.156
In addition, CO2 electroreduction to valuable chemicals and fuels157,158 and the reduction of N2 and nitrate ions to ammonia159,160 are gaining significant attention and if successful their widespread use will require both PGMs as well as other transition metals. In particular, recovered Cu will be interesting to investigate for CO2 electroreduction, given the large number of studies of this metal for this reaction.161 As an example, Stojkovikj et al.162 demonstrated that waste bronze with the composition Cu14Sn could be anodically dissolved and then redeposited at the cathode under dynamic hydrogen bubble template conditions to yield mesoporous foams with a surface composition of Cu10Sn. This electrode exhibited high CO2 electroreduction selectivity toward CO with 85% faradaic efficiency. Badaway and coworkers163 showed that repurposing scrap brass alloys with different Zn content allowed for the conversion of CO2 into carbon monoxide and formate. The selectivity towards CO formation was improved when the alloys were galvanically replaced with Ag. Yang et al.164 showed that bimetallic copper−lead (CuPb) electrocatalysts could be prepared from industrial metallurgical waste with the composition of Cu9Pb1, which exhibited a faradaic efficiency for CO formation that was four times higher than that of pure Cu. Indeed, using metal residues produced in the metallurgical industry to prepare electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion is gaining more attention.165,166 For the natural minerals, Piontek et al.167 showed that the mineral pentlandite (Fe4.5Ni4.5S8) could be used as an effective electrocatalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 with a faradaic efficiency of 87% and 13% for the formation of CO and methane, respectively.
One important aspect that is emerging is proper benchmarking of performance. As mentioned previously it is difficult to compare the performance of catalysts given the large variety of testing conditions that are employed. Now that the field is moving from catalyst discovery to device implementation, this becomes even more important. A recent perspective by Apfel's group168 outline some key parameters that need to be taken into account such as can the catalyst be produced reliably at scale? As discussed in this review commercially prepared catalysts are being recovered and therefore scale should not be a limitation given the increasing amount of waste electronics etc. being produced. However, the purity of the recovered or repurposed material must be carefully checked prior to application. Other considerations are cell design and testing protocols, where meaningful current densities should be applied of ca. 500 mA cm−2 for water splitting reactions, ideally progressing from most studies that use small scale systems such as rotating disk electrodes with dropcast catalyst layers to the use of gas diffusion electrode setups or full MEA assemblies. As pointed out by Apfel, considering the catalyst/electrode in a holistic fashion would be beneficial as well as reporting the mass activity of the catalyst which has more commercial relevance when cost needs to be accounted for. Meaningful long-term testing is also required at temperatures typically encountered for commercial electrolysis. Many reports show stability for only 24 h which is not a good predictive indicator for a commercial device. Even a very small drop in performance over 24 h will have severe implications for an electrolyser that needs to run for years. Therefore, longer term testing should be undertaken or new accelerated ageing tests developed as used in PEMFC testing. Finally, perhaps a graduated scale (in terms of MEA assembly, cell/stack size, current density passed, duration of electrolysis) could be developed for benchmarking water splitting electrocatalysts that correlates with technology readiness levels to allow catalysts at different stages of development to be directly compared.
Finally, it is important to consider developing recycling infrastructure for current technologies such as Li ion and alkaline batteries, fuel cells and electronic waste such as cabling and PCBs but also emerging technologies based on new battery chemistries, supercapacitors and electrolysers based on PEM and AEM systems. Taking advantage of abundant sources of catalytically active materials such as stainless steels and naturally abundant minerals could also be considered and overall, these approaches might help to ensure the sustainability of the rapidly emerging green energy sector.
