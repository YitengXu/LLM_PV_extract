    , Accepted 10th March 2016First published on 24th March 2016AbstractDuring the last decade, solution-processed colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have attracted significant attention for low-cost fabrication of optoelectronic devices. In this study, lead sulfide (PbS) CQDs were synthesized via the hot injection method and the effect of doping elements with low electron affinity, including cadmium, calcium and zinc, on the passivation of trap states was investigated. A red-shift in the luminescence emission was observed by doping through passivation of lead dangling bonds. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements showed that the lifetime of charged carriers was significantly enhanced by cadmium doping (∼80%) which is quite noticeable compared with calcium- and zinc-doped nanocrystals. External quantum efficiency measurements on thin solid films (∼300 nm) prepared by spin coating supported improved lifetime of carriers through passivation of mid-gap trap states. In order to show the potential application of the doping process, bulk heterojunction CQD solar cells were fabricated. It was found that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was improved up to ∼40%; the highest improvement was observed with the Cd treatment. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were employed to study the effect of doping on the density of states. The results showed that doping with low electron affinity metals effectively reduced the deep trap states of PbS QDs.
Introduction
In recent years, colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have gained much attention as promising materials for the fabrication of solution processed optoelectronic devices.1 These colloidal semiconductor nanoparticles are compatible with low-cost fabrication techniques such as spraying, spin-coating,2 roll to roll fabrication,3 and drop casting.4 The tunable absorption due to quantum size effects and large Bohr exciton radius (as high as 20 nm) provides good absorption of different wavelengths throughout the broad solar spectrum.5,6 Therefore, CQDs are an attractive candidate to develop highly efficient tandem solar cells via fabrication of multi-junctions of size-varied nanocrystals, aiming to increase harvested energy from the solar spectrum.7
Among the different types of semiconductor nanoparticles used for photovoltaic applications, PbS nanocrystals are very attractive in terms of bandgap engineering.8 The bandgap of these nanocrystals can easily be tuned by size reduction to have a selective absorption.8 This is a promising strategy which does not require composition variation or synthesis of ternary or more complex compounds to tailor the bandgap by several fold.9 In practice, it is feasible to shift the absorption edge from 3000 nm to 600 nm by decreasing the size of nanocrystals during chemical processing.10 Nevertheless, the ultrafine nanocrystals with a high surface area to volume ratio have a high density of surface trap states originating from dangling bonds.11 These centres act as recombination sites for charged carriers, hampering their optoelectronic performance. To overcome this shortcoming, different strategies have been adopted. Some studies have employed surface passivation with an inorganic shell in order to enhance photoluminescence via reduction of the Auger recombination.12–18 However, the inorganic shell may reduce the transport of charge carriers inside the thin film, decreasing the efficiency.19Another strategy is to passivate the surface of nanocrystals by using organic molecules. These molecules operate as stabilizing agents of the colloidal system and facilitate its solution processing routes.20 As these insulating organic molecules act as a barrier against carrier transport between adjacent dots,21 shorter molecules such as alkylthiols, aromatic thiols, alkylamines and mercapto carboxylic acids are preferred. It has been shown that shorter ligands increase inter-dot conductivity and provide sufficient surface trap state passivation.21 For instance, by employing 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) in PbS/TiO2 heterojunction CQD solar cells, PCE exceeds 6%.22 The application of metal chalcogenide complexes as agents for surface passivation of CQDs has also been demonstrated.23,24 Recently, the possibility of using halide and cation exchange to gain improved carrier transport through well-passivated surfaces and low trap densities has been illustrated as well.25–27 A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.55% has been reported for PbS QD solar cells using surface modification of the nanocrystals with 1,2-ethanedithiol and doping with suitable dopants.28,29 The selected metal for doping should have low electron affinity (EA) and an atomic structure close to that of lead. In other words, as lead has a low EA, minimum distortions in the crystallographic and electronic structure are attained after doping. Furthermore, dipole interactions or electrostatic interactions are very important for photovoltaic (PV) performance due to the induced-energy shift in conduction and valence bands. In this regard, low EA metals are compatible with high EA halides such as Cl to change the dipole energy, yielding better charge transport and PV performance.19,28,30–32
The aim of the present work is to study the effect of doping and combined surface passivation of PbS CQDs with transition metals (Cd and Zn) and an alkaline earth element (Ca). The PbS nanocrystals were synthesized by the hot injection method and their surface dangling bonds were passivated with oleic acid molecules and doped with Cd, Ca and Zn atoms through a chemical processing route at 100 °C. The optoelectronic properties of the nanocrystals and their thin films deposited by spin coating were studied. To support the experimental results, density functional theory (DFT) was employed. It is shown that metal chlorides with low electron affinity such as Cd, Ca and Zn can annihilate deep trap states or mid-gap states which are detrimental to charge carrier transport and encourage electron–hole recombination. The results of EIS analysis also reveal the effect of surface passivation with metal ions on the charge-transfer resistance in PbS thin films.
Results
Characterization of quantum dots
The characteristics of PbS CQDs were studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A representative TEM image of the prepared nanocrystals and the size distribution graph of PbS CQDs are shown in Fig. 1(a). Irrespective of their chemical composition and passivation with different metal ions, the nanocrystals have an average size of ∼3 nm with a narrow size distribution. The magnified TEM image (Fig. 1(b)) and EDS chemical analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†) indicate that the particles are highly crystalline with the lead sulfide composition. The XRD patterns of the nanocrystals (Fig. 1(c)) also support the high crystallinity of the nanoparticles and the characteristic peaks of lead sulfide (JCPDS 02-0699). No secondary phases, i.e. sulfides of Cd, Ca and Zn, were detected that could imply appropriate doping (with respect to the detection limit of the XRD method). The TEM images of PbS nanocrystals after doping with Cd, Ca, and Zn elements with their size distribution graphs are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The results show that the average size of PbS nanocrystals remains at about 3 nm after doping. In order to estimate the size of QDs using XRD results, the Scherrer equation33 was employed. Based on full width at half maximum (FWHM), the average size of QDs was calculated as ∼3 nm which was in good agreement with the TEM result.

In order to figure out the optimal concentration of different dopants, steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy was employed. The PL intensity of PbS CQDs (with a fixed concentration) at various concentrations of the metal dopant was measured, as shown in Fig. S3–S5 (ESI†). The optimal concentrations of the dopants, which have the highest PL intensity, were 0.5, 0.3, and 0.4 mM for Cd, Zn, and Ca, respectively. Further studies were performed by XPS analysis. The nanocrystals were deposited as thin films on FTO glass substrates and oleic acid molecules were exchanged with MPA (see Experimental section). Fig. 2 shows the results of XPS for the pristine PbS QDs and metal (M)-doped nanocrystals. As shown, new peaks, Cd 3d 5/2, Zn 2s, Zn 2p, Ca 2p, and Cl 2p, appeared at 406.4 eV, 137.2 eV, 87.1 eV, 363.1 eV, and 199.6 eV, respectively, as a result of doping. The chemical composition of the nanocrystals is shown in Table 1. The reduced amounts of carbon and oxygen are mainly due to the solid-state ligand exchange with MPA. The atomic concentration of M in the nanocrystals was estimated as 1.3% (Zn), 1.8% (Ca), and 2.2% (Cd) based on the XPS analysis.

The optical properties of the prepared nanocrystals were studied by UV-vis-near infrared absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The results are shown in Fig. 3. A well-defined excitonic peak at about 923 nm is seen for the pristine PbS QDs (Fig. 3a). The sharp peak indicates that the dots have a narrow size distribution with an optical band gap of about 1.34 eV. The absorption peak became a little bit broader and exhibited red-shift after doping with M. The highest red-shift was for Cd followed by Ca and Zn. The PL spectra of M-doped nanocrystals are shown in Fig. 3b. Bell-shaped curves with a centre around 1050–1100 nm were attained which indicated that the dangling bonds of the emissive infrared particles were passivated effectively.8 Meanwhile, metal-doping caused a red-shift in the PL spectra, although they had nearly the same spectral width. Again, the largest red-shift PL was attained for Cd doping followed by Ca and Zn.

To further study the effect of different metals on the optoelectronic properties of PbS QD films, time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were performed. The fluorescence decays are shown in Fig. 3(c) and the fitting parameters are reported in Table S1 (ESI†). The lifetime of PbS QDs has a single-exponential time constant of 1100 ns. The lifetime of QDs is increased after doping with the transition metals, which is 1120 ns, 1240 ns, and 1410 ns for Zn-, Ca-, and Cd-doped QDs, respectively. Since no new phases are formed upon doping, the effect of dielectric screening can be ruled out. The longer lifetime of carriers can thus be attributed to the effect of metal ions on the midband trap states. The effect of M-doping on the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the nanocrystals is shown in Table S2 (ESI†). A slight increase in PLQY was measured, particularly for the cadmium-treated nanoparticles. As a result, Cd-dopants enhance the photogenerated carriers of PbS QDs due to good passivation of the surface trap states. This effect provides an efficient transport of the carriers and higher current density in the external circuit, which ultimately improves the photovoltaic performance.
Photovoltaic performance
It was shown that the optoelectronic properties of PbS nanocrystals were significantly changed by doping with low electron affinity metals. A long lifetime of carriers increases their collection at the solar cell electrodes before recombination, thereby increasing the power conversion efficiency. In order to study this potential in photovoltaic applications, bulk heterojunction CQD solar cells were fabricated by employing PbS QDs as the active layer. As shown in Fig. 4a, the device architecture consists of the FTO glass covered with a thin TiO2 layer (∼300 nm), the QD film (∼300 nm), and the hole transfer layer (15 nm MoOx) and the gold contact (100 nm). Photo-induced carriers are separated and collected by the electrodes. The resulting current density–voltage (J–V) curves under simulated (AM1.5G) solar irradiation are shown in Fig. 4b. The effect of doping on the figures of merit for the prepared cells is reported in Table 2. The highest PCE was for the Cd-doped PbS QD device with 5.81% efficiency. The high current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of this device are attributed to the longer lifetime of carriers due to the surface doping of PbS QDs. Compared with the undoped device with a 3.77% PCE, we improved the device performance by about 54% using Cd therapy. This improvement was 40% and 28% for Ca and Zn, respectively. The enhanced current density was the main parameter for the improved performance. The EQE curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 4c. The higher current density of the cells with a doped active layer supports the effect of cations on the collection of charge carriers. Although the EQE results have the same trend as absorption peaks, there is a slight difference between them. The origin of these differences is attributed to the method of measurement, which is “in solution” for the UV-vis test and “solid state” or film for the other. It is evident that the agglomeration status and interparticle spacing are different, which influence the spectroscopic results. To further study the effect of doping on the performance of PbS QD solar cells, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized. Fig. 4d shows the Nyquist plots of Z′ vs. −Z′′ for the devices before and after doping with Zn, Ca, and Cd, where Z′ and Z′′ are the real and imaginary parts of the cell impedance, respectively. The series resistance (RS) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) were calculated from the Nyquist curves using the curve fitting approach (Table 2). The semicircle radius of the devices made from M-doped nanocrystals is much smaller than that of the pristine PbS CQDs. This observation suggests that surface passivation of PbS QDs with low electron affinity metals reduces the charge-transfer resistance while improving the carrier collection. Notably, the Cd-doped device exhibits the lowest Rct, coinciding with the highest Jsc and PCE.

Simulation
In order to study the effect of M-doping on density of states (DOS), DFT simulation was performed on MPA-capped PbS CQDs. Fig. 5a shows an atomistic model utilized for simulations. The details of modeling are explained in the Experimental section. Due to the simulation costs, a Cd dopant was considered to study the effect of doping on the electronic properties of PbS QDs. Fig. 5 shows the DOS of Cd-doped PbS QDs as compared with the pristine PbS nanocrystals. In pristine PbS QDs, mid-trap states appearing within the bandgap were observed. After atomic passivation with Cd, the amount of trap states was greatly reduced. The Fermi level of the semiconductor nanocrystals also increased to become closer to that of TiO2 Fermi level −4.2 eV,19 as shown in Table 3. It appears that surface passivation with low electron affinity metals not only reduces the recombination rate but also affects the efficiency of carrier collection. The outcome of this scenario should be enhanced current density with improved power conversion efficiency.

Discussion
To increase the device performance of PbS QD solar cells, new strategies should focus on reducing the recombination sites and trap states through consideration of nanocrystal faceting, geometry, and their binding motifs to well-control the surface passivation. The presented results revealed that the incorporation of metal cations with low EA in the PbS thin film could passivate the surface geometries of the dots to attain a superior photovoltaic performance. In fact, the cations with shallower EA would have orbitals positioned higher than those of Pb when replaced on the surface of PbS QDs. This could depopulate the bonding orbitals, and thus prevent dimer formation. In order to do doping, low EA cations with the same crystal structure (lattice parameter) and the same oxidation state of the QDs are selected to minimize the distortion in the crystal and electronic structure of QDs. As a result, doping the surface of PbS QDs with low EA metals can stabilize the surface, work to counter dynamic trap formation and allow for trap-free doping. For these reasons, Zn, Ca, and Cd were selected.
In this work, the effect of surface passivation on the net surface charge and photoluminescence efficiency of nanocrystals was also shown. Mechanistically, the role of an inorganic passivation agent at the surface of the nanocrystals can be explained by its potential to reduce the deep trap states following reformation of the shallow states. In fact, the presence of low-affinity metal species on the surface of PbS QDs could destabilize the defects and deep trap states, ensuring higher current density and performance. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that, not only the cations but also the halide anions such as chlorine could control the trap states.19 In other words, these ions pin the Fermi level via the formation of surface defects, resulting in strongly localized states. It should also be noted that the charge balance of the nanocrystals through controlling their chemical stoichiometry must also be restored. This can be performed by changing the numbers of ligands and atomic dopants at the crystal surfaces.
Among all of the inorganic cations, cadmium showed a superior effect on the surface passivation of PbS QDs despite its shallower electron affinity. The key point behind higher performance of Cd-doped PbS QD solar cells compared with that of zinc- and calcium-passivated ones is the high bond adaptability of cadmium.19 Cadmium can accommodate a wide variation of coordination geometries and higher photoluminescence quantum yield compared with other transient metals; hence, it can passivate the surface of PbS QDs well.30 The results of TRPL, EIS, EQE and simulation studies supported the efficient influence of Cd therapy on reducing trap states and charge-transfer resistance. The improved carrier lifetime yielded higher current density and thus higher device performance. The presence of chlorine at the surface of PbS QDs (according to XPS results) should also be considered; however, all of the dopants have chlorine halide and, for sure, this is a fair comparison.
Conclusions
The effect of surface passivation with low electron affinity metals (Zn, Ca and Cd) on the optoelectronic properties of lead sulfide nanocrystals was shown. Ultrafine and highly crystalline PbS QDs with an average size of 3 nm were synthesized by the hot injection process. By employing a facile chemical processing route, the nanocrystals were doped with cadmium, calcium and zinc atoms. It was shown that the optical absorption spectrum of PbS nanocrystals was shifted to higher wavelengths. The longer shift was measured for the Cd-treated nanocrystals. A similar shift in the emission spectra was observed. TRPL measurements revealed that M-doped PbS nanocrystals had a longer PL lifetime compared with the pristine PbS QDs (0.78 μs). This improvement was as high as 80% for Cd treatment. Bulk heterojunction CQD solar cells were fabricated on TiO2-coated FTO glasses. The results of PCE measurements showed a significant effect of M-doping on the photovoltaic performance. It was shown that the PCE could be improved up to 58% by passivation with M2+ cations. Improved current density and open circuit voltage were demonstrated. The experimental results were supported by DFT simulations. Computational results on Fermi levels indicated reduced deep trap states with closer compatibility with the electron collector electrode. The results of EIS analysis also showed that M-doping reduced the charge transfer resistance, which improved Jsc and PCE.
Experimental section
Materials
Lead(II) oxide powder (PbO, 99%), cadmium chloride (CdCl2, 99%), calcium chloride (CaCl2, 99%), zinc chloride (ZnCl2, 99%), oleic acid (OA, technical grade 90%), oleylamine, anhydrous toluene, octane, tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA), and mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methanol, isopropyl alcohol and Triton X-100 were obtained from Merck Germany. Bis(trimethylsilyl) sulphide (TMS, Strem, 97% purity), 1-octadecene(ODE, Sigma-Aldrich, technical grade 90%), and titanium tetrachloride (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of doped PbS nanocrystals
In order to prepare PbS CQDs, 0.45 g of PbO, 1.5 ml of oleic acid (OA), and 3 ml of 1-octadecene (ODE) were mixed in a three-necked flask at 110 °C for 16 h to produce a lead oleate solution. Then, 15 ml of ODE was added to the flask and a solution containing 210 μl of bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfide (TMS) dissolved in 10 ml of ODE was swiftly injected into the flask. After washing, the nanoparticles were dispersed in octane (50 mg ml−1). Further surface passivation and doping was performed by employing chlorides of metals with low electron affinities. Metal chlorides of Cd, Ca and Zn at a concentration of 2 mmol in 10 ml of oleylamine (OLA) were mixed with 0.1 g of tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA) in a flask at 100 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, 4 ml of the chloride solutions were injected into 12 ml of the PbS suspension and stirred for 30 min at 100 °C. After precipitation and washing with acetone, colloidal solutions containing 50 mg ml−1 QDs in octane were prepared.
In order to determine optimum concentrations of different doping elements, PbS QDs were prepared at different concentrations of MCl2 (M: Zn, Ca, Cd) in the range of 0.2 to 0.6 mM. The photoluminescence spectrum of QDs in solution was then measured. For this examination, 10 μL of the colloidal QD solution (50 mg mL−1) was dispersed in toluene.
Device fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
The prepared nanocrystals were deposited on transparent conductive electrodes by spin coating. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses with an ohmic resistance of 8 Ω were supplied by sigma Aldrich, USA. The glasses were sonicated in a deionized water bath (Millipore, 18 MΩ cm) containing 3 vol% Triton X-100 for 30 min and washed with isopropanol. After rinsing with deionized water and drying with a flow of nitrogen gas, a thin film of mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles (about 20 nm diameter) was deposited on the glasses by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 45 s. A commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NRT, Dyesol) diluted in ethanol was utilized. The mesoporous films were dried at 125 °C for 15 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Surface activation was performed through TiCl4 treatment at 90 °C followed by annealing at 500 °C for 15 min.
The deposition of PbS nanocrystals on the conductive electrodes was also performed by spin coating. Here, a layer-by-layer deposition technique combined with solid ligand exchange was adopted. A few drops of the colloidal solution were put on the TiO2-coated glass and spun at 3000 rpm for 45 s. In order to replace the long OA ligand with the short thiol molecules of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), a MPA solution (1 vol% in anhydrous methanol) was spread on the surface for 3 s, spin-cast (3000 rpm) for 20 s, and finally washed with anhydrous methanol twice. This process was repeated 10 times until a uniform film was obtained. The thickness of the film was about 300 nm, as indicated by electron microscopy.
In order to evaluate the power conversion efficiency of the nanocrystals, small solar devices (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) were constructed. After depositing the PbS CQDs on the TiO2-coated glasses by spin coating, a bilayer of MoO3/Au (25 nm/100 nm) was thermally evaporated on top of the sample. The deposition rate was about 0.8 Å s−1. The power conversion efficiency was measured under a simulated solar spectrum (AM1.5G) using a Xe lamp and filters at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A Keithley 2400 (USA) instrument was utilized to record the current density–voltage (J–V) data, sweeping between −1 and +1 V using a step size of 0.02 V and a delay time of 150 ms. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a white light bias with 5 mW cm−2 intensity provided by an array of white light-emitting diodes. The excitation beam was generated using a xenon lamp with 300 W (ILC Technology) and the signal was obtained by using an amplifier (Model SR830 DSP Lock5In).
Material characterization
The size and morphology of the prepared nanocrystals were studied using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM52100, Japan) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The thickness and uniformity of the deposited nanocrystals were evaluated using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S4160, Japan). Phase characterization was performed by employing an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Stone Sandi P, USA) utilizing Cu Kα radiation. In order to study surface passivation with organic ligands and their exchange during the deposition process, the infrared spectrum of the thin films was measured using a Perkin-Elmer Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, Spectrum RX, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out by using PHI 5600 with a hemispherical analyzer with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) at 1057 Pa. The PbS QDs with and without doping were spin-coated on FTO glass substrates followed by solid-state ligand exchange using MPA molecules. Optical absorption was recorded on a Varian Carry 500 spectrometer (Varian, USA). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a FLS920P fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with a cryogenically cooled photomultiplier (R5509543, Hamamatsu). The excitation source for the steady-state spectra was a 450 W continuous xenon arc lamp. A picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL5405, excitation wavelength 405 nm, pulse width 49 ps) was utilized for lifetime measurements. A stretched exponential function, , where τ is the decay time and β is a stretch parameter, was used to analyze the PL decay curves. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was measured by an absolute method using the same fluorescence spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere with a BENFLECR coated inner face (Edinburgh Instruments). The spectral correction curve which takes account of the sensitivity of the monochromator, detector, sphere coating and optics to wavelength was provided by Edinburgh Instruments. Also, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using an Autolab PGSTAT30 (EcoChemie B.V., Utrecht, Netherlands) with a frequency range from 1 MHz down to 0.1 Hz at a bias potential of 0.6 V (with a 10 mV sinusoidal AC perturbation). All measurements were done at room temperature.
Simulations
The electronic structure of the nanocrystals passivated with transition metals was studied by density functional theory (DFT) using SIESTA 3.2 software. A non-stoichiometric Pb-rich model with 2.4 nm diameter and 437 atoms was considered. The surface of PbS QDs was passivated with MPA molecules and M (Zn, Cd, and Ca) atoms. In order to passivate the surface of the quantum dot, 48 MPA and 24 CdCl2 molecules were utilized.19 In order to model the PbS QD, we used Spartan 08 V1.2.0 and designed the model according to the literature.4 We considered 437 atoms for the PbS core. The relaxed structure of the PbS QD is a truncated cubic structure and we made the structure by using many layers of {111} planes and finally truncated the structure to have a relaxed PbS structure with a diameter of 2.4 nm.4 It is notable that due to the high volume of simulation treatments and time limitations, we could not establish and examine a larger model. More details about the modelling can be found in the ESI.† Simulations were carried out based on numerical atomic orbitals as a basis. Scalar-relativistic Troullier–Martins pseudo-potentials were utilized.34,35 The generalized gradient approximation with PBE96 as the exchange–correlation function was used. The forces exerted on atoms were controlled until they converged to below 40 meV Å−1 with an energy cutoff of 200 Ry. For the k-point sampling, a Monkhorst–Pack method was used.
