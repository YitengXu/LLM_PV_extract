    , Accepted 13th September 2022First published on 13th September 2022AbstractLuminescence intensity is a critical factor for upconversion (UC) oxides with high phonon energy. Herein, an effective enhancement in UC luminescence is achieved in the ZnMoO4:Er3+ phosphor via Bi3+ doping. UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy verifies the fact that the absorption at 980 nm is enhanced by the introduction of Bi3+. The physical mechanism is that Bi3+ doping affects the transition probability between the f-levels of Er3+. Therefore, the green and red emission intensities are increased 82.4 and 37 times, respectively. The dependence of luminescence intensity on the power of Bi3+-doped ZnMoO4:Er3+ combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations also confirms the proposed energy transfer mechanism. Based on the excellent green emission, the 980 nm excited optical temperature sensing property of the synthesized sample is realized in a wide temperature range by monitoring the intensity of UC luminescence. The theoretically calculated absolute sensitivity of the optical temperature sensor was SA = 3.04% K−1 at 1253 K. This work paves a new way for enhancing UC luminescence and will arouse extensive interest in noncontact temperature-sensing applications.
Introduction
Rare-earth (RE)-doped upconversion (UC) materials have attracted tremendous attention due to their large anti-Stokes shift, excellent optical stability, and intense UC emission. They have great potential for applications in deep-tissue biological imaging, fluorescent probes, lasers, solar cells, optical temperature measurement and other fields.1–3 However, the efficiency of UC is usually much lower than that of traditional RE3+-doped down-shift materials, which has become one of the major bottlenecks in their practical application.4,5 Therefore, an effective method is urgently needed to improve the efficiency of UC.
Tremendous attempts have been made to overcome this problem. First, co-doping sensitizers, such as Yb3+, are always employed to improve the absorption of a 980 nm laser and then sequentially transfer excitation energy to other RE3+ activators, thus improving UC efficiency.6,7 The second strategy is increasing the disordered structure of the crystal, which is beneficial for efficient energy transfer among RE3+ dopants.8,9 Chen et al. summarized the metal ions that were doped in the material to modulate the local microstructure around RE3+ dopants,9 for example, co-doping RE3+ with homovalent ions in the crystal, which leads to lattice shrinkage or expansion due to the ion radius mismatch between the co-doped ions and the host lattice ions. RE3+ ions co-doped with heterovalent ions in the crystal, due to the need of charge compensation, vacancy or gap ions, are introduced into the main lattice. The third way to enhance fluorescence is through plasmonic coupling.10–12 When the RE3+ ions are located near the metallic nanostructures, the enhanced electromagnetic field induced by surface plasmon resonance can enhance the absorption cross section and emission cross section of RE3+. The fourth way is to reduce surface defects of materials. Zhu et al. indicated that the energy migration to surface defects has a significant influence on fluorescence quenching.13 Therefore, an effective fluorescence enhancement method is suppression of surface quenching of materials. One approach is to design core–shell structures, which can effectively reduce the surface defects of nanomaterials, resulting in reduced non-radiative decay, and protect RE3+ in the core, thereby enhancing fluorescence.14 Another method of reducing surface defects is to anneal the material at high temperature, which can increase the size of nanoparticles, reduce the surface-to-volume ratio, and enhance UC.15
By comparison, doping is a simple and effective strategy to significantly improve its luminescence properties by regulating the lattice and electronic symmetry of phosphor substrates. The typical examples are that the UC luminescence could be enhanced by doping metal ions (small-atomic-radius Li+, Na+ and K+, or transition-metal-ions Mn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+, or other metal-ions Bi3+ and so on).16–18 Rai et al. improved the UC luminescence intensity of CaZrO3:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors by doping small-atomic-radius metal ions (Li+, Na+ and K+).19 Jiang et al. achieved an enhancement of the UC luminescence in Zn2SiO4:Yb3+,Er3+ by co-doping Li+ or Bi3+.20 Due to its unique advantages of being green, low toxicity, wide drug application and low cost, Bi3+ has been a special alternative as a feasible doping agent for non-rare earth phosphors.21 Furthermore, Bi3+ has a 6s2 electronic configuration (1s0 corresponds to the ground state, while 3P0, 3P1 and 3P2 mark the first three excited states), resulting in a typically wide emission and absorption band that can be attributed to a 6s2 → 6s6p transition, which makes it an excellent sensitizer to obtain excited light.21 Previous experiments have proved that Bi3+ co-doping can effectively boost the UC luminescence intensity.22–24 However, how the incorporation of Bi3+ affects the RE3+ and matrix, and how the energy transfer process between them occurs, remains to be further explored. Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool to quantitatively evaluate which types of defects can be produced once a dopant is built into a crystal host, and it can determine which defect can be stabilized and at the same time predict the electronic properties of the doped crystal. Therefore, DFT can provide strong evidence for the experimental results.
A low phonon energy matrix is another common method to achieve high UC luminescence efficiency. Molybdate has superior physical and chemical properties and low phonon energy, which makes it suitable as a UC host. As a representative member of the molybdate family, RE3+ doped ZnMoO4 has been widely reported and researched.25 However, the UC emission intensity of ZnMoO4:Er3+ phosphors is still low and cannot satisfy its practical application in several market areas under 980 nm low-power-density excitation.
Herein, an effective approach for UC luminescence enhancement in the green-light emission is obtained in ZnMoO4:Er3+ after Bi3+ doping. The introduction of Bi3+ enormously boosts the UC luminescence intensity. The proposed mechanism is proved by absorption, DFT calculations and UC luminescence spectra. This is the first time a UC luminescence enhancement is subsequently studied both in theory and experiment.
Experimental
Sample preparation
The ZnMoO4:Er3+,Bi3+ phosphors were prepared by a simple hydrothermal process. Zinc oxide (ZnO), erbium oxide (Er2O3), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)2MoO4·4H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Japan. All the chemicals were of reagent grade and used without further purification.
In a typical hydrothermal reaction, ZnO and Er2O3 are weighed in a certain mole ratio, dissolved in dilute nitric acid, and heated to obtain translucent mixed nitrate, which has been accompanied by continuous stirring. Then, 20 mL distilled water and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O with a certain doping ratio were added, and the beaker is marked as No. 1. Then in another beaker, a certain mole ratio of (NH4)2MoO4·4H2O was dissolved in 15 mL distilled water and the beaker is labeled as No. 2. Then the liquid in beaker No. 2 was added slowly into to beaker No. 1, with stirring all the time. After addition, the pH was adjusted to 7 with ammonia. The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes, the final reaction liquid was transferred to a 50 mL hydrothermal reaction kettle, and then the kettle was placed into an oven. The reaction temperature was set at 190 degrees Celsius and left for 6 hours. The white solid obtained was centrifuged, washed multiple times with distilled water until the pH reached nearly neutral, followed by washing with ethanol, and freeze-dried. Since the as-prepared hydrothermal products, especially oxides, contain surface hydroxyl groups that reduce the luminescence properties by creating quenching pathways, each sample was further calcined at 800 degrees Celsius for 2 h to get the final crystalline ZnMoO4:Er3+,Bi3+ phosphors.
Sample characterization
The phase purity was determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 PHASER X-ray diffractometer with a graphite monochromator using Cu Kα radiation (l = 1.54184 Å), operating at 30 kV and 15 mA with a scanning step of 0.02° in the 2θ range from 10° to 60°. The UC photoluminescence spectra were measured by using a 980 nm laser diode as the excitation source, with a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer system. Thermal quenching was tested using a heating apparatus (TAP-02) in combination with PL equipment.
Density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles methods as implemented in the VASP are employed to calculate the electronic structure of ZnMoO4. In our calculations, the interactions between electrons are described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as the functional including exchange–correlation interactions proposed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE). A kinetic energy cut-off of 550 eV was used in the DFT calculations. The geometries were optimized until achieving the convergence criteria of 10–4 eV. The optimized lattice constants of ZnMoO4 are a = 7.94 Å, b = 7.41 Å and c = 8.77 Å.
Results and discussion
The ZnMoO4:Er3+,Bi3+ particles were structurally characterized by XRD in the 2θ range from 10° to 60°, as shown in Fig. 1(a). All of the diffraction profiles of ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,xBi3+ samples agree with the triclinic ZnMoO4 phase [JCPDS no. 70-5387] with the space group P(2), except for the small displacement in peak positions. There was no discernable secondary phase formation, indicating that the Er3+ and Bi3+ ion doping occurred successfully. The enlarged XRD patterns of the peak at 24.2° are shown in Fig. 1(b). Interestingly, compared with the standard PDF card, the diffraction peak at 24.2° shifts to a higher angle when Bi3+ ions are not doped. With the increase of Bi3+ doping concentration, the diffraction peak at this point shifts slightly to a lower angle. The phenomenon is due to the fact that the radius of Zn2+ ions is 0.74 Å, while the radius of Er3+ ions is 0.89 Å. Generally speaking, when Er3+ replaces Zn3+, it is the ion with a large radius that replaces the ion with a small radius. According to the Bragg equation 2dsinθ = nλ, the XRD peak should shift to a smaller angle. Similarly, when Bi3+ (1.03 Å) replaces Zn2+, the XRD peak shifts to a smaller angle. This is caused by the substitution of Bi3+ with larger ionic radii for Zn2+ ions with smaller ionic radii. At the same time, when the trivalent Er3+ and Bi3+ ions occupy the space of the divalent Zn2+ ions, the excess potential of the positive valence will be caused, thus forming the structure of a Zn2+ ion vacancy between the two trivalent ions, resulting in tiny defects in the crystal, which may help to improve the UC luminescence intensity of the sample. The crystal structure of ZnMoO4 is shown in Fig. 1(c) as an example, which was drawn according to Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) file No. 17030. We can clearly see from this figure that both the Zn site and the Mo site are coordinated by six and four oxygen atoms, respectively. Both ZnO6 of the octahedron and MoO4 of the tetrahedron are linked to each other by sharing the common oxygen. Within the crystal of ZnMoO4, there is only one type of Zn2+, Mo6+, and O2−.

The UC luminescence intensity increases with the Bi3+ concentration and reaches the maximum level at x = 0.03 and then decreases (see Fig. 2(a)). Two emission bands can be observed, including a strong green emission from 520 to 570 nm and a weak red one from 635 to 680 nm. The strongest emission is located at 553 nm. The green emission bands at 530 and 553 nm can be ascribed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. The red emission bands at around 657/665 nm originate from the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. Fig. 2(b) exhibits the UC luminescence intensity of the green emission at 553 nm and one red emission at 657 nm as a function of the doping concentration of Bi3+ (i.e., x).

With increasing concentration of Bi3+ from 0 to 5.0%, the UC luminescence intensity initially increases and then decreases. Therefore, the optimal Bi3+ concentration in terms of the UC luminescence intensity is x = 0.03. Particularly, compared with the phosphor without Bi3+ doping, the green and red emissions of ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,0.03Bi3+ are enhanced by factors of 82.4 and 37, respectively. Indubitably, doping moderate amounts of Bi3+ ions can remarkably boost the green and red emissions of ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+ particles.
Variation of the emission intensity for the obtained ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,xBi3+ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05) particles should be ascribed to the following aspect in our experiment. When the smaller Zn2+ (r = 0.74 Å) is replaced by Bi3+ (r = 1.03 Å), the unit cell volume of the obtained particles will increase and the crystal-field symmetry around the Er3+ ion will also be changed, leading to the influence of the forbidden transition around the Er3+ ion, thus enhancing the UCL of the ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,xBi3+ particles. When 0 < x ≤ 3%, the distortion degree of the crystal symmetry for the obtained ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,xBi3+ particles gradually increases with the ascending doping concentration of Bi3+, leading to a continuous increase of the UC luminescence intensity accordingly. While x reached 5%, the UC luminescence intensity decreases.
The study of the relationship between the emission intensity and laser pumping power contributes to revealing the mechanism of UC luminescence. In order to deeply explore the involved UC luminescence mechanism of Bi3+ undoping and doping, we investigated the UC luminescence properties at different excitation powers. The UC luminescence intensity dependence of pumping power of the undoped and doped samples is shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively. Fig. 3(a) and (c) show the emission spectra of ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+ phosphors under different powers of a 980 nm laser. Similarly, the relationship between the emission spectrum of ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,0.03Bi3+ and the excitation power is shown in Fig. 4(a) and (c). The variation trend of red and green UC emission peaks with excitation power is the same as that of the phenomenon without Bi3+ doping, and the UC intensity gradually increases with the increase of the excitation power. As shown in Fig. 3(d) and 4(d), the ratios of the green light intensity at 553 nm and the red light intensity at 657 nm as a function of the excitation light power are described. The green–red intensity ratios of both undoped and Bi doped samples generally show a gentle trend of increase with the increase of the excitation power. With the increase of excitation power, the luminescence colors of both samples shift to green, and the displayed green becomes more pure. Typically, in the low pump power density range, the intensity (I) and the pump power (P) satisfy the following relationship:26I ∝ Pn, where n represents the number of excitation photons to generate one emitting photon. It is the slope in the ln I vs. ln P graph. The values of n for the UC luminescence emissions centered at 530, 553, and 657 nm were deduced based on the double logarithm of the UC emission intensity versus the pump power of ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,xBi3+ (x = 0, 0.03). More specifically, as shown in Fig. 3(b), the slopes of the linear fittings for the 530, 553, and 657 nm emissions are 2.7024, 2.4565 and 1.8609, respectively. This indicates that a two-photon process is involved in producing the green emission at 553 nm and the red emission at 657 nm, and a three-photon process occurred on the green emission at 530 nm. In Fig. 4(b), the slopes for 530, 553, and 657 nm emissions are 3.3998, 3.1868 and 2.5045, respectively, indicating that a three-photon process may occur on both green and red light emissions. By comparing the slopes of each emission in Fig. 3(b) and 4(b), it can be found that the n values of Bi3+ doped samples are larger than those of undoped samples.

To investigate the mechanism of the UC luminescence enhancement after Bi3+-ion doping, UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance is compared (see Fig. 5(a)). Five distinct diffuse reflectance bands, a broad one ranging from 200 to 450 nm and four narrow ones in the vicinity of 532, 657, 800 and 980 nm, can be observed. The broad one is well located at the diffuse reflectance edge position, which is assigned to the valence-to-conduction-band (CB) transition. Three of the diffuse reflectance peaks originate from the intra 4f–4f electronic transitions of Er3+ ions: 2H11/2/4S3/2 to 4I15/2 (Er3+, 532 and 553 nm), 4F9/2–4I15/2 (Er3+, 657 nm), 4F9/2–4I15/2 (Er3+, 800 nm) and 4F11/2–4I15/2 (Er3+, 980 nm). Compared with ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+, the diffuse reflectance spectrum of ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,0.03Bi3+ around 980 nm increases. The band gaps are 3.65 and 3.72 eV for the undoped and doped ones, respectively (see Fig. 5(b)). The results show that the band gap of ZnMoO4:Er3+ is enlarged by Bi3+ doping. The specific reasons will be explained below.

To further elucidate the effect of Bi3+ and Er3+ doping on the electronic properties of ZnMoO4, we calculated the electronic structures of ZnMoO4, Er3+-doped and Bi3+/Er3+ co-doped ZnMoO4. The total (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) are plotted in Fig. 6. From DOS and PDOS, we can conclude that the band gap value of pristine ZnMoO4 is 3.1 eV. The valence and conduction bands are mainly from the contribution of O_p orbitals and Mo_d orbitals, respectively. The electronic transitions of type Mo_d to O_p may present different emissions according to the positioning of the holes in the band structure. When impurity atoms (Er or Bi) are introduced into ZnMoO4, defects occur due to the different oxidation states of cations. The excess of positive charges for Er3+ or Bi3+ make Zn2+ vacancies appear, causing intermediate electronic levels in the forbidden region.27 For Er3+-doped ZnMoO4, the band gap value decreases to 2.5 eV (as shown in Fig. 6(c)). For Er3+/Bi3+ co-doping, shown in Fig. 6(d), the valence band shifts down and the local Er_f electron occurs at the Fermi level, inducing the band gap increase to 3.2 eV, which are basically consistent with the trend of our experimental results.

The vertical dotted line denotes the Fermi level. 
Based on these results, a mechanism is proposed in Fig. 7. First, the Er3+ ion absorbs a photon to make the transition from the ground state 4I15/2 to the excited state 4I11/2 under 980 nm excitation. Second, the electrons on the excited level 4I11/2 continue to move up to the 4F7/2 of the Er3+ ion. Subsequently, the electrons on the 4F7/2 level of an Er3+ ion relax non-radiatively to 2H11/2, 4S3/2, and 4F9/2 levels. Alternatively, the electrons on the excited level 4I11/2 relax to the 4I13/2 level non-radiatively. Then the electrons on the excited level 4I13/2 continue to move up to the 4F9/2 of the Er3+ ion. The 4I11/2 energy level is then reached by non-radiative relaxation, followed by an absorption of a continuous photon to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 energy levels.

Considering the high UC luminescence intensity in green emission, we further explored this material for temperature sensing. The dependence of temperature on the UC luminescence intensity was investigated. Fig. 8(a) shows the UC luminescence spectra of the ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,0.03Bi3+ sample in the interval from 300 to 500 K under 980 nm laser excitation. The UC luminescence intensities in both green and red emissions decrease gradually with increasing temperature. At different temperatures, the central wavelength stays constant without any shift. The UCL integrated emission intensity ratio (FIR) technology was employed to evaluate the temperature sensitivity. The relatively close energy gap is in thermal equilibrium governed by the Boltzmann law.16 The intensity ratio R of the two thermally coupled Er3+ energy levels can be written as28 FIR = I533/I553 = C·exp(−ΔE/kBT), where I533 and I553 are the integrated intensities from the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively, C is the pre-exponential proportionality constant, and ΔE is the energy gap between 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels. Thus, the expression of FIR could be determined as R = 9.77 × exp(−1147.05/T) (see Fig. 8(c)). The ΔE can be calculated as 794.57 cm−1, which is approximate to the energy gap between 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels. The absolute sensitivity SA of a thermal sensor can be defined as SA = ∂R/∂T = R(ΔE/(kBT2)). The corresponding values of sensor sensitivity as a function of temperature are calculated and plotted in Fig. 8(d). Impressively, the sensitivity increases gradually with the temperature increasing from 300 K to 500 K. It can be found that the maximum sensitivity is 3.04% K−1 when the temperature reaches 1253 K according to the theoretically calculated curve. Considering the relatively high sensitivities as well as wide operating temperature range, the ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,0.03Bi3+ materials are promising luminescent probes for optical thermometry.

Conclusions
In summary, the Bi3+-doped ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+ phosphor with an intense green UC emission has been reported for the first time as a promising optical thermometer with a wide operating temperature range. The green and red emissions of the title phosphor are increased by factors of 82.4 and 37, respectively, compared to those of the Bi3+-free material. The physical mechanism is that the induction of Bi3+ affects the transition probability between the f and f levels of Er3+. In addition, the thermometric performance of the ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,0.03Bi3+ particles is estimated, in which the theoretical maximum SA value is 3.04% K−1. These results demonstrate that the ZnMoO4:0.01Er3+,0.03Bi3+ particles are potential candidates for optical thermometry.
