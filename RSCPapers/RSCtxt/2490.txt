    AbstractA new starburst organic sensitizer (I) with carbazole units as antennas and the corresponding dyes (II and III) with starburst triphenylamine or one triphenylamine moiety (for the purpose of comparison) were designed and synthesized, in which carbazole or triphenylamine moieties were used as the electron donor, thiophene units as the π-conjugated bridge, and a cyanoacrylic acid group as the electron acceptor. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of the dyes were investigated by UV-vis spectrometry and cyclic voltammetry. Electrochemical measurement data indicate that the tuning of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be conveniently accomplished by alternating the donor moiety. Photovoltaic devices with carbazole dye I showed a maximum monochromatic incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of 89% and an overall conversion efficiency of 4.4% under full sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) irradiation. The dyes were also tested in quasi-solid-state devices and showed good efficiencies. The stability of devices was performed over 1200 h in full sunlight and at 50 °C. The sensitizer I with carbazole antennas exhibited good stability, retaining 95% of its initial efficiency, while dyes II and III retained 82% and 46% after 1200 h of irradiation, respectively. This result means that carbazole is a photostable hole-transporting moiety for use in dye-sensitized solar cells.

Broader context
The most important issue we are facing in our time is energy. We should not only be concerned about energy in the present, but sustainable energy for the future as well. Solar energy is a clean, renewable and inexhaustible energy source. The conversion of solar energy to electricity using dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) represents one of the most promising methods for future large-scale power production, as it possesses the advantages of being flexible, low cost, and easier to manufacture than other brittle thin film solar cells. The sensitizer is a crucial element in DSSCs, exerting significant influence on the power conversion efficiency as well as the stability of the cells. Here, we report a new starburst organic sensitizer with carbazole units as antennas, which has been fabricated in quasi-solid-state devices and showed 3.09% conversion efficiency under AM 1.5G sunlight and a good stability. Our finding demonstrates that the introduction of carbazole antennas increases the open-circuit voltage and electron lifetime due to the formation of a dense blocking dye layer. Most importantly, the higher durability of the carbazole dye makes this molecular design an interesting option for further development of new molecules.

Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on nanocrystalline porous TiO2 films have been regarded as promising candidates for photovoltaic devices because of their relatively high efficiency and low cost compared with conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices.1 DSSCs based on the Ru-complex dyes can produce a photoelectric conversion yield of 11.5% under standard AM 1.5 sun light irradiation.2 However, the large-scale application of ruthenium dyes is limited because of costs and environmental issues. More and more efforts have been dedicated to the development of pure organic dyes which exhibit not only higher molar extinction coefficients, but also simple preparation and purification procedures at lower cost. Recently, metal-free dyes, such as coumarin,3,4 merocyanine,5 indoline,6,7 polyene,8 hemicyanine,9,10 triphenylamine,11–16 fluorene,17–19 and tetrahydroquinoline20 have been investigated as sensitizers for DSSCs, and great progress has been made in this field.
The sensitizer is a crucial element in DSSCs, exerting significant influence on the power conversion efficiency as well as the stability of the cells. Most organic sensitizers are constituted by donor, linker and acceptor moieties and usually have a rod-like configuration. Generally, organic dyes used for efficient solar cells are required to possess broad and intense spectral absorption in the visible light region. One strategy toward this end is to introduce more π-conjugation segments between the donor and acceptor, thereby forming D-π–π-A structures.12,20–22 However, the rod-like molecules are elongated, which may facilitate the recombination of electrons with the triiodide and the formation of aggregates between molecules.23 Therefore, we expect that a further improvement could be made by introducing starburst triarylamine antennas into the molecule to form the D–D-π–A structure, which avoids the charge recombination processes of injected electrons with triiodide in the electrolyte and leads to a increasing open circuit voltage (Voc).
The donor groups can not only affect absorption spectra but also adjust the HOMO and LUMO levels of sensitizers in the D–D-π–A systems. Therefore, choosing a suitable donor group is very critical to the balance between photovoltage, driving forces and spectral response for future preparation of high efficiency dyes. Carbazole has been widely used in opto- and electro-active materials for its good electron donating and transporting capability. Recently, organic photovoltaic functional materials with carbazole as electron donor have aroused great interest and become the focus of intensive research in the field of solar cells. These materials have significantly reinforced the conversion efficiency of next-generation solar cells, especially dye sensitized solar cells.24 The triphenylamine can enhance the extent of electron delocalization and electron-donating ability of the sensitizer. Also, the introduction of thiophene moiety is expected to allow red-shift of the spectra, and broaden the spectral region of absorption. Furthermore, the tailored starburst carbazole and triphenylamine moiety in sensitizers I and II not only extend the absorption, but also increase the molar extinction coefficient as compared to simple triphenylamines (III). Based on these studies, a new starburst organic sensitizer (I) with carbazole units as antennas and the corresponding dyes (II and III) with starburst triphenylamine or one triphenylamine moiety for the purpose of comparison were designed and synthesized,; the corresponding molecular structures of the three dyes are shown in Scheme 1. Finally, three sensitizers have been applied successfully to sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2-based solar cells and the corresponding photovoltaic properties, electronic and optical properties are also presented.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of dyes I–III 
Experimental
Equipments
NMR spectra were obtained on a Brücker AM 500 spectrometer. The UV–Vis spectra were measured with a model CARY 100 spectrophotometer. MS were recorded with ESI mass spectroscopy. The cyclic voltammograms of dyes were obtained with a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) using a normal three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a regular calomel reference electrode in saturated KCl solution.
Materials
Optically transparent FTO conducting glass (fluorine doped SnO2, transmission >90% in the visible, sheet resistance 15Ω/square) was obtained from the Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd. of China and cleaned by a standard procedure. Lithium iodide was Fluka. THF was pre-dried over 4 Å molecular sieves and distilled under an argon atmosphere from sodium benzophenone ketyl immediately prior to use. Triethylamine and pyridine were distilled under normal pressure and dried over potassium hydroxide. The starting material 4-bromo-N,N-diphenylaniline was prepared according to published procedures.25 All other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received without further purification.
Preparation of solar cells
A screen-printed double layer of TiO2 particles was used as photoelectrode. A 10-μm thick film of 13-nm-sized TiO2 particles (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) was first printed on the FTO conducting glass and further coated by a 4-μm thick second layer of 400-nm light-scattering anatase particles (Ti-Nanoxide 300). Sintering was carried out at 450 °C for 30 min. Before immersion in the dye solution, these films were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. Then the films were heated again at 450 °C for 30 min followed by cooling to 80 °C and dipping into a 3 × 10−4 M solution of dyes in acetonitrile for 12 h at room temperature. To prepare the counter electrode, the Pt catalyst was deposited on the cleaned FTO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (0.02 M in 2-propanol solution) with the heat treatment at 400 °C for 15 min. A hole (0.8-mm diameter) was drilled on the counter electrode by a Drill-press. The perforated sheet was cleaned by ultrasound in an ethanol bath for 10 min. About the assemblage of DSSCs, the dye-covered TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 μm thickness made of the ionomer Surlyn 1702 (Dupont). The size of the TiO2 electrodes used was 0.25 cm2. A drop of the electrolyte was put on the hole in the back of the counter electrode. It was introduced into the cell via vacuum backfilling. The hole in the counter electrode was sealed by a film of Surlyn 1702 and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness) using a hot iron bar. The electrolyte employed was a solution of 0.6 M BMII (1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide), 0.02 M LiI, 0.04 M I2, 0.28 M TBP (4-tertbutylpyridine) and 0.05 M guanidine thiocyanate in a mixture of acetonitrile and methoxypropionitrile (volume ratio, 7:3). For the quasi-solid state electrolyte, fumed silica nanoparticles (5 wt%) with 12-nm primary particle size friendly provided from Degussa was mixed BMII based liquid electrolyte containing 0.5 M iodine and 0.45 M BI (benzimidazole) in an agate mortar. The dye-coated TiO2 film, as the working electrode, was placed on the top of an FTO glass with sputtered Pt as a counter electrode. The redox electrolyte was introduced into the inter-electrode space by capillary force.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photocurrent action spectra were measured with a Model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier, a Model SR540 Optical Chopper (Stanford Research Corporation, USA), a 7IL/PX150 xenon lamp with power supply and a 7ISW301 Spectrometer. The irradiation source for the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurement is an AM 1.5 solar simulator (91160, Newport Co., USA). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The tested solar cells were masked to a working area of 0.159 cm2. Volt–current characteristic were performed on the Model 2400 Sourcemeter (Keithley Instruments, Inc. USA). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all the DSSCs were performed using a Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & CoKG, Kronach, Germany). The frequency range is 0.1 Hz–100 kHz. The applied voltage bias is −0.70 V. The magnitude of the alternative signal is 5 mV.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route to three dyes containing thiophene (I–III) is depicted in Scheme 2. Starburst carbazole and triphenylamine moiety in I and II sensitizer can form a tightly packed insulating monolayer blocking the I3− or cations approaching the TiO2. Thiophenyl unit is attached to the core triphenylamine by the Suzuki coupling reaction, in which the important intermediate 5-(4-(bis(4-iodophenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (4) was obtained. In the next step, this diiodo-exposed intermediate reacted with carbazole or diphenylamine by Ullmann coupling reaction, respectively. Finally, the target product I and corresponding dyes (II and III) were synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation of respective aldehydes with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate, respectively.
 Scheme 2  The synthetic procedure of the dyes (I–III). 
Absorption properties in solutions and on TiO2 film
Absorption spectra of the three dyes in a diluted solution of THF are shown in Fig. 1a and their absorption data are listed in Table 1. In the UV-Vis spectra, the three dyes exhibit two major prominent bands, appearing at 300–400 nm and 400–550 nm, respectively. The former is ascribed to a localized aromatic π–π* transition and the later is of charge-transfer character. We note that I and II show one typical starburst triarylamine absorption peaks at 340 nm in THF and their extinction coefficient of the π–π* transition band is larger than III, which can be attributed to the increase of the triarylamine units. For the charge-transfer band, the absorption maxima for I–III in THF are at λ = 411 nm, 447 nm and 415 nm, respectively. Compared with I and III, II has two diphenylamine groups attached to the triphenylamine on the electron donor side, which enhanced the extent of electron delocalization over the whole molecule, so its maximum absorption peak was red shifted. However, the maxima absorption peak of I has a little blue shift than that of III. It has been speculated that it may be caused by the decrease of co-planarity between the electron donor and the electron acceptor in the ground-state due to the introduction of carbazole unit.

 Fig. 1  (a) Absorption spectra of I–III in THF and (b–d) absorption spectra of TiO2 electrodes sensitized by I–III containing 0, 2, 5, 10 mM CDCA after adsorption for 12 h. 
Parts b–d of Fig. 1 show the absorption spectra of I–III on TiO2 films after 12 h adsorption. As shown in parts b–d in Fig. 1, the maximal absorption peaks for I–III on the TiO2 film are at λ = 483 nm, 509 nm and 490 nm and the absorption bands of them are red-shifted by 72 nm, 62 nm, 75 nm compared with the solution spectrum, respectively. The red shifts of the absorption spectra on TiO2 of I–III could be ascribed to the aggregation or electronic coupling of the dyes on the TiO2 surface. The interaction between the carboxylate group and the surface Ti4+ ions may lead to increased delocalization of the π* orbital of the conjugated framework. The energy of the π* level is decreased by this delocalization, which explains the red shift for the absorption spectra.
In order to optimize dye absorption and sensitization, the effect of co-absorbents was investigated. It has been shown that using the co-adsorbents during the dye-coating process is a good strategy for solving the problem of dye aggregation, which is a cause the suppression of photocurrent generation.26 When TiO2 films were exposed to THF dye solution containing the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the adsorption of all the three dyes was reduced gradually with increasing CDCA content in the dye solution, as shown in Fig. 1(b–d). The drop of the dyes adsorption indicates that CDCA competes with the dyes molecules on the TiO2 surface. Strong interaction between the adsorbed dye molecules and the oxide molecules in the TiO2 surface leads to aggregate formation and consequently, broadening of the absorption spectrum was observed during the dye absorption. This might be correlated with dye–TiO2 interactions, dye–dye interactions, or both, and co-adsorption of CDCA diminished these interactions on the TiO2 surface.27 There are no significant changes in the absorption spectra of I and III when the concentration of CDCA varies from 0 to 10 mM, as seen in Fig. 1b and Fig. 1d, indicates that the possible π-stacked aggregates are not responsible for this spectral red shift. However, the absorption peak showed much smaller red-shifts when dye II co-adsorbed with CDCA compared to the spectrum on TiO2 film, revealing that the aggregation of dye II molecules on TiO2 is truly. This result further proved the comment that the coadsorption of CDCA can retard the aggregation of the dye II. Estimated from the absorbance change, it is reasonable to assume that the dye (I–III) coverage was almost reduced by 50% in the case of 10 mM CDCA in the dye solution and the intermolecular interaction is reduced by the coadsorption of CDCA.
Electrochemical properties
To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2, cyclic voltammograms were performed in acetonitrile solution, using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte, TiO2 films stained with sensitizer as working electrode. The examined highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are collected in Table 1. The SCE reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard. The excitation transition energy (E0–0) of I–III were estimated from their absorption thresholds of dye-sensitized TiO2 films to be 2.40, 2.20 and 2.38 eV, respectively. The HOMO of I–III corresponding to their first redox potential are 1.06, 0.71 and 1.16 V vs. NHE, respectively. The HOMO levels of the three dyes are much more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V), ensuring that there is enough driving force for the dye regeneration efficiently through the recapture of the injected electrons from I− by the dye cation radical. The estimated excited state potential corresponding to the LUMO levels of I, II and III, calculated from EHOMO − E0–0, are −1.34, −1.49 and −1.22 V vs. NHE, respectively. Judging from the LUMO value, the two dyes are more negative than the bottom of the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V), indicating that the electron injection process from the excited dye molecule to TiO2 conduction band is energetically permitted.28
Photovoltaic performance of liquid electrolyte DSSCs

Fig. 2a shows the incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) obtained with a sandwich-type two electrode cell. The dye-coated TiO2 film was used as working electrode, platinized FTO glass as counter electrodes and 0.02 M LiI + 0.04 M I2 + 0.6 M BMII + 0.28 M TBP + 0.05 M guanidine thiocyanate in acetonitrile and methoxypropionitrile (volume ratio, 7:3) mixture solution as redox electrolyte. In the range of 350–490 nm, the solar cells based on I–III show high IPCE above 70% and with the highest value of 89% at 443 nm for I, 88% at 416 nm for II and 89% at 421 nm for III, respectively. On the other hand, the IPCE value for I–III is obviously decreased at 500 to 600 nm, which is in accordance with their absorption spectra on the TiO2 film.
 Fig. 2  (a) IPCE action spectra for I–III-based DSSCs without CDCA and (b–d) dependence of IPCE on the concentration containing 0, 2, 5, or 10 mM CDCA. 
CDCA is a transparent, organic compound which binds strongly to the surface of nanostructured TiO2, being able to displace dye molecules from the semiconductor surface and therefore hindering the formation of dye aggregates.29Fig. 2(b-d) compares the IPCE action spectra for TiO2 film exposed to dye alone and to both the dye and CDCA with 2, 5 and 10 mM in the dye solution. For I-based DSSC (Fig. 2b), the highest IPCE value decreased with increasing the concentration of CDCA (from 89% to 78%), suggesting that the loss in light harvesting effect result from decreased dye adsorption on TiO2 lead to the reduction of photocurrent density. For II and III, the IPCE spectra broaden with increasing the concentration of CDCA (Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d). The best data was obtained with 5 mM CDCA, however, further increases the CDCA concentration to 10 mM leads to a decrease in the IPCE value. Because the monomer can inject electrons to TiO2 more efficiently than the aggregate,3 the mixed dye/DCA layer obtained from exposure of TiO2 to dye solution with 2 mM DCA may contain a mixture of aggregates and monomers. On the other hand, the mixed dye/DCA layer obtained from the exposure of TiO2 to dye solution with 5 mM DCA is mainly composed of monomer, judging from the high IPCE. However, a too-high concentration of CDCA will decrease the adsorbance, resulting in the reduction of photocurrent density.

Fig. 3a shows the current–voltage characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells employing with three dyes I–III as sensitizers under standard global AM 1.5 solar light. The I-sensitized cell gave a Jsc of 8.71 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.710 V, and a fill factor of 0.70, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 4.30%. (see Table 2). Under the same conditions, the II and III-sensitized cells gave a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 8.43 and 8.58 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.701 and 685 mV, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.67 and 0.7, respectively, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 3.94% and 4.11%, respectively. Compared to II and III based DSSC, I has higher open-circuit voltage due to the formation of a dense blocking dye layer and increased electron lifetime. The larger dye molecules had longer electron lifetimes and higher Voc values, suggesting that larger molecules form a thicker dye layer, thus preventing redox electron acceptors from approaching the TiO2 surface.30 To solve the problem of dye aggregation, the effect of CDCA content in the dye solution on the solar cell performance was also investigated, and the data was summarized in Table 2. Co-adsorbed with CDCA can led to a rise in the photovoltage which has been attributed to a decrease of recombination of the injected electrons.31 When 5 mM CDCA was included in the solution of all the three dyes, the best performance was achieved as shown in Fig. 3(b–d). However, further increase of the CDCA concentration to 10 mM leads to a decrease in the Voc value, this is because the adsorption of CDCA leaves protons on the TiO2 surface and hence positively shifts the surface charge by the coadsorption of CDCA, resulting in Voc loss.32 The enhancement of Voc is usually associated with the negative shift of a conduction band edge or suppression of charge recombination. In consequence, suppression of charge recombination may be counteracted by the Voc loss because of proton exchange from CDCA to the TiO2 surface, Thus, the open-circuit voltage would be partially determined by the concentration of CDCA. As shown in the Table, the highest power conversion efficiency could be obtained at 5 mM CDCA.

 Fig. 3  (a) Light and dark current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs based on I–III coadsorbed without CDCA (b-d) I–V curve for a DSSC with I–III coadsorbed with CDCA on the concentration of 0, 2, 5, or 10 mM. 

Fig. 3a also shows the dark current–voltage characteristics of the mesoscopic dye sensitized solar cells employing the different hole transport materials. The dark current increases in the order I, II and III, which agrees well with the Voc values. This dark current change indicates that incorporating carbazole antennas into the organic framework leads to suppression of charge recombination between injected electrons and I3− ions in the electrolyte, favorable for Voc gain.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed to elucidate the photovoltaic findings further. Fig. 4 showed the electrochemical impedance spectra for the DSSCs made with TiO2 electrodes dipped with the three sensitizers (I–III) under a forward bias of −0.70 V in the dark. Two semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 4a). The smaller and larger semicircles in the Nyquist plots are attributed to the charge-transfer at counter electrode and the electron transport at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively. The radius of the larger semicircle increases in the order III < II < I, indicating that the electron recombination resistance augments from I, II to III.33 The electron lifetime values derived from curve fitting are 123.9, 102.4 and 83.9 ms for I, II and III-sensitized solar cells, respectively. The longer electron lifetime observed with I- relative to II and III-sensitized cells indicates more effective suppression of the back reaction of the injected electron with the I3− in the electrolyte and is reflected in the improvements seen in the Voc, yielding substantially enhanced device efficiency. The Bode phase plots shown in Fig. 4b likewise support the differences in the electron lifetime for TiO2 films derived with the three dyes. The middle-frequency peak of the DSSCs based on I shifts to lower frequency relative to II and III, indicating a longer electron lifetime for I. This result is in agreement with the observed shift in the Voc value under standard global AM 1.5 irradiation.

Photovoltaic performance of quasi-solid-state electrolyte DSSCs
Since long-term stability is a vital parameter for sustained cell operation, we substituted the liquid electrolyte with a quasi-solid-state one. I–III organic dyes were evaluated as sensitizers for the quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell using 0.5 M iodine and 0.45 M benzimidazole (BI) in pure BMII (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide) as redox electrolyte.34Fig. 5a shows the incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of TiO2 electrodes obtained with quasi-solid-state solar cells sensitized by dyes I–III. From Fig. 5a one can see that I–III can also efficiently convert visible light to photocurrent in the region from 400 to 650 nm with a quasi-solid state electrolyte, which reaches its maximum of 76% for I at 500 nm, 67% for II at 490 nm and 85% for III at 460 nm, respectively. On the other hand, the IPCE value of I and II in the range 520 to 650 nm is higher than that for III. Also, IPCE value of I is higher than that for II in the range 444 to 535 nm though that of II in the range 535 to 650 nm is higher than that for I. As a result, the IPCE performance of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based I and II is similar to but higher than that of III. Therefore a sensitizer with carbazole and triphenylamine hole transport could become very attractive, because the introduction of carbazole and triphenylamine moiety was indeed to locate the cationic charge from the TiO2 surface and efficiently restrict recombination between the conduction band electron and the oxidized sensitizer.24
 Fig. 5  (a) IPCE and (b) photocurrent–voltage curves of TiO2 electrodes obtained with quasi-solid-state solar cells sensitized by dyes with I–III. 
Photovoltaic performances of I–III sensitized TiO2 film electrodes with a quasi-solid-state electrolyte are listed in Table 3 under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions (100 mW cm−2), and the corresponding photocurrent–voltage curves are shown in Fig. 5b. The I sensitized cell gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 7.88 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.617 V and a fill factor (ff) of 0.64, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 3.09%. Under the same conditions, the II and III sensitized cells gave Jsc values of 9.08 and 7.28 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.625 and 0.584 V and ff of 0.61 and 0.60, corresponding to η values of 3.39% and 2.55%, respectively. Obviously, I and II shows a higher efficiency than III (Table 3). The larger η of I and II than III in quasi-solid-state cells can be tentatively attributed to the well-injection efficiency capability from the starburst triarylamine group and the prevention of dye aggregates on the semiconductor. In addition, the efficiency in the case of carbazole dye I is a little lower than that of II, which is ascribed to the reduction of the photocurrent due to a lesser ability to donate electron of carbazole moiety.

Long-term stability measurements of devices with quasi-solid-state electrolyte were performed over 1200 h at full sunlight and at 50 °C. The variations of the conversion efficiency of solar cells sensitized with I–III is shown in Fig. 6. As for the full sunlight soaking test, all the three cells showed an increase η during the initial 48 h, which may be caused by filling of electrolyte into the inner mesopores of TiO2 electrode. On continuous 1200 h of light soaking test, the solar cell performances of the DSSCs based on I shows little degradation under white-light irradiation at 50 °C (5.0%), while II and III decrease sharply (18% and 54% respectively). The higher stability of the starburst carbazole dye can be ascribed to the following reasons: the bulky structure of the dyes, which probably protects the TiO2 surface and hinders desorption and suppression of electron transfer from TiO2 to the electrolyte (i.e., dark current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy). This result shows that the initial disadvantage of dye I is almost ruled out and carbazole is a photostable hole-transporting moiety for use in dye-sensitized solar cells.

Conclusion
In summary, we have synthesized three organic dyes comprising starburst carbazole and triphenylamine or a triphenylamine thiophene for application in dye-sensitized solar cells. The cell based on the new starburst organic sensitizer (I) with carbazole units as antennas exhibits a 4.4% conversion efficiency under AM 1.5G sunlight. Coadsorption of CDCA reduced the dye loading by about half but improved Voc; the improvement of Voc is attributed to the suppressed charge recombination. Long-term stability measurements of devices with quasi-solid-state electrolyte were performed over 1200 h at full sunlight and 50 °C showing higher stability for the cell with a starburst carbazole dye. Our findings demonstrate that the introduction of carbazole antennas increases open-circuit voltage and electron lifetime due to the formation of a dense blocking dye layer. Most importantly, the higher durability of the carbazole dye makes this molecular design an interesting option in the further development of new molecules.

Broader context
The most important issue we are facing in our time is energy. We should not only be concerned about energy in the present, but sustainable energy for the future as well. Solar energy is a clean, renewable and inexhaustible energy source. The conversion of solar energy to electricity using dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) represents one of the most promising methods for future large-scale power production, as it possesses the advantages of being flexible, low cost, and easier to manufacture than other brittle thin film solar cells. The sensitizer is a crucial element in DSSCs, exerting significant influence on the power conversion efficiency as well as the stability of the cells. Here, we report a new starburst organic sensitizer with carbazole units as antennas, which has been fabricated in quasi-solid-state devices and showed 3.09% conversion efficiency under AM 1.5G sunlight and a good stability. Our finding demonstrates that the introduction of carbazole antennas increases the open-circuit voltage and electron lifetime due to the formation of a dense blocking dye layer. Most importantly, the higher durability of the carbazole dye makes this molecular design an interesting option for further development of new molecules.
