    , Accepted 15th April 2022First published on 18th April 2022Abstract3-Cyanothiophene is an important heterocyclic scaffold in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry as a useful synthetic intermediate as well as in materials science as a privileged motif for photovoltaic development. Herein, we report our unexpected results on the formation of 3-cyanothiophene derivatives as the major products via a three-component reaction of chalcones, benzoylacetonitriles and elemental sulfur along with the minor products 2-aminothiophenes. The ratios between these two thiophene products is 4:3 and could be varied by simply changing the promoting base as well as its stoichiometric ratio. The method was successfully extended to benzoylacetate in place of benzoylacetonitrile to provide thiophene-3-carboxylates.
Thiophene is an important sulfur heterocycle scaffold1a,b that is present in a wide range of bioactive molecules (natural products and commercialized drugs) and organic materials with interesting applications.1c 3-Cyanothiophene, a sub-group of this family, is frequently considered as a useful synthetic intermediate owing to the rich chemistry of the 3-cyano group, which can be conveniently transformed into various functional groups such as aldehydes,2 ketones,3 carboxylic acids,4 amides,5 thioamides,6 imidates,7 methylaminos,8 and azaheterocycles.9 Recently, 3-cyanothiophene derivatives polysubstituted by conjugated groups have emerged as excellent candidates for the development of organic solar cells. For example, polymers with strong electron withdrawing dicyanothiophene (P(NDI2DT-TTCN))10 and 3-cyanothiophene PBCT-2F11 were developed for high efficiency organic solar cells (Fig. 1). Very recently, the incorporation of a 3-cyano group into the thiophene core was shown to have beneficial effects on power conversion efficiency as exemplified by BTORCNA (PCE = 21.10%) compared to PCE = 20.27% of its 3-H derivative BTORA.12 Other 3-cyanothiophenes such as CHOT (3-cyano-4-hexyloxythiophene) bearing conjugated electron withdrawing 2-substituents were also investigated for applications as organic photovoltaic devices.13

The synthetic methods of such donor/acceptor-conjugated systems are mainly based on cross-coupling reactions requiring the use of halogenated thiophenes and organometallic reagents. Even if high yields can be achieved for this key step, the global synthetic routes suffer from low atom- and step-efficiency due to the additional steps of starting material syntheses. Moreover, extensive purification processes were needed to remove metallic traces dispersed within the conjugated materials. The direct and multicomponent construction of the thiophene rings14 with the concomitant incorporation of required substitution motifs under metal-free conditions has emerged as a promising alternative. By avoiding organometallic coupling reactions and decreasing the number of steps, the atom efficiency along the synthetic procedures will be significantly enhanced. This approach combined with using elemental sulfur15 as an inexpensive, versatile and user-friendly source, instead of an expensive and smelly organosulfur precursor such as thiols or sulfides,16 is clearly attractive from both theoretical and practical points of view, particularly in large scale syntheses.
Recently, we have developed an alternative approach based on the three-component oxidative condensation of chalcones 1 (as C4–C5 synthons) with arylacetonitriles 2′ (as C2–C3 synthons) (R = Ar, HetAr) in the presence of sulfur (Scheme 1).17 In this transformation, sulfur acts not only as a sulfur building block but also as a dehydrogenative agent. The one-pot reaction proceeds via two stages: (1) the base-catalyzed Michael addition of arylacetonitriles 2′ to chalcones 1, followed by (2) sulfuration-cyclization-dehydrogenation. The strategy could also be applied successfully to acetonitrile substrates bearing an electro-attractive substituent (ester, secondary and tertiary amides, cyanide etc.,).18
 Scheme 1  Formation of thiophenes 3′, 3 and 4. 
To our surprise, when benzoylacetonitrile 2a was used as a C2–C3 synthon with chalcone 1a, the expected 2-aminothiophene 3a was obtained as the minor product along with 3-cyanothiophene 4a as the major one. The first step of Michael addition progressed in the presence of DABCO as a base catalyst without any difficulties to provide both adducts in quantitative yield starting from 1a and 2a of practically equimolar amounts within 30 min at 80 °C. Subsequently, sulfur was added and the heating continued at 80 °C to provide a mixture of two thiophene products readily separable by column chromatography on silica gel (3a is more polar than 4a due to the 5-amino group). Alternatively, the major product 3-cyanothiophene 4a could be readily isolated by the trituration of the reaction mixture with methanol, followed by filtration and washing with the same solvent. The structures of both thiophenes 3a and 4a were confirmed unambiguously by X-ray crystallography.
Since chalcones are inexpensive and readily available in a wide range of structure and both 3-cyanothiophenes 3 and 2-aminothiophenes 4 have been known to possess useful biological properties, we initiated a synthetic project aimed at obtaining these two series. We investigated the scope of the transformation using structurally diverse chalcones 1 and benzoyacetonitriles 2.
The results are summarized in Table 1. Using this one-pot protocol, we were able to convert a series of chalcones 1 and benzoyacetonitriles 2 to two collections of 3-cyanothiophene 4 as the major products and 2-aminothiophenes 3 as the minor products. In all cases tested, 3-cyanothiophenes 4a–4x were isolated in moderate to good yields. Most of the corresponding 2-aminothiophene derivatives 3 were formed as the minor products and readily isolable, except for 3f and 3o (entries 5 and 14, respectively). Many functional groups such as methoxy and halogens (F/Cl/Br, CF3, hydroxy), including those that are susceptible to reacting with S8/H2S (NO2, CN, entries 2, 10, 13, 15 and 20), are shown to perfectly tolerate the reaction conditions. Several types of polyaromatic and heterocyclic substrates, such as naphthalene (entry 6) and thiophene (entry 11) were compatible with this one-pot thiophenation protocol.19 Some representative structures of thiophene 3 and 4 were confirmed by X-ray crystallography.

At this stage, we carried out an investigation to better control the two reaction pathways by simply changing the activating base as well as its loading. The influence of bases on the chemoselectivity between CN/CO groups was evaluated using different bases capable of activating sulfur.20 The results are summarized in Table 2. With DABCO as a basic promoter, the 4a:3a ratio could be enhanced up to nearly 7:1 when it was used in 2 equiv. Other tertiary amines such as triethylamine and N-methylpiperidine could be used as well with lower 4a:3a ratios. Interestingly, secondary amines such as piperidine as well as its sterically demanding derivative 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TMP) displayed high promoting capacity, leading to the expected products in excellent global yields and 2:1 ratio. In all cases, although the ratios can vary largely depending on the base employed, they were improved with a higher loading of the base promoter. These indications would be useful to optimize the yields of the desired thiophene derivatives.

Finally, we extended the reaction conditions to benzoylacetates in place of benzoylacetonitriles (Scheme 2). In this case, since the ester function seems to be nonconcurrent with the benzoyl group, only one product was obtained. The generality of this reaction was further illustrated with other chalcones bearing various substituents. In all the cases tested, the expected 3-thiophenecarboxylate derivatives were isolated in reasonable yields (46–78%). The structures of 6a and 6e were verified unequivocally by X-ray crystallography. This approach opens inarguably a direct and multicomponent access to 2-arylthiophene-3-carboxylates.
 Scheme 2  Formation of thiophene-3-carboxylates 6. Reactions conditions: Chalcone 1a (1 mmol), ethyl benzoylacetate 5 (1.05 mmol), DABCO (20 mol%, 0.2 mmol, 22mg) and DMSO (0.2 mL, 3mmol) 80–120 °C, 30 min; then S (64mg, 2mmol), 80–120 °C, 16h. The reactions were performed under air in a 7-mL test tube. The reaction temperature for each step is indicated below each compound. 
A proposed reaction pathway was tentatively described to explain the formation of 3 and 4 (Scheme 3). Once the Michael adduct A was formed, its anionic form B would react with elemental sulfur activated by a base C that would lead to polysulfide D. Although the site in α of cyano and carbonyl seems to be more acidic than the methylene site, the carbanion resulting from the deprotonation of the latter site is less sterically demanding and more suitable for sulfuration. At this stage, two possible cyclizing pathways are envisaged. While the reaction on the cyano group leads to 2-aminothiophene 3a, the attack to the benzoyl group provides 3-cyanothiophene 4a. Different factors could influence the chemoselectivity including substituent pattern of both substrate and interaction of base (or more precisely its conjugated acid arising from the reaction with in situ generated H2S). Due to the small and linear structure of the cyano group, its steric interaction with the two neighboring phenyl groups in 4a would be weak. On the other hand, due to the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the C-2 amino group and the C-3 benzoyl group in 3a as confirmed by the crystallographic structures of 3a (as well as of 3b and 3p), a very strong steric interaction between C-3 benzoyl and C-4 phenyl could be envisioned in 3a, suggesting that the cyclization of D to 4a would be more favored than to 3a. It is evident that the relative stability of 4vs.3 could vary significantly according to the substitution pattern.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed an efficient method leading to two important series of densely substituted thiophene 3 and 4 by a new three-component reaction involving elemental sulfur, chalcones 1 and benzoylacetonitriles 2. Via this reaction, 3-cyanothiophenes 4 could be obtained directly as the major products along with 2-aminophiophenes 3 as the minor products. These ratios could be varied by simply changing the activating bases as well as their stoichiometric amounts although the 3-cyano products 4 were always predominantly formed. Further extension of this protocol to benzoylacetates in place of benzoylacetonitriles provided thiophene-3-carboxylate derivative 6 in good to excellent yields.

The alkyl substituted conjugated enones such as benzalacetone and ethylideneacetophenone in place of chalcones were found to be incompatible with the current reaction conditions and resulted in complex reaction mixture.
The choice of the activating base was based not only on the its basicity but also on its compatibility with sulfur. As previously observed,15 weaker bases are not capable of neither promoting the first step of Michael addition nor activating elemental sulfur for the second step. On the other hand, stronger base is oxidized by sulfur thus becomes inactive and in the same time makes sulfur S8 not available as an oxidant for the oxidative sulfurating cyclization step.
