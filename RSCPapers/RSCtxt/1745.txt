Introduction
Photon harvesting for the generation of fuels or electricity is one of the major challenges for sustainable energy and human prosperity.1–3 Organic photovoltaics,3 OPV, is a relatively recent development in the conversion of sunlight to electricity. The application of dye sensitized solar cells as exemplified by the Grätzel cell4 was transformational. However, in contrast to solid state devices the Grätzel cell employs a solution phase electrolyte involving the I−/I3− redox couple.4 Polymer based bulk heterojunction, BHJ, solar cells5 have the advantage of ease of production and flexibility. They typically involve a photon-harvesting and hole transporting polymer such as poly-3-hexyl-thiophene, P3HT, and an electron acceptor/electron carrier such as a fullerene derivative.2,5,6 These thin film devices avoid the use of a solvent based electrolyte and are commercially available with efficiencies of ∼5 to 6%; though efficiencies of >10% have been confirmed.7
Aside from the practical challenges in the construction and production of any new photovoltaic device, there remain the fundamental challenges for increasing efficiency, namely (1) photon harvesting across the broad solar spectrum; (2) the formation of relatively long lived excitons; (3) efficient exciton splitting to separate holes, h+ and electrons, e−; (4) well-matched and high mobility of holes and electrons and (5) efficient charge collection at the electrodes.8,9 In the development of BHJ solar cells there have been several advances in photon harvesting involving conducting polymers with donor–acceptor groups10 and in enhancing electron transport via modification of the fullerene molecules based on C60 and C70.11–14 The e− transport via the fullerenes involves a hopping mechanism.15 Given the random ordering of the polymer-fullerene BHJ, an annealing process is normally employed to assist in the formation of a nanomorphology that enhances charge transport. The ‘annealing’ process typically involves heating and cooling though some solution techniques have been reported.11
Perylene diimides (PDI) are planar aromatic molecules that are known to be electron acceptors and can be tailored to form ordered assemblies.16 They have high extinction coefficients in the visible region of the solar spectrum and have been shown to exhibit high electron mobilities in n-type organic field effect transistors. Additionally the energy level of their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is similar to that of the fullerene derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Consequently it is expected that PDI derivatives may be suitable alternatives to PCBM for use as an electron acceptor in BHJ solar cells.17,18 There are, indeed, now reports of their use in BHJ photocells.17–19 We have been developing oligothiophenes incorporating MM quadruply bonded units for enhanced photon harvesting.20,21 In this article we describe their photophysical interactions with a perylene diimide as an electron acceptor and the quadruply bonded unit as the donor.
To determine if electron transfer occurs from the quadruply bonded unit to PDI femtosecond transient absorption, fsTA and time resolved infrared, TRIR, spectroscopy were employed. These techniques provide information on the nature of photoinduced excited states and may be used to study electron transfer reactions. We report the fsTA spectra of films of PDI, a MM quadruply bonded unit and a blend film of both, as well as TRIR spectra of pure solutions and mixtures of the two compounds.
The specific perylene diimides employed in this work are the octyl and 1-hexylheptyl derivatives shown in IA and IB respectively and the photon-harvesting donor is the compound trans-Mo2(TiPB)2(BTh)2 where TiPB is 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzoate and BTh represents the 2,2′-bithienyl carboxylate. This compound has been prepared previously and is shown in the drawing II which is based on an X-ray single-crystal determination.20  
Experimental section
UV-vis spectroscopy
Electronic absorption spectra in THF solutions were measured at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 spectrometer. Electronic spectra of films were measured using a Cary 5000 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer.
Film preparation
Films were deposited by spin-coating THF solutions onto glass slides. Solutions with concentrations of 15 and 10 mg mL−1 of IA and II respectively were used to prepare films.
Electrochemical studies
Cyclic voltammograms were collected at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using a Princeton Applied Research (PAR) 173A potentiostat–galvanostat equipped with a PAR 176 current-to-voltage converter. The measurements were performed under an argon atmosphere in a 0.1 M solution of nBu4NPF6 in THF inside a single-compartment voltammetry cell that was equipped with a platinum wire auxiliary electrode, a platinum working electrode and a pseudoreference electrode consisting of a silver wire in 0.1 M nBu4NPF6/THF separated from the bulk solution by a Vycor tip. The potentials are referenced to the Cp2Fe/Cp2Fe+ couple.
Femtosecond transient absorption measurements
Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) experiments were carried out using laser and detection systems that have been previously described.22 The samples were excited at 340 nm for the Mo2(TiPB)2(BTh)2–PDI mixture (with excitation power of 1–2 μJ at the sample) by the output of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) equipped with a harmonics attachment (UV/vis). A long pass filter at 400 nm was placed between the sample and the detector when using excitation at 340 nm. During the measurements the samples were kept in constant motion by manual movement of an XYZ stage in the vertical and horizontal directions. To ensure that no photodecomposition occurred during data collection, absorption spectra were recorded before and after the TA measurements. The measurements were repeated several times at each of the pump–probe delay positions to confirm data reproducibility throughout the experiment, and the resulting spectra were corrected for the chirp in the white-light continuum.23 Kinetics were fit in general to a sum of exponential decay components of the form S(t) = ΣiAi × exp(−t/τi) + C, with amplitudes Ai, lifetime, τi, and offset, C, using Microcal Origin 6.0. Error bars for the lifetime are reported as the standard error of the fit.
Time-resolved infrared measurements
The time resolved infrared (TRIR) experiment utilizes a Ti:Sapphire oscillator and regenerative amplifier combination operating at 1 kHz that has been previously described.24 The fundamental laser beam is split to pump an OPA equipped with either an SFG or SHG attachment to produce pump pulses tunable throughout the visible spectrum and a OPA with a difference frequency attachment to produce mid-IR pulses (2–10 μm). The IR beam is split into a probe and a reference beam by a Ge beamsplitter. These beams then pass through the sample, where the pump beam is overlapped with the probe, and are directed into a Triax 320 spectrometer. The probe and reference are spectrally dispersed onto separate HgCdTe array (32 element) detectors cooled by liquid nitrogen. The pump and probe pulses are synchronized by passing the pump through a chopper operating at 500 Hz, allowing for measurement of the probe signal under pump on/off conditions. Signal from the reference beam is subtracted to obtain the overall signal.
Samples were sealed in a Perkin-Elmer rectangular semidemountable cell with a 1.0 mm Teflon spacer between a 4 mm and a 2 mm CaF2 window. Solutions were prepared in a glove box with THF as the solvent such that the absorbance at the MLCT λmax was 1.0–2.0. All samples were excited at 340 nm. The excitation power at the sample was kept ∼1 μJ. The static sample cell was manually translated with an XYZ stage between scans to ensure photo-decomposition was not an issue. The spectra shown consist of multiple experiments, ∼100 cm−1 each, covering a wide range of IR probe energies. Redundant points have been omitted and gaps present in the spectra are due to the probe wavelengths not overlapping between experiments.
Syntheses
Mo2(TiPB)2(BTh)2 was prepared as previously described20 and di-n-octyl perylene diimide and di-n-hexylheptyl perylene diimide were prepared by means of a condensation reaction of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride with excess octylamine or 1-hexylheptylamine respectively.25
Results and discussion
The electronic absorption spectra of films and solutions of IA and II as well as 1:1 mixtures of the two compounds are shown in Fig. 1. In all instances the solvent was tetrahydrofuran, THF, and the spectra were recorded at room temperature. The solution spectrum of IA shows intense transitions in the visible and UV regions due to perylene-based ππ* transitions. The solid state absorption spectrum of compound IA indicates the presence of aggregates. There is a red shift of the absorption bands and a reduction in the intensity of the 0–0 band relative to that of the 0–1 band. This is indicative of the formation of H-aggregates between the PDI molecules.17 The spectra of II show broad and intense transitions assignable to M2δ-to-bithienyl π* and bithienyl-based ππ* transitions.20 The spectrum of the mixed solution and of the blend film is a superposition of the spectra of compounds IA and II.

Both compounds have been studied by electrochemistry, specifically cyclic voltammetry in THF solutions. The electrochemical data for II have been previously reported.20 The molybdenum complex shows a reversible oxidation wave close to the ferrocene–ferrocenium couple, Cp2Fe+/0 and evidence of a reduction wave within the solvent range. The perylene diimide, however, does not show an oxidation within the solvent range, but does show two reversible reduction waves. The electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1 and the cyclic voltammogram for IA is shown in the ESI Fig. S1.† Based on the electrochemical and electronic absorption spectral data, we can put together a frontier orbital energy level diagram showing the respective HOMO–LUMO levels of the two molecules and their HOMO–LUMO gaps. This is shown in Fig. 2. MO energy values were calculated based on the value of −4.8 eV with respect to vacuum for ferrocene.26 LUMO values of IA and II were calculated using the equation LUMO = −4.8 eV − (Ered1/2), where Ered1/2 is the first reduction potential. The HOMO of IA was calculated using the equation HOMO = LUMO − E00, where E00 is the optical band gap. The HOMO of II was calculated using the equation HOMO = −4.8 eV − (Eox1/2), where Eox1/2 is the oxidation potential.

From an inspection of Fig. 2 we can see that electron transfer from the S1 state of the molybdenum complex to that of the perylene diimide is favorable by 0.66 eV. However, as can also be seen in Fig. 1 and 2, the band gaps of the two molecules are similar and their low energy absorptions in the visible region overlap. In order to access the S1 state of the complex in the fsTA and TRIR experiments, we excited the molecule in the 1LLCT state, namely at 340 nm. Here we see the ππ* absorption of the bithienyl ligand and by internal conversion access the S1, 1MLCT state of the molybdenum complex.
The photophysical properties of the dithienyl carboxylate molybdenum complex have been previously studied in THF solutions by transient absorption (fs and ns), TA, and steady state emission spectroscopy.20 From this we know that the compound shows dual emission, fluorescence and phosphorescence from its S1 and T1 states that have lifetimes of 7 ps and 83 μs, respectively. We also know that the T1 state that emits at ∼1100 nm is a 3MoMoδδ* state based on its solvent independence, its vibronic features which show ν(MoMo) ∼ 400 cm−1 and its similarity to related mono and terthienyl carboxylate complexes.
A 1:5 thin film (IA and II) was studied by fsTA spectroscopy. The fsTA spectra of the 1:5 thin film is shown in Fig. 3, along with that of compound II present as a thin film. The molybdenum complex shows the bleach of the 1MLCT absorption at ∼480 nm and an intense transient absorption at ∼570 nm which decays within ∼10 ps, assignable to the S1 state (ESI Fig. S2†).20 In contrast the thin film of the mixture shows a broad absorption from 550–650 nm which decays with a much longer lifetime ∼100 ps (ESI Fig. S2†). The bleach of the 1MLCT state is very weak and this may be due to overlap with the transient absorption band. We note here that when a thin film of compound IA was excited at 340 nm, no TA spectra were observed in the window shown in Fig. 3 (ESI Fig. S3†). The TA absorption of the 1:5 thin film of IA:II corresponds to that of the perylene diimide radical anion which shows broad TA spectra with λmax of ∼700 nm.27 We see no evidence for the formation of the 3PDI excited state, which is expected to show a T1 to Tn absorption that is blue shifted relative to the ground state.28,29 We thus conclude that electron transfer from the photon harvester, compound II, to the electron acceptor IA is occurring. The broad transient absorption does not decay to the ground state, indicating that either incomplete or no back electron transfer occurs during the time-frame of our experiment.

Ideally we would want to photoexcite the donor directly into its 1MLCT state where the electron acceptor did not absorb. The W2δ orbital is known to be ∼0.5 eV higher in energy with respect to its Mo2δ counterpart in related compounds.30 This is seen in the absorption spectrum of the related compound trans-W2(TiPB)2(BTh)2 that has its 1MLCT transition with λmax = 724 nm. We thus attempted related experiments with mixtures of compound IA and the tungsten bithienyl carboxylate. However, we were not able to produce suitable quality thin films from THF or dichlorobenzene. These attempts yielded microcrystalline aggregates which were not suitable for TA spectroscopy.
To support the fsTA studies time-resolved infrared, TRIR, measurements were performed on solutions and thin films. PDI IB instead of IA was used to facilitate the preparation of more concentrated solutions. All samples were excited at 340 nm. Broad featureless spectra were obtained for the films; however solution studies were informative. The TRIR spectra of compound IB is shown in the ESI (ESI Fig. S4†) and that of the 1:1 solution mixture of compounds IB and II is shown in Fig. 4, along with that of compound II in solution. The molybdenum complex shows a bleach of the CO2 stretch of the 2,2′-bithienyl carboxylate at 1500 cm−1. This is accompanied by a broad absorption at 1550 cm−1 that decays with the S1 lifetime of 7 ps (ESI Fig. S5†). The shift to higher energy occurs because the presence of a hole in the HOMO (Mo2δ orbital) decreases the ability of the metal center to participate in back-bonding to the CO2 π* orbital of the 2,2′-bithienyl carboxylate. The Mo2(TiPB)2(BTh)2 singlet state decays into a triplet state that grows in at 1530 cm−1. This state has a lifetime greater than 2 ns and is characteristic of the triplet δδ* state.30 The PDI solution shows signals due to CO stretching vibrations, namely weak ground state bleaches at 1660 and 1700 cm−1 and broad absorptions at 1625 and 1550 cm−1. The spectra decay biexponentially with a fast (<0.5 ps) component assigned to relaxation to the S1 state following excitation at higher energy and a longer component with τ > 2 ns that is characteristic of PDI S1 states (ESI Fig. S6†).
 Fig. 4  Time resolved infrared (TRIR) spectra of a solution of compound II (top) and 1:1 solution of compounds IB and II (bottom). 
The TRIR spectra of the 1:1 mixture of IB and II exhibit new features (Fig. 4). Initially, the spectra appear similar to II with a broad band centered at 1560 cm−1, however there is enhanced intensity from 1625–1650 cm−1 and the dynamics are quite different (ESI Fig. S7†). Kinetics taken at 1563 cm−1 show two components, the first of which (τ1 ∼ 7 ps) corresponds to the lifetime of the S1 state of II. During this time the peak decays to reveal a broader, flatter absorption from 1630 to 1560 cm−1. The broadness of the bands prevents clear assignment of individual vibrations; however this region corresponds to where CO and aromatic ring vibrations are expected to occur for IB−˙. This indicates that ultrafast (τ < 0.5 ps) electron transfer from the excited state of II to give the radical anion of IB also occurs. To the best of our knowledge, vibrational modes of PDI−˙ have not been previously monitored by fsTRIR, though they were recently studied by fs stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) and a similar shift of radical anion vibrations to ∼40 cm−1 lower energy was observed.31
The vibrational bands attributed to IB−˙ subsequently decay with τ2 ∼ 500 ps due to charge recombination. In the long-lived spectra, there is clear evidence of formation of the 3MoMoδδ* state with a ν(CO2) band at 1530 cm−1.30 This state is likely populated by a portion of II* that does not undergo electron transfer and instead proceeds directly to the triplet state. The observation of a decay component in the 1560 cm−1 band that corresponds to the S1 lifetime of II supports this scenario, indicating that photoinduced electron transfer from II to PDI occurs to a smaller extent in solution than in the film. This is not entirely unexpected as the donor and acceptor are in closer proximity in the film.
When taken together the fsTA and TRIR data indicate that upon excitation of compound II, electron transfer from the excited state to PDI occurs to form a charge separated state. While slow back electron transfer is observed in solution, there is no evidence of charge recombination in the thin film during the course of the experiment. This is a promising preliminary result in our studies of the potential of oligothiophenes incorporating MM quadruple bonds for photovoltaics devices.
Conclusions
Femtosecond transient absorption and time resolved infrared spectroscopy on thin films and solutions, respectively, of the compounds IA, IB and II provide evidence for the photoinduced charge transfer from the Mo2δ orbital to the LUMO of the perylene diimide. Based on this we anticipate that oligothiophenes incorporating MM quadruply bonded units should show similar photoinduced charge transfer in thin films containing PDIs and this could hold promise for photon harvesting in metalloorganic photovoltaic, MOPV devices. Further work along these lines is in progress.
