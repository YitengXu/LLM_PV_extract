    , Accepted 28th January 2019First published on 29th January 2019AbstractZinc–polyiodide redox flow battery (RFB) systems with highly soluble triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) couples have demonstrated significantly enhanced energy densities. However, their low power density has limited their broad application. In this work, MoS2 nanoplates were in situ grafted onto graphite felt (GF) surfaces to accelerate the I3−/I− redox reaction. The hexagonal phase MoS2 with enlarged interlayer spacing can facilitate the diffusion of the electrolyte, and the defects on the MoS2 nanoplates can serve as very effective catalytic active sites. Cyclic voltammetry testing revealed the high catalytic performance of MoS2 in the I3−/I− redox reaction. A non-flow cell with the MoS2-modified GF serving as a positive electrode showed a higher energy efficiency than that of pristine GF; increases of about 10.2% and 10.9% at current densities of 30 mA cm−2 and 40 mA cm−2 were obtained with the optimized electrode, respectively.
1. Introduction
With the growing worries about environmental pollution caused by the combustion of finite fossil fuels, the development of environmentally benign energy sources is gaining more and more attention.1,2 However, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are inherently intermittent and generally dispersed from each other, which make it difficult for their extensive penetration into the grid.3 Large-scale electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices can play a significant role in improving the stability and power quality of the grid by smoothing fluctuating electricity patterns (load leveling and peak shaving).4 Among various EES devices, redox flow batteries (RFBs) have long been considered as a promising candidate for electrochemical energy storage devices because of their excellent safety, long cycle life and flexibility in energy and power design.5–7
Since it was first introduced in the 1980s by Skyllas–Kazacos et al., the aqueous all-vanadium flow battery (VRB, pure sulfuric acid based) has been the most investigated flow battery so far.8 However, the state-of-the-art energy density of the aqueous VRB has reached only 25 W h L−1Catholyte+Anolyte, which is only 1/10 of that of Li-ion batteries.9 Such low energy density as well as corrosivity of the strong acid increase the system cost, preventing its further penetration into the market. Depending on solvent choice, non-aqueous RFBs can have a wide electrochemical stable window and operating temperature range. Numerous high-energy-density non-aqueous RFBs have been demonstrated.10–12 Nevertheless, the poor power densities, high cost of the electrolyte and complex packaging process of non-aqueous RFBs are still the main obstacles for their practical applications in the future. Due to the low potential (−0.762 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode), high abundance, low toxicity and intrinsic safety character, metallic zinc (Zn) is regarded as an ideal anode material for aqueous hybrid flow batteries.13 Various redox couples from inorganic to organic were explored as cathode materials for zinc hybrid flow batteries.14–18 Since it was first proposed in 2015, the zinc–polyiodide redox flow battery (ZIB) with a high energy density and high safety has been widely investigated.19–23 However, the relatively low energy efficiency at high current density means that a larger cell stack is required for identical energy output, which eventually results in increased cost. High electrode polarization resistance is believed to be one cause of the low energy efficiency. Such resistance is primarily due to the poor kinetic reversibility of the I3−/I− redox reaction on GF surfaces. In 2016, Li et al. reported two nanoporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL-125-NH2 and UiO-66-CH3, as electrocatalysts to accelerate the I3−/I− redox reaction.20 The MIL-125-NH2-modified GF electrode showed a higher energy efficiency of 6.4% than the pristine GF at the current density of 30 mA cm−2, but suffered from poor chemical stability.
In fact, similar research on iodide/triiodide dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has been extensively reported. Various metal sulfides, oxides, carbides, and nitrides and carbon-based materials have been investigated as alternative catalysts to replace the expensive Pt.24 Because of its special structures and electronic properties, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and MoS2-nanostructured carbon composites with different morphologies have been investigated and proven to produce equivalent or even higher energy conversion efficiencies than that of Pt.25,26 It is believed that the catalytic activity of MoS2 is highly dependent on the exposed edges and unsaturated sulfur atoms on the surface of MoS2 materials. Herein, MoS2 nanoplates were synthesized and in situ grafted onto the GF surface through a solvothermal method.27 The as prepared MoS2 nanoplates have an enlarged interlayer spacing and a low crystallinity. Such characters offer several advantages. Firstly, interlayer spacing is beneficial for the diffusion of the electrolyte. Secondly, the relatively low crystallinity leads to more defects on the MoS2 nanoplates, providing catalytic active sites. Finally, the direct growth of the MoS2 nanoplates on the GF surface is very facile and uniform. First-principles calculations were also carried out in this work to reveal the effective catalytic active sites in the I3−/I− reaction.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a schematic of the synthesis process of the MoS2-modified GF. Briefly, GF electrodes were placed inside a precursor solution with different amounts of (NH4)2MoS4 (15, 20, and 25 mg) and solvothermally treated for 12 h at 210 °C (denoted as 15 mg, 20 mg, and 25 mg MoS2@GF, respectively). The morphology of the as-synthesized MoS2 nanoplates and MoS2-modified GF was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As can be seen in Fig. S1† and Fig. 1a, the solvothermally synthesized MoS2 shows a typical flowerlike morphology. The plate-like layers show dense interconnected ripples and corrugations, suggesting the basal-edge-rich feature of the MoS2 nanoplates. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) revealed a S/Mo ratio of 2.34, which means that there are unsaturated sulfur atoms on the surface of the MoS2 nanoplates (Fig. S2†). The average diameter of the carbon fibers in GF is ca. 12 μm and the surface of the carbon fibers is quite rough and slightly porous, which can facilitate the nucleation and growth of a sulfide layer through strong mechanical interactions (Fig. S3a–c†). At a low concentration, MoS2 nanoparticles are formed (Fig. S3d–f†). As the concentration of the precursor solution increases, MoS2 nanoplates become the dominant product with a uniform distribution on the surface of the carbon fibers (Fig. S3g–i†). The high resolution SEM images (Fig. 1c) reveal that MoS2 nanoplates vertically grow on the GF surface. This unique structure can facilitate electrolyte diffusion and provide more catalytic sites for the I3−/I− reaction. EDS mapping (Fig. S4†) clearly shows the uniform distribution of Mo and S on the surface of the carbon fibers. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1d) reveals that the MoS2 nanoplates are composed of a few layers with an increased interlayer distance of 0.78 nm. No clear interplanar lattice can be observed from the HRTEM image, which implies a low crystallinity of the MoS2 nanoplates. This is further confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S5†). Three diffraction peaks at 18°, 32° and 57° can be well indexed to the (002), (100) and (110) planes of the hexagonal phase MoS2 (2H-MoS2). The new peaks emerging in the low-angle region indicate an enlarged interlayer spacing.28Fig. 1e and Fig. S6a† show the TEM image of the MoS2-modifide GF electrode. One can see a clear coating of the MoS2 layer on the GF surface. The thickness of the coating is about 10–15 nm. The TEM mapping (Fig. S6b†) again shows the uniform distribution of MoS2 on the GF surface.

Fig. S7† shows the typical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of ZnI2 on the glassy carbon electrode. There are two pairs of redox reaction peaks, corresponding to the redox reaction of Zn/Zn2+ at the negative and I3−/I− at the positive half-cells, respectively. The electrocatalytic activities of the as-obtained MoS2 catalysts in the I3−/I− reaction were investigated in a solution of 0.10 M ZnI2 and 0.10 M Zn(I3)2 in a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell (Fig. 1f and Fig. S8†). Briefly, the electrochemical activity and reversibility of the catalysts toward the redox couple of I3−/I− can be reflected by the peak positions and current intensities of the anodic and cathodic peaks. The detailed peak separations (ΔE) and the ratio of the redox peak current densities (|ipa/ipc|) for different electrodes are listed in Table S2.† The ΔE of the I3−/I− redox couple on the glassy carbon electrode is 0.860 V, which decreases to 0.745 V on the MoS2@GC electrode. Though the cathodic peak current density on the MoS2@GC electrode (0.043 A cm−2) is lower than that on the GC electrode (0.055 A cm−2), the anodic peak current density is increased from 0.043 A cm−2 to 0.047 A cm−2. As a result, the ratio of |ipa/ipc| increases a lot (Table S2†), from 0.745 to 1.092, which relates to an improved reversibility on the MoS2@GC electrode. These results suggest that the MoS2@GC electrode exhibits improved electrochemical activity and reversibility toward the redox couple of I3−/I− compared to the GC electrode. To further investigate the reaction kinetics, the reaction rate constant (k0) was calculated. Fig. S9† shows the fitting results of the plot of ln(ip) vs. (Ep–E0). The k0 values for different electrodes are listed in Table S3.† One can see that with MoS2 deposited on the GC electrode, the k0 values for both the oxidation and reduction reactions of the I3−/I− couple are increased, which agrees well with the CV analysis.
The XRD patterns (Fig. 2a) further evidence the presence of MoS2 in the MoS2@GF composite electrode. The characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 25.9° and 43.4° are attributed to the diffraction peaks of the GF support. As highlighted by the short dot rectangle, a new small peak at low angle can be found in the patterns of the MoS2@GF samples, which corresponds to the XRD patterns of the as-prepared MoS2. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was slightly increased after MoS2 modification (Fig. S10†). In order to investigate the chemical states of Mo and S in the MoS2 and MoS2@GF samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out. It is clear that the characteristic peaks of Mo 3d and S 2p emerge in the spectra of the MoS2@GF samples, while they are absent in the spectra of GF, indicating that MoS2 is successfully doped onto GF (Fig. 2b). It can be obviously found from Fig. 2c that the C 1s spectra show several electronic states.29 The main peak lies at a binding energy of 284.3 eV, corresponding to graphitized carbon (sp2 CC). The rest of the peaks can be assigned to defective carbon (sp3 C–C, 284.8 eV), C–O (286.0 eV), and CO (288.7 eV), respectively. Two characteristic peaks arising at 227.5 and 230.6 eV can be attributed to the Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 binding energies of a Mo(IV) oxidation state, suggesting the dominance of Mo(IV) in the product (Fig. 2d). The corresponding peaks for the S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals of divalent sulfide ions (S2−) are observed at 161.8 and 163.1 eV (Fig. 2e). The peak at 162.0 eV indicates the presence of bridging S22− or apical S2−, which result from the unsaturated S atoms. Together, the XRD and XPS analyses validate the successful modification of MoS2 onto the graphite felt.

To further verify the catalytic effects of MoS2 on the electrochemical performance of the ZIB, a non-flow cell was assembled identically with Nafion 115 as a membrane separator and titanium wire as a current collector, and the charge/discharge cycling performance was tested in 2.0 M ZnI2 electrolyte. Fig. S11† shows the structure of the non-flow cell. Because this work focuses on the study of electrodes used in ZIBs, a zinc plate was used as the negative electrode to eliminate the influence of zinc deposition and extraction. Fig. 3a shows the voltage profiles of the GF and three MoS2@GF electrodes at a current rate of 30 mA cm−2. Compared to the GF electrode, the MoS2@GF electrodes show a remarkably decreased overpotential in both the charge and discharge processes, which could be ascribed to the effect of MoS2 with many active sites for the I3−/I− couple, resulting in a lower charge and higher discharge voltage. All the cells exhibited a high CE of ∼99% during cycling (Fig. S12†). The UV-Vis spectra of the anode and cathode electrolyte samples after charging also show that I3− only appeared on the cathode side (Fig. S13†), which suggests minor crossover of the active species. As the concentration of (NH4)2MoS4 in the precursor solutions increases, the amount of catalyst increases accordingly on the GF electrode, and the energy efficiency (EE) value first increases and then decreases (Fig. 3b), with the highest EE value of 74.3% at 20 mg of (NH4)2MoS4 in the precursor solutions, which is around 10.2% higher than the one without catalyst. Even at a high current density of 40 mA cm−2, the MoS2-modified GF electrodes show a remarkably decreased overpotential of about 77.8 and 111.6 mV in both the charge and discharge processes (Fig. 3c), which has never been reported in such ZIB systems.19–21Fig. 3d shows the cycling performance of a ZIB with a 20 mg MoS2@GF electrode at a current density of 40 mA cm−2. No obvious EE decay was observed over 45 cycles, suggesting the excellent stability of the MoS2 catalyst. The average energy efficiency when stable is 67.9%, which is around 10.9% higher than that of the GF electrode. Nevertheless, long term cycling performance was restricted by the unstable deposition/abstraction of the zinc electrode. Further study can be focused on the optimization of the zinc anode.

(b) Energy efficiency with different MoS2 loadings. (c) Charge/discharge curves at a current density of 40 mA cm−2. (d) Efficiency versus cycling number for 20 mg MoS2@GF. 
Quantum chemistry calculations were also carried out to verify the origin of the electrocatalytic activity of the MoS2 catalyst in the I3−/I− reaction. According to previous research,30 the adsorption energy of the I atom (EIad) on the surface of the catalyst is a key parameter affecting the catalytic performance. A small EIad cannot dissociate I2 molecules into I atoms but a large EIad means that the desorption of the I atom into I− (sol) would be thermodynamically difficult to proceed, and thus the overall activity is restricted. So, a suitable EIad should lie within the range of 0.33–1.20 eV.31 In this article, three possible catalytic sites, namely a sulfur vacancy (S vacancy), sulfur edge (S edge) and molybdenum edge (Mo edge), were chosen to calculate the EIad. Fig. 4 shows the quantum chemistry calculation results of the selected sites. One can see from the adsorption configuration that I2 molecules can dissociate directly and form I atoms at the three interfaces. The EIad values at the S vacancy, S edge and Mo edge were calculated to be 0.79 eV, 2.54 eV and 4.97 eV, respectively. Based on the value of EIad, the S vacancy seems to be a very effective catalytic active site for the I3−/I− reaction. Combined with the TEM and XRD analysis results, the catalytic performance of the MoS2 nanoplates is due to the following reasons: (i) defects (such as the S vacancy) on the MoS2 nanoplates are very effective catalytic active sites; (ii) the active S edge and S ligand can be introduced into the plate-like MoS2 structure, providing more active sites than simple MoS2; and (iii) the vertically aligned MoS2 nanoplates on the GF surface can facilitate electrolyte diffusion and provide more effective catalytic sites for the I3−/I− reaction.

3. Conclusions
In summary, MoS2 nanoplates, which were synthesized by a solvothermal method and in situ grafted onto GF surfaces, can act as a powerful electrocatalyst for I3−/I− redox couples to enhance the electrochemical activity of the GF electrode in ZIB systems. The improved performance of the ZIB is ascribed to the enhanced electrochemical activity after MoS2 modification. The rate constants of both the oxidation and reduction reactions of the triiodide/iodide couples are increased. With regard to the non-flow cell, the MoS2-modified GF electrode demonstrates excellent performance and stability, and the 20 mg MoS2@GF electrode exhibited the highest energy efficiency. At 30 mA cm−2, the EE of the ZIB with the 20 mg MoS2@GF electrode is stable at 74.3%, which is 10.2% higher than that using GF. Moreover, even at an especially high current density of 40 mA cm−2, the EE of the ZIB with the 20 mg MoS2@GF electrode can still achieve 67.9%. These results suggest that the MoS2 nanoplate modified GF can offer great promise as a high performance electrode for ZIB applications.
