    , Accepted 20th December 2012First published on 20th December 2012AbstractThe mechanism of the formation of gap states in bathocuproine (BCP) used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in poly(3-hexylthiophene) and the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) based solar cell is investigated. The photo-generated electrons in the active layer are extracted to a cathode electrode through the gap states of BCP located near the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the electron acceptors. In the most extensively used BCP, the origin of the formation of gap states is not well understood. We show that gap states in BCP are induced by out-diffusion of P3HT molecules into the BCP layer. A Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) depth profile reveals that the out-diffusion of P3HT occurs during the deposition of BCP on the P3HT:PCBM active layer. The mixing of P3HT molecules with the BCP layer induces a chemical reaction between BCP and P3HT to produce the N–S bonds (between the nitrogen from BCP and the sulfur from P3HT), which acts as gap states in BCP. The power conversion efficiency increased from 0.03% to 3.0% as the deposition rate is reduced from 5.0 Å s−1 to 0.1 Å s−1. This increase originates from the change in the diffusion length of P3HT with the deposition rate of BCP, leading to an increase in conductivity as well as the alignment of the Fermi level through the gap states.
1 Introduction
The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are considered a promising device for solar cells,1–7 since the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been rapidly increased up to 10%.8,9 Moreover, the BHJ OPVs have some potential merits such as low-production cost, flexibility for roll-to-roll processing, and light weight. In BHJ OPVs, an important factor for determining device performance is the charge extraction from the active layer to the electrodes.10,11 This photocurrent depends not only on photo-generation, but also on the interface between the active layer and electrodes.12–14
The insertion of an electron transport layer (ETL) such as bathocuproine (BCP) or bathophenanthroline (Bphen) between the inorganic electrode and the acceptor material is one key way to improve device performance.3,15–18 BCP is extensively used as an ETL in OPVs and Organic Light-Emitting Devices (OLED) because of its large ionization potential (IP > 6.5 eV) and large energy gap (3.5 eV). The transport of electrons in the BCP is fulfilled through the gap states in the vicinity of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the electron acceptor.19–21 However, further improvement in efficiency is related to a fundamental understanding of the origin of these gap states in the BCP ETL. Thus, it is necessary to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanism of the formation of gap states.
Gap states in the ETL of BCP are thought to be induced by the incorporation of metal atoms during the deposition of the metal electrode on BCP.19,20 Several kinds of metals such as lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), silver (Ag) and aluminum (Al) have been examined when forming these gap states, but it was found that only reactive metals, such as Li, Mg and Ca, could strongly affect the electronic structure of BCP through the in-diffusion of metal atoms into the BCP layer.19,22 However, the diffusion length of these metal atoms during the deposition onto organic layers is too short (below a few nanometers) to explain the electron transport through a BCP layer as thick as 30 nm.19,21 Another proposed explanation involves the chemical interaction at the interface of BCP with the P3HT:PCBM active layer. It was suggested that the gap states in BCP originated from several weak interactions, such as the π–π interaction, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces.21,23 However, such weak chemical interactions could only possibly exist in a thin (∼3 nm) layer near the interface.21,23 Thus, these weak interactions cannot explain the enhancement of conductivity in thick BCP layers (∼30 nm).
It is possible that the P3HT molecules in the P3HT:PCBM layer could diffuse into the BCP layer during the deposition of BCP considering the formation of aluminum carbide between the P3HT:PCBM active layer and the deposited aluminum.21 The diffusion of P3HT molecules into the BCP layer leads to a chemical reaction between the BCP and P3HT molecules, which could produce new chemical bonds acting as the gap states in BCP. However, no study has been conducted on the out-diffusion of P3HT molecules to the BCP ETL to form the gap states.
Hereby, we report on the origin of the formation of gap states in BCP, which is being used as an ETL in a P3HT:PCBM based solar cell. The out-diffusion of P3HT into the BCP layer was observed during the deposition of BCP on the active layer by using a Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) depth profile. The mixing of P3HT molecules with BCP induces a chemical reaction resulting in N–S bonding (between the nitrogen from BCP and the sulphur from P3HT). This chemical reaction produces the gap states in BCP, enabling electron transport through these gap states. Power conversion efficiencies between 0.03% and 3% were achieved as the deposition rate decreased from 5 Å s−1 to 0.1 Å s−1; this improvement occurred due to the adjustment of the diffusion length of P3HT molecules in BCP at different deposition rates. From our results, we suggest a mechanism for the formation of gap states in the electron transporting layer of BCP in P3HT:PCBM based-OPVs.
2 Experimental
Device fabrication
Glass coated with ITO (150 nm thick, ∼10 Ω sq−1) was used as the starting substrate. The substrate was cleaned with acetone, iso-propyl alcohol and deionized water and then dried with a high purity nitrogen gas. The ITO glass was cleaned using UV-O treatment for 15 min at a power of 30 mW cm−2 prior to coating the PEDOT:PSS (spin-coated from Baytron P, H. C. Stark GmbH, and treated at 130 °C for 10 min, thickness ∼30 nm). After spin coating the PEDOT:PSS, the substrates were transferred to a N2-filled glove box (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O). Regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, purchased from Rieke Metals and used as received) was first dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) to make a 20 mg ml−1 solution, followed by blending with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, Nano-C, used as received) in a 1:1 weight ratio. The blend was stirred for ∼14 h in a glove box before being spin-coated (700 rpm, 30 s) on top of the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO surface. The active layer thickness was measured at ∼200 nm by a surface profiler. The devices were annealed on a hot plate in a glove box at 130 °C for 10 min. BCP/Ag bilayer cathodes for the OPVs were prepared with various thicknesses, deposition rates (0.1, 0.3, 1, and 5 Å s−1) and deposition temperatures (20, 30, 35, 40, 60, and 75 °C). The BCP and Ag films were deposited via thermal evaporation under a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr.
Measurements
The J–V curves were measured under ambient air conditions with glass encapsulation using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. The photocurrent was measured under AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination from an Oriel 150 W solar simulator. We prepared 4 devices of each condition with an area of 4 mm2 and averaged each solar cell parameter. The light intensity was determined using a mono-silicon detector calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram illustrating the diffusion of P3HT in organic solar cells and the formation mechanism of gap states in the BCP ETL in P3HT:PCBM based OPVs. The BHJ solar cell is comprised of a distribution of P3HT crystallites, PCBM aggregates, a dispersion of PCBM (both molecular and small aggregates) in disordered P3HT and an electron transport layer (BCP).24 Some of the P3HT and PCBM molecules and aggregates exist at the surface of the active layer before the deposition of the BCP layer. When the BCP is deposited on the P3HT:PCBM layer, the out-diffusion of P3HT molecules into BCP layers could occur (Fig. 1a). This P3HT diffusion leads to a chemical reaction between the diffused P3HT and the BCP molecules. A number of gap states, shown in Fig. 1b, could be produced by the chemical interaction between the BCP and P3HT molecules. The gap states act as media for electron transport, leading to an increase in the photo-induced current in the solar cell.19,25
 Fig. 1  (a) Structure of the P3HT diffused BCP layer on P3HT:PCBM, and (b) schematic band diagram of the BCP/Ag multilayer sample of (a). 
The interfacial region between the metal film and the organic semiconductor film is broadened because metal atoms diffuse into the organic material (Fig. 1S in the ESI†). However, the penetration depth of metal atoms into the organic films is limited to several nanometers.19–21,26 The region of gap states formed by the incorporation of penetrated metal atoms into the BCP layer is also limited to just below the Ag metal contact region, shown in Fig. 1S.† Therefore, the photo-generated electrons cannot be extracted through the gap states of the BCP layer formed by metal in-diffusion when the BCP thickness is greater than the penetration depth of the Ag atoms in BCP.
In order to study the diffusion of P3HT molecules into the BCP layer, a SIMS depth profile of the P3HT:PCBM/BCP sample was obtained (shown in Fig. 2a). The sulphur (m/z = 32) concentration near the surface of the deposited BCP layer was maintained at a much higher level (near 104 c per s) than its concentration deeper in the layer. As the sputtering depth of the BCP layer increased, the concentration of sulphur increased up to nearly 106 c per s. This result suggests that the P3HT molecules near the interface between the BCP and the surface of the P3HT:PCBM layer diffused into the BCP layer. On the other hand, the in-diffusion of BCP molecules into the P3HT:PCBM layer was negligible. We found the absence of BCP in-diffusion into the P3HT:PCBM layer through the CN− (m/z = 26) peak originating from BCP molecules. The CN− peak from BCP saturated to an intensity of nearly 105 c per s at the end of the BCP layer (nearly 30 nm-thick). However, the decrease in the shrinkage of the CN− peak is due to the same ion mass of C2H2− (m/z = 26) from P3HT polymer molecules. As a result, the P3HT molecules were out-diffused during the deposition of the BCP layer, but no in-diffusion of BCP molecules into the P3HT:PCBM layer occurred. In the case of PCBM molecules, there is no critical difference in the concentration of PCBM molecules in the BCP layer. Therefore, we conclude that the out-diffusion of PCBM is insignificant because the oxygen profile of the sample is negligible. Moreover, the volume concentration of PCBM molecules at the surface region of the P3HT:PCBM layer coated on the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS could be significantly lower than that of P3HT due to the vertical phase-separation effects.27

We investigated the effect of P3HT out-diffusion into the BCP layer using XPS and UPS analysis. Fig. 2b and c show the N1s peak and valence band spectra of the BCP layer on the P3HT:PCBM layer. BCP molecules have two nitrogen atoms with lone pair electrons.28 In the XPS N1s core-level spectra of the BCP layer (Fig. 2b), Au is taken as a standard and referenced to the peak at 398.5 eV. The spectrum was composed of the C–N bond with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 1.39 eV.29 When this BCP layer was thermally deposited on the P3HT:PCBM layer, new N–S bonds appeared. To perform a physically precise fit with the minimum number of parameters, we fixed the FWHM of the C–N components at 1.39 eV. The best fit suggests that the N1s peak of the deposited BCP on the P3HT:PCBM layer showed an increased FWHM of 1.56 eV and could be separated into two components that correspond to C–N bonds (398.5 eV) and N–S (399.2 eV) bonds.29,30 The bond dissociation energy of the N–S bond is 464 kJ mole−1.31 The relative component ratio of N–S/C–N bonds of the sample increased from 0 to 0.125. It was found that the deposited BCP on P3HT:PCBM reacted with a certain amount of P3HT molecules in the BCP layer. Considering our XPS analysis results, we propose that the sulfur of the diffused P3HT molecules chemically reacts with the lone pair electrons of nitrogen in the BCP molecules.
To examine the gap states of BCP, we measured the UPS valence band spectra (Fig. 2c). In previous reports, the gap states in BCP have normally been located near the 1 eV to 2 eV range.22,25,26,32 In the sample of BCP deposited on the P3HT:PCBM layer, a shoulder state appeared at 1 eV, which is unusual in comparison with BCP on the Au sample when considering the density of gap states in the BCP layer. These results indicate that the sulfur of the diffused P3HT molecules during the deposition of the BCP layer onto the P3HT:PCBM active layer chemically reacts with the lone pair electrons of nitrogen in the BCP molecules, forming gap states in BCP as shown in Fig. 1b.
In order to investigate the effective diffusion length of P3HT molecules in the BCP layer, the doped BCP layer was inserted underneath a metal electrode. The effect of cathode metal penetration was eliminated by using a 1.5 molar ratio Ag-doped BCP layer below the Ag layer, as shown in Fig. 3a. The total thickness of the BCP layer was a constant 40 nm, and we changed the thickness of the undoped layer. When the thickness of the undoped layer was zero, the entire 40 nm-thick BCP layer was fully doped with a 1.5 molar ratio of Ag. The resulting OPV was the same as that seen in previous research (Fig. 2S in ESI†). The solar cell parameters of the PCE and FF maintained similar values until the thickness of the undoped layer reached 25 nm. Above 25 nm, the JSC, FF, and PCE degraded drastically. This result indicates that the undoped BCP layers, less than 25 nm thick, inserted between a P3HT:PCBM active layer and the metal cathode do not affect the OPV device characteristics.

To investigate the effects of Ag atom in-diffusion into the BCP layer on device performance, we utilized the undoped BCP layer and the Ag-doped BCP layer as an EBL, as shown in Fig. 3S in ESI.† The penetration depth of the deposited reactive atoms (such as Li and Al) is limited to several nanometers.19–21,26 However, there are no previous results on Ag penetration depth into the BCP layer. So, we elucidated the penetration depth of Ag atoms in BCP by inserting an undoped BCP layer between the doped BCP layer and the metal cathode. When the thickness of the undoped layer was zero, the entire 30 nm-thick BCP layer was fully doped with Ag. The OPV produced showed the same results as in Fig. 2S.† As the thickness of the undoped layer increased, the JSC, FF, and PCE decreased gradually, as shown in Fig. 3S.† Above a 10 nm thickness of the undoped BCP layer, the JSC became zero. This result indicates that the penetration depth of vacuum deposited Ag atoms is below 10 nm.
The stack sequence of undoped and Ag doped BCP layers significantly affects the device properties. On the basis of device characteristics in Fig. 3, the in-diffusion of Ag atoms into the BCP layer does not have a critical effect on the electron transport properties of the BCP layer due to the limited penetration depth (<10 nm). However, the P3HT out-diffusion of over 25 nm in the electron transport BCP layer (Fig. 3b) could significantly affect the electron transport ability.

Fig. 4 shows the effect of the deposition rate of the BCP layer on the diffusion rate of P3HT molecules using the SIMS depth profile and XPS, and UPS analysis. The sulphur (m/z = 32) concentration at the surface of the slowly deposited (0.1 Å s−1) BCP layer in Fig. 4a and b was much higher than that of the quickly deposited one (5 Å s−1). In addition, both samples were saturated to the same maximum concentration of sulphur, meaning that the concentration of P3HT was the same in each. These results imply that the P3HT molecules in the slowly deposited BCP sample near the interface between the BCP and the surface of the P3HT:PCBM layer diffused more intensively into the BCP layer than in the quickly deposited BCP sample. In the XPS N1s core-level spectra (Fig. 4c), the FWHM decreased from 1.56 eV in the slowly deposited BCP sample to 1.49 eV in the quickly deposited BCP sample. The N1s peak was deconvoluted into C–N bonds (398.5 eV) and N–S bonds (399.2 eV). The relative component ratios of N–S/C–N bonds between the slowly deposited sample and the quickly deposited sample were 0.125 and 0.052, respectively. This means that the slowly deposited BCP on the P3HT:PCBM layer contains more P3HT molecules in the BCP layer than the quickly deposited sample. When the BCP is slowly deposited onto the P3HT:PCBM active layer, there is enough time for P3HT molecules to diffuse into the BCP layer, as shown in Fig. 1a. In the UPS valence band spectra, a shoulder state appeared at 1 eV (Fig. 4d) in all samples of BCP deposited onto a P3HT:PCBM layer. However, the intensity of the gap state peaks in the sample with a slow deposition rate of BCP was more intensive than that of the quickly deposited sample. Considering our XPS and UPS analysis results, we propose that the gap states in the slowly deposited BCP sample are more significant than in the quickly deposited BCP sample.

The effect of interface mixing between the P3HT:PCBM active layer and the BCP ETL on the device efficiency is represented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 shows the normalized efficiencies and series resistances with various BCP deposition rates as a function of BCP layer thickness. The efficiency was normalized with the maximum efficiency value at the respective deposition rates. As the deposition rate increases, the normalized efficiency is lowered and the series resistance of the OPVs increases for a given thickness of the BCP layer. This apparently reveals that a slow deposition rate of the BCP layer enhances the electron transport ability of BCP molecules in the OPV cells, meaning that the diffusion of P3HT molecules into BCP is more significant when the deposition rate of BCP is low.

The value is normalized with the PCE value at 10 nm-thickness BCP, i.e. the maximum value. (b) J–V characteristics of the device with 30 nm thick BCP with various deposition rates (0.1, 0.3, 1, and 5 Å s−1). 
When the thickness of the BCP layer increases, there are other possibilities of affecting the device efficiency such as changes in surface morphology and optical interference. We investigated the surface morphology using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a sample of the P3HT:PCBM layer and the 30 nm-thick BCP coated P3HT:PCBM layer, shown in Fig. 4S in ESI.† The RMS roughness of bare P3HT:PCBM and slowly deposited and fast deposited BCP sample is almost the same. Because there is no critical change in surface morphology, the effect of surface morphology change could be negligible. Moreover, the effect of optical interference with increasing BCP layer thickness on device performance is limited to an active layer thickness below 100 nm. The variation in the thickness of the optical spacer affects drastically the short circuit current with an active layer thickness below 100 nm.33,34 In our experiments, because the typical thickness of P3HT:PCBM is around 200 nm, the optical interference effect of BCP thickness is negligible. The evidence for ineffectiveness of BCP thickness is demonstrated in Fig. 5S in the ESI.†

Fig. 6 shows the dependence of the BCP deposition temperature on the PCE. The sample was fabricated with different substrate temperatures at the same deposition rate of 5 Å s−1 and the same BCP thickness of 30 nm. The device efficiency was 0.03% at room temperature, but the efficiency increased to 2.25% at a deposition temperature of 35 °C. Above 35 °C, the efficiency decreased gradually until 70 °C. When the temperature reached 75 °C, the device eventually shorted. The chemical structure of BCP could be destroyed because the glass transition temperature of BCP is 62 °C.35 In the J–V curves, both JSC and VOC increased until the temperature was 35 °C and decreased above 35 °C. These results indicate that the molecules in the active layer diffuse out into the BCP layer at a certain temperature, enhancing the electron transport ability of the BCP layer and increasing the cell efficiency.

The diffusion rate is controlled by the deposition rate and temperature during the deposition of the BCP layer onto the P3HT:PCBM layer. When the deposition rate is slow and the temperature is high enough, the molecules have sufficient time and energy to diffuse into the surface before complete coverage.36 In contrast, the organic molecules directly freeze on the surface of P3HT:PCBM and there is not sufficient time to diffuse. The kinetics of the diffusion of P3HT molecules at fast deposition rates and low temperatures can be described by  where v and t are the BCP deposition rate and time, respectively, D0 is the diffusion constant of P3HT molecules in a BCP layer. Therefore, when the deposition rate of BCP is faster than the diffusion rate of the P3HT molecules in BCP, the deposited film thickness is more than the characteristic diffusion length of P3HT in the BCP layer at a certain time. These results indicate that the device efficiency is directly influenced by deposition rate and deposition temperature, as shown in Fig. 5 and 6.
4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the origin of the mechanism for the formation of gap states in BCP used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in P3HT:PCBM based solar cells. The gap states in BCP are generated by out-diffusion of P3HT molecules into BCP at the interface between the P3HT:PCBM layer and BCP. The out-diffusion of P3HT molecules induces a chemical reaction between BCP and P3HT to produce the N–S bonds (between nitrogen from the BCP and sulfur from P3HT), which act as gap states in BCP. The power conversion efficiency was improved from 0.03% to 3% as the deposition rate decreased from 5 Å s−1 to 0.1 Å s−1, and this is achieved by adjusting the diffusion length of P3HT molecules in BCP. We suggest this to be a novel mechanism for the formation of BCP gap states in P3HT:PCBM based-OPVs and that it is applicable when studying other organic material interfaces.
