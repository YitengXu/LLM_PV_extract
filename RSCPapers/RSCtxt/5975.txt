    , Accepted 14th May 2018First published on 15th May 2018AbstractThe oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are both fundamental and essential processes for various energy conversion and storage systems. The kinetics of ORR and OER play a critical role in their energy efficiency and practicality. Here, flower-like ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets synthesized through a facile solvothermal technique were studied as a bifunctional catalyst for both water splitting and non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries. Due to the novel structure and highly active {110} and {100} exposed facets, which can effectively facilitate mass transfer and enhance catalytic capability, Co3O4 nanosheets exhibit better stability and higher ORR/OER activity than Co3O4 nanoparticles, Co3O4 bulks, Pt/C, and RuO2 in alkaline solution. More importantly, Li–O2 batteries with ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets catalyst can enhance the initial discharge capacity from 6400 to 8600 mA h g−1 and improve the cyclability up to 160 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Unexpectedly, XRD and UV/Vis techniques suggest that the main product in Co3O4 nanosheets based cathodes is LiOH, with resulting LiOH also demonstrating reversible formation/decomposition behavior, rather than Li2O2 in pure Super P based cathodes. Further investigation confirms that Co3O4 can also catalyze the electrolyte decomposition responsible for the formation of LiOH, and a reaction mechanism was illustrated. This work highlights that the traditional high-efficiency bifunctional catalyst in aqueous media may not be suitable for non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries, and the effect of catalyst on electrolyte besides the discharge product should also be carefully considered for the design of more stable and practical Li–O2 systems.
Introduction
With increasing concerns about environmental pollution and the depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels, considerable efforts have been focused on the development of next-generation energy conversion and storage systems with ‘green’, sustainable, and high efficiency credentials.1–3 Recently, extensive attention has been paid to various promising energy systems such as electrocatalytic water splitting, hydrogen based fuel cells, solar cells, metal–air batteries, and so on.4–9 Among these potential systems and devices, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are fundamental and indispensable processes for renewable energy conversion and storage. In practical application, however, the efficiency of ORR and OER are greatly limited by the sluggish gaseous diffusion and multistep proton-coupled electron transmission.10 Thus developing effective bifunctional catalysts for both ORR and OER is really meaningful and desirable although highly challenging. In recent years, various catalysts have been prepared and investigated in numerous energy systems related to ORR and OER. Nobel metal based catalysts, as one of a large class of high-efficiency electrocatalysts, have delivered rather high stability and catalytic activity for ORR and OER, but remain limited by their low natural reserves and high cost.11–13 To tackle these problems, an increasing effort has been dedicated to earth-rich, high-efficiency alternatives, such as transition metal oxides,14–16 sulfides,17,18 and carbonaceous materials.19,20
The inimitable transition metal oxides (MxOy) (x and y = 1, 2, 3…) [M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn, etc.], as a result of their excellent physicochemical properties, low-cost, and facile controllable synthesis, have been introduced as catalysts for various applications including electrocatalytic water splitting and Li–O2 battreies.8,21–23 Among them, cobalt oxide, particularly Co3O4, with its spinel crystal structure and multi-valence Co element, have attracted extensive attention due to its favorable catalytic activity toward both ORR and OER. Sun et al.24 investigated the facet effects of nanocrystalline Co3O4 on the OER activity and demonstrated that the surface Co3+ species should be the active sites for OER catalysis, and the {110} plane is more active than {100} toward OER. It is also confirmed that the exposed facets of Co3O4 play a crucial role in the electrocatalytic performance of Li–O2 batteries.25,26 Moreover, Dai's group found that Co3O4 nanocrystals directly grown on reduced graphene as a bifunctional catalyst showed high electrocatalytic performance for ORR and OER in basic media.27 Yan et al.28 prepared different shapes of Co3O4 and demonstrated that the Co3O4 rectangular nanosheets acted as bifunctional free-standing catalysts for Li–O2 batteries, thereby achieving a lower overpotential. In summary, both exposed crystalline planes and morphology of Co3O4 play an important role for enhancing its ORR and OER activity. Meanwhile, it can serve as a bifunctional catalyst for both aqueous and some organic systems, although the catalytic activity, as well as its reaction mechanism, is usually significantly different in aqueous and nonaqueous media. In practical applications, however, various catalysts demonstrate excellent catalytic activity in many different systems. For instance, Lee's group recently reported that a NiCo2O4@Co3O4 hybrid, fabricated by a two-step hydrothermal method, was an effective ORR and OER catalyst for both non-aqueous Li–O2 cells and water splitting.4 Recently, Yun Jung Lee and co-workers reported that the hetero-structured MnO2-coated Co3O4 complex exhibited excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media and an improved lithium-oxygen battery performance was obtained when the complex was used as an air-cathode catalyst.29 To the best of our knowledge, the early works regarding Co3O4 catalysts have been mainly concentrated on the synthesis, morphology control, incorporation of conductive matrices, the ORR/OER performance in alkaline media, or simply the macro battery performance such as the catalyst in Li–O2 batteries.30–33 Less studies are available concerning the effects of the exposed crystalline planes and morphology of Co3O4 on the electrochemical properties in both water splitting and non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries systems. It should also be noted that the catalytic mechanism of OER and ORR for the conventional Co3O4 catalyst in Li–O2 batteries, especially the effects on the electrolyte solvent, is also extremely necessary in order to develop a practical Li–O2 cell system. In other words, objectively evaluating the role of the air-cathode catalyst in Li–O2 batteries is useful and noteworthy.34
In this work, we present a systematical investigation on the intrinsic electrocatalytic properties of novel Co3O4 in both water splitting and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) based Li–O2 batteries. Moreover, the effects of the Co3O4 catalyst on the discharge/charge products and electrolyte in rechargeable Li–O2 batteries are also investigated. Firstly, we fabricated flower-like ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets by a facile solvothermal approach. In an alkaline media, the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets with dominantly exposed {110} and {100} planes manifested apparently higher ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity than Co3O4 nanoparticles and Co3O4 bulks. Moreover, as a bifunctional catalyst in Li–O2 cells, Co3O4 nanosheets exhibited a higher specific capacity, excellent rate ability, and also better cyclability over 160 cycles. Unexpectedly, qualitative and quantitative analyses of the discharge product demonstrated that the main product was LiOH. Further comparison tests and analysis demonstrated that Co3O4 nanosheets can also promote the DMSO decomposition responsible for LiOH product formation, and hence a possible mechanism was proposed and described in detail. The experimental result reveals that the conventional high-efficiency OER/ORR catalysts from aqueous system may catalyze electrolyte decomposition in non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries, resulting in spurious battery performance. In this vein, the essential role of catalysts should be comprehensively evaluated during the development of practical Li–O2 batteries.
Experimental
Synthesis of flower-like ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets
In a typical procedure, 0.2 g of Pluronic P123 was put into a mixture of 13 ml ethanol and 1 ml distilled water, and stirred for 15 min to form a homogeneous transparent solution. Then 0.07 g of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and 0.125 g Co(Ac)2·4H2O were added and stirred for another 15 min to obtain a homogeneous purple solution. 13 ml ethylene glycol was subsequently added and stirred for 30 min. After aging for one day, the mixture was transferred into a 45 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 170 °C for 2 h. Lastly, the resulting precipitate was obtained by centrifugation, washed with deionized water, then freeze dried. The Co3O4 nanosheets were obtained by calcining the precursor in air at 300 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1.
Synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles
In a typical experiment, 0.5 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O was calcined at 300 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air. The obtained products were collected for further characterization.
Synthesis of Co3O4 bulks
According to the similar method, Co3O4 bulks were synthesized by calcining 1.5 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O at 850 °C for 4 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 in air.
Material characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the crystal structure of the synthesized samples and was conducted on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on Physical Electronics 5400 ESCA to investigate the composition and valence state of surface elements. The morphology of Co3O4 materials was studied by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) using a Quanta FEG 250 instrument, and further analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) via a JEOL JEM-2001F (200 kV). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to confirm the thickness of Co3O4 nanosheets by using a Bruker Dimension 3100 instrument. The pore structure and specific surface area of the as-synthesized catalysts were taken on Quantachrome Instrument ASIQM0VH002-5 analyser. Raman spectroscopy was taken on a Renishaw RM 2000 system with a 633 nm laser source. UV/Vis (UV2450, SHIMADZU) spectroscopic testing was operated for quantitative characterization of the discharge product (Li2O2). The specific titration and operation method have been described in detail in earlier reports.35,36
Rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests for ORR and OER in aqueous medium
For the electrochemical activities (ORR and OER) measurements, the as-prepared Co3O4 catalysts (nanosheets, nanoparticles, and bulks) were mixed with carbon powder (Super P) at a ratio of 50:50 wt%, in order to guarantee adequate electrical conductivity. 2 mg of the resulting mixture was added into a mixed solution of 15 μl Nafion solution (5 wt%, DuPont) and 985 μl of ethanol, and ultrasonic dispersion employed to assure a homogeneous suspension. Then 10 μL of the catalyst ink was applied to the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (0.247 cm2, working electrode) and dried at room temperature. Commercial RuO2 and Pt/C (20 wt%) electrodes were also investigated for comparison by the same preparation method. The electrochemical test was recorded by a CHI 760E instrument, and a typical three-electrode system used. This was composed of the working electrode of the RDE, the counter electrode of the Pt wire, and a reference electrode of Hg/HgO tested in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was recorded with a rate of 5 mV s−1 over the voltage range of −0.8–0.3 V in an O2-saturated electrolyte. The ORR activity was tested within the range of −0.8 to 0.3 V at different rotations in an O2-saturated solution, while the OER measurement was performed over the voltage range of 0.3 to 1.0 V with a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. The electron number for ORR kinetics was obtained based on the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation.27 Given the effect of solution resistance, all the data of ORR and OER were compensated by iR. The specific formulas for the iR compensation and turnover frequency (TOF) have been illustrated in detail within several reports.8,10,27
Non-aqueous rechargeable Li–O2 battery assembly and electrochemical testing
The air electrode was fabricated by coating a catalyst slurry, which consisted of a mixture of 30 wt% Co3O4 nanosheets, 60 wt% Super P (SP), and 10 wt% Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder (or 90 wt% SP and 10 wt% PTFE binder) dispersed in isopropanol, on a carbon paper, and then dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 24 h. The average loading of the cathodes was approximately 0.6 mg cm−2. A Swagelok-type cell with an air electrode, a glass filter separator, 1 M LiClO4/DMSO electrolyte, and a lithium metal anode was assembled to study the electrochemical performance of the Li–O2 battery. The galvanostatic discharge and charge testing was conducted on LAND CT2001A system within the potential range of 2.2–4.5 V (vs. Li+/Li) under a pure oxygen atmosphere. While CV testing was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument) within 2.0–4.5 V at 0.1 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
Physical characterization
As shown in Fig. 1a, an XRD measurement was used to study the crystal structure of the synthesized Co3O4 nanosheets. The XRD pattern manifests several dominant planes of (111), (220), (331), (400), (511) and (440), which precisely coincide with a pure spinel Co3O4 crystal with a face-centered cubic structure (JCPDS Card No. 43-1003). In addition, the pure phase structures of both Co3O4 nanoparticles and Co3O4 bulks were also confirmed by XRD (Fig. S1†). As shown in Fig. 1b, the BET measurement of Co3O4 nanosheets shows a typical IV sorption behaviour with a clear hysteresis loop, demonstrating the presence of a representative mesoporous structure. The pore-size distribution obtained by the BJH method also confirms that the dominant pore structure of Co3O4 nanosheets is mesopores in the range of 2–10 nm (inset in Fig. 1b). For a more intuitive comparison, pore parameters of Co3O4 based samples are listed in Table S1,† it is obvious that the flower-like ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets possess the maximum surface area and pore volume. This is favorable for the ORR and OER performance.28

XPS was performed to get some insight into the surface structure characteristics and better understand the catalytic activity of different Co3O4 samples. As shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S2a, c†, the high-resolution Co 2p spectra of three Co3O4 samples all present two notable peaks at about 780 and 795 eV, corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. The spin-energy difference of ∼15.3 eV between Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 and the refined fitting peaks reveal the coexistence of Co2+ and Co3+ in three Co3O4 samples. Moreover, the characteristic of spinel structures can also be confirmed by two apparent shakeup satellites (Sat.).37,38 When compared the atomic ratios of Co3+/Co2+ in the three Co3O4 catalysts (Table S2†), the Co3O4 nanosheets apparently show a higher ratio than Co3O4 nanoparticles and its bulks, indicating that more Co3+ ions are available on the surface of Co3O4 nanosheets. The rich Co3+ ions on the surface of Co3O4 crystal can boost the transport of multiple electrons, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity, especially OER activity.10,24,39 In addition, the O 1s spectra (Fig. 1d and Fig. S2b, d†) of the three samples can be fitted with three typical OI, OII, and OIII peaks at around 529.7, 531, and 532.4 eV, corresponding to the metal–oxygen bonds, oxygen-defect sites, and the surface-bound hydroxyls, respectively.21,31,40 However, the OII peak area ratio for the nanosheets is obviously larger than that for nanoparticles and bulks (Table S2†), revealing the higher concentration of defects/vacancies in the nanosheets. This oxygen-defect structure can accelerate the adsorption of oxygen-containing species for an improved catalytic activity, especially for an enhanced ORR activity.8,29,40 Therefore, the increased ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and oxygen defects in Co3O4 nanosheets compared with nanoparticles and bulks counterparts are commensurate with superior ORR and OER activities.
Raman spectra analysis was utilized to further evaluate the nuances of three Co3O4 catalysts, as shown in Fig. S3.† For all specimens, five typical characteristic peaks observed around 190, 470, 520, 610, and 680 cm−1 correspond to the Raman active vibration modes of the crystalline Co3O4, further confirming the successful preparation of three Co3O4 catalysts.41 Moreover, compared to the particle and bulk counterparts, all Raman peaks of the Co3O4 nanosheets clearly shift to lower frequencies, indicating that the Co3O4 nanosheets possess a more stable phase structure. This is surprising as the smaller crystal size with larger surface area would suggest a greater surface energy, thereby leading to an unstable state. The ultrathin nanostructure of the flower-like Co3O4 nanosheets can provide an enormous number of catalytically active sites. On the other hand, it is also prone to mass defects, resulting in the reduction of surface energy and the phonon confinement effect, which is further confirmed the ultrathin structure with defective nature.42,43

Fig. 2a and Fig. S4† show that ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets interconnect with each other to form a flower-like structure. Compared to the dense-frame Co3O4 nanoparticles (Fig. S5†) and Co3O4 bulks (Fig. S6†), this structure endows Co3O4 nanosheets with more freely available two-dimensional surfaces for subsequent catalytic reactions and assists both mass transfer and product storage, which are beneficial for the electrochemical performance enhancement.15,28 TEM was performed to further investigate the detailed structures of the synthesized powders. As depicted in Fig. 2b and c, the mesopores and unique flower-like structure of the Co3O4 nanosheets can be intuitively observed. Moreover, the numerous dark areas in Fig. 2b are representative of a graphene-like wrinkled structure caused by the winding, stacking and distortion of the ultrathin nanosheets, and the tiny contrast between the background and the nanosheet in Fig. 2c supports the ultrathin sheet characteristic. Fig. 2d indicates the lamellar thickness of the sheet is just about 4.2 nm, which is in good agreement with the AFM results (Fig. S7†) and further demonstrates the ultrathin feature of Co3O4 nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 2e, the SAED pattern of the Co3O4 nanosheet is observed along the [001] direction, with three well-defined diffraction rings of (220), (511) and (400), revealing a locally ordered structure of the crystal. In contrast, both the Co3O4 nanoparticles and its bulks showed a disordered and polycrystalline structure, and the corresponding SAED patterns and HRTEM images are shown in Fig. S5d and Fig. S6d.† In addition, HRTEM was also utilized to determine the preferential facet and dominant exposed planes along the main direction ([001]) perpendicular to the surfaces.24,44 As shown in Fig. 2f, the predominantly exposed facets of the Co3O4 nanosheets are {400} and {220}, corresponding to a lattice spacing of 0.247 and 0.175 nm, respectively. According to the HRTEM result, we propose a crystalline structure for the Co3O4 nanosheets marked by two mainly exposed planes of {100} and {110} in the normal surface direction (inset in Fig. 2f).

Electrocatalytic performance in aqueous medium
In order to study the catalytic activity of the as-synthesized conventional Co3O4 catalysts in different solvent systems, we firstly investigated electrocatalytic water splitting on a RDE system. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table S3,† the CV curves indicate that all three Co3O4 catalysts show a clearly well-defined cathodic peak, while the cathodic peak of ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets (−0.199 V) is more positive than that of Co3O4 nanoparticles (−0.236 V) and bulks (−0.244 V), and it also has the highest peak current of −0.48 mA cm−2, suggesting better electronic movement. The ORR property of the Co3O4 catalysts was further investigated by LSV measurements, as shown in Fig. 3b and Table S3.† It can be intuitively observed that the onset potential of Co3O4 nanosheets shifts positively compared to that of Co3O4 nanoparticles and its bulks, although the onset potential and limiting current density of Co3O4 nanosheets (−0.046 V and −5.12 mA cm−2) are slightly lower than that of Pt/C (0.021 V and −5.50 mA cm−2). To reveal the ORR kinetics of the Co3O4 nanosheets in aqueous system, the LSV measurements at different rotation speeds were conducted, showing a clearly increased current density with rotation speed due to the faster oxygen flow and shorter diffusion distance at a higher rotation rate (Fig. 3c). In addition, the linearity of the K–L curves and parallelism of the fitting lines indicate the kinetic characteristic of a typically first-order reaction with regard to the dissolved oxygen concentration (Fig. 3c inset).27 The electron transfer number for ORR was calculated to be 3.94–3.99 based on the K–L equation, hinting that our Co3O4 nanosheets favours a 4e ORR process in 0.1 M KOH. In contrast, the pure SP, without Co3O4, presented slow ORR kinetics with an electron transfer number of ∼2.1 at 0.50–0.7 V, revealing a primary 2e reduction process (Fig. S8b and c†). Excellent ORR kinetics of the Co3O4 nanosheets was also confirmed by the smaller Tafel slope of 95 mV dec−1 (Fig. S8a and Table S4†) than that measured with Co3O4 nanoparticles and bulks. Importantly, the Co3O4 nanosheets also exhibited similar and even superior durability to Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solutions, with little decay in ORR activity over 20000 s of continuous testing. On the contrary, the Co3O4 nanoparticles and bulks exhibited a 20–30% decrease in activity under the same test conditions (Fig. 3d).

(c) Rotating-disk voltammograms of the Co3O4 nanosheets at different rotating speeds, and corresponding K–L plots (inset). (d) Chronoamperometric responses of Co3O4 catalysts and Pt/C at −0.5 V. (e) OER polarization profiles of Co3O4 catalysts, SP, and RuO2. (f) The ORR and OER bifunctional activity of the as-prepared catalysts. The scan rate was 5 mV s−1. 
Apart from the ORR activity, the OER activity is also a key index for evaluating the bifunctional ability of the catalyst. In this vein, the OER properties of the as-prepared samples from LSV polarization curves were recorded in the potential range of 0.3 to 1.0 V. As shown in Fig. 3e and Table S3,† where it is definitely observed that the half-wave potential of OER at 10 mA cm−2 for the Co3O4 nanosheets (0.843 V) is much lower than that of the Co3O4 nanoparticles (0.926 V) and Co3O4 bulks (0.971 V), and is close to that of the commercial RuO2 (0.807 V). Furthermore, the Tafel slope, revealing the relationship between overpotential and steady-state current density, is another crucial index to reflect OER activity.8 The smaller Tafel slope means a faster OER kinetic process. As shown in Fig. S8d and Table S4,† the lower Tafel slope for the Co3O4 nanosheets than for Co3O4 nanoparticles, Co3O4 bulks, and SP indicates the superior OER activity in Co3O4 nanosheets. In addition, the TOFs of different catalysts were also calculated to further prove the high intrinsic activity of the flower-like Co3O4 nanosheets (Table S4†). Although slightly lower than that of the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst, the TOF value of Co3O4 nanosheets is apparently higher than that of Co3O4 nanoparticles, Co3O4 bulks, and SP. This further confirms that Co3O4 sheets are also a promising excellent OER catalyst. The ΔE = (OER at 10 mA cm−2 − ORR at −1 mA cm−2) in Fig. 3f was calculated to be 1.056, 1.157, 1.225, and 1.214 V (vs. Hg/HgO) for Co3O4 nanosheets, Co3O4 nanoparticles, Co3O4 bulks, and RuO2, respectively, further confirming the high-efficiency bifunctional activity of the Co3O4 nanosheets.
From the above experimental results, it can be concluded that the unique Co3O4 nanosheets is a superior bifunctional catalyst for water splitting, which can be ascribed to its special morphology and crystal structure. The graphene-like ultrathin morphology not only makes Co3O4 nanosheets offer a large surface area and numerous active sites, but can also easily form massive defects to decrease surface energy, which are favorable for stability of the crystal and improvement of electrocatalytic properties.30,42 And the ordered self-assembly nature of the ultrathin sheets in forming a flower-like macrostructure can avoid the common restacking problems of 2D materials. This is also beneficial for mass transport and electron migration. In addition, the exposed crystal plane of Co3O4 crystal is closely linked with the intrinsic catalytic activity. Many early researches have confirmed that the exposed {100} and {110}, especially {110}, facets are more active and desirable for catalytic performance.24,44 Thus our Co3O4 nanosheets with the predominately exposed {100} and {110} planes (elaborated by above TEM analysis) are also responsible for its excellent activity, which actually may be ascribed to the increased ratio of surface Co3+/Co2+ and oxygen defects in Co3O4 nanosheets as confirmed by XPS.39,40 According to the unique structure and superior ORR/OER intrinsic performance, these ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets are probably also suitable as a bifunctional cathode catalyst for non-aqueous Li–O2 cells. Nevertheless, it's really not easy to investigate the ORR and OER properties in organic electrolytes, so the Co3O4 nanosheets were directly utilized as a cathode catalyst material for Li–O2 cells to systematically study its electrocatalytic properties.4,14
Li–O2 battery performance

Fig. 4 shows the CV curves of Co3O4 nanosheets and pure Super P based non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries. The ORR onset potentials at −0.07 mA cm−2 are 2.92 and 2.75 V for Co3O4 sheets and Super P electrodes, respectively, suggesting a lower ORR kinetic overpotential for the former.36 Furthermore, during the subsequent anodic scan, compared to the Super P electrode, the Co3O4 nanosheets exhibit three remarkable peaks at around 3.3, 3.9, and 4.4 V, which are probably the oxidation of discharge products and electrolyte. In all, Co3O4 nanosheets exhibit more obvious ORR/OER peaks and higher ORR/OER peak current density than Super P. These results suggest that Co3O4 nanosheets can be potentially used as an efficient bifunctional catalyst in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolyte.
 Fig. 4  
CV curves of the Co3O4 nanosheets and pure Super P based Li–O2 batteries. 

Fig. 5a shows the initial discharge–charge curves at 100 mA g−1 that the discharge capacity of Co3O4 nanosheets is about ∼8600 mA h g−1 with a very flat discharge plateau at 2.76 V and the overpotential is 1.31 V. This significantly improved electrochemical performance, compared to pure Super P-based electrodes, indicates that Co3O4 nanosheets possess superior ORR/OER kinetics properties, which is accordance with the CV measurement (Fig. 4). The effect of the Co3O4 nanosheet catalyst on the reaction kinetics of Li–O2 batteries was further examined, as depicted in Fig. 5b. Even with the increase of the current density, the discharge capacity reduced and the overpotential increased due to the enhancement of polarization current, the Li–O2 batteries still delivered high capacities of 6788, 5693, and 4610 mA h g−1 at 200, 500, and 1000 mA g−1, respectively, suggesting that Co3O4 sheets can effectively enhance the kinetics of non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries. In addition, the reversibility of the Co3O4 nanosheets-based Li–O2 cell was also studied under a limited capacity of 500 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1. As shown in Fig. 5c, after 80 cycles the terminal charge potential of the battery with Co3O4 nanosheet-based electrode is still below 4.4 V, while the battery charge voltage has been up to 4.4 V after only five cycles with Super P-based electrode (Fig. S9†). Under a cut-off charge voltage of 4.5 V, the Co3O4 nanosheet-based battery even achieves 160 cycles, and the corresponding terminal discharge voltage is still as high as ∼2.6 V, showing definitely better reversibility and cycling stability than that of Super P (Fig. S9†). From all the observed results, it can be inferred that the Co3O4 ultrathin nanosheets with a novel flower-like structure by hydrothermal self-assembly can be utilized as an efficient bifunctional catalyst in non-aqueous Li–O2 cells.

Characterization of discharge products in Li–O2 battery
To visually clarify and understand the discharge/charge processes with Co3O4 nanosheets cathodes, the components, morphologies, and reversibility of the discharge products were characterized by XRD and SEM, as depicted in Fig. 6. XRD patterns (Fig. 6a) indicate that the main discharge product of the Super P based electrode is Li2O2, which is a well-known product in non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries, in which the battery reaction can be generally expressed as 2(Li+ + e−) + O2 → Li2O2.11 Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the unexpected LiOH product can also be confirmed by XRD, which may be ascribed to the trace amount of moisture in the electrolyte.4,45 In contrast, the main product on the Co3O4 nanosheets based electrode is LiOH, and no other crystalline discharge product, even Li2O2, can be detected, as shown in Fig. 6b. Interestingly, after recharging, no peak can be observed by XRD, suggesting the reversible formation/decomposition of the LiOH product, which is consistent with some earlier reports.45–47Fig. 6e exhibits the SEM image of the Co3O4 nanosheets based electrode after initial discharge. However, different from the toroid morphology reported previously, corresponding to the formation of Li2O2,13,35 it can be clearly observed that lots of thick plate-like products are formed and stacked together, which is coincident with the morphology of the formed LiOH reported by other groups.48,49 This further indicates that the discharge product of the Co3O4 nanosheets based cathode is LiOH, instead of Li2O2. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6f, the morphology of the cathode could be practically recovered to its initial status, proving that the LiOH is completely decomposed. The SEM analyses are consistent with those acquired from XRD, which further indicates that the Co3O4 nanosheets can efficiently catalyze the formation/decomposition of LiOH in DMSO-based Li–O2 batteries.

As XRD only detects crystalline products, we further used UV/Vis spectroscopy for quantitative analysis of the Li2O2 product to determine the main discharge product and get some insight into the reaction mechanism of the Li–O2 battery.35,50 Firstly, the cathode after discharge was immersed into an aqueous TiOSO4 solution to form H2O2 by the reaction between peroxides/super oxides products, on the cathode, and water. Once H2O2 was generated, the original colorless solutions immediately turned yellow owing to the formation of a [TiO22+] complex, with a maximum light absorption at about 408 nm.36,50 This photometric detection of the formed complex allows the quantification of even small amounts of Li2O2 discharge products on the cathode. For the quantification of Li2O2 products, the standard absorbance spectra and Lambert–Beer type fitting curve were recorded by testing various known concentrations of Li2O2 solutions with a UV-Visible spectrometer, as shown in Fig. S10.†Fig. 7a shows the photograph of cathodes at different discharge states after being immersed in a certain amount of aqueous TiOSO4 solution. A deeper color of SP based cathodes than that of the Co3O4 nanosheets based cathodes under the same conditions can be observed, which indicates the greater Li2O2 formation of the former. The extinction curve (Fig. 7b) and Lambert–Beer type data (Fig. 7c) also indicates the much bigger absorbance of SP based cathodes than that of corresponding Co3O4 based cathodes. To calculate the Li2O2 yield for accurate comparison, the determined mass of Li2O2 per electrode at different discharge states is related to the expected Li2O2, this is supposing that all charges during discharge are consumed for Li2O2 formation (2e−/Li2O2). The obtained Li2O2 percent yields are given in Table 1, it further proves that the main product of the SP based cathode is Li2O2, while the Co3O4 nanosheets based cathode should be LiOH as the proportion of Li2O2 is very small. This result coincides with that of XRD analysis. Furthermore, the increase of Li2O2 yield with increase of discharge capacities either in SP based or Co3O4 nanosheets based cathodes is ascribed to the trace moisture introduced by the electrolyte, which can react with superoxide/peroxide to form a certain amount of LiOH, resulting in a lower Li2O2 yield at the low discharge capacity.

To further demonstrate that the thick plate-like product is LiOH rather than some amorphous carbonate such as Li2CO3, the raw EDS maps of the Co3O4 based cathode after its first discharge can be found in Fig. 8 and Fig. S11.† The atomic percentage of the O element in the discharged electrode was significantly increased, indicating the formation of oxygen-containing species. More importantly, the EDS maps in the area of the plate-like discharge product showed an apparently stronger O signal, uniform C signal, and the relatively weaker Co signal. In this regard, it can be speculated that this plate-like product is Li2O2 or LiOH, and not Li2CO3.45 The product, with a similar flower-like structure to that of the pristine Co3O4 catalyst, is supposed to be nucleated on the surface of Co3O4 nanosheets. When further coupled with XRD and UV/Vis spectroscopy results, it can be inferred that LiOH is the main component of the plate-like product.

Role of Co3O4 nanosheets in Li–O2 battery
Based on the above results and analyses, it is suggested that LiOH and Li2O2 both formed during the discharge process for Co3O4 nanosheet based, and SP based Li–O2 batteries. Interestingly, the mainly reversible product of the Co3O4 based battery is LiOH, contrary to that of SP. This shows that except for the small quantity of LiOH in the Co3O4 based Li–O2 cell, formed by the reaction between Li2O2 with trace water from electrolyte, as observed in the SP based Li–O2 battery, the majority must be produced via other mechanisms. However, except for water, only DMSO can offer a proton to form LiOH, and moreover, the only difference between batteries is the addition of Co3O4 nanosheets as a catalyst. This result indicates conclusively that the Co3O4 nanosheet catalyst promotes the decomposition of DMSO to produce substantial LiOH as a main product. In fact, the cathode catalyst in Li–O2 batteries can facilitate electrolyte decomposition under certain conditions. For example, McCloskey's group investigated the role of electrocatalysts in non-aqueous rechargeable Li–O2 cells and showed that some catalysts like Pt can catalyze DME decomposition.51 Geaney et al.45 recently also reported that MnO2 can promote side reactions related to both sulfolane and DMSO based electrolytes during the discharge process. It can be concluded that the stability of the electrolyte cannot be considered in isolation, due to that a ‘stable’ electrolyte for one cathode may be unstable when in contact with another cathode.
To further explain the formation of LiOH with the assistance of Co3O4 nanosheets, a mechanism was proposed as given in Fig. 9. According to the BET and TEM results, Co3O4 nanosheets have a large specific surface area with the dominantly exposed facets of {110} and {100} displaying high activity, which can also promote the adsorption and dissociation of O2 on its surface and improve the mobility of lattice oxygen. The efficient ORR and OER activity for both aqueous and non-aqueous media has also been confirmed by RDE and CV characterization. In the presence of Co3O4 nanosheets, the oxygen will preferentially adsorb on its surface and quickly dissociate into O2−. The DMSO, due to its high donor number, can stabilize the Li+ species,45 with the transfer of Li+ being limited by diffusion dynamics, while O2− remains very active. This will lead to two possible reaction paths, that is, O2− will directly couple with neighboring Li+ to form LiO2 based on eqn (1), and alternatively it's also possible that O2− acts as a base to remove the weakly acidic protons of DMSO through catalysis on the Co3O4 nanosheets according to eqn (2).52 And subsequently, the resulting LiO2 will be further converted to Li2O2via a disproportionation reaction due to its thermodynamic instability based on eqn (3). LiOH can then be formed directly from H2O by reaction with Li2O2 according to eqn (4).53 Alternatively, LiOH can also be formed in solution according to eqn (5).52 When considering the main product of the thick plate-like LiOH formed on the surface of Co3O4 nanosheets and a small amount of Li2O2 present, as demonstrated by UV/Vis, it can be intensively inferred that the two pathways involved in O2− radical formation both exist, and the Li2O2 does mainly form by a surface mechanism,54 and subsequently converts into a LiOH coating on the surface of Co3O4 by reacting with water. In this way, due to the limitation of active sites on the Co3O4 surface, Li2O2 will nucleate and grow in a limited direction and results in the final product of LiOH covering the Co3O4 sheets with a plate-like structure and hence stacked into a flower shape, similar to that of a pristine Co3O4 catalyst. O2− + Li+ → LiO2(1) CH3SOCH3 + O2− → CH3SOCH2− + H2O(2) LiO2 + LiO2 → O2 + Li2O2(3) Li2O2 + H2O → 2LiOH + 1/2O2(4) H2O + Li+ + e− → LiOH + 1/2O2(5)

Conclusions
In this work, a unique flower-like structure Co3O4 catalyst, assembled by graphene-like ultrathin nanosheets, was fabricated via a solvothermal self-assembly method and investigated as a ORR and OER bifunctional catalyst for both water splitting and non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries. Due to the large surface area, hierarchical porous, and predominantly exposed planes of {110} and {100} with high activity, the resulting Co3O4 nanosheets exhibit an excellent ORR and OER performance in alkaline medium, with a remarkably small potential difference of 1.056 V (ΔE = OER at 10 mA cm−2 − ORR at −1 mA cm−2), which is superior to Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. Moreover, as a traditional bifunctional catalyst applied to DMSO based Li–O2 batteries, the cell also shows a significant improvement in electrochemical performance. However, further investigation demonstrated that Co3O4 nanosheets can not only promote the reversible formation/decomposition of the discharge product and improve battery performance, but also can facilitate the decomposition of DMSO. A possible mechanism was proposed to explain the main product formation of LiOH with a unique morphology. This result indicates that the role of a traditional bifunctional catalyst in non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries should be seriously and comprehensively assessed, and the compatibility between the cathode catalyst and electrolyte should also be carefully considered.
