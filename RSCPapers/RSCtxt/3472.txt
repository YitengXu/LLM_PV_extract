    , Accepted 22nd June 2021First published on 13th July 2021AbstractPhotocatalytic water splitting technology, utilizing solar energy, water resources and suitable photocatalysts to produce hydrogen, holds great promise to deal with the current energy crisis. The construction of van der Waals heterostructures has shown great prospects in photocatalytic water splitting because of their unique physical mechanism. Here, using the first principles calculations, we comprehensively investigated a C2N/ZnSe heterostructure constructed by C2N and ZnSe monolayers, both of which have been successfully fabricated in the experiment. The results show that the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure has favorable direct band gap and typical type-II band alignment, ensuring that the photogenerated electrons and holes are effectively separated. Moreover, the band edges of the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure satisfy the energy level of water oxidation and reduction at pH = 0. In addition, carrier mobility and exciton binding energy calculations show that the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure possesses ultrahigh electron mobilities and low exciton binding energy, indicating its high photocatalytic activity and low carrier recombination rate. Furthermore, the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure exhibits a strong visible light-absorption ability (up to 2.35 × 105 cm−1), which is beneficial to improve its photocatalytic efficiency. Such excellent electronic and optical properties along with high carrier mobility and low exciton binding energy help the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure to be a potential promising photocatalyst for future experimental design.
I. Introduction
Considering the deficiency of fossil fuels and the deterioration of ecological environment, it is imperative and necessary to pursue alternative sources of energy, which possess environmentally friendly, cost-cutting and renewable characteristics.1,2 Given water is one of the amplest resources and solar energy is an inexhaustible source, seeking a suitable and efficient photocatalysts to realize photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production is regarded as one of the most promising methods to utilize clean energy. Since titanium oxide (TiO2) as a photocatalyst achieved the overall water splitting experimentally,3,4 numerous photocatalysts, including metal oxides, nitrides, sulfides and some other novel types of bulk materials, have been reported to catalyze water decomposition.5–9 However, the low solar utilization and insensitivity of spectral response of bulk materials would make them encounter a bottleneck and hinder their further development to be high-efficiency photocatalysts.
Two-dimensional (2D) materials exfoliated from their bulk materials, possessing large surface-volume ratio, high carrier mobility and decent band structure, have drawn increasing interest in photocatalysts for water splitting since the inception of monolayer graphene.10–12 In the past few years, numerous fresh 2D materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and MXene, have been theoretically and experimentally investigated as photocatalysts, showing great potentials for photocatalytic water splitting.13–17 Unfortunately, although isolated 2D materials can provide efficient redox reactions in comparison with the bulk counterparts, they usually cannot efficiently separate the photo-generated electron–hole pairs, thereby leading to low efficiency.18 The van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure proposed in 2013 was based on two layers of lattice-matching 2D materials with vdW forces, which indicates that the heterostructure could retain the electronic and optical properties of both the monolayers,19,20 therefore providing a new approach for photocatalysts. More importantly, it has been demonstrated that the type-II heterostructure can effectively realize the separation of photo-generated electron–holes to different sheets for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reduction (HER).21,22 Recently, various such type-II heterostructures such as PtS2/arsenene, InSe/Zr2CO2, and In2SeS/g-C3N4 have been studied to show parallel mechanisms of charge separation.23–28 Accordingly, search for appropriate 2D materials to construct type-II heterostructures opens up broad prospects for the photocatalytic decomposition of water to produce hydrogen.
C2N nanosheet, a graphene-like analogue possessing a natural holy structure, has been synthesized via a simple wet–chemical reaction method.29 Compared with the graphitic C3N4, monolayer C2N has better visible light absorption, which indicates that it has potential in optoelectronic applications.30 More interestingly, 2D C2N is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 2.47 eV and has a high on/off ratio of 107.29 These characteristics have stimulated an upsurge of investigation on C2N-based heterostructures.31–35 As for 2D ZnSe, one of the inorganic graphene analogs (IGAs), was also successfully fabricated from the bulk zinc blende structure, possessing large surface area and honeycomb lattice.36 In addition, it was reported that 2D ZnSe shows 8 times higher photocurrent density than that of ZnSe quantum dots, and about 200 times higher than that of ZnSe bulk.37 For these features, the ZnSe monolayer has good applications in photonic nanodevices and is a potential photocatalyst for water splitting.36,38,39
Based on the above discussions, herein, we comprehensively predicted the structural, electronic and optical properties of the C2N/ZnSe vdW heterostructure according to density functional theory (DFT). The heterostructure shows a moderate direct type-II band structure and favorable band edge positions, which benefit the separation of photogenerated carriers and are suitable for water oxidation and reduction. The carrier mobility and exciton binding energy calculations show that the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure possesses ultrahigh electron mobilities and low exciton binding energies, verifying its high photocatalytic activity and low carrier recombination rate. Moreover, the optical properties of the heterostructure also show outstanding visible light-absorption ability. Thus, the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure can be expected to be a promising photocatalytic material to produce hydrogen in the future.
II. Computational methodology
Based on the density functional theory, all the calculations in this study were performed by first principles calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).40 The most popular generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was utilized to describe the exchange–correlation energy and potential.41 The DFT-D3 method of Grimme was taken to describe weak vdW interactions.42 The kinetic energy cut-off value was set as 520 eV and the Monkhorst–Pack mesh of 5 × 5 × 1 k-point grids was used to sample the Brillouin zone (BZ). The energy was converged within 1 × 10−5 eV per atom, and the Hellmann–Feynman force on each atom was less than 0.02 eV Å−1. A vacuum layer of 28 Å along the z-direction was chosen to avoid the effects of spurious interactions between the two layers. Considering PBE functional underestimates the bandgap due to the presence of artificial self-interactions, we used the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional to accurately determine the bandedge positions and light absorption spectrum.43
To assess the vdW interactions between the monolayer C2N and ZnSe, we defined the binding energy (Eb) as: Eb = EC2N/ZnSe − EC2N − EZnSe(1)where EC2N/ZnSe, EC2N and EZnSe are the total energies of the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure, C2N monolayer, and ZnSe monolayer, respectively. The plane-averaged charge density difference Δρ(z) was used to observe the charge redistribution along the z-direction perpendicular to the heterojunction, which can be described by the following equation: Δρ = ρC2N/ZnSe − ρC2N − ρC2N/ZnSe,(2)in which ρC2N/ZnSe is the plane-averaged charge density of the C2N/ZnSe, and ρC2N and ρZnSe are the charge distribution of free monolayer C2N and ZnSe, respectively. The positive values indicate charge accumulation and the negative values indicate charge depletion. In addition, the amount of transferred electrons up to z-direction is given by the equation:. The optical absorption properties of the pristine C2N and ZnSe monolayers and C2N/ZnSe heterostructure are simulated by converting the dielectric function to the absorption coefficient αabs using the following relation:44 (3)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary part of the dielectric function ε(ω), respectively, and ω is the frequency (in cm−1).
III. Results and discussion
Initially, we optimized the atomic structures of C2N and ZnSe monolayers, which are shown in the left panel of Fig. 1(a and c). The lattice constants of the optimized C2N and ZnSe monolayers were obtained as 8.33 and 4.09 Å, respectively. A 1 × 1 × 1 C2N supercell and a 2 × 2 × 1 ZnSe supercell were used to construct the C2N/ZnSe vdW heterostructure, showing a quite small lattice mismatch of 1.8%. In addition, the band structures of C2N and ZnSe monolayers were computed by PBE functional and HSE06 hybrid functional, as displayed in the right panel of Fig. 1(b and d). It can be clearly seen that the band shapes are basically the same except the differences of bandgap values. Moreover, we can see that both of them are direct bandgap semiconductors with both the conduction band minima (CBM) and valence band minima (VBM) located at Γ point, and the corresponding bandgaps are 2.47 eV (1.66) and 2.97 eV (1.80) for C2N and ZnSe monolayers at HSE06 (PBE) level, respectively. Moreover, the high-symmetry points in the first Brillouin area are also presented in the inset of Fig. 1(b and d). All the above-mentioned results are in good agreement with the earlier literature.45–49

Then, the structural properties of C2N/ZnSe heterostructures were investigated to search for the most stable configuration. For the vertical C2N/ZnSe heterostructures, there exist four possible typical stacking configurations, including stacking-A, stacking-B, stacking-C and stacking-D, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The structural parameters such as lattice parameters, interlayer binding energies and interlayer distances of these optimized configurations are summarized in Table 1. Clearly, stacking-B possesses the lowest binding energy of −12.1 meV Å−2, indicating that the stacking-B C2N/ZnSe heterostructure is the most stable structure among all the stacking configurations. Moreover, this value is larger than the reported PbI2/SnSe2 heterostructure (−10.4 meV Å−2)26 and the typical vdW crystals like graphite (−12 meV Å−2),50 revealing that the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure is a vdW heterostructure. Thus, only the stacking-B C2N/ZnSe heterostructure was taken into consideration in all the subsequent investigations. In addition, the thermal stability of the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure was also investigated by performing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with 5 ps at 300 K. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the fact that the free energy converges with respect to the simulation step validates the thermal stability of the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure.

Subsequently, based on the HSE06 hybrid functional calculation, the projected band structure of the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure is depicted in Fig. 3(a). It can be found that the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure preserves the characteristic of a semiconductor with a direct band structure, which potentially has higher solar energy conversion efficiency. To be specific, both the VBM and CBM are located at the Γ point, having a bandgap of 2.25 eV, which conforms to the minimum requirement for water splitting (1.23 eV). Moreover, the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure is a type-II vdW heterostructure, indicating that the VBM is dominated by the ZnSe monolayer (sky-blue dot), while the CBM is primarily attributed to the C2N monolayer (yellow dot). It has been established that such characteristics in band structures will spontaneously separate the free holes and electrons, which will improve the utilization of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, in Fig. 3(b), the total density of states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure were obtained by HSE06 functional calculations. It can be seen that the peak with the lowest energy above the Fermi level mainly originates from the p orbital of C and N atoms, whereas the highest energy below the Fermi level is basically contributed by the d states of Zn atoms. Furthermore, the decomposed charge densities of VBM and CBM were calculated and displayed in Fig. 4(a), in which the CBM is from C and N atoms, while the VBM is mainly dominated by Zn atoms. Therefore, from all the above analysis and results, the type-II nature of the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure has been certified, which makes the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure conducive to the suppression of the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.

(d) Electrostatic potentials for the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure. 
For further exploration of the internal charge transfer mechanism of the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure, the planar-averaged charge density difference and the charge density difference (CDD) were calculated, which are plotted in Fig. 4(b and c), respectively. The charge density is reconstructed next to the heterointerface region, depleted near the C2N monolayer due to negative Δρ and accumulated close to the ZnSe monolayer because of the positive Δρ. Furthermore, the Bader charge analysis shows that total 0.023 |e| number of electrons transfer from C2N to the ZnSe layer. To elucidate the charge transfer between the interfaces, the work function and plane-averaged electrostatic potential could also make effective verification. The calculated work functions are 5.90, 5.83 and 5.82 eV for ZnSe, C2N and C2N/ZnSe, respectively, as displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 4(d). The potential drop (ΔVH) across the bilayer is found to be 7.47 eV. Consequently, the difference in the work function and electrostatic potential between the C2N and ZnSe monolayer will lead to charge remigration at the interfaces. This charge movement will induce a dipole across the surface, thus resulting in the formation of a built-in electric field at the interface of C2N/ZnSe heterostructure. This built-in electric field will generate a driving force to impede the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole between the holes in the valence band (VB) of ZnSe and electrons in the conduction band (CB) of C2N (path 3), as depicted in Fig. 5(b).

Moreover, to utilize solar energy, suitable band edge positions for the oxidation and reduction potentials are other indispensable prerequisites for the photocatalytic material. It should be noted that the potential of CBM for the photocatalyst needs to be higher than the standard hydrogen potential (EH+/H2) while that of the VBM needs to be lower than the standard oxygen potential (EO2/H2O) to conform to the fundamental requirement of a redox reaction. The band edges of ZnSe layer, C2N layer and C2N/ZnSe heterostructure as a function of the water reduction and oxidation potential levels at pH = 0 are illustrated in Fig. 5(a). We can clearly find that the CBM of ZnSe monolayer is larger than that of C2N monolayer while for VBM the trend is opposite, which makes it possible to form a type-II heterostructure. After the heterostructure is formed, values of the potential at VBM and CBM for C2N/ZnSe are −6.53 and −4.28 eV, respectively, which are lower than the standard hydrogen potential (−5.67 eV) and higher than the oxygen potential (−4.44 eV). Therefore, owing to the favorable band edges, it is anticipated that the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure will be a prospective photocatalyst for overall water splitting. Furthermore, the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes in the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure is plotted in Fig. 5(b). The calculated conduction band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO) are 0.6 and 0.09 eV, respectively. This will facilitate the migration of photoinduced electrons from the CB of ZnSe to the CB of C2N and the photoinduced holes from VB of C2N to VB of ZnSe (path 1 and 2 in Fig. 5(b)). As CBM resides on the ZnSe monolayer, the oxidation evolution reactions will take place on it. Simultaneously, the hydrogen evolution reactions will happen on the C2N layer, owing to the presence of VBM on it.
Carrier mobility is another significant contributing factor, which has an important influence on the catalytic activity of a photocatalyst.51 Here, based on the deformation potential (DP) theory,52 the carrier mobility of the monolayers and heterostructure were calculated and are shown below, (4)where Ei is the deformation potential and is given by Ei = ∂E/∂ε,53 and E is the energy of the VBM for holes and CBM for the electrons. C2D is the elastic modulus of the material along the transport direction and it is defined as , where S0, ε and Etot are the area of the relaxed unit cell, uniaxial strain and the total energy, respectively. is the effective mass of the charge carrier along the transport direction and it is calculated by . Besides,  is the average effective mass along the two orthogonal directions and it can be defined as . The temperature T = 300 K was used here. To conveniently calculate the carrier effective mass, hexagonal lattice was transformed into an orthogonal lattice and then the uniaxial strain was applied in two orthogonal directions, x and y directions. The effective mass of holes and electrons in the x and y directions near VBM and CBM were calculated, which can be seen in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The computational processes of C2D and Ei are presented in Fig. S5–S7) (ESI†) and the final values of C2D, , Ei and μ2D are summarized in Table 2.

For the C2N monolayer, electron mobility in the x(y) direction is up to 4663.09 (2190.00) cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the hole mobility in the x(y) direction is just 2.06 (6.26) cm2 V−1 s−1. This can be traced back to the light electron effective mass and heavy hole effective mass of the C2N monolayer. For the 2D ZnSe, the mobility of electron and hole in the x(y) direction ranges from 633.11 to 1394.01 cm2 V−1 s−1. Moreover, it can be found that for the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure, the calculated hole mobilities (206.97 and 134.01 cm2 V−1 s−1) in both the x and y direction exhibit noticeable enhancements in comparison with those of the C2N monolayer. The electron mobility is 4749.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 (6416.84 cm2 V−1 s−1) in the x(y) direction, which is relatively large compared to the C2N and ZnSe monolayers. Owing to the ultrahigh electron mobilities and extraordinary improvement in the hole mobilities, we can expect that the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure will have favorable photocatalytic activity.
To further qualitatively evaluate the separation of charge carrier, the exciton binding energies (Eeb) was calculated by the Mott–Wannier hydrogenic model:54 (5) (6)where μex and ε are the effective exciton mass and the macroscopic static dielectric constant. It is the sum contributions from the electronic (εel) and ionic (εion). It has been proved that a lower value of Eeb means that the electrons and holes are more easily separated into free charge carriers. The calculated values of εel, εion, and Eeb are summarized in Table 3. It can be seen that the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure possesses a low exciton binding energy of 33 meV, which is lower than both the C2N (88 meV) and ZnSe (44 meV) monolayers and early reported heterostructure.55

In consideration of the fact that about two-fifths of solar energy consists of visible light, so it is of great significance for photocatalyst to possess excellent optical performance in the visible region. On account of the ability of materials to absorb visible light depending on their absorption coefficients, we calculated the absorption coefficients for C2N, ZnSe monolayer and C2N/ZnSe heterostructure using HSE06 hybrid functional method, and are displayed in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the C2N monolayer shows high absorption coefficient in the visible light region (photon energy ranging from 1.62 to 3.11 eV), up to 2.86 × 105 cm−1 located at the photon energy of 3.11 eV, corresponding to previous works.45,56 The ZnSe monolayer exhibits weak visible light absorption capacity, which can be attributed to its wide band gap. The optical absorption ability of C2N/ZnSe heterostructure is better than the C2N monolayer when the photon energy ranges from 2.0 to 2.5 eV. Furthermore, the peak value of C2N/ZnSe heterostructure is up to 2.35 × 105 cm−1 around the photon energy of 3.11 eV, which is larger than the reported C2N/g-C3N4 heterostructure.56 Therefore, it is expected that C2N/ZnSe heterostructure can act as an efficient visible light-harvesting photocatalyst.

IV. Conclusions
To sum up, we discussed the structural, electronic, transport and optical properties of the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure via the density functional theory (DFT). Through the vdW-corrected hybrid functional calculations, we have predicted that the 2D C2N/ZnSe heterostructure is a direct bandgap semiconductor with type-II band alignment and possesses suitable band edge positions for water oxidation and reduction at pH = 0. Also, the potential drop and charge transfer taking place between the monolayer further facilitate the separation of photoinduced carriers via a built-in electric field. Carrier mobility analysis was performed based on deformation potential theory and it shows high carrier mobilities in the heterostructure, indicating its high photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the optical absorption coefficient calculations show that the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure has an excellent absorption coefficient in the visible light region, reaching up to 2.35 × 105 cm−1. Based on the above analysis and discussion, we can anticipate that the C2N/ZnSe heterostructure will be a prospective candidate as a catalyst for photocatalytic water splitting.
