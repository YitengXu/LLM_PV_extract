1. Introduction
There have been unprecedented rapid developments in organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) being increased from 3.8% to 24.2% over the past 7 years,1,2 making them the most promising photovoltaic technologies. The improvement is attributed to the unique optoelectronic characteristics of halide perovskites, such as high absorption coefficient,3,4 excellent carrier mobility,5,6 long carrier diffusion length,7–9 and low trap state.10,11 Despite the rapid growth in efficiency, the poor stability becomes a bottle neck toward practical deployment. For example, halide perovskite materials (methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)) are intrinsically vulnerable to moisture, light, and heat, making them to easily decompose or volatilize.12 In order to improve the stability of PSC, several strategies are proposed: (1) modifying the light-absorbing perovskite material by composition engineering of organic cations or halides;13–15 (2) utilizing hydrophobic additives or surface self-assembly techniques for the perovskite thin films;16,17 (3) introducing a moisture-proof or anti-UV functional layer at the interface between the light-absorbing layer and the charge transport layer;18–20 and (4) developing an encapsulation technology for the entire device.21–23
Recently, two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper (2DRP) perovskites have exhibited to be the most intrinsic and promising options to achieve PSCs with long-term stability, arousing great research interest.24 Since 2014, 2DRP phase perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 has been used for photovoltaic devices for the first time; the PCE of 2DRP perovskite devices has reached an unprecedented breakthrough from the initial 4.73% (ref. 25) to 17.4% (ref. 26) in the past five years (Fig. 1b). In further pursuit of higher efficiency, 2D/3D mixed perovskites prepared from a mixture precursor solution of 2D and 3D components by one- or two-step methods and 2D/3D dual-layered perovskites obtained by depositing a thin 2D perovskite layer on top of a 3D perovskite film have also been launched in 2015 and 2016, respectively, showing comparable efficiency and improved stability to the conventional 3D analogs. The major perovskite phases in 2DRP perovskites are low-dimensional perovskites with a little loading of 3D perovskite, while the major perovskite phase of 2D/3D mixed perovskite is 3D perovskite with a little loading of low-dimensional perovskites. A 2DRP perovskite is a typical layered perovskite structure consisting of inorganic perovskite layers intercalated with organic cation spacers. Its formation can be attributed to the incorporation of large aliphatic or alkylammonium cations, such as butylammonium (BA) and phenethylammonium (PEA), into the conventional 3D perovskite lattice, where the inorganic layer is separated. Based on the valence of the large ammonium cation, the general formula of 2DRP perovskite is (R-NH3)2Mn−1AnX3n+1, (R: a large aromatic or aliphatic alkylammonium cation; M: Cs+, CH3NH3+ or HC(NH2)2+; A: Pb2+, Sn2+ or Ge2+; X: a halide ion; n: the number of perovskite layers).27–29 The introduction of large organic spacers makes RP perovskites exhibit superior stabilities: (i) humidity stability. The organic spacers are typical hydrophobic organic ammonium cations, which can prevent water molecules from penetrating into the perovskite crystal lattice.25 (ii) Structure stability. The strong van der Waals forces of the organic layers render a higher formation energy to the RP perovskites, ensuring improved structure stability.30,31 (iii) Thermal stability. The formation of a small amount of RP structure can successfully inhibit the low-temperature phase transition of CsPbI3 and FAPbI3, and make α-CsPbI3 and α-FAPbI3 stable at room temperature.32–34

(c) The quantum well structure, formed by alternating semiconductor inorganic sheets with organic layers having a wider band gap. 
However, in addition to the impressive stability of the 2DRP perovskites, they also show unfavorable characteristics considering the key optoelectronic processes for PSCs, i.e., light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, and charge extraction. Firstly, the bandgap (Eg) of the 2DRP perovskite structure is much larger than that of its 3D counterparts, which results in weaker absorption of the visible spectrum. For example, the bandgap (Eg) values of BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 and PEA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 are up to 2.24 eV (ref. 35) and 2.35 eV,36 respectively, for n = 1, while the Eg of MAPbI3 is only 1.54 eV.37 Secondly, the separation of electrons and holes is more difficult to be achieved at room temperature due to the higher exciton binding energy (Eb) of the 2DRP perovskite structure, while the 3D structure belongs to the Wannier type with small exciton binding energy.38,39 Thirdly, the organic spacer acts as an insulating material to largely suppress charge carrier transport, increasing charge accumulation and non-radiative recombination at the interface. Finally, the charge extraction can also be hindered by the insulation of the organic spacers. These unfavorable characteristics make the efficiency of RP-based PSCs fall behind its 3D counterpart. Therefore, the current important goal of the research based on 2DRP perovskites is to ensure the stability of the device while maximizing the efficiency.
In this perspective, we distill the current state-of-the-art 2DRP perovskites and highlight the distinctive characteristics of the 2DRP perovskites compared to their 3D counterparts. The enhanced stability, quantum well structure, tunable exciton binding energy, out-of-plane oriented growth, and phase distribution of RP perovskites are discussed. Finally, we briefly assess the current challenges and future perspectives of RP perovskites as a new class of photovoltaic materials.
2. Unique properties of 2DRP perovskites
2DRP perovskites are derived by slicing the conventional 3D perovskite lattice with large organic spacers. Compared to conventional 3D perovskites, unique properties are generated in 2DRP including enhanced stability, tunable exciton binding energy, out-of-plane crystal growth, and multiphase blending, which accommodate a wide variety of opportunities to achieve long-term stability and high-performance of PSCs.
2.1 Enhanced stability
The most prominent feature of 2DRP perovskites compared to the conventional 3D perovskites is their greatly enhanced stability. The origins of the stability are explained in terms of high formation energy, hydrophobic ammonium cations, inhibition of ion migration and low-temperature phase transition.

2.1.1 High formation energy. 
One of the most crucial factors affecting the long-term stability of PSCs is the active material itself. Although the conventional 3D perovskites MAPbI3 have shown rapid progress in the PCE of PSCs, the active materials themselves hinder the long-term stability of the devices. Experimental and theoretical studies have approved that the conventional 3D perovskites have low formation energy (E), leading to the decomposition to their precursors MAI and PbI2.40 Quan et al. introduced a quantitative van der Waals interaction through the intercalation of phenethylammonium (PEA) between the perovskite layers.31 This mixed-cationic perovskite material exhibited an increased formation energy (more negative) and therefore should improve the material stability, and butylammonium (BA) had also been shown to have a similar effect.25 The energy required to decompose the solid MAI and PEAI into a gaseous state in perovskite is 2.15 eV and 2.51 eV, respectively. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the formation energy and film lifetime decrease with increasing n values.31  
This indicates that under thermal stress, MAI escapes from the perovskite surface more easily than PEAI, leaving an unstable PbI2 framework. Therefore, the introduction of organic spacers can successfully reduce the degradation of perovskites.


2.1.2 Hydrophobicity of ammonium salts. 
Organic cations in the conventional 3D perovskites are more sensitive and vulnerable than other ions to the ambient environment, leading to the disintegration of the perovskites back into their precursors when exposed to moisture. Fluorinated compounds are well known to have high hydrophobicity.41 For the first time, Bi et al. introduced a new type of fluorinated cation – 1,1,1-trifluoro-ethyl ammonium iodide (FEAI) – into perovskite solar cells.42 The fluorinated cation is encapsulated on the surface of the perovskite, and the hydrophobic CF3 groups on it are outwardly exposed, improving the moisture resistance without forming a 2D perovskite which affects the efficiency. Zheng and colleagues26 systematically studied the hydrophobic properties of different ammonium salts by comparing four typical ammonium salts: C6H5CH2NH3I (BEI), (CH3)2NH2I (DII), IH3N(CH2)3NH3I (PRI2), and IH3N(CH2)4NH3I (BUI2). The hydrophobicity of the ammonium salt increases as the amount of carbon in the hydrocarbon chain increases, and decreases as the hydrophilic amino group increases. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of the four ammonium salts is as follows: PR2+ < BU2+ < DI+ < BE+. The BE-based 2D perovskite film remained unchanged after 240 hours of exposure to RH 80%, showing high moisture resistance.


2.1.3 Suppressed ion migration. 
Ion migration (MA+ or I−) has been identified to be intrinsic in the conventional 3D perovskites due to the low ion-migration activation energy.43–45 Under an electric field of the operating PSCs, a large amount of mobile ions (MA+ or I−) diffuse in the perovskite films, which create lots of vacancies and defects as non-radiative recombination centers in the perovskite films. Besides, the migration feature of the organic cations also facilitates their departure from the Pb–I framework under light, accelerating the decomposition of the 3D perovskites.46 Lin et al.43 proposed an effective way to suppress the ion migration by the formation of RP perovskites. By the incorporation of organic n-butylammonium (BA) spacers, a RP (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 is formed with a large constant ion migration activation energy of up to 41 ± 7 meV compared to its 3D counterparts with 0.19 eV in the dark and 0.03 eV under 0.25 sun illumination (Fig. 2c). Consequently, ion migration is inhibited in the RP perovskites, indicating a better stability of these materials for PSCs.

2.1.4 High phase stability. 
The all-inorganic perovskite analog cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) exhibits outstanding thermal stability due to its relatively wide band gap (Eg) and large band widths.32,47,48 However, the black α-CsPbI3 perovskite with a narrow Eg of 1.7 eV, which is suitable for solar cell operation, is prone to phase transformation at low temperature, resulting in a yellow non-perovskite phase (Fig. 2d) (δ-CsPbI3, NH4CdCl3 structural type) with a wider band gap of 2.82 eV, which demonstrates poor transport properties.49–51 It has been previously reported in the literature that the stable existence of the α-CsPbI3 phase depends on the crystallite size of CsPbI3, which is possible by trimming the size of the α-CsPbI3 grain to the nano-resistance.32,33 In addition, Zhang et al. found that the introduction of a small amount of 2D (EDAPbI4) perovskite containing ethylenediamine (EDA) cation stabilized α-CsPbI3 to avoid the undesired formation of a non-perovskite delta phase.34 Furthermore, the DFT calculations demonstrate that the formation energy of the hexagonal FAPbI3 phase (−4.93 eV) is more negative than that of the cubic FAPbI3 phase (−4.48 eV), confirming that the hexagonal phase is indeed more stable than the cubic phase at room temperature. In combination with the high formation energy of the 2D perovskite discussed above, Fu et al. used PEA with a more negative formation energy to achieve surface termination to reduce surface energy, thereby promoting the retention of the cubic phase FAPbI3 in the nanostructure.52

2.2 Tunable exciton binding energy
The layered structure of the 2DRP perovskites provides tunable exciton binding energy and band gaps as well as alternative spacer cations for material optimization. The 2DRP perovskites affect the optical band gap (Eg) by adjusting the value of n to achieve optimal optical performance.53 The total amount of Eg depends on the Eg value of 3D perovskite and the additional quantized energy of the electrons and holes.54 In addition, the differences in organic spacer cations can also have an effect on Eg. For example, PEI55 as a polyammonium cation has a stronger interaction between the organic–inorganic layer than BA, so that the former has a smaller band gap than the latter.56,57 Compared to that in 3D perovskites, the quantum well confinement effect in 2DRP leads to an increase in binding energy due to the formation of excitons rather than free carriers.58 As the thickness of the inorganic layer decreases (the value of n decreases), the quantum well confinement effect is enhanced, which is represented by exciton absorption and emission peaks in a low-wavelength range, accompanied by a blue shift phenomenon (Fig. 3a and b).59,60 Theoretically, the high exciton binding of the 2D structure promotes the combination of injected electrons and holes, which is suitable for the application in LEDs.61 It has recently been discovered that multiple quantum wells can be assembled in 2D perovskites, which promotes the formation of excitons and reduces the possibility of exciton dissociation, making 2D perovskites effective luminescent materials (Fig. 3c and d).62,63 Studies have shown that in polymorphic mixed perovskites, electron–hole enrichment exists in the large n phase because the hole transfer rate is slower than the electron transfer rate. This electron–hole enrichment makes the large n phase a radiative recombination center, which is advantageous for high external quantum efficiency (EQE) LED devices.64,65 You's group achieved 14.36% EQE and surface passivation through the strategic use of carrier combinations.66 However, this characteristic exhibits a completely opposite effect in solar cells compared to that in LED devices. The local enrichment of the carrier is detrimental to its transport and collection, thereby reducing the device performance.

2.3 Layer-edge state
Due to the multiple quantum well structure in the 2D layered perovskite, the layer-edge has a unique organic–inorganic staggered super-lattice pattern perpendicular to the super-lattice plane. Cheng et al.68 studied the transmission properties of a layer-edge surface device of 2D hybrid perovskites, demonstrating that dark current and photocurrent are strongly dependent on crystal orientation in the layer-edge devices. This anisotropic electron/photoelectric property is related to the thickness of the inorganic layer (Fig. 4a–c). Furthermore, assuming a general elastic model, Kepenekian and colleagues69 proved that the layer thickness dependence of the electron-band structure of the 2D perovskite intermediate layer-edge surface is derived from the relaxation of mechanical strain in the mismatched interface (Fig. 4e–g). Blancon et al.70 reported that there is an intrinsic mechanism in the 2DRP perovskite film. When n > 2, the low energy state of the layered perovskite edge can separate strongly bonded electron–hole pairs (exciton) into long-lived free carriers. Carriers trapped in these edge states will not be lost due to non-radiative processes, but will be protected, which is beneficial to improve the photocurrent in photovoltaic (PV) devices (Fig. 4d).

2.4 Out-of-plane oriented growth
Venkatesan et al.71 studied the solution-treated (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–4) to show that the crystal structure of the two-dimensional lead iodide layer changes gradually from being parallel to being perpendicular to the substrate as n increases (shown in Fig. 5a and b). The crystal growth direction of the two-dimensional structure of n = 1 tends to be parallel to the substrate, which is disadvantageous for efficient charge transport.71,72 Therefore, controlling the growth orientation problem of this 2DRP perovskite is key to improve the PCE. In order to solve this issue, four strategies have been currently reported to achieve directional collection of carriers perpendicular to the electrode:73 (i) hot-casting. Tsai et al.74 first used hot-casting deposition to fabricate (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 film, realizing the vertical growth orientation of the inorganic layer, and obtaining the champion power conversion efficiency of 12.51%. (ii) Solvent engineering, such as DMSO&DMF75 and DMAC.28 Chen et al.76 further explored the intrinsic mechanism of crystal orientation and found that the orientation of the core formed at the liquid–vapor interface and the subsequent crystal growth determine the crystal orientation. The earliest crystal grains formed at the liquid–vapor interface will be vertically aligned, minimizing the surface energy (see Fig. 5d, scenario 1), thereby achieving vertical growth throughout the crystallization process, regardless of the substrate. (iii) Adding additives; the common additives are NH4SCN,77 NH4SCN&NH4Cl73 and DMSO&MACl78 and the less commonly used additive is thiourea (THA).79 Jen's group used a combination of NH4SCN and NH4Cl additives to increase the crystallinity and induce crystal growth preferably perpendicular to the substrate ((0k0) plane).73 (iv) Adopting shorter spacers. For example, short-chain branched butylamine (iso-BA),80 and allylammonium (ALA)81 can be used as spacer cations for out-of-plane growth. The (iso-BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 film has a significantly enhanced out-of-plane crystal orientation, which increases the cross-plane charge mobility compared to that of the conventional BA-based analogs. (v) Incorporating FA+ cation or Cs+ cation.15,82,83 Zhang Xu et al. found that doping Cesium (Cs) into (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite can increase the crystal size and help achieve orientated crystal growth, resulting in high-performance devices with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 13.7% based on (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 systems.15

2.5 Phase distribution
It is well known that the n value of 2DRP perovskites is derived from the stoichiometric ratio of the precursor solution and is used to indicate the thickness of the inorganic layer.84,85 However, in practice, it is difficult to obtain a pure-phase (the same value of n) 2DRP perovskite film during the experiment.62,63 To prevent the formation of multiphases, researchers have made many attempts. Smith et al. first successfully synthesized a single crystal of PEA2MA2Pb3I10, but due to the rapid recombination process in film spin coating, a polycrystalline blended perovskite film was obtained.25 Cao et al. successfully prevented the formation of the multiphases by using the sediment deposition process.59 The work on these pure RP phases gives a benchmark for determining the composition of the perovskites.35,86
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that there is band alignment in the multiphase hybrid perovskite materials. Proppe et al.81 found that the choice of organic ligands can affect the distribution of QW width in low-dimensional perovskites, which results in a spread of bandgaps in the materials. The distribution of QW width improves the photoelectric properties of the materials. The introduction of allyl ammonium (ALA) can reduce the ultrafast shallow traps for holes in materials caused by low-dimensional QWs, resulting in a narrower quantum well distribution and a flatter energy landscape (Fig. 6a). Controlling the narrow distribution of quantum wells successfully increased the diffusion length of electrons and holes, resulting in an increased PCE of 14.4% compared to 11–12% PCE obtained with similar devices using phenethylammonium and butylammonium ligands. Moreover, Liu Junxue et al.60 found that BA2MA3Pb4I13 has a unique spontaneous charge (electron/hole) separation property as it is a mixture of multiple perovskite phases. These multi-phase perovskites (n = 2, 3, 4 and ∞) are naturally arranged in the order perpendicular to the substrate from n = 2 to n = ∞, which is known as type-II band alignment (Fig. 6b),78 realizing the transfer of electrons from small-n phases to large-n phases while the holes are in the opposite direction. In type-II band alignment, the energies of both VBM and CBM corresponding to different n values decrease as n increases. This transfer of internal charge driven by the band alignment effectively separates electrons and holes from the electrodes at both ends and enables fast charge transfer, showing new applicability in optoelectronic devices.60 However, another sort of band alignment called type-I band alignment (funnel) has been proposed in multiphase LEDs, i.e., the energy of the CBM decreases as n increases, whereas the energy of the VBM exhibits an opposite trend with the change in n (Fig. 6c).87 The funnel-type alignment causes electrons and holes generated by the smaller n-phase to concentrate at the higher n-phase and successfully recombine, increasing the local charge carrier density and accelerating radiative recombination while suppressing non-radiative recombination, resulting in an improved light-emission efficiency.88,89

2.6 Structural distortion
The particularity of the 2D layered perovskite structure brings the possibility of adjusting the organic spacers and the thickness of the inorganic layer (n value), both of which play a key role in influencing the perovskite octahedral structure. It has been found that organic spacer cations with different chain lengths will crystallize perovskite crystals in different crystal systems, such as BA-based 2D layered perovskites crystallize in orthogonal space groups, while PA and HA analogs crystallize in monoclinic space groups (Fig. 7a).90 The octahedral distortion caused by the crystallization behavior in different space groups leads to huge differences in film stability. Likewise, it has been demonstrated that the position of the amino group has an effect on the angle of Pb–I–Pb in the octahedron, thereby further affecting the overall performance.91 Furthermore, the distance of I⋯I in adjacent octahedrons decreases slightly with the increase in n value, closer to the shortest I⋯I distance in the two-dimensional lead iodide perovskites (∼4.0 Å), which plays a vital role in influencing the electronic band structure of the materials (Fig. 7c).

3. Incorporation of 2DRP into 3D perovskite
Compositional engineering has been used to simultaneously increase device efficiency and stability by forming 2D–3D heterojunctions. In previous reports, the organic cations that are widely used to form 2D–3D heterojunctions are BA and PEA.92,93 Snaith's group94 found that the introduction of a small amount of BA into caesium–formamidinium lead halide perovskite inhibited non-radiative charge recombination. The presence of 2D–3D heterojunctions can confine the charge to the 3D perovskite without being captured and recombined at the grain boundaries (Fig. 8c). Hu et al.95 successfully deposited PEA2PbI4 layered perovskite (LPK) on the surface of a 3D perovskite layer (MAPI) by the cation infiltration process. LPK self-assembles on the MAPI layer with interface reorganization, which can reduce reorganization losses to improve Voc. In situ growth is also a common method of depositing 2D perovskite onto the surface of 3D perovskite.93,96 The large splitting of the Fermi level induced by the 2D perovskite layer under light illumination facilitates high Voc and promotes band alignment (Fig. 8b).96 The 2D–3D heterojunctions have been used in Sn-based perovskites, which is considered a substitute for toxic lead. The 2D–3D bulk heterojunctions Sn-based perovskites exhibit improved surface coverage (Fig. 8d) for enhanced Voc and FF.97

4. Conclusions and outlook
In this perspective, we compare the unique characteristics of RP perovskites with the 3D analogs and show surprising potential for achieving high-performance devices. Research based on controlled crystallographic orientation has been extensively used to address the quantum well structure induced by the introduction of organic spacer cations in 2DRP perovskite films. In addition, the introduction of hydrophobic cations, while impairing the performance of the device, greatly improves the stability of the film and device, and overall the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. In view of the phenomenon of mixing dimensions in low-dimensional perovskite films, researchers have made great efforts in recent years to find suitable band alignment structures. Furthermore, the recently extensively studied 2D/3D mixed and 2D/3D dual-layered perovskites, formed by the addition of smaller amounts of organic spacers, ensure both efficiency and stability compared to 2DRP perovskites. At present, the universal power conversion efficiency of 2D/3D mixed and 2D/3D dual-layered devices can exceed 20%, leaving only a small gap with traditional 3D devices, and also has enhanced the environmental stability.
However, there are still many problems to be solved, although the research on these three types of perovskites is quite rich, and good research results have been achieved. Firstly, for 2DRP perovskites, although heterogeneous blend structures have been discovered and the effects of phase distribution and phase purity on device performance have also been studied, the effective control of phase distribution and phase purity based on diverse film morphology remains a tricky issue. Secondly, the introduction of different spacers leads to a variety of lattice structure deformation, which is an uncontrollable process. Then, the dielectric mismatch caused by the addition of the 2D structure inevitably leads to 2D/3D interface problems. Further study of the mechanism of charge carrier dynamics, improving the electronic coupling of the 2D/3D interface, and achieving the suppression of composite kinetics will become the next research focus. Finally, the currently used thin film deposition method is a simple solution spin coating method, which is disadvantageous for the preparation of a uniform large-area film. Therefore, in order to realize the commercial application of 2DRP, 2D/3D mixed and 2D/3D bilayer perovskite devices, it is necessary to develop a new and effective deposition method.
