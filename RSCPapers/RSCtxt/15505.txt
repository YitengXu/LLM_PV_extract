    , Accepted 14th March 2013First published on 15th March 2013AbstractWe report two triarylamine-cyanoacrylic acid based push–pull dyes C252 and C253 featuring the π-conjugated linkers of 2,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole and 4H,4′H-2,2′-bidithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole, respectively. Benefitting from an improved coplanarity of the conjugated units, the C253 dye displays a red-shifted absorption peak and an enhanced maximum molar absorption coefficient in comparison with C252. However, this pattern of conjugated linker alternation is associated with an 80 mV negative shift of the ground-state oxidation potential, which dominates an almost 5 times reduced rate of hole injection from the oxidized state of C253 to the divalent tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt (Co-bpy) cation in the redox electrolyte, resulting in a considerably poor net charge separation yield. On the other side, a dye-sensitized solar cell employing the C252 photosensitizer and the Co-bpy electrolyte exhibits a good power conversion efficiency of 9.5% measured under the 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5 sunlight. The dissimilarity of cell photovoltage is scrutinized by evaluating the shift of the titania conduction band edge and the variation of interfacial charge recombination kinetics, the latter of which presents a clear correlation with dye coating thickness on titania derived from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Our work has underlined the important energetic and kinetic interplays which should be seriously considered in the further optimization of active components in dye-sensitized solar cells.

Broader context
Considerable progress on the efficiency of mesoscopic titania solar cells based upon metal-free organic sensitizers has been achieved in the past decade, mainly via judicious conjugation of electron-rich and electron-deficient blocks as well as rational modulation of photo-inactive auxiliary moieties. However, this advancement seems to slow down in the recent three years in spite of the synthesis of a large number of new and complex dye molecules. One fundamental reason is the relatively large energy-gaps of simple organic sensitizers developed in the earlier period, which do not meet some critical kinetic limitations presently faced by the new infrared absorption dyes. In this work, we present the conjugated linker correlated energetic and kinetic impacts on cell performance, highlighting the urgent need for controlling the three key charge recombination pathways involving the species of excited dye molecules, photo-oxidized dye molecules and oxidants in electrolytes. Without these controls, any type of low energy-gap dyes must be less meaningful for the Grätzel cells. In addition, it will be very instructive in the future studies to examine the atomic picture (microstructure) of the complicate photoanode interface composed of various components, apart from that of the single dye molecule.

1 Introduction
Over the past twenty years, a large amount of research effort has been devoted to the comprehension of fundamental mechanisms and innovation of advanced materials in the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC), which has huge potential to accomplish the solar-to-electricity conversion at an affordable cost.1 The economical efficiency of this photovoltaic cell could be attained on one hand by resorting to resource-abundant, less energy-intensive materials as well as simple manufacture technologies, and on the other hand by upgrading device performance. The design and synthesis of powerful metal-free organic dyes could be a viable and key tactic towards the challenge of this goal, on primary account of the grand flexibility of their molecular tailoring.2 In this regard, enhancing the molar absorption coefficient and reducing the energy gap of organic dye molecules to harvest more solar photons are two basic motivations for many recent studies.3 In essence, narrowing of the HOMO/LUMO energy gap of a dye molecule is unavoidably accompanied either with the negative shift of the ground-state oxidation potential (ED/D+) or the positive shift of the excited-state oxidation potential (ED*/D+), or even both of them. These energetic variations are very likely to be the key factors behind the lowered output of external quantum efficiencies by imparting the yield of generating long-lived charge carriers.4 Furthermore, the free energy of output electrons could be significantly governed by an organic layer mainly composed of dye molecules, spatially situated at the nanoscale boundary between the titania and redox couple.5
Through attachment of the bulky bis(octyloxy)biphenyl segment to 4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP), we have very recently synthesized the C251 dye (Fig. S1†) to fabricate a high photovoltage DSC,6 in conjunction with the tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt (Co-phen) redox couple. However the dye has a very limited response to the solar photons beyond 700 nm. Hence, in this work we extended our studies by the use of longer conjugated π-linkers containing DTP, i.e. 2,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (T-DTP-T) and 4H,4′H-2,2′-bidithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP–DTP), to construct two new dyes C252 and C253 (Fig. 1A) featuring a capacity to adsorb lower energy solar photons. Probably owing to the stronger intermolecular interaction, our preliminary experiments showed that both the two new dyes had a very low solubility in the dye-bath solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol alcohol used previously for C251, thereby we selected the 7/3 mixture of acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran as their dye bath-solvent for further studies. The Co-phen electrolyte and thick titania film were also identified to be not applicable to both C252 and C253 due to the problems of net charge separation and collection, thus we switched to a tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt (Co-bpy) electrolyte and a relatively thin titania film. Even with the Co-bpy electrolyte, the C253 dye still displayed a very low incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) height, which we know can be improved significantly by employing a tris(4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt (Co-Me2bpy) electrolyte. To make this paper more concise, in the following part we will focus our analyses solely on C252 and C253 in combination with a Co-bpy electrolyte to investigate the conjugated linker related energetic and kinetic impacts on photovoltaic behaviors.

2 Results and discussion
We first examined the light absorption properties of C252 and C253 dissolved in THF through measuring their UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1B) and collected the detailed parameters in Table 1. The C252 dye with the alkyl substituted T-DTP-T π-linker presents a maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of 512 nm, which is red-shifted to 542 nm upon employing the DTP–DTP counterpart for C253. Moreover, the molar absorption coefficient at the maximum absorption wavelength (εmax) increases from 42.5 to 69.2 × 103 M−1 cm−1 during the π-linker alternation. We further carried out square-wave voltammetric measurements to determine the accurate ED/D+ values of C252 and C253 in THF (Table 1), by averaging the anodic and cathodic peak potentials. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the C253 dye has an 80 mV negatively shifted ED/D+ compared to C252. From the crossing points of the normalized electronic absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the THF dye solution (Fig. 1B), the zero–zero transition energies (E0–0) were derived, being 2.08 eV for C252 and 2.04 eV for C253. Furthermore, we could compute the ED*/D+ values of C252 and C253 as −1.92 and −1.96 V versus the standard redox couple of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) via the equation of ED*/D+ = ED/D+ − E0–0/e without taking any entropy change during the light excitation process into account.

To gain insight into the conjugated linker correlated electron absorption spectra and redox potentials, we further performed quantum chemistry calculation with DFT and TDDFT methods. As shown in Fig. S2,† the simulated absorption spectra can nicely reproduce the experimentally observed red-shifting of absorption peak and the increase of absorption coefficient from C252 to C253. The calculated maximum absorption wavelength (λcalcmax) and oscillator strength (f) of the S0 → S1 transition were also shown in Table 1. The S0 → S1 transitions of both C252 and C253 are mainly originated from HOMO to LUMO and HOMO−1 to LUMO, however, the contribution from HOMO to LUMO transition is evidently enhanced for C253 (65%) in comparison with that of C252 (52%). The contour plots of transition-involved frontier molecular orbitals are depicted in Fig. 3. Moreover, our calculation shows that the C253 dye possesses a narrower HOMO/LUMO energy gap (Table 2) in comparison with C252 as well as higher HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which are well consistent with the negative movements of the measured ED/D+ and ED*/D+ compiled in Table 1. In spite of the augmented HOMO−1/LUMO energy gap, the reduced HOMO/LUMO energy gap and enhanced weight of its related transition for C253 jointly govern a decreased S0 → S1 excitation energy. Further analyses on the optimized geometries (Fig. S3†) disclose that with respect to C253, there are more torsions and larger torsion angles among conjugated units in C252. On the other hand, the C253 dye with the DTP–DTP conjugated linker displays an improved oscillator strength, owing to a better coplanarity of the electronic skeleton that improves the spatial overlap of ground-state and excited-state wave functions.

Photocurrent action spectra of the C252 and C253 dye-coated titania films were first examined in conjunction with a Co-bpy electrolyte, the composition of which is described in the Experimental section. As shown in Fig. 4A, the C252 dye has a remarkably higher IPCE summit of 79% when compared to that of 55% for C253, while the two DTP photosensitizers both display a broad photocurrent response to the whole visible photons. By looking at the electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 4B) of 2.4 μm thick, dye-coated films, we can conclude that the light-harvesting efficiency is not the controlling factor of the IPCE height observed here.

To dissect the origins of IPCE maximum difference, we further estimated the yield of electron injection from excited-state dye molecules to titania by using the femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion technique.7 Employing a C252 or C253-grafted nanoporous alumina film infiltrated with the Co-bpy electrolyte, a control cell was assembled, which exhibited a strong red light emission upon exposure to the 480 nm laser excitation. Our additional PL measurements on cells, with an inert electrolyte of 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in acetonitrile, have ruled out the occurrence of any charge and energy transfer reactions between the excited dye molecules and cobalt species. Owing to the absence of energy-offset for electron injection at the alumina–dye interface, the PL decays (green dots in Fig. 5) featuring amplitude-averaged lifetimes 〈τ〉av of 14.62 ps for C252 and 6.05 ps for C253 (Table 3) could be ascribed to the radiative and nonradiative deactivation of excited-state dye molecules. Note that the 〈τ〉av values of dye-grafted alumina films are considerably shorter than those of the THF solutions (188.72 ps for C252 and 407.53 ps for C253, Table 3), indicating that there could be strong intermolecular interactions in dye-grafted oxide films even if the bulky insulating groups have been attached to the electronic backbones of dye molecules. In addition, the alternation of excited-state lifetime tendency from solution to film needs to be seriously considered in the further dye design and device engineering. However, the replacement of alumina with titania induces a significant shortening of 〈τ〉av (2.42 ps for C252 and 1.12 ps for C253, Table 3), indicative of electron injection at the energy-offset titania–dye interface (orange triangles in Fig. 5). It is valuable to note that the PL intensities at the zero time delay on alumina and titania films for each dye are very similar, proving the through-exciton carrier photogeneration process in our cells. By computing the integral areas of PL traces of dye-coated titania and alumina films, we estimated the electron injection yields (ϕei) of the C252 and C253 cells, being 90% and 86%, respectively. Thus it can be concluded that the electron injection yield is not the only factor governing the IPCE summit, notwithstanding the fact that there is a different but minor quantity of non-electron-injecting dye molecules in our cells.

To understand the origin of non-electron-injecting dye molecules in the titania cells, we further performed the attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrum measurements to probe the adsorption pattern of C252 and C253 on titania. Compared to the spectra (Fig. 6A) of pristine dyes in KBr plates featuring the characteristic absorption bands of carboxylic acid (1678 cm−1), the corresponding dye-coated titania films exhibit two new absorption bands (1591 and 1367 cm−1) in Fig. 6B, which stem from the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the carboxylate group.8 The carboxylic acid absorption bands are not observed for both dye-coated titania films, suggesting the absence or the negligible presence of physically absorbed dye molecules. Thereby we conclude that the short exciton lifetime rather than their weak electronic coupling with titania due to physical adsorption is the key reason of non-unity electron injection observed in this work.

Nanosecond to millisecond transient absorption measurements were further executed to evaluate the kinetics of two oxidized dye molecule (D+) involved charge-transfer pathways with either photoinjected electrons in the titania film or electron-donating species in the cobalt electrolyte, the branch ratio of which can also impact the IPCE summit. Compared to their neutral forms, the oxidized states of both C252 and C253 possess strong absorptions in the near-infrared region (Fig. 7A and S4†). Therefore, in the following dynamic experiments, the observing light of 765 nm was our choice in view of the spectral response sensitivity of the photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector used, and the excitation wavelengths were also picked in accordance with an optical density of dye-grafted titania films of about 0.2 to ascertain a similar exciton distribution profile in the testing samples. The rate of charge recombination between photoinjected electrons in titania and D+ can be derived by recording the transient absorption traces (Fig. 7B) of dummy cells, made from 4.2 μm thick, dye-grafted titania films immersed in an inert electrolyte composed of 0.5 M tBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile. The absorption traces can be fitted to a stretched exponential decay function ΔA ∝ A0exp[(−t/τ)α], where A0 represents the pre-exponential factor, α the stretching parameter and τ the characteristic time. By the use of gamma function Γ(x), the mean times of these charge recombination reactions (〈τ〉bet) were derived through 〈τ〉 = (τ/α)Γ(1/α).9 It is found that C252 exhibits a 〈τ〉bet of 1.4 ms, slightly longer than that of 1.2 ms for C253.

The solid gray lines are stretched exponential fittings over raw data obtained by averaging 600 laser shots. 
As presented in Fig. 7C, the addition of electroactive Co-bpy species into the inert electrolyte brings forth an apparent acceleration of absorption decays, suggesting the occurrence of hole injection from D+ to the divalent Co-bpy cations.10 The derived mean reaction times (〈τ〉hi) of this reaction are 91 and 443 μs for C252 and C253, respectively. In accordance with the Marcus electron transfer theory,11 the kinetics of hole injection are determined by three physical factors including the change of Gibbs free energy, inter-sphere reorganization energy and electronic coupling factor. The small difference of reorganization energies (77 meV for C252 and 80 meV for C253) calculated with the DFT method is not likely to exert a significant influence on kinetics. Thereby we further derived the Gibbs free energies (0.28 eV for C252 and 0.20 eV for C253) on the basis of voltammetric measurements, which should play a crucial role in modulating the almost 5 times kinetic variation of hole injection. It is noted in our previous work that a high dye load amount could to some extent attenuate the hole injection rate,12 which does not seem to be the case presented here where a dye load amount of 1.06 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for C253 is indeed lower than that of 1.77 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for C252. We also took a close look at the frontier orbital surface (Fig. 3) of these two dyes, and identified that in comparison to C252 characteristic of a high Mulliken charge population on the terminal triphenylamino moiety, there is a more delocalized HOMO on the whole conjugated backbone for C253. This could have an adverse effect on the electronic coupling factor of cobalt(II) and D+ in the crowded molecular assembly on titania. The weakened electronic coupling could also make a partial contribution to the measured kinetics. Overall, compared to that of 94% for C252, the C253 dye exhibits a lower hole injection yield (ϕhi) of 73%, which gives a distinct clue on the aforementioned IPCE dissimilarity.
The photocurrent density–voltage (j–V) curves (Fig. 8A) of cells made from C252 and C253 in combination with a Co-bpy electrolyte were also measured under the irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight, and the detailed cell parameters were compiled in Table 4. The C252 dye exhibits a short-circuit photocurrent density (jsc) of 15.41 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 861 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.714, generating a power conversion efficiency (η) of 9.5%. However, the C253 dye with a smaller energy gap presents a lower jsc of 12.25 mA cm−2 and an over 100 mV shrunk Voc with respect to C252, resulting in a remarkably reduced η of 6.7%. For a short-circuit DSC, there is a very low electron density in the nanocrystalline titania film and the charge recombination flux is significantly alleviated, and the measured jsc is thus roughly proportional to the carrier photogeneration flux. The validity of this analysis could allow for the comparison of conjugated linker correlated Voc variation at a given jsc. Thereby we further measured j–V characteristics at different light intensities and plotted Voc as a function of jsc (Fig. 8B). It is easy to perceive that the C252 dye has an improved Voc at a certain jsc.

It is widely recognized in DSCs that for a fixed redox electrolyte, a rise and fall of the titania electron quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n), which in nature originates from a variation of titania conduction band edge (Ec) and/or a change of titania electron density, is the key determinant of Voc.5 At a certain flux of photocarrier generation, the electron density in titania is controlled by the interfacial recombination rate of titania electrons with electron accepting species in the electrolyte and/or dye cations. Thereby we further carried out charge extraction and transient photovoltage decay measurements to understand the electronic origins of the aforesaid Voc fluctuation. As shown in Fig. 9A, the C253 cell features a lower extracted charge (Q) at the same Voc or potential bias compared to the C252 cell, suggesting that the titania conduction-band edge of the former cell moves upward for about 70 mV with respect to the electrolyte Fermi-level. We notice that the dye load amount for C253 is considerably lower in comparison with C252, and the titania uncovered by C253 could effectively interact with the electrolyte additive tBP, which has been reported to have a strong capacity to lift-up the titania conduction band edge.13 The dye coverage related conduction-band edge shift is in good agreement with our previous observation.12 The interaction of tBP with titania at the solid–liquid interface could be resolved in the future study by sum frequency generation-surface vibrational spectroscopy or even other in situ spectroscopic methods. In addition, the calculated dipole moment of C252 and C253 are 12.6 and 19.5 D, respectively, which could also contribute to the observed conduction-band shift.14 However, the relatively higher conduction-band edge of the C253 cell does not lead to an improved Voc, owing to about two magnitudes of reduced τn at a given Q as illustrated in Fig. 9B.

The Ti2p signal intensity (I) obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments could be well correlated with the charge recombination rate at the interface of titania and electrolyte.12,15 Here we also evaluated the damping effect of a dye coating on the photoelectron emission from titania to vacuum and probed clear attenuations of both Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 signals for the C252 or C253 grafted titania film relative to the bare control (Fig. 10). Assuming that a compact dye layer is assembled on titania, the Ti2p3/2 signal intensity can be quantitatively related to the mean thickness of a compressed dye layer (d), via a two-layer model I = I0exp(−d/λsin α),16 where I0 denotes the signal intensity of a bare titania substrate, α the electron take-off angle of 90° and λ the inelastic electron mean free path (IMFP) in a compact dye solid. Thereby, we computed the λ values of C252 and C253 being 32.0 and 31.6 Å with the help of some semi-empirical equations and parameters in the literature17 and further derived the compressed mean thicknesses of dye coatings on titania: 33.1 Å for C252 and 24.5 Å for C253, based upon Ti2p3/2 intensities collected in Table S1.† It can be perceived that there is an apparent relationship between the dye coating thicknesses and the preceding electron lifetimes measured in transient photovoltage decay experiments. Note that the coating thickness of C253 on titania can be improved by changing the dye-bath solvent, but the closer packing of dye molecules will make the electron and hole injection yields more problematic in the present cell configuration.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized two new dithienopyrrole dyes characteristic of photocurrent response to the whole visible solar photons, and the C252 photosensitizer exhibits a good power conversion efficiency of 9.5% measured under the 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight, in combination with a non-corrosive Co-bpy redox electrolyte. Our femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion measurements have revealed that it is pertinent to engineer a long excitation lifetime dye assembly for a close-to-unity electron injection yield, rather than requiring a very large energy offset of its excited state with respect to titania. Furthermore, nanosecond to millisecond transient absorption measurements have raised one urgent question in the future infrared dye design, on the controlling of back electron transfer from titania to oxidized dye molecules, due to the necessity of a suitable driving force for hole injection from oxidized dye molecules to redox electrolytes. Our work has again shown that the mean thickness of a dye coating on titania has an evident influence on the rate of charge recombination between titania electrons and redox electrolytes, which must be carefully harnessed so as to improve the photovoltage output.

4.2 Computational details
Theoretical calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 09 program package. The geometries of D and D+ were optimized by use of the hybrid B3LYP and UB3LYP functionals, respectively.20 For the calculations on vertical excitation and oscillator strength, we applied the long-range corrected (LRC) CAM-B3LYP functional,21 which has significant improvements22 on the description of charge-transfer transition. The outer-sphere reorganization energy accounts for the main contribution to the total reorganization energy; however, it is only weekly dependent on the dye structure.23 Considering the same electrolyte used in our experiments, we just investigated the influence of dye structure related inter-sphere reorganization energy on the reduction of D+ to D. This reorganization energy was calculated via the equation, λreg = E(M+) − E(M), where E(M+) denotes the energy of a neutral molecule at the optimized geometry of its single-electron oxidized form and E(M) the energy of a neutral molecule at the optimized geometry of itself. In all calculations the 6-31G(d,p) basis set was selected and the solvent (tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile) effect was simulated by the conductor-like polarised continuum model (C-PCM) method.24
4.3 UV-vis, PL, FTIR, XPS, voltammetric and transient absorption measurements
UV-vis spectra were recorded on an Agilent G1103A spectrometer equipped with a silicon diode array detector. PL spectra were measured with a LifeSpec-II fluorescence spectrometer using an EPL485 laser diode to supply the excitation light. FTIR spectra were obtained with a BRUKER Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer. The measurements of XPS spectra were carried out on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using the Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) and the electron take-off angle was 90°. The square-wave voltammograms of THF dye solutions were measured on a CHI660C electrochemical workstation, using a mini electrolytic cell composed of a platinum ultramicroelectrode, a platinum gauze counter electrode and a silver-wire auxiliary electrode. The potential was reported against the Fc/Fc+ reference. Transient absorption experiments were performed on a LP920 laser flash photolysis spectrometer with nanosecond excitation pulses supplied by a tunable OPOLett 355II laser.
4.4 Femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion measurements
A mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics) pumped by a Nd:YVO4 laser (Millennia Pro s-Series, Spectra Physics) was employed to seed a regenerative amplifier (RGA, Spitfire, Spectra Physics). The output of a 3.7 mJ femtosecond pulse (130 fs pulse width) at 800 nm from the amplifier was divided into two parts with a 9/1 beam splitter. The large portion was sent to an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-C, Light Conversion) to generate the pump pulse (480 nm). Both the 720 nm photons emitted from the rotating sample and the minor part of the RGA output serving as the optical gate were focused onto a 1 mm thick BBO crystal to generate a sum frequency light in a femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion spectrometer (FOG 100-DA, CDP Corp.). The FWHM of our instrument response function was approximately 180 fs. Pump intensity dependent dynamics was slipped from our measurements.
4.5 Cell fabrication and characterizations
A 2.4 + 5.0 μm thick, double-layer titania film screen-printed on the FTO (Nippon Sheet Glass, Solar, 4 mm thick) conducting glass was used as the negative electrode. The recipe of a Co-bpy electrolyte: 0.25 M tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II) di(bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), 0.05 M tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), 0.5 M tBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile. Details on cell fabrication and measurements of IPCE, j–V, transient photovoltage decay and charge extraction can be found in our previous publications.12

Broader context
Considerable progress on the efficiency of mesoscopic titania solar cells based upon metal-free organic sensitizers has been achieved in the past decade, mainly via judicious conjugation of electron-rich and electron-deficient blocks as well as rational modulation of photo-inactive auxiliary moieties. However, this advancement seems to slow down in the recent three years in spite of the synthesis of a large number of new and complex dye molecules. One fundamental reason is the relatively large energy-gaps of simple organic sensitizers developed in the earlier period, which do not meet some critical kinetic limitations presently faced by the new infrared absorption dyes. In this work, we present the conjugated linker correlated energetic and kinetic impacts on cell performance, highlighting the urgent need for controlling the three key charge recombination pathways involving the species of excited dye molecules, photo-oxidized dye molecules and oxidants in electrolytes. Without these controls, any type of low energy-gap dyes must be less meaningful for the Grätzel cells. In addition, it will be very instructive in the future studies to examine the atomic picture (microstructure) of the complicate photoanode interface composed of various components, apart from that of the single dye molecule.

 	Fig. 7  (A) Transient absorption spectra recorded with an ICCD camera at 2 μs upon the 532 nm laser excitation of 2.4 μm thick, dye-coated titania films permeated with the inert electrolyte of 0.1 M LiTFSI and 0.5 M tBP in acetonitrile. (B and C) Nanosecond to millisecond absorption traces probed with a PMT detector at 765 nm of 4.2 μm thick, dye-coated titania films permeated with the inert (B) and Co-bpy electrolytes (C). Fluence and wavelength of the laser pulse (7 ns pulse width): a, 29 μJ cm−2 at 681 nm; b, 29 μJ cm−2 at 690 nm; c, 29 μJ cm−2 at 681 nm; d, 29 μJ cm−2 at 695 nm. The solid gray lines are stretched exponential fittings over raw data obtained by averaging 600 laser shots.	 

 	Fig. 8  (A) j–V characteristics measured under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight. (B) Open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) versus short-circuit photocurrent density (jsc). An antireflection film was adhered to a testing cell during measurements. The aperture area of the employed metal mask: 0.158 cm2.
