    , Accepted 12th March 2020First published on 14th March 2020AbstractDesigning lead-free inorganic perovskite or perovskite-like structure materials and researching the corresponding photoinduced charge carrier dynamics are always promising due to both the environment and power conversion efficiency considerations. In this work, we intelligently employ a bilayer metal Bi/Cu thin film with different atomic ratios as the precursor to fabricate a CuBiI4 perovskite-like film in situ with a controlled Bi gradient at room temperature. This structure can significantly affect the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics of the resulting products. Next, a series of transient surface photovoltage (TSPV) measurements are carried out to investigate the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics of such CuBiI4 and CuBiI4:organic hybrid thin films. The results reveal that the gradually decreasing Bi content from ITO to CuBiI4 can facilitate the photoinduced charge carrier transportation. Finally, a champion PCE of 1.10% is obtained for an ITO/CuBiI4:polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene (PTB7)/Au solar cell device. In particular, we find an exact negative correlation of the defined parameter L (the defined value for evaluating the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics in TSPV measurements) with the corresponding PCE of various devices for the first time, which may pave a new way for evaluating the potential photoelectric and photovoltaic performances of new materials without the assembly of solar cell devices.
1. Introduction
Organic-lead halide perovskite materials boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells over 24.2%.1 But the toxicity of lead (Pb) drives researchers to explore other alternative environmentally friendly perovskite or perovskite-like materials.2–8
Bismuth (Bi), an earth-abundant and non-toxic element, has been regarded as an ideal substitute element. Bi-based halide perovskite-like materials with the chemical formula A3Bi2X9 (A stands for K+, Rb+, Cs+ or CH3NH3+; X stands for the halogen atom) have attracted great attention recently.9–16 Among them, (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I9 have been successfully fabricated for solar cell device applications and have shown exciting performance.17,18 However, due to the rarity of cesium and instability of organic cations,19 using another inexpensive and earth abundant metal cation to replace cesium or methylammonium (MA) becomes more important. To this end, Bi based all-inorganic perovskite-like AaBbXx compound semiconductor materials (A = Ag, Cu; BBi, Sb; X = I, Br and x = a + 3b) have been constructed.20–22 Turkevych et al.23 prepared a series of ternary Ag–Bi–I compounds with a bandgap of 1.79–1.83 eV via the solid–state reaction method at 600 °C. The silver element can also be replaced with the cost-effective copper element to fabricate all inorganic, environment friendly and low-cost Cu–Bi–I (CuBiI4) compounds which was first reported in 1991.24 Hayase et al.25 reported a solution route to preparing CuBiI4 with the (111) crystal plane orientation and a wide band-gap of 2.67 eV. To enhance the quality of CuBiI4 thin films, HI was employed to facilitate the dissolution of CuI and BiI3 powders in dimethylacetamide (DMA), and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment was conducted with high vapor pressure tributyl phosphate (TBP). Finally, based on such CuBiI4 thin films, solar cell devices with the structure of FTO/c-m-TiO2/CuBiI4/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au were fabricated, and a PCE of 0.82% was obtained.
Previously, our group reported a very facile route, the direct metal surface elemental reaction (DMSER), for in situ fabrication of In2S3,26 Ag2S,27 Ag3CuS2,28 Ag2Se (ref. 29) and PbI2 (ref. 30) semiconductor thin films. Based on this DMSER method, we fabricated a series of n-type CuBiI4 semiconductor thin films in situ at room temperature very recently by considering the advantages of different Bi–Cu alloy layers directly on the ITO substrate as precursors.31 A suitable band gap of ∼1.81 eV was obtained, which is quite different from that (∼2.67 eV) obtained by Hayase and coworkers. Based on the CuBiI4 thin film with a band gap of 1.81 eV, ITO/CuBiI4:Spiro-OMeTAD/Au bulk-heterojunction hybrid solar cells with a simple sandwich structure were fabricated, and a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 1.119% was obtained.31
Recently, some research groups reported and confirmed that the element gradient structure formed in the active layer could significantly enhance the performance of solar cell devices.32–34 This strategy may facilitate the PCE enhancement of CuBiI4 based solar cells. Therefore, Bi/Cu bilayer thin films were used as the precursor to fabricate CuBiI4 thin films with a Bi gradient. Benefiting from the easily controlled ratio of Bi/Cu, the effect of the molar ratio of Bi/Cu bilayer thin films was carefully investigated. On the basis of this, different hole transfer materials such as Spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT and PTB7 were spin-coated on CuBiI4 thin films to construct hybrid solar cell devices. The PCE of the solar cells with different CuBiI4:organic structures were also studied to understand the effect of organic materials on this structure. In particular, the photoinduced charge-carrier transfer and recombination in CuBiI4 and CuBiI4 organic thin films were studied by transient surface photovoltage (TSPV) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The results reveal that the Bi gradient in CuBiI4:organic bulk-heterojunction thin films could facilitate photoinduced charge carrier transfer. This work may provide a new strategy for the research of perovskite-like materials and the related solar cell devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1 ITO substrate preparation
Patterned ITO substrates (10 Ω per square, transmittance ≥ 86%) were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, detergent and deionized water for 20 min in sequence. Before use, the ITO substrates were treated with O3 for about 15 min.
2.2 Fabrication of ITO/CuBiI4 samples
First, 60 nm Bi was deposited on the ITO substrate by magnetron sputtering in a vacuum of 8 × 10−3 mbar and at a current of 25 mA, and the related film thickness was controlled by using a film thickness monitor (FTM). Second, 10 nm, 20 nm and 30 nm of elemental Cu were deposited on the Bi film surface in a vacuum of 8 × 10−3 mbar and at a current of 60 mA, respectively. For fabricating the Bi gradient CuBiI4 thin film, the obtained Bi/Cu bilayer metal films were placed in a sealed box with over dosage of elemental iodine at room temperature for about 18–30 h. Finally, a CuBiI4 thin film can be obtained on the ITO surface.
2.3 Assembly of solar cell devices
A Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 80 mg of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-dip-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, Sigma-Aldrich), 28.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Sigma-Aldrich) and a 17.5 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile (Aladdin, 99.8%)) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene (Aladdin, 99.8%). PTB7 and P3HT solutions were prepared by mixing 10 mg of PTB7 or P3HT, 28.5 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL of acetonitrile in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, respectively. After stirring overnight, organic semiconductor solutions were spin-coated onto the CuBiI4 thin film at 3000 rpm for 30 s in a N2-filled glove box. To accomplish the solar cell assembly, about 50 nm Au was thermally evaporated onto the CuBiI4:HTL surface with a mask. The active area of the resulting solar cell devices was 0.1125 cm2.
2.4 Characterization
XRD data were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) with a Cu target tube (Kα radiation 1.54056 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA, and the scan step was 0.02° s−1. The morphology of the thin films was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) at 10 kV. TEM measurements were performed by using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-2100F) at 200 kV. The absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 5000) from 200 nm to 800 nm. Transient surface photovoltage measurements were carried out with a Nd:YAG pulsed laser (355 nm and 4 ns, Quantel Brilliant Eazy, BRILEZ/IR-10) and a digital oscilloscope (500 MHz, TDS 3054C, Tektronix). The photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar cell devices was tested with a sunlight simulator (Newport 91192STS) equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter. The corresponding J–V curves of the solar cells were recorded under ambient conditions using a Keithley 2400 source meter. An EQE measurement system (Newport 66902) was used to collect the EQE data of the solar cell devices. PL spectra of the films were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature (Hitachi F4600).
3. Results and discussion
Based on our our previous report,31 the direct metal surface elemental reaction (DMSER) has been successfully developed for the growth of a CuBiI4 thin film with an alloy of Cu and Bi. In this work, CuBiI4 thin films with a Bi gradient have been successfully fabricated with this DMSER method by using an elemental Bi/Cu bilayer thin film as the precursor at room temperature.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the CuBiI4 thin films fabricated with different molar ratios of Bi/Cu by adjusting the Cu film thickness. For comparison, the CuBiI4 films synthesized with the Bi–Cu alloy were also examined. The diffraction peaks of both kinds of samples can be well indexed to the cubic structure of CuBiI4 (JCPDS card No. 81-197). This suggests that both Bi–Cu alloy and Bi/Cu bilayer precursors can be used for CuBiI4 thin film fabrication. The diffraction peaks at 25.5°, 29.4°, 42.1° and 49.7° can be assigned to the lattice planes (222), (400), (440) and (622), respectively. All of the other diffraction peaks come from the ITO substrate and have been marked with a diamond symbol in Fig. 1. Keeping the thickness of the Bi thin film constant, Cu with different thicknesses has been deposited on the Bi thin film to produce a CuBiI4 thin film, and the resulting samples were also studied by XRD measurements. It can be found that the relative intensity of diffraction peaks of the CuBiI4 thin film increased as the Cu film increased, and the position of the diffraction peaks was not shifted. Importantly, we also find that the weak diffraction peak at 27° can be well indexed to the BiI3. When increasing the thickness of the Cu thin film, this BiI3 diffraction peak disappeared. This indicates that there will be a BiI3 layer under the CuBiI4 layer when the element Cu is insufficient. Therefore, the Bi content distribution can be adjusted by controlling the thickness of elemental Cu. Such results suggest the successful fabrication of the CuBiI4 thin film with a Bi content gradient in the thin film from the bottom to the top.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the CuBiI4 films synthesized by controlling the molar ratios of Bi/Cu. 
In order to fabricate a perovskite-like copper bismuth iodide ternary compound with the Bi concentration gradient, a certain thickness of Bi metal thin films were first deposited on the ITO substrate by magnetron sputtering, and then the Cu thin films of controlled thicknesses were deposited and finally reacted with the elemental I2 at room temperature. A schematic diagram of the preparation of the CuBiI4 films with a Bi concentration gradient using bilayer thin films with Bi/Cu of different ratios as precursors is illustrated in Fig. 2. The reaction mechanism was also deduced based on the experimental results. The reaction activities of elemental bismuth and copper and elemental iodine are quite different. The elemental Cu can react with iodine easily and quickly while the pure Bi could hardly directly react with iodine at room temperature. We thus proposed that the formation of the CuBiI4 may be started by the formation of CuI in the first step; next, the Bi atoms reacted with CuI in an I2 atmosphere to generate CuBiI4. The Bi was distributed uniformly throughout the film, and BiI3 content gradually increased from the surface to the bottom of the film, forming a concentration gradient of Bi. Although the detailed reaction theory is still unclear, the effect of such a very thin BiI3 layer could be quite positive for electron transportation.

The morphology of the resulting CuBiI4 and CuBiI4:Sprio-OMeTAD thin films is illustrated in Fig. 3. The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the CuBiI4 thin films fabricated from Bi/Cu of different molar ratios (10 nm–30 nm) as precursors are shown in Fig. 3a–c. For all the cases initially, 60 nm Bi thin films were first deposited onto the ITO substrate, and the thicknesses of individual CuBiI4 were increased from about 300 nm to 500 nm along with the increase of the initial Cu film thickness. A small physical gap can be observed between the interface of CuBiI4 thin films and the ITO substrate as the Cu content increased. This may increase the series resistances of final solar cell devices. Therefore, the CuBiI4 thin films constructed with 10 nm and 20 nm Cu will be suitable for solar cell use. Fig. 3d–f show the top-view and cross sectional SEM images of the CuBiI4:Spiro-OMeTAD thin films with different molar ratios of Bi and Cu. The hybrid structure was constructed by spin coating Spiro-OMeTAD on the CuBiI4 surface, and very uniform and smooth thin films were obtained. Compared to that of the pristine CuBiI4 thin films, the thickness of hybrid thin films was increased by about 200 nm. Such high quality hybrid thin film formation can be attributed to the following reason. During the spin coating process, the pristine CuBiI4 thin film could be dissolved and recrystallized in such a Spiro-OMeTAD, acetonitrile and TBP mixed solution to form a more compact and homogeneous layer with a bulk heterojunction structure, which could separate and transfer the photoinduced charge carriers more efficiently. Some bubble-like structures can be found on the hybrid thin film surface, which could be attributed to the evaporation of TBP (an additive in the Spiro-OMeTAD solution).35–37 Corresponding elemental analysis measurements have been carried out (Fig. 3e). The results show that Cu and I are almost evenly distributed throughout the whole film, while the Bi element content gradually increased from the surface to the bottom of the film. This may be because the elemental copper can not easily diffuse to the bottom of the thin film.38 However, the quantity of the formed BiI3 is so small (weak diffraction peak intensity in XRD patterns) that even we could not see an obvious thin layer between ITO and the CuBiI4 main absorber layer (SEM cross-sectional images). The content gradient of Bi in the CuBiI4 films may facilitate the enhancement of the photoinduced charge carrier transport.39

CuBiI4 can be partly dissolved in the mixed organic solutions and then recrystallized to form a small homogeneous crystalline layer. To further understand this hybrid inorganic/organic structure, TEM and HRTEM measurements have been carried out. Fig. 4a illustrates the TEM and HRTEM images of CuBiI4 nanoparticles and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns. The lattice plane distance was measured to be 0.35 nm, which can be well indexed to the (222) plane of cubic phase CuBiI4. This result is in accord with the XRD results. The FFT images show that there are two sets of diffractions, which could be indexed to the (222) and (400) lattice plane of CuBiI4.40Fig. 4b shows the TEM image of CuBiI4:Spiro-OMeTAD films. It reveals that the CuBiI4 nano-crystals are surrounded by organic Spiro-OMeTAD, forming a uniform hybrid CuBiI4:Spiro-OMeTAD structure.

In order to investigate the optical properties of CuBiI4 films, UV-Vis absorption and PL measurements of CuBiI4 thin films prepared with different molar ratios of Bi/Cu were carried out. Fig. 5 shows that the absorption edge of CuBiI4 was around 683 nm, and the corresponding band gap was calculated to be 1.80 eV. Fig. 5b shows the PL spectrum of CuBiI4 thin films prepared with different molar ratios of Bi/Cu. A strong PL peak at 680 nm could be detected for CuBiI4 thin films with 226 nm light excitation. The corresponding band gap is 1.8 eV, which is in accord with the UV-Vis absorption results. Among the samples, the CuBiI4 thin film synthesized using the 20 nm Bi/Cu precursor shows the strongest PL intensity, suggesting better crystal quality and fewer defects. The CuBiI4 thin films were coated with the organic semiconductors Spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT and PTB7, and the corresponding PL results have been illustrated in Fig. 5c. After being mixed with the above organic semiconductors, the PL intensity of the CuBiI4 thin films has significantly decreased compared with that of the pure CuBiI4 thin film due to the photoinduced charge carriers being separated and transferred more efficiently.

To further understand the photoelectric performance of the CuBiI4 thin film with the Bi gradient,41 TSPV measurements were carried out. Fig. 6 shows the TSPV results of the CuBiI4 thin films prepared with different molar ratios of Bi/Cu and the corresponding CuBiI4:HTL thin films. In this work, a 355 nm pulse laser with about 8 μJ power was used as the excitation light source.42–44 The TSPV of CuBiI4 shows a positive photovoltage signal, suggesting that the synthesized CuBiI4 samples should all be n type semiconductors, and this result is in agreement with that of our previous report.31 It is well known that photoinduced charge carrier transfer and recombination play crucial roles in photoelectric conversion systems, such as solar cells, and photocatalysis.40,45 According to our previous TSPV study on perovskite solar cells,42–44 a parameter, L, has been defined to evaluate the photoelectric performance of perovskite thin films. L = Tt/Tr, where Tt is the time taken for the photovoltage to reached the maximum value; Tr is the time taken for the complete recombination of the photogenerated charge carrier. A smaller L value indicates that the corresponding semiconductor exhibits relatively high photoelectric performance. The corresponding values are listed in Table 1. For the CuBiI4 thin films prepared with 10 nm Bi/Cu, the Tt and Tr values are about 9.35 × 10−7 s and 6.21 × 10−4 s, respectively, and the corresponding L is about 1.51 × 10−3. For comparison, L is approximately 1.45 × 10−3 for CuBiI4 thin films prepared with 20 nm Bi/Cu and about 3.08 × 10−3 for CuBiI4 thin films prepared with 30 nm Bi/Cu. CuBiI4 films prepared with 20 nm Bi/Cu precursors show the smallest L value, suggesting the fastest photogenerated carrier transfer among these CuBiI4 samples. This result indicates that a suitable Bi concentration gradient could promote the photoelectric performance enhancement of the CuBiI4 thin film material. Compared with that of the pure CuBiI4 thin films, the L value of CuBiI4:organic thin films fabricated with the 10 nm Bi/Cu and 20 nm Bi/Cu thin film (Fig. 6b–d) is one order of magnitude lower. This indicates that more efficient photogenerated carrier transfer could be obtained in these hybrid samples. Due to the poor interface contact (Fig. 3f), CuBiI4:HTL thin films prepared with 30 nm Bi/Cu show a relatively low photoinduced charge carrier transfer process. The Tt and Tr of CuBiI4:Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 6b) and CuBiI4:PTB7 (Fig. 6d) composite films are about the same, suggesting that PTB7 and Spiro-OMeTAD have similar effects in separation, transfer and recombination processes of photogenerated carriers in hybrid thin films. Moreover, the L value of CuBiI4:P3HT thin films appears to be higher than that of CuBiI4:Spiro-OMeTAD films and CuBiI4:PTB7 films, which could be attributed to the rough and porous structure of CuBiI4:P3HT thin films as shown in Fig. S1a.† Thus, we predicted that CuBiI4:Spiro-OMeTAD films and CuBiI4:PTB7 films may possess similar photoelectric performance, which is better than that of CuBiI4:P3HT films. The above results demonstrate that the perovskite-like CuBiI4 material will be a novel photoelectric material which could provide a new option for the research and development of high performance thin film solar cells.

Bi content gradient CuBiI4 thin films were used for solar cell device fabrication, and the corresponding photoelectric conversion performances were also studied. Fig. 7a shows the typical SEM cross section of the solar cell device with the structure of ITO/CuBiI4:Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Fig. 7b shows the corresponding schematic structure and band energy level alignment of the CuBiI4:HTL hybrid perovskite solar cell. The n-type BiI3 with a slightly smaller band gap than CuBiI4 may absorb solar light ahead of the CuBiI4 layer. The conduction band (Ecb) of BiI3 (−4.25 eV) is extremely close to that of CuBiI4 (−4.28 eV), and thus the photo-generated electrons of CuBiI4 should be easily transferred to BiI3 and collected using ITO. The energy levels of the valence band (Evb) of Spiro-OMeTAD, PTB7 and P3HT are −5.23 eV, −5.22 eV and −5.0 eV, respectively. Considering the Evb of the organic semiconductors aligning with that of CuBiI4, the Spiro-OMeTAD and PTB7 have suitable Evb values compared to P3HT. The photoinduced holes of CuBiI4 should be transferred to Spiro-OMeTAD and PTB7 more efficiently. Furthermore, the corresponding photovoltaic performances of CuBiI4 hybrid solar cell devices are presented in Fig. 7c. The related J–V curve parameters of CuBiI4 based solar cells are listed in Table 2. An open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.51 V, short circuit density (Jsc) of 4.77 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 43.17% and PCE of 1.05% have been obtained for the solar cell device fabricated with the CuBiI4 (Bi/Cu 20 nm):Spiro-OMeTAD sample. The CuBiI4(Bi/Cu 20 nm):PTB7 thin film based solar cell also shows a relatively high PCE of 1.06% with a Voc of 0.45 V, Jsc of 4.77 mA cm−2 and FF of 49.65%. The CuBiI4:PTB7 thin films prepared with the 30 nm Bi/Cu precursors show a Jsc of 1.34 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.25 V, FF of 34.18% and PCE of 0.11%. The low performance can be attributed to the poor interface contact between the CuBiI4 thin film and the ITO substrate (Fig. 3c) while the bismuth-rich CuBiI4:PTB7 thin film (Bi/Cu 10 nm) based solar cell device exhibited an excellent Jsc of 5.40 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.51 V and FF of 40.17%, and resulted in a highest PCE of 1.10%. For the device using Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport material, a Voc of 0.46 V, Jsc of 6.23 mA cm−2, FF of 37.05% and PCE of 1.06% have been achieved. In this work, the maximum Voc of the resulting devices is 0.51 V, which is higher than that in previous reports.31 The enhancement of photoelectric performance using the bismuth-rich thin film could be ascribed to its built-in electric field by the content gradient of Bi (Fig. 6). In contrast, the solar cell devices with the ITO/SnO2/CuBiI4/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure have been fabricated and measured (the corresponding J–V curves are illustrated in the ESI in Fig. S2.†) In fact, the Voc loss is still relatively high because the band gap of CuBiI4 is about 1.8 eV. The Voc loss can be attributed to the following aspects: first, the photoinduced charge carrier recombination caused by the misalignment of the energy level between CuBiI4 and organic semiconductors and second, the current leakage between the ITO and HTL layer. Therefore, using an organic semiconductor with a suitable band structure46–49 and reducing the current leakage can both increase the Voc value of the CuBiI4 based solar cell device. Fig. 7d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve of the solar cell device based on the CuBiI4:Spiro-OMeTAD hybrid thin film. The related band gap of CuBiI4 was calculated to be about 1.80 eV. As for the working mechanism of the current device assembly, first, our DMSER method allows the in situ construction of the compact interfaces between the ITO and absorber layer, which facilitates the formation of the elemental gradient structure; second, the gradient formation of the small amount of BiI3 between ITO and CuBiI4 is actually a relatively compact CuBiI4:BiI3 blended structure but not a definite BiI3 layer with a gradually decreasing BiI3 content from the ITO side to CuBiI4, in which the n-type BiI3 plays the role of an ETL in the current solar cell device at the micro-level; third, considering both the low content of BiI3 and its similar band gap (difference less than 0.1 eV) compared with CuBiI4, despite the hole generated from the BiI3 being difficult to transport, the ratio of this invalid hole transportation part induced by BiI3 irradiation should be quite low. Therefore, we suggest that both BiI3 and CuBiI4 can act as the light absorber, but the leading actor is still CuBiI4 because of the lack of BiI3; fourth, the utilization of general ETLs with wide band gaps such as TiO2 plays a negative role in the current device assembly, and further investigation is still needed. In particular, considering the calculated L values of TSPV measurements in Table 1 and the PCE values in Table 2, an obviously negative correlation between them can be observed. This means that using the CuBiI4 thin films with a smaller L value will result in a higher performance solar cell device. This may give some suggestion about optimization for the final solar cell device fabrication.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a low-cost, controllable and environment friendly chemical vapor-solid direct reaction method was employed to fabricate CuBiI4 films at room temperature in situ. By considering the advantages of elemental Bi/Cu bilayer thin films as precursors, Bi content gradient CuBiI4 thin films were successfully fabricated. The concentration of Bi shows an increasing trend from the top of the CuBiI4 thin film to the ITO substrate surface. Such a Bi gradient structure could enhance the photoinduced charge carrier transfer. Based on these CuBiI4 thin films, ITO/CuBiI4:organic/Au solar cell devices were fabricated and the corresponding photoelectric conversion performances were evaluated. The solar cell devices based on CuBiI4 (Bi/Cu 10 nm): PTB7 exhibited a champion PCE (1.10%) with a Jsc of 5.40 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.51 V and a FF of 40.17%. The PCE of CuBiI4:Spiro-OMeTAD based solar cell devices was 1.06%. TSPV measurements confirmed that the fabricated CuBiI4 possessed excellent photoelectric properties compared with the organic–inorganic lead-based perovskite material. The Bi gradient in the CuBiI4 thin film could facilitate photoinduced charge carrier transportation. In the CuBiI4:organic thin film, the photoinduced charge transfer was enhanced and the charge carrier life time was also improved.
