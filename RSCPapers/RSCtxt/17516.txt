    , Accepted 14th March 2022First published on 14th March 2022AbstractA novel Ag triangle nanoparticles/TiO2 nanorod array (AgNTs/TNA) heterostructure was designed as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active substrate for the sensitive detection of Rhodamine 6G (R6G), Crystal Violet (CV), Malachite Green (MG) and Thiram in food samples. The heterostructure was constructed by simply stacking AgNTs and hydrothermally prepared rutile TNA together. On the surface of the heterostructure, the intensity of the Raman scattering intensity was about two times stronger compared with that on the AgNT substrate, using the R6G molecule as a probe. The AgNTs/TNA heterostructure could detect the SERS signal of R6G down to 10−10 M, showing excellent SERS performance. This platform has been successfully applied for the detection of CV and MG residues in crayfish. When irradiated with ultraviolet light, the SERS substrates can be cleaned and reused. This work demonstrated that the AgNTs/TNA metal–semiconductor heterostructure with high sensitivity, reproducibility and recyclability could provide an alternative reliable platform for food additive analysis.
1 Introduction
Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with high selectivity, super-sensitivity, nondestructive nature and rapid performance has been regarded as a powerful technique for the detection of trace chemicals and biomolecules.1,2 To obtain enhanced and reproducible SERS signals, an effective substrate with good enhancement ability as well as reproducible and robust character is very important. Considering that the recognized SERS enhancement is primarily due to the intense electromagnetic field generated by the incident excitation of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the plasmonic nano-metals and chemical enhancement from charge transfer (CT), any substrate that could improve the electromagnetic field or CT is favorable.3,4 Coin-metal nanoparticles such as copper,5 gold6 and silver7 have been widely applied in SERS studies because of their SPR effect. Among them, Ag has attracted more attention due to its strong and tunable SPR from the visible to near-infrared spectrum.8 In recent years, the preparation of Ag nanoparticles has become the research goal of many scientists. Ag nanoparticles with different morphologies such as nanorods,9 nanoballs,10 triangles,11 nanowires12 and flowers13 have been prepared and applied. Among these morphologies, the triangular structure has attracted a lot of attention in Raman studies because the tips and sharp edges of the triangular Ag would enhance the Raman signal.14 Different methods such as direct reduction,15 seed,16 microwave17 and ultrasonic18 protocols have been reported for the preparation of triangular Ag. However, some of these methods are not environmentally friendly and facile. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a kind of water-soluble and green polyphenolic compound extracted from plants. With good biological activity and reducibility, EGCG has been used as a reducing agent and stabilizer for the green preparation of noble metal nanostructures due to its reducing ability from phenolic hydroxyl groups.6,19 In this work, EGCG, as a green reductant, was combined with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to prepare a AgNT sol. The size and morphology of the AgNTs could be tuned by altering the concentration of EGCG and PVP. Furthermore, despite the rational preparation of AgNTs to realize their optimal SERS performance, the single application of AgNTs usually has intrinsic shortcomings including poor reproducibility, poor stability, high cost and non-reusability.20,21 Compared with single nanomaterials, composites composed of two or more materials have greatly improved performance, and wider application fields.22 Semiconductors with good electron mobility and low cost have been considered as one of the most promising materials to combine with coin-metal nanoparticles.23,24 The metal–semiconductor heterostructure was found to be highly effective in boosting the performance of light harvesting and conversion. This in turn improves the SERS performances because of the synergistic contribution of plasmons and CT.25,26 Since Rijana et al. firstly reported SERS enhancement of semiconductor nanostructures,27 various semiconductor materials have been combined with Ag nanostructures to form Ag–semiconductor heterostructures, such as Ag/TiO2,28 Ag/CuO,29 and Ag/Si.30 When the semiconductor is combined with Ag nanostructures, the SPR of Ag and the CT interaction between the semiconductor and Ag can provide a powerful electromagnetic mechanism and chemical mechanism effect for SERS enhancement.31,32 In addition to high SERS activity, signal uniformity and reproducibility are other important issues in the practical application of SERS substrates. Reproducibility problems can be mitigated by using nanoarray substrates.33 Different nanoarrays such as ZnO/Ag34 nanorod arrays and nanodiamond arrays35 have been applied to obtain reproducible SERS signals. TiO2 is a widely studied semiconductor because of its good physical and chemical stability.36,37 TNAs with large surface area, high aspect ratio, and good uniformity that can be obtained by a simple and reproducible method are also the most important criteria in practical applications of substrate-based SERS.38,39 This may help to obtain a repeatable and reproducible SERS response.
In this work, a novel SERS substrate based on a TNA and AgNTs was fabricated. A uniform and free-standing rutile TNA was grown in a controlled manner on the conductive surface of FTO glass by a hydrothermal method. AgNTs prepared by an EGCG-assisted green reduction method were deposited on the TNA to construct a metal/semiconductor heterostructure based SERS substrate. The AgNTs with sharp edges can strongly enhance the local electromagnetic field, produce more efficient and sufficient hot spots, and thus create a robust and controllable electromagnetic field detection space. In addition, AgNTs are conducive to the formation of heterostructures and improve the separation efficiency of light-induced electron–hole pairs because they have good electrical conductivity and strong electron trapping ability.40 The physical properties of the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and a UV-vis spectrometer. Trace amounts of R6G Raman probe molecule were used to evaluate the SERS performance of the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure. Finally, the application potential of the substrate for multiple food additives such as R6G, CV, MG and Thiram and real sample detection were investigated. The experimental results showed that the AgNTs/TNA substrate had low detection limit, good reproducibility and uniformity. The reusability of the SERS substrate has also been studied.
2 Experimental
2.1 Apparatus and reagents
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 15 Ohm square−1) glass slides were purchased from Zhuhai Kaiwo Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd (Zhuhai, China). Toluene, acetone, ethanol, hydrochloric acid, silver nitrate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-K30), R6G, CV, Thiram, and MG of analytical grades were all purchased from Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) was provided by Aladdin Industrial Company (Shanghai, China). Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, >90%) of analytical grade was purchased from Hefei Bomei Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Hefei, China).
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of different samples under a Zeiss_Supra55 field emission scanning electron microscope (s-4800, Japan) were analyzed. A transmission electron microscope (HT7800, TEM) was used to characterize the morphologies of the different samples at 120 keV. A D8 ADVANCE (Bruker Co) X-ray diffractometer was used to obtain the crystal structures of the different materials using Cu k-α radiation. A Cary 5000 ultraviolet-visible-near infrared absorption spectrometer was used to monitor the ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance/absorption spectra (DRS) of the TNA and AgNTs/TNA.
SERS signals were obtained by an InVia confocal Raman spectrometer (Renishaw, England). For Raman measurements, a He–Ne laser with a power of 3.28 mW at 632.8 nm was used as the excitation light, and a 50× objective lens was used to focus the laser beam on the sample surface and collect the Raman signal. The laser spot size was about 2 μm, and the spectrum was recorded with a cumulative time of 10 s.
2.2 Preparation of TNA substrates
Rutile TNA was grown on the conductive surface of FTO glass by a simple hydrothermal synthesis process. Before use, the FTO glasses were ultrasonically cleaned by toluene, acetone, ethanol and ultrapure water in sequence for 10 minutes. 30 ml of ultrapure water and 30 ml of 36% hydrochloric acid were mixed together in a beaker, then 0.003 mmol TBOT was added into the mixture under stirring conditions. After stirring for another 5 min, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel hydrothermal reactor. FTO glass was inclined against the wall of the reactor with the conductive surface facing down. After reaction at 150 °C for 20 h, the TNA/FTO substrates were taken out, rinsed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C in an oven. The effect of the hydrothermal time on the SERS signal was discussed in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
2.3 Preparation of the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure
The AgNTs were prepared as follows: 0.14 g PVP, 17.0 mL double-distilled water, 2.0 mL AgNO3 solution (1.0 × 10−2 M) and 1.0 mL EGCG solution (5.0 × 10−3 M) were added into a 50 mL round-bottom beaker and stirred continuously for 5 min until the mixture was turned into a colorless and transparent solution. Then the mixture was kept in a water bath at 60 °C for 24 hours. The obtained gray color silver sol was centrifuged at 6000 r min−1 for 10 min, and the precipitate was washed with twice distilled water three times. The obtained sample was ultrasonically dispersed in 2 mL double distilled water to form an AgNT sol with a concentration of 1.7 mg mL−1.
The AgNTs/TNA heterostructure was prepared by dropping 100 μL AgNT sol uniformly on the surface of the 1.5 × 1 cm2 TNA and drying in air. The obtained AgNTs/TNA heterostructure was further applied for Raman measurements.
2.4 Raman measurement process
R6G was selected as the probe molecule for testing the performance of the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure. 2.5 μL solutions of R6G with the concentration ranging from 10−7 to 10−10 M were dropped onto the AgNTs/TNA substrates. The solvent was allowed to evaporate under ambient conditions for SERS detection. The detection of other additives such as CV, MG, and Thiram was carried out by using the same procedure. Ten different points were randomly selected on each substrate to analyze the reproducibility of the substrate.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Morphologies and composition characterizations of the TNA, AgNTs and AgNTs/TNA heterostructure

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the SEM images of the TNA and AgNTs/TNA heterostructure, respectively, and the insets are their corresponding enlarged images. As can be seen in Fig. 1(a), TNAs with an average diameter of about 150 nm and length about 3.0 μm were orderly grown on the conductive surface of FTO (Fig. S2, ESI†). The ordered nanorod array could provide more surface area for AgNT immobilization. Furthermore, the gaps between the adjacent TiO2 nanorods could form strong electromagnetic magnetic (EM) enhancement regions to enhance the Raman signal.41Fig. 1(b) shows that most of the AgNTs are attached to the top of the TNA and some on the side to form the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure. Fig. 1(c) shows that the Ag particles are triangular with the average diameter of about 200 nm. Because AgNTs on the TNA surface have sharp corners and edges, it will help to form a more effective and sufficient ‘hot spot’ and cause a large near-field enhancement effect. In addition, the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure has high surface area and can attach more Raman reporter molecules.

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of FTO, TNA/FTO and AgNTs/TNA were displayed in Fig. 1(d). Compared with FTO, TNA and AgNTs/TNA have three characteristic peaks at 36.1°, 41.2° and 62.8°. These peaks correspond to the (101), (111) and (002) diffraction of the rutile phase of TiO2, respectively (JCPDS no. 78-2485). Compared with TNA, no diffraction peaks correlated with Ag appear on the AgNTs/TNA. This meant that AgNTs deposited on TNA were in an amorphous state and the coverage of AgNTs on the TNA didn’t vary the crystalline phase of the TNA. The results of XRD analysis showed that AgNTs/TNA without foreign matter was successfully constructed.

Fig. 1(e) shows the UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectra of TNA and AgNTs/TNA. TNA can only absorb ultraviolet light with a wavelength less than 410 nm before the deposition of AgNTs, because the band-to-band electronic transition of rutile TNA is about 3.0 eV. After AgNTs were deposited, TNA exhibited an enhanced ability to absorb visible light from 410 to 800 nm, which could be attributed to the local surface plasmon resonance effect of the assembled AgNTs. The results confirmed the enhanced light absorption of TNA in the presence of AgNTs. Due to its metal semiconductor heterostructure, AgNTs/TNA substrates have the combined effect of EM excited by AgNTs LSPR and CE induced by carrier transfer between the AgNTs and adjacent TNA, enhancing the Raman signals.42
3.2 Effect of the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure on the SERS response

Fig. 1(f) shows the SERS spectra of R6G (10−6 M) probe molecules on the TNA, Ag nanoparticle/TNA (AgNPs/TNA), AgNTs, AgNTs/TNA and AgNTs/TiO2 nanoparticle substrates. Peaks located at around 1649, 1574, 1506, 1360, and 1310 cm −1 were observed on the AgNTs, AgNTs/TNA and AgNTs/TiO2 nanoparticle substrates. These peaks are considered as the CC bond stretching vibrations of the benzene of R6G.20 The Raman signals of R6G (10−6 M) on the TiO2 substrate were very weak. The Raman intensity of the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure substrate was about twice that of the AgNTs substrate, while the Raman strength on the Ag NPs/TNA substrate is only 4% that of the AgNTs substrates. Such large Raman signal enhancement on the AgNTs/TNA substrate is due to the synergetic effects of plasmons and charge transfer.42 Furthermore, the Ag triangular plate shape with more tips, edges and highly active sites has a higher LSPR effect, which also contributes to the enhancement of the Raman signals. The contribution of TNAs to the SERS signal was also proved by Fig. 1(f). The Raman signal of R6G on AgNTs/TNT was about 1.5 times larger than that on AgNPs/TiO2. The enhanced SERS signal may be ascribed to the large surface area, high aspect ratio and good uniformity of TNT, and the strong electromagnetic magnetic enhancement regions formed from the gaps between the adjacent TiO2 nanorods.39,41
3.3 Analytical performance of the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure
The application of the AgNTs/TNA substrates for the detection of R6G, CV, MG and Thiram was demonstrated. Fig. 2(a)–(d) show the Raman spectra of the four samples. Fig. 2(b) shows the SERS spectra of CV adsorbed on AgNTs/TNA substrates. The characteristic peak at 1172 cm−1 was the in-plane vibration of ring C-H of CV.43 In Fig. 2(c), the peak observed from MG at 1621 cm−1 is due to ring C–C stretching.43 The main peaks at 1380 cm−1 from Thiram (Fig. 2d) were caused by the δ (CH3) vibration mode.44 The limit of detection for R6G (Fig. 2a), CV (Fig. 2b), MG (Fig. 2c) and Thiram (Fig. 2d) was 10−10 M, 10−9 M, 10−8 M and 10−7 M, respectively. Table S1 (ESI†) shows the performance comparison of different Raman substrates. It can be seen that the designed substrate is better or comparable to others.

CV and MG are frequently added in aquaculture because of their low price and good sterilization effects.45,46 However, CV, MG and their metabolites have carcinogenic, teratogenic, mutagenic and other toxic side effects.47 Many countries have listed them as prohibited drugs in aquaculture.48 Therefore, the detection of CV and MG residues in real samples is necessary. In order to demonstrate the practical application of the AgNTs/TNA heterostructures, the substrates were used to detect CV and MG residues in crayfish on site. Before testing, the crayfish was soaked in spiked CV or MG aqueous solution overnight, and then the crayfish shell surface was attached to the substrates. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show that 10−8 M CV and 10−7 M MG could be detected by using the AgNTs/TNA substrate.

The simultaneous detection of CV and MG was also performed. Fig. 3(c) shows the Raman spectra of CV (10−6 M), MG (10−5 M) and a mixture of CV and MG (1:1). At the same time, due to the addition of tertiary amine groups in CV, the SERS spectra of MG and CV also showed some obvious different characteristics. It can be seen from Fig. 3(c) that CV has 567 cm−1 (aromatic ring skeleton vibration) and 1542 cm−1 (ring C–C stretching) peaks, which was not presented in the MG spectrum.49 Similarly, MG's peak at 973 cm−1 (δ(C–H)), 1222 cm−1 (C–H rocking) and 1488 cm−1 (out of plane vibration of aromatic ring) did not appear in the CV Spectra.50 But these peaks belonging to CV and MG all appeared in their mixture spectrum, and the peak intensity ratio was consistent with their concentration ratio. These results indicate that the AgNTs/TNA substrates can be applied for the detection of mixtures. It has great potential for real sample detection.
3.4 Reproducibility and stability of the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure
The uniformity and reproducibility of the SERS substrates are also key parameters for the application of SERS as a routine and sensitive analysis tool. The SERS signals of the 10−7 M R6G peak at 1362 cm−1, 1510 cm−1, and 1649 cm−1 were measured at 10 points to evaluate the uniformity of the AgNTs/TNA substrate. As shown in Fig. 4(a), (b), (c) and (d), all data fluctuate slightly around the average value, within a range of ± 10%. The small deviation between different points on the same substrate indicated that the AgNTs/TNA had good spatial uniformity for SERS determination. The stability of the AgNTs/TNA substrate was also checked. Fig. 4(e) and (f) show that the SERS intensity remained around 70% after the AgNTs/TNA substrate was kept for 30 days. Based on these results, we can conclude that the uniformity and stability of the AgNTs/TNA are acceptable for practical SERS applications.

3.5 Recyclable properties of the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure
The recyclable properties of this AgNTs/TNA substrate were studied. 10−7 M R6G was taken as the probe molecule, and the substrate was regenerated through a simple UV degradation process. Four detection–degradation cycle experiments on the AgNTs/TNA substrate were conducted. When the AgNTs/TNA heterostructure was exposed under UV irradiation, a large number of electrons were excited and left holes (h+) in the valence band. The electrons would be captured by the oxygen adsorbed on the surface of the heterostructure and produce superoxide radicals. Because of the strong oxidant ability of superoxide radicals, organic molecules can be directly oxidized and subsequently break down the bridge of the probes and the substrates. AgNTs in the heterostructure would act as traps for capturing photo-induced electrons and holes, reduce the electron–hole recombination in the photodegradation process, and strengthen the interface electron transfer and hole/electron pair separation, thereby improving the photodegradation efficiency. The disappearance of the probe Raman signals indicated the reliability of the recyclable strategy. The same substrate was again used for R6G detection and photodegradation study. All the SERS signals appeared and disappeared after photodegradation again. Fig. 5 shows that although the SERS intensity was reduced after each UV degradation process, the substrates could still be reused four times.

4 Conclusion
In this study, a metal–semiconductor heterostructure with surface clean rutile TNA material and AgNTs was formed to show the Raman surface enhancement effect and photocatalytic degradation performance. The results show that AgNTs/TNA substrates (metal semiconductor heterostructures) have higher Raman signal enhancement due to the combined effects of plasma and charge transfer. R6G (10−10 M), CV (10−9 M), MG (10−8 M) and Thiram (10−7 M) were detected by using the heterostructure substrate. Moreover, it was proved that the AgNTs/TNA substrates had good analytical performance by detecting sample residues on real samples and a mixture of CV and MG (1:1). The AgNTs/TNA substrates can be cleaned by UV light irradiation, providing the possibility for substrate recovery. The heterostructure substrate with uniformity, reproducibility, reusability and enhanced SERS signal can be used not only for highly sensitive SERS detection but also for photodegradation and solar cell applications.
