    , Accepted 25th March 2022First published on 30th March 2022AbstractRemoval of antibiotics from aqueous solution by semiconductor photocatalysis has aroused much attention, yet developing high-performance visible-light-driven photocatalysts remains a huge challenge. Herein, red phosphorus/borocarbonitride (RP/BCN) heterojunction photocatalysts were fabricated by growing RP nanoparticles on BCN nanosheets through a vaporization–deposition method. A series of characterization techniques verified the formation of the heterojunction and the improved photo-electric properties. Benefiting from the strong optical absorption and effective photocarrier separation, the RP/BCN composites showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity towards tetracycline (TC) degradation. After 90 min of visible light illumination, a TC degradation ratio of 73.8% could be achieved over the optimized photocatalyst with an apparent rate constant of 0.0224 min−1, which was almost 7.5 and 13.2 folds higher than that of pristine RP and BCN, respectively. The possible degradation pathways of TC were illustrated by identifying the reaction intermediates using UPLC-MS analysis. Such improvement was ascribed to the formation of a type-II heterojunction with the intimate interfacial contact between RP and BCN, which greatly facilitated the spatial separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, the radical capturing experiments ascertained that the generated holes and superoxide radicals dominated TC degradation. Based on these results, a reasonable mechanism was proposed to depict the photocatalytic degradation of TC over RP/BCN heterojunction composites. This work is expected to pave the way for constructing high-efficiency BCN-based heterojunction photocatalysts towards environmental protection.

Environmental significance
Tetracycline (TC) is a type of broad-spectrum antibiotic, and its abuse brings about a huge risk to human health and the ecosystem. Semiconductor photocatalysis has been considered to be a highly efficient and environmentally benign technology for the removal of TC. Unfortunately, traditional single-component photocatalysts suffer from their intrinsic drawbacks of poor optical absorption of solar light and the high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers, and these limitations seriously restrict their photocatalytic performance. Extensive research proved that the rational design and construction of nanocomposite heterojunction photocatalysts could achieve sufficient sunlight absorption and efficient charge separation. Herein, a series of red phosphorus/borocarbonitride (RP/BCN) composite photocatalysts were prepared by a vaporization–deposition method. RP not only grew in situ on the surface of BCN in the form of nanoparticles, but also might deposit in the pores of BCN, which could greatly accelerate the carrier migration. The resulting RP/BCN composites displayed an imposing photocatalytic activity for TC degradation under visible light. After 90 min of illumination, a TC degradation ratio of 73.8% could be achieved over the optimized RP/BCN-40 sample with an apparent rate constant of 0.0224 min−1, which was almost 7.5 and 13.2 times as high as that of RP and BCN, respectively. Such improvement could be primarily ascribed to the strong optical absorption, effective photocarrier separation, and formed type-II heterojunction structure. In addition, the possible degradation pathways of TC were illustrated by identifying the reaction intermediates. And a possible mechanism for TC degradation was also proposed based on the matched band structure of the single component as well as the results of the radical trapping experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance measurement. It is hoped that this work will offer a meaningful reference for designing and constructing high-efficiency BCN-based heterojunction photocatalysts towards environmental protection.

1. Introduction
Recently, water contamination by antibiotics has become a widespread concern for environmental issues,1,2 where numerous antibiotic residues are detected in aquatic ecosystems such as surface water, groundwater, and drinking water due to their abuse in animal husbandry and the pharmaceutical industry.3,4 Among them, tetracycline (TC), as a type of broad-spectrum antibiotic, has been frequently used to prevent and treat various microbial diseases over the last several decades.5 Unfortunately, TC can hardly be metabolized by animals and human bodies, and long-term exposure may breed antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes, which poses a huge risk to human health and the effectiveness of antibiotic pharmaceuticals.6,7 Thus, it is necessary to clean water up and obtain harmless water through the efficient removal of TC from the contaminated environment.
Great efforts have been made for developing a series of techniques to eliminate and degrade TC from aqueous solution, including physical adsorption, biodegradation, electrochemical oxidation, and photocatalytic degradation.8–11 Among these methods, semiconductor-based photocatalysis is well known to effectively degrade TC into carbon dioxide and water under sunlight without introducing chemical reagents owing to its high efficiency, environmental benignity, and low cost.12–14 Multitudinous inorganic and organic photocatalysts are exploited for the degradation of TC, such as TiO2, g-C3N4, CdS, perylene diimide, and others.15–19 In recent years, a new metal-free photocatalyst called borocarbonitride (BCN) has shown a regulable bandgap and electronic structure, visible-light response, high chemical stability, and non-toxicity.20–23 It has emerged in various photoredox catalysis applications except for TC degradation, such as carbon dioxide fixation, water splitting, N-heterocycle dehydrogenation, and rhodamine B removal.24–27 Our previous work demonstrated that BCN nanosheets possessed excellent photocatalytic activity for uranyl reduction with a separation ratio of 97.4% after 1.5 hours of visible light illumination.28 However, just as other single-component semiconductors, BCN also suffers from intrinsic drawbacks such as poor optical absorption of solar light as well as the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and these limitations seriously restrict its photocatalytic performance.29,30 Tremendous studies proved that the rational design and construction of a BCN-based heterojunction could achieve sufficient sunlight absorption and efficient charge separation.31–33 Choosing an appropriate semiconductor to couple with BCN is of vital importance, and it should meet the following requirements: (i) a narrow bandgap for strong optical absorption; (ii) a suitable band structure to match with BCN for the accelerated migration of photoinduced carriers; and (iii) a facile preparation route to obtain adequate interfacial contact for efficient charge transportation.
Very recently, red phosphorus (RP), an earth-abundant and easily available element, has been found as a promising elemental photocatalyst with high catalytic performance due to its narrow bandgap (∼1.8 eV), extensive visible-light absorption extending to 700 nm, and photo-stability under visible light (>90 h).34–36 RP-based materials appear in various applications of photocatalysis and optical-electrical conversion, including the photocatalytic degradation of TC.37–39 Lei et al. prepared an RP decorated iron-based metal–organic framework with excellent photocatalytic activity for TC degradation (90.1% in 80 min).40 Zou et al. developed an RP/hollow hydroxyapatite microsphere composite, bringing about the rapid degradation of TC within 10 min under simulated sunlight.41 Compounding with RP could improve the optical absorption and photocarrier migration of materials, leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance. As a result, the coupling of RP with BCN is highly desired to construct a new wide-spectral-responsive photocatalyst that fully utilizes solar energy for TC degradation.
In this study, RP/BCN heterojunction photocatalysts were constructed through a vaporization–deposition method from a mixture of BCN and RP. Both the spectroscopic technique and microscopic observation indicated that RP nanoparticles were immobilized on BCN nanosheets and the heterojunction structure was indeed formed. The photocatalytic activity of RP/BCN was evaluated by the degradation of TC under visible light. The possible degradation pathways of TC and the degradation mechanism of RP/BCN were proposed. This contribution is thought to provide a promising strategy for developing visible-light-active BCN-based heterojunction photocatalysts for potential applications in environmental decontamination.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals and materials
Boric acid (H3BO3, 99.0%) and red phosphorus (P4, denoted as RP, 99.999%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. Urea (CON2H4, 99.0%), glucose (C6H12O6, 99.8%), carbon disulfide (CS2, 99.0%), isopropanol ((CH3)2CHOH, denoted as IPA, 99.7%), ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.7%), and sodium sulphate (Na2SO4, 99.0%) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (C10H16N2O8, denoted as EDTA, 99.5%) and benzoquinone (C6H4O2, denoted as BQ, 98.0%) were bought from Saan Chemical Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Tetracycline (C22H24N2O8, denoted as TC, 99.0%) and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (C6H11NO, denoted as DMPO, 97.0%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18.25 MΩ cm was produced by the Kertone Lab Vip water purification system. All reagents were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of the photocatalysts
BCN nanosheets were prepared by a facile pyrolysis method based on our previous report as follows: 4.8 g of urea, 0.2 g of boric acid, and 0.16 g of glucose were fully ground on an agate mortar.28 The mixed precursor was put into an alumina corundum ark and calcined at 900 °C for 5 h in a horizontal tube furnace under high-purity N2 atmosphere. The light yellow powder was obtained by washing the products with hot HCl solution (0.1 M), ultrapure water and ethanol, and drying overnight.
The commercial RP was refined to remove the oxide layers before use. Typically, 1 g of bulk RP was fully ground and dispersed into 60 mL of ultrapure water. Next, the suspension was transferred into a 100 mL polyparaphenol lined autoclave, and then hydrothermally treated at 200 °C for 12 h. The red products were collected, washed with ultrapure water and ethanol, and dried overnight.
In a typical procedure for the synthesis of RP/BCN heterojunction photocatalysts, 200 mg of BCN was fully ground with an appropriate amount of RP. The mixture was transferred into a 10 mL quartz tube, which was sealed using an oxygen-hydrogen flame under low vacuum conditions (−0.1 MPa). And this tube was heated at 450 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace, and then returned to room temperature at a cooling rate of 1 °C min−1. After breaking the tube, the products were washed with CS2, ethanol and ultrapure water, and dried overnight. The as-prepared samples were labeled as RP/BCN-x, where x (x = 10–50) denotes the mass percent of RP to BCN.
2.3 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a powder diffractometer (TTR-III, Rigaku) operating at 40 kV and 200 mA with Cu-Kα radiation as the X-ray source (λ = 1.5418 Å). Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected using a Thermo Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was conducted using a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI spectrometer with monochromatic 200 W Al Kα radiation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The elemental mapping was also examined on the microscope equipped with an INCA energy system (Oxford Instruments). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained at 77.35 K using a Micromeritics ASAP2020M+C apparatus. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the samples were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a SOLID3700 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a Horiba JY Fluorolog-3-Tou steady-state/lifetime spectrofluorometer. Total organic carbon (TOC) was measured using a Shimadzu TOC-L analyzer. The analysis of degradation intermediates was performed with a XEVO G2-XS QTOF mass spectrometer coupled to an ACQUITY UPLC H-Class PLUS system (UPLC-MS) using ESI in positive-ion mode. The mobile phase was the mixture of acetonitrile–water (10:90, v/v, 0.1% formic acid contained in water) at a flow rate of 0.25 mL min−1. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of the spin-trapped paramagnetic species with DMPO was tested with a JEOL JES-FA200 spectrometer. In a typical procedure, 2 mg of sample was dispersed into 1 mL of methanol, and then 0.1 mL of DMPO was added into this dispersion for the detection of DMPO–˙O2− signals.
The photo-electric properties were evaluated in a three-electrode cell using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation, equipped with an Ag/AgCl electrode saturated with KCl as the reference electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The working electrode was prepared through following procedure: 8 mg of sample was dispersed by constant sonication into 1 mL of isopropanol/ultrapure water (volume ratio of 1:1) solution with 60 μL of Nafion solution (5%). Then, the obtained slurry was pasted uniformly on FTO glass substrates with a coating area of 1 × 1 cm2. 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 6.0) was used as the electrolyte in all the electrochemical tests. A 300 W Xe lamp with a cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) was chosen as the visible light source.
2.4 Photocatalytic tests
The photocatalytic activity of RP/BCN composites was assessed by TC degradation under visible light. Typically, 20 mL of reaction suspension containing 10 mg of photocatalyst and 0.02 mg mL−1 of TC was prepared. Then, the suspension was transferred into a 50 mL cylindrical quartz tube, which was laid in a photochemical reactor equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 420 nm). Prior to illumination, the reaction suspensions were magnetically stirred for 30 min in the dark to reach an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between TC and photocatalysts. During the illumination, a 2 mL aliquot was periodically sucked out and filtered to remove the photocatalyst. The filtrate was used to determine the concentration of the remaining TC by UV-vis spectrophotometry at 357 nm. The remaining TC could be expressed as At/A0, and the degradation ratio (X) of TC was calculated according to eqn (1): X = (A0 − At)/A0 × 100%(1)where A0 and At denote the absorbance of TC in the filtrate at the initial time and after illumination for time t, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
The RP/BCN heterojunction composites were prepared by a vaporization–deposition method, as depicted in Fig. 1. BCN samples were mixed evenly with different contents of RP, followed by sealing into quartz tubes under vacuum conditions. During the calcination, RP vaporized to form phosphorus gas due to its low sublimation temperature of 416 °C. Then, with the condensation of RP gas, RP would deposit on BCN to obtain the RP/BCN composites. The color of the samples turned from light yellow to brown as the RP level increased, indicating that more RP was deposited on BCN.

According to the XRD patterns (Fig. 2a), two characteristic diffraction peaks located at ∼27° and ∼43° could be observed for BCN and RP/BCN samples, corresponding to the (002) and (100) crystal planes of BCN with a graphite-like structure, respectively. One main diffraction peak at ∼15° was attributed to the (102) crystal face of pure RP.42,43 As for RP/BCN samples, the position of these peaks remained unchanged and no other new peaks appeared, suggesting that these samples were composites of RP and BCN. And the increasing intensities of the RP diffraction peaks indicated that the amounts of RP in RP/BCN composites were gradually raised with the increase in RP content in the precursor mixture, further confirming that more RP anchored on BCN. In addition, the characteristic FT-IR vibration modes of RP/BCN were almost identical to those of pure BCN (Fig. S1†), indicating that the deposition of RP would not affect the original chemical structure of BCN.

The chemical composition of the resultant RP/BCN was deciphered by XPS analysis. The apparent P 2p signals in the survey spectra (Fig. 2b) indicated the existence of phosphorus in RP/BCN composites. Elemental analysis by XPS (Table S1†) revealed the gradually increased phosphorus amount with increasing amount of RP in the synthesis procedure, clearly supporting the hypothesis that more RP was deposited on BCN. As shown in Fig. 2c, the N 1s peak could be deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 398.1 eV and 398.8 eV, corresponding to the N–B and N–C bonds in the BCN matrix, respectively. The C 1s signal at 284.8 eV was ascribed to the graphitic carbon (C–C), while the two shoulder peaks at 283.8 eV and 286.0 eV were assigned to C–B and C–N bonds, respectively. The B 1s signal distinguished three peaks located at 189.8 eV (B–C), 190.6 eV (B–N), and 192.3 eV (B–O), with the latter potentially being the terminating structure. After the introduction of RP, a new peak attributed to B–B bonds appeared at 187.5 eV, indicating that elemental boron was produced under high-temperature phosphorus vapor. The P 2p spectra exhibit spin–orbit doublets situated at 130.3 eV and 131.1 eV corresponding to elemental phosphorus. And the peak at 133.8 eV was ascribable to P–N coordination, suggesting that P atoms might replace B atoms in the BCN substrate to form the P–N bonds, which served as the nucleation sites to grow RP.44 Obviously, the relative intensity of elemental phosphorus as well as the P–N bonds in these heterojunctions rose depending on the increase of RP amount in the precursor mixture. Consequently, these results intensively verified the heterojunction formation between RP and BCN.
The morphology of the sample was inspected with TEM. The bare BCN presented a well-defined sheet-like nanostructure with an adjacent lattice spacing of 0.346 nm, corresponding to the (002) crystal face of BCN (Fig. S2a and b†). After the deposition of RP, many nano-sized RP particles were loaded on the surface of BCN nanosheets by comparing the color and shape (Fig. 3a and S2a†). Distinct lattice fringes can be observed with a fringe distance of 0.535 nm, assigned to the (001) crystal face of Hittorf's RP,45,46 which together with elemental mapping images confirmed the existence of RP (inset in Fig. 3a and b). Interestingly, the highlights of P element were more uniform than RP nanoparticles anchored on the BCN matrix, which hinted that partial RP might not be observed directly. Previous work demonstrated that BCN nanosheets presented porous structure with the crowded small-sized pores.28,47 From FE-TEM images (Fig. S2c and d†), the density of these small-sized pores was significantly reduced after the deposition of RP, indicating that RP might deposit in the pores. And this view was also echoed with the diminished pore volume of the small pores in the size range of 1–5 nm and the decreased specific surface area (Fig. S3†). Therefore, we can deduce that RP not only attached on the surface of BCN, but might also deposit in the pores of BCN, where such a structure could effectively accelerate carrier separation and transfer.

The optical properties of a photocatalyst play an important role in its photocatalytic activity. Fig. 4a illustrated that BCN was capable of absorbing little visible light, while RP displayed a distinguished visible light-harvesting ability. After depositing RP on BCN, the optical absorption of the samples substantially increased in the visible-light region (λ > 420 nm) compared with that of BCN. And with the increased content of RP, RP/BCN composites exhibited incremental increases in absorption intensities and progressive redshifts of the absorption edge. This may be a matter of the surface sensitization effect of RP, resulting in the broad and strong visible light absorption in the region of 400–700 nm for RP/BCN composites.48 In turn, the optical change was also embodied in the gradient evolution of sample color from yellow to brown with the increase in the RP level (Fig. 1). From Fig. 4b, compared with that of BCN, the photoluminescence intensities of RP/BCN composites significantly attenuated, and the intensities were gradually quenched with the increased RP fraction, implying the lower recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Therefore, RP/BCN with high RP content possessed enhanced visible-light absorption and high separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers, and was expected to show excellent photocatalytic performance.

The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared RP/BCN composites was assessed upon the degradation of TC under visible light. From the temporal evolution of the UV-vis absorption spectra of TC using RP/BCN-40 as a photocatalyst, a sharp decline in the characteristic absorption peak (λ = 360 nm) could be observed as the exposure time increased, revealing that the TC molecules were decomposed (Fig. 5a). After 90 min of exposure, the constant absorbance indicated that the TC degradation reaction had reached its maximum. From Fig. S4,† the TOC removal efficiency of TC increased with increasing illumination time. And the TOC removal efficiency reached 19.5% after 90 min of illumination, indicating that TC in aqueous solution could be effectively mineralized into CO2, H2O, and some inorganic species over RP/BCN-40 under visible light. As could be seen from Fig. 5b, the TC concentration hardly changed in the absence of a photocatalyst during visible exposure, showing its stable nature and negligible self-decomposition. In the case of pure BCN and RP, only 15.5% and 25.1% of TC were respectively decomposed after illumination for 90 min. The TC degradation was significantly enhanced using RP/BCN heterojunctions as photocatalysts. After 90 min of illumination, the degradation ratios of TC were 23.4% for RP/BCN-10, 47.0% for RP/BCN-20, 51.3% for RP/BCN-30, 73.8% for RP/BCN-40, and 53.2% for RP/BCN-50, and the corresponding apparent rate constants were calculated to be 0.0028, 0.0074, 0.0082, 0.0224, and 0.0082 min−1 according to the pseudo-first-order kinetic equation (−ln(Ct/C0 = kt)) (Fig. 5c). The rate constant of RP/BCN-40 was 13.2 and 7.5 times as high as that of BCN (kBCN = 0.0017 min−1) and RP (kRP = 0.0030 min−1), respectively, which exceeded most of the reported photocatalysts for TC degradation (Table S2†). It was found that the photocatalytic activity gradually augmented as the content of RP increased to 40% in RP/BCN composites, while the activity decreased when the RP content rose to 50%. These results could be explained by the fact that with the increase of the RP amount in the samples, more heterojunction interface would be produced between PR nanoparticles and BCN nanosheets, which promoted the separation of photoinduced holes and electrons, benefiting the photocatalytic reaction.49 Nevertheless, if the RP amount raised to excess, lots of RP nanoparticles loaded on the surface of BCN would prevent BCN from harvesting visible light to generate carriers, causing the weak interfacial charge transfer in the RP/BCN heterojunctions, where consequently the photocatalytic activity markedly declined.50

The degradation products of TC were identified by UPLC-MS analysis to uncover the photocatalytic degradation pathways. As shown in Fig. S5,† the mass peak at m/z = 444 corresponded to the TC molecule, and thirteen kinds of intermediates were detected with main mass peaks of m/z = 481, 437, 419, 393, 387, 348, 343, 327, 305, 283, 261, 217 and 174. According to the possible molecular structure deduced from m/z values and reported results,51 two degradation pathways of TC over RP/BCN-40 were proposed (Fig. 6). For pathway I, product M1 (m/z = 419) was produced by the hydroxylation and deamidation of TC, which fragmented to product M2 (m/z = 391) via the removal of methyl from tertiary amine and hydroxyl oxidation. Subsequently, product M2 would be decomposed to M3 (m/z = 343) and M4 (m/z = 347) through the cleavage of the benzene rings and elimination of a hydroxyl (and the addition of a hydroxyl and dehydration). The further degradation products M5–M8 with lower molecular weight were generated accompanied by the elimination of hydroxyl and N-methyl, cleavage of the benzene rings, and removal of acetyl. In the second pathway, product M9 (m/z = 478) was formed by the hydroxylation, removal of methyl from tertiary amine, and aromatic ring-opening process. And then M9 was disintegrated to simpler products (M10–M13 and M8) through the following reactions, such as the elimination of amidogen, hydroxyl, ketone group, carboxyl, and amino, and the cleavage of the carbon–carbon double bond with methyl and hydroxyl. So it could be seen that TC had been gradually decomposed to the relevant intermediates, which finally converted into CO2, H2O, and other small-molecule products.

In view of the optimal catalytic activity, the interfacial charge transfer property of RP/BCN-40 was further evaluated by transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). From Fig. 7a, the photocurrent density of RP/BCN-40 was much higher than that of RP and BCN under visible light. It further proved that the introduction of RP could improve distinctly the separation of photoinduced carriers of BCN, which was also supported by EIS analysis (Fig. 7b). RP/BCN-40 displayed a smaller arc radius of the Nyquist plot compared with RP and BCN, indicating its lower charge transfer resistance. These results demonstrated that the RP/BCN-40 heterojunction composite possessed excellent interfacial charge transfer performance.

To gain insight into the interfacial structure, the DMPO-EPR technique was applied to determine the existence of superoxide radicals (˙O2−) in the reaction system. There were no obvious signals in the dark (Fig. 8a). Once exposed to visible light, the strong characteristic quadruple peak for DMPO–˙O2− was observed, indicating that ˙O2− radicals could be generated during the photoreaction over RP/BCN composites. Then, radical trapping experiments were conducted to identify the active reactive species in the process of TC photodegradation. Specifically, 1 mmol of sacrificial agent like IPA, EDTA, and BQ was added into the initial reaction solution to capture hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), holes (h+), and ˙O2−, respectively. From Fig. 8b, the introduction of IPA hardly affected the degradation ratio, while the photodegradation of TC was greatly inhibited in the existence of EDTA and BQ, where the degradation ratios decreased to 22.9% and 45.2%, respectively. It was well understood that both h+ and ˙O2− radicals were dominant contributors in TC degradation over RP/BCN photocatalysts.

The electronic band structure of RP/BCN heterojunction composites was determined by Tauc plot analysis and electrochemical Mott–Schottky curves of RP and BCN. The bandgap was calculated using the Kubelka–Munk equation as follows: αhv = A(hv − Eg)n/2(2)where α, hv, and A represent the absorption coefficient, photon energy, and a constant, respectively. The value of n was determined by the nature of the semiconductor electronic transition. For RP (direct-gap semiconductor) and BCN (indirect-gap semiconductor), the n values were 1 and 4, respectively.49,52 So the Eg values were calculated to be approximately 1.99 eV for RP and 2.28 eV for BCN (Fig. S6†), which were close to reported values.53 According to the intercept values of Mott–Schottky curves (Fig. S7†), the flat band potentials of RP and BCN were estimated to be −0.20 V and −1.37 V (vs. NHE), respectively. And they matched a typical n-type semiconductor due to the positive slopes in different potential regimes. Generally speaking, the conduction band (CB) potential was more negative by approximately 0.1 V compared to the flat band potential of an n-type semiconductor,54,55 so the CB potentials were −0.30 V for RP and −1.47 V for BCN (vs. NHE). The corresponding valence band (VB) potentials were calculated to be 1.69 V and 0.81 V (vs. NHE). Because the CB and VB potentials of BCN were both lower than those of RP, the interleaving energy band formed a traditional type-II heterojunction. Affected by the built-in electric field in the heterojunction region, the photo-induced electrons on the CB of BCN could readily transfer to the CB of RP, while the holes migrate from the VB of RP to the VB of BCN. Therefore, electrons and holes were enriched on the CB of RP and the VB of BCN, respectively, which realized the spatial separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the RP/BCN composite.
In light of the aforementioned results, the mechanism for the photocatalytic TC degradation over RP/BCN composites under visible light was proposed and is depicted in Fig. 8c. Under visible light illumination, both RP and BCN were excited to produce electron–hole pairs. Owing to the built-in electric field in the type-II heterojunction, the electrons on the CB of BCN could shift to the CB of RP, and the holes on the VB of RP also transferred to the VB of BCN, facilitating the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The CB potential of RP was more negative than that of O2/˙O2− (−0.046 eV vs. NHE), so the accumulated electrons on the CB of RP could capture O2 to yield ˙O2−. As for TC degradation, TC molecules were firstly adsorbed on the surface of photocatalysts, and then the reactive radical species (holes and ˙O2−) could degrade TC molecules into the intermediates and ultimate products, such as CO2, H2O, and other inorganic species.
4. Conclusions
RP/BCN heterojunction composites were prepared by a vaporization–deposition method for the photocatalytic degradation of TC. It was found that RP not only grew in situ on the surface of BCN in the form of nanoparticles, but also might deposit in the pores of BCN, which could greatly accelerate the carrier migration. The introduction of RP enhanced effectively the visible-light absorption and separation efficiency of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. The resulting RP/BCN composites showed an imposing photocatalytic performance for the degradation and mineralization of TC under visible-light illumination. After 90 min of illumination, a TC degradation ratio of 73.8% could be achieved over the optimized RP/BCN-40 photocatalyst with an apparent rate constant of 0.0224 min−1, which was almost 7.5 and 13.2 times as high as that of RP and BCN, respectively. The improvement could be primarily ascribed to the formed type-II heterojunction between RP and BCN, where the spatial separation of photo-induced charges was boosted distinctly. In addition, the results of radical trapping experiments and DMPO-EPR measurements revealed that both h+ and ˙O2− radicals were the major reactive species in the process of TC degradation. The possible degradation pathways of TC were proposed through the identification of degradation intermediates by UPLC-MS analysis. Ultimately, the photocatalytic mechanism of RP/BCN heterojunction composites for TC degradation was also proposed under visible light. Our work might offer a meaningful reference to design and construct highly-efficient visible-light-driven BCN-based heterojunction photocatalysts for environmental remediation.

Environmental significance
Tetracycline (TC) is a type of broad-spectrum antibiotic, and its abuse brings about a huge risk to human health and the ecosystem. Semiconductor photocatalysis has been considered to be a highly efficient and environmentally benign technology for the removal of TC. Unfortunately, traditional single-component photocatalysts suffer from their intrinsic drawbacks of poor optical absorption of solar light and the high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers, and these limitations seriously restrict their photocatalytic performance. Extensive research proved that the rational design and construction of nanocomposite heterojunction photocatalysts could achieve sufficient sunlight absorption and efficient charge separation. Herein, a series of red phosphorus/borocarbonitride (RP/BCN) composite photocatalysts were prepared by a vaporization–deposition method. RP not only grew in situ on the surface of BCN in the form of nanoparticles, but also might deposit in the pores of BCN, which could greatly accelerate the carrier migration. The resulting RP/BCN composites displayed an imposing photocatalytic activity for TC degradation under visible light. After 90 min of illumination, a TC degradation ratio of 73.8% could be achieved over the optimized RP/BCN-40 sample with an apparent rate constant of 0.0224 min−1, which was almost 7.5 and 13.2 times as high as that of RP and BCN, respectively. Such improvement could be primarily ascribed to the strong optical absorption, effective photocarrier separation, and formed type-II heterojunction structure. In addition, the possible degradation pathways of TC were illustrated by identifying the reaction intermediates. And a possible mechanism for TC degradation was also proposed based on the matched band structure of the single component as well as the results of the radical trapping experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance measurement. It is hoped that this work will offer a meaningful reference for designing and constructing high-efficiency BCN-based heterojunction photocatalysts towards environmental protection.
