    , Accepted 1st December 2020First published on 4th January 2021AbstractIn-depth research of the active sites and charge transport behavior is an important topic for investigating photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Herein, a novel photocatalyst composed of flake-like porous graphitic carbon nitride (P-CN) and CsPbBr3 is fabricated via a high temperature calcination and freeze drying method. The experimental results show that P-CN/CsPbBr3 has a superior CO2 reduction efficiency, and that the yield of CO reaches 30.39 μmol g−1, which is about 7.2 and 1.2 times higher than those of the primary B-CN (4.2 μmol g−1) and CsPbBr3 (24.4 μmol g−1), respectively. The improvement in photocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to the heterostructure, which can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers, and the porous structure of P-CN, which can improve the absorption capacity of CO2. This study provides a significant method for the construction of efficient g-C3N4 based photocatalysts to reduce CO2.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of human society, the consumption of fossil energy is gradually increasing, resulting in continuous emissions of greenhouse gases.1,2 This has led to a series of malignant consequences, such as global warming and rise in sea levels.3–5 As an important type of greenhouse gas, CO2 represents a significant threat to the ecological balance of the earth and the living environment of human beings. Therefore, rational utilization of CO2 has become an urgent problem. Nowadays, photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is considered to be an effective way to convert it into a variety of high value-added chemical fuels.6–8
It is generally known that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted extensive attention in reducing CO2 because of its suitable energy band structure, convenient preparation, unique physical and chemical stability and rich earth resources.9,10 For example, Inoue et al. have explored the Z-scheme Ag3PO4/g-C3N4 composite for reducing CO2 to produce hydrocarbon fuels in a water suspension.11 Wang et al. have synthesized a g-C3N4/ZnTe system, greatly improving the performance of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.12 Li et al. have constructed Au/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with high yields of CO and CH4 under UV light irradiation.13 It is undeniable that photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is one of the most effective ways to relieve environmental problems and the energy crisis. Although the g-C3N4 based photocatalysis technology has made remarkable progress, there are still some problems, such as the rapid recombination of charges and the low adsorption capacity of CO2, leading to the unsatisfactory reduction activity of CO2.14–17
According to the current research, the construction of a mesoporous structure seems to be an effective method to improve the CO2 adsorption capacity of a semiconductor, because the porous structure can provide a large specific surface area, which can increase the adsorption sites of CO2, and activate CO2 molecules.18–20 For instance, Chen et al. have reported a porous hollow spherical structure, Zn–Ni-MOFs, with high specific surface area, which can increase the CO2 absorption performance.21 Liang et al. have designed porous CoN structures, which display attractive CO2 reduction activity.22 Mo et al. have synthesized porous nitrogen-rich g-C3N4 nanotubes for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.23 Therefore, the preparation of a porous g-C3N4 structure may improve the adsorption capacity of CO2. However, the lifetime of photocarriers seriously affects the reduction activity of CO2, because electrons are the main reaction species in the CO2 reduction process, so how to improve the utilization of photocarriers is particularly important.
In recent years, many heterogeneous photocatalysts have been widely used to improve the activity of semiconductors. For example, Ou et al. have successfully prepared a graphene-decorated 3D flower-like BiVO4 compound material, and the interaction between BiVO4 and graphene greatly reduces the recombination of photoinduced carriers, thus significantly improving the photocatalytic activity.24 Wu et al. have developed a NiFe-LDH/Cu2O photocatalyst, and put forward a feasible Z-scheme mechanism to maintain the photogenerated charge lifetime under the condition of high redox potential.25
In addition, halide perovskite materials have attracted much attention due to their high extinction coefficient, good conductivity, long lifetime of photogenerated carriers and wide light absorption.26,27 Liu et al. have explored Sn-doped CsPbBr3 glass by using Sn instead of Pb by melt quenching, which has excellent stability and optical properties.28 Liu et al. have synthesized an anti-solvent-treated perovskite solar cell with more efficient charge transport, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 8.55%.29 Jiang et al. have successfully prepared a Z-scheme α-Fe2O3/Amine-RGO/CsPbBr3 photocatalyst for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.30 Due to the formation of interface interactions in the heterojunction, the lifetime of photogenerated carriers is effectively prolonged, and the performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction is 8.3 times higher than that of pure CsPbBr3.30 Therefore, it can be inferred from the above analysis that the composite of CsPbBr3 and porous g-C3N4 may prolong the lifetime of photogenerated carriers and ultimately enhance the activity of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
On the basis of the above research, a P-CN/CsPbBr3 photocatalyst with a lamellar porous structure is successfully fabricated by high temperature calcination and freeze drying, and it is applied to CO2 reduction. Furthermore, we have acquired a systematic understanding of the microstructure, morphology, and optical and electronic properties of the P-CN/CsPbBr3 photocatalyst by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), transient fluorescence (FL), photoluminescence spectra (PL), transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), etc. It is exciting that the P-CN/CsPbBr3 displays excellent photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction under the all-optical spectrum. Ultimately, the mechanism of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is analyzed in detail. This study provides a new possibility for the construction of a g-C3N4 based photocatalyst by using halide perovskite as a semiconductor in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
The chemical reagents used in this experiment are melamine (99%), dodecanol (99%), sodium dodecyl sulfonate (98%), gum arabic, Cs2CO3 (99%), octadecene (90%), oleic acid (AR), PbBr2 (99%), oleylamine (C18: 80–90%), and n-hexane (97%), all purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, while ethanol (C2H5OH, 95%) is purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Deionized water is used throughout the whole experiment.
2.2. Synthesis of bulk g-C3N4
3.0 g of melamine is put into a crucible, and then transferred to a muffle furnace and calcined at 500 °C for 2 h. Afterwards, it is heated up to 550 °C for another 2 h with the heating rate of 2.3 °C min−1. Finally, bulk g-C3N4 (B-CN) is obtained.
2.3. Preparation of CsPbBr3
Initially, 0.3 g of Cs2CO3 is added to a mixed solution containing 40 mL of octadecene and 2.5 mL of oleic acid, and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 0.5 h. It is then heated to 150 °C until Cs2CO3 reacts completely with oleic acid. After this, 0.21 g of PbBr2 is dissolved into 15 mL of octadecene in another beaker. 1.5 mL of oleylamine and 1.5 mL oleic acid are injected into the above solution. When the PbBr2 is completely dissolved, the mixture is heated to 150 °C and 1.2 mL of Cs-oleate solution is quickly injected. 30 s later, the mixture is cooled in an ice water bath. Finally, the product is washed in a centrifuge with n-hexane several times and dried at 40 °C for 12 h.
2.4. Preparation of P-CN/CsPbBr3
In experiment 2.3, when PbBr2 is completely dissolved, B-CN is poured into the mixture, and then the temperature is increased to 150 °C. The other steps are the same as experiment 2.3 to obtain B-CN/CsPbBr3. Subsequently, 0.5 mL of dodecanol, 0.2 g of sodium dodecyl sulfonate, 0.2 g of gum arabic and a certain amount of the above mixture are scattered in 10 mL of deionized water. After stirring at 60 °C for 20 min, the compound is frozen for 24 h. Subsequently, the mixture is placed in a vacuum freeze-drying machine to freeze for 24 h. After this, the samples are dried at 100 °C for 24 h. Finally, the products are washed in a centrifuge with ethanol several times and dried at 100 °C for 24 h. The content of B-CN/CsPbBr3 is 0.05 g, 0.2 g, 0.3 g, and 0.4 g, respectively, and the samples with different contents are labeled as P-CN/CsPbBr3-1, P-CN/CsPbBr3-2, P-CN/CsPbBr3-3, and P-CN/CsPbBr3-4. The method for preparing porous g-C3N4 (P-CN) is the same as that of P-CN/CsPbBr3, except that B-CN/CsPbBr3 is changed to B-CN.
2.5. Characterization
The crystal structure of the photocatalytic material was studied using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer, equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation X-ray source, which was scanned in the range of 10–80° at a rate of 7° min−1. The structure and chemical bonds of the molecule were studied by FT-IR (Magna-IR 550). The surface chemical valence state of the catalyst was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, EScalab 250×). The morphology and structure of the materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2000-CX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7800F). The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of the photocatalytic materials was determined using a UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrometer (UV-3600) with BaSO4 as the standard substrate. The measurement range was 200–800 nm. The specific surface area and pore diameter of the photocatalytic materials were analyzed using an automatic specific surface and porosity analyzer (NDVA-2000e). The optical properties of the photocatalyst were analyzed using a photoluminescence detector.
2.6. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the liquid phase is performed in a custom-built glass reactor with a 300 mL volume. Cooling water from a chiller is passed through the jacketed wall of the reactor to control the temperature at 25 °C. A 300 W Xe lamp is used as a light source. First, 0.05 g of photocatalyst is dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water in a glass reactor under magnetic stirring. Before light irradiation, CO2 gas is brought into the above solution for 10 min to eliminate air and to build up a saturated CO2 solution. Subsequently, the lamp is turned on to start the photoreaction. During the reaction process, photocatalytic materials were taken from the enclosed light at 1 h intervals. The type and content of the product were measured every 1 h using a gas chromatography (GC-7920, China) detector. The isotope labeling experiment used 13CO2 instead of 12CO2, and the products were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS, 7890A and 5975C, Agilent).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and morphology analysis
The microstructure and morphology of B-CN, P-CN, CsPbBr3 and P-CN/CsPbBr3 are researched by TEM. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the obtained B-CN presents a massive structure with a smooth surface. However, the P-CN has an obvious porous structure (Fig. 1b), the distinctive structure being beneficial to its lightness and floatability, and once immersed in the precursor solution, not only can the solution flow in and out freely, but also the active substance can be deposited uniformly.31,32 Notably, in Fig. 1c, CsPbBr3 has an overlapping flake structure with a small average grain diameter of about 9 nm.33,34 In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 1d that CsPbBr3 is evenly distributed and P-CN and CsPbBr3 are fixed together. The intimate interface between CsPbBr3 and P-CN makes the complex have an effective electron transfer passageway. The large specific surface area of P-CN/CsPbBr3 (66.6725 m2 g−1) may result from the porous structure, which will provide more active sites for the reduction of CO2. In the HRTEM image (Fig. 1e), B-CN and CsPbBr3 show clear lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.31 nm and 0.29 nm, corresponding to (002) and (200) lattice faces, respectively. Additionally, the SEM images and EDX mapping spectrum of P-CN/CsPbBr3 are displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†), and C, N, Cs, Pb and Br elements, can be detected, which further proves the successful synthesis of P-CN/CsPbBr3.

The structure and composition of the as-prepared photocatalyst were investigated by XRD characterization. As displayed in Fig. 2, B-CN shows two typical peaks at 13.1° and 27.4°, corresponding to the (100) and (002) plane with a graphitic structure (JCPDS#87-1526), respectively.35,36 Furthermore, CsPbBr3 exhibits several peaks at 14.9°, 21.1°, 26.3°, 30.4°, 37.4° and 43.4°, which are ascribed to the (100), (110), (111), (200), (211) and (202) crystal planes, in accordance with JCPDS card No. 18-0364.37 For P-CN, the diffraction peak position is not obviously changed. Moreover, the XRD pattern of P-CN/CsPbBr3 is similar to that of P-CN, but the diffraction peak intensity is slightly weaker, which may originate from the low coordination content and the smaller size of CsPbBr3 on the surface of P-CN, which is consistent with the above TEM analysis.

Fig. 3A shows that the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of all samples are type-IV curves with a H3 hysteresis loop, revealing that they all have the characteristics of a mesoporous structure. The specific surface areas of B-CN, CsPbBr3, P-CN and P-CN/CsPbBr3 are 9.4, 18.4, 42.7 and 66.7 m2 g−1, respectively. The larger BET surface can provide more active sites and improve the mass transfer performance, which is conducive to enhancing the reducibility of CO2. The pore size of all the as-prepared samples is 9.8, 7.1, 34.3, and 21.2 nm, respectively (Fig. 3B). The slight decrease in the pore size of P-CN/CsPbBr3 may be caused by the CsPbBr3 loaded on the surface of P-CN, and the close contact interface between CsPbBr3 and P-CN may accelerate the electron transport.37

3.2. Surface composition analysis
The elements and surface chemical states of the as-prepared photocatalysts were determined using XPS. The XPS spectra of B-CN and P-CN/CsPbBr3 (Fig. 4a) verify that C and N are the co-owned and predominant elements, while Cs, Br and Pb are unique elements of the as-prepared P-CN/CsPbBr3, indicating that the P-CN/CsPbBr3 photocatalyst was successfully synthesized. Fig. 4b shows the C 1s spectrum of B-CN, possessing three types of carbon species located at 284.8, 286.1 and 288.2 eV, which are respectively associated with the adventitious type carbons (SP3, C–C), the sp2 C atom on the aromatic ring connected with the –NH2 group and the sp2-bonded carbon of NC–N in the aromatic ring.38,39 Similarly, the C 1s peaks of P-CN/CsPbBr3 are also fitted into three secondary peaks. It is worth noting that the peak strength of XPS corresponding to the C–C bond of P-CN/CsPbBr3 is obviously enhanced, while the intensity of the sp2-bonded carbon is significantly weakened, which may be caused by CsPbBr3 covering the surface of P-CN. The N 1s XPS spectrum of B-CN (Fig. 4c) can be decomposed into four separate peaks, and the binding energies at 398.4, 399.6, 401.2 and 404.1 eV are assigned to the sp2-hybridized nitrogen of the CN–C functions, the N-(C)3 tertiary nitrogen, C-NH2, and pi–pi (star transition), N–O nitrogens, respectively.40,41 As for P-CN/CsPbBr3, the peaks of N-(C)3 and C-NH2 left shift to 400.2 and 403.4 eV, which implies the combination of chemical bonds between P-CN and CsPbBr. It also indicates that there is a strong chemical and electronic coupling interaction between P-CN and CsPbBr3. According to Fig. 4d, the peaks at 724.4 and 738.2 eV are assigned to Cs 3d3/2 and Cs 3d5/2 of CsPbBr3 in P-CN/CsPbBr. There are two characteristic peaks that appeared at 138.8 and 143.8 eV (Fig. 4e), corresponding to tetravalent Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2, respectively.42 In Fig. 4f, the binding energies of Br 3d in the P-CN/CsPbBr3 composite are seated at 68.3 and 69.2 eV, belonging to Br 3d5/2 and Br 3d3/2, respectively. In conclusion, the P-CN catalyst may form new chemical bonds with CsPbBr in P-CN/CsPbBr3, which is helpful for the reduction reaction.

Fig. 5 shows the FT-IR spectrum of the different as-prepared samples. For B-CN, the absorption peak range of 1200–1700 cm−1 is assigned to the typical stretching modes of C–N or CN, and the signal at 806 cm−1 represents the vibration mode of the s-triazine unit.43 In addition, it can be seen from the spectra of P-CN that the absorption peaks are weakened and there are no other peaks, indicating that the P-CN is mainly composed of B-CN.41 Furthermore, the characteristic peak of CsPbBr3 at 1759 cm−1 can correspond to the CO stretching vibration band of oleic acid.42 The chemical bands at 2922 and 2857 cm−1 are ascribed to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of –CH3.42 Noticeably, P-CN/CsPbBr3 not only displays the characteristic absorption peaks of P-CN, but also shows the peaks of CsPbBr3. In comparison with P-CN, the characteristic peaks of 806 cm−1 and 1200–1700 cm−1 become stronger, which is beneficial for enhancing the reduction effect.

The Raman spectra of the as-prepared samples are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The Raman modes of D and G at 1232 and 1345 cm−1 are ascribed to the interlayer stacking structure of B-CN, and the characteristic peaks located at 489, 700 and 960 cm−1 are assigned to the vibration modes of B-CN43–45 (Fig. S2a, ESI†), and these stretching vibration characteristic peaks can also be detected in P-CN (Fig. S2b, ESI†). Furthermore, two peaks signaled at 147 and 320 cm−1 are attributed to the vibrational mode of [PbBr6]4− octahedra and motion of Cs+ cations (Fig. S2c, ESI†), respectively.46 The results are well matched with the previous literature. It is worth noting that the P-CN/CsPbBr3 displays all the peaks mentioned above, but the vibration peak intensities are generally weakened owing to the small amount of CsPbBr3 introduction, and its vibrations suppress the C–N and CN stretching modes (Fig. S2d, ESI†). Compared with pure CsPbBr3, the peak at 320 cm−1 in P-CN/CsPbBr3 slightly shifts, which means the formation of a new chemical bond between CsPbBr3 and P-CN. The chemical bond may be in favor of the transport of photogenerated carriers, and thus more conducive to the photocatalytic reaction of CO2.
3.3. Photoelectrochemical analysis
The optical absorption properties of the as-prepared samples were investigated by UV-vis DRS. In Fig. 6A, B-CN exhibits obvious absorption in the visible light region, with the absorption boundary at 450 nm,45 while the absorption edge of CsPbBr3 is position at 556 nm. In addition, the absorption edge of P-CN obviously shifts to 470 nm compared with B-CN, which may be caused by the pore structure confinement effect. However, the P-CN/CsPbBr3 exhibits a similar absorption range compared to P-CN, which may be due to the little addition of CsPbBr3. Conclusively, the band gaps of B-CN, CsPbBr3, P-CN and P-CN/CsPbBr3 are acquired according to the plots of (αhν)1/2vs. photon energy,42 and the values are calculated to be 2.58, 2.23, 2.53 and 2.45 eV (Fig. 6B), respectively.
 Fig. 6  (A) UV-vis DRS and (B) band gaps of (a) B-CN, (b) CsPbBr3, (c) P-CN and (d) P-CN/CsPbBr3. 
The ability of carrier separation and recombination in the semiconductors is revealed. The PL spectra of B-CN, CsPbBr3, P-CN and P-CN/CsPbBr3 at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm are depicted in Fig. 7a. It should be noted that the PL intensity of P-CN/CsPbBr3 is higher than those of the other samples. The reason may result from the higher photocarrier concentration gathered on the P-CN/CsPbBr3 surface, rather than the higher recombination rates of photoinduced electron–hole pairs.47 The charge transfer kinetics of B-CN, CsPbBr3, P-CN and P-CN/CsPbBr3 are investigated by FL spectra (Fig. 7b), and the average fluorescence longevities are calculated to be 2.02, 1.72, 2.2 and 2.85 ns, respectively. The longer the lifetime of the photocarriers, the more likely they are to participate in the photocatalytic reaction of CO2 and enhance the activity.48 Thus it can be seen that after CsPbBr3 loading, the heterojunction has been successfully prepared, which can effectively prolong the lifetime of the photocarriers.49

The photocurrent responses of B-CN, CsPbBr3, P-CN and P-CN/CsPbBr3 are recorded to further reveal their photocatalytic properties. The photocurrent intensity of P-CN/CsPbBr3 is obviously the highest, and is approximately 1.5 times higher than that of B-CN and 1.7 times higher in comparison with P-CN (Fig. 8A), respectively, indicating that the P-CN/CsPbBr3 has the highest charge transfer ability. In order to further evaluate the separation ability of electron–hole pairs, EIS measurement has also been conducted (Fig. 8B). The arc radius of the Nyquist circle for P-CN/CsPbBr3 is smaller than that of P-CN, indicating that the introduction of CsPbBr3 contributes to decreasing the interfacial electron transport barrier of P-CN/CsPbBr3, which implies more effective electron transfer capability, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity.50

3.4. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 activities

Fig. 9a shows the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activities of B-CN, CsPbBr3, P-CN and P-CN/CsPbBr3 under full spectrum irradiation. The CO yield of P-CN is 3.1 times higher than that of B-CN, and the flake porous structure is the main reason for the increase in activity. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of P-CN/CsPbBr3-2 is the highest (30.39 μmol g−1), and is 7.2 times, 2.4 times and 1.2 times the CO yields of B-CN, P-CN and CsPbBr3, respectively. The commendable performance is benefitted from the porous structure of the P-CN, improving the adsorption and mass transfer properties.51 Furthermore, the heterostructure interface between P-CN and CsPbBr3 enables the photo-induced carriers to quickly separate, which makes more electrons participate in the reduction reaction, thus enhancing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.52
 Fig. 9  (a) Time courses of photocatalytic CO2 evolution over different as-prepared samples, and (b) photocatalytic CO2 evolution yields of different as-prepared samples under full spectrum irradiation. 
In addition, the photocatalytic performance of P-CN/CsPbBr3 with different contents of CsPbBr3 is depicted in Fig. 9b. It can be seen that P-CN/CsPbBr3-2 has the highest yield of CO (30.39 μmol g−1) compared with the other photocatalysts. However, the photocatalytic activity is not ideal with increasing CsPbBr3 content. This phenomenon can be attributed to the over-modification of CsPbBr3 covering some active sites, which hinders the charge transfer and light absorption. The activity tests of the above materials show that the synergistic effect of the porous structure of g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3 can effectively improve the reduction ability of CO2.
Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the stability of CO2 conversion over P-CN/CsPbBr3-2 under 30 h of continuous light irradiation. The CO2 reduction activity of P-CN/CsPbBr3-2 is not significantly reduced, and the yield is still around 27.50 μmol g−1 (Fig. S3a, ESI†), which indicates that P-CN/CsPbBr3-2 has superior photostability. In order to further verify the cycling stability of P-CN/CsPbBr3-2, the structure of the samples before and after cycling was characterized by XRD analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. S3b (ESI†). As expected, the structure of the samples before and after cycling does not change much, indicating once again that P-CN/CsPbBr3-2 has excellent stability and reusability. Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†) respectively exhibit the XPS, TEM and FESEM of P-CN/CsPbBr3 after photoreduction of CO2, which also confirm the stability of P-CN/CsPbBr3. In addition, in order to demonstrate the source and content of the products in the process of CO2 photoreduction, isotope tracing experiments were carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the results are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It is observed that obvious signals appear at m/z = 29 (13CO) and m/z = 28 (12CO), which confirms that CO is derived from the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over P-CN/CsPbBr3.
3.5. Mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 reduction
Based on the above analyses, the possible photocatalytic reduction of CO2 mechanism and photogenerated carrier transfer path of P-CN/CsPbBr3 is illustrated in Fig. 10. As the P-CN and CsPbBr3 have well matched band structures, a heterojunction can be formed between P-CN and CsPbBr3. The electrons on the valence bands (VBs) of CsPbBr3 and P-CN migrate to the corresponding conduction bands (CBs) under light illumination, resulting in the formation of electron–hole pairs. According to Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†), when CsPbBr3 contacts with P-CN to form a heterojunction structure, although the CB position of CsPbBr3 (−0.75 eV) is more negative than that of P-CN (−0.38 eV), and the VB position of P-CN (2.19 eV) is more positive than that of CsPbBr3 (1.52 eV), the CB potential of P-CN is not negative enough to produce CO (−0.53 eV), and therefore it can be directly inferred that the two semiconductors form a Z-scheme heterojunction. The specific path of electron transfer is as follows: the electrons accumulated in the CB of P-CN will spontaneously transfer to the holes of CsPbBr3 (eqn (1)–(3)).53 Meanwhile, the CB potential of CsPbBr3 (−0.75 eV) is more negative than that of Eθ (CO2/CO) = −0.53 eV, therefore CO2 can be reduced to CO (eqn (4)). The photoinduced holes derived from P-CN can oxidize water to generate O2 and H+54,55 (eqn (5)). This transfer mechanism is beneficial to inhibit the recombination of photocarriers and improve the photocatalytic performance of P-CN/CsPbBr3. CsPbBr3 + hν → CsPbBr3 (e− + h+)(1) P-CN + hν → P-CN (e− + h+)(2) P-CN (e−) → CsPbBr3 (h+)(3) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O(4) 2H2O + h+ →4H+ + O2 + 4e−(5)

Conclusion
In summary, a porous g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalyst loaded with CsPbBr3 (P-CN/CsPbBr3) is successfully synthesized. In comparison with B-CN and CsPbBr3, the CO yield of P-CN/CsPbBr3 is significantly increased to 0.3039 μmol g−1, which is about 7.2 times and 1.2 times higher than that of B-CN and CsPbBr3, respectively. It should be admitted that the enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction properties can be attributed to an accepted fact that the porous structure can increase the specific surface area, expose more active sites, and enhance the adsorption capacity of CO2. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between the P-CN and CsPbBr3 heterojunction can improve the carrier concentration and accelerate charge separation and transfer, which has been proved by photocurrent, PL, FL and EIS analysis. Therefore, our work offers a highly efficient photocatalyst for CO2 reduction and provides a new perspective for the research on porous g-C3N4 based catalysts.
