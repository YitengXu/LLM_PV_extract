    , Accepted 3rd April 2018First published on 4th April 2018AbstractHerein, we theoretically and experimentally investigated the mechanisms of charge separation processes of organic thin-film solar cells. PTB7, PTB1, and PTBF2 have been chosen as donors and PC71BM has been chosen as an acceptor considering that effective charge generation depends on the difference between the material combinations. Experimental results of transient absorption spectroscopy show that the hot process is a key step for determining external quantum efficiency (EQE) in these systems. From the quantum chemistry calculations, it has been found that EQE tends to increase as the transferred charge, charge transfer distance, and variation of dipole moments between the ground and excited states of the donor/acceptor complexes increase; this indicates that these physical quantities are a good descriptor to assess the donor–acceptor charge transfer quality contributing to the solar cell performance. We propose that designing donor/acceptor interfaces with large values of charge transfer distance and variation of dipole moments of the donor/acceptor complexes is a prerequisite for developing high-efficiency polymer/PCBM solar cells.
I. Introduction
As is well-known, efficient exciton dissociation into separated electron and hole states (free carriers) leads to increased photocurrent, thus enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells.1 It is increasingly recognized that one of the puzzling problems to be clarified in the mechanism of action of organic thin-film solar cells is whether the charge separation (CS) of an electron and a hole is a hot or a cool process. An electro-optical pump–push experiment2 has shown that in efficient photoconversion systems, the hot-state charge delocalization is more dominant than the energy-gradient-driven intermolecular hopping for CS. In a similar way, using a Green's function approach to calculate the generation rates of the charge transfer (CT) states, it was found that exciton dissociation led to partially separated charges, the final states of which were the hot CT states, with the electron and the hole situated far from the interface.3
This challenging issue has been addressed in terms of the lowest CT state (CT1)4 and the long-range and energetically higher CT states at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface.5 In the former case, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was found to be essentially independent of whether states higher than that of CT1 were excited or not. In addition, this study found that CT1, which was weakly bound and had an energy close to that of the CS state, generated charge at a high efficiency (>90%) at all photon energies equal to and larger than the energy of CT1. In contrast, in the latter case, it was confirmed that the energetically higher CT states (hot CT excitons) had several advantages over the short-range CT states. That is, the hot CT excitons are usually spatially delocalized and therefore not easily trapped by the attractive Coulomb force between an electron and a hole. In addition, their external quantum efficiency (EQE) is much higher than that of the low-lying CT states that are accessible via the internal conversion process.4
Recent studies have focused on the importance of the variation in dipole moments for efficient charge generation.6–9 Yu et al. have suggested that the variation in the dipole moments in intramolecular charge transfer in the donor molecule (denoted as ΔμD) is crucial for controlling the PCE.6,7 They showed that an internal dipole moment along the polymer chain was critical in maintaining the pseudo-charge-transfer characteristics and compared the PCEs of PBB3 and PTB7 copolymers, which had smaller and larger dipole moments, respectively; the latter had a larger PCE and JSC as compared to the former. On the other hand, we have confirmed via experiments and quantum chemistry calculations on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the complexes of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based donors and a PCBM acceptor that the variation in dipole moments between the ground and excited states of the D/A complexes (ΔμD/A), rather than ΔμD, plays a crucial role in determining the solar cell efficiency.8,9
Despite numerous conjectures on the most probable CS mechanisms proposed to date, a satisfactory consensus has not yet been obtained. Therefore, to investigate the matter further, it is desirable to identify some likely descriptors to quantify the CS efficiency. In this study, we proposed to use the transferred charge (denoted as ΔQ), the charge transfer distance (denoted as dCT), and ΔμD/A as promising descriptors for estimating the CS efficiency.10,11 ΔQ, dCT, and ΔμD/A are easily calculable using the widespread density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), and we can numerically ascertain the correlation between ΔQ, dCT, ΔμD/A, and CS efficiency. Furthermore, it would be useful to design highly efficient organic solar cell materials based on the first-principles calculation.
This study has three principal aims: (1) to experimentally determine whether the CS process takes place by a hot or a cool process in the PTB7/PC71BM, PTB1/PC71BM, and PTBF2/PC71BM systems; (2) to numerically examine whether direct optical generation of CT states takes place in the CS process of these systems; and (3) to show that dCT and ΔμD/A are promising descriptors for the quantification of the CS efficiency of organic solar cells.
II. Methods
Theoretical
The quantum chemistry calculations of the absorption spectra of D/A complexes were performed using the GAUSSIAN 09 program package.12 The molecular structures were optimized using the DFT calculations at the ωB97XD/6-31G(d) level of theory. For the D/A complexes, we considered PTB7, PTB1, and PTBF2 as the donor molecules and PC71BM as the acceptor molecule (see Fig. 1). The hydrocarbon side chains of the donor molecules are replaced by the methyl group. The absorption spectra of the D/A systems were obtained by TD-DFT at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.13,14

Experimental
Materials
Polymer donors, poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) (Mw = 122000 g mol−1, Mw/Mn = 2.4) and poly[[4,8-bis(octyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][2-[(dodecyloxy)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB1, Mw = 83000 g mol−1, Mw/Mn = 3.7) were obtained from 1-Material Inc. and Luminescence Technology Crop., respectively, and used as received. An acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, nanom spectra E112) was obtained from Frontier Carbon and used as received.
Sample preparation
Neat films of PTB7 and PTB1 were prepared on sapphire substrates by spin-coating from chlorobenzene:1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 weight ratio) solutions. Blend films of PTB7/PC71BM and PTB1/PC71BM were prepared on sapphire substrates by spin-coating from chlorobenzene:1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 weight ratio) solutions of the polymer and PC71BM. The polymer:PC71BM weight ratio in the solution was 1:1.5.
Transient absorption (TA) measurements
TA data were obtained using a femtosecond pump and probe TA spectroscopy system, which consisted of a TA spectrometer (Ultrafast Systems, Helios) and a regenerative amplified Ti:sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Hurricane).16 The temperature dependence of the TA signals was obtained from 77 to 294 K in vacuum using a cryostat (Optistat DN-V, Oxford Instruments) fitted with a temperature control unit (ITC503S, Oxford Instruments). The excitation of the polymer/PC71BM blend films was conducted at the wavelength of 680 nm or 740 nm to excite the polymer mainly.
III. Results and discussion
Absorption and TA spectra
Absorption spectra of the PTB7/PC71BM and PTB1/PC71BM blend films used for the TA measurements are shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of the PTB7/PC71BM (black) and PTB1/PC71BM (red) blend films. The polymer: PC71BM weight ratio is 1:1.5. 

Fig. 3a and b show the TA spectra of the PTB7 and PTB1 neat films, respectively, measured at 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ps after excitation at 680 nm. Both polymer donors showed a negative TA spectrum below 750 nm corresponding to the transient ground-state bleach, which was determined by comparing the data with the steady-state absorption spectrum (Fig. 2). The broad positive TA signal that ranges at wavelengths longer than 750 nm and peaks at around 1350 nm is assigned to the singlet excitons of polymer donors. After 1000 ps, these TA signals disappear. Fig. 3c and d show the TA spectra of the PTB7/PC71BM and PTB1/PC71BM blend films, respectively, measured at 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ps after excitation at 680 nm. The spectral features at wavelengths longer than 750 nm are clearly different from those in the spectra of the polymer singlet excitons, even 1 ps after excitation, and the TA signal still remains at time domains longer than 1000 ps. The spectral features of the new TA signal are very similar to those of polymer hole polarons, which are obtained by doping the polymer neat films with iodine (Fig. 4). We therefore ascribed the TA signals with a peak at 1100 nm, as shown in Fig. 3c and d, to polymer hole polarons generated at the polymer/PC71BM heterojunctions.

The excitation wavelength was 680 nm and the intensity was 5 μJ cm−2 (polymer neat films), 1.25 μJ cm−2 (PTB7/PC71BM), and 2.5 μJ cm−2 (PTB1/PC71BM). TA spectra of the polymer neat films were measured at 294 K and those of the polymer/PC71BM blend films were measured at 77 K.

Charge generation
As shown in Fig. 3, for the PTB7/PC71BM blend film, no TA signal from PTB7 singlet excitons is observed even 1 ps after excitation; this indicates that charge generation is completed at <1 ps. For the PTB1/PC71BM blend film, TA signals from both PTB1 singlet excitons (at 1350 nm) and hole polarons (at 1100 nm) are observed at 1 ps after excitation, whereas the TA signal from singlet excitons rapidly disappears within a few tens of ps. To analyze the charge generation dynamics in the PTB1/PC71BM blend film, we resolved the TA spectra into PTB1 singlet exciton and charged species by spectral simulation. Herein, the TA spectrum at 1000 ps after excitation was used as a spectrum of the charged species. Fig. 5 shows the time evolution of the PTB1 hole polarons at 1100 nm. Herein, 60% of PTB1 hole polarons were promptly generated at <1 ps, and the subsequent delayed charge generation ended at 50 ps. Immediate charge generation that is completed at <1 ps demonstrates that charge transfer (exciton dissociation) occurs very quickly in both PTB7/PC71BM and PTB1/PC71BM blend films, as has been reported for other polymer/PCBM blend films.17 The delayed charge generation observed in the PTB1/PC71BM blend film is attributed to a diffusion-controlled process, which represents the time required for the polymer singlet exciton to diffuse to the polymer/PC71BM heterojunctions.

Charge recombination

Fig. 6 shows the decay dynamics of the polymer hole polarons at 1100 nm. The ΔOD was normalized; the maximum peak intensities at 1 ps for the PTB7/PC71BM blend and at 50 ps for PTB1/PC71BM were set to 1. For the PTB7/PC71BM blend film, the ΔOD did not decay within the time domain from 1 to 1500 ps. For the PTB1/PC71BM blend film, on the other hand, the time evolution of ΔOD on a time domain of >50 ps was represented by the sum of a decay component with a lifetime of several hundreds of ps and a non-decaying component: ΔOD = Aexp(−t/τ) + B. Moreover, the decay lifetime was independent of the excitation intensity at laser intensities below 10 μJ cm−2; this suggested monomolecular recombination. The non-decaying component observed for both polymer/PC71BM blend films was ascribed to the spatially separated free carriers that survived against the recombination. In contrast, the decay component observed for the PTB1/PC71BM blend film was ascribed to geminate charge recombination. On the basis of these assignments, the free carrier generation efficiency (η) was defined from the fraction of the non-decaying charges in the whole generated charges. The value of η was estimated to be 100% for PTB7/PC71BM and 80% for the PTB1/PC71BM blend film, as summarized in Table 1.

The experimentally observed EQE differed between all the D/A combinations (Table 2) at 65–70%, 55–60%, and ∼45% for the PTB7/PC71BM, PTB1/PC71BM, and PTBF2/PC71BM systems, respectively. This implies that the difference in EQE is one of the factors governing JSC. The origin of this difference can be clarified based on the finding that the value of η is 100% in the PTB7/PC71BM system and 80% in the PTB1/PC71BM system, which is quantitatively consistent with the superior EQE and JSC observed in the PTB7/PC71BM system.18

In addition, we examined whether the free carrier generation process was a temperature-independent hot process or a temperature-dependent cool process by measuring the temperature dependence of η. Then, the η values were confirmed from Fig. 6 to be temperature independent between 77 and 294 K, indicating that exciton dissociation into a spatially separated free hole and electron was a temperature-independent process; that is, the exciton dissociation surviving monomolecular recombination should not be a thermally activated process on an uphill energy surface from the lowest CT state. Namely, the main route of the free carrier generation is the hot process in both the PTB7/PC71BM and PTB1/PC71BM systems. In other words, the PTB7/PC71BM system has a superior solar cell performance primarily due to the efficient free carrier generation via the hot process in this system.
Theoretical descriptors
To clarify the reason behind the efficiency of free carrier generation, we investigated the charge transfer mechanisms at the PTB/PC71BM interface using quantum chemistry calculations. In Fig. 7, the stabilization energies (in eV) are plotted versus the intermolecular distance between the donor and acceptor molecules (Å), and the most stable intermolecular structures of the PTB7/PC71BM (Fig. 7a), PTB1/PC71BM (Fig. 7b), and PTBF2/PC71BM (Fig. 7c) systems when PC71BM is placed facedown on the donor molecule are illustrated. It can be seen that the stabilization energies are ≈0.33 eV, ≈0.37 eV, and ≈0.43 eV for the PTB7/PC71BM, PTB1/PC71BM, and PTBF2/PC71BM systems, respectively. Intermolecular energy minima are present at the intermolecular distances of ≈3.5 Å in Fig. 7a, ≈3.2 Å in Fig. 7b, and ≈3.0 Å in Fig. 7c. The stabilization energies and the intermolecular energy minima are reasonably correlated; that is, as the latter decreases, the former increases. For the intermolecular distances between the fullerenes and π-functional donors, Borges et al.19 estimated 3.19 Å for PTB1/PC61BM at the PBE(D)/SV-SVP level and Liu and Trois20 estimated 3.5 Å for poly(3-methylthienylene)/PC61BM at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.

Fig. 8 shows the numerically calculated absorption spectra of the representative D/A systems optimized in Fig. 7 (three-unit donor/one-molecule acceptor: PTB7/PC71BM, PTB1/PC71BM, and PTBF2/PC71BM). Herein we have employed the three-unit donors for realistically performing quantum calculations. The absorption spectra seem to be almost identical in all the D/A combinations, and the most intense components of the absorption spectra include a D/A character. The latter fact indicates that an efficient charge transfer may take place in all the D/A combinations. In addition, it is noted that many absorption peaks have a D/A character at wavelengths other than that of the absorption peak. Overall, the absorption spectra show almost the same tendency in all the D/A systems, as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a and the experimentally observed spectrum18 do not agree for the reasons explained in Section 2 of the ESI.† In Table 2, it can be seen that the experimentally observed EQE is quite different between all the D/A combinations. Therefore, by comparing Fig. 8 and Table 2, it can be concluded that there is no correlation between the absorption spectra of the D/A complexes and solar cell performance. Table 3 summarizes the percentage of D/A and D/D transitions at the strongest absorption peak. The molecular orbitals involved in the absorption transitions are shown in Fig. 9, 10, and 11 for the PTB7/PC71BM, PTB1/PC71BM, and PTBF2/PC71BM systems, respectively.

In Table 3, the direct D/A absorption transitions to the more highly excited CT configurations can be found for the PTB7/PC71BM system (3% for HOMO−2 → LUMO+1 transition, 3% for HOMO−1 → LUMO+4 transition, and 10% for HOMO−1 → LUMO+5 transition, i.e., 16% in total), whereas there are slightly less direct D/A absorption transitions to the more highly excited CT configurations for the PTB1/PC71BM system (3% for HOMO−2 → LUMO transition, 5% for HOMO−2 → LUMO+1 transition, 7% for HOMO → LUMO+1 transition, i.e., 15% in total). The percentage is even smaller for the PTBF2/PC71BM system (7% for HOMO−1 → LUMO+4 transition and 3% for HOMO → LUMO+2 transition, i.e., 10% in total). This difference is the reason why the free carrier generation via a hot process is more probable in the PTB7/PC71BM system because the direct D/A absorption transition to highly excited states is one of the direct consequences of the high density of states (DOS's) of the spatially extended highly excited CT states.5

Table 2 shows the amount of transferred charge (ΔQ), the charge transfer distance (dCT), and the variation of the dipole moments between the ground and excited states of the D/A complexes (ΔμD/A) calculated according to the literature9,10 in the PTB7/PC71BM, PTB1/PC71BM, and PTBF2/PC71BM systems. It can be seen that the EQE and JSC become larger as ΔQ, dCT, and ΔμD/A increase (in particular, the PTB7/PC71BM system is better than the PTBF2/PC71BM system). This agrees with the observation reported in the literature7,8 that ΔμD/A increases as the EQE increases. This comparative examination indeed indicates that ΔQ, dCT, and ΔμD/A, rather than ΔμD, are good descriptors for assessing the donor quality contributing to the solar cell performance.
Based on these results, ΔQ, dCT, and ΔμD/A (but not necessarily ΔμD) can be seen as the key factors for controlling the EQE; thus, the design of D/A interfaces with large values of ΔQ, dCT, and ΔμD/A is a prerequisite for developing high-efficiency polymer/PCBM solar cells.
IV. Conclusion
We have experimentally and theoretically investigated the mechanism of CS processes of the PTB7/PC71BM, PTB1/PC71BM, and PTBF2/PC71BM systems in detail in the quest for descriptors governing the organic solar cell efficiency. We have summarized our findings as follows.
First, from TA spectroscopy, it has been found that the difference in the EQEs for the polymer/PCBM systems is well correlated with the difference in the free carrier generation efficiencies. Second, from the comparison between the numerical absorption spectra and the experimentally observed EQE, we found that there was no correlation between the absorption characteristics of D/A complexes and solar cell performance. Third, because the transferred charge, the charge transfer distance, and the variation of dipole moments prominently increase with the increasing value of EQE, these three physical quantities are shown to be good descriptors for assessing the D/A quality contributing to the solar cell performance. It should be stressed that the variation in the dipole moments addressed herein is between donors and acceptors and not between donors or between acceptors themselves.
In this study, we only considered the minimal three-unit donor/one-molecule acceptor systems. In the actual BHJ organic solar cells, a number of inherent complexities have to be taken into account, e.g., the relative dielectric constants, morphology, crystallinity, charge mobility, and the intermolecular stacking of the constituent materials. Therefore, to gain a deeper insight into the real exciton dissociation process, a large-scale molecular simulation mimicking the actual BHJ organic solar cells will be needed in the future.

 	Fig. 1  Chemical structures of (a) PTB7, (b) PTB1, (c) PTBF2, and (d) PC71BM.	 

 	Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of the PTB7/PC71BM (black) and PTB1/PC71BM (red) blend films. The polymer: PC71BM weight ratio is 1:1.5.	 

 	Fig. 3  TA spectra for the (a) PTB7 neat, (b) PTB1 neat, (c) PTB7/PC71BM blend, and (d) PTB1/PC71BM blend films, measured at delay times of 1 ps (black lines), 10 ps (green lines), 100 ps (blue lines), and 1000 ps (red lines) after excitation. The excitation wavelength was 680 nm and the intensity was 5 μJ cm−2 (polymer neat films), 1.25 μJ cm−2 (PTB7/PC71BM), and 2.5 μJ cm−2 (PTB1/PC71BM). TA spectra of the polymer neat films were measured at 294 K and those of the polymer/PC71BM blend films were measured at 77 K.	 

 	Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of the (a) PTB7 and (b) PTB1 hole polarons. These spectra were obtained by subtracting the absorption spectrum of the polymer neat film before doping from that after doping with iodine.	 

 	Fig. 5  Time evolution of PTB1 hole polarons at 1100 nm in the PTB1/PC71BM blend film.	 

 	Fig. 6  Time evolution of polymer hole polarons at 1100 nm in (a) PTB7/PC71BM and (b) PTB1/PC71BM blend films measured at 77 K (black lines) and 294 K (red lines). The excitation intensity was 0.8–1.25 μJ cm−2.
