    , Accepted 1st October 2018First published on 3rd October 2018AbstractWe have designed and synthesized two fused-ring small molecular acceptors IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT, comprising 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (PDOT) and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) bridging units, respectively. The only structural difference between these two acceptors is one methylene group at the π-bridging unit. However, such a tiny structural difference exerts a great influence on the optical, electrical and photovoltaic properties of the acceptors. The molar absorption coefficient of IDT-EDOT is more than four times higher than that of IDT-PDOT. The electron mobility of the IDT-EDOT based blend film is one order of magnitude higher than that of the IDT-PDOT based one. Consequently, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.32% for IDT-EDOT based devices was obtained, whereas a PCE of only 2.18% was achieved for IDT-PDOT based ones. Our results have demonstrated that changing the π-bridging unit in fused ring acceptors is an effective strategy to adjust their photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received much attention over the last two decades in virtue of advantages such as flexibility, transparency, low cost, and light weight.1–6 Since 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) was firstly reported as a competitive counterpart to fullerenes in 2015,7 fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure have been rapidly developed because of their significant contribution to increasing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs.8–13 FREAs have advantages in extension of light absorption and modulation of energy levels compared with fullerene acceptors. Therefore, high short-circuit current density (Jsc) and large open-circuit voltage (Voc) can be achieved. In addition, through controlling the molecular geometry of FREAs, the charge transport ability can be improved and balanced charge transport can be realized, resulting in increased Jsc and fill factor (FF) in OSC devices.14,15 As a result, the three key parameters for determining the PCEs of OSCs can all be improved by means of molecular structural design and device optimization. In the past few years, lots of efforts have been made to design and construct acceptors with a ladder-type fused ring donor unit and two flanking acceptor units,16–32 and such acceptors have shown great potential in improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.
In designing photovoltaic materials, a π-bridging unit is often introduced between the D and A units. Such a π-bridging unit can adjust the intramolecular charge-transfer properties, energy levels and molecular packing styles.33–37 The importance of π-bridging units is gradually being recognized in FREAs. π-Bridging units such as thiophene, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene, benzene and benzoxadiazole derivatives have been utilized in designing FREA molecules.15,38–40 The π-bridging unit can be used to extend the conjugation of the central ladder-type core via “conformation locking” between them. The introduction of flexible side chain(s) can adjust the solubility of acceptors to achieve appropriate nanoscale phase separation when blended with polymer donors.41 Therefore, the introduction of an appropriate π-bridging unit could markedly enhance the power conversion efficiency of OSCs. For instance, DC-IDT2T with a thiophene bridging unit has been previously reported to demonstrate a PCE of 3.93%.42 When replacing the thiophene bridging unit with a 2-ethylhexylthiophene bridging unit, the resulting acceptor IEIC showed an improved solubility, better morphology for the blend film and higher PCE of 6.31% for devices. Although introducing flexible side chains could promote solubility, the steric hindrance of side chains may cause a larger dihedral angle between the central ladder-type core and π-bridging unit or between the π-bridging unit and the flanking acceptor unit, which could impede the effective π–π stacking for acceptors, leading to poorer charge transport properties.43 Unfortunately, almost all the reported π-bridge modifications in FREAs are based on the utilization of long-chain (>5 carbon atoms) alkyl, alkoxy, or alkylaryl groups.
Recently, we proposed a concept of supramolecular acceptors by introducing a π-bridging unit that bears alkoxy chain(s), and the intramolecular O⋯S and O⋯H interactions can be used to lock the planar conformation of the molecular backbone in the solid state.15 Thus, the dilemma between planarity and solubility for FREAs can be solved. However, flexible long chains are still employed in those small molecular acceptors. In this work, to avoid the above-mentioned shortcomings, we thus designed and synthesized two small molecular acceptors (IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT) by replacing π-bridging units carrying flexible side chains with cyclic ones. 4,4,9,9-Tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile were used as the central donor core (D unit) and terminal group (A unit), respectively. 3,4-Alkylenedioxythiophene, which has the potential to form intramolecular interactions with D and A units, was used as the π-bridging unit. We found that by altering just one carbon atom in such a π-bridging unit, the light-absorption, π-stacking, and photovoltaic properties of FREAs can change significantly. When using poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo(1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′)dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) as an electron donor, OSCs based on IDT-EDOT (π-bridging unit: 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) as the electron acceptor can exhibit a PCE of 11.32%, while the PCE of those based on IDT-PDOT (π-bridging unit: 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) is only 2.18%. The large difference in PCE values of these two electron acceptors mainly comes from the Jsc and FF of their photovoltaic devices. Our results demonstrate that modification of π-bridging units in FREAs with cyclic substituents is a very effective way to adjust their photovoltaic performance.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route of IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT is shown in Scheme 1. 3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) is commercially available. 3,4-Propylenedioxythiophene (PDOT) was prepared in a yield of 73% by the reaction of 3,4-dimethoxythiophene and 1,3-propanediol with p-toluene sulfonic acid monohydrate (PTSA) as the catalyst. Subsequently, treatment of PDOT and EDOT with 1.2 equivalent of n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) afforded the corresponding mono-lithium intermediates, which were quenched with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to furnish the required aldehydes PDOT-CHO and EDOT-CHO in yields of 72% and 83%, respectively. Bromination of PDOT-CHO and EDOT-CHO with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the dark gave the key intermediates Br-PDOT-CHO and Br-EDOT-CHO in almost quantitative yields. Stille cross-coupling of bis(trimethylstannyl) substituted IDT with Br-PDOT-CHO and Br-EDOT-CHO afforded the corresponding dialdehydes IDT(PDOT-CHO)2 and IDT(EDOT-CHO)2 in yields of 69% and 71%, respectively. Knoevenagel condensation of the two dialdehydes and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile afforded the target molecules IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT in yields of 29% and 70%, respectively. The chemical structures of the target molecules were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The thermal properties of these two molecules were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. As shown in Fig. S1,† the temperatures for 5% weight loss of IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT were determined to be 376 and 382 °C, respectively, indicating that they have good thermal stability.

Photophysical properties and frontier energy levels
The optical properties of these two molecules were investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy. The absorption spectra of IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT in dilute chloroform solutions and as thin films are shown in Fig. 1a and b. The two compounds exhibit a similar absorption profile in chloroform solutions with the maximum peak located at 747 and 753 nm for IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT, respectively. However, their molar absorption coefficients differ greatly, showing 4.86 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for IDT-PDOT and 1.95 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for IDT-EDOT (Fig. 1a and Table 1). It means that the π-bridging unit could significantly affect the light absorption ability of acceptors. Similarly, the influence of molecular weight on the molar absorption coefficient of polymers has been reported by Cai et al.44 However, it is still not clear at present time why the molar absorption coefficient of IDT-EDOT is several times higher than that of IDT-PDOT as their molecular weight difference is only 28. In going from solutions to films, the absorption bands of the two acceptors became broader with the absorption edge up to almost 900 nm (Fig. 1b). The absorption maximum also red-shifted from 747 and 753 nm to 776 and 789 nm for IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT, respectively (Table 1). The larger red-shift means that the molecules should have stronger interaction in films (vide infra).45 According to the equation of Egopt = 1240/λonset, the optical band gaps (Egopt) of IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT were calculated to be 1.43 and 1.41 eV, respectively (Table 1). Additionally, frontier molecular orbitals calculated by DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level also suggested that energy band differences between IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT are in good agreement with experimental results (Fig. S2†).

The packing of acceptors in films was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. As shown in Fig. 2, IDT-PDOT exhibited two diffraction peaks located at an angle of 2θ = 5.56° and 2θ = 24.49° corresponding to a lamellar distance of 15.91 Å and a π–π stacking distance of 3.64 Å, respectively. The diffraction peaks for IDT-EDOT were 2θ = 5.01° and 2θ = 25.81° corresponding a lamellar distance of 17.64 Å and a π–π stacking distance of 3.45 Å. The smaller π–π stacking distance for IDT-EDOT relative to IDT-PDOT indicates that the π–π interaction of IDT-EDOT is stronger than that of IDT-PDOT in neat and blend films. The formation of more ordered packing for IDT-EDOT in blend films is beneficial to achieving high electron mobility.

The electrochemical properties of these two acceptors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the CV curves are shown in Fig. S3.† Both of these two molecules exhibited irreversible cyclic voltammograms in their first scans. IDT-EDOT showed a new reversible oxidation/reduction couple in its second scan, indicating that a new species is formed after the first scan. As for IDT-PDOT, the second scan also displayed new oxidation/reduction couples in the CV curve at a low oxidation potential, indicating the formation of a new species. In the second scan, the reductive peak became much weaker, indicating that these two molecules are not very stable during CV measurement. The oxidation and reduction potentials were determined to be 1.11/−0.51 V for IDT-PDOT and 1.15/−0.48 V for IDT-EDOT. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated with the equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −eEonset,ox/red − (4.80 − EFc) eV to be −5.39/−3.77 eV for IDT-PDOT and −5.43/−3.80 eV for IDT-EDOT.17 The data are also summarized in Table 1. The molecular energy levels of other materials used for fabricating photovoltaic devices besides the two acceptors are also shown in Fig. 1c. It is worth noting that the modification of the π-bridging unit has little influence on their energy levels.
The spatial conformation of IDT-EDOT and IDT-PDOT is optimized based on DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The central ladder type core (IDT) and the two spacer units (PDOT or EDOT) in the acceptor can be considered as a plane with dihedral angles smaller than 1.5° due to the conformational locking via S–O interaction.17 The dihedral angle between the spacer and acceptor unit in IDT-EDOT is about 3°, indicating that IDT-EDOT more or less takes on a planar conformation. However, the dihedral angle in IDT-PDOT is increased to about 7°, suggesting that IDT-PDOT has poorer planarity (Fig. 3). Planar conformation could enhance the π–π interaction and reduce vibrational reorganization energy,46,47 which in turn is beneficial to improve charge mobility. Their conformation difference may cause a difference in their charge transport properties. In addition, we have simulated the absorption spectra of these two acceptors based on DFT at the PBE0/6-311G* level. The results showed that the molar absorption coefficient of IDT-EDOT is only slightly larger than that of IDT-PDOT (Fig. S6†). The theoretical simulation results cannot fully address the huge difference in the molar absorption coefficients for these two acceptors. More intensive collaborations with theoretical chemists and experts in spectroscopy are ongoing to understand what caused the big difference in molar absorption coefficients for the two acceptors.

Photovoltaic properties
Devices with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/MoO3 (85 Å)/Ag (100 nm) were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT. The ITO glass substrates were treated with UV ozone for 20 minutes. Then, the ZnO film was deposited from its precursor solution prepared according to the literature.48 The active layers of PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT or PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT were deposited from their o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solutions. Finally, the MoO3 layer and the Ag electrode were deposited successively by vacuum thermal evaporation. Experimental conditions including the weight ratio of donor to acceptor and the concentration of additive were optimized, and the details are shown in the ESI.† As shown in the current density–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. 4a), IDT-PDOT based devices demonstrate a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 5.26 mA cm−2, an FF of 48.9% and thus a PCE of 2.18%. However, for IDT-EDOT based devices, largely improved photovoltaic performance was obtained with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 20.70 mA cm−2, and an FF of 57.5%, leading to a high PCE value of 10.29%. To make a comparison, IDT-EDOT's analogue IEICO-4F, with an alkoxy substituent at the π-bridging unit, was selected as a reference. Devices based on IEICO-4F show a PCE of 8.29% with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 20.83 mA cm−2 and an FF of 51.5%, which is similar to the reported PCE value in the literature (8.66%).41 This result indicates that our modification strategy by using cyclic spacer units is better than the commonly used flexible-chain modification. After the addition of 0.2% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the processing additive, the maximum PCE of IDT-EDOT based devices is further improved to 11.32% with the Jsc and FF increased to 21.34 mA cm−2 and 62.0%, respectively (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 4b, although the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the two acceptors spread over a similar spectral region (370–850 nm), the maximum EQE is only 21% for IDT-PDOT and reaches 67% for IDT-EDOT. And the addition of DIO brought about a slight promotion in the maximum EQE of IDT-EDOT based devices. Jsc calculated from EQE data according to the integration of the spectrum fits well with that obtained from the J–V chart (within 5% error). It can be seen that the improvement in the photovoltaic performance of IDT-EDOT relative to IDT-PDOT is mainly attributed to the increase in Jsc and FF. These two parameters are all correlated with the charge mobility in the active layer.

Charge mobilities
In addition, the charge-transport ability of the donor:acceptor blend film was characterized by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. 5). The result suggests that IDT-PDOT has a low electron mobility (3.0 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), nearly 1/22 of IDT-EDOT's electron mobility (6.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), also IEICO-4F's electron mobility (1.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, Fig. S4†) is lower than IDT-EDOT's, whereas the hole mobility difference is much smaller (1.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDT-PDOT and 8.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 for IDT-EDOT). Since light absorption and carrier mobility are two key factors that determine the short circuit current, the lower Jsc value of IDT-PDOT relative to IDT-EDOT can be explained by its small molar absorption coefficient and low charge mobilities. Moreover, the lower FF of IDT-PDOT may be caused by the worse balance of holes versus electron mobility (μh/μe for IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT is 6 and 1.3, respectively).

J
sc and Voc with respect to light intensity were evaluated to gain more information about charge recombination and the results are shown in Fig. S7.† Generally, Jsc shows a power-law dependence on light intensity, which can be expressed as Jsc ∝ (Plight)α.49 The α value is 0.836 and 0.978 for IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT, respectively, indicating that bimolecular charge recombination under short circuit conditions is much easier in IDT-PDOT based devices. To understand the degree of trap-assisted recombination, Voc was measured under different light intensities. Voc depends linearly on the logarithmic plot of light intensity with a slope of nkT/q, in which k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin and q is the elementary charge.49 The slope is 1.33kT/q and 1.27kT/q for IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT, suggesting that interfacial surface trap density in IDT-EDOT is lower.
Morphology characterization
The film morphology characterization was carried out to further understand the large difference in the PCEs of IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT based OSCs by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6). The IDT-EDOT based active layer has a slightly larger root-mean-square roughness value (1.55 nm) than IDT-PDOT (0.95 nm) (Fig. 6a and c), which can be ascribed to more polymer nanofibrils existing in the IDT-EDOT based active layer as demonstrated in the TEM images. Apparently, the coarse fibrils contributed by the polymer donor are seldom found in the IDT-PDOT based active layer, indicating that it is difficult to achieve appropriate phase separation for efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation. In contrast, in the case of IDT-EDOT, the coiled fibrils formed by PBDB-T can be clearly observed, which increases the donor/acceptor contact interface and provides effective charge transport pathways, thus being beneficial to exciton dissociation and charge transport.

Conclusion
In summary, two FREAs (IDT-EDOT and IDT-PDOT) comprising two cyclic spacer units have been designed and synthesized for the first time. The influence of the ring size of the spacer unit on the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties was investigated in detail. It is found that the molecular energy levels, light-absorption spectral profiles and electrochemical properties of these two FREAs are quite close due to their highly similar structures. However, the molar absorption coefficient, π–π stacking distance, charge-transport ability, film morphology and photovoltaic properties of these two FREAs can be significantly different, despite the fact that there is only one methylene group difference for the spacer unit. IDT-EDOT which has a smaller steric hindrance at the π-bridging unit shows a much better photovoltaic performance than IDT-PDOT which bears a larger steric hindrance and IEICO-4F which possesses a flexible long chain at the π-bridging unit. The dramatically increased PCE of IDT-EDOT relative to IDT-PDOT is attributed to its stronger light-harvesting capability and higher charge mobility, which are caused by its planar conformation and close π–π stacking. We have demonstrated that the photovoltaic performance of FREAs could be largely improved by using an appropriate cyclic spacer unit, thus providing a new way for improving the PCE of non-fullerene OSCs.
