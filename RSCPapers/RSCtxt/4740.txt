J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 1990, 5, 179R-214RAtomic Spectrometry Update—Atomisation and Excitation(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )David Littlejohn, Raymond Jowitt, Ian L. Shuttler, Simon T. Sparkes, Julian F. Tyson and Stephen J. WaltonAbstractThis review describes developments in all aspects of atomisation and excitation related to atomic spectroscopy reported in the Atomic spectrometry Updates Referencesin JAAS, Volume 4 (89/C1659–89/3239) and Volume 5 (90/C1–90/C2277). Thus it follows the review published last year (J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 1989, 4, 151R). The full references, names and addresses of authors can be readily found from the Atomic Spectrometry Updates references in the relevant issues of JAAS. However, as an additional service to readers an abbreviated form of each literature reference quoted (except for those to Conference Proceedings) is given at the end of the review. Comments as to possible improvements in future reviews are always welcome.
