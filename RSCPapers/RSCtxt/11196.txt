, Accepted 21st February 2014First published on 26th February 2014AbstractWe herein present a useful and novel strategy to redesign photoanodes by building smart TiO2 nanorod networks in and on a film of P25 nanoparticles (NPs) to optimize the comprehensive performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). By using a doctor-blade method followed by a facile hydrothermal treatment, an interesting hierarchical double-layered film consisting of P25 NPs and TiO2 nanorods (NRs) was fabricated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. In our strategy, P25 NPs (underlayer) with a large surface area can potentially enable a large amount of dye absorption while TiO2 NRs (overlayer) as the scattering part would effectively strengthen the light harvesting ability. Moreover, TiO2 NRs inserted into the P25 NP film also provide conducting networks for fast photogenerated electron transport. As demonstrated in photoanodes for DSSCs, this hierarchical double-layered photoanode indeed exhibits superior DSSC performance to that of a pure P25 NP film; the photovoltaic conversion efficiency increases up to 8.62% under illumination of one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), which is significantly better than 6.12% for the pure P25 NP photoanode. This work highlights the significance of the rational design of photoanode electrodes for enhanced energy conversion applications.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have promoted intense research during the past two decades due to their low cost, simple fabrication process and relative high conversion efficiency.1–3 A typical DSSC involves a liquid electrolyte containing I−/I3−, a Pt counter electrode, and most significantly, a dye-adsorbed porous metal oxide electrode.4–7 The efficiency of DSSCs is tightly associated with the oxide electrode and governed by the following three aspects: (i) light harvesting efficiency, (ii) electrons injection efficiency and (iii) electrons collection efficiency.8–10 A general concept of the promotion of above efficiencies is trying to develop advanced electrode materials with high specific surface area, fast electrons transfer capability and outstanding light-scattering properties.11–18 Though mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) enable large surface area for dye loading, the great recombination loss during the photo-excited electrons collection in TiO2 NPs severely limits the electrons diffusion coefficient and thus future commercial popularization of DSSCs.19–23
Fabrication of film electrodes from one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures which are capable of providing a direct electron-transport pathway has proven to be an effective way to facilitate electrons transfer.24–26 In a film of anatase TiO2 NPs, the electron diffusion coefficient has been demonstrated to be two orders of magnitude lower than that in single-crystal TiO2 nanowire/nanorod.27,28 It is anticipated that 1D nanostructures as the photoanode electrodes could potentially facilitate electrons transport and effectively decrease the interfacial recombination, further improving the conversion efficiency.17,29,30 Till now, however, the conversion efficiency of nanowire/nanorod-based DSSCs still stays at a relatively low level mainly due to the insufficient surface area for dye absorption. The state-of-art photoanodes should combine the advantages of NPs for rich dye absorption and the merits of 1D nanostructures for rapid electrons transfer, which can be hardly realized without a smart hybrid electrode design.
In an effort to maximize the efficiency of DSSCs, we herein design a novel hierarchical double-layered photoelectrode by integrating TiO2 nanorods (NRs) in and on the film of P25 NPs using a facile hydrothermal treatment. In this hybrid electrode design, P25 NPs with large surface area ensure the adequate dye absorption while the incorporated TiO2 NRs can serve as not only a light-scattering scattering layer for light harvest but also electron-transport pathways that prevent the recombination of photo-electrons. The DSSC based on this hierarchical hybrid photoanode shows better performances than that of pure P25 NPs film photoanode-based DSSC. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency rises up to 8.6%, significantly higher than the value of 6.1% for the pristine P25 NPs photoanode.
Experiment
Preparation of P25 NPs film
P25 NPs film photoanode was fabricated according to the procedures mentioned in previous literatures,31,32 as illustrated in Scheme 1a–c. In detail, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass sheets (15 Ω cm−2) were cleaned by ultrasonication treatment in ethanol for 15 min and then immersed into an aqueous solution of 0.04 M TiCl4 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China) at 70 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the glass sheets were fetched out and kept at 60 °C for 20 min followed by annealed at 500 °C in air atmosphere for 1 h. For the preparation of the viscous paste, two kinds of pure ethyl cellulose (EC) powders, i.e., EC1 (45–55 mPa s) and EC2 (6–9 mPa s; 5% in toluene–isopropanol 80:20, Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd.) were dissolved prior to the use of ethanol to yield 10 wt% solution. Next, 0.25 g of P25 powder (Degussa AG, Germany) was mixed with 8.0 mL of ethanol (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China) and 0.2 mL of acetic acid (99.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China) to form a sol. After 10 min of ultrasonic treatment toward the sol, 0.45 g of EC1 (45–55), 0.35 g of EC2 (6–9) of these 10 wt% ethanolic mixtures and 0.3 mL of tetra-n-butyl titanate (TBT) (Tianjin fuchen Chemical Co., Ltd, China) were added to form the homogeneous paste under vigorously stirring. The obtained paste was then spread on the pre-treated FTO glasses via a doctor-blade method. The thickness of P25 NPs film can be tuned by using adhesive tapes (Scotch, 50 μm) as the spacers. After dried, the P25 NPs film was successively heated at 160 °C for 20 min, at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 10 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 20 min in a muffle furnace (KSL 1700X) under the air atmosphere.

Preparation of smart TiO2 nanorod networks in and on the surface of the P25 NPs film
The hierarchical double-layered photoanode was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The volume ratio of used agents (H2O–HCl–TBT) was set as 30:30:a (a = 0.4, 0.8, 1.2). Samples generated in different TBT concentration solutions were conducted by similar procedures mentioned above. In a typical synthetic procedure, 30 mL of hydrochloric acid (HCl) (37%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China) and 30 mL of deionized (DI) water were mixed to obtain a transparent solution. TBT was then progressively added into the mixed solution drop by drop under vigorous agitation. After 10 min, the mixed solution was transferred into the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and subsequently the P25 NPs film was also immersed into the autoclave (P25 NPs film facing down). The autoclave was sealed, put into an electric oven and maintained at 150 °C for 6 h. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally, the samples were fetched out, rinsed with DI water several times and dried in air at 30 °C.
Characterizations
The crystallinity of P25 NPs and the hierarchical double-layered film on FTO substrate were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance, Cu Kα radiation; λ = 0.1542 nm). The surface and cross-section morphologies of all film samples were observed on a the field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL-6700F; 10 kV). Their light scattering properties were examined by UV-vis spectrophotometer (Model Lambda 35). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured by an electrochemical work station (CHI 760D, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai) under the illumination of one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) at the open circuit voltage of the cells with a frequency range from 0.1 to 100 kHz. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas (SBET) measurements were estimated using BELSORP-mini (BEL Japan Inc.) with N2 as the adsorbate at liquid nitrogen condition.
Fabrication and measurement of DSSCs
All the prepared film photoanodes were soaked in a 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C followed by a sintering process at 500 °C in air for 30 min. After cooled down to 80 °C, the films were immersed into a 0.05 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye at room temperature for 24 h. A FTO substrate sputter-coated by Pt layer with a thickness of 60 nm was used as the counter electrode. The dye-sensitized photoanode together with the Pt-coated FTO glass were assembled into a sandwich-type cell. A liquid electrolyte (about 10 μL) containing 0.1 M of LiI, 0.05 M of I2, 0.5 M of 4-tertbutylpyr-idine and 0.6 M of tetrabutylammonium iodide in acetonitrile was then injected into the interspace between the dye-sensitized film electrode and the counter electrode. The edges of cells were carefully sealed by a hot-melt polymer film (Surlyn, 1702; film thickness: 60 μm). The photovoltaic measurements were performed in air by a solar simulator (Oriel, 91192) under illumination of one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). For the resultant cell, the exposed area in light was approximately 0.2 cm2. To estimate the dye adsorbed amount on photoanodes, the sensitized electrodes were separately immersed into a 1 mM of NaOH solution. Then, the absorbance of the resulting solutions was measured by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2450).
Result and discussion
P25 NPs films and the hierarchical films prepared in different solutions (a = 0.4, 1T-P25; 0.8, 2T-P25; 1.2, 3T-P25) on FTO substrates were initially examined by XRD measurement. Fig. 1 shows that except for diffraction peaks arising from FTO glasses (marked by square), the peaks detected from P25 NPs film can be indexed to distinct anatase (JCPDS no. 21-1272) and rutile (JCPDS no. 21-1276) TiO2, respectively. For comparison, in the case of hierarchical films, there are new diffraction peaks appearing, which are also indexed to rutile-phased TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1276; highlighted by dotted circle) and demonstrating the later successful building of TiO2 NRs into/onto P25 NPs film via hydrothermal treatment. SEM observations on the surface and the cross-sectional morphology of P25 NPs film (see Fig. 2) and the hierarchical film (see Fig. 3) have been made. Fig. 2a displays a low-magnification SEM image of P25 NPs film, which reveals that the film is uniform with few cracks. The cross-section SEM image in Fig. 2b indicates that the thickness of P25 NPs film is about 13.5 μm. Fig. 3a–c successively show typical SEM images of the hierarchical film obtained from different reaction solutions (the added TBT volume is 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 mL). With a low concentration of TBT (about 0.4 mL), it is clear that very few TiO2 NRs appear on either the outer surface or the inner side of P25 NPs film (Fig. 3a). Upon the addition of TBT up to 0.8 mL, there are large quantities of nanorods in a diameter range of 70–90 nm grown on the top surface of P25 film (Fig. 3b). When the introduced TBT rises to 1.2 mL, both the amount and the size of resultant nanorod products increased (up to 100–120 nm), as obviously displayed in Fig. 3c. Above results indicate that the concentration of TBT is highly associated with the hydrothermal growth of TiO2 NRs. Fig. 3d–f display the cross-section and top-view images of the hierarchical film fabricated with a moderate TBT dosage of ∼0.8 mL. Top-view SEM image of the produced hierarchical film (Fig. 3e) reveals the large-scale and uniform formation of TiO2 NRs on P25 film surface after the hydrothermal process. Low-magnification image also illustrates that the thickness of 2T-P25 film is ∼14 μm, similar to the case of P25 NPs film (13.5 μm) in the absence of hydrothermal treatment (see Fig. S1a†). An enlarged cross-section SEM observation captured from the black rectangular part of Fig. S1a† has also been made. As indicated by blue circles in Fig. S1b,† it is clear that TiO2 NRs can be easily distinguished from P25 NPs indicating that smart 1D TiO2 NRs were able to grow inside P25 NPs film. The existing TiO2 NRs network in P25 NPs film would potentially provide direct electrons transport way and consequently reduce the recombination rate of electrons. The SEM image from the root of the hierarchical films (Fig. 3d), reveals that the TiO2/P25 film has a good contact with the FTO film after hydrothermal treatment. Fig. 3f shows the magnified cross-section SEM observations toward the hierarchical film. It is found that the well-distinguished NRs structures with average length of around 1 μm are uniformly grown on the top of P25 NPs, illustrating that TiO2 NRs are distributed not only in the NPs film but also on the outer surface of P25 NPs film.

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were made to compare the scattering effect of all film samples. Diffuse reflectance spectra of P25 NPs film (Cell 1) and the hierarchical films (a = 0.4, Cell 2; a = 0.8, Cell 3; a = 1.2, Cell 4) were shown in Fig. 4. Compared to pure P25 NPs film, all the hierarchical films possessed a strong scatting effect in the wavelength region of 400–800 nm. This indicates that the incorporated TiO2 NRs in/upon P25 NPs film indeed have a better light-scattering capability than the case of pure P25 NPs film. Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent-photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs fabricated by P25 NPs and the hierarchical film with the similar thickness of ∼13.5 μm, respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters and the dye absorption results were summered in Table 1. The cell made from P25 NPs film (Cell 1) exhibits an open voltage (Voc) of 0.666 V, a short circuit density (Jsc) of 16.20 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 56.5% and conversion efficiency (η) of ∼6.12%. It is interesting to note that after the hydrothermal treatment, the Jsc varies significantly from 16.20 mA cm−2 (for Cell 1) to 17.09 mA cm−2 (for Cell 2), 18.66 mA cm−2 (for Cell 3), 12.28 mA cm−2 (for Cell 4), respectively. The highly improved Jsc in Cell 2 and Cell 3 can be mainly attributed to two reasons: (i) the improved dye adsorption by the introduced TiO2 NRs, and (ii) the enhanced light harvesting efficiency due to the strong light scattering effect of TiO2 NRs layer (Scheme 2a), which plays a vital role for high-efficiency energy conversion.11,12,33,34 As shown in Scheme 2a, it revealed that the present of TiO2 NRs in/upon P25 NPs film will play a vital roles for increasing the light scattering. The Cell 2 and Cell 3 obviously have a better light-scattering capability than that of Cell 1 within the same wavelength range (400–800 nm) (Fig. 4), revealing the improvement of light scattering abilities for such a kind of hierarchical films. However, the Jsc value of Cell 4 dramatically drops to 12.28 mA cm−2 (lowest). We suppose that the decrease of Jsc value could be mainly ascribed to its poor dye loading, mainly ascribed to its poor dye loading resulting in low charge generation. Once there are excessive TiO2 NRs inserted, the pores in P25 NPs film were blocked or filled by NRs, subsequently hindering the dye absorption. The poor dye loading capacity for Cell 4 can be attributed to the low surface areas of the film, as verified by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (SBET) measurements. The SBET of the Cell 4 is 7.79 m2 g−1, which is obviously lower than that of other cells (Cell 1:45.08 m2 g−1; Cell 2: 76.58 m2 g−1; Cell 3: 79.14 m2 g−1). After comparing the Voc value of these four type cells, it can be found that DSSCs based on the hierarchical films have a similar Voc value (Cell 2: 0.678 mV; Cell 3: 0.689 mV; Cell 4: 0.678 mV), which is a bit higher than that of P25 film (Cell 1: 0.666 mV). As we known, the Voc value of DSSCs is determined by the difference between the Fermi level for electrons in the photoanode and the redox potential of I−/I3−.21,35,36 As shown in Scheme 2b, due to the direct transport ways provided by smart TiO2 NRs network inside the films of P25 NPs, the electrons transport rate is significantly increased, and hence the charge recombination is also reduced to some extent. This also leads to the enhancement of electrons density on the TiO2 NRs/P25 surface, thus giving rise to the increase of Voc and a positive shift of Fermi level. The fill factors (FFs) are measured to be 56.5% (Cell 1), 63.4% (Cell 2), 67.1% (Cell 3) and 66.1% (Cell 4), respectively. The record reflects that the FF value firstly increases with amount of incorporated TiO2 NRs in/onto P25 NPs film but finally suffers from a slight drop. This result could be highly related to TiO2 NRs which lower the series resistance and provide better contact between the electrolyte and titania.26 As demonstrated, the power conversion efficiencies of our composite structured solar cells were 7.35% for Cell 2, 8.62% for Cell 3 and 5.51% for Cell 4, respectively.

 Scheme 2  Sketch showing light scattering in the TiO2/P25 composite film (a) and the electron transport through the semiconductor oxide film (b). 
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) technique is a powerful characterization technology to understand the electrochemical/photoelectrochemical processes in DSSCs. EIS spectra of the four cells was performed under the illumination of one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) at the open circuit voltage of the cells. Fig. 6a and b show the Nyquist plots and the Bode curves of DSSCs assembled with P25 NPs and the hierarchical film specimens, respectively. There are two arcs observed in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 6a). The first semicircle in the high-frequency region (>1 kHz) is assigned to the redox charge transfer at the counter electrode whereas the second one occurring in the medium-frequency range (1000–1 Hz) represents the electrons transfer at the oxide/electrolyte interface.37–39 Under the Voc condition, there is no current passing through the external circuit, implying the electrons injected into P25 or TiO2/P25 were recombined with electrolyte at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.10,40,41 As can be seen, after TiO2 NRs were introduced into P25 NPs film, the charge recombination resistance of electrodes (Cell 2: 164.1 Ω; Cell 3: 289.8 Ω; Cell 4: 138.2 Ω) was higher than that of pure P25 NPs film (Cell 1: 59.2 Ω). Moreover, the Cell 3 film exhibited the largest resistance value, reflecting its capability of effectively preventing the electrons from recombination on the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. This can attributed to the fact that appropriate incorporation of smart TiO2 NRs, thus leading to the lowest recombination rate of electrons. The Bode-phase plots (Fig. 6b) show a corresponding characteristic frequency peak. Based on the characteristic frequencies at the mid-frequency peaks value (fmax), the electron lifetime (τe) for these four DSSCs can be calculated according to the following equation.  
 Fig. 6  (a) Nyquist plot and (b) Bolt plot from electrochemical impedance spectra of four-type cells. 
As observed in Fig. 6b, the fmax values are 11.85, 11.25, and 56.25 Hz for Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 4, respectively. The Cells 3 has the lowest fmax value (3.23 Hz). According to the above equation, we can readily conclude that the Cell 3 has the longest τe. This means that electrons can transfer a longer distance to a larger extent with unblocked ways across the TiO2-P25/dye/electrolyte interface, leading to more effective capture and collection of electrons and also confirming the function of smart TiO2 NRs network.
Conclusion
In summary, a novel hierarchical double-layered photoelectrode was synthesized for enhanced performance of DSSCs. The double-layered photoelectrode consists of TiO2 NRs grown either in the film or on a top surface as the scattering layers and a bottom layer of P25 NPs providing the large surface area for dye absorption. Moreover, we have also demonstrated that TiO2 NRs inserted into the P25 NPs film can effectively function as a direct electron transport network, eventually reducing the recombination of electrons. The hierarchical double-layered electrode demonstrated a high conversion efficiency of 8.6% which was much higher than that of pure P25 NPs film (6.12%). The remarkable enhancement of the photovoltaic performance is mainly attributed to the superior light scattering ability, the faster electron transport and better dye absorption ability.
