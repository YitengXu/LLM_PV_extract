    , Accepted 9th January 2022First published on 10th January 2022AbstractBiVO4 is a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical water splitting applications due to its narrow band gap, i.e., ∼2.4 eV, suitable band-edge positions, non-toxicity, and high stability. Here, we report the synthesis of Mn2+-doped BiVO4 with varying concentrations of Mn2+ (0.2–1.0%) to improve the charge-transport properties of the catalyst. The addition of Mn enables forbidden d–d transitions, which are utilized to slow down the charge-carrier recombination and increase the efficiency. The highest efficiency was achieved in the case of the 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4 photoanode, which exhibits a photocurrent density of 1.163 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and 1.56 mA cm−2 at 1.4 V vs. RHE. The enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of Mn2+–BiVO4 implies a higher charge-carrier separation and an improved electrical conductivity. This suggests that Mn2+-doped BiVO4 may be used as a promising photoanode in future energy-conversion devices.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical water splitting (PEC) is an effective alternative to existing energy-conversion techniques due to its simplicity and direct conversion of sunlight into chemical energy. In photoelectrochemical water splitting, water oxidation is the rate-determining step due to its multiple electron requirements. Among widely researched topics in sustainable energy and the environment, the enhancement of the efficiency of the overall water splitting process has been vigorously pursued.1–3 Research has focused on the availability of suitable semiconductors that have a low-cost, high stability, a narrow band gap, and a high quantum efficiency.4 Monoclinic BiVO4 has emerged as a promising photoanode material due to its non-toxicity, suitable band gap, i.e., 2.4–2.5 eV, its stability in aqueous medium, resistance to corrosion, and favorable band edge positions for water redox reactions.5,6 Kudo and co-workers reported the photocatalytic properties of BiVO4 in 1999.7 The monoclinic scheelite form of BiVO4 is the best photocatalyst amongst all the three existing forms of BiVO4 (tetragonal scheelite, tetragonal zircon, and monoclinic scheelite). This is attributed to the transition from the valence band (i.e., formed by the Bi 6s and O 2p orbitals) to the conduction band that is formed mainly by V 3d orbitals.8 There are, however, some other factors that contribute to its limited application for solar water splitting, such as its low electron mobility, average charge-carrier separation efficiency, and a high kinetic barrier for the transfer of charge carriers across the aqueous interface.9,10 Different strategies have been adopted to overcome these limitations, such as the substitution of certain ions,11 the design of heterostructures,12 optimization of the morphology,13 crystal-facet control,14 the deposition of co-catalysts,15etc. There have been some reports where BiVO4 has been combined with appropriate materials to form composites, such as BiVO4/Fe2O3,16 BiVO4/MOOH (M = Ni, Fe),17 FTO/BiVO4/Ag2S,18 the NiFeV/B–BiVO4 photoanode,19 the WO3/BiVO4 core–shell heterostructure,20 Co–Pi/BiVO4,21etc., to enhance the photoelectrochemical performance. Appropriate substitution in a semiconductor produces additional catalytic sites, alters the band structure,22 improves the electronic properties, and may create an internal electric field that is conducive for the separation of charge carriers adjacent to the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, thus promoting the separation of charge carriers.23 Metal-doping studies, such as W-doped BiVO4,24 W/Mo-doped BiVO4,25 yttrium-doped BiVO4,8 and Mo-doped BiVO4,26 have been reported. Multiple ions, like (Y, W) or (Yb, W) in BiVO4,27 Zr-doped BiVO4,28etc., have been substituted. Manganese-based oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) have gained a lot of interest in recent times due to their earth-abundance and environmentally friendly behavior.29 The advantage of Mn doping is that it introduces a 4T1–6A1 state into the host nanocrystal, which is associated with Mn d–d transitions. Since this transition is both orbital- and spin-forbidden, it results in a longer lifetime of excited electrons.30 It has been demonstrated that Mn ions act as electron-storage centers in the Mn-doped CdSe/Br–PGR composite, and the charge-carrier processes using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopic studies have been discussed.31 The effects of ultra-thin MnOx co-catalysts, synthesized using the atomic layer deposition technique, on the photoelectrochemical properties of BiVO4 have previously been discussed.26
Here, we have modified BiVO4 photoanodes with very minimal weight loadings of Mn2+ (0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, and 1.0%) and performed photoelectrochemical water splitting studies in a neutral medium, i.e., 0.5 M Na2SO4 to study the effect of these small Mn2+ weight loadings on BiVO4. The modification of BiVO4 with lower-valent Mn2+ significantly improved the charge-carrier separation. The highest photocurrent density was observed in the case of 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4, which showed a very encouraging photoelectrochemical performance compared with pure BiVO4 and all the other Mn2+–BiVO4 samples.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), ammonium metavanadate, (NH4VO3), and manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate (C4H6MnO4·4H2O) were purchased from CDH chemicals. Nafion (5 wt%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the chemicals were used as such without further modification.
2.2 Preparation of Mn2+–BiVO4
For the preparation of BiVO4, 4 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in 50 mL ethylene glycol and stirred till complete dissolution (solution A). Variable amounts of Mn acetate were dissolved in 10 mL double-distilled water (solution B). Solution B was then added dropwise to solution A. The color of solution A changed from transparent to a brown color. 4 mmol of NH4VO3 was dissolved in 50 mL double-distilled water using magnetic stirring till dissolution (solution C). Solution C was then added dropwise to the above solution (A + B) with constant stirring for about 4 h. A yellow precipitate was obtained while mixing the two solutions. 60 mL of the above mixture was then transferred to a 100 mL Teflon autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 36 h. Then, the yellow-colored precipitate was washed several times with water and ethanol. The as-synthesized product was then dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C.
2.3 Preparation of photoanodes
Preparation of the BiVO4 photoanodes was carried out using 1 × 1.5 cm2 pieces of indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (15–20 Ω cm). The substrates were cleaned via ultrasonication using a mixture of water and ethanol. The contacts between ITO and copper wire were made using silver paste. The connection was preserved using epoxy adhesive (Araldite) to avoid contact with the electrolyte. 4 mg of sample was dispersed in a mixture of 190 μL ethanol, 90 μL double distilled water, and 20 μL Nafion and sonicated for 20 minutes to form a uniform dispersion. The dispersion was then drop cast onto the ITO (1 × 1 cm2 area) substrates and dried in air.
2.4 Characterization techniques
The crystal structure and phase of the composites were confirmed via X-ray diffraction using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, within a 2θ range of 10°–60°. The surface morphology and atomic percent of all the samples was examined using a ZEISS EVO Series scanning electron microscope (SEM) EVO 50. High-resolution TEM and elemental mapping were carried out using a JEOL JEM-F200 instrument. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements of solid powdered samples were performed using a UV-2450 Shimadzu Japan spectrophotometer, with pure BaSO4 as the reference. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a Kratos analytical AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer with Mg-Kα radiation. Photoluminescence spectra was recorded using Horiba LabRAM HR evolution spectrometer.

2.4.1 Photoelectrochemical measurements. 
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using an Autolab PGSTAT204 workstation. The source of illumination used here was a Xe arc lamp (300 W) under AM 1.5 G simulated solar irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. All the measurements were performed using 0.5 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. A three-electrode set up with material-coated ITO as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode, and Pt wire as the counter electrode was used. A Teflon cell with a quartz window was used to set up the three-electrode configuration. Linear sweep voltammetry measurements were carried out within the potential range of 0–0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under both dark and illuminated conditions to compare the photoactivity. Chronoamperometric measurements were carried out under continuous light illumination for 420 s with ON/OFF cycles of 30 s. Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out in the dark at a frequency of 1 kHz within a potential range of −1.0 V to 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl). The potential values were converted to RHE using the Nernst equation32 given below. ERHE = ERef + EApp + 0.0591 pH(1)Here, ERHE is the potential value with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode, ERef is the standard potential of reference electrode, i.e., Ag/AgCl, where ERef = 0.21 V, and EApp is the applied potential. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at a potential of 900 mV vs. RHE with an AC voltage within a frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz.

3. Results and discussion
The crystal structure and phase purity of the synthesized samples were investigated using XRD. All the samples exhibit peaks corresponding to the monoclinic phase of BiVO4 with lattice parameters a = 5.195 Å, b = 11.701 Å, c = 5.092 Å and β = 90.38° (JCPDS no. 14-0688) (Fig. 1). The peaks at 18.87°, 28.82°, 30.54° and 47.30° correspond to the (011), (121), (040) and (042) lattice planes of BiVO4, respectively.
 Fig. 1  (a) Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of bare BiVO4 as well as Mn2+-doped BiVO4, and (b) powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the (121) peak showing a shift towards a higher theta value with an increase in Mn2+. 
There is an observable shift towards a higher 2θ value in the diffraction peaks with the increase in Mn content (Fig. 1b). The shift towards a higher 2θ value can be due to the size effects as Mn2+ is smaller in size compared with Bi3+. The ionic radii of ions involved in Mn2+–BiVO4 follow the trend23,33,34Bi3+ (1.03 Å) > Mn2+ (0.67 Å) > V5+ (0.36 Å).
Thus, the replacement of Bi3+ with Mn2+ will cause a shift towards a higher 2θ value (smaller d value) since a larger ion will be replaced by a smaller sized ion, lowering the value of d.
The average crystallite sizes were obtained using the Scherrer equation: (2)where K = 0.89, λ = wavelength of X-rays, β = full width at half maximum (FWHM), θ = diffraction angle. The crystallite sizes were calculated for the (121) diffraction peak using eqn (2) and are given in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that increasing the content of Mn up to 0.6% leads to the formation of BiVO4 with a larger crystallite size (a low value of FWHM), while an increase in the Mn content to 0.8% and 1.0% leads to the formation of BiVO4 with a smaller crystallite size (larger FWHM value).

This change in the crystallite size upon addition of Mn2+ may occur due to the disorder in the position of Mn2+ inside the lattice or by the distortion caused due to the variation in the size of substituent atoms as suggested by Merupo et al. in 2015.35 It was observed from the SEM images (Fig. 2) that the bare BiVO4 particles have a non-uniform leaf-like morphology with an average length of around 2 μm and an average width of around 1 μm. 0.2% Mn2+–BiVO4 shows uniformly distributed ellipsoidal particles, which have an average length of around 2.5 μm and a width around 1 μm as suggested by Fig. 2b. On moving from 0.2% Mn2+–BiVO4 to 0.4% Mn2+–BiVO4, a small increase in both the length and width of the particles was observed from the SEM images, with particles of an average length of around 2.5 μm and a width of around 1.5 μm (Fig. 2c).

An increase in the percentage of Mn2+ in the case of 0.6% Mn2+–BiVO4 shows a flower-like morphology (Fig. 2d) with an average length of around 2.5 μm and a width of around 1.5 μm. Fig. 2e shows the morphology for 0.8% Mn2+–BiVO4, which suggests the rupture of these flower-like particles to give flake-like particles. 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4 shows that the flake-like particles seem to join together to form cube-like particles (Fig. 2f) with an average length of around 2.5 μm and a width of around 1.5 μm. Thus, Mn2+ doping leads to significant changes in the morphology of BiVO4.
For confirmation of the compositions, we selected the intermediate concentration sample, i.e., 0.6% Mn2+–BiVO4. Fig. 3 shows the elemental mapping of 0.6% Mn2+–BiVO4, which suggests the presence of Bi, V, O, and Mn elements in the system. No other element was observed, which suggests the synthesis of pure Mn2+–BiVO4. Mn is uniformly distributed all over the BiVO4 particles. Similarly, EDX data were obtained for all compositions (see Table 2), which shows the atomic percentage of all elements.

SEM-EDX measurements suggest the presence of Bi, V, O and Mn elements in the system. The atomic percentage of Mn present in all the systems was 0.11%, 0.12%, 0.36%, 0.36% and 0.74% for 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% and 1.0% Mn2+-doped BiVO4, respectively.

Fig. 4a shows the transmission electron microscope image of 0.6% Mn2+–BiVO4, which exhibited a flower-like morphology in the SEM images of Fig. 2d. The average length of the particle observed via TEM was around 1 μm and the average width observed was around 700 nm. The small difference in the sizes obtained using SEM and TEM may occur because of sample preparation wherein TEM aggregation is less or is completely removed. Fig. 4b shows the HRTEM image of 0.6% Mn2+–BiVO4, which suggests lattice fringes of 0.31 nm corresponding to the (121) plane of BiVO4.

The optical absorbance plays a major role in deciding the photocatalytic performance of a material. Fig. 5a shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of BiVO4 and Mn2+–BiVO4 (Mn2+ = 0.2–1.0%). Pure BiVO4 shows a sharp absorption edge located around 505 nm. With increasing content of Mn2+ in BiVO4, a red shift in the absorption edge of BiVO4 is observed, which suggests the narrowing of the band gap and thus reflects an enhanced photoabsorption ability of Mn2+–BiVO4 compared with pure BiVO4. Fig. 5b shows the optical band gap determination using the Kubelka–Munk (KM) converted reflectance spectra of solid powdered samples. The optical band gap values (Table 1) were calculated from the absorption spectra using the equation given below: (αhν)1/n = A(hν − Eg).(3)here, Eg is the optical band gap value (eV), A is a constant, h is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10–34 J s), α is the absorption coefficient and ν is the frequency of light used. The value of n depends on the type of semiconductor used, i.e., a direct band gap semiconductor (n = 1/2) or an indirect band gap semiconductor (n = 2). For BiVO4 being a direct band gap semiconductor, the value36 of n is ½. With the increase in the Mn2+ content, we observe a large shift in the band gap from 2.46 eV to 2.36 eV in bare BiVO4 and 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4, respectively. Thus, the larger the amount of Mn2+, the higher is the absorption observed in the visible region.

The oxidation state of the elements and surface elemental composition were determined using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). The survey scan as shown in Fig. 6A depicts the peaks that belong to Bi 5d, Bi 4f, C 1s, Bi 4d, V 2p, O 1s, Mn 2p and O KLL. The XPS individual core level scans are given in Fig. 6B–D, which give the binding energy levels of Bi 4f, V 2p, O 1s and Mn 2p. The XPS data were calibrated using the standard binding energy of C 1s as 284.8 eV.37 The XPS spectra for Bi 4f reveal two intense peaks centered around 158.9 eV and 164.3 eV corresponding to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, which suggests the existence of Bi in the +3 oxidation state for both the pure BiVO4 and Mn–BiVO4 samples, as shown in Fig. 6B.38Fig. 6C shows two peaks with binding energies around 516.6 eV and 524.0 eV, which correspond to the split signal of V 2p; this suggests the +5 oxidation state of V.39 The XPS spectra of pure BiVO4 and Mn2+–BiVO4 do not show any major shifts in the peaks.

This may be due to the lower amount of Mn2+ utilized in the system. Fig. 6C also shows peaks around 529.6 eV and 532.2 eV, which are attributed to the O2− anions in BiVO4.40 The peak at 529.6 eV appears due to the presence of V–O and Bi–O bonds in BiVO4, while the peak at 532.2 eV appears due to the presence of the surface absorbed water.41 The peaks centered around 640.9 eV and 652.3 eV belong to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2, suggesting the existence of Mn2+ in the case of 0.2% Mn2+–BiVO4, 0.6% Mn2+–BiVO4 and 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4 as shown in Fig. 6(b–d), respectively.42 Thus, the XPS studies confirmed the presence of the Mn2+ oxidation state in the doped composite materials.
3.1 Mechanism of charge transfer
The position of the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) in a semiconductor plays a crucial role in deciding the charge-transfer properties of the semiconductor. The positions of the VB and CB for all the samples were calculated using the equations given below:43,44 EVB = X − E0 + 0.5Eg(4) ECB = EVB + Eg(5)here, EVB and ECB correspond to the valence band and conduction band edge positions, respectively, X is the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor (6.04 eV for BiVO445), E0 is the free energy of the electron (i.e., 4.5 eV with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode) and Eg is the band gap of the semiconductor. Table 3 shows the comparison of the VB and CB values calculated using eqn (4) and (5). Pure BiVO4 has the VB edge centered around 2.77 eV and the CB edge centered around 0.31 V. Although the amount of difference produced with the involvement of Mn2+ is quite minor it produces a significant effect on the charge-transfer properties of BiVO4. Scheme 1 shows the schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism of electron and hole transfer in the Mn2+–BiVO4 system based on the CB and VB positions of BiVO4 calculated and the reported values for the Mn2+ dopant positions. The oxidation state of Mn2+ was confirmed using XPS analysis, which can be related to the 4T1 to 6A1 transitions in Mn2+.46–48 The illumination of samples would lead to the separation of charge carriers in BiVO4. Since the 4T1 state of Mn2+ is located below the CB of BiVO4,46 it suggests favorable photogenerated electron transfer from BiVO4 to the 4T1 state of Mn2+ from where the electron will be transferred to ITO and thus will move to the extended circuit. Mehmood's group49 have reported the CuInSe2/Mn–CdS QDs, where they suggested that the photogenerated electrons stay for a longer time in Mn the d-states and thus help in reducing the recombination of electron–hole pairs in the system. Liu et al. have discussed the enhanced photoelectrochemical properties of the Mn–CdS QD/TiO2/WO3 system, where the Mn doping resulted in electronic states in the mid-region of CdS, which leads to the efficient migration of photoexcited electrons, thus lowering the charge-carrier recombination.50 Luo et al. have reported CuInS2–Mn-doped CdS quantum dots for solar cell applications, where the midgap states created by Mn doping lead to the trapping of electrons and thus screen the recombination of photoexcited electrons with holes.51

 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the proposed band diagram of Mn2+–BiVO4. 
The higher improvement in photocurrent can be further explained using photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) (Fig. S1, ESI†). The PL spectra depict two types of emission, i.e., from the host material, i.e., BiVO4, and from the dopant, i.e., Mn.2 Pradhan et al.52,53 suggested that there are two types of emission observed in doped systems: (a) that involve both host and dopant induced emission; and (b) that involve dopant d–d states. The emissions that involve dopant d–d states are independent of the band gap of the host materials, e.g., Mn2+, where the recombination takes place via d–d transitions. Excitation leads to the transfer of energy from the host to the d-states of Mn, which convert the 6A1 (ground state) of Mn2+ to an excited multiplet state. Thus, the transition from the 4T1 state of Mn2+ to the ground state leads to emission. Hence, this type of transition is both spin-forbidden as well as orbital-forbidden. Thus, the photogenerated electrons will spend a longer time in the Mn d-states and then move to the extended circuit. This in turn leads to a delay in the electron–hole recombination and thus a higher photocurrent. The PL spectra shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) depict two bands centered around 560 nm54 and 660 nm,55 which correspond to the PL emission of BiVO4 and the Mn2+ dopant, respectively. It has been observed from the PL spectra that the increase in the Mn2+ dopant concentration from 0.2% to 1.0% leads to a quenching in emission, which clearly suggests the lowered recombination of charge carriers in 1% Mn2+–BiVO4.
Thus, it has been widely investigated that the 4T1 state of Mn2+ helps in the transfer of electrons in the systems and thus lowers the recombination of charge carriers. Meanwhile, the holes present in BiVO4 (Scheme 1) will participate in PEC water oxidation reactions. Thus, in our case, Mn2+ doping leads to an effective separation of electrons and holes in BiVO4, which in turn is responsible for the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of Mn2+–BiVO4.
3.2 Photoelectrochemical studies of bare BiVO4 and Mn2+–BiVO4
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of various photoelectrodes was examined using the linear sweep voltammetry technique in the potential range of 0.6–1.4 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Fig. 7 shows the linear sweep voltammetry curves for all the BiVO4 photoanodes, and a magnified image of Fig. 7 has been provided in Fig. S2 (ESI†) to provide a better comparison of the current density data. Table S1 (ESI†) shows the current densities obtained from the linear sweep voltammetry curves at 1.23 V and 1.4 V vs. RHE. Bare BiVO4 photoanodes exhibit an ultralow current density of 0.0004 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is due to the inadequate charge separation and lower charge mobility in the case of BiVO4, as reported earlier.32 When illuminated with light the current density increases linearly with the potential to 0.0056 mA cm−2, which suggests the separation of charge carriers in BiVO4. Similarly, at 1.4 V vs. RHE, BiVO4 produces a current density of 0.0005 mA cm−2 and 0.0076 mA cm−2 under dark and illuminated conditions, respectively. Table S2 (ESI†) shows the photocurrent density values obtained from (Jlight − Jdark) at 1.23 V and 1.4 V vs. RHE, where Jlight and Jdark are the current densities under light and dark conditions, respectively.

The photocurrent density of BiVO4 increases with the increase in anodic potential, which represents the typical behavior of an n-type semiconductor.56 Similarly, the photocurrent densities obtained for BiVO4 were 0.0052 mA cm−2 and 0.0071 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and 1.4 V vs. RHE, respectively. The lower current value is due to the lower hole mobility and the higher recombination rate of the charge carriers, which is significantly reduced with Mn2+ doping in the system. Ultimately, the lower value of the photocurrent density suggests a lower activity of BiVO4 for the water oxidation reaction. Doping BiVO4 with 0.2% Mn2+ increases the photocurrent density slightly by increasing the charge separation. The photocurrent densities obtained for 0.2% Mn2+–BiVO4 were 0.0063 mA cm−2 and 0.0105 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and 1.4 V vs. RHE, respectively. This is an enhancement of nearly 1.2 and 1.4 times compared with pure BiVO4 at 1.23 V and 1.4 V, respectively. Further increasing the content of Mn2+ motivates the transfer of electrons in the system as explained in Scheme 1, which leads to an enhancement in the photocurrent density of the BiVO4 photoanodes doped with a higher Mn2+ concentration. The 0.4% Mn2+–BiVO4 sample shows a photocurrent density of 0.0566 mA cm−2 and 0.0875 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and 1.4 V vs. RHE, respectively, which is nearly 10 times and 12 times higher than BiVO4 at the corresponding potentials. A further increase in the amount of Mn2+ will promote higher absorption and thus induce a higher photocurrent in the system. The photocurrent density values obtained at the 1.4 V vs. RHE potential for 0.6% and 0.8% Mn2+-loaded BiVO4 were nearly similar. In the case of 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4, the anodic photocurrent density increased abruptly to 1.1632 mA cm−2 and 1.5601 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and 1.4 V vs. RHE, respectively. This photocurrent density is nearly 1.1580 mA cm−2 and 1.5530 mA cm−2 higher than the bare BiVO4 photoanode. This may be due to the enhanced absorption and higher charge-separation, which improves the water oxidation by photogenerated holes in the case of n-type BiVO4.57 The enhanced photocurrent with an increase in the Mn2+ dopant concentration may be attributed to the lower band gap or the improved light absorption in Mn2+-doped BiVO4. The Mn2+-doped samples exhibit a redshift in the absorption spectra, and the increase in Mn2+ concentration leads to a systematic decrease in the band gap from 2.46 eV to 2.36 eV, as observed from the UV-Visible spectra. The decreased band gap suggests a lower amount of energy required for the transition of an electron from the valence band to the conduction band of the semiconductor and supports the higher photocurrent density observed in the doped samples. Such behavior has also been observed for other semiconductor materials such as Se-doped Bi2O3, Mo-doped WO3 and in Y3+, Yb3+ with W co-doping in BiVO4, etc.27 In addition to the charge separation, the improved photocurrent can also be related to the number of active sites. Ede and Luo58 discussed that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be tuned by increasing the number of active sites by doping with earth-abundant metal ions. Fang and co-workers59 reported that the catalytic activity of nickel phosphide and cobalt phosphide for water oxidation can be tailored via Mn doping. The enhancement in the number of exposed active sites leads to an increase in the electrochemical surface area of nickel and cobalt phosphide with Mn doping. Chen et al.60 demonstrated using XAS and DFT that Mn doping in RuO2 is an effective method to promote the intrinsic activity of RuO2 and its water splitting performance. The doping of Mn in RuO2 alters the d-band center and also the number of active sites on RuO2.
Kang et al. in 2019 reported the photoelectrochemical properties of Ag-doped CuBi2O4 photocathodes, where the replacement of Bi3+ with the lower-valent Ag+ ion enhanced the concentration of holes and significantly enhanced the photocurrents.61 Thus, doping with a lower-valent ion may produce an increase in the concentration of holes in the system. In our case, we doped Bi3+ with a smaller valent Mn2+ ion, which could also increase in the hole concentration. The mechanism of charge transfer in Mn2+–BiVO4 has been illustrated in Scheme 1, which describes the role of the Mn2+ dopant in lowering the charge-carrier recombination and thus in achieving a higher photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance. Hence, the maximum photocurrent density obtained in 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4 could result from a higher absorption, a lowered band gap, higher charge-separation and better electronic conductivity compared with the bare BiVO4 photoanodes. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the linear sweep voltammetry curves for 1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0% Mn2+-doped BiVO4, which suggest a decreasing trend in the photocurrent density with an increase in the concentration of Mn2+ above 1%. This may be attributed to the formation of defect sites produced by the higher Mn2+ dopant concentrations in BiVO4, which act as recombination sites as suggested in earlier reports.36 Jun and Jo's and group discussed that 0.5% phosphate doping in BiVO4 shows the best photocurrent density, while 1% and 5% phosphate doping results in an enhanced charge-transfer resistance due to the defect sites introduced by the presence of excessive dopant leading to the higher recombination of electron–hole pairs.62 Huang et al. discussed the photoelectrochemical performance of Mo:BiVO4 where 1% Mo outperformed 3% and 5% Mo:BiVO4, and this has been attributed to the introduction of radiative and non-radiative recombination caused by the incorporation of excessive cations in the BiVO4 lattice.63
To summarize, the doping of Mn2+ in BiVO4 improves the efficiency of the photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance, and the highest photocurrent density was observed in the case of 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4. Table 4 shows a comparison of the various reports on different loadings of the dopant and the photocurrent densities. Compared with earlier reports where high photocurrent densities were achieved at higher doping, we have achieved a significantly high photocurrent density at a much lower Mn2+ doping.

Fig. 7b shows the chronoamperometric ON/OFF response of all the samples at a constant potential of 1.3 V vs. RHE, which suggests the good photostability and reproducibility of the photocurrent density, which is reduced when the light is switched off. The photoresponse obtained via chronoamperometric measurements was similar to the photoresponse obtained from the LSV measurements executed at 1.3 V vs. RHE. It is quite interesting to note that in the case of BiVO4 we observe an almost linear increase in the photocurrent when the light is switched on, while in the Mn2+–BiVO4 cases the photocurrent goes on increasing till the light is switched off.63,64 The enhanced photocurrents with the integration of Mn2+ suggest the improvement in water oxidation kinetics and the maximum photocurrent was obtained in the case of 1% Mn2+–BiVO4.

Fig. 7c shows the Nyquist plots for all the samples obtained at 0.9 V vs. RHE to compare the interfacial charge-transfer processes in all the samples under dark (shown by solid lines) and illuminated conditions (shown by solid lines with triangular symbols). The variation in the arcs of these semicircles suggests the difference in charge-transfer resistance, i.e., RCT, of all these samples at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. The largest semicircle diameter was obtained in the case of BiVO4 under dark conditions, which suggests a slow charge transfer and faster recombination of electron–hole pairs in BiVO4. The diameter of the plots of all other samples where Mn2+ is present is smaller in comparison with pure BiVO4, which suggests a lower charge-transfer resistance in Mn2+–BiVO4. 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4 possesses the smallest semicircle, indicating the lowest charge-transfer resistance. Thus, with the increase in Mn2+ content, an effective charge-separation or a lower charge-carrier recombination rate was achieved.
Furthermore, to gain insight into the efficiency of these electrodes, we calculated the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) as shown in Fig. 7d for all the photoelectrodes. The ABPE was calculated from the LSV plot (i.e., the J–V curves) using the equation given below:13  Here, J refers to the photocurrent density obtained when the potential Vapp is applied. The value of the photocurrent density is obtained from [J (mA cm−2) (light) − J(mA cm−2) (dark)], which is the difference in the values of current density obtained in the presence and absence of light. 1.23 V corresponds to the standard reversible potential for water oxidation and Plight (mW cm−2) corresponds to the power density of the source (i.e., 100 mW cm−2). Table S3 (ESI†) shows the calculated values of ABPE for all the samples. The BiVO4 photoanode shows a minimal amount for the ABPE, i.e., 0.0008%, which is very small compared with the Mn2+–BiVO4 photoanodes. The difference in the current density obtained under dark and illuminated conditions for the 0.2% Mn2+–BiVO4 photoanode at 1.0 V vs. RHE was not significant; thus, it was not included in Table S3 (ESI†).
All the Mn2+–BiVO4-based photoanodes show a gradual increase in ABPE values with an increase in the content of Mn2+. The 0.6% Mn2+–BiVO4 and the 0.8% Mn2+–BiVO4 photoanode both show an ABPE efficiency of nearly 0.007%. While on moving further to 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4, the value of ABPE is 0.1435%, which is a nearly 20-fold enhancement compared with the 0.6% Mn2+–BiVO4 and 0.8% Mn2+–BiVO4 photoanodes. Thus, the 1% Mn2+–BiVO4 photoanode with the higher value of ABPE shows the highest photoconversion efficiency.
Mott–Schottky analysis was performed to gain insight into the charge-carrier density, flat-band potential values and the type of conductivity in the BiVO4 and Mn2+–BiVO4 photoanodes. The flat-band potential is the potential at which the band bending in a semiconductor completely vanishes. For the Mott–Schottky plots (shown in Fig. 8), the values for the flat-band potential and the charge-carrier density values were calculated using the equations given below:13    where e0 is the electron charge, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the dielectric constant, Nd is the dopant density, V is the applied electrode potential, kT/e0 corresponds to the temperature-dependent correction term and VFB is the flat-band potential of the semiconductor.

The value of flat-band potential was obtained by extrapolation of the x-intercepts in the Mott–Schottky plots. Table 5 tabulates the comparison of the flat-band potential and the donor density calculated from the Mott–Schottky plots. All the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 8) show a positive slope, which indicates n-type semiconductor behavior in each case. This also suggests that variation of the Mn2+ doping level does not alter the n-type behavior of BiVO4. The slope for undoped-BiVO4 is much steeper in comparison with Mn2+-doped BiVO4, which suggests a drastic enhancement of the charge carriers in the doped BiVO4 photoanodes.70 Thus, there is a positive shift in the value of the flat-band potential till 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4 compared with the pure BiVO4 photoanode, which suggests an increase in the band edge bending that results in higher charge separation, and which is in accordance with the literature reports.63,71 This type of alteration in the Fermi level would further facilitate the separation of charge carriers and thus lower the recombination of charge-carriers in the Mn2+–BiVO4 photoanodes. The values of donor density, i.e., Nd, calculated from the Mott–Schottky plots are in a similar range as reported for BiVO4. The values of Nd obtained from the above equation were 3.16 × 1018, 3.18 × 1018, 5.56 × 1018, 6.90 × 1018, 1.47 × 1019 and 1.72 × 1019 cm−3 for BiVO4, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% and 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4, respectively. The calculated values of Nd were in the same range as that previously reported for BiVO4.72 The increase in the values of the donor densities suggests an improvement in the electrical conductivity and a reduction in the charge-transfer resistance of the semiconductor.67 The highest donor density value was obtained for 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4, which suggests that the larger number of charge carriers leads to a higher photocurrent density compared with the other samples. The donor density obtained for 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4 is nearly 5 times that obtained for pure BiVO4. Thus, the incorporation of Mn2+ significantly enhances the conductivity of the BiVO4 photoanodes and reduces the recombination rate of charge carriers to a significant extent. Hence, from all the photoelectrochemical studies, we observed a significant difference in the charge-transfer properties or the photoelectrochemical properties of BiVO4 photoanodes with the incorporation of Mn2+.

4. Conclusions
We have utilized earth-abundant Mn2+ ions as a dopant in BiVO4 using a solvothermal process to improve the charge carrier-separation and to enhance the hole mobility in BiVO4. The synthesis of BiVO4 was done using a simple solvothermal method. The photoelectrochemical linear sweep voltammetry measurements of 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4 show maximum anodic photocurrent density values of 1.1632 mA cm−2 and 1.5601 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and 1.4 V vs. RHE, respectively. The chronoamperometric ON/OFF response of all the samples suggests good photostability and an enhanced photoresponse of the bare and Mn2+-doped BiVO4 photoanodes. The charge-transfer resistance (using EIS) shows that the Mn2+-doped samples have a lower charge-transfer resistance compared with the bare BiVO4 photoanode, and the maximum value of the donor density (Nd) was ∼5 times that of bare BiVO4, which was observed for the 1.0% Mn2+–BiVO4 photoanode. Thus, Mn2+ doping in BiVO4 is an effective way to enhance the performance of photoanodes.
