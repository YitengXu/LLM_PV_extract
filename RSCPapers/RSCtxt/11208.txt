    , Accepted 18th March 2019First published on 18th March 2019AbstractAs the next generation of electrochemical energy storage devices, lithium sulfur (Li–S) batteries have many advantages such as high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g−1) and energy density (2600 kw h kg−1), non-toxicity and low cost. However, the poor electrical conductivity of sulfur cathodes and the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides during cycling strongly hinder the commercial application of Li–S batteries. In this study, Magnéli phase Ti4O7 nanoparticles were successfully prepared on the surface of hollow carbon spheres (HCS) through a carbothermal reduction reaction. The synthesized HCS@Ti4O7 with a mesoporous structure exhibited a uniform spherical morphology with a large specific surface area (512 m2 g−1) and the pore volume of 0.58 cm3 g−1. The introduction of a polydopamine (PDA) layer during the preparation was confirmed to effectively inhibit the grain coarsening of Ti4O7. Moreover, the high content of sulfur loading (70%) did not affect the morphology of HCS@Ti4O7, which suggested its stable architecture. The assembled coin cells exhibited the superior reversible capacity of 1427 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and favorable cycling stability from 1168 mAh g−1 to 601 mAh g−1 after 800 cycles at 0.5C with the capacity decay rate of only 0.06% per cycle. This excellent performance and stability were attributed to the strong chemical binding effects of Ti4O7 on lithium polysulfides and the stable morphology maintenance during cycling. This study provides a novel conception to design and synthesize nanocomposites between reduced metal oxides and carbon with uniform and stable mesoporous structures for high-performance Li–S batteries.
1. Introduction
With the increasingly severe energy crisis, it is highly necessary to develop novel energy conversion and storage devices. Significant attention has been attracted by the harvest and conversion of different types of energy such as solar,1 wind,2 geothermal and tidal energies.3 Most of the abovementioned energy sources are intermittent in nature; this means the converted energy must be used immediately.4 Obviously, this is unusable for some mobile power units including cell phones and electric vehicles. In these cases, the development of energy storage technology is quite essential to meet the abovementioned requirements. Rechargeable lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, which have attracted significant attention recently, are considered to be one of the most promising candidates for next-generation electrical energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density (2600 kw h kg−1), low cost,5–7 abundant reserves and environmentally friendly nature.8 However, the poor conductivity of sulfur, shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8), large volumetric expansion and formation of Li dendrites during cycling seriously hinder the development and large-scale production of Li–S batteries.9–13
To overcome the aforementioned problems, a large number of research studies have been carried out concerning the development and optimization of Li anodes, electrolytes, solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers and sulfur host cathodes. For example, the irreversible Li dendritic growth during plating/stripping of Li has been confirmed to decrease the coulombic efficiency and degrade the cycling performance of batteries. In this case, the development of novel Li anode structures, such as three-dimensional cross-linked polyethylenimine lithium-ion-affinity sponges,13 lithium metal with a 2D MoS2 protection layer14 and polyethylene oxide film-coated copper electrodes,15 have been proved to be effective methods to hinder the growth of Li dendrites during plating and stripping of Li. Meanwhile, the generated SEI layer in traditional Li batteries cannot accommodate the large volume changes of the Li anode during cycling because of its poor mechanical properties. Under these conditions, the development or optimization of SEI layers has also attracted great interest in recent years; examples include organosulfide-plasticized SEI layers,16 organosulfide and inorganic Li salt hybrid SEI layers17 and smart Li polyacrylic acid (LiPAA) SEI layers.18 These reported SEI layers all possess excellent flexibility and mechanical strength to accommodate the volumetric changes during the charge/discharge process.
Another research direction in Li–S batteries is the development of novel cathode materials, which has become one of the key points to improve the performance of Li–S batteries. Ideal cathodes (normally sulfur hosts) require excellent conductivity, relatively high specific surface areas, special structures to accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur and strong binding effects with polysulfides.19 Based on the above principles, the currently reported sulfur host materials fall mainly in the following 3 categories: (1) Conductive polymers such as polypyrrole20 and polyaniline21 with excellent electrical conductivity and functional groups. (2) Carbon-based materials with large specific surface areas and exceptional pore structures, including mesoporous carbon,22 hollow porous carbon spheres,23 carbon nanotubes24 and graphene.25 (3) Polar metal oxides, such as Ti4O7,26 TiO,27 Fe3O4,28 TiO2 (ref. 29) and MnO2.30 Additionally, TiN,31 WS2,32 Mxene,33 and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)34 have also been reported as sulfur host materials. Among all the abovementioned candidates, carbon-based materials are widely utilized due to their excellent electrical conductivity, large specific surface areas and designable porous structures. However, the non-polar nature of carbon can only provide weak physical adsorption on lithium polysulfides,35 resulting in outward diffusion of the polysulfides from the carbon pores during long-term cycling, which degrades the performance of batteries. Compared with carbon-based materials, some polar metal oxides have strong chemical trapping capacity against polysulfides;36 however, due to their poor conductivity and low specific surface areas, they cannot fully exploit the above advantages. Therefore, systems consisting of a combination of two materials are quite popular in recent research works.27,28
TinO2n−1 (3 ≤ n ≤ 10) is a series of sub-stoichiometric titanium oxides which has attracted great attention in recent years due to their low cost, excellent electrical conductivity and non-toxicity.37–39 These special properties are closely related to the special crystal structures and atomic arrangements (normally known as “crystallographic shear planes,” which lead to a high density of oxygen vacancies).40 Since 2014, when Cui's group41 confirmed the strong sulfur binding of TinO2n−1 nanomaterials from both experimental and DFT calculations, there have been many reports on the application of TinO2n−1 in Li–S batteries.41–43 Morphology and phase control are the two key factors during the synthesis of TinO2n−1 because high temperature calcination is an indispensable link in the whole process. Compared with other TinO2n−1 phases, Ti4O7 has high electrical conductivity (up to 1051 S cm−1 (ref. 44)) and a relatively stable structure. Also, it has been reported that the polar O–Ti–O units in Ti4O7 can adsorb polysulfides effectively; this can restrain the dissolution of polysulfides in the electrolyte significantly, leading to excellent cycling performance and favourable rate capability of batteries.42 Because morphology and phase control are quite difficult during the synthesis of Ti4O7, the design and exploration of the morphologies and preparation processes of these nanocrystals with large specific surface areas is particularly important.
Recently, the use of carbon or polymer as reducing agents to perform carbothermal reduction reactions has become one of the most popular methods to synthesize carbon-coated TinO2n−1 materials with different morphologies;26,27 this provided us with numerous ideas to design nanocomposites between carbon and Ti4O7 with hollow structures. Such composite materials can not only offer large spaces to increase the sulfur loading, but can also restrain the volumetric expansion during discharge of the batteries. Meanwhile, the polar TinO2n−1 phases with high electrical conductivity can strongly absorb lithium polysulfides generated during the cycling of batteries, which decreases the shuttle effect significantly. Based on the above principles, nanocomposites between carbon and Ti4O7 with hollow structures can be designed and prepared, although related references are quite limited.
In this work, Ti4O7 nanoparticles with small sizes and a uniform morphology were successfully grown on hollow carbon spheres (HCS) with a core–shell structure. This nanocomposite was also utilized as a sulfur host material for Li–S batteries. The synthetic path of HCS@Ti4O7 and HCS@Ti4O7/S is shown in Scheme 1. Specifically, uniform HCS were prepared as the hard template using a previously reported method.45 Titanium isopropoxide (TIP) was used as the titanium source to grow a TiO2 coating on the surface of HCS.46 The as-prepared HCS@TiO2 was then coated with a thin layer of polydopamine (PDA) for the following CRR process. High temperature calcination under Ar atmosphere promoted the transformation from TiO2 to Ti4O7, whose grain growth was inhibited by the PDA coating. Sulfur loading was finally performed before the coin cell assembly. Detailed synthetic methods can be found in the Experimental section. The morphologies and structures of the precursors at each stage and the as-prepared HCS@Ti4O7 before and after sulfur loading were all characterized in detail. The electrochemical performance of the electrodes was also investigated after coin cell assembly. Pure HCS and HCS@TiO2 were also loaded with sulfur for comparison to carry out the electrochemical characterization.

Formaldehyde (37%), anhydrous ethanol (95%, AR), ammonia aqueous solution (NH3·H2O, 27%, AR) and sulfur powder were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Phenol crystals were purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. Hydrofluoric acid (HF, 32 wt%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36%) were purchased from Tian in Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. Tris was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd.
2.2 Synthesis of HCS@TiO2@PDA precursor
The mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (HCS) were prepared using a previously reported method.46 The preparation of the TiO2 coating was based on the wet-chemical method, which can also be found in previous literature reports.46 Typically, 30 mg HCS were dispersed into 35 ml anhydrous ethanol and ultra-sonicated for 30 min. Then, 0.32 g HDA and 0.8 ml NH3·H2O were added to the suspension and stirred for 15 min. Finally, 0.2 ml TIP was dropped into the solution with intense stirring for 1 h. The product was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with distilled water and anhydrous ethanol. The obtained powders were dispersed in 55 ml Tris-buffer aqueous solution accompanied by stirring. Then, 100 mg PDA was added to the solution, and stirring was continued for 24 h. After centrifugation and washing several times with distilled water and anhydrous ethanol, the product was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h to obtain the HCS@TiO2@PDA precursor.
2.3 Synthesis of the HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposites
The HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposites were prepared through a carbothermal reduction reaction (CRR) in argon atmosphere. Specifically, the as-prepared HCS@TiO2@PDA powder was placed in a corundum crucible with a top and heated gradually in a tube furnace at 950 °C for 15 min with a heating rate of 35 °C min−1 in flowing argon atmosphere. The gas flow rate was set to 500 ml min−1. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposites were obtained.
2.4 Synthesis of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode materials
The HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposites were mixed with sulfur powder (3:7 weight ratio) and ground for 30 min in an agate mortar. Then, the mixture was transferred to a 5 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave filled with pure argon and sealed in a glove box. Finally, the autoclave was heated at 155 °C for 20 h to complete the loading of sulfur.
2.5 Structural characterization methods
The phase composition of the HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposites was analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-3c) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The working voltage and current were set to 40 kV and 15 mA, respectively. The scan range was set from 5° to 80° with a speed of 5° min−1. The morphologies and structures of the precursor and final products were characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU8020) and transmission electron microscope (FETEM, JEM-2800). The EDX elemental mapping was also obtained on the JEM-2800 TEM with dual detectors. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were tested by a surface area and porosity analyzer (ASAP 2020M). An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (AXIS-ULTRA) was employed to investigate the elements and chemical states. The loaded sulfur contents of the nanocomposites were obtained from TG measurements using a Mettler Toledo (TG/DST) thermogravimetric analyzer in the temperature range from 25 °C to 600 °C under a speed of 5 °C min−1 and a nitrogen flow of 200 ml min−1, respectively.
2.6 Electrochemical measurements
The coin cell was first assembled before the electrochemical tests. Typically, 80 wt% of active material (HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposites), 10 wt% of acetylene black and 10 wt% of polyvinylidene fluoride (PDVF) were dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, 99%) and mixed by magnetic stirring until uniform. Then, the slurry was coated on aluminium foil and dried at 50 °C for 24 h in vacuum to obtain the positive electrodes. The CR2032 coin cell was assembled in a glove box under argon atmosphere. A pure lithium disk and Celgard 2400 were used as the anode and diaphragm, respectively. 20 μL electrolyte containing 1 M lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide and 2 wt% LiNO3 in a mixed solvent of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) (volume ratio 1:1) was used in the cell. The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed using a LAND battery tester in the potential range from 1.6 V to 2.8 V at different rates. The CV measurements were carried out on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation in the voltage range from 1.6 V to 3.0 V. The electrochemical impedance measurements were performed at 5 mV AC oscillation amplitude in the frequency range of 5 Hz to 100 kHz.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization of HCS @TiO2@ PDA precursor
The morphology characterization results of HCS, HCS@TiO2 and HCS@TiO2@PDA are summarized in Fig. 1. As can be seen from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 1(a), HCS exhibits a uniform spherical morphology with an average diameter of around 200 nm. The corresponding enlarged second electron image (SEI) in Fig. 1(d) indicates the existence of uniform holes with sizes of around 12 nm at the surface of HCS, which is the source of its large specific surface area. Both the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM, Fig. 1(e)) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. 1(j)) images suggest a hollow structure of HCS with a wall thickness of ∼45 nm. After coating a thin layer of TiO2 through a cooperative assembly-directed strategy46 onto the surface of HCS, no obvious morphology changes were noted after the coating process, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The enlarged SEI image in Fig. 1(f) indicates that most of the external holes at the surface of HCS are fully filled with amorphous TiO2. In addition, the average diameter of the spheres increased to around 235 nm, which further verified that HCS was successfully coated. Compared with the STEM DF and TEM BF images of the as-synthesized HCS, the coated samples show relatively strong contrast, as shown in Fig. 1(g) and (k). The PDA is finally coated on the surface of the HCS@TiO2 spheres, which retain their hollow spherical morphology with very smooth surfaces (Fig. 1(c, h and i)). The average thickness of the spheres increased to around 260 nm, indicating that the thickness of the PDA layer is around 13 nm. This is consistent with the EDX mapping results (Fig. S1†), which can be found in the ESI.†

3.2 Structural characterization of HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposites
The carbothermal reduction reaction (CRR) is employed at 950 °C to promote the transformation from amorphous TiO2 to conductive Ti4O7 under Ar atmosphere. During the process, the external PDA layer will convert to carbon and then act as the reducing agent. Meanwhile, the internal HCS serves as a hollow framework to maintain the morphology of the whole structure. Comprehensive structural characterization was performed to illustrate the detailed structures of the HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposites, as shown in Fig. 2. In the SEM image shown in Fig. 2(a), it can be found that the whole structure has not changed radically, with some small particles distributed randomly on the surface of HCS. The diameters of the spheres are almost decreased to their original level, which suggests that the TiO2 and PDA coatings are almost fully consumed during the CRR. According to the XRD analysis, the peaks appeared in the spectrum are fully consistent with the standard Ti4O7 peaks (JCSPD no. 72-0857), which further verifies the completeness of the reaction, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Some lattice planes are also labelled in the figure. To further investigate the detailed structures of HCS@Ti4O7, TEM BF, SEI and HRTEM images were also taken accordingly. As shown in the TEM BF image in Fig. 2(c), the hollow features were maintained after the calcination, which indicates that the whole skeleton of the material did not undergo great changes. In addition, small particles with sizes of around 15 to 20 nm were found to be distributed randomly on the surfaces of the spheres, as shown in Fig. 2(d) and (e). These particles were confirmed to be Ti4O7 through HRTEM (Fig. 2(f)) and the corresponding FFT images (Fig. 2(g)). Some lattice planes are also marked in the figure. Here, it is worth mentioning that the existence of the PDA layer has an obvious inhibition effect on the grain coarsening of Ti4O7, which was also proved in our previous research.47 The calcination process on the HCS@TiO2 precursor without the coating of the PDA layer was also carried out to illustrate the differences in the morphology evolution. The TEM BF images in Fig. S2† indicate that the size of the TinO2n−1 particles after calcination increased to 50 to 100 nm, which is much larger than the results shown in Fig. 2(e). Furthermore, some of the particles fell off the HCS, which definitely has a negative impact on its electrochemical properties. Therefore, the use of the PDA coating is one of the key factors in controlling the morphology and phase structure of Ti4O7.
 Fig. 2  The SEM (a), XRD (b) and TEM (c) characterization results of HCS@Ti4O7 indicate its retained spherical morphology and hollow features after calcination. The enlarged SEI (d and e) provides the detailed surface morphology of the Ti4O7 particles. The HRTEM image (f) and corresponding FFT (g) further verify the phase structure. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm (h) proved the specific surface area of HCS@Ti4O7 to be 512 m2 g−1. The pore size distribution curve (i) indicates a narrow range of micropores from 0.6 to 1.8 nm and a broad range of mesopores from 4.8 to 12 nm for HCS@Ti4O7. 
The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of the HCS@Ti4O7 composite was also acquired and shown in Fig. 2(h). At very low relative pressure, there is a sharp increase of the adsorption volume, which corresponds to monolayer adsorption. After the inflection point, there is a uniform rise of the adsorption volume with increasing partial pressure, suggesting a typical type II adsorption isotherm. In addition, a distinct hysteresis loop can be observed in the relative pressure range from 0.45 to 0.83, suggesting an H4-type desorption loop, as indicated in Fig. 2(h). In comparison, the situation for pure HCS is quite different. Before the growth of the Ti4O7 particles, there were numerous holes with diameters of 5 to 20 nm at the surface of HCS, as indicated in Fig. S3(a) and (b) in the ESI.† These wedge-shaped pore structures correspond to the H3 hysteresis loop, whose slopes in the relative pressure range from 0.6 to 0.8 with the hysteresis loop remain closer to the adsorption curve, as shown in Fig. S3(c).† The reason for the difference in the isotherms is considered to be the different pore structures and size of the two materials. After the CRR process, Ti4O7 particles filled most of the holes and changed the pore structure accordingly. This can also be verified from the pore distribution curves shown in Fig. 2(i) and S3(d).† There is only one peak in the range from 5.0 nm to 20 nm for the pore structure of HCS, which is consistent with the TEM observations. Meanwhile, HCS@Ti4O7 contains 2 pore distribution ranges at 0.6 to 1.8 nm and 4.8 to 12 nm, respectively, as marked in Fig. 2(i). This is closely related to the uneven filling of Ti4O7 particles in the holes at the surface of HCS. Finally, the specific surface areas and pore volumes of pure HCS and HCS@Ti4O7 were calculated to be 1532 m2 g−1 and 2.69 cm3 g−1 and 512 m2 g−1 and 0.58 cm3 g−1, respectively, using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
3.3 Synthesis and characterization of HCS@Ti4O7/S nanocomposites
The loading of sulfur on HCS@Ti4O7 was carried out through a typical melt-diffusion method.27 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to confirm the loading content of sulfur in nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S4(a) in the ESI,† the TGA curve presents an obvious weight loss in the temperature range of 200 °C to 350 °C, which corresponds to the weight loss of sulfur. The contents of loaded sulfur for HCS@Ti4O7, HCS@TiO2 and HCS were calculated to be 70%, 64% and 60%, respectively. Obviously, the HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposites exhibit the highest sulfur content compared with the other 2 sulfur hosts. Meanwhile, the highest initial weight loss temperature of HCS@Ti4O7 suggests that most of the sulfur enters the interior of the material. Moreover, it was noted that a ∼1% weight loss of HCS@Ti4O7/S still occurs from 350 °C to 600 °C, which can be attributed to the mass loss of the residual PDA.
The reason why the sulfur loading content of HCS@Ti4O7 is higher than that of HCS can be interpreted through the following two aspects. Firstly, most of the loaded sulfur only enters the holes at the surface of the pure HCS, which poorly utilizes the hollow structure. This can be confirmed through the EDX mapping results shown in Fig. S5.† To our current knowledge, sulfur hosts with high sulfur loading normally possess pore sizes of around 1 to 5 nm,48–51 which is much smaller than that of pure HCS (5 to 30 nm). In comparison, the existence of two pore distribution ranges at 0.6 to 1.8 nm and 4.8 to 12 nm of HCS@Ti4O7 may be the first reason for the higher sulfur loading content. Secondly, interactions between Ti4O7 and sulfur occurred after the sulfur loading. This can be confirmed from the XPS spectra of HCS@Ti4O7 before and after the sulfur loading, as indicated in Fig. S4(b–d).† From the S 2p spectrum shown in Fig. S4(b),† two strong peaks are located at 163.6 eV and 164.8 eV, which can be attributed to the characteristic peaks of elemental sulfur.26,32,52 In addition, a small bump can be found at around 168.4 eV, which can be attributed to sulfate.26,52 For the Ti 2p spectrum of HCS@Ti4O7 before sulfur loading, two spin-splitting characteristic peaks of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 located at 459.2 eV and 464.8 eV can be found, respectively, which corresponds to the Ti–O bond. After loading with sulfur, a 0.3 eV energy shift toward the lower energy direction can be seen clearly, as shown in Fig. S4(d),† which indicates a possible chemical interaction between Ti4O7 and sulfur. In addition, a small shoulder appeared at around 457.7 eV, which represents the Ti–S bond.42 The existence of this chemical binding effect on sulfur may be another reason for the higher sulfur loading content among all the 3 hosts.
The EDX mapping experiment was also carried out on the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrodes, as shown in Fig. 3. It is obvious that C, O, Ti and S elements all reveal uniform distribution. From the overlap image in Fig. 3(f), it can be noted that most of the sulfur is located between Ti4O7 and the inner HCS, suggesting the excellent trapping ability of HCS@Ti4O7 on sulfur; this is consistent with the TGA analysis and the XPS results of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrodes.
 Fig. 3  The STEM-DF images (a) and corresponding C (b), O (c), Ti (d), S (e) and overlap (f) element mapping images of the HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposite illustrate the invariant morphology of the electrode materials after sulfur loading. 
3.4 The electrochemical performance of the HCS@Ti4O7 cathode hosts
The electrochemical performance of the HCS@Ti4O7-based cathode hosts is shown in Fig. 4. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) characteristics of Li–S coin-cells using HCS@Ti4O7 as sulfur hosts were determined in the voltage range from 1.6 V to 2.8 V with a scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Two obvious reduction peaks at 2.30 V and 2.06 V correspond to the transformation of S8 to high-order polysulfides (Li2Sx 4 ≤ x ≤ 8) and low-order polysulfides (Li2Sy 2 ≤ y ≤ 4) as well as further transformation to Li2S. In addition, the typical oxidation peak at 2.38 V represents the reversed conversion from Li2S to S8. The great repeatability of the first and third cycle curves indicates the excellent electrochemical reversibility of the cathode reactions. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results of the HCS@Ti4O7/S, HCS@TiO2/S and HCS/S composites are also shown in Fig. 4(b). The semicircle in the high frequency region and the declining line in the low frequency region can be attributed to charge transfer resistance and Warburg impedance, respectively. Notably, the charge transfer resistances of HCS@Ti4O7/S, TiO2@HCS/S and HCS/S were confirmed to be 29 Ω, 124.0 Ω, and 36.5 Ω, respectively. The smallest high frequency semicircle of HCS@Ti4O7/S indicates its best electrical conductivity among the 3 host materials. This is directly related to the excellent conductivity of both Ti4O7 and HCS. In contrast, the highest charge transfer resistance of TiO2@HCS/S can be fully attributed to the poor conductivity of the coated amorphous TiO2. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the cells using the 3 electrodes at 0.1C (1C equals 1675 mA g−1) are shown in Fig. 4(c). The two typical discharge plateaus at 2.3 V and 2.1 V correspond to the formation of long-chain (Li2Sx 4 ≤ x ≤ 8) and low-order (Li2Sy 2 ≤ y ≤ 4, Li2S) lithium polysulfides, which is in agreement with the two reduction peaks in the CV curves. The HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode shows the smallest electrochemical polarization (lowest voltage hysteresis, ΔV) compared with those of the HCS@TiO2/S and HCS/S electrodes, indicating its better electrical conductivity and adsorptivity on lithium polysulfides. In addition, the longest discharge plateau of HCS@Ti4O7/S at 2.1 V results in the highest specific capacity among all the host materials, indicating its favourable redox reaction kinetics and effective utilization of the sulfur. Fig. 4(d) shows the cycling performance of the three composite electrodes at the discharge rate of 0.1C. The discharge capacities at the first cycle for HCS@Ti4O7/S, HCS@TiO2/S and HCS/S are 1421, 1129 and 699 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, respectively. After 100 cycles, the discharge capacities of the HCS@Ti4O7/S, HCS@TiO2/S and HCS/S electrodes decreased to 880, 551 and 410 mAh g−1 with capacity retention ratios of 62%, 49% and 58%, respectively. The poor conductivity of the external amorphous TiO2 shell led to the lowest first cycle capacity of HCS@TiO2/S among the 3 electrodes. In addition, although the conductivity of HCS/S is better than that of HCS@TiO2/S, the non-adsorption of carbon on lithium polysulfides also leads to the fastest decay of the specific capacity. Instead, the much better cycling stability of HCS@Ti4O7/S can be attributed to the synergy of both the volume restraining effects provided by the hollow structures of the HCS cores and the strong adsorption effects on lithium polysulfides provided by the polar Ti4O7 shell.

In order to further investigate the advantages of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode, the rate capability of the batteries was also investigated at various discharge rates from 0.1C to 2C, as shown in Fig. 4(e). The HCS@Ti4O7/S electrodes deliver discharge capacities of 1441, 1203, 1016, 854 and 670 mA g−1 at the rates of 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C and 2C, respectively. After 25 cycles, the discharge capacity of the cell could recover to 1408 mA g−1 when the current density returned to 0.1C, indicating the high stability and excellent rate performance of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode. This is fully attributed to its stable hollow architectures and favourable polysulfide immobilization during cycling. In comparison, HCS@TiO2/S and HCS/S delivered lower capacities under the same discharge rate, which may result from the loss of sulfur at the initial cycling stage. Specifically, the discharge capacities of HCS@TiO2/S are 753, 613, 178, 131 and 71 mA g−1 at current densities of 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C and 2C, respectively. This can be attributed to the poor conductivity and weak polysulfide restriction of the amorphous TiO2 shell. For the HCS/S electrodes, the situation is quite similar, with a significant decrease of capacity at 0.5C. This is closely related to the simple physical adsorption of carbon-based materials on lithium polysulfides. The galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrodes at various current densities are also illustrated in Fig. 4(f). Consistent with the results in Fig. 4(e), obvious discharge plateaus can be observed even under a high current density of 2C in the voltage range of 1.6 V to 2.8 V, which also verifies the excellent rate performance and high stability of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode. The long-term cycling performance of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode was also investigated accordingly, as shown in Fig. 4(g). It was noted that the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1168 mA g−1 and maintains a capacity of 609 mA g−1 at 0.5C for 800 cycles, which possesses the capacity retention of 76% after 800 cycles. This corresponds to a capacity decay rate of only 0.06% per cycle. The coulombic efficiency of the cell remained at almost 100% during the whole cycling process, indicating that the shuttle effect of the cell was suppressed successfully by using the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode. This can be attributed to the physical and chemical binding effects of HCS@Ti4O7 on lithium polysulfides.
3.5 Morphology retention and polysulfide binding effects of HCS@Ti4O7 cathode hosts
To further verify the cycling stability of the HCS@Ti4O7 cathode hosts, the coin cell was disassembled after 800 cycles to investigate the changes in the structures and morphologies of the Li anode, separator and HCS@Ti4O7/S cathode. As can be seen from the optical photographs in Fig. 5(a–c), the Li anode, separator and HCS@Ti4O7/S cathode almost retained their original status after cycling. No visible yellow colour can be observed in any part of the cells, indicating that sulfur loss during cycling was inhibited significantly. In order to determine the microstructure variation of the cathodes, the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode was then removed from the current collector for further TEM characterization. As seen from the results in Fig. 5(d) and (e), the spherical morphology of HCS@Ti4O7/S remains intact, indicating excellent stability of the HCS@Ti4O7/S cathode during the long-term cycling process. In other words, the volume changes of the cathode and the shuttling effect of the cell during cycling were effectively suppressed by the hollow structure and strong dual adsorption effect on lithium polysulfides of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode. The EDX element mapping results of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode after 800 cycles are also shown in Fig. 5(f–i). Compared with the results in Fig. 3, the distribution of each element is still very uniform, which further verifies the stability of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode.
 Fig. 5  Optical images of the Li anode (a), separator (b) and cathode (c) of the Li–S coin cell after 800 cycles. No visible yellow color can be observed, indicating that sulfur loss is negligible during the cycling process. TEM BF (d) and SEI (e) images of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode, suggesting an almost unchanged morphology after 800 cycles. The EDX mappings of C, Ti, O and S (f–i) illustrate the uniform distribution of the four elements, which is similar to their original status. 
In order to illustrate the chemical binding effects of Ti4O7 particles on lithium polysulfides, 5 mg HCS@Ti4O7 electrode material was added to 10 ml Li2S6 solution and maintained in a glove box filled with Ar for 2 hours. The corresponding digital photographs are illustrated in Fig. 6(a–c). As can be seen from Fig. 6(a), the original Li2S6 solution was bright yellow in colour. After HCS@Ti4O7 was added to the solution followed by magnetic stirring, a black suspension appeared in the bottle, as shown in Fig. 6(b). After standing for 2 hours, it was obvious to see that the above supernatant was completely transparent (Fig. 6(c)), indicating that Li2S6 was completely adsorbed by HCS@Ti4O7. This suggests that the prepared HCS@Ti4O7 electrode has a strong binding effect on lithium polysulfides.
 Fig. 6  Digital photographs of (a) Li2S6 solution, (b) the solution after adding HCS@Ti4O7 and (c) after 2 hours. The obvious color change of the solution suggests the strong binding effect of HCS@Ti4O7 on lithium polysulfides. The Ti 2p core level spectra before (d) and after (e) the adsorption clearly show that the binding energy shifts toward the lower energy direction, suggesting the chemical binding effects of Ti4O7 on lithium polysulfides. 
To further prove the chemical binding effects of Ti4O7 on lithium polysulfides, XPS characterization was carried out on the electrode materials before and after the adsorption, as shown in Fig. 6(d) and (e). The Ti 2p spectrum of pure HCS@Ti4O7 shows two typical Ti–O spin splitting peaks located at 459.2 eV (2p3/2) and 464.8 eV (2p1/2), respectively. After the adsorption, an energy shift of 0.2 eV toward the lower energy direction can be observed clearly in Fig. 6(e). This energy shift illustrates that a possible chemical reaction occurs between Ti4O7 and lithium polysulfides. This energy shift has been reported to be the reason for the electron donation from the lithium polysulfides to the metal oxides. The delocalized electrons caused by the metallic bonding in Ti4O7 are the main reason for this small energy shift.42 In addition, a small peak located at 457.7 eV can be fitted from the original data and is attributed to the Ti–S bond.42,43 These XPS results confirm that HCS@Ti4O7 definitely has a strong binding effect on lithium polysulfides.
Conclusions
In conclusion, an HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposite with a uniform morphology and large specific surface area (512 m2 g−1) has been designed and synthesized as a sulfur host for high performance lithium sulfur batteries. By introducing a PDA layer to the surface of HCS@TiO2, the grain growth of Ti4O7 after high temperature calcination was successfully inhibited. The HCS@Ti4O7 nanocomposites were confirmed to have a dual physical and chemical adsorption effect on sulfur and lithium polysulfides, which led to a high sulfur loading content (70%), and superior reversible capacity of 1421 mAh g−1 at the rate of 0.1C. Favourable long-term cycling stability of the HCS@Ti4O7/S electrode was observed from 1168 mA g−1 to 609 mA g−1 after 800 cycles at 0.5C, which suggests 76% capacity retention under these conditions. This excellent performance of the electrode is derived from its stable structure, which showed no significant change after 800 cycles. The XPS measurements further proved that the binding energy of HCS@Ti4O7 shifts toward lower energy direction after sulfur loading and polysulfide adsorption, indicating strong chemical binding effects on sulfur and polysulfides for this electrode. This work provides a promising strategy to design sulfur hosts of Li–S batteries with high specific capacity and cycling stability.
