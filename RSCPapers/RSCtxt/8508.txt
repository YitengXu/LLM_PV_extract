    , Accepted 9th February 2023First published on 10th February 2023AbstractThe intermittent increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is a serious problem that contributes to climate change; the combustion of fossil fuels produces the majority of CO2, and technology is needed to capture it efficiently. Various CO2 capture materials have been developed so far. Membrane separation, in particular, has an advantage over other capture technologies due to its ease of use. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) has been widely used as a membrane material for CO2 capture because of its high gas permeability. However, despite their high CO2 permeance, PDMS membranes are still in their infancy, especially regarding CO2 selectivity due to the weak interaction between CO2 and PDMS. Here we evaluated the CO2 interaction with the PDMS chain at the atomic scale and attempted to improve the CO2 affinity of the PDMS chain using density functional theory (DFT). Specifically, we substituted elements in the Si–O framework with other elements and substituted the methyl groups with other chemical groups, and incorporated metallic elements such as Mg and Ti. All the chemical modifications by main group elements resulted in physisorption, but chemisorption of CO2 was observed in PDMS incorporating metallic elements. Since several modes of CO2 binding were observed in PDMS with incorporated metal elements, the binding enthalpy and binding mode were analyzed. As a result of various chemical modifications, it was found that introducing earth metal elements into PDMS was the most effective way to enhance the interaction between PDMS and CO2.
1. Introduction
Climate change is caused by the presence of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, and mitigation of CO2 emissions has become an urgent issue. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology to reduce CO2 emissions from large point sources such as power plants and industrial facilities fueled by fossil fuels and biomass. Another important role is carbon utilization, which uses catalytic chemistry to produce useful substances such as polymers, chemicals, and fertilizers from the captured CO2, thereby reducing its impact on the natural environment.1
Solid CO2 sorbents, such as zeolites,2–4 carbon nanotubes,5,6 and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively studied. Generally, the sorbent process for CO2 capture is energy-intensive since the release of captured CO2 from sorbents requires energy for heating or vacuuming. However, CO2 capture by membranes is principally advantageous because of their smaller and simpler installations compared to other capture technologies such as chemical adsorption using amines and physical absorption using methanol as the absorbent. However, at this time, membrane performance is insufficient to operate under economically viable conditions. Thus, a lot of efforts have been devoted to developing membrane materials.
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is one of the most often used membrane materials due to its high gas permeability, low-cost, film flexibility, and chemically inertness. However, PDMS membranes are still in their infancy, especially regarding CO2 selectivity over other gases. Recently, PDMS/ZrO2 or /TiO2 composite membranes showed rather a high selectivity since the binding energy of CO2 molecules to the membrane matrix was improved.7,8
Membrane permeability is the most significant feature in gas separation.9–11 This key performance should be governed by the atomic-level interaction of the small molecule with the membrane material. Therefore, their accurate estimation is essential for developing membrane materials for gas separation. For this purpose, density functional theory (DFT) can be used to predict the affinity of CO2 to a given material. DFT calculations have contributed to the design of various materials, including lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen production/storage materials, superconductors, solar cells, and thermoelectric materials.12,13 The electronic structure of the original material has been altered by incorporating or substituting different elements or chemical groups. The effects on the physical and chemical properties such as proton and electronic conductivity and catalytic efficiency have been investigated. Based on the data obtained from the calculations, design guidelines were then developed to improve the materials.14,15
Only a few theoretical studies that have focused on gas separation by PDMS have been conducted to date. Shi et al.16 used molecular mechanics force fields to calculate the relative gas solubility in PDMS for several small molecules, including H2S, CO2, H2O, H2, and CO2, and showed that their results were consistent with quantum first-principles calculations. However, although recent attempts have been made to construct molecular force fields describing covalent bonds by machine learning,17 it is considered difficult to describe the rearrangement of electrons during the formation and breaking of chemical bonds in a molecular force field expressed by a simplified mathematical formula. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt the electronic structure theory to predict the enthalpies of both the physical and chemical binding of small molecules to PDMS.
This study determines which chemical modifications can be made to PDMS to increase the CO2 binding enthalpy using DFT calculations. First, the MC-AFIR (multi-component version of the artificial force induced reaction)18 method is used to search for CO2 binding sites for different PDMS trimer conformations in the PDMS trimer–CO2 complex system, and these structures are optimized using DFT calculations. In addition, chemical modifications are applied to each structure and the CO2 binding enthalpies were calculated: the Si–O backbone, methyl groups, or both were chemically modified. In addition to chemical groups consisting of major elements, alkaline earth metals and 3d transition metals are also used for chemical modifications. Multiple binding modes are identified, and for each binding mode, the magnitude of the binding enthalpy is examined.
2. Computational details
2-1. Model construction for PDMS
Previous molecular dynamics simulation studies of PDMS have shown that the Si–O backbone is very flexible and randomly oriented,19 and its structure does not have the regularity that crystals have. Therefore, we fragmented the PDMS polymers in this study and investigated the interaction between the fragment and CO2.
Zeolites and MOFs are known to trap CO2 in their pores. Similarly, in PDMS, a specific interaction between its closed space and CO2 may occur. Therefore, in constructing the model, we employed a trimer (n = 3) that can form a loosely closed space (ring structure) to account for the interaction with CO2 in such a structure.
The chemical modifications carried out in this study can be divided into three categories. Firstly, the substitution of the atomic sites of the main chain by other main group elements or the substitution of the methyl group by chemical groups consisting of main group elements; secondly, the substitution of silicon by alkaline earth metals; and thirdly, the substitution of silicon by transition metals. The chemical modifications specifically attempted are summarized in Fig. 1, where the silicon in the Si–O main chain is replaced by carbon, the oxygen in the main chain is replaced by sulfur and the –CH3 group in the side chain is replaced by –CH2F, –CN, –OH, –Ph (phenyl group), etc. The –CH2F group was introduced because fluorine is the most electronegative constituent and can change its electronic state significantly. The OH group was introduced because it is more polar than the CH3 group; the CN group was introduced because, unlike the CH3 group, it is a functional group with a strong electron-withdrawing force; the Ph group was introduced because it has more delocalized electrons and is expected to cause a specific interaction between the π-electrons and CO2. The alkaline earth metal Mg was introduced because Mg and CO2 have been reported to interact affinely in the CO2 reduction reaction by Mn complexes.20,21 The 3d transition metal was introduced because CO2 has been reported to adsorb on both surface Ti and oxygen atoms of TiO2.22

2.2. Computational methods
All calculations reported in this study were performed using the Gaussian 09 program package.23 The M06-2X functional24,25 with Grimme's dispersion correction (D3) was used to optimize all structures without symmetry fully.9 Previous studies have shown that M06-2X can describe the conformational energies of silicon-containing complexes26 and CO2 clusters.27 Recent studies on the interaction of CO2 with silica materials have also reported good reproduction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shifts and structure.28,29 We have also previously demonstrated that M06-2X accurately predicts the ionization potential of organic molecules30 and the electronic excitation energy of organic dyes.31,32 These findings support the notion that M06-2X is a versatile function for various chemical properties.
It is well known that a drawback of many density functionals is that their dispersion interactions cannot be described with good accuracy. However, it is known that these interactions can be described to some extent in the formulation of the M06-2X functional because the internal parameters are determined to reproduce the physical properties obtained from experimental data and high-precision methods like the coupled-cluster method.
However, it has been reported that M06-2X captures ‘medium-range‘ (<5 Å) electron correlations but does not account for ‘long-range’ electron correlations, suggesting the need to add an explicit term to describe the long-range dispersion interactions.33 As the PDMS model and CO2 treated in this study includes long-range interactions, M06-2X-D3 with an empirical dispersion term was applied.
The Stuttgart/Dresden (SDD) basis set34 and its associated effective core potential were used for Ti in all geometrical structural optimizations, and the 6-31G* basis sets35 (BS1) were used for the other atoms.
To confirm the minima and transition states (TSs) and obtain the zero-point vibrational energy corrections and entropy contribution, the vibrational frequencies were calculated at the same level of theory. A thermal correction was performed at 298.15 K and 1 atm. The potential energy was calculated at M06-2X/BS2 (BS2 = SDD for Ti, 6-311+G(2d,p) for other atoms).
The initial configuration of the PDMS trimer–CO2 complex was generated using a combination of the MC-AFIR method36 and a semi-empirical method (PM6). This can be done using a combination of GRRM37,38 and the Gaussian programs. The approach was chosen to quickly generate initial structures, avoiding the manual generation of CO2 configurations for the different PDMS conformations one by one, instead of exploring the structure of the PDMS–CO2 complex with high precision (Fig. 2). The generated structures are fully optimized at the M06-2X/6-31G* level.
The transition states between the different CO2 binding modes in the system with Mg incorporated into PDMS were obtained as follows. First, the conventional AFIR method18 was applied together with PM6 to generate the reaction pathway; due to the low accuracy of PM6, several structures along the reaction pathway were extracted instead of the transition state structures suggested by the AFIR method, and the structures were optimized by fixing the geometric parameters corresponding to the reaction coordinates. The transition state was then obtained by fully optimizing at the M06-2X/6-31(d) level. A “pseudo” intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) approach confirmed the connectivity of the stationary points.39 The IRC calculations were performed in 20 steps (forward and backward) from the TS and the resulting structures were fully optimized at the M06-2X/BS1 level to obtain the minima.
 Fig. 2  An artificial force is applied between the red-circled atomic sites of fragment 1 and fragment 2. The MC-AFIR method considers fragment 1 and fragment 2 approaches from different directions to find the binding site for CO2 to the PDMS model system. 
The following equation was used to compute the enthalpy of CO2 binding to the PDMS trimer: ΔH = −(HPDMS–CO2 − (HPDMS + HCO2))(1)where HPDMS–CO2, HPDMS, and HCO2 are the enthalpy of a complex of PDMS trimer bound by CO2, the PDMS trimer, and a CO2 molecule, respectively. In this definition, a positive value indicates that the binding of CO2 stabilizes the system to PDMS.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. CO2 binding state of PDMS
For the complex of the PDMS trimer and CO2 (Fig. 3), the initial configuration generated by the MC-AFIR calculation was optimized at the M06-2X/6-31G* level, yielding 25 distinguishable binding states. The MC-AFIR simulations do not constrain the dihedral angles of the PDMS trimer, resulting in various conformations. By plotting the dihedral angles (φ1 to φ6) of the PDSM trimer, it is clear that they are distributed over a wide range (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is important for detecting the maximum binding enthalpy of CO2 to PDMS.
 Fig. 3  CO2 binding sites in PDMS trimers with various conformations. CO2 binding enthalpies (kcal mol−1) to PDMS trimers (ΔH) calculated at the M06-2X/6-311+G(2d,p)//M06-2X/6-31G* level are shown in descending-order. 
MC-AFIR simulations were performed for the PDMS systems chemically modified with main group elements, using an artificial force parameter of 20 kJ mol−1 (= 47.8 kcal mol−1). This parameter defines an approximate upper limit to the height of the barrier that can be overcome under artificial forces.40 As a results, only structures with CO2 physisorption or hydrogen bonding were obtained for all the systems chemically modified by main group elements. This implies that chemical reactions rarely occur at room temperature. Therefore, chemical modifications were performed for every 25 structures obtained in the PDMS–CO2 complex, and CO2 binding enthalpies were calculated for the optimized structures. However, in the systems chemically modified with Mg and Ti, the MC-AFIR simulations detected both physisorption and chemisorption. Therefore, the structures created in each MC-AFIR simulation were geometrically optimized in these systems to calculate the CO2 binding enthalpy.

Fig. 3 shows the structures of 25 CO2-bound PDMS trimers, arranged in order of increasing binding enthalpy; the maximum binding enthalpy of CO2 to PDMS is 6.8 kcal mol−1. In this structure, the site in the PDMS site closest to the carbon of CO2 is the oxygen of the Si–O framework, and the distance between the CO2 carbon and oxygen of the Si–O framework is 2.74 Å (Fig. 1). This indicates that CO2 is physisorbed rather than chemisorbed on PDMS.
To investigate larger configurational spaces, it is desirable to use methods with lower computational costs. One such method is a semi-empirical method such as PM6. However, when the structure with the highest CO2 binding enthalpy at the M06-2X functional group (PDMS-1, Fig. 3) was optimized at the PM6 level as the starting structure, it deviated significantly from the optimized structure for M06-2X (Fig. S2, ESI†). This suggests that the use of PM6 for the final structure determination is not appropriate.
3.2. Chemical modification by non-metallic elements/non-metallic chemical groups

Fig. 4(a) plots the CO2 binding enthalpies of PDMS trimers and PDMS trimers substituted with major elements or chemical groups. The chemical modification with the highest binding enthalpy replaces silicon with carbon in the Si–O backbone, but the increment from PDMS is quite small (< 1 kcal mol−1). Looking at the structure with the highest CO2 binding enthalpy for PDMS-C (Fig. 4), the CO2 binding sites are similar to those of PDMS and are located inside the gradual cycle formed by the Si–O backbone (Fig. 4(b)).

(b) Structures of the chemically modified PDMS trimer showing the maximum CO2 binding enthalpy. The calculated CO2 binding enthalpy (ΔH), the sum of Mulliken atomic charge of CO2 (Q(CO2)), and the bond angle of O–C–O (∠O–C–O) are given in kcal mol−1, elementary charge (e), and degree, respectively. 
In PDMS–OH, where an OH group replaces CH3, a slightly larger CO2 binding enthalpy than in PDMS is obtained. A hydrogen bond (R(O–H) = 2.29 Å) is formed between the CO2 oxygen and the OH group hydrogen. However, the formation of this hydrogen bond does not result in a significant increase in the CO2 bond enthalpy. This is presumably due to the low polarity of CO2 and the fact that the interaction with the Si–O backbone is reduced due to the formation of this hydrogen bond. When the density of OH groups is increased, the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds may increase the bond enthalpy even further. The introduction of phenyl groups, as well as OH groups, results in a small increment of the binding enthalpy. The introduction of polar chemical groups to PDMS has also been reported; Selyanchyn et al.41 showed that incorporating phthalic acid into PDMS improved the CO2 selectivity of CO2/N2 gas separation. Thus, introducing polarity to PDMS can essentially be a fundamental strategy to increase CO2 affinity.
Overall, the interaction of CO2 with PDMS trimers chemically modified with non-metallic chemical groups is found to be weak. These weak interactions are also predicted from the total charge of CO2. While substantial charge transfer is observed when the interaction is large, as seen when CO2 binds to the active center of the organometallic complex in the catalytic CO2 reduction reaction,42 in the systems shown in Fig. 5, the CO2 charge derived by Mulliken and natural population analysis is close to zero (Fig. 4 and Table S1, ESI†).

3.3. Chemical modification with Mg
To our knowledge, there have been no experiments in which Mg was incorporated into PDMS as a single ion or complex Mg(OH)2, and its geometric structure is unknown. Therefore, we constructed three model systems (Fig. 1(b)), PDMS-Mg, PDMS-Mg(OH)2, and PDMS-Mg-MDMS, and investigated the CO2 binding modes and enthalpies.


PDMS-Mg
          . 
In this system, Mg was used to replace the silicon in the PDMS trimer, and four water molecules were coordinated to Mg instead of the two methyl groups attached to the Si. Such a model construction is reasonable because Mg takes a six-coordinated hydrated structure.43 In the complex of PDMS-Mg and CO2, the structure of the local energy minimum obtained from MC-AFIR simulations can be categorized into five CO2 binding modes (Fig. 5).
In PDMS-Mg-M1, CO2 is either physically adsorbed on PDMS-Mg, or a hydrogen bond is formed between the oxygen of CO2 and the water coordinated to Mg. In PDMS-Mg-M2, CO2 is chemically bonded to the oxygen of the Mg–O framework via carbon. In PDMS-Mg-M3, the water coordinated to Mg is released, and a chemical bond is formed between the open site of Mg and the oxygen of CO2. Here the binding enthalpy of the water molecule to Mg is 1.5 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 6), and it is easy to dissociate from the Mg site. In PDMS-Mg-M4, CO2 bonds to the oxygen of the Mg–O skeleton via carbon and further bonds to Mg via oxygen. In other words, PDMS-Mg-M4 contains both PDMS-Mg-M2 and PDMS-Mg-M3 chemical bonds; in PDMS-Mg-M5, the Mg–O bonds in the skeleton are cleaved, and the oxygen of CO2 bonds to Mg, the carbon of CO2 bonds to the oxygen that was bound to Mg, and CO2 is bound to the Mg–O skeleton and is completely incorporated into the Mg–O framework.

Among the five M1–M5 modes in PDMS-Mg, PDMS-Mg-M5 exhibited the highest CO2 binding enthalpy (Fig. 7), with a maximum binding enthalpy of 18.2 kcal mol−1. The binding enthalpy of CO2 to PDMS-Mg, which forms a chemical bond with CO2, is more than twice the binding enthalpy in PDMS, which can only physically adsorb CO2. The maximum CO2 binding enthalpy in PDMS-Mg-M1 (8.8 kcal mol−1) is larger than the maximum CO2 binding enthalpy in PDMS (6.8 kcal mol−1). This is probably due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules coordinated to Mg and CO2. In the structure that exhibits the largest bond enthalpy, the O⋯H bond length is 1.98 Å, indicating the formation of the hydrogen bond.
 Fig. 7  (a) Plots of CO2 binding enthalpies to Ti-incorporated PDMS trimers. (b) Structures of three models of Ti-incorporated PDMS trimers showing the maximum CO2 binding enthalpy. The calculated CO2 binding enthalpy (ΔH), the sum of Mulliken atomic charge of CO2 (Q(CO2)), and the bond angle of O–C–O (∠O–C–O) are given in kcal mol−1, elementary charge (e), and degree, respectively. 
While only physical adsorption occurred on PDMS chemically substituted by the main group element, chemisorption occurs on PDMS chemically substituted by Mg, resulting in a significant change in the electronic state of CO2. This leads to a large change in the shape of CO2. Specifically, the O–C–O angles at the maximum binding enthalpy of CO2 in PDMS-Mg-M2, PDMS-Mg-M4, and PDMS-Mg-M5 are significantly bent at 131.9°, 132.2°, and 126.2°, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). As a result, the sum of the Mulliken charges of CO2 in these modes is significantly negatively shifted: −0.36, −0.27, and −0.40 for PDMS-Mg-M2, PDMS-Mg-M4, and PDMS-Mg-M5, respectively (Fig. 5(b)). The total charge of CO2 estimated by natural population analysis was also the most negative in PDMS-Mg-M5, as was the total charge of CO2 estimated by Mulliken population analysis (Table S1, ESI†). The CO2 binding enthalpy was highest in PDMS-Mg-M5, suggesting that there is some correlation between the binding enthalpy and the amount of charge transfer.
As shown in Fig. 6, the three CO2 binding modes of PDMS-Mg, PDMS-Mg-M3, PDMS-Mg-M4, and PDMS-Mg-M5 are interconvertible. Starting from PDMS-Mg, one water molecule dissociates from Mg, leading to PDMG-Mg. The oxygen of CO2 coordinates to the open site of the generated Mg. Then, the carbon of CO2 chemically binds to the oxygen bound to Mg to form PDMS-Mg-M4. The reaction barriers for the conversion of PDMS-Mg-M3 to PDMS-Mg-M4 and PDMS-Mg-M4 to PDMS-Mg-M5 are all less than 10 kcal mol−1, suggesting that their conversions easily occur. Furthermore, the similar thermodynamic stabilities of PDMS-Mg-M4 and PDMS-Mg-M5 suggest the possibility of their coexistence.



PDMS-Mg(OH)2
          . 
In PDMS-Mg(OH)2, two OH groups are coordinated to Mg and two oxygen atoms in the Si–O framework. Two binding modes were obtained in this system. CO2 is either physisorbed or hydrogen bonds are formed in one bonding mode. While in the other, the OH group of Mg reacts with CO2 to form the MgCO3H group (Fig. 5(c)). The maximum binding enthalpy of CO2 in the physisorption is 4.5 kcal mol−1, whereas the formation of the MgCO3H moiety is 16.1 kcal mol−1, implying that the formation of MgCO3H occurs primarily.



PDMS-Mg-PDMS
          . 
In this model, two PDMS trimers are bound to Mg via oxygen. The coordination geometry of the most stable Mg center was square rather than planar. We attempted to coordinate the two water molecules to produce a six-coordinated structure when constructing the model. However, structural optimization resulted in the dissociation of the Mg–O oxygen due to the coordination of water. Therefore, we did not incorporate water molecules in this model.
After the MC-AFIR simulation of CO2 adsorption on PDMS-Mg-PDMS, structural optimization by DFT methods identified two binding modes: physisorption and CO2 oxygen coordination to Mg. The CO2 oxygen coordination to Mg had a similar binding mode to PDMS-Mg-M3, and the maximum binding enthalpy of CO2 was also similar to that of PDMS-Mg-M3.
Overall, the estimated maximum CO2 binding enthalpy of the system incorporating Mg is 18.2 kcal mol−1 for the PDMS-Mg-M5 CO2 binding mode, which is significantly larger than that of PDMS (6.8 kcal mol−1). Yaghi et al.44 showed that Mg-MOF-74, a MOF with coordinatively unsaturated Mg (open sites), is superior for CO2 separation. In other words, Mg-MOF-74 not only readily traps CO2 but also releases CO2 at relatively low temperatures, providing a good balance between CO2 capture and release. For Mg-MOF-74, the enthalpy of CO2 adsorption is reported to be 9.3 kcal mol−1, while for PDMS-Mg-M5, the binding enthalpy is calculated to be about twice that of PDMS-Mg-M5, predicting that higher temperatures are required for CO2 release. The binding enthalpy of PDMS-Mg-M5 (18.2 kcal mol−1) is closer to the CO2 binding enthalpy to the mono-ethanol–amine mixture (20.1 kcal mol−1).45
Mg has been shown to be important not only in CO2 capture but also in catalytic CO2 conversion. An experimental study20 has reported that the Lewis acid Mn(OTf)2 (OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate) has a significant effect on the catalytic efficiency of CO2 reduction over homogeneous catalysts. Our theoretical studies on this system show that Mn(OTf)2 significantly lowers the reaction barrier for CO bond cleavage in the CO2 reduction reaction by Mn bpy complexes.21

3.4. Chemical modification with Ca/Sr
Furthermore, we investigated the CO2 binding enthalpies of systems incorporating Ca and Sr instead of Mg. PDMS-Ca-M5 and PDMS-Sr-M5 were constructed by replacing Ca and Sr with Mg for PDMS-Mg-M5, which showed the highest CO2 binding enthalpy in the PDMS-Mg system. The binding enthalpies of CO2 in PDMS-Ca-M5 and PDMS-Sr-M5 were 15.3 kcal mol−1 and 17.8 kcal mol−1, respectively (Table 1), showing that incorporating Ca and Sr is as effective as incorporating Mg in increasing the CO2 binding enthalpy.

Several material systems have reported more efficient CO2 capture with Ca and Sr incorporation. Gao et al.46 investigated CO2 adsorption on fullerenes (C60) using DFT calculations and showed that CO2 adsorption on pure C60 is very weak, but when decorated with Ca, the Ca acts as a binding site for CO2, significantly increasing the adsorption energy of CO2 on C60. According to their calculations, the adsorption energy of CO2 on Ca-modified C60 was 14.7 kcal mol−1 compared to 0.9 kcal mol−1 for pristine C60. Darvishnejad et al.47 showed that CO2 could be trapped on Sr incorporated in graphene by DFT calculations. The average value of the CO2 adsorption energy for pristine graphene is −6.0 kcal mol−1, whereas the adsorption energy increases to −12.5 kcal mol−1 when Sr is introduced. These trends are consistent with incorporating Mg, Ca, and Sr into PDMS.
3.5. Chemical modification with Ti
CO2 adsorption on PDMS with Ti, a 3d transition metal, was also investigated. In the Ti incorporated model, PDMS-Ti(OH)2, two OH groups and two oxygen atoms in the main chain are coordinated to Ti. The coordination of the two OH groups is impossible in the system with Mg; however, in the Ti system, this four-coordination stabilizes the system.
The CO2 binding to PDMS-Ti(OH)2 was classified into three modes (Fig. 7(b)). In the first mode, CO2 is physically adsorbed or forms hydrogen bonds. In the second mode, the oxygen of CO2 bonds to Ti, and the carbon of CO2 bonds to oxygen. In the third mode, CO3H is formed. The binding mode of CO2 in PDMS-Ti(OH)2-M4 is similar to that of PDMS-Mg-M4, but the binding enthalpy of CO2 is not as large as that of PDMS-Mg-M4. This is probably because of the electron density of the oxygen to which CO2 binds electrophilically. The Mulliken charge of oxygen in PDMS with Mg ranges from −0.78e to 0.79e for PDMS-Mg in the absence of CO2 but from −0.73e to 0.75e for the Ti-doped system. This fact indicates the importance of introducing elements that increase the electron density of oxygen.
3.6. Quantitative accuracy of M06-2X
In this study, the M06-2X functional was applied to all systems chemically modified with major elements, alkaline earth metals, and transition metals. However, previous studies have reported that M06-2X (Hartree–Fock exchange ratio: Ex = 27%) behaves well for the thermodynamics of non-covalent interactions in compounds consisting of major elements, while M06 (Ex = 15%) behaves better in transition metal complexes.24 Therefore, among the chemically modified systems of PDMS, it is expected that the density functionals that show the best performance will be different for each system.
Here, for future studies, we compared the CO2 binding enthalpies to PDMS calculated by the M06-2X functional with those calculated by DLPNO-CCSD(T) (domain-based local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster singles and doubles plus perturbative triples) which has been shown to contain 99.9% of the CCSD(T) electronic correlation.48,49 The details of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculation are described in the ESI.† The results show that M06-2X-D3 overestimates the CO2 binding enthalpy of DLPNO-CCSD(T) by 0.4–5.2 kcal mol−1 (Fig. S3, ESI†).
To further clarify the contribution of the empirical dispersion term in M06-2X-D3 to the CO2 binding enthalpy, we compared it to M06-2X without the empirical dispersion correction. The contribution of the dispersion term was found to be in the range of 0.0–0.7 kcal mol−1 (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating that the deviation from DLPNO-CCSD(T) is mainly due to the M06-2X functional itself rather than dispersion correction.
Since the DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculation is more computationally expensive than DFT, DFT will have to be used in the future when screening chemically modified PDMS systems that exhibit large CO2 binding enthalpies. A more quantitative function should be considered in future studies.
4. Conclusions
The goal of this study was to use DFT calculations to provide guidelines for improving the weak interaction between PDMS and CO2. The PDMS trimer was used as a model system, chemically modified, and the binding enthalpy of CO2 was estimated. The calculations revealed the following.
The CO2 binding enthalpies of the system in which PDMS was replaced with a major element or chemical groups containing main group elements were similar to PDMS. The difference was less than 1 kcal mol−1, indicating no substantial change. However, for the systems in which OH and Ph groups were introduced into PDMS, which showed slight increases in binding enthalpy values, the specific interactions between CO2 and these chemical groups were predicted from their CO2 binding sites. This suggests that introducing chemical groups that form hydrogen bonds with CO2 or have pi-electrons that cause dispersive interactions with CO2 may be useful to enhance the interaction with CO2.
When Mg is doped, chemical bonds are formed between Mg and CO2, resulting in a significantly larger CO2 binding enthalpy than in PDMS. Detailed investigation of the Mg-doped system revealed that CO2 is incorporated into the main chain with a low enthalpy barrier and is chemically converted to carbonate. When OH groups are bonded to Mg, CO2 reacts with the OH groups to form hydrogen carbonate. On the other hand, the introduction of the 3d transition metal Ti does not increase the binding enthalpy of CO2. This is thought to be because the strong coordination environment of Ti limits the interaction with CO2 and the electronic polarization of the main chain is smaller than that of the introduction of Mg, which is not so favorable for interaction with the CO2 carbon.
Overall, it was discovered that adding alkaline earth metals to PDMS increased the CO2 binding enthalpy the most. The usefulness of alkaline earth metals for CO2 capture has already been reported for other material systems. However, the incorporation of alkaline earth metals into PDMS has the potential to accelerate the degradation of PDMS. This needs to be carefully investigated both experimentally and theoretically. In addition, other interactions with N2 and O2 present in the air need to be investigated to improve the performance of PDMS as a “molecular sieve”.
