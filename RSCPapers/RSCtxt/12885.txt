In order to better understand the growth process of this novel structure, anodized samples under alternating voltage (AV) conditions at different stages were systematically studied. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the morphology, structure, and crystalline and chemical components of the resulting TiO2 nanotubes. Meanwhile, the corresponding current versus time curves were recorded to monitor the process. Based on the results obtained, the possible formation mechanism of these novel nanotubes was explored. It was noted that the formation of double-walled and bamboo-type structure has a close relationship with the current density and ion-diffusion gradient inside the TiO2 nanotubes. In our experiment, the double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube arrays can be repeatedly and successfully synthesized via AV anodization. In addition, the solar-light induced photocatalytic decomposition of stearic acid of the nanotube arrays obtained was presented. Double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube arrays showed higher efficiencies than those based on smooth-walled nanotubes with the same tube length because of enhanced specific surface area.
Introduction
Compared with nanoparticles, titanium dioxide (TiO2) with one-dimensional nanostructures such as TiO2 nanotubes have attracted great interest in recent years because of their unique properties which are a combination of wide bandgap semiconductor properties with a large surface area and their well-ordered structure. TiO2 nanotubes have also shown superior material properties such as biocompatibility, enhanced cell growth, excellent optical and electrical characteristics, as well as unique nanotubular structures with tunable dimensions.1,2 TiO2 nanotubes have been widely used in solar energy conversion,3 photocatalysis,4 gas sensing,5 water splitting,6 biomedical materials,7 lithium ion batteries,8 drug delivery,9 and so on.
To date, many different methods have been developed for synthesizing TiO2 nanotubes such as sonoelectrochemistry,10 microwave,11 sol–gel,12 hydrothermal13 and anodic oxidation14,15 synthetic approaches. Among these methods, anodic oxidation is a simple, rapid and useful technique to obtain self-organized vertically oriented TiO2 nanotubes with ease of control over thickness, length, pore size and morphology. In this method, Ti, in the form of a film or foil, is anodized in fluoride ion containing electrolytes to form nanopores/tubes. The first porous oxide layers were anodically grown on Ti metal in 1999.16 After that, Grimes et al. obtained self-assembled TiO2 nanotube arrays by the anodization of a pure Ti sheet in an aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid in 2001.17 From then on, significant progress has been made in this field.18,19 The nanotube array length was subsequently increased from 500 nm to 7 μm by control of the anodization electrolyte pH, which reduced the chemical dissolution of TiO2 during the anodization.20 More recently, a new generation of vertically oriented TiO2 nanotubes with lengths of up to 134 μm has been fabricated by the use of organic electrolytes such as ammonium fluoride containing ethylene glycol.19 To date, the largest tube diameter and length of TiO2 nanotubes have been up to 800 nm21 and 1 mm,22 respectively. Although electrochemical anodization is the easiest method for preparing highly ordered nanotubes, directly prepared TiO2 nanotube arrays show amorphous structures,23 which have low conductivity and mechanical strength, and an annealing treatment is required to transform the amorphous phase into three different types of crystalline phase: anatase, rutile and brookite.
It is well-known that the properties and application performance of TiO2 partly depend on its crystallinity and morphology.14 As for TiO2 nanotubes, on the one hand the morphologies of TiO2 nanotubes have a potential effect on its application performance; on the other hand the morphologies are directly affected by the conditions and parameters of electrochemical anodization. Therefore, investigation of the effect of the conditions and parameters of electrochemical anodization on self-organized TiO2 nanotubes attracts considerable attention.1 With the goal of preparing TiO2 nanotube arrays with a large surface area that is almost defect free and have perfect alignment, the Grimes and Schmuki groups have conducted comprehensive studies on Ti foil anodization.15,17,24 In their published work, the effect of the electrochemical sweep rate, electrolyte concentration, applied voltage, oxidation time, as well as other important factors on the nanotube structure was investigated in detail. More recently, the effect of electrolyte temperature on the formation of highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays has also been investigated by Zhou et al.25
Furthermore, some novel structures of TiO2 based on its highly ordered nanotube arrays were also achieved. For example, in order to further increase the specific surface area of smooth-walled nanotube arrays, Albu et al. reported that nanotubes with bamboo-like morphologies could be obtained if the anodization process was carried out under alternating voltage (AV) conditions.26 The resulting dye sensitized solar cells fabricated from these bamboo-like TiO2 nanotubes have been shown to exhibit a significantly higher efficiency than those based on smooth-walled nanotubes because of the substantial increase in dye loading achieved through the stratified rings that are formed.27 Then, Li et al.14 employed AV anodization to synthesize ordered TiO2 nanotubes with bamboo-shaped upper sections and smooth-walled lower sections. After that, Zhang et al. synthesized bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube arrays using an alternating current condition by using relatively high voltages (80 V and 30 V), and reported a slightly improved photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 3.47%.28 Besides the bamboo structure, Schmuki et al. also found that TiO2 nanotubes with double-walled inner and outer shell structures can be achieved in an ethylene glycol based electrolyte.29 The two shells can either be separated or fused together using different thermal annealing treatments. More importantly, highly regular and robust TiO2 membranes can be obtained with a crystal structure that can be adjusted to an anatase or an anatase/rutile mixture. In addition, Lin et al. developed hierarchically structured TiO2 nanotubes composed of nanoparticles with reduced crystal size by using hydrothermal processing methods,30 thereby yielding more surface area for dye anchoring. The nanotubes were then utilized as the photoanode material to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells under a backside illumination mode, which exhibited a high photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 7.12%.
More recently, Ji et al. reported that ordered arrays of TiO2 nanotubes with double-walled structures and bamboo-like morphologies can be prepared by a one-step titanium foil anodic oxidation using a solution of NH4F and ethylene glycol as electrolyte.31 Furthermore, by optimizing the electrochemical conditions, tuning the double-walled stratified structure such as the spacing between bamboo rings, and the inner and outer diameter of the obtained nanotubes could be achieved. Subsequently, the fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells based on these novel nanotubes in a front-side illumination mode yielded a significantly high power conversion efficiency of 3.46%, which was approximately two-fold higher than solar cells that were fabricated using traditional single-walled TiO2 nanotube arrays with smooth surfaces.32 More interestingly, it was found that dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated from nanotubes with higher bamboo ring densities exhibited better conversion efficiencies than those prepared from nanotubes with lower bamboo ring densities. From all the results discussed above, one can see that these new TiO2 nanostructures provide a larger surface area because of the extra interfaces or rough walls, while retaining the vertically ordered one-dimensional nanostructure.
Although the photovoltaic conversion efficiencies of these novel TiO2 nanotube-based devices were still inferior to those of TiO2 nanoparticle-based dye-sensitized solar cells, we are reasonably sure that higher photocurrent efficiency can be attained by further optimizing the architecture of the TiO2 nanotubes and the dye-sensitization process. Because the solar conversion efficiency can be strongly improved by modulating the TiO2 nanotube morphology, preparing the nanotubes with improved specific surface area such as double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes makes great sense. These kinds of novel structure based on TiO2 nanotubes with improved performance have attracted tremendous interest among researchers.33,34 The effect of electrochemical anodization parameters on the structure of double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes and the photovoltaic performance of these novel TiO2 nanotube-based dye-sensitized solar cells have been discussed in our previous papers. However, to the best of our knowledge, the growth mechanism and photocatalytic activity of double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes have not been explored.
In this paper, we report on the possible formation mechanism and photocatalytic performance of double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes via anodization of titanium foils in a fluoride-containing solution under specifically controlled AV conditions. The anodized samples were investigated at different stages to better understand the formation of this structure. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the morphology, structure, and crystalline and chemical components of the resulting TiO2 nanotube arrays. Meanwhile, the corresponding current versus time curves were recorded to monitor the process. Based on the results obtained, the possible growth mechanism of these double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes are discussed. In addition, the solar-light induced photocatalytic decomposition of stearic acid based on these nanotube arrays is presented.
Results
To better understand the formation process of this novel structure, the morphologies of the TiO2 nanotube arrays prepared at different time intervals such as 0.5 hours, 4 hours and 10 hours were examined. Meanwhile, the anodic current was registered during the experiment under the same AV sequence of 6 min at 40 V and 2 min at 120 V. Fig. 1 shows the top and cross-sectional view of nanotube arrays grown under AV conditions, in an electrolyte consisting of 0.25 wt% NH4F in ethylene glycol. After 0.5 h of anodization, a very regular layer with a thickness of about 2.5 μm forms. In addition, there is a compact oxide thin film found on the surface. The presence of a non-tubular compact layer is frequently observed in the very first moments of anodization.35,36 Under higher magnification, the average diameter of the pores is revealed to be very small, only around 20 nm. However, no obvious double-walled and bamboo-type structure can be observed at the beginning of AV anodization. The possible explanation is that the drive force for anodization is mostly used for chemical dissolution of the compact layer.

The corresponding current densities recorded during the anodization of Ti under AV conditions are shown in the right column. 
With the oxidation time increasing to four hours, ordered double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube layers have been prepared as shown in Fig. 1b. The top view in Fig. 1b clearly shows that the TiO2 tubular structure evolves from a single layer structure above to a double-layer structure below. The cross-sectional view shows that the tubular structure is double-walled. The observed diameter of the inner pore is about 21 nm, which is basically the same as the sample with 0.5 hours of anodization. In addition, the average distance between two neighboring rings is about 450 nm.
When the oxidation time was further increased to 10 hours, by close examination of the prepared nanotube arrays it can be found that the inner pore diameter and outer shell thickness are 70 nm and 30 nm, respectively. The distance between two neighboring rings is about 220 nm. By comparison with the results for an anodization time of four hours, it can be concluded that the ridge spacing is decreased with further increases in the anodization time. However, in the report by Wang et al., they claimed that ridge spacing is determined by high-voltage anodization time.37 The ridge spacing increases linearly with the high-voltage anodization time.
In addition, the nanotubes obtained are closely packed, and their gaps become narrow when near to the bottom, which makes ion diffusion much more difficult. Interestingly, by comparing the top view images of samples at different intervals, it can be observed that the top layer of single-walled TiO2 nanotube arrays disappeared by increasing the anodization time, which is related to the dissolution by electrolyte during the anodization process. The detailed parameters of all the resulting samples are listed in Table 1. It can be found that with increasing AV anodization time, the tube diameter increased from 50 nm (0.5 h) to 63 nm (10 h). The outer shell thickness increased from 28 nm to 58 nm and the tube length from 2.3 μm to 20 μm. However, the bamboo spacing reduced from 450 nm (4 h) to 220 nm (10 h).

Because it is well known that current–time transients during anodic oxidation of Ti under constant voltage or AV conditions reveal details about different stages of the film growth process and corresponding morphologies,38–41 the anodic current during the experiment under AV conditions was registered and is shown in the right column in Fig. 1.
For the sample with an anodization time of 0.5 hours, the Ti foil with applied low voltage (40 V) at the beginning results in a maximum high current. In the meantime, a sharp current drop can be observed because of the formation of an initial oxide layer on the Ti metal surface. After six minutes of constant voltage anodization, the electrode showed a sharp increase when a high voltage (120 V) was applied, then the current drops at a reducing rate because of the origination of pores or tubes in the oxide film. Within the tube growth, the voltage is quickly altered to 40 V, yielding an instant current drop. Subsequently, the gradually decreased current density during the constant voltage (40 V) anodization for 6 min suggests that the oxide film becomes thicker. After several repeating cycles, by 0.5 hours, the current density under high-voltage is stable at 10 mA cm−2. However, the current density under low voltage is much smaller, and close to zero. For the sample with anodization time of 4 hours, after 4 hours of AV anodization, the average current density stabilizes at 9.5 mA cm−2. For the sample with an anodization time of 10 hours, after 10 hours of AV anodization, the current density gradually decreases and stabilizes at 8.2 mA cm−2. The gradually decreasing anodic current density with increasing anodization time determined lower kinetics for the longitudinal tube growth, which gives rise to the gradual increase in bamboo ring spacing.31 In addition, it can be seen that these current–time plots are similar to each other, suggesting some similarities in the growth of the TiO2 nanotubes during multi-voltage alterations. It also means that the synthesis of double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube arrays is reliable and controllable according to our experiment.
To further confirm this novel double-walled and bamboo-type tubular structure, TEM images were taken and these are shown in Fig. 2. From the TEM images (Fig. 2a), the straight hollow channel structure in the middle and symmetrical interface between the inner wall and outer shell (labeled as A and B) at the edge are revealed, which demonstrate the double-walled structure of the nanotubes obtained. Fig. 2b shows a view of a single nanotube with a bamboo ring skeleton. It is observed that some rings had been broken or removed, which could be a result of the sonication in the sample preparing step. As observed from Fig. 2a and b, it is apparent that the nanotubes obtained are “double-walled and bamboo-type”. The nanotubes obtained have a diameter of around 60 nm for the inner pore and a wall thickness of 30 nm for the outer shell, which is in good agreement with the results obtained using FE-SEM. Furthermore, the thickness of the nanotubes (for both the inner and outer shells) remains almost constant from the top to the end, which indicates that chemical etching of the tube walls in the fluoride containing electrolyte is minimal. Fig. 2c is a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the sample. The observed lattice spacing of 0.267 nm in the image corresponds to the (110) plane of anatase (JPCDS 21-1272), confirming that the nanotube membrane is TiO2.

Crystallinity of the calcined TiO2 nanotubes
X-ray diffraction. In Fig. 3, the XRD spectra of the annealed TiO2 nanotube arrays on Ti foil are shown. Since the as-prepared TiO2 films are amorphous,42 heat-treatment is usually required to realize the phase conversion to anatase. When the TiO2 is sintered at 500 °C, the anatase phase43 is often obtained with a refractive index of 2.5,44 which can be completely converted to rutile (n ∼ 2.70–3.0) at 1000 °C. In Fig. 3 the amorphous layer after annealing at 500 °C for 2 h in air is completely transformed into an anatase structure. The peaks at 2θ = 25.4°, 38.3°, 48.1°, 55.2°, and 62.3° correspond to the different crystal planes in the anatase TiO2, whereas all of the other peaks could be related to the Ti metal substrate. No rutile phase is observed in these samples. This result is in contrast to that found with nanotube arrays also formed from Ti thick-film foils, where an earlier study noted that the rutile phase appears at 430 °C and both rutile and anatase co-exist until ∼620 °C.45 At stages (Δt = 0.5 and 4 h), both phases of Ti foil and TiO2 were detected, which suggests that the surface of Ti foil was only partially oxidized. With an increase of the oxidation time to 10 hours, a stronger reflection corresponding to the anatase phase of TiO2 was found, demonstrating that the degree of coverage of TiO2 nanocrystalline tubes on the surface of Ti foil was increased significantly.

Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra taken for the TiO2 nanotube samples before and after annealing. The Ti–O–Ti network peaks in the 400–700 cm−1 range are characteristic of anatase and rutile structures.46 Typically, there are six Raman active fundamental modes observed at 144 cm−1 (Eg), 197 cm−1 (Eg), 397 cm−1 (B1g), 518 cm−1 (A1g + B1g) and 640 cm−1 (Eg) for anatase TiO2. For rutile TiO2, there are four Raman active modes at 144 cm−1 (B1g), 448 cm−1 (Eg), 613 cm−1 (A1g) and 827 cm−1 (B2g).47

Directly after anodization the TiO2 nanotube structure obtained was amorphous, as revealed by Raman spectroscopy, for which a broadband spectrum ranging from 100 to 1200 cm−1 is evident (red curve in Fig. 4). After thermal annealing, the amorphous TiO2 nanotube structures were converted into the more photoactive anatase phase. The annealed TiO2 nanotube arrays displayed Raman signals at 145 cm−1, 398 cm−1, 516 cm−1 and 640 cm−1, which can be attributed to the phonon modes of the anatase phase.48,49 The obtained results are in accord with the XRD results.

Solar-simulated photodegradation of stearic acid
The photocatalytic degradation of stearic acid on the surface of the double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes with an anodization time of 10 hours is shown in Fig. 5a. For comparison, the attenuated total reflectance-Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of stearic acid coated single-layer TiO2 nanotubes prepared under constant voltage (40 V) anodization with basically the same length were also studied (Fig. 5b). Stearic acid, a high molecular weight compound, is often used as a model pollutant to probe photocatalytic activity. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was employed to monitor the decomposition of stearic acid. The asymmetric and symmetric C–H stretching modes of the CH2 group at 2915 and 2848 cm−1 were monitored as a function of irradiation time. A decrease in C–H stretch vibrational signal intensity indicates the successful removal of stearic acid from the surface.50
 Fig. 5  ATR-FTIR spectra of stearic acid coated TiO2 nanotube arrays with different architecture (a) double-walled and bamboo-type, (b) single-layer as a function of visible light irradiation time using a xenon lamp with an AM1.5 and a 10 cm water/glass filter to eliminate UV and IR radiation. 
From Fig. 5, one can see that the CH2 stretch peaks at 2848 and 2915 cm−1 decrease in intensity with increasing exposure time to the light. The decrease in area beneath the CH2 stretch peaks can be used to measure the disappearance of stearic acid because of photocatalytic degradation.23 By comparing the area of the C–H stretch peaks at different stages, it can be observed that the photocatalytic decomposition rate at the initial stage is higher than that at longer irradiation times. By comparing the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 nanotube arrays with different architecture, it can be clearly seen that double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube arrays exhibited better behavior than single-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays. After 15 h of irradiation, the stearic acid decomposition had basically finished. However, the decomposition time for single-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays was 20 hours. All the photocatalytic decomposition tests are spectrally limited with an AM1.5 and a water heat filter. The superior photocatalytic performance of double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube arrays could be derived from their improved specific surface area. The presence of double-walled and bamboo-like nanostructures provided more sites for photocatalytic decomposition of stearic acid. As a result, a quicker decomposition rate is obtained.
Discussion
Growth mechanism of double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes
In order to better understand the growth processes of double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes, a detailed schematic is given in Fig. 6. The synthetic process of TiO2 nanotube arrays and the mechanism of anodization had already been investigated in detail.42 Mor et al.51 suggested that Ti anodization occurs as a result of competition between electrochemical oxide formation and chemical dissolution of oxide by fluoride ions. For anodization, the Ti films should be placed in a conductive electrolyte along with a counter electrode. The growth process of nanotubes has three main stages. First, under constant voltage conditions, a compact oxide layer forms that hampers further ion transfer corresponding to the electrochemical anodization according to reaction (1): 
Ti + 2H2O = TiO2 + 4H+ + 4e−
(1)
 Fig. 6  Schematic diagram showing the growth of double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes via AV oxidation: (a) compact layer growth; (b) steady growth of single-layer TiO2 nanotubes; (c) pores formed at the bottom of nanotubes when a low voltage is applied; (d) formation of double-layer smooth TiO2 nanotubes and their steady growth at a high voltage; (e) pit or pore formation in the barrier layer after the voltage is altered to a low value; (f) continuous growth of double-walled and bamboo-type nanostructures in the lower layer; (g) formation of double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes from top to bottom repeatedly. 
In the second stage, the layer is partially perforated by fluoride ions accompanying an oxide dissolution,38 and a fine porous layer forms. This means that the chemical dissolution will drive the electrochemical oxide formation. During this process, the fluoride anion is consumed, which is the key to controlling the surface morphology according to reaction (2): 
TiO2 + 4H+ + 6F− = TiF62− + 2H2O
(2)
In the third stage, the situation is stabilized; the rate of titanium oxide growth assisted by the electric field equals the rate of dissolution by fluoride ions. Thus, regularly growing pores or tubes are formed. In summary, the formation of TiO2 nanotubes is governed by competition between the anodic oxide formation and chemical dissolution of the oxide as soluble fluoride complexes. More recently, Wang et al. reported in detail that the growth of single-layer TiO2 nanotubes is highly dependent on stable ion concentration profiles (e.g., pH gradient) established inside the nanotubes and the cavities under constant voltage anodizing conditions.52 In addition, efficient variations of the concentration profiles on the switch of high and low anodic voltages will induce their evolution to a double-layer structure with smooth tubes in both the upper layer and lower layer.
In our experiment, the possible formation process of double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes can be described as follows. In the first step (Fig. 6a), a compact oxide layer forms that hampers further ion transfer after applying a voltage. Then the layer is partially perforated by fluoride ion migration and accompanying oxide dissolution,35 and a fine porous layer forms. Subsequently, the growth of single-layer TiO2 nanotubes and cavities is established under high constant voltage anodizing conditions (120 V) (Fig. 6b). Meanwhile, barrier breakdown occurs because of the presence of F− ions under the electric field. When the low voltage anodization proceeds, tiny pits and pores emerge and could grow in the barrier layer as shown in Fig. 6c.37 In addition, when the voltage is switched to a lower value (40 V), fewer H+ ions are produced and the pH gradient profile in lower-layer nanotubes becomes less steep. After that, high constant voltage anodizing conditions (120 V) are applied, and the formation of double-walled structure TiO2 nanotubes can be achieved (Fig. 6d). The observed cross-sectional view as shown in Fig. 1b supports this supposition. It appears that the interface between the pore formed and the bottom layer of nanotubes provides a new growth pathway for TiO2 nanotubes.
A possible explanation can be derived from the applied high current density and high concentration of H+ ions to induce the formation of a double-walled structure. In addition, during the high voltage anodization process, water decomposition at the bottom of the tube yields H+ ions and a stable pH gradient profile is established to allow the steady growth of lower layer nanotubes with double-walled structure (Fig. 6d). However, the resulting thickness of the outer shell of the nanotube layer is much thinner than the inner tube wall. When more AV steps are applied, the relatively thin wall thickness could not induce wall separation to occur again. As a result, a continuous double-walled structure growing in the lower layer can be obtained (Fig. 6f). Referring to the bamboo ridge on the surface of the nanotubes, the possible formation mechanism is as follows. During the steady growing stage of the anodization, for a current rush, the oxidation speed reaches a maximum value. The corresponding oxidation of Ti is fast (not only in the vertical direction, but also in the horizontal direction), which gives rise to the temporarily thickened barrier layer leaving some debris on the tube walls. Under these conditions, the remaining residues of the thickened barrier layer on the walls of two neighboring tubes form ridges. Thus, a bamboo-type structure is generated.
However, at the beginning of AV anodization, the presence of open entrances facilitates the diffusion of F− ions and H2O. The ridge morphologies formed could be partially or totally dissolved into electrolyte. As a result, the bamboo structure on the nanotube surface is indistinct. With further increases in the anodization time, the upper-layer tubes are formed and the ridge layers hinder inward diffusion of ionic species (e.g., F− ions and H+) from reaching the tube base, which creates a different electrolyte environment there. Thus, the effect of dissolution by electrolyte can be ignored. As a result, bamboo ridge structure becomes more and more obvious in the lower layer. In addition, with increases in the anodization time, the gradually decreasing anodic current density determines lower kinetics for the longitudinal tube growth, which gives rise to closely compacted nanotubes with gradually decreased bamboo ring spacing. Meanwhile, as more high/low-voltage anodization steps are applied, dissolution of the formed upper-layer of single-walled TiO2 nanotubes becomes more severe. As shown in our FE-SEM results, after 10 h of anodization the formed upper layers of single-walled TiO2 nanotubes are mostly dissolved by the chemical dissolution, which is due to the presence of fluoride ions. Finally, TiO2 nanotubes with combined double-walled and bamboo-type structures from top to bottom can be prepared (Fig. 6g). From all the discussion previously, it is known that both current density during the anodization process and ion diffusion inside nanotubes are significantly important not only for the initiation of the double-walled structure below, but also for the formation of bamboo ridges on the nanotube surface.
Conclusions
In summary, double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube arrays can be repeatedly synthesized by AV anodization of pure Ti in a fluoride-containing ethylene glycol solution. Anodization at different time intervals was investigated to better understand the formation process of these novel structures. The obtained TiO2 nanotube arrays were characterized with FE-SEM, TEM, XRD and Raman spectroscopy methods. Meanwhile, the corresponding current versus time curves were recorded to monitor the growth process. Experimental results showed that the continuous application of a high current and the presence of fluoride ions under a high electric field played important roles in the formation of a double-walled structure. With the fluctuation of AV during the process of anodization, the bamboo nodes occur and become more obvious on the nanotubes. Meanwhile, with increases in the anodization time, the dissolution of the formed upper-layer of single-walled TiO2 nanotubes becomes severe. Finally, TiO2 nanotubes with combined double-walled and bamboo-type structures from top to bottom can be obtained. On the basis of the results obtained, the possible growth mechanisms of these novel structures are proposed and both current density during the anodization process and ion diffusion in nanotubes are considered to be dominant factors. Since the resulting double-walled and bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes expressed larger specific surface areas than the single-layer nanotubes with the same length, which derived from extra layers or interfaces present between two neighboring nanotubes, they showed improved photocatalytic decomposition performance of stearic acid under the same solar-light irradiation conditions.
