    , Accepted 7th September 2022First published on 8th September 2022AbstractLow-dimensional hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have attracted significant attention for applications such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors. Compared with their three-dimensional counterparts, low-dimensional perovskites (LDPs) exhibit prominent characteristics such as stronger quantum confinement, remarkable exciton effects, and structural diversity, which are crucial for their nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. However, it remains hard to obtain ideal perovskite crystals with high optical transparency, large NLO responses, and excellent stability simultaneously, which are highly desirable for next-generation integrated photonics. In this work, a wide bandgap (4.2 eV) quasi-1D perovskite single crystal, PEA3PbBr5·H2O, with a considerable second-order NLO coefficient (0.1 pm V−1) that is 1/4 times that of the commercial crystal KH2PO4 (KDP), is reported. Power-, wavelength-, and polarization-dependent experiments are implemented, unfolding a high polarization ratio of up to 94%. Moreover, an unexpectedly anomalous green PL phenomenon from the single crystal is discovered. The upconversion emission in the crystal, as well as the time-resolved photoluminescence dynamics, is also investigated. Such a quasi-1D perovskite may provide a new platform for advancing the application of nonlinear optics.
Introduction
In the past few years, halide perovskites have emerged as a highly promising class of functional materials for optoelectronics, such as solar cells,1,2 light-emitting diodes,3,4 and photodetectors.5,6 Recently, perovskite-based wideband achromatic quarter-wave plates have also been reported.7 This is largely because of optoelectronic properties, for example, long carrier diffusion length, high photoluminescence quantum efficiency, and strong exciton–phonon coupling.8–11 Recently, their nonlinear optical (NLO) properties have gained increasing attention,12,13 due to their superior photophysical properties, such as large optical oscillator strength, and the presence of strong excitonic resonances,14–16 enabling halide perovskites to be an exciting platform as nonlinear optical materials.
Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are essential for the development of advanced modern technologies such as all-optical modulation,17–19 optical communication,20–22 and quantum information processes.23,24 To date, the linear electro-optic effect (Pockels effect),25 the photogalvanic effect,26,27 second harmonic generation (SHG)28,29 as well as ferroelectric effects30,31 have been observed in halide perovskites. Due to structure confinement, low-dimensional perovskites exhibit distinctive band structures compared with their 3D counterparts. Hence, LDPs combine the advantages of inorganic and organic materials, as well as perovskites and low-dimensional materials. These advantages endow LDPs with prominent characteristics such as stronger quantum confinement and remarkable exciton effects32 for NLO applications. Third-order nonlinear optical responses have been intensively investigated in perovskite crystals, such as two-photon absorption and upconversion lasing.31,33–36 However, second-order NLO responses, which require structural noncentrosymmetry, are less explored. The perovskites that simultaneously have high optical transparency, large second-order NLO responses, and robust stability are rare.
Herein, we develop a quasi-1D hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP) single crystal, PEA3PbBr5·H2O, with a wide bandgap of 4.2 eV. The wide bandgap and effective light–matter interaction due to its reduced dimension make it a potential material for efficient SHG responses. The growth of this quasi-1D perovskite was reported by Tao's group in 2020,37 whereas its singular and abundant nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were discovered and illustrated for the first time in this work. Strong optical anisotropy is observed in the crystals with large in-plane birefringence. By performing wavelength-, power-, and polarization-dependent experiments, efficient second-order NLO activity is demonstrated. Surprisingly, we observe unanticipated green in-gap emissions. This anomalous green PL is attributed to the crystal-incorporated substances, confirmed by confocal microscopy and PL imaging experiments. In addition, time-resolved photoluminescence is employed for studying the ultrafast dynamics of the green light emitter. The PEA3PbBr5·H2O crystal is expected to be adopted in nonlinear optical (NLO) devices such as ultrafast laser modulators.
Experimental details
Synthesis of perovskites
PEA (2.4236 g, 0.020 mol) and PbO (4.4640 g, 0.020 mol) were dissolved in 50 ml HBr solution under constant stirring at 75 °C, forming a colorless transparent solution. Then, the solution began to cool down and was saturated at 65 °C. The colorless transparent single crystals were grown for about three days, as shown in Fig. 1A.

(D) Measured and simulated powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the crystals. 
X-Ray crystallographic analysis
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) was performed on a Bruker-AXS D8 X-ray diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073). Using Olex2, the structure was solved with the ShelXS structure solution program by Direct Methods and refined with the ShelXL refinement package using least squares minimization. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO with a Cu Ka radiation source. The diffraction patterns were collected in the 2θ range of 5–80° with a step size of 0.008°.
Thermal gravimetric analysis
The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) for the PEA3PbBr5·H2O single crystal was performed in the air with a TA Instruments Q5000 IR thermogravimetric analyzer. The PEA3PbBr5·H2O single crystal used for the analysis had a mass of about 9.775 mg. The sample was heated from RT to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
Optical characterizations
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the single crystal were recorded using a broadband source (Energetiq EQ-99X LDLS) and a fiber optic spectrometer (Ideaoptics FX2000). The fluorescence images were captured using an EMCCD (Andor iXon Ultra 897) with a home-built microscope. For the single-photon excitation PL measurement, a 488 nm continuous wave (CW) laser was used to excite the sample. For the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement, the sample was excited using a 400 nm femtosecond laser (Spectra Physics Mai Tai, repetition frequency of 80 MHz, pulse width < 100 fs), where a 400 nm femtosecond laser pulse was generated using a second harmonic model. The PL decay was recorded using a TCSPC Module (PicoQuant, PicoHarp 300).
Nonlinear optical measurements
Nonlinear optical measurements were performed with a femtosecond laser (Spectra Physics Mai Tai, repetition frequency of 80 MHz, pulse width < 100 fs) in a simple home-built optical setup. The transmitted NLO signals through the target single crystal were detected using a spectrometer (Andor SR-500, equipped with a Newton CCD). The excitation wavelength was tuned from 780 to 1040 nm to examine the wavelength dependence of the samples. Lenses with 100 mm and 24 mm focal lengths were used to focus the laser on the crystal and collect the transmitted SHG and TPPL signals, respectively. The FWHM of the focused laser beam is approximately 80 μm. The linear polarization of the incident laser was tuned by rotating the half-wave plate.
Results and discussion
PEA3PbBr5·H2O single crystals

Fig. 1A presents a photo image of a PEA3PbBr5·H2O single crystal synthesized by the temperature-lowering method38 described in the Experimental section. The as-grown crystals are transparent with lateral sizes ranging from 3 to 5 mm and a thickness of about 1 mm. Flat microflakes (Fig. 1B) were prepared from the bulk crystal by the mechanical exfoliation technique. This is because the crystals are quasi-1D in the crystal structure, which was further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), as shown in Fig. 1C. Single-crystal structure analysis indicates that the crystal possesses a zigzag corner-sharing [PbBr5]∞ octahedral chain in the unit cell along with the b-axis shapes into the one-dimensional perovskite structure, which has a monoclinic crystal form with a space group of C2/c. The lattice constants are 29.269 Å, 8.137 Å and 27.879 Å, respectively, and the deflected axial angle is 92.448°. The crystal structure reported in this work is consistent with the reported CCDC data.37 More crystallographic data can be found in Table S1 (ESI†). The distance of adjacent [PbBr5]∞ octahedral chains is 6.727 Å along the c axial direction and 9.401 Å along the axial direction. Every inorganic [PbBr5]∞ octahedral chain is surrounded by phenethylammoniums via a coordination effect. Moreover, the water molecules can be found inserted between the phenethylammoniums in the c axial direction, and the hydrogen bond between water and ammonium decreases the intermediate spacing between [PbBr5]∞ octahedral chains and deforms the crystal structure to a certain extent, which makes the perovskite exhibit unique optical properties. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the water molecules begin to evaporate around 120 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). The purity of the crystal phase is identified that no other diffraction peaks are observed in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 1D). In addition, the simulated pattern of PEA2PbBr4 confirms that the bulk PEA3PbBr5·H2O single crystal has no PEA2PbBr4 impurity phase, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Unlike perovskites, such as MAPbI3, the crystal shows high stability. Degradation was not observed after several months in the atmosphere (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The transparent appearance of crystals suggests that they may have wide-gap features. To clarify this point, UV-Vis absorption spectra were taken for the exfoliated flakes. Fig. 2A presents the optical absorption spectrum, showing a strong excitonic absorption at around 325 nm, and bandgap edge absorption at 295 nm. To correctly determine the optical band gap, the Tauc plot was used, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2A. The square of the product of the absorption coefficient α and photon energy hν-(αhν)2 is plotted versus photon energy. The fitted dashed line and the X-axis intersection give the corresponding optical bandgap of 4.2 eV. The large wide-bandgap feature provides potential applications for nonlinear optical applications in the UV to the visible region.

The quasi-1D crystal motif leads to intrinsic optical anisotropy. Subsequently, optical anisotropy was investigated in the transparent region of crystals. Intrinsic in-plane anisotropy in the crystal could be confirmed by the in-plane birefringence measurement at different wavelengths of 450 nm, 532 nm, and 633 nm for the cross-polarized configuration (the polarization of incidence and detection are perpendicular to each other) as shown in Fig. 2B. Four maxima and four minima could be observed, and the data points are fitted with a sin2(2θ) function, where θ is the incident polarization angle.
Second-harmonic generation
The hydrogen-bond interaction distorts the octahedral units of [PbBr5]∞ and breaks the crystal symmetry. We expect that wide-bandgap PEA3PbBr5·H2O is a potential material to produce an efficient second-order optical response. The nonlinear polarization P of materials induced by the external applied optical field E can be expressed as39 P = ε0(χ(1)E + χ(2)E2 + χ(3)E3 +⋯+ χ(n)En +⋯)(1)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and χ(n) is the nth-order optical susceptibility. Notably, only the linear term ε0χ(1)E corresponding to linear absorption and refraction is of concern under moderate electric field irradiation. Nevertheless, the high-order term ε0χ(n)En of nonlinear polarization (P) becomes non-negligible in the strong-field regime.
We proceed to explore the properties of second-harmonic generation in the crystals. Fig. 3A illustrates the diagram of the optical setup for the second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurement. A lens with a 100 mm focal length was used to focus the fundamental frequency laser on the crystal. The transmitted NLO signal was collected using a lens of 24 mm focal length. Fig. 3B presents the spectrum of the NLO response of the single crystal under excitation of a 900 nm femtosecond pulsed laser. A sharp (FWHM = 3.6 nm) peak at 450 nm and a broader fluorescence signal (FWHM = 20.5 nm) at a higher wavelength centered at 545 nm are observed. The sharp peak at 450 nm could be attributed to SHG. It is worth noting that the green PL is not supposed to exist in the presence of the organic cation phenethylammonium (PEA). The origin of the anomalous green broad emission will be discussed in the next section. Fig. 3C presents the wavelength-dependent SHG spectra measured by tuning the excitation wavelength from 780 to 1040 nm with a step of 20 nm, showing sharp peaks at second harmonic wavelengths in the range of 390–520 nm. The relative SHG efficiency was calculated using the equation ηSHG = PSHG/Plaser2 as shown in Fig. 3D, where PSHG is the measured power of the transmitted second harmonic signal and Plaser is the incident power. We find that the conversion efficiency is the highest when the sample is under the excitation of a 900 nm femtosecond pulsed laser. The exciton resonance enhancement may be a possible reason for this phenomenon, as observed in previous studies.40,41 However, this explanation is not appropriate for our case, because the excitonic absorption peak centered at 325 nm, as shown in Fig. 2A, is far from the conversion efficiency maximum (450 nm). The excitonic absorption is not responsible for this high conversion efficiency.38 Power-dependent SHG intensity excited at three representative wavelengths of 800 nm, 900 nm, and 1000 nm was measured as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). A noticeable interference effect due to the large thickness of the bulk crystal can be observed in the spectra. The power-dependent SHG intensity in Fig. 3E confirms the characteristic square-dependence of a second-order NLO effect. Fig. 3F and Fig. S5 (ESI†) present the polarization dependence of SHG intensity, verifying the polarization nature of the SHG signal transmitted through the crystal. The SHG intensity remains almost constant (SHG anisotropy ratio ∼1.64) under different excitation polarization angles by tuning a λ/2 waveplate (Fig. S5, ESI†), consistent with previous reports.42 Considering a co-polarized configuration (the polarization of incidence and detection are kept parallel to each other by rotating the λ/2 waveplate and analyzer simultaneously), the SHG intensity shows a linear dependence on the polarization angle with a SHG anisotropy ratio of up to 29.8 and a polarization ratio of 94% (Fig. 3F), where the SHG anisotropy ratio is calculated as the ratio of the maximum SHG intensity to the minimum one. The anisotropy ratio approaches to 30, demonstrating the excellent NLO performance of the PEA3PbBr5·H2O single-crystal. Furthermore, the absolute second-order NLO coefficient was estimated to be 0.1 pm V−1, about 1/4 times that of the commercial crystal KH2PO4 (KDP). Comparison of the reported second-order nonlinear behavior of lead halide perovskites can be found in Table S2 (ESI†).

Two-photon photoluminescence

Fig. 4A shows the power dependence of SHG and broad emission spectra (centered at 545 nm) of a single-crystal excited by a 900 nm femtosecond pulsed laser. As the incident power density increases from 7 mW to 57.1 mW, the intensity of both SHG and broad emission increases monotonously. Yet, the increasing trend of the broad emission is significantly faster. The logarithmic diagrams of the power-dependent broad emission intensity and the corresponding linear fitting results are shown in Fig. 4B. Surprisingly, the slope is 3.59 for this broad emission. Therefore, the origin of in-gap defects can be excluded. In addition, we replaced the 900 nm femtosecond pulsed laser with an 800 nm femtosecond pulsed laser. The power-dependent broad emission spectra of a single crystal and the corresponding logarithmic diagrams and fitting results are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The linear fitted slope in Fig. S6B (ESI†) rigorously approaches 4 (also larger than 2). We listed several possible explanations as follows: (1) higher-order NLLO effect such as four-photon absorption; (2) lasing or amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) behavior; and (3) the photoluminescence produced by the recombination of free carriers under two-photon excitation. Firstly, the higher-order NLO process could be excluded since the two-photon absorption (third-order NLO effect) means to be more dominant. Secondly, the full width at half maximum (FWHM)43 of the PL spectra remains almost constant as the power varies (see Fig. S7, ESI†), which means lasing or amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) behavior could be excluded. Explanation (3) is most likely responsible for this broad emission because the slope for the power-dependent free carrier recombination is two, which will be four under two-photon excitation.

(D) Polar plot of TPPL intensity as a function of the excitation polarization angle θ for a co-polarized configuration (the polarization of incidence and detection are parallel to each other). The data points are fitted with a cos2(2θ) function. 
The relative TPPL efficiency was calculated from the wavelength-dependent TPPL spectra (Fig. S8, ESI†) using the equation ηTPPL = PTPPL/Plaser4, as shown in Fig. 4C, where PTPPL is the measured power of the transmitted two-photon photoluminescence signal and Plaser is the incident power. Fig. 4D presents the polarization-dependent broadband emission intensity, verifying that the broad emission is highly polarized. The measured polarization degree is 89%.

Fig. 5A shows the power dependence of the green PL spectra of a PEA3PbBr5·H2O single-crystal excited by a 488 nm continuous wave (CW) laser. The logarithmic diagrams of the power-dependent PL intensity and the corresponding linear fitting results are shown in Fig. 5B. The measured slope is 2, implying that the emission is not from the defect. The excitation power-dependent PL dynamics of the broad emission (Fig. 5C and Fig. S9, ESI†) were further investigated under the excitation of a 400 nm femtosecond pulsed laser. As the excitation power increases, the PL tends to decay faster, which could be attributed to the domination of fast decay channels such as the Auger combination. The dynamics of charge-carrier recombination through different processes could be derived from the rate equation, which can be written as44 (2)where nfc is the photoexcited free carrier concentration, G is the generation rate of free carriers, A is a coefficient related to the nonradiative recombination of a free carrier on a defect, B is the radiative recombination constant related to the spontaneous emission of free carriers, and C is the Auger recombination coefficient of free carriers. The trap-assisted recombination rates A (9.2 × 107 s−1) and radiative recombination rates B (3.4 × 10−10 cm3 s−1) are obtained by fitting the curves from low-fluence with the rate equation (eqn 2), where the parameter C is negligible. A global fit to the kinetic model based on a single free parameter C is implemented using the curves at high fluence. An Auger recombination rate of C = 1.5 × 10−28 cm6 s−1 was extracted. Table 1 summarizes the recombination constants in this work and their comparison with the values for MAPbI3,45 FAPbI3,46 and FAPbBr3.46 As listed in Table 1, the trap-assisted recombination rate A obtained here is higher than the typical values reported, which could be attributed to the high defect density. The values of radiative (B) and Auger (C) recombination constants are fairly similar to those of other hybrid metal halide perovskites.

We have performed a photoluminescence measurement under wide-field blue LED illumination and observed green spots in the inside of the crystal, as shown in Fig. 5D. In a spatial area of approximately 100 microns by 100 microns, randomly scattered green light emitters could be observed as highlighted by the white circle. The green photoluminescence could be further observed under UV (330–380 nm) LED illumination as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Fig S11 (ESI†) shows the photographs of the single crystal surface and interior, where some impurity-like substances could be observed. These observations suggest that the photoluminescence under two-photon excitation and single-photon excitation is from crystal-incorporated matter. The photoluminescence is repeatable from different batches of the crystal. However, the nature of this matter is still unclear at present. We speculate that a novel perovskite forms inside the PEA3PbBr5·H2O single crystal, which needs further investigation.
Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the second-order and third-order nonlinear effects of a quasi-1D hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP), PEA3PbBr5·H2O, which possesses a wide bandgap of 4.2 eV. We explored the second-order NLO performance (SHG) of the single crystal through power-, wavelength-, and polarization-dependent experiments. A high polarization ratio of up to 94% was observed. Further, we observed anomalous green PL emitted by crystal-incorporated matter. Subsequently, the origin and the time-resolved photoluminescence dynamics of the anomalous green PL were investigated with the help of single-photon excitation, photoluminescence imaging, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). We envisage that the results in this study demonstrate the excellent NLO performances of the one-dimensional (1D) hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites represented by the PEA3PbBr5·H2O single-crystal. Therefore, such superior functional materials could provide a promising platform for low-cost, high-performance nonlinear optical devices such as electro-optic (EO) modulation and ultrafast optical switching.
