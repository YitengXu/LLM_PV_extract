    , Accepted 6th August 2019First published on 22nd August 2019AbstractPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted much attention as a useful technique for disease therapy, considering its minimum invasiveness, high spatial-temporal control, and specific lesion destruction. However, the limited generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) in PDT has restricted the practical biomedical applications of photosensitizers. To overcome this issue, we first developed iron nanoparticles as an Fe nanotemplate to synthesize iron germanium nanoalloy coated iron nanoparticles (Fe@Fe3Ge2 NPs), which possess strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption, as a highly stable photosensitizer and to generate 1O2 effectively under irradiation by an 808 nm laser for NIR-PDT via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Taking advantage of the strong magnetic properties of the Fe nanotemplates and the effective generation of 1O2 by Fe3Ge2 nanoshells, Fe@Fe3Ge2 NPs could be applicable for efficient targeted magnetic resonance imaging-guided NIR-PDT in an αvβ3-positive U87MG glioblastoma model. This work marks an important step forward in developing a novel nanoparticulated theranostic agent for accurate clinical cancer theranostics in the future.
Introduction
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was proposed as a useful tool in oncology, benefiting from its minimum invasiveness, high spatial-temporal control, and specific lesion destruction.1–3 In a typical PDT process, a photosensitizer (PS) is activated under illumination to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS causes the oxidative destruction of pathological tissue.4 Fabricating PSs excited by NIR light (700–1100 nm) for PDT is a flourishing research field.5–7 They have deep tissue penetration and are less harmful to the tissues.8,9 However, the use of NIR-PSs for in vivo PDT cancer treatment remains challenging because it has some limitations. For instance, the widely used organic NIR-PSs generally exhibit poor water solubility, weak photo-stability, and short circulation time.10,11 These drawbacks were to some extent overcome by payloading organic NIR-PSs into silica, polymer, or liposome-based carriers.12,13 However, the slow degradation of nanoparticles (NPs) and the gradual leakage of PSs result in uneven biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. Alternatively, inorganic NIR-PSs with their intrinsic generation of 1O2 by an NIR laser could address the above issues. So far, oxygen-vacancy inorganic NIR-PSs, such as WO3−x, Cu2−xS, and TiO2−x, have been developed for NIR-PDT,14–18 but they are not stable enough, especially in the tumor microenvironment with an excessive amount of hydrogen peroxide (100 μM to 1 mM).19,20 The development of inorganic NIR-PSs is highly desirable for NIR-PDT.
Inorganic semiconductor nanomaterials have been widely used in energy conversion, chemical sensing, biomedical imaging and therapy due to their special properties, such as their excellent electron conduction ability and broadband light response.21–24 Among inorganic semiconductor nanomaterials, group IV-based ferromagnetic-semiconductors, such as Si- and Ge-based ferromagnetic semiconductors, have attracted a lot of attention over the last decade. For example, β-phase FeSi NPs were applied for the fabrication of flexible solar cells due to their high absorption in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region.25,26 Similar to FeSi NPs, iron germanium nanoalloys also possess diverse compositions and structures that may lead to versatile attractive properties.27–29 These properties could be tuned for biomedical applications, especially their unique combination of NIR absorption ability with an intrinsic semiconducting nature. This makes them promising as a novel type of NIR-PSs for deep tissue in vivo PDT. Most importantly, there has been no report exploring the applications of iron germanium nanoalloys in the biomedical field.
In this paper, we developed an iron germanide nanoalloy (Fe3Ge2) as an NIR-PS for PDT. The synthesized Fe3Ge2 possessed strong absorption in the NIR range. Under irradiation by an 808 nm laser, Fe3Ge2 served as an NIR-PS and generated 1O2. In addition, considering the small saturation magnetization value of Fe3Ge2 NPs and the excellent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) property of Fe-based nanomaterials,30–33 we used iron nanoparticles with a strong magnetic property as a template (Fe nanotemplate) to synthesize Fe@Fe3Ge2 core–shell NPs for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided NIR-PDT (Scheme 1).

Experimental section
Synthesis of Fe@Fe3Ge2 (MNPs) and Fe3Ge2 NPs
Germanium(IV) iodide (120 mg) and hexadecylammonium chloride (30 mg, 0.1 mmol) were added to a mixture of oleylamine (20 mL) and oleic acid (1.5 mL) in a three-neck flask. The mixed solvents were kept constant in a vacuum for 1 h and stirred vigorously for 30 min after the temperature was increased to °C. Then the solution was degassed in a nitrogen atmosphere with vigorous stirring for 30 min at 120 °C. Next, the mixed solvents were cooled to 80 °C and hexamethyldisilazane (2 mL) was added. Iron pentacarbonyl (90 μL, 0.64 mmol) was added after the temperature of the mixed solvents had been increased to 220 °C, and reacted for 30 min. Then more iron pentacarbonyl (30 μL, 0.21 mmol) was added into the mixed solvents after the temperature of the solution had been increased to 260 °C and was kept under stirring for another 30 min. Finally, the supernatant was decanted after the reaction mixed solvents had cooled down. The obtained NPs were washed with ethanol and chloroform (v/v, 1:1) three times. The purified Fe@Fe3Ge2 NPs (MNPs) were dispersed in chloroform for further applications. Fe3Ge2 NPs were synthesized by a similar method except that iron pentacarbonyl (30 μL, 0.21 mmol) was only added at 260 °C.
Synthesis of PEG-MNPs, RGD-MNPs, and PEG-Fe3Ge2 NPs
After MNPs (5 mg) and DSPE-PEG2000 (20 mg) had been shaken overnight, the chloroform was evaporated by a rotary device. Next, distilled water (5 mL) was added. After dialysis for 2 days, PEG-MNPs were obtained. PEG-Fe3Ge2 NPs were synthesized by a similar procedure to PEG-MNPs except that Fe3Ge2 NPs were used. RGD-MNPs were synthesized according to our previous procudure.34

T
2-Weighted MRI in vitro
MCF-7 and U87MG cells were incubated with the same concentrations of RGD-MNPs and PEG-MNPs (100 μg mL−1) for 2 h, respectively. All MR imaging of the cells was performed on an NM120-Analyst instrument.
The evaluation of the generation of 1O2in vitro
U87MG cells were put into plates and incubated for 24 h, then those cells were incubated with PEG-MNP or RGD-MNP solutions (200 μg mL−1) for 4 h. Excess nanoparticles were washed off with PBS, and the cells were incubated with SOSG (1 mM) for 2 h. Finally, the cells were suspended in 2 mL PBS buffer after irradiation with the laser, and followed by flow cytometry analysis.
Photodynamic therapy in vitro
U87MG cells (3.0 × 105 cells per mL) were added to a 96-well plate for 24 h. Then PEG-MNPs or RGD-MNPs of different concentrations were added to the 96-well plate, and incubated for 4 h. Finally, at an ambient temperature of 37 °C, the photo toxicity was estimated by MTT assay after 808 nm irradiation. The same procedure was performed at 4 °C.
Western blot analysis
The experimental cells were assigned to four groups: blank (U87MG cells only); RGD-MNPs (the concentration of RGD-MNPs was 100 μg mL−1); Laser (U87MG cells were irradiated by the 808 nm laser, 1.27 W cm−2, 10 min); and RGD-MNPs + Laser (after incubation with RGD-MNPs, U87MG cells were irradiated by the laser under the same conditions). Finally, all the U87MG cells of the groups were incubated with lysis buffer, and a BCA protein assay kit was used to measure the concentrations of six proteins.35
Tumor model
Balb/c mice were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. All of the animals were lawfully acquired and their retention and use were in every case in compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations, and in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of SLAC (IACUC) Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. U87MG cells (1 × 106 cells per mL) were implanted subcutaneously into the Balb/c nude mice, and the tumor size was measured daily.
MR imaging in vivo
The experimental animals were assigned to two groups: the Targeted group (injected with RGD-MNPs into the caudal vein, 40 mg kg−1) and the Blocking group (after injection with free RGD 2.5 mg kg−1, the U87MG tumor-bearing mice were injected with 40 mg kg−1). The mice with tumors were injected with 40 mg kg−1. The mice were imaged for different times on a 3 T MR imaging system.
Photothermal imaging of tumors in vivo
U87MG tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to 2 groups: a Saline group (after injection with saline, the mice were irradiated with the laser) and an RGD-MNPs group (after injection with RGD-MNPs, 40 mg kg−1, the mice were irradiated with the laser). The temperature of the tumor was monitored with an IR thermal camera.
Photodynamic therapy in vivo
U87MG tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 4), after the size of tumor had reached ∼60 mm3: Saline group: the mice were injected with normal saline into the caudal vein; RGD-MNPs group: the mice were injected with RGD-MNPs into the caudal vein; Laser group: after injection with saline, the mice were irradiated with the 808 nm laser; and RGD-MNPs + Laser group: after injection with RGD-MNPs into the caudal vein, the mice were irradiated with the 808 nm laser. The dose of RGD-MNPs was 40 mg kg−1. The 808 nm laser irradiation power intensity and time were 0.5 W cm−2 and 10 min, respectively. The mice were injected with RGD-MNPs after 20 min i.v, four times every other 48 h. The photodynamic therapy effect was investigated for 16 days. The equation used to calculate the tumor volumes was length × (width)2 × 0.5.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of Fe@Fe3Ge2 NPs
Fe@Fe3Ge2 NPs (MNPs) were synthesized using Fe NPs as nanotemplates by a pyrolysis method.36 Firstly, Fe nanotemplates were preferentially formed by thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl at a temperature of 220 °C. Afterwards, nanoshells on the surface of the Fe nanotemplates were produced in the presence of iron pentacarbonyl and germanium(IV) iodide in mixed solvents of oleic acid and oleylamine at a temperature of 260 °C. The core/shell MNPs with an average diameter of 10.9 ± 0.7 nm were confirmed by TEM (Fig. 1a and ESI,† Fig. S1a), in which the diameter of the Fe nanotemplate was 6.7 ± 0.8 nm. The XRD pattern of the MNPs showed typical Fe(110) and Fe3Ge2(102)/(110) diffraction peaks (Fig. 1b).34 For the nanoshells, multiple crystalline domains with lattice spacings matching those of Fe3Ge2 were observed. The SAED pattern was consistent with an Ni2In-type Fe3Ge2 phase (ESI,† Fig. S1b).37 Under similar conditions without Fe nanotemplates, Fe3Ge2 NPs were synthesized for the following comparisons. Their XRD pattern also showed typical (110) and (102) diffraction peaks (ESI,† Fig. S2). As presented in the magnetic hysteresis loop (Fig. 1c), the saturation magnetization of Fe3Ge2 NPs was 4.0 emu g−1 at 15 kOe (ESI,† Fig. S3), while the MNPs which displayed a ferromagnetic behaviour had a much larger saturation magnetization value of ∼53.3 emu g−1 under the same conditions. In order to achieve the water solubility of MNPs, MNPs were decorated with PEG-phospholipids (PEG-MNPs) (ESI,† Fig. S4a). The hydrodynamic diameter (HD) and zeta potential of the PEG-MNPs were ∼44.5 nm and ∼−29.3 mV, respectively (ESI,† Fig. S4b and c). The large negative charge effectively prevented the aggregation of PEG-MNPs. Furthermore, PEG-MNPs showed excellent colloidal stability in DMEM with 10% FBS, which provided an advantage for further investigation in the biological system (ESI,† Fig. S5). Owing to their magnetic property, a concentration-dependent negative contrast was observed from T2-weighted MR imaging (0.5 T). The transverse relaxivity (r2) was calculated to be ∼135.8/(mM s), which demonstrated their potential application for T2-weighted MR imaging (Fig. 1d).

The evaluation of the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) in an aqueous solution
The absorption in the NIR region by the PEG-MNPs encouraged us to investigate their NIR-driven phototherapy (ESI,† Fig. S6). To our surprise, the fluorescence intensity of ABDA which could indicate 1O2 in PEG-MNPs gradually decreased after irradiation with the 808 nm laser in air atmosphere, which indicated the generation of 1O2.38 In order to further confirm the generation of 1O2, the evaluation of 1O2 under other conditions was investigated. Comparing the fluorescence intensity of ABDA under O2 or N2 conditions, the fluorescence intensity under the O2 condition decreased obviously under irradiation by the 808 nm laser, but the fluorescence intensity under the N2 condition showed little significant change under the same conditions (ESI,† Fig. S7). The oxygen dependent character clearly indicated that the active species for PEG-MNP oxidation under 808 nm laser irradiation could be related to the activation of the O2.39 Secondly, a typical 1O2 scavenger,40,41 NaN3, was employed in an aqueous solution of PEG-MNPs, and a negligible change was observed for the fluorescence intensity of ABDA even after irradiation for 30 min. The results showed that 1O2 was hardly produced due to the inhibiting function of NaN3 (Fig. 2a and ESI,† Fig. S8). As a control, the generation of 1O2 by Fe@Fe3O4 and Fe3Ge2 NPs was studied under the same conditions. In the presence of Fe@Fe3O4 NPs, the fluorescence intensity of ABDA showed little significant change, which indicated that there was no connection between the generation of 1O2 and Fe@Fe3O4 NPs (Fig. 2b and ESI,† Fig. S9). To explore the mechanism of the generation of 1O2, other excitation wavelengths (660, 730, and 980 nm) were used to irradiate the Fe@Fe3O4 NPs to monitor the change in the fluorescence intensity of ABDA (Fig. 2c and ESI,† Fig. S10–S13). No obvious generation of 1O2 was observed after irradiation by the 660 or 980 nm laser. Though PEG-MNPs could generate 1O2 under 730 nm laser irradiation, the amount of 1O2 was only ∼59% compared to that generated by PEG-MNPs under 808 nm laser irradiation. The PEG-Fe3Ge2 NPs could also present similar behavior in the generation of 1O2 under 660, 730, 808 and 980 nm laser irradiation (ESI,† Fig. S14–S17), which suggested that Fe3Ge2 nanoshells could be responsible for the generation of 1O2. Furthermore, among the above four wavelengths, 808 nm laser excitation for PEG-MNPs is best for the generation of 1O2, which is perhaps due to the best match between the energy of the Fe3Ge2 nanoshells and an 808 nm laser. Under the condition that the Fe3Ge2 nanoshell was excited from the ground state to the excited state by an 808 nm laser, the excited state of the Fe3Ge2 nanoshell activated the molecular oxygen (3O2) to generate 1O2 by the energy transfer mechanism (Fig. 2d).42–44

The power density of the laser was 1.27 W cm−2. 
MR imaging and photodynamic effects in vitro
RGD peptide can specifically recognize the integrin αvβ3 protein.45,46 To further investigate the targeting property of MNPs, RGD-modified Fe@Fe3Ge2 NPs (RGD-MNPs) were obtained according to our previous method.34 Their hydrodynamic diameter (HD) and zeta potential were ∼70.7 nm and ∼−20.1 mV, respectively (ESI,† Fig. S4). To show the active targeting ability of RGD-MNPs by MR imaging, RGD-MNPs were incubated with two types of cancer cells. One type was U87MG cells which had a lot of integrin αvβ3 protein on the surface which could be specifically recognized by RGD-MNPs. The other was MCF-7 cells which did not have this capability. As shown in Fig. 3, the T2 signal ratio value of U87MG cells after incubation with RGD-MNPs was ∼1.8 times higher than that of MCF-7 cells. The T2 signal ratio value of U87MG cells after incubation with RGD-MNPs was ∼1.5 times that of the U87MG cells after incubation with PEG-MNPs. RGD peptide could specifically recognize the U87MG cells with clear differences in the T2 signal ratio value.47 The experimental result with the Blocking group revealed that the T2 signal ratio value of U87MG cells after incubation with RGD-MNPs was ∼4.4 times that of the T2 signal ratio value of U87MG cells after pre-incubation with RGD. All the experimental results indicate that RGD-MNPs had an excellent active targeting ability for U87MG cells.48
 Fig. 3  The ΔT2/T2 value and corresponding T2-weighted MR images of U87MG and MCF-7 cells incubated with RGD-MNPs and PEG-MNPs at 37 °C, respectively. Only MCF-7: blank MCF-7 cells; Only U87MG: blank U87MG cells; free RGD + U87MG(+): U87MG cells pre-incubated with RGD (50 μg mL−1) for 30 min followed by incubation with RGD-MNPs; MCF-7(+): MCF-7 cells incubated with RGD-MNPs; U87MG(−): U87MG cells incubated with PEG-MNPs; U87MG(+): U87MG cells incubated with RGD-MNPs. The nanoparticle incubation concentration and time were 100 μg mL−1 and 2 h, respectively. 
In order to further investigate the photodestruction capability of RGD-MNPs, we irradiated U87MG cells with the laser after incubation with RGD-MNPs at 37 °C. According to Fig. 4a, when the concentration of RGD-MNPs was changed from 20 to 200 μg mL−1, the cellular death ratio correspondingly increased from ∼25.6 to ∼52%. To eliminate the contribution of the photothermal effect to cellular death, the U87MG cells were irradiated under the same conditions after the incubation with RGD-MNPs at 4 °C. The cellular death ratio showed no obvious difference from that at 37 °C with the same concentration, demonstrating that the PDT effect was mainly responsible for the observed cellular death after irradiation by the 808 nm laser under our experimental conditions. In order to further confirm the generation of 1O2 in U87MG cells, U87MG cells were incubated with SOSG (a typical 1O2 indicator, 1 μM) and RGD-MNPs (200 μg mL−1). According to Fig. 4b, a strong fluorescence enhancement was detected in U87MG cells incubated with RGD-MNPs and SOSG after irradiation with an 808 nm laser, indicating that 808 nm laser irradiation could effectively generate the singlet oxygen inside the U87MG cells.

(e) A schematic diagram of the mechanism of the signal pathway of apoptosis induced by RGD-MNPs and 808 nm laser irradiation. Blank: U87MG cells only; RGD-MNPs: U87MG cells treated with RGD-MNPs (100 μg mL−1) only; Laser: U87MG cells exposed to 808 nm laser irradiation only; RGD-MNPs + Laser: U87MG cells incubated with RGD-MNPs (100 μg mL−1) and then exposed to 808 nm laser irradiation. The laser irradiation power density and time were 1.27 W cm−2 and 10 min, respectively. 
To explore the possible mechanism of NIR-PDT, the expression level of regulators related to the apoptotic pathway was measured. In response to the cellular damage, p53 is one of the most important factors in monitoring genomic instability. As can be seen from Fig. 4c and d, the amount of p53 phosphorylation in the RGD-MNPs + Laser group was the largest, and it increased to 278.6 ± 30.1 compared with the blank group (100 ± 11.6), the RGD-MNPs group (198.7 ± 9.3) and the Laser group (221.0 ± 11.3). While the expression of bax and Cyt c showed a similar trend to p53, the expression of bcl-2 was the reverse. The ratio of bcl-2 to bax in the RGD-MNPs + Laser group was ∼0.2. However, the ratios in the RGD-MNPs group and the Laser group were both ∼0.8, which resulted in significant activation of a family of intracellular cysteine proteases known as caspases, followed by induction of apoptosis.49 Caspase-3, which contributes to a cell's commitment to undergo apoptosis, was also assessed. The relative value of caspase 3 in the RGD-MNPs group was 169.5 ± 29.4, but it was 171.0 ± 27.8 in the Laser group and 326.4 ± 83.9 in the RGD-MNPs + Laser group, which suggested that apoptosis was the main pathway of cell death for NIR-PDT in vitro. According to the above results, the apoptotic signal pathway by RGD-MNPs is shown in Fig. 4e. The singlet oxygen was firstly induced in the cells after treatment by RGD-MNPs and an 808 nm laser, then p53 activation was followed by an up-regulation in bax and Cyt c and a decrease in bcl-2, finally leading to apoptosis. All these above results demonstrated that it was a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway for NIR-PDT.

MR imaging in vivo. 
Encouraged by the excellent T2 relaxation property of RGD-MNPs, T2-weighted targeting MR imaging (3.0 T) was obtained in a U87MG xenograft model after the i.v. of RGD-MNPs (40 mg kg−1). As shown in Fig. 5a, the T2 MR signal showed stronger enhancement in the Targeted group than in the Blocking group. The relative MR signal intensity (the ratio of the MR signal in a tumor to that in air) was quantitatively analyzed by ImageJ. After i.v for 10 min, the relative MR signal intensity in the Targeting group was reduced by ∼46%. However, for the Blocking group, it merely decreased by ∼30%. Correspondingly, RGD-MNPs were firstly delivered to the tumor, and then immediately anchored to the surface of the U87MG cells because of the binding of RGD and integrin αvβ3 protein, which was far more efficient than the EPR effect. Afterwards, the relative MR signal intensity showed an upward trend during the period of our experimental range (Fig. 5b) perhaps contributing to the metabolism of RGD-MNPs in the tumor. All the results demonstrated the considerable aggregation of RGD-MNPs in U87MG tumors, because of the active targeting property of the nanoparticles, which showed the good correlation with the MR contrast enhancement in vitro.

MR imaging guided photodynamic therapy in vivo
Considering the excellent photodynamic effect under the conditions of 808 nm laser irradiation and the good targeting property for U87MG cells by RGD-MNPs in vitro, PDT was performed under the guidance of MR imaging in vivo.50,51 All the mice with tumors were randomly divided into four groups: Saline group, RGD-MNPs group, Laser group and RGD-MNPs + Laser group. As shown in Fig. 5c and ESI,† Fig. S18, the experimental results revealed that the tumors of the RGD-MNPs + Laser group were effectively inhibited relative to other groups. Comparing the experimental groups, the relative tumor volumes of the groups were all ∼15 times larger than that before treatment. Although the tumors of the RGD-MNPs + Laser group were not totally eliminated, the growth was obviously inhibited compared with the other control groups, and were only ∼7 times larger than before the treatment. From the collected photographs of the mice in all groups (Fig. 5d), the tumor size of the RGD-MNPs + Laser group showed obvious inhibition due to an effective NIR-PDT as expected. Further investigation of the temperature of the tumors was achieved by monitoring the mice by an IR thermal camera. The temperature of the tumors rose by only ∼2.2 °C during the 10 min (ESI,† Fig. S19), indicating the negligible photothermal therapy effect. After NIR-PDT, no obvious body weight loss or abnormal behavior were detected for each group, which suggested the low poisonous effects of the therapy (ESI,† Fig. S20). Comparing the TUNEL staining of experimental group to the other control groups (Fig. 5e), the tumor cells of the experimental group were diffusely stained brown. According to Fig. 5f, 35.5 ± 1.4% and 36.4 ± 0.9% tumor cells were stained in the RGD-MNPs group and the Laser group, respectively. However, 57.4 ± 0.9% tumor cells were stained in the RGD-MNPs + Laser group, which showed a remarkable treatment effect in such a short treatment time. The immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded tumor sections (HO-1 staining) is shown in Fig. 5e. As shown in Fig. 5g, HO-1 staining tumor cells were ∼1.5-fold higher in the RGD-MNPs + Laser group than in the control groups. All this evidence strongly revealed that RGD-MNPs possessed a potential reagent for high-efficiency targeted PDT.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have for the first time developed an Fe nanotemplate to synthesize Fe@Fe3Ge2 core/shell NPs as an efficient photosensitizer for the generation of 1O2 under NIR laser irradiation. NIR driven 1O2 generation, which resulted from the Fe3Ge2 nanoshells, was clearly proven by ABDA fluorescence assays and corresponding inhibition experiments. The strong magnetic properties of the Fe nanotemplates in the Fe@Fe3Ge2 NPs made them suitable for MR imaging. Further investigation in vitro and in vivo showed that Fe@Fe3Ge2 NPs exhibit notable cell/tumor growth inhibition under irradiation by NIR. The advantage of Fe@Fe3Ge2 NPs for NIR-PDT would provide the possibility for deep tumor therapy. We hold the opinion that this study can provide new insight into the wider investigation of nanoalloys and their future clinical transformation.
