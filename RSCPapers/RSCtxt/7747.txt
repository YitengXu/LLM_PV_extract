    , Accepted 28th February 2012First published on 29th February 2012AbstractA series of ordered photoanodic architectures (including ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNT), ZnO nanorods, ZnO/TiO2 core/shell nanostructures) for CdS/CdSe sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), were fabricated directly on transparent conductive oxide glasses by a facile sol–gel assisted template process. The morphologies, optical and electrical properties of TNTs and CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TNTs have been demonstrated. The effect of CdSe deposition time on the cell performance was clarified, and the growth mechanism of the CdSe quantum dots on the surface of the TNTs has been proposed as well. Furthermore, the evolution of open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) towards CdSe deposition time has been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A promising light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of up to 4.61% has been achieved with 3 μm long TNT arrays, which is the best record for sandwich-type ordered TNT-based QDSCs.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have received extensive research interest in recent years since inorganic narrow-band-gap quantum dots (QDs) exhibit significant advantages over conventional organic dyes and Ru-based dyes, such as an extremely high molar extinction coefficient, size-dependent bandgaps, good photostability and low cost etc.1–4 More importantly, their capability to harvest hot electrons and generate multiple electron–hole pairs per photon offers a new opportunity to achieve highly efficient, cost-effective QD solar cells. Therefore, the thermodynamic efficiency of QD solar cells was theoretically estimated to be as high as 44%.5,6 However, in spite of these potential advantages, the conversion efficiency of QDSCs has only reached 5% so far, unsatisfactory in comparison to conventional dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs).7–9 In fact for QDSCs, some physical and chemical processes concerning photogenerated carrier separation, transport, and interfacial transfer, hole scavenging, undesirable recombination reactions etc., have not been well clarified, while counter electrode materials and QDSCs configuration have not yet been optimized. At present, strategies to improve the cell performance of QDSCs have been focusing on how to improve the light harvesting ability of QDs on the photoanode, the collection efficiency of photogenerated electrons, and the catalytic ability of the counter electrode, as well as how to restrain recombination reactions.
Among the crucial materials of QDSCs, the photoanode (typically TiO2) is the core of the QDSCs, which is in close contact with QDs and the redox electrolyte. For highly efficient QDSCs, the fabrication of the TiO2 photoanodes needs to fully consider the properties of QDs as well as various surface modification methods of QDs. Unlike conventional dyes chemically grafted to the TiO2 surface, highly effective QD coverage on the TiO2 mesoporous film surface and thus relatively good photovoltaic performance are generally obtained by in situ QDs growth methods (i.e. chemical bath deposition (CBD) and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR)).10 However, inner-pores in routine photoanodes are easily blocked while depositing QDs, since the size of QDs ranging from 2 to 8 nm is much larger than that of conventional dyes.2,11,12 Accordingly, an ideal TiO2 photoanode for QDSCs should have (i) suitable pore size to avoid being blocked during the QDs deposition; (ii) enough surface area for efficient QDs deposition; (iii) ideal electron transport property for high electron collection efficiency.
The TiO2 nanoparticle (NP)-based photoanode is usually adopted in QDSCs, consisting of an optical transparent film with a large surface for QD loading and a scattering film to enhance the light absorption.7 However, its disadvantages, such as relatively low porosity and structural disorder, will bring a high probability of recombination, thus leading to a relatively low Voc and fill factor (FF). In this regard, some ordered nanoscale architectures have been attempted for QDSCs, i.e. one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures (rods, tubes, wires and fibers) and TiO2 inverse opal structure etc. These ordered and well interconnected photoanodic architectures may favor the infiltration of both QDs and the electrolyte throughout the whole TiO2 matrix, improve the electron transportation, and suppress the recombination up to photovoltaic performance. Toyoda et al. fabricated CdSe sensitized solar cells with TiO2 inverse opal structure and obtained an efficiency of 2.7% with a higher Voc of 710 mV.13 Yong et al. also reported an efficiency of 4.15% for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells with ZnO nanowire arrays.14 Especially, highly ordered and vertically oriented TNT arrays exhibit potential applications due to their good chemical and thermal stability and easy surface modification.15,16 When an anodized TNT array photoanode is employed in QDSCs, however, backside illumination has to be adopted, which significantly limits direct applications of opaque counter electrodes with high catalytic activity towards polysulfide electrolytes (i.e. Cu2S,17,18 PbS,19 CoS,20 and carbon12,21), so far with little success in achieving high photovoltaic performance.22–25 Some methods have been developed to overcome this problem, for example, the TNT transferring technique from Ti foil onto F-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO) to obtain front-illuminated QDSCs, or designing a novel fibrous configuration with CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TNT on Ti wire evolved a highly active Cu2S electrode, but only 3.2% efficiency was reported.26,27 Therefore, different approaches to obtain TNT directly grown on FTO glass are urgently needed in order to further improve the performance of TNT-based QDSCs.28,29
A template mediated method has been proven to be a versatile way to obtain TNT arrays with the aid of porous anodic alumina (PAA) membranes or ZnO nanorod arrays, due to its minimal equipment requirements, low cost, high reproducibility and good potential for scale-up.30–32 To our knowledge, this kind of template-assisted TNTs has not been applied in QDSCs. Herein, we fabricated QDSCs with a series of 3 μm thickness ordered photoanodes directly on FTO by a ZnO template method, the overall strategy is presented in Scheme 1. The growth process of CdSe QDs on CdS/TNT architecture was demonstrated in detail. A very promising overall cell performance of 4.61% has been achieved, which is the best record of TNT-based sandwich-type QDSCs so far. This kind of template-assisted TNT structure exhibits extraordinary potential applications in QDSCs in the future.

2. Experimental
Reagents and materials
Sodium nitrilotriacetate (N(CH2COONa)3, 98+%) and selenium powders (99.999%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemicals, CdCl2·2.5H2O (99+%), NH4Cl (99.5+%), CdSO4·8/3H2O (99+%), Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (99+%), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (99+%), Na2S·9H2O (98+%), Na2SO3 (97+%), thiourea (99+%), ammonia (25–28%), sulfur (99.5+%), hexamethylenetetramine (HMT, 99+%), tetrabutyltitanate (98+%) and diethanol amine (98+%) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Na2SeSO3 was synthesized by adding selenium powder (26 mM) into an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (67 mM) at 70 °C for 3 h.33 All the chemicals were used without further purification. The electrode substrate was fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO, thickness: 2.2 mm, Pilkington, sheet resistance 14 Ω square−1). Before use, the FTO glass was first washed with mild detergent, rinsed with distilled water several times and subsequently with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, then finally dried under an air stream.
Fabrication of ZnO nanorod arrays
ZnO nanorod arrays on FTO were synthesized with a two-step method by following a literature procedure.34 Firstly, a ZnO seed layer was deposited on FTO glass by immersing the FTO glass into 5 mM Zn(CH3COO)2 ethanol solution for 15 s, blowing dry with an air stream and repeating 5 times. Then ZnO nanoparticle-coated substrates were heated at 350 °C for 25 min. This ZnO seed layer depositing process was repeated once again in order to obtain a dense and transparent ZnO seed layer. Secondly, ZnO nanorods were grown by top-down suspending of the seeded substrates in aqueous solution containing 60 mM Zn(NO3)2 and 60 mM HMT, followed by sealing in an autoclave at 110 °C for 22 h. The ZnO arrays were rinsed with deionized water thoroughly, dried in air, and finally were heated to 400 °C at 2 °C min−1 for 1 h to remove the impurity.
Fabrication of TiO2 nanotube arrays
The TiO2-covered ZnO nanorod arrays were prepared by the dip-coating technique. The ZnO sample was first immersed into TiO2 sol (0.74 M tetrabutyltitanate and 0.58 M diethanol amine in ethanol) for 5 min, then withdrawn at a speed of 3 cm min−1.32 This process was repeated for 5 cycles. Subsequently, the films were annealed at 550 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 for 1 h. Finally, the hybrid TiO2/ZnO nanorod arrays were immersed in 0.1% HCl aqueous solution for 4 min in order to remove the ZnO templates and obtain TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs). Furthermore, in order to increase the surface area of the TiO2 photoanodes, TNT samples were soaked in 100 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 1 h at 70 °C and subsequently sintered at 550 °C for 1 h.
Fabrication of QDs on the photoanodes
The chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique was adopted for fabricating QDs on the photoanodes.35 First, CdS quantum dots were grown in situ on the photoanode with an aqueous solution of the mixture of 20 mM CdCl2, 66 mM NH4Cl, 140 mM thiourea and 230 mM ammonia for 75 min. After washing with deionized water completely, the CdS-coated TiO2 film was immersed into an aqueous solution with 26 mM CdSO4, 40 mM N(CH2COONa)3 and 26 mM Na2SeSO3 from 6 h to 18 h. All the QDs deposition was kept at 10 °C. Finally, CdS/CdSe co-sensitized photoanodes were passivated with ZnS by twice immersing alternately into 100 mM Zn(CH3COO)2 and Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min. For TEM characterization, CdSe was directly deposited onto bare TNTs without TiCl4 treatment, the procedure was similar to the CdSe deposition mentioned above.
Morphology, optical measurement and photoelectrochemical characterization
The morphologies of the ZnO nanorod arrays and TNT arrays were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI XL30 S-FEG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20 Super-twin). Samples for TEM investigation were prepared by scraping the TNTs with or without CdSe QDs from the FTO substrate and dispersing in ethanol solution, followed by transferring several drops of the suspension solution onto a carbon-coated copper grid. The optical properties were obtained by UV-vis spectroscopy (Shimadzu, UV2550). The Cu2S counter electrode on the brass sheet was prepared according to the literature.36 The CdS/CdSe-coated photoanode was clamped with a Cu2S counter electrode with polysulfide electrolyte (1 M Na2S and 1M S) inside to give a sandwich-type cell, in which a 25 μm silicone film was used as a spacer to separate the two electrodes. The active area of the cell was defined with a mask of 0.15 cm2. The cells were illuminated under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) (Oriel Solar Simulator 91192). Incident light intensity was measured by a radiant power/energy meter (Oriel 70260). Photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) characteristics for the cells were recorded on a Princeton Applied Research, Model 263A. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was carried out by direct current (dc) method using a lab-made IPCE setup under 0.3–0.9 mW cm−2 monochromic light illumination without bias illumination.37 EIS was characterized on a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 over an open circuit potential Voc in the frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with the Zview software in terms of an appropriate equivalent circuit.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Microstructure of nanoporous TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs)
In our work, the ZnO nanorod-templated method to prepare the TNT photoanode consists of three main steps: (i) pre-treatment of the FTO substrate by ZnO nanocrystals (ZnO seeds) and fabrication of vertically oriented ZnO nanorods on ZnO nanoparticle-decorated FTO substrates; (ii) formation of a ZnO/TiO2 core/shell structure through TiO2 sol deposited on oriented ZnO nanorod templates by a dip-coating technique; (iii) removal of the ZnO template to obtain TNTs. In order to further increase the surface area of TNTs for QDSCs, the TNTs were treated with 100 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 1 h. All samples were thermally treated at appropriate temperatures (see Experimental Section). Here, in order to clarify the samples at each step, the HCl treated TNTs are defined as the HCl–TNTs while TiCl4 treated TNTs are defined as the TiCl4–TNTs. Fig. 1a–e shows representative SEM images of ZnO nanorod, HCl–TNTs and TiCl4–TNTs, respectively. ZnO nanorod arrays are observed to grow vertically on FTO glass with a narrow diameter distribution of 160–200 nm. After etching with HCl aqueous solution, the HCl–TNTs are well inherited from the ZnO template, namely, uniform TNT arrays are perpendicular to the FTO substrate with a tube length of 3 μm, in which the inner diameters are corresponding to that of the ZnO nanorods. Besides, most TNTs are top-opened. Further TiCl4 treatment increased the wall thickness of the TNTs from 20 nm to 40 nm while the surface of the TNTs becomes rougher, as shown in Fig. 1e and Fig. 2a. This phenomenon is very different to the anodized TNT with TiCl4 treatment, in which the wall thickness does not change distinctly.26,27 This TiCl4 treatment could strongly enhance the surface area of TNTs and improve the inter connection among TiO2 nanoparticles in TNT films, as well as the good mechanical contact property between the TNT arrays and FTO substrate. Therefore, the TiCl4 treatment is suggested to be an indispensable step to enhance photogenerated electron transport in the TiO2 matrix and electron collection from the TNT photoanode to FTO substrate. These four aligned nanostructures exhibit different optical properties, for ZnO nanorods and ZnO/TiO2 core–shell structures, a strong light-scattering property is observed while semi-transparent TNTs exhibit a relatively good transmittance property, see Fig. S1, ESI†.

3.2 Fabrication of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TNT arrays
CdS and CdSe QDs were successively deposited on the TNT photoanode by the CBD method. Fig. 1g shows the top-view SEM image of QDs on TiCl4–TNT arrays, revealing that QDs/TNTs are well-distinguished and their inner pores are not blocked after the QDs deposition. Obviously, this TNT’s architecture facilitates the multi-layer deposition of QDs without blocking the inner-pores. The magnified image (Fig. 1f) clearly demonstrates that the wall thickness of the TNTs continuously increases from 40 nm to 70 nm. The structural derivation from the skeletal TNTs to subsequent CdSe QDs is further investigated by using TEM and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Here, one thing needs to be addressed. Based on our previous experiences, it is hard to identify CdS or CdSe QDs just from TEM images though their lattice constants. In the meantime, small TiO2 particles derived from TiCl4 treatment might confuse TEM results.26,27 Therefore, CdSe QDs were directly deposited onto HCl–TNTs in order to give clear TEM images (see Experimental Section). The ordered HCl–TNT tubular structure can be further clarified in Fig. 2a and the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2c shows the lattice spacing of 0.352 nm corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 (JPCDS 01-0562). After CdSe QDs deposition, much more CdSe clusters with approximate sizes in the range of 20–40 nm were dispersed on the inner and outer HCl–TNTs. According to HRTEM image of Fig. 2d, the CdSe cluster is composed of crystal grains with ∼5 nm, with lattice spacing of 0.373 nm which corresponds to the (100) plane of hexagonal CdSe (JPCDS 65-3415). Moreover, distinct lattice fringes in the HRTEM images suggest good crystallinity of the TiO2 and CdSe.
For QDSCs, multi-layer QD deposition on the TiO2 surface is supposed to favor electron transfer in the TiO2 matrix, however, relevant experimental demonstration is less reported.38 According to the SEM images of Fig. 3a–c, CdSe morphologies on TiCl4–TNT arrays will change with a prolonged deposition time. With a CdSe deposition time of 6 h, the sphere-like CdSe clusters are loosely dispersed on the rough surface of TiCl4–TNTs while the average wall thickness of QDs/TiCl4–TNTs is about 45 nm. Prolonging the deposition time from 6 h to 14 h, the size of the CdSe clusters increases, leading to a higher surface roughness of up to 70 nm of wall thickness to afford a compact CdSe QDs film. When further increasing the deposition time to 18 h, the sizes of CdSe clusters primarily do not increase any more. This CdSe growth process is supposed to help us further understand the electron transport and interfacial electron transfer processes in QDSCs.

3.3 UV-visible absorption spectra of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TNT arrays
UV-visible absorption spectra of the CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TiCl4–TNT arrays with different CdSe deposition times were also investigated, as shown in Fig. 4. It is clearly seen that with increasing the deposition time from 6 h to 14 h, their absorbance intensity increases gradually, indicating the amount of QDs on the TNT arrays increasing. When the CdSe deposition time increases continuously from 14 h to 18 h, however, the spectra almost do not change, implying no obvious increase in the amount of QDs after 14 h, which is in agreement with the SEM results shown in Fig. 3. Besides, the average size of CdSe particles is estimated to be 4.5 nm in the CdSe deposition time range of 6–18 h, based on the empirical equation proposed by Toyoda et al.11 This calculated CdSe particle size is also coincident with the TEM images. Therefore, it is supposed that the formation of a compact CdSe film is mainly ascribed to more and more CdSe particles appearing instead of single CdSe nanoparticles continuously growing in size.

3.4 Cell performance of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TNT photoanodes with various CdSe deposition time
CdS/CdSe decorated TiCl4–TNT arrays are incorporated with the Cu2S counter electrode on brass and the S22−/S2− electrolyte into the QDSCs. Differences of IPCE with increasing CdSe deposition time are investigated first. As we can see from Fig. 5a, the profiles of IPCE plots correspond to the UV-visible absorption results. The evolution of the IPCE values at 550 nm are 44%, 63%, 70%, 74% and 72%, respectively, according to CdSe deposition times of 6 h, 10 h, 12 h, 14 h and 18 h. When the CdSe deposition time is 14 h, the QDSC exhibits the highest IPCE values and keeps about 75% in the wavelength region of 400–600 nm. Furthermore, J–V characteristics for this series of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSCs are also given. As shown in Fig. 5b and Table 1, both Jsc and Voc increase quickly with increasing the CdSe deposition time from 6 to 14 h, reaching the maximum values of 10.81 mA cm−2 and 689 mV at 14 h CdSe deposition, yielding the highest efficiency (η) of 4.61%. Obviously, with increasing the CdSe deposition time, a greater amount of the CdSe QDs deposited on TNT arrays will generate more photo-excited electrons, thus giving higher Jsc and η of the device. However, when further increasing the CdSe deposition time to 18 h, Jsc does not increase anymore, in agreement with the IPCE result. Meanwhile, it is found that varying the CdSe deposition time does not make obvious differences to the fill factor (FF) of the QDSCs.

3.5 Investigation of evolution of open circuit voltage (Voc) with different CdSe deposition time
Of particular concern is that, to CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSCs with TNT arrays, the Voc gradually enhances with increasing the CdSe growth time, as seen in Table 1. Here, in order to fully understand the reason why CdSe deposition time has a positive influence on Voc, some key influential factors to the Voc need to be considered, which can be expressed by eqn (1):39,40 (1)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the electronic elementary charge, Jinj is the flux of electron injection from the QDs, ncb is the concentration of electrons at the conduction band of TiO2, kr is the electron recombination rate between the photogenerated electrons and S22− at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, and [S22−] is the concentration of S22− in the electrolyte. In our QDSC systems, the [S22−] and ncb are assumed to be constant since the TNT substrates and the electrolyte are the same. Thus, Voc is positively correlated to Jinj and negatively correlated to kr. According to eqn (2), the incident photon flux I0 is constant for our J–V measurement, therefore, Jinj is directly in proportion to A, which is the ratio of absorbed photon flux to I0.41,42 That is to say, Jinj increases with the evolution of CdSe deposition and reaches the maximum value after 14 h of CdSe growth, as seen in Fig. 4. To understand the relationship between kr and the CdSe deposition time, EIS has been used to investigate the recombination reaction at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface. Jinj = qAI0(2)

Fig. 6a presents typical Nyquist plots of QDSCs with different CdSe deposition time under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2 over open-circuit voltage Voc. Experimental curves are represented with symbols while the solid lines correspond to the fitted curves obtained with Zview software by using the equivalent circuit given in Fig. 6b. As we can see from Fig. 6a, two semicircles are obviously observed, the first small semicircle representing the impedance associated with the charge transfer process at Cu2S counter electrode/electrolyte interface in the high frequency range, the second large semicircle reflecting the impedance related to the charge transfer process at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface in the mid/low frequency range. Similar to the EIS results obtained from Bisquert et al., no obvious response can be found towards the diffusion impedance of the redox species in the electrolyte, considered as the short circuit in the QDSC system.43 According to the method proposed by Adachi et al., kr can be estimated by the characteristic frequency maximum of the second large semicircle in the Nyquist plot.44 Therefore, with our QDSCs, kr decreases gradually from 1.2 to 0.64 s−1 over 6–14 h CdSe growth time, whereas it slightly increases at 18 h CdSe growth time, as shown in Table 1. Obviously, increasing CdSe deposition time will result in a relatively low electron recombination rate between photogenerated electrons and S22− ions at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface. A possible explanation is that with increasing the CdSe deposition time, more QDs are decorated on the TiO2 surface, which significantly decreases the bare TiO2 surface and the possibility of its exposition toward the S22−/S2− electrolyte, thus reducing the recombination rate between photogenerated electrons and S22− ions. Furthermore, it is supposed that, multiple and compact QD films are easily formed on ordered photoanodes with large inner pores. These can simultaneously act as a passivation layer to increase electron injection into the TiO2 and reduce electron recombination with the polysulfide electrolyte, thus Voc increased as a benefit. Consequently, in terms of the evolution of Jinj and kr, the theoretical qualitative trend of Voc as a function of CdSe deposition time coincides well with the experimental data of Voc.

3.6 Comparison of the cell performance of QDSCs with different ordered photoanodes
With the CdS/CdSe-decorated TiO2 photoanodes by 14 h CdSe deposition, comparison with differently aligned photoanodes including ZnO nanorod, ZnO/TiO2 core/shell structure, HCl–TNT arrays as well as TiCl4–TNT arrays is also carried out. It is found that the amount of QDs deposited on these ordered photoanodes decreases in the order of TiCl4–TNT arrays, HCl–TNT arrays, ZnO/TiO2 core/shell structure and ZnO nanorod, which further confirms that surface area and the roughness of the photoanode are the key factors to the deposition of QDs. Thus, the best deposition time of CdS or CdSe for the best cell performance towards different photoanodes is definitely different. Fig. 7 and Table 2 show the IPCE, J–V curves and cell performance parameters of the QDSCs with different photoanodes upon identical QDs deposition time. The IPCE values increase in the order of ZnO nanorod, ZnO/TiO2 core/shell structure, HCl–TNT and TiCl4–TNT arrays, in which the IPCE value significantly enhances after TiCl4 treatment with the HCl–TNT arrays. Besides, the Jsc tendency corresponds to the IPCE values. The ZnO nanorod-based photoanode shows poor photovoltaic parameters with 4.37 mA cm−2 of Jsc, 459 mV of Voc, 0.28 of FF and 0.55% of η. After coating with a thin layer TiO2 shell on ZnO nanorod arrays, the Jsc, Voc, FF are enhanced, giving 1.45% of η. However, after HCl etching to remove the ZnO, the Jsc is found to slightly reduce to 5.09 mA cm−2, whereas Voc and FF slightly increase, leading to almost the same efficiency with the ZnO/TiO2 core/shell structure. In particular, the TiCl4 treatment will significantly enhance the cell performance with 10.81 mA cm−2 of Jsc, 689 mV of Voc, 0.62 of FF, yielding up to 4.61% of η, which is mainly ascribed to the higher surface area and composite structure of the small TiO2 nanoparticles and TNT arrays.

Compared to our published work about the TiO2 nanoparticle (NP)-based QDSCs with 4.92% efficiency, the TNT-based QDSCs exhibit relatively lower Jsc and η, however, with 100 mV higher Voc.7 The relatively low Jsc (10.81 vs. 13.68 mA cm−2) is the decisive factor, which is ascribed to the 3 μm length of the TNT arrays. Here, comparative QDSCs with 3 μm thickness TiO2 NP-photoanode was also fabricated, which can only present 8.97 mA cm−2 of Jsc, 532 mV of Voc, 0.55 of FF, yielding 2.61% of η. Currently, more effort is being made to further improve the quality of TNTs with controllable length and morphology in our lab, and we believe that a higher conversion efficiency of TNTs-based QDSCs will be achieved in the future.
4. Conclusions
Aiming at increasing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the cell performance, TNT architectures were fabricated directly on FTO with a facile template process and have been firstly applied into CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSCs. The morphologies, optical and electrical properties of different ordered photoanodes and their influences on the cell performance were also investigated. The CdSe growth mechanism on the surface of the TNTs was proposed with the help of TEM, SEM and UV-visible absorption spectra, that is, sphere-like CdSe clusters firstly loosely disperse on the surface of TNTs, then keep growing larger, and finally join together to afford a compact CdSe QDs film. Increasing CdSe deposition time will obtain not only higher short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), but also relatively low electron recombination between photogenerated electrons and S22− at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface, which has a positive effect on Voc evolution. Under optimal 14 h CdSe deposition, a conversion efficiency of 4.61% has been achieved with 3 μm long TNT arrays, which is the best record for sandwich-type TNT-based QDSCs. This kind of one-dimensional order TiO2 photoanode exhibits potential applications in the further improvement of the performance of QDSCs .
