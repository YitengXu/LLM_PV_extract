    , Accepted 17th March 2015First published on 18th March 2015AbstractPerovskite solar cells fabricated via a solution process have drawn great attention due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, we report cross-linked anode interlayers with solvent-resistance that reduce electron–hole recombination by blocking electrons for inverted type solution processed perovskite solar cells. The cross-linkable materials used are (N,N′-bis(4-(6-((3-ethyloxetan-3-yl)methoxy)-hexyloxy)phenyl)-N,N′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (QUPD) and N,N′-bis(4-(6-((3-ethyloxetan-3-yl)methoxy))-hexylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-4,4′-diamine (OTPD)), which can be cross-linked in the presence of acid groups provided by diffusion from the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer. The resulting PCE shows an improvement from 9.93% (control device) to 13.06% (cross-linked QUPD (X-QUPD)) by about 3% under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which demonstrates that the introduction of cross-linked electron blocking interlayers is a promising way to enhance the performance of inverted type solution processed perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (e.g., methylammonium lead halides CH3NH3PbX3, where X = halogen) based solar cells have attracted great attention due to their high PCE,1–4 resulting from their strong light harvesting ability across the visible to near-infrared region1 and long charge-carrier diffusion lengths (>1 μm)5 along with ambipolar transport properties of fast electron mobility (12.5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole mobility (7.5 cm2 V−1 s−1).6 Several methods have been developed to synthesize perovskite, such as the solution process,7 sequential deposition (dipping PbI2 films in CH3NH3I solution in isopropyl alcohol),8 vacuum deposition9 and the vapor assisted solution process (VASP).10 Owing to their excellent optoelectrical properties and simple device architecture, conventional type perovskite solar cells exhibit PCE as high as 19.3% (average PCE 16.6%).3
In conventional type perovskite solar cells, perovskite can act as both an efficient light harvester and a hole transporter since the PCE of a device without a hole transport layer (HTL) can reach 5.5%.11 However, the use of a HTL can promote hole transport from perovskite to the anode and a few hole transport materials (HTMs) have been successfully applied in conventional type perovskite solar cells, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)amino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD),12 poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT)13 and poly-triarylamines (PTAA).14 Spiro-OMeTAD is a small molecular material and is the most widely used HTM in conventional type perovskite solar cells. Pristine Spiro-OMeTAD as a HTL shows poor hole transport properties resulting from its low conductivity (4 × 10−7 S cm−1), which leads to low device performance (Voc = 0.272 V, Jsc = 0.006 mA cm−2, FF = 0.34 and PCE = 0.006%) and high series resistance (Rs = 6202 Ω cm2).15 By doping it with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) for increasing its conductivity (from 4 × 10−7 to 2 × 10−4 S cm−1)16,17 along with adding 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) as an additive for facilitating the dissolution of the lithium salt in the Spiro-OMeTAD matrix,18 the perovskite solar cells with the doped Spiro-OMeTAD as a HTL successfully demonstrated a PCE of over 15%. And through fine tuning the structure of Spiro-OMeTAD with a methoxyl group from para position to ortho position, an increased PCE of 17.6% was reported.12 The thickness of Spiro-OMeTAD used was in the range of 100 to 300 nm,5,9 and the effect of thickness was reflected by an increase in series resistance accompanied by a decreased PCE of the device.19 On the other hand, conjugated polymers are also good candidates for HTLs. Guo et al. applied P3HT as a HTL and fabricated a device with a PCE of 9.2%, which was then further improved to 12.4% by the use of Li-TFSI doped P3HT to increase its conductivity and 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (D-t-BP) to enhance the ordering of P3HT.13 Heo et al. employed PTAA as a HTL and achieved a PCE of 12.0%,14 since PTAA possesses a suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (−5.20 eV) for perovskite to transport holes and a high enough lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (−2.4 eV) to block electrons and thus reducing electron–hole recombination.
In conventional type perovskite solar cells, TiO2 is usually adopted as an electron collector, which was prepared through high temperature (500 °C) sintering6 on an expensive FTO coated glass as a transparent conducting electrode.20 On the other hand, inverted type perovskite solar cells are usually fabricated at lower temperature (<150 °C) and ITO is generally used as a transparent conductive electrode. Yang et al. demonstrated that a mixed halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) containing simple inverted type perovskite solar cell (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al) could achieve a PCE of 11.5% and 9.2% using rigid (glass/ITO) and flexible (plastics/ITO) substrates, respectively.21 Malinkiewicz et al. applied PTAA as an electron blocking layer inserted between PEDOT:PSS and vacuum deposited perovskite layers to improve the PCE up to 12.04%.22
For polymer light emitting diodes, Meerholz et al. developed a series of cross-linkable HTMs (QUPD and OTPD) which are composed of a tetraphenylbenzidine group for hole transport and two oxetane functional groups for crosslinking;23,24 and through fine tuning the chemical structure with two electron donating alkoxyl groups, their HOMO levels can be increased. Marks et al. used a blend of poly[9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-[4-(3-methylpropyl)]-diphenylamine] (TFB) and 4,4′-bis[(p-trichlorosilylpropylphenyl)-phenylamino]biphenyl (TPDSi2) followed by cross-linking to form a hole-transport/electron-blocking interfacial layer for polymer solar cells with the MDMO-PPV:PCBM active layer.25 The photovoltaic parameter Voc increases from 0.74 V to 0.89 V due to the fact that the TFB:TPDSi2 film possesses a high-lying LUMO level able to block electrons and hence reduce the chances of electron–hole recombination, resulting in the promotion of PCE from 1.46% to 2.29%.
Here, we have used cross-linked QUPD and OTPD interlayers (denoted as X-QUPD and X-OTPD, respectively) as electron blocking layers for the first time in inverted type perovskite solar cells with the device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/cross-linked interlayer/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al. QUPD and OTPD are cross-linked through the assistance of protons from the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer. X-QUPD and X-OTPD provide the following advantages: (1) cross-linked interlayers are solvent-resistant and suitable for solution processing of perovskite on top of it; (2) the HOMO level does match with that of the perovskite and is therefore energetically favorable for hole collection; (3) the high lying LUMO level provides electron blocking ability to reduce electron–hole recombination at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface; and (4) absorption peaks are located in the UV region, which could minimize the absorption overlap with the perovskite and hence reduce the loss of sunlight harvest. In the presence of the cross-linked interlayers, the PCE is improved from 9.93% (control device) to 13.06% (X-QUPD) and 10.87% (X-OTPD) under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
Experimental
The fabrication procedure of the devices is as follows: ITO glass plates were cleaned sequentially with detergent aqueous solution, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The cleaned ITO glass was then treated with oxygen plasma at a pressure of 1.93 × 10−1 Torr for 5 minutes. PEDOT:PSS (25 nm) (Clevios P VP.AI 4083, 1.5 wt% in water) was spin-coated on the treated ITO. After drying for 10 minutes at 140 °C, a thin layer (4 nm) of QUPD or OTPD (from Lumtec) was spin-cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer and heated at 200 °C for 20 minutes to carry out cross-linking by the reaction of oxetane groups through the assistance of the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer by providing protons from diffused PSS chains in PEDOT:PSS to the QUPD and OTPD layers. The mixed halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) was formed by a solution process, which is composed of CH3NH3I (synthesis according to the literature[S4]) and PbCl2 (Aldrich) at a molar ratio of 3:1 in N,N-dimethylmethanamide (DMF, from Aldrich) with a weight content of 40%. The solution was spin cast on the cross-linked interlayer and annealed at 100 °C for 2.5 hours to obtain a perovskite layer (400 nm); then PC61BM (80 nm) (4% in chlorobenzene, from Nano-C) was spin cast on top of the perovskite layer and the cathode of Al was deposited under 2 × 10−6 Torr. The devices were fabricated in a glove box except for ITO cleaning and PEDOT:PSS spin coating. The device active area is about 7.5 mm2. J–V characteristics of the devices were also measured in a nitrogen filled glove box.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of QUPD and OTPD are shown in Fig. 1a, which are composed of tetraphenylbenzidine for hole transport and oxetane groups for cross-linking. The HOMO level of X-QUPD is expected to be higher than that of X-OTPD due to the presence of two electron donating methoxyl groups in the former. The energy levels of X-QUPD and X-OTPD were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (as shown in Fig. 1b) and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy as described below. The X-QUPD and X-OTPD were fabricated by spin casting from their chlorobenzene solution with 10% triphenylsulfonium triflate as a photoacid and exposure to UV light for 1 min and then annealing at 200 °C for cross-linking. The film was washed with chlorobenzene to remove the incompletely cross-linked small molecule materials and photoacid. The HOMO level was calculated from the CV results using the following equation: EHOMO = −4.8 − (Eoxvs. Fc/Fc+) (eV),26 where Eoxvs. Fc/Fc+ is the onset of oxidation potential with reference to ferrocene. The oxidation potentials of X-QUPD and X-OTPD versus Fc/Fc+ are 0.32 eV and 0.47 eV (Fig. 1b) and their HOMO levels are −5.12 eV and −5.27 eV, respectively. The reported HOMO level of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx is −5.30 eV,27 implying that the X-QUPD and X-OTPD are energetically favorable for hole transport. The UV-vis absorption spectra of X-QUPD and X-OTPD as films are shown in Fig. 1c. In the measurement, QUPD and OTPD were coated on quartz/PEDOT:PSS, and the cross-linking reaction occurred through the assistance of protons from PEDOT:PSS (without adding a photoacid). The extent of cross-linking was determined by absorption spectroscopy. As the absorbances of X-QUPD and X-OTPD show no decrease after washing the film with CB, the cross-linking was considered to be complete. The onset wavelengths of X-QUPD and X-OTPD are 403 and 411 nm, which correspond to the optical bandgaps (Eg) of 3.08 eV and 3.02 eV, respectively. The LUMO levels were calculated from the optical bandgaps (ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg) and the values are −2.04 eV and −2.25 eV, respectively. The energy levels are shown in Fig. 1d and the high lying LUMO level providing electron blocking ability obviously enables reduction of electron–hole recombination at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface.

The conductivity measurements for X-QUPD and X-OTPD were performed by the four probe method and the samples were prepared by coating QUPD or OTPD on glass and cross-linked by a photoacid (triphenylsulfonium triflate). The conductivities of X-QUPD and X-OTPD are 9.32 × 10−5 and 4.93 × 10−5 S cm−1 respectively, which are lower than 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP.AI 4083) by one order of magnitude. The hole mobilities of the X-QUPD and X-OTPD were determined by using a hole only device with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/X-QUPD or X-OTPD/MoO3/Al along with the use of a single carrier space charge limited current (SCLC) equation for the calculation, which is the Mott–Gurney law:28J = 9εε0μ(V − Vbi)2/8L3, where ε0 (8.85 × 10−12 A2 s4 kg−1 m−3) is the permittivity of free space, ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer (the dielectric constant ε is taken as 3, which is a typical value for conjugated polymers29), μ is the carrier mobility, V is the applied voltage across device, Vbi is the built-in voltage and taken as zero, and L is the thickness of the film. From the results of the hole only device, X-QUPD and X-OTPD have the hole mobilities of 4.18 × 10−6 and 1.37 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S1†), respectively. The higher value of the former than the latter is due to the incorporation of electron donating methoxyl groups into the former allowing an enhanced delocalized π-electron density and thus the promotion of hole mobility.30
The uniformity and continuous coverage of the perovskite film are crucial for achieving high efficiency perovskite solar cells.31 We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate the morphology of the surface and cross-section of the perovskite layer. The perovskite films coated on top of PEDOT:PSS, X-QUPD and X-OTPD layers all are found to be reasonably uniform. From the top view (Fig. 2a–c), the %coverage of the perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS was estimated to be 92.3%, while those on X-QUPD and X-OTPD are 97.3% and 96.2%, respectively. From the cross-section images (Fig. 2d–f) of perovskite films, that on PEDOT:PSS shows a more uneven height distribution, which is consistent with the lower surface coverage (92.3%) and the presence of voids; the views of those on X-QUPD and X-OTPD are more uniform. All the SEM cross-section images reveal a clear interface between each layer, and the thicknesses of PEDOT:PSS with a cross-linked interlayer and a perovskite layer estimated from the SEM pictures are about 30 nm and 400 nm, respectively, which are consistent with the values measured using a depth profiler.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films coated on glass/PEDOT:PSS and glass/PEDOT:PSS/X-QUPD or X-OTPD substrates were measured. All exhibit the diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx at 14.3°, 28.6°, 43.4°, and 59.04° corresponding to (110), (220), (330) and (440) planes (Fig. S1a†), respectively, which are close to those reported in the literature.32 Though the perovskite layers coated on the different substrates are not affected as understood from the positions of these diffraction peaks, those on cross-linked interlayers give more intense diffraction at (330) and (440) planes, indicating that the perovskite crystallinity on top of X-QUPD and X-OTPD is higher than that on PEDOT:PSS. From the literature, the perovskite films grown on the top of different polymers gave different crystallinity.22,33 The perovskite deposited on the polymer PTAA film has higher crystallinity than those on the other polymers (polythiophene derivatives (with or without electron acceptors) or PCDTBT) using a vacuum deposition method. Since the chemical structure of PTAA is composed of triarylamine units similar to QUPD and OTPD, the crystallinity of the perovskite films on X-QUPD and X-OTPD is expected to be significantly higher than that with PEDOT:PSS, as in fact it is.
From the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. S1b†), we observe significant quenching of perovskite films at the interfaces with PEDOT:PSS, X-QUPD and X-OTPD, and the extent of quenching relative to that with glass alone as the substrate (taking its PL as 100%) increases in the sequence: X-OTPD (26.4%), PEDOT:PSS (14.6%) and X-QUPD (9.3%). The PL intensity is effectively quenched at the interface between perovskite and X-QUPD, which is even higher than that of PEDOT:PSS. On the other hand, the X-OTPD with lower quenching effect might be due to the lower HOMO level offset between the perovskite and X-OTPD, which leads to the reduction of exciton dissociation and therefore decrease of Jsc of the device as to be revealed later.
The inverted type perovskite solar cell with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/cross-linked interlayer/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al is shown in Fig. 3a and the detailed fabrication procedure is described in the experimental section. The device performances were measured under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination in a glove box. Their J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3b and their performance characteristic values are listed in Table 1. The PCEs of the devices with X-QUPD (13.06%) and X-OTPD (10.87%) are better than that of the control device (9.93%, without a cross-linked interlayer), which is mainly attributed to the improvement in open circuit voltage (Voc) as it increases effectively from 0.77 V to 0.99 V (X-QUPD) and 0.95 V (X-OTPD) by inserting an ultrathin layer (4 nm) of the cross-linked interlayer. Such improvement in Voc should be due to the better film quality of perovskite with less voids9 to reduce the shunt pathway and effectively block electrons at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface to suppress electron–hole recombination.34 An improvement of Voc can also be expected according to the Shockley equation, which can be used to predict the Voc dependence of the electrical properties of solar cells.35,36 That is Voc = nkT(ln(Jph/Js) + 1)/q, where Jph is the current density under one sun illumination, which is equal to the short circuit current density (Jsc), Js is the saturation current density at reverse bias measured under darkness, n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge. There is a correlation between the dark J–V characteristics and Voc (Fig. 3c), in which Js values of the devices with X-QUPD and X-OTPD are significantly lower than that of the control device, thereby leading to larger Voc values of the devices with X-QUPD and X-OTPD as the interlayers.

The lower conductivity of X-QUPD and X-OTPD causes additional resistance to charge collection compared that of the control device by a factor of 2–3 as the Rs values of X-QUPD (7.06 Ω cm2) and X-OTPD (10.42 Ω cm2) are higher than that of the control device (3.48 Ω cm2). The leakage current profiles under reversed bias indicate that the cross-linked interlayer effectively decreases the leakage current by about one order of magnitude and therefore leads to an increase in Rsh (Table 1). The Rsh increases from 333 Ω cm2 (control device) to 2096 Ω cm2 (X-QUPD) and 1475 Ω cm2 (X-OTPD). These indicate that the devices with the cross-linked interlayer actually show an increase in Rs due to the lower conductivity of X-QUPD and X-OTPD, but effectively reduce leakage current and charge recombination. The fill factor (FF) is affected by series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh); the FF of X-QUPD (0.73) is improved as compared to the control device (0.68), but that of X-OTPD (0.66) is slightly lower. The Jsc decreases in the following sequence: control device (18.96 mA cm−2), X-QUPD (18.07 mA cm−2) and X-OTPD (17.34 mA cm−2), which might be due to the lower conductivity and hole mobility of X-QUPD and X-OTPD. The device with X-OTPD gives the lowest Jsc, which might be resulted from the additional reason of a lower PL quenching effect. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) represents the response of the device at a given wavelength of light irradiation and the current integrated from the conversion region is directly related to Jsc. As shown in Fig. 3d, the EQE can reach over 60% in the whole conversion region and their integrated Jsc values (from 300 to 800 nm) are 18.53 mA cm−2 (control device), 18.01 mA cm−2 (X-QUPD) and 17.03 mA cm−2 (X-OTPD), which are in agreement with the J–V measurement within 5% error.
Due to the low conductivities of X-QUPD or X-OTPD, the device performance is critically dependent on the thickness of the cross-linked interlayer.37–39 Therefore, employing ultrathin thickness is necessary to reduce the series resistance. The effect of the thickness of X-QUPD and X-OTPD was also examined and their J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4 and their characteristic values are listed in Tables S1 and S2.† For the optimal thickness (4 nm) of X-QUPD and X-OTPD, the devices give higher Rsh and Rs than those of the control device. The ultrathin interlayer (<4 nm) might cause incomplete coverage on PEDOT:PSS, which may result in direct contact of perovskite with PEDOT:PSS and hence reduce the Rsh and Rs. In addition, a slight reduction in Voc by 0.06 V for X-QUPD and 0.04 V for X-OTPD (as compared to the optimal ultrathin interlayer, 4 nm) was observed, which resulted from incomplete coverage of the cross-linked interlayer. However, a thicker interlayer leads to higher Rs (due to its lower conductivity) as compared to PEDOT:PSS and to a decrease in FF.

J–V characteristics of the devices with various thicknesses of (a) X-QUPD and (b) X-OTPD interlayers measured under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). 
To investigate charge recombination in all the devices, we measured the J–V curves of the devices with X-QUPD and X-OTPD at their optimal thickness of 4 nm and the control device under various light intensities ranging from 100 mW cm−2 to 0.29 mW cm−2 and plotted Jscversus illumination intensity (I) as shown in Fig. S3.† The fitting of Jscversus I with the power law relationship:21,39–41Jsc ∝ Iα, where α (≤ 1) is the ideality factor, is given in Fig. S3d.† This power law relationship describes the charge recombination kinetics under short circuit conditions (V = 0); as α = 1, no recombination occurs, and deviation from 1 indicates an extent of charge recombination. For the devices with X-QUPD and X-OTPD and the control device, the α values are 0.99, 0.97 and 0.93, respectively. X-QUPD has the highest α value of 0.99, which implies that the extent of charge recombination is extremely low. This is correlated with the X-QUPD interlayer with a high lying LUMO, which can effectively block electrons at the perovskite interface and hence reduce the electron–hole recombination.

Fig. 5 shows the device parameter deviations of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE with the addition of a cross-linked interlayer. Compared with the control device, an increase in Voc is seen; however, disappointingly the Jsc value decreased, resulting from the lower conductivities and hole mobilities of X-QUPD and X-OTPD. The cross-linked interlayer has a significant effect on device performance since X-QUPD and X-OTPD can block electrons and suppress the electron–hole recombination. Therefore, X-QUPD and X-OTPD have a positive effect on the device performance.

Conclusions
By employing two cross-linked polymers (X-QUPD and X-OTPD) as interlayers between PEDOT:PSS and perovskite in inverted type perovskite solar cells, the PCE is improved from 9.93% (control device) to 13.06% (X-QUPD) by about 3% and to 10.87% (X-OTPD) by about 1% under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The improvement in PCE can be attributed to their high lying LUMO levels which can effectively block electrons to suppress the electron–hole recombination and thus reduce leakage current leading to an increase of Voc from 0.77 V to 0.95–0.99 V. Such high lying LUMO levels obviously allow an over compensation of their low conductivities and hole mobilities.
