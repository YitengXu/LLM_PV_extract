    , Accepted 19th February 2019First published on 20th February 2019AbstractTwo novel fused ring electron acceptors PDT and PDT-T have been designed, synthesized and used in organic solar cells. PDT comprises a central 4,10-bis(hexyloxy)-6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydropyreno[1,2-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene (DDT) donor unit and two flanked 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile acceptor units, while PDT-T has an extra thiophene bridge unit between the central donor unit and the acceptor unit. The introduction of a thiophene bridge unit can markedly broaden the absorption of acceptors and enhance the film absorption coefficient. The optical bandgaps of PDT and PDT-T are 1.59 and 1.44 eV, respectively. The photovoltaic performance of these two acceptors was investigated using PBDB-T as the electron donor. Wide photo-current responses extending to 800 nm for PDT based devices and to 900 nm for PDT-T based ones were observed. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.07% for PBDB-T:PDT based cells was obtained with a Voc of 0.96 V, Jsc of 13.48 mA cm−2 and FF of 54.0%, while the as-cast devices based on PBDB-T:PDT-T gave rise to a PCE of 11.02% with a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 18.88 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.3%. These results highlight that DDT is a promising building block for constructing highly efficient fused ring acceptors and π-bridging can further boost the photovoltaic performance of the devices.
Introduction
Fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have been widely used in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) owing to their tunable molecular structures, energy levels and absorption characteristics.1–4 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs based on FREAs has already surpassed 14%.5–16 Most high efficiency FREAs are of an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type structure, in which a fused multi-ring ladder structure is commonly used as the D unit and a 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) derivative is used as the A unit. The optical properties of FREAs can be easily tuned by the combination of different D and A units.17–26 Many commonly used aromatic molecules such as benzene,27–29 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene,5,30,31 thieno[3,2-b]thiophene,32–34 naphthalene,35–37 fluorene38–40 and carbazole41 have been used for the synthesis of the central D unit. Different from the other aromatic molecules mentioned above, naphthalene has a unique aromatic ring that comprises many positions that can be easily modified. Three different D units (C-1,29 C-2 (ref. 30) and C-3 (ref. 31)) and the corresponding naphthalene derivative precursors are shown in Scheme 1. C-1 and C-2 are of an S-shape and C-3 is of a quasi-linear structure. FREAs with C-1, C2, and C3 as the central core and IC derivatives as the terminal A units have been prepared and used for OSCs, demonstrating PCEs of 9.03%, 8.63% and 6.9%, respectively. The PCE can be further improved to 12.3% for naphthodithiophene-based acceptors with an extended conjugation.42
 Scheme 1  The design strategies for the naphthalene based fused ring. 
Besides the optical properties of active layer materials, the morphology of active layers is also critical to the device performance of OSCs.43–46 Optimizing the morphology of active layers is a necessity to achieve high-efficiency OSCs. Usually additives or post thermal annealing is required, which complicates device fabrication. Therefore, designing active layer materials that can be used to fabricate as-cast devices is also an important task in organic photovoltaics. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that the introduction of alkoxy chains at appropriate positions of FREAs is an effective way to enhance the performance of devices.47 The introduction of intramolecular S–O interactions can lock the free rotation of adjacent units around the single bond in the acceptor molecular backbone.48 Such molecular design can enhance the solubility of acceptor molecules without interfering with their close packing in the solid state.47
Here, 1,5-dibromo-2,6-bis(hexyloxy)naphthalene was used as the key intermediate for the synthesis of FREAs. The introduction of two alkoxy chains at the C2 and C6 positions of the naphthalene ring could not only enhance the solubility of target molecules but also force the cyclization to happen at the C-4 and C-8 positions of the naphthalene ring. The flexible side chains in the central ladder type core are far from the two terminal IC groups and will not interfere with the close packing of terminal groups to form J-type aggregation.49 Therefore, it is possible to achieve high efficiency as-cast organic photovoltaic devices through tuning the morphology of the active layer via enhancing the solubility of acceptors. Two acceptors PDT and PDT-T with a central 4,10-bis(hexyloxy)-6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydropyreno[1,2-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene (DDT) unit were synthesized for OSCs (Scheme 2). Compared with PDT, PDT-T with a thiophene as the π-bridging unit between D and A units demonstrates a broader absorption, higher absorption coefficient and smaller optical bandgap. Devices with poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo(1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′)dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) as the electron donor were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic performances of PDT-T and PDT as electron acceptors. The optimized devices based on PBDB-T:PDT displayed a PCE of 7.07% with a high Voc of 0.96 V, Jsc of 13.48 mA cm−2 and FF of 54.0%. Significantly, a PCE of 11.02% with a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 18.88 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.3% was obtained for the as-cast devices based on PBDB-T:PDT-T. Our results have demonstrated that naphthalene can be a promising building block for the synthesis of FREAs.

Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures and synthesis routes of PDT and PDT-T are outlined in Scheme 2 and the details of syntheses are provided in the ESI.† Naphthalene-2,6-diol was chosen as the starting material, which reacted with 1-bromohexane to give 2,6-bis(hexyloxy)naphthalene (1) in a yield of 77%. Bromination of compound 1 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) afforded 1,5-dibromo-2,6-bis(hexyloxy)naphthalene (2) in a yield of 93%. The treatment of compound 2 with n-BuLi gave rise to a lithium–halogen exchanged intermediate, which was quenched by 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane to give compound 3. Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki coupling of compound 3 with ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate afforded compound 4 in a yield of 53%. The reaction of 4 with 4-hexylphenyllithium was followed by hydrolysis to afford the corresponding diol, which was converted to compound 5 in a total yield of 79% by the BF3·Et2O catalyzed cyclization. The treatment of 5 with n-BuLi formed a dianion intermediate, which was quenched by N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to furnish dialdehyde 6 in a yield of 56%. Bromination of compound 5 with NBS provided compound 7 in a yield of 95%, which was subsequently coupled with 5-formylthiophen-2-yl-boronic acid to afford dialdehyde 8 in a yield of 83%. Knoevenagel condensation of 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile with dialdehydes 6 and 8 afforded the target molecules PDT and PDT-T in yields of 49% and 76%, respectively. Chemical structures of PDT and PDT-T were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. PDT and PDT-T can be easily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, and chloroform, at room temperature, guaranteeing their good solution processability.
Frontier energy levels and photophysical properties
The molecular geometries of PDT and PDT-T were evaluated based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. To simplify the calculations, the alkyl and alkoxy chains were replaced by methyl and methoxy groups, respectively. As presented in Fig. 1, PDT and PDT-T are almost of planar conformation, and the dihedral angles between the thiophene ring and the central naphthalene ring in the DDT unit are 4.4° for PDT and 5.6° for PDT-T, respectively. After introducing two thiophenes as π-bridge units in PDT-T, the dihedral angle of two adjacent thiophene rings is only 2.8°.

The optical properties of the two FREAs were investigated, their solution and film ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2 and the detailed optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, PDT in chloroform solution exhibits a broad absorption band in the range of 550 to 750 nm with a peak at 687 nm and PDT-T displays a red-shifted absorption band ranging from 600 to 850 nm with a peak at 730 nm. In chloroform solution, the molar absorption coefficients are 9.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 687 nm for PDT and 9.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 730 nm for PDT-T. In film, the absorption of the two FREAs became obviously broadened and red-shifted with the absorption maximum located at 719 nm for PDT and 773 nm for PDT-T. Red shifts of approximately 32 nm for PDT and 43 nm for PDT-T were observed, suggesting that J-type aggregation could be formed in films. It is worth noting that the absorption coefficient of PDT-T in film is 6.3 × 104 cm−1 at 773 nm, which is much higher than that of PDT (3.5 × 104 cm−1 at 719 nm). The absorption onsets of PDT and PDT-T are located at 779 and 864 nm, respectively, corresponding to the optical band gaps of 1.59 eV for PDT and 1.44 eV for PDT-T according to Eg opt = 1240/λonset. The introduction of two thiophene bridge units in PDT-T can extend the conjugation of FREAs. It is well known that extended conjugation of molecules can reduce their electronic transition energy, so the absorption would red-shift.50,51

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the energy levels of PDT and PDT-T, the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple with a potential of 0.09 eV was used as the internal standard, and the CV curves are shown in Fig. 3. From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated to be −5.52 and −3.90 eV for PDT and −5.43 and −3.97 eV for PDT-T, respectively, from the equations EHOMO = −e[Eox + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)] and ELUMO = −e[Ere + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)]. The LUMO energy offset between PDT or PDT-T and PBDB-T (−3.42 eV) is around 0.48–0.55 eV, which is large enough for efficient electron transfer from PBDB-T to the acceptor. The HOMO energy offset between PDT or PDT-T and PBDB-T (−5.23 eV) is around 0.2 eV, which can guarantee hole transfer from the acceptor to the PBDB-T donor.52,53 All these data are summarized in Table 1.

Photovoltaic properties
OSCs with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/MoO3 (85 Å)/Ag (100 nm) were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of these two acceptors (PDT and PDT-T). The wide band-gap polymer PBDB-T was chosen as the electron donor. The fabrication conditions of the active layer, including the processing solvents, the active layer thicknesses, the weight ratios of the donor to the acceptor, and the volume of additives, were systematically optimized. Details of the optimized conditions are shown in the ESI.† The optimized donor to acceptor weight ratio is 1:1.2, the processing solvent is o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), and the thickness of the active layer is ∼100 nm. Typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices are shown in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The as-cast solar cells with a PBDB-T:PDT blend film as the active layer demonstrate a Voc of 0.97 V, Jsc of 13.48 mA cm−2, FF of 54.0% and PCE of 7.07%. High Voc can be derived from its high LUMO energy level. For the PBDB-T:PDT-T based as-cast devices, a slightly reduced Voc of 0.88 V, obviously higher Jsc of 18.88 mA cm−2, and high FF of 66.3% compared to those of PBDB-T:PDT based solar cells were achieved, resulting in a high PCE of 11.02%. The use of additives or post thermal annealing could lead to a decrease of device performance. The superior Jsc for the PDT-T based solar cells in comparison with that for PDT based ones can be partially attributed to its stronger and broader optical absorption. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. 4b) showed that PBDB-T:PDT-T based devices have a wider spectral response ranging from 300 to 900 nm than that of PBDB-T:PDT-based ones, which is consistent with the broader absorption spectrum of PDT-T than that of PDT. The larger EQE value in the range of 400–800 nm for PBDB-T:PDT-T based OSCs is probably related to the higher film extinction coefficient of PDT-T than that of PDT.

Charge mobilities
The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of blend films (Fig. 5). The PBDB-T:PDT based blend film exhibits electron and hole mobilities of 5.0 × 10−5 and 2.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μe/μh of 2.3, whereas the PBDB-T:PDT-T based blend film displays a much higher μe of 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh of 1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a more balanced μe/μh of 1.2. The intense absorption together with high and balanced charge mobilities will benefit the better utilization of sunlight and charge transport, which is consistent with the higher Jsc and FF observed for PBDB-T:PDT-T based solar cells.

Morphological characterization
The morphology of the active layer plays a critical role in determining the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Therefore, the film morphologies of the PBDB-T:PDT blend and PBDB-T:PDT-T blend were investigated by means of an atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Fig. 6). Relatively homogeneous surface morphological structures were observed for the two blend films, which thereby afforded similar and small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.01 nm for the PBDB-T:PDT blend film and 1.09 nm for the PBDB-T:PDT-T one. The TEM images show obvious and well-dispersed fibrous structures for both PBDB-T:PDT and PBDB-T:PDT-T blend films. In our previous work, we have proven that PBDB-T can form nanofibrils.40 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis based on films of small molecules, polymers and the blends suggests that π–π interactions in PDT-T are stronger than those in PDT (Fig. S2†). But such a difference can hardly influence the morphology of the blend film. So, even if there is some difference in the π–π interaction for the two FREAs, the morphologies of the active layers based on them are similar. The nanofibrils are formed by the aggregation of PBDB-T during the drying of the blend film.44 The diameters of nanofibrils in the PBDB-T:PDT and PBDB-T:PDT-T based blend films are approximately 17 and 13 nm, respectively. And the nanofibrils in the PBDB-T:PDT-T based blend film are much longer than those in the PBDB-T:PDT based one. The formation of such nanofibrils benefits charge carrier generation and transport.

Conclusion
In summary, two new acceptors PDT and PDT-T comprising a central 4,10-bis(hexyloxy)-6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydropyreno[1,2-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene donor unit and two 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile acceptor units without or with two thiophene bridge units have been designed and synthesized. PDT exhibits an absorption band in the range of 550 to 750 nm and an optical bandgap of 1.59 eV, whereas PDT-T displays much broader absorption from 600 to 850 nm and a smaller optical bandgap of 1.44 eV. Besides, PDT-T exhibits a larger film absorption coefficient than that of PDT. PBDB-T was used as the electron donor to fabricate OSCs to investigate the photovoltaic performance of these two acceptors. A PCE of 7.07% for PBDB-T:PDT based cells was obtained with a Voc of 0.96 V, Jsc of 13.48 mA cm−2 and FF of 54.0%. Significantly, the PCE of the as-cast solar cells based on PBDB-T:PDT-T can reach 11.02% with a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 18.88 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.3%. Benefitting from the two more thiophenes as π-bridge units, PDT-T possesses broader absorption and stronger π–π interactions than those of PDT. The photovoltaic performance of devices based on PBDB-T:PDT-T is improved due to the higher Jsc and more balanced carrier mobilities.
