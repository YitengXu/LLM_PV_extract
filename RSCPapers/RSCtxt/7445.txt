The synthesis is convenient, rapid and environmentally friendly. The POMs serve as reducing, encapsulating and bridging molecules, and avoid introducing any organic toxic molecules. The nanohybrids have been thoroughly characterized using SEM, EDX TEM, XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. Most importantly, the nanohybrids were demonstrated to act as low cost catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells with similar performance to Pt catalysts. We attribute it to the high catalytic activity of the Ag NN and the excellent electron transfer properties of GNSs and also their synergistic effect, being reinforced by the presence of molybdenum species on the Ag NN/GNS surface.1 IntroductionThe global energy crisis has stimulated more and more attention to novel renewable energy storage and conversion by sustainable chemical methods. Among all the related factors of key renewable-energy technologies including fuel cells, metal-air batteries and so on, catalysts of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode play a vital role in the technologies. The ORR catalyst to a large extent determines the energy conversion efficiency and is responsible for the high cost of the fuel cells/batteries,1–6 and thus nowadays, the sluggish ORR on the cathode has become the main bottleneck for the elaboration of such devices.7 Platinum (Pt) or platinum alloys are the state-of-the-art ORR electrocatalysts.8–11 Owing to the high cost of Pt and declining activity, alternative cheap catalysts with high activity have been actively pursued.12–22 Despite tremendous efforts, developing ORR electrocatalysts with high activity at low cost remains a great challenge. However, it has been shown that the cheapest precious metal, silver (Ag), exhibits reasonable activity and stability with a price only about 2% that of Pt, rendering it as an attractive ORR catalyst.6,23–25 It is well known that the electro-catalytic activities strongly depend on the nanostructure of the catalyst. Compared with 0-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles, 1D Ag nanowires (NWs) show better electro-catalytic activities but are still far from satisfactory.25–28 The low aspect ratio of such Ag NWs may be the main reason for low activities. Thus, a 2D Ag nanonet (NN) that is constructed by self-weaving of ultra-long Ag NWs with high aspect ratio may show even better electro-catalytic performance because of better electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as electro-catalytic stability compared with the 0D and 1D nanostructures. Also, due to their lower vulnerability to aggregation, dissolution and Ostwald ripening, Ag NNs may become a novel kind of electrocatalyst for the ORR with good performance.Furthermore, to maximize the electro-catalytic activity of the catalyst, a suitable carbon support is required to disperse the catalyst as well as to accelerate the migration rate of the electrons. Since their discovery by Novoselov et al.,29 graphene nanosheets (GNSs), with an atomically thin 2D lattice of sp2 carbon atoms packed into a dense honeycomb and characterized as “the thinnest known material in the universe and the strongest ever measured”, have been considered as a “rising star” material due to their unique structure and properties, such as high surface-to-volume ratio, high electrical conductivity, high electron transfer rate, and exceptional thermal stability.30 Thus it is not a surprise that graphene composites decorated with various metals or metal oxide catalysts, as well as graphene itself, have aroused tremendous interest as novel ORR catalysts.31 As a result, it is important to construct Ag NN/GNS nanohybrids that may show enhanced electro-catalytic activities toward the ORR. However, to the best of our knowledge, this topic has not been addressed to date. Some recent reports in the literature have dealt with the preparation of Ag NW/graphene nanohybrids.32–34 Nevertheless, all of them were prepared under harsh conditions (for example, with high temperature and high pressure), with tedious and multi-step procedures, and are hard to scale up. Also, because of the low aspect ratio of the prepared Ag NWs, no silver nanonet was formed. Taking into account their further potential application in the energy industry, it is desirable to develop a green, mild, facile, large-scale and effective route for preparing Ag NN/GNS nanohybrids.Recently, it has been reported that polyoxometalates (POMs), the early transition metal oxygen anionic clusters, can be used as effective reducing agents to reduce metal ions and graphene oxide (GO) in one pot.35 Herein, we report for the first time a POM-mediated green, facile and large-scale synthesis of 2D Ag NN/GNS nanohybrids. It is demonstrated that the prepared nanohybrids show enhanced electro-catalytic activities toward the ORR.2 Experimental2.1 MaterialsAg2SO4 (analytical grade) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company and was used as received. DMF was purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagents Corporation (Analytic grade) and was also used as received. The MoV/MoVI mixed-valence POM H7[β-PMoV4MoVI8O40] was prepared by the reported method.36 All other reagents were of analytical grade. Ultrapure water purified with a Milli-Q (MQ) plus system (Millipore Co.) with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was exclusively used in all aqueous solutions and rinsing procedures.2.2 Synthesis of nanohybrids of Ag NN@POM-GNSsGO was oxidized from natural graphite (NG) flakes by a modified Hummers method using H2SO4, NaNO3 and KMnO4 in an ice bath.37 The resulting homogeneous brown GO dispersion was tested to be stable for several months and used for reduction. In a typical synthesis, an aqueous solution of H7[β-PMoV4MoVI8O40] (1 ml, 0.5 mM) was mixed with an aqueous solution of Ag2SO4 (80 μL, 25 mM) and GO (10 μL, 5 mg ml−1). After soft shaking by hand, the mixed solution was allowed to stand for 12 h. The color of the solution turned from deep blue to green and finally to almost transparent (see Fig. S1‡ for the digital graph). The whole reaction was performed at room temperature and ambient pressure. After aging for 12 h statically, the ternary nanohybrids sank down to the bottom of the reactor, forming a smooth, dense and uniform film. Thus the Ag NN@POM–GNS nanohybrids were obtained. The Ag NN@POM was prepared with the same method without adding GO.2.3 Sample preparationFor preparation of samples of the nanohybrids, the substrate was put at the bottom of a 10 ml beaker before reaction and the nanohybrids would deposit on it forming a dense film after 12 h of aging. The nanohybrids can deposit on various substrates including glass slides, silicon wafers, glassy carbon (GC) and so on. All these samples were rinsed several times with anhydrous ethanol before characterization.2.4 CharacterizationsThe scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed on a Hitachi model S-4300 FESEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) with a Krato, AXIS-HS monochromatized Al Kα cathode source, at 75–150 W, using a low energy electron gun for charge neutralization. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed on a Bruker AXS D advance powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα (λ = 0.15418 nm). Raman spectra were obtained with a Renishaw Raman system model 1000 spectrometer. The 532 nm radiation from a 20 mW air-cooled argon ion laser was used as the excitation source. The laser diameter was 1 μm, and the laser power at the sample position was 4.0 mW. The data acquisition time was 10 s. The composition of catalysts was determined using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, ICPE-9000, SHIMADZU).2.5 Electrochemistry experimentsFor preparation of a modified electrode with the nanohybrids, a special reactor was designed (see Fig. S2a‡ for the digital graph). The GC electrode with a pre-polished GC disk (3 mm in diameter, with an area of 0.07 cm2) can just be inserted into the bottom part of the reactor. After the reaction, the nanohybrids would sink down onto the surface of the electrode (see Fig. S2b‡ for the digital graphs). After the nanohybrids were stuck to the electrode, the electrode was stored in air and dried at room temperature. It was then rinsed with anhydrous ethanol several times, and 5 μL of a Nafion solution (0.5%) in isopropanol was dropped into as a binder. The commercial Pt/C 10% (10 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72) with the same catalyst amount as that of Ag NN@POM–GNSs was used for comparison. Electrochemical experiments were performed on a ZAHNER ZENNIUM electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER Instrument Inc., Germany). A standard three-electrode cell was used and was controlled at room temperature during the experiment. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode in all measurements and was calibrated with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)31b (see ESI and Fig. S3‡ for details). A Pt foil (3.0 cm2) was used as the counter electrode. The prepared thin film GC disk electrode was used as the working electrode. The electrolyte, consisting of a solution of 0.1 M NaOH, was saturated with ultrahigh-purity Ar for 30 min before cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The oxygen reduction experiment was performed by saturating with ultrahigh-purity O2 for 30 min before CV measurements. The steady state polarization measurements for the ORR were obtained using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique.3 Results and discussionThe nanohybrid described herein is obtained starting from Ag+, GO and the reduced POM H7[β-PMoV4MoVI8O40], in aqueous medium at room temperature. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the POM serves as both a reducing and capping molecule for the NN and GNSs, and a bridging molecule, affording the ternary Ag NN@POM–GNS 2D nanohybrid. The cross-section shows a Ag core and POM film shell structure. The reduction of Ag+ and GO by the POM compound and the assembly of the obtained Ag NN on the surface of the GNSs were therefore accomplished in one step. It should be noted that about 95% of the POM can be recycled and reused after the reaction. Scheme 1  Preparation procedure for the polyoxometalate-mediated green, facile and large-scale synthesis of 2D Ag NN/GNS nanohybrids. The structure of the hybrid was examined by SEM and TEM. The samples were washed with anhydrous ethanol several times before subsequent characterizations. Fig. 1 shows the typical SEM and TEM images of the prepared ternary Ag NN@POM–GNS nanohybrid. Fig. 1a shows a large-scale field-emission SEM (FESEM) image of the Ag NN@POM–GNS nanohybrid. It can be observed that Ag networks were formed by self-weaving of Ag NWs with lengths largely exceeding 100 μm. The TEM image of these NWs shows an average diameter of ∼40–50 nm (Fig. 1b). The aspect ratio of the nanowires reaches exceedingly larger values than 2000, which is very favorable for the enhancement of the conductivity and the surface area. What is more, the typical TEM images of the transparent thin graphene sheets with crumpled silk veil waves spreading under the Ag NN are clearly observed in Fig. 1b and also more obvious in the inserted picture of Fig. 1b. A magnified image of an Ag NW suggests an Ag@POM core–shell structure for the NWs. A thin layer of POM with about 1.1 nm thickness is clearly observed in Fig. 1c, in accordance with previous studies devoted to the elaboration of Ag@POM nanosystems.38,39 Also, related materials have been obtained when synthesized in the presence of a high concentration of PVP.40 It has also been reported that the POM shell could not be thoroughly removed due to a very strong interaction between the POM and the Ag NWs, with the polyanion forming a stable monolayer on the surface of the nanowires.38 Besides, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of a single Ag NW (Fig. 1d) and the electronic diffraction (ED) of the nanowires, shown in the inset of Fig. 1d, demonstrate their high crystallinity, which agree well with the previously reported results for nanowires.41,42In situ energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis in Fig. S4‡ shows that there exist peaks of molybdenum and silver, confirming the existence of the POM around Ag NN/GNSs (the strong peaks of Cu are from the copper grid). Fig. 1  (a) Typical SEM image of as-obtained Ag NN@POM–GNSs. (b) TEM image of Ag NN@POM–GNSs, and the inset is a magnified picture. (c) Magnified TEM image of core–shell Ag NW@POM structures. (d) HRTEM of one Ag NW, and the inset shows the electronic diffraction of the nanowires. The nanohybrids were further characterized by XRD, XPS and Raman spectra. An XRD pattern of NG, GO and Ag NN@POM–GNSs is displayed in Fig. 2. It can be observed that the NG shows a sharp diffraction peak at 26.5° corresponding to the (002) plane with a d-spacing of 0.336 nm. Compared with NG, the feature diffraction peak of GO appeared at 11.2° corresponding to the C (002) interlayer spacing of 0.790 nm.43 The increase in the d value of GO can be due to the evolution of 0.336 nm spacing between typical graphene sheets in graphite to integrate the water molecules trapped between oxygen containing functional groups in GO sheets. The absence of any peak at a 2θ value of 26.5° reveals the complete oxidation of NG.44 The XRD pattern recorded from a dry film of Ag NN@POM–GNS hybrids fixed on a glass slide clearly shows the (111), (200), and (220) Bragg reflections of the face centered cubic (fcc) of silver with intensity ratios in good agreement with a preferential growth of nanowires along the 〈111〉 direction. This is in agreement with previous studies,45 showing that PVP, used as the shape controller, strongly interacts with (100) facets of Ag nanoparticles, thus favoring their growth into nanowires along the 〈111〉 direction. What is more, after the GO was reduced by the POM, the sharp peak of GO at 11.2° almost disappeared and became a broader peak at around 20–30°,46 meaning the layers of NG along the c-axis were exfoliated and the carbon sp2 bonds were restored. Fig. 2  XRD patterns of NG, GO and the as-prepared Ag NN@POM–GNSs. XPS was used to further verify the as-synthesized nanohybrids. It is a very useful way to confirm the reduction of GO by detecting the constitutional change of carbon atoms in different chemical states before and after reduction. Fig. 3 shows the C 1s XPS spectra of GO and Ag NN@POM–GNSs. Four types of carbon with different chemical states can be easily observed from GO (Fig. 3a), which appear at 284.8 eV for graphite-like C, 286.8 eV for C–O, 287.8 eV for CO and 289.0 eV for O–CO, respectively. After it was reduced by the POM (Fig. 3b), the content of the C–O group decreases from initial 47.2% to 23.2% (shown in Table 1), indicating that the POM can effectively eliminate the oxygen containing groups on GO. Meanwhile, the content of the C–C/CC group increased from 46.1% to 76.7%, indicating that significant sp3/sp2-hybridized carbon structures were restored.

SamplesGraphite-like CC–OCOO–COGO284.8 (46.1%)286.8 (47.2%)287.8 (6.43%)289.0 (0.27%)Ag NN@POM–GNSs284.8 (76.7%)286.8 (23.2%)287.8 (0)288.6 (0.1%)The oxidation state of silver in the NN attached onto GNSs and the presence of molybdenum were also determined by XPS as shown in Fig. 3. The XPS spectrum of the as-prepared Ag NN@POM–GNS nanohybrids shows the Ag 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 doublet (Fig. 3c). With the charge effect corrected by fixing the photoelectric peak 1s of carbon at 284.8 eV, the 3d5/2 level is located at 368.2 ± 0.3 eV and the 3d3/2 level at 374.2 ± 0.3 eV. These values suggest unambiguously that silver is present only in the metallic form. The presence of molybdenum was also detected, despite the thorough washing of the samples. As shown in Fig. 3d, two valence states were found, i.e. MoV (3d5/2 and 3d3/2 respectively at 231.9 ± 0.3 eV and 234.5 ± 0.3 eV) and MoVI (3d5/2 and 3d3/2 respectively at 232.9 ± 0.3 eV and 236.0 ± 0.3 eV). However, MoVI is the much more abundant of the two species, indicating that most of the MoV has been oxidized to MoVI.Raman spectroscopy provides important information on the structural properties of carbonaceous materials, including disorder and defect structures. The Raman spectra of the GO and as-prepared Ag NN@POM–GNSs were recorded to further confirm the reduction of GO by the POM (Fig. 4). In both cases, two fundamental vibrations, which are attributed to the G (∼1600 cm−1) and D (∼1350 cm−1) bands, respectively, are observed. It was reported that the G band corresponds to the first-order scattering of the E2g mode from the sp2 carbon domains and the D band is a breathing mode or k-point photons of A1g symmetry originating from the disorder-induced mode associated with structural defects and imperfections.47 The intensity ratio of D and G bands, ID/IG, is a measure of disorder degree and average size of the sp2 domains. It is shown that the ID/IG of Ag NN@POM–GNSs decreased from initial 0.923 of GO to 0.791, indicating that the reduction of GO indeed increased the average size of the crystalline graphene domains due to the graphitic “self-healing” in the hybrids.48 Fig. 4  Raman spectra of GO and as-prepared Ag NN@POM–GNSs. The ORR was selected as a preliminary test of the promising electrocatalytic behaviors of the prepared nanohybrids. The reduction of O2 in alkaline solutions can be proceeded by the following two overall pathways:49,50(1) Direct O2 reduction to OH− ions, what is called the direct four-electron pathway (1): O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−(1)(2) Or O2 reduction to HO2− ions, what is called the two-electron pathway (2): O2 + H2O + 2e− → HO2− + OH−(2)followed by either a further two-electron reduction of peroxide ions to OH− ions (3): HO2− + H2O + 2e− → 3OH−(3)or the decomposition reaction (4): 2HO2− → 2OH− + O2(4)For comparison, the catalytic properties of the binary Ag NN@POM (a typical TEM image is shown in Fig. S5‡) were also examined. The electro-catalytic properties of the nanohybrids were initially evaluated by CV. Fig. 5 shows representative CVs of Ag NWs@POM and Ag NWs@POM–GNS films in Ar saturated 0.1 M NaOH solution in the potential range of +0.02 to +1.62 V vs. RHE, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The Ag loading masses, determined by ICP, were 1.59 × 10−2 mg and 1.32 × 10−2 mg for Ag NWs@POM and Ag NWs@POM–GNSs respectively. It can be seen that both electrodes have similar voltammetric characteristics. In the potential range from +1.12 to +1.62 V vs. RHE, the CVs feature three oxidation peaks including two close spaced peaks (i and ii) and a main anodic peak (iii), located at ca. +1.204, +1.284, and +1.424 V vs. RHE, respectively. Peak (i) is due to the silver dissolution and the formation of a surface monolayer of either Ag2O or AgOH films,51 while peaks (ii) and (iii) are associated with the formation of bulk phases of AgOH and Ag2O, respectively.3,52 In the reverse potential scan, the cathodic current peak at ca. +0.974 V vs. RHE (peak (iv)) was ascribed to the electroreduction of the silver oxides formed during the forward potential scan.52 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms of Ag NN@POM (a) and Ag NN@POM–GNS (b) modified electrodes in Ar-saturated 0.1 M NaOH solution. Potential scan rate was 50 mV s−1. In order to avoid the interference of silver oxide reduction on oxygen molecule reduction, a narrow potential window (from +0.02 to +1.12 V vs. RHE) was applied in the studies of the ORR. Fig. 6 displays the CVs of the GC electrodes modified with the Ag NN@POM or the Ag NN@POM–GNS hybrids, in 0.1 M NaOH solution, which were saturated with Ar or O2 during the experiment. It is clearly shown that both the nanohybrids exhibit electro-catalytic activities toward the ORR in the O2-saturated solution by comparison with experiments carried under Ar-saturated medium. The main characteristics which can be measured from such voltammograms include the faradaic current onset potential (Eonset), the potential of the cathodic peak current (Epc) and the cathodic peak current density (ipc). Values relative to the ORR obtained with the binary Ag NN@POM modified electrode (Fig. 6a) are Eonset = +0.874 V vs. RHE; Epc = +0.474 V vs. RHE; and ipc = −0.427 mA cm−2. Comparison of these values with the corresponding ones measured with the ternary Ag NN@POM–GNS nanohybrids (Fig. 6b) shows that both the Eonset and Epc shift positively to +0.924 V vs. RHE and +0.674 V vs. RHE respectively, with a concomitant increase of ipc (−0.557 mA cm−2). Such observations clearly indicate that the ORR electro-catalytic activity of the ternary Ag NN@POM–GNS nanohybrids is much better than that of the binary Ag NN@POM. The better performance of the ternary nanohybrids can be attributed to the following two major factors: (i) the highly conductive GNSs connect the silver NN and improve the charge transfer between the modifying layer and the substrate GC electrode; (ii) a synergistic effect of the well-defined Ag NN and GNSs is beneficial to their electro-catalytic activities. Fig. 6  Cyclic voltammetry curves of the ORR on Ag NN@POM (a) and Ag NN@POM–GNSs (b) in Ar (black curves)- and O2 (red curves)-saturated 0.1 M NaOH solutions at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Cyclic voltammetry curves for the influence of methanol over Ag NN@POM–GNSs in O2 saturated 0.1 M NaOH/0.5 M methanol solutions at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (c). In a traditional alkaline alcohol fuel cell, alcohol can block some active sites of the Pt nanomaterials, leading to some loss of the activity. Therefore, the effect of methanol on the electroactivity of Ag NN@POM–GNSs towards the ORR was investigated. Fig. 6c shows the CV patterns of the ORR in the O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH solution with and without methanol. It is worth noting that methanol did not have any negative effect on the electro-catalytic ORR. This indicates that despite working in the methanol-tolerant solution, the prepared nanohybrids still exhibit high electroactivity.In order to establish the extent to which each of the two pathways mentioned above is involved at a particular electrode surface, the RDE experiment was performed and the Koutecky–Levich equation was used to further study the catalysis of the prepared nanohybrids for the kinetics of the ORR. Fig. 7a and c show the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the ORR at various rotation rates for Ag NN@POM and Ag NN@POM–GNSs in an O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. As can be seen, the limiting current density increases with increasing rotation rate. It further verifies that the limiting current densities obtained from the ternary Ag NN@POM–GNS electrode are higher than those at the binary Ag NN@POM electrode at a constant rotation rate. Fig. 7b and d are the Koutecky–Levich plots for these two electrode materials at various potentials, which show a linear relationship between j−1 and ω−0.5. The Koutecky–Levich equation given below was used to determine the transferred electron number per oxygen molecule involved in the oxygen reduction at each of the electrodes:14 (5)where j is the measured current density at a given potential, jk is the kinetic current density, and ω is the electrode rotating rate. Therefore, 1/B is the calculated slope and its unit is mA−1 cm2 rpm0.5. B could be determined from the slope of Koutecky–Levich plots (Fig. 7b and d) based on the Levich equation as follows:12 (6)where n represents the number of electrons transferred per oxygen molecule, F is the Faraday constant (F = 96485 C mol−1), DO2 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in 0.1 M NaOH (1.9 × 10−5 cm2 s−1), v is the kinetic viscosity (0.01 cm2 s−1), and CO2 is the bulk concentration of O2 (1.2 × 10−6 mol cm−3). The constant 0.2 is adopted when the rotation speed is expressed in rpm.12 The number of electrons transferred for the ORR on the two electrodes calculated from the slopes of the Koutecky–Levich plots at various potentials is shown in Table S1.‡ It can be clearly observed that the number of electrons transferred per O2 molecule (n) was calculated to be ∼4 for both the Ag NN@POM and Ag NN@POM–GNS electrodes. It illustrates that the oxygen reduction on both of these electrocatalysts mainly proceeded by a pathway of four-electron transfer (from +0.60 to +0.25 V vs. RHE). This indicates to some extent that the as-synthesized well-defined Ag NN showed high ORR electro-catalytic activity, besides having a more negative onset potential compared with the ternary Ag NN@POM–GNSs. Also, the Ag NN@POM–GNS ternary nanohybrid, which has both the high catalytic activity of a Ag NN and the excellent electron transfer properties of GNSs as well as their synergistic effect, showed a more efficient electrocatalytic ORR than the Ag NN@POM electrode with a more positive onset potential and higher current densities. Thus the comparison shows that Ag NN@POM–GNSs have high potential to be used as catalysts in electro-catalytic ORR. Fig. 7  Linear sweep voltammetry curves of the ORR at various rotation rates at Ag NN@POM (a) and Ag NN@POM–GNSs (c) in O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH solutions at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. (b) and (d) are the Koutecky–Levich plots for (a) and (c) at various potentials, respectively. For comparison, we further carried out the LSV measurements on a RDE for each of the electrode materials, including the above two nanohybrids and the commercial Pt/C catalyst (it has the same catalyst amount as that of Ag NN@POM–GNSs), in O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. As can be seen from Fig. 8a, the limiting diffusion current density of the Ag NN@POM–GNS modified electrode was higher than that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst at potentials below +0.6 V vs. RHE, although the ORR onset potential was still lower than that of the Pt/C catalyst (1.025 V vs. RHE). Thus, our results should be sufficiently promising to warrant further research efforts in developing novel low cost ORR catalysts. Fig. 8  (a) Comparison of linear sweep voltammetry curves of the ORR in O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH solutions at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The rotation rate is 1600 rpm. (b) Current–time (i–t) chronoamperometric response of Ag NN@POM–GNS and Pt/C modified GC electrodes at 0.67 V vs. RHE in O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. Since durability is one of the major concerns in the current fuel cell/battery technology, the reduction peak currents of Ag NN@POM–GNSs and commercial Pt/C were measured at a constant voltage of +0.67 V vs. RHE for 20000 s in a 0.1 M NaOH solution saturated with O2 at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm (Fig. 8b). It should be noted that the corresponding current–time chronoamperometric response of the Ag NN@POM–GNS modified electrode exhibited a relatively slow attenuation, and a much higher relative current of 74.0% still persisted compared with that of Pt/C (41.0%) after 20000 s. This result indicates that the durability of Ag NN@POM–GNS nanohybrids is superior to that of the traditional Pt catalysts.It should be noted that in alkaline media, POMs are not stable.53–56 Thus, it can be anticipated that the POM entities constituting the nanohybrids reported here evolve during the ORR experiments. This was confirmed by the CV characteristics of the deposited POM in 0.5 M H2SO4 (VH2O:VN,N-dimethylformamide(DMF) = 1:1) before and after ORR (Fig. S6‡). It can be clearly observed that there are obvious characteristic features of the POM redox systems (from 0 to +0.4 V vs. SCE) for both the Ag NN@POM and Ag NN@POM–GNS modified electrodes before the ORR. However, after the ORR, the characteristic peaks of the POM redox systems for the Ag NN@POM modified electrode almost disappeared, while for the Ag NN@POM–GNS modified electrode, these peaks remained to some extent. What is more, the morphologies of both the Ag NN@POM and Ag NN@POM–GNS hybrids after the electro-catalytic ORR were tested, both of which show hardly any change compared with that before the ORR (Fig. S7‡). Thus, it can be hypothesized that the superior catalytic activities of the ternary nanohybrids toward the ORR may be mostly attributed to a synergistic effect of the Ag NN and GNSs reinforced by the presence of residual POM units and fragments arising from their decomposition.4 ConclusionsIn conclusion, novel 2D Ag NN-decorated GNSs were prepared using a MoV/MoVI mixed-valence POM as both reducing agent and bridge molecules. This synthesis represents a green, facile and large-scale approach. The prepared Ag NN@POM–GNS nanohybrids showed high electro-catalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction because of the high catalytic activity of the Ag NN and the excellent electron transfer properties of GNSs, and also their synergistic effect, reinforced by the presence of residual POM units and fragments arising from their decomposition. What is more, these hybrid films may find other potential applications in energy fields, such as electrode materials for solar cells.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 21071146, 51002155), the National High Technology Research and Development Program (“863”) (no. 2012AA062903) and the University Paris-Sud 11 (UMR 8000, CNRS) France and the Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin (UMR 8180, CNRS).ReferencesF.
