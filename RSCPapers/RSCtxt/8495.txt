    , Accepted 11th September 2015First published on 14th September 2015AbstractCost-effective carbonaceous allotropes other than fullerene (i.e. carbon quantum dots or C-dots), ZnO nanoparticles and their nanocomposites were synthesized as alternatives to expensive fullerene in polymer-based bulk heterojunction solar cells. A facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal route was used to synthesize nanomaterials in a short time span along with inexpensive precursors to reduce the cost. Taking into account the cost-to-performance ratio, devices were fabricated in direct configuration as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PFO-DBT:ZnO (or C-dots, Z@G, Z@Cdots)/Al followed by device optimization to obtain optimized device parameters. The devices exhibit significant short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The best power conversion efficiency of 3.9% with Jsc of 14.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.82 V and fill factor of 32% was obtained with Z@Cdots as acceptor at active layer concentration of 40 mg ml−1 and weight ratio of 1:1. In addition, the phase analysis of the active-layer interface demonstrates the better compatibility of the organic:organic phase (i.e. polymer:C-dots with a device PCE of 2.8%) as compared to the organic:inorganic phase (i.e. polymer:ZnO with a device PCE of 1.41%). Moreover, the best performance of the organic:hybrid phase (i.e. polymer:Z@Cdots with a device PCE of 3.9%) is due to the exploitation of properties of both organic and inorganic components on the same platform. C-dots as an acceptor give an overall power conversion efficiency of 2.8%, whereas Z@G resulted in an efficiency of 3.1%. A fullerene-based device gives an efficiency of 4.2% (just 0.3% more in comparison to Z@Cdots), but the difference in material cost is more than 50 times, which thus results in a significant improvement in the cost-to-performance ratio of a Z@Cdots-based device than a device using fullerene as an acceptor. Therefore, the developed carbonaceous nanomaterials act as potential acceptors in non-fullerene-based polymer solar cells for possible applications.
Introduction
At present, a considerable amount of research is inclined toward potential alternatives for diminishing stocks of fossil fuels. Inexhaustible renewable resources can act as the best possible alternatives. The enormous amount of solar energy reaching the earth's surface alone can fulfil the world's ever-increasing demand for energy. Solar cells are devices that convert solar energy directly into electricity. In this direction, lot of studies have already been carried out on silicon (Si)-based solar cells. Silicon technology occupies nearly 75–80% of the solar market due to its significant efficiency and stability. However, the high cost of silicon technology, which results from the requirement of highly pure silicon wafers and expensive processing technology, creates an obstacle. The high cost-to-performance ratio deprives poor communities the benefit of silicon technology.1,2 Keeping in mind the cost-to-performance ratio of solar cells, the scientific community is looking for other cost-effective options. This has given rise to different generations of solar cells (silicon solar cells, thin-film solar cells, organic solar cells, hybrid solar cells, etc.). Among these, organic photovoltaic (OPV) appears to be the most attractive option because OPV is a sustainable, clean and green technology.3–8 Moreover, OPV is very cost-effective, owing to the utilization of solution-processable organic semiconductors, quite low consumption of materials (due to the high absorption coefficient of polymers), high-throughput processing, abundance and light weight (easily portable and flexible).9–11 Although researchers have achieved significant progress in OPV technology, the commercialization of OPV devices is not yet possible due to the lack of significant power conversion efficiency and stability.12–16 To overcome these issues, efforts have been made to develop new economical nanostructured materials with tailored properties to achieve a significantly lower cost-to-performance ratio along with stability against atmospheric oxygen and water. Usually, organic solar cells comprise conjugated polymers (which contribute to photon absorption to produce excited states) as a donor and fullerenes as an acceptor.17–20 Fullerenes undergo very fast photoinduced electron transfer in conjugation with a polymer, making them efficient acceptors in OPV.21 However, at the same time, fullerenes do not participate in absorption of the solar spectrum and are not considerably cost-effective and stable in nature.22 Studies have already been carried out to replace fullerenes with other nanostructured materials that are quite cost-effective, possess favourable properties, are stable and act as potential acceptors. In the same direction, this study reports the synthesis of some materials and their application as acceptors in OPV. As an inorganic semiconducting material, zinc oxide (ZnO) appears to be the most appealing material in comparison to toxic lead and cadmium (as we are also looking for environment friendly materials).23 In addition, its occurrence in a large number of morphologies, good charge carrier mobility, high stability, abundance, non-toxicity and low cost makes it a very viable option.24–28 Furthermore, the effect of other nanostructured carbon-based materials would be interesting to observe.29 Thus, carbon quantum dots (C-dots) were synthesized because they are highly conductive in nature, provide a conducting network for electrons and act as acceptors.30–33 The application of organic C-dots and inorganic ZnO as acceptors helps in observing the phase effect at the interface of the active layer. In addition, new hybrids of ZnO with graphene and C-dots were also synthesized as ZnO-decorated graphene (Z@G) and nanocomposite of ZnO with C-dots (Z@Cdots), respectively. Among ZnO, C-dots, Z@G and Z@Cdots, very few studies have been reported on Z@Cdots (from a photovoltaic perspective); thus, in this study more attention has been paid to Z@Cdots. In the case of Z@Cdots, it is expected that the hybridization of ZnO with C-dots may result in electronic coupling between conduction band states of ZnO and pi-states of graphitic C-dots. Moreover, C-dots that are attached to the surface of ZnO will allow charge separation owing to the edge effect in C-dots.34 The generated electrons will shuttle through the conducting C-dots layer, while holes will pass from ZnO to the polymer and finally to the respective electrode through a buffer layer.35,36 The improved charge transportation and suppressed charge recombination will lead to more efficient devices.
The novelty of this study lies in the time-efficient synthesis of high-quality nanostructures via a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal route. A microwave-assisted hydrothermal method has been specifically chosen because it results in the synthesis of monodisperse nanomaterials with high homogeneity. Moreover, during the synthesis of the hybrid, the properties of individual components will not be impaired; therefore, the hybrid possesses the properties of individual components. Hydrophobic ZnO nanoparticles, C-dots, Z@G and Z@Cdots have been synthesized successfully. To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis of a Z@Cdots nanocomposite in such a short time span has been reported for the first time. Owing to hydrophobicity, the synthesized nanomaterials form a uniform blend with the conjugated polymer and cast a smooth and undisrupted active layer during device fabrication. Devices were fabricated successfully using the synthesized nanomaterials as an acceptor in polymer-based bulk heterojunction solar cells. At the same time, for a comparative study with fullerene, a fullerene-based device was also fabricated at optimized weight ratio and overall concentration of the active layer. The best device in the case of non-fullerene-based solar cells was obtained with Z@Cdots with an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.9%, whereas with fullerene, an efficiency of 4.2% was obtained (a very small difference of 0.3%). It is interesting to observe that the short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage of the Z@Cdots-based device are higher than with fullerene. However, the reason for the lower PCE of the Z@Cdots-based device is a lower fill factor of 32% in comparison to 50% with fullerene. Moreover, the material synthesized in the laboratory is nearly 50 times more economical than the fullerene that was procured, which ultimately gives rise to an overall improvement in the cost-to-performance ratio of the Z@Cdots-based device compared to the fullerene-based device. The study reported here has not been reported earlier with such significant performance. The study reported in this manuscript will open up new avenues for utilizing Z@Cdots as an efficient acceptor in OSC. More studies can be carried out to obtain much better results using inverted and tandem architecture. In addition, Z@Cdots can also be utilized as a buffer layer in organic solar cells rather than pure ZnO.
Experimental procedure
Materials used
The chemicals used for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, C-dots, Z@G and Z@Cdots nanocomposite were zinc acetate dihydrate (500 g for 1500 rupees), potassium hydroxide (500 g for 1600 rupees), D-glucose (100 g for 3000 rupees), octadecylamine (ODA; 25 g for 5000 rupees), chloroform, methanol and dichloromethane; all the chemicals were purchased from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich. RGO was procured from ACS Materials.
Synthesis

ZnO. 
A microwave-assisted hydrothermal method was used to synthesize hydrophobic ZnO nanoparticles. First, 0.6 g of zinc acetate was dissolved in 20 ml methanol along with 10 ml distilled water at 60 °C. A solution containing 0.3 g of KOH in 13 ml of methanol was added slowly to the zinc acetate solution. Then, 22 ml of the final precursor was poured into a glass tube of 30 ml capacity and placed in a Teflon-lined microwave reactor at 160 °C for half an hour. White-coloured precipitates (as shown in Fig. 2) obtained after completion of the reaction were washed and centrifuged at 8000 rpm, followed by annealing at 100 °C for an hour to obtain ZnO nanoparticles. The synthesized ZnO nanoparticles exhibit a hydrophobic nature and give a clear and stable dispersion in chloroform using methanol as co-solvent.

Z@G. 
Hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO anchored on graphene was carried out by dissolving 5 mg of commercial RGO in 10 ml of ethanol followed by ultrasonication for 10–15 minutes. A precursor of ZnO was prepared by dissolving 0.6 g of zinc acetate in 20 ml methanol and 10 ml distilled water at 60 °C. Then, 0.3 g of KOH dissolved in methanol was added slowly to the zinc acetate solution with stirring. RGO solution was added to the ZnO precursor and ultrasonicated for 10–15 minutes. Then, 25 ml of the solution was placed in a microwave reactor at 160 °C for an hour. Greyish-coloured precipitates obtained on completion of the reaction were washed, centrifuged and annealed to obtain Z@G nanocomposite (as shown in Fig. 2). The as-synthesized Z@G nanocomposite exhibits a stable and homogeneous solution in chloroform and ethanol (in a volume ratio of 9:1).


C-dots. 
C-dots were synthesized via the carbonization of a carbohydrate (D-glucose) in the presence of a long alkyl chain-based amine (ODA). First, 80 mg of D-glucose and 0.4 g of ODA were heated at 100 °C for approximately 15 minutes to obtain a brown-coloured liquid, which solidified on cooling at room temperature. Chloroform was used to extract C-dots, leaving behind white-coloured ODA. Further purification was carried out by column chromatography using silica as the stationary phase and methanol and dichloromethane as the mobile phase. C-dots give a good dispersion in chloroform and exhibit bright bluish luminescence under UV light. The hydrophobic nature of the as-synthesized C-dots is due to the presence of the long-chain amine. The final C-dots in powdered form are shown in Fig. 2 and weigh approximately 100 mg.


Z@Cdots. 
A zinc oxide and carbon-based nanocomposite was synthesized via a facile and time-efficient microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. A ZnO precursor was prepared using zinc acetate, KOH, methanol and distilled water (as already mentioned in the Z@G synthesis). Then, 20 mg of C-dots was dissolved in 5 ml of chloroform and was added slowly to the ZnO precursor with stirring. Then, 22 ml of the final solution was poured into a glass tube of 30 ml capacity and placed in a microwave reactor. The reaction temperature was set to 140 °C and the reaction was carried out for 30 minutes. On completion of the reaction, light brown-coloured precipitates were obtained, which were washed, centrifuged and finally annealed for an hour at 100 °C to obtain a Z@Cdots nanocomposite. The nanocomposite exhibits a good and clear dispersion in chloroform with methanol as co-solvent (in a volume ratio of 8:2). Under UV light, the dispersed Z@Cdots exhibit bright yellowish luminescence. The process flow for the synthesis of Z@Cdots is shown in Fig. 1, whereas variations in pressure, power and temperature during the reaction are illustrated in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†
It is worth mentioning that, to obtain approximately 500 mg of C-dots, 400 mg of D-glucose and 1.6 g of ODA were required, which hardly cost 1000 rupees, including the chemicals used for purification. Similarly, for ZnO nanoparticles, the cost of the materials that were consumed is even less than 300 rupees. Thus, to obtain 500 mg of Z@Cdots nanocomposite, the material consumption has a maximum cost of 1500 rupees. Moreover, the hydrothermal route used for synthesis is a very time-efficient, simple one-step reaction that does not need any ambient conditions and requires only a microwave reactor. On the other hand, the cost of 500 mg of fullerene procured from Sigma Aldrich is nearly 80000 rupees.

Characterization
To investigate the crystal structure and phase of the synthesized nanomaterials, XRD (X-ray diffraction) was performed using a D8-Advance XRD (Bruker) with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength, λ = 1.54 Å) at a scan rate of 0.02° s−1 and a slit width of 0.1 mm. TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy) measurements for the analysis of morphology and particle size were performed using a Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin instrument at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Absorption spectra were recorded by a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–1100 nm. Photoluminescence spectra were obtained by a Perkin-Elmer LF55 spectrophotometer with a xenon source. Functional groups were determined by Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR) using a Nicolet 5700 in transmission mode in the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1. To determine the extent of graphitic structure and disorder in carbonaceous nanomaterials, Raman scattering was performed using a Renishaw inVia Reflex spectrometer (UK) with an excitation source at 514.5 nm having a resolution less than 1.0 cm−1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to determine the roughness of the active layer of fabricated solar cells by a multimode AFM with a Nanoscope V controller (Veeco, USA) in tapping mode. Contact angles were measured via a drop shape analysis system (DSA10MK2; Krüss GmbH, Germany) to observe hydrophobic nature of the synthesized nanomaterials. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated bulk heterojunction solar cells were measured with a class AAA solar simulator (Sol3A; Oriel, Newport, USA) equipped with a xenon lamp used as a light source under standard test conditions (STC).
Device fabrication
Non-fullerene-based bulk heterojunction solar cells using the polymer PFO-DBT as the donor and the as-synthesized nanomaterials as the acceptor were fabricated in direct configuration having the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PFO-DBT:ZnO (or C-dots, Z@G, Z@Cdots)/Al. To obtain optimized performance parameters, devices with an active area of 0.1 cm2 were fabricated by varying the overall concentration of the PFO-DBT:Z@Cdots blend along with the weight ratio of PFO-DBT and Z@Cdots. Similarly, to perform phase analysis of organic:organic, organic:inorganic and organic:hybrid phases at the donor:acceptor interface of the active layer, devices were fabricated with PFO-DBT:ZnO, PFO-DBT:C-dots and PFO-DBT:Z@G (or Z@Cdots) at an overall concentration of 40 mg ml−1 and a weight ratio of 1:1. ITO-coated glass that was used as the bottom electrode was cleaned using soap solution, followed by ultrasonication in acetone, and then by boiling in propanol for nearly 5 minutes. A layer of PEDOT:PSS was coated over the ITO at 2000 rpm, which acted as a buffer layer for hole transportation. The active layer was spin-coated over the PEDOT:PSS layer at 800 rpm under ambient conditions. Aluminium was deposited as the top metal electrode by thermal evaporation at a pressure of 2 × 106 Torr.
Results and discussion
Structure
XRD patterns of ZnO nanoparticles, C-dots and Z@Cdots nanocomposite are presented in Fig. 3, whereas those of ZnO, RGO and Z@G nanocomposite are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† exhibiting the respective phases and crystallinity. Moreover, the interlayer effect in the Z@G and Z@Cdots nanocomposites has also been analysed. The XRD pattern of ZnO in Fig. S2† exhibits reflections at the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), (004) and (002) planes, which confirm the hexagonal wurtzite lattice of the as-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles.37

The broad and sharp peaks of ZnO confirm the synthesis of small-sized ZnO nanoparticles and their crystalline nature, respectively. The crystallite size, which was determined via Scherrer's equation, was determined to be 4 nm. The XRD pattern of RGO exhibits a broad graphite peak at 29°, which corresponds to the (002) plane with a d-spacing of 0.32 nm. The small d-value indicates the aggregation of RGO sheets owing to weak van der Waals interaction. In the XRD pattern of Z@G, the ZnO nanoparticles, owing to their crystalline nature, display well-defined sharp peaks along with a diffuse RGO peak with considerably less intensity. The anchoring of ZnO nanoparticles on a RGO sheet inhibits the restacking of carbon sheets, thus resulting in a less pronounced peak of RGO (as shown in Fig. S2†).38–40 The crystallite size of ZnO nanoparticles in the Z@G nanocomposite was found to be approximately 7 nm.

Fig. 3 compares the XRD patterns of ZnO, C-dots and Z@Cdots. The XRD pattern of C-dots exhibits a single graphitic peak at 2θ = 25.2°, rather than at 26.5° for the exact peak of graphite, which indicates an increase in the sp2 CC layer spacing. The abovementioned (002) graphitic plane corresponds to a d-spacing of 0.36 nm. Similar to the XRD pattern of Z@G (shown in Fig. S2†), Z@Cdots also displays sharp and intense ZnO peaks, which correspond to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), (004) and (002) planes. A small hump is also observed at 2θ = 23.5°, which represents the (002) plane of C-dots.41–43 The shift in the peaks of C-dots in pure form and in the nanocomposite suggests the successful synthesis of the Z@Cdots nanocomposite by a facile and time-efficient hydrothermal method.
Morphology

Fig. 4 shows a morphological analysis of the as-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles, C-dots, Z@G and Z@Cdots nanocomposite using TEM and HRTEM techniques. It is clearly observed in Fig. 4(a) that ZnO nanoparticles have quasi-spherical morphology with particle sizes lying in the range of 4–8 nm with an average size of approximately 5.5 nm. The high-resolution image in Fig. 4(b) shows the lattice fringes of ZnO nanoparticles with an interplanar spacing of 0.28 nm. The SAED pattern of the as-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles [as shown in Fig. 4(c)], with sharp and well-defined circular rings, demonstrates their highly crystalline nature. The anchoring of ZnO nanoparticles on graphene sheets can be easily deduced from Fig. 4(d). The image shows the distribution of spherical ZnO nanoparticles with particle sizes lying in the range of 3–11 nm and an average size of approximately 7 nm over a RGO sheet. The SAED pattern reveals the polycrystalline nature of the Z@G nanocomposite, as shown in Fig. 4(f). The spherical morphology of C-dots is clearly observed in Fig. 4(g), with lattice fringes shown in the inset. The C-dots possess a narrow particle size distribution in the range of 1–4 nm with an average particle size of 2 nm. Fig. 4(h) illustrates the spherical morphology of the Z@Cdots nanocomposite. The image shows its contrasting nature: dark-coloured particles correspond to C-dots, whereas lighter ones correspond to ZnO. The image shown in the inset of Fig. 4(h) also reveals the synthesis of nearly aggregation-free particles. The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 4(i) confirms the polycrystalline nature of the Z@Cdots nanocomposite. Moreover, Fig. 4(d) and (h) show the intimate contact of ZnO with graphene sheets and C-dots, which is a prerequisite for proper electronic interaction between them. In addition, it allows better charge separation, which is important from the point of view of solar applications.

Optical
To determine the absorption of the as-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles, C-dots, and Z@G and Z@Cdots nanocomposites, UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded and are presented in Fig. 5 and S3 in the ESI.† Fig. S3† shows the ZnO nanoparticles absorb at 364 nm, which corresponds to a band gap of 3.4 eV (which is larger than bulk ZnO; 3.2 eV). The blue shift for the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles is due to a decrease in their particle size from the bulk form. Moreover, the purity and crystallinity of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles can be easily determined from the sharp absorption peak. The absorption peak for the Z@G nanocomposite occurs at 372 nm. This shift in the peak (as compared to pure ZnO nanoparticles) is due to the anchoring of ZnO nanoparticles on graphene sheets. It is clearly observed from Fig. 5 that C-dots exhibit broad absorption from the visible to the UV region with a strong absorbance lying in the UV region at 264 nm, which shows the behaviour of an aromatic π system.44,45 The absorbance of pure C-dots exhibits maxima at 264 nm, whereas the maximum absorption of pure ZnO nanoparticles occurs at a considerably longer wavelength of 364 nm. When ZnO nanoparticles and C-dots interact with each other during the synthesis of Z@Cdots nanocomposite, there are alterations in the energy levels (as compared to pure ZnO or C-dots). The Z@Cdots nanocomposite exhibits maximum absorbance at 314 nm, which displays a red shift when considered from the perspective of C-dots and is expected to be due to ZnO nanoparticles (λmax = 364 nm). Similarly, when we consider this from the perspective of ZnO, the Z@Cdots nanocomposite exhibits a blue shift owing to the intervention of C-dots (λmax = 264 nm).

The photoluminescence emission spectra of ZnO nanoparticles, C-dots and Z@Cdots nanocomposite are presented in Fig. 6. The as-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles display a UV emission band at 385 nm, which corresponds to 3.22 eV and demonstrates excitonic recombination (as shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI†). Moreover, no emission band is observed in the wavelength range of 500–600 nm, which signifies the purity of the as-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles.46,47 The graph shows a slight shift in the PL peak of the Z@G nanocomposite in comparison to those of ZnO and C-dots, illustrating the interaction between ZnO and graphene. Moreover, the variation in the emission intensity of ZnO, C-dots and Z@Cdots nanocomposite (at the same sample concentration) confirms the effective interaction between ZnO and C-dots in the Z@Cdots nanocomposite.

FTIR
FTIR spectroscopy of ZnO nanoparticles, RGO and nanocomposites of Z@G and Z@Cdots has been performed to identify the functional groups that are present, along with the chemical changes that occur during synthesis of the nanocomposite. The spectrum for ZnO, presented in Fig. 7, shows a broad peak at 3500–3300 cm−1, which corresponds to OH stretching. Zn–O stretching is indicated by small peaks at 676 cm−1 and 917 cm−1. The peak that is located at 1406 cm−1 is due to OH bending vibrations, whereas the stretching of C–O and unreacted acetate is indicated at 1584 cm−1 and 1020 cm−1, respectively. In the spectrum for RGO, the most important skeletal in-plane vibration of CC is presented by the peak at 1545 cm−1. C–H stretching is indicated by peaks lying in the range of 2920–2850 cm−1. The small peak at 1736 cm−1 is due to CO stretching vibrations, whereas C–O stretching vibrations are indicated by the peak at 1165 cm−1. It is interesting to note that, in the Z@G plot, the intensity of the peak at 1557 cm−1, which corresponds to skeletal CC stretching vibrations, becomes the maximum, which indicates the reduction of RGO during the synthesis of the nanocomposite. Moreover, oxygen-related peaks at 2365 cm−1 and 1013 cm−1 also become weaker, which suggests the deoxygenation of RGO towards graphene. ZnO stretching is indicated by peaks at 655 cm−1 and 920 cm−1, which suggest the anchoring of ZnO nanoparticles over the graphene sheet.48–50 C-dots exhibit the most intense peak in the range of 2950–2850 cm−1, which corresponds to C–H bonds. The peak at 1659 cm−1 is again due to the skeletal in-plane vibrations of CC bonds, whereas the peak at 728 cm−1, which corresponds to aromatic C–H bonds, illustrates the presence of aromatic character in the synthesized C-dots. The scissoring vibration mode of C–CH2 bonds is presented by the peak at 1469 cm−1. The spectrum for Z@Cdots exhibits a peak in the range of 3363–3143 cm−1, which presents O–H stretching. Zn–O stretching is indicated by a peak located at 662 cm−1. The most significant peak that corresponds to the stretching of CC occurs at 1662 cm−1. C–H stretching is presented by the peaks in the range of 2917–2848 cm−1. The shift in the peaks of Z@Cdots as compared to C-dots is due to the interaction of ZnO with C-dots.

Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy was performed to identify order and disorder in carbonaceous materials. Fig. S4 in the ESI† compares the Raman spectra of commercial RGO and hydrothermally synthesized Z@G nanocomposite. Both spectra contain a characteristic D-band and G-band. RGO exhibits a D-band at 1349 cm−1 and a G-band at 1593 cm−1, whereas Z@G exhibits the respective peaks at 1353 cm−1 and 1597 cm−1. The shift in the band position is due to the anchoring of ZnO over graphene. Similarly, Fig. 8 compares the Raman spectra of C-dots and Z@Cdots. C-dots exhibit a D-band at 1354 cm−1 (which indicates disorder in C-dots),23,51 along with a G-band at 1594 cm−1 (which shows the extent of graphitic character in C-dots). The Z@Cdots nanocomposite exhibits shifting with respect to C-dots, having a D-band and G-band at 1352 cm−1 and 1601 cm−1, respectively. The shift indicates the interaction of ZnO with C-dots, which is required for charge transfer between C-dots and ZnO.

In addition, to confirm the hydrophobic nature of the as-synthesized Z@Cdots, contact angle measurement was performed and is shown as Fig. S5 in the ESI.† The measured angle was greater than 90°, which confirms the hydrophobicity of the synthesized Z@Cdots.
Solar cell characterization
As a strategy to achieve cost-effective, efficient and stable polymer-based solar cells, researchers worldwide are engaged in developing new donors and acceptors. Nearly 90% of the research is involved in synthesizing new polymers (as donors) and the remaining 10% towards developing new acceptors to replace fullerene with another acceptor that has better electrical and optical properties. However, not much of significance has been achieved in the case of acceptors. The reason lies in the use of semiconducting inorganic nanostructures as a substitute for fullerenes. Although inorganic semiconducting nanostructures possess various superior properties compared to fullerene (such as high mobility, superior conductivity, and a better absorption spectrum), the phase mismatch between organic polymers and inorganic nanostructures prevents the production of an efficient device. The present study concentrates on the synthesis of both inorganic and organic nanostructured materials as substitutes for fullerene to observe the effect on the overall cost-to-performance ratio of the device. In addition, a study of the phase effect has also been performed in an active-layer blend using ZnO nanoparticles as an inorganic acceptor and C-dots as an organic acceptor. Moreover, ZnO and carbon nanostructures have also been developed and used as acceptors to perform a comparative study of inorganic, organic and organic/inorganic nanostructures as replacements for fullerene in non-fullerene-based solar cells. In the literature, non-fullerene-based polymer solar devices using ZnO, C-dots and graphene, etc., have already been reported but to the best of our knowledge no such data has been reported with the Z@Cdots nanocomposite. Thus, the optimization of solar devices was carried out using Z@Cdots to obtain optimized parameters for best performance and the application of the same parameters for the fabrication of ZnO, C-dots and Z@G-based devices. In addition, to perform a comparative study of non-fullerene-based devices with a device using fullerene as an acceptor, fabrication of a device with fullerene has been carried out at an optimized concentration of the active layer and weight ratio of donor:acceptor.
Devices using PFO-DBT as the donor and Z@Cdots as the acceptor were fabricated with a constant overall concentration of the active layer of 40 mg ml−1 and varying weight ratios of PFO-DBT:Z@Cdots of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2. The obtained J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 10(a) and the obtained parameters are tabulated in Table 1. After optimizing the weight ratio of donor:acceptor, optimization of the overall concentration of the active layer was also carried out by varying the overall concentration to 30 mg ml−1 and 50 mg ml−1. Fig. 10(b) shows the observed J–V characteristics, whereas Table 2 gives device parameters such as short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (η). It is clearly observed from Fig. 10(a) that the best-performing device has an overall active layer concentration of 40 mg ml−1 and a weight ratio of 1:1 (PFO-DBT:Z@Cdots). As the weight ratio of Z@Cdots was increased in comparison to the polymer, i.e. 1:2, a decrease in the device efficiency was observed. Jsc exhibited a reduction from 14.8 mA cm−2 to 8.76 mA cm−2, whereas Voc displayed an increase from 0.82 V to 0.88 V and the fill factor also exhibited a decrease from 32% to 29%. The device with a 1:2 weight ratio exhibited a drop in device performance, with its efficiency reduced to 2.24% from 3.9% (1:1). A possible reason is aggregation of the as-synthesized Z@Cdots that would ruin the quality of the film and disrupt its homogeneity, resulting in degraded device performance.52 Interestingly, when the weight proportion of the polymer was increased in comparison to Z@Cdots to 2:1, the device again displayed poorer performance as compared to that with a weight ratio of 1:1. As the proportion of the polymer increased, it resulted in more absorption of photons and thus generation of charge carriers; however, due to the lower amount of Z@Cdots, the charge carriers did not find enough channels for transportation towards the respective electrodes, resulting in the recombination of charge carriers and thus lower device performance. Therefore, it has been concluded that for the particular overall concentration, 1:1 is the optimized weight ratio of donor:acceptor. To find the optimized overall active layer concentration, devices with 30 mg ml−1 and 50 mg ml−1 at a weight ratio of 1:1 were fabricated [as shown in Fig. 10(b)]. The J–V characteristics exhibited a decrease in device performance for both 30 mg ml−1 and 50 mg ml−1 compared to 40 mg ml−1. With 30 mg ml−1 as the overall concentration of the donor:acceptor blend, the active layer does not absorb sufficient photons to give rise to the generation of a significant amount of charge carriers, and therefore displays a lower efficiency than the device with 40 mg ml−1 as the overall concentration. Similarly, with 50 mg ml−1 as the overall concentration, the thickness of the active layer is increased, and owing to the low diffusion length of charge carriers, the recombination of charge carriers occurs before the transportation of charge carriers towards their respective electrodes.

Fig. 11 shows the J–V characteristics of the devices with ZnO, C-dots, Z@G and Z@Cdots as the acceptor at an overall active layer concentration of 40 mg ml−1 and a weight ratio of donor:acceptor of 1:1. All the performance parameters have been tabulated in Table 3. It is observed from the figure that the PFO-DBT:ZnO (organic:inorganic) device displays an overall efficiency of 1.41% with Jsc of 6.9 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.68 V. Similarly, the PFO-DBT:C-dots (organic:organic)-based device gives an efficiency of 2.75% with Jsc of 12 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.88 V. Thus, organic C-dots exhibit better performance as the acceptor with conjugated polymers as the donor in polymer-based solar cells as compared to inorganic ZnO nanoparticles, owing to a similar organic:organic phase interaction. It is interesting to observe that hybrids of ZnO (inorganic) with RGO or C-dots (organic) exhibit even better performance than pure ZnO or C-dots. It is expected that hybrid nanostructures can exploit the properties of both the inorganic semiconductor and the organic semiconductor, thus complementing each other. The inorganic part contributes towards improved charge carrier mobility and conductivity, whereas organic RGO or C-dots, owing to their large specific area, resulted in a large heterojunction interface between the polymer and the Z@G (or Z@Cdots) hybrid nanocomposite. This resulted in lower recombination of generated charge carriers and improved transportation of charge carriers toward their respective electrodes. Moreover, it is clearly evident from the energy band diagram of a solar cell (as shown in Fig. 12) that the dissociation of excitons occurs at the interface between PFO-DBT and the Z@Cdots nanocomposite, which is followed by cascading of electrons from PFO-DBT to Z@Cdots and finally towards the respective electrode. Furthermore, the position of the HOMO and LUMO levels of PFO-DBT and Z@Cdots do not promote the movement of holes to Z@Cdots; therefore, holes move from PFO-DBT to PEDOT:PSS and finally towards their respective electrode (i.e. ITO).

Among all the devices, the Z@Cdots-based device displays the best performance with PCE of 3.9%, Jsc of 14.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.82 V and FF of 32%. The device with Z@G as the acceptor is the second most efficient device among all the devices with an efficiency of 3.04%, Jsc of 12.5 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.76 V and FF of 32%. A probable reason for the lower performance of the Z@G nanocomposite might be the ease of aggregation along with non-uniformity in the size and shape of graphene sheets in comparison to C-dots (which exhibit quantum confinement and edge effects). Moreover, PL quenching, as shown in Fig. 9, demonstrated the greatest quenching with Z@Cdots in comparison to ZnO, C-dots and Z@G with PFO-DBT, which indicated better charge transfer with Z@Cdots than with the other synthesized nanomaterials.
To further support the obtained J–V characteristics, AFM measurements were performed and the obtained images are shown in Fig. 14. The better performance of Z@G and Z@Cdots than ZnO-based devices can be easily explained via AFM images. The ZnO-based device shows considerably low roughness compared to Z@G and Z@Cdots devices but the formation of transporting channels with the nanocomposite facilitates charge transportation through nanocomposite devices. This results in the suppression of charge recombination and better collection of charge carriers at the respective electrodes, which results in a higher PCE than with the pure ZnO-based device. On comparing devices based on different acceptors, we observed the best performance with the Z@Cdots-based device. Moreover, the organic:organic phase displays better performance than the organic:inorganic phase, whereas the organic:hybrid exhibits the best performance among all in terms of power conversion efficiency and short-circuit current density.

To observe the advantages of non-fullerene-based devices over fullerene-based devices, a device using fullerene as the acceptor was fabricated (as shown in Fig. 13) and a comparison of the performance parameters of Z@Cdots with those of the fullerene-based device is listed in Table 4. It is interesting to observe that both Jsc and Voc values are higher for the Z@Cdots-based device (14.8 mA cm−2 and 0.82 V) than the fullerene-based device (12.1 mA cm−2 and 0.71 V). However, the overall PCE of the fullerene-based device (4.2%) is higher than that of the Z@Cdots-based device (3.9%). This is due to the low fill factor of the Z@Cdots-based device (32%) in comparison to the fullerene-based device (50%). However, the difference in PCE of both devices is only 0.3%. It is important to mention that the as-synthesized Z@Cdots is 50 times more economical in comparison to procured fullerene, which ultimately results in an improvement in the cost-to-performance ratio of the Z@Cdots-based device. In addition, we have already started working on the low fill factor of the Z@Cdots-based device and that study will be communicated as a separate paper in the future.

Conclusion
It has been concluded that hydrothermally synthesized hydrophobic ZnO and carbon-based nanomaterials were successfully employed as acceptors in non-fullerene-based polymer solar cells. A microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis process gives monodisperse and homogeneous nanoparticles in a very short time span in comparison to other methods reported in the literature. Moreover, hydrophobicity leads to the formation of a homogeneous and stable blend of the polymer and as-synthesized nanomaterials. Among ZnO, C-dots, Z@G and Z@Cdots, the most efficient device was fabricated with Z@Cdots as the acceptor at an overall active layer concentration of 40 mg ml−1 and a weight ratio of 1:1. The best efficiency obtained was 3.9% with Jsc of 14.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.82 V and FF of 32% for the Z@Cdots nanocomposite. Moreover, it has also been shown that in comparison to inorganic ZnO nanoparticles, organic C-dots provide a device that performs better with the polymer, which suggests the better compatibility of an organic:organic (polymer:C-dots) phase than an organic:inorganic (polymer:ZnO) phase in the active layer. Interestingly, a hybrid of organic/inorganic (Z@G or Z@Cdots) displays still better performance than pure organic and inorganic materials, owing to the exploitation of the properties of both organic and inorganic materials on the same platform. In addition, the low difference in PCE between fullerene and Z@Cdots (only 0.3%) and considerably high difference in the synthesis costs of fullerene and Z@Cdots (Z@Cdots is 50 times more economical than fullerene) leads to a significant improvement in the cost-to-performance ratio of the Z@Cdots-based device.
