    , Accepted 28th June 2021First published on 16th July 2021AbstractTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most frequently studied semiconducting material for photocatalytic water splitting. One of the favored forms of TiO2 for photocatalytic applications is layers of erected single-crystalline anatase nanosheets (NSs), while the most frequently reported substrate used for its synthesis is a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Herein we demonstrate that anatase TiO2 NS layers can be similarly grown on a Ta2O5 substrate. We found that a Ta2O5 back contact provides a remarkable improvement of the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 NSs in comparison to a FTO back contact. The TiO2 NSs on Ta2O5 exhibit a 170-fold increase in photocatalytic H2 production rate than that obtained by TiO2 NSs on FTO substrate. The proposed mechanism reveals that such a drastic enhancement of optimized TiO2 NS arrays on the Ta2O5 substrate is attributed to the blocking nature of Ta2O5 for photo-generated electrons in the TiO2 NSs.
Introduction
Replacing the currently employed energy sources with renewable alternatives is believed to be the remedy for many contemporary social issues such as global warming, environmental pollution, and increasing energy needs.1,2 Solar energy is considered the most promising and ultimate source of renewable green energy source because of its abundance, easy availability, and sustainability.3 Among the different solar energy conversion strategies explored, photocatalytic hydrogen production via splitting of water is considered a highly promising pathway.4,5 Since the first report by Honda and Fujishima on TiO2 as a photocatalyst,6 a variety of semiconducting materials have been investigated in the quest for a highly efficient photocatalyst to improve hydrogen production rates.7 However, even nowadays, TiO2 remains one of the most investigated materials due to its non-toxicity, cheapness, commercial availability, eco-friendly nature, and long-term stability.8 TiO2 and, in particular, its anatase polymorph, has suitable band edges for water splitting and, most importantly, provides a superior resistance to photo corrosion.5 In recent years, low-dimensional structures of TiO2 such as nanotubes, nanowires, nanoflakes, and quantum dots have been strongly investigated materials due to their unique properties, i.e., directional charge separation and transport, high surface area, and plenty of active sites for reactions.8,9 In particular, aligned nanostructures, grown directly on a substrate, such as self-organized anodic TiO2 nanotubes or, as recently reported, single-crystalline TiO2 NSs are highly attractive. Such vertically aligned TiO2 NSs can be grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by a simple hydrothermal reaction.10–12 TiO2 NS layers are particularly interesting due to their single-crystalline nature, which supports fast electron transport processes. Moreover, the hydrothermal conditions allow control over crystal size and the percentage of exposed {001} facets. The latter can dominate the photocatalytic activity of such 2D TiO2 NS arrays, as sheets with a high amount of {001} facets display higher activity than arrays with {101} facets due to a favorable surface energetics.13,14
The material of choice used as a substrate to grow such nanosheets is FTO. This is because FTO is stable under the harsh conditions required to synthesize the NSs. Another key reason is that the surface of FTO is reported to be beneficial for the growth of such anatase crystals.15 However, the intrinsic junction between FTO and TiO2 anatase is not optimal for efficient charge harvesting in photocatalysis. Herein we introduce, for the first time, Ta2O5 as a synthetic substrate used for the hydrothermal growth of TiO2 NSs. Ta2O5 demonstrates comparable features as FTO (high chemical stability during synthesis and feasibility to grow anatase crystallites) but provides a conduction band (CB) minimum slightly higher than that of TiO2.16
In a first step, comparable single-crystalline TiO2 NS arrays on FTO (FTO/TiO2 NSs) and Ta2O5 (Ta2O5/TiO2 NSs) substrates were grown by a hydrothermal method as outlined in the Experimental section. The Ta2O5 substrate was produced by thermal oxidation of Ta foil at 600 °C for 10 min in air. The different thicknesses of TiO2 NS arrays (1, 2, and 2.5 μm) were obtained by variation of the hydrothermal conditions (see ESI†). The anatase TiO2 NSs were applied after additional annealing at 450 °C for 1 h in air to remove the fluoride termination layer obtained after synthesis.17,18
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the FE-SEM images of annealed TiO2 NS arrays on Ta2O5 and FTO substrates synthesized by the hydrothermal method for 15 h. Fig. 1a–d presents the top-view images of TiO2 NS arrays grown on Ta2O5 and FTO substrates with low and high magnification, respectively. As shown, the TiO2 NS arrays, grown on Ta2O5 and FTO, have almost the same morphology. Individual sheets have a width of around 2.25 μm (Fig. 1a and b), and an individual thickness of around 0.33 μm (Fig. 1c and d). Fig. 1e and f show cross-sectional images of the TiO2 NS layers grown on Ta2O5 and FTO, respectively. From Fig. 1e it is apparent that the thermal Ta2O5 underlayer is approx. 1.5 μm thick. The layer thickness of TiO2 NS arrays on Ta2O5 and FTO was found as 2 μm each (Fig. 1e and f). To evaluate the effect of the thickness of the NS layers, we synthesized TiO2 NS arrays on the Ta2O5 substrate using different reaction times (10 and 24 h), while preserving other parameters constant. Fig. S1† shows the corresponding cross-sectional FE-SEM images of TiO2 NS arrays indicating that 1 and 2.5 μm thick layers were obtained on Ta2O5 substrate after 10 and 24 h, respectively. The percentage of {001} facets of all synthesized TiO2 NS layers on Ta2O5 and FTO substrates were estimated based on geometrical relationships from the surface area of {001} and {101} facets,19 and are summarized in Table S1.† The average sheet thickness, average sheet width, percentage of {001} facets, and layer thickness are also given in Table S1.† Overall, the morphology of TiO2 NSs grown on FTO and Ta2O5 under the same conditions are almost identical.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD spectra of TiO2 NS arrays on the Ta2O5 substrate with varying thicknesses (1, 2, and 2.5 μm) and the 2 μm-thick FTO substrates, respectively. For the air annealed Ta sheet, the XRD spectra show the presence of orthorhombic β-phase Ta2O5, with main peaks at 2θ of 22.8°, 28.3°, 36.7°, 46.7°, 49.7°, and 55.8° (JCPDS #29-1149).18 Independent of either substrate, TiO2 NSs exhibit sharp peaks at 2θ = 25.3°, 37.8°, 38.6°, 48.1°, 54.0°, 55.1°, 62.7°, 70.5, and 75.1°, demonstrating the formation of TiO2 crystals with a tetragonal anatase structure (JCPDS #21-1272).20 However, the {001} peak is absent from all XRD spectra, indicating that TiO2 NS arrays are highly oriented to the substrates (Fig. 1, and Fig. S1†).13 The XRD spectra of all TiO2 NSs also exhibit additional peaks, which are corresponding to the Ta2O5 and FTO substrate, respectively.18

The chemical composition of the TiO2 NS arrays grown on Ta2O5 and FTO substrates was evaluated by XPS analysis. Fig. S2† shows the survey spectra of the as-formed and annealed TiO2 NS arrays grown on the Ta2O5 and FTO substrates. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p exhibits peaks at 464.5 and 458.8 eV corresponding to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2, respectively (Fig. 2b). This reflects the presence of Ti4+ in TiO2 for both the Ta2O5 and the FTO substrates.21 The XPS spectra of Ta 4f (Ta2O5, Fig. 2c) presents peaks at 26.1 and 28 eV corresponding to Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2, respectively, and are attributed to the Ta–O bonds in Ta2O5.22 The Ta foil also exhibits additional peaks at 20.8 eV and 22.6 eV corresponding to metallic Ta.23 After thermal annealing in air, peaks at 20.8 eV and 22.6 eV disappear indicating that the Ta2O5 layer is too thick to the metallic Ta underneath to be detected by XPS.
Another factor that affects the photocatalytic performance of a semiconductor on different substrates is light reflectance at the semiconductor/substrate interface. Here, we measured optical reflectance spectra from FTO and Ta2O5 substrates with varying TiO2 NSs thicknesses (1, 2, and 2.5 μm). As shown in Fig. 2d, the various thicknesses TiO2 NS arrays grown on Ta2O5 substrate have similar light absorption profiles. There is, however, a main difference to the FTO substrate. In the super-band gap region, λ < 400 nm, the TiO2 NSs prepared on Ta2O5 display an absorption that is approximately twice higher than that on the FTO substrate. As will be discussed below, the high absorbance of these samples is the potential origin of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2 NSs on Ta2O5.
To compare the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 NS arrays grown on Ta2O5 and FTO substrates, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was measured in an aqueous solution containing methanol as a sacrificial agent for hole capture. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, 2 μm-thick TiO2 NSs on the Ta2O5 substrate exhibits a drastically improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (121 μL/24 h) as compared to FTO/TiO2 NSs (2 μm-thick) (0.7 μL/24 h). For the TiO2 NSs grown directly on Ta2O5, the highest efficiency is reached by the 2 μm thick TiO2 layer samples.

It is worthy to note that the difference in photocatalytic activity observed with TiO2 NS arrays on Ta2O5 and FTO cannot be explained by reflectivity only since the difference in reflectance at λ = 365 nm, i.e., LED illumination wavelength used for H2 production measurements, is only 3% (Fig. 2d). Based on the abovementioned results and published literature, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in the presence of Ta2O5/TiO2 NS (2 μm-thick) and FTO/TiO2 NS (2 μm-thick) is proposed and schematically illustrated in Fig. 4. From literature, the position of the CB and VB of TiO2 and Ta2O5 were estimated by following empirical eqn (1) and (2).24,25 ECB = χ − E0 − 0.5EBG(1) EVB = ECB + EBG(2)where EVB and ECB are VB and CB edge positions, χ is the absolute electronegativity of the oxides (6.23 eV for Ta2O5,26 and 5.9 eV for anatase TiO227). E0 is the free electron energy of the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) is about 4.5 eV, and BG is the bandgap energy of the oxide.28 The BG of Ta2O5 and anatase TiO2 were obtained from the diffuse reflectance measurements using Kubelka–Munk transformation,29 and were found as 4.36 eV and 3.25 eV, respectively (Fig. S3†), matching well the literature values.30,31 Therefore, the ECB and EVB of TiO2 and Ta2O5 were calculated as −0.23, −0.45, +3.03, and +3.91, respectively, vs. NHE. The ECB of FTO was previously reported as 0.04 eV vs. NHE.32 This leads to the energetic diagram illustrated in Fig. 4. Since a LED with a wavelength of 365 nm (3.4 eV) was employed, i.e., the photon energy is higher than TiO2EBG but lower than Ta2O5EBG, electron–hole pairs are exclusively excited in TiO2. While the FTO provides an electron harvesting back contact for photogenerated electrons (Fig. 4a), the Ta2O5 that has slightly higher CB than TiO2, suppresses an electron escape to the substrate (Fig. 4b). In other words, the Ta2O5 substrate acts as a surface blocking layer for photo-excited electrons. Such a blocking behavior outweighs enhanced carrier recombination and the Ta2O5 back contact is highly beneficial for photocatalytic H2 generation. The latter is evident from the photocurrent transient measurements. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the ratio between light and dark currents is substantially different in both cases. While the maximal ratio in the FTO/TiO2 NSs samples was 1265 (Fig. 4c), the maximal ratio in the Ta2O5/TiO2 NSs reaches the value of 1.18 only, i.e., two orders-of-magnitude reduction (Fig. 4d). Moreover, there are clearly no apparent kinetic effects that would indicate that the amplification of the photocurrent is only of a transient nature (e.g. is due to a different recombination kinetics). As expected, a positive spike in the current transient was observed immediately after turning the light on in the FTO/TiO2 NS arrays sample associated with the recombination or trapping of the extracted hot electrons (Fig. 4c),33 while the opposite trend in the photocurrent transients was measured in the Ta2O5/TiO2 NS samples (Fig. 4d). The latter means that the most straightforward explanation for the 170-fold improvement in the H2 production rate is the beneficial characteristics of the Ta2O5 as an electron blocking layer.

Light/dark ratio of photocurrent transient of the 2 μm-thick TiO2 NSs grown on (c) FTO and (d) Ta2O5, measured at λ = 365 nm. 
Furthermore, the difference in the observed photocatalytic activities between various TiO2 NSs thicknesses on Ta2O5 substrate may be attributed to the synergetic effect of the fundamental properties such as crystal size (from width/length),34 and percentage of {001} facets.35 It is known that smaller crystal size affects the dynamics of charge carriers, rate of adsorption, and amount of reaction species adsorbed, while a larger percentage of {001} facets favors oxidative reactions.36,37 Here, the Ta2O5/TiO2 NS of 2 μm-thick sample benefits the optimal percentage of {001} facets and crystal size, which affect its superior photocatalytic H2 production rates. Finally, the morphology and structure of Ta2O5/TiO2 NS (2 μm-thick) after 24 h of H2 production was analyzed and found to be comparable to the as-prepared one indicating good stability of the Ta2O5/TiO2 NS samples (Fig. S4†).
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate that single-crystalline anatase TiO2 nanosheets can be grown on β-Ta2O5 layers using a similar hydrothermal synthesis approach as commonly reported for FTO substrates. For photocatalytic applications, however, the Ta2O5 blocking layer is advantageous demonstrating a drastically enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 generation from aqueous surroundings. This highly beneficial effect is attributed to the electron blocking nature of the Ta2O5/TiO2 NSs heterojunction. To the best of our knowledge, the use of such Ta2O5 substrates and their high efficiency as a blocking layer has not been reported previously.
Experimental section
Preparation of anatase TiO2 NSs on Ta2O5 and FTO
Vertically aligned TiO2 NS arrays were synthesized on different substrates using a hydrothermal method. Before synthesis, the substrates (Ta foil: 0.10 mm thick, 99.9% pure, ADVENT and FTO: 7 Ω m−2, Solaronix) were cleaned for 15 minutes by a sequential ultrasonication in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water, and then dried in a stream of N2. The Ta oxide coated foils (Ta/Ta2O5) were prepared by annealing the cleaned Ta substrates in air at 600 °C for 10 min. The TiO2 NS arrays were then subsequently grown using a modified method to that described by Liu and Aydil.38 A 1:1 mixture of deionized water and concentrated hydrochloric acid (37% by weight, Sigma-Aldrich) with a total volume of 40 mL was stirred at ambient conditions for 5 min in a 250 mL Teflon liner. Afterward, 2 mL of tetra butyl titanate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the above solution and stirred for another 15 min. Finally, 0.5 g ammonium hexafluorotitanate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the above suspension and stirred for another 5 min. These substrates were then separately placed in different Teflon-liners containing the reaction mixture, with their active sides facing down and the Teflon-liners, then were sealed in autoclaves. The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 150 °C for 10–24 h in an electric oven. After synthesis, the autoclaves were forced cooled to room temperature under running cold water, and the substrates with the grown TiO2 NSs were taken out and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and then left to dry in air. Finally, the as-synthesized TiO2 NSs were annealed at 450 °C for 1 h in air. The optimization of Ta2O5/TiO2 NS was obtained by varying the layer thickness of the TiO2 NS arrays (1–2.5 μm) on Ta2O5 during synthesis by changing the reaction time and named as Ta2O5/TiO2 NS (1 μm-thick), Ta2O5/TiO2 NS (2 μm-thick), and Ta2O5/TiO2 NS (2.5 μm-thick).
Characterization
The morphology and crystalline structure of the TiO2 NS arrays were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi FE-SEM S4800) and by X-ray diffractograms (XRD, X'pert Philips MPD, with a PanalyticalX'celerator detector) using graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation, (λ = 1.54056 Å), respectively. To investigate the layer thickness of TiO2 NS arrays, the cross-sectional SEM images were obtained by mechanically scratching the samples. The chemical composition of the samples was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5600, USA), and peak positions were calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Diffusive reflectance spectra of the synthesized samples were measured by a fiber-based UV-vis-IR spectrophotometer (Avantes, ULS2048) equipped with an integrating sphere AvaSphere-30 using AvaLight-DH-S-BAL balanced power light source. A BaSO4 standard whiteboard was used as reference material. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the TiO2 NS arrays was evaluated under open-circuit voltage (OCV) conditions using a UV LED (100 mW, λmax = 365 nm) as an illumination source. Each sample was fixed inside a quartz cell containing 50 vol% of methanol–water solution (photocatalytic reactor), which was then purged with argon gas for 20 min and sealed before irradiation. The sample (200 μL) was collected at regular intervals (1–24 h) during irradiation from the quartz cell headspace. The production of H2 was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GCMS-QO2010SE, Shimadzu) with a TCD detector.
