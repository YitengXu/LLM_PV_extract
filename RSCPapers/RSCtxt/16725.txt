    , Accepted 27th August 2019First published on 27th August 2019AbstractThe improving efficiency in obtaining renewable energy has promoted the deployment of electronic systems in the area of limited wired power-supply, whereas the use of devices with reduced threshold-voltage and power-consumption is essential for guaranteeing continuous working capability. Herein, Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 was optimized by introducing Ge for high-speed and low-energy phase change memory (PCM) application. The high speed of 10 ns and the low threshold voltage of 1.6 V have been achieved, originating from the crystal-like octahedral motifs in the amorphous phase, in which crystallization can be accomplished by the shifting or rotation of these motifs. The good endurance of 105 cycles is due to the small volume change of 4.6% and the formation of a homogenous phase during crystallization, which reduces the risk of stress- and segregation-induced device failure. The nucleation-dominated crystallization behavior of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 is observed, where the Ge atoms with lowest electronegativity are preferred to occupy the center cation layers in the nonuple-layer block, whereas the less metallic Bi and Sb atoms sit on the edged cation layers. The high-speed, low threshold voltage, and low power consumption have made the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 PCM film a promising candidate for application in self-powered electronic systems, i.e. Internet of Things systems with solar energy supply.
1. Introduction
Phase change memory (PCM), in which the data are recorded by the phase change materials (PCMs) with different resistive states, namely high resistive glass state and high conductive polycrystalline state, has been regarded as one of the leading candidates to serve as Storage-Class Memories (SCMs), artificial synapses, and artificial neurons, promoting the information processing efficiency for both the Von Neumann systems and the emerging neuromorphic systems.1–4 The excellent performances, including high operation speed, non-volatile data storage, strong endurance, and outstanding scalability, of the PCM originate from the unique electronic properties and structural characteristics of the PCMs, where interatomic metavalent bonding is believed to prevail.5–8
With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and implantable medical devices, PCMs with higher speed and lower power consumption are being urgently pursued to mitigate the power supply crisis for these electronic systems with limited energy sources, i.e. ranging from thermoelectricity to solar energy; the large programming current requirement of PCM, which employs Ge2Sb2Te5 (J = 0.40–0.58 μA nm−2) and GeTe (J = 0.37 μA nm−2), has limited its application in the low-energy field.9,10 Doping has been applied in PCMs to enhance their heating efficiency by creating more grain boundaries, which will increase the scattering of carriers and phonons, resulting in a reduced heat dissipation in the device and the subsequent lowering of operating power.11,12 By introducing Ti and Sc into Sb2Te3 to form Ti0.4Sb2Te3 and Sc0.2Sb2Te3, the operating current has been reduced by 82% (J = 0.05–0.10 μA nm−2) and 85% (J = 0.03–0.08 μA nm−2) as compared to that of the Ge2Sb2Te5 PCM film, leading to a decrease in power consumption by 78% and 87%, respectively.9,13 Recently, PCMs have been engineered into a superlattice structure, named interfacial phase change memory (iPCM) materials, to achieve ultra-low power consumption, and distinguishable resistive states can be realized by two crystalline phases, between which the transition only requires the movement of a few atoms at the interfaces.14 However, the lattice mismatch between the dopants and the PCMs often causes segregation, degrading the material uniformity and lowering the device endurance. Moreover, the rigorous requirements, including the limited kind of substrate materials and deposition methods, for the superlattice fabrication of PCMs have brought a lot of restrictions on the development of a feasible way for the mass production of iPCM.15
Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 belongs to the space group of Rm, same as that of Sb2Te3. The quintuple Te–Sb/Bi–Te–Sb/Bi–Te layers are connected by van der Waals (vdW) forces in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, where Sb and Bi share identical positions. The atomic coordination number six, atypically high Born effective charges, and high conductivity of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 reveal its metavalent bonding nature, which is essential for its excellent properties as thermoelectric and quantum materials as well as potential applications in PCM.5 Moreover, the crystallization speed of the PCMs, including Ge2Sb2Te5 and Sb80Te20 alloys, has been reported to increase after Bi doping, speculatively stemming from the reduced activation energy for crystallization and low viscosity for the smooth diffusion of atoms.16–18 Detailed atomic-level insights have been provided through ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, which attribute the enhanced crystallization speed to the defective-octahedral BiTen motifs and the increased free volume in the amorphous phase.19 The existence of octahedral motifs in the glass state enables the accomplishment of crystallization by the movement of very few atoms within nano-seconds; in brief, due to metavalent bonding in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and the intrinsic nature of the formed octahedral structure in Bi-centered motifs, Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 possesses significant potential for application in high-speed low-energy PCM.
In this study, Ge was introduced into Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 to enhance the structural rigidity of the amorphous phase, providing an adequate data retention for PCM application. The electrically induced phase transition properties were verified in the T-shaped PCM cell. Moreover, the crystallization behaviors were in situ observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Chemical identification of the atoms in the lattice was unambiguously conducted by atom-resolved STEM-EDX. Finally, AIMD simulations were carried out to provide an understanding of the device performances from the perspective of the PCM microstructure.
2. Optimization of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3
2.1. Retention
High thermal stability of amorphous PCMs determines the long-term data retention of PCMs, which is vital in nonvolatile data storage. Fig. 1(a) shows the sheet resistance of the PCM film as a function of temperature (R–T). The sudden drop in resistance denotes fast crystallization in the PCM film, and this point is regarded as the crystallization temperature (Tc). The as-deposited Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 film shows the low resistance of ∼2 × 103 Ω, only slightly higher than that of the annealed film (6 × 102 Ω). The crystalline phase of the as-deposited Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 film was later confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), indicating poor thermal stability. Therefore, the Ge atoms were introduced into Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 to achieve better thermal stability, which led to an increase in the Tc to 175 °C, 195 °C, and 206 °C for Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, Ge1.9Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, and Ge2.5Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, respectively, higher than that of the Ge2Sb2Te5 (167 °C). Accordingly, the 10-year data retention of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, Ge1.9Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, and Ge2.5Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 was enhanced to 92 °C, 108 °C, and 129 °C, respectively, stronger than those of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 (<room temperature, RT) and Ge2Sb2Te5 (87 °C). The 10-year data retention was predicted by employing the Arrhenius equation,20 the details of which have been discussed in our previous study.21 Failure time is defined as the duration needed for the resistance to reduce to half of its initial value under isothermal baking conditions. The data retention of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and Ge1.9Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 indicates that these samples are qualified for PCM application in customer electronics (85 °C). Moreover, Ge2.5Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 is enough thermally stable for automotive application that requires the minimum 10-year retention of 120 °C. It is believed that the short and strong bonds between the Ge atoms and the surrounding atoms can effectively enhance the rigidity of the atomic network, thus attributing to the better thermal stability of the amorphous state of PCMs. Considering the risk of segregation caused by excessive Ge doping and the purpose of characterizing the properties of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3-host phase-change materials, Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 with low Ge content was selected for further study.

Among the lines with the same color, the upper line denotes the heating process, whereas the lower line presents the cooling process. (b) Data retention of the PCMs, predicted by the Arrhenius equation, with the fitting curves presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). 
2.2. Homogeneous phase
Phase segregation and electromigration in PCMs are the most common causes for material uniformity breakdown, leading to the early failure of the PCM device. To ensure a robust endurance, the application of homogeneous PCMs is preferred for PCM. In previous studies, it has been reported that the doping of a small amount of Bi (3 at%) into Ge2Sb2Te5 does not change the structure, and a single crystalline phase has been verified in the metastable face-centered cubic (FCC) structure and stable hexagonal (HEX) structure without any segregation by X-ray diffraction (XRD).22 In this study, the crystalline phase of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, with the higher Bi concentration of 8 at% and a smaller portion of Te, was investigated by XRD, as shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction pattern of 250 °C annealed Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 is analogous to that of the FCC Ge2Sb2Te5, but with lower shifting of the diffraction peaks. The existence of Bi with a larger atomic radius (160 pm) than those of the Ge (125 pm), Sb (145 pm), and Te (140 pm) should be the root cause for the shifting of these peaks.23,24 As the annealing temperature reaches 400 °C, the diffraction peaks of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 shift to lower positions as compared to those of the 250 °C annealed Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, especially those located at 28.7°, 42.5°, and 52.0°. Thus, the formation of the FCC-like metastable phase can be speculated from the XRD result, which would be beneficial for the high-speed phase transition. Uniform distribution of all the elements, after crystallization has been confirmed by direct observation, shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). That is, no phase segregation was observed in the patterns of 250 °C annealed and 400 °C annealed Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, indicating good uniformity.

2.3. Minified density variation
Atoms in PCMs will arrange into a higher degree of order during crystallization, mostly accompanied by an increase in density and decrease in volume. Repeated shrinkage and expansion of the PCMs during device operation will increase the risk of stress-induced interfacial detachment, and void formation will cause open circuit device failure, which will be aggravated when the volume change is significantly high.24 X-ray reflectivity (XRR) scan was employed to measure the volume change of the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 film during crystallization, as shown in Fig. 3. The crystalline Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 film was obtained by annealing at 250 °C for 2 min. The GenX fitting program was used to analyse the density and thickness of the film.25 The film thickness reduced from 35.1 nm to 33.5 nm after crystallization, showing a 4.6% reduction in the volume. The smaller volume change than that of the Ge2Sb2Te5 (6.8% volume shrinkage from amorphous to FCC) indicates good potential of endurance for the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 PCM film.

2.4. High operation speed and low power consumption
The performance of the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3-based PCM cell was characterized by a T-shaped PCM cell, presented in Fig. 4(a), in which the W bottom electrode was 190 nm in diameter, the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 layer was 100 nm thick, and the top electrode consisted of a 20 nm TiN glue layer and 300 nm Al. Voltage pulses were applied between the top and the bottom electrodes to operate the cell, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). The Set operation, which is needed to trigger phase transition from the resistive amorphous state to the conductive crystalline state, often employs electric pulse of low intensity but a long width to provide enough Joule heat and duration for the crystallization of the PCMs. Reversibly, the Reset operation employs intensive short pulses since the melting quenching of the PCMs to achieve crystalline-amorphous transition is quite power consuming but extremely fast. Thus, the Set speed and Reset power are of great interest in PCM performance. The Reset resistance is ∼8 × 105 Ω, two orders of magnitude higher than the Set resistance, ∼8 × 103 Ω, making the sensing margin large enough to store distinguishable resistive states. The Set voltage of ∼1.0 V and Reset voltage of ∼1.6 V are lower than that of the Ge2Sb2Te5 cell (1.6 V Set and 2.3 V Reset),26 denoting low power consumption. Furthermore, the Reset current for Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 is 1.9 mA, corresponding to the current density of J = 0.07 μA nm−2, much lower than the value needed for the Ge2Sb2Te5 (J = 0.40–0.58 μA nm−2) and GeTe (J = 0.37 μA nm−2) cell. Moreover, the Set speed of the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 cell is tested by voltage pulses with the increasing width, as displayed in Fig. 4(c). For Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, the duration of 10 ns is enough for the Set operation when the amplitude of 1.5 V is used, whereas it must be 35 ns for Ge2Sb2Te5, as exhibited in the inset of Fig. 4(c). Therefore, an enhancement in the operating speed of the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 cell can be expected as the fast phase transition has already been verified in other Bi-doped chalcogenides that is triggered by either optical stimulation or electrical pulse.16,17 When the cell was operated with the pulses of 1.2 V/500 ns and 2.3 V/500 ns, an endurance of 105 was achieved for the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 cell, presented in Fig. 4(d). In the electronic system with thermoelectric or solar energy supply, the primitive voltage of 0.3 V ∼ 0.6 V needs to be pumped higher to provide adequate device voltage (Vdd). However, taking the charge pump as an example, pumping a higher Vdd will lead to lower energy conversion efficiency and consequently higher power consumption. Hence, the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 PCM film with a small Reset current and a low driven voltage is extremely suitable for application in environmental energy-supported electronics.

Black and red dots present the Reset and Set resistance during cycling, respectively. 
Low power consumption of PCMs is commonly attributed to two factors: the high heating efficiency of the cell and the low activation energy for phase transition in PCMs. The former is often correlated with low thermal conductivity of the PCMs, which can minimize heat dissipation during cell operation, thus lowering the total consumed energy.27,28 The thermal conductivity of the Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 films, with a thickness of 500 nm, was measured using the LINSEIS TFA system by the 3ω method, as shown in Fig. 5.29 The amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 films show a similar thermal conductivity of ∼0.25 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature, which increases gradually to ∼0.35 W m−1 K−1 as the temperature increases to 150 °C. Higher annealing temperature-triggered crystallization will lead to a noticeable increase in the thermal conductivity, that is 0.87 W m−1 K−1 and 1.82 W m−1 K−1 for Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 at 250 °C, respectively. As the electronic and lattice thermal conductivity of a PCM thin film are closely related to its microstructure, the quick increase in thermal conductivity with the increasing temperature may indicate a fast nucleation and growth process during Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 crystallization. The slowdown of the increase in the thermal conductivity with an increase in temperature between 200 °C and 250 °C for Ge2Sb2Te5 results from the complete formation of the FCC phase. On the other hand, the thermal conductivity of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 increases in a continuous and quick way in the range from 150 °C to 250 °C; this indicates that this metastable phase is not as stable as FCC Ge2Sb2Te5, and successive structural arrangement is still taking place. Based on its high thermal conductivity, it is suggested that the low power consumption of the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 PCM film may originate from the low activation energy of phase transition rather than high heating efficiency.

3. Crystallization behaviors
3.1. Nucleation-dominated crystallization
The PCM performances are greatly affected by the crystallization mechanism of the PCMs, which can be divided into two categories: the growth-dominated crystallization and the nucleation-dominated crystallization mechanism.30 For the former, the nuclei formed in the amorphous region are small and take a long incubation time. The phase transition from amorphous to crystalline is accomplished by grain growth from the existing crystalline rim. Consequently, a cell size-dependent operation speed can be observed in these PCMs. However, for the latter, numerous nuclei will form in the amorphous region at the beginning of crystallization. The grains will have a smaller size, and the crystallization time is less dependent on the PCM cell size. Herein, the crystallization process of the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 film was observed during in situ heating via TEM, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a) was obtained at 160 °C when the nuclei started to appear. When the film was heated to higher temperatures, a lot of new nuclei appeared, some of which are highlighted by the dash circle in Fig. 6(a)–(c), conforming to a nucleation-dominated crystallization mechanism. Grains grew to the size of ∼20 nm at 190 °C, close to that in the case of FCC Ge2Sb2Te5 and smaller than that in the case of the crystalline Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 film (50 nm, Fig. S3, ESI†).31 These small grains may contribute to the small density variation accompanied by crystallization, which ensures device reliability by reducing the stress-induced risk.

3.2. Atomistic chemical identification
As the transport properties of PCMs are dependent on their microstructures, obtaining an unambiguous image of atomic arrangement in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 is essential for the understanding of electrical and optical properties as well as the crystallization kinetics. Hence, the atom-resolved images of the crystalline Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and 350 °C annealed Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 films are presented in Fig. 7 and 8, respectively, which have been obtained by the JEM-ARM300F system at the voltage of 80 kV.

(b) The HAADF-STEM image of the quintuple layers in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3. (c), (d) and (e) EDX mapping of Bi, Sb, and Te, respectively, where the overlapped image is shown in (f). 
Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 belongs to the space group of Rm, as presented in Fig. 7(a), directly observed in the high-angle angular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image shown in Fig. 7(b), same as that of the Sb2Te3. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) images in Fig. 7(c)–(f) show that the quintuple Te–Sb/Bi–Te–Sb/Bi–Te layers are connected by van der Waals (vdW) forces, where Sb and Bi share identical positions, confirmed by the EDX mapping. The atomic coordination number of six, atypically high Born effective charges, and high conductivity of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 reveal its metavalent bonding nature, which is the essential for its excellent potential as PCMs.5
After the introduction of Ge into Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, the number of atom layers in the repeating unit increased from 5 in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 to 13 in Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, accompanied by an increase in the complexity of the distribution of cations, as presented in Fig. 8. The HAADF-STEM image shown in Fig. 8(a) clearly exhibits the existence of the sequential …/9-layers/2-layers/2-layer/9-layers/2-layers/2-layers/… stacking blocks, where the repetitive unit can be regarded as 13 layers. Although the intensity (brightness of the image) is proportional to Z1.7 in the HAADF-STEM image, where Z represents the average atomic number, the analogous atomic number between Sb (ZSb = 51) and Te (ZTe = 52) and the high structural complexity in the four-element system have made the HAADF-STEM data insufficient for the identification of the elements. However, due to the state-of-art aberration corrected STEM imaging technology, atomic-resolved EDX mapping can be performed to identify the elements in each location of the lattice, as displayed in Fig. 8(c)–(f), based on which the average EDX intensity profiles of the Ge, Bi, Sb, and Te elements along the horizontal direction have been extracted, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The 13-layered structural unit is composed of a nonuple-layer stacking block and two bilayer stacking blocks, marked by dash lines in Fig. 8(b). The formation of the Sb–Bi bilayer is driven by the Peierls instability, as commonly observed in rhombohedral Sb, which can lower the energy and open a gap at the Femi level by forming the Bi–Sb puckered layer.

(b) The EDX profile of the Ge, Bi, Sb, and Te elements along the horizontal direction of the region shown in (a). (c), (d), (e) and (f) EDX mapping of Ge, Bi, Sb, and Te, respectively. 
The nonuple-layer block is connected to the bilayer blocks through vdW-like interactions, which is highlighted by arrows in Fig. 8(a). The nonuple-layer block has been proposed to have the structure Te/Sb–Ge/Bi–Te–Ge/Bi–Te–Ge/Bi–Te–Ge/Bi–Te according to the EDX scanning results, where Te/Sb and Ge/Bi denote the mixed layer. Considering the axis symmetricity of the element distribution in the nonuple-layer block, these layers can be labeled as L1–L2–L3–L4–L5–L4–L3–L2–L1. The Ge atoms are located at L2 and L4, intermixed with the Bi atoms. However, in Fig. 8(c), the higher EDX intensity in L4 than that in L2 shows the preference of Ge occupying L4, the layer close to the center of the nonuple-layer block. On the contrary, the Bi atoms are more abundant in L2 than in L4. Similar intermixing behavior has been observed in both the Ge1Sb2Te4 and the Ge2Sb2Te5 hexagonal phases in our previous studies,32,33 which is the result of balancing between enthalpy and entropy for a minimum phase transition energy.32 L1, L3, and L5 are mainly occupied by the Te atoms, the same as that observed in the structure of the Ge2Sb2Te5. In the non-stoichiometric Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, L1 is partially occupied by Sb due to Te deficiency.34 Based on the EDX scanning images, some empirical rules can be summarized, that is, the elements with a lower electronegativity (Ge: 1.77) are preferred to take up the positions in the center cation layers, whereas those with a higher electronegativity (Bi: 1.80) are mostly in the cation layers near the edge, or even in some anion sites (Sb: 1.82) when the anions (Te: 2.08) are deficient in number.

        Ab initio simulations
4.1. Amorphous structure
The amorphous structure model of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 has been calculated by AIMD simulations, as shown in Fig. 9, which is believed to play a crucial role in the fast rearrangement of the atomic structure during crystallization.35,36 Although long-range order or medium-range order is not noticeable in the model, short-range order with crystal-like octahedral structures can be identified around the Ge and Sb atoms, highlighted with red dash circles in Fig. 9(b) and (d). These crystal-like structure motifs, which have also been found in amorphous Ge–Sb–Te PCMs, are regarded as the main building blocks of the amorphous structure. It has been pointed out that only one-third of the Ge atoms are found in the tetrahedral position in amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5, whereas other atoms are located at defective octahedral sites, with the coordination number beyond 8-N rule.35 By achieving a linear alignment of the p orbitals during crystallization, metavalent bonding begins to prevail, accompanied by a significant increase in the dipole matrix elements, which is the fundamental reason for the dramatic change in the optical and electrical properties.36 The existing octahedral motifs can provide a precursor for nucleation, reducing the nucleation time, which is vital for achieving fast crystallization.

The pair correlation function (PCF) G(r) curves of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 annealed at different temperatures were obtained from the in situ selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results, as shown in Fig. 10(a), to study the structural characteristics of the amorphous and crystalline phases. The Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 sample stays amorphous when heated up to 150 °C, which is still below the Tc of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 sample (175 °C). In the G(r) of amorphous Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, the first maxima are at 2.8 Å, corresponding to the Ge-related bonds, as presented in the partial pair correlation function (PPCF) in Fig. 10(b). There is little structure beyond 6 Å in the G(r) of the amorphous phase, obtained neither from the experimental method nor the calculated way, indicating that the short-range order is limited mainly in the range of the first neighbors, progressing hardly to the second neighbors; this is similar to the reported short-range order in amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5.36 When the heating temperature reaches 200 °C or above, the fluctuations in the G(r) start to appear beyond 6 Å, showing the grain of the middle range order during crystallization. The first maxima shift from 2.8 Å to 3.0 Å after crystallization, showing the emergence of metavalent bonds and the reduction of covalent bonds, where the former is generally 0.1–0.2 Å longer than the latter.36 Although the size of the ordered structure in amorphous Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 has been characterized through the G(r) curve, these data are still not enough to obtain a clear view of the overall topological properties in the short-range ordered structure. Thus, further analyses on the coordination number and bond angle were performed.

4.2. Coordination number distribution (CND) and bond angle distribution (BAD)
Crystal-like structure in amorphous Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 has been verified by the CND and BAD analyses, as shown in Fig. 11. Detailed coordination information is listed in Table 1. The dominant coordination numbers (CN) for Ge are 5 and 6, resulting in an average CN = 5.3. The large CN implies that the Ge atoms are in the defective octahedral sites, rather than the tetrahedral sites with CN = 4. The trend of larger CNs than 8-N rule has also been verified for Bi (CN = 3.3), Sb (CN = 4.1), and Te (CN = 3.4). Moreover, the BAD curves clearly show that the Ge-, Bi-, Sb-, and Te-centered three atom angles are close to 90°, a typical value in an octahedral structure, instead of 109° in a tetrahedral structure; this means that p bonding is dominant in the amorphous phase. The copious amount of crystal-like octahedral motifs existing in the amorphous phase indicates that only a part of the constituent atoms and bonds need to be rearranged during crystallization. In other words, structural adjustment of the octahedral motifs through shifting or rotation may be enough for accomplishing the amorphous to crystalline transition, which is regarded as the key to the high speed and low energy operation for Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3-based PCM.

4.3. Mean square displacement (MSD)
Besides the high similarity between the amorphous and crystalline phases, the high mobility of the constituent atoms would be beneficial to an accelerated crystallization. Therefore, the mobility of the Ge, Bi, Sb, and Te atoms in Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 at different temperatures was analyzed by the MSD,37 as presented in Fig. 12. At the beginning of the crystallization, MSD increases linearly with annealing time, as shown in Fig. 12(a), with the slope of the MSD–time curve proportional to the average atom diffusion coefficient (Dx, x denotes Ge, Bi, Sb, or Te). The diffusion coefficient can be extracted by employing the following equation: (1)
 Fig. 12  (a) MSD of the Ge, Bi, Sb, and Te atoms in amorphous Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 at 427 °C. (b) Diffusion coeffocient of the Ge, Bi, Sb, and Te atoms at 27 °C, 227 °C, 327 °C, 427 °C, 627 °C. 
The Dx of Ge, Bi, Sb, and Te increases exponentially with the annealing temperature, as can be seen in Fig. 12(b). At room temperature (27 °C), DGe, DBi, DSb, and DTe are ∼10−11 m2 s−1, two orders of magnitude lower than those of 427 °C, denoting a slow atomic motion and a stable amorphous structure at room temperature. As the annealing temperature increases from 227 °C to 427 °C, DGe gradually becomes larger than the other three, indicating the highest mobility of Ge atoms. However, the diffusivity of the Te atoms becomes most slowest. High annealing temperature is more efficient in enhancing the diffusivity of Bi than Sb and Te, which makes DBi reach 5.73 × 10−10 m2 s−1 at 427 °C, higher than DSb (5.45 × 10−10 m2 s−1) and DTe (4.49 × 10−10 m2 s−1). One of the reasons for the higher speed of the Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 PCM cell than that of the Ge2Sb2Te5 may lie in the reduction of the number of Te atoms with low diffusivity. Owing to the existence of large amount of Ge with higher value of D, the diffusivity of Bi is not regarded as a key factor for the fast crystallization of Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3. However, the reported stabilized planar structure around the Bi atoms in amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5, that is the fractions of crystalline structure, is believed to help reduce the stochasticity in atomic diffusion during crystallization, thus accelerating the speed of structure ordering.19
5. Conclusion
Herein, the application potential of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 in PCM was studied by film property characterization and device performance test. Ge was introduced into Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 to enhance the thermal stability of the amorphous phase, such that the 10-year data retention could reach as high as 126 °C. Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 with a 92 °C retention was employed in the fabrication of the PCM cells, which showed good performances of 10 ns Set speed, 1.6 V threshold-voltage, 1.9 mA Reset current, and 105 endurance. It was suggested that the high speed and low threshold voltage originated from the crystal-like octahedral motifs in the amorphous phase, in which phase transition only involved the shifting or rotation of these octahedral motifs. The small volume change of 4.6% and the formation of a homogenous phase during the crystallization of Ge–Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 are the key for achieving the good endurance of 105 since the risk of stress- and segregation-induced device failure can be reduced. The crystallization behavior of Ge–Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 was in situ observed to be nucleation dominated. The nonuple-layer block of Te/Sb–Ge/Bi–Te–Ge/Bi–Te–Ge/Bi–Te–Ge/Bi–Te and bilayer block of Bi/Sb–Sb were observed in crystalline Ge–Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, in which the Ge atoms with the lowest electronegativity were preferred to occupy the center cation layers in the nonuple-layer block, whereas the less metallic Bi and Sb atoms were sitting in the edged cation layers. The high-speed, low threshold-voltage, low power-consumption have made Ge–Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 PCM films a promising candidate for application in self-powered electronics, i.e. IoT systems with solar energy supply.
6. Experimental
Experimental details

Film deposition and characterization. 
The Ge2Sb2Te5, Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, and Ge–Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 films were deposited by the sputtering or co-sputtering of Ge, Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, and Ge2Sb2Te5 targets. The compositions are determined by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX). The R–T curves are measured in the system composed of a Linkam LMP 95 hot stage and Agilent 4155C parameter analyzer. Moreover, 200 nm thick PCMs films were prepared for R–T measurement. XRD and XRR tests were conducted using the Rigaku D/max 2550V system. In situ TEM, SAED, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF)-STEM and atom-level EDX mapping were performed using the JEM-ARM300 system under 80 kV. Thermal conductivity of the Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 films with a thickness of 500 nm was measured using the LINSEIS TFA system by the 3ω method. Ge2Sb2Te5 was annealed at 400 °C for 2 min to achieve the hexagonal phase.


Device fabrication and testing. 
T-shaped PCM cell with 190 nm diameter bottom electrode is used to perform electric triggered phase transition of PCMs. 100 nm thick Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ge1.3Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 films are deposited on the bottom electrode, subsequently covered by 20 nm TiN and 300 nm Al top electrode. Electrical testing of PCM cells is performed on the platform consisting of a Keithley 2600 m source meter, a Tektronix AEG 5200B pulse generator, a homemade current pulse generator.


Calculation details. 
The density functional theory (DFT)38 employed in the first-principles calculations is implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)39 code. The electron–ion interaction is described by the projector augmented wave (PAW)40 pseudo potentials and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) based on the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)41 function is employed to describe the electronic exchange–correlation interaction. We obtain the structure of the amorphous system by ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics (AIMD). For the AIMD, the energy cutoff and the K-points are set to be 175 eV and 1 × 1 × 1, respectively. In order to obtain an amorphous structure, a 3 fs time step is used and the supercell (containing 46 Sb, 54 Ge, 18 Bi and 106 Te atoms) undergoes the following MD process: first melted and equilibrated at 3000 K for 9 ps, then quenched to 1200 K for 30 ps and equilibrated at 1200 K for another 30 ps, subsequently quenched to 300 K within 60 ps, finally maintained at 300 K for 30 ps.
