    , Accepted 29th November 2021First published on 30th November 2021AbstractNa3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is a member of the sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) family and has been extensively studied as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) for more than three decades due to its stable voltage platform, high capacity, and stable cycle life. However, the presence of toxic and expensive V elements restricts the utilization of NVP-based SIBs. To overcome this, energy researchers have employed a cation swapping approach, which resulted in new NASICON-type manganese-substituted sodium vanadium phosphate (MSVP) cathodes for SIBs. Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP) is among the new generation of high-energy, risk-free NASICON-type MSVP cathodes, and its use for SIBs was documented in 2016. There has been strong acceptance of MSVP-based cathodes among materials researchers due to their cost and economic advantages. In a short period, considerable work has been done to increase the commercial potential of MSVP-based cathodes for SIBs. This review summarizes the pioneering developments made with MSVP-based cathodes, with a special focus on their structural and electrochemical evolution. This review can serve as a reference for future energy researchers fabricating highly efficient and safer NASICON cathodes not only for SIBs but also for other energy storage applications.Vaiyapuri SoundharrajanDr Vaiyapuri Soundharrajan received his B.Tech. degree (2013) from Central Electrochemical Research Institute, India, and obtained his Doctorate (2021) from Chonnam National University, South Korea.

1. Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are rich in energy and power outputs due to the lightweight and small size features of Li+ ions.1–4 Although, LIBs have shown great success in portable electronics and electric vehicles, there is increasing concern that LIBs cannot replace fossil fuels and meet the massive demands of society due to the cost and insufficiency of lithium resources.5,6 For this reason, energy researchers have introduced alternative energy storage devices (ESDs), including zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs),7,8 sodium-ion batteries (SIBs),9,10 and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs).11,12 SIBs are one of the best rechargeable batteries among known ESDs and have been highly rated over the years due to the vast availability of sodium in the Earth's crust and competitive energy output approaching that of LIBs.13,14 It has to be acknowledged here that SIBs usually follow the same intercalation mechanism as that of LIBs. The working mechanism of SIBs utilizing a polyanion-based cathode and a hard carbon anode is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1a. During the charge process, the increase in the oxidation state of transition metal ions during the de-intercalation of Na+ ions from the cathode generates electrons that travel in the external circuit to the anode, where the de-intercalated Na+ ions are intercalated into the anode traveling through the electrolyte. The whole mechanism is reversed during the discharge process.15,16

Interestingly, LIBs serve as a reference for the development of SIBs, and the energy research community has applied the knowledge learned from LIBs to realize advancements in SIBs due to the obvious similarities between Na+ and Li+ ions.17,18 Nevertheless, research on electrode materials for SIBs has encountered major struggles due to assorted solvation–desolvation properties, poor solid–electrolyte interface formation, ion transfer behavior, and sluggish ion diffusion properties;19–22 they arise for Na+ ions (1.06 Å) because they are larger and heavier than Li+ ions (0.69 Å).23,24 Consequently, SIBs lag behind LIBs in terms of electrochemical cycling stability and energy output.25,26 Despite lower voltages and energy outputs, there has been increased interest in utilizing SIBs for electrical grids, low-speed electric vehicles (EVs), and mid-range electric bicycles (EBs), for which weight and size requirements are not an issue.27,28 Since the cathode is the critical component of battery devices, researchers have focused on developing diverse cathode materials to improve the utilization of SIBs. The cathodes for SIBs can be divided into four main categories, namely, layered oxides,29 Prussian blue compounds,30 organic cathodes,31 and polyanionic NASICONs.32 Among the various types of cathodes explored for use in SIBs, NASICON-type cathodes have been highly favored due to their superior structural stability, extreme air stability, and stable voltage plateau.33,34 In particular, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has served as a common NASICON-type cathode for SIBs over the decades.35,36 However, inherent electronic conductivity issues and the use of unfavorable vanadium raw materials make NVP unsuitable for use in practical SIBs.37,38 Despite the multivalent features of vanadium redox species, vanadium-based electrodes can be operated over wide voltage ranges for various battery applications.39–41
It must be acknowledged that every element is limited in the earth's crust, and some are fewer than others. Compared to the manganese availability (0.11%), vanadium (0.019%) distribution is rarer in the earth's crust. On the other hand, the global manganese and vanadium market demand skyrocketed due to the inevitable use of vanadium/manganese in the steel industry, automotive applications, and energy storage applications in the forms of alloys, low-cost wires, and electrode materials for battery applications. Global vanadium utilization has swollen from 71200 megatons in 2018 to 73000 megatons in 2020, creating a huge demand for vanadium.42 Among them, the steel industry accounted for 91% of the usage of vanadium and will continue to be the major consumer in the future as well. In contrast, the shrinkage of vanadium resources and rising health anxieties associated with vanadium consumption are alarming energy engineers to restrict the usage of vanadium in rechargeable applications. More importantly, the distribution of vanadium resources is limited to only four major nations including China, Russia, South Africa, and Australia, which increases the supply risk thereby increasing the product cost (Scheme 1b).43 On the other hand, manganese is distributed noticeably in the US, Columbia, Spain, Greece, Japan, and India as well. Still, manganese is unevenly distributed in the earth's crust like vanadium resources; however, the reserves of manganese are 6-fold higher than those of vanadium. Also, the annual production of manganese is 70.8 million metric tons per year globally, significantly higher than vanadium production (∼70000 metric tons).44 This imbalance strongly impacted the raw material cost as well, for instance, 1 ton of vanadium pentoxide is ∼15 folds higher than that of 1 ton manganese acetate (Scheme 1c). In summary, the resource and ecological impacts related to vanadium consumption could lead manganese to play a crucial role in the commercialization of manganese-based SIBs, with a compact budget and slightly superior energy output.
In this regard, inexpensive transition metal ions including Mn, Fe, and Ti were explored as a potential alternative to V.45,46 In 2016, the Nobel laureate Prof. Goodenough employed a cation swapping approach to replace some of the V content in the NVP cathode with ecofriendly and readily available transition metal ions, e.g., Mn, to introduce a new cathode material Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP).46 The cation swapping tactic avoids the toxicity and cost of NVP and resulted in the use of NMVP (Scheme 2). In particular, the energy output of NMVP is increased compared with that of the parent NVP due to the enhanced (de)sodiation potential of the dual transition metal ions (Mn2+/Mn3+ and V3+/V4+) in the NMVP structure. NMVP soon became a vital part of the SIB cathode family, and its ability to deliver stable electrochemical performance makes NMVP almost indispensable for SIBs. Successful research on Na4MnV(PO4)3 cathodes for SIBs encouraged scholars to introduce diverse forms of MSVP-based cathodes. Due to the use of dedicated material engineering concepts, different forms of MSVP-based cathodes have evolved within a short period (Scheme 3). The material engineering approach with low-cost Mn/Fe/Cr elements not only reduced the final cost but also increased capacity and voltage outputs. From a complete survey, we found that full and partial swapping of manganese for sodium vanadium phosphate (e.g., Na4MnV(PO4)3, Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3, and Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3) has evolved to give new high capacity cathodes for SIBs.46–48 In addition, the cation swapping approach also produced new low-cost and high-energy NASICON-type variants, such as Na3.4Mn0.4Cr0.6V(PO4)3, Na3.4VFe0.6Mn0.4(PO4)3, and Na4Mn0.5Fe0.5V(PO4)3.37,49,50

Due to all the above, the number of publications (∼25) on the MSVP-based amplified in the last four years, highlighting the interest and importance of low-cost and non-toxic materials amongst the SIB research community to build an eco-friendly world (Scheme 1d). Yet, the research is still at an early stage and not mature enough to yield MSVP-based cathodes as state-of-the-art cathodes for SIBs. Substantial review articles summarizing the advantages and developments of Na3V2(PO4)3 are available in the literature.27,36,51,52 However, a prospective review article summarizing research strategies and future directions for MSVP-based cathodes has not yet been published, to the best of our knowledge. Herein, we review recent literature summarizing the research directions and instantaneous challenges revolving around the use of MSVP-based cathodes. With the increased need for low-cost and energy-efficient storage devices, the reception of MSVP-based SIBs will likely intensify in the future, and researchers will face the challenge and pleasure of making SIBs into a state-of-the-art energy storage technology.53,54
2. The extent of Mn2+ swapping in Na3V2(PO4)3 and evolution of new NASICON derivatives
Mn amendments in the parent Na3V2(PO4)3 crystal structure by materials engineers have led to diverse forms of MSVP NASICON cathodes in recent years. For example, in 2019, Gosh et al. varied the level of Mn2+ doping into the Na3V2(PO4)3 crystal structure to understand the electrochemical impacts of Mn2+ ions in NASICON-type Na3+γV2−γMnγ(PO4)3 (γ = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) samples prepared via the sol–gel technique.47 The observed XRD patterns of all Na3+γV2−γMnγ(PO4)3 samples were readily indexed to the Rc space group. With increasing Mn2+ content, the diffraction patterns exhibited shifts toward lower angles due to the geometrical distributions of divalent and trivalent cations (Mn2+ and V3+) in the parent NVP structure (Fig. 1a). Additionally, from Rietveld refinement, it was found that with an increase in the Mn2+ content, Na(1) and Na(2) spots were filled progressively, which comprehensively increased the volume of the unit cell. Furthermore, the authors stated that with an increase in the Na(1) population, a decrease in the c-parameter resulted, which reduced the electrostatic repulsions among (V/Mn)O6 octahedral units. Likewise, with an increase in Na(2) occupancy, there was an increase in the a-parameter value due to the displacement of larger Mn2+ [rMn2+ = 0.83 Å] with smaller V3+ [rV3+ = 0.64 Å] cations. From electrochemical analyses in the window 2.75–3.8 V, the authors found that the intercalation capacities of Na3+γV2−γMnγ(PO4)3 samples declined with increases in γ values from 0 to 0.5 (Fig. 1b). Conversely, the intercalation capacities were found to increase with γ values from 0.74 to 1. At an extended upper cutoff voltage of 4.2 V (Fig. 1c), the capacity was found to increase for all samples; however, they underwent rapid losses in capacity due to irreversible structural variations (verified using ex situ XRD analysis). Among the five Na3+γV2−γMnγ(PO4)3 samples studied by the authors, the Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3 composition with a precise bottleneck size and high activity of V- and Mn-redox couples supplied a high discharge capacity (100 mA h g−1 at 1C) and enriched rate capability (89 mA h g−1 at 1C). Thus, the authors proposed a systematic and detailed study, and the positive results will encourage scholars to perform fundamental research focused on the electronic and crystal structure optimization of NASICON-type cathodes for SIBs.

Research activity focusing on the effects of Mn2+ inclusion into parent NVP increased in the following years. For instance, Zakharkin et al. also conducted comprehensive studies on the electrochemical and structural properties of Na3+xV2−xMnx(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1) groups.55 In the relaxed voltage window between 2.5 and 3.8 V, 2 moles of Na+ ions participated in all samples regardless of the Na content. From operando analysis, they verified that the Na3+xV2−xMnx(PO4)3 materials experienced multiple phase transformations, including the reversible formation of intermediate single-phase zone-Na2V2−xMnx(PO4)3 in the case of cycling within 2.5–3.8 V (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, with an increase in the cutoff voltage to 4.1 V, additional Na+ was extracted via a solid-solution mechanism for all materials with x > 0. Overall, with an increase in the Mn2+ swapping ratio, there was a gradual rise in the energy output (from 378 W h kg−1 to 410 W h kg−1) for the Na3+xV2−xMnx(PO4)3 materials compared with the parent Na3V2(PO4)3 in the voltage range 2.5–4.1 V (Fig. 2a).

Anishchenko et al. studied the kinetics of Na+ diffusion into Mn-swapped materials Na3+xV2−xMnx(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1) by comparing the effect of Mn substitution and electrochemical outputs of the materials in a stable voltage window (2.5–3.8 V).56 From CV comparisons, the authors witnessed that increases in the Mn content progressively widened the solid solution regions, i.e., caused decreases in ionic diffusion coefficients (Fig. 2b). Also, the authors witnessed that the change in the V content has a significant effect on the particle size and structure. With an increase in the Mn content, the individual particles were agglomerated, resulting in a broader particle size distribution (Fig. 2c). The authors anticipated that this could impact the kinetic parameters. However, the electrochemical properties of the Mn-rich samples were found to be superior. Besides, they observed a pronounced charge transfer resistance and surface layer resistance for the Mn-rich materials Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 and Na4MnV(PO4)3, which resulted in large hysteresis for charge/discharge profiles at high currents. They claimed that the large hysteresis occurring between the charge/discharge profiles for Mn-rich cathodes was directly related to the nucleation kinetics. Moreover, the hysteresis did not involve specific energy limitations, whereas diffusion behavior associated with phase boundary propagation (concentration polarization effects) directly impacted the specific energy outputs. For example, the Mn0V2 sample with a narrow single-phase region exhibited a 16% energy reduction among the materials explored here. On the other hand, the Mn1V1 sample with a broad single-phase region showed a smaller reduction in specific energy. Thus, the authors suggested that Mn-substituted materials with single-phase intercalation exhibited faster discharge kinetics than two-phase intercalation systems.
Interestingly, Zhang et al. studied the details of Na+ electrochemical storage with sodium-deficient Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 nanoparticle cathodes embedded in porous carbon networks (NMVP/C) synthesized via solid-state techniques.57 The cathode was found to exhibit an enriched rate capacity of 92 mA h g−1 at 60C and exceptional cycling stability (87% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 20C) in the defined voltage window of 2.5–4.1 V. The highly reversible single-phase and biphasic reactions with a minimal volume change of 8.2% were claimed to be primarily responsible for the superior electrochemical properties of the NMVP/C cathode. By employing ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the authors revealed that Mn2+/Mn3+ and V3+/V4+ were the principal capacity contributors of the NMVP/C cathode. Interestingly, the Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3‖HC full cell also delivered an adequate practical voltage (3.3 V) and practical capacity (96 mA h g−1), generating a high specific energy output (234 W h kg−1). Furthermore, the Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3‖HC full cell exhibited established voltage profiles and powered in-house LEDs, demonstrating potential for real-world applications (Fig. 2d–f). Ma et al. also made a detailed comparison of the structural and electrochemical properties of the carbon-coated parent Na3V2(PO4)3 and Mn-modified cathodes; i.e., Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 (N3.5MVP/C) and Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP/C) were prepared using a molten surfactant-paraffin media-induced solid-state reaction.48 Compared to the parent NVP structure, N3.5MVP and NMVP exhibited significant changes in lattice parameters due to the infusion of Mn2+ ions into the NVP structure. From galvanostatic cycling assessments of all three samples between 2.5 and 4.0 V at 0.5C for 100 cycles, it was confirmed that N3.5MVP/C exhibited capacity retention (93.6%) superior to those of the NVP/C (93.2%) and NMVP (88.6%) cathodes. From ex situ XRD studies, the authors verified the change in the unit cell volume of the N3.5MVP/C cathode (7.6%) compared to those of NVP/C (8.1%) and NMVP (10.3%) cathodes. They claimed that the appropriate replacement of V with an Mn enhanced the charge transfer kinetics and sodium storage capability with simultaneous improvement in energy density and cycling stability. Finally, the authors concluded that among the compared cathodes, Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 contained an ample Na supply and exhibited minimal volume variation, high working voltage, superior cycling stability, and greater potential as a stable cathode for SIBs.
Very recently, Niu et al. showed the diversity of carbon-coated Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 (NMVP@C) cathodes prepared in a one-step solid-state reaction by constructing two anode materials: hard carbon (HC) and NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP).58 By comparing the half-cell CV and galvanostatic outputs of the cathode and anode materials, the authors predicted that the average voltage platforms of NMVP@C‖NTP would be approximately 1.3 V, whereas NMVP@C‖HC was expected to achieve 3.35 V (Fig. 3a–e). The cycling stability and rate capability output clearly revealed that both full-cell systems are capable of practical applications. In summary, NMVP@C//HC, with a high energy output (35% capacity retention after 2343 cycles, 35 mA h g−1, and 3.35 V), exhibited greater commercial value in high-energy requirements. However, NMVP@C‖NTP, with superior cycling stability (58% capacity retention after 2343 cycles, 42 mA h g−1, and 1.3 V), has greater potential to meet requirements for stable large-scale energy storage.

3. Structural and electrochemical comparison of Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes
Na4MnV(PO4)3 is the primary cathode among MSVP-based cathodes due to its superior electrochemical and structural stability. Considerable research has been devoted to Na4MnV(PO4)3 among MSVP-based cathodes. Herein, we compare the structural and electrochemical properties of Na4MnV(PO4)3 with those of Na3V2(PO4)3 to obtain a fundamental understanding of the structural and electrochemical properties of MSVPs. It is well known that NVP adopts a rhombohedral crystal structure (Rc space group) comprised of PO4 tetrahedra and VO6 octahedra, yielding a [V2(PO4)3]3− 3D polyanion structure.52 The sodium ions are located at two separate spots, namely, Na(1) (1 occupancy, with 6-fold coordination) and Na(2) (0.67 occupancy level, with 8-fold coordination) (Fig. 4a).59–61 In practice, 2 moles of Na+ ions arranged at Na(2) sites actively participated in the two-phase (de)sodiation process (Na3V3+V3+(PO4)3 ↔ NaV4+V4+(PO4)3) in a controlled voltage window (2.4–3.9 V), which resulted in a sodium storage capacity of ∼110 mA h g−1 with a flat (de)sodiation curve at 3.4 V (the remaining Na+ ion at the Na(1) site remains undisturbed) (Fig. 4b).60

On the other hand, Prof. Goodenough determined that additional Na+ ions could be accommodated in the NVP structure if half of the V3+ ions were replaced with Mn2+ transition metal ions, i.e., the production of Na4Mn2+V3+(PO4)3.46 The newly developed NMVP cathode was assigned to a trigonal crystal structure (Rc group), and the rhombohedral form was also documented in the subsequent years. The two well-established voltage plateaus supplied by the V3+/V4+ and Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples at 3.3 and 3.6 V increased the average voltage of NMVP compared with that of NVP with a single V3+/V4+ redox couple. The overall advantages of NMVP over NVP are described in Table 1. More importantly, NMVP exhibited a 3D framework similar to that of NVP and comprising PO4 tetrahedral and MO6 [M = Mn, V] octahedral constituents to yield [MnV(PO4)3]3− polyanion units. The interstitial spaces of [MnV(PO4)3]3− polyanion units were filled with two kinds of Na atoms, one with 6-fold coordination of Na(1) and the remaining three with 10-fold coordination of Na(2). Therefore, Na4Mn2+V3+(PO4)3 can be denoted as Na(1)Na(2)3Mn2+V3+(PO4)3 (Fig. 4c).62 Although 4 Na+ ions were present in the Na(1)Na(2)3Mn2+V3+(PO4)3 cathode, only 2 moles of Na+ ions in the Na(2) sites were available for two-phase (de)sodiation in a controlled window of 2.4–3.8 V; this corresponded to a stable sodium storage capacity of 108 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, the electrochemical cycling stability of Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na4MnV(PO4)3 cathodes was almost similar at a 5C rate (Fig. 4e and f), clearly confirming that Mn inclusion has minimal impact on the electrochemical stability on the parent NVP structure.

4. Extending the extraction limit of Na+ ions in Na4MnV(PO4)3
As discussed for the parent NVP structure in the previous section, only 2 moles of Na+ ions from Na(2) are involved in the sodium storage properties of the NMVP cathode in the defined voltage window 2.4–3.8 V. To understand the results of maximum extraction of Na+ ions from Na4MnV(PO4)3, Zakharkin et al. studied the maximum Na+ ion extraction limit of NMVP by extending the cutoff voltage to 4.4 V.63 From short-range cycling of the NMVP cathode in the extended upper cutoff voltage range from 3.8 to 4.4 V, the authors found that the NMVP cathode exhibited stable electrochemical properties in the 2.5–4.0 V voltage window. Specifically, the authors compared the capacity vs. voltage profiles of NMVP cathodes in the extended upper cutoff voltage range from 3.8 to 4.4 V to understand the Na+ reaction pathways. They found that the V4+/V5+ redox couples are partially activated at 3.9 V for the NMVP cathodes operated at or above 4 V during (de)sodiation. From comparative analyses of electrochemical and in situ XRD data, the authors found that extending the cutoff voltage above 3.8 V affected the operation of the reverse charge process. In particular, the removal of more than 2 Na+ ions from NMVP initiated a depletion of Na+ ions from the Na(1) position (Fig. 5a–c). Similarly, Chen et al. also demonstrated the complete removal of a 3rd Na+ ion from Na4Mn2+V3+(PO4)3; i.e., the transformation Na4Mn2+V3+(PO4)3 → NaMn2+V5+(PO4)3 was cycled between 2.5 and 4.3 V and demonstrated an activated capacity of 156 mA h g−1 during the charging process.64 However, the discharge capacity was only 120 mA h g−1, clearly showing that the reaction NaMn2+V5+(PO4)3 → Na4Mn2+V3+(PO4)3 was not completely reversible. In particular, the cycling stability was greatly affected (30 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles), clearly validating that the extraction of the 3rd Na+ ion from the structure leads to irreversible structural transformation in the 1st cycle. From operando XRD analysis (2.5–4.3 V range), it was found that the NASICON framework was maintained. However, the parent crystal structure was not completely regenerated after the 1st cycle (pattern 55), and it was verified that Na(2) sites were not fully reloaded after the 1st (de)sodiation cycle (Fig. 5d–g). In addition, the authors claimed that the 2.5–4.3 V range was not suitable for the practical applications of NMVP cathodes, and they named this voltage range the irreversible voltage range.

Interestingly, Nisar et al. studied the role of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in restricting the irreversible structural transformations of NMVP cathodes within extended voltage limits.65 Specifically, the authors utilized the sol–gel technique to prepare MWCNT-supported NMVP samples with different percentages of MWCNTs (1% and 3%). By comparing the sodium storage properties of the MWCNT composite cathode with those of the pristine NMVP/C cathode in an extended voltage range 1.5–4.5 V at 0.05C, it was found that the MWCNT-supported cathode exhibited better cycling stability than the pristine NMVP/C cathode (which could be due to a combination of electronic conductivity and structural stability effects). However, the typical voltage positions for the Mn2+/Mn3+ and V3+/V4+ redox couples were not apparent in the extended voltage region, clearly suggesting that the redox features were affected by the wide voltage window. Cheng et al. analyzed the effect of calcination temperature on the sodium storage performance of NMVP/C cathodes in an extended voltage region 2.5–4.5 V.66 The authors synthesized NMVP/C composites by a sol–gel technique and calcined them in an inert atmosphere at different temperatures of 650, 750, and 850 °C, and the composites were denoted as NMVP-650, NMVP-750, and NMVP-850, respectively. From a comprehensive analysis of XRD data, the authors found that the unit cell volumes of NVMP/C samples increased with increasing temperature. However, the surface areas and carbon disorder for the NVMP/C composites decreased with increasing temperature. In particular, the NMVP-750 sample with rich Na+ diffusion coefficients exhibited higher capacity, better cyclability, and higher rate capability than the NMVP-650 and NMVP-850 samples. However, the redox peak positions for all samples exhibited large initial coulombic losses; more importantly, large voltage hysteresis was also observed at higher current scan rates. It is debatable whether the extraction of Na+ ions from the NMVP cathode above 4 V is irreversible and causes structural collapse that leads to rapid loss of capacity. However, although the NMVP cathodes exhibited large voltage hysteresis in this study, the key factors leading to the stable cycle lives of the NMVP samples in the extended voltage region are yet to be determined.
5. Overcoming the electronic conductivity issues of Na4MnV(PO4)3via supporting on a conductive carbon
It is well known that polyanion-based materials generally exhibit poor electronic conductivity, as did pristine NVMP; hence, researchers applied a carbon coating on the NMVP cathode. Depending on the synthetic technique, either organic (oxalic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, etc.) or inorganic carbon sources (reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), etc.) were used to boost the sodium storage properties of the NMVP cathode. For example, Li et al. used the sol–gel method to construct in situ carbon-coated Na4MnV(PO4)3 sustained with a graphene aerogel (NMVP@C@GA).67 The authors verified that the NMVP nanograins were anchored in an orderly fashion on a graphene framework and that a uniform smooth in situ carbon layer was coated on the NMVP nanoparticles (Fig. 6a–f). The purposefully designed NMVP@C@GA cathode achieved a superior output (60 mA h g−1 at 50C) and long-term cycling capability (69% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 20C). Since the NMVP@C@GA cathode design realized a stable energy output of ∼380 W h kg−1, the authors further tested its practical capability by formulating a full cell comprising the NMVP@C@GA cathode and a hard carbon anode. The NMVP@C@GA‖hard carbon full-cell designed by the authors retained 77% capacity after 100 cycles at 110 mA g−1 rates, highlighting that the composite design not only enhanced the electronic conductivity but also provided superior dimensional stability to the cathode. Likewise, Rameshkumar and coworkers improved the conductivity of NMVP by formulating a NMVP-rGO composite via the sol–gel technique.68 Indeed, they examined the sodium storage properties of the NMVP-rGO composite cathode in both nonaqueous and aqueous SIBs. In the nonaqueous system, the NMVP-rGO composite in a half-cell design exhibited a stable discharge capacity of ∼86 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 100 cycles. However, the cycling stability in an aqueous half-cell system was slightly poor (∼70 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles at 1C) because transition metals are prone to undergo dissolution during electrochemical Na+ (de)insertion in aqueous electrolytes.69–71 Interestingly, the authors constructed full cells using the NaTi2(PO4)3 anode for both aqueous and nonaqueous systems. The Na4MnV(PO4)3 r-GO‖NaTi2(PO4)3-MWCNT full cell design exhibited an average discharge voltage of approximately 1.3 V in both nonaqueous and aqueous electrolyte solutions. However, the cycling stability of the Na4MnV(PO4)3-r-GO‖NaTi2(PO4)3-MWCNT full cell design was superior in nonaqueous electrolyte solutions compared to that of aqueous electrolyte solutions.

Furthermore, Zhang et al. showed the use of CNTs in promoting the electrochemical properties of NMVP cathodes by formulating in situ carbon-coated NMVP@C@CNT composites via a wet-chemical approach (Fig. 6g–j).72 The NMVP@C@CNT composite exhibited an enhanced output (69 mA h g−1 at 90C) and extended cycling stability (68.3% capacity retention at 40C for 4000 cycles). From GITT studies, it was found that a superior diffusivity of 10−9 to 10−12 cm2 s−1 was the prime factor behind the superior output of the NMVP@C@CNT composite (Fig. 6k). Additionally, from CV studies, the authors further confirmed that the diffusion-related reaction kinetics (i.e., nonfaradaic process) boosted sodium storage properties (Fig. 6l–m). It was claimed that strategically designed 3D-interconnected NMVP microparticles surrounded by an intertwined CNT matrix enabled rapid Na+ and e− transport, which resulted in superior electrochemical properties. The previously discussed studies were mainly focused on wet-chemical routes for the inclusion of conductive carbon sources into NMVP structures. Cui and coworkers encapsulated the NMVP cathode within a highly conductive rGO/amorphous carbon skeleton (NMVP@rGO/AC) by using a spray–drying synthetic technique for the first time.73 Compared to other wet-chemical routes, the spray–drying technique exhibited practical advantages because it produces NMVP@rGO/AC products in a powdery form directly, without evaporation and grinding (Fig. 7a). From microstructure analysis techniques (SEM and TEM), it was found that NMVP@rGO/AC exhibited a well-established microspherical architecture (0.5 to 2 μm) (Fig. 7b–e). The microspheres were encapsulated uniformly in the conductive rGO network surrounded by an amorphous carbon layer (Fig. 7f).

This dual-carbon encapsulation architecture delivered superior electrochemical stability (77.5% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 100 mA g−1). Furthermore, the authors strongly believed that the spray–dying technique has great potential in the mass production of rGO/AC-encapsulated NMVP for stable ESDs. In one of the recent studies, Cui et al. demonstrated the efficient fabrication of a low-fraction (2.14 wt%) rGO-supported NMVP cathode via the spray–drying method.74 The important synthetic observation claimed by the author using MnCO3 as the Mn2+ source rather than using manganese acetate (to avoid the oxidation and subsequent water-insoluble salts with dihydrogen phosphate) could be helpful for future researchers to successfully design MSVP-based cathodes with ease. A low-fraction (2.14 wt%) rGO-supported NMVP cathode claimed to register the highest rate capability (102 mA h g−1 at 50C) due to the effective dispersion of NMVP microspheres submerged in the active electronic conductive rGO units.
6. Influence and effects of metal doping and swapping in Na4MnV(PO4)3
Although carbon coating enhanced the electrical conductivity of the NMVP cathode, it did not improve the inherent properties of the NMVP cathode.75,76 Metal ion doping into the crystal structure is effective in improving the inherent properties of well-established NVP cathodes, and there have been numerous reports regarding ionic doping and its advantages.77 However, metal ion doping and its nominal capacity for improving the electronic conductivity of NMVP cathodes were originally reported by Soundharrajan et al.78 In particular, the authors employed an amalgamation of multiple approaches, i.e., morphological tailoring (cotton-candy architecture), crystal structure variation (Cu doping), and electronic conductivity improvement (in situ carbon coating), via a single-step pyrosynthetic process (Fig. 8a). Originally, they synthesized carbon-coated Na4VMn(PO4)3 with a unique cotton candy-like morphology (NVMP/C/CC) via a one-step modified pyrosynthetic technique. Interestingly, the authors also studied the extensions of the level of Cu2+ doping into the lattice structure of Na4Mn(1−x)CuxV(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) and its synergetic effects on electrochemical properties. By comparing rate capability data for the various Cu-doped samples, the authors found that the NMVP sample with 0.1 mol Cu doping, i.e., Na4VMn0.9Cu0.1(PO4)3 (NVMCP), exhibited superior rate outputs. More importantly, they found that excessive copper doping (Cu > 0.1 mol) led to adverse effects, i.e., decreases in the output rates. From XRD refinement analyses, the authors observed a slight change in the lattice parameter values for the NVMCP sample compared to those of the pristine NMVP sample (Fig. 8b). The doped Cu was claimed to occupy corner-shared M–O6 (M = V, Mn, Cu) octahedral units. From the analyses of microstructures, the authors found that the NVMCP sample exhibited a cotton-candy architecture surrounded by a uniform in situ carbon layer (5–7 nm), with a uniform distribution of Cu doping into the sample (Fig. 8c–f). From first-principles calculations via density functional theory, the authors verified that the Na4VMn0.9Cu0.1(PO4)3 sample with rich metallic properties exhibited superior electronic conductivity. Thus the Cu-doped sample exhibited rapid electronic transport compared to the pristine sample and it was strongly reflected in the galvanostatic as well as the rate performance outputs (Fig. 8g and h). To address the above, they utilized the NVMCP sample to construct a full cell with a sulfide-based anode (MnS2), which retained 73% of the capacity after 50 cycles at 40 mA g−1. From this study, the authors verified that, along with morphological and conductive carbon changes, elemental doping also enhanced the sodium storage properties of the NVMP sample.

Recently, Hou et al. demonstrated that the inclusion of an electronegative element (fluorine (F)) into a NMVP crystal unit improved the sodium storage properties.79 In particular, they extended the level of F swapping to prepare new derivatives Na4−3XMnV(PO4−xFx)3 (X = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2). From the comparisons of electrochemical outputs, the authors found that sodium storage properties were significantly improved with increasing F content. Among them, the sample with F optimized at 0.05 mol delivered the best output, whereas storage property outputs were decreased for cathodes with an F content x > 0.05 mol (Fig. 9a). The authors calculated the bond length of each sample from the XRD pattern. They found that when x = 0.05 mol, the cathode material exhibited a maximum bond length of 2.673 Å, which reduced Na2–O bonding to facilitate superior (de)sodiation. The authors found that the F atoms occupied O1 and O2 sites with occupancies of 1.25%. Interestingly, they observed that the negative charge deficiency induced by F− substitution for O2− was compensated for by cation deficiency to yield a sodium-deficient fluorinated manganese vanadium phosphate with a chemical formula of Na3.85□0.15MnV(PO3.95F0.05)3 (□ corresponds to the sodium deficiency). More importantly, DFT calculations also supported the experimental outputs, i.e., improved electrochemical activity after F substitution into the NMVP sample. In particular, it was verified that F substitution altered the electron density near Mn/V atoms, which was the driving force behind the enriched Na+ diffusion kinetics in the NMVPF electrode (Fig. 9b). From in situ XRD analysis, it was verified that the Na3.85□0.15MnV(PO3.95F0.05)3 (NMVPF) cathode exhibited both single phases as well as biphasic (de)sodiation similar to that of the parent NMVP cathode. However, the biphasic behavior in the high voltage zone was more reversible in the fluorine-doped NMVPF cathode than in the undoped NMVP cathode, which was claimed to be the primary reason behind the enhanced capacity and voltage output of the NMVPF cathode (Fig. 9c and d). The structural rearrangement that took place during the participation of Na+ in both cathode materials was clearly verified with the well-established peak shifts compared to the in situ XRD patterns for both samples. A significant improvement in the reaction kinetics, sodium storage potential, and rate properties due to the effective electronegative element doping was demonstrated in this study (Fig. 9e–g). This is a very promising approach with the potential to yield high energy outputs, and it could soon receive more attention leading to the practical applications of MSVPs.

Although doping was found to increase electrochemical stability, it must be acknowledged that doping usually involves smaller amounts of dopant that cannot participate in the capacity output of the cathode. Recently, research on the partial or full replacements of electrochemically active elements in NASICON-type cathodes has received considerable attention from sodium battery researchers.80 The inclusion of multiple transition elements not only delivered structural stability but also provided enhanced capacity and voltage to the cathode materials. Ghosh et al. combined the partial replacement of electrochemically active Mn2+ ions in the NMVP cathode with substitutions of electrochemically inactive Mg2+ and Al3+ to overcome the structural changes induced by Jahn–Teller distortions in the NMVP cathode.81 The inclusion of Mg2+ ions reduced the unit cell volume and lattice parameters because the ionic radius of Mg2+ (0.72 Å) is smaller than that of Mn2+ (0.83 Å). However, there was no change with respect to Na occupancies (Na(1) and Na(2) sites were completely filled). However, exchange with significantly smaller Al3+ (0.54 Å) resulted in anisotropic changes in lattice parameters. From refinement analysis, it was proposed that the smaller Al3+ ions induced vacancies in the sodium sites. For example, Na occupancies were calculated to be 0.9557 and 0.9160 for Na(1) and Na(2) sites, respectively. The authors found that Mg2+ and Al3+ incorporations into the NMVP structure provided enhanced electrochemical stability in a controlled voltage window (2.75–3.8 V) compared with the pristine cathode. The Al-doped NMVP cathode with ample vacancies exhibited faster rate outputs and greater electrochemical stability than the Mg-doped NMVP cathode. However, Mg2+ and Al3+ incorporation did not prevent irreversible structural changes and loss of capacity upon cycling to high voltage limits (2.75–4.2 V).
Very recently, Lavela et al. documented the impact of swapping electrochemically active Cr3+ ions for Mn2+ ions in a Na4MnV(PO4)3 cathode to formulate a new NASICON-type series Na4−xMn1−xCrxV(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) (synthesized by the sol–gel technique).49 From the comparison of XRD patterns for the Na4−xMn1−xCrxV(PO4)3 samples in (Fig. 10a), the authors verified that there was a constant decrease in cell volume due to the substitution of larger Mn2+ [rMn2+ = 0.97 or 0.85 Å] ions with smaller Cr3+ [rCr3+ = 0.75 Å] ions. From CV studies of Na4−xMn1−xCrxV(PO4)3 in the voltage region 2–4.6 V, the authors established that Cr substitution significantly enhanced the reversible behavior above 4 V caused by Na+ insertion (Fig. 10b). Diffusion coefficients, which were calculated by galvanostatic and voltametric techniques, and impedance spectroscopy revealed that the presence of substantial amounts of Cr enhances sodium diffusivity and reversibility above 4 V. The authors confirmed that, among the cathodes explored in this study, the sample with x = 0.6 (Na3.4Mn0.4Cr0.6V(PO4)3) exhibited great rate capability and cycling stability (retained 82% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles) (Fig. 10c and d). From ex situ XRD analysis, it was found that single-phase (de)sodiation drove the reversible Na+ reaction in the Na3.4Mn0.4Cr0.6V(PO4)3 structure. Thus, the authors successfully overcame the irreversible phase transformation of the Na4MnV(PO4)3 cathode with Cr3+ substitution to produce Na3.4Mn0.4Cr0.6V(PO4)3. Although Cr substitution enhanced Na+ reversibility at a higher voltage, the total capacity was reduced with increased Cr content in the sample.

The use of low-cost, readily available, and electrochemically active Fe2+ as a substitute for Mn2+ ions in the Na4MnV(PO4)3 cathode material was originally reported by Xu et al.37 Specifically, new sets of Na4Mn1−xFexV(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, indexed to VM, VMF-0.75, VMF-0.5, VMF-0.25, and VF as per the x value) in the NASICON family were synthesized through the sol–gel technique and tested for use in SIBs. From XRD refinement analyses of various compositions, VMF-0.5 (Na4Mn0.5Fe0.5V(PO4)3) exhibited a moderately larger c value due to the lower sodium occupancy at the Na(1) position. Furthermore, the c-axis was expanded to a certain extent, which benefited the diffusion of Na+ ions during electrochemical (de)sodiation. More importantly, the authors compared the charge/discharge curves of VF, VMF-0.5, and VM electrodes in the voltage window 2–3.8 V at 1C. All three cathodes exhibited identical sodium storage capacities (110 mA h g−1), and the sodium storage capacity was mainly supported by multiple redox couples, V3+/V4+, Fe2+/Fe3+, and Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples, for the VF and VMF-0.5 cathodes. However, Fe2+/Fe3+ redox activity was absent for the VM cathode (the corresponding redox features were also confirmed by the CV analysis). Interestingly, the energy and rate output of VMF-0.5 and VM cathodes were superior due to the enhanced reactivity and voltage contributed by Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples (Fig. 11a–c). In situ XRD analysis was used by the authors to understand the superior sodium storage properties of Na4Mn0.5Fe0.5V(PO4)3 (Fig. 11d and e). Na+ (de)intercalation in the VMF-0.5 cathode was found to involve both single-phase and biphasic transitions with high reversibility. Notably, the VMF-0.5 cathode exhibited high cycling stability (94% capacity retention at 20C after 3000 cycles) and a high-rate capacity of 96 mA h g−1 at 20C. The VMF-0.5 and hard carbon full-cell tested by the authors supplied a full-cell energy density of 238 W h kg−1, highlighting the practical potential of the VMF-0.5 cathode. Very recently, Lavela et al. also utilized low-cost Fe cations to formulate six NASICON-type cathodes with Na4−xVFexMnx(PO4)3 stoichiometry.50 It was witnessed that the increase in the iron content in Na4−xVFexMnx(PO4)3 improved the kinetic behavior of the cathodes and thus enhanced the electrochemical performances, which was rewarded by the slight decrease in the working potential at the high voltage plateau. The authors witnessed superior kinetic behavior for the Na3.4VFe0.6Mn0.4(PO4)3 composition, which exhibited the finest electrochemical properties compared to the other composition verified by the authors.

7. Critical challenges surrounding MSVP-based cathodes and possible strategies for overcoming them
After Goodenough successfully formulated a vanadium-substituted sodium manganese-based cathode (Na4MnV(PO4)3) in 2016, manganese was substituted into the parent Na3V2(PO4)3 crystal structure. There has been substantial research activity among energy researchers seeking to develop new types of low-cost NASICON-type cathodes. In this review, we have systematically summarized the ongoing evolution of MSVP-based cathodes for use in SIBs. For example, a range of cathodes were introduced in a short time, including Na4MnV(PO4)3, Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3, Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3, Na3.4Mn0.4Cr0.6V(PO4)3, and Na4Mn0.5Fe0.5V(PO4)3(Table 2). By comparing the multidimensional aspects of the cathode materials (Scheme 4), it is observed that the electrochemical output of NVP is slightly superior to that of MSVP-based cathodes in terms of cycling stability and rate capability. However, MSVP based cathodes are superior in terms of energy density, affordability, and safety. With the global demand for greener and safer energy storage devices, MSVP-based cathodes hold their rating higher than that of NVP cathodes. In this regard, slightly reduced cycling stability output for MSVP over NVP could be affordable for the betterment of a greener world. Also, if energy researchers targeted cutting-edge synthetic methodologies and innovative scientific approaches towards MSVP cathodes, improvement in the cycling stability output of MSVP over NVP cathodes is possible. More importantly, we have compared the electrochemical outputs of MSVP-based cathodes with those of well-renowned NASICON type cathodes in terms of energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability (Table 3). It should be noted that the energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability of MSVP-based cathodes are comparable to those of standard NASCION type cathodes including Na3V2(PO4)3,82 Na3V2(PO4)2F3,83 Na3Fe2(PO4)3,84 Na3MnTi(PO4)3,45 and Na2TiV(PO4)3,85 validating that MSVP-based cathodes are not only economical but also electrochemically competitive. In a short span of time, multiple synthetic techniques, including solid-state, sol–gel, pyrosynthesis, spray–drying, and radical polymerization techniques, have been used for the fabrication of MSVP-based cathodes with good electrochemical properties. Therefore, it is essential to provide critical insights into areas requiring more attention to make MSVP the gold-standard material for SIBs.

7.1. Maximum (de)sodiation limits
The primary area we want to discuss here is the maximum (de)sodiation capacity of the cathode. Since the replacement of trivalent V ions with divalent Mn ions in the Na3V2(PO4)3 structure yielded a Na4MnV(PO4)3 cathode material containing an additional sodium ion, one might expect a high practical capacity. However, approximately only two moles of Na+ ions from Na(2) in the sodium-rich NMVP reversibly participate in sodium migration during electrochemical activity occurring between 2.4 and 3.8 V, a level similar to that of the parent NVP structure.86,87 To examine the maximum sodium extraction limit of the NMVP cathode, various research groups have sought to extend the cutoff voltage limit. With electrochemical outputs and in situ XRD data, it was demonstrated that additional Na+ ions could be extracted from Na(1) sites in the Na4MnV(PO4)3 cathode (which supplied an activated capacity of 156 mA h g−1) when it was charged above 4.4 V. However, the insertion of the 3rd Na+ ion into the Na(1) site did not follow the same pathway during the discharge process. Thus, extending the extraction limit of Na+ ions in the NMVP greatly affected the structural integrity and led to structural collapse. After supplying a high initial capacity of 156 mA h g−1, the practical capacity was reduced to below 30 mA h g−1 in later cycles. This observation validated the poor electrochemical reversibility of the NMVP cathode with a Na+ extraction above 2 moles. A recent study from Buryak et al. authenticated that extending the sodium extraction potential above 3.8 V in Na4MnV(PO4)3 could induce the development of distorted NASICON-type phases and gradual amorphization.88 More importantly, it was debated that the thermodynamic instability of the exclusively desodiated Na4MnV(PO4)3 phase is the primary reason behind its structural and electrochemical downfall rather than the kinetic limitations associated with the reversible structural changes. Interestingly, the authors further recognized that the unfavorable phase transitions were mainly associated with the local environment changes in the vanadium sites rather than the manganese sites. It was verified that the MSVP-based cathode with a reduced vanadium content exhibited higher stability in the extended voltage window than the vanadium-rich compounds. Thus the superior cycling stability seen between 2.4 and 3.8 V could be due to smaller changes in the Gibbs free energy of the first redox reaction during the charge/discharge process.89
In general, it is accepted that CNTs provide good electronic conductivity and offer electrochemical stability to polyanionic-based electrodes. Surprisingly, Umair Nisar et al. demonstrated that MWCNTs also enhanced the cycling stabilities of NMVPs at higher voltages.65 However, the role of CNTs in the reversible insertion of the 3rd Na+ ion in the NMVP structure was not clearly indicated by the author. This is clearly reflected in the extinctions of the redox positions and the voltage shapes. Additionally, the annealing temperature was reported to affect the cycling stability of NMVP over broad working voltage ranges (scientific insights behind the enhanced cyclability have yet to be elaborated), yet the large-voltage polarization and low coulombic efficiencies cannot justify its practical use.66 Thus, some inconsistencies affect the activation of the 3rd Na+ ion in the NMVP cathode. We strongly believe that proper modifications of crystal structures with suitable elements could enhance structural stability in the extended voltage region.
7.2. Electronic conductivity
Like any other polyanionic phosphate-based material, MSVP-based cathodes also suffer from poor electronic conductivity. Providing 3D interconnected conductivity with a conductive carbon background is commonly used to enhance the electronic conductivities of polyanion-based cathode materials.90 As shown by existing experimental data, the carbon scaffolding approach includes inorganic (CNT and rGO) and organic carbons (oxalic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, sucrose, agar–agar, TTEG, etc.) to address the electronic conductivity issues of MSVP cathodes (Table 2). It should be registered here that among the inorganic conductive boosters used for boosting the electrochemical properties of NMVP cathodes, rGO has been extensively used. However, the content of rGO in the NMVP/rGO composite could greatly influence the sodium storage properties.68 For example, the NMVP@rGO/AC composite with a high rGO content of 3.1 wt% exhibited inferior electrochemical sodium storage properties to the NMVP/C-rGO composite with a low rGO content of 2.14 wt%.73,74 Hence, a better optimization of the rGO content for compositing MSVP-based cathodes could help in achieving superior performance. Templating with both inorganic and organic carbon enhanced the electrochemical properties of MSVP cathodes. Since the preparation of NMVP cathodes is not well developed, the available carbon-scaffolding techniques are also limited.91 Hence, there is still substantial room for the development of unique carbon scaffolding approaches. In this regard, future material designers are urged to focus on advanced carbon-scaffolding techniques that have been used with well-established NVP cathodes. For example, heteroatom-doped (N, S) carbon with high surface reactivity could be the best choice, and it is well established for NVP cathodes.
7.3. Electrochemical structural change
The inclusion of Mn ions into NVP cathodes altered local electrostatic repulsions between octahedral and tetrahedral units due to Jahn–Teller effects from Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples. Upon electrochemical (de)sodiation, the activation of Jahn–Teller distortion was claimed for the Na4MnV(PO4)3 cathode.64 However, the experimental authentication of Jahn–Teller activity in MSVPs has yet to be evaluated. Hence, the influence of transition metal ion swapping and its impact on relationships between structural changes and electrochemical sodium storage need to be studied. This is essential for designing the best possible cathode in light of increased research on swapping multiple transition metal ions into NASICON type cathodes. A combination of modern predictions from advanced DFT techniques and machine learning should be targeted along with experimental research activities. In fact, Baltej et al. used computational predictions and predicted a vast variety of cation-swapped NASICON-type chemical combinations.80 However, the proposed cathodes should be tested experimentally by future researchers to realize the difficulties in designs and electrochemical outputs. Also, a slight change in the structural orientation due to cationic or anionic doping could vary the Na+ diffusion channels of the MSVP-based cathode by altering the lattice volume, which could improve the rate and cycling stability.92 More importantly, the dopants could stabilize the MSVP structure, which could arrest the volume fluctuation or structural alteration occurring during the electrochemical Na+ insertion/desertion process.
7.4. Other critical challenges
To conclude, we provide more critical insights into the areas of concentration for the future. Major research activities on MSVP-based cathodes have been initiated in materials engineering. Therefore, the electrochemical properties of MSVP-based cathodes arising from electrolyte design, formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI), and their impacts on cycling stability need to be understood.93,94 Moreover, binders play a crucial role in enhancing the cycling stability of any cathode material, but the effect of binders on the life cycles of MSVP-based cathodes still needs to be unlocked.95,96 The recent successful commercialization of the CATL's first-generation sodium-ion battery urged sodium-ion battery researchers to focus on practical full-cell research activities.97 From the complete survey, many reports concentrating on the electrochemical properties of diverse MSVP-based cathode materials in half-cell configurations are available. However, presently limited studies were dedicated to the evaluation of the full-cell capability with MSVP-based cathodes. Along with the conventional hard carbon anode, a metallic sulfide-based anode was also used to evaluate the full-cell feasibility of the MSVP-based cathode. The energy outputs of HC‖Na4MnV(PO4)3/C/rGO (313 W h kg−1) and MnS‖NVCMP/C/CC (150 W h kg−1) full cells at the coin-cell level were proven to be practically appealing.74,78 Yet, the real challenges can be realized only if pouch-cell or cylindrical cell assessment is performed. The establishment of a full cell depends not only on the selection of the best cathode and anode but also on the selection of electrolytes and binders in promoting the formation of a solid–electrolyte interface, which is a key factor in determining the life-cycle of any sodium-based full cells. With this important observation, we are expecting future energy engineers to focus more on the full-cell fabrication to make MSVP-based cathodes a trademark electrode material for practical SIBs.9,98 More importantly, the need for all-climate SIBs has increased in recent times.99,100 From the technical point of view, apart from the ambient operating conditions, practical SIBs will operate under harsh conditions, too. More importantly, the power capability of a battery at low temperatures is a key factor in defining the performance of a battery in practical applications such as EVs and EBs. Hence, designing SIBs that can work well at low temperatures is essential.101 Precisely, the working temperature directly affects the performance of SIBs due to the impacts on Na diffusion kinetics, dendrite growth, and parasitic reactions. Hence, the temperature tolerance of MSVP-based cathodes should be studied thoroughly to make them all-purpose energy storage electrodes.
The conducting carbon support is very essential for the electrochemical activity of polyanionic type cathodes; however, the additional carbon inclusion reduces their packing density.102 The carbon content in the MSVP composites achieved by the conventional techniques is higher, which could reduce the packing density and thus decrease the volumetric energy output. Cui et al. observed that the presence of the rGO network in the NMVP@rGO/AC composite led to a low packing density (0.40 g cm−3) than that of the NMVP@AC composite (0.47 g cm−3).73 Additionally, it is well known that the irregular particles could reduce the packing density. The MSVP cathode materials prepared via conventional preparation techniques such as solid-state, sol–gel, and wet-chemical techniques showed irregular particle shapes and thus suffered from poor packing densities. Packing density is a critical parameter in minimizing the size of the battery, and hence precise synthesis techniques in building MSVP-based cathodes with a favorable morphology and low carbon content with high electronic conductivity are of ultimate necessity.103 We also present a checklist indicating the areas that must be addressed in future research on MSVP cathodes for SIBs (Scheme 5).
 Scheme 5  Mandatory checklists to improve the practical feasibility of MSVP-based cathodes for practical applications. 
8. Opportunities for the integration of MSVP-based cathodes into various applications
Based on this comprehensive summary, it is clear that the electrochemical and structural stabilities of MSVP-based cathodes are very promising. They offer great potential for use in the near future, not only in commercial SIBs but also in a range of electrochemical applications. Hence, we offer predictions on future advances and applications of MSVPs, which will serve as a reference for the future research community.
8.1. Hosts for diverse charge carriers
Apart from the use of NASICON-based electrodes for Na+ ion storage applications in SIBs, NASICON-structured electrodes have been studied systematically in the past few years as potential hosts for various charge carriers due to their unique 3D crystalline framework.104,105 In particular, there have been numerous reports indicating that the NASICON structure can be used to store monovalent (Li+), divalent (Zn2+/Mg2+/Ca2+), and trivalent (Al3+) ions.106–110 In this regard, MSVPs from the NASICON family with outstanding 3D diffusion pathways and dimensional stability can serve as significant platforms for hosting monovalent/multivalent charge carriers. Until now, no real attempts have been made to exploit MSVPs to store various charge carriers. Strikingly, the superior electrochemical outputs of Na4MnV(PO4)3 in aqueous SIBs indicate that risk-free and low-cost MSVPs can be used in multivalent aqueous batteries, including ZIBs, aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs), calcium-ion batteries (CIBs), and magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs).68
8.2. Solid-state batteries
Developing a lightweight solid-state Na battery with a highly fire-resistant electrolyte and structurally stable cathode has been the latest trend, which not only ensures practical safety but also reduces the size of the battery due to the high volumetric energy density.111,112 At present, MSVP-based cathode materials have presented a range of performances with nonaqueous SIBs. The unique 3D Na+ diffusion pathways and superior dimensional stability of MSVPs will definitely meet the demand for long-term cycling stability and high rate capability in solid-state SIBs.113,114 Nevertheless, it will be particularly important for researchers in the area of energy storage to monitor progress with low-cost and non-toxic MSVPs and observe how MSVPs will transform the electrochemical and thermal stabilities of solid-state Na batteries.
8.3. Sodium hybrid capacitors
Although numerous NASICON-type materials have been considered as electrodes for sodium hybrid capacitors, it is obvious from this review that there is another class of NASICON-type electrode materials, i.e., MSVPs, available for implementation in electrochemical capacitors.115 We anticipate that the adoption of MSVP electrodes will improve the sustainability of sodium hybrid capacitors.
8.4. Seawater desalination applications
The capacitive deionization (CDI) technique adopts the charging process (redox reaction) of a battery for the desalination of saline water. Interestingly, the faradaic behavior of well-established electrode materials in batteries was utilized for seawater desalination, and it delivered superior sodium salt adsorption capacity and rapid chlorine removal.116 The practice of using battery materials in CDI applications has been important in desalination studies. Similarly, MSVPs exhibiting faradaic behavior can be employed in seawater desalination applications. Thus, there are many opportunities for the broader utilization of NASICON-based cathodes in diverse applications.
9. Conclusions
Since the successful development of Na4MnV(PO4)3 with reversible sodium storage properties from the Na3V2(PO4)3 NASICON material, innovations have been made to prepare other MSVP-based cathodes exhibiting reversible sodium storage. Higher energy output, lower toxicity, widespread availability, high-rate capability, and cost-effectiveness make MSVP-based cathodes safer and more useful than the parent NVP cathode. Nevertheless, multiple areas for improvement include maximizing electrochemical (de)sodiation, improving electronic conductivity, discovering suitable dopants, stabilizing SEIs, and formulating electrolytes/binders, which are open topics for research on MSVPs. Thus, we recommend the future energy researchers to focus on combined research activities designed to improve MSVPs for practical applications. Overall, the development of prospective MSVP-based cathodes is still in its premature phases. Unremitting advancement in the development of new MSVP derivatives based on cation/anion material engineering and rational synthetic protocols will decide the future usage of MSVPs in practical SIBs. In this regard, we anticipate that an increasing number of improvements will be made in the following years on MSVP-based cathodes to make them as permanent high-energy and low-cost cathodes for SIBs.
