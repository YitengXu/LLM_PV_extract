    , Accepted 1st February 2019First published on 1st February 2019AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) using bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blends of polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have witnessed significant progress in recent years. NFAs, especially, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) adopting acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structures have contributed most high-efficiency OSCs, pushing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to over 15% and 17% for single-junction and tandem devices, respectively. The vibrant development of novel FREAs is largely attributed to their versatility in manipulating energy levels and molecular ordering via chemical modification. FREAs typically feature coplanar aromatic fused-rings as D cores and two electron-deficient A units as end caps. In this review, we try to summarize the recent advancement in molecular engineering of central fused-ring cores of FREAs for high-efficiency OSCs. The impact of such core engineering on the light absorption, energy levels, electron mobility, and photovoltaic performance of the resultant FREAs is discussed. Some guidelines for future molecular design are suggested from the aspects of improving light absorption, the fill factor, the driving force and voltage loss. Finally, we give an outlook on the remaining challenges and promising directions towards the commercialization of OSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) adopting a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure have attracted considerable attention due to their unique properties including solution-processability, low cost, flexibility, semi-transparency, etc.1–4 Typically, a BHJ blend of a polymer donor and an acceptor (either fullerene or non-fullerene based) works as the photoactive layer, which is sandwiched between an ITO anode and metal cathode to fabricate OSC devices.5–7 For a long time, fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) have been the dominant acceptors for OSCs due to their high electron mobilities and anisotropic charge transport.8–10 And fullerene-based OSCs have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 11% for single-junction devices.11 However, further development of fullerene-based OSCs is severely hindered by the intrinsic characteristics of fullerene-like acceptors, which may include limited tenability for energy levels, weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, and morphological instability.12,13 To address these issues, Zhan et al.14,15 proposed the design of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structured non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). The well-known NFA, named 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyano-methylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexyl-phenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′] dithiophene, was developed and is now widely called ITIC.14,15 Since then, a large library of NFAs have been developed featuring a fused-ring donor core with side chains attached to the bridging-carbon atom and hanging out of the molecular plane in the centre, and two compact strong electron-withdrawing blocks at both ends. These fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA) based OSCs achieved excellent power conversion performance, surpassing that of fullerene-based counterparts.13 The fused-ring donating cores showcase a rigid coplanar structure to facilitate good intermolecular packing via strong π–π interactions, thereby increasing the carrier mobility on one hand.16 On the other hand, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) occurring between the electron-withdrawing ends and strong electron-donating core helps to broaden the spectral absorption range for the FREAs.17 The bridging carbon atoms are substituted with side chains not only to increase solubility, but also to alleviate the strong self-aggregation of aromatic fused-rings, which leads to small phase separation in BHJ active layers containing a blend of a FREA and polymer donor.18 However, the sp3 hybridization of bridging atoms, such as C,19 Si,20 and Ge,21,22 leads to out-of-plane substituent orientation, thereby enlarging intermolecular stacking distances, reducing the interchain π–π orbital overlap, and lowering down carrier mobilities.23,24 Extending the thiophene ring or its derivative at the periphery of the bridging C atom can increase π-conjugation, enhance crystallinity and form more compact and ordered stacking. Electron-deficient 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one (IC) and its derivatives have worked as excellent terminal A blocks in regulating molecular energy levels and forming effective channels for intermolecular electron transport through π–π interactions between the ends.25–27 In recent years, molecular engineering of FREAs has been extensively studied in terms of core, end-group, bridge, and side chain engineering, pushing the record PCE to over 15% for single-junction OSCs.28–31
As mentioned above, fused-ring electron-donating cores play an important role in manipulating the optoelectronic structure and intermolecular interaction of FREAs, thus impacting their photovoltaic performance. Most reported FREAs possess accessible fused-ring cores, such as fluorene,32–35 indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′] dithiophene (IDT),13,14,36–38 naphthalene(cyclopentadithiophene),39–41 indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT),4,15,42–44 and benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT).45–49 However, many FREAs suffer from relatively large bandgaps (≧1.5 eV) and low electron mobility (10−5 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), owing to the relatively weak electron-donating ability and intermolecular interaction of these cores.50
Several critical reviews have also been published on NFAs from the viewpoint of energy loss,51 physics,52 and molecular design.17,53,54 Reviews discussing charge generation pathways55 for different types of NFAs are also found in the literature.56–58 In addition, excellent reviews have highlighted the recent progress in the development of polymer donors,59 side chain-engineered NFAs,60 and single-junction and tandem NFAs61 for high-performance OSCs. In particular, a recent review by Zhan et al.61 proposed emerging research directions to achieve 15–20% PCEs for NFA-based OSCs with a combination of NFA design and tandem device engineering, where 2D mapping graphs of future efficiencies for tandem devices are elaborated to guide such collaborative research studies. In this review, we concentrate on molecular engineering of the central fused-ring cores of FREAs for high-efficiency OSCs. In the first part, we summarize FREAs obtained from two-level fused-ring extension strategies and elaborate a few representative model molecules in detail. The effect of core engineering on the light absorption, energy level, electron mobility, and photovoltaic performance of the resultant FREAs is discussed. Some guidelines for future molecular design are suggested from the aspects of improving light absorption, the fill factor, the driving force and voltage loss for OSCs. Finally, we give an outlook on the remaining challenges and promising future directions towards the commercialization of OSCs.
2. Fused-ring electron acceptors for NF–OSCs
As the simplest ladder-type fused-ring donating unit, IDT is formed by condensing two cyclopentadienyl groups with thiophene (T), benzene (D) and thiophene (T) moieties. In order to enhance the electron-donating ability and conjugation length of the fused-ring core, three strategies have been widely explored: (1) extension of thiophene rings at the periphery of IDT; (2) insertion of π-bridges between the fused-ring core and A terminal; (3) extending the D ring by introducing a new π-bridge into IDT-core based NFAs. In these cases, the thiophene moiety has been replaced with more electron-donating units such as thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), dithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DTT), and indacenobis-(dithieno[3,2 b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol) (INP) (Strategy 1 in Fig. 1). Aimed at locking the molecular ordering for commonly used A–D–A structured FREAs, a strategy by inserting a functional aromatic moiety between D and A units has been proposed, where non-covalent interactions can form between the fused-ring core and the π-bridge (Strategy 2 in Fig. 1). Finally, the benzene ring in the middle of IDT can be replaced with more electron-donating units like TT, BDT and naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT) (Strategy 3 in Fig. 1). The introduction of these fused aromatic moieties (ca. TT, BDT and NDT) can not only offer higher electron-donating capability but also offer a more planar structure and stronger molecular packing for the resultant FREAs, which is beneficial for π-electron delocalization.62 By coupling various extended fused-ring cores with A units (ca. IC and its derivatives), researchers have developed an ever-increasing number of FREAs for high-efficiency OSCs.
 Fig. 1  Three widely used strategies for molecular engineering of central fused-ring cores of FREAs for high-efficiency OSCs: (1) extension of fused-rings at thiophene positions in the IDT core, (2) insertion of π-bridges between the fused-ring core and A terminal, and (3) extension of fused-rings at the benzene position in the IDT core. 
2.1 IDT and IDTT-based FREAs
Benefiting from its rigid and coplanar structure, the IDT unit has been widely used to develop high-performance p-type polymeric semiconductors63 or n-type organic semiconductors. The coplanar backbone is usually functionalized at bridging sp3 C atoms with peripheral substituents (ca. tetrahexylphenyl) to ensure solution-processability and reduce intermolecular interactions for the resulting IDT materials.64 By coupling the electron-rich IDT core with the IC unit, Zhan and co-workers65 synthesized IC-1IDT-IC (Fig. 2) with an absorption extending to 730 nm for films and an optical bandgap (Egopt) of 1.70 eV. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LOMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of IC-1IDT-IC are −3.86 and −5.91 eV. Its binary OSCs with PDBT-T1 as the pairing donor delivered a PCE of 7.39%. Characteristic device data are summarized in Table 1. The sidechain engineering of IC-1IDT-IC to replace alkylphenyl substituents with alkyl provided its analogue FREAs, whose blend with PDBT-T1 improves the PCE of OSCs to 9.20% (the thickness of the active layer is 105 nm). When the thickness of the active layer is 90 nm, the as-cast OSCs yield PCEs of up to 8.71%.37 They demonstrate that planar electron acceptors can exhibit a very promising performance in OSCs and should deserve further attention.

Based on their previous work, Zhan and co-workers66 systematically probed the universality of IDIC (Fig. 2) in OSCs, and to identify promising donor materials for non-fullerene OSCs, they chose five polymer donors (PTB7-Th, J51, PDCBT, PDBT-T1, and PTFBDT-BZS) with distinct chemical structures and different electronic properties for IDIC-based OSCs. Almost all wide-bandgap polymers they used, such as PDCBT, J51, PTFBDT-BZS, and PDBT-T1, show better device performance than the control device based on narrow-bandgap PTB7-Th. In particular, both PDBT-T1 and PTFBDT-BZS show good morphological compatibility with the IDIC acceptor, which can be further improved simply by using solvent additives; the as-cast devices based on PDBT-T1:IDIC and PTFBDT-BZS:IDIC show PCEs of 8–9.2%; the solvent additive DIO further enhances the PCEs to 10.3–11% (Table 1). Furthermore, OSCs were fabricated based on the combination of a medium-bandgap polymer donor, FTAZ, and IDIC,67 which exhibit complementary absorption, matched energy levels, and pure phases in the blend on the exciton diffusion length scale. As a result, single-junction OSCs based on FTAZ:IDIC with a light manipulation scheme yield a PCE up to 12.5%. More importantly, transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that exciting either the donor or acceptor component efficiently generates mobile charges, which do not suffer from recombination to triplet states. NFAs that can form appropriate morphologies are demonstrated to push the new efficiency record.
On extending the conjugation of IDT by substituting the outer thiophene moieties with TT, a seven-ring ladder-type IDTT core was designed. The star FREA, i.e., ITIC, was successfully developed by coupling IDTT with IC units.15 Compared with the five-membered-ring IC-1IDT-IC, ITIC exhibited broadened absorption to 780 nm red-shifted by ca. 50 nm. However, the PTB7-Th:ITIC based device achieved only a PCE of 6.8%, due to the strong overlap of PTB7-Th and ITIC in the absorption spectra. When ITIC was blended with PBDB-T or J71 as the polymer donor, exciting PCEs of 11.2% and 11.4% were achieved for the OSCs fabricated by the Hou68 and Li69 groups, respectively. By blending with PBDTS-TDZ, the ITIC based OSCs contributed a high PCE of 12.80%, with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.78 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.1 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.654. More importantly, these devices were processed with just a single green solvent (o-xylene) but without any post-treatment.70 In order to reduce the electron-donating ability of IDTT, a fused-ring core named indaceno[1,2-b:1,2-b′]dibenzo[4,5-b:5,6-b′]thiophene (IDBT) was designed by replacing TT moieties of ITIC with benzothiophene units.71 The coupling of the IDBT core with IC end groups generated a new electron acceptor, NIDBT. As expected, NIDBT displays a wider Egopt of 1.84 eV and a blue-shifted absorption edge compared to ITIC. By blending with the narrow bandgap polymer PTB7-Th, NIDBT based OSCs exhibited a PCE of only 4.45% even after thermal annealing treatment.
For ITIC-like FREAs, the CC linkage between central D and end A groups will inevitably result in different steric isomers for NFAs. The existence of such stereoisomers has an unclear impact on OSC performance, which may prevent the rapid development of novel superior NFAs. In order to realize unified conformation for high-performance OSCs, Tang and his coworkers72 developed a new molecular design strategy for conformational locking of FREAs (Fig. 3). By introducing terminal hexyl chains into TT moieties of the IDTT core to enhance the steric hindrance, the corresponding FREA (ITC6-IC) was developed with an Egopt of 1.60 eV. ITC6-IC exhibited ∼5 nm blue-shifted absorption compared to ITIC in thin films while it exhibited a higher maximum molar absorption coefficient (2.64 × 105 M−1 cm−1) in comparison to ITIC (1.72 × 105 M−1 cm−1). Featuring a 0.09 eV lower LUMO than ITIC, the ITC6-IC based OSCs with PBDB-T exhibited a higher VOC of 0.97 V and FF of 0.73 than those of ITIC ones (ca. VOC = 0.91 V and FF = 0.69). As a result, a PCE of 11.61% was readily achieved for ITC6-IC based OSCs, which is higher than that of ITIC reference ones (PCE, 10.21%). Besides conformational locking, the introduced hexyl chains can greatly increase the solubility of FREAs and regulate their crystallization dynamics, which are beneficial for various solution-processing techniques for large-scale fabrication of OSCs. Layer-by-layer (LbL) processing of ITC6-IC based large area (ca. 1 cm2) devices by both spin-coating and blade-coating was demonstrated by Tang and Min et al.73 The J71:ITC6-IC based devices fabricated by LbL coating from individual solutions contributed an impressive PCE of 12.08%, even higher than that of BHJ OSCs spin-coated from their solution mixtures (11.32% PCE). The LbL doctor-bladed 1 cm2 devices exhibited a maximum PCE of 10.35%, with a JSC of 16.16 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.973 V, and FF = 65.79%. This PCE is the record efficiency of large-area LbL OSCs reported in the literature so far. The observed J71/ITC6-IC LbL layer is neither the real bilayer nor the pseudo-bilayer without miscibility-induced interdiffusion crossover (a p–i–n like bilayer, see Fig. 3c). In fact, interdiffusion of ITC6-IC into the J71 donor layer during deposition of ITC6-IC results in an intermixed heterojunction in the LbL layer, caused by swelling of J71 in chloroform solvent used to deposit ITC6-IC. These results indicate that the LbL method is an effective way to control the morphology of photovoltaic materials and to fabricate high-performance OSCs, and the LbL processing approach is highly promising for the future industrial production of OSCs.

ITIC possesses a relatively high HOMO energy level of −5.48 eV, which leads to limited compatibility with high-performance electron donors, especially moderate- or wide-bandgap donors with HOMO levels of ca. −5.4 eV and even deeper, such as PDBT-T1, implying that there is room to improve the performance of ITIC. Zhan et al. replaced the phenyl side-chain of ITIC with 2-thienyl to afford ITIC-Th as a new FREA, which shows stronger absorption than ITIC.43 Relative to ITIC, ITIC-Th exhibits both lower energy levels (ITIC-Th: HOMO/LUMO = −5.66 eV/−3.93 eV; ITIC: HOMO/LUMO = −5.48 eV/−3.83 eV) due to the σ-inductive effect of thienyl side-chains. Moreover, ITIC-Th has higher electron mobility (6.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than ITIC (2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to the enhanced intermolecular interactions induced by sulfur–sulfur interactions. The PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th and PDBT-T1:ITIC-Th-based OSCs exhibited PCEs up to 8.7% and 9.6%, respectively. The OSCs fabricated by the Yan group by blending ITIC-Th with a polymer donor, PTFB-O, achieved an exciting PCE of 10.88%.74 Sun and co-workers75 used ITIC-Th to fabricate ternary blend OSCs, which exhibited a PCE of 10.27%.
By introducing fluorine atoms into the end-capping IC group of ITIC-Th, Zhan and co-workers76 designed and synthesized a new fluorinated FREA, ITIC-Th1 (Fig. 2). An Egopt of 1.55 eV was estimated for ITIC-Th1, 0.05 eV smaller than that of ITIC-Th, which would benefit harvesting low-energy photons and enhancing JSC. Analysis of the active layer morphology found that FTAZ:ITIC-Th1 BHJ films exhibit stronger molecular packing and longer coherence length, leading to more electrons and holes yet balanced mobilities. Moreover, FTAZ:ITIC-Th1 films present smaller domain sizes to afford more D/A interfaces for exciton dissociation and reduce monomolecular recombination. As a result, non-fullerene OSCs based on FTAZ:ITIC-Th1 exhibit PCEs as high as 12.1%, significantly higher than those of BHJ devices based on FTAZ:nonfluorinated ITIC-Th (8.88%) and FTAZ:PC71BM (5.22%). Their work demonstrates that the fluorinated acceptor ITIC-Th1 is very promising for high-performance OSCs.
By the replacement of the TT of ITIC with DTT, a new nine-membered-ring FREA named INIC was designed.77 INIC has a film absorption edge at 790 nm, which is only 10 nm red-shifted by ITIC. However, INIC exhibits a stronger absorption ability than ITIC, reflected by the higher molar extinction coefficient (2.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for INIC and 1.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for ITIC). INIC was found to have an absorption spectrum complementary to that of FTAZ. As a wide bandgap (Egopt = 2.0 eV) polymer donor, FTAZ exhibits a strong absorption at 400–620 nm. FTAZ:INIC based OSCs achieved a PCE of 7.7%, JSC of 13.51 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.957 V, and FF of 0.579. On further end group engineering of the IC with mono- or difluoro-substituents, INIC analogue acceptors (INIC1, INIC2 and INIC3) were designed. The introduction of fluorinated IC end groups leads to lower LUMO energy levels and thus narrower Eg for INIC1-3 (Table 1). The PCE of the FTAZ:INIC2-based device significantly enhances from 7.7% to >10%, due to its significantly increased JSC (from 13.51 to 17.56 mA cm−2) and FF (from 57.9% to 66.8%.) In particular, the device based on difluorinated INIC3 showed the best PCE of 11.5%, and its JSC was further increased to 19.44 mA cm−2 while its FF was increased to 67.4% (Table 1).
By introducing a pyrrol ring into the TT of IDTT, Tang and his co-workers78 designed a new nine-membered-ring core called indacenobis(dithieno[3,2 b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol) (INP). The coupling of INP with the electron-deficient unit 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) generated a new FREA, INPIC-4F. This FREA exhibited an absorption extending to the near-infrared region, with a film absorption edge at 892 nm and an Egopt of 1.39 eV. The film absorption edge of INPIC-4F is ca. 54 nm red-shifted in comparison to that of difluorinated INIC3, revealing the stronger electron-donating ability of INP than IDT or IDTT. For comparison, INPIC, by coupling the INP core with IC, was also prepared, and it has an Egopt of 1.46 eV and a film absorption edge at 850 nm. Molecular simulation results show the existence of a rigid and coplanar π-conjugated framework. Featuring favourable crystallinity and a well-defined bi-continuous network in blend films, INPIC-4F derived devices with the PBDB-T donor showed an impressive PCE of 13.13% with a JSC of 21.61 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.715 and a VOC of 0.85 V, featuring a relatively low Eloss of 0.54 eV. Further crystallization dynamics study revealed the high tendency of INPIC-4F to form polycrystalline spherulites with fast molecular ordering compared to the polymer donor, resulting in large phase separation and a device efficiency below 10%.79 Retarding FREA crystallization using hot substrates for solution-processing of BHJ blends was demonstrated as an effective strategy to realize stable and high-efficiency devices.
In order to systematically compare the effects of different core sizes on device performance, Zhan and co-workers80 reported four FREAs with the same end-groups and side-chains but different cores, whose sizes range from 5 to 11 fused rings. These FREAs were named F5IC, F7IC, F9IC, and F11IC, respectively (their structures shown in Fig. 2). Increasing the core size from 5 to 11 fused rings up-shifts the HOMO level from −5.82 to −5.44 eV and the LUMO level from −4.05 to −3.94 eV, leading to a decrease of Egopt from 1.64 to 1.47 eV. As the acceptor core size extends from 5 to 11 fused rings, the molecular packing becomes stronger, and the electron mobility increases from 8.1 × 10−5 to 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in pure acceptor films. In binary-blend devices, as the acceptor core size extends from 5 to 9 fused rings, the best PCE increases from 5.6 to 11.7% (Table 1). Due to the low solubility of F11IC, no photovoltaic effect was observed from FTAZ/F11IC-based OSCs. As the acceptor core size extends from 5 to 9 fused rings, the best PCE increases from 6.3 to 12.6% when using F11IC as the third component to fabricate ternary-blend devices. The ternary-blend OSCs yield a higher VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE than their binary counterparts (Table 1).
The larger fused ring exhibits stronger light absorption in the near-infrared region (NIR). Based on this idea, IUIC (Fig. 2) was synthesized by coupling a fused-11-ring core, IU, with 2FIC and has an Egopt of 1.41 eV and a film absorption edge at 879 nm.81 For comparison, ITIC4 (Fig. 2), by coupling a fused-7-ring core, IT, with 2F-IC, was also prepared and has an Egopt of 1.52 eV and a film absorption edge at 816 nm. IUIC shows higher HOMO (−5.45 eV) and LUMO (−3.87 eV) energy levels relative to ITIC4 (HOMO = −5.77 eV and LUMO = −3.97 eV), due to the larger π-conjugation and stronger electron-donating ability of the IU core in IUIC. As a result, the as-cast OSCs based on PTB7-Th:IUIC without any extra treatment yield PCEs of up to 11.2%, higher than that of the control device based on PTB7-Th:ITIC4 (8.18%). The as-cast semi-transparent OSCs based on PTB7-Th:IUIC exhibit a champion PCE of 10.2%, higher than that of the control device based on PTB7-Th:ITIC4 (6.42%). These results demonstrate the great potential of the fused-11-ring unit IU for constructing NIR-absorbing non-fullerene acceptors used for high-performance semi-transparent OSCs.
Introducing a π-bridge into IDT-core-based NFAs is another effective way for further enhancing the electron-donating ability and extending the conjugation length. By inserting a π-bridging thiophene moiety between the IDT core and IC end group, a novel acceptor, DC-IDT2T (structure in Fig. 4), was developed by Zhan and co-workers.82 Solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on PBDTTT-C-T:DC-IDT2T showed a moderate PCE of 3.93%. Furthermore, by introducing 2-ethylhexyl into the bridged thiophene of DC-IDT2T, a new FREA called IEIC was synthesized.14 Long alkyl chains increase the solubility of the IEIC, allowing the PTB7-Th:IEIC blended film to get a relatively smooth surface and a nearly uniform crystallite size. The device based on PTB7-Th:IEIC showed a PCE of 6.31% with a high VOC of 0.97 V but a low FF of 0.48, implying that there is room to improve the performance of IEIC. The low PCE was found to be due to the mismatch between PTB7-Th and IEIC for overlapping absorption.83 The OSCs obtained by blending IEIC with PffT2-FTAZ-2DT exhibited an increased PCE of 7.3% and a FF of 0.59, which can be attributed to the complementary absorption of PffT2-FTAZ-2DT and IEIC at 450–800 nm. Moreover, Zhan et al.84 systematically explored the effect of sidechain lengths on photovoltaic performance by preparing IEIC1, IEIC2 and IEIC3 for a comparison study (structures shown in Fig. 4). The result showed that increasing the length of side chains slightly down-shifted the HOMO energy levels and up-shifted the LUMO energy levels, thereby increasing VOC from 0.84 to 0.95 V gradually. Via the steric hindrance effect, PTB7-Th:IEIC3 based OSCs exhibited the highest PCE of 7.4%.
 Fig. 4  Chemical structures of some representative FREAs based on IDT, IDTT and their extended fused-ring cores. 
It is well known that narrow bandgap FREAs can match well with wide or medium bandgap polymer donors. There are two main ways to reduce the Egopt of organic semiconductor materials: (i) introduction of conjugated backbones with quinoid features85–87 and/or π-electron push–pull effects; (ii) introduction of strong electron-donating groups such as alkoxy88 or alkyl amino89 side groups. Inspired by the first strategy, ATT-2 was synthesized by Zhu et al.,90 which showed a strong NIR absorption at 600–940 nm with an Egopt of 1.32 eV. Furthermore, ATT-2 and PTB7-Th can exhibit complementary absorption in the NIR region, which is beneficial for obtaining high-performance semi-transparent OSCs. The device of PTB7-Th:ATT-2 showed a high PCE of 9.58% for opaque OSCs and 7.74% for single-junction semi-transparent OSCs. Utilizing the second strategy, through introducing alkoxy with a strong electron-donating ability into IEIC, Hou et al.91 designed and synthesized a new FREA (IEICO) with an Egopt of 1.34 eV, which is 0.16 eV smaller than that of IEIC (1.50 eV). By adopting PBDTTT-E-T as the donor material, the IEICO-based OSCs showed a PCE of 8.4% with a high VOC of 0.85 V, which is much better than the performance of the PBDTTT-E-T:IEIC-based device (4.9% PCE). The Egopt of FREAs can be reduced by utilizing the ICT effect in the donor and acceptor. In order to enhance the ICT effect, IEICO-4F was developed by replacing the IC end group IEICO with 2FIC, leading to an ultra-narrow Egopt of 1.24 eV.92 When blended with six different polymer donors (PBDTTT-E-T, PBDTS-DTBTO, PBQ-3, PBDB-T, PBDTTT-EFT and J52), high JSC values over 20 mA cm−2 were all recorded for the corresponding OSC devices with a low Eloss of approximately 0.5 eV. The JSC was further improved to 25.3 cm−2 for J52:PBDTTT-EFT:IEICO-4F based ternary OSCs. In addition, introducing fluorinated end capping groups and alkylthio chains can significantly red-shift the absorption and enhance the crystallinity of the resultant FREAs. Based on this strategy, Yan et al.93 designed and synthesized a narrow-bandgap FREA named IEICS-4F, which shows a strong crystallinity and high electron mobility. PTB7-Th:IEICS-4F-based OSCs exhibited a PCE of 10.3% and 7.5% for single-junction opaque and semi-transparent OSCs, respectively. To further enhance the light harvesting ability of the semi-transparent devices, a non-fullerene tandem OSC with P3TEA:FTTB-PDI4 as the front subcell and PTB7-Th:IEICS-4F as the rear subcell was assembled for the first time, and it achieved a high PCE of 10.5% with an average transmittance (AT) of 20%.
Bo et al.25 employed non-covalent intramolecular interactions to construct super-large FREAs. Supramolecular interactions can lock the flat conformation of the IDT-BOC6 acceptor, which significantly extended the effective conjugation and broadened the absorption spectrum. PBDB-T:IDT-BOC6 based OSCs achieved a PCE of 9.60%. In contrast, the device based on its analogue IDT-BC6 only gave a PCE of 2.30%, attributed to a lack of such interactions in the solid state to secure a flat conformation. Similarly, Huang et al.94 designed a FREA named IDT-Tz by employing thiazole rings as the π-bridges. As a result, sulfur–nitrogen (S⋯N) non-covalent conformational locks were formed, which enhanced the rigidity and planarity of the backbone. The conformational locking reduced the reorganization energy and increased the charge transport mobility, thus enhancing the photovoltaic performance. The device based on PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz showed a PCE of 8.4%, much higher than that of IDT-T based devices (4.1%). By inserting a 3-carboxylated thiophene as the bridge, the acceptor IDT-3MT was developed.95 An oxygen–sulfur (S⋯O) noncovalent conformational lock may form between the oxygen atom in the ester moiety and sulfur atom in the IDT core. A more prominent face-on orientation and finer surface morphology were observed for PBDB-T:IDT-3MT BHJ films in comparison to PBDB-T:IDT-T ones, which can facilitate charge transportation in the vertical direction. As a result, the OSCs based on IDT-3MT exhibited a highly improved PCE of 8.40% than those based on the IDT-T acceptor bearing thiophene bridges (6.36%). In order to further explore the synergistic effect of non-covalent bond conformational locks and enhanced terminal electron-deficiency to improve the ICT effect, Bo et al.96 designed and synthesized ITOIC-2Cl by introducing bis(alkoxy)-substituted thiophene rings and chlorine atoms into the IDT unit. The interactions of S⋯O and O⋯H in the FREA helped to form non-covalent bond conformational locks to attain good backbone planarity in the solid state. But these interactions are not strong enough to lock the coplanar conformation in solution, thus simultaneously endowing ITOIC-2Cl with good solubility. The PBDB-T:ITOIC-2Cl based devices obtained a high PCE of 9.37%, with a VOC of 0.886 V, JSC of 17.09 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.618. These results demonstrated the efficacy of the conformation lock strategy for designing high-performance FREAs. It should be noted that the introduction of long alkyl chains can enhance the solubility of FREAs, but at the same time it can also obstruct ordered packing of FREAs, which affects the performance of OSCs. To solve this problem, two alkoxyl sidechains were introduced into the fused-ring core, and the resultant IDTOT2F simultaneously achieved high solubility and ordered packing in the film.97 PBDB-T:IDTOT2F based OSCs with a maximum PCE of 12.79% were realized without any extra treatment. In comparison, IDTT2F and IEICO-4F-based devices only gave PCEs of 8.85 and 8.66%, respectively.
By further sidechain engineering of the bridging unit with propylenedioxythiophene (PDOT) and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), Bo and co-workers98 developed IDT-PDOT and IDT-EDOT (chemical structures shown in Fig. 4). The morphological study revealed that IDT-EDOT exhibited better molecular ordering than IDT-PDOT and even IEICO-4F, due the larger steric hindrance from the substituents on the T unit. As a result, more efficient charge transport and collection were achieved for the PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT blend, leading to a higher JSC of 21.34 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.62 and thus a higher PCE (11.32%). IDT-PDOT-based OCSs obtained only 2.18% PCE. These results demonstrated that the sidechain engineering of the π-bridging unit of FREAs is effective to improve the photovoltaic performance.
By inserting a vinyl as the π-bridging unit into the OSC molecule IDT-IC, a near-infrared FREA (SJ-IC) was developed.99 The SJ-IC film shows a narrower Egopt of 1.49 eV than IDT-IC (1.72 eV). The introduction of the CC double bond improved the electron mobility of SJ-IC and also its crystallinity, which makes its BHJ films with the J61 donor easier to cause appropriate phase separation. Their OSCs demonstrated a high JSC of 16.99 mA cm−2 and a FF 0.66 and thus a PCE of 9.27%. As a comparison, J61:IDT-IC based devices just exhibited a JSC of 13.70 mA cm−2 and 6.95% PCE, which should be ascribed to the red-shifted and broadened absorption of SJ-IC. The near-infrared absorption of the acceptor should be beneficial to its future application in semi-transparent and tandem OSCs. In addition, by introducing a double-bond π-bridge into ITIC and fluorine substitution on its electron-accepting end groups, Li et al.100 synthesized three new FREAs, ITVIC, ITVfIC, and ITVffIC, with Egopt values of 1.40 eV, 1.37 eV, and 1.35 eV, respectively. The corresponding HOMO levels are −5.46 eV, −5.56 eV, and−5.58 eV. By blending different acceptors with J71, they found that the JSC of the corresponding OSCs was closely related to the ΔEHOMO between the donor and the acceptor. The device based on J71:ITVffIC demonstrated a PCE of 10.54% with a high JSC of 20.60 mA cm−2 and a VOC of 0.81 V, which is the highest efficiency reported for OSCs based on a NIR photovoltaic material with an Egopt of <1.4 eV. The results indicate that ITVffIC is a promising narrow band gap NIR acceptor for application in tandem, single-junction, semi-transparent, and ternary OSCs. Based on previous work, Li et al.101 fabricated semi-transparent OSCs with 15 nm Ag as the top cathode and PTB7-Th:ITVfIC as the active layer. The semi-transparent OSC based on PTB7-Th:ITVfIC (1:2, w/w) without extra treatments, such as use of additives, and thermal and solvent annealing, shows a relatively high PCE of 8.21% with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 26.40% between 370 and 740 nm, and an average transmittance (AT) of 33.71% between 400 and 600 nm.
By introducing the extended conjugated bridging unit, sunlight at short wavelength can be used more efficiently. Li and co-workers102 designed and synthesized a new acceptor, ITVT, by introducing thienylenevinylene thiophene (TVT) as the π bridge between the IDT core and the IC terminals. Benefiting from the conjugated TVT side groups, the small molecule ITVT shows a strong absorption at the short wavelength range (300–500 nm). In addition, ITVT exhibits a narrow Egopt of 1.48 eV and a medium electron mobility (μe) of 1.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The as-cast PBZ:ITVT OSCs with a D/A weight ratio of 1:2 give a PCE up to 5.84% with a VOC of 0.96 V, a JSC of 14.22 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.427. Similar to this, Chen et al.103 designed and synthesized a new non-fullerene acceptor, ITTIC, by inserting a thiophene ring between the IDTT core and the IC terminal groups of ITIC. ITTIC shows a narrower band gap of 1.46 eV and a red-shifted absorption compared with ITIC. Moreover, the LUMO level of ITTIC was raised from −4.00 to −3.82 eV due to the electron-donating property of thiophene. Interestingly, the optimized devices gave an outstanding efficiency of 9.12% with a small Eloss of 0.54 eV at a negligible ΔEHOMO of 0.02 eV.
In order to broaden the absorption spectrum, adding a narrow bandgap material into the binary system is a good way to improve photovoltaic performance. However, the charge recombination in narrow bandgap materials and poor compatibility with other components limited their applications. To solve this problem, Zhan et al.104 suggested that the HOMO and LUMO of the third component should be similar to the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor in the binary system. And two FREAs, ITIC-Th-O and ITIC-Th-S, were thus synthesized based on the ITIC-Th. The introduction of the oxyhexylthiophene and thiohexyl-thiophene π-bridging units causes down-shifted LUMO energy levels and the up-shifted HOMO energy levels (−3.86 eV/−5.41 eV for ITIC-Th-S and −3.91 eV/−5.36 eV for ITIC-Th-O) relative to ITIC-Th. When they were added into FTAZ:IDIC-based binary OSCs (−5.35 eV, HOMO of FTAZ and −3.91 eV, LUMO of IDIC), the device based on FTAZ:ITIC-Th-O:IDIC has more efficient charge transport due to the formation of the optimized energy level alignment. As a result, the FTAZ:ITIC-Th-O:IDIC-based device achieved a higher PCE of 11.6% with a JSC of 18.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.719 compared to the device based on FTAZ:ITIC-Th-S:IDIC (10.4% PCE).
In order to compare traditional structures and inverted structures, Zhan and his co-workers105 chose PBDTTT-C-T:DC-IDT2F as the active layer to fabricate non-fullerene OSCs. Owing to the fact that the active layer in the inverted structure showed a smoother surface, smaller interconnected domains and smaller phase separation, the device based on PBDTTT-C-T:DC-IDT2F OSCs showed a PCE of 3.08% for the inverted structure while a low PCE of 2.26% was achieved for the conventional structure.
2.2 TT-extended fused-ring core based FREAs
Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), as a strong electron-donating moiety, features good planarity, strong intermolecular interactions, tight molecular packing and enhanced electron mobility. In order to enhance the electron-donating ability of the fused-ring core, Zhan et al. developed the FREA IHIC (Fig. 5) by replacing the benzene ring in the centre of the IDT core with the TT unit.106 IHIC exhibits strong NIR absorption with an extinction coefficient of up to 1.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in the 600–900 nm range, a narrow optical band gap of 1.38 eV and a high μe of up to 2.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The film absorption edge of IHIC is ca. 170 nm red-shifted in comparison to that of IDTIC, and even red-shifted by 110–120 nm than that of the larger seven-fused ring acceptor ITIC and the nine-membered-ring INIC, revealing the stronger electron-donating ability of TT than benzene. The PTB7-Th:IHIC blended semi-transparent device contributed a high PCE of 9.7%.

Jen and his co-workers107,108 also found that the simple replacement of the benzene unit in IDT or IDTT core with TT can enhance the electron-donating ability of the fused-ring core. By utilizing a rigid fused-ring, thiophene–thieno[3,2-b]thiophene–thiophene (4T), as the central donating core and IC as the terminal accepting unit, they developed a new narrow-bandgap FREA named 4TIC (Fig. 5). Due to the lower resonance stabilization energy of thiophene than benzene, more efficient electron delocalization occurs in the 4T framework. In thin films, 4TIC shows a broadened absorption spectrum with a low energy onset at ∼900 nm, which is red-shifted by ∼100 nm compared to that of ITIC. In addition, 4T has a more rigid and extended π-conjugation to offer more room for arranging sidechains to avoid twisting the backbone.107 More efficient molecular packing and higher electron transport were observed for 4TIC in comparison to highly disordered ITIC (Fig. 6a and b). The as-cast 4TIC thin films showed a quite good crystalline order. PTB7-Th:4TIC BHJ blends showed the dominant diffractions of the polymer donor with weak peak signals for 4TIC, leading to ordered structures. Besides, PTB7-Th:4TIC showed a quite different RSoXS profile (Fig. 6c), with broad and elevated intensities from 0.003 to 0.01 Å−1. Therefore, a quite broad length scale (63–210 nm) of phase separation exists in PTB7-Th:4TIC blends.92,109,110 The broader length scale of phase separation and better structural order in blends contribute to the improved JSC and FF of solar cells. PTB7-Th:4TIC based OSCs exhibited a high PCE of 10.43% and a relatively low non-ideal photon Eloss of 0.33 eV. As a demonstration, integrating the PTB7-Th:4TIC system with the PBDB-T-ITIC cell into a tandem architecture further improved the device performance to 12.62% due to the reduced transmission loss, which is beneficial for higher PCEs of OSCs.

By incorporating two thiophene moieties with the 4T core, Jen's group further developed a 6T block, which was end-capped with IC to generate a narrow bandgap FREA, namely 6TIC.108 Compared with 4TIC, the rigid and extended π-conjugation of the 6T core endows 6TIC with a more electron-rich nature and some distinctive properties, such as a narrower bandgap, better molecular packing, and higher μe. Consequently, the device based on PTB7-Th:6TIC exhibits a high PCE of 11.07% with a high JSC > 20 mA cm−2 and a high VOC of 0.83 V with a relatively low Eloss (≈0.55 V). Moreover, the PTB7-Th:6TIC based semi-transparent OSC exhibited a relatively high PCE (7.62%). The devices achieved both a high PCE and high JSC, which is quite rare for OSCs.
After that, by introducing monofluoro atoms into the end groups of 6TIC, Zhan et al.111 reported a novel FREA named FOIC.
FOIC exhibited a narrow band gap of 1.32 eV and a strong absorption at 600–950 nm. The introduction of fluorine atoms enhances the ICT effect, which is beneficial to charge transport and dissociation. The device based on PTB7-Th:FOIC obtained a PCE of 12.0% with a VOC of 0.743 V, a high JSC of 24.0 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.671 and a high μe of 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. When fabricated for semi-transparent OSCs, the PTB7-Th:FOIC-based device obtained a PCE of 10.3% at an AVT of 37.4%. Subsequently, Ma and coworkers112 fabricated PBDB-T:FOIC-based binary OSCs by blade-coating. The μe of the PBDB-T:FOIC-based device is much larger than μh as a result of the high crystallinity of FOIC. When a third component, PTB7-Th, was added, the crystallinity of FOIC decreased due to the good miscibility between PTB7-Th and FOIC. PTB7-Th also promoted the light absorption since its absorption spectrum is complementary to that of the binary system. An optimal blade-coated device based on PBDB-T:PTB7-Th:FOIC blends at a PTB7-Th content of 50% presented a high PCE of 12.02% with a FF of 0.658 and a JSC of 24.61 mA cm−2. Therefore, the combination of the blade coating method and the ternary organic solar cell strategy is an effective method to improve the photovoltaic performance of the device. In order to enhance the photon utilization efficiency and reduce thermal loss, the electron acceptor named FOIC was employed for the rear sub-cells in tandem OSCs fabricated by Yang et al.113 The adjustable energy levels of FREAs enhance the selectivity of the electron acceptor material, which is beneficial to the adjustment of the photovoltaic parameters of the rear sub-cells in the tandem OSCs, thereby balancing the voltage–current trade-off in tandem organic photovoltaics. The corresponding tandem device achieved a PCE of 13.3%.
In order to systematically study the effect of different core sizes on performance, Zhan and co-workers114 developed three FREAs (F6IC, F8IC, and F10IC) by coupling the electron-deficient unit 2FIC with fused-6-ring, fused-8-ring, and fused-10-ring electron-rich cores, respectively. Increasing the core size from 6 rings to 10 rings significantly upshifts the HOMO level from −5.66 to −5.26 eV, while it slightly upshifts the LUMO level from −4.02 to −3.96 eV, leading to the decrease of Egopt from 1.36 to 1.25 eV (Fig. 7a and b). A higher LUMO level is beneficial to higher VOC, while a narrower band gap is beneficial to higher JSC. These three molecules exhibit strong absorption from 600 to 1000 nm and high electron mobility (μe = 1.0 × 10−3 to 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), which are comparable to those of fullerene acceptors. The electron mobility does not have a linear correlation with the core size, and F8IC exhibits the highest mobility due to the stronger π–π stacking. OSCs were fabricated based on the blends of these electron acceptors and PTB7-Th. Since F8IC and PTB7-Th exhibit complementary absorption, and matched energy levels and mobilities, F8IC based blends exhibit a small domain size, yet efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, and negligible bimolecular recombination. PTB7-Th:F8IC OSCs exhibited higher JSC, FF, and PCE values than F6IC and F10IC-based ones. F8IC based OSCs show the best PCE of 10.9%, higher than those of F6IC (7.1%) and F10IC (10.2%) based counterparts. Finally, the ternary-blend OSCs based on PTB7-Th/F8IC/PC71BM yielded a JSC as high as 26.00 mA cm−2 and a PCE as high as 12.3%.114 The core engineering of FREAs is demonstrated to be a promising approach to elevate energy levels, enhance absorption and electron mobility, and thus achieve a high device performance for OSCs. This approach is superior to the commonly used end group engineering in terms of realizing a synergistic enhancement in both VOC and JSC.101

2.3 BDT-extended fused-ring core based FREAs
BDT-based molecules have been synthesized since 1980, and their electrical conducting properties have been extensively studied.115 BDT is an electron-rich unit with a symmetrical structure and a high degree of planarity. In 2002, Yamamoto et al.116 reported a series of BDT-based polymers and found that such polymers have good hole mobility. Due to their good optoelectronic performance, BDT-based blocks have been widely used as electron-donating units in the field of organic optoelectronics in the past few years. A general methodology for straightforward access to 4,8-functionalized BDTs was proposed by Tang's group,117 which can be used to construct a library of BDT core centred conjugated systems, featuring a large fused-ring structure and good charge mobility. BDT-based polymers donors such as PBDB-T and PTB7-Th have contributed many record PCEs during the rapid development of BHJ OSCs in recent years. Nonetheless, BDT units are rarely used in FREAs.
In order to absorb more photons and improve JSC, Chen and coworkers49 applied the BDT unit into FREAs to develop a novel A–D–A structured electron acceptor (NFBDT, chemical structure shown in Fig. 8). The introduction of BDT allows NFBDT to have a more planar backbone, which enhances the electron-donating ability of the intermediate core and avoids excessive self-aggregation of blend films, thereby promoting charge transport and dissociation. As a result, NFBDT has a narrow Egopt of 1.56 eV, which makes it have a good absorption between 600 and 800 nm (Fig. 9a). When combined with a wide band gap polymer, PBDB-T, a considerable PCE of 10.42% was achieved with a JSC of 17.85 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.868 V and a FF of 0.672. On further exploring the effect of end-capping groups on photovoltaic performance, two FREAs with different end groups, NFBDT-F and NFBDT-Me, respectively, were synthesized.45 Compared to NFBDT-Me, NFBDT-F has a narrower Egopt (1.50 eV for NFBDT-F and 1.58 eV for NFBDT-Me) and deeper LUMO energy level (−3.88 eV for NFBDT-F and −3.78 eV for NFBDT-Me) as a result of the introduction of strong electron-withdrawing fluorine into the end group to enhance the ICT effect. The device based on PBDB-T:NFBDT-F obtained a PCE of 10.62% with a VOC of 0.793 V and a JSC of 19.28 mA cm−2. In contrast, the introduced methyl chain caused the LUMO energy level to rise, which is beneficial to the VOC. NFBDT-Me exhibited a blue-shifted absorption, and the device achieved a PCE of 11.00% with a VOC of 0.909 V and a JSC of 17.30 mA cm−2 when blended with PBDB-T. In order to improve the FF of NFBDT-based FREAs, a new FREA, ITIC5, was designed and synthesized by replacing the benzene ring in the IC terminal group of ITIC1 (Fig. 8) with thiophene.118 Compared to ITIC1, ITIC5 has a narrower Egopt of 1.53 eV and a red shifted maximum at 718 nm. Film morphology studies showed that J71:ITIC5 films present dense and continuous networks and the crystallinity of the J71:ITIC5 blend film is enhanced after thermal annealing, which contributes to a high μe of 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a FF of 0.755. The device based on J71:ITIC5 exhibited a high PCE of 12.5% with a VOC of 0.897 V and a JSC of 18.48 mA cm−2.

Different from Chen's design strategy, for the purpose of extending the intramolecular conjugation and enhancing the intermolecular π–π stacking, Zhan et al.119 developed ITIC2 by introducing conjugated side chains into the benzene vacancies in the BDT core. ITIC2 exhibits relatively high HOMO and LUMO energy levels (−5.43 and −3.80 eV, respectively) but a narrow Egopt of 1.53 eV. For comparison, ITIC1 was also synthesized without any substituents on the BDT unit. The introduction of two conjugated side chains extended intramolecular conjugation, thereby increasing the absorption. The ITIC2 showed an absorption peak at 714 nm, which redshifted by 12 nm relative to that of ITIC1, and a higher absorption extinction coefficient of 2.7 × 105 M−1 cm−1 than ITIC1 (1.5 × 105 M−1 cm−1). The GIWAXS results showed that the crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) of ITIC1 and ITIC2 π–π stacking are calculated to be 2.8 and 3.1 nm, respectively, which indicates that ITIC2 has a stronger molecular packing for the as-cast films. In addition, the as-cast FTAZ:ITIC2 films exhibited a smaller domain size (≈10 nm) than FTAZ:ITIC1 films (≈15 nm), which is beneficial to charge separation. As a result, FTAZ:ITIC2 based devices obtained a PCE of 11.0% with a VOC of 0.925 V, a JSC of 18.88 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.630 and a μe of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Feasible energy level tuning has been demonstrated by modifying the electron-donating ability of the D unit and the electron-withdrawing ability of the A unit.120 Such a FREA named NCBDT was developed by simultaneous core and end group engineering.46 The BDT core was attached with octyl sidechains to up-shift the HOMO energy level, while the monofluoro IC group was used to down-shift both HOMO and LUMO energy levels. As a result, NCBDT obtained a narrow Egopt of 1.45 eV and correspondingly enhanced absorption after the energy level modulation. In comparison to NFBDT, morphological studies have found that the introduction of octyl chains resulted in a larger interchain distance, but a smaller π–π stacking distance, which is favorable for charge transport. The device based on PBDB-T:NCBDT obtained an outstanding PCE of 12.12% with a high JSC of >20 mA cm−2. Surprisingly, a VOC of 0.839 V that is only slightly different from that of NFBDT-based OSCs (0.868 V) is obtained, which provides us with ideas for synthesizing materials to balance voltage and the current output. The same group used the same strategy and developed NOBDT in order to meet the needs of the rear subcell in tandem OSCs.121 It is well known that tandem OSCs have a high VOC but a poor JSC, which is determined by the sub-cell. The replacement of the octyl group in NCBDT with an octyloxy group led to an elevated HOMO level (−5.26 eV) while it led to an unchanged LUMO level (−3.89 eV) for NOBDT, which thereby achieved a narrow Egopt of 1.37 eV and an extended absorption. The tandem OSCs consisting of a front subcell (PBDB-T:F-M) and a rear subcell (PTB7-Th:NOBDT) achieved a remarkable PCE of 14.11% with a VOC of 1.71 V, a JSC of 11.72 mA cm−2 and a surprising FF of 0.7 (the device architecture shown in Fig. 9b).
As can be seen from the above-discussed core engineering, extending the absorption range of FREAs plays a very important role in improving OSC performance. Chen's group synthesized the FREA NNBDT by using naphthyl-fused indanone (NINCN) as the terminal group.122 The NINCN group can extend the conjugation to enhance absorption, while it also makes the VOC and JSC more balanced. Morphological research showed that the PBDB-T:NNBDT film featuring grain-like domains exhibited a root-mean-square surface roughness value of 1.95 nm, which caused a small phase separation. The device based on PBDB-T:NNBDT exhibited a high single-junction efficiency of 11.7% with a FF of 0.717 and a low Eloss of 0.55 eV. When a third component, FDNCTF, was added, the root-mean-square surface roughness value increased to 3.17 nm and a more ordered morphology was obtained, which facilitates charge transfer and collection. The PBDB-T:NNBDT:FDNCTF-based ternary OSCs exhibited a high PCE of 12.8% with a JSC of 19.89 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.722.
Utilizing a BDT unit embedded in two strong electron-donating 2-ethylhexyl chains as the core and the IC as the end group, Liao and co-workers47 designed a novel FREA called BT-IC with a narrow Egopt of 1.43 eV. It has a strong absorption with the absorption edge extending to the NIR region. When blended with two different donors (J61 and J71), the device based on J61:BT-IC and J71:BT-IC showed PCEs of 9.6% and 10.5%, respectively, with extremely low energy loss (0.56 eV for J61 and 0.53 eV for J71). Interestingly, we can observe that the HOMO offset of the blend film, that is, the driving force, is only about 0.1 eV which is far less than the empirical value of 0.3 eV. However, in this case, we can still observe effective charge generation by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, implying that excitons can diffuse and dissociate when the driving force is less than 0.3 eV accompanied by a low Eloss. Therefore, reducing the energy level offset which thereby reduces Eloss results in high VOC and JSC simultaneously. Then, they modified BT-IC via introducing four chlorine atoms into IC to form BT-CIC.48 The introduction of chlorine atoms into end groups enhances the ICT effect, which narrowed Egopt (1.33 eV). Moreover, the intermolecular interactions of Cl⋯S and Cl⋯Cl result in ordered molecular stacks in the donor–acceptor blend films. Consequently, a PCE of up to 11.2% was found for OSCs made of PCE-10 and the BT-CIC with a JSC of 22.5 mA cm−2. Moreover, the EQE of PCE-10:BT–CIC-based device is 75% between 650 and 800 nm, which implies that it has the potential to be applied to semi-transparent OSCs. Later, by introducing two 2F-IC end groups and a thiophene hexyl chain into two fused-nine-ring cores with minor differences, Zhan et al.123 synthesized two isomeric electron acceptors, FNIC1 and FNIC2. Although there are only minor differences between the two isomers, FNIC2 has a red-shifted absorption peak at 794 nm (752 nm for FNIC1) and a higher crystallinity, which is beneficial to charge transfer and dissociation. Compared with PTB7-Th:FNIC1 (10.3% PCE), the device based on PTB7-Th:FNIC2 achieved a high PCE of 13.0% with a VOC of 0.741 V, a JSC of 23.93 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.734 and a μe of 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. When fabricated for semi-transparent OSCs, the PTB7-Th:FNIC2-based device obtained PCEs varying from 9.51% to 11.6% at different average visible transmittance values (AVT, 20.3–13.6%).
2.4 NDT-extended fused-ring core based FREAs
Replacement of the benzene in the BDT unit by a naphthalene ring gives rise to the donor unit NDT having a highly planar structure and a stronger electron-donating ability.124,125 In p-type organic semiconductors, the application of NDT makes it have stronger molecular packing and high charge carrier mobilities.62 For this reason, when NDT was used as an intermediate core for FREAs, the devices based on those FREAs still yielded an eye-catching performance. In 2017, by changing the benzene ring to the naphthalene ring on the basis of IDIC1 (Fig. 2), Zhan et al.126 designed and synthesized a novel electron acceptor, IHIC1. The introduction of a naphthalene ring enlarges the π-conjugation of the molecule, which makes it have upshifted energy levels (−5.47 eV, HOMO and −3.75 eV, LUMO) when compared with IDIC1 (−5.51 eV, HOMO and −3.81 eV, LUMO). Morphological studies showed that IHIC1 has enhanced π–π stacking, which is beneficial to the charge transport, thereby increasing electron mobility. The device based on FTAZ:IHIC1 obtained a PCE of 9.21% with a high VOC of 0.950 V, a JSC of 14.3 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.679 and a μe of 2.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. In order to further extend the conjugation of the fused rings, they127 continued to introduce pyrene into the intermediate cores replacing the end group with 2FIC that is more capable of pulling electrons, and an FREA named FPIC was synthesized. FPIC exhibits a medium Eg of 1.63 eV and a strong absorption between 450 and 700 nm. The introduction of pyrene enhances the rigidity of the intermediate core, resulting in the higher crystallinity of the FPIC. As a result, the blend film exhibited an ordered morphology when blended with PTB7-Th, leading to a balanced charge transport. The device based on PTB7-Th:FPIC achieved a PCE of 8.45% with a VOC of 0.755 V and a high FF of 0.731, but a moderate JSC of 15.3 mA cm−2. Since the spectral absorption ranges of PTB7-Th and FPIC almost overlap, a ternary component, F8IC (Fig. 5), is added in order to further extend the absorption. F8IC has a good absorption in the range of 700–1000 nm, and the ternary device based on PTB7-Th:FPIC:F8IC achieved a high PCE of 13.0% with a significant improvement in JSC of 26.3 mA cm−2. By fusing thiophene at both ends of the intermediate naphthalene core, Zhan et al.62 designed and synthesized an organic FREA named IOIC2 with hexyl chains attached to the naphthalene ring core and 2FIC end groups. The introduction of alkyl chains and 2FIC, coupled with the strong electron-donating ability of the NDT-based core, precisely adjusts the energy levels, leading to up-shifted energy levels but a narrow Egopt. Due to the non-covalent effect of F⋯S and F⋯H bonds caused by the 2FIC end group, IOIC2 achieved a high μe of 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is comparable to that of fullerene acceptors. The device based on FTAZ:IOIC2 achieved a PCE of 12.3% with a high VOC of 0.9 V and a JSC of 19.7 mA cm−2. Then, by replacing the hexyl substituents with hexyloxy, a FREA named IOIC3 has been designed with a smaller Egopt of 1.45 eV relative to that of IOIC2 (Egopt = 1.54 eV).128 The inserted hexyloxy electron-donating group enhanced the electron-donating ability of the entire intermediate core, prompting a red-shifted absorption. The device based on PTB7-Th:IOIC3 yielded the PCEs of 13.1% for OSCs and 10.8% for semi-transparent OSCs with an AVT of 16.4%. After that, two FREAs with long alkyl chains on the naphthalene but different end groups, NCIC and NCFIC, were synthesized.129 Compared with NCIC, NCFIC had a narrower Egopt of 1.51 eV (1.58 eV for NCIC) due to the introduction of 2F-IC, which showed that NCFIC has a stronger absorption. 2D-GIWAXS images showed that the binary blend films present π–π stacking signals in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions, indicating that the thin films possess both face-on and edge-on crystalline orientations. When choosing PBDB-T as the donor that has a complementary absorption with them, the devices based on PBDB-T:NCIC and PBDB-T:NCFIC achieved a moderate efficiency of 7.3% and 7.5%, respectively. For further strengthening the absorption, the third component PC71BM was added. As a result, the π–π stacking signal of the ternary blend in the out-of-plane direction becomes more pronounced, which is good for charge transfer. The PCEs of the devices based on PBDB-T:NCIC:PC71BM (1:1:1 in wt%) and PBDB-T:NCFIC:PC71BM (1:1:1.5 in wt%) were improved to 8.32% and 9.18%, respectively.
Enlarging the length of the π-conjugated chain of the central fused-ring core is a common means to extend the spectral absorption range and improve the intermolecular interaction.130,131 A FREA called IDCIC (Fig. 10) was developed by introducing TT units at both ends of the NDT core.50 The morphological study revealed that IDCIC has a strong aggregation in 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and excellent solubility in chloronaphthalene (CN). By adjusting the proportion of additive to 0.25% DIO in FTAZ:IDCIC mixture solution in CN, the blend films show hierarchical morphological features with a clear phase separation. The device based on FTAZ:IDCIC delivered a maximum PCE of 13.58% with a high JSC of 21.98 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.71 (Fig. 9c and d).

3. Guidelines for molecular design
By summarizing the FREAs aforementioned, it is worth noting that the photoelectric properties of the BHJ blends in the organic active layer have a great impact on the performance of OSCs. Hereinafter, some guidelines to further improve the performance of NF–OSCs will be discussed from the aspects of spectral absorption, fill factor, driving force and voltage loss. Meanwhile, several performance parameters closely related to the characteristics of FREAs will be analysed and the design strategies for future FREAs will also be described briefly.
3.1 Optical absorption
The absorption of the solar spectrum by the active layer directly determines the magnitude of the photocurrent. In order to maximize JSC, donor and acceptor materials with stronger light absorption have been developed. In binary NF–OSCs, the donor and acceptor materials that make up the active layer typically have complementary absorption but different maximum absorption peaks. In order to further extend the absorption range from the solar spectrum, in recent years, a new device strategy called ternary solar cells has been explored, where a third component is added to the binary BHJ blend, and excellent performance has been obtained with PCEs surpassing 10% for non-fullerene OSCs75,132–147 (Table 2). For FREAs, the current research direction is to extend their absorption to the near-infrared (NIR) region by narrowing their bandgaps, which can be realized via either extending the fused-ring core or introducing strong electron-withdrawing end groups. On one hand, the narrowing of the Egopt of FREAs leads to the absorption of FREAs extending to the visible range or even red-shifting to the NIR region.148 On the other hand, a considerable JSC and a high PCE are obtained with sacrificing the VOC of the device. In short, modifying the bandgaps of FREAs is currently the most common method to be adopted to make full use of sunlight. Finding appropriate donors to match with FREAs and to maximize JSC and VOC at the same time is another effective way. An excellent review has summarized the recent advancement and prospects of NFAs in ternary OSCs.149 Clearly, every breakthrough in high-efficiency OSCs has been triggered by the rapid development of FREAs and their versatile applications in single-junction (both binary and ternary) or tandem devices.

Generally, a NIR-absorbing FREA introduced into a D/NFA1 binary blend or paired with two donors D1/D2 can (i) improve the optical absorptivity across the abundant region of solar energy, (ii) realize efficient and fast charge separation with a small driving force, and (iii) reduce non-radiative VOC loss through rational materials combination, and/or (iv) improve the device performance and stability (Fig. 11).

When two FREAs were used, their excellent compatibility is a critical consideration for the new acceptor phase formation and morphology optimization. The selection of FREAs may be simplified by looking for similar molecular structures, which was demonstrated in two successful ternary systems with ITIC/IDIC141 and IT-M/IEICO142 as acceptors. In both cases, the good material compatibility led to the formation of a new acceptor alloy and much more continuous films. The aggregate formation was successfully inhibited to obtain high PCE values for ternary OSCs. Complementary absorption is not a must when selecting two compatible FREAs. Yan et al.150 developed high-efficiency ternary OSCs by blending a donor polymer, PM6, with two FREAs (namely ITCPTC and MeIC) featuring similar structures and absorptions. A synergistic effect of crystallinity and domain size/purity introduced by the two acceptors is observed. ITCPTC reduces the crystallinity of the acceptor phase, whereas changing the content of MeIC relative to that of ITCPTC can fine tune the relative domain purity and domain size, resulting in a controllable and favourable morphology. As a result, the optimal PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC (1:0.4:0.6) devices delivered an impressive PCE of 14.13% and FF of 0.782, which are the highest values reported for ternary OSCs reported to date. In addition, by blending a donor polymer, PBDB-T, with two FREAs (ITIC and ITIC-Th) of similar structures and absorptions, Zhan et al.151 fabricated a ternary system and a relatively high efficiency was achieved through adjusting the mass ratio of the two acceptors. In binary OSCs, PBDB-T crystalline packing is preserved when mixed with ITIC, while the π–π stacking of PBDB-T became tighter when mixed with ITIC-Th. Different from the π–π stacking behavior in binary OSCs, adding a third component makes the π–π stacking of all three phases tighter, which is most likely caused by the mutual end group π–π stacking of ITIC and ITIC-Th. As a result, long-range backbone ordering is promoted by the mutual molecular packing of ITIC and ITIC-Th, thereby facilitating the formation of continuous electron pathways in the film. The ternary device based on PBDB-T:ITIC:ITIC-Th obtained a PCE of 9.76% with a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 16.0 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.66, which is higher than the PCEs of the corresponding binary devices (8.71% for PBDB-T:ITIC and 6.76% for PBDB-T:ITIC-Th). Recently, Zhan et al.152 reported a new type of active layer with a ternary system called C-ternary. The C-ternary OPV was fabricated by a sequential solution process, in which the third component (second acceptor) and donor/acceptor binary blend are sequentially spin coated with orthogonal solvents. The PCE of devices fabricated with C-ternary can increase by 14–21% over traditional ternary OSCs.
Indeed, the third component was commonly selected based on its complementary absorption spectrum with the host system, aiming to increase the photon harvesting of the active layer. But this criterion may be not necessary for two compatible FREA systems.150 New selection criteria for an extra FREA as the third component should be explored for obtaining highly efficient ternary OSCs. Taking advantage of the high JSC (20.81 mA cm−2) of PBDB-T:INPIC-4F, and the high VOC (0.90 V) and FF (0.731) of PBDB-T:MeIC1, Zhang and Tang's group139 collaborated to develop high-efficiency ternary OSCs by inheriting all advantages from both binary OSCs (Fig. 12). A high PCE of 13.73% was realized with a JSC of 21.86 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.88 V and a FF of 0.714. A new materials screening strategy is thus proposed based on the complementary photovoltaic parameters of two binary PSCs, besides the complementary absorption spectrum of the used materials. This principle is also applicable even when we look back at the case of PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC, where the complementary absorption criterion didn't exist for these two FREAs having similar absorptions.150 But the complementary photovoltaic parameters of the two binary PSCs stand out, where a high JSC (18.47 mA cm−2) and VOC (0.993 V) were found for PM6:MeIC binary devices and a high FF (0.743) was found for PM6:ITCPTC binary ones. With the addition of ITCPTC as the third component into PM6:MeIC binary blends, the strong crystallinity of MeIC was suppressed with a decreased fibrillar texture observed in AFM images. The 40% ITCPTC blend exhibits a reduced diffraction signal at the π–π stacking position relative to the PM6:MeIC blend film, and a crystal coherence length (CCL) of 18.5 Å in the (010) direction falls in between the CCLs of the two binary blend films, suggesting that the crystalline content of the blend film was reduced after introducing ITCPTC into the acceptors. And the blend with 40% ITCPTC thus contributed the highest JSC (18.42 mA cm−2) and FF (0.782) among all ternary OSCs.

The PBDBT:INPIC-4F blend films exhibited a flocculent structure in the TEM images, while uniform and nanofibrous structure was observed in the TEM images for PBDB-T:MeIC1 blend films (Fig. 13). With the addition of MeIC1 into PBDBT:INPIC-4F blend, ternary blend films showed more and more clear nanofibrous structure along with the flocculent structure upon increasing the content of MeIC1 up to 50 wt%. The numerous nano-fibrillar structures observed from the TEM images indicate enhanced phase separation in the ternary blend films by incorporating more MeIC1.139

3.2 Fill factor
In recent years, many researchers have conducted extensive research into the effects of introducing groups on the JSC and VOC of devices. Related to the degree of recombination of electrons and holes, the FF as an important indicator for evaluating device performance has rarely been studied. Also, the recombination is the result of a combination of factors such as charge transport, the transmission distance, and the active layer thickness.153 At present, extending the fused-ring conjugated system to enhance the electron donating ability and adding a strong electron withdrawing group at both ends of the fused-ring core to promote electron delocalization are two main methods to accelerate charge transport, which means faster charge dissociation and lower charge density at the contact interface. However, a majority of FREA-based devices suffer from the problem of low carrier mobility, which may be caused by the electron transport distance being too long to be crossed. Then, bridged conjugated moieties are inserted between the D unit and the A unit, which can reduce the recombination probability of electrons and holes in the transmission process, thereby improving the μe (10−4 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). In a fullerene system, high electron mobility can be obtained even in a thick organic active layer. In contrast, a device based on a non-fullerene small molecule can obtain a FF of more than 0.7 in an active layer of about 100 nm in thickness, but the FF is significantly reduced accompanied by the increasing thickness of the active layer. Fortunately, Yang et al. reported a FREA called IDTPC recently, which maintains a high performance with a PCE of 10% and a FF of over 0.6 even when the thickness of the active layer reaches 400 nm (Fig. 14).154 In summary, increasing the charge transfer rate and inhibiting its recombination are key to the preparation of high-efficiency OSCs. In addition, how to increase the electron mobility while increasing the thickness of the organic layer is also a problem we will consider in the future.

Besides the mobility and film thickness, the FF, as a more sensitive parameter than VOC and JSC,155 depends strongly on the morphology of both the D/A blends and the interface between the cathode and active layer.156 The morphology formation and purity of mixed domains of polymer donors and NFAs are known to be governed by molecular interactions, which thus largely determine the achievable device performance of OSCs. Quantifying interaction–function relationships were first demonstrated by Ade and his coworkers,157 from which they can determine the generalized Flory–Huggins χaa(Tm) and χaa(T) that reflect amorphous–amorphous interactions for a wide range of OSC systems. A constant-kink-saturation characteristic model that relates χaa to the square root of the integrated scattering intensity (ISI1/2) and FF has been established on the basis of representative polymer:fullerene and non-fullerene systems.157 In their recent study on PBDB-TF:IT-4F, they demonstrated an approach to determine the quench depth of high-efficiency OSCs and delineate the need to kinetically quench the mixed domains to a composition close to the percolation threshold.158 The ability to achieve such a quench is found to be very sensitive to the structural parameters of OSCs of the polymer PBDB-TF. Only the highest-molecular-weight polymer is capable of earlier liquid–solid transition to ‘‘lock in’’ a highly performing OSC morphology with a composition above the miscibility limit and with a PCE of over 13%.158
3.3 Driving force and voltage loss
It is well-known that energy loss (Eloss = Eg − eVOC) is ubiquitous in polymer organic solar cells and is currently one of the bottlenecks towards making OSCs compete with inorganic solar cells. As the PCE is specified as the product of JSC, FF and VOC divided by the incoming light intensity under standard AM 1.5G illumination conditions, OSCs can well compete with their inorganic counterparts in terms of JSC and FF (with a minor trade-off) but suffer from lower VOC at a given Eg of the light-absorbing material.51 The so-called bandgap-voltage offset Eloss can be lowered down to 0.3–0.4 eV in Si and GaAs,159 and slightly larger in perovskite cells. Eloss values of at least 0.60 eV are observed in most fullerene-based and many non-fullerene based OSCs. Actually, this offset can approach or even exceed 1 eV.160 A plot is shown in Fig. 15 to depict the maximum PCEs versus the estimated Eloss of OSCs based on FREAs bearing IDT and IDTT cores, as well as those cores extended by TT, BDT and NDT as above discussed. Most of the FREA based OSCs exhibited an Eloss lower than 0.8 eV, and all OSCs with a PCE over 10% possessed an Eloss less than 0.7 eV. And the lowest Eloss ∼ 0.50 eV has been observed for FREAs.
 Fig. 15  Plot of maximum PCEs against the estimated Eloss values of OSCs based on typical FREAs having IDT, IDTT, or their TT, BDT and NDT extended fused-ring cores. Source references for the data correspond to the molecules given in Table 1. 
Research studies show that excitons have a state before they dissociate into carriers, called the charge transfer state (CTS), closely related to the Eloss, the energy offset (ΔEL and Eg − ECT) which is the driving force for photoinduced charge separation. Usually, it is considered that effective dissociation of excitons can only be guaranteed when ΔEL is greater than or equal to 0.3 eV,17 and the Eloss in OSCs is at least 0.6 eV (ref. 161) which is positively correlated to the driving force. However, many fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells with a driving force far less than 0.3 eV and an Eloss of less than 0.6 eV have appeared, such as J71:ITIC (0.11 eV/HOMO offset), P3TEA:SF-PDI2 (0.05 eV/LUMO offset)59 and PBDB-T:INPIC-4F (0.5 eV/Eloss).78 In Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theory,162 the SQ limit is a way to define an ideal solar cell. According to SQ theory, it is not difficult to understand that solar cells must emit light when they absorb light, implying that radiative recombination is inevitable. The additional Eloss comes from the difference between VOC,SQ and VOC,rad (where VOC,SQ is defined as the VOC of the ideal solar cell in SQ theory, and VOC,rad is the VOC that is achieved through the step function absorption rate of the SQ limit replaced by the actual absorption rate of the solar cell material) as a result of further red-shifting of the emission relative to the absorption edge.163 Compared with inorganic solar cells, this type of voltage loss in OSCs is relatively large because the offset at the hetero-junction makes the charge transfer state much lower than the onset of strong absorption. In summary, in order to achieve a higher device efficiency, we can try to synthesize new materials or find donors and acceptors with more similar and matching energy levels to reduce the driving force and preferably reduce the loss of radiative recombination during absorption.
4. Summary and outlook
Undoubtedly, the innovation of FREAs has triggered the rapid growth of device performance of OSCs, which also gives us great confidence to input more research efforts on FREA-based OSCs towards their promising future as an alternative to the existing inorganic solar cells in service. In this review, a library of high-efficiency FREAs has been overviewed along the lines of three molecular engineering strategies of central fused-ring cores. The impact of core engineering on the resultant FREAs in terms of optoelectronic structure, molecular ordering, the morphology of their blends with polymer donors, and photovoltaic performance is elaborated, with representative FREAs discussed in detail. Based on the correlation study of FREAs' structure and their device performance, we believe that appropriate extension of the fused-ring nucleus can strengthen the light absorption, manipulate molecular ordering, improve charge transfer and collection in BHJ blends with donors, and reduce Eloss by matching with appropriate light-harvesting systems. The versatility of FREAs in structural modification to fine tune absorption, energy levels and self-aggregation provides wide options to rationally design and construct different types of devices. By matching with appropriate donors, FREAs have opened a new avenue for solution-processed (ca. doctor-blading LbL or roll-to-roll printing) high-efficiency OSCs, especially for thick active layers and transparent devices.
Beginning with the synthesis of ITIC and the obtained high efficiency in 2015, almost all of the FREAs that emerged later adopted the A–D–A structure. Due to the application of the fused-ring and push–pull electronic structure, the photovoltaic efficiency of the device based on FREAs exceeds the highest record of fullerene-based OSCs within recent few years. However, with the in-depth molecular engineering of the A–D–A structure including the sidechains, end groups, fused-ring cores and even bridging units, we can clearly feel that the rate of further pushing the OSC efficiency has begun to slow down, which may be attributed to unclear limitations of the A–D–A structure. Therefore, designing new molecular structures may be an effective way to improve the performance of OSCs. Apart from the structure, some other issues also need to be considered. It is well known that the method for synthesis of a vast majority of FREAs has many disadvantages such as low yields, complex processes of the synthetic route and harsh reaction conditions, which implies that reducing the difficulty of synthesis or simplifying the design of small molecules is the trend of future. In addition, even if we already have a large-scale production process for solar cells, the cost of synthetic materials is still very high, which may counter to the commercialization of OSCs. Therefore, while improving the efficiency of OSCs, the cost also needs to be taken into consideration. Nowadays, the donor and acceptor materials used to prepare the active layer of OSCs basically have the problem of poor stability,38,164–168 and their device efficiency will greatly decrease after they work several hours. Therefore, stability is also an urgent problem in the research of OSCs which needs to be addressed. We believe that the era of rapid advancement in OSCs can come again with combinational efforts from materials chemists, device physicists and processing engineers.
