    , Accepted 28th September 2019First published on 13th November 2019AbstractRecently, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has stimulated significant research interest as a promising electrode candidate in solar cells and energy conservation fields. Unfortunately, the short lower electron/hole migration lifetimes and easy agglomeration hamper its wide practical applications to some extent. Herein, interface engineering coupled with a bio-assisted photoelectrochemical (PEC) strategy is presented to construct a 0D MoS2 quantum dot (QD)/1D TiO2 nanotube electrode for pollutant elimination. Aimed at accelerating charge transfer over the 0D/1D composite interface, three types of coupling PEC models were developed to optimize the catalytic performance. The single chamber microbial fuel cell (SCMFC)-PEC integrated system was found to be the best alternative for levofloxacin (LEV) elimination (0.029 min−1), and the sequential SCMFC-PEC further realized the whole system self-running independently. In addition, the interfacial electron migration and LEV degradation pathways were thoroughly investigated by LC/TOF/MS coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to clearly elucidate the electron transfer paths, LEV-attacked sites and mineralization pathways in a joint sequential SCMFC-PEC system. As such, the constructed self-recycling system provides a new platform for bio-photo-electrochemical utilization, which could exhibit promising potential in environmental purification.
1. Introduction
Environmental pollution and energy shortages comprise two of the major hurdles that largely limit the rapid advancement and development of human society.1–4 To assist in addressing these growing urgent issues, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) technique5 has been regarded as one of the promising strategies to manage the aforementioned scientific issues. Because of the increasing development of graphene-like structures in recent decades, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a commonly used industrial catalyst for petroleum hydrodesulfurization,6 is being considered as a promising material in the areas of catalysis, energy storage and conversion due to its unique physicochemical characteristics,7–10 particularly for quasi zero-dimensional (0D) MoS2 quantum dots (QDs). Compared with the traditional two-dimensional MoS2 nanosheets, MoS2 QDs possess a larger number of exposed edge sites and stronger quantum confinement effects,11 making them exhibit unique semiconductor behaviors and dramatic electrical/optical properties, which might enhance sunlight-current conversion in coupling nanomaterials.12 However, it remains limited by several challenges to practical application such as the tendency for aggregation,13 which results in the blockage of active sites; therefore, it is necessary to find a suitable substrate to hold MoS2 materials.
TiO2-based photo-functional electrodes, particularly anatase TiO2, have significant potential for use in water splitting,14 solar energy cells,15 artificial photosynthesis,16 sensor devices,17 and environmental remediation applications18 owing to their highly active facets19 and an excellent high aspect ratio electron transport pathway, which enhance the sunlight conversion and removal of contaminants. Notably, a rapid electron transfer path and a reliable, stable TiO2 host substrate are essential for the MoS2 catalyst, in which TiO2 may overcome the constraints of MoS2 QDs by providing robust charge transfer routes. Conversely, MoS2 QDs might rectify the insufficient brief separation lifetimes of TiO2 photo-generated electron–hole pairs.20 Although many strategies have been developed to boost the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons/holes, the electric-field driven route is still the primary representative method. In the photoelectrochemical process, an external bias needs to be proposed as a crucial strategy to force the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes over the interfacial the standing electrode, which could effectively extend the lifetime of holes and electrons. The traditional external bias is still dependent on a power supply unit or a potentiostat.21–24 For instance, previous studies have demonstrated a modified TiO2 film that exhibited excellent PEC performance under 0.6 V bias provided by an electrochemical workstation.25–28 Despite its versatility, this process would face potential energy consumption and catalytic efficiency drawbacks. Other self-bias modes, such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with self-generated electricity would provide a powerful micro-electric field.29,30
MFC has widely emerged as a particularly promising bioelectrochemical technology that combines the merits of spontaneous electricity generation with efficient pollutant metabolism.31,32 The self-generated electricity from wastewater could directly provide a bias for the PEC system33 and might be a promising bias candidate for addressing the aforementioned issues. Previously, Yu et al. indicated that a tunable MFC-based bias was an effective approach to accelerate the PEC or microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) performance for p-nitrophenol elimination34 and hydrogen evolution,35 respectively. Also, Qian et al. developed a solar-driven microbial photoelectrochemical cell (solar MPC) that combined with the bioanode (p-Cu2O nanowire) to produce sustainable energy using solar energy.36 Recently, Liu et al. ingeniously embedded the anode of the PEC into the MFC reactor to construct a hybrid PMFC system, improving the power density of MFC.37 Also, by relying on a junction potential to strengthen the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs, You et al. discovered that integrating the desalination module into PEC improved the degradation performance of rhodamine B.38 More interestingly, Chen et al. reported that the sequential pre-photocatalytic–biodegradation coupling system exhibited improved toluene removal efficiency in contrast to that of bio-treatment prior to photocatalysis.39 Based on these analyses, the development of a self-recycling system for accelerating pollutant removal was undertaken.
Notably, MFC possesses a tailored voltage, improved control over electron transfer routes, and it could also be easily applied to provide a fixed voltage for electrochemical characterization. Unfortunately, all the PEC systems have the common drawback of the degradation rate being gradually weakened with the extension of time, which largely reduces the efficiency and limits practical wastewater treatment. The degradation intermediates of these contaminants in the PEC system could be further used as carbon sources for the growth of microbes in the MFC reactor. The coupled system would, therefore, achieve effective dually enhanced pollutant removal and realize high-efficiency for wastewater treatment. To the best of our knowledge, little attention has been focused on this, and it could serve as a better hybrid system for the dual functions of the removal of target pollutants and energy generation; therefore, there is an urgent need for the further enhancement of these joint systems for wastewater treatment.
Herein, we report the construction of a multi-modeling SCMFC-PEC coupling system for the simultaneous degradation of antibiotics and green energy production in situ. In this work, quasi-zero-dimensional MoS2 QDs were employed as the visible-light-driven inducer, whereas the target pollutant levofloxacin (LEV) served as the electron acceptor or donor. Various on-line and/or off-line characterization techniques were intensively used to elucidate and investigate the photoinduced redox behavior, as well as the interfacial charge transferability of the 0D–1D nanomaterials. In order to construct a multi-model joint system for better degradation of pollutants, porous FePO4 nanoparticles served as the cathode catalyst of the SCMFC, and the residual intermediates from the PEC reactor served as the secondary wastewater for the SCMFC, which not only transferred the power for the PEC but also self-provided electrons for the thorough mineralization of pollutants. The SCMFC was subsequently investigated through comparisons with the functions of the other two modes. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with synchronous MFC energy supplying techniques were employed to elucidate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the process of coupling degradations. Finally, liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry, coupled with density functional theory computation (DFT), was applied to explore the degradation paths of LEV and the intermediates derived from the coupled catalytic process over the SCMFC-PEC hybrid system.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of MoS2 QDs functional TiO2 NTAs
In order to prepare MoS2 quantum dots (QDs), a modified probe sonication method was used to break the force of the bulk MoS2.13 TiO2 NTAs was prepared by the one-step anodization method according to our former work.25 The detailed experimental steps are presented in the ESI.† In order to address the visible light response performance of the TiO2 electrode, MoS2 QDs were applied to decorate the TiO2 NTAs by electrostatic attractive interaction (presented in Scheme 1). The obtained TiO2 NTAs electrode (2 cm × 2 cm) was immersed in a 3 mM HCl solution under sonication for 15 min and then rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, respectively. The MoS2 QDs that decorated the surface of TiO2 were further modified with APTMS before drying with a stream of nitrogen. The electrode was introduced into an ethanol solution of 2% (v/v) APTMS under sonication for another 15 min, after which the same rinsing and drying steps were performed. Finally, the APTMS-TiO2 NTAs electrode was immersed in a MoS2 QDs solution and stirred for 6 h, and then the above rinsing and drying steps were repeated. The obtained electrode was further dried at 80 °C for 10 h in a vacuum oven. This self-assembly strategy aimed to extensively utilize highly ordered 1 D nanotubes, which would create diverse catalytic MoS2 edge sites.

2.2 SCMFC-PEC joint system construction
An FePO4 NPs-based air-cathode SCMFC (15 mL) was constructed according to our previous work,40 which was used to provide the power for the PEC (100 mL) system. In this coupled SCMFC-PEC system, a 10 Ω external resistor was used to link the cathode of the MFC and the PEC anode. The anode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) of SCMFC were also connected to the cathode and SCE of PEC, respectively. In the previous optimization experiments, 3 mM acetate was used as the early carbon source for electricity output in the MFC. The intermediates of the PEC degradation were provided as the substrate of the MFC reactor for energy generation. Further, in terms of the photoelectrocatalytic activity, the fixed voltage (0.60 V, through the variable resistance box adjustment in the circuit) coming from the SCMFC was utilized to provide the potential for electrochemical characterization, integrated with an electrochemical station (CHI 760C) without providing the bias in the experiment.
2.3 Evaluation of the SCMFC-PEC activity
The PEC degradation of LEV (anhydrous, >98.0% (HPLC), TCI) was conducted under visible light illumination using MoS2 QD/TiO2 NTAs as an efficient photoanode. The performance of the PEC degradation was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 30 min intervals under simulated visible light illumination. The rate of degradation was observed in terms of the change in intensity at λmax = 286 nm. It was also observed that new peaks arose during the irradiation time. This may be attributed to the formation of different intermediates during the degradation process, which further diminished with irradiation time. Meanwhile, the intermediates were further analyzed by liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF/MS). All the samples were separated on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 mm, 2.1 mm × 50 mm) at 40 °C. The injection volume was 5 μL. The mobile phases consisting of ultrapure water containing 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) were used with gradient elution. The flow rate was maintained at 0.3 mL min−1.
To ensure that the FePO4-based SCMFC was running properly, the SCMFC was incubated in a mixture of low concentrations of LEV pollutant and sodium acetate (3 mM) for several cycles in the form of the gradient concentration, then altered to higher concentrations (8 mM), in order to stabilize the voltage output signal. Once the PEC was running for one hour, the 10 mL effluent of the PEC reactor was fed to the SCMFC, to achieve dual-degradation of LEV. The performance of the SCMFC was evaluated by pollutant degradation and power generation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and optical properties of MoS2 QDs/TiO2 NTAs
A highly dispersed MoS2 QDs solution was prepared, as depicted in Fig. S1;† the size was about 7–10 nm as determined via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and the as-prepared MoS2 QDs displayed more trap states (Fig. S2†). To investigate the distribution of MoS2 QDs on the TiO2 NTs electrode, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to determine the effects of the electrostatic functionalization. As shown in Fig. 1, compared with pure TiO2 NTs (Fig. S3†), MoS2 QDs presented good distribution on the inner pore, as well as the edges and walls of TiO2 nanotubes in the different regions (as showed in Fig. 1a and b). Also, energy-dispersive X-ray mapping (EDX) was carried out to determine the elemental composition and the corresponding contents in Fig. S4.† It was confirmed that the as-prepared electrode contained C, Ti, O, Mo and S, and the atomic percentages of each element are listed in the inset of Fig. S4(a)† along with the corresponding EDX mapping (Fig. S4(b)–(e)†), which indicate that the MoS2 QDs were successfully electrostatically adsorbed onto TiO2 NTs by (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS) functionalization. Fig. S5(a)† shows the HRTEM image of the selected area, where the crossed lattice spaces of 0.254, 0.351 nm are ascribed to the (102), (100) planes of MoS2 and anatase TiO2, respectively, which is in agreement with to the results in Fig. S1† and explains the formation of MoS2 QD/TiO2 heterojunctions.

The crystal phases of the obtained samples were further investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). There was no obvious peak for the MoS2 QDs (Fig. S5(b)†), which might be ascribed to the out of the interlayer stacking.41 The detailed chemical composition of the surface of the sample was further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the full scan XPS (Fig. S6†), the elements O, Ti, Mo, S and C, Si were derived from the composite electrode and APTMS, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 2, the binding energies of 458.58 and 464.43 eV were ascribed to Ti4+ 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively. The two typical peaks of O 1s were located at 529.88 and 532.08 eV (ref. 42) whereas, for the MoS2 QDs, the two characteristic peaks at 232.18 and 234.93 eV correspond to Mo4+ 3d3/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2, which suggests that MoS2 was partially oxidized and exposed more active sites.43 S2− 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbitals were observed at 163.03 and 161.68 eV, respectively. All the above results clearly indicated that the APTMS may effectively connect the MoS2 to the TiO2 to form intimate heterojunctions, which might accelerate electron transfer to the TiO2.

The lifetimes of photo-induced electron–hole pairs play a vital role in photocatalytic efficiency. The capacity for charge separation and recombination was evidenced by the PL spectrum. As shown in Fig. 3(a), TiO2 and MoS2 QDs/TiO2 electrodes displayed substantially similar PL signals curves, which might be ascribed to the low MoS2 QD concentration over TiO2 NTs. The TiO2 (anatase) sample exhibited three intrinsic PL peaks:44 self-trapped excitation, F (oxygen vacancies), F+ (surface states) centers, corresponding to 380–420 nm, 440–480 nm, and 510–580 nm, respectively. Only in the range of 440–480 nm, did the peak shift to longer wavelengths (a redshift); this was attributed to the quantum confinement effects of MoS2 QDs on the indirect bandgap,45 which trapped the oxygen vacancies on the walls of the TiO2 nanotubes. Further, the PL signal intensities of MoS2/TiO2 were lower than that of TiO2, indicating a lower rate of electron–hole pair recombination with the coating of MoS2 QDs.

The dynamic properties of photoinduced charge carriers in the composite electrodes were investigated by the transient photovoltage (TPV) technique. In Fig. 3(b), the TPV responses of TiO2 and MoS2/TiO2 electrodes presented positive photovoltage (PV) transient signals, implying that the electric potentials of these electrodes were more positive than that of the ITO electrode (the back electrode).46 Compared with the pure TiO2 NTs electrode, it could be clearly seen that the MoS2/TiO2 electrode had a more positive PV signal in a short time, which was mainly attributed to the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs of the MoS2 QDs. When photoinduced charges were transferred to TiO2 NTs, they were easily delayed by the formation of a heterojunction over the QD/NT interface.47 Additionally, it also demonstrated that the maximum of the PV signal was delayed to the ∼ms range, which verified the MoS2 QDs improvement of the interfacial electrons/holes separation.
To directly analyze the vacancies of the MoS2/TiO2 heterostructure, low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) was applied to observe the intrinsic types of defects that were generated following MoS2 QDs decoration. In Fig. 4, for the MoS2/TiO2 electrode, the predominant signals were strongly displayed at the g-values = 1.9993, 2.0002 and 2.0014, of which the first contributed to Ti3+ ion paramagnetic species due to trapped electrons,48 while the remaining two signals were ascribed to the localized oxygen vacancies originating from the lattice oxygen trapping the photo-generated holes.49 With respect to the TiO2 sample, it is possible that the MoS2 QDs could more easily promote TiO2 to expose Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies. Hence, the coupling 0D/1D material would act to boost the PEC reaction.

From the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of electrodes (Fig. S7†), the sunlight absorption band edges for TiO2 and MoS2/TiO2 were ∼390 nm and 428 nm, respectively. Also, the bandgap of pure MoS2 QDs was ∼1.78 eV, which proved that the MoS2 QDs were photocatalytically active, and enhanced the absorption intensity in the sunlight region for the as-prepared MoS2/TiO2 electrode. In order to understand the origin of the photoactive enhancement of the MoS2 QD/TiO2 composites toward the PEC degradation of the target pollutants in contrast to that of bare TiO2, we put forward potential explanations derived from theoretical and experimental analyses. In the MoS2–TiO2 integrated system, the band edge positions of the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB) of the MoS2 and TiO2 were calculated by the following empirical formulas:50EVB = X − Ee + 0.5EgECB = EVB − Egwhere X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor. The X values of MoS2 and TiO2 were calculated to be 5.3351 and 5.9 eV, respectively. Ee is the energy of the free electrons on the hydrogen scale (ca. 4.5 eV), and Eg is the bandgap energy. The band gaps of MoS2 and TiO2 were calculated to be 1.78 and 3.18 eV, respectively, which were derived from Fig. S6.† Thus, the EVB values of MoS2 and TiO2 were calculated to be 1.72 and 2.99 eV, respectively. Accordingly, the corresponding ECB values were computed to be −0.06 and −0.19 eV, respectively. Thus, under visible light irradiation, MoS2 QDs played the role of a photosensitizer, which was photoexcited to generate electron–hole pairs, followed by electron transfer to the TiO2 nanotubes catalyst, which functioned as the electron separated antenna. Finally, through these antennas, the holes and electrons could selectively attack the adsorbed LEV molecule.
3.2 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity analysis
Due to the as-prepared MoS2/TiO2 possessing excellent photocatalytic performance, the separation of photo-excited electron–hole pairs could be intuitively recognized by PEC experiments. As shown in Fig. 5, the transient photocurrent densities of the TiO2 and MoS2/TiO2 hybrid electrodes were recorded at 30 s intervals by on–off cycles under visible light irradiation (Fig. 5(a)). Compared with the bulk TiO2 electrode, the hybrid electrode presented a much higher photocurrent density, indicating that MoS2 QDs effectively promoted the rapid separation of the composite material interface. Under visible light excitation, the photoelectrons were generated on the conductive band of MoS2 QDs, which subsequently transited the TiO2 NTs to the external circuit forming the current.

The dark condition involves the MoS2/TiO2 sample. 
The ability of the reactive interfacial intermediates generated at the MoS2/TiO2 photo-anode was further elucidated by investigating the photocurrent density vs. the variable potential (J–V). As shown in Fig. 5(b), under constant changes in potential, the J–V curves had an obviously sharp slope, a concave shape, and then attained the approximately saturated current density, indicating that the electrode surface electrons/holes were quickly separated. However, the current density of the MoS2/TiO2 electrode showed significant improvement. Additionally, its maximum current density was 0.075 mA cm−2 higher than that of TiO2 (0.016 mA cm−2). According to the J–V data, the maximum photocurrent conversion efficiency at 0.05 V bias potential vs. SCE was 0.35% (Fig. 5(c)), which was 9.15 times higher than that of the TiO2 sample. This result indicated that the MoS2 QDs did play a key role in the electrochemical function of the as-prepared composite electrode.
Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used to understand the charge transfer effect on the electrode interface. Fig. 5(d) shows that the radius of the Nyquist of MoS2/TiO2 was much smaller than that of TiO2, implying that the MoS2/TiO2 had a low resistance over the interfacial reaction of the electrode, and also accelerated the charge transfer process. Based on the above electrochemical results, the introduction of MoS2 QDs into the TiO2 electrode might enhance the mass transfer efficiency and the separation of electrons/holes, thereby exhibiting excellent PEC activity for the degradation of LEV.
3.3 Degradation of LEV in SCMFC-PEC
To investigate the LEV degradation performance of SCMFC-PEC by the MoS2 QDs/TiO2 electrode, three modes were designed for comparison in this experiment (Fig. 6). For the first mode, named I-SCMFC-PEC, SCMFC provided the bias for PEC, while the other two systems independently degraded LEV. The second mode involved the electrochemical workstation-PEC (EW-PEC), and the last mode, SCMFC-PEC with the sequential degradation (SCMFC not only gave the bias but also involved in the post-stage degradation), was called S-SCMFC-PEC. During the SCMFC-PEC mode, the LEV degradation rate was obviously improved as compared with other single treatment methods.34 In Fig. 7, the degradation rate (KLEV) of LEV was: I-SCMFC-PEC (MoS2/TiO2) > EW-PEC (MoS2/TiO2) > I-SCMFC-PEC (TiO2). In the I-SCMFC-PEC system, the LEV could be completely removed in 180 min (Fig. 7(a)), which was further verified by LC/TOF/MS analysis. Compared to the TiO2 electrode (Fig. 7(b)), the composite enhanced the degradability of LEV owing to the excellent light-response and quantum confinement effects of the MoS2 QDs. To further elaborate the superiority of this coupling system, it demonstrated the highest removal rate (2.9 × 10−2 min−1) as compared to those of modes (Fig. 7(c and d)). This constructed system contributed to the more efficient removal of LEV as compared to that of EW-PEC. It indicated that SCMFC could effectively promote the separation of electron–hole pairs, which could replace the function of the traditional external bias since SCMFC enabled the synergistic photoelectrocatalytic degradation of pollutants.

(b) Comparison of the TiO2 and MoS2/TiO2 electrodes for the degradation of LEV in this hybrid system under visible light irradiation. (c–d) Variations of Ct/C0 and −ln(Ct/C0) of LEV by different processing routes, where C0 (mg L−1) and Ct (mg L−1) are the initial LEV concentration and LEV concentration at time t (EC: electrocatalysis, P: pure photolysis, PC: photocatalysis; PEC: workstation provides a bias). 
Under the target pollutant optimization conditions, in Fig. S8(a),† the electricity generation of SCMFC reached excellent stability and a high output voltage. Following a 2 h open circuit, the open-circuit voltage (OCV) achieved 0.575 V, which was extremely close to the 0.6 V that was provided by the electrochemical workstation. Due to the resistance that existed in the PEC system, it caused the starting output voltage to be less than the value of the OCV. After the simulated sunlight illumination, a photocurrent was generated, which resulted in a decrease in the output voltage of the MFC.34 In Fig. S8(b),† with the degradation of LEV, the intermediates were complex and changeable in the SCMFC system, which led to the instability of the output voltage. While the pollutants were rapidly degraded in the SCMFC or PEC reactor, the output voltage of the SCMFC would be gradually increased, resulting in the improvement of the input voltage of the PEC cell because of its weakened conductivity. Meanwhile, the SCMFC also showed good performance for LEV degradation (Fig. S8(c)†), which could be used to co-enhance pollutant removal. The introduction of photocatalytic technologies effectively enhanced the electron-receiving capacity of the SCMFC cathode, such that the anode could provide more electrons to the utmost extent. In turn, this SCMFC enhanced the PEC performance for pollutant degradation. These results fully indicated that the I-SCMFC-PEC possessed the ability to dually-degrade LEV and presented an excellent synergistic effect, which promoted the rapid degradation of the target pollutant in a low energy consumption situation.
Compared with EC-PEC, there was an obvious increase in LEV degradation during the 60 min run time in the I-SCMFC-PEC coupling system. subsequently, there was a similar trend for the I-SCMFC-PEC and EC-PEC conditions where the LEV degradation rate was weakened, which is a common deficiency in the PEC degradation of pollutants due to the generation of refractory intermediates and the poor conductivity of the system.18,25 Based on these, a novel S-SCMFC-PEC system was initially reported to improve the pollutant degradation rate and the sequential co-degradation of LEV in an SCMFC-PEC was constructed. In Fig. 8, two stages were designed to enhance the LEV removal rate. During the initial 60 min stage, the pollutant was degraded in a PEC reactor with a 3.1 × 10−2 min−1 removal rate. Subsequently, the effluent from the PEC reactor was transferred to the SCMFC for further removal in the next stage (4.1 × 10−2 min−1). This suggested that the additional LEV was degraded in S-SCMFC-PEC within 85 min as compared to that of I-SCMFC-PEC in 180 min, which remarkedly improved the LEV removal rate (average 3.6 × 10−2 min−1) as compared with those of EW-PEC, I-SCMFC-PEC, and SCMFC. After five repeated experiments (Fig. S9†), the constructed S-SCMFC-PEC system showed good steady performance for antibiotic elimination. Therefore, this self-driven sequential coupled system could offer a new and effective strategy to treat wastewater through the self-recycling mode.

Error bars refer to the standard deviation among the three replicates. 
3.4 LEV mineralization intermediates and degradation pathways
The LEV degradation products were characterized in-depth by LC-TOF-MS analysis. The primary degradation intermediates of LEV under the SCMFC-PEC treatment are shown in the ESI (Fig. S10†). To better understand the LEV frontier orbital energy levels, the LUMO and HOMO of LEV-H+ ions are illustrated in Fig. S11.† The LUMO was mainly distributed in the center of the positive charge, and the HOMO covered the piperazine ring and F−, which confirmed that the ROS groups and holes primarily attacked sites of the piperazine ring, F− and the center of the positive charge. Combined with experimental degradation fragments, the target molecule degradation events were as follows: (i) the piperazine ring-opening (L1 → L2),52 amine oxidation, decarboxylation (L2 → L7) and demethylation (LEV → L1, L3 → L7 and L7 → L8); (ii) defluorination (LEV → L4) and then oxidation (Fig. 9) were consistent with DFT results and the subsequent active species analysis. All the products could be further oxidized into small organic acid molecules. Finally, complete mineralization occurred. This hypothesis suggests that oxidation and reduction occurred simultaneously in this coupling SCMFC-PEC system, hence, two possible LEV degradation pathways were proposed (Fig. S12†).

3.5 Investigation of the active species in the SCMFC-PEC system and the proposed degradation mechanism
To obtain a clearer elucidation of the SCMFC-PEC degradation mechanism, several control experiments were undertaken for the in situ capture of the active species. In Fig. 10(a), with EDTA as the hole scavenger, the SCMFC-PEC degradation of LEV was significantly retarded by 85.1%, which indicated that the holes played a critical role in the process of LEV oxidation. Meanwhile, during this reaction (Fig. S13†), a small amount of H2O2 (5.33 mg L−1 in 180 min) was also detected by a titanium oxalate method,53 which was derived from the oxygen that was reduced through a 2e− reaction pathway. When tRuOH (˙OH radical quencher) was added to this system, the removal of LEV was reduced by 25.6%, implying that the ˙OH radical was a minor active species in the oxidation of the LEV molecule. To further investigate whether the O2˙− radical existed or not, N2 was employed as the ambient gas involved with LEV degradation. It was found that the O2˙− radical (reduced by 17.4%) was also an active species in the degradation of LEV. These results obviously confirmed that holes and radicals were the primary active species in this system; both ˙OH and O2˙− radicals were simultaneously involved.

(b–d) EPR spectra of radical adducts trapped by DMPO-OH in MoS2 QD and MoS2 QDs/TiO2 electrodes, DMPO-O2 for this composite sample. (e–f) Fluorescence spectral response observed during illumination (e: sunlight, f: visible light) of the MoS2/TiO2 electrode in a 4 × 10−4 M NaOH solution of terephthalic acid (excitation at 315 nm). 
To fully confirm the above results, EPR and fluorescent probe techniques were applied to directly detect these ROS groups. In Fig. 10(b–d), the characteristic signals of ˙OH and O2˙− radicals were captured by DMPO-˙OH and DMPO-O2˙−, respectively. Also, ˙OH signals were found in the aqueous MoS2 QDs solution. Therefore, both ˙OH and O2˙− radicals were produced on the MoS2/TiO2 electrode and participated in the LEV degradation process. In order to further study the ˙OH radical in the PEC degradation of LEV, terephthalic acid was used as the probe to study ˙OH radical generation.54 In Fig. 10(e and f), a clear improvement in the PL intensity at 420–430 nm for the MoS2/TiO2 sample under simulated sunlight or visible light illumination, suggested that the ˙OH radical was produced at the interface of the composite.
Based on the above ROS experiments and DFT results, a possible LEV degradation mechanism was proposed in Fig. 11. Under visible light irradiation, electrons generated by the MoS2 QDs were transferred to the conductive band (CB) of the TiO2, which was initially driven by SCMFC, and then migrated to reduce the absorbed LEV molecule via defluorination (H2O2, O2˙−, and electrons). During this process, MoS2 served as an electron reservoir, whereas the TiO2 NTs served as the charge-transfer bridge, which effectively suppressed electron–hole pair recombination and improved the catalytic performance. The remaining holes might play the most important role in the oxidation of LEV, which could generate strong oxidation (˙OH radical) for the mineralization of LEV. All the active species could oxidize or reduce LEV to CO2, H2O, and other intermediates.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a dimensional synergistic 0D–1D MoS2/TiO2 structure was successfully prepared via an electrostatic interaction method, which strikingly exhibited interfacial charge transfer and excellent catalytic performance for LEV elimination under visible light irradiation, particularly in a sequential SCMFC-PEC coupled system. This developed heterojunction exposed more active sites (Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy), a suitable bandgap (2.9 eV), and excellent electrochemical activity (∼0.35% photocurrent conversation efficiency). Further, the low-cost FePO4 based SCMFC in this coupled system not only provided the external bias (rather than the traditional means) but also self-provided bio-electrons for extensive and in-depth mineralization of pollutants. Interestingly, this collaborative reactor presented an efficient and cost-effective approach to achieving the dual-degradation of LEV, which combined a photo-responsive semiconductor with a microbial catalyst forming a photo-assisted bioelectrochemical system. Complete LEV mineralization was achieved by the sequential SCMFC-PEC reactor in less than 85 min (3.6 × 10−2 min−1), which was more rapid than other systems. Finally, the LEV degradation process proved the co-existence of oxidation and reduction paths, and the degradation pathways and intermediates were also analyzed and elucidated by LC-TOF-MS and DFT. It was found that the LEV molecule primarily attacked the piperazine ring and F sites by ROS and electrons, respectively. This constructed SCMFC-PEC coupled system has the potential to deal with wastewater in an environmentally compatible and less costly manner.
