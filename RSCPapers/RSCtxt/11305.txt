    , Accepted 1st February 2013First published on 1st February 2013AbstractThe preparation of anthracene-based low band gap conjugated polymers comprising 2,6-linked anthracene and dithienyl-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole or dibithiophenyl-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole alternate repeat units is presented. The photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers in bulk heterojunction solar cells using PC71BM as an acceptor are discussed.
Efforts are underway to develop new materials for application in plastic solar cells in view of the potential of this new technology in affording devices with lower cost than established PV technologies. Research on the optoelectronic properties of anthracene-based systems started as far back as the late 1950's when Kallmann and Pope1 investigated the photovoltaic effect in anthracene crystals. Along with other acenes such as pentacene2,3 and tetracene,4 anthracene and its derivatives5,6 have been widely investigated in organic field-effect transistors in view of their good hole mobilities as a result of π–π stacking of adjacent molecules in films. A number of studies on polymers including anthracene repeat units were performed where the polymers are designed for their light emitting properties.7–10 Incorporation of anthracene into conjugated polymers such as poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(p-phenylene-vinylene)s (PPE–PPV) through its 9,10-positions has been shown to impart good hole carrier mobilities and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 3.8%11–14 for certain derivatives of these polymers using fullerenes as molecular acceptors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Incorporation of anthracene into conjugated polymers through its 2,6-positions has also led to polymers with good PCEs. Polymers with alternating 2,6-linked-9,10-bis(triisopropylsilyl ethynyl)anthracene (TIPS anthracene) and tetrathiophene units provided BHJ cells with up to 1.7% PCEs.15 More recently, a donor–acceptor polymer with alternating difuranyl diketopyrrolopyrrole and 2,6-linked anthracene repeat units was reported.16 The polymer provided good hole mobilities in OFETs and a PCE of 2.5% in BHJ cells using PC71BM as an acceptor. In this contribution, we present the preparation of low band gap polymers with alternating 2,6-linked anthracene units flanked by either thienyl or dithienyl groups as donor units and benzothiadiazole with and without alkoxy substituents as acceptor repeat units. The electronic, photophysical and photovoltaic properties of this new class of materials are also presented and discussed.
A series of anthracene-based donor–acceptor polymers were prepared as outlined in Scheme 1. The preparation of the bis-boronate ester monomer 4 (Scheme 1) is key for the preparation of these polymers and was undertaken in good yields starting from 2,6-dibromo-9,10-anthraquinone (1) upon reaction with 1-lithio-4-dodecyloxy-benzene to generate diol 2 after work-up. Diol 2 was converted to anthracene derivative 3 which was in turn converted to the bis-boronate ester 4 upon reaction with bis(pinacolato) diboron in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Suzuki coupling reactions between monomer 4 and dibromides 5, 6 or 7 afforded polymers PPATBT, PPATBT-8 and PPAT2BT respectively. The polymers were fractionated via Soxhlet extraction using different solvents. Polymer PPATBT has limited solubility and only the chloroform fraction of the polymer which has an Mn of 3500 Da and an Mw of 4900 Da (Table 1) is able to be processed into films in BHJ devices while its chlorobenzene fraction (Mn = 7800 Da, Mw = 9100 Da) does not allow for formation of films with adequate thicknesses for making PV devices. Polymer PPATBT-8 which is the analogous polymer to polymer PPATBT but with octyloxy substituents on the benzothiadiazole repeat units had a greater processability with its chloroform fraction having Mn = 25000 Da and Mw = 33900 Da. The processability of polymer PPAT2BT-8 which also has octyloxy substituents on its benzothiadiazole repeat units was also better than that of PPATBT. The yield of the chloroform fraction of the PPAT2BT-8 polymer was low as its polymerisation reaction proceeded at much faster rate than those of the other two polymers. While the polymerisation reactions of PPATBT and PPATBT-8 required 24 hours, the polymerisation of PPAT2BT-8 was complete after 3 hours with a large portion of the polymer precipitating out of solution. As a result a large fraction of the polymer was not soluble in chloroform and remained in the thimble after Soxhlet extraction.

Absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solutions and as thin films are shown in Fig. 1 and the values of the absorption maxima are shown in Table 1. Polymer PPATBT shows an absorption maximum at λmax = 532 nm in chloroform solutions with a shoulder absorption at around 625 nm (Fig. 1a). The shoulder absorption is probably due to stacking of polymer chains and the presence of aggregates in solution. Indeed, while the absorption maximum of PPATBT in films is red shifted as expected to λmax = 563 nm, a similar shoulder absorption is also observed at around 625 nm in films of PPATBT (Fig. 1b). The optical band gap of PPATBT as determined from its onset of absorption in films is Eg = 1.84 eV which is comparable to other donor–acceptor polymers comprising dithienyl-benzothiadiazole monomer repeat units such as PCDTBT (Eg = 1.88 eV) and PF8TBT (Eg = 1.86 eV). Absorption maxima of PPATBT-8 are blue shifted in comparison to those of PPATBT both in solution and as thin films (Table 1). Its optical band gap is also wider than that of PPATBT (1.96 eV for PPATBT-8vs. 1.84 eV for PPATBT). The reduced electronic conjugation in PPATBT-8 when compared to that in PPATBT is probably due to a reduction in the electron accepting properties of benzothiadiazole repeat units upon their substitution with the electron releasing alkoxy substituents which reduces the intramolecular charge transfer along polymer chains. Furthermore, the octyloxy substituents on the benzothiadiazole repeat units could also lead to a twisting of the polymer backbone contributing further to the reduction of electronic conjugation. Polymer PPAT2BT-8 shows more extended electronic delocalization than polymer PPATBT-8 with an optical band gap Eg = 1.86 eV for PPAT2BT-8 compared to Eg = 1.96 eV for PPATBT-8. While the carbazole and bis-alkoxybenzothiadiazole repeat units are separated by one thiophene repeat unit in PPATBT-8 along polymer chains, they are separated by bithiophene repeat units in the case of PPAT2BT-8. This allows polymer chains in PPAT2BT-8 to adopt a more planar conformation and hence more extended electronic delocalization. The bithiophene repeat units are also more electron donating than a single thiophene repeat unit which could also increase the intramolecular charge transfer and also help in increasing the electronic delocalization in PPAT2BT-8 when compared to that in PPATBT-8.

Cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted on the polymers on drop-cast films in acetonitrile with tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as an electrolyte (Fig. 2). Their HOMO and LUMO level values (vs. vacuum) as determined from their onsets of oxidation and reduction are shown in Table 1. The HOMO level of polymer PPATBT is at −5.44 eV which is at a comparable level to that of polymers with similar dithienyl benzothiadiazole repeat units but with 9-alkyl-carbazole alternate repeat units (PCDTBT, HOMO at −5.35 eV17) indicating similar electron donating properties of the 2,6-linked anthracene repeat units when compared to 9-alkyl-carbazole repeat units. The LUMO level value of PPATBT is at −3.21 eV. This value is closer to the vacuum level when compared to that of the structurally similar polymers with carbazole repeat units (PCDTBT, LUMO at −3.42 eV17). The HOMO level of PPATBT-8 at −5.48 eV (Table 1) is similar to that of PPATBT (−5.44 eV) indicating that substitution of the benzothiadiazole units in PPATBT-8 with the electron releasing alkoxy substituents does not affect its HOMO level. The LUMO level of PPATBT-8 (−3.14 eV) is, however, closer to the vacuum level than that of PPATBT (−3.21 eV) as a result of attaching the alkoxy substituents to its benzothiadiazole repeat units. PPAT2BT-8 which has two extra thiophene repeat units along its polymer chains when compared to PPATBT-8 has a shallower HOMO level as a consequence of increased intramolecular charge transfer along its polymer chains. The LUMO level of PPAT2BT-8 is, however, at a similar energy level to that of PPATBT-8 (−3.11 eV for PPAT2BT-8vs. −3.14 eV for PPATBT-8).

Photovoltaic measurements were made on a series of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Ca/Al devices using blends of polymers:PC70BM in weight/weight ratios of 1:2 to 1:4. The results from the best devices obtained in these studies are outlined in Table 1 and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3. PPATBT provided devices with a poorer performance when compared to those made with PPATBT-8 and PPAT2BT-8. The poor performance of PPATBT stems from its poor solubility as a result of a lack of solubilizing groups along its polymer backbone. It provided devices with a Voc of 0.59 V and a PCE of 1.93%. Polymers PPATBT-8 and PPAT2BT-8 provided devices with a better performance with PCEs of 3.92 and 4.17% respectively. PPAT2BT-8 has a lower Voc value than PPATBT-8 as a result of its shallower HOMO level. Polymer PPAT2BT-8 showed the best performance in this series of polymers as it has the highest fill factor presumably as a result of better packing of polymer chains in blends and better charge mobility, however, further studies are required to elucidate this as well as to optimise the performance of this series of polymers.

These preliminary results have shown that the use of 2,6-linked anthracene groups as donor units in donor–acceptor conjugated polymers offers the possibility to design new classes of low band gap polymers that could be applied efficiently as active materials in BHJ solar cells when used with fullerene derivatives or other acceptors. Further investigations into the use of these new polymers in BHJs are currently ongoing.
