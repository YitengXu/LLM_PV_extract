While research is still in its infancy, it is important to analyse the economic feasibility of such a process. In this study, we present a detailed techno-economic analysis (TEA) of a potential photo-biorefinery approach for sunlight-driven electro-oxidation of glucose to produce valuable fuels and chemicals i.e., H2, gluconic acid (GNA) and glucaric acid (GRA). Under a base case scenario, the results are promising with a minimum selling price (MSP) of GRA at $6.94 per kg, which will be ∼70% lower than the current market price. The detailed breakdown and sensitivity analysis suggest that unlike conventional water electrolysis, the cost of raw materials and separation has a significant impact on the economics. Furthermore, we also establish performance targets for conversion (90%), selectivity (90%), feed concentration (0.5 M) and operating current density (0.4 A cm−2) such that if these targets are achieved, photo-electrochemical conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals can become a very profitable option with a MSP of GRA as low as $1.42 per kg.
1. Introduction
With the catastrophic effects of climate change and environmental damage visible to us, the world continues to transition from fossil fuels to renewables for its energy needs. While renewable energy technologies continue to increase in market share, it is now clear that it is not possible to replace fossil fuels unless we develop solutions to get around the intermittent and unreliable nature of renewables. The US Energy Information Administration predicts renewables to grow rapidly and contribute ∼38% to our electricity needs by 2050, however contributing only 15.5% to our total energy needs.1 On the other hand, fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal) will still be dominant in 2050, contributing ∼70% to our energy needs.1 For renewables to further contribute to the future sustainable energy system, we need large scale seasonal energy storage options. In this context, conversion of renewable energy into chemicals and fuels has been attracting global attention, given the fact that they have one of the highest storage capacities and discharge times.2
With the drastic decrease in the cost of electricity from solar and wind, electrolysis has become an attractive route to convert H2O or CO2 to fuels/chemicals using renewable energy.3–7 Electrochemical systems offer modular design for small to large scale applications and are responsive to intermittent renewable energy.8 The advantage of an electrochemical process is the simplicity of reactors, and mild operating conditions, which has the potential to decrease the operating costs compared to those of a conventional heterogeneous catalytic reactor.9,10 In electrochemical reactions, a change in electrode potential can be used to control the rate and product selectivity.11 The biggest challenge of implementing electrochemical conversion of H2O or CO2 comes from the anodic half of the reaction – which involves water oxidation, representing >90% of the energy needed.12 In recent years there have been efforts to replace the water oxidation reaction with the oxidation of alcohols or biomass-derived molecules.10,13,14 Anodic biomass oxidation is of interest, as non-edible biomass is known to be the earth's most abundant renewable resource due to the possibility of oxidizing to value-added chemicals.15 In the last decade, there have been experimental reports of electrochemical conversion of biomass-derived compounds such as ethanol, glycerol, benzyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol and glucose to value-added chemicals.13–16 However, the reported current density, conversion and selectivity were too low to attract any attention.
To date, many different catalysts consisting of platinum,17 silver,18 gold,19 copper, iron20 and cobalt have been tested for electrochemical oxidation of glucose (EOG). The electrochemical activity strongly depends on the electrode material. While platinum demonstrates low overpotential for EOG in an acidic medium, gold exhibits higher activity in a neutral medium.21 Unfortunately, noble metal electrodes lose their activity with time due to poisoning caused by reaction intermediates. According to several reports based on spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements, the major poison for Pt is the adsorbed CO.22 Recently there has been a lot of interest in selective EOG to glucaric acid (GRA) and gluconic acid (GNA) under alkaline conditions using low cost nickel based catalysts.23–26 This is mainly due to the importance and applications of GRA. GRA is recognized as a “top value-added biomass-based compound” and is a key intermediate for production of biodegradable polymers, detergents, soaps, food ingredients, corrosion inhibitors, and is used in deicing applications.27,28 Moreover, GRA and its derivatives can also be used for healthcare purposes such as cancer chemotherapy and cholesterol reduction. According to a market report by Grand View Research, Inc., the global GRA market size in 2016 was about USD 550.4 million and is expected to reach USD 1.30 billion by 2025.29 GRA is currently produced from chemical oxidation which is performed either by stoichiometric oxidation of glucose with HNO3 in the absence of catalysts, or by catalytic oxidation of glucose with O2 (air) in the presence of noble metal (e.g., Au, Pt, Pd, and Ru)-based catalysts at 45–120 °C.23,30–34 The conventional route to make GRA from glucose suffers from the requirement of large amount of toxic oxidants, leading to high raw material costs.26,35 Additionally, the low selectivity of the conventional route leads to costly separation and use of high pressure O2 (or air) also increasing operating costs. This leads to a high market price of pure GRA which widely varies between $24 per kg to $200 per kg.36,37
While there have been a few reports on electrocatalyst development for conversion of glucose to GRA/GNA, there are very limited comprehensive techno-economic analysis (TEA) studies dedicated to assessing the economic feasibility. Furthermore, TEA studies will help set technological goals to guide experimentalists. In this study, we report a detailed TEA on alkaline electrolysis of glucose along with the separation of products, using electricity supplied from a silicon photovoltaic (PV) farm and complimented with electricity from the grid at night. Using conservative base case assumptions of an operating current density of 0.2 A cm−2, glucose conversion of 50% and GRA selectivity of 50%, our results indicate that the minimum selling price of GRA can be ∼$6.94 per kg. Our results also suggest that like water electrolysis, the operating expenses (OPEX) have a much heavier weightage over capital expenses (CAPEX), but the OPEX is dominated by raw material and separation costs, whereas electricity price controls the OPEX for water electrolysis. We also analysed the sensitivity of the process to various economic and reaction parameters and established performance targets such that if these targets are achieved, electrochemical oxidation of glucose can become a profitable option. Specifically, our results indicate that the entire process is very sensitive to glucose conversion, the selectivity of GRA, and the glucose concentration. Finally, we also present an optimistic scenario where if we reach an operating current density of 0.4 A cm−2, glucose conversion of 90% and GRA selectivity of 90%, the minimum selling price of GRA could drop to as low as $1.42 per kg.
2. Results and discussion
(a). Process description for hybrid solar-powered electrocatalytic production of GNA/GRA from glucose
We developed an integrated process design based on a hybrid system where a biomass electrolyser along with the product separation plant gets the required electricity from a crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV farm during the day and grid at night, as shown in Fig. 1. The process generates H2, GRA (target chemical) and other valuable byproducts such as GNA and K2SO4. The plant lifetime was assumed to be 20 years, with a depreciation lifetime of 10 years and operating time of 350 days per year.9,38,39 For the base case and optimistic case analysis, a GRA production of 10000 tons per year was assumed for large scale production, for which the capital costs were more favorable and differences between products were more discernible while keeping the electrolyser system power requirements within the range of the large commercial systems. The material balance was calculated based on eqn (1)–(4): C6H12O6 + H2O → C6H12O7 + H2(1) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → C6H10O8 + 3H2(2) 2H2O → 2H2 + O2(3) H2SO4 + 2KOH → K2SO4 + 2H2O(4)
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the hybrid solar and grid-powered glucose electrolysis process to produce GRA and GNA. 
The glucose oxidation involves two steps: (1) the oxidation of glucose to GNA, which involves two electrons, and (2) the oxidation of GNA to GRA, which involves four electrons (Fig. 2). As seen in eqn (1)–(3), the electrochemical oxidation of glucose does not require other oxidants such as O2 or air. Gluconic acid is derived from the oxidation of the aldehyde group on C1 (oxidation of the H–CO group to COOH via two-electron transfer); glucuronic acid is derived from the oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group on C6 (oxidation of the CH2OH group to H–CO via two-electron transfer); and glucaric acid is derived from the complete oxidation of both groups, C1 and C6, to carboxyl groups.25
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the reactions occurring in the electrochemical oxidation of glucose to GNA and GRA. 
Using the base case assumptions, when 1 mol (0.181 kg) of glucose is consumed, 0.25 mol (0.049 kg) of GNA and 0.25 mol (0.052 kg) of GRA are produced in the anode. Meanwhile, 1 mol (0.002 kg) of H2 is produced in the cathode. Thus, for a fixed production rate of 10000 tons GRA per year, the glucose requirement will be 34285 tons per year, producing 9333.33 tons GNA per year at the anode and 384.00 tons of H2 per year at the cathode. Using a glucose concentration of 0.1 M and KOH concentration of 1.0 M, we can calculate the water requirement of 1904761.90 tons per year and KOH 106666.67 tons per year. The electrochemical oxidation of glucose under alkaline conditions results in production of potassium salts of the products i.e., potassium gluconate (C6H11KO7) and potassium glucarate (C6H8K2O8). Thus, prior to the recovery of GRA and GNA, the potassium salts present in the liquid mixture are neutralized with H2SO4 (93333.33 tons per year) to produce K2SO4 (165714.29 tons per year) which is a valuable byproduct to produce fertilizers, as shown in Fig. 3. Then, the neutralized mixture is shifted to a flash drum distillation column to remove the solvent (water), and the remaining concentrated liquid is then sent to crystallizers to recover the target chemicals (GRA, GNA, and K2SO4). Due to the use of a neutralizer reactor, the recycling of electrolyte and glucose is not considered in this analysis.

(b). Base case model assumptions
The c-Si solar farm was based on high efficiency (19%) c-Si PV modules with a module cost of $0.44 per W.40,41 A single-axis tracking system which is typical of utility-scale PV plants was used with a tracker cost of $0.24 per W.40 The process was designed to be based in Arizona State, USA with an average daily sunshine of ∼9 hours, thus requiring grid electricity for ∼15 hours.42 The cost of labour, design, permitting and interconnection of the PV solar farm was taken as an average from various reported installed projects.40
Currently, there is no commercial biomass/glucose electrolyser available. The preliminary experimental reports on electrochemical biomass oxidation are mostly based on alkaline electrolytes using non-precious metals such as Ni/Fe oxides as used for water electrolysis.43,44 Currently the total CAPEX requirement for an alkaline electrolyser varies in the range of $600–$1400 per kW.45,46 Thus, to provide an estimate for the capital costs of an electrolyser system, an alkaline water electrolyser stack with the cost of $450 per kW was used as a representative model.45,47 The auxiliary system that is the balance of plant (BoP) for a biomass electrolyser was also taken at $450 per kW and represents ∼50% of the electrolyser system (stack + BoP) cost in an alkaline electrolyser.45 To make the model sensitive to current density, cost per surface area was also determined. This cost was calculated based on the typical operating conditions of 200 mA cm−2 and 1.68 V for the alkaline electrolyser, from which the base case was derived, corresponding to an installed cost of $1512 per m2.47 An installation cost of 10% of total uninstalled CAPEX was used for the electrolyser, which takes into account other indirect costs associated.46 Furthermore, the annual maintenance costs were taken as 2.5% of the capital investment per year.9,39 The main difference in our system is it requires a feed of KOH electrolyte + glucose on the anode side versus only KOH electrolyte in the water electrolyser. The stack replacement lifetime was taken as 7 years, based on commercial alkaline electrolyser stacks with a lifetime of 60000 hours operating for 8400 h per year.39,45,48 The power requirement for the electrolyser subsystem was calculated based on the faradaic mass balances across the electrolyser with the PV solar farm sized to match the power requirement of the electrolyser. All the processes, electrolysers and PV parameters used in the study are listed in Table 1.

The products in the electrolyte stream are then fed to the neutralizer reactor in order to generate pure GNA and GRA from their respective potassium salts by reacting with H2SO4. Then, the neutralized liquid mixture is sent to the separation system. Since the single-pass accumulation for liquid products is typically very small (∼0.98%, see the ESI for calculation†), prior to the separation process the electrolyte stream is sent to a flash drum in order to remove the extra solvent (water). The feed stream to the flash drum is required to be superheated using a heat exchanger that uses steam. It is important to mention that in the proposed process, steam is purchased as utility and not generated on-site. The separation unit consists of three sets of crystallizers and dryers that are connected in series to recover the target chemicals (K2SO4, GRA and GNA). The crystallizers effectively separate the mixture according to differences in solubility of the components present in the solution, which leads to high recovery rates with high purities. The separation process was modelled using Aspen Plus V10.0, and capital and utility costs were estimated using the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer V10.0. The cost of compressing H2 and storage of the chemicals is not considered in this analysis. A detailed process flow diagram is presented in the ESI.†
(c). Financial parameters
The technologies used in the design such as c-Si PV cells, alkaline electrolysers, neutralizer reactors and crystallizers have been employed and well-studied in previous commercial plants. Hence, the techno-economic analysis reported here uses nth-plant economics that ignore additional costs of pioneer plants and other artificial inflation of project costs associated with delayed start-ups, risk financing and equipment overdesign.49,50 To estimate the return on capital investment for the development of a biomass electrolysis facility, a discounted cash flow spreadsheet was developed to estimate the CAPEX, yearly operating costs and revenue over the project lifetime. It was assumed that CAPEX allocation and construction of the plant was completed in the first three years, with plant operation beginning in the fourth year. A standard nominal interest rate (NIR) of 10%, compounded annually, and a total effective income tax rate of 38.9% were assumed.9 A straight line 10 year depreciation schedule was used with a 5% salvage value at the end of plant life while working capital was assumed to be 15% of the capital investment.51 The base case electricity price of 5.5¢ per kWh was consistent with the current industrial electricity rates in the US. Steam (@ 1135 kPa) which is critical for the boiler used in the flash drum was procured at a cost of $9.5 per ton.51,52 All these economic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 also lists the costs of raw materials (glucose, KOH, water and H2SO4) and products (H2, K2SO4, GNA and GRA), and these values were taken and averaged from various sources.53–59

(d). Reaction parameters
For the base case process, we assume a conservative scenario in which the total conversion of glucose is 50%, and the selectivity to GNA and GRA is 50% and 50%, respectively. It must be noted that higher glucose conversion and GRA selectivity have been reported in the literature, but the reported current density was low (<100 mA cm−2) and the reactions were performed in a batch reactor.23 A better electrolyser and catalyst design could potentially boost the glucose conversion and selectivity to well over 50%, as low conversions and selectivity will result in a more challenging product separation. Thus, for an optimistic scenario, we assumed glucose conversion and GRA selectivity of 90%, a higher operating current density of 0.4 A cm−2, an operating voltage of 1.4 V and a glucose concentration of 0.5 M. The operating voltage was chosen based on recent experimental reports23 and it was assumed that at these operating voltages there is 100% faradaic efficiency for glucose oxidation i.e. no water oxidation occurs. The reaction assumptions for both cases are summarized in Table 3. The process and financial parameters were identical for both cases as listed in Tables 1 and 2.

(e). Capital costs, operating costs and revenue
The capital expenses (CAPEX), operating expenses (OPEX) and revenue streams for both the base case and optimistic case are compared in Fig. 4, with the detailed numbers presented in the ESI.† The CAPEX consists of equipment cost (PV + electrolyser + separation equipment), indirect project costs (freight, insurance, taxes, engineering, and contractor fees), working capital (amount of capital required to start up the plant and finance the first few months), contingency (factor to cover unforeseen circumstances) and land cost. In the base case capital costs and equipment costs are the major contributors, followed by contingency and working capital costs. At the same time, we observe that the electrolyser and PV farm contribute a smaller fraction to the total CAPEX at 9.26% and 9.37%, respectively versus the separation equipment (flash drum + crystallizer) which contributes almost 50%. This is due to the lower energy required for electrochemical production versus the separation which is more energy intensive. This is verified in the CAPEX distribution of the optimistic case where we observed a drop in the CAPEX, with a lower contribution from the electrolyser and solar farm at 3.57% and 6.23%, respectively. This is primarily due to a decrease in electrolyser cost because of the lower power/energy requirement to make the same quantity of products. The cost of a solar PV farm also decreases as its size scales according to the electrolyser.
 Fig. 4  Breakdown of the CAPEX, annual OPEX and annual revenue for a solar-powered glucose electrolysis process to produce GRA and GNA, using base case and optimistic assumptions as listed in Table 3. Note: separation equipment consists of a neutraliser reactor, flash drum and crystallizers. 
Operating costs consist of raw material costs, utility costs, fixed operating costs, and maintenance costs. The largest portion of the total operating cost for both the base case and the optimistic case is the raw material costs, dominated by glucose and KOH costs. The second biggest contributor is the steam cost which indicates the cost of separation and is ∼15.5% for the base case but falls to ∼9% in the optimistic scenario due to higher conversion and selectivity which decreases the separation cost. Additionally, what is interesting to note is that the electricity cost is a very small fraction of the operating costs, unlike typical water electrolysis systems where the electricity cost is the major contributor to the OPEX. There are several reasons for this: (1) lower power/electricity requirement versus a water electrolyser (operating voltage of ∼1.4 V versus 1.7 V), (2) cost of raw materials is significant due to the cost of glucose and KOH which is utilized in the neutralizer reactor to make K2SO4 and (3) cost of separating products is significant versus a water electrolyser where we do not need any separation. A further breakdown of the capital costs for different separation equipment and operating costs due to raw materials required is provided in Fig. S3 of the ESI.†
The revenue stream consists of income from GNA, GRA, K2SO4, and H2 as shown in Fig. 4. In the base scenario, the major revenue is from GRA and K2SO4 which is a very valuable by-product for the fertilizer business selling at ∼400$ per ton.59 As expected, when operating at higher conversion and selectivity (optimistic case), GRA, which is the targeted product, becomes the major revenue source.
(f). Minimum selling price and sensitivity analysis
As described before, after calculating the CAPEX, OPEX and revenue, we determined the minimum selling price (MSP, the price that makes the net present value equal to zero) for GRA using a discounted cash flow analysis (table in the ESI†) using the various economic assumptions and parameters listed in Table 2. The MSP expressed in terms of dollars per kilogram of GRA, was $6.94 per kg in the base case and $1.42 per kg in the optimistic case. Our results suggest that the electrochemical production of GRA could be profitable given that the current market price of GRA ranges from $24–200 per kg. The high current market price of GRA indicates the difficulties associated with the main commercial route for GRA production, via nitric acid oxidation. This process requires base-neutralization, also resulting in GRA as its calcium or potassium glucarate salt.61 However, the process suffers from low GRA yields (∼40%) due to formation of many co-products including gluconic, 5-ketogluconic, tartaric and oxalic acids, which makes the separation and purification very costly. Recently there have been reports on using new technologies for separation and purification of GRA from nitric acid oxidation, incorporating ion exchange and azeotropic evaporation below 50 °C to avoid lactone formation, which could potentially reduce glucaric acid price to ∼$2.91 per kg.62
To understand the sensitivity of the process profitability to different parameters, a sensitivity analysis was performed. Key economic parameters such as raw material cost, the selling price of by-products, electricity price and steam cost can have large impacts on the MSP. Over a 20 year period, all these parameters could fluctuate significantly due to changes in market demand and the development of new technologies. Fig. 5 shows the sensitivity of the MSP of GRA to different economic parameters, where each parameter was varied by ±40%. Among all the by-products, the cost of K2SO4 has a big impact on the MSP as it has the biggest contribution to the revenue stream (∼45.8%). While hydrogen is generally known to be a very valuable fuel, its impact on overall economics is not significant in our process as the quantity produced is very little (∼384 tons per year). If we analyse the sensitivity to feed cost, we observe that KOH has a big effect as it is not recirculated due to the neutralization reaction in order to recover pure GNA and GRA, but also produces K2SO4 as a by-product. Moreover, KOH is quite expensive versus the other feed such as glucose and water (see Table 2), resulting in the economics being sensitive to the cost of KOH. We also considered the effect of utility costs such as electricity price and steam cost on the MSP of GRA. As renewable energy sources such as solar and wind continue to become cheaper, the price of electricity could be as low as $0.03 per kWh.63 An optimistic case value of $0.033 per kWh was chosen as this could be reached very soon.64 As discussed for OPEX distribution in Fig. 4, we observe that unlike typical water electrolysis, the entire process is not very sensitive to electricity price, but more to steam cost which determines the cost of product separation.
 Fig. 5  Sensitivity analysis to illustrate the impact of ±40% changes in key economic parameters on the MSP of GRA for the base case scenario. 
Next, we looked at the importance of optimizing the reaction parameters in order to reduce the cost of production. Fig. 6(a) shows the importance of achieving high conversion and selectivity which can significantly reduce the MSP of GRA. Specifically on increasing the selectivity from 50 to 90%, the MSP decreases from $6.94 per kg to $5.0 per kg, and increasing conversion (90%) is more beneficial leading to a decrease in MSP to only $4.0 per kg.
 Fig. 6  Sensitivity analysis to illustrate the impact of change in reaction parameters on the MSP of GRA for the base case scenario. (a) Change in selectivity and conversion from 20% to 90% and (b) change in glucose/KOH concentration by 5 times. 

Fig. 6(b) shows the importance of optimizing the concentration of the feed i.e., glucose and KOH concentration. The glucose concentration is one of the most important parameters which can be tuned in order to lower the MSP. Since the glucose concentration defines the water requirement, which in turn defines equipment size and amount of KOH, it has a big impact on the economics. Our results indicate that working at higher glucose concentrations will lead to lower MSP and vice versa. This effect is not linear, where we observe that upon increasing the glucose concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 M (5 times increase), the MSP of GRA drops from 6.94 to $2.1 per kg. On the other hand at a lower glucose concentration of 0.02 M (5 times decrease from 0.1), the MSP of GRA increases significantly from $6.94 per kg to $30.74 per kg. The KOH concentration has an inverse effect on economics, fruitful to work at lower concentrations. For example, if we can maintain the same current density, conversion and selectivity at a KOH concentration of 0.2 M versus 1 M, we will be able to decrease the MSP to $4.17 per kg.
In order to define catalyst performance targets, we looked at the process economics when changing two reaction parameters together. As discussed previously in the sensitivity analysis the MSP of GRA is very sensitive to GRA selectivity, glucose conversion and the concentration of glucose and KOH. Fig. 7 shows the combined effect, best represented by contour plots where the solid black line represents the market selling price of GRA at ∼$24 per kg. For the electrochemical process to attract any attention, the electrolyser performance must lie to the right of the black curve. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the production of GRA can be profitable if the glucose conversion and GRA selectivity are above 25%. Optimizing either parameter could make the process even more attractive, with the best-case scenario of GRA MSP at $3.8 per kg when both conversion and selectivity are at ∼80%. Such a scenario could be possible soon as high conversions and GRA selectivity (>80%) have been achieved, albeit at a low current density of ∼100 mA cm−2.23 If the catalyst and reactor can be optimized to achieve higher current densities of 0.2–0.3 A cm−2 without compromising on selectivity, this would drive down the cost of GRA produced. Fig. 7(b) indicates that the glucose concentration is the dominant factor in order to control the price of GRA. The KOH concentration mainly has an effect on the MSP of GRA when glucose concentrations are below 0.1 M. Working at a glucose concentration > 0.1 M results in the MSP of GRA lower than the current market price, with the lowest MSP of ∼$1.5 per kg at a glucose concentration of 0.5 M.

3. Summary and conclusion
In summary, we designed and analysed the techno-economics of a process to convert solar energy to fuels and chemicals via electrochemical oxidation of a biomass-derived molecule i.e., glucose. Specifically, we analysed the conversion of glucose to glucaric and gluconic acids, as these have high market demand and have been identified as high-value chemicals. Current technologies for conversion of glucose to GNA and GRA are inefficient and not scalable leading to a high market price. A detailed analysis revealed that an electrochemical process could be profitable even if we achieve low glucose conversions of ∼50%, GRA selectivity of ∼50% and operate at current densities of 0.2 A cm−2 like water electrolysers. We analysed the sensitivity of the process to economic parameters, which indicated the process to be very sensitive to the cost of KOH, K2SO4 and steam. We also used the economic model to define catalyst performance targets, which highlighted the benefit of improving glucose conversion (>25%), GRA selectivity (>25%) and working at a high glucose concentration (>0.1 M). To conclude, with improvements in catalyst performance and decreasing cost of electrolyser technology, electrochemical conversion of renewable and cheap feedstocks from biomass to value-added chemicals and fuel (H2) could represent the future of the biochemical industry and can be advantageous for both the economy and environment.
