    , Accepted 21st July 2015First published on 22nd July 2015AbstractWe report the synthesis of stable rGO/TiO2/Au nanowire hybrids showing excellent electrocatalytic activity for ethanol oxidation. Phase-pure anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (∼3 nm) were grown on GO sheets followed by the growth of ultrathin Au nanowires leading to the formation of a multidimensional ternary structure (0-D TiO2 and 1-D Au on 2-D graphene oxide). The oleylamine used for the synthesis of the Au nanowires not only leads to stable Au nanowires anchored on the GO sheets but also leads to the functionalization and room temperature reduction of GO. Using control experiments, we delineate the role of the three components in the hybrid and show that there is a significant synergy. We show that the catalytic activity for ethanol oxidation primarily stems from the Au nanowires. While TiO2 triggers the formation of oxygenated species on the Au nanowire surface at a lower potential and also imparts photoactivity, rGO provides a conducting support to minimize the charge transfer resistance in addition to stabilizing the Au nanowires. Compared with nanoparticle hybrids, the nanowire hybrids display a much better electrocatalytic performance. In addition to high efficiency, the nanowire hybrids also show a remarkable tolerance towards H2O2. While our study has a direct bearing on fuel cell technology, the insights gained are sufficiently general such that they provide guiding principles for the development of multifunctional ternary hybrids.
Introduction
Gold and its alloys have been extensively used as catalysts for a wide range of reactions for energy generation and environmental protection.1 For these applications, controlling the size,2 shape3 and composition of the catalyst4 is critical for enhancing the catalytic performance. The activity of Au catalysts is usually explained in terms of an electronic effect (d-band position) that directly influences the interaction of the reactant molecules with the catalyst surface.5 However, an inherently low binding energy of oxygen species on the Au surface is a major limiting factor for various oxidation reactions.6 Electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols is regarded to be ideal for portable power applications owing to the high energy conversion efficiency; however, this reaction requires an optimum adsorption of oxygenated species on the Au catalyst.7 To achieve this, the most widely used strategy is to design a bimetallic catalyst of Au alloyed with oxophilic metals that may significantly enhance the reaction kinetics.8,9 The key problem involved in these bimetallic catalysts is the dissolution of the lesser noble metal in the electrolyte during operation that leads to compositional changes and is detrimental for the long-term stability of the catalyst.4 To solve the aforementioned issues, oxide-supported monometal nanostructures are ideal, based on both electronic and bifunctional effects of the support.10,11 Furthermore, the strong metal–support interaction promotes the oxidation reaction, due to the modified electronic structure of Au.12 Recently, it has been proposed that the metal oxide support could enhance the performance of ethanol fuel cells by weakening the C–C bond.7,13 It is generally accepted that the oxide–gold interface plays a significant role in the catalytic performance.12,14 TiO2 has emerged as a promising substrate because of inherent optoelectronic properties that is expected to further stimulate the performance of the catalyst via photoexcitation.15 However, the low conductivity of TiO2 and high rates of charge recombination are disadvantageous for practical applications and thus the design of a different type of support is needed.16,17
The toolbox to tackle the above-mentioned problems is rich and includes the modification of the metal oxide with carbon supports18,19 that are capable of providing high conductivity and good dispersion of the oxide. Over the past few years, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has emerged as a potential support because of its anchoring ability towards catalyst particles arising from the functional groups on its surface.20–22 A judicious combination of TiO2 and rGO is attractive,23,24 as it could potentially suppress the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and can serve as a highly conducting support material for fuel cells.25
Electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation using Au as the catalyst is sensitive to the structure of the gold surface.3 In the case of ultrathin nanowires, a significant fraction of the atoms reside on the surface and contribute to subtle changes in the electronic structure due to relaxation.26 Thus, it would be interesting to investigate the use of Au nanowires as a potential candidate for electrocatalytic reactions.27,28 Indeed, recent work using Au nanowires (AuNWs) has demonstrated a negative shift in the redox potential of ferri/ferro-cyto-c as well as exceptional performance for electrocatalysis.29,30 In this study, we use ultrathin Au nanowires synthesized using wet chemical means31–33 as a catalyst for alcohol oxidation reactions. We use TiO2 nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide as the support to grow the ultrathin AuNWs and demonstrate a synergistic coupling effect in the multidimensional ternary catalyst involving 0-D TiO2, 1-D AuNWs and 2-D rGO. We also synthesize the binary counterparts to delineate the contribution of each of the components to the overall performance of the hybrid. The ternary hybrid architecture exhibited promising electrochemical activity due to the synergy by utilizing incipient oxide formation on Au nanowires coupled with the higher electrical conductivity from rGO. The supported AuNWs exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity than nanoparticle hybrids and also better tolerance against H2O2 crossover effects. To further improve the performance, we have coupled the optoelectronic properties of TiO2 with the electrocatalytic properties of AuNWs and demonstrated an improvement in the photo-assisted electrocatalytic activity in the ternary hybrid. Considering its superior performance, particularly photo-assisted electrocatalytic activity, tolerance and stability, rGO/TiO2/AuNWs appear to be a promising candidate for photofuel cells.
Results and discussion
Growth of ultrathin Au nanowires on supports
The preparation of ternary rGO/TiO2/AuNWs involves two steps: deposition of TiO2 nanoparticles on GO sheets, followed by one-pot GO reduction and growth of ultrathin high single-crystalline Au nanowires. In the first step, graphitic oxide was prepared according to a modified Hummer's method,34 and TiO2 nanoparticles (∼3 nm diameter) were uniformly nucleated on GO through a simple, rapid microwave technique as illustrated in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized GO/TiO2 shows peaks corresponding to pure anatase TiO2 in addition to the intense peak of GO (Fig. S1†). The morphology of the as-synthesized GO/TiO2 was examined using electron microscopy. Fig. 2A shows a representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image that reveals a homogeneous dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles on the GO sheets as is also evident from the SEM image (Fig. S2†). High-resolution TEM micrographs from several regions show that the titania particles are interconnected (Fig. 2B); the d-spacing of 3.5 Å matches well with the (101) spacing of the anatase phase of TiO2 and is also consistent with XRD analysis. The formation of anatase TiO2 was further confirmed by using Raman spectroscopy, the characteristic vibration peak for anatase was observed at 150 (Eg(1)), 396 (B1g(1)), 513 (A1g + B1g(2)) and 639 cm−1 (Eg(2)) (Fig. S3†),35 along with D and G bands of GO. The average size of the TiO2 particles is around 3 nm and is much smaller compared to the size of TiO2 nanoparticles reported earlier.36,37

(C) Bright-field image showing ultrathin Au nanowires (∼2 nm diameter) on a TiO2/rGO hybrid support (D) low magnification SEM micrograph displays the dense and uniform growth of Au nanowires on rGO over a large area. 
The as-synthesized GO/TiO2 composite was added to Au nanowire growth solution (for details, see the Experimental section). The solution mixture was sealed and undisturbed for 6 h at room temperature.38 During this process, the presence of oleylamine (OA) leads to intercalation39 and functionalization of GO followed by direct nucleophilic attack of the amine on the epoxy group that leads to deoxygenation or reduction of GO.40 The resulting amine-modified reduced GO (rGO) loaded with TiO2 favors the growth of nanowires on the surface as depicted schematically in Fig. 1. TEM micrographs (Fig. 2C) of the samples display dense growth of high-aspect-ratio ultrathin Au nanowires on the rGO/TiO2 sheets; the nanowires are well-separated and dispersed on the substrate (Fig. S4†).
As control samples, binary hybrids such as rGO/AuNWs and TiO2/AuNWs were also synthesized under similar conditions for a better understanding of electrochemical properties of the ternary hybrid. Incubating GO in the nanowire growth solution leads to a dense growth of ultrathin AuNWs on GO sheets as seen in the SEM image (Fig. 2D). However, functionalization was required on TiO2 for the growth of nanowires30 (Fig. S5†). The TEM image (Fig. S6†) illustrates the growth of nanowires on amine-modified TiO2 nanoparticles.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of rGO/TiO2/AuNW samples was performed to confirm the oxidation states and the possible binding mechanism between the Au nanowires and the substrate. The presence of spectral peaks corresponding to N 1s (Fig. S7†) confirms the chemical modification of GO by nitrogen.41 It is known that OA strongly adsorbs on the GO sheets.39 Furthermore, the C 1s spectrum of rGO/TiO2/AuNWs can be deconvoluted into several peaks at 284.5 eV (sp2C), 285.4 eV (sp3C or C–OH or C–N), 286.5 eV (epoxy C–O), 287.7 eV (carbonyl –CO) and 288.8 eV (carboxylate –COO–) as shown in Fig. 3A.42–44 Compared with the C 1s of GO/TiO2 (as shown in Fig. 3B), the oxygenated functional groups are significantly reduced in rGO/TiO2/AuNWs, indicating the room temperature reduction of GO by OA. This is also evident from XRD analysis that shows a reduction in the basal spacing resulting from the reduction of GO (Fig. S1†).45 Additionally, similar GO reduction (without TiO2) was observed (Fig. S8†) under incubation of GO in Au nanowire growth solution suggesting simultaneous room temperature reduction of GO and Au with OA. Therefore, it can be deduced that the room temperature reduction of GO is facilitated by the amine. In particular, based on mechanisms proposed in the literature, nucleophilic substitution between amine and GO leads to deoxygenation and reduction of GO.40 Interestingly, a shift of Au binding energy towards lower values was observed for TiO2 (Fig. S9†) and rGO/TiO2 (Fig. 3C) supported ultrathin Au nanowires as compared to the Au nanowires on bare GO (Fig. 3D). We propose that electron transfer from TiO2 to Au contributes to the observed shift, leading to electron accumulation in the Au wire.12 From the relative position of the Au work function, intrinsic defect states (F-center electron) and conduction band of TiO2,46 an electron from the F-center of TiO2 can migrate to Au contributing to the reduction in the binding energy as observed by XPS. On the contrary, no shift in Au 4f was observed for rGO/AuNWs (Fig. 3D) validating the hypothesis of electron transfer from TiO2 to Au.

Support-dependent electrocatalytic activity
We carried out alcohol oxidation reaction to test the electrochemical properties of the ternary and binary hybrids. On the basis of both theoretical calculation and experimental observations, electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols requires OH− adsorption or pre-oxidation species on the catalyst gold surface.47,48 These species act as an oxidant, leading to a significant reduction in the activation energies for electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation. Indeed, several studies have validated that the appearance of redox features is mandatory for alcohol oxidation on the gold surface.30,47,49 Therefore, we have initially evaluated the electrodes for the redox features in 1 M NaOH at a scan rate of 40 mV s−1 (Fig. 4A).
 Fig. 4  (A) Cyclic voltammograms in 1 M NaOH of rGO/TiO2/AuNWs (GTA), rGO/AuNWs (GA), TiO2/AuNW (TA) electrodes. Nanowires without TiO2 nanoparticles (GA) need a high positive potential to exhibit characteristic Au redox features. (B) CVs of supported nanowires measured in 1 M NaOH containing 1.5 M ethanol at a scan rate of 40 mV s−1 showing support-dependent activity. The presence of the conducting rGO support leads to a higher oxidation current. (C) Nyquist plot at different applied potentials showing that charge transfer resistances are relatively low for AuNWs grown on the conducting support in 1.5 M ethanol and 1 M NaOH. Hollow and solid symbols represent GA and TA, respectively. (D) CVs measured in 1 M NaOH containing 1.5 M ethanol for the pre-activated GA electrode showing negligible EOX current after dipping the electrode in hexane containing oleylamine. After cycling to a high positive potential for several cycles, the same electrode exhibited activity. Legend representation: G – rGO, T – TiO2 and A – Au. 
Cyclic voltammograms of rGO/TiO2/AuNWs exhibit a broad peak around 0.3 V that corresponds to partial oxidation of the Au surface accompanied by the reduction of formed oxide at −0.01 V in the reverse scan. Based on the IHOAM model,47 the observed characteristic gold redox features suggest that the ternary hybrid could be active towards ethanol oxidation. We note that the inherent inertness of Au due to the deep d-band position6 towards chemisorption of oxygenated species is by-passed here with the presence of TiO2 in the support. To validate the role of TiO2, rGO/Au nanowires with a comparable ratio of Au to carbon were employed for comparison. The voltammograms in this case are featureless while cycling up to 0.6 V as shown in Fig. 4A. Moreover, when repeatedly scanning between −0.3 V and 0.6 V for multiple cycles, there is no reduction peak of Au oxide in the reverse scan indicating the absence of Au redox reactions in this case. However, increasing the cycling potential range to +1 V for a few cycles leads to redox features as manifested in the form of oxidation and reduction peaks at 0.3 V and −0.01 V, respectively. Once the redox features start to appear, they remain even when the subsequent cycling range is reduced back to 0.6 V. This observation implies that a high positive potential is initially needed to possibly pre-activate the Au surface.
To obtain further insights into the role played by TiO2 in the ternary catalyst, we prepared TiO2/AuNW hybrids. The CV curve of the TiO2/AuNW electrode was recorded as shown in Fig. 4A which shows the oxidation and reduction features of Au at much lower potential values similar to those seen in rGO/TiO2/AuNWs. We rationalize that the observed redox feature is possibly due to the migration of electrons from the F-center of TiO2 to Au46 that could be beneficial for adsorption of hydroxyl groups. This is also evident from the Au 4f spectra in the samples containing TiO2 (Fig. 3C, for instance). This implies that TiO2 has an electronic effect on Au that drives the formation of incipient hydrous oxide at low potentials that can act as a mediator for ethanol oxidation (EOX).
In the case of rGO/AuNWs, active Au redox surfaces are only obtained after a higher positive potential scan, which can be considered to be a kind of activation in order to form oxygenated species on the Au surface. The presence of oleylamine bound to the nanowire surface hampers the adsorption of OH−. The amine forms a complex with Au in basic solution that can be oxidized only at a high positive potential.47 Also, the inherent hydrophobic nature of oleylamine prevents the effective adsorption of OH− from the electrolyte.50 The origin of the activation at a higher potential is possibly due to the oxidation of the undesirable oleylamine complex that leads to the appearance of the redox features in the following cycles.30,47
High resolution XPS was used to investigate the chemical change on the rGO/AuNW electrodes scanned to different final positive potentials. The O 1s XPS spectrum of rGO/AuNWs dipped in the electrolyte (1 M NaOH and 1.5 M ethanol solution) before any electrochemical cycling is displayed in Fig. S10.† In this case, the oxygen spectrum displays a slightly higher content of –CO species as compared to the as-synthesized hybrid nanowires. The oxygen containing amide (carbonyl) group dramatically increased by scanning the electrode to 0.6 V. A further increase in the potential to 1 V resulted in a decrease in the amide groups while the relative ratios of the other oxygen species are similar to the as-synthesized hybrid. The change in the amount of the amide after scanning to 1 V accounts for the very different catalytic behavior and redox process of the hybrid (Fig. S10†). The presence of the amide may block OH− adsorption and impede the redox process of Au. The oxidation of the amide by sweeping to a high positive potential allows the OH− adsorption on Au and is the key mechanism for the activation of the hybrid.
Ethanol oxidation (EOX) efficiencies of the hybrids were investigated in an alkaline medium. The ethanol oxidation peak on rGO/TiO2/AuNWs reaches a maximum at 0.17 V (Fig. 4B) accompanied by a peak in the reverse scan at −0.04 V that corresponds to the removal of carbonaceous species that are formed due to the incomplete oxidation in the forward scan.51 As shown in Fig. 4B, significant differences in the oxidation current density between the ternary and binary (TA) catalysts are observed highlighting the role of supports. Compared with TiO2/AuNWs, the rGO-supported AuNWs showed a remarkably higher oxidation current, which is directly related to the improvement in the conductivity. To further validate this, we carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to determine the interfacial charge resistance influenced by the different supports during ethanol oxidation. Fig. 4C shows the representative Nyquist complex plane impedance spectra at different applied potentials; charge transfer resistance is notably lower for rGO-supported nanowires (275 Ω for rGO/TiO2/AuNWs as compared to 1050 Ω for TiO2/AuNWs). This result indicates the beneficial role of rGO integration in the catalyst as confirmed from the CV results as well. The absence of the ethanol oxidation peak with just the rGO/TiO2 support validates the fact that the observed electrocatalytic activity stems from the Au nanowires (Fig. S11†). Thus both TiO2 nanoparticles and rGO add their specific beneficial effect to the AuNWs, leading to a superior ternary system. Further tests showed that the activity of rGO/AuNWs (without TiO2 nanoparticles) was negligible without activation at a high positive potential. The activated samples show a dramatic reduction in the current density after dipping the electrode in hexane containing oleylamine further confirming the detrimental role of OA in electrooxidation (Fig. 4D). Upon potential cycling to 1 V for several sweeps, the catalyst exhibited EOX oxidation activity (Fig. 4D). We note that there is no morphological change in the supported wires that was observed even after high potential scan in contrast to ultrathin Au nanowires that were drop-cast on the substrate (Fig. 5). This clearly indicates the beneficial role of the direct growth of the wires on the substrate that leads to good binding and higher stability of the nanowires.
 Fig. 5  TEM and SEM micrographs of rGO/AuNWs (A) and bare AuNWs (B) recorded after cycling to 1 V in 1 M NaOH containing 1.5 M ethanol indicating that supported nanowires are stable during electrocatalysis reactions while drop-cast nanowires disintegrate into nanoparticles. 
The impact of Au morphology (wire) on electrocatalytic activity was studied; the activity of rGO/TiO2/Au nanoparticles and TiO2/Au nanoparticles was compared with the observed activity of the supported nanowire hybrids. The supported nanoparticles displayed current density that was atleast 50% smaller than that of nanowire hybrids as shown in Fig. 6A. Moreover, as was the case with the nanowire hybrids, it is observed that the rGO-supported nanoparticles possessed better activity compared to the nanoparticle hybrids without rGO.
 Fig. 6  (A) CVs of rGO/TiO2/Au nanoparticles (GTA NPs) and TiO2/Au nanoparticles (TA NPs) in 1 M NaOH containing 1.5 M ethanol at the scan rate of 40 mV s−1 showing that the current densities are significantly lower as compared with those of nanowire hybrids. (B) Tolerance test to avoid cross-over effects. CV curves of rGO/AuNWs recorded in 1 M NaOH containing 1.5 M ethanol in the absence (a) and presence (b) of H2O2 (0.4 M). 
The long-term stability, the minimization of cross-over and poisoning effects are critical for the use of the hybrids for real applications. The ternary rGO/TiO2/AuNWs exhibited good stability in ethanol oxidation over multiple cycles with a negligible drop in activity over 100 cycles of test (Fig. S12†). It should be pointed out that our method to grow ultrathin nanowires on support overcomes the inherent instability of wires in polar medium like ethanol.29 One of the other key drawbacks in EOX is the dramatic decrease in the kinetics of oxidation owing to the presence of intermediates like CO that compete with ethanol for adsorption. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the electrocatalytic oxidation of CO by means of CO stripping test (Fig. S13†). Most of the previous studies suggest that the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles would increase OH− species near the vicinity of the Au surface, which leads to an increased CO oxidation activity via a bifunctional mechanism.52,53 This is apparently not the case in our present systems, as our CO stripping experiments (Fig. S13†) clearly revealed that supported Au nanowires exhibited low current density when compared to reported Au nanoparticles.54,55 This observation coupled with the fact that the EOX current does not decrease implies that CO adsorption does not poison the catalyst in the present case.
The cross-over effect of supported nanowires with respect to H2O2 oxidant was assessed through CV measurements. Membrane fuel cells employing H2O2 as the oxidant have received increasing attention because of their high theoretical voltages. It is well-documented that H2O2 can oxidize on the Au surface through a free-radical chain reaction.56 Considering the fact that the interaction of H2O2 with AuNWs is likely to decrease the ethanol oxidation current in the presence of H2O2, we examined the crossover effects of H2O2 during ethanol oxidation reaction. Surprisingly, we observed an increase in ethanol oxidation current for rGO/AuNWs in the presence of H2O2 (ref. 57) (Fig. 6B), coupled with the existence of oxidation peak of H2O2 at −0.11 V in the forward scan. This result demonstrates that the nanowire hybrid possesses enhanced EOX with negligible poisoning effects, which is crucial for developing direct ethanol–hydrogen peroxide fuel cells.
Photo-assisted electrocatalytic activities
Considering that TiO2 is a traditional photocatalyst, we coupled the effect of solar light irradiation on TiO2 with the electrocatalytic activity of ultrathin nanowires. The effect of irradiation on the electrooxidation current using TiO2 was investigated. A significant increase in the current with solar light illumination (as shown in Fig. 7A) indicates that the photogenerated charge carriers are consumed for ethanol oxidation. Furthermore, as anticipated, a higher oxidation current was observed for TiO2/AuNWs under illumination as shown in Fig. 7B. Importantly, the magnitude of the photocurrent density is higher than the algebraic sum of ethanol photo-oxidation current of TiO2 and the electrocatalytic current of TiO2/AuNWs. It is well documented that under illumination electron and hole pairs are generated in TiO2 (reaction (1)) TiO2 + hγ → eCB− + hVB+(1) C2H5OH + ˙OH (OH + h+) → ˙CH(OH)CH3 + H2O(2) ˙CH(OH)CH3 + 11˙OH → 2CO2 + 8H2O(3)

(B) rGO/TiO2/AuNWs exhibit higher photo-assisted electroactivity than TiO2/AuNWs showing the influence of the conducting GO substrate. TA and GTA indicate TiO2/AuNWs and rGO/TiO2/AuNWs, respectively. (C) Au nanoparticles nucleated on unmodified TiO2 (TA NP) displays marked enhancement in photocurrent with a considerable potential shift while Au nanoparticles nucleated on oleylamine modified TiO2 (mTA NP) exhibit low photoactivity. (D) Summary of the electro and photoactivity of the hybrids evaluated by CV measurements. The amine effect was nullified by the incorporated rGO, which facilitates fast electron transfer. 
Since the electron affinity of TiO2 is lower than the Fermi level of Au, photo-excited electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to Au is energetically favorable (Scheme 1)58 and an effective charge separation is achieved. The photo-generated holes promote further oxidation of ethanol via hydroxyl radicals (reaction (2)).59 Another frequently occurring phenomenon in alcohol photo-oxidation is that of ‘current doubling’ (reaction (3)) whereby oxidation of the α-hydroxyethyl intermediate radical proceeds with constant injection of electrons to the conduction band of TiO2.60 These electrons along with F-center electrons stimulate the adsorption of the hydroxyl group on the Au surface (Scheme 1) that enhances the electrocatalytic activity of nanowires. Thus, the enhanced current density is attributed to the synergetic effect of photo-assisted electrocatalytic activity of nanowires.
 Scheme 1  Illustration depicts the effect of amine and rGO on interfacial photo-induced charge transfer in both binary (TiO2/AuNWs) and ternary systems (rGO/TiO2/AuNWs). 
The introduction of the rGO support significantly increases the generated photocurrent throughout the potential region (Fig. 7B). The higher photo-electrocatalytic activity of ternary rGO/TiO2/AuNWs observed in this study can be attributed to the enhancement of charge separation in the presence of rGO that extends the lifetime of the active species61,62 and a possible photosensitizing effect of rGO on TiO2 that can increase the photon flux by absorbing a wide range of the light spectrum63 (Fig. S14†). Thus, the TiO2 and rGO add their specific benefits to AuNWs, leading to a superior performance.
To examine the role of morphology of Au in photoelectrocatalytic activity, we compare the activity of TiO2/AuNWs with that of TiO2/Au nanoparticles. The Au nanoparticle hybrid was synthesized without surface modification of TiO2 with amine, unlike the growth of ultrathin Au nanowires on amine-modified TiO2. TEM micrographs of supported Au nanoparticles are shown in Fig. S15.† The electrocatalytic oxidation current density of TiO2/Au nanoparticles is only 1.7 mA cm−2, but under illumination shows a 3-fold increase (Fig. 7C) and is higher than the photoresponse of nanowire hybrids. In addition, the characteristic oxidation EOX peak for TiO2/Au nanoparticles was shifted to a much lower potential with light as marked in Fig. 7C, the smallest potential reported so far.51 Similarly, the oxidation of intermediate carbonates also occurred at a higher positive potential in the reverse scan. We hypothesize that the observed inferior photoresponse in the case of hybrid nanowires may be due to the modification of the TiO2 support with the amine. Indeed, investigations have demonstrated that the charge injection between metal oxide and metal is directly affected by the presence of interface dipoles induced by ligands like amine.64,65
To inspect the electronic interaction between TiO2 and amine, we nucleated Au nanoparticles on an amine-modified TiO2 similar to that used for nanowire growth (for detailed synthesis steps, please see the Experimental section) and employed this as the photoanode (Fig. 7C). The electro and photo-catalytic activities towards ethanol oxidation were dramatically reduced as compared to unmodified TiO2/Au nanoparticles (as shown in Fig. 7D). In addition, this is also reflected in I–V measurements, which display a drastic decrease in the photo and electrocurrent of TiO2 after amine modification (as shown in Fig. 8A). Further, the amine grafting was verified by XPS analysis; deconvoluted N 1s spectra of modified TiO2 display peaks at 398.8 and 400.3 eV (Fig. 8B), which are associated with nitrogen atoms in oleylamine and oleylammonium cations.41 These findings highlight that amine-grafted TiO2 reduces the electro and photoconductivity unlike the increase that happens in the case of ZnO nanorods.30 The above results highlight that while amine modification of TiO2 is essential to grow ultrathin AuNWs, the presence of the amine reduces the overall photoresponse of the hybrid.

In our earlier report, we have shown that amine modifies the surface of ZnO nanorods by passivating the surface dangling bonds that in turn enhances the photo-current and catalytic activity.30 However, the amine has a detrimental effect on the photocurrent and catalytic activity of TiO2. The above result suggests that the charge transfer scenario is different in ZnO nanorods and TiO2 nanoparticles after amine modification. Based on the literature reports for the effects of surface modification on metal oxides, it appears that long chain ligand grafting leads to two counter effects.66 Firstly, the linked ligands can permanently passivate the surface defect/shield the recombination centers, resulting in an enhancement in the photoactivity by suppressing non-radiative recombination.67 The second effect is a dipole effect wherein long chain molecules at the oxide surface create fields that hinder the charge transfer process at the interface. The former effect dominates in 1-D ZnO because single crystalline long nanorods are known for efficient charge transport, so it overwhelms the later effect.68,69 However, in the present case, the TiO2 nanoparticles are not interconnected and thus the interfacial charge transfer is deteriorated. As complied in Fig. 7D, the comparative analysis of photo and electrocatalytic activity between the different binary and ternary hybrids provides interesting information. The effect of amine is not so pronounced in the ternary hybrid when rGO is present, as shown in Fig. 7B. This clearly indicates that the presence of rGO opens up path for the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers either to the electrolyte or the Au surface through rGO (as shown in Scheme 1). Considering the work function levels, the presence of rGO suggests that there would be a dynamic electron (photogenerated) transfer from TiO2 to Au,20 leading to net separation of photogenerated charge carriers as shown in Scheme 1. These findings highlight that direct interference of rGO, involved in the interfacial charge transport, is likely to boost the photoassisted electrocatalytic performance (as shown in Scheme 1).
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a new type of multidimensional 0-D TiO2, 1-D AuNW and 2-D rGO ternary hybrid electrocatalyst by controlled growth of ultrathin Au nanowires on rGO sheets in contact with TiO2 nanoparticles. The amine molecules involved in the reaction not only assist the dense growth of ultrathin Au nanowires on TiO2/GO sheets but also stimulate the room temperature reduction of GO. Our investigation reveals that the electrochemical activity depends on the synergy between the integral constituents of the catalyst. Specifically, the change in the Au electronic structure by the migrated electrons from TiO2 favors the generation of oxygenated species at less positive potential that promotes the alcohol oxidation. The systematic study of the support reveals that rGO reduces the charge transfer resistance of the ternary electrode and also stabilizes the nanowires during performance. In addition to the stability, inherent optoelectronic properties of the support synergistically enhance the performances of nanowires. The incorporation of rGO is also mandatory to nullify the negative effect of amine on TiO2 especially during photo-assisted electrocatalytic oxidation. The above-mentioned insights clearly point the direction for synthesizing hybrids with enhanced performance for various applications beyond fuel cell applications.
Experimental
Synthesis of GO/TiO2
Graphene oxide (GO) was first prepared based on a modified Hummer's method.22 For the microwave synthesis of the GO/TiO2 hybrid, 10 mg of GO was sonicated in 30 mL of de-ionized water for 20 min to achieve a homogeneous dispersion. Titanyl nitrate (TiO(NO3)2) which was prepared by dissolving titanium isopropoxide (250 μL) in a few drops of concentrated nitric acid was added to the above GO dispersion, followed by the addition of 1 M NaOH (1 mL). Finally, the suspension was sonicated for 5 min and then subjected to microwave (2.45 GHz, 300 W) for 3 min. After the reaction, the suspension was cooled down to room temperature under ambient conditions. The products were centrifuged and washed with distilled water several times and finally dried at 100 °C.
Formation of supported nanowire hybrids
To obtain ternary rGO/TiO2/AuNWs, the above synthesized GO/TiO2 was introduced into the gold nanowire growth solution (containing appropriate amounts of HAuCl4 (3 mg), oleylamine (100 μL) and tetraisopropylsilane (150 μL) in 2.5 mL of hexane).38 The mixture was sonicated for 1 min and then incubated for 6 h at room temperature. The end product was cleaned with hexane and ethanol to remove undesired loosely bound ultrathin nanowires along with unreacted precursors, if present.
rGO/AuNWs were prepared by adding GO into gold nanowire growth solution and left undisturbed for 24 h. The obtained product was washed with hexane and ethanol, to remove the unreacted reagents. The as-synthesized rGO/AuNWs were stored in hexane for future characterization and electrochemical tests.
To synthesize TiO2/AuNWs, initially anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by the sol–gel combustion method based on our earlier report.70 To grow ultrathin AuNWs on TiO2, solid state mixing was adopted to modify the surface of TiO2 with oleylamine. 50 μL of oleylamine was mixed with TiO2 (100 mg) using a mortar and pestle; the obtained product was cleaned with hexane and ethanol mixture to remove unbound oleylamine.30 Finally, the amine modified TiO2 was dried and introduced into the Au nanowire growth solution. TEM micrographs revealed that without surface modification of TiO2 primarily larger Au nanoparticles are obtained, which implies that amine modification is required for the growth of nanowires on the TiO2 substrate.
Synthesis of nanoparticle hybrids
30 mg of TiO2 was sonicated for 15 min in 30 mL of water to obtain homogeneous dispersion and 5 mg of HAuCl4 was added. Then the reaction mixture was subjected to microwave (2.45 GHz, 800 W) for 3 min.71 The resulting products were washed several times with distilled water and then dried at 100 °C for further use. Under identical conditions instead of TiO2, GO/TiO2 was used to obtain rGO/TiO2/Au nanoparticles.
Amine grafted TiO2 (30 mg) was taken in 5 mL of ethanol, 5 mg of HAuCl4 was added. This was followed by the drop-wise addition of sodium borohydride (dissolved in ethanol) to the above solution under mild stirring. Then the solution was centrifuged and washed several times with ethanol.
Characterization
The microstructures of the synthesized samples were characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Technai T20) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples were dispersed in ethanol and dropcast on carbon coated Cu-grids. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired using a field emission SEM, Ultra55 Carl Zeiss. XRD was performed on a Phillips X'pert diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The chemical analysis was performed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra) with a monochromatic source of Al Kα radiation and a graphitic carbon peak at 284.5 eV was used for charge correction.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) as well as with CO stripping voltammetry using a three electrode cell. A platinum foil was used as a counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference. The working electrodes were prepared by drop casting a known concentration of hexane stored supported nanowires on Toray paper. The prepared electrodes were dried overnight at room temperature before electrocatalytic tests. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature in NaOH (1 M) either with or without ethanol as the electrolyte solution. CVs of the electrodes were measured with and without light irradiation. A xenon lamp of 100 W was used as the light source. For CO stripping experiments, the electrolyte solution was saturated with CO (99.99%, CHEMIX gases-Bangalore, India) by bubbling CO for 30 min through the solution. Subsequently, the electrodes were scanned to obtain the corresponding CO stripping CVs. All the experiments were conducted at room temperature and performed by using a potentiostat (PG26250, Techno Science Instrument).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements
EIS measurements were carried out using a three electrode system, CHI 660D electrochemical workstation. The spectra were collected using an AC signal of 10 mV from 100 kHz to 10 MHz.
Photoconductivity measurements
Photocurrent I–V measurements were performed using a Class 3A solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A) comprising a xenon lamp 450 W, with a 1.5 air mass filter and a Keithley (2420 model) source meter. An ITO coated glass with a non-conducting gap (50 μm) was adopted as an electrode. The samples were dispersed in ethanol and dropcast on the gap between ITO contacts.
