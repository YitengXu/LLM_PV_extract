1. Introduction
Global energy demand is continuously growing and is expected to increase by 30% between 2016 and 2040,1 due to the growth of the population and the world economy. Fossil fuels may not meet the increasing energy demands with their current low prices. Moreover, consumption of fossil fuels would inevitably contribute to environmental problems due to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Therefore, a paradigm shift in the direction of utilizing renewable energy for sustainable development should happen. Among the available renewable energy sources, solar energy is believed to be one of the most promising sources, because it is abundant, clean, almost eternal, and easily accessible anywhere during daytime. As much as 3 × 1024 J of solar energy reaches the Earth every year,2 which amounts to more than 1000 times the global energy consumption.3 The most efficient way to harvest solar energy is photovoltaic electricity production, i.e. converting light directly into electricity using solar cells (SCs). The average annual growth rate of the photovoltaic world supply from 1990 to 2015 was reported to be 45.5% making this the fastest growing branch in the renewable energy field.4 As a result, photovoltaic electricity production increased approximately 60 times from 2005 to 2015.5 Therefore, SCs are considered a prominent technology that can supply a significant part of energy in the future.
During the last few decades, remarkable improvements have been achieved in SCs, in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and manufacturing costs. First, all inorganic material-based junction solar cells have yielded high PCEs. Single-crystal Si SCs, multi-crystalline Si SCs, thin film crystalline Si SCs, and thin film amorphous Si:H SCs achieved a PCE of up to 25.8%, 22.3%, 21.2%, and 14.0%, respectively. Moreover, GaAs-based single- and multi-junction SCs achieved PCEs of 28.8 and 38.8%, respectively. Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and CdTe based thin film SCs have achieved PCEs of 22.6 and 22.1%, respectively.6 In the meantime, the so-called emerging photovoltaics, such as organic SCs, dye-sensitized SCs, and quantum dot SCs, have been developed and present several advantages: low-cost materials, low-cost and easy processes, and/or low-temperature processes which would enable mass production via a continuous process. However, grid parity has not yet been achieved by SCs, not even by conventional Si SCs which still represent 90% of the commercial photovoltaic market.7 Therefore, there have been great efforts to develop new SCs with high efficiency, low-cost, and easy processes.
Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using perovskite-structured organic–inorganic halides (e.g. methyl ammonium lead iodide, MALI) as active layer materials have attracted increasing attention due to their unique advantages: low cost and high efficiency.8–11 Presently, PSCs achieve a record PCE of 22.7%,6 with a lab-scale device, which exceeds the performances of other powerful competitors, i.e. multi-crystalline Si, CIGS, and CdTe SCs. Interestingly, such high PCEs of PSCs have been obtained from devices fabricated under mild, near to ambient conditions,12–14 without extremely high temperature or high vacuum which are required for fabricating Si SCs. Such characteristics support the need for developing commercially competitive technology for PSCs. Considering the short history of PSCs (approximately 9 years), the unprecedented improvement both in PCEs and fabrication costs can be expected to continue; hence PSCs have great potential to be leaders in the photovoltaic market.
For commercialization, it is inevitable for PSCs to make great advances due to the following issues: fabrication processes for large area modules, efficiency of modules, stability, functionality, and environmental issues (toxicity). In this study, we summarized the recent progressive research on the commercialization of PSCs. A brief introduction to materials, devices and costs of PSCs is given in Section 2. In Section 3, we described the efforts to develop materials and processes for large area PSC modules. Section 4 describes reports on encapsulation and PSC module design. Subsequently, in Sections 5 and 6, we describe perovskite tandem structures and demonstrate possible environmental issues involving PSCs along with suggestions for solving these problems.
2. Brief introduction to PSCs
2.1. Characteristics of perovskite materials

Fig. 1(a) shows the chart of the world-record efficiencies of PSCs. Lead halide perovskite materials have received lots of attention since their use in a solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (ssDSSC) as a sensitizer in 2012 with 9.7% PCE and long-term stability (∼500 h).15 Thereafter, PSCs have been separated from DSSCs by using perovskite materials as not only the light absorber but also the charge transporter.16–18 PSCs have renewed their record most rapidly among the entire types of SCs, and most recently, PSCs achieved a record PCE of 22.7% in 2017.6 This unprecedented advance in PSCs is attributed first to the excellent optical, electrical, and chemical properties of perovskite materials19–22 and second to the simple processes for device fabrication.23–25

The active layer materials, i.e. the light absorbers, of typical PSCs are lead halides with an ABX3 perovskite crystal structure, where A = CH3NH3+ (methyl ammonium, MA+), CH(NH2)2+ (formamidinium, FA+), or Cs+, B = Pb2+ or Sn2+, and X = I−, Br−, or Cl−. The most representative material is MAPbI3 which has a tetragonal crystal structure (at room temperature) with PbI64− octahedrons at the corners and a large monovalent cation at the centre (Fig. 1(b)). The electronic structure of MAPbI3 calculated utilising density functional theory (DFT) using the crystal structure showed a direct band gap with a high density of states (DOS).26–28 The valence band (VB) consists of the antibonding of the s orbital of the Pb and p orbitals of I, whereas the conduction band (CB) consists of the p orbitals of Pb.29 MAPbI3 has very high light absorption coefficients (>104 cm−1) over the entire visible range above the band gap energy (1.55 eV) (Fig. 1(c)), which is attributed to the direct band gap with high DOS at the CB and VB, in contrast with other light absorbers such as Si (indirect band gap) and GaAs (low DOS at the CB) (Fig. 1(d)).29
By substituting the halide ions, divalent or monovalent cations, the bandgap and the VBM and CBM positions can be easily tuned, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Interestingly, the bandgap increases almost monotonically as the size of the halide ions decreases to reduce the lattice parameter. Due to the tuneable band gap of perovskites, one can easily design and obtain an optimal bandgap for a SC, for example, shifting the bandgap towards the energy deduced from the Shockley–Queisser limit or to ∼1.7 eV which is favourable for making tandem cells with Si SCs.
Perovskite materials are known to have low trap density, high mobility, and hence great diffusion length both for electrons and holes (Fig. 1(e)). It has been reported that MAPbI3 thin films and Cl incorporated MAPbI3 films have ∼100 nm and ∼1 μm diffusion lengths for electrons and holes, respectively.30–32 The mobility of solution-processed MAPbI3 and Cl-incorporated MAPbI3 thin films was reported to be 8 and 11.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are remarkably high for solution-processed materials.30 The carrier mobility could be enhanced more, up to 71 cm2 V−1 s−1, in uniaxially oriented perovskite films.33 Crack-free single crystals of MAPbI3 (MAPbBr3) grown via anti-solvent vapour-assisted crystallization were reported to have 3.3 × 1010 (5.8 × 109) cm−3 carrier concentration, 2.5 (20–60) cm2 V−1 s−1 Hall mobility, and 2–8 (3–17) μm diffusion length.34
In general, high quality perovskite thin films for high efficiency PSCs are fabricated via simple solution processes, such as two-step methods35 and anti-solvent assisted crystallization methods,36 using spin-coating. In fact, the easy solution processes also stem from the material property, the low crystallization temperature, due to the low formation energy <∼0.1 eV of MAPbI3 by the reaction of PbI2 and MAI.37,38 Halide perovskite materials can be synthesized even at room temperature in the form of single crystals via solution processes (Fig. 1(f))34 or bulk powders via mechanochemical routes.39,40 Unless easy crystallization of high quality perovskite crystallites is achieved, where only simple chemicals and cheap, conventional processing equipment are required, the rapid compressed growth of PSCs would not be possible despite the aforementioned excellent optical and electrical properties of perovskite materials.
2.2. Device configurations
The typical energy band configurations and simplified device structures of PSCs are shown in Fig. 2. A typical PSC consists of a perovskite active (light absorbing) layer sandwiched between an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL). If light goes through the ETL, i.e. a transparent conducting layer (TCL) exists in front of the ETL, and this structure is called as the n–i–p structure. The opposite is called the p–i–n structure (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). There are two basic device structures: a mesoscopic and a planar structure. A typical mesoscopic-type PSC has an n–i–p band configuration: TCL/compact ETL/mesoporous ETL/perovskite/HTL/electrode. Most of the world record PCEs are achieved by n–i–p mesoscopic structured PSCs (Fig. 2(c)), because of the balanced electron and hole collection resulting in negligible hysteresis in the I–V curve.8 In this structure, the oxide semiconductor (TiO2, SnO2 or ZnO) is used as the ETL layer, and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) or poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) is used as the HTL layer. The planar-type PSCs are divided into two band configurations: n–i–p planar and p–i–n planar (Fig. 2(d) and (e)). These planar-types are possible because of the excellent ambipolar diffusion of carriers in perovskite materials. The planar configurations can offer the advantages of simplified device structures and convenient fabrication procedures. The n–i–p planar type PSCs usually adopt the same materials as the n–i–p mesoscopic devices for the ETL and HTL. In this type, modification of the interface between perovskite and the ETL significantly affects the charge transport and recombination properties and hence the hysteresis of the I–V curve.12,23,44 On the other hand, the p–i–n planar type usually shows negligible hysteresis.44 However, this type adopts phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), N-(3,4-methylenedioxybenzoyl)piperidine (BCP) or C60 (buckminsterfullerene) as the ETL and NiOx or PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, and the stability/durability of the PSCs is relatively low compared to those of the other types, because of the instability of organic materials.

2.3. Cost of PSC modules
Understanding the cost of photovoltaics (PVs) is as important as increasing their efficiency due to the energy payback time (EPT), related to manufacturing costs, which act as a huge barrier to the commercialization of PVs.45 For PSCs, the core material, perovskite, is expected to be manufactured at a low price, but no other materials and processes were standardized for commercial manufacturing. While thin film solar cell technologies using GaAs, CdTe, and CIGS have more than 20% efficiency46 and high stability, their commercial development has not been enabled by EPT for more than a year.47 Therefore, researching the use of low-cost materials and practical processes is needed to commercialize PSCs from research to maturity.
For the price estimation and pricing strategy of PSC modules, we have first analysed the fabrication cost of glass/F-doped SnO2 (FTO)/c-TiO2/mpTiO2/[CsPbI3]0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.95/spiro-MeOTAD/Au design (type A) which is widely used, efficient and is depicted in Fig. 3(a). The module pricing was based on a 1 m2 PSC module size. The materials and processes used for the price estimation in Fig. 3 were, in order from bottom to top, (1) commercialized glass-FTO/laser patterning and ultrasonic cleaning for TCO, (2) titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in IPA solvent/spin coating and sintering for c-TiO2, (3) diluted mp-TiO2 paste/screen printing and sintering for mp-TiO2, (4) 1.3 M CsFAMAPbIBr precursor in DMF-DMSO mixture solvent/spin coating and sintering, (5) spiro-MeOTAD in chlorobenzene/spin coating, (6) Au/thermal evaporation, and (7) PET and adhesive/laminating for encapsulation. The electricity consumption for each process in Fig. 3(b) was retrieved from the research of Ibn-Mohammed et al.48 and the raw material costs and usage were calculated in the laboratory; the results are shown in Fig. 3(c). The calculated electricity cost and material price indicate that purchasing and preparing the glass/FTO substrate (44% of the total material cost and 46% of electricity consumption) and purchasing Au and the vacuum deposition (52% of total material cost and 28.7% of electricity consumption) represent the largest percentage of the module fabrication cost. Moreover, the price of the HTL, spiro-MeOTAD (2% of the total material cost), is not negligible. If the type A device structured PSCs, which have the highest PCE, were commercialized, the efficiency of the module could be acceptable, but the cost would still be more expensive than that of silicon solar cells.

Therefore, various module structures of PSCs excluding the expensive materials and processes (e.g. noble metals and vacuum deposition) are actively studied. One approach utilizes an inverted structure (p–i–n structure) using Al electrodes (type B PSCs) as shown in Fig. 4(a). According to the cost analysis data of PSCs reported by Cai, et al., in type B PSCs, the percentage of the material cost for the active area is only 14% of the total material cost as shown in Fig. 4(c) (active area includes the perovskite layer, ETL, HTL, and Al electrode).51 Even though the price per active area (2.21 US$ per m2) is still high since PCBM and PEDOT:PSS are expensive, considering that the proportion of Au in type A PSCs was ∼95% of the active area cost, the use of an alternative metal electrode (Al) can be expected to reduce the total cost. Another structure, type C in Fig. 4(b), uses a carbon electrode and does not require an expensive charge transport layer such as spiro-MeOTAD or PEDOT:PSS. For type C, the material cost for 1 m2 PSC module production was greatly reduced to 12.18 US$ per m2 (Fig. 4(d)). Assuming the same price for the glass/FTO substrate, the total material cost is 15.47 US$ per m2 for type B (Fig. 4(a)) and 20.46 US$ per m2 for type A (Fig. 3(a)).

However, unit price calculations for SC devices should take into consideration the output value. The current reported data for small size type B and C PSCs obtained using continuous processes indicate ∼20 and ∼15% PCE, respectively. Assuming that the unit cell has a 90% geometric fill factor for a 1 m2 module area, the output watt from the module is 180 W m−2 (type B) and 135 W m−2 (type C), respectively. If these values are reflected in the material value, the material cost per W of the device with high efficiency becomes lower even if the manufacturing costs are high: 0.085 and 0.090 US$ per W, respectively.
We looked at various studies applicable to perovskite modules based on processes, material cost, and device structure efficiency. Furthermore, we examined the results which are highly applicable to PSC modules for enhancing the stability of perovskite materials and PSC modules, which is regarded as the weakest point. In addition, issues related to various applications of perovskite modules and their environmental problems will be discussed below.
3. Materials and methods for large area and continuous processes
This section will investigate what research is conducted and needed to replace (or accompany) Si SCs with PSCs. Therefore, we identified reported research that can be applied to large area, continuously processed PSC modules.
As seen below, despite the great PCE of PSCs, other parts are still a little bit insufficient for commercial use. Most reports of PSCs were obtained using spin-coating, high-temperature (>400 °C) processes, rigid substrates, and small active areas; therefore, there is an urgency for demonstrating the need for large-scale and continuous fabrication of PSCs. We divided the components for the modularization of PSCs into five parts, taking into consideration the key points mentioned in Fig. 5: (1) flexible transparent conductive substrate, (2) first charge transport layer, (3) perovskite layer, (4) second counter charge transport layer and top electrode, and (5) encapsulation and module design. Basically, when looking at the modularization technology, we have selected the research that can be applied to flexible substrates (low-temperature process <150 °C), and scalable- and continuous-processes. We also mentioned the available technologies to enhance the device stability in each layer.

3.1. Flexible transparent conductive substrate
The most easily accessible flexible conductive substrate (FCS) for commercial use is a transparent conductive oxide (TCO)-coated plastic substrate. A polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)/Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) substrate was used for the first reported flexible PSC, and it is still the most widely used FCS ever.52 However, the brittle nature of ceramic can cause fracture or even exfoliation of ITO during the roll-to-roll (R2R) process and/or during the usage of the final device. There have been reports that in the PEN/ITO based flexible PSCs, deterioration of the device efficiency due to ITO exfoliation occurs, when the device is deformed with the bending radius R (i.e. a reciprocal of curvature) less than 4 mm.53,54 Therefore, we discuss the potential alternative FCSs to PEN/ITO and their performance in PSCs. Alternative FCSs should have high mechanical flexibility, high optical transparency, and high electrical conductivity. Given these requirements and the purpose of commercialization, carbon- and metal-nanomaterial-based TCLs seem to be good for FCSs.55
Carbon-based FCSs have been considered next generation FCSs due to their remarkable properties: transparency, conductivity, and flexibility. Several studies using single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and graphene have been reported (Table 1). PSCs based on SWNT-, and graphene bottom electrodes show higher mechanical durability than PEN/ITO based PSCs, but their efficiency is significantly lower compared to that of PEN/ITO. Because both SWNT and graphene-based substrates usually have several hundred Ω sq−1 of sheet resistance (Rsheet), these problems may directly reflect on the PCE of PSCs. Although Jung et al.59 demonstrated a PCE of over 16% using a PET/graphene FCS (Fig. 6(a)), it should be noted that the active area of this device is 1.77 mm2. That is, the decrease of device efficiency due to the high Rsheet will play a larger role as the active area increases. This will be a significant disadvantage to the modularization of PSCs, even though the carbon based-FCS has higher mechanical durability compared to the PEN/ITO FCS (Fig. 6(b)). When looking at studies on high-quality carbon nanomaterial films alone, SWNT FCSs show 30 Ω sq−1 sheet resistance (Rsheet) and 90% transmittance.64 However, only a small percentage of SWNT powder can be efficiently used due to the twining of carbon nanotubes during the CVD process, which is the reason behind the increasing fabrication cost. Graphene-hybrid electrodes using ITO or metal grids were actively developed to reduce Rsheet. Qiu et al. reported that graphene-metal grids/PET films have 18 Ω sq−1Rsheet and 80% transmittance,65 and Deng et al. reported that the fully R2R processed Cu nanowires (NWs)/graphene hybrid FCS has 8 Ω sq−1Rsheet and 94% transmittance.66 However, these FCSs have not been applied to PSCs yet.

A metal nanomaterial-based FCS is the strongest alternative FCS owing to its high electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility. Especially, a network of metal NWs (e.g. AgNWs and CuNWs) has been used to enhance optical transparency because a continuous metal thin film would not meet the high transmittance required for the TCL. R2R processed AgNW FCSs have been explored by many researchers67–69 and can obtain an Rsheet of 5–94 Ω sq−1 and 85–92% transmittance. However, there are several problems when using AgNWs, and especially, chemical stability is a new hurdle for the interface of AgNWs/perovskite materials. When perovskite was deposited on the AgNW bottom electrode, AgNWs reacted with the halide ion in the perovskite materials, and transformed into Ag-halide.70 Thus, research on AgNW-based PSCs is focused on the stability of AgNWs and the interface of AgNWs/perovskite materials. As can be seen in Table 1, polymers (tartaric-acid-modified chitosan, PH1000), graphene oxide, or metal oxides (AZO and ITO) have been used to improve the chemical or thermal stability of PSCs. The PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000 FCS (Fig. 6(c)) shows an Rsheet of 3 Ω sq−1 and 85% transmittance. Moreover, its PSC device shows a PCE of ∼ 14% (active area ∼ 0.1 cm2, typical small device measurement area), enhanced thermal stability (comparable to that of the PEN/ITO substrate), and excellent mechanical flexibility (∼95% of the initial PCE value after being bent 5000 times at 5 mm bending radius Fig. 6(d)). However, if additional processes are employed to use AgNW electrodes, the total material cost is difficult to be reduced although the mechanical strength can be maintained.
Researchers have encountered difficulties in finding alternative FCSs for PSC modules so far. However, according to reports from ‘Tough Display Research”, the ITO replacement market will reach 13 billion dollars by 2023, and ITO will be the minor transparent conductive material for the touch panel industry.71 In terms of current technology and marketization, metal nanomaterial based-FCSs are considered to be the leading substrates for PSC modules due to the fact that carbon nanomaterial based FCSs still need enhancement of their electrical properties and commercialization of the material itself.
3.2. First charge transport layer
In PSCs, the first charge transport layer (1-CTL) is used as an electron or a hole transport layer (ETL or HTL) in n–i–p or p–i–n type devices, respectively. The ETL (HTL) needs a high electron (hole) mobility and an appropriate conduction (valence) band level with the perovskite layer. Furthermore, both layers require high transmittance to allow light to enter the perovskite material. It is well known that the charge accumulation between the 1-CTL and perovskite material can induce hysteresis, and chemical reactions at the interface can affect the stability of PSCs.72,73 Thus, efforts to deposit the 1-CTL using various materials and coating methods have continued to improve the efficiency, reliability, and stability of these devices.74,75 For example, an n-type ZnO layer was the first low-temperature (low-T) processed 1-CTL applied to flexible PSCs. This has a PCE higher than 10%.52 It should be noted that ZnO was one of the most actively studied 1-CTL materials in the early stage of PSCs because it has high electron mobility and can be easily deposited via low-temperature solution processes, such as chemical bath deposition and electrodeposition.76,77 However, research on ZnO has become stagnant due to the low chemical stability between ZnO and perovskite which caused irreversible decomposition of perovskite materials. Fortunately, there are many other materials and techniques for the low-T-processed 1-CTL that can be applied to PSC modules as well as DSSCs and OPVs.78,79 Therefore, in this section, we will look at studies that can be applied to the PSC module fabrication process and materials that can be applied to low-T 1-CTL techniques (Table 2).

Titanium dioxide is commonly used as the 1-CTL in n–i–p PSC modules. In order to produce a dense compact-TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer, high-T annealing (>400 °C) is required to get a highly crystalline and conformal dense layer. However, since high-T treatment cannot be used for FCSs, researchers developed a technique designed to replace the heat treatment. Nicolay et al. have described a R2R processable atmospheric PECVD to fabricate a large, continuous TiO2−x ETL (Fig. 7(a)).80 When applied to PSCs, it indicated the possibility of an atmospheric R2R PECVD process as modularization, showing that its efficiency was similar to that of PSCs using vacuum sputtered TiOx. As an alternative to the high-T process for TiO2, Ko et al. developed an UV-assisted solution process to prepare highly crystalline Nb-doped TiO2 (<50 °C).53 The Nb-Doped TiO2 ETL-employed PSC shows improved photovoltaic performance (19.75% and 16.01% PCE with rigid and flexible substrates, respectively). Moreover, enhancing the electron extraction properties and the downward shift of the conduction band of TiO2 by Nb doping reduced the hysteresis problem, which is referred to as the chronic problem of the TiO2 ETL. Han et al. fabricated meso-TiO2 by screen printing for fully printable PSCs (Fig. 7(b)).81 Although there are many studies for low-T or continuously processed TiO2, PSCs based on the TiO2 ETL suffer from UV light instability due to the photocatalytic effect of TiO2. Therefore, alternative metal oxides have been studied for the low-T-processed 1-ETL.

You et al. have reported low-T solution processed SnO2 ETLs.82 SnO2 is regarded as one of the best alternative ETLs to TiO2, due to its large band gap (∼3.8 eV), its electron mobility (∼1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1) which is two orders higher than that of TiO2, and its proper conduction band edge (4.31 eV). Therefore, SnO2 ETL-based PSCs show negligible I–V hysteresis, even without any interfacial treatment. Seok et al. developed ternary oxide (Zn2SnO4 (ref. 83) and BaSnO3 (ref. 86) nanoparticles)-based ETLs. In the study based on BaSnO3 ETLs (Fig. 7(c)), researchers showed that replacing TiO2 with BaSnO3 contributes not only to the high efficiency but also to the light stability of the device (retaining 93% of the initial PCE after 1000 h of one sun illumination, Fig. 7(d)). Various p-type materials (e.g. NiOx and CuCrO2) were also converted to nanoparticle precursors and used to produce 1-CTLs at low temperatures.84,85 The metal oxide nanoparticle based 1-CTLs described in this paragraph were fabricated by spin coating. However, spray or printing techniques for applying dispersed nanoparticles to large-area flexible substrates on the conveyor belt have already been developed, and they are expected to be easily applied to PSC modules.
Various continuously processed (e.g. spray coating, doctor blade, and roll coating) PEDOT:PSS HTLs are also being developed for p–i–n PSC module fabrication.88–90 However, the use of strongly acidic PEDOT:PSS makes it difficult to use ITO electrodes due to the corrosion. The water vulnerability of PEDOT:PSS may further decrease the moisture stability of PSC devices. Therefore, to use PEDOT:PSS as the 1-CTL in PSC modules, more studies on alternatives to ITO or technologies to reinforce the interface barrier to protect ITO electrodes are needed.
3.3. Perovskite layer
The solution process is the most commonly used method for coating perovskite layers on 1-CTL films. Most such processes use spin coating. However, spin coating cannot be used in large-scale manufacturing lines due to the slow process time, non-continuous process, and large amount of precursor waste. Therefore, the capability of R2R printing is very important for its commercialization (Table 3).

Spray coating is one of the faster solution processes and widely used techniques, and it dominates the process for scalable perovskite materials, generating high quality films. Lidzey et al. first reported inverted PSCs, showing 11.1% PCE, using a spray coated CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer by controlling the substrate temperature.91 This report shows the possibility of spray coating for large scale deposition of perovskite materials and the related research. However, liquid atomization during spray coating due to the randomly sprayed droplets with different sizes results in irregular nucleation sites. Therefore, several studies have been conducted to solve these problems. Poortmans et al. controlled the composition (PbAc2, PbCl2 or their combination) and concentration of perovskite precursors for ultrasonic spray coating,94 resulting in 13.7% PCE under optimized conditions. Ding et al. reported large grain perovskite fabrication techniques using hot-casting methods.93 When the perovskite solution was sprayed onto heated-TiO2 (∼100 °C, over 50% humidity), pin-hole free perovskite films with 2–3 μm sized grains were formed. The two-step spray coating method has the advantage of obtaining dense and smooth perovskite films. Liu et al. have sprayed out cation-halide solutions (MAI and FAI) on prepared PbI2 films. They reported that high-quality perovskite thin films could be obtained by causing a solid/mist interfacial reaction at a controlled reaction temperature,96,97 achieving 14.9% PCE. Moreover, a study to control the perovskite morphology using electric field-assisted spray coating was also conducted by Komarala et al., showing various approaches of the two-step process.95 Meng et al. developed a technique to deposit centimetre-sized, uniform and smooth perovskite films using a two-step spray coating method as shown in Fig. 8(a).98 First, PbI2 dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was sprayed out onto the FTO substrate, and subsequently MAI was sprayed to obtain high quality perovskite thin films (Fig. 8(b)). This method resulted in a relatively high PCE of 16.03% with 0.01 cm2 active area, and even for a large active area device, 13.09% PCE was achieved with 1 cm2 active area, in Fig. 8(c).

The doctor blade method is a simple and inexpensive process for large area printing. Doctor blading has been widely used to fabricate OPVs,107 as it can be easily applied to inverted PSCs, which have similar device structures and charge transport materials. There have been several research studies on the fabrication of perovskite layers using doctor blading. A fully doctor blade-processed inverted-type PSC was demonstrated with a relatively high PCE of 10.44% (Fig. 8(d)).89 Huang et al. fabricated a perovskite thin film using a one-step blading process and produced an inverted device,99 yielding 15.1% PCE. This contrasts with the fact that the PCEs of the PSCs fabricated using the spray or inkjet methods at that time (2015) were much lower (<10%) than those of the spin coating-based PSCs.
Although a low-T annealing process at less than 100–150 °C is required to form perovskite films, removing these heat treatments and finding more efficient methods for R2R processes can be useful for commercialization. Eslamian et al. found that the perovskite film immersed in diethyl ether (low boiling point and can extract the anti-solvent from the wet perovskite film) no longer required further heat treatment.100 They removed the anti-solvent from the intermediate perovskite phase using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and acetonitrile, followed by ultrasonic vibration treatment of the substrate to achieve an annealing-free perovskite layer as depicted in Fig. 9(a). The vibration treatment homogenized and increased the number of nucleation sites and improved the contact between perovskite and the 1-CTL layer. A PSC fabricated by this method exhibited a sufficiently high efficiency (15.2%).108 Abate et al. introduced flash infrared (IR) annealing to replace heat treatment.101 When the perovskite coated FTO/glass substrate was irradiated using IR radiation, the temperature of FTO increased to ∼480 °C to rapidly evaporate the solvent (Fig. 9(b)). On the other hand, the temperature of the perovskite layer was kept below 80 °C to help the growth of perovskite crystals (Fig. 9(b) and (c)). Using this technology, Abate et al. fabricated a PSC with a high PCE (19%) (Fig. 9(d))and further demonstrated the applicability of the flash IR treatment to commercialization, through the fabrication of a large area (100 cm2) perovskite thin film on a PET/ITO substrate.

In addition, it is noteworthy that MA gas treatment on the perovskite film improved its crystalline quality, uniformity, and roughness.109 A poor uniformity of the perovskite film due to non-uniform evaporation of the precursor solvent may greatly affect the device efficiency and reliability. According to Cui et al., the short-time perovskite solid – MA gas reaction forms a CH3NH3PbI3−xCH3NH2 intermediate liquid phase, which is followed by degassing of MA, resulting in a high-quality MAPbI3 film.102 Recently, they have reported 21.25% PCE for PSCs based on the MA gas treatment, demonstrating the feasibility of this technology.103 The MA gas post-treatment process is expected to be suitable for large area and continuous processes, because it is simple and takes a short time.
Research on improving the stability of the perovskite layer using the modularization technology is rare. However, studies on new perovskite materials such as RbCsFAMA-PbI3,104 (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1,105 and (HOOC(CH2)4NH3)2PbI4/CH3NH3PbI3,106 which are much more stable to light illumination, temperature and humidity compared to MAPbI3 and CsFAMAPbI3, are in progress. Therefore, if a stable perovskite can be applied to a large-area coating technique, the module stability will also be improved.
3.4. Second charge transport layer and top electrode
The same materials and methods applied to the 1-CTL can be used for the 2-CTL. However, there is one important, additional point to be considered, different from the case of the 1-CTL. The 2-CTL should be coated on a perovskite layer which has low stability in polar solvents.110 If a precursor of the 2-CTL contains a polar solvent, it will decompose the perovskite material immediately during coating of the 2-CTL. Therefore, this is a delicate process, and the materials that can be used are limited. There are not many reports related to large-area processes although there are many material candidates for the 2-CTL (Table 4).

PCBM, which is commonly used for inverted PSCs as an n-type ETL material, is also suitable for large area 2-CTLs due to its precursor solvent: chlorobenzene. PCBM has been adapted to many large-scale processes such as spray coating, doctor blading, roll coating and slot-die. Doctor blading and spray coating showed the possibility for large area processes, exhibiting a high efficiency of ∼10% (as shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b)). However, the quasi-Fermi level of PCBM has a high energy mismatch with the work function of Al or Ag electrodes, and the small bandgap energy of PCBM cannot block holes efficiently. Therefore, an additional interlayer between PCBM and the metal electrode is required, which may not be desirable for commercialization.

Copper thiocyanate (CuSCN), an inorganic p-type material, has been coated on the perovskite layer using doctor blade111 and spray coating.112 Ito et al. selected CuSCN as a HTL material since it has the advantages of low-cost, high chemical stability, and high hole mobility.111 Furthermore, CuSCN was a suitable material for adopting the doctor blade method, as demonstrated by a high PCE of ∼ 12.3% of the PSC based on doctor-blade-processed CuSCN.111 Lee et al. produced PSCs using spray-coated CuSCN for the R2R process, as shown in Fig. 10(c) and (d).112 They used propyl sulphide as a solvent of CuSCN to avoid the decomposition of perovskite, resulting in a high PCE of over 17% for the PSC. The most appropriate p-type inorganic material employed in PSCs is NiOx due to its good stability and hole extraction properties. There have been several processes for making NiOx layers, such as vacuum processes (sputtering,116 pulsed laser deposition,117 and atomic layer deposition118) or solution processes followed by high-T annealing (>300 °C);119 all of these methods are inadequate for commercializing the 2-CTL. Recently, Li et al. have solved this problem by incorporating NiO into the carbon paste for screen printing.114 When NiO nanoparticles are incorporated into the carbon electrode, they contributed to enhancing the hole extraction properties in carbon electrode-based PSCs and increased their PCE to 13.26%.
As top electrodes, Ag and carbon materials were mainly used for modularization. Carbon electrodes will be discussed later (Section 3.5) due to their widespread use in completely continuously processed PSCs. Krebs et al. reported ‘solvent-less UV- or heat-curable Ag ink’ (Fig. 10(e)).113 However, the PCE of the devices were relatively low, and the Ag electrode fell off easily during the adhesion test using sticky tape as shown in Fig. 10(g). This result contrasts with the successful printing of the Ag electrode using the UV curable Ag ink in OPVs,120 suggesting that the electrode process needs to be optimized for fabricating the perovskite module. Ma et al. reported an inkjet-printed AgNW top electrode for inverted PSCs (PCE ∼ 14.17%).115 To prevent the work function mismatch between PCBM and Ag, and to reduce chemical corrosion of AgNWs by the halogen anion, polyethylenimine (PEI) was inserted at the PCBM/AgNW interface. PEI improved the stability of the PSC device by preventing chemical corrosion and helped to densely and uniformly coat AgNWs.
3.5. Carbon-based top electrodes for HTL-free printable PSCs
Carbon electrode-based PSCs (CePSCs) with a monolithic structure are most actively used for fully printable PSCs and module structure research.121–125 CePSCs have the double mesoporous layer (1-CTL and scaffold layer for perovskite) and carbon electrode formed by screen printing, and the perovskite precursor is infiltrated into the mesoporous layer to complete fabrication. The CePSC shows intensive stability since it does not have a HTL layer which in general is the most unstable part in a PSC. In addition, the densely formed perovskite in the porous layer is less decomposed by moisture. Moreover, its fabrication cost is relatively low due to the use of a carbon electrode (solution process) instead of metal (vacuum process). In 2014, Han et al. introduced the first fully printable CePSC using (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 materials.121 The fabricated device showed 12.8% PCE and higher stability (over 1000 h) due to the lower defect concentrations of mixed-cation perovskite materials. CePSC solar cells have been developed in various ways through perovskite formations using inkjet processes (Fig. 11(a) and (b)), and interfacial control studies while maintaining printing technology for monolithic structures. In recent years, it has attained an important place in a highly efficient and stable module structure (Fig. 11(c) and (d)), such as producing modules with 49 cm2 or more than 70 cm2 and with an efficiency higher than 10%.126 The modules also show good stability under continuous illumination for over 1000 h in the local outdoor environment for one month and in the dark for over one year (Table 5).

Except for the CePSCs, metal electrode-based PSCs have been fabricated using various large-scale processes such as doctor blading,89 spray coating,88 slot die87 and roll coating90 methods, but it was difficult to find reports on module production. Also, most of the research studies still use vacuum processes for top electrode deposition. However, recently, Zhu et al. have reported 15.14% PCE for PSC modules with the normal n–i–p structure (glass/FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au), showing the possibility of various structural approaches for PSC module fabrication.127
4. Encapsulation and module design
Moisture, oxygen, UV light, heat, and their combination can negatively affect the lifetime of perovskite materials and their devices at any time. From the reports, when a PSC is placed under ∼55% humidity conditions, its efficiency decreased to half after 1–2 days.17 In a high humidity atmosphere (over 90%), the unsealed device reached the end of its life after one hour.128 Commercialized PSCs must be operated for long periods under extreme conditions such as 85 °C and 85% humidity with light soaking. To meet the IEC 61646 standard,129 the PSCs in such an environment should maintain 90% of their initial PCEs for over 1000 h. One possible way to improve the stability of PSCs is exploring new materials. For example, n-type BaSnO3 alternating TiO2 was reported to enhance the UV stability of PSCs, and Cs-doped perovskites and 2D/3D-mixed perovskites enhance their stability.86,106 However, such methods, reported so far, could not improve their stability to a level required for commercialization. To prevent the attack of heavy rain and infiltrating oxygen in a harsh environment, encapsulation has been believed to be the best way to guarantee the stability of PSC modules.
Ito et al. reported that a good thermal stability (∼100 °C, at 70–80% relative humidity) of carbon electrode-based HTL-free PSCs can be achieved through encapsulation using UV-curing glue and glass plates, which had been already developed for DSSCs (3035B Three Bond Holdings Co., Ltd) (Fig. 12(a)).130 Interestingly side-sealed encapsulation rather than over-sealing is more effective against thermal stress (Fig. 12(b)). They explained that even if UV-curing glue effectively blocks moisture, direct attachment of glue on the carbon electrode is not effective in enduring thermal stress. Kim et al. examined thermal stability using encapsulated PSCs, based on a common n–i–p type, as seen in Fig. 12(c) and (d).131 In this study, the PSCs were encapsulated with normal cover glasses using a UV curable edge-sealant which has been broadly used for encapsulating organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). As in the above reports, we found excellent encapsulation materials and processes for PSC modules from the field of DSSCs, OPVs and OLEDs. Even in the OPV field, many encapsulation techniques have been reported that can be easily applied and withstand outdoor stability testing for over 100 years.132,133

However, it has been confirmed that encapsulation technologies can't effectively prevent the problems occurring inside the device, such as thermal stress. Encapsulation didn't protect PSCs against thermal degradation at over 100 °C. Kim et al. confirmed that this phenomenon was caused by the phase transition of MAPbI3 at 100 °C, from a tetragonal to a cubic structure. Moreover, decomposition of MAPbI3 occurred as the direction of the internal C–N bond was re-arranged. In this regard, one interesting result was reported by Han et al. (Fig. 12(e)), which might be more practical study for the encapsulated PSC modules, meaning of such high-temperature stability may be blurred.126 They tested outdoor stability using an encapsulated PSC module which was sealed with glass and Pattex silicon. The encapsulated module was tested for a month at an average temperature of 30 °C and an average humidity of 80%. The device maintained its initial efficiency (Fig. 12(f)), because it had not been frequently placed at high-temperatures over 100 °C.
The number and interconnection of unit cells inside the large-area module and the variation of the module efficiency due to sheet and shunt resistances are indispensable for device fabrication. Therefore, for module production, laser-scribing techniques related to patterning the module segment, reducing the dead area and optimizing the aperture area efficiency, were reported. Laser scribing was first applied to PSCs in 2014. At that time, c-TiO2 was easily removed using a Nd:YVO4 laser, while the perovskite and other layers were removed using a solution.135 Therefore, the aperture ratio (AR, active area/dead area in the module design) was only 67%. Based on the studies reported by Razza et al., perovskite/HTL was etched using a double CO2 and Nd:YVO3 laser and a lift off method, and the AR was increased to 73% with 9% of module PCE.136 Afterwards, Moon et al. reported a fully laser patterned PSC module design, with 84% AR and 6.6% module PCE.137 Recently, a report about a laser scribing design and process with an AR of 95% in a 5 × 5 cm mini module using a fine laser condition adjustment has been published.138 Furthermore, it has been reported that if a thin 1-CTL layer (10 nm or less) forms, the etching process for the 1-CTL layer in the P2 region is negligible. This is because FTO/TiO2/Au makes ohmic contact even if the ultra-thin TiO2 and thin 1-CTL remain in the P2 region.127 Applying these additional research results to previous results will allow us to design a PSC module with a higher geometric fill factor.
Heben et al. performed a techno economic analysis of PSCs using low-cost materials and processes.134 They selected printable inorganic charge transport layers and a sputtered Al electrode depicted in Fig. 13(b). When the costs of fabricating and maintaining devices with R2R processes and structures in Fig. 13(a) and (b) were estimated, the direct manufacturing cost was $31.7 per m2 and the minimum sustainable price was $0.41 per Wp for the 16% PCE module (Fig. 13(c)). In addition, based on these calculations, researchers concluded that ‘The levelized cost of energy of PSCs is estimated to be 5.82 cent per kW per h in Wichita, Kansas, if a system lifetime of 30 years can be achieved’, considering Annual Energy Outlook 2017 (ref. 139) which reported that the cost of photovoltaic technologies was 8.50–14.30 cent per kW per h using the levelized cost and levelized avoided cost of new generation resources. The full potential of perovskite PV technology will be unlocked. If the numerous studies currently being conducted for researching higher PCE modules, cheaper materials and optimized processes were applied to Heben's calculations and if the throughput of the process could increase (Fig. 13(d)), the commercialization of the PSC module would not be far away.

5. Tandem structures
Tandem SCs have been proven to be an effective way to further enhance the efficiency of SCs. However, to fabricate a tandem device with two or more photovoltaics, the bandgap matching requirements, for absorbing a wide wavelength range, must be met. The reason many researchers are interested in the perovskite-tandem device is that perovskite has an easily tuneable bandgap. MAPbIxBr3−x, which are widely used, have a bandgap of 1.5–1.7 eV, and they can work as a top cell for perovskite–Si tandem, perovskite–CIGS tandem, perovskite–organic tandem, and perovskite–perovskite tandem devices.149
Silicon SCs with ∼1.1 eV bandgap are ideal bottom cells for PSCs, which have 1.5–2.1 eV bandgap for an optical configuration.150 Furthermore, the manufacturing system of Si SCs has already been perfected. Therefore, if a successful solution process for 1-CTL/perovskite/2-CTL is developed, perovskite/Si tandem devices can be manufactured soon. Four-terminal tandem devices can also be easily manufactured if the metal electrode used in the perovskite SC can be replaced with another semi-transparent electrode. If the light transmitted through perovskite is not absorbed by the metal electrode, it can be transferred to the Si bottom cell, supplying sufficient energy to drive the Si device. For example, McGehee used AgNWs with a transmittance of 77% at 800 nm as the top electrode, fabricated a device with 12% PCE, and mounted it on an 11.4% Si SC, producing a four-terminal device with 17.0% PCE.151 In recent years, 25.2% efficiency has been reported for the four-terminal tandem featuring a rear-side textured bottom cell to increase its near-infrared spectral response.144 It should be noted that comparing two-terminal and four-terminal tandems is tricky given the current matching and process compatibility within two devices, but the efficiency has reached 23.6% already.143 Its structure was a simply IR-tuned Si heterojunction cell/CsFA mixed perovskite cell, where SnO2 was deposited by ALD to minimize the ITO sputtering damage. It should also be noted that this device withstands the 85 °C/85% humidity tests for 1000 h. If expensive vacuum deposition such as sputtering is eliminated and the tunnelling junction and top electrode are deposited by the solution process, the perovskite/Si tandem will become an important form of commercialization.
As shown in Fig. 14, the efficiency of the perovskite tandem devices is greatly increased for a brief time. From optical analysis, the perovskite tandem device has further potential for approaching ∼30% PCE. The delicate bandgap tuning of perovskite materials for optoelectronic properties, transparent contacts and interlayers for efficient charge transport and low parasitic absorption, enhancing the stability of perovskite, should be key issues for the efficiency of the tandem device.

6. Environmental concerns
6.1. Lead-related concerns
Despite the aforementioned intensive and extensive efforts and advances in commercializing PSCs, there are still several environmental concerns. The main concern for potential customers is lead toxicity. High efficiency PSCs are based on Pb2+ containing perovskite materials (i.e. APbX3, where A is a monovalent cation and X is a monovalent halogen anion). Lead is a potent neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, damaging the human nervous and reproductive systems and causing blood disorders.152 Given that Pb-based perovskite materials are easily decomposed by water to release PbI2 which has a relatively high water solubility (ksp = 9.8 × 10−9),153,154 lead contamination of soil, rivers and groundwater can occur when installed PSC modules get damaged by mechanical fracture and chemical weathering.
Fortunately, the total amount of Pb in a PSC module is expected to be relatively small. Considering that the thickness of the perovskite active layer is usually ∼400 nm, a 1 m2 PSC module contains less than 0.4 g of Pb which is less than 1/50 of the Pb amount for soldering commercial Si SC modules of equivalent area.155 Moreover, it is estimated that potential Pb emission from PSC modules would be lower than that from coal power plants.154,156 Even assuming a worst-case scenario such as the catastrophic failure of PSC modules and the leaking out of all of the Pb ions from the module in the soil by rain, the lead concentration in the first cm of the ground would increase only by ∼70 ppm. Such a level of Pb is categorized as “low levels of contamination (<400 ppm)”, compared to Pb levels in urban areas (50–200 ppm).157 The contaminated soil layer could be removed and recovered,158 because Pb has the tendency to be strongly adsorbed on many types of soil particles to remain concentrated in the top layer.154 Different from such a worst-case scenario, in typical cases of replacing PSC devices after their end-of-design life, the perovskite layer can be recovered via a simple dissolving process without leaking Pb into the environment.110
For commercialization of PSCs, however, Pb is still a somewhat latent issue because of multiple regulations worldwide.153 For example, the European Union strongly regulates the use of Pb in industry under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS). RoHS restricts the Pb content in consumer products to less than 0.1% in homogeneous materials, while installed SC panels are exempt from this rule.159 This means that, integrated PSCs in electronic (portable) devices and individual PSC modules are still under the restriction of RoHS, which would limit PSCs from broad, general purpose utilization. Therefore, lots of efforts have been made to develop lead-free active materials (light-absorber) for PSCs.
ABX3 perovskite structured active materials have large variability in combining the A, B, and X sites. To substitute Pb2+ while maintaining the ABX3 perovskite structure, the ionic radii of the A, B, and X site ions should harmonize to meet the Goldschmidt's tolerance factor and octahedral factor.163,164 However, the crystal structure does not guarantee an excellent PSC performance. Many divalent cations such as alkaline earth metals,165,166 transition metals167,168 and group 14 elements (Sn and Ge)169–173 have been considered by experiments as well as computational simulations. Furthermore, other various stoichiometric halide compounds such as A2B + B3 + X6, A2BX6, and A3B2X9 have been intensively reported. Representative compositions are Cs2InAgCl6 (Fmm),160 Cs2SnI6 (Fmm),161 and MA3Bi2I9 (P63/mmc),162 as shown in Fig. 15. Among the candidates, ASnX3 absorbers show the most promising SC performances. So far, however, all the Sn-based PSCs show much lower PCEs (<10%) than the Pb-based PSCs. Furthermore, other lead-free absorbers, such as Bi, Sb, Ge, and Cu-based perovskites, led to ≤1% PCE. In fact, the current structure and materials of PSCs have been optimized for lead halide absorbers, especially (MA-FA)Pb(I–Br)3; therefore it would be very difficult to meet the requirements – appropriate conduction/valence band edge levels compared with those of conventional ETLs and HTLs, thin film processes, and device structures – even if the candidates have good ranges of band gap, absorption coefficients, charge mobility, and stability. There are still numerous compositions, processes, and device structures which remain unexplored, and hence the research to find alternatives is expected to continue.

6.2. Solvent concerns
There have been several effective solution processes for fabricating perovskite thin films.8,174 Currently, the most heavily adopted solution process for high efficiency PSC fabrication is an anti-solvent assisted crystallization method.8 This method generally uses toxic solvents as anti-solvents (toluene, chlorobenzene, diethyl ether, etc.), and for forming HTLs or ETLs (1-butanol, chlorobenzene, etc.). To avoid the use of such toxic solvents, recently, research on seeking less toxic, “green” solvents has been started. There are several green solvents reported (i) for anti-solvent: methoxybenzene175 which is used as a fragrance for cosmetics and foods, (ii) for HTL formation: ethyl acetate176 and 2-methylanisole177 (food additive), and (iii) for ETL formation: 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol178 (with an alcohol soluble ETM, perylene diimide derivative). There are guides for finding alternative green solvents.176 First, the solvent for anti-solvent or CTLs should have a low polarity < 4.5, so it will not dissolve ABX3 perovskites which are ionic compounds that dissolve in strong polar solvents such as DMF, DMSO, and GBL. On the other hand, the solvent should not be nonpolar, desirably a polarity > 2.0, because the solvent must dissolve CTL sources, or dissolve in the perovskite solution during washing out of a strong polar solvent as an anti-solvent.
7. Summary
Perovskite SCs, which started developing in 2009, have finally reached the stage of material selection and process selection for commercialization. The low stability of the perovskite material itself and the short lifetime of the device, which might be due to the ion migration and interfacial/bulk chemical reactions inside the device under light illumination, are still a big issue. Therefore, there have been a lot of efforts devoted to address these problems in a variety of ways, including optical, physical, chemical, and device analysis processes. The remark ‘the next generation solar cell with high efficiency’ was realized with a 22.7% efficient device. The comment ‘PSCs are expected to be price competitive’ has been supported by the 5.82 cents per kW price obtained through technical analysis. The expectation ‘a solution process can be applied to a large-area process quickly’ turned into a 10% module with a one-month outdoor stability fabricated through continuous processes. When we searched for articles using ‘perovskite solar cells’ as keywords, the number of searches increased from 4 in 2012 to 56, 462, 1293, and 2242 every year since, and it is already 2998 in 2018. Considering these enthusiastic efforts towards perovskite SC research and given that the first thin film perovskite device took 5 years to increase its PCE from 9.7 to 22.7%, it is expected that the 10% module efficiency will soon become 20%, and more standardized processes and materials will be available within the next five years.
