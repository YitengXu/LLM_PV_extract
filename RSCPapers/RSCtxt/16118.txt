1. Introduction
Currently, routine diagnostic tests often rely on quantitative analysis of various biomarkers and biochemical parameters in biological samples in a central laboratory, with the results accessible only after several hours or sometimes days.1–5 With successful miniaturization of diagnostic tools for various biomarkers, sensitive and reliable point-of-care testing (POCT) technology has been commercialized for disease diagnostics and monitoring in hospital emergency rooms and resource-limited areas.6–9 Low-volume samples, less use of reagents, small form factors, and rapid turn-around times are attractive attributes of POCT technology compared to central laboratory testing. A biomedical evaluation through POCT must be sensitive and specific and should be able to provide quantitative results comparable to existing laboratory-based methods. Recently, with emerging technological innovations in healthcare, a new wave of POCT systems has emerged to offer self-testing to patients without requiring hospital visits and to enable test results to be shared immediately with healthcare providers through wireless connectivity. An ideal POCT system for self-testing requires minimal user intervention during operation to reduce user errors; is user-friendly, with an easy-to-use format; possesses high clinical sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy; provides immediate clinical assessment; and provides personal affordability through low manufacturing and consumable costs. Recent interest in POCT systems oriented for self-testing has sparked development efforts toward mobile and wearable POCT systems based on mobile and wearable electronics. In this review, a mobile POCT system is defined as a standalone Internet-of-Things (IoT) system or mobile system such as a smartphone which can read measurement signals of target species from samples collected (on-body or off-body) in a sensing platform and send detection results to clinics via wireless communication. Meanwhile, a wearable POCT system is defined as a wearable system which can perform sampling and measurements on body and transfer detection results to clinics via wireless communication.
Unprecedented technological advances in the areas of chemical and biochemical sensors,10 lab-on-a-chip systems,11 IoT (Internet of Things) technology,12 and wearable electronics13,14 have enabled new approaches for mobile and wearable POCT systems. State-of-the-art mobile and wearable POCT systems for quantitative detection of single or multiple target analytes in a variety of biological samples typically require a combination of many components, including sample handling platforms, recognition elements such as probes, signal transducers, signal readouts, and power sources, and their integration into a variety of form factors. However, full integration of all components into mobile and wearable POCT systems meeting the requirements for self-testing is lacking because design of fully integrated systems and integration of all components require new innovative approaches for realizing simple but accurate detection methods and user-friendly operation with minimal user intervention. The multidisciplinary interfacing of chemistry, biology, and engineering will play a central role in realizing mobile and wearable POCT-based self-tests.
Herein, we review the recent developments, remaining challenges, and future prospects of fully integrated mobile and wearable POCT systems. Previous review articles have provided an overview of biosensing and detection methods, target analytes, and materials used in the development of biosensing devices that may or may not be fully integrated in POCT systems.15–21 Herein, we highlight integrated systems with near-term potential use in POCT systems for self-testing. We elaborate the merits and shortcomings of highly integrated POCT systems that use different sample handling platforms and biosensing methods with optical and electrochemical readouts on handheld devices to provide quantitative test results. The concept of wearable POCT systems has been mentioned in other studies, but there was no systematic detailed discussion on the integrated systems and future development direction.13,22–25 The wearable POCT systems discussed in our review can be understood as a part of wearable electronics, which has a broader scope including electronic, optoelectronic, and bioelectronic devices in the form factors of wearables for the human body. Although wearable devices also have high mobility and connectivity, we review wearable POCT systems separately from mobile POCT based on smartphones or standalone IoT devices due to the large difference from mobile POCT systems in form factors, sample handling platforms, biosensing methods, and test protocols. We extensively review recent developments in the field of sample handling platforms, signal transduction and readouts, and power sources and their integration into various form factors of wearable POCT systems. The development of integrated mobile or wearable diagnostic systems for future on-body POCT is also discussed in detail. We also summarize the current challenges and future prospects for personal healthcare with sample-in result-out mobile and wearable POCT systems.
2. Overview of mobile and wearable POCT technologies
As aforementioned, mobile and wearable POCT systems require integration of multiple components that meet the requirements for mobile or wearable applications. Each POCT system requires appropriate sampling methods for different body fluid samples of capillary blood, interstitial fluid (ISF), sweat, wound exudate, saliva, tears, or urine and sample handling platforms of lateral flow assay (LFA) or microfluidics integrated with (bio)sensors with specific signal transduction and readout techniques. Table 1 summarizes the developed technologies according to form factors and sample handling platforms with a variety of signal transducing methods.

In mobile POCT, capillary blood samples using finger prick or hill prick are used most frequently. Recently, capillary blood collection devices based on microneedle has been developed for minimally invasive capillary blood sample collection.26–28 While sweat, wound fluid, saliva, tears, or urine for mobile POCT can be collected passively and non-invasively, ISF can be collected in a minimally invasive manner using a microneedle or an applied electric field for user convenience. In wearable POCT, on-body collection of capillary blood, sweat, wound exudate, or ISF can be achieved using various methods such as absorption pads, microneedles or an applied electric field similarly to the sampling methods for mobile POCT. However, non-invasive or minimally invasive approaches to minimize user intervention are critically important since the sample collection device to acquire samples should be properly integrated to achieve seamless flow from sampling to sample transport and detection zones. For on-body detection of target biomolecules, the volume of the collected samples should be properly metered for precise quantification of targets.
Depending on kinds of target analytes, ranging from small molecules to ions to pathogens, mobile POCT systems mostly employ both LFA and microfluidic platforms for sample handling. Paper-based LFA strips with improved recognition elements and nanomaterials for signal amplification have been developed for quantitative detection of various targets using optical or electrochemical signal transduction in mobile POCT.29,30 Microfluidic-based platforms have been investigated for accurate fluid control, which can greatly reduce the required sample volume, increase the accuracy of analytical measurements and open up the possibility of multiplexing in mobile POCT.31–33 For sample handling in wearable POCT systems, microfluidic-based platforms based on flexible or stretchable materials are promising because sample collection and sample transport parts can be integrated in one device in a wearable form factor. In the case of continuous monitoring of target molecules such as metabolites, in particular, minimizing the dilution effects caused by accumulation of fresh samples during sampling is necessary to quantitate target concentration accurately.
For detection of various targets, biosensors or electrochemical sensors have been employed in mobile and wearable POCT. Multidisciplinary interfacing strongly improved sensing performance by offering analyte specificity through biorecognition, i.e., probe elements for biomolecules34 or selective membrane35,36 for ions coupled with an appropriate signal transducer to provide a quantifiable signal. The intersection of chemistry, engineering, and biology is critical to form an array of new approaches to develop detection methods with superior sensitivity and specificity. For biosensing of proteins, hormones, metabolites, pathogens, or ions, a variety of recognition elements with direct influence on the overall bioassay performance such as sensing procedures, signal transduction and signal amplification methods which ultimately affect the specificity and sensitivity of detection have been used for POCT. Interplay among these fields has helped develop POCT technology, which has been traditionally performed under laboratory conditions. For mobile POCT, a variety of recognition elements have been utilized such as proteins,37–39 oligonucleotides,40–43 peptide–nucleic acids,44,45 cells,38,46 or enzymes47,48 that are immobilized on a suitable substrate while retaining their biological activity. Antibodies or aptamers have been used most frequently as recognition elements for LFA49 or microfluidic50 platforms for detection of protein biomarkers, bacteria, or viruses in mobile POCT. Due to the small form factor in wearable POCT, in particular, delivery of reagents and washing buffers for affinity-based biosensing to detect proteins, hormones, bacteria, or virus is severely limited.
Therefore, approaches that can enable label-free, wash-free, or reagent-free detection schemes need to be considered. For continuous monitoring of biomarkers such as proteins or hormones, new concepts for regeneration of biosensors by dissociation of target analytes from biorecognition elements to reopen the binding site51–53 are required in fully integrated mobile POCT systems for self-testing. For detection or continuous monitoring of metabolites in biofluids, on the other hand, enzymes have been mostly used as recognition elements. However, the critical aspects of such recognition elements are the stability and cost-effectiveness for integrating them in chemical or biochemical sensors in mobile or wearable personal POCT applications. More details of recognition elements for target molecules for mobile and wearable POCT technologies will be discussed in Sections 3.1 and 4.3, respectively.
Once the recognition elements interact with target biomolecules in biosensing, a transducer plays a critical role by generating an electrical or optical signal through a biochemical reaction that corresponds to the concentration of target analytes. For enhancement of transducer signals during the interaction of recognition elements and targets, various materials have been employed. In biosensing applications, for example, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have frequently been reported as labels or tracers for both optical and electrochemical transduction.54,55 Other materials, such as polystyrene-beads,56 liposomes,57 up-conversion nanoparticles,58,59 fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles,60 and quantum dots (QDs),61 have been frequently used in target analyte detection. Also, nanocomposites62 and phosphor materials63 are relatively new additions to biosensing applications. Primarily, electrochemical and optical transducers have been introduced to enhance the sensitivity of the detection methods used in fully integrated mobile and wearable POCT systems. Target analytes can be detected using optical methods, such as colorimetry, fluorescence, luminescence, and reflectance, or electrochemical methods, such as amperometry, voltammetry, and potentiometry. Both optical and electrochemical approaches have been used extensively in mobile POCT applications, whereas electrochemical and colorimetric methods have been preferred for wearable POCT. In addition, the recent, rapid expansion of flexible and stretchable electronic technology has produced deformable transducer devices that can be integrated into bands,35,36,64,65 patches,66–72 tattoos,73–78 contact lenses,79–88 and bandage/wound dressings89–95 with improved mechanical matching with the human body for wearable POCT systems. Furthermore, immobilizing recognition elements for stable sensing performance under mechanical deformation requires new chemical approaches. For adoption of deformable transducers, development of new materials with high mechanical stability and signal invariance under bodily motions is of technical importance.
Signals read from transducers and data processing need to be optimized for fully integrated mobile and wearable POCT systems. Optical and electrochemical signal readout components, including optical modules and potentiostats, respectively, have been efficiently integrated into POCT systems. For example, the built-in camera modules in smartphones can be used as optical detectors for various signals and have already been used as an instrumental interface for various mobile POCT applications. Furthermore, the universal distribution and wireless connectivity of smartphones, along with the possibility of developing customized applications for them, have changed perceptions of POCT health monitoring. Recent research shows an upward trend for using smartphones to detect and quantify targets ranging from small molecules to human pathogens. On the other hand, signal readout components in wearable POCT systems need to be small and should consume less power without impeding user comfort during activity. Therefore, readout components are now transformed from rigid silicon chips into stretchable or flexible electronics that can handle electrical or colorimetric signals and wireless communications.
Another important requirement for components of mobile and wearable POCT systems is an effective power source for successful realization of biosensing devices. Disparity between development of biosensing applications and efficient adaptation of power sources in small form factors is a common obstacle in wearable POCT. The option for powering POCT systems depends upon the way they will be used. For example, rechargeable batteries can be used as power sources in mobile POCT when they are integrated with a smartphone or used as a standalone device. However, wearable bioelectronics require effortless integration of power sources with the body for POCT applications. Recent research explored the possibilities of expanding energy devices by utilizing self-powered biosensor design, wireless energy transfer, and energy harvesting and storage in wearable POCT. In particular, these power options should be optimized for seamless power supply to provide long-term disease monitoring in wearable POCT. Details of possible power sources for wearable POCT applications will be discussed in Section 3.4.
Despite great efforts to develop highly integrated mobile and wearable POCT systems, challenges remain in system design, materials, components, and integration. The details of challenges in mobile and wearable POCT technologies will be discussed in Section 5.
3. Mobile POCT technology
3.1. Fundamental designs and recent development in mobile POCT
As discussed above, mobile POCT must be affordable, robust, and offer a short turn-around time. Design of an efficient mobile POCT system requires the following important elements as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of different components of a fully integrated biosensor including recognition elements, signal transducers, signal acquisition and processing. 

Recognition elements. 
The most critical step in the development of a mobile POCT system is to choose and immobilize proper recognition elements, i.e., probes, while retaining active spatial configuration and orientation. For this purpose, immobilization techniques have been developed based on surface chemistry that does not interfere with the interaction of target molecules and probes.96,97 To achieve stable immobilization on solid substrates, the substrates and probes are usually modified with suitable functional groups that can be easily cross-linked under chemical methods for immobilization. Moreover, the immobilization technique must be reliable and repeatable while maintaining the biological activity of the probe during hybridization steps, blocking the substrate, and detecting target analytes. Typically, the utilization of naturally occurring or incorporated amine, thiol, carboxyl, and aldehyde functional groups from antibodies, aptamers, and enzymes is the most common method for immobilization of probe molecules. Selection of the immobilization technique is also dependent upon efficient attachment of probes with high and uniform probe density. Hence, it is imperative to select an appropriate method since probe density is directly correlated with target binding to the probe and, in turn, limit of detection (LOD) and dynamic range.98
In general, the probe immobilization methods in biosensors include covalent binding, streptavidin–biotin based immobilization and physical adsorption. Among these immobilization techniques, covalent probe immobilization is particularly useful for mobile POCT since it provides good stability during changes in the sensing environment such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength. For example, LFA and microfluidic platforms have often utilized covalent linking of probes on the detection zone.99–101 For covalent immobilization of probe molecules, surface functionalization of the substrates by forming a layer of linker molecules is essentially required prior to the attachment of probe molecules. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, uniformity and high probe density are also critical for the development of an efficient biosensor. Therefore, surface functionalization based on a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of linker molecules has been extensively studied previously on noble metal or oxide surfaces.102–104 The SAM formation by aliphatic and aromatic compounds with free functional groups such as thiols, amines or silanes offers a simple way of covalently attaching probe molecules.105–107 Apart from surface functionalization by linker molecules, the modification of probe molecules is also required to achieve their covalent immobilization on solid substrates to develop biosensors. For example, N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA) is one of the most commonly used agents for modification of proteins including antibodies and peptides for bioconjugation.108,109 SATA allows the conversion of amine groups present in probe molecules to a sulfhydryl which provides an unprotected thiol group (–SH). This thiol group can be subsequently used for covalent immobilization of probe molecules on appropriate substrates. Apart from these modification methods, the streptavidin:biotin-based functionalization technique has been widely used for immobilization of probe molecules.110–112 The highly specific interaction of streptavidin with biotin with high affinity (association constant, Ka = 1015 M−1) provides an efficient way to conjugate bio-probes in biosensing applications. Typically, probe immobilization is achieved by a two-step approach in which the appropriately modified biosensing substrate is immobilized with streptavidin followed by the conjugation of biotin modified probe molecules on the streptavidin modified surface. This method provides a straightforward way to develop biosensors on a variety of substrates, but multi-step processing of substrates and probes, higher cost, and the reduction in binding capability over time are the main disadvantages of this approach. The third most commonly used technique in probe immobilization is physical adsorption.113,114 It provides the simplest method for probe immobilization through hydrophobic, hydrophilic or electrostatic interactions. However, due to inherent disadvantages such as random orientation, high susceptibility to denaturation, and greater possibility of non-specific signals, this method is less favorable in detection zones of biosensors for mobile POCT applications.115 In conclusion, it is imperative to adopt suitable modification techniques for substrates as well as bioactive probe molecules in order to develop highly efficient biosensing platforms.


Signal transducers. 
Use of a suitable signal transducer in mobile POCT can provide processable signals for target quantification. For example, use of nanomaterials as transducer components can provide high sensitivity and accuracy, as previously discussed. Moreover, nanomaterials can be easily conjugated with probes without compromising their activity. Hence, use of appropriate transducer materials is key for development of high-performance sensing signal transduction with quantitation capability of targets for a commercially viable POCT system. TD diagnostic applications of POCT rely on the recognition–transduction system, which performs collectively to convert the biochemical reaction to a readable electrical or optical signal. A variety of materials have been used for development of transducers in chemical or biochemical sensing that provides a lower LOD by amplifying signals116–120 along with a greater dynamic range. Mobile POCT can be expanded to provide higher sensitivity by utilizing various nanomaterials with a distinctive nature related to catalytic, surface, electrical, or optical properties. Furthermore, it is desirable in mobile POCT to have a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) through signal amplification and noise reduction. Hence, utilization of nanostructured nanomaterials in fully integrated mobile POCT can enhance their capability in diagnostic applications.121–123 In addition to metal nanoparticles, QDs are promising materials in fluorescence-based mobile POCT due to their multi-fold quantum yield and superior photostability.124,125 Moreover, QDs are currently available with various surface modifications without compromising quantum efficiency and stability, which allow easy integration with recognition elements for biosensing applications.124 Quantum dots have been integrated with mobile POCT to detect biomolecules,126 pathogens,127 and harmful chemicals128 using a smartphone. However, use of QDs in commercially viable mobile POCT can be affected by their synthesis cost.
Other potential materials in transducers that can play a critical role in mobile POCT application are magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). MNPs can play versatile roles and encourage rapid immunoseparation of target analytes while also providing signal amplification for mobile POCT application.129 The most significant advantage of utilizing MNPs is likely their ability to concentrate target molecules before quantitation. As a step forward, mobile POCT has also utilized fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (FMNPs) for rapid detection of biomarkers by magnetic manipulation followed by fluorescence imaging using a smartphone.130 This can be easily achieved by surface functionalization of MNPs and FMNPs that allows immobilization of probes ranging from oligonucleotides to proteins. This permits selective collection of target analytes by mixing with sample solutions and separation using an external magnetic field followed by optical imaging. Hence, MNPs and FMNPs can be combined with various platforms including LFA and microfluidics in mobile POCT to efficiently multiplex and detect multiple target analytes using optical and electrochemical biosensing applications.
Some other carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene, graphene oxide, and carbon nanotubes have been used in optical or electrochemical transducers for biosensing applications.131–133 These materials exhibit large surface area and excellent electrical properties and catalytic activity, which enhance the sensitivity of detection. Utilizing optical properties of graphene-based materials, smartphone based colorimetric methods have been developed to detect various target analytes.134 However, use of such carbon nanomaterials as transducers in optical as well as electrochemical sensor-based fully integrated mobile POCT systems is scarce. Owing to their cost effectiveness and ease of integration especially with paper-based platforms, carbon nanomaterials can be an alternative to rare metals for development of low-cost mobile POCT devices.


Cost-effectiveness of platform materials. 
The most common substrate materials used in mobile POCT are paper (including nitrocellulose membrane), textiles, fibers, and various polymers and their composites with paper. Incorporation of paper-based substrate materials for multiplexed and quantitative detection of target analytes is of high interest because of their cost-effectiveness.135,136 The surface chemistry, optical and electrical properties, and permeability of those materials are critical to their practical applicability for mobile POCT. For example, a large pore size allows diffusion of test lines in LFA, which can cause faint lines to be missed, decreasing the sensitivity of optical detection. The inherently high background signal of paper in optical signal transduction can also cause a high rate of false negatives and, in turn, low assay sensitivity, particularly for low-concentration targets. Additionally, a decrease in substrate humidity often causes interference with electrical measurements through accrual of charges generated by static electricity. Therefore, substrate materials for mobile POCT applications must be carefully selected based on the detection platform.


Data acquisition and signal processing. 
The most efficient design of mobile POCT mostly features a smartphone, also known as lab-on-a-smartphone, which is highly suitable for personalized POCT and regionalized healthcare management. Current research has successfully demonstrated that smartphones can act as detectors for LFA and microfluidic platforms in mobile POCT, producing small handheld systems that can also function as portable microscopes for bright-field and fluorescence imaging. In recent years, smartphones have also been used as a wireless instrumental interface with bioanalytical devices equipped with signal processing units. Table 2 summarizes the considerable efforts that have been directed toward development of highly portable diagnostic readers that use new quantitative chemical and biochemical sensors embedded in platforms such as LFA strips and microfluidic devices. For instance, optical signals can be read by a digital camera, smartphone camera, or photodetector and subsequently digitalized. The signals can then be analyzed and processed using appropriate imaging software that translates pixel density into quantitative results for a target analyte in the detection zone. Because those optical readers have a poorer SNR than the photomultiplier tubes in desktop analyzers, enhancing the sensing signal and reducing the background signal in chemical or biochemical sensors are critically important in obtaining the required sensitivity and specificity. The electrochemical transduction method is another widely used approach for mobile POCT. Probe–target interactions produce an electrical signal that can be measured by a portable potentiostat and suitable software. Transducing optical and electrochemical methodologies have been used in fully integrated mobile POCT to detect several target analytes, including blood components, pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, nucleic acids, proteins, and hormones.

3.2. Mobile POCT based on a lateral flow assay (LFA) platform
LFA has been widely used as a rapid diagnostic test for POCT to meet the growing need for a portable, inexpensive assessment technique for non-clinical settings.137–148 Fully integrated LFA-based POCT is particularly useful in resource-limited areas, which have inadequate access to infrastructure and services for monitoring of diseases, pollutants, and food-safety hazards. A typical LFA comprises a sample pad that uses the capillary effect to drive the sample into a conjugation pad, which serves as a platform for reaction and detection of target analytes, leaving the remaining sample to run into a wicking or absorbent pad post-reaction. The captured molecules are deposited onto the substrates based on hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, or electrostatic interactions between them to form test and control lines. Conventionally, LFA strips measure biomarkers qualitatively for examination by the naked eye. However, many applications require quantitative analysis of target analytes; for example, to accurately assess disease stage, severity of complications, or extent of treatment required, which limits the usefulness of traditional LFA as a personal diagnostic.149–153 Therefore, development of efficient mobile systems that can use LFA to quantitatively detect target analytes will allow disease monitoring and diagnosis at the point-of-care, which will help to combat issues such as growing healthcare costs and treatment delays, especially in remote and resource-limited areas. Currently, quantitative LFA-based POCT can detect diverse biomarkers, such as hormones,154 bacteria,155,156 viruses,157,158 cancer,158 and cardiovascular diseases.159 Therefore, we discuss advances in LFA-based mobile POCT in terms of sensors, compact systems, and integration with customized software.

3.2.1. Smartphone-integrated next-generation sample-in answer-out LFA. 
In recent years, LFA-based analysis of clinically relevant biomarkers has been implemented with automated systems to provide accurate, on-site test results with high reliability and rapidity and minimal errors. In particular, smartphones have emerged as a next-generation personalized healthcare monitoring tool that can be used for optical-imaging, image processing, and wireless communication. Smartphones have been widely acknowledged and successfully integrated with LFA platforms for various detection methods.151 As shown in Fig. 2a, one smartphone-based system requires a smartphone accessory and nitrocellulose LFA cartridge, which can be fabricated by three dimensional (3D) printing. The cartridge detects cholesterol and bile acid from serum and oral fluids based on an enzymatic reaction that produces a chemiluminescence (CL) signal. This method was based on the enzymatic reaction in which hydroxyl from bile acids was converted into an oxo group by 3α-hydroxyl steroid dehydrogenase. A reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was produced and then reduced to flavin mononucleotide in the presence of FMN oxidoreductase. The reduced FMN then reacted with decanal and oxygen in the presence of bacterial luciferase to produce biochemiluminescence. The produced light was then measured using a smartphone to quantitate the total bile acids. The method also utilized luminol and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to detect cholesterol in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The CL signal appears in two steps: cholesterol esterase hydrolyses cholesterol, followed by its enzymatic oxidation in the presence of cholesterol oxidase. In the second step, H2O2 as a byproduct reacts with luminol in the presence of HRP to create a CL signal that is detected and quantitated by the smartphone. The assay can be performed within 3 min without extensive user interference; it uses a small sample volume and has an LOD of 20 mg dl−1 and 0.5 μM for cholesterol and bile acid, respectively. Compared with the standard assay, this device showed comparable diagnostic performance for physiologically relevant cholesterol concentrations.160 The same research group demonstrated a smartphone-based CL-LFA to quantify salivary cortisol based on competitive ELISA on a nitrocellulose strip using a peroxidase–cortisol conjugate,154 with a detection limit of 0.3 ng ml−1. The major drawback of using these CL reactions to quantify the target analyte is their weak light signals, but the use of enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to amplify the signal in the presence of appropriate substrates can resolve that problem. For example, in the CL-LFA for salivary cortisol, the signals were increased by incorporating luminol and an enhancer that can be catalyzed by HRP.

However, increasing the CL signal intensity is not always sufficient for reliable quantification because the CL intensity decreases considerably and quickly (in 50–60 s) when catalyzed by HRP, which can complicate analyte quantification. This difficulty was overcome using a colorimetric approach to quantification of targets analytes, as shown in Fig. 2b.161 Colorimetric detection was achieved by imaging the test lines with a smartphone and then processing that image with an app. This smartphone-based quantification of salivary cortisol used the smartphone's light-emitting diode (LED) as a light source to illuminate the nitrocellulose strip and acquire the image. The data were analyzed as hue and brightness using a smartphone application, and the measured cortisol was displayed as the user's stress level. The signal was more stable than biochemiluminescence, but this colorimetric approach showed a detection limit of 1 ng ml−1, approximately three times higher than that of the CL-smartphone-based detection method described above. Smartphones and LFA strips have also been deployed with high accuracy and repeatability for colorimetric-based detection of thyroid stimulating hormone,181 pH in sweat and saliva,182 and protein and glucose.183
In addition to detection and quantification of biomolecules, an LFA platform integrated with a smartphone for colorimetric detection has been extended to pathogens of various origins. As shown in Fig. 2c, the Ozcan group155 demonstrated a smartphone-based LFA to detect malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV for on-the-spot analysis of the prevalence of these diseases in low-resource settings. However, the focus of that work was developing a portable system that can use already commercially available LFAs, which means it does not offer an improvement in sample processing, detection time, or sensitivity, which all depend on the manufacturer protocol. The sensitivity of the smartphone-based LFA reader also relied on the manufacturers’ recommended dilution of whole blood. When the concentration of those antigens was lower than the LOD recommended by the manufacturer, the smartphone-based POCT device's accuracy of detection fell below 60%. Thus, it is imperative to develop novel, high-sensitivity, LFA biosensing techniques that can be integrated with smartphone-based systems. Nevertheless, a smartphone-based, mobile POCT system can still be useful with commercially available LFA test strips for home-based or remote monitoring and management of diseases.
An LFA platform integrated with a smartphone was also developed to quantify micronutrient deficiencies, such as vitamin D162 (Fig. 2d) and vitamin B12,163 in blood samples. In both cases, the mobile POCT system utilized AuNPs conjugated with antibodies (Ab) for immunoassay. The method also utilized a silver enhancement solution that undergoes reduction in the presence of AuNPs and causes enlargement of AuNPs. These silver enhancers are light-stable and precipitate when they encounter gold labels, which eventually increases the signal intensity and sensitivity of detection. The amplified signals were then easily read using a smartphone to quantitate the vitamin levels in the test samples. Smartphones have also been used as an interface between a detector and an LFA strip. As shown in Fig. 2e, an LFA strip-based rapid detection kit used Google Glass® technology for quantitative detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA).158 Google Glass® provides a voice-controlled, hands-free system with integrated wireless communication that can be easily connected to other Android® devices. Furthermore, the researchers incorporated a customized quick response identifier on the LFA strips to identify and link patient data. The results from averaging and differentiating the color intensities using calibration curves between the control and test lines provided consistent and quantitative results for free and total PSA.
A LFA platform combined with a smartphone has also been used successfully for fluorescence-based assays that quantitatively detect target analytes. Fluorescence-based LFA has aroused high expectations because it can efficiently improve the sensitivity of analyte quantification while retaining the advantage of portability. For example, salivary cortisol was quantitated on a nitrocellulose-based LFA strip using a fluorescence-based assay. For this purpose, a portable reader unit was engineered to excite europium fluorescent particle-based conjugates on a nitrocellulose LFA strip under UV light. The portable reader can be connected to a smartphone through Bluetooth® for reporting and data transfer.164 Another paper-based LFA platform was developed for on-the-spot prognosis of heart failure using up-conversion of fluorescent nanoparticles (Fig. 2f). This LFA strip can quantify elevated level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) hormone secreted by cardiomyocytes and the degree of suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2), which are both directly associated with heart failure.159 This multiplexed, two-color LFA uses portable readout optics attached to a smartphone and a dedicated application to provide rapid quantification results that show a high correlation with conventional clinical detection methods (Fig. 2f(i)). Furthermore, this LFA platform harbors two test lines for BNP and ST2 and a control line that can be excited with a near infra-red laser to produce blue and green emissions, as shown in Fig. 2f(ii). When tested with clinical samples, the linear dependence of the smartphone reader-based quantification with the conventional immunoassay for both target antigens revealed good correlation of BNP with the FDA-approved kit; however, the ST2 result had a comparatively weak linear relationship with the standard ELISA (Fig. 2f(iii)). The test results showed that the multiplexed detection system has significant selectivity, but precise control of exposure time is critical for accurate detection of these analytes. Moreover, this smartphone-based system requires an external power-source for a laser and an optical system to align and capture images; nonetheless, it could be used as a home self-diagnostic tool.
Electrochemistry is another prevalent tool in developing miniaturized mobile POCT systems. However, development of smartphone-based, fully integrated, electrochemical LFA for personal diagnostics is lacking. Sensitive electrochemical detection of target analytes using AuNPs184 and quantum dots185,186 as labels was demonstrated on LFA. However, none of these systems has been integrated with a smartphone for automated or user-friendly detection of targets to enable their use as personal diagnostics.
Overall, the development of LFA-based immune-chromatographic tests is in parallel with the expansion of smartphone technology and wireless telecommunications, which has demonstrated favorable outcomes in mobile POCT for self-testing. LFA in combination with smartphones provides a versatile platform that can be utilized for optical imaging, signal processing, quantification of target molecules and relay of healthcare related data to health specialists. Hence, smartphone POCT based on LFA provides a more cost-effective approach to detect several analytes ranging from infectious agents to small biomolecules in mobile POCT.


3.2.2. Standalone readers for LFA. 
Fully integrated, portable, and handheld LFA readers that can be customized as needed have also been developed in recent years for quantitative detection of antigens. Some LFA readers, such as the HRDR-300®, can be attached to a smartphone for fluorescence measurement or used as a standalone device for quantitative analysis. That reader can read colorimetric and chemiluminescent signals on LFA strips by measuring fluorescence intensity in a multiplexed fashion. It can also generate tests to user requirements and offers wireless connectivity for data transmission through Bluetooth® and Wi-Fi. Such readers provide needed flexibility in terms of assays and data analysis, especially in resource-limited areas.
A quantitative LFA platform based on a nitrocellulose membrane was used to detect tuberculosis (TB). Quantification of the fluorescent assay used an up-converting phosphor (UCP) reporter to detect IFN-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and chemokine C–C motif ligand 4 (CCL4).187 The system diagnosed TB through the levels of chemokine markers IP-10 and CCL4 in whole blood using a compact UCP strip scanner. It also provides multiplexing capability in analyte detection with a multiplex UCP-LFA platform. In addition to detecting TB, the compact strip readers were used to quantitatively detect helicobacter pylori156 and Aujeszky's disease virus157 with high selectivity. Despite development of these technologies, such portable readers have limitations in functionality. For example, they can be restricted to a specific assay format or have compatibility issues with different smartphone makers and sizes. In other words, despite their goal as a personalized diagnostic reader, few readers are universally applicable for LFA-based quantitative assays.
Overall, LFA-based systems are robust, have low operational costs, and are characterized by readily obtainable results, making them ideal for mobile POCT applications. However, they sometimes lack result reproducibility with complex samples and do not offer much flexibility for quantitative multi-analyte detection. Another important factor that needs to be resolved is the material used to fabricate LFA. For example, as paper is not specifically produced for LFA-based mobile POCT systems, its use has certain inherent drawbacks. Paper has irregular pore sizes, which make controlling the sample flow rate extremely difficult. Furthermore, auto-fluorescence in paper substrates can significantly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio during quantification of target analytes. These inconsistencies in material can lower the specificity and sensitivity of test results. Use of quantitative LFA in mobile POCT can also be restricted by requirements for sample pre-processing or mixing of reagent fluids in a specific ratio. Furthermore, LFA-based quantitative POCT must be calibrated to reduce false-positive and false-negative results, which can be devastating in circumstances such as sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy tests. Therefore, LFA-based mobile POCT diagnostic systems need to improve their analytical performance using clinical samples. Furthermore, the advent of cost-effective 3D printing technology allows the development of low-cost highly customizable cartridges of LFA for portable readers. The presence of economical CMOS sensors, circuit-board based platforms for electrochemistry and wireless modules permits the development of a practical system that can be used for self-testing as well as in field settings. The portable readers can provide flexibility to connect with small tablet computers for image processing, immediate output of results and data transmission. Hence, with improved sensitivity and specificity, a fully integrated standalone LFA reader can provide the distinct advantage of portability with sample-in answer-out analyses for rapid diagnostics.

3.3. Mobile POCT based on a microfluidic platform
Mobile POCT systems based on microfluidic platforms have been particularly highlighted and extensively researched because of their distinctive benefits for a sample-to-answer system. A microfluidic POCT system can offer accurate parallel processing of samples, which makes it a versatile format for integration with various detection schemes. The microfluidic quantitation methods described here use a variety of signals based on optical,188 electrochemical,189,190 magnetic,191 and even acoustic192,193 signal transduction. Recent trends in development of microfluidic diagnostic devices extend to data acquisition and processing to provide quantitative assessment of biomarkers with excellent sensitivity and specificity. Key factors in design of microfluidic platforms for mobile POCT applications in personal diagnostics are cost-effectiveness and disposability. Hence, selection of materials plays a critical role in development of a successful product. Several materials, such as elastomers, plastics, glass, hydrogels, and paper, are commonly used to fabricate microfluidic systems.194 Which materials are appropriate for microfluidic POCT depends on compatibility with the biorecognition system, extent of integration, surface properties, and signal acquisition methods. Paper-based microfluidics can overcome the accuracy and quantification limitations of paper LFA when applied to POCT. In addition to providing passive flow control through the pores of cellulose material, paper enables microfluidic multiplexing in conjunction with quantitative readouts.195 The high demand for personalized healthcare monitoring and in-field diagnostics has created an enormous upsurge in development of novel methodologies for quantitative detection of targets using microfluidics in mobile POCT.

3.3.1. Fully integrated POCT based on polymer microfluidics. 
Microfluidic technology can perform a complete set of analytical procedures (sample pre-treatment, enzymatic assays, probe-hybridization, separation, and quantitative detection of targets) in an automated format.11,193 Among the materials used to fabricate microfluidic devices for analytical procedures, polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are most common.196,197 Their intrinsic properties, such as stability over a wide range of solvents, optical transparency, relatively low fluorescence background, and suitability for mass production processes such as molding at a low fabrication temperature, have made them the preferred material for microfluidic technology. POCT systems based on polymer microfluidic devices have been successfully integrated with various sensing modalities, such as on-chip optical imaging and electrochemical sensing, for accurate quantitation of biomarkers. Polymer-based microfluidic devices have been produced for several mobile POCT applications. Lee and Yang31 proposed a simple but effective system for on-chip detection of cells that uses a PDMS layer to provide a uniform distribution of samples needed for imaging, and it could be easily adapted to POCT by using a PDMS chamber. This on-chip detection method uses bright field microscopy and the shadow imaging phenomenon, which does not require a separate LED for illumination. The method was adapted for colorimetric imaging of blood smears and phytoplankton using a smartphone and a customized mobile application. The smartphone-based imaging achieved a resolution of up to 500 nm in ambient light. An important benefit of this method is its simple design and robustness, which can be easily translated into quantitative microfluidic POCT for various analytes.
Use of microfluidics in mobile POCT has already extended to monitoring and quantifying biomarkers from blood samples for clinical diagnostics.198–200 The iPOC3D smartphone-assisted 3D microfluidic system, demonstrated in Fig. 3a, was used to process blood samples and quantitate hemoglobin by a colorimetric method.198 This 3D-printed microfluidic chip mixes blood with other reagents through capillary forces and does not require an external pump. It is then attached to a smartphone for colorimetric readout of test lines, and a custom application converts the image into quantitative values. The fully integrated system showed good specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve = 0.97 compared with the conventional hematology analyzer as the clinical standard whose area under the ROC curve was set at 1.0). Another automated microfluidic-based mobile POCT system was developed to efficiently diagnose viral infections from whole blood samples. As shown in Fig. 3b, a plastic microfluidic cassette was introduced as a smartphone dongle to develop a low-cost, automated ELISA using gold-labelled antibodies to detect viruses from whole blood samples; it required only 15 min to perform the test in triplicate.32 This microfluidic device can be connected to a smartphone for signal processing through an application. During field testing, the microfluidic dongle-based system demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity for HIV, with slightly lower values for detection of syphilis. In addition to detecting pathogens, this POCT system has been used to quantitate cancer biomarkers in blood samples.

A fully integrated microfluidic-based system (Fig. 3c) was developed to quantify PSA from whole blood samples. It uses a micro-capillary fluoropolymer film platform and colorimetry- and fluorescence-based quantification and has a detection limit of 0.08 ng ml−1. The system showed good sensitivity with smartphone imaging and can be applied for in-field detection, but it lacks smartphone-based image-processing software, which needs to be developed for use in personalized health care.165 The Ozcan group167 integrated a PDMS microfluidic chip with a smartphone to quantify white blood cells and a flagellated parasite (Giardia lamblia) using an optofluidic fluorescence imaging platform with a spatial resolution of nearly 2 μm (Fig. 3d). The smartphone attachment was compact, lightweight, and cost-effective, even with the need for disposable chips, and can be used to help HIV+ patients monitor WBC count, especially in remote areas. Furthermore, a blood assay was used in a microfluidic POCT device to quantify hematocrit in real-time by integrating greyscale colorimetric detection with smartphone imaging on a white acrylic photographic box to prevent irregular illumination.166
Another exciting benefit of microfluidic devices is miniaturization for nucleic acid detection, which eliminates extensive sample processing and the requirement for specialized equipment. As clinical diagnostics, nucleic-acid-based molecular testing is more sensitive and specific than immunoassays. Therefore, simplifying PCR-based assays into an automated, microfluidic, mobile POCT will enormously increase the accuracy of test results. Such a mobile platform (Fig. 3e) was recently developed by Chen and co-workers,33 who built a handheld cradle to hold a microfluidic chip and provide automated, multiplexed, quantitative, fluorescence-based detection of nucleic acids from a target pathogen. The system detected viral and bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted by cell lysis and showed high selectivity when tested with non-target, random DNA sequences. The total time for detection was slightly longer than 30 min, and patient data could be transmitted wirelessly for further investigations. However, the system still has a major drawback for personal diagnostics: it requires heat-based lysis of pathogen samples followed by centrifugation to collect nucleic acids or pre-processing through a commercial DNA extraction kit. Future integration of on-chip cell lysis and DNA extraction, along with detection of target pathogen, will make this system more viable for personalized mobile POCT. As shown in that example, molecular diagnostic methods for pathogen detection require sample pre-processing to extract nucleic acids, followed by amplification and then detection, resulting in complex systems with significantly increased number of reagents required compared with protein- or cell-based mobile POCT. DNA amplification inside a microfluidic chip requires a thermal system and complex fluid management. However, because nucleic-acid-based detection is more accurate, recent development of highly compact microfluidic POCT systems that use smartphones for nucleic acid analysis offers an efficient and reliable technology that can be used beyond academic settings. For wide adoption of microfluidic devices in mobile POCT for personal diagnostics, costs of operation and materials should be reduced further. Moreover, the recent developments in 3D printing technology, 3D structures and a range of materials for the manufacturing of polymer microfluidic devices down to a few microns will allow overcoming the current limitations and provide an opportunity to develop highly potential POCT systems for self-testing.


3.3.2. Fully integrated microfluidic POCT systems based on paper microfluidics. 
Our assessment of the recent literature suggests that POCT systems based on paper microfluidics have expanded substantially due to their low-cost fabrication and disposability. They can also filter out dust and other large contaminants, which can be categorically helpful for effective quantification of analytes from contaminated and complex sample matrices. Whereas LFA can provide only a specific amount of diversity in detecting single or multiple analytes, paper-based microfluidics can integrate multiple complex processes and different kinds of analytical assays.201–203 Earlier works on paper-based microfluidics considered detection methods that can provide only qualitative or semi-qualitative test results.
However, current advances in quantitative analysis using smartphones and portable readers have shown significant improvements in microfluidic POCT devices. For example, Jalal and co-workers169 developed a smartphone-based paper/plastic hybrid microfluidic chip to quantitatively detect clinically significant levels of various analytes. This system used colorimetric assays to quantitatively investigate glucose, total protein, pH, and red blood cells in an artificial urine sample. The smartphone application converts the colors generated by the reaction into quantitative values using a customized application. The quantitative measurements of this system were demonstrated using artificial spiked samples. As clinical urine samples are more complex, the accuracy of such microfluidic devices must be tested using real samples.
Another paper microfluidic device integrated with a smartphone for colorimetric detection of viruses was demonstrated recently.170 As shown in Fig. 4a, dot ELISA was performed to detect influenza A on a paper microfluidic chip immobilized with a specific antibody (Ab). The smartphone was connected to the microfluidic chip for actuation through Bluetooth®. This actuation of the chip initiated a sequential reaction with the reagents stored in the device. Once the reaction was complete, the smartphone captured images from the microfluidic chip, calculated the signal intensity using image processing algorithms, and provided a quantitative assessment. The major drawback of this system is its requirement for an external power source to operate the portable device attached to the smartphone. Nevertheless, such microfluidic platforms will be particularly helpful given the current influenza pandemic scenario, allowing public health monitoring and rapid implementation of control measures. Moreover, paper-microfluidics has been multiplexed for colorimetric detection of various target analytes (Fig. 4b).204 This microfluidic-based mobile POCT can qualitatively and quantitatively measure liver function by testing two liver enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, in whole blood, offering quantification within 15 min using a portable reader and requiring <35 μl of blood. When tested with clinical samples, the device monitored liver injury and hepatotoxicity with greater than 90% accuracy.

Paper-based microfluidic devices have also been integrated with electrochemical sensors for quantitative detection of target analytes. The first demonstration of an electrochemical paper microfluidic device used patterned microfluidic channels on filter paper integrated with screen-printed electrodes for detection of glucose, uric acid, and lactate in serum samples.189 This quantitative detection used an enzymatic reaction with high selectivity, and the results were similar to the quantitated values from conventional bioanalytical methods. Subsequently, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay was introduced (Fig. 4c) and used 3D paper-based microfluidics to monitor tumor markers in clinical serum samples within 30 min.174 This multiplexed detection of biomarkers was performed through the ECL reaction based on applied voltage. In a typical ECL immunoassay, signal emission utilizes either annihilation or coreactant pathways. In the noted study, a paper-based ECL immunoassay device was developed using a coreactant pathway where the signal was produced by formation of Ru(bpy)32+* through electrooxidation of Ru(bpy)32+ and tri-n-propylamine. The capture Ab was covalently attached to the electrode surface, and the detection Ab was labeled with the Ru(bpy)32+. The Ru(bpy)32+ is a widely used inorganic ECL compound since it can be used in buffered solution and produces a signal at room temperature with limited or no interference by oxygen or other sample-related impurities. Moreover, Ru(bpy)32+ can be regenerated on the surface; hence, it is possible to develop a regenerable biosensing approach for long-term monitoring of biomarkers. More recently, a wireless paper-based electrochemical microfluidic platform was developed to determine the prognosis of lung cancer by quantifying enolase. A smartphone was connected to the electrochemical detector, which included a potentiostat and a current to voltage converter that can be powered by a battery or USB. A nitrocellulose membrane patterned with wax was used for the microfluidic device and was modified with graphene, thionine, and AuNPs to detect neuron-specific enolase. This portable system showed a wide dynamic range and a detection limit of 10 pg ml−1, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9.
Quantitation of target analytes on paper-based microfluidics was also performed using the Mie scattering phenomenon. As depicted in Fig. 4d, a three-channel, paper-based microfluidic device pre-loaded with antibody-coated beads was fabricated to detect E. coli in water samples through an immuno-agglutination reaction.171 The accuracy of that method was highly sensitive to the position of the smartphone and angle of the camera. Therefore, the gyrosensor in the smartphone was used to confirm the accurate location before imaging. The acquired images were then processed by a smartphone application to convert pixel density into colony forming units (cfu), quantitating bacteria with a detection limit of 10 cfu per ml. The Mie scattering phenomenon was later combined with a UV light source to enhance the signal intensity. The UV-irradiated, paper-microfluidic device was integrated with a smartphone to recognize the UV light scattered by immuno-agglutination (Fig. 4e).172 Interestingly, the agglutination reaction produced a greater change in scattering intensity than the ambient light that can be measured by a smartphone, and the researchers successfully used that phenomenon to detect E. coli in 10% diluted whole blood samples, with a detection limit of 10 cfu per ml. Mie scattering on paper microfluidics was also used to successfully quantify Salmonella typhimurium, with an LOD of 10 cfu per ml.173
Those results demonstrate that paper-based microfluidic devices have great potential as an effective, low-cost, quantitative bioanalytical system applicable to POCT. The simplicity of device design and precise control over fluid movement allow detection of multiple target analytes from a variety of origins, including clinical and environmental samples. Clear progress in paper-based microfluidics has been made by testing devices in real settings. Factors that have not been tested in this field include (i) effects of physical parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light during quantitative measurement, (ii) effects of sample types, i.e., the presence of blood cells or even viscosity variations that can change the fluid dynamics, (iii) effects of additives on optical measurement of targets, and (iv) sensitivity of paper microfluidics to various reagents.

3.4. Advances in mobile POCT based on sensing platforms other than LFA and microfluidics
Several fully integrated, automated POCT systems based on sensing platforms other than LFA and microfluidics have also been developed for quantitative detection of target biomolecules, cells, and pathogens of various origins. Although accuracy of detection is vital, developing a low-cost, simple sample-to-answer sensing platform for mobile POCT is also highly desirable. One mobile POCT integrated a simple capture and imaging cassette to detect and quantify a bacterial pathogen. The cassette acts as an incubation chamber and was designed by attaching a gasket with holes for sample loading on the top of a plastic sheet. This cassette was then inserted into a magnet holder to efficiently capture and image the bacteria using smartphone fluorescence microscopy. As depicted in Fig. 5a, fluorescence imaging, via a highly portable fluorescent microscope attached to a smartphone, was used to quantify a multi-drug resistant strain of pathogenic bacteria.60 For quantification, S. aureus cells were selectively tagged with fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles using an aptamer and then subsequently captured within a cassette. Once the cells were captured, the smartphone camera was used to acquire images, using the built-in white LED as an excitation source. The number of bacterial cells in the minimally processed food sample was enumerated using an imaging-based quantification method.205,206 The method showed excellent selectivity and sensitivity, with up to single bacterium detection.

A universal mobile electrochemical detector (Fig. 5b) uses commercial glucose test strips as a sample handling platform. This fully integrated platform could also use screen-printed electrodes and ion selective electrode platforms to detect other metabolites.176 Interestingly, this system quantitated glucose in a linear dynamic range of 50–500 mg dl−1, which apparently falls below the physiological range, with a smaller standard deviation than commercially available glucometers. Portable POCT devices that offer a performance within the range of the gold standards for their analytes have tremendous potential in personalized healthcare. This particular system does not include a sample pre-processing platform and cannot be used for on-the-spot detection of samples that require pre-processing. The important benefit of this system is that it does not require a high-end smartphone; the POCT test results can be transmitted to a low-end mobile phone as audio-based data. This functionality is especially helpful in remote areas in which internet access, especially wireless access, is slow, difficult, or unavailable.
Another electrochemical biosensor based on a nitrocellulose membrane was demonstrated by Zhang and co-workers177 as a quantitative protein biosensor for mobile POCT (Fig. 5c). The test strip was developed by depositing a nitrocellulose membrane onto the surface of an electrode to immobilize the probe molecules used to detect the target analyte. This system uses smartphone-enabled handheld impedance spectroscopy to detect the biochemical interactions on a single large electrode, a screen-printed carbon electrode, and a multichannel interdigitated electrode through an impedance analyzer circuit. The redox couples, K4[Fe(CN)6]/K3[Fe(CN)6], were used as a measure of charge transfer resistance and concentration of analyte. The impedance gradually increases with increment in the number of layers and density of probes on the electrode. Probe immobilization reduces the surface for interaction of ferrocyanide with the electrode, increasing impedance compared to the bare electrode. The addition of target analyte further increases the charge resistance and hence the impedance in a concentration-dependent manner. This change in impedance is then used to quantify the target molecules using a smartphone. The data are then transmitted to the smartphone using Bluetooth® for further analysis and display of results. The system successfully quantified bovine serum albumin and thrombin, with limits of detection as low as 1.78 μg ml−1 and 2.97 ng ml−1, respectively. In both previous systems, the signal processing circuitry was assembled on a compact and portable attachment that can be wirelessly connected to a smartphone for data transfer.
An interesting modification in the smartphone circuitry board was proposed to quantitate uric acid from a blood sample using an electrochemical enzymatic reaction (Fig. 5d).178 This so-called “medical smartphone” integrated an electrochemical module with the main circuit board of the smartphone to read an enzymatic test strip using the electrometer. The system showed high accuracy and precision when tested with multiple clinical samples. This integration eliminates the need for a separate portable device to attach to the smartphone for signal processing. Such devices can be convenient and highly useful in resource-limited and rural areas. However, the user needs to buy a separate smartphone for this purpose because the electrochemical module is integrated with the main circuit board of the smartphone. Developing a separate modular dongle that could be easily and wirelessly connected to a smartphone would be more convenient and probably more cost-effective.
All those examples of mobile POCT require a specific substrate in a particular shape or size to be compatible with the designed readers. However, to increase the feasibility of mobile POCT, researchers need to develop mobile readers that can adopt materials from central laboratories and apply them directly to point-of-care diagnostics. For example, quantitative ELISA in a centralized laboratory in a 96-well format provides better throughput and more accurate tests than LFA. Transferring this technology by developing a smartphone-based microplate reader could likely fill the gap between central laboratory testing and mobile POCT.179 Using that reasoning, a handheld colorimetric smartphone-based microplate reader was developed with LED arrays, optical fibers, and an integrated 3D-printed attachment that can hold a 96-well microplate (Fig. 5e). The images obtained from the immunoassay can be transmitted through optic fibers individually connected to each well and processed through a dedicated smartphone application. The system was validated by monitoring measles, mumps, and herpes simplex viruses HSV-1 and HSV-2 and provided an overall excellent accuracy of 99.6%, 98.6%, 99.4%, and 99.4%, respectively, compared with the FDA-approved method. The system provides enough flexibility to be expanded to detection of multiple analytes in multiple wells for high-throughput and thus does not require specific fabrication procedures for multiplex detection in POCT settings. The 96-well plate platform was also integrated with a smartphone to detect target analytes using an electro-luminescent assay.180 In addition to the smartphone, this device, called the bionic electronic eye, uses a wide-angle lens to shorten and stabilize the distance between the microtiter plate and smartphone camera. The images were captured post-reaction, and the pixel intensity was calculated based on the hue, saturation, and value model, requiring approximately 10 s. The main advantage of this system is that all 96 wells can be imaged and processed simultaneously while the microplate reader works asynchronously. This is especially beneficial when the assay is performed in a time-dependent manner: a standard microplate reader performs readouts well by well, which causes a time delay between detection of the first and last wells. On the other hand, the well-plate integrated with a smartphone requires more precise sample handling than needed for standard readers.
3.5. Powering mobile POCT
As mentioned above, compared to a bench-top laboratory facility, the mobile POCT offers portability with rapid and low-cost disease diagnosis for appropriate clinical assessments. However, one of the key challenges that must be addressed to develop a mobile POCT is to power the systems for prolonged times with less stringent requirement of external power supply. In resource-limited settings, in particular, a power source is critically important due to more stringent requirements in power management. Typical POCT systems are mainly composed of three important elements of sample handling, sensing, signal processing and data acquisition. Each of these elements requires power to operate collectively for diagnosis. For example, an active microfluidic-based mobile POCT requires power to mix or pump liquid inside the microfluidic device for several min to h of analysis or for continuous monitoring of target analytes. Biosensing devices are another major source of power consumption especially in electrochemical sensors, while optical sensors that require a portable microscopy setup to achieve readable signals also require power. Moreover, optical or electrochemical signal readout in external handheld or standalone devices and smartphones also requires power for signal processing. Hence, optimized development and usage of external power sources is critical to develop a fully integrated mobile POCT. Currently, mobile POCT devices are equipped with commercially available batteries as external power sources. However, such batteries increase the overall cost of mobile diagnostics due to their regular maintenance and replacement after prolonged use. Therefore, integration of smartphones allows a more energy efficient solution in mobile POCT since the battery in the smartphone can be used to power the sensor, signal processing circuit, and data processing. Smartphones utilize rechargeable lithium ion batteries and provide an array of built-in hardware and applications along with wireless connectivity. Hence, a smartphone with large battery capacity and longer standby time along with its data processing capabilities can be a universal platform for mobile POCT.
However, such batteries utilize toxic chemicals such as lithium, lead, mercury, and cadmium. One solution might be development of solar-powered mobile POCT, since the Sun is an abundant source of sustainable energy, particularly in resource-limited areas.207–209 Thermal gradient and mechanical vibrations can also play a key role in power generation for mobile POCT. Thermoelectric materials, when combined, can produce sufficient electrical current to power a biosensing device.210 Researchers have also attempted to convert mechanical energy to electric power through nanogenerators and demonstrated their utilization in diagnostic devices.211 These technologies can also be integrated in mobile POCT to allow an unprecedented run over a longer period of time. The mobile POCT in resource-limited areas can also utilize biofuel cells (BFCs) that convert biological degradable material into power.212,213 Efficiently limiting the form factor of BFCs can be a promising energy-harvesting technique in mobile POCT.
4. Wearable POCT systems
4.1. Summary of recent developments in wearable POCT systems
The rapid growth of flexible and stretchable electronics technologies has enabled a variety of wearable sensors to be applied for healthcare monitoring and diagnostic systems in the personal healthcare sector.214–216 Even though not all sensor devices for wearable POCT need to be flexible or stretchable, wearable sensors with high deformability and conformality are key candidates in developing new form factors for next-generation, wearable POCT.13,217 Wearable POCT can open a new venue for medical monitoring and testing in which individuals without formal training can use monitoring and diagnostic equipment and obtain test results by themselves at their homes, schools, workplaces, or sports facilities. Moreover, wearable POCT could help patients with chronic illnesses monitor their status intermittently or continuously in their everyday environments. Wearers could be assisted in personal diagnosis and monitoring of health conditions or in prevention of certain diseases.
Wearable systems for medical monitoring and testing can be classified into two groups: (i) physical sensor-based wearable systems for measuring electrophysiological activity (electroencephalograms, electrocardiograms, and electromyograms)218,219 and physiological parameters such as temperature,220,221 heart rate,222 motion,223 and emotion224 and (ii) biochemical sensor-based wearable systems for non-invasive or minimally invasive sampling from the skin, eye, mouth, or wound bed of a human body to monitor analyte levels in various body fluids, which can provide a dynamic and powerful understanding of a human's state of health. Here, we limit the biochemical sensor-based wearable systems as wearable POCT technology for personal diagnostic applications. The potential for biochemical sensor-based wearable POCT to monitor a range of physiological conditions or to detect diseases is presented in Table 3, where the examples of common target analytes, clinical concentration ranges, indicator of diseases, and probes to detect analytes are highlighted.

To obtain a picture of dynamic health conditions or diseases via levels of analytes in biofluids, the biochemical sensor-based wearable POCT will need to be integrated with five components: (1) sample handling component, (2) sensing component including recognition elements, (3) power component, (4) signal acquisition and processing component, and (5) read-out component. In biochemical sensor-based wearable POCT with an electrical transduction signal, the sensor component is directly interfaced with the signal acquisition and processing circuitry to form an on-body system. The signal acquisition and processing components control the sensor; amplify, digitize, and process the signal; and transmit digital data to the reader component (out-body device) using a wireless communication module.35,36,64,66,74,225 The reader component, often a smartphone with a software application, performs data analysis and data calibration to output concentrations or levels of target analytes. In some cases, a reader component is directly integrated into the on-body device for real-time monitoring without the need for data transmission. Regarding biochemical sensor-based wearable POCT systems using the optical signal transduction method, the sensing component is commonly colorimetric. The resulting color change is captured by a camera and transferred to a reader that contains a software application that processes the images and calibrates and displays the outcomes. An important component for development of biochemical-based wearable POCT system is a sample handling component that induces, collects, and transports body fluids to the sensing part. For accurate detection, a sample handling device that can extract and collect human biofluids and then move them to the sensing area must be completely integrated into the wearable POCT system. Therefore, developing a chemical or biochemical sensor-based wearable POCT system integrated with all the components (sampling component, sensing component, power component, signal acquisition and processing component, and reader component) for practical use in home settings during normal activities remains a big challenge.
In this section, we review fully integrated biochemical-based wearable sensors for wearable POCT systems for monitoring and diagnostics. First, we overview the sampling methods developed to extract sweat, ISF, and capillary blood from a human body. Then, we review recent advances in development of fully integrated wearable biosensors in form factors of bands,35,36,64,65 patches,66–72 tattoos,73–78 accessories,79–88 bandages, and wound dressings89–95 for wearable POCT systems. Finally, we discuss the powering of wearable POCTs.
4.2. Sampling methods in wearable POCT systems
Several body fluids (sweat, tears, saliva, ISF, blood, and wound fluids) are candidates for on-body measurements by biochemical sensor-integrated wearable systems. A sample handling device must be able to sequentially capture small amounts of biofluids to assess temporal variations in analyte concentration. Human biofluids can be divided into available biofluids (tears, saliva, and wound fluids) and non-available biofluids (sweat, IFS, and blood), suggesting two ways to access them for on-body measurements: (1) develop a wearable biosensor platform that can directly contact available biofluids without requiring a specific sampling process80,87,95 and (2) integrate a sample-handling device into a wearable biosensor to collect non-available biofluids and transport them to the sensor.35,67,74,75,226 Even non-available biofluids can be stimulated and accessed by non-invasive or minimally invasive methods. For example, sweat can be normally stimulated by non-invasive methods such as exercise and iontophoresis.35,64,66 To collect sweat generated by exercise, wearable chemical and biochemical sensors use absorption pads (porous materials, fabrics, or hydrogels) as fluidic interfaces66,67,244,245 or microfluidic channels70,226 that can directly and reliably harvest sweat from the skin surface and drive it to the sensing area. The sensing device can be mounted directly on the absorption pads using a microporous structure that allows spontaneous sweat collection through capillary forces (Fig. 6a).244 The capillary sweat absorption rate of microporous substrates depends on the material surface and porous structure. However, sampling methods that rely on absorption pads cannot easily capture a large enough sample volume for quantitative tracking, minimize evaporation, or eliminate contamination from sweat samples. Also, the fluid flows of induced sweat cannot be directly controlled for sample isolation. Recently, Rogers's group introduced a thin, stretchable microfluidic platform that is laminated onto skin to collect, store, and drive sweat through an interconnected set of micro-reservoirs (Fig. 6b).246 To control and drive sweat through the network of microchannels, capillary bursting valves were designed to open at different pressures.

One more important parameter in sample handling is sample volume. Sampling methods that use absorption pads and microfluidics produce sample volumes in the μl range and require sampling times of 10 min or more, which increases the chance of sample contamination. Therefore, Peng et al.247 proposed a new sweat sampling method that can collect sample volumes down to the nL scale and reduce analyte contamination from the skin. Applying a cosmetic-grade oil between the skin and a microporous membrane that is porous only to sweat generated a novel sampling method. The researchers found that their new method isolated the induced sweat to the area above the sweat gland regions, which both reduced sample volume and decreased sampling time. Moreover, the cosmetic-grade oil can block hydrophilic (low oil solubility) contaminants from the skin surface.247
To locally stimulate sweat in the sensing channel in another way, wearable biosensors or electrochemical sensors have also been integrated with iontophoresis devices that allow equilibrium sweat to be collected without exercise. The anode and cathode electrodes of an iontophoresis device contain a sweat-inducing drug (pilocarpine) and are covered with hydrogel layers to ensure proper contact with the skin. When voltage is applied to the electrodes, the drug is driven across the skin and causes sweat glands in the vicinity to produce sweat in the area around the wearable biosensor (Fig. 6c).35,225,240
The ISF, which exhibits a high correlation in analyte concentration with blood, is also a candidate biofluid for on-body detection using wearable biosensor systems. It can be non-invasively extracted using a reverse iontophoresis device.69,74,79,248,249 In this device, local current extracts the ISF, and the hydrogel layer simply isolates the electrodes from the skin surface without applying a drug. The applied low voltage causes a low level current to flow through the skin, inducing migration of cations that generates an electro-osmotic flow of the ISF toward the cathode on the skin surface; this migration can be detected to quantify the analytes in the ISF (Fig. 6d).240,248,249 The concentration of glucose extracted from hair follicles correlates highly with that in the ISF. To avoid the variability in glucose detection commonly found using the ISF, Lipani et al.249 proposed a glucose sensor containing an array of miniaturized pixel extraction-detection devices that allows individual pixels to interrogate a single preferred glucose pathway (glucose extracted from hair follicles) (Fig. 6e). If a pixel array has enough density and the correct size, the number of preferred pathways on the skin can be sampled randomly and individually by the pixel devices. This approach helps to measure the concentration of glucose in the ISF with high accuracy and without fluctuation. To extract glucose from intravascular ISF, which is expected to have a high correlation with blood glucose, Chen et al.69 developed electrochemical twin channels (ETCs) that use a paper battery. At the anode of the paper battery, high-density hyaluronic acid with a positive charge is repelled into the ISF, which increases the ISF osmotic pressure and disrupts the balance between ISF filtration and reabsorption. Thus, refiltration and reabsorption of intravascular blood glucose are promoted and reduced at the arterial and venous ends, respectively. These processes help to extract more intravascular blood glucose from the vessel and transport it to the skin surface (Fig. 6f). The ISF can also be accessed by a minimally invasive microneedle method, which disrupts the outer layer of the skin to access the ISF while causing negligible damage or pain.26,27 Alternatively, a sensor can be directly integrated into a hollow microneedle array (Fig. 6g) to continuously monitor the analytes in the ISF in real-life situations.26 A hollow microneedle has also been used to extract blood for detection of analytes. For example, Li et al.28 developed a one-touch-activated multi-diagnostic system for blood that integrates a paper-based sensor with a hollow microneedle. The extracted blood is separated and driven to the reaction membrane, where analytes are detected by colorimetric assay (Fig. 6h).
In summary, several sampling methods have been developed in wearable biosensor-integrated systems for real-time on-body measurements. For collection of sweat, sampling techniques rely on absorption pads attached directly to the skin that capture sweat via their microporous structure. This approach does not offer some capabilities, such as storing enough sample volume for sensing, controlling fluid flows, minimizing evaporation, eliminating contamination, minimizing sample volume, and reducing sampling intervals. To overcome those problems, new sampling technologies have been developed, such as microfluidic platforms and an oil/membrane approach. However, although those sampling methods can collect and transport sweat, they cannot induce sweat. Therefore, iontophoresis devices have also been developed to locally induce sweat in a sedentary condition. Moreover, sampling devices such as reverse iontophoresis and microneedle arrays can extract the ISF and capillary blood, respectively. Integrating those devices into a single wearable biosensor system is another issue. Development of methods for extracting (or inducing), collecting, and transporting biofluids that can be integrated with sensors is necessary to enable on-body measurements using wearable POCT systems.
4.3. Chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated wearable POCT systems
There has been growing interest in a fully integrated chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated wearable POCT system that can be developed into various form factors (flexible band,35,36,64,65 stretchable patch,66,67 microfluidic patch,70,226,250 temporary tattoo,73,74,229 watch,79 mouthguard,80 eyeglass,82 contact lens,85,86,233 bandage,89,90,236 and wound dressing94,95) to provide continuous monitoring or one-time measurement capability of analyte levels in biofluids via different signal transduction methods. A summary of chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated wearable systems is shown in Table 4, and a more detailed discussion is presented in Sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.4. Recent developments have focused on wearable electrochemical sensors and optical sensors (Fig. 7). Electrochemical sensor-integrated systems have been developed via three approaches based on enzymatic electrochemical biosensors, nonenzymatic electrochemical sensors, and ion selective membrane-based electrochemical sensors.

(1) Enzymatic electrochemical biosensors rely upon specific enzymes that are immobilized on the surface of a working electrode. The oxidation or reduction process between specific enzymes and electroactive analytes in a chemical reaction generates an electrical current proportional to the target concentration. The number of steps of the charge transfer process between the enzyme and electrode in enzymatic electrochemical biosensors will determine them as first, second, or third generation. An enzymatic electrochemical biosensor is of the first generation, if the chemical reaction between the enzyme and analyte produces a compound that is oxidized at the electrode surface. An enzymatic electrochemical biosensor is of the second generation, if the biosensor detects the presence of a reaction product catalyzed from the enzyme via a mediator of charge transfer. When there is direct electron transfer between the enzyme and electrode in an enzymatic electrochemical biosensor, it is considered to be a third generation sensor. Most current enzymatic wearable electrochemical sensors are first generation. To develop electrochemical biosensors for wearable applications, a great number of nanostructured materials such as graphene, AuNPs, nanoporous Au, and Au nanomesh have been synthesized and functionalized on working electrodes for immobilization of enzymes.66,67 The functional working electrode with mechanical deformability, high conductivity, large surface area for biomolecular conjugation, and high loading efficiency significantly improved electrochemical activity, reduced the overpotential, and enhanced the electron transfer rate, allowing high-performance sensors. For example, graphene doped with Au or combined with an Au mesh has been used as the working electrode material in a stretchable electrochemical glucose sensor to improve electrochemical activity and provide fast electron transfer (Fig. 7a).66
(2) A nonenzymatic electrochemical sensor uses a catalyst as an electrode material to directly oxidize electroactive analytes and generates an electric current proportional to the analyte concentration. Recent studies reported nonenzymatic wearable sensors using Au nanostructures (Au wrinkled and Au porous)227,228,251 as a working electrode for glucose oxidation (Fig. 7b). The large surface area of the working electrode with Au nanostructures would serve as active sites for adsorption of glucose to increase electrocatalysis on the electrode surface. Therefore, electrodes with nanostructured materials are generally advantageous in terms of sensitivity for sensing. Moreover, working electrodes with nano-wrinkled and nanoporous Au (NPG) structures demonstrated not only improved glucose sensitivity, but also enhanced selectivity.227
(3) An ion selective membrane-based electrochemical sensor is known as a potentiometric sensor and measures the potential created between working and reference electrodes in an electrochemical cell. The working electrodes in potentiometry are modified by an ion-selective membrane, which only allows diffusion of the target ion (Fig. 7c). In a wearable electrochemical sensor, the ion selective electrodes are often modified with sodium ionophores, potassium ionophores, calcium ionophores, and chloride ionophores to obtain high selectivity of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl− in body fluids, respectively.35,36,64,70 Optical transduction techniques have also been integrated into wearable chemical or biochemical sensors.95,226,253,254 The most common optical sensing technique in wearable biosensors is colorimetry because of its facile signal readout. A colorimetric biosensor uses a sensing element in which color changes are caused by interaction with a target analyte (Fig. 7d).226 The intensity of the color change allows quantification of analyte concentrations, typically glucose, lactate, Na+, Cl−, and pH.

4.3.1. Chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated bands/patches. 
In this section, we present bands and patches fully integrated with chemical or biochemical sensors for detecting biological targets such as glucose, metabolites, electrolytes, and pathogens from the ISF35,69,72 and sweat.36,64–67,70,71 The bands and patches are composed of flexible or stretchable materials that conform to the curvilinear geometry of human skin for non-invasive or minimally invasive monitoring of analytes in biological fluids.
A fully integrated, wearable biosensor system was developed by Javey et al.35,36,64,65 They proposed a solution to overcome the existing technological gap among signal transduction (converting an electrical signal using a transducer), signal acquisition (amplification, filtering, and transmission), and data processing (analyzing, calibrating, and compensating) in a wearable sensor system.64 They fabricated flexible signal acquisition and processing units by consolidating commercially available integrated circuits on a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) and then merging them with a flexible biosensor array to generate a fully integrated wearable biosensor system. The system was attached to the human body, and its mechanical and electrical properties allowed real-time detection of analytes in biological fluid. Its biological element successfully processed, calibrated, and compensated conditioned signals through its microcontroller's computational and serial communication abilities, and it transmitted the data to a smartphone (off-body device) through a wireless transceiver. To operate, the system requires a smartphone containing a custom-developed mobile application with a user-friendly interface that provides real-time display of biological fluid analyte levels and allows the data to be shared or uploaded to cloud servers.
Based on the above techniques, they developed a wearable, flexible, integrated sensing array (FISA) for multiplexed analyte screening.64 To obtain good selectivity and simultaneously measured glucose, lactate, Na+, and K+, the array biosensor is based on enzymatic and ion-selective sensors. They also developed a flexible array of Ca2+, pH, and temperature sensors that is interfaced with an FPCB to perform real-time quantitative analysis of Ca2+ and pH in sweat, urine, and tears in an off-body state.36 Moreover, this group also proposed a wearable microsensor array and interface with an FPCB for simultaneous multiplexed monitoring of heavy metals in human body fluids.65 Using a gold and bismuth microelectrode and the electrochemical square wave anodic stripping voltammetry method, the device simultaneously and selectively measures Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu, and Hg with ultrahigh sensitivity and good stability. To produce sweat for real-time analysis of analyte levels often requires exercise, which is a limitation of wearable integrated systems. Therefore, the same group proposed a new approach that integrated an electrochemically enhanced iontophoresis interface with a biosensor array for real-time analysis of human sweat without exercise or user discomfort.35 The iontophoresis interface can be programmed to induce sweat with different excretion rate profiles, and the induced sweat can be analyzed on-site immediately with high sensitivity in physiologically relevant ranges of interest. A biosensor array with the enhanced iontophoresis interface has also been integrated with an FPCB to generate a fully integrated wearable and autonomous system. For real-time, on-body analysis, the above integrated biosensor systems can be formed as a smart wristband (Fig. 8a) or headband that can attach to human skin for accurate in situ monitoring levels of glucose, lactate, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl−, pH, and heavy metal from human sweat. The real-time sweat analysis results are directly transmitted to a mobile phone and read by a custom-developed mobile application that can help users monitor or diagnose their health status in real time.

In another study, a wearable biosensor was combined with an electrophysiological sensor to develop a wearable hybrid sensing platform for simultaneous real-time monitoring of ECG signals and lactate level in sweat.68 The hybrid sensing system was fabricated on a thin polyester substrate in an array structure using screen-printing technology and interfaced with a custom PCB including a potentiostat, electrocardiogram analogue front-end, and Bluetooth® for real-time on-body characterization of the ECG signal and lactate analysis.
Conformal attachment and the ability to sustain the mechanical deformation caused by skin movements are important characteristics for body-friendliness of wearable chemical or biochemical sensors. Some stretchable chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated systems that attach well to skin without causing discomfort have been developed.66,67 For example, Kim's group proposed a stretchable integrated biosensor patch based on a serpentine structure for monitoring glucose in sweat and offering feedback therapy (Fig. 8b).66 A bilayer of gold-doped graphene and gold mesh was used for electron transfer in glucose sensing to enhance the electrochemical activity and biochemical sensitivity and selectivity of the device. The sensing component contained a glucose sensor, a pH sensor to correct for pH-dependent deviations in the enzyme-based glucose sensor, a humidity sensor to determine the starting point for glucose and pH sensing, and a strain sensor to detect the tremors that occur in a hypoglycemic state. The same group also developed a wearable integrated biosensor patch and disposable biosensor strip for monitoring glucose in sweat and delivering medication.67 The porous gold nanostructure as the working electrode maximized the electrochemically active surface area, which helps the glucose sensor to detect the small amounts of glucose in sweat with high sensitivity. In addition to the sensing component, the stretchable integrated patch and disposable strip glucose biosensor also included a therapeutic component for transcutaneous drug delivery to control blood glucose level. The therapeutic component contained drug-loaded microneedles integrated with a heater to thermally activate and control the amount and rate of drug release. The integrated patch is wirelessly connected to a portable electrochemical analyzer that transmits data to a mobile device. The drug delivery capability of the integrated patch was demonstrated through delivery of metformin and a subsequent reduction of blood glucose level in diabetic mice. These wearable chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated systems have the potential to serve as wearable POCT devices that can perform diagnostics and treatment simultaneously. However, the device must be interfaced with signal readout and data processing units in the on-body system to control and operate the sensor and therapeutic systems and process data, as well as communicate with the off-body device. Wearable bands and patches with sweat chemical or biochemical sensors primarily use planar-sensors or absorption pads that are directly attached to the skin to capture sweat. These approaches have some limitations in storing and controlling the sample, minimizing evaporation, and eliminating contamination. To overcome these problems, sweat sensors have been directly fabricated226,237,252,253 or integrated238,250,254 into microchannels of a microfluidic device. For example, Rogers's group incorporated a colorimetric dye into the PDMS microchannel network of a microfluidic device to create a stretchable microfluidic biosensor (Fig. 8c)226 with the capability of sweat capture, routing, and storage in spatially separated regions for analysis. The on-body system measured total sweat loss, pH, lactate, chloride, and glucose concentration during a long-distance bicycle race via colorimetric detection. They also developed a stretchable, waterproof, epidermal microfluidic biosensor (Fig. 8d)252 by incorporating a colorimetric chemical reagent (including a food dye to facilitate visual flow-driven change in the microchannel, and silver chloranilate as a colorimetric indicator to detect chloride in sweat) into a poly(styreneisoprene-styrene) (SIS) microfluidic channel. This device has the ability to carry out quantitative in situ measurements of chloride level in local sweat, local sweat loss, and sweat rate during physical activity in controlled, indoor conditions and in open-ocean swimming. This group also introduced a wearable, battery-free, microfluidic/electronic system (Fig. 8e)253 by integrating electrochemical and colorimetric biosensors into a PDMS microfluidic system. The microfluidic system housed electrochemical biosensors that are based on BFCs for lactate and glucose detection and various colorimetric assays that rely on silver chloranilate, a chemical that reacts with Cl−. The advantages of this platform are significantly lighter, cheaper, and smaller form than alternatives. The device system can simultaneously monitor sweat rate/loss, pH, lactate, glucose, and chloride. Whole wearable microfluidic biosensors developed by Rogers's group were also integrated with a near-field communication (NFC) electronic system to support both wireless power delivery and data/digital image transmission to any NFC-enabled consumer device, such as a smartphone, tablet, or watch (Fig. 8f).226,252,253 Moreover, the same group also integrated a fluorometric sensor into wearable microfluidic devices for sensing of sweat captured via smartphone-based fluorescence-imaging modules.237 This device has the ability to measure Cl−, Na+, and Zn2+ levels in sweat with high accuracy.
Developing wearable POCT systems by integrating a chemical or biochemical sensor-integrated with a wearable microfluidic device for real-time and continuous monitoring and analysis of analytes in sweat is an attractive alternative to analyzing blood samples in a portable device.238,250,254 For example, integration of an electrochemical biosensor with epidermal microfluidics for fast sweat sampling and continuous, real-time monitoring of glucose and lactate levels has been demonstrated. This flexible epidermal microfluidic biosensor is also interfaced with an FPCB for wireless monitoring during cycling activity (Fig. 8g).250 Moreover, a wearable microfluidic sweat sensing patch has been proposed by embedded ion-selective sensors and an electrical impedance-based sweat rate sensor into a flexible microfluidic device (Fig. 8h).238 The sensing patch is also interfaced with a PCB and attached to the human body for on-body, real-time simultaneous monitoring of Na+ concentration and sweat rate.
Most of the wearable chemical or biochemical sensor bands and patches discussed above use enzymatic biosensors, which present disadvantages such as lack of stability; easy interference by temperature, pH, and humidity; and complexity in fabrication. Nonenzymatic electrochemical sensors might offer an alternative solution to these issues. Recently, there have been developments in wearable nonenzymatic electrochemical sensor for glucose detection. For example, a wearable nonenzymatic glucose sensor patch based on a 3D microneedle array with a Pt black sensing electrode layer has been developed to minimally invasively pierce the epidermis and detect glucose levels in the ISF.72 This microneedle array patch was attached to rabbits and used to monitor glucose level with high stability. A reported stretchable electrochemical sweat sensor for detection of glucose and pH has been demonstrated.251 To obtain stretchability for conformal contact on skin, the device used a Au nanosheet (AuNS)–CNT as a working electrode; for glucose and pH detection, CoWO4/CNT and polyaniline/CNT nanocomposites were coated onto the CNT–AuNS electrodes, respectively. This device can be attached to human skin for detection of glucose and pH in sweat. Moreover, a stretchable nonenzymatic glucose sensor was also developed using Au nanostructures.227,228 In the first approach, they developed a fully stretchable microfluidics-integrated glucose electrochemical sensor patch that combines a stretchable NPG electrochemical electrode on a 3D-micropatterned stretchable electrode for a high electrocatalytic effect with a stretchable passive microfluidic device (Fig. 8i).228 The device presented accurate delivery of sweat from skin to the electrode surface, with excellent replacement capability. In the second approach, a stretchable, nonenzymatic, electrochemical glucose sensor patch was developed based on rGO/polyurethane (PU)–Au nanowrinkle hybrid fibers (Fig. 8j).227 This fiber presented high electrocatalytic activity due to the synergistic effects between the Au nanowrinkles and the oxygen-containing functional groups on the rGO-supporting matrix. The Au nanostructure working electrode in stretchable nonenzymatic glucose sensors not only enhances sensitivity, but also improves selectivity against interference. These nonenzymatic glucose sensor patches were also interfaced with a portable analyzer to measure glucose concentration in sweat during cycling in an on-body, real-time, and continuous manner. The approach for nonenzymatic electrochemical sensors offers promise for development of enzyme-free, biosensor-integrated, wearable POCT devices. In this case, the stability, reproducibility, selectivity, interference of pH and temperature, and long-term operation of nonenzymatic electrochemical sensors need to be addressed further.
In general, many approaches are available for development of wearable chemical or biochemical sensor-integrated bands and patches. The sensitivity and selectivity of the sensors can be improved by developing novel electrode materials, such as graphene/gold hybrids,66 porous gold,67 or nanostructured gold,69 to enhance electrochemical activity. The multiplexing capability of wearable sensors has been demonstrated by fabricating devices in an array structure35,36,64–67,70,71 that can screen various analytes simultaneously, enabling rapid, highly selective, and reliable quantification. For real-time, on-body analysis of analyte levels in body fluids, wearable chemical or biochemical sensors are interfaced with an FPCB35,36,64,68 or a portable analyzer66,67 that includes signal acquisition circuitry and a signal processing unit to both analyze and transmit the processed data to an off-body device (mobile device, cellular phone, or laptop) for real-time display. For sample collection, sensing components were also integrated with a microfluidic device.226,237,238,252–254 Such fully integrated, wearable biosensor bands and patches open the possibility of wearable POCT for self-testing and monitoring. However, they still have some disadvantages, such as sweat sampling through exercise,36,64,66,67,70,71 long sampling times, different sweat rates at different body parts resulting in varying analyte concentrations, and an inability to simultaneously correlate sweat and blood analyte levels. Enzymatic biosensors lack stability and are easily affected by temperature, pH, and humidity. Sampling methods such as iontophoresis35 and reverse iontophoresis69 have been developed to induce sweat and ISF, respectively, in a short time and at rest (without exercise). Nonenzymatic electrochemical sensors that use microneedles for minimally invasive measurement of analyte levels in the ISF offer promise for improving the stability and accuracy of wearable biosensors. However, developing a fully integrated, wearable, biosensor-integrated patch or band that satisfies all the requirements for wearable POCT remains a big challenge.


4.3.2. Chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated temporary tattoos. 
Temporary tattoos have mechanical properties similar to human skin, and they can be easily laminated for continuous contact despite repeated mechanical deformation; thus they present unique potential for wearable chemical or biochemical sensors and POCT systems.256 A tattoo-based wearable POCT is barely noticeable during daily activity. Most tattoo-based chemical or biochemical sensors were developed by Wang's group.73–77 These devices can be classified into two types: amperometric sensors for lactate,73 glucose,74 and alcohol75 monitoring and potentiometric sensors for ammonium,76 pH,77 and sodium78 detection. For real-time, on-body measurements, the tattoo-based sensors are coupled with flexible electronic boards containing a microcontroller for amperometry/potentiometry operation and a wireless Bluetooth® communication device to transmit the data to an off-body device for display in real time.
The first tattoo-based biosensor developed by Wang's group was amperometric and was fabricated by directly screen-printing three electrodes (working, counter, and reference) onto a temporary tattoo and transferring to human skin (Fig. 9a).73 The tattoo-based lactate sensing used LOx for the catalyzed reaction and demonstrated high selectivity and stability despite the bending and stretching of human skin. The device was placed on the deltoid and interfaced with a portable electrochemical analyzer via a thin-film connector for real-time analysis of lactate in sweat during exercise (Fig. 9b). For glucose monitoring in a rest state (without exercise), they developed a tattoo-based glucose sensing method that combined with reverse iontophoresis to draw ISF glucose to the surface of the skin by applying a low current density between anodic and cathodic compartments (Fig. 9c and d).74 The tattoo-based iontophoretic-biosensing device measured the change in glucose level before and after a meal. This group also developed an iontophoretic-biosensing temporary tattoo system for non-invasive alcohol monitoring in induced sweat.225 Constant-current iontophoresis delivered the drug pilocarpine across the skin to induce sweat, and the alcohol was monitored using an alcohol-oxide enzymatic electrode and a Prussian blue (PB) electrode transducer. For on-body measurements, the tattoo-based iontophoretic-biosensing device was interfaced with thin, flexible, printed electronic circuitry to control the iontophoresis/amperometry operation and transmit the measurement data to an off-body device in real time (Fig. 9e). Test results from the integrated tattoo device demonstrated a clear difference in the signals before and after consumption of an alcoholic beverage. Moreover, the same group developed a tattoo-based dual iontophoretic-biosensor applied for simultaneous monitoring of glucose in the ISF and alcohol in sweat.229 This device houses the electrochemical biosensors integrated with a flexible iontophoretic system to enable simultaneous real-time analysis of ISF glucose at the cathode side and sweat alcohol at the anode side. The device was printed on an epidermal temporary tattoo platform, transferred onto human skin, and interfaced with an FPCB to drive the iontophoretic electrodes, control the biosensors, and wirelessly transmit the sensed information to a smartphone for on-body, real-time, and continuous monitoring of sweat-alcohol and ISF-glucose in human subjects consuming food and alcoholic drinks (Fig. 9f).

Tattoo-based potentiometric chemical sensors were also developed by Wang's group to monitor ammonium,76 pH,77 and sodium78 levels in sweat through the use of nonactin for ammonium, polyaniline (PANi) for pH and a sodium ionophore for sodium. The resulting tattoo ion-selective-electrode biosensor offered a rapid response and high sensitivity to a wide range of analyte concentration changes with negligible carryover effects. Moreover, the tattoo-based potentiometric chemical sensors also exhibited high stability under repetitive mechanical deformation, which is a key requirement of tattoo-based biosensing of human perspiration. For real-time, on-body analysis, the tattoo-based potentiometric sodium sensor was coupled with a custom-designed wireless transceiver to transmit the potentiometric data to a personal computer in real time.78
Tattoo-based chemical or biochemical devices offer considerable promise for non-invasive monitoring of target analytes (glucose, pH, ammonium, alcohol, and sodium) and could represent the next-generation technology for body-compliant, wearable POCT. However, these devices still have some limitations. For example, the LOD of tattoo-based biosensors is larger than tens of μM, which is higher than the trace (μM–nM) levels of some analytes in body fluids. Most of tattoo-based biosensors use enzyme-catalyzed reactions which are easily affected by temperature, pH, and humidity. Therefore, to calibrate the analyte levels in body fluids, temperature, pH, and humidity compensation should be considered. Moreover, developing multi-sensing capabilities on a temporary tattoo to detect several analytes simultaneously remains a big challenge. Additional efforts should be devoted to development of flexible electronic boards, including signal readout and data processing units, and an interfacing method for tattoo-based biosensor devices that offer real-time, on-body measurements.


4.3.3. Chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated accessories. 
Wearable chemical and biochemical sensors fabricated in the form factors of watches, glasses, contact lenses, and mouthguards are classified as accessories. These chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated accessories are designed to analyze sweat, ISF, tears, and saliva. For real-time, on-body monitoring, the biochemical sensor accessories are integrated with signal and data processing units (including potentiostats, microcontrollers, and wireless Bluetooth® communication modules) to control device operation, convert analogical signals to digital ones, process digitized data, and transmit data to off-body devices. These kinds of chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated accessories offer promise for development of personalized, wearable POCT.
The first biochemical sensor-integrated accessory, the Glucowatch® (Fig. 10a), was developed by Tierney et al.79 It contained a disposable biosensor, a microprocessor, data storage memory, and a liquid-crystal display. The electronic circuitry in the microprocessor controlled a reverse iontophoresis current for inducing the ISF and operated the amperometric biosensor for glucose detection. Measurement data were verified and converted into a real-time display in the reader. The Glucowatch® could measure and display glucose levels every min for 12 h with accuracy and precision comparable to finger prick blood glucose measurements. Also, the performance of the smart watch did not differ meaningfully when it was studied in a controlled clinical environment and an uncontrolled home environment. Therefore, the Glucowatch® had the potential to monitor both acute and long-term diabetes, but it was removed from the market because of limitations such as skin irritation caused by reverse iontophoresis, need for a long warm-up time, and a calibration requirement with standard blood glucose strips.

A biosensor-integrated mouthguard was proposed by Kim et al.80,81 This amperometric biosensor can directly measure lactate80 and uric acid81 levels in saliva via LOx and uricase enzymatic reactions, respectively. Using screen printing technology, the electrodes, enzyme, and transducer (PB) layers can be printed directly onto the mouthguard and interfaced with a wireless amperometric circuit board that includes the potentiostat, microcontroller, and a Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE) transceiver to generate a fully integrated mouthguard biosensor system (Fig. 10b).81 The mouthguard biosensor demonstrated high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability for detecting lactate and uric acid in human saliva. Its detection range for uric acid covered the concentration ranges found in both healthy people and hyperuricemia patients.81 Moreover, the fully integrated mouthguard biosensor was able to detect uric acid levels in real time and transmit the signal to external mobile devices throughout the entire 4 h of operation, with measurements carried out at 10 min intervals. The biosensor mouthguard platform is an attractive wearable monitoring system for diverse personal POCT applications.
Most chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated accessories lack multi-analyte detection capability. To address that limitation, Sempionatto et al.82 presented multi-analyte biosensor-integrated eyeglasses. Potentiometric and amperometric biosensors were printed on a polyethylene (PET) substrate and attached to the nose pads to monitor potassium and lactate levels in sweat. To develop a fully integrated eyeglass with multiplexed biosensing, both potassium and lactate sensors were connected to a PCB on each inner arm of the eyeglass frame (Fig. 10c). The two PCBs controlled the potentiometric and amperometric operations and transmitted the detected signals to an off-body device via BLE. The on-body, fully integrated eyeglasses with multiplexed biosensing simultaneously monitored lactate and potassium in sweat during cycling activity.
Contact lens-based biosensors that can detect glucose and lactate levels in tears have been described by some research groups,83–88,230 including a system with an integrated amperometric enzymatic lactate83 and glucose84,85 sensor. The sensing devices were fabricated on a PET substrate molded into contact lenses for in situ monitoring. They offered fast response times, high sensitivity, and good repeatability. Furthermore, they showed linearity in the normal range of tear lactate and glucose concentrations (0.1–0.6 mM). For application in continuous tear glucose monitoring, the contact lens-based glucose sensor was integrated with a telecommunication circuit to operate the sensing device and transmit the detected signals to external devices. A fully integrated contact lens-based biosensor for real-time monitoring of glucose level in tears has been developed by Google.88 The top and bottom lens layers are made from a conventional hydrogel lens material, and an electronic ring including a tiny wireless chip, a miniaturized glucose sensor, and a tiny battery is embedded between the top and bottom layers (Fig. 10d).88,230 The glucose level read by the device can be transmitted to a smartphone and potentially directly to a physician. Moreover, the fully integrated contact lens sensor can also be combined with a tiny LED light to warn users when their blood glucose level goes outside the normal range. Moreover, for a simple fabrication process and easy readout by smartphone, Elsherif et al.233 created a contact lens-based optical glucose sensor for continuous quantification of tear glucose. A photonic microstructure was generated on the surface of glucose-sensitive hydrogel networks, which changed volume under various glucose concentrations via the interaction of phenylboronic acid in hydrogels with glucose (Fig. 10e). As a result, a change in the periodic constant of the microstructure led to a change in Bragg diffraction and modulation of the space between zero- and first-order locations (Fig. 10f). The device can be attached to a commercial contact lens for continuous glucose monitoring with a response time of 3 s and a saturation time of 4 min using a smartphone camera to record the reflection power of the first-order diffracted light. This achievement is promising for application in wearable POCT and diagnostics at home settings.
Soft contact lenses integrated with biosensors for monitoring tear glucose were also demonstrated.86,87,231 These glucose sensors can be amperometric sensors86 or field-effect transistor (FET) sensors87,231 that use GOx as the enzyme. Park's group developed a transparent stretchable FET glucose sensor that includes an AgNW/graphene hybrid as the electrode and graphene as the channel.87,231 For glucose detection, a graphene channel was immobilized by GOx using a pyrene linker via π–π stacking. The sensing mechanism of the device was based on GOx, which catalyzes oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and reduction of H2O to H2O2. This H2O2 is also decomposed to produce O2, H+, and electrons. As a result, a change in carrier density in the channel led to modulation of the source–drain current (Fig. 10g). This device was also integrated with a stretchable wireless sensing antenna and attached to a soft contact lens for real-time glucose monitoring (Fig. 10h).87 For in vitro testing, the soft smart contact lens glucose sensor was put on a rabbit eye to measure tear glucose concentration (Fig. 10i).87 As a result, reflection of the antenna was enlarged when the soft contact lens with the glucose sensor was placed on the rabbit eye. This group also developed a fully integrated, soft, and smart contact lens by integrating an FET glucose sensor with wireless power transfer circuits to display pixels and visualize sensing signals in real time.231 The mechanism of the smart contact lens is presented in Fig. 10j. First, the transmitter transfers radio frequency (RF) to the antenna, and then the rectifier converts the AC signals into DC so that the LED is turned on and the sensor is operated. If the contact lens is exposed to tear glucose with a concentration over the threshold, the LED pixel will be turned off. This device has been demonstrated in in vivo tests to monitor glucose concentration in tears.
Biosensor systems on contact lens could be developed for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring in diabetic patients. However, some issues need to be considered. For example, the correlation between tear glucose and blood glucose is unclear.19 The devices are directly exposed to high temperature and light, leading to a limited life because of degradation of enzymes, and the power supply for device operation needs to be small enough to prevent eye irritation. Furthermore, development of a fully integrated biosensor system on contact lenses with multiplexing capability (including array sensors and signal acquisition and data processing units) for real-time on-body measurements remains a big challenge.


4.3.4. Chemical and biochemical sensor-integrated bandages and wound dressings. 
Another important application of wearable chemical and biochemical sensor systems is wound healing monitoring. Wearable chemical and biochemical sensors can detect biomedical parameters in wound fluids, such as pH, bacterial metabolites, and biomarkers.257–264 The measured levels of those parameters can inform patients about the wound healing process and accurately assess wound status. Normally, to speed the healing process, wounds are covered with a bandage and wound dressing to protect them from debris and adhesion and ensure a moist, unperturbed environment. For real-time monitoring of analyte levels in wound fluid, several wearable chemical or biochemical sensors embedded into bandages89–92 and wound dressings93–95,265 have been proposed in recent years.
There have been some developments in smart bandages for pH sensing as an indicator of wound status. For example, a potentiometric pH sensor was embedded into a bandage to monitor the pH of wound fluid in real time.89 The reference electrodes (Ag/AgCl), reference membrane (polyvinyl butyral polymer), and working electrode (carbon layer and PANi) were directly fabricated on a commercial adhesive bandage by the screen-printing method. To demonstrate the capability of the device, the researchers tested it against human serum diluted to various pH levels. Furthermore, a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel simulating the composition of a wound was also used to assess the ability of the bandage-based pH sensor to dynamically monitor pH changes in wounds. The other smart bandage-based pH sensor with wireless monitoring of wound status was fabricated by inkjet printing.90 This smart bandage contains two parts: a disposable part formed by inkjet-printing electrodes on a paper substrate and a reusable part constituting the fabricated wireless electronics on a Kapton® substrate. The bandage can monitor bleeding, pH, and external pressure on the wound site in real time and transmit those parameters to a reader for determination of wound status (Fig. 11a). Moreover, a wireless smart bandage with optical pH monitoring was developed by casting a pH-sensitive hydrogel layer on the soft fabric of a bandage. This device could detect pH changes with high accuracy and stability and communicate with an out-body device via radio-frequency identification (RFID) (Fig. 11b).236

Reproduced with permission.265 Copyright 2017, Wiley-VCH. 
Uric acid is another indicator to monitor wound status. Therefore, some smart bandage-based uric acid sensors have been demonstrated. Kassal's group developed a smart bandage with wireless connectivity for detecting uric acid in wound fluid.91 The uric acid sensor was screen-printed onto the soft fabric of bandage, and the working electrode was immobilized by uricase via glutaraldehyde cross-linking with bovine serum albumin. Finally, the device was integrated with a custom-designed wearable potentiostat with wireless electronics for real-time monitoring of uric acid (Fig. 11c). In another approach, an omniphobic paper-based smart bandage (OPSB) was designed to monitor the uric acid and pH levels in wound fluid.255 The OPSB, which was lightweight, flexible, breathable, and disposable, was interfaced with a wearable potentiostat and attached to a wound site to simultaneously quantify pH and uric acid levels, which were wirelessly transferred to the user or medical personnel (Fig. 11d). Furthermore, a smart bandage based on an enzymatic uric acid biosensor was fabricated by screen printing an electrochemical biosensor on the soft fabric of a bandage.235 For continuous monitoring of wound healing, the device was interfaced with a flexible potentiostat board.
For detection of tyrosinase (TYR), a cancer biomarker, Ciui et al.92 proposed two electrochemical sensing methods, a wearable bandage with a TYR biosensor and a wearable microneedle with a TYR biosensor. These devices were also integrated with soft, flexible electronic boards for real-time monitoring of TYR enzyme levels both on the skin surface and under the skin (Fig. 11e and f). The sensing mechanism of these devices is based on the reaction of TYR with catechol-containing agarose gel, which was immobilized on the transducer surface of bandage-based and microneedle-based sensors. To demonstrate the potential of those sensors for TYR screening, porcine skin with different TYR levels was tested. Both the bandage and microneedle sensors accurately detected the TYR levels dosed into the porcine skin. The development of fully integrated bandage and microneedle TYR sensors is a promising step toward melanoma screening applications.
Wound dressings and medical textiles are other candidates of sensor platforms for wound healing monitoring. To quantify wound biomarkers, Liu et al.94 developed a wearable biosensor for uric acid on a gauze using a unique embroidery fabrication process. This biosensor exhibited good linearity in the detection range from 0 to 800 μM and excellent reproducibility. To demonstrate the potential of the gauze-based uric acid sensor for wound monitoring, simulated wound fluid containing uric acid levels of 600 μM was applied to the device every hour as it performed continuous measurements for 7 h.
In patient care, the abilities to detect pathogenic infections and release drugs at the wound site are very important. Therefore, Mirani's group95 proposed a multifunctional hydrogel-based dressing (GelDerm) for monitoring the pH level in wound fluid and simultaneously releasing an antibiotic agent to the wound site. A color-changing pH sensor with an array of porosity was fabricated by 3D printing alginate microfibers loaded with mesoporous resin beads (pH-responsive dye) for long-term monitoring of pH level in wound fluid (Fig. 11g).266 Meanwhile, a drug-eluting scaffold was fabricated by 3D-printing alginate fibers loaded with gentamicin. For qualification of pH values, the system uses ImageJ image processing software and an in-house smartphone application (iDearm). To demonstrate the capability of the sensor to detect pH changes caused by bacterial infection, the GelDerm was integrated with commercial dressings and placed on pig skin with different pH values. The color changes in the sensors were recorded and converted to quantitative data via iDearm (Fig. 11h). Moreover, to enhance the healing rate of chronic wounds, a smart wound dressing that enables delivery of different drugs with a controlled temporal profile has been developed.265 The smart wound dressing was created by assembling the composite fiber with a core layer as a microheater and cell hydrogel layer containing different drugs into fabrics using textile processes. This device could be also connected to a flexible electronic driver to wirelessly transfer commands from an external source such as a smartphone (Fig. 11i).265

4.4. Powering wearable POCT systems
Toward realization of personal diagnostics using wearable sensor-integrated POCT, a major challenge is supply of continuous power. Wearable POCT systems powered by conventional lithium-ion batteries with bulky size, heavy weight, and rigid materials have been investigated for wearable POCT with a rigid form factor, but they are obtrusive. Moreover, conventional batteries require frequent charging. However, for wearable applications, users prefer a power source with continuous supply for prolonged operation. It is thus necessary to develop relevant power sources in the vicinity of target wearable POCT systems.
As mentioned above, an on-body device in wearable POCT should include three functional components: (i) sample handling device, (ii) chemical or biochemical sensor, and (iii) PCB for signal acquisition and processing. Each component consumes a different level of power. Therefore, continuous power supply for this wearable POCT system is still a large problem. To address this issue, the scientific community has focused on four aspects: developing wearable self-powered sensors,267–269 wearable wireless energy transfer,87,231,245,253 wearable energy harvesting,124,270–273 and wearable energy storage systems.274–278 Self-powered sensors allow autonomous operation with no power consumption, which will reduce the burden of power management in a wearable POCT system.267,268 For autonomous wearable POCT, the electronic circuit for data processing and transmission in wearable POCT systems needs power. One candidate solution for this issue is to use a battery-free electronic system that transfers energy via NFC and antenna.87,226,231,253,279 Another option is development of energy storage devices such as flexible and stretchable supercapacitors and batteries that can be easily integrated with wearable POCT systems.274–278 Although such energy storage devices have been developed as the most common power sources for wearable POCT applications, there are issues for long-term operation such as low energy capacity, poor discharge current, and limited charge–discharge cycles. One of the alternative routes to providing storage devices with an energy source is development of wearable energy harvesting devices that can generate energy from ambient light, body motion, sweat, heat, motion, or friction. Such wearable energy harvesting devices are quite attractive.124,270–273 For wearable POCT application, however, some issues should be addressed. (i) The power conversion efficiency of these device is still far from the requirements for fully integrated wearable POCT, (ii) there is a need for a continuous energy supply for an autonomous wearable POCT that can be operated continuously for long-term with high stability and reliability, and (iii) there is complex engineering for construction of a fully integrated, self-powered, and wearable POCT system in one platform due to the need for charging circuitry.
The following sections will discuss recent major development in wearable power systems such as wearable self-power biosensors,267–269 wearable energy transfer, wearable energy storage, wearable energy harvesting, and wearable energy autonomous POCT. In each section, we will point out some limitations that impede fulfilment of the requirements for a wearable POCT device.

4.4.1. Self-powered biochemical sensors for wearable POCT. 
Development of self-powered biochemical sensors is of great significance for future POCT systems and enables reduction of power consumption in a fully integrated, wearable POCT system or allows construction of an autonomous POCT system with no external power supply. In this case, BFCs hold promise for self-powered biosensors as they can be designed to serve as self-powered electrochemical sensors by displaying power signal proportional to the analyte level. The first concept of wearable BFC-based self-powered biosensor was proposed by integrating a BFC with a glucose biosensor into a contact lens for detection of glucose level in tears (Fig. 12a).267 For development of the BFC, researchers employed 3D-nanostructured gold modified with tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as an anode and bilirubin oxidase (BOx) as a cathode. This BFC utilized the ascorbic acid and oxygen readily available in tears to generate electricity. At the anode, ascorbic acid is oxidized to 2-dehydroascorbic acid and transfers four electrons from TTF-TCNQ to gold (Fig. 12a). Meanwhile, oxygen is reduced to water at the cathode and transfers four electrons from cathode to BOx (Fig. 12a). When the BFC was operated in tears, it generated a suitable power source for glucose sensor operation for several hours. A wearable self-powered biosensor was also developed using a stretchable textile-based BFC.268 The electrodes of the BFC was fabricated using a screen printing method. The anode with functionalized enzyme (GOx or LOx) and naphthoquinone (NQ) acted as a redox mediator to oxidize glucose or lactate and release electrons (Fig. 12b). Meanwhile, the Ag2O/Ag redox couple electrode that accepts those electrons to complete the power circuit was chosen as the cathode (Fig. 12b). With this approach, the biodevice could indicate analyte levels in sweat based on the extracted bioenergy from the sweat analytes. A stretchable, self-powered biosensor was also fabricated on a sock and worn on a human body for real-time monitoring of lactate concentration in sweat (Fig. 12c). In another approach, a wearable self-powered glucose sensor was fabricated by integrating a vertically stacked paper-based glucose/oxygen BFC into a standard Band-Aid® patch (Fig. 12d).269 This biodevice can be attached to a human body to collect sweat and generate bioenergy which is then used as a transducing output signal of glucose level in sweat (Fig. 12e).

4.4.2. Wearable wireless energy transfer. 
The most promising way to power a fully integrated wearable sensor system is to transfer energy from an external source to the system using NFC technology. This approach has been demonstrated by Rogers's group.226,252,253,279–281 Using this technology, they have developed fully integrated wearable sensors with a battery-free configuration for real-time, continuous monitoring of skin temperature,226,252 heart rate,279 temporal dynamics of arterial blood flow,279 and metabolite levels253 in sweat from a human body. For example, they proposed a battery-free, wireless electronic sensing platform for monitoring of metabolites in sweat.253 The device was fabricated by interfacing BFC-based lactate and glucose sensors on the microfluidic patch with NFC electronics (Fig. 13a), which enables wireless power transfer and data communication with standard NFC-enabled platforms (smartphones or tablet computers) via an antenna (Fig. 13b). This device was also attached to human skin for real-time measurement and readout of lactate and glucose concentrations in sweat via a radio frequency (RF) reader (Fig. 13c and d).

(g) Optical image of a soft, smart contact lens on a rabbit eye to monitor the increase of glucose concentration in tears. Reproduced with permission.231 Copyright 2018, American Association for Advancement of Science. 
Moreover, for wireless power transmission, a transparent and stretchable antenna based on silver nanofibers (AgNFs) was developed by Park's group.87,231 This antenna presents highly stretchable and transparent properties and can be integrated with functional devices such as rectifiers, LEDs, and glucose sensors and laminated on a soft contact lens to real-time monitor glucose concentration in tears (Fig. 13e).231 The antenna and rectifier circuit are used as the power transfer circuit that receives the power as an AC signal using the antenna and converts the AC signal to DC for powering LEDs and glucose sensors using a rectifier (Fig. 13f). For in vivo demonstration, the smart, soft contact lens was placed on a rabbit eye to wirelessly transfer power and monitor the increase of glucose concentration in real time (Fig. 13g).
Wireless energy transfer is quite promising for applications in wearable POCT systems. However, this approach has some limitations such as low transfer efficiency, requirement of an external power source, health safety issues at high frequency, and placement of the transmission loop close to the device for energy transfer. Therefore, development of a suitable power source for wearable POCT is an interesting topic of scientific research.


4.4.3. Wearable energy storage devices. 
Conventional rigid batteries have been widely used for powering wearable POCT systems. However, these batteries present drawbacks such as mechanical deformability, heavy weight, bulkiness, and generation of heat during operation. It is necessary to investigate alternative energy storage devices such as wearable supercapacitors and batteries for development of autonomous wearable POCT devices.
Normally, wearable supercapacitors (SCs) are developed via two approaches, planar-based SCs282–286 and fiber-based SCs.278,287–291 To achieve wearable SCs with high performance in output voltage, capacity, and energy density, the researchers have proposed new electrode materials with nanostructures such as conductive polymers,286 metal oxide nanostructures,292 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),293–295 graphene,282 reduced graphene oxide (rGO),296 and hybrid materials.284,285,288,290,291 To improve flexibility, stretchability, and stability under dynamic deformation, wearable SCs were also fabricated in various configurations such as wrinkled structures,297 3D structures,282 spring shape,287 helix shape,292 horizontally aligned fibers,285 and buckled structures.293,294 Moreover, using hydrogels as a gel electrolyte, wearable SCs not only provide ultrahigh mechanical stretchability, but also achieve repeated healable performance.283,297,298
Performance of wearable SCs suggests them as a candidate energy storage device for wearable power supplies. For practical applications in wearable POCT, however, wearable SCs are not suitable for power supplies due to their low energy density and low working voltage. Compared with wearable SCs, wearable batteries, which can provide high working voltage, high energy density, low memory effect, and good long-term stability, are believed to be an ideal wearable energy storage system for wearable POCT.
In recent reports, wearable batteries have been developed via three approaches; wearable Li-based batteries,275,287,299–304 multivalent-based batteries,276,305–309 and metal–air batteries.277,310–312 Wearable Li-based batteries presented lack of a memory effect and high energy density, promising for energy-storage systems in band- or patch-type wearable POCT systems. Some wearable Li-based batteries have been developed via designing materials and using structural engineering for mechanical deformability. For example, stretchable anodes based on graphitic carbon/Si foam via a wave/buckling process,300 porous 3D PDMS/rGO,275 and porous 3D PDMS/CNT299 were designed to fabricate stretchable electrodes. Arched anode and cathode structures on an elastic substrate,301 wavy structure,302 island-bridge structure,303 composite fiber of MWCNTs and lithium oxide,304 and CNT fiber spring287 were adopted to develop stretchable Li-based batteries.
Although wearable Li-based batteries are promising for powering wearable electronics, they present some limitations such as potential environmental hazard, high cost, and intrinsic safety issues for the wearer. To replace wearable Li-based batteries and overcome the aforementioned problems, researchers developed other metal-ion batteries, which can be divided into two groups of monovalent metal cations (Na+ and K+) and multivalent metal cations (Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, and Zn2+). Recently, some reports on wearable multivalent-based batteries, such as Zn–MnO2 and Zn–Ag2O, have been demonstrated.276,308 These devices with high performance in capacity, energy density, and stretchability were fabricated using new structural designs, novel materials for electrodes and electrolytes, and various fabrication processes. For example, off-the-shelf compliant Ag fabric as a current collector with embedded MnO2 and Zn particles was developed to fabricate a stretchable Zn–MnO2 battery.305 A highly stretchable Zn–MnO2 battery (3000%) has been demonstrated using double-helix yarn as electrodes and a polyacrylamide hydrogel as the electrolyte.306 A stretchable Zn–Ag2O battery was fabricated via a serpentine structure.307 The active materials were mixed with a poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene) binder to develop a stretchable Zn–Ag2O battery using screen printing.276 AgNWs were embedded into PDMS to use as an electrode for development of a stretchable Zn–Ag battery.308 A Ag–Zn tattoo battery with alkaline as gel electrolyte was developed via screen printed method.309 The multivalent-based batteries exhibited high chemical/electrochemical stability, low toxicity, low cost, and wearer friendliness but they have low working voltage and short cycle retention which limit their application in wearable electronics.
Wearable metal–air batteries are another candidate for powering wearable POCT systems. In a traditional structure, the device comprises a metal-anode, electrolyte, and catalytic air cathode with a porous structure. To develop wearable metal–air batteries, new device structures and novel materials have been proposed. For example, stretchable Zn–air batteries311 and Al–air batteries277 have been demonstrated by developing Zn and Al springs as anodes, and porous CNT/RuO2 and porous CNT/Ag hybrids as catalytic cathodes. A nonprecious metal catalyst was developed and used as the cathode for development of a cable-type flexible Zn–air battery.310 A stretchable Li–air battery was generated by sandwiching a gel electrolyte between a pre-strained anode (Li sheets) and a pre-strained cathode (CNT sheets).312


4.4.4. Wearable energy harvesters. 
The key to developing self-powered or autonomous wearable POCT systems is to ensure continuous supply of power for prolonged operation. To do this, wearable POCT systems should have a suitable scheme for energy harvesting and integration with an energy storage device to form a complementary source of power that can continuously supply power for wearable POCT systems for long-term monitoring applications. Many potential energy sources can be harvested, such as light energy, thermal energy, mechanical energy, and chemical energy from human fluid. There has been tremendous research activity to develop energy harvesters that can collect and convert these energy sources into electrical energy, such as photovoltaic cells, thermoelectric generators, piezoelectric generators, triboelectric generators, and BFCs. These devices can be fabricated in flexible and stretchable form factors and exhibit excellent performance for powering wearable devices.
Wearable photovoltaic (PV) cells. 
Light energy can be harvested by photovoltaic cells, which are fabricated from typical semiconductors to transform light energy into electricity. Wearable photovoltaic cells can be classified as inorganic-based,313,314 organic-based,124,315–321 dye-based,322–328 and perovskite-based.270,329–332 PV cells based on an inorganic semiconductor present excellent performance but are not easily applied to wearable electronics because of their low mechanical deformability, difficulty of fabrication at low temperature, and complex fabrication process. There are, however, some reports on flexible and stretchable inorganic-based PV cells. For example, a water-soluble germanium oxide sacrificial layer was developed to fabricate flexible and stretchable amorphous Si thin film solar cells using a transfer printing process.313 Using an island-bridge configuration, a stretchable PV system has been developed by mounting an array of dual-junction GaInP/GaAs microscale solar cells on PDMS islands and using buckled Ti/Au metallic as interconnects.314
Organic-based PV cells are flexible, low cost, and lightweight, indicating their promise for wearable energy harvesters. However, their poor energy conversion efficiency and instability under ambient conditions are challenges for use in wearable POCT applications. Considering the potential applications of organic-based PV cells as wearable power generators, investigators have focused on developing new materials, device structures, and configurations to enhance performance, flexibility, stretchability, and stability of such devices. For example, a bulk heterojunction organic-based PV cell was fabricated on an ultrathin PET substrate.315 A new electron donor and electron acceptor were developed and used to fabricate a flexible organic solar cell.316 A high-viscosity hydrophobic polymer was proposed as a processing additive in the flexible organic solar cell.317 A small amount of diiodooctane was added to the donor–acceptor blend to generate an intrinsically stretchable organic solar cell.318 A donor–acceptor polymer with air stability and high efficiency was developed and used as an active layer to demonstrate a stretchable, waterproof, and washable organic PV cell.320 A donor polymer that can maintain a sturdy microstructure at high temperature (120 °C) was used to fabricate an ultraflexible organic PV cell.321 Moreover, an ultraflexible organic PV cell with a PCE of 10.49% was developed via nano-grating morphologies.124
Perovskite-based PV cells with excellent performance are another promising candidate for development of future wearable power sources. However, the high-temperature process used to manufacture high-crystalline perovskite and the natural brittle property of perovskite crystals are expected to deter development of wearable large-area perovskite-based PV cells with good mechanical deformation. A flexible and small-area ITO-based electrode perovskite solar cell with a PCE of 16.09% has been developed, but its performance decreased under mechanical deformation.329 To protect against mechanical deformation, a flexible all-carbon-based electrode perovskite with a PCE of 11.9% was developed and showed almost no decrease in PCE at a bending radius of 4 mm.330 Moreover, using a nanocellular scaffold331 and brick-and-mortar structure,270 wearable, large-area, and ITO-free perovskite solar cells were demonstrated. These devices achieved a high PCE of 12.32% for the nanocellular scaffold331 and 15.01% for the brick-and-mortar structure.270
Wearable thermoelectric generators. 
Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can directly harvest heat energy and convert it into electrical power through the Seebeck effect. The performance of TEGs depends on the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT = S2σT/k, where S, σ, k, and T are the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, and the absolute temperature, respectively.333 Wearable TEGs that can harvest heat from a human body have been demonstrated via development of high-ZT materials and new device structures. Wearable TEGs can be classified into inorganic-based334–341 and organic-based.342,343
Inorganic-based TEGs provide high output power but have poor mechanical properties. Therefore, several new materials and device structures have been proposed to fabricate inorganic-based TEGs in flexible and stretchable form factors. For example, a flexible TEG was demonstrated based on inorganic p–n junctions such as Bi2Te3 (n-type) and Sb2Te3 (p-type),334 Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 (p-type) and Bi2Se0.3Te2.7 (n-type),335 and Bi0.3Sb1.7Te3 (p-type) and Bi2Se0.3Te2.7 (n-type).336 Using a heat sink, the power density of the wearable TEG was significantly improved.344,345 Therefore, a polymer-based heat sink was developed and attached to the cold side of the flexible TEG to reduce thermal resistance of the surroundings.337 Another approach to reduce thermal resistance of the surroundings was to fabricate TEGs in a 3D helical structure using planar transfer, deposition, patterning, and pre-stretching-relaxing techniques.338
Organic-based TEGs present low performance but are highly flexible, lightweight, low cost, and simple to fabricate. Therefore, there have been some reports on wearable organic TEGs to harvest energy from the temperature difference between the skin and the ambient environment. For example, a wearable TEG is proposed as vapor-printed conjugated polymer (p-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT-Cl)) films on fabrics.342 Moreover, by coating PEDOT on commercial textile via vapor phase polymerization, a wearable TEG has been developed.343
Wearable piezoelectric generators. 
Wearable piezoelectric generators (PEGs) can be worn on a human body to convert waste energy from human activity to electric energy via the piezoelectric effect. These devices were developed based on either organic (PVDF, P(VDF–TrFE)),346–348 inorganic (PZT, ZnO, BaTiO3),349–354 or organic–inorganic hybrid (BaTiO3/P(VDF–TrFE), ZnO/PVDF)271,355–358 piezoelectric materials. However, these materials have poor mechanical deformability, and most of the approaches to achieve PEGs in flexible and stretchable form factors are based on materials engineering or structural engineering.
To harvest energy from low-frequency (<1 Hz) mechanical activities of human, a wearable hybrid-fiber (ZnO nanowires (NWs) and PVDF) PEG was fabricated.271 Based on BaTiO3 NW–PVC hybrid fibers, a wearable fabric PEG was also developed.349 Furthermore, to harvest and store mechanical energy from motion of human organs, an ultrathin wearable PZT-based PEG has been developed and integrated with rectifiers and millimeter-scale batteries for simultaneous power generation and storage.350
In conventional wearable PEGs, the amount of harvested power is insufficient for achieving energy autonomy, and poor efficiency is observed in the low-frequency regime. These are the main obstacles for use as power sources for wearable POCT applications. Some recent approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of wearable PEGs. For example, wearable PEGs with a curved structure help to improve the distribution of applied force across the piezoelectric layer and allow operation in the low-frequency regime.346 High-performance flexible and stretchable PEGs were also demonstrated via materials engineering of piezoelectric materials such as a 3D cellular-structured lead zirconate titanate ceramic foam/PDMS composite351 and a stretchable PZT NPs/rubber composite.352 In another approach, a stretchable yarn PEG with high performance was demonstrated via development of novel triaxial braided PVDF yarn harvesters.347 Moreover, performance of wearable PEGs can be improved by optimizing the harvesting circuits.353
Wearable triboelectric generators. 
A triboelectric generator (TBEG) is another approach to convert mechanical energy from human movement into electricity via the triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction.359,360 The working principle of a TBEG relies on generation of triboelectric charges, produced when two materials with different polarities come into contact. A voltage difference can be generated when they are separated by mechanical motion.361,362 There are two key approaches to enhance the output performance, material selection and structural optimization.272,363–368
The properties of active materials (including work function, friction, and electron affinity) play important roles in the output performance of TBEGs. All materials can have a triboelectrification effect. Under contact electrification, different materials show different triboelectric charges. Based on these properties, proper pairing of the materials for TBEGs can produce high output performance. For development of wearable TBEGs, mechanical properties, stability, and biocompatibility should also be considered. Advanced materials such as graphene, paper,369 ionic conductor,370,371 AgNW composite,372 textile,373 nanofiber,374 and hydrogel375,376 were used to develop wearable TBEGs. For example, an ultrathin flexible paper-based TBEG was developed by laminating a layer of multi-hole paper with Cu coated on a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane.369 Using a melt-blending extrusion method, an advanced triboelectric material, polyaniline/poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) composite nanofiber membrane (PECNM), was developed for flexible TBEGs.377
Normally, flexible TBEGs are only responsive to pressing and bending modes, limiting their use to harvest of energy from multiple modes of mechanical stimuli from a human body. Therefore, it is necessary to develop stretchable TBEGs to improve the functionality and sustainability of a device capable of harvesting energy from human activities. A stretchable core sheath fiber-based TBEG was proposed using stretchable AgNWs/PU and AgNWs/PDMS as the electrode and triboelectric layer, respectively.372 In another approach, a transparent, stretchable TBEG was proposed based on a slime-based ionic conductor as the collection electrode.370 Using an elastomer as the electrification layer and an ionic hydrogel as the electrode, a transparent ultrastretchable TBEG was demonstrated.371 Moreover, a transparent, flexible TBEG was also developed using a polyionic hydrogel as the electrode and an elastomer as the electrification layer.375
Wearable biofuel cells. 
A BFC is an energy harvester that utilizes biofuels and noble metal catalysts to convert biochemical energy from metabolites (such as glucose, lactate, and uric acid) present in biofluids into electrical energy through redox reactions. In comparison with other energy harvesters, a BFC is a green energy harvester candidate, but it has limitations such as slow power generation, low output voltage, low power density, and poor stability. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the performance of BFCs for powering wearable POCT applications. Four factors can affect the power performance of BFCs, i.e., the amount of active enzyme, amount of chemical source, amount of redox mediator, and efficiency of electron transfer from the active enzyme to electrode. Researchers have focused on maximizing these factors to improve the performance of BFCs. For wearable applications, other aspects such as flexibility, stretchability, and durability of the device should be considered.
Many wearable BFCs have been developed by Wang's group.255,362–364 They proposed tattoo-based lactate BFCs for harvesting energy from human perspiration.378 The device was fabricated on temporary tattoo paper by a screen printing method. In principle, the LOx-functionalized bioanode catalyzes lactate oxidation to generate electrons. These electrons travel through an external circuit to the biocathode, where they are collected to reduce O2 by Pt catalyst and complete the electrical work (Fig. 14a). Tattoo-based lactate BFCs could be laminated on human skin to harvest biomedical energy from lactate produced during exercise (Fig. 14b). In another study, they developed stretchable glucose BFCs with a stretchability of 500% using a screen printing method to fabricate a stretchable, conductive CNT/PU composite in a serpentine structure as an electrode (Fig. 14c).273 They also used a screen printing method to develop textile-based lactate BFCs.379 This group also proposed a high-performance stretchable array of BFCs for harvesting energy from human sweat.380 To achieve high stretchability (100%), high open circuit voltage (0.5 V), and high power density (1.2 mW cm−2), CNTs with a 3D porous structure were used as an array anode and cathode and designed in an island-bridge architecture (Fig. 14d), maximizing loadings of active components, active surface area, charge transfer through electrodes, and stretchability. For demonstration, the array BFC was attached to human skin to harvest biomedical energy of lactate from sweat and used it to power an LED (Fig. 14e).

To improve the output performance of wearable BFCs, other groups have focused on development of advanced materials and novel device structures. For example, a wearable BFC with high power density (48 μW cm−2) was demonstrated using CNT fibers as electrodes (Fig. 14f).381 High performance of the device was achieved by modifying the anode with an acid-treated hydrophilic CNT layer as the mediator and a cathode with a PTFE-based hydrophobic CNT layer for adequate oxygen diffusion. This device demonstrated efficient proton transfer through the anode and improved oxygen transport from air supply to the cathode. In another study, flexible nanoporous gold is used as electrodes in lactate BFCs to help maximize enzyme loadings and increase power density.382 This device could be placed on commercially available contact lenses to harvest biomedical lactate energy from tears (Fig. 14g). Other high-power BFCs (2.18 mW cm−2) were also demonstrated based on biscrolled carbon nanotube yarns.383 High performance of BFCs can be achieved using a hydrophilic PEDOT coating on MWCNT electrodes and osmium-containing conducting polymers as redox mediators to enable high loadings of enzymes and redox mediators and enhance transfer between enzymes and electrodes, respectively. Enzymes (GOx for anode and bilirubin oxidase (BOD) for cathode) and redox mediators were simply inserted into a PEDOT-coated MWCNT sheet to produce biscrolled yarn electrodes for use in glucose BFCs (Fig. 14h). Moreover, high-power glucose BOFs were developed and high-conductivity metallic cotton fibers were used as electrodes.384 The metallic cotton fibers were formed by assembling AuNPs and GOx layer-by-layer onto cotton fibers (Fig. 14i).


4.4.5. Power-autonomous wearable POCT systems. 
The key component to develop a power-autonomous wearable POCT system is to ensure continuous energy to operate the system. Integrating a wearable energy harvester with wearable energy storage to form a wearable self-power source (SPC) for use in a wearable POCT system is a candidate solution. Many wearable SPCs have been developed by integrated PV cells,328,385–387 PEGs,388 TBEGs,325,389–392 or BFCs393 with supercapacitors and batteries. These SPCs have been demonstrated only for powering LEDs or an electronic watch.
There have been some developments in high-performance wearable SPCs to meet the power requirements of a fully integrated wearable POCT. For example, a high-performance wearable SPC has been developed by integrating a flexible amorphous-silicon PV module with a flexible lithium ion battery to power pulse oximetry (including optoelectronic probe and data processing and transmission electronics) (Fig. 15a and b).394 In another report, a fully integrated and energy autonomous smartwatch was proposed for continuous monitoring of glucose level in sweat.395 A wearable SPC consisting of flexible PV cells and Zn–MnO2 batteries was fabricated in the form of a watch strap and used as a continuous power source for a fully integrated smartwatch (including sweat glucose sensing, signal processing, and display) (Fig. 15c). For demonstration, this system was attached to a human body and used to monitor glucose concentration in sweat in real-time under indoor and outdoor conditions (Fig. 15d). Moreover, a wearable self-powered fall detection system was also demonstrated as a wristband-type SPC including a TBEG and lithium ion battery. The system was integrated with a three-axis accelerometer for fall detection, controllers for data processing, and a Bluetooth module for data transmission.396 The TBEG harvests energy from human motion and uses to recharge the battery. The energy generated by this SPC is sufficient to run a fully integrated system.

In general, the amount of power generated from SPCs is insufficient for achieving energy autonomy in wearable POCTs. For example, recently developed wearable POCTs are powered by lithium polymer batteries, which generate a voltage of 3.7 V35,64 and capacity from 20 to 200 mA h depending on size. This level of performance is much higher than those of the current state-of-the-art wearable energy storage device, though still not at the level desired. For application of SPCs in wearable POCTs, new materials and novel device structures should be developed. Moreover, facile integration with wearable POCT systems should be considered for practical applications.

5. Limitations, challenges, and prospects for mobile and wearable POCT systems
5.1. Mobile POCT systems
Overall improvement in detection accuracy and precision of various stages, including pre-analytical and analytical diagnostics, is the main concern in mobile POCT.397,398 The pre-analytical phase requires appropriate sample handling methods to reduce errors caused by sampling and management. Incorporation of a completely integrated or separate pre-analytical system could improve downstream processing of samples for analytical tests that use various detection methods. Sample pre-processing is another important factor that needs to be addressed, especially for quantifying target analytes from complex sample matrices.399 Certain complex samples, such as peripheral blood samples, which contain several kinds of cells, proteins, hormones, etc., need to be pre-processed or stabilized with chemicals to enable precise quantification of target analytes.400,401 Therefore, mobile POCT platforms require integration of separation devices and methods to enable detection of targets in biofluids without interference from other species present in the biofluid sample. Furthermore, when the target analyte is present in very low concentration, mobile POCT requires a suitable enrichment technique. This will particularly help with early disease prognosis by sensitively detecting pathologically important targets such as circulating tumor cells and bacteria, which are present in small numbers in the early stages of diseases. However, to be effective in personalized healthcare and resource-limited areas, sample pre-processing and enrichment devices need to be integrated into mobile POCT in a cost-effective and user-friendly manner.
From the perspective of analytical diagnostics, mobile POCT requires further development to significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostics (reduce false negatives and false positives, respectively) to provide results comparable to those from central laboratory-based assays.402–406 Securing high sensitivity and specificity is also critical for successful commercialization of mobile POCT technology in personal diagnostics and monitoring. To increase the specificity of POCT, it is important to remove possible causes of false positives, such as non-specific binding in the materials and sensor cartridges. When using newly developed probe molecules, it is very important that they demonstrate highly specific binding in real samples, even at very low concentrations. Hence, highly selective probes could be helpful in developing new assay methods that can eliminate false-positive results.
In addition to high specificity, high sensitivity can promote high-precision detection and monitoring of analytes, even when they are present in very low concentrations in body fluids. In particular, POCT systems based on LFA often lack assay sensitivity, especially for low-concentration targets. An important factor in improving the sensitivity of biosensing methods for probe–target interactions is the SNR. The SNR is one of the key elements to translate the biosensor's performance where low noise and higher signal can allow reading the smallest changes in the signals thereby enabling a lower limit of detection. A significant increase in SNR by reducing noise and/or amplifying signals by introducing nanomaterials can allow quantifying the target at lower concentrations, which in turn can enhance the sensitivity. Signal amplification can be achieved by introducing novel electrochemical or optical transducers, such as metal nanoparticles,407 carbon-based materials,55 magnetic nanoparticles,407 and molecular beacons.408 Signal enhancers can use a variety of signal amplification mechanisms, such as metal-enhanced fluorescence,409 Föster resonance energy transfer,410 the electrocatalytic effect,411 surface plasmon resonance (SPR),412 and CL,413 which have offered encouraging outcomes in diagnostics and bioimaging. Signal readout hardware for handheld mobile POCT devices, such as CMOS image sensors, often has poorer performance than laboratory-based hardware, so it is important not only to increase the sensing signal, but also to reduce the noise or background signal level using new materials, designing new sensing schemes, or improving the quality of the optical or electrical signal processing circuits and components. A higher probe density is another prerequisite for mobile POCT devices with a lower LOD and increased dynamic range. Many researchers have considered optical reporters or electrochemical electrodes modified with nanostructured materials (such as nanoparticles, nanosheets, nanowires, and nanorods) to improve binding kinetics and increase probe density.414 For example, the presence of 3D nanostructured materials in electrochemical biosensing applications increased the binding kinetics of very low-concentration targets and could significantly increase sensitivity and reduce assay time.205,415 However, integration of 3D structures in optical imaging-based detection techniques is limited by lack of devices that can provide 3D images to quantify changes on multi-planar surfaces.205 Therefore, development of novel materials and signal acquisition techniques is another important factor in mobile POCT. In any case, introduction of nanomaterials should be cost-effective and provide higher reliability, reproducibility, and long-term stability for successful integration with mobile POCT technology.
Enhancing the stability of probes can also provide benefits because a long shelf-life for probes is critical when using mobile POCT in resource-limited areas. The probes used in mobile POCT, such as antibodies, enzymes, and aptamers, can be significantly affected by environmental variations in temperature and humidity during transport. Developing and using synthetic probes, such as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), could solve that problem. MIPs are artificial structures that mimic bioreceptors and imitate probe–analyte binding.416,417 Such polymers can provide longer-term stability than biological probes, with remarkable stability over a range of solvents and temperatures. However, various limitations of MIPs have restricted their use and need to be addressed before they can be incorporated successfully in mobile POCT. Perhaps the most critical issue with MIPs is their low catalytic capabilities compared with biological probes such as antibodies and aptamers. The current imprinting techniques used for MIPs do not provide adequate selectivity and affinity toward the target analyte, which can strongly influence the accuracy of target analyte quantification. A high-fidelity process for developing MIPs for various target analytes could help increase the use of MIPs in mobile POCT.
In addition to integrating novel materials in mobile POCT, there is also a need to consider development of calibration-free sensors. Most existing sensor devices need to be re-calibrated because of variations caused by fabrication of sensors in different batches. Interestingly, a recent study showed that the sensitivity of mobile POCT can also be influenced by temperature and humidity.418 For example, a nearly three-fold signal enhancement was observed in smartphone-based colorimetric detection with an increase in humidity (>60%) and temperature (37–40 °C). Mobile POCT systems for field use will probably need internal environmental controls to ensure stability and reproducibility. Variations in biosensing parameters have been recognized as a substantial obstacle to widespread use of calibration-free mobile POCT systems that can produce clinically significant results. A few reports have been published on development of calibration-free biosensing techniques,419 but those techniques have not yet been effectively translated into fully integrated mobile POCT systems. Multiplexing calibration-free techniques to detect multiple analytes is another critical aspect of mobile POCT. For several diseases, correlations among physiological levels of multiple analytes need to be tested for accurate diagnosis. Therefore, another diagnostic challenge associated with POCT is the scarcity of fully integrated, high-throughput technology for multiplexed quantification of analytes.
5.2. Wearable POCT systems
Although many approaches have been used in development of wearable chemical or biochemical sensors, fully integrated wearable POCT systems remain rare. Fully integrated wearable POCT systems should satisfy the following requirements: (i) high sensitivity, specificity, stability, and reproducibility for commercialization and approval for biomedical use. These features are important to precisely confirm clinical findings and ensure that results are comparable with clinical and central laboratory findings. (ii) Sensor systems should simultaneously detect multiple analytes from a single sample, providing users with the maximum amount of information. (iii) Body-friendliness is important for user comfort. Mechanical flexibility, stretchability, and durability, as well as small size and thinness, will enable easy conformal attachment of sensors or whole systems. (iv) Low costs, disposable sensing units, automated operation, and user-friendliness are all high priorities in wearable POCT systems. (v) Continuous supply of energy for wearable POCTs should also be considered. To meet these requirements, there is a need for new materials and concepts for high performance and conformality; sample-handling devices that can induce, collect, and transport biofluids; minimization of motion-induced artifacts in sensing signals to ensure reliable signal readouts; integration of components in a body-friendly package; data analysis capability; and user-friendly software applications. Many components are being developed to meet a few of these requirements, but fully integrated systems that fulfill all requirements need to be further developed, as discussed below.

(1) Sensing devices. 
Wearable chemical or biochemical sensors for analyte detection in capillary blood, ISF, sweat, saliva, tears, and wound fluid have been developed and demonstrated using electrochemical and optical signal transduction. The most investigated optical transduction technique in wearable optical biosensors is colorimetry, which is attractive for its low cost, simplicity, and automated operation. For wearable colorimetric biosensors, conventional dyes are mixed with enzymes, ion indicators, or mesoporous resin beads and loaded onto filter paper or a polymer to form a sensing layer. The resulting systems suffer from relatively low detection sensitivity, low stability, and limitations in continuously analyzing a broad spectrum of analytes in biofluids. Therefore, developing novel materials with excellent signal indicators, high sensitivity, and good stability for wearable colorimetric biosensing is the next step in that direction. Those new materials should be able to detect not only metabolic analytes, but also proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, small molecules, pathogens, and cells in biofluids. Moreover, quantitative analysis of low-concentration analytes with high accuracy via a color change remains a challenge. To improve the sensitivity and specificity of quantitative analyses, wearable, optical biosensors that use fluorescence or SPR as the optical transduction technique could be good options because these techniques are up to 1000 times more sensitive than colorimetry, enabling single-bacterium and single-molecule detection.420 Moreover, they can greatly reduce false-negative signals to improve accuracy. However, for optical biosensing-based wearable POCT devices, a spectrometry system must be integrated with the sensing device in a wearable form.
Electrochemical methods are another strategy for developing wearable biochemical sensors. The most common enzymatic wearable biosensors are electrochemical because they offer unique advantages in miniaturization, high selectivity, and label-free direct measurement. However, enzymatic wearable biosensors have exhibited some disadvantages, such as lack of stability; low sensitivity; vulnerability to changes in environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and humidity; and complicated fabrication processes. These limitations can affect the accuracy and reliability of continuous measurements as well as the ability to detect the low concentrations of analytes present in body fluids. To address these problems, novel working electrodes made of noble metals or modified with nanomaterials, which present a high surface-to-volume ratio and high electron mobility, could enhance electrochemical activity and strengthen enzyme immobilization, accelerate electron transfer, reduce SNR, and improve the sensitivity of biosensor devices. However, most such sensors require further optimization in terms of sensor reliability, reproducibility, stability, accuracy, body-friendliness, and cost-effectiveness, along with assessments in human trials, before they can be applied to wearable POCT for personal use.
Recently, many nonenzymatic electrochemical sensors have been developed for detection of metabolites and electrolytes, using working electrodes with nanostructured materials and presenting high sensitivity, with reported limits of detection of 0.5 nM421 and good stability through reduced vulnerability to environmental changes. Therefore, developing nonenzymatic electrochemical sensors in wearable form could also be a future direction for wearable POCT. However, the low selectivity, fouling, and cost-effectiveness of nonenzymatic electrochemical sensor devices need to be improved.
Radio frequency (RF)-based sensing devices are another approach to develop wearable biochemical sensors.422 The sensing mechanism of these devices is based on the change of RF resonance with analyte concentration. This approach is promising for application in wearable POCT due to its simple structure, low-cost, battery-free, and smartphone-communicable features. In recent years, some RF-based wearable biochemical sensors have been developed.423–426 And, they are still limited to detection of a single analyte. Development of RF-based wearable biochemical sensors with multiplexing and fully integrated wearable POCT systems will be next generation.
Most of the currently developed wearable sensors focus on continuous real-time or intermittent detection of simple analytes, such as metabolites and electrolytes, in body fluids. However, it is also necessary to develop wearable biosensing devices that can detect other targets in biofluids, including proteins, hormones, nucleic acids, small molecules, and pathogens. Those targets should be detected through probe–target binding assays using probes such as antibodies or aptamers. Such devices could provide more abundant information about each sample for screening and early diagnosis of a broad range of major health conditions. The main hurdles for detecting these species are their extremely low concentrations in sweat, ISF, and other biofluids compared with whole blood; challenges with continuous measurements caused by difficult elution of bound targets in a probe–target binding protocol; difficulty of supplying reagents and washing buffer to a wearable device; and difficulty in handling biofluids. Furthermore, multi-step preparation protocols and incubation waiting times also must be addressed. Developing wearable POCT devices that contain binding-based biosensors to detect targets other than metabolites and ions for personal use will require label-free approaches that do not need reagents and wash-free methods to reduce the time consumed. Improvements to sensitivity and specificity of detection are also required for wearable POCT, as for mobile POCT. If the goal of wearable POCT is diagnosis and understanding of human health using the concentrations of analytes in sweat, tears, saliva, or IFS, correlations between target analyte levels in these biofluids and those in whole blood must be considered.


(2) Sampling methods. 
The sampling technique plays an important role in development of wearable POCT for personal use. Sample handling methods should make it easy to collect a certain volume of sample for quantification, store enough sample for sensing, control fluid flows for sample pre-treatment and transport to the sensing area, minimize evaporation, eliminate contamination, reduce sampling intervals, and induce biofluid samples in a sedentary environment. Some non-invasive and minimally invasive sampling methods have been developed, as discussed above, but not all those requirements have been achieved in a single method. For example, absorption pads can only collect samples and cannot store samples, control fluid flows, eliminate contamination, or control sampling intervals. Microfluidic platforms and oil/membrane devices might solve some of these problems, but they cannot induce samples. All these limitations could be addressed by combining sample collecting/transport devices with inducing devices, such as iontophoresis or reverse iontophoresis, which can locally stimulate sweat and ISF in a sensing channel via a current applied across the skin. However, the applied current density must be low enough to prevent electrode corrosion and skin irritation, which can cause user discomfort. Minimally invasive access to the ISF and capillary blood though a microneedle array has shown potential for biofluid extraction. However, flowing a current though the skin or piercing the skin with microneedles causes some discomfort to users, and the rate of sample induction remains quite low. Integrating sample induction, collection, transport, and storage seamlessly into a small, body-friendly form is not trivial. It will require new functional materials and components, such as mechanical matching with a sensing unit. Therefore, developing alternate methods for sample induction, collection, and transportation will be necessary to enable on-body measurement of targets other than metabolites and ions by wearable POCT. Furthermore, automated sample-to-answer protocols for simple one-point measurements need to be developed.


(3) Signal processing unit. 
The signals obtained from sensors should be properly processed and transmitted to an external device for analysis and display. Electronic circuit boards have been developed for these functions. However, signal processing, signal analysis, data processing, and data display should be seamlessly integrated at the wearable-system level. Normally, signal processing circuitry is based on commercially available integrated-circuit chips, but all those chip components are rigid, hindering seamless integration at the wearable-system level. To interface with wearable sensors that can easily conform to the human body, rigid device components have been consolidated onto flexible printed circuits to form signal processing circuitry. For user comfort, we expect the development of signal processing circuitry with high flexibility/stretchability, small size, and light weight. New packaging technology, such as flexible or stretchable fan-out packages, needs to be adopted. In signal processing, the signals collected from biofluids by wearable sensors are converted into recordable data, and that signal processing can easily be affected by inherent and ambient noises, including bodily motions during activities, which can obstruct the accuracy of wearable POCT. Therefore, signal processing should reduce noise effects from various origins. Raw data can be processed, analyzed, and calibrated by internal processors and then transferred to an external device for display or can be transferred directly to an external device for processing and display. In both cases, a wireless system is used for data transmission. In integrated wearable chemical or biochemical sensors, BLE and NFC have been commonly used to transmit data. However, those devices have some limitations, such as large power consumption by BLE, requirement for close proximity to the data receiver, and low-density data transmission. Therefore, data transmission devices with ideal connectivity are needed for continued development of wearable POCT. Computing devices such as laptops and smartphones are commonly used as data handling units that process digitized signals from the sensor and display the results in real time, providing remote control of both the sensor system and sampling device. Therefore, a software application with efficient algorithms and a user-friendly display is also required for wearable POCT devices. For mathematical calculations, digital processing and calibration of sensor data are performed by an external device, which requires software applications to be carefully designed to convey relevant, useful, and interpretable information to users.


(4) Power supply. 
Continuous supply of energy is a key toward an energy-autonomous wearable POCT device. Energy harvesters integrated with energy storage devices to form SPCs, which is promising for continuously powered wearable POCT, have been developed. However, the SPCs have limitations such as insufficient output power for achieving energy autonomy and large size leading to engineering complexity for integration in wearable POCT systems. Therefore, for applications of wearable POCT, new materials and novel device structures to fabricate high-performance SPCs should be further developed. Moreover, facile integration with wearable POCT systems should be considered.


(5) Integration. 
As discussed above, on-body, wearable POCT systems contain at least three components: the sensor device, sampling device, and data processing and readout unit. Mechanical mismatches among these components and the different form factors limit seamless integration with the skin, giving rise to wearability challenges and SNR limitations. Some methods have been developed to reduce the existing technological gap in integration of many components in a wearable biosensor system. The challenge remains to produce wearable systems that deliver the required sensitivity, selectivity, reliability, automaticity in operation, and real-time continuous monitoring. Likewise, integrating all these components into a small and wearable form is a considerable challenge.

6. Conclusions
Mobile POCT combined with nano-diagnostic technology has been successfully introduced and applied to detection of analytes ranging from biomolecules (proteins, hormones, and nucleic acids) to bacteria and viruses that cause infectious diseases. This review summarized recent trends in development of fully integrated mobile POCT for personal healthcare and highlighted challenges in achieving highly accurate, cost-effective, user-friendly, and calibration-free diagnostics. With an emphasis on sample-to-answer mobile POCT technology, we discussed in detail smartphone and standalone mobile systems that use miniaturized optical or electrochemical readout modules based on LFA or microfluidics with plastic, textile, or paper materials. Smartphones have been used extensively as data processing and optical detector units because they have several intrinsic features that make them suitable for biosensing applications such as fully integrated POCT systems. Smartphone-based POCT has advantages over conventional strategies such as high portability, full automation, high computing power, a built-in CMOS camera, wireless connectivity, and easy customization of service applications for personalized and in-field diagnosis and monitoring. Remaining challenges for mobile POCT-based diagnostics technology for personal healthcare include accuracy, user-friendliness, and cost-effectiveness; thus, multidisciplinary efforts are required by researchers in materials science, chemistry, and biotechnology.
We also summarized and highlighted recent approaches to development of fully integrated wearable POCT systems for continuous, real-time health monitoring and diagnostics. Fully integrated wearable POCT systems contain a sample handling device for inducing and collecting biofluids, biosensor devices for detection of analytes, a signal processing unit, and software to control system operations, process data, and communicate with off-body devices. Such integrated systems have been developed in different wearable forms (bands, patches, tattoos, accessories, bandages, and wound dressings) that provide non-invasive or minimally invasive sampling for on-body detection of analyte levels in biofluids such as sweat, ISF, blood, saliva, tears, and wound fluid. Measurement data are transmitted to off-body devices containing software applications that can remotely control the on-body devices and display sensing outcomes in real time, allowing users to monitor their health status or send diagnostic data to healthcare providers.
Even though considerable progress has been achieved in developing integrated wearable biosensor devices for personal use, many unresolved challenges remain. Fully integrated, wearable POCT devices for self-testing would involve heterogeneous and seamless integration of a biosensor device, sampling device, and signal processing unit into small, body-friendly, wearable forms that operate automatically, unobtrusively, and continuously to monitor the wearer's health and diagnose diseases. Wearable POCT systems with multiplexing capability based on a wide range of sensor arrays should exhibit high sensitivity, specificity, stability, and reproducibility to ensure that they provide reliable and actionable data for analysis and therapy. Sampling devices must be able to induce biofluids such as sweat or ISF in sedentary conditions with low fluctuations and high correlation with blood sample results. In the signal processing unit and software, big data analytics and machine learning could be used to parse and calibrate the vast data collected from wearable POCT systems. High-density data transmission systems could communicate the results from wearable integrated POCT systems to off-body devices for real-time, user-friendly outcome displays.
