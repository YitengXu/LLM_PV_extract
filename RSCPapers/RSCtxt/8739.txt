Supercapacitors (SCs), also known as electrochemical capacitors, are widely studied for their high power density, fast charge and discharge and long cycle life. Rare earth is a group of elements with unique structure and properties. Rare earth-based nanomaterials, especially rare earth oxides, hydroxides and sulfides, have attracted much attention due to their good redox properties and environmentally friendly characteristics.

1. Introduction
With the rapid development of the economy, the overconsumption of fossil fuels has resulted in a great demand for energy.1–3 Therefore, a sustainable and low-cost way to store energy more efficiently has been explored in recent years. On the one hand, new energy sources such as wind, tidal, and solar are intermittent and cannot provide stable power output. Therefore, energy storage devices need to be developed to store energy. On the other hand, the operation of industry and even human society requires electrical energy. Energy storage devices have become an indispensable part of life.4–6 Equipment such as computers, mobile phones, and electric vehicles all require electrical energy. In order to meet the increasing energy storage needs, a series of energy storage devices have been developed, such as lithium-ion batteries, lead-acid batteries, and supercapacitors (SCs).7,8 SCs, also called ultracapacitors and electrochemical capacitors, compared with other storage devices, have a longer cycle life (>500000 cycles), higher power density (5–10 kW kg−1), and a broader range of working temperature (−40 to 70 °C).9,10 Furthermore, they are widely used in automotive and portable electronic products due to their long cycle life, low self-discharge characteristics, environmental friendliness, and safety.11
Based on the charge storage mechanism, SCs are classified into electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.12,13 EDLCs mainly generate storage energy by adsorbing on the surface of the electrode and pure electrostatic charge. Carbon-based materials such as activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and carbon fibers are the main EDLC electrode materials.14,15 The advantages of carbon-based materials are a high specific surface area, low cost, and high chemical stability. The energy storage in pseudocapacitors is due to a Faraday redox reaction between the electrolyte and the electroactive surface of the electrode material. Transition metal oxides and conductive polymers are commonly used as pseudocapacitor electrodes. Pseudocapacitors deliver a high specific capacitance when compared with EDLCs.
Currently, the main goal of portable energy storage device development is to prepare energy storage devices that can output high energy and power density. Among the various components of a supercapacitor, the electrode has the greatest influence on its electrochemical performance. Most metal compound electrodes are transition metals such as transition metal oxides,16–18 transition metal hydroxides,19,20 and transition metal sulfides.21,22 Because of their variable valence, they provide ideal pseudocapacitance. The structure, conductivity, and loading of the material on the electrode have a critical impact on the pseudocapacitance of the electrode. An electrode material with excellent performance can be obtained by doping, compounding, or even changing the preparation method. Besides, nanostructured electrode materials have attracted the attention of researchers in recent years. Nanostructured electrode materials can shorten the diffusion/transport pathway of ions and electrons and increase the number of active sites, which greatly improves their electrochemical performance. A great deal of research has been conducted to explore new nanoelectrode materials with high performance.
Rare-earth (RE) elements consist of 15 lanthanide elements (from lanthanum La to lutetium Lu) with unique 4f electron configurations, and the elements scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y).23,24 RE elements have various valences, of which trivalent rare-earth ions (RE3+) are the most common. The unpaired 4f electrons of RE3+ are typically not involved in chemical bonding and therefore have unique properties in terms of energy storage.25 In recent years, rare-earth based nanomaterials and their composites have gradually attracted researchers' attention due to their controllable structure, excellent physical and chemical properties, and unique unpaired 4f electronic configuration. Most of the RE elements (Ce, Nd, Pr, Sm, etc.) have either RE3+/RE2+ or RE4+/RE3+ redox couples. This indicates that RE-based electrochemical energy storage is thermodynamically available. Some redox couples (Ce4+/Ce3+, Sm3+/Sm2+, Eu3+/Eu2+, etc.) with appropriate potentials can be used as redox-active components in SCs. At present, the most studied rare-earth based nanomaterials are rare earth oxides, rare earth sulfides, rare earth hydroxides and their composites. Rare-earth based nanomaterials with significant electrochemical properties can be obtained by environmentally friendly, economical and scalable synthetic methods such as the hydrothermal method, co-precipitation method, sol–gel.
However, compared with other transition metal oxides (such as NiO, Co3O4 and MnO2), the specific capacitance of rare-earth based nanomaterials is relatively low (200–300 F g−1).26,27 In addition, the characteristics of rare-earth based nanomaterials, such as poor conductivity, a low specific surface area, and poor cycle stability, limit their applications in SCs. Luckily, the electronic conductivity of rare-earth based nanomaterials can be improved simply by modifying their shape and size, whereas other metal oxides need to couple with conductive phases. Besides, nanostructuring rare-earth based materials boost their surface area to volume ratio to a very large amount, which allows them to expose more active sites. The exposure of active sites and high-energy crystal planes with a specific morphology can make the reduction and oxidation of the material easy, thus having a more durable cycle life.25 Furthermore, by combining with other transition metal oxides, the pseudocapacitance and cycle performance of rare-earth based nanomaterials can also be increased. For example, Wei et al. successfully prepared a porous Co3O4–CeO2 hollow polyhedron, which showed a high specific capacitance of 1288.3 F g−1 at 2.5 A g−1 with a capacitance loss of less than 3.3% after 6000 cycles.28
It is worth noting that the poor conductivity of rare-earth based nanomaterials is the most important factor limiting their application in SCs.29 The conductivity can be improved by preparing porous materials, compounding, doping, etc.30,31 To increase the conductivity of rare-earth based nanomaterials, Luo et al. prepared CeO2/CNTs composites. CNTs can greatly improve the electrical conductivity of the composite so that the composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance (818 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1).32 Besides, the controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies can also improve the conductivity of rare-earth based nanomaterials.33,34 Prasanna et al. improved the conductivity of CeO2 by forming oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2.35 The material structure, conductivity, electrolyte and material loading mass on the electrode has a crucial effect on the pseudocapacitance of the material. We can improve supercapacitive performance by doping, compounding, controlling the structure of materials, and even developing new rare-earth based nanomaterials. To our knowledge, the reviews on rare-earth based nanomaterials for SCs are fairly rare. So as to promote future breakthroughs in this field, our review comprehensively introduces the application of various rare-earth based nanomaterials for SCs and discusses the challenges and opportunities faced by the future development of this material.
2. Structure and electrochemical reaction mechanism
2.1 Rare earth oxides
Rare earth oxides such as CeO2 and La2O3 are typical pseudocapacitor materials. CeO2 is a new and challenging electrode material for SCs. CeO2 belongs to fluorite type (CaF2) oxides, and its unit cell structure is shown in Fig. 1a. Ce4+ in the fluorite unit cell is arranged according to a face-centered cubic lattice, and O2− occupies all tetrahedral positions composed of Ce4+. Each Ce4+ is surrounded by eight O2−, and each O2− coordinates with four Ce4+ to form many octahedral vacancies.36–38 Ce can not only lose one 5d and two 6s electrons to form a stable Ce3+ but also can lose an extra 4f electron to generate a 4f vacant state, thereby generating stable Ce4+. Besides, CeO2 can store charge by fast conversion between Ce4+ and Ce3+. With the participation of basic cations, the electronic charge storage of CeO2 involves two processes: (i) the adsorption/desorption of M+ ions on the CeO2 surface and (ii) the intercalation/deintercalation of M+ ions on the CeO2 surface. It can be expressed by the following equations:39,40

Non-faradaic:(CeO2)surface + M+ + e− ↔ (CeO2·M)surface
Faradaic:CeO2 + M+ + e− ↔ CeOOMwhere M+ represents an alkali metal cation (Na+, K+, etc.). The pseudocapacitive performance of CeO2 largely depends on its particle size, defect state and morphology. The presence of oxygen vacancies facilitates the progress of the redox reaction. Kumar et al. investigated the influence of the Ce3+ valence state, solvothermal reaction time and surface oxygen vacancies on the electrochemical performance of CeO2.41 As shown in Fig. 1e, CeO2 shows a typical surface pseudo-capacitance behavior with rectangular cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves. The increase of the reaction time makes the oxygen vacancies increase, which makes the material show better electrochemical performance (Fig. 1b and f).
Although CeO2 has good redox properties, its structural stability is poor. When Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+, its lattice always expands. In addition, CeO2 has poor conductivity (2.48 × 10−8 S cm−1), which reduces its electron transport efficiency and cycle stability. In order to meet the requirements of high-performance SCs, and have good capacitance performance, rate performance, energy density and cycle stability, CeO2 needs to be compounded with carbon materials or other metal oxides. For example, Padmanathan et al. synthesized porous NiO–CeO2 composites by the sol–gel method.42 Compared with pure NiO and CeO2, the composite shows better specific capacitance (305 F g−1) and remains stable in repeated cycles with a good capacity retention rate.
In addition to CeO2, La2O3 pseudocapacitor materials have also been reported. They have a cubic bixbyite structure, exhibiting alternative layers of RE3+ and O2−. The crystal structure of La2O3 is similar to that of Y2O3 (Fig. 1c). They both belong to RE2O3 type rare earth oxides. The charge storage of La2O3 involves the intercalation and deintercalation of cations at the interface of La2O3 and the electrolyte. It can be represented as:43,44La2O3 + 2M+ + 2e− ↔ La2O3M2where M+ represents an alkali metal cation (Na+, K+, Li+, etc.). Yadav et al. synthesized La2O3 thin film electrode materials via a simple, cost-effective chemical bath deposition (CBD) method.45 The materials exhibited an excellent cycle stability of 96% over 2000 cycles, which can be attributed to the three-dimensional (3D) irregular rods covered by the surface of the La2O3 film. This rod-like morphology provides a large surface area for electrochemical reactions. Moreover, their random distribution provides space for the movement of electrolyte ions.
2.2 Rare earth sulfides
In the research of rare earth sulfides, the most researched and in-depth research, the most widely used is rare earth sesquisulfide, which can be expressed as RE2S3. It is a type of wide bandgap semiconductor material whose bandgap can be adjusted by doping. RE2S3 has a complex structure and generally has different crystal forms. For example, light rare earth RE2S3 has three different crystal forms, such as α, β, and γ, while heavy rare earth RE2S3 has multiple crystal forms such as δ, ε, and τ. The three crystal forms of RE2S3, α, β and γ, can be transformed by controlling the temperature.  
The α phase is a low-temperature phase, which belongs to an orthorhombic system and has an exact stoichiometric ratio.46 The β phase is a tetragonal crystal system, which is relatively complicated. It is generally considered to be an oxygen-containing sulfide, and its composition can be expressed as RE10S14OxS1−x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm).47 The γ phase is a high-temperature phase and belongs to the cubic system. Its composition changes between RE2S3 and RE3S4.48 So far, α-Ce2S3, α-La2S3, and α-Sm2S3 have been used in SCs, which can be represented by α-Ln2S3 (Ln = Ce, La, Sm). The electronic charge storage of α-Ln2S3 involves two processes,49
The first is non-faradaic: the adsorption/desorption process of the cations on the surface of the Ln2S3 electrode.(Ln2S3)surface + M+ + e− ↔ (Ln2S3M)surface
The second one is faradaic charge transfer: the intercalation/deintercalation process of cations on the surface of the Ln2S3 electrode.Ln2S3 + M+ + e− ↔ Ln2S3Mwhere M+ represents an alkali metal cation (Li+ or Na+ or K+).
2.3 Rare earth hydroxides
Typical rare earth hydroxide, such as La(OH)3 and Nd(OH)3, are hexagonal crystal systems. Fig. 1d shows the crystal structure of Gd(OH)3. Hexagonal RE(OH)3 (h-RE(OH)3) nanostructures have been synthesized by a variety of methods, such as precipitation, microemulsion, and hydrothermal methods. Recent studies have shown that metal hydroxides have higher theoretical specific capacitances than their corresponding oxides. Unlike other hydroxides, h-RE(OH)3 is difficult to delaminate due to the strong affinity between the interlayer anions and the host layer. To promote the delamination of h-RE(OH)3, a long-chain surfactant (such as dodecyl sulfate) is required for pre-intercalation.50,51 Compared with rare earth oxides and rare earth sulfides, h-RE(OH)3 is more likely to form a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure due to its unique structure, so it can increase active sites for electrochemical reactions. h-RE(OH)3 stores charge through deprotonation/protonation (i.e. O–H bond breaking/reconstitution) reactions with the participation of OH− in the electrolyte. The faradaic redox reaction can be represented as follows:52REOOH + 2OH− ↔ REO(OH)3− + e−
3 Rare earth oxides
3.1 Cerium dioxide and composites

3.1.1 Cerium dioxide. 
Among various rare-earth based nanomaterials used in SCs, rare earth oxides, especially CeO2, have been extensively studied. The ground state valence of Ce is 4f15d16s2. It not only forms steady Ce3+ by losing one 5d and two 6s electrons but also forms stable Ce4+ by losing one extra 4f electron.53,54 CeO2 can store energy using mutual electronic transition between Ce3+ and Ce4+, and its performance depends largely on the particle size, defect states and morphology. More importantly, due to the richness in nature, excellent redox characteristics, and low cost, CeO2 is used as a pseudocapacitor electrode material for SCs.55,56 The research results of CeO2 for SCs in recent years are shown in Table 1.

A smaller hexagonal structure can provide a larger exposed surface area and more active sites for the redox process of the material, thereby greatly improving its charge storage capacity. Furthermore, hexagonal nanostructures can provide shorter ion diffusion paths, which will provide more efficient electron transport continuity and good performance. Maheswari et al. used hexagonal CeO2 as an electrode material for SCs.57 Hexagonal CeO2 nanostructures have been prepared via the hydrothermal method employing the cationic surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) (Fig. 2a). The use of CTAB ensures a slow rate of hydrolysis to form small-sized hexagonal CeO2 nanostructures. Hexagonal CeO2 expressed high specific capacitance (927 F g−1 at 2 A g−1). CeO2 was used as the positive electrode and AC was used as the negative electrode to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). CeO2//AC showed an energy density of 45.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 187.5 W kg−1. Besides, the device has almost no loss of capacitance after 1000 cycles, indicating its outstanding stability for energy storage applications. The hexagonal morphology of CeO2 and the high mobility of electrolyte ions allow ions to be transported quickly, which makes SCs maintain longer cycle life. In another study, Maheswari et al. synthesized hexagonal CeO2 nanoparticles through the hydrothermal method using CTAB as the surfactant.58 They studied the electrochemical behavior of hexagonal CeO2 nanoparticles in different electrolytes, such as NaCl, KCl, Na2SO4, and K2SO4. They found that the capacitance values obtained with various electrolytes are in the order of NaCl > Na2SO4 > KCl > K2SO4 and a maximum specific capacitance of 523 F g−1 was attained with the NaCl electrolyte at 2 mV s−1. After 2000 cycles of charging and discharging, only 18% degradation in the specific capacitance could be observed.

Kumar et al. investigated the influence of the Ce3+ valence state, solvothermal reaction time and surface oxygen vacancies on the electrochemical performance of CeO2.41 They used the solvothermal method to prepare two different sizes of CeO2 nanoparticles. When the reaction time is 20 h, the as-prepared CeO2 exhibited a smaller particle size. An electrochemical test showed that CeO2 exhibited a specific capacitance of 142.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.25 A g−1 in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The reason for the improved electrochemical performance of CeO2 can be attributed to the high specific surface area, the reduction in particle size and the presence of oxygen vacancies. Electrode materials having a high specific surface area and a small particle size can provide more active sites for the Faraday reaction. Almost at the same time, Prasanna et al. reported that porous CeO2 nanostructures which showed good electrochemical performance can be prepared by a fast and cost-effective combustion approach.35 They increased the conductivity of CeO2 by forming oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2 without the addition of conductive materials. The presence of oxygen vacancies creates a new gap state, which causes the electrons associated with the Ce–O bonds to delocalize, thereby greatly increasing the conductivity. The as-prepared porous CeO2 has a specific surface area of 181.81 m2 g−1, which enables the rapid diffusion of ions and electrons. Furthermore, the CeO2 nanostructures exhibited an initial specific capacitance of 134.6 F g−1 and superior cycling stability of 92.5% after 1000 cycles at a constant current density of 1 A g−1.
CeO2 with different morphologies has different active sites and specific surface areas, which results in great differences in their electrochemical performance. To explore the effect of morphology on charge storage capacity, Jeyaranjan et al. synthesized CeO2 with three different morphologies (nanorods, nanocubes, and nanoparticles) by a one-step hydrothermal process (Fig. 2c).59 Compared to nanocubes and nanoparticles, the CeO2 nanorods showed higher specific capacitance. Furthermore, the CeO2 nanorods showed an excellent cycling stability of 90.1% after 1000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of CeO2 nanorods can be attributed to the following reasons: (i) the high specific surface area exposes more redox-active sites and contributes to pseudocapacitive charge storage; (ii) the morphology in which the high energy crystal face is exposed is easily reduced and oxidized, and thus it has a high charge storage capacity (Fig. 2b).
Nanostructures have a significant impact on the performance of pseudocapacitors.60 The specific surface area and morphology are the two most important parameters affecting the pseudocapacitive performance of metal oxides. In order to reach the theoretical capacitance of the material as much as possible, utilizing the maximum possible surface along with fast redox kinetics would be required. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed from metal ions or clusters and organic linkers, can provide a large specific surface area. The nano-sized cavities and open channels of these materials facilitate the entry and escape of small molecules, which makes MOFs an ideal sacrifice template.61,62 Maiti et al. successfully fabricated CeO2 nanorods with a length of 0.5–1.0 μm by utilizing a simple [Ce(1,3,5-BTC)(H2O)6] (1,3,5-BTC = 1,3,5-benzene-tricarboxylate) MOF followed by a calcination process.63 It can be seen from Fig. 2d that the specific capacitance of the CeO2 nanorods is 502 F g−1 in 3 M KOH at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. Such a high capacitance (92% of its theoretical value) can be attributed to the unique brick-upon-tile morphology of the MOF derived CeO2. At the same time, this unique morphology makes the as-prepared sample exhibit a specific surface area of 77 m2 g−1. In addition, when 1 M NaCl was added to 3 M KOH, the electrode exhibited excellent stability up to 5000 charge–discharge cycles with nearly 100% capacity retention rate (Fig. 2e). The coexistence of structural pores and inter-particle pores increases the contact area of the active material with the electrolyte, which makes the prepared CeO2 exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. Zeng and coworkers used a Ce-BTC MOF as a sacrificial template to synthesize layered dumbbell-shaped CeO2 structures at room temperature.39 The effect of different electrolytes on the electrochemical performance of CeO2 was studied. Interestingly, the addition of 0.1 M K4Fe(CN)6 into a 2 M KOH electrolyte resulted in a remarkably high capacitance of 779 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the electrode possessed a specific capacitance of only 9% after 10000 cycles of charging and discharging. The reason for the increase in the electrochemical performance of the electrode can be attributed to the larger surface area, which facilitates the rapid transfer of ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface.


3.1.2 Cerium dioxide/compound-carbon composites. 
As a typical rare earth oxide, CeO2 has a wide range of applications in SCs. However, the pure CeO2 electrode exhibited low specific capacitance and poor long-term performance due to its low conductivity.64 To improve the conductivity of CeO2, many researchers have combined CeO2 with carbon-based materials, such as graphene40 and CNTs.65 The electrochemical properties of some CeO2 complexes are shown in Table 2.

AC is used in SCs because of its advantages such as low cost, easy preparation, good electrical conductivity, and large specific surface area. Besides directly being used as an electrode material for EDLCs, AC can also be used as a 3D support for pseudocapacitive materials. Aravinda et al. prepared a CeO2/AC composite by a simple solvent and binder-free scalable mechanical mixing method.66 The electrode showed a specific capacitance of 162 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−2 in a two-electrode system and a high energy density of 4.86 W h kg−1 with a power density of 3.5 kW kg−1. After that, Padmanathan et al. prepared carbon-coated CeO2 nanorods by the hydrothermal method using urea and D-glucose.67 Carbon-loaded CeO2 nanorods have shorter ion diffusion paths and more active surface sites. More importantly, the carbon coating on CeO2 nanorods enhances their electrochemical kinetics and improves specific capacitance and cycle stability. BET analysis showed that the carbon-coated CeO2 nanorods have a specific surface area of 36.2 m2 g−1, which is higher than that of CeO2 hexagonal nanoplates (29.3 m2 g−1). The increase in the specific surface area is due to the carbon encapsulation of the CeO2 nanorods, which promotes the rapid transfer of ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The carbon-supported CeO2 nanorods showed a high capacitance of 644 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. 3d) and excellent cycle stability (90.4% after 2000 cycles). Furthermore, the carbon-coated CeO2 can still provide a specific capacitance of up to 400 F g−1 at a high current density of 20 A g−1.

Graphene is a single atomic layer thick planar sheet composed of carbon atoms. Due to its large specific surface area (2630 m2 g−1, theoretical value), high conductivity (26000 S cm−1), and good mechanical properties, it has become an attractive EDLC electrode material.68,69 Graphene has the potential to build flexible SCs due to its unique sp2 hybridization. Graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) derived from chemical treatment of graphene have advantages in chemical processability and can form composites with CeO2. Dezfuli et al. prepared CeO2/rGO by anchoring CeO2 on the rGO plate by the sonochemical method.70 The sonication makes CeO2 grains grow slower, resulting in a decrease in particle size. Besides, ultrasound helps promote the self-assembly process of rGO. Electrochemical studies showed that CeO2/rGO prepared by the sonochemical method exhibits a specific capacitance of 211 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1. The cycling stability test showed that the capacitance of the electrode increased by 5.2% after 5000 cycles, indicating its excellent cycle life. In another study, Heydari et al. prepared CeO2/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (CeO2/NRGO) composites by depositing CeO2 on NRGO by the sonochemical method.71 CeO2/NRGO possessed a specific capacitance of 230 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1. Besides, CeO2/NRGO has a specific capacitance retention rate of 94.1% after 4000 cycles, indicating its promising potential as an efficient electrode material for SCs. Based on previous work, Li and coworkers reported CeO2/rGO nanocomposites in which CeO2 nanocrystals with 10–15 nm size were synthesized by a simple oil bath process (Fig. 3c).72 As shown in Fig. 3e, CeO2/rGO demonstrated significant oxidation and reduction peaks. With the increase of the scan rate, the currents of redox peaks increase correspondingly, which indicated a good rate performance of the CeO2/rGO electrode. Due to the rapid transfer of electrons and ions to the inner layer of the material, CeO2/rGO has smaller resistance and an optimal ion diffusion rate, so it has better capacitance characteristics. Electrochemical tests showed that the CeO2/rGO electrode showed high specific capacitance (282 F g−1 at 2 A g−1) and cycle stability (86% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1).
A CeO2 nanoparticles/graphene nanocomposite was reported by Wang and coworkers, which was obtained through depositing CeO2 nanoparticles on 3D graphene.40 CeO2/graphene exhibited a specific surface area of 194 m2 g−1. CeO2 can provide hydrophilicity required by the electrode, thereby improving its utilization rate. And graphene can promote charge transfer, which makes the electrode show higher pseudocapacitance. The CeO2/graphene electrode showed a specific capacitance of 208 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. After that, in order to explore the effect of graphene loading on the electrochemical performance of CeO2, Saravanan et al. reported CeO2/graphene nanocomposites prepared by a low-temperature solution process with different weight percentages of graphene.73 As the graphene content increases, the specific capacitance of the composite material gradually increases. The CeO2/graphene electrodes with 5 wt% loading of graphene showed a specific capacitance of 109 F g−1 compared to pure CeO2 (75 F g−1). Besides, the specific energy of CeO2/graphene (92.1 W h kg−1) was nearly three times higher than that of pure CeO2 (33.13 W h kg−1).
The basal planes of graphene sheets can be used as a substrate to support other materials to create 3D composite structures.74,75 Chen et al. incorporated CeO2 into 3D graphene to take full advantage of the synergy between the two materials.76 They synthesized a 3D graphene/CeO2 aerogel for use as an electrode material through an in situ electrochemical synthesis process of graphene/CeO2 composite aerogels. They used a two-electrode electrochemical cell with two graphite sheets as both the anode and cathode for the in situ electrochemical experiment (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b shows the detailed reactions for the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite and in situ deposition of CeO2 on graphene sheets. The as-obtained CeO2 nanoparticles were in close contact with graphene, which can enhance the synergistic effect between graphene and CeO2. The excellent electrochemical performance of the graphene/CeO2 aerogel electrode can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) the high conductivity of graphene may facilitate a very fast electron transfer rate; (2) the synergetic effect of graphene and CeO2 leads to the combination of electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance.
Recently, research has found that coating graphitic carbon on CeO2 can not only increase the electronic conductivity of the electrode material but also improve its structural stability. Hollow CeO2 nanospheres conformally coated with graphitic carbon (H–CeO2@GC) for use as an electrode material in SCs were reported by Wu et al.64Fig. 4a shows a schematic diagram of the synthesis of H–CeO2@GC. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of H–CeO2@GC hollow spheres with different magnifications are shown in Fig. 4b and c, respectively. All hollow spheres exhibit a uniform size and the shell has a thickness of approximately 30 nm and an inner diameter of approximately 200 nm. CeO2 with a hollow structure and graphite carbon coating not only has high electronic conductivity but also has a high specific surface area and structural stability. The BET analysis showed that H–CeO2@GC has a specific surface area of 153 m2 g−1, which is higher than the specific surface area of CeO2 hollow spheres (106 m2 g−1). When applied in SCs, H–CeO2@GC has great potential because it has a high specific capacitance (501 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent rate capability and cycling stability (93% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1).

CNTs can be thought of as consisting of one (single-walled, SWCNTs) or multiple (multi-walled, MWCNTs) rolled up graphene sheets. It has high electrochemical stability, a high activated surface area, and high electrical conductivity. Using CNTs as a substrate can not only accelerate electron conduction but also accumulate electrons, thereby releasing more electrons during the discharge process.77,78 Luo and coworkers prepared CeO2 chunks on a CNTs substrate via an ultrasound process and subsequent hydrothermal synthesis.32 The CeO2/CNTs hybrids utilize the high conductivity of CNTs and redox properties of CeO2. Fig. 4f shows that all CeO2 nanoparticles were grown on the CNTs substrate without CNTs exposure. And it can be seen from Fig. 4g that CeO2 grows along the CNTs. The hybrids provided specific capacitance (818 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1) and excellent capacitance retention (95.3% after 2000 cycles) owing to the synergistic effect of the two materials (Fig. 4e). Similarly, Kalubarme and coworkers prepared CeO2/CNTs using a one-pot hydrothermal process in the presence of KOH and capping agent polyvinylpyrrolidone.65 The fabrication process for the CeO2/CNTs composites is illustrated in Fig. 4d. CNTs can be used as a carrier to improve the electronic conductivity of CeO2 and thus increase its charge transfer rate. Besides, CNTs as a carrier may also increase the surface area of the composite material. The increase of the conductivity and surface area of the composite material has greatly improved its electrochemical performance. The composites maintained a high energy density of 35.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 21.2 kW kg−1.
By using functionalized MWCNTs as structuring agents, the conductivity of the composite can be increased and the distance of electron and ion transmission can be reduced. Furthermore, the contact surface area between the electrode and the electrolyte can be increased. Deng and coworkers prepared CeO2/MWCNTs by a facile hydrothermal method without any surfactant or template.79 The electrochemical measurements revealed that the specific capacitance of CeO2/MWCNTs is 455.7 F g−1, which is 246% higher than that of pure MWCNTs. Furthermore, the cycle stability test showed that the electrode still has an initial capacitance of 81.1% after 2000 cycles. Besides, Pandit et al. reported that CeO2/MWCNTs was used as an electrode material for SCs.80 The CeO2/MWCNTs nanocomposite showed a specific capacitance of 1215.7 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 in a three-electrode test. More importantly, the composite exhibited excellent cycle stability, with a capacitance loss of only 7.7% after 10000 cycles. A symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor (SSC) was assembled using PVA-LiClO4 gel as a solid electrolyte and CeO2/MWCNTs as an electrode material. The SSC device showed a specific capacitance of 486.5 F g−1 and an energy density of 85.7 W h kg−1. The reason for the improvement in electrode performance can be attributed to the sufficient conductivity provided by MWCNTs. In addition, the presence of CeO2/MWCNTs increases the specific surface area and porosity of the material, shortens the electron transport path, and increases the rate of charge propagation, thereby improving the electrochemical performance as a whole.


3.1.3 Cerium dioxide/conducting polymer composites. 
As another important class of pseudocapacitive materials, conductive polymers have received increasing attention due to their high electrical conductivity, non-toxicity, and low cost. It is possible to develop devices with low equivalent series resistance, high power, and high energy.81
Polyaniline (PANI), historically called aniline black, is one of the pioneering conductive polymers. It is widely used as an energy storage material because of its high electrochemical activity, excellent stability, and high specific capacitance. Furthermore, it can be used as a conductive agent or directly as an electroactive material.82,83 Jeyaranjan et al. successfully prepared ternary compounds with different ratios (PR5C5: 90 wt% PANI, 5 wt% rGO, and 5 wt% CeO2 nanorods, PR9C1, and PR1C9).84 The preparation process is shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5c shows the SEM image of spray-dried hierarchical structures. It can be seen from the inset of Fig. 5c that the composites show a porous structure, which facilitates the storage of charge by the active material. The synergy of the three components maximizes ion and charge transport while mitigating the restacking and aggregation of the nanostructures, resulting in materials that have excellent electrochemical properties. The obtained PR9C1 hierarchical microspheres, as an electrode material for SCs, demonstrated a high specific capacitance (684 F g−1) and an excellent cycle life (91.7% capacitance retention after 6000 cycles at 4 A g−1) (Fig. 5e). Besides, the PR9C1 composite as the positive electrode and rGO as the negative electrode in an ASC system showed a high specific energy density (46.27 W h kg−1) at a power density of 850 W kg−1.

Dispersing metal oxides in PANI particles and combining them with graphene can increase the conductivity and cycle stability of the material. Xie et al. synthesized a rGO–CeO2/porous PANI ternary nanocomposite through a three-step approach.85 When the mass ratio of CeO2 and porous PANI was 1:4, the specific capacitance of the ternary nanocomposite (rGO–CeO2/porous PANI) is the largest (454.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). In comparison to other nanomaterials, rGO–CeO2/porous PANI (1:4) shown better cycle life (70.23% after 10000 cycles at 5.0 A g−1) (Fig. 5d). Similarly, Maheswari and coworkers reported PANI/CeO2 nanocomposites.86 They first used CTAB as a capping agent to prepare pure CeO2. Then PANI was synthesized by chemical oxidation polymerization using aniline as the monomer. Finally, different proportions of PANI/CeO2 are mixed by a simple solution mixing method to prepare PANI/CeO2 nanocomposites. The electrochemical tests indicated that PANI/CeO2 in SCs exhibited a specific capacitance of 1452 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, which is higher than that of pristine CeO2 (927 F g−1 at 2 A g−1). What's more, the composite has almost no capacitance loss after 1500 cycles, indicating its excellent cycle stability. Furthermore, an ASC device based on PANI/CeO2 nanocomposites was assembled. The ASC device delivered a high energy density of 75 W h kg−1 with a power density of 566 W kg−1. Due to the increase of electronic conductivity and the low charge transfer resistance (0.65 Ω) of CeO2/PANI composites, they exhibit excellent electrochemical performance.
As another common conductive polymer, polypyrrole (PPy) has received widespread attention due to its high capacitance per unit volume (400–500 F cm−3). Wang et al. prepared CeO2/PPy via in situ chemical oxidative polymerization.87 The preparation process of CeO2/PPy is shown in Fig. 5b. CeO2/PPy showed a specific capacitance of 240.7 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1. Furthermore, the ASC based on CeO2/PPy showed a specific capacitance of 193 F g−1, compared with 127 F g−1 for pure PPy.


3.1.4. Other element doped cerium dioxide composites. 
Doping other metal elements in the electrode material has become an important means of enhancing the capacitance performance of SCs. Selecting a suitable metal element for doping can greatly improve the cycle stability and ion storage capacity of the electrode.33
Oskueyan and coworkers prepared N and S co-doped graphene quantum dots (N, S-GQDs) on CeO2 nanoparticles via an in situ hydrothermal method.88 The results showed that the nanocomposite of PANI with 5% N, S-GQDs@CeO2 (PACG5) has a higher specific capacitance than PANI–CeO2. When the current density is 1 A g−1, PACG5 exhibits a specific capacitance of 189 F g−1. N, S-GQDs in the conductive PANI matrix can effectively increase the active surface and conductivity of CeO2. In another study, Co-doped CeO2/rGO composites have also been reported by Parwaiz and coworkers.89 The composites possessed a specific capacitance of 594.3 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1, which is 3.97 and 2.13 times higher than that of pure CeO2 and CeO2/rGO nanocomposites, respectively. The ASC device is assembled with Co-doped CeO2/rGO composites and AC. The device still has a capacitance retention rate of more than 90% after 2000 cycles, which indicates its excellent cycle stability. The reason for the improved electrochemical performance of the material is attributed to the incorporation of Co ions. Co doping creates more active sites by forming defects, while rGO increases the conductivity of the material.
Similarly, Murugan et al. reported a facile microwave technique to prepare Co-doped CeO2 nanostructures with different levels of doping (0–7 wt%).90 With the increase of Co doping, the morphology of CeO2 changes from the flake-like morphology to a globular flower-like structure. When the doping amount of Co is 7%, CeO2 becomes a porous structure due to the increase of Co ions in CeO2. This structure facilitates the transport of ions. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Co (5%)-CeO2 (Co–C5) electrode showed a maximum specific capacitance of 573 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 and excellent reversible capacitance, with a capacity loss of only 4% after 1000 cycles. In another study, Murugan et al. synthesized pure CeO2 and Ni-doped CeO2 by a microwave-assisted method, respectively.34 The growth mechanism of pure and Ni-doped CeO2 nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 6f. The incorporation of Ni changed the morphology of CeO2, and a diamagnetic to ferromagnetic transition was observed in Ni-doped CeO2. This transition is due to the presence of oxygen vacancies in Ni-doped CeO2, which can cause ferromagnetic behavior in the samples. In addition, the incorporation of Ni increases the oxygen vacancies in CeO2, which is beneficial to the improvement of electrochemical performance. Compared to pure CeO2, the 5% Ni-doped CeO2 electrode exhibited higher specific capacitance (577 F g−1 at 2 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (94% after 1000 cycles) (Fig. 6g). After that, Gong et al. synthesized Ni-doped CeO2@PANI (Ni–CeO2@PANI) with different structures using a facile two-stage synthetic method composed of hydrothermal and polymerized reactions (Fig. 6a).91 It can be seen from Fig. 6b and c that the diameters of NCP1 and NCP2 are both around 180 nm. Fig. 6d shows the hollow structure of PANI. Ni-doped CeO2 can enhance the stability of the material, while PANI can increase the capacitance and conductivity of the material. The as-prepared Ni–CeO2@PANI exhibited a specific capacitance of 866 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, with excellent cycling stability (85.6% after 10000 cycles).

Vanitha et al. prepared a new ternary Ag decorated CeO2/rGO nanocomposite by a hydrothermal method using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a surface directing agent, which showed a high specific capacitance of 710.42 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 in 3 M KOH (Fig. 6e).92 The prepared composite has ultra-micropores and mesopores, which can promote the diffusion of the electrolyte to the active site and promote the transport of electrons and ions at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. Similarly, novel Ag-incorporated CeO2 (Ag–CeO2) nano-cauliflowers were reported by Maheswari et al., which were obtained through a simple hydrothermal method.93 When doped with 5% Ag, Ag–CeO2 showed a specific capacitance of 1305 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1, which is 47% higher than that of pristine CeO2. Moreover, the electrode has excellent rate performance (1012 F g−1 at 10 A g−1), and there is almost no capacitance loss after 1500 cycles. An ASC device based on Ag–CeO2 nanocomposites was assembled. The ASC device possessed an energy density of 70 W h kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1, indicating its promising application in SCs. Furthermore, the device exhibited excellent rate capacity (140 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1). In the same year, Sivasakthi et al. successfully synthesized a new mesoporous nanocomposite electrode on copper foam utilizing Sm-doped NiO–CeO2via a pulse electrodeposition technique.94 The incorporation of Sm increases the surface area and porosity of the electrode, which is beneficial to the improvement of the electrochemical performance of the electrode. The Sm-doped NiO–CeO2 electrode has a specific surface area of 528 m2 g−1, which is much higher than that of the NiO electrode. Furthermore, it can be seen from the electrochemical tests that the as-prepared Sm-doped NiO–CeO2 has a high specific capacitance (1314 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) compared with the NiO (914 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) electrode and good capacitance retention (91% after 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1).


3.1.5 Other cerium dioxide composites. 
Transition metal oxides such as MnO2, Co3O4, NiO, etc. have been widely studied as electrode materials for SCs. Transition metal oxides have characteristics such as high theoretical capacitance, low cost, and non-toxicity, but their high resistance and poor electrochemical reversibility limit their applications in the field of SCs.95–97
MnO2 is considered to be the best transition metal oxide for SCs after RuO2 due to its high theoretical specific capacitance (1370 F g−1) and non-toxicity. Zhang et al. prepared hierarchical porous MnO2/CeO2 for use as an electrode by a simple hydrothermal method.98 CeO2 in the composite can not only act as an accelerator to promote the Faraday reaction of MnO2, but also provide a rich diffusion path for electrolyte ions. The specific surface area and specific capacitance of the as-obtained electrode materials are 73.4 m2 g−1 and 273.4 F g−1, respectively, which are higher than the specific surface area and specific capacitance of pure MnO2 and pure CeO2. Furthermore, the initial capacitance was only attenuated by 6.1% at 0.5 A g−1 over 1000 cycles of continuous charge/discharge. The impedance test showed that the impedance of the composites is significantly reduced, which solves the problem of poor conductivity of CeO2 to a certain extent. Similar to Zhang's work, nanowire CeO2@MnO2 core–shell heterostructures were synthesized via a facile self-assembly strategy by Zhu and coworkers.99 MnO2 is uniformly dispersed on the surface of CeO2, which can improve the utilization rate of active materials. In addition, MnO2 can wrap CeO2 to form rich pores, which will shorten the diffusion path of ions. The electrochemical studies showed that the prepared CeO2@MnO2 electrode had an excellent specific capacitance (255.2 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1), and excellent cycle stability (82.8% after 3000 cycles). Besides, CeO2@MnO2 heterostructures were used as the positive electrode and active graphene oxide was used as the negative electrode to assemble an ASC. This device delivers an energy density of 27.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1. After that, Ojha et al. prepared CeO2-doped MnO2 nanorod decorated rGO (CeO2–MnO2/rGO) by the hydrothermal method.100 The CeO2–MnO2/rGO composites showed a specific capacitance of 648 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1, which is higher than that of MnO2/rGO (315.13 F g−1) and MnO2 (228.5 F g−1). Besides, the specific capacitance retention of CeO2–MnO2/rGO was 90.4%, after 1000 cycles. Based on the summary of previous work, Peng and coworkers synthesized CeO2 nanoparticles/MnO2 nanosheet composites with different molar ratios.101 CeO2 can prevent the stacking of nanosheets, while MnO2 nanosheets can shorten the ion transport distance. The combination of the two makes the composite exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. The electrochemical tests showed that when the ratio of CeO2 and MnO2 was 14.58%, the prepared samples showed the highest specific capacitance (580.1 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and only lost 4.2% of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles.
Mn3O4 is another oxide of manganese, which has the characteristics of low cost, intrinsically high capacity and environmental friendliness. Liu et al. prepared Mn3O4/CeO2/rGO composites by the hydrothermal method.102 The as-prepared Mn3O4/CeO2/rGO has a specific surface area of 209.62 m2 g−1, which is higher than that of Mn3O4–graphene (40 m2 g−1). The large surface area facilitates the adsorption–desorption of electrolyte ions and thus helps improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode. Furthermore, the composites showed a high specific capacitance of 209.2 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, which is remarkably higher than that of the Mn3O4–graphene electrode (27.5 F g−1). In another study, Qian and coworkers used the 3D porous graphene skeleton as a conductive scaffold to prepare Mn3O4–CeO2/holey-graphene nanocomposites by the hydrothermal method.103 The Mn3O4–CeO2 nanoparticles can not only prevent the aggregation and stacking of graphene nanoplatelets but also prevent the electrolyte from entering the slit holes. This unique feature effectively improves electrochemical performance. The electrochemical characterization revealed that the composites showed a specific capacitance 310 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and remarkable retention with only 7.6% loss after 1000 cycles in the three-electrode test, indicating its application potential in SCs.
In order to improve the redox stability of CeO2, Arul and coworkers prepared CeO2 nanoparticles, CeO2/Fe2O3 nanospindles and Fe2O3 nanorods via a co-precipitation method.104 It can be seen from the electrochemical data (Fig. 7g) that the specific capacitance of CeO2/Fe2O3 nanospindles is 142.6 F g−1, which is higher than that of CeO2 nanoparticles (28.1 F g−1) and Fe2O3 nanorods (82.2 F g−1). Besides, the CeO2/Fe2O3 nanospindles exhibited excellent cycling stability (94.8% after 1000 cycles).

Co3O4 is considered to be one of the most attractive electrode materials due to its high theoretical specific capacitance (3560 F g−1), high surface area, good redox properties and good capacity retention. Cao et al. reported 3D porous graphene-modified Co3O4/CeO2, which was obtained by using a flower stem as a biotemplate.105 The composite showed a specific capacitance of 221 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and remarkable capacitance retention with only 4% loss over 1000 cycles. After that, Li et al. reported a tremelliform Co3O4@CeO2 nanocomposite with a network structure.106 They used nickel foam as a substrate, and first prepared a precursor of Co3O4@CeO2 by the hydrothermal method and then calcined to obtain a tremelliform Co3O4@CeO2. The Co3O4@CeO2 composites exhibited enhanced electrochemical properties (2260.8 F g−1, 1 A g−1) compared with those of pure Co3O4 (809.246 F g−1). Besides, the cycling stability test of the composites showed excellent cyclic stability, maintaining 90.1% of capacitance after 4000 cycles. The improvement in electrode performance can be attributed to the network structure of the composites. The network structure facilitates the transport of ions. In addition, the highly active CeO2 can accelerate the Faraday reaction and increase the degree of oxidation of Co3O4, so that the material has excellent cycle stability.
In another study, Wei et al. successfully prepared a porous Co3O4–CeO2 hollow polyhedron by the ion-exchange method using ZIF-67 as a template.28 BET testing of the Co3O4–CeO2 composite showed a large surface area of 136.4 m2 g−1 with about a pore size of 36 nm. The larger specific surface area increases the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte ions. In addition, high porosity facilitates the transport of electrolyte ions, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of the material. Co3O4–CeO2 displayed a high specific capacitance of 1288.3 F g−1 at 2.5 A g−1 with a capacitance loss of less than 3.3% after 6000 cycles. What's more, an ASC device based on hybrid porous Co3O4–CeO2 hollow polyhedrons and AC was assembled. The device exhibited an energy density of 44.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 5.1 kW kg−1.
Nanowires can shorten the path length of electronic transmission and thus improve the performance of the electrode. Cui et al. reported Co3O4/CeO2 hybrid nanowire arrays (NWAs) synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method.107 The SEM images of the prepared Co3O4/CeO2 are displayed in Fig. 7d and e. The Co3O4/CeO2 hybrid nanowires exhibit a porous structure with a specific surface area of 88.15 m2 g−1 and a pore size between 2 and 10 nm. When used as an electrode material for SCs, the Co3O4/CeO2 hybrid NWAs showed improved remarkable pseudocapacitance (1037.5 F g−1 at 2.08 A g−1), which is higher than that of Co3O4 NWAs (670 F g−1 at 3.33 A g−1). What's more, the Co3O4/CeO2 hybrid NWAs still have a capacitance retention rate of 94.4% after 5000 cycles, which is much higher than that of Co3O4 NWAs (Fig. 7f).
Electrode materials with a large specific surface area, porous structure and internal cavity are considered as ideal electrode materials. Wei and coworkers successfully used a facile self-template method to assemble NiCo2O4/CeO2 hierarchical hollow spheres (Fig. 7a).108 At a current density of 8 A g−1, NiCo2O4/CeO2 indicated a high specific capacitance of 2781.3 F g−1 in 3.0 M KOH + 0.10 M K4[Fe(CN)6], which is more than that of NiCo2O4, and outstanding cycle stability (approximately 3% loss after 5000 cycles). Moreover, an ASC based on the mesoporous hybrid NiCo2O4/CeO2 and AC was assembled. The device indicated an energy density of 59.1 W h kg−1 when the power density is 3298.7 W kg−1. What's more, the ASC lost only 9% of its initial specific capacitance after 5000 charging–discharging cycles. The hybrid NiCo2O4/CeO2 material has a large specific surface area, which increases the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, and provides many electrochemically active sites for the redox reaction. Furthermore, the material has a hollow structure that can improve the passage of electrolyte ions. The NiCo2O4/CeO2 microspheres were fabricated using a facile solvothermal method and subsequent heat treatment by Wei et al.109Fig. 7b shows the synthesis process of NiCo2O4/CeO2 microspheres. The SEM image of NiCo2O4/CeO2 is shown in Fig. 7c. The as-prepared hierarchical porous NiCo2O4/CeO2 microspheres with a specific surface area of 113.02 m2 g−1 showed a high specific capacitance of 2659.1 F g−1 at 5.0 A g−1. Furthermore, the NiCo2O4/CeO2 hybrid materials showed an excellent reversible capacitance, with a capacity loss of only 0.4% after 5000 continuous charge–discharge cycles. The remarkable electrochemical performance of the NiCo2O4/CeO2 hybrid materials is due to their porous and high surface areas, which facilitate ion/electron transfer and enhance the contact area of the electrode material and the electrolyte.
NiO has been widely used in SCs due to its thermal stability, high chemical stability, high theoretical capacitance values (2082 F g−1 in a potential window of 0.5 V), low cost, natural richness, and environmental friendliness. Yi et al. utilized a simple hydrothermal method to prepare hybrid porous flower-like NiO@CeO2 microspheres (Fig. 8a).110 As shown in Fig. 8c, the morphology of NiO@CeO2 looks like a spherical flower. The prepared nanoflowers have a radius of about 4–5 μm and the petals have a thickness of a few nanometers. The CeO2 nanoparticles deposit on the surface of NiO nanosheets to form porous flower-like NiO@CeO2 microspheres. Adding a moderate amount of CeO2 to NiO can decrease the charge transfer resistance, which greatly improves the electrochemical performance of the composite. When 5.0 wt% CeO2 was added to NiO, the performance of the composite increased the most. Electrochemical tests showed that the NiO@CeO2 (5.0 wt%) composites exhibited a high specific capacitance (960.4 F g−1 at 20 A g−1) and excellent cycle stability of 95.84% over 10000 cycles. Besides, Manibalan and coworkers used PVP to control the size of nanocomposites and prepared heterostructure CeO2@NiO nanocomposites by a hydrothermal method.111 The test of the heterostructure CeO2@NiO exhibited excellent cycle stability, with only 1.6% capacitance loss after 3000 cycles. Furthermore, a maximum specific capacitance of 317 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 was obtained in 1 M KOH.

A novel NiO–CeO2 binary oxide was reported by Padmanathan and coworkers, which was obtained through a glycol assisted citrate sol–gel method.42 The combination of CeO2 and NiO can enhance the structural stability and redox performance of CeO2. The as-prepared NiO–CeO2 binary oxide was used as an electrode for SCs and a specific capacitance of 305 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 was obtained, and capacitance with only 5% loss after 1000 cycles was observed, indicating its application potential for energy storage. 3D NiO@CeO2 was reported by Zhao and coworkers.112 They used nickel foam as a substrate in the preparation process and prepared NiO@CeO2 by the solvothermal method (Fig. 8e). The exposure of oxygen vacancies in CeO2 and the synergistic effect between CeO2 and NiO have greatly improved the electrochemical performance of the material. The electrochemical test of NiO@CeO2 exhibited 1250.44 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent retention with only 12% loss over 2000 cycles at 20 A g−1. Furthermore, the electrode showed a maximal energy density of 203 W h kg−1 at 2.21 kW kg−1. In another study, heterostructure CeO2–CuO nanocomposites were successfully prepared through a chemical precipitation method by Manibalan et al.113 Electrochemical tests showed that the as-prepared CeO2–CuO exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 396 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. What's more, the electrode showed a high energy density of 96 W h kg−1 at a power density of 2 W kg−1.
He et al. reported the composites of dumbbell-like ZnO nanoparticles-CeO2 nanorods (ZnO NPs-CeO2 NRs), which were obtained through the hydrothermal method, followed by calcination at 650 °C.114 The as-prepared ZnO NPs-CeO2 NRs showed a specific surface area of 28.455 m2 g−1, which greatly improved the electrochemical performance of the composites. Compared to CeO2 NRs, the specific capacitance of ZnO NPs-CeO2 NRs is increased by 12 times. Moreover, the electrode still has a capacity retention rate of 87.1% after 1000 cycles.
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) layered materials, such as MoS2, have 2D stacked layers of covalently bonded transition metals. Li et al. reported a facile wet chemistry method to fabricate a 3D CeO2@MoS2 core–shell architecture as an electrode material for SCs, where CeO2 hollow spheres were used as a core and 2D MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets were used as a shell.115 MoS2 can help ion transmission and the hollow structure of the material shortens the ion transmission distance. Compared to pure MoS2 nanosheets, the as-synthesized CeO2@MoS2 core–shell architecture exhibited a higher specific capacitance (90 mF cm−2 at 2.55 mA cm−2). Similarly, Bibi and coworkers prepared a CeO2/CeS2 nanocomposite electrode for SCs via a facile hydrothermal method.116 The CeO2/CeS2 nanocomposites showed high specific capacitance (420 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent cycling stability and high power density.
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted much attention due to their anisotropic, adjustable composition, effective use of transition metal atoms, low cost and environmental friendliness. Wang et al. designed stamen-petal-like CeO2/NiMn-LDHs composites for SCs.117 A schematic diagram of the synthesis CeO2/NiMn-LDHs is shown in Fig. 8d. Fig. 8b shows the porous flower-like structure of NiO@CeO2 microspheres. This stamen-petal-like composite exhibited a maximum specific capacitie of 1956.0 F g−1 (1173.6 C g−1) and 1261.4 F g−1 (756.8 C g−1) at 1 A g−1 and 20 A g−1, respectively, which is better than that of traditional NiMn LDHs and CeO2 composites. CeO2/NiMn-LDHs as the positive-electrode material and AC as the negative-electrode material were used to assemble an ASC, and the device can achieve the highest specific capacitance of 145.7 F g−1 and a capacitance retention rate of 91.9% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The composites dispaly excellent electrochemical performance due to their large specific surface areas and average pore sizes which provide a rich way for ion transport.

3.2. Lanthanum oxide and composites
La2O3 is an attractive functional rare earth oxide.119 Recent studies have shown that La2O3, as a p-type semiconductor oxide, has unique physical and chemical properties, which makes it promising for application in SCs.

Yadav et al. used a binder-free single-step hydrothermal method to grow La2O3 thin films on a stainless-steel substrate (Fig. 9b), which showed a specific capacitance of 250 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and excellent stability (81% after 1000 cycles).120 BET analysis showed that the as-prepared porous La2O3 thin films had a high specific surface area of 45.39 m2 g−1 with a pore size of 6.9 nm. After that, Yadav et al. fabricated thin-film La2O3 for use as a cathode material through a CBD method (Fig. 9a).121 As shown in Fig. 9e, the La2O3 film has a rod-like morphology. This morphology provides an electron transport path that helps to improve the conductivity and rate performance of the La2O3 film. An ASC with the structure of Co3O4/PVA-KOH gel/La2O3 was successfully assembled, which shows good performance with a specific capacitance of 15 F g−1 and 92% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. Additionally, Yadav et al. synthesized a porous honeycomb-like La2O3 thin film by the spray pyrolysis method, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 166 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and a capacitance retention of 85% was achieved after 3000 cycles.44

To improve the electrochemical performance of La2O3, rGO/La2O3 nanocomposites used as an electrode material in SCs have been reported by Zhang and coworkers.122 They first mixed aqueous solutions of GO and La(NO3)3 with a hydrazine monohydrate solution under ultrasound. Then used a simple reflux process to get rGO/La2O3 nanocomposites. The electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 156.25 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and excellent rate performance in electrochemical tests. The deposition of La2O3 nanoparticles on the surface of rGO increases the conductive area of rGO and the contact area between the electrolyte and the rGO, which benefits the process of ion adsorption/desorption.
Novel rGO/La2O3 composites were reported by Miah et al.30 The composites exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 751 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Compared to rGO, the specific capacitance of rGO/La2O3 composites increased by 158% at a temperature of 30 °C and 205% at 70 °C, respectively. The electrode maintained 78% of capacitance after 2000 cycles at a temperature of 30 °C. However, the electrode has a retention rate of only 68% after 2000 cycles when the temperature rises to 70 °C. As the temperature increases, more conductive electrons are generated in graphene, which makes the composites exhibit better electrochemical performance at high temperatures.
Li et al. synthesized porous waxberry-like microsphere structures of MnO2/La2O3 (Mn–La) composites with different molar ratios through a facile two-pot hydrothermal method, which had a higher specific capacitance than that of pure MnO2 (as shown in Fig. 9f).43Fig. 9c and d show the SEM image of Mn–La–10 (molar ratio nMnO2:nLa2O3 = 1:0.1) at different magnifications. It can be seen from the magnified SEM image (Fig. 9d) that the surface of the microsphere is composed of a large number of nanorods. The introduction of La2O3 leads to lattice imperfection, which significantly increases the effective utilization of the active materials. Besides, the synergistic effect between La2O3 and MnO2 leads to a faster charge storage process and a higher charge storage capability. They used Mn–La–10 composites as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode to assemble an ASC (Fig. 9g). This device achieved a maximum energy density of 25.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.3 kW kg−1.
3.3. Other rare earth oxides and composites
In addition to the above mentioned, other rare earth oxides, such as Pr6O11, Eu2O3, Sm2O3, etc., have drawn the attention of researchers. These oxides generally have multiple oxidation states so that they can store charge in a wide range of potential windows. However, high cost and poor cycle stability limit their practical application, which makes it necessary to compound them with other materials.123 The research results of other rare oxides for SCs in recent years are shown in Table 3.
Pr6O11 is a promising electrode material for SCs due to its stable ambient temperature and pressure, high oxygen mobility, and unique redox properties. Chen et al. used nickel foam as the substrate and utilized a solvothermal method followed by thermal annealing to prepare Pr6O11@Ni–Co oxide-based core–shell nanostructures, which showed superior specific capacitance (1635 F g−1 at of 0.5 mA cm−2) and good cycling stability (82% after 1000 cycles).124 In addition, when tested as an electrode in Pr6O11@NiCo2O4//ASC in a KOH/PVA solid electrolyte, the as-prepared solid-state device delivers an energy density of 6.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 150 W kg−1. The composites have more active sites and the rapid transport of ions and electrons makes them show better electrochemical performance.
Recently, Wang et al. successfully synthesized Pr6O11/PPy nanocomposites utilizing ammonium peroxodisulfate as an oxidant via an in situ surface-initiated polymerization technique.125 The composites showed a high specific surface area of 40.9 m2 g−1, and a maximum specific capacitance of 400 F g−1 was obtained in a 1.0 M NaNO3 electrolyte at 10 mA cm−2. Small-sized nanocomposites can provide higher electroactive regions and shorter diffusion paths, thereby promoting electrolyte transport and ultimately making the composites exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. In another study, Kubra and coworkers utilized the solvothermal method and then thermal annealing to prepare Pr6O11/Mn3O4. Compared to pure Pr6O11, the Pr6O11/Mn3O4 showed a specific capacitance of 794.58 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in a 3 M KOH electrolyte.126
Eu2O3 is highly regarded because of its unique optical, catalytic and electrochemical properties due to its shielded 4f levels.127 Shiri et al. synthesized POAP/Eu2O3 nanocomposites by cathodic pulse electrochemical deposition.128 The as-prepared composites exhibited a specific capacitance of 249 F g−1 at 100 mV s−1 in 0.1 M HClO4, which is higher than that of pure POAP (102 F g−1). Furthermore, the capacitance loss of the electrode is less than 15% after 1000 cycles, indicating the excellent stability of the electrode. Additionally, Thakur et al. used PPy as the substrate and utilized in situ oxidative polymerization to prepare PPy/AC/Eu2O3 composites, which showed the highest gravimetric capacitance of 670 F g−1 and an outstanding volumetric capacitance of 1090 F cm−3 at 1 A g−1.129 Also, the composites maintained 89.44% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles, which is 1.38 times the cycle performance of PPy (64.76%) and 1.12 times the cycle performance of PPy/AC (79.72%). The AC provides a larger surface area and a shorter diffusion path that facilitates rapid electrolyte entry into the pores of the composite. Almost at the same time, Majumder et al. prepared a ternary complex by introducing Eu2O3 into a PPy/copper oxide (PPy/CuO) complex.130 Eu2O3, having a strong binding affinity with the nitrogen lone pair of PPy, can enhance the stability of the electrode material and improve its redox activity, thereby increasing the specific capacitance of the composite electrode. The PPy/CuO/Eu2O3 ternary nanocomposite showed a specific capacitance 320 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, together with a markedly enhanced thermal and cyclic stability.
Sm2O3/rGO was synthesized with different mass ratios through a simple sonochemical method by Dezfuli et al.131 When the mass of Sm2O3 and rGO is 1:1, the composites exhibited a specific capacitance of 321 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, and unique cycling stability (maintaining 99% of its initial capacitance even after 4000 cycles). Furthermore, the composites showed the highest energy densities of 38.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1. In the same year, Shiri et al. utilized the electrochemical deposition method to prepare Sm2O3/POAP composite films in a nitrate bath of Sm(NO3)3·6H2O.132 The hybrid films maintained more than 91% of initial capacitance after 1000 cycles and showed a specific capacitance of 238 F g−1 at 100 mV s−1. The reasons for the improved electrochemical performance of the composites can be attributed to: (i) the conjugated form of the polymer allows the electrons to conduct charge transfer along the polymer chain and (ii) the synergistic effect between the conductive polymer and Sm2O3.
4. Rare earth sulfides
4.1. Cerium sulfide
Unlike other rare earth oxides, there are fewer reports on the use of rare earth sulfides in electrode materials for SCs. Compared with metal oxides, metal sulfides are more flexible than metal oxides because sulfur has less electronegativity than oxygen.133,134 Cerium sulfide (Ce2S3) has three crystal forms (α, β, and γ), which are attracting attention due to excellent electrical conductivity and stability.
Karade et al. used stainless steel as the substrate and used a CBD approach to prepare α-Ce2S3 rectangular microrods for SCs.49 The SEM images of α-Ce2S3 are shown in Fig. 10d and e. The α-Ce2S3 microrods are uniform and densely packed, which helps to reduce the inherent resistance of the material. When used as an electrode material for SCs, the as-prepared α-Ce2S3 electrode had high specific capacitance (726 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1), specific energy (36.64 W h kg−1), and specific power (1340 W kg−1) and excellent electrochemical stability (93% after 2000 cycles). In another study, Kim and coworkers reported a simple one-step hydrothermal method to prepare a quaternary composite containing CeO2, Ce2S3, CeS2 and cuprous oxide (Cu2O).135 CeO2 Ce2S3 and CeS2 are poor electrical conductors. Anchoring them to bulk Cu2O particles with relatively good electrical conductivity can greatly improve the electrochemical performance of the composite. Electrochemical tests showed that the composite exhibited a high specific capacitance of 650 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and the specific capacitance loss is less than 6% after 1000 cycles at 10 A g−1, which can be used as an electrode material in SCs.

4.2. Lanthanum sulfide
Similar to Ce2S3, lanthanum sulfide (La2S3) also has three crystal forms (α, β, and γ). La2S3 has been synthesized by various methods such as the solvothermal method136 and thermal decomposition method.137 Patil et al. used the CBD method to synthesize La2S3 films as an electrode material to assemble solid-state SCs.138 Electrochemical testing shows that La2S3 showed a maximum specific capacitance of 294 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 with 89% excellent cycling stability over 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled SCs showed a maximum energy density of 0.12 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.46 kW kg−1. Besides, Patil and coworkers synthesized an α-La2S3 thin film by using a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method (Fig. 10c).139 The prepared α-La2S3 thin film has excellent hydrophilicity, which can enhance the interfacial interaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of the electrode. The electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 256 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and maintained a specific capacitance of 85% after 1000 cycles. In another study, Patil and coworkers used ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid as a complexing agent precursor to synthesize a La2S3 thin film by the SILAR method.140 The La2S3 thin film has a porous morphology, which facilitates the progress of the electrochemical reaction. In addition, this film is hydrophilic, which enhances the electrochemical activity and electrode–electrolyte interface interactions. The La2S3 electrode showed a specific capacitance of 358 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in 1 M Na2SO4. What's more, the electrode still maintains 78% of initial capacitance after 1000 cycles.
4.3. Samarium sulfide
Kumbhar et al. synthesized honeycomb-like binary α-Sm2S3 by the SILAR method, which was further studied for its potential application in SCs.141 The unique morphology makes Sm2S3 have a large surface area, which allows it to provide a larger number of redox sites during charge–discharge. The three-electrode test showed that α-Sm2S3 showed a maximum specific capacitance of 294 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and had an interface resistance of 0.0238 F cm−2 in a 1 M LiClO4–propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte. Furthermore, the α-Sm2S3 electrode retained about 89% of its initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. In another study, Kumbhar et al. used an environment-friendly facile chemical method to prepare Sm2S3 thin films with diffused nanoflakes.142 The prepared Sm2S3 has a nest-like network. This structure can provide more electroactive sites and easier paths for electrolyte ion intercalation and deintercalation during charge–discharge. The measured specific capacitance of the Sm2S3 nanoflakes was 213 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 with high energy density (39.39 W h kg−1). The electrode showed a good retention capacity rate of 81.47% after 1000 cycles, indicating that Sm2S3 is a promising candidate for SCs.
5. Rare earth hydroxides
Rare earth hydroxides can form a 2D layered structure like other hydroxides, which facilitates the transport of electrolyte ions, so they have gradually attracted the attention of researchers in recent years.143,144 Subasri et al. used a chemical precipitation method to prepare La(OH)3 nanorods and then anchored them onto 2D-graphene nanosheets to prepare a 2D La(OH)3–G nanocomposite by a solvothermal reduction method (Fig. 10a).145 The crystal structure of La(OH)3 modelled by using Vesta Software is shown in Fig. 10b. La(OH)3 nanorods can provide many electroactive sites for Faraday redox reactions and shorten the transport distance of ions and electrons at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The graphene sheet can provide more space, which is conducive to the storage of ions, thereby enhancing the penetration of electrolyte ions to the electrode. The synergy between the two can make the material show excellent electrochemical performance. The composites exhibited 485 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte solution when being used as the electrode material in a three-electrode system. Furthermore, the specific capacitance retention of the electrode was 95.3% after 3000 continuous charge–discharge cycles, which is better than that of La(OH)3 (89.7%). By using La(OH)3–G nanohybrids as a positive-electrode material and AC as the negative-electrode material to assemble an ASC, the ASC device showed energy and power densities of 24.7 W h kg−1 and 7.9 kW kg−1, respectively. Similarly, Arunachalam and coworkers reported a simple solvothermal reduction method to prepare Neodymium hydroxide/graphene (Nd(OH)3/G), which can be used for SCs.146 Electrodes of the composites were tested for use in SCs in a three-electrode system, and a maximum specific capacitance of 820 F g−1 was obtained at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. In order to achieve a higher potential window, Nd(OH)3 is used as the positive electrode and AC is used as the negative electrode to assemble an ASC. The ASC was found have an energy density of 40 W h kg−1 and outstanding capacitance retention (91.6% after 3000 cycles at 5 A g−1). In contrast to the above discussion, novel La(OH)3 and Nd(OH)3 nanopowders were reported by Arunachalam et al., which were obtained through a facile chemical precipitation method.52 According to the electrochemical tests, La(OH)3 and Nd(OH)3 exhibited a specific capacitance of 321 F g−1 and 511 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1, respectively. Furthermore, Nd(OH)3 as a positive electrode and AC as a negative electrode were used to assemble a Nd(OH)3//AC ASC. The Nd(OH)3//AC ASC showed an energy density of 18.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 4.0 kW kg−1.
6. Other rare-earth based materials
In addition to rare-earth based electrode materials discussed above, some other rare-earth based electrode materials for SCs have reported in recent years which are shown in Table 4. Although RE compounds have a lower specific gravimetric capacitance, they have a much larger volume capacitance due to their high density. Zhang et al. reported LaN by calcining La2O3 in NH3.147 The synthesized LaN has a very high electric conductivity of 0.34 S cm−1. What's more important, the material had an extremely high volumetric capacitance of 951.3 F cm−3 at 1 A g−1, which far exceeded the value of MXenes (350 F cm−3).148 Furthermore, the prepared LaN has a good capacitance retention rate of 87.3% when the current density from 1 A g−1 increases to 10 A g−1. LaN was used to assemble a symmetric supercapacitor, which showed a volumetric capacitance of 375.2 F cm−3 at 1 A g−1.

Aqueous electrolytes typically provide potentials in the range of about 1 V, which limits the energy and power that can be achieved. Non-aqueous electrolytes have the characteristics of low sulfate content, stable electrochemical performance, and a wide potential window, so they have attracted wide interest as alternatives to aqueous electrolytes.149–151 Patil and coworkers synthesized a lanthanum selenide (La2Se3) nanocube thin film by the SILAR method and studied as a capacitive material for SCs.152 A maximum specific capacitance of 363 F g−1 was found in a 0.8 M LiClO4/PC electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, with 17% loss of capacitance being experienced after 1000 cycles. La2Se3 exhibited an energy density of 80 W h kg−1 at a power density of 2.5 kW kg−1, which showed that it has the potential for applications in SCs. In another study, Patil et al. utilized the same method to prepare lanthanum telluride (La2Te3) thin films.153 When used as electrode materials, the as-prepared La2Te3 showed a specific surface area of 51 m2 g−1 with a mean pore size diameter of 6 nm. Furthermore, La2Te3 exhibited a specific capacitance of 194 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in a 1 M LiClO4/PC electrolyte. Similarly, Kumbhar et al. synthesized samarium telluride (Sm2Te3) via the SILAR method using Sm(NO3)3, Na2TeO3 and hydrazine hydrate as raw materials.154 The electrochemical tests showed that the Sm2Te3 electrode has a specific capacitance of 144 F g−1 with an energy density of 10 W h kg−1 in a 1 M LiClO4/PC electrolyte.
After analyzing previous studies, Patil et al. reported the synthesis of a cinnamon-like La2Te3 nanostructure via a simple CBD route.155 The measured specific capacitance of the cinnamon-like La2Te3 nanostructure was 469 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 with good stability up to 1000 cycles. In addition, the assembled ASC showed a maximum specific capacitance of 19.5 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and excellent cycle stability (1000 cycles, 73% capacitance retention). The porous structure of the cinnamon-like La2Te3 electrode facilitates the penetration of the electrolyte and therefore facilitates the diffusion of ions in the electrode.
7. Conclusions and outlooks
In summary, we have reviewed the recent advances in rare-earth nanomaterials and their composites in SCs, including rare earth oxides, rare earth sulfides, rare earth hydroxides and their corresponding composites. Their synthesis methods and morphologies are described in detail, and their electrochemical properties are compared. However, single-phase rare-earth based nanomaterials have limited electrical conductivity, a low specific surface area, and poor cycle stability, which limits their applications in SCs. In order to overcome these intrinsic problems of rare-earth based nanomaterials, various appealing nanostructures and their composites were fabricated. As mentioned above, we can see that the preparation methods, nanostructures, electrochemical performances, and application prospects of rare-earth based nanomaterials and their composites have been greatly improved in recent years.
It is worth noting that rare-earth based nanomaterials and their composites have the following advantages as electrode materials for SCs:
(i) Environmental friendliness and abundant reserves.
(ii) Excellent redox properties.
(iii) Rare earth oxides easily form oxygen vacancies, which are conducive to the transport of electrolyte ions.
(iv) Rare-earth based nanomaterials can form a 2D layered structure, which can promote ion transport and thus prolong the cycle life. Furthermore, rare-earth based nanomaterials can offer high volumetric energy density, which can improve their pseudocapacitive performance.


Some progress has been made in rare-earth based nanomaterials and their composites as active electrode materials for SCs. However, to overcome some of their intrinsic problems for SC applications, such as conductivity, cycling stability and capacitance values, the future research must focus on the following points:
(i) Most rare-earth based nanomaterials are not very conductive, which is detrimental to their capacitive performance. New strategies for preparing layered porous structures are particularly important for rare-earth based nanomaterials. This ensures efficient ion diffusion to support fast charging and discharging processes. An effective new strategy is to design and prepare porous materials with ultra-high specific surface areas to promote rapid electrolyte penetration and shorten ion diffusion paths. Another strategy is to compound rare-earth based nanomaterials with other materials (carbon-based materials and conductive polymers) to increase their conductivity.
(ii) The specific capacitance of rare-earth based nanomaterials is low. Nanocrystallization and doping treatment can increase the specific surface area and introduce defects in the electrode material, which can further improve the pseudocapacitive performance of rare-earth based nanomaterials.
(iii) Improving the hydrophilicity of rare-earth based nanomaterials to increase the electrode/electrolyte interface interaction. A hydrophilic material allows water to easily enter the material. Therefore, the electrolyte ions in the aqueous electrolyte solution are more easily intercalated or deintercalated, that is, the ion conductivity is increased, and thus the pseudocapacitor performance is increased.
(iv) Single-phase rare-earth based nanomaterials have their inherent defects, and subsequent research should rationally design the morphology, crystal structure, dispersibility, and particle size of composite materials in a more in-depth and effective manner to obtain electrode materials with excellent performance.
(v) Proposing more theories and carrying out corresponding theoretical calculations. From the theoretical point of view, a solution is to be found to improve the pseudocapacitive performance of rare-earth based nanomaterials, and at the same time provide important guidance for the design of porous structures with the best shape, size, number and distribution of pores.
Inevitably, there are still many problems and challenges in the application of rare-earth based nanomaterials in SCs. However, we believe that with the deepening of research on rare-earth based nanomaterials, they will surely have wider application in SCs.
