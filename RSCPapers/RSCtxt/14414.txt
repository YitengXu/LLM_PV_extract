    , Accepted 20th January 2015First published on 22nd January 2015AbstractThe pursuit of cost-effective and efficient solid-state electrolytes is a persistent objective for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Herein, we present the experimental design of iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−)-incorporated poly(ethylene oxide)/polyaniline (PEO/PANi) solid-state electrolytes, aiming at expanding the catalytic event of I3− reduction from the electrolyte/counter electrode interface to both the interface and electrolyte system and shortening the charge diffusion path length. Except for I− species, the conjugated PANi is also responsible for dye regeneration and hole transfer to the counter electrode. A DSSC with (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolyte yields a maximum efficiency of 6.1% in comparison with 0.8% obtained from a PANi-free electrolyte-based solar cell and 0.1% for a PANi-based solar cell.
1. Introduction
Solar energy, accounting for 99% of the total energy on Earth, has been considered as one of the promising green energy resources for developing a low-carbon economy. The direct conversion of solar energy into electricity is an efficient solution to current energy problems. Among diversified photovoltaic devices,1–4 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received widespread attention as inexpensive and remarkably efficient energy conversion devices.5–8 The configuration of a typical DSSC consists of an electrolyte containing redox couples that is dissolved in an organic solvent, which is sandwiched between an organic dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and a counter electrode (CE).9 Researchers are currently focusing on understanding and improving charge generation, transport, recombination, and collection along with optimizing materials for liquid electrolyte DSSC operation.10–12 Until now, a maximum efficiency of 13% has been measured under air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) global sunlight.13 Due to flaws in solvent leakage and evaporation, the mass production and long-term stability of such DSSC devices have been limited. One solution to this impasse is to employ microstructured polymer gel electrolytes with three-dimensional (3D) frameworks and all-solid-state electrolytes.14–17 Although liquid electrolyte can be imbibed and remains in the 3D structures of polymer gel electrolytes by osmotic pressure or capillary force,18 the dilemma of organic solvent evaporation still remains. Therefore, the challenge of achieving commercial success will be in designing efficient all-solid-state electrolytes with facile synthesis processes and cost-effectiveness.
The focus of the current solid-state systems is always on enhancement of charge-transfer ability. An emerging avenue by our group is to explore conducting polymers or carbonaceous materials with integrated electrolytes having catalytic activities for triiodide (I3−) reduction. In our previous works,19,20 conducting species such as polyaniline (PANi), polypyrrole, and graphene were successfully imbibed into 3D frameworks of polymer gel electrolytes, aiming at extending the reduction reaction of I3− from the electrolyte/CE interface to the whole structure due to the catalytic nature of such conducting polymers. Moreover, organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) have also been employed to replace electrolytes,21,22 which leads to >5% efficiency for solid DSSCs. The oxidized dye can be regenerated by the hole injection into the HTM, which is subsequently collected by the CE to fulfill an electronic circuit. These results demonstrate the great potential of developing solid-state DSSCs based on organic HTMs. Although spiro-OMeTAD is the most favorable organic HTM for such solid solar cells, it is limited by low hole mobility and high fabrication cost.23,24 Consequently, conjugated polymers such as polyaniline have been investigated as an alternative HTM due to their thermal stability, high conductivity, and good solubility as well as tunable optoelectronic features.25,26
To explore versatile full-solid-state electrolytes having catalytic and hole-transporting features, here, we launch an experimental strategy of synthesizing simple composite electrolytes from (I−/I3−)-incorporated poly(ethylene oxide)/polyaniline (PEO/PANi) for solid-state DSSC application. The resultant PEO/PANi displays intrinsic electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of I3− ions, rapid charge-transfer ability, easy synthesis, and cost-effectiveness, which demonstrates the merits of extraordinary solid-state electrolytes in efficient DSSCs. In addition, the integration of conjugated structure from PANi can shorten the charge diffusion path length. More importantly, the conjugated PANi structures participate in the dye regeneration by hole injection into the PANi. To our knowledge, there are no systematic ageing studies on efficient DSSCs from solid-state electrolytes with catalytic and hole-transporting functions. DSSCs employing PEO/1.0 wt% PANi show an efficiency as high as 6.1%, which is much higher than 0.8% from the cells with (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO electrolyte and 0.1% for pristine PANi hole material.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of solid-state electrolytes
A homogenous mixture was obtained by dissolving 0.592 mL of aniline in 20 mL of 1 M HCl aqueous solution. For polymerization, 20 mL of 0.125 M ammonium peroxydisulfate aqueous solution was dipped in the above mixture within 30 min, and the polymerization reaction was carried out at 0 °C. After 3 h, the resultant reactant was rinsed with 1 M HCl aqueous solution, filtered, and finally vacuum dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The feasibility of synthesizing (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/PANi electrolytes was confirmed by the following experimental procedures: a mixing solution consisting of I−/I3− redox couples, PEO, and PANi was made by agitating 0.1 g of LiI, 0.019 g of I2, 0.264 g of PEO (Mw = 2000000), and stoichiometric PANi (the dosages of PANi were adjusted to be 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 wt% of PEO weight). After vigorous agitating for 24 h, the reactant with a viscosity of approximately 100 mPa s−1 was cast onto a dye-sensitized TiO2 anode for consolidation at vacuum. As a reference, the (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO electrolyte was also prepared according to the above approach at the same stoichiometric ratio.
2.2 Assembly of DSSCs
A layer of TiO2 nanocrystal anode film with a thickness of approximately 10 μm was prepared by a sol-hydrothermal method.27 The resultant anodes were further sensitized by immersion in a 0.50 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye. The DSSC was fabricated by sandwiching redox electrolyte between a dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and a Pt CE (purchased from Dalian HepatChroma SolarTech Co., Ltd). The redox electrolyte consisted of 100 mM of tetraethylammonium iodide, 100 mM of tetramethylammonium iodide, 100 mM of tetrabutylammonium iodide, 100 mM of NaI, 100 mM of KI, 100 mM of LiI, 50 mM of I2, and 500 mM of 4-tert-butyl-pyridine in 50 mL acetonitrile. Surlyn film (30 μm) was utilized to seal the device through hot-pressing.
2.3 Electrochemical characterizations
The electrochemical performances were recorded on a conventional CHI660E electrochemical workstation setup comprising an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a CE composed of a Pt sheet, and a working electrode of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass-supported electrolyte. The CV curves were recorded in a supporting electrolyte consisting of 50 mM M LiI, 10 mM I2, and 500 mM LiClO4 in acetonitrile. Bode phase measurements were carried out in a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 105 kHz and an ac amplitude of 10 mV at room temperature. Both Bode plots and Tafel polarization curves were recorded by assembling symmetric dummy cells consisting of Pt CE|solid-state electrolyte|Pt CE.
2.4 Photovoltaic measurements
The photovoltaic test of the DSSC with an active area of 0.25 cm2 was carried out by measuring the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation under irradiation from simulated solar light produced by a 100 W xenon arc lamp (XQ-500 W) in an ambient atmosphere. The incident light intensity was controlled at 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell). A black mask with an aperture area of approximately 0.25 cm2 was applied on the surface of the DSSCs to avoid stray light.
2.5 Other characterizations
The ionic conductivity of the electrolyte was measured using a conductivity meter (DSSJ-308A, LeiCi Instruments) by consolidating electrolyte into the space between two electrodes. The instrument was calibrated with 0.01 M KCl aqueous solution prior to experiments. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry spectra were recorded on a Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a illustrates the synthesis process of (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/PANi solid electrolyte as well as H-bonding between PEO and PANi.28 Li+ ions are embedded into the free volume regions of PEO surrounded by I− and I3− counter ions. The conformational transformation of PEO segments at relaxation motion precipitates the migration of Li+ and therefore I−/I3− couples. Due to the redox nature of PANi, PANi nanostructures have been widely utilized as CE material for Pt candidates.29–31

Spectroscopy techniques were employed to examine the formation of functional bands and reaction mechanisms. The FTIR spectrum of the PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolyte is shown in Fig. 2. The observation of the bands at 800–900 cm−1 indicates the occurrence of PANi polymerization via a head-to-tail mechanism.32 The oxygenic species are expected to interact with the conjugated structure of PANi, especially through the Q-ring (semiquinone radical cation), as has been reported in the case of nanocrystalline TiO2 and Au.33 Once the PANi is integrated with PEO, the bands belonging to C–N stretching the secondary aromatic amine, and C–N–C stretching vibration in the polaron structure move from 1292 and 1231 cm−1 to 1280 and 1242 cm−1, respectively. Additionally, the bands for C–O–C stretching and C–O stretching at 1098 and 836 cm−1 have also shifted to 1102 and 845 cm−1, respectively. These signal the interaction between PANi (C–N) and PEO (C–O–C) through H-bonds.

Close contact of the PEO/PANi electrolyte with the Pt electrode results in a conduction of reflux electrons (the electrons traveling from the external circuit to the Pt CE) from the Pt layer to the whole solid-state electrolyte. The conducting channels formed by PANi chains function as pathways for electron transfer and can be optimized by adjusting the PANi dosage. Activated by electrons, PANi will catalyze the reduction reaction of I3− (Red1: I3− + 2e = 3I−) and I2 (Red2: 3I2 + 2e = 2I3−), in which Red1 governs the entire reaction kinetics. Fig. 1b demonstrates the solid nature of PEO/PANI and shows how inversion of the vessel containing the PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolyte results in the electrolyte staying on the bottom with no observable flow, thus exhibiting its suitability as a solid support for solid-state PEO/PANi. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a commonly used technique for determining catalytic activity. The CV curve of the solid-state electrolyte was measured using a conversional three-electrode system comprising a working electrode of Cu foil-supported solid electrolyte, a Pt wire CE, and liquid electrolyte containing I−/I3− redox couples. As shown in Fig. 3a, two pairs of redox peaks are observed in (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/1.0 wt% PANi solid-state electrolyte, and the peak shape and positions are similar to pure PANi CE,29–31 indicating that the solid-state PEO/PANi electrolyte has the same catalytic activity toward I3− reduction. As a reference, no redox peaks were detected from the (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO electrolyte, suggesting no catalysis of (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO.

(d) Temperature dependence of ionic conductivity for various solid-state electrolytes. 
With the aim of demonstrating the catalytic activity of solid electrolyte, the (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/PANi film was sandwiched between two Pt electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3b, the τ of electrons at the electrolyte/Pt electrode can be calculated by the equation34τ = 1/2πfp, where fp is the second peak frequency. Once the electrons migrate from the external circuit to the Pt layer, they either participate in the I3− reduction at the electrolyte/CE or transfer to the PEO/PANi system, and therefore, the average τ of electrons can be utilized to compare the synthetical kinetics of Pt and PANi toward I3− reduction. Apparently, the PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolyte exhibits a lifetime of 2.53 ms, as summarized in Table 1, which is shorter than that for other solid electrolytes.35,36 Considering that the Pt electrode has the same catalytic performance, the enhancement of synthetical kinetics reflects the highest catalytic activity in PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolyte. Fig. 3c shows Tafel polarization curves recorded on the same symmetrical dummy cell as that used for Bode phase measurement. The slope for the anodic or cathodic branch represents exchange current density (J0 = RT/nFRct).37 It is apparent that the PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolyte has a maximum J0 and therefore charge-transfer ability. Additionally, the intersection of the cathodic branch with the y-axis is a limiting diffusion current density (Jlim = 2nFCDn/l),38 a parameter dependent on the diffusion coefficient of I−/I3− redox couples. The extracted Jlim and diffusion coefficient of redox species (Dn) from PEO/1.0 wt% PANi are much higher than those of pure PEO electrolyte, indicating that the resultant ionic conductivity is significantly elevated.

Another creative feature of the PEO/PANi electrolyte is to shorten charge (I−/I3− redox couples) diffusion path length. In the DSSC with pure PEO electrolyte, the I− ions must migrate from the electrolyte/Pt CE interface to the electrolyte/anode interface for dye recovery, whereas the I3− species have to transfer across the whole electrolyte system to the electrolyte/Pt CE for reduction. However, the energy from the PEO/PANi solid electrolyte can assist with accelerating I3− ↔ I− conversion. Assisted by the schematic diagram in Fig. 1, we can reveal the potential mechanism. It has been previously described that the interconnected channels from PANi chains distribute through the whole electrolyte, and the I3− ions originating from the electrolyte/anode interface only transfer to conjugated chain segments of PANi for reduction reaction instead of the electrolyte/Pt CE interface. The as-reduced I− species also quickly return to the electrolyte/anode interface. Therefore, we can make the conclusion that the integration of PANi can shorten the I−/I3− diffusion path length. Although we cannot determine the accurate path and length in the current study, it is still pioneering to demonstrate preliminary new insights on how to elevate I3− reduction, shorten charge diffusion path length, and therefore markedly enhance the photovoltaic performances of solid-state DSSCs.
The ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte is crucial to the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs. Fig. 3d shows the temperature dependence of ionic conductivities for the solid-state electrolytes, and the data are summarized in Table 2. (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/1.0 wt% PANi exhibits the highest conductivity of 67.73 μS cm−1 at approximately 20 °C in comparison to 3.59 μS cm−1 for (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO. Compared with 5.76 mS cm−1 for ester-functionalized solid-state electrolyte,17 the measured conductivity is still unimpressive, and therefore, the enhanced photovoltaic performances are responsible for the peculiar catalytic activity. The ionic conductivities of the electrolytes measured under dry air from approximately 20 to 50 °C follow an Arrhenius relationship: σ = σ0exp(−Ea/RT), where σ is ionic conductivity, Ea represents activation energy, T refers to absolute temperature, and R is a molar gas constant. It was found that all plots of lnσ against 1000/T give straight lines, which is a typical ion-conducting behavior. The Ea,39 which is the minimum energy required for ionic conduction through (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/PANi solid-state electrolytes at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 wt% PANi, was obtained from the slopes in the linear fit, showing 76.66, 63.46, 63.07, 43.08, 41.98, 39.66, and 42.71 kJ mol−1, respectively. The Ea of the electrolyte at 1.0 wt% PANi is the lowest, indicating that ion (I− and I3−) movement becomes easier in the (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/PANi system.

Fig. 4a displays J–V curves of the DSSCs using (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/PANi, (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO solid electrolytes, and pristine PANi hole-transporting material. The DSSC with PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolyte yields an optimal η of 6.1% (Jsc = 13.59 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.636 V, FF = 70.6%). The recorded efficiency is very high for the solid-state DSSCs with either pristine solid-state electrolytes or HTMs.40–43 It is noteworthy to mention that the efficiencies for the solar cells with (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO and pristine PANi hole layers are 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively. The marked enhancement in efficiency is attributed to the synergistic effects of catalytic activity and shortened charge diffusion path length of the PEO/PANi electrolyte and hole injection into PANi. Notably, the Jsc, having the same order to η, signals that the rapid interconversion between I3− and I− can accelerate the generation of photoelectrons from dye molecules and therefore elevate the accumulative electron density on the conduction band of TiO2. The recorded efficiency from (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/1.0 wt% PANi is impressive in comparison with other full-solid-state DSSCs.27,35,44,45 In comparison with liquid-system DSSCs, the efficiency is still modest. The dye regeneration by organic HTM is generally on the picosecond time scale and at least one order of magnitude faster than that in a typical liquid electrolyte device.46 This indicates that the charge separation and dye regeneration are not the major bottlenecks for the low device performance of the resultant DSSCs. Other limitations such as low hole mobility of organic HTMs and incomplete filling of HTM into mesoporous TiO2 film have been considered because the derivative problems could lead to excessive interfacial recombination loss and dye regeneration hysteresis.

Rs: sheet resistance; Rct1: charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte; Rct2: charge-transfer resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface; W: Nernst diffusion resistance corresponding to the diffusion resistance of I−/I3− redox couples; CPE1/CPE2: constant phase elements. 
EIS experiments were carried out for the DSSCs to confirm the charge-transfer abilities of the resultant solid electrolytes. Nyquist plots in Fig. 4b illustrate that the Rct1 follows an order of PEO/1.0 wt% PANi (4.19 Ω cm2) < PEO/2.0 wt% PANi (8.74 Ω cm2) < PEO/0.8 wt% PANi (8.82 Ω cm2) < PEO/0.6 wt% PANi (9.08 Ω cm2) < PEO/0.4 wt% PANi (9.13 Ω cm2) < PEO/0.2 wt% PANi (21.6 Ω cm2) < PEO (36.1 Ω cm2), which is consistent with the sequence of τ and therefore catalytic activity. However, W represents the Nernst diffusion resistance of I−/I3− redox couples. A lower W denotes that I−/I3− species have higher diffusion kinetics. The results of W match the ionic conductivity well.
Fast startup, multiple start/stop cycles, and good photocurrent stability are prerequisite merits for efficient solar panels that will be mounted on windows or roofs or used as portable sources. Fig. 5a exhibits the start-stop switches of a cell device employing (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolyte. As a reference, the switching of the cell device with (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO was also measured under the same conditions. An abrupt increase in photocurrent density at “light on” indicates the fast startup of the DSSC, whereas no delay in reaching the highest current density suggests that the incorporation of PANi with PEO accelerates hole injection and the interconversion between I3− and I− as well as shortening the charge transfer path length. Interestingly, there is a depressed process in each “on” stage, indicating a diffusion-limited transport mechanism in the solid electrolytes. The schematic sketch in Fig. 5 illuminates the transfer avenues of electrons within a real solid-state DSSC employing (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/PANi electrolyte. Generally, there are two possibilities for the photogenerated electrons released from excited dye molecules: (i) The majority of electrons flow to the conduction band of TiO2 and further migrate to the FTO layer along conducting channels; (ii) only a minority of electrons transfer to the TiO2/electrolyte interface and recombine with I3− ions.47 Due to the fact that PANi has the ability to conduct electrons, the electrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface are expected to transfer to the electrolyte layer along the PANi chains and recombine with any encountered I3−, resulting in a decreased electron density in TiO2 and therefore photocurrent density of a cell device. However, the conducted electrons from electrolyte/Pt interfaces participate in the reduction reaction of I3− + 2e → 3I−, accelerating the interconversion kinetics of I3− species. Although there is also a decreased process for the cell with (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO electrolyte, the reduction degree is apparently confined in the absence of PANi, whereas the lower photocurrent density reflects a relatively poor I−/I3− interconversion and therefore dye recovery kinetics.

(b) Photocurrent stabilities recorded on the DSSCs obtained from traditional liquid electrolyte and (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/1.0 wt% PANi solid electrolyte. The schematic sketch illustrates the electron migration routes along PANi chains from the Pt electrode and TiO2 anode in a real solid-state DSSC. 
These conclusions are in agreement with electrochemical and photovoltaic characterizations. Moreover, the conjugated PANi can also participate in the dye regeneration by hole injection into the PANi, which is favorable to the photovoltaic performance. After eight startup cycles, no obvious decrease in photocurrent density was observed, suggesting that the solid-state DSSC has multiple startup capability. In order to compare the stability of DSSCs with traditional liquid electrolyte containing I−/I3− redox couples and (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/PANi electrolyte, their photocurrent stabilities were obtained using a chronoamperometry mode. As shown in Fig. 5b, the photocurrent densities increased by 35.1% and decreased by 8.5% for solid and liquid electrolytes under durative irradiation over 2 h,48 respectively. Although additional research will be necessary before two-hour tests for a stable DSSC can be conducted, this preliminary result demonstrates that the stability of the cell device can be significantly enhanced by utilizing (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/PANi solid electrolyte.49
4. Conclusions
In summary, full-solid-state electrolytes from (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/PANi featuring strong catalytic activity and shortened charge diffusion path length have been fabricated by a facile blending process free of any additives and employed in assembling efficient DSSCs. It was demonstrated that (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolyte has an optimal charge-transfer ability and electrocatalytic activity toward I3− reduction. Due to the expanded reaction area where electrons can travel from the electrolyte/Pt interface to the solid-state electrolyte system and the shortened charge transfer path length, the kinetics for I3− ↔ I− interconversion and dye recovery and therefore electron density on the conduction band of TiO2 have been markedly enhanced. The DSSC employing (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolyte exhibits an impressive power conversion efficiency of 6.1% in comparison with 0.8% from (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO and 0.1% from pristine PANi-hole-transporting-based devices. The research presented here is far from being optimized, but these profound advantages along with cost-effectiveness, mild synthesis, and scalable materials indicate that (I−/I3−)-incorporated PEO/1.0 wt% PANi electrolytes are strong candidates for incorporation in full-solid-state DSSCs. Further studies are now in progress to extend this approach to other solid-state electrolytes for better photovoltaic performances.
