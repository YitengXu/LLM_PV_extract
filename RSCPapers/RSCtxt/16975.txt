    , Accepted 29th November 2021First published on 30th November 2021AbstractThe sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) results in an ultra-high Pt loading on the anode of alkaline fuel cell (AFC) systems. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) can maximize the atom utilization efficiency, thus offering a promising strategy for reducing the cost of electrode materials. In this work, we systematically explored the alkaline HOR performance of single noble metal and 3d transition metal atoms anchored on the divacancy graphene (M/G, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) by first-principles density functional theory calculations. The calculations suggested that the alkaline HOR on M/Gs proceeds through the Heyrovsky–Volmer mechanism with the Heyrovsky reaction as the rate-determining step. Both the full free energy profile and H adsorption free energy indicate that all considered M/Gs show superb HOR activity in the order Cr/G < Fe/G < Co/G < Ni/G < Mn/G < Pt/G. However, only Pt/G and Ni/G can maintain high electrochemical stability at the HOR operating potentials, while Mn/G, Cr/G, Fe/G, and Co/G easily suffer from oxidation. Therefore, both Pt/G and Ni/G SACs are promising candidates as anodic HOR electrocatalysts for AFCs.
Introduction
With the increasing consumption of fossil fuels, climate anomaly, environmental pollution, and energy shortage have rapidly intensified, prompting us to explore clean, efficient, and sustainable new energy technologies.1 Hydrogen is considered as an ideal green energy carrier, because it only forms water in the oxidation process and can be regenerated sustainably from water decomposition by using renewable energy such as solar and wind power.2 In the hydrogen cycle, hydrogen fuel cells (HFCs) can efficiently convert the chemical energy stored in hydrogen into electricity without the restriction of the Carnot cycle. However, the commercial development of HFCs is still hindered by the scarcity and high price of noble metal Pt catalysts on the electrodes.3,4 HFCs can operate in acidic or alkaline electrolytes. Compared to the harsh acid electrolytes, the alkaline electrolytes present a milder environment, which provides more possibilities in selecting catalysts on the electrodes.5,6 For example, a variety of efficient and cheap electrocatalysts (such as Ag,7 metal oxides,8 and carbon materials9,10) have been reported for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode in alkaline media. However, the kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR, H2 + 2OH− → 2H2O + 2e−) at the Pt anode is about 100-fold slower in alkaline than in acid.11 The sluggish HOR kinetics becomes the bottleneck of the energy conversion process in alkaline media, resulting in higher Pt loading and higher cost of the anode.
In recent years, continuous efforts have been devoted to reducing the Pt content of catalysts and even developing Pt-free catalysts for the HOR in alkaline media.12–14 Some types of HOR catalysts have been reported including noble metals and their alloys (such as PtNi,15 PtFe,16 PtRu,17 RuIr,18 PdIr,19 and Pd-CeO2 (ref. 20)), transition metals (Ni,21 NiCu,22 MoNi4,23 and CoNiMo (ref. 24)), transition metal oxides and hydroxides (Ni/NiO/C (ref. 25) and Ni(OH)2–Ni/C (ref. 26)), transition metal nitrides (Ni3N (ref. 27) and Ni3N/Ni (ref. 28)), transition metal borides (Ni3B/Ni (ref. 29)), transition metal phosphides (Co2P/CoP (ref. 30)), and their composites.31 Some of these materials are found to exhibit promising HOR performance.32 For example, Huang et al. reported that the exchange current density of a Co2P/CoP@NF hybrid is ∼0.82 mA cm−2 for the HOR in alkaline electrolytes, which is close to that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (∼1.14 mA cm−2).30 By the nitridation of Ni-based coordination polymer nanosheets, Wang et al. prepared Ni3N nanoparticles, showing high HOR activity with a current density of ∼1.7 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 50 mV.33 Duan et al. reported that the tetragonal MoNi4 nanoalloy exhibits an exchange current density of 3.41 mA cm−2 for the HOR in alkaline electrolytes, which is 1.4 times higher than that of Pt/C.23 Roy et al. used Ketjenblack carbon supported Ni95Cu5 nanoparticles as an anode and Pd/C as a cathode for alkaline membrane fuel cells (AMFCs), which exhibit a power density of ∼350 mW cm−2 at 80 °C.34 However, they still have a huge gap with proton exchange membrane fuel cells (power density: ∼1 W cm−2).35 Furthermore, electrode catalysts may be in transient periods of high overpotential during cold startup or due to localized flooding, and thus HOR catalysts must remain stable at an overpotential of at least 0.3 V to reduce the risk of passivation.36 However, transition metal-based catalysts are prone to passivation at high potential in alkaline media. For example, the famous Ni-based HOR catalysts quickly deactivate at overpotentials above 0.1 V, due to the formation of hydroxides.37
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are composed of isolated single metal atoms dispersed on substrates. Due to fully exposed uniform active sites, SACs exhibit remarkable activity and selectivity in electrochemical conversions, far exceeding the conventional nano and bulk catalysts.38 In addition, SACs can maximize the utilization of atoms, thus effectively reducing the cost of metal catalysts. The strong electronic interaction between the single atom and the substrate makes it highly thermodynamically stable. Therefore, SACs have attracted intensive research interest in recent years.39,40 Recently, Mao et al. reported that the isolated Ni atoms dispersed on Ru nanosheets (RuNi1) show outstanding catalytic activity and stability for the HOR in alkaline media.41 The RuNi1 catalysts had a high mass activity of 2.70 A mg−1, which is about 6.3 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Ru-Ni bimetallic nanocrystals.41
Graphene, as a one-atom-thick 2D carbon material, is considered to be an excellent substrate for SACs, due to its unique structural and electronic properties, such as large surface area, high electrical conductivity, good stability, and high dispersion for electrocatalysts.42 Now, both experimental and computational results suggested that graphene supported SACs have attractive potential in energy-related electrocatalytic reactions, for example, the ORR,43 oxygen evolution reaction,44 hydrogen evolution reaction,45 CO2 reduction reaction,46 and nitrogen reduction reaction.47 However, to the best of our knowledge, the investigation of graphene supported SACs rarely focuses on the HOR activity in alkaline media.48
In this work, we design a series of single metal atoms M anchored on graphene (M/G, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) as SACs to examine the alkaline HOR activities by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Firstly, the geometry and electronic structure, thermodynamic and electrochemical stability, and adsorption properties of M/G were carefully investigated. Then, the alkaline HOR performance of M/G was explored, based on the full free energy profile including the reaction barriers and H adsorption free energy. Remarkably, Pt/G and Ni/G were found to exhibit both high HOR activity and strong electrochemical stability. This work could provide a bright perspective for understanding the detailed HOR mechanism in alkaline media and searching for cheap and efficient HOR electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cells (AFCs).
Theoretical approach
The spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the PBE exchange–correlation functional within the generalized gradient approximation implemented in the DMol3 code.49–51 The long-range electrostatic interaction was considered using Grimme's PBE + D2 method, which has been found to be a good choice for describing the interaction of graphene with transition metal atoms and surfaces.52–55 The valence electrons were described using the double numerical plus polarization basis set, while the metal ion cores were treated using the density functional semicore pseudopotential.56 The real-space global orbital cutoff radius was set as 4.9 Å. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 8 × 8 × 1 k-point mesh. The geometry optimization was carried out until the convergence threshold of 1 × 10−5 Hartree for energy, 2 × 10−3 Hartree Å−1 for force, and 5 × 10−3 Å for displacement. The transition state (TS) connecting the initial state (IS) and the final state (FS) was determined using the LST/QST method and verified by frequency calculations.57
The M/G catalyst was built by doping a metal atom M (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) into a divacancy site of the periodic 5 × 5 graphene supercell. The lattice constant of graphene is calculated to be 2.461 Å by using the PBE + D2 method, which is in good accordance with the rev-vdW-DF2 calculated (2.46 Å (ref. 58)) and experimental values (2.459 Å (ref. 59)). The divacancy graphene was chosen because these metal atoms anchored on the divacancy graphene were found to be thermodynamically stable and even more stable than those on the pristine and mono-vacancy graphene.60 The vacuum space was set to 20 Å in the z-direction to avoid the interactions between periodic images.
To consider the alkaline solution environment, the alkaline electrolyte/electrode interface was constructed using two layers of solvent water containing K+/OH− on the M/G surfaces, involving 22 H2O molecules and two K+/OH− ions (see Fig. S1†). The two-layer H2O solvent can effectively stabilize the hydroxyl species to form solvated OH− anions.61 Furthermore, the double water layer model has been found to be sufficient to describe the water–solid interface, due to the negligible change in the adsorbate binding energy with increasing solvent layers from 1 to 3.62 For two hydroxyl groups, one was used to create a solvated OH−, while the other was used to simulate an adsorbed OH*. Two K+ ions were added to keep the electroneutrality of the system. The possible different initial configurations of the interface model were first simulated by the first-principles dynamic (DFT-MD) method for 10 ps, followed by further optimization by the DFT (PBE + D2) method to obtain the most stable structure. Note that all the atoms in the interface model were fully relaxed in the calculations, that is, the graphene support, metal atoms, solvent water molecules, and K+/OH− ions are allowed to move freely. Similar interface models have been successfully applied to previous electrocatalyst studies.61,63–65
For an electrochemical reaction, the free energy change ΔG as a function of electrode potential U was calculated by the approach proposed by Nørskov et al.66 ΔG = ΔG0 – neU + ΔGpH + ΔGfield(1)where n is the number of electrons transferred at electrode potential U; ΔG0 is the free energy change at pH = 0 and U = 0 with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). ΔG0 was determined by ΔG0 = ΔE + ΔZPE – TΔS, where ΔE, ΔZPE, and ΔS are the change of the electronic energy, zero-point energy, and entropy at temperature T, respectively. Note that G(H+ + e−) is equal to 1/2G(H2) at pH = 0 and U = 0, because the reaction of H+ + e− ↔ 1/2H2 is in equilibrium under standard conditions. G(OH−) was determined by G(H2O) − G(H+), due to the equilibrium reaction of H+ + OH− ↔ H2O in water solution.61 In addition, at pH ≠ 0, the free energy of the H+ ion is corrected by the concentration dependence of the free energy: ΔGpH = −kbT × ln[H+] = kbT × ln10 × pH, where kb is the Boltzmann constant. In this work, we used a pH value of 13 according to the experimental conditions.12,13 The influence of the electric field (ΔGfield = ∼0.015 eV (ref. 66)) was much weaker, and thus was neglected.61,66,67
The adsorption energy Eads on M/G was calculated using the equation: Eads = Eadsorbate/sub – (Eadsorbate + Esub)(2)where Esub, Eadsorbate, and Eadsorbate/sub are the total energy of the clean M/G slab, the free adsorbate, and the adsorbate on M/G, respectively.
Based on the transition state theory,68 the rate constant k of an elementary step in the HOR was calculated as follows: (3)where ħ and R are the Planck's constant and the gas constant, respectively; QIS and QTS are the partition functions at the IS and the TS, respectively; Ea is the free energy barrier of the reaction.
The d-band center (εd) of the metal atom M in M/G was calculated by the following equation: (4)where ρd(E) represents the density of the d states of the M atom at energy level E.
The p-band center (εp) of the C atom in M/G was determined by the following equation: (5)where ρp(E) represents the density of the p states of the C atom at energy level E.
Deformation electron densities (DEDs) were computed by the total electron density with the density of the isolated atoms subtracted.69
Results and discussion
Structure properties
The M/G catalysts are composed of a metal atom M (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) embedded in double vacancy graphene. As shown in Fig. 1, the anchored metal atoms are found to protrude slightly out of the graphene plane, due to the larger radii of the metal atoms compared with the carbon atom. The height of metal atoms over the graphene surface gradually decreases in the following order Pt/G (0.763 Å) > Cr/G (0.757 Å) > Mn/G (0.693 Å) > Fe/G (0.628 Å) > Co/G (0.498 Å) > Ni/G (0.017 Å), see Table S1.† For 3d transition metal anchored M/G, the binding of M with the graphene substrate is strengthened with the increasing atomic number of M, mirrored by the decreasing M-ortho-C bond length from 1.974 Å in Cr/G to 1.891 Å in Ni/G and the increasing M-ortho-C binding energies (−4.03 eV (Cr/G), −4.27 eV (Mn/G), −5.22 eV (Fe/G), −5.64 eV (Co/G), and −6.28 eV (Ni/G), see Table S1†). For Pt/G, the Pt-ortho-C bond length is calculated to be 1.981 Å (Table S1†). The corresponding Pt-ortho-C binding energy is −7.10 eV, which is apparently stronger than those of 3d transition metal atoms. In addition, upon binding of the 3d transition metal atoms (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni), the graphene substrate is hardly deformed and almost remains in the a plane, while the carbon atoms around the Pt metal center in Pt/G are a little convex due to the stronger interaction with Pt. In M/G (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt), the ortho-C-meta-C bond near the metal center changes from 1.44 Å in pristine graphene to 1.39–1.47 Å, while the change of the C–C bonds in the far away area is negligible. Note that the benchmark calculations using the HSE06 functional were performed to assess the accuracy of the PBE + D2 method. As shown in Table S1,† the binding energy of M-ortho-C in M/G calculated by the PBE + D2 method is in good accordance with the HSE06 results (see Table S1†), suggesting the reliability of the chosen computational strategy.

The Hirshfeld population analysis of M/G (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) exhibits partial charges: +0.15–+0.41e on the metal atom and −0.05–−0.11e on each neighboring ortho-C atom (see Table 1 and Fig. S2†), suggesting the electron transfer from the metal center to the graphene substrate. That is, the metal atom is activated to be more electrophilic by the graphene support. Therefore, the metal center in M/G might be the active site for adsorbing a nucleophilic species (such as OH−), while the neighboring ortho-C atoms are the active site for adsorbing an electrophilic species (such as H+). To explore the electrons' distribution and the binding nature in these doped graphene sheets, the DED was calculated and is plotted in Fig. 1b. The apparent electron reorganization around the metal M atom and its adjacent ortho-C atoms indicates the strong chemical binding between M and the graphene substrate. However, the electronic density of graphene in the region far away from the metal center changes negligibly. All these give us information that the M-ortho-C region should be the active site for the HOR.

The electronic structures of M/G (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) are further investigated using the plots of the partial density of states (PDOS) as shown in Fig. S3.† All the considered M/G catalysts clearly reveal their metallic character. The valence and conduction bands in the range of −10–5 eV for M/Gs are dominated by C-p and M-d states. Note that the M d-orbitals show a major contribution to the DOS near the Fermi level. The metal atom doping generates more electrons near the Fermi level, facilitating electron transmission. With the increasing metal atomic number, the primary peak of M-d states in M/G gradually decreases from 0.18 eV for Cr/G and passes through the Fermi level to −1.81 eV for Pt/G (see Fig. S3†). However, the reactivity of surface atoms on catalysts was found to be determined by the localized states below the Fermi level rather than the states in all energy ranges.70,71 Herein, the p-band center (εp) of ortho-C atoms and the d-band center (εd) of metal M atoms for M/G were calculated based on the integral domain from minimum energy to the Fermi level. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, with respect to the Fermi level, the values of εp (ortho-C) are calculated to be −3.48, −3.74, −3.69, −3.63, −3.70, and −3.82 eV for M/G (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt), respectively, suggesting the electron structure of ortho-C is effectively tuned by the anchored metal atoms. For the d-band center of M/G, the value of εd is calculated to be the lowest for Pt/G (−4.19 eV) and moves up in the order Pt/G (−4.19 eV) < Cr/G (−3.78 eV) < Mn/G (−3.49 eV) < Fe/G (−3.19 eV) < Co/G (−3.12 eV) < Ni/G (−2.91 eV).

Structural stability

Formation energy. 
The dangling bonds of defective graphene may be saturated with hydrogen.58 Therefore, the stability of the divacancy graphene with different hydrogen terminations (DG-nH) was first considered, including non-hydrogenated (DG), mono-hydrogenated (DG-4H), and di-hydrogenated ones (DG-8H). As shown in Fig. S4,† the most stable structure is found to be DG-8H. Then, the formation energy (Ef) of M/G was calculated by (6)where EM/G and EDG-nH are the total energy of M/G and DG-nH, respectively; μH2 is the chemical potential of the H2 molecule; μM is the chemical potential of Mx+ for Mx+ (OH−)x in solution at the HOR equilibrium potential (−0.767 V vs. SHE). As shown in Table 2, the values of Ef are calculated to be 1.80, 1.39, 0.45, −0.21, −0.82, and −2.24 eV for M/G, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt, respectively, suggesting that the stability of M/G increases in the following order Cr/G < Mn/G < Fe/G < Co/G < Ni/G < Pt/G.

Oxidation potential. 
The electrochemical stability of catalysts is critical for their practical application in AFCs. However, in the alkaline environment, metal catalysts, especially non-precious metals, are more reactive. They tend to be oxidized and then dissolved to form metal hydroxides, resulting in deactivation of the catalysts at a lower potential. Therefore, the HOR catalysts must have a wider potential window in the stable state in real application. To evaluate the electrochemical stability of M/G, the oxidation potential (Uox) of M/G was calculated by the following formula:44 Uox = U0ox (metl, bulk) − (EM/G − EG − EM)/ne(7)where EM/G and EG are the total energies of M/G and the graphene substrate, respectively; EM is the total energy of the metal atom in the bulk structure; U0ox (metl, bulk) is the standard oxidation potential of the bulk metal; n is the number of electrons transferred in the oxidation. The Uox of M/G is calculated to be −2.15, −1.91, −0.93, −0.62, 0.25, and 0.62 V for Mn/G, Cr/G, Fe/G, Co/G, Ni/G, and Pt/G (see Table 2), respectively. It can be found that the oxidation potential of Mn/G, Cr/G and Fe/G is much lower than the HOR equilibrium potential (U0HOR = −0.767 V) at pH = 13, suggesting that they would suffer from intense oxidation and thus not stable in the HOR potential region. For Co/G, only a narrow potential window (−0.767–−0.62 V) is applied to keep the catalyst in an electrochemical stable state for the HOR. Promisingly, the Uox of Ni/G and Pt/G (0.25 and 0.62 V) is much higher than the U0HOR, indicating the excellent electrochemical stability at operating potentials of AFCs.36

Adsorption properties
The adsorption of possible species involved in the alkaline HOR on M/G (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) in the vacuum environment were characterized, including OH*, H*, , and H2O*. In addition, the HOR is carried out in an alkaline environment, which is rich in hydroxyl species. Therefore, the co-adsorption of OH* with H*, , and H2O* was also calculated to study the influence of OH*. The stable adsorption configurations are presented in Fig. S5 and S6,† and the corresponding adsorption energies are listed in Tables 1 and S2–S4.†

OH adsorption. 
As shown in Fig. S5,† the nucleophilic hydroxyl species is stably adsorbed at the M top site, i.e. the positive charge center of the M/G catalysts. The interaction of OH* with M/G is found to be the strong chemisorption, mirrored by the short M–OH distance of 1.747–2.042 Å (see Table S5†) and the high OH adsorption energy of −2.05–−2.48 eV (see Table 1). Moreover, the OH* adsorption energies of Cr/G, Mn/G, Fe/G, Co/G, and Ni/G are 0.19–0.28 eV higher than that of Pt/G (−2.05 eV), suggesting that the 3d transition metal SACs exhibit stronger oxophilicity than the noble metal Pt SAC. Note that the OH* adsorption energies on M/G (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) are apparently lower than those on Pt(110) (−3.507 eV),72 Pt(111),61 and Ni(111),61 suggesting that the antioxidant capacity of M/G is largely improved compared to the bulk metal.
It is known that the chemisorption of metal materials is actually decided by the underlying electronic structure.70 In this work, the close correlation between the OH* adsorption energy and the d-band center (εd) of M/G is confirmed by a linear relationship of Eads(OH*) = −0.28 × εd – 3.25, R2 = 0.90, see Fig. 3a, where the adsorption energy of OH* exhibits a strengthened trend with the increase of εd. This situation can be attributed to the following reason: the interaction of the hydroxyl species with the d electrons of the metal center for M/G gives rise to bonding and anti-bonding states. The anti-bonding states go across the Fermi level, while the bonding states are positioned below the Fermi level. Therefore, the M/G with a higher d-band center forms more empty anti-bonding orbitals above the Fermi level (i.e. the lower occupied antibonding orbitals) in the OH*-adsorbed state, leading to a stronger interaction between M/G with hydroxyl species.

The atomic H is apt to get adsorbed at the negatively charged ortho-C atom of M/G, which is in accordance with the situation on metal-embedded carbon nanotubes (CoCNTs,73 MnCNTs,74 and Co/N-CNTs (ref. 75)) and heteroatom doped graphene.76 After H adsorption, the metal M atom in M/G is depressed to a certain extent, and the ortho-C–H bond is inclined to the surface with H–C–C angles of 113.8–116.7° (see Table S5†), which is attributed to the maximum sp3 hybridization of the electronic state for ortho-C to bind with H, M, and two neighbouring meta-C. The H* adsorption energy is calculated to be −3.08, −3.01, −2.98, −2.97, −2.94, and −2.90 eV for M/G, M = Cr, Co, Fe, Ni, Mn, and Pt (see Table 1), respectively, which is weakened linearly with the downward shift of the p-band center of ortho-C (Eads(H*) = −0.53 × εp – 4.94, R2 = 0.99, see Fig. 3b). In addition, the H* adsorption energy is also closely related to the amount of negative charge on the ortho-C site (Eads = 2.50 × q − 2.78, R2 = 0.92, see Fig. 3c), i.e. the more negative the charge on ortho-C of M/G, the stronger the adsorption of H*, because electrophilic H prefers negative charge centers.
For the co-adsorption of H* with OH*, the H* and OH* tend to adsorb at two adjacent ortho-C sites of M/G (Fig. S6a†). Compared to the single-adsorbed H*, the adsorption energy of the co-adsorbed H* (Eads = −2.91–−2.68 eV) decreases by 0.07–0.22 eV (Table S2†), suggesting a weakening effect of OH* on the H* adsorption, similar to the result on Pt(110).72 This situation is beneficial to the oxidative desorption of H* by OH*.


H2 adsorption. 
Molecular H2 prefers to vertically adsorb at the top of metal center M for M/G. The related  adsorption energy is calculated to be −0.16–−0.19 eV (Table 1), indicating a weak physisorption of H2 on M/G (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt). In addition, compared to free H2 (0.748 Å), the H–H bond in the adsorbed  is stretched to 0.793–0.826 Å, facilitating the further decomposition of H2.
When  and OH* are co-adsorbed on M/G, they are stably located at two ortho-C atoms in the para-position. The  adsorption energy in the co-adsorption state is increased to −0.20–−0.83 eV (Table S3†), due to the polarization of H2 induced by OH*. Therefore, OH* can promote the adsorption and activation of H2 on M/G.


H2O adsorption. 
The H2O molecule is inclined to bind at the metal-top site of the M/G catalysts. The adsorption energy of H2O* is calculated to be −0.36–−0.43 eV on M/G, which is apparently weaker than that on pure metal surfaces (−0.448 eV on Ni(110) and −0.469 eV on Pt(110)).72 For the co-adsorbed H2O* and OH*, the H2O* and OH* are largely stabilized by the strong  hydrogen bond. Therefore, the H2O* adsorption energy is calculated to be −0.58–−0.62 eV in the co-adsorption state (Table S4†). The enhancing effect of OH* on H2O* adsorption is also found on Pt(110).72

Phase diagram
At the AFC anode, the catalyst surface may be covered by various adsorbents (such as H*, O*, OH*, and H2O*), due to the activation of water (reactions 1–3). When the conditions of potential (U) and pH are varied, the most stable state of the surface may change, forming different surface phases. Herein, we considered four types of surface states (i.e. the H2O*-, H*-, OH*-, and O*-covered surfaces) in water as a function of U at pH = 13 for M/G, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt. The relevant phase diagrams at 298 and 340 K (ref. 14) are shown in Fig. 4 and S7,† respectively, where the free energy for liquid water on M/G is defined as ΔGwater(U) = 0. For the states involving electron transfer, the free energy changes linearly with U, that is, ΔGwaterH*(U) = ΔGwaterH*(0) + eU, ΔGwaterOH*(U) = ΔGwaterOH*(0) − eU, and ΔGwaterO*(U) = ΔGwaterO*(0) − 2eU. H2O(liquid) + * ↔ OH* + e− + H+(1) OH* + * ↔ O* + e− + H+(2) * + e− + H+ ↔ H*(3)

The free energy for liquid water at 298 K is defined as ΔGwater(U) = 0 (pink line). ΔGwaterH*(U) = ΔGwaterH*(0) + eU (red line), ΔGwaterOH*(U) = ΔGwaterOH*(0) − eU (green line), and ΔGwaterO*(U) = ΔGwaterO*(0) − 2eU (blue line). 
As shown in Fig. 4, at 298 K and very negative potentials, all the catalyst surfaces prefer to adsorb hydrogen, and the formation of H* is downhill in free energy at potentials below −0.31–−0.45 V for M/G, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt. With the positive shift of potential, the M/G surfaces tend to adsorb hydroxyl species, and then bind with oxygen at much higher positive potentials. For the 3d transition metal anchored graphene (Cr/G, Mn/G, Fe/G, Co/G, and Ni/G), the H* phase is directly transferred to the OH* phase at −0.31–−0.43 V, and water is not the most stable structure over the entire range of potentials, similar to the phase diagram of Ni(111).57 However, on Pt/G, a potential window of the surface with a water overlayer appears in the range of −0.45–−0.14 V, similar to the situation on Pt(111).77,78 The potentials for forming the OH* phase on Cr/G, Mn/G, Fe/G, Co/G, and Ni/G are about 0.17–0.29 V lower than that on Pt/G, suggesting the stronger oxophilicity of the 3d transition metal anchored on graphene, compared with Pt/G. At pH = 13, the equilibrium potential of the HOR (U0HOR) is −0.767 V vs. SHE. In the low HOR overpotential region (about −0.767 to −0.45 V), the H* state is more thermodynamically favored than the OH* state on all considered M/G, suggesting that the OH* adsorption process is not competitive with the HOR on the M/G surfaces. Therefore, at this potential region, M/G can effectively avoid the passivation phenomenon where the active surfaces of transition metal nanoparticles and blocks (such as Ni37,79) are blocked by a large number of OH*. When the temperature rises to 340 K, the phase diagrams of M/G are similar to those at 298 K (see Fig. S7†), but the potential of OH* formation negatively shifts by about 0.11 V, suggesting the slight influence of temperature on the antioxidant capacity of M/G.
HOR performance

HOR pathway. 
The optimized model of the K+/OH− electrolyte/M/G electrode interface is shown in Fig. S1.† In the model, one hydroxyl species is dissolved in water to form a solvated hydroxyl anion (OH−), while the other is adsorbed on the M/G surface, to consider the effect of adsorbed hydroxyl (OH*) on the HOR. The electrical neutrality of the system is maintained by the K+ ions. In addition, the water layer is found to be located approximately 3 Å away from the M/G surfaces, in good agreement with previous theoretical findings.65,73,74,80
In the the alkaline environment, the HOR on M/G takes place in two major steps: the initial H* formation from H2 (reactions 4–6), followed by the oxidation of H* by hydroxyl species to yield water (reactions 7 and 8). The related elementary processes are presented in Fig. 5, and the free energy diagrams are shown in Fig. 6. H2 + 2* → 2H* (Tafel)(4) H2 + OH− + * → H* + H2O + e− (Heyrovsky)(5) H2 + OH* → H* + H2O(6) H* + OH− → H2O + e− + * (Volmer)(7) H* + OH* → H2O + 2*(8)

 Fig. 6  Free energy diagrams of the elementary reactions for the HOR on the M/G catalysts (in eV). IS, TS, and FS are the initial state, transition state, and final state in the reactions, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. 5, the initial H* formation involves three possible pathways. One is the Tafel reaction (reaction 4), where the H2 molecule undergoes direct H–H bond scission to yield two H* adsorbed at the adjacent ortho-C sites of M/G (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt). This process is exothermic by 0.97–1.21 eV with a free energy barrier of 0.46–0.68 eV. Another pathway is the reaction of H2 with an adsorbed OH* on the M/G surfaces to form an adsorbed H* and release a H2O molecule (reaction 6). This reaction is exothermic by 0.81–1.17 eV, but hindered by a high free energy barrier of 0.71–1.21 eV. Remarkably, the Heyrovsky reaction (reaction 5) affords a favorable pathway for the H* formation. In this process, the H2 molecule combines with an OH− in electrolyte and discharges a water molecule and an electron to form an adsorbed H*. This reaction is exothermic by 0.63–0.87 eV, and just needs to overcome the free energy barrier of 0.28–0.49 eV, which is the lowest among the three competitive H* formation pathways for M/G (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt).
Once the adsorbed H* is formed, two possible pathways would immediately follow, that is, the oxidation of H* by a solvated OH− (i.e. Volmer reaction) to release an electron and a water molecule, and/or the recombination of H* with an adsorbed OH* to discharge a water molecule. As shown in Fig. 6, both pathways are exothermic, but the free energy barrier of the Volmer reaction (0.20–0.34 eV) is apparently lower than that of the H* and OH* recombination (0.33–0.87 eV), suggesting that the H* oxidation prefers the Volmer pathway.
The free energy diagrams (Fig. 6) suggest that the most favorable HOR pathway on M/G is the Heyrovsky–Volmer mechanism, and the rate-determining step is the Heyrovsky reaction. This is in accordance with the situation on polycrystalline platinum (Ptpc) and carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt/C) reported by Sheng et al.,81 where the HOR in aqueous KOH is found to preferentially go through the Heyrovsky–Volmer mechanism with the Heyrovsky reaction as the rate determining step. For M/G (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Pt), the free energy barrier of the rate-determining Heyrovsky step is calculated to be 0.49, 0.46, 0.41, 0.38, 0.37, and 0.28 eV, respectively, while the corresponding rate constant k is 5.72 × 105/6.48 × 106, 6.98 × 105/8.06 × 106, 5.76 × 106/1.33 × 107, 8.72 × 107/4.73 × 108, 9.81 × 107/9.14 × 108, and 2.37 × 108/1.01 × 1010 s−1 per site at 298/340 K, respectively (see Tables S6 and S7†). It can be observed that both noble metal Pt and 3d transition metal atom anchored graphene SACs exhibit high HOR activity, and the activity increases in the following order Cr/G < Fe/G < Co/G < Ni/G < Mn/G < Pt/G.

Descriptor of H adsorption free energy
Along the optimal Heyrovsky–Volmer pathway, the adsorbed H* is involved in the HOR, whereas the hydroxyl species participate as the solvent OH− rather than the adsorbed OH*. Therefore, the HOR activity of M/G is dominantly affected by the H* adsorption. This is in good agreement with the results reported by Durst82 and Lu.83 Durst et al. studied the HOR on the Pt, Ir, and Pd surfaces, and found that the H binding energy (HBE) is the unique and sole descriptor for the alkaline HOR.82 Furthermore, by comparing the HOR behavior on the Pt/C, PtNi/C, and acid–PtNi/C electrocatalysts, Lu et al. suggested that the HBE of the catalysts is the major factor affecting the alkaline HOR activity, while the adsorbed OH* has less influence.83
To further explore the relationship of the H* adsorption with the HOR activity of M/G, the optimal H* adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) is derived via thermodynamic calculations. First, according to the computational hydrogen electrode model, GH+ + Ge− + ΔGpH = 1/2GH2, where ΔGpH = kbT × ln10 × pH at T = 298 K and PH2 = 1 atm. In this work, pH = 13. Thus, (8)Moreover, GH2O = GH+ + GOH−(9)due to H2O ↔ H+ + OH− in equilibrium in water solution.61,84
Based on eqn (8) and (9), the free energy change for the HOR via the favorable Heyrovsky–Volmer mechanism (reactions 5 and 7) can be calculated as follows: ΔGHeyrovsky = GH* + GH2O + Ge− − (GH2 + GOH− + G*) = ΔGH* − 1.534(10) ΔGVolmer = GH2O + Ge− + G* − (GH* + GOH−) = −ΔGH*(11) ΔGHOR = ΔGHeyrovsky + ΔGVolmer = − 1.534 eV(12)
The whole HOR (ΔGHOR) is calculated to be exothermic by 1.534 eV at pH = 13, which agrees well with the experimental result.85 Furthermore, the thermodynamic theory suggests that the optimal HOR occurs when ΔGHeyrovsky = ΔGVolmer, from which ΔGH* = 0.767 eV is obtained. Therefore, an ideal HOR catalyst should exhibit a moderate H adsorption free energy of ΔGH* ≈ 0.767 eV at pH = 13. In this work, the values of (0.767–ΔGH*) are calculated to be 0.357, 0.423, 0.442, 0.464, 0.541, and 0.553 eV for Pt/G, Mn/G, Ni/G, Co/G, Fe/G, and Cr/G (see Table 2), respectively, which shows a positive linear relationship with the free energy barriers of the HOR (Ea = 0.98 × |0.767–ΔGH*| − 0.06, R2 = 0.98, see Fig. 7). These indicate that the closer the H* adsorption free energy is to 0.767 eV, the lower the free energy barrier, and thus the higher the activity of M/G for the HOR at pH = 13. Therefore, ΔGH* can be used as a descriptor of the HOR activity for the M/G catalysts in the alkaline media.

Conclusions
In summary, the HOR performance of M/G SACs (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt) in alkaline media is theoretically investigated on the basis of DFT calculations. The calculations suggest that the metal M and ortho-C atoms in M/Gs form the active center for the HOR. The optimal HOR pathway on M/Gs is the Heyrovsky–Volmer mechanism, and the rate determining step is the former Heyrovsky reaction. Besides the free energy barrier, the H adsorption free energy is also a descriptor of the alkaline HOR activity for M/G SACs. The HOR activity is calculated to increase in the following order Cr/G < Fe/G < Co/G < Ni/G < Mn/G < Pt/G. However, Mn/G, Cr/G, Fe/G, and Co/G are easily oxidized at the working potentials of the HOR. Alternatively, Pt/G and Ni/G exhibit both high HOR activity and superior antioxidant capacity, indicating their great potential for application as anodic electrocatalysts for AFCs.
