    , Accepted 28th February 2019First published on 4th March 2019AbstractSemiconductor-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production have been considered as one of the most promising solutions to the current worldwide energy crisis. However, the low solar energy utilization efficiency and the high photogenerated electron–hole recombination rate limit their applications severely. Here, based on the time-dependent density functional theory and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, we propose that one-dimensional Janus MoSSe nanotube is a promising photocatalyst with high catalytic efficiency. Our results show that the Janus MoSSe nanotube prossesses suitable direct band-gaps and appropriate band edge positions that perfectly meet the requirements of water redox reactions. In particular, it exhibits pronounced optical absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum. Most importantly, due to the built-in electric field, an ultra-long carrier lifetime of 33 ns has been observed, which is comparable to that of TiO2. Such extremely long carrier lifetime can efficiently reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes, leading to high solar energy conversion efficiency. These advanced properties make the Janus MoSSe nanotube a promising candidate for further water splitting applications.
1. Introduction
Since the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda et al.,1 the photocatalytic splitting of water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) has been considered as one of the potential ways to produce clean energy. When the energy of the incident photons is equal to or greater than the band gap of the photocatalyst, the photogenerated electrons and holes are produced in the semiconductor photocatalyst and then transfer to the surface/interface for water redox reactions. In this process, the energy of photons is first converted into the excited energy of the semiconductor photocatalyst and then transferred to a clean energy source, such as hydrogen. This attractive technology has shown prospect in degrading organic pollutants and producing hydrogen, which is expected to solve the current energy crisis and environmental pollution.2–4
During the past few decades, researchers are committed to developing cheaper, highly efficient, and exclusive noble metal photocatalysts. Besides the traditional TiO2,1,2 many new materials including but not limited to g-C3N4,5 AgCl6 and transition metal disulfide (TMD)7,8 have been identified as promising photocatalysts for water splitting. However, the solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of the existing photocatalysts are too low to meet the practical demand. Their low light absorption efficiency and high rate of the photogenerated electron–hole recombination are the main obstacles. Recently, two dimensional (2D) materials have gained considerable interest for their large surface area, abundant surface states and tunable electronic properties, all of which are beneficial for photocatalytic applications.9–16 Among them, particular attention has been paid to 2D MoS2, since it is earth-abundant, easy to fabricate and most importantly, its optimized H* adsorption free energy is comparable to that of the noble metal Pt, showing potential applications in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).7,17–19 However, due to the strong excitonic effect, the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs in 2D MoS2 is too fast to meet the photocatalytic requirement. Very recently, a new kind of Janus-MoSSe monolayer was synthesized,20 which has attracted considerable attention due to its promising properties.21–23 In the Janus-MoSSe monolayer, there exists an out-of-plane built-in electric field, which can be ascribed to the discrepancy in electronegativity between the S and Se atoms. The built-in electric field can enhance the dielectric screening potential and weaken the excitonic binding energy, leading to a relatively slow photogenerated electron–hole recombination rate. The stronger the built-in electric field the longer the carriers live.24 Unfortunately, the carrier lifetime of 2D MoSSe monolayer is still too short, which hinders its applications in photocatalytic water splitting.24 In this sense, it is urgent and necessary to investigate new 2D photocatalytic materials with a longer timescale for electron–hole recombination.
In this study, we have paid attention to another nanostructure of Janus-MoSSe, namely nanotubes. Experimentally, TMD nanotube can be produced by rolling TMD flakes with the help of ethanol.25 Zhao et al. showed that the Janus TMD nanotubes are more stable than the traditional TMD nanotubes due to their small curvature energy penalty.26 By using the molecular dynamics simulations, Xiong et al. proved that the Janus monolayer MoSSe can spontaneously bend and even roll up into a nanotube structure.27 Though the geometry and stability of the Janus TMD nanotube have been studied in previous works, little is known about its electronic properties. In particular, the electron–hole recombination process is unclear. Therefore, in this study, we systematically investigated the electronic and optical properties of Janus-MoSSe nanotubes by means of the density functional theory (DFT). Our results show that the Janus MoSSe nanotube with an armchair edge and a selected diameter has a direct band gap of 1.44 eV and presents suitable band edge positions for water redox reactions. In addition, the Janus MoSSe nanotube shows strong optical absorbance in the visible-light region. Most importantly, the probability of the electron–hole recombination is found to be extremely low in Janus MoSSe nanotubes, with a lifetime of 33 ns, which is comparable to the value of pure rutile TiO2. The quantum efficiency of STH is also evaluated. The predicted quantum STH efficiency of Janus MoSSe nanotubes is up to 36.1%, indicating a powerful overall potential for future applications in water splitting.
2. Methods
Geometry optimization and adiabatic molecular dynamics (AMD) were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) based on the density functional theory.28,29 We employed a projector augmented-wave (PAW) method for ion–electron interactions, and the exchange–correlation potential was described by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) version of general gradient approximation. A plane-wave energy cutoff of 500 eV was used. The lattice constants and all atomic positions were fully relaxed by the conjugate gradient procedure until the atomic forces were smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1. The electronic iteration convergence criterion was set to 1 × 10−5 eV. The vacuum space along the x and y directions were set to 15 Å, which gave well-converged results. The Brillouin zone integration was sampled with a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 1 × 1 × 11.30 To simulate the electron–hole recombination, a time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) combined with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) was employed as implemented in the PYXAID code.31,32 NAMD was simulated using the fewest-switches algorithm for surface hopping, implemented within the framework of time-dependent Kohn–Sham theory. The system was heated to 300 K and a 5 ps AMD calculation in the microcanonical ensemble was performed with a 1 fs atomic time step, which gave the Hamiltonian of nonadiabatic couplings. The last 3 ps nonadiabatic Hamiltonian was then iterated 12 times to calculate the recombination dynamics over a long period. In total, 1000 initial conditions for the NAMD simulations were sampled randomly. NAMD simulations were performed with each initial condition and using 4000 random number sequences to compute the surface hopping probabilities.
3. Results and discussion
Similar to carbon nanotubes, one-dimension single wall MoSSe nanotubes can be formed by rolling the MoSSe monolayer along a specific direction.33,34 According to a previous study, an armchair type nanotube is more stable than a zigzag nanotube.34 Note that the armchair type nanotube shows an indirect-to-direct band gap transition with an increase in diameter.33,34 Therefore, in this study, we chose the A28 MoSSe nanotube (A-NT) as an example to study the electronic and photocatalytic properties, which shows a direct band gap. As shown in Fig. 1, the unit cell of an A28 MoSSe nanotube consists of 28 MoSSe units and the edge of its cross section formed an armchair shape. The diameter of an optimized A-NT was 25.34 Å. The Mo–S and Mo–Se bond lengths in optimized MoSSe monolayer were 2.42 Å and 2.53 Å, respectively (see Table S1 in ESI†). After rolling up into nanotubes, the Mo–S bonds in A-NT compressed to 2.38 Å and 2.40 Å, while the Mo–Se bonds extended to 2.56 Å and 2.58 Å. The stability of A-NT is crucial for experimental fabrication and practical applications. AMD simulations have been performed at 300 K to study its room-temperature thermal stability. A unit of nanotube consisting of 84 atoms was adopted in the simulations. As indicated by the AMD snapshots illustrated in Fig. S1,† the A-NT was well maintained within 5 ps and no significant changes were observed, demonstrating good stability at room temperature.

Now, we paid attention to its electronic properties by computing its band structure and density of states (DOS). The calculated band gap of monolayer MoSSe by PBE functional was 1.58 eV (see Fig. S2†), which is consistent with the experimental optical gap of 1.68 eV.20 Therefore, in the following calculations, we mainly focused on the results achieved by PBE functional. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the A-NT is a direct band gap semiconductor with a narrow band gap of 1.44 eV, in which the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) sit at the K*(0, 0, 1/3) point. In Fig. 1(c), we have also plotted the partial DOS of the A-NT. The results indicate that similar to its monolayer, the VBM and CBM of the nanotubes are mainly determined by the Mo-4d states.
An efficient photocatalyst should possess strong ability to harvest sunlight. To assess the optical performance, we calculated the absorption coefficient (α(E)) of A-NT, which is evaluated according to the following expression: (1)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. The imaginary part of the dielectric constant was determined by a summation over empty states using the following equation: (2)where c and v refer to the conduction and valence band states, respectively. μck represents the cell periodic part of the wave functions at the k point. The real part of the dielectric tensor ε1(ω) was obtained by a Kramers–Kronig transformation. As shown in Fig. 2, the A-NT shows an extraordinary light harvesting ability in the visible solar spectrum from 380 nm to 780 nm, which covers the whole visible spectrum. The outstanding optical absorption suggests that A-NT is a promising candidate to be a photocatalyst.

For overall photocatalytic water splitting, the band edge positions of the photocatalyst directly determine whether the water redox reactions can proceed spontaneously. In other words, the CBM should be above the reduction potential of H+/H2 (−4.44 eV vs. vacuum at pH = 0), while the VBM should be more negative than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (−5.67 eV vs. vacuum at pH = 0).2H+ + 2e− → H22H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+
Therefore, the minimum band gap for a suitable water splitting photocatalyst should be 1.23 eV. We aligned the band edge positions of A-NT relative to the redox levels of water as shown in Fig. 3(a). The redox potentials of the water splitting reaction are defined as the relative energies between the electrochemical potentials and the vacuum level. The intrinsic electric field perpendicular to the nanotube wall results in energy bending of the vacuum level from the inner surface to the outer surface.23,35,36 Consequently, the redox potential of water and the band edge positions of A-NT for inner and outer surfaces are shifted. Thus, here we defined the band alignment, as shown in Fig. 3(a), based on the different vacuum levels and the band edge positions, which could perfectly straddle the water redox potentials marked by the blue dash lines. It should be pointed out that an adequate driving force must be provided to trigger the water splitting process. The potential of the photogenerated electrons for HER is defined as the energy difference between the reduction potential of H+/H2 and CBM (ΔEH). Further, the potential of the photogenerated holes for OER is defined as the energy difference between VBM and the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (ΔEO). They represent the redox abilities of the photogenerated carriers and are important standards in the performance evaluation of photocatalysts. In our experiments, the required ΔEH was below 0.1 eV,37 while that of ΔEO was below 0.5 eV.38 The calculated ΔEH and ΔEO of A-NT at pH = 0 were 0.42 eV and 0.54 eV, respectively, both of which meet the required potentials for water redox reactions.
 Fig. 3  (a) Band alignments of A-NT. (b) The reaction mechanism of A-NT in photocatalytic water splitting. 
Janus A-NT has a large electric dipole moment, giving rise to a built-in electric field pointing from the outer surface to the inner surface. The photoexcited electrons and holes are, therefore, expected to move quickly in opposite directions, leading to the accumulation of electrons in the outer surface and holes in the inner surface. In this case, the electron–hole pairs would be separated efficiently. The HER mainly occurs on the outer surface and the OER occurs on the inner surface, as shown in Fig. 3(b). This mechanism could effectively decrease the recombination rate of carriers and improve the photocatalytic efficiency.
The intrinsic electric field in the Janus system affects not only the band alignment, but also the interactions between the Janus system and water. We calculated the projected density of states (PDOS) of water on different TMD monolayers as presented in Fig. S5.† In MoSSe/water, the band level of water on the Se surface is obviously higher than that on the S surface, which demonstrates that the DOS of water are affected by the intrinsic electric field. Moreover, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of water for MoSSe is significantly closer to the Fermi level of the system than those of water for MoSe2 and MoS2. In a water splitting reaction, the photo-generated carriers are required to be transferred from the photocatalysts to water. Thus, the intrinsic electric field significantly enhanced the migration of the photo-generated carriers and splitting of water.
To further evaluate the electron–hole recombination dynamics in A-NT, we performed the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations to predict the timescale of the electron–hole recombination. Fig. 4(a) shows the evolution of the population undergoing nonradiative electron–hole recombination in the A-NT system. The electron–hole recombination time was obtained by fitting the data with an exponential function: P(t) = exp(−t/τ), where τ represents the recombination time. Surprisingly, the predicted recombination time for an electron–hole pair was up to 33 ns, which is two orders of magnitude longer than that in the Janus-MoSSe monolayer24 and the MoS2 monolayer,39 and even comparable to that of the perfect rutile TiO2.40

The extension of electron–hole recombination time is rationalized by the intrinsic electric field in Janus materials. As discussed above, the discrepancy in the electronegativities between the S and Se atoms leads to a large electric dipole moment. According to previous studies,24 the electric dipole moment can lead to a strong Coulomb screening effect, resulting in a small overlapping of the out-of-plane wave function. Thus, the recombination probability of the electron–hole pair was effectively decreased. Moreover, when rolling a flat monolayer of Janus MoSSe into a nanotube, the three-fold rotation symmetry was broken, which brought a new effective electric field into the Janus MoSSe nanotube. Such out-of-plane polarization was observed in a wrinkled MoSe2 monolayer, which was mainly contributed by the Mo atoms.41 The remarkable out-of-plane polarization induced in a geometric structure gives rise to a larger electric dipole-moment than that in the monolayer. In this sense, the screening potential is further enhanced, resulting in a relatively smaller exciton binding energy. As a result, the recombination time of the photo-generated electron–hole pair is significantly prolonged.
In Fig. 4(b), we present the Fourier transforms of the energy gaps. The phonon peak at 423 cm−1 can be identified as the out-of-plane A1g mode of the TMD system.42,43 The dominant vibrational mode peaks at the frequency of 101 cm−1. The low phonon modes coupling with the electronic subsystem participate in the relaxation of excited electrons and contribute to a longer carrier lifetime. Note that the low-frequency mode of the TMD system usually exists in the interlayer system. The presence of low-frequency mode suggests that A-NT behaves like a multilayer TMD system,42 which can be ascribed to the strong built-in electric field in the Janus MoSSe nanotube. Accordingly, the presence of inter-layer-like excitons in the Janus MoSSe nanotube significantly extends the carrier lifetime compared to their intra-layer counterparts in the MoS2 or MoSe2 systems.44 Consequently, we believe that Janus MoSSe nanotube shows superiority in electron–hole recombination dynamics compared to the traditional TMD materials.
In this study, we also quantitatively evaluated the STH efficiency using the methods proposed by Chen et al.36,45 According to the reaction process, STH efficiency is defined as the product of the efficiency of light absorption ηabs and carrier utilization ηcu. ηSTH = ηabs × ηcu(3)
The efficiency of light absorption is defined as: (4)where P(hω) are the AM1.5G solar energy flux at the photon energy hω and Eg is the band gap of the photocatalyst. The denominator represents the total power density of the reference sunlight spectrum (AM1.5G) and the numerator gives the light power density absorbed by the photocatalyst. It is apparent that a smaller band gap leads to a higher light adsorption efficiency. Accordingly, the calculated light absorption efficiency (ηabs) was up to 62.1% for A-NT. The efficiency of carrier utilization (ηcu) is defined as: (5)where ΔG is the free energy of water splitting (1.23 eV) and the rest of numerator represents the effective photocurrent density. Here, E represents the photon energy that can be actually utilized in the process of water splitting. As discussed above, for both HER and OER, extra energy is needed to overcome the barriers, which plays an important role in determining the STH efficiency. In this work, since the band edge positions of A-NT meet the required potentials (see Fig. 3(a)), we assume that E equals the band gap. The calculated energy conversion efficiency of carrier utilization for A-NT is about 58.2%. According to the definition of STH, ηSTH is 36.1% for A-NT, which is much higher than those reported for other photocatalysts.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, based on the TDDFT, we have shown that MoSSe nanotube is a new candidate for the photocatalytic water splitting. Without the loss of generality, we have taken A28 nanotube as an example to discuss its electronic and optical properties and carrier dynamics. The proposed nanotube exhibits a direct band gap of 1.44 eV, suitable band edge positions and pronounced light absorption in the visible spectral range. In addition, by performing NAMD, we predicted an extremely long carrier lifetime in A-NT. Considering the high experimental feasibility, we believe that MoSSe nanotube is a promising candidate for the photocatalytic splitting of water with high performance in the future.
