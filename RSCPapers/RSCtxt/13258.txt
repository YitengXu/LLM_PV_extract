    , Accepted 10th August 2022First published on 10th August 2022AbstractA paired electrolytic system was constructed with 4-(tert-butyl)phenoxy-decorated cobalt phthalocyanine (TBP-CoPc) and pyrene-tethered 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxy (Py-TEMPO), which were non-covalently immobilized on carbon nanotubes to catalyze the CO2 reduction to CO and the oxidation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), respectively. Coupled electrolysis tests in a single electrolyzer with tri-electrode or di-electrode systems revealed that the potential change during electrolysis determined the product distribution, and a 96.9% FE for CO as well as 90.8% FE for FDCA was achieved with a cell voltage of 2.5 V in the di-electrode mode. More importantly, a sunlight-driven electrolytic system successfully drove this coupling reaction efficiently, paving the way for future developments in the production of high value-added chemicals with renewable energy sources.
As is well known, global warming primarily caused by anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has a detrimental impact on the global environment.1 At the same time, human society is eager for more reliable energy storage for economic and technological development, especially as fossil fuels are gradually petering out nowadays. The reduction of CO2 to fuels as a source of clean and renewable energy provides an ideal route to ‘kill two birds with one stone’. The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) represents an appealing route due to its advantages of mild reaction conditions, ease of scaling up, ability to control the reaction by potential and renewable electricity supply.2
In order to make the ECO2RR feasible, an anodic reaction providing protons and electrons is a necessary part of a complete electrolytic system, which typically refers to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in aqueous solution. However, the OER is a sluggish process and needs a lot of energy to drive it, while the oxygen product is not valuable compared to its cost.3 Therefore, it is desirable to replace the OER with other oxidative reactions of organic substrates that are less energy-demanding and produce more valuable chemicals. In this context, the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes, ketones or carboxylic acids would be a nice choice. In 2017, Berlinguette's group demonstrated a novel example of combining the ECO2RR with the oxidation of organic alcohols such as 1-phenylethanol,4 and other works adopting CH3OH3,5 or glycerol6,7 as the anodic feed were successively reported.
It is worth noting that 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an important platform molecule that can be obtained by the depolymerization of cellulosic biomass and its catalytic oxidation leads to various value-added chemicals. For instance, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is a significant oxidative product of HMF and can replace terephthalic acid in various polyesters,8 which would reduce fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emission.9 Intriguingly, the standard potential of oxidizing HMF to FDCA is just 0.3 V vs. the reverse hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is far less positive than the value of the OER (1.23 V vs. RHE).10 In recent years, the electrocatalytic HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) has been investigated broadly with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),11,12 but as far as we know, there are very limited reports on coupled electrolysis with the CO2RR and HMFOR,13,14 especially those achieving a high FDCA yield (Fig. 1).

Additionally, the ECO2RR is challenging due to the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CO2, which lead to a sluggish reaction and the competitive HER.15–17 Therefore, catalysts with satisfactory efficiency are highly desired. In this context, molecular catalysts have been widely investigated due to their fascinating designability, reactivity and ease of mechanistic study.2,18 In particular, cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) has been proved to be a robust heterogeneous catalyst for selectively converting CO2 to CO.19 The highly conjugated structure of CoPc is beneficial for its non-covalent immobilization on graphitic carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via π–π interaction.20 However, there is also intense π–π stacking between the metal phthalocyanine molecules themselves, leading to their aggregation and low solubility in common solvents,21 which make achieving a highly dispersed load on the support difficult, consequently limiting the amount of valid active sites.22,23 The strategy of modifying the periphery of phthalocyanine with bulky groups is sufficient to address this issue.22,24
The electrochemical oxidation of HMF has been widely developed with heterogeneous metal oxides/hydroxides.10,25,26 However, most of these catalysts exhibit high activity for the HMFOR in a highly basic solution at pH 14, where HMF is not stable and tends to produce detrimental and insoluble humins.27 In another aspect, as homogeneous molecular catalysts, TEMPO and its derivatives are able to catalyze the oxidation of HMF to FDCA efficiently under a less basic environment (pH 9–10), although a large quantity of the catalysts are required to achieve a satisfactory reaction rate11,28 and their recycling and reusability are relatively hard to achieve compared with those of heterogeneous catalysts. Therefore, immobilizing the TEMPO catalyst onto the anode will provide a promising way to heterogeneously electrocatalyze the HMFOR in a less basic solution.
In the present work, we aimed to establish a coupled electrocatalytic system combining the ECO2RR for CO with the HMFOR for FDCA catalyzed by the non-covalently immobilized TBP-CoPc and Py-TEMPO molecular catalysts, respectively. CoPc was fabricated with a bulky 4-(tert-butyl)phenoxy (TBP) substituent to suppress its aggregation behaviour and improve its solubility in organic solvents, which are beneficial for the subsequent loading process. A pyrene group was appended onto TEMPO to link it to the CNTs through π–π interaction.29 After evaluating the catalytic activity of the immobilized TBP-CoPc and Py-TEMPO individually, we conducted both catalytic procedures in one electrolyzer with three different modes and monitored the potentials during electrolysis, revealing the importance of a suitable potential range for the target product. 96.9% FE for CO and 90.8% FE for FDCA could be achieved with a cell voltage of 2.5 V in the di-electrode mode. As expected, we successfully adapted this coupling system into a photovoltaic electrolysis cell, showing its great potential applicability.
Metal phthalocyanines are typically synthesized through the cyclisation of a phthalonitrile (PN) precursor in the presence of an organic base such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undecane-7-ene (DBU) as the catalyst and a metal salt as the template.30 As shown in Scheme 1a, we initially introduced bulky 4-(tert-butyl)phenoxy (TBP) to the PN precursor to afford 4-(4-(tert-butyl)phenoxy)phthalonitrile (TBP-PN), which was then cyclized to TBP-CoPc that was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dispersedly loaded on multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Introduction of the bulky group was found to remarkably improve the solubility of TBP-CoPc in DMF (Fig. S5†), being beneficial for the homogeneous loading procedure and avoiding the long-time utilization of high-power sonication to facilitate the dissolution process.31

In order to investigate the inherent aggregation behaviour of TBP-CoPc, the UV-vis spectra were recorded in DMF, showing the characteristic Q band at 673 nm for the electronic transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).32 The aggregation of phthalocyanine is classified into two categories, namely the H-type and J-type, which usually result in a blue-shift and red-shift of the Q band, respectively,21 and this coplanar association behaviour is dependent on the concentration of phthalocyanine. Herein, as the concentration of TBP-CoPc in DMF was increased, the peak shape and shift of the Q band remained consistent, with the absorbance obeying the Lambert–Beer law (Fig. 2), suggesting the suppression of aggregation behaviour.33 Compared with the undecorated CoPc, the Q band of TBP-CoPc exhibited a 10 nm red-shift (Fig. S6†) due to the electron-donating nature of the TBP group, which narrowed the energy gap between the LUMO and HOMO.32 This reduced gap is also evident from the DFT calculations, as depicted in Fig. S7.† When TBP-CoPc was supported on the CNTs, the obtained TBP-CoPc/CNTs displayed another 10 nm red-shift in the UV-vis spectrum (Fig. S9†), indicating the interaction between the TBP-CoPc molecule and the surface of the CNTs.22,34

Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were conducted to evaluate the ECO2RR activity of TBP-CoPc/CNTs (Fig. 3a). The obvious improvement of the current density under CO2 compared with that under Ar indicated the activity of TBP-CoPc/CNTs for the ECO2RR. Then, in the constant potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments, TBP-CoPc/CNTs displayed FECO values of 92.2%, 96.2% and 90.8% at −1.3 V, −1.5 V and −1.7 V, respectively (Fig. 3b; unless stated otherwise, the potential values here and below are all versus the saturated Ag/AgCl electrode). As the applied potential moved negatively to −1.9 V, the CO tended to be further reduced and the FE for methanol increased, while the competitive HER became more dominant, which conformed to the reported characteristics of CoPc-based catalysts in the ECO2RR.35,36

TEMPO and its derivatives have been applied extensively as catalysts for alcohol oxidation through chemical37 or electrochemical38 routes. With a pyrene group on TEMPO, the faster electron transfer between the CNT and TEMPO components is found to significantly improve the activity for the electrochemical two-electron oxidation of a series of organic alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes.29 Herein, we applied this pyrene-tethered TEMPO derivative (Py-TEMPO, Scheme 1b) in the more complicated HMFOR procedure with a six-electron transfer process. Initially, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were carried out to evaluate the HMFOR activity of the assembled Py-TEMPO/CNTs catalysts (see the details of electrode preparation in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4a, the bare carbon cloth (CC) anode in a 0.2 M Na2CO3 aqueous solution did not show perceptible activity for either the OER or HMFOR. After being decorated with the Py-TEMPO/CNTs catalyst, the anode exhibited a redox response in the absence of HMF accounting for the redox of Py-TEMPO, and the addition of 5 mM HMF induced an intense increase in current density, demonstrating the catalytic activity of the immobilized Py-TEMPO for the HMFOR. As depicted in Fig. S11,† with the increase in pH value that was adjusted using different ratios of Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 in a 0.2 M carbonate solution, the catalyst displayed a less positive onset potential for the HMFOR, and therefore the subsequent HMFOR electrolysis was carried out in 0.2 M Na2CO3 aqueous solution (pH 11.2), where no obvious humins would be formed.

The CPE tests were performed with a total passing charge of 57.9 C. 
In general, there are two plausible pathways from HMF to FDCA: the hydroxide group of HMF is first oxidized to an aldehyde to form 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) or the aldehyde group of HMF is oxidized initially to a carboxyl to form 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA), both of which (DFF and HMFCA) will subsequently be oxidized to 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) and FDCA in the end, as shown in Scheme 2.12,39–41 In previous related reports using TEMPO as a catalyst in the pH range of 9 to 10,11,28 DFF was considered as the intermediate. However, in this HMFOR catalyzed by Py-TEMPO/CNTs, neither obvious DFF nor HMFCA was detected during electrolysis and only a clear change in the concentration of FFCA was observed (Fig. 4b).
 Scheme 2  Possible pathway during the oxidation of HMF to FDCA. 
Subsequently, we compared the CV curves with different substrates (HMF and plausible intermediates), as shown in Fig. 4c. The curve with DFF showed a less positive onset potential than the one with HMF, implying that the DFF formed would be oxidized quicker than the HMF, which might illustrate the misdetection of DFF. The product distribution at various potentials was studied (Fig. 4d). At a potential as less positive as 0.5 V, the reactive rate was so slow that less than 80% conversion and just a 4.3% FE for FDCA were attained. Potentials equal to or above 0.6 V gave a satisfactory conversion rate (nearly 100%) of HMF, and a >95% FE for FDCA could be obtained in the range of 0.7 V to 0.9 V. When the anodic potential was raised to 1.0 V, the anolyte gradually turned slightly yellow, likely because of the oxidation of the CC support, and obvious OER on the CC was observed (Fig. S16†). In addition, the over-oxidation of HMF to HCOOH and maleic acid at such a positive potential was observed (Fig. S17†). These competitive oxidative procedures resulted in a 25.1% FE for FDCA at 1.0 V.
Having investigated the performances of TBP-CoPc/CNTs for the ECO2RR and Py-TEMPO/CNTs for the HMFOR individually, we then tried to couple both catalytic reactions in a single electrolyzer. All the following electrolysis experiments were performed with a total passing charge of 57.9 C, which is a stoichiometric charge for the full transformation of HMF to FDCA. In a traditional tri-electrode system, only the potential of the working electrode can be fixed at a suitable value to get an ideal FE for certain products, while the potential of the counter electrode primarily depends on the current density and substrate concentration according to the Tafel relationship as well as the Nernst equation.
We performed paired electrolysis in a tri-electrode system with the ECO2RR potential fixed at −1.5 V, aiming to produce CO with high selectivity. As shown in Fig. 5a, the anode potential for the HMFOR increased from 0.47 V to 1.04 V. As observed by the linear relationship between the percentage of stoichiometric charge and time, the current nearly remained constant during electrolysis, causing increasing overpotential as the substrate in the anodic part was gradually consumed. As a consequence, the high overpotential at the anode contributed to a moderate FEFDCA of 64.8% (Fig. 5b), corresponding to the CPE results for the HMFOR (Fig. 4d).

The above system achieved a high FECO at the price of an uncertainty of the HMFOR. Subsequently, still in the tri-electrode system, we conducted paired electrolysis with the potential of the HMFOR controlled at 0.7 V (Fig. 6), aiming at achieving a high FEFDCA. At first, a default 1 × 1 cm2 piece of carbon paper supporting the TBP-CoPc/CNTs catalyst was used as the cathode. The initial potential of the cathode reached as negative as −2.71 V (Fig. 6a) and this extreme overpotential accounts for the high FE for competitive hydrogen production. To decrease the overpotential of the ECO2RR, we attempted to increase the area of the cathode to decrease the current density, which would definitely weaken the polarization of the electrode. When the cathode area was increased to 1 × 2 cm2, the initial potential was observed to be −2.20 V (Fig. 6b), which was still a far more negative potential for the ECO2RR catalyzed by TBP-CoPc/CNTs and contributed to a 68.7% FE for the undesired HER. Further increasing in the area to 2 × 2 cm2 made the potential of the cathode reach an acceptable range (≥1.7 V, Fig. 6c), contributing to an 83.9% FE for CO. Of course, the product distribution at the anode was independent of the area of the cathode and an FE of over 95% for FDCA was retained (Fig. 6d), ascribed to the fixed 0.7 V potential at the anode.

Apart from the tri-electrode system, the electrolytic cell could also be controlled solely by the cell voltage in a di-electrode configuration, which is a more practical mode for industrial electrolysis. However, neither the potential of the cathode nor the anode could be fixed at a certain value in this situation. With the increase in cell voltage, the stoichiometric charge passed during a shorter time and the overpotentials for both the cathode and anode were increased due to the larger current density (Fig. 7). Luckily, the cathode potentials under three such cell voltages were kept in the range of −1.3 V to −1.5 V, achieving an over 95% FE for CO. With a 2.5 V cell voltage, the anode potential increased from 0.45 V to 0.87 V during electrolysis, exhibiting a 90.8% FE for FDCA, while in the conditions with a 3.0 V and 3.5 V cell voltage, the anode potential reached 0.96 V and 1.01 V, respectively, resulting in 86.9% and 69.5% FEs for FDCA, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the potential difference at the cathode and the anode is always smaller than the cell voltage due to the voltage loss from the resistance of the solution and the N117 membrane.

It is ideal to realize chemical reactions with renewable energy sources such as sunlight. In the reported direct photocatalytic oxidation of HMF to FDCA, an alkaline environment was typically required,42 while CO2 molecules tended to form carbonates in such conditions. Therefore, efficient coupled reactions containing the reduction of CO2 and oxidation of HMF to FDCA might be challenging in the direct photocatalytic method. However, photovoltaic power-driven electrolysis could make the oxidative and reductive reactions occur at the two electrodes individually and their solutions could be separated through a membrane. Herein, a sunlight-driven coupling electrolytic device was built on the basis of the results of the di-electrode mode, as depicted in Fig. 8a. The cell voltage input from the solar panel fluctuated between 3.08 V and 3.30 V with time owing to the complex and variable parameters such as the light intensity and the direction of the sun towards the solar panel (Fig. 8b). The cathode potential ranged from −1.4 V to −1.5 V, achieving a 95.4% selectivity and turnover number of 52172 for CO (based on the cobalt atom, calculated using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry). As for the oxidation part of the cell, a 69.9% yield of FDCA was achieved. Thus, this is the first example and a promising way to realize the coupling of the CO2RR with the HMFOR purely driven by clean solar energy.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a coupled electrolytic system where protons and electrons from the oxidation of HMF can be used to reduce CO2 to CO based on the two non-covalently immobilized molecular catalysts TBP-CoPc and Py-TEMPO. Over 90% FE for FDCA and CO was achieved through rational regulation of the system. As a result, the potentials at the two electrodes could be influenced by parameters such as the electrode area and electrolysis method, which made a difference in the final product distribution. This coupling system could also be driven by photovoltaic power, exhibiting great applicable prospects in the future. This work would offer guidelines for the design of practical electrocatalytic systems with complete reductive–oxidative procedures. There are still some other key parameters that influence the efficiency of electrolytic paired redox reactions such as the membrane and solution resistance, which are under further investigation in our lab.
