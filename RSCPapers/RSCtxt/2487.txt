    , Accepted 8th May 2022First published on 10th May 2022AbstractThe electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), as an alternative green technology to the Haber–Bosch process, can efficiently synthesize ammonia under ambient conditions and has a reduced carbon footprint. Here we systematically investigate the NRR activity and selectivity of transition metal (TM) single-atom catalyst (SAC) anchored WS2 monolayers (TM@WS2) by means of first-principles calculations and microkinetic modeling. The construction of the reaction activity trend and the identification of an activity descriptor, namely *N2H adsorption energy, facilitate the efficient screening and rational design of SACs with high activity. Manipulating the adsorption strength of the pivotal *N2H intermediate is a potential strategy for enhancing NRR activity. Utilizing the limiting potential difference of NRR and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a selectivity descriptor, we screen three SACs with excellent activity and selectivity toward NRR, i.e., Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 with favorable limiting potentials of –0.44 V, –0.38 V and –0.69 V. By using the explicit H9O4+ model, the kinetic barriers of the rate-determining steps (0.47 eV–1.15 eV) of the solvated proton transfer on the screened SACs are found to be moderate, indicative of a kinetically feasible process. Microkinetic modeling shows that the turnover frequencies of N2 reduction to NH3 on Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 are 1.52 × 105, 8.21 × 102 and 4.17 × 10−4 per s per site at 400 K, achieving fast reaction rates. The coexistence of empty and occupied 5d orbitals of candidate SACs is beneficial for σ donation and π* backdonation, endowing them with extraordinary N2 adsorption and activation. Moreover, the screened SACs possess good dispersity and thermodynamic stability. Our work provides a promising solution for the efficient screening and rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts toward the NRR.
1. Introduction
Ammonia (NH3), the second most produced chemical in the world today (ca. 170 million metric tons per year),1,2 is mainly used in nitrogen fertilizer, carbon-free energy carriers and fuels.3 Although nitrogen is widely distributed in nature, the direct utilization of the N2 in the atmosphere is rather difficult owing to the inherent inertia and strong bond energy (940.95 kJ mol−1) of the triple bond.4 Utilizing N2 and H2 as raw materials to synthesize NH3 on an industrial scale at high temperatures (400–600 °C) and pressures (20–40 MPa) via the century-old Haber–Bosch process provides more than 90% of the NH3 in the world, which alleviates the problems of human hunger and dramatically changes the landscape of our planet.5,6 However, the admirable Haber–Bosch process consumes more than 1% of global energy production and emits more than 300 million metric tons of the greenhouse gas CO2 annually.7–9 Therefore, the development of alternative green technologies to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint is urgent. Recently, the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions, inspired by biological nitrogen fixation by rhizobia, has attracted a lot of attention.10 The electrocatalytic synthesis of NH3 uses an aqueous solution as a proton (H+) source instead of expensive hydrogen and is powered by renewable solar and wind energy, and can be effectively regulated by operating potentials, electrodes and the pH of the solution.11 However, in cathodic reactions, the competition between the reduction of protons and N2 as well as the sluggish kinetics of NRR are extremely challenging. The search for electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity has become particularly important.
Transition metal (TM)-based catalysts, including pure TM surfaces (Mo, Fe, Rh, Ru, etc.) and TM nanoclusters, show high activity towards NRR but the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more competitive,12,13 which may limit their practical application. It is highly desirable to reduce the size of nanoclusters or particles to a single atom to acquire low-coordination and unsaturated active metal sites, which brings about new catalytic behavior, such as the effective inhibition of detrimental side reactions that typically occur at multi-metallic sites.14,15 Single-atom catalysts (SACs) constructed by anchoring atomically dispersed isolated metal atoms on high-surface-area solid supports have attracted extensive attention for their ability to maximize atomic availability and novel structures and properties.16,17 Several studies have sought to fabricate defects or dopants on the surface of a graphene monolayer as anchoring sites for single metal atoms, in which the investigations of NRR on a TM-supported N-coordinated graphene monolayer in the form of TM–N–C are vigorous and thriving.18–22 Although TM–N–C SACs exhibit good stability and synthetic feasibility, their precise synthesis is still a challenge owing to mixed structures and different coordination environments, and uncertainty about active centers has been presented.23,24 Natural porous carbon-based materials (graphdiyne, C2N, or C3N4) with nanopores of different sizes have advantages over surface chemically modified graphene and the appropriate natural nanopores provide stable anchoring sites for isolated metal atoms.25–29 For nitrogen-containing support materials, it is worth noting that the possible decomposition of the catalyst can affect the evaluation of catalytic performance.30
Apart from two-dimensional carbon-based materials, novel-structured transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets have received considerable attention due to their unique properties and great potential in electronics,31–33 optoelectronics,34,35 catalysis,36–40 energy storage and conversion.41,42 Utilizing TMD nanosheets as substrates to support metal nanoparticles or single metal atoms may promote their intrinsic conductivity and electrocatalytic performance, profiting from a synergetic effect.43 The most famous TMDs are Mo, W-based dichalcogenides.44 MoS2 nanosheet supported gold nanoparticles exhibit excellent NRR activity and tremendous stability under all pH conditions benefiting from a stable crystal structure and good dispersibility.43 N2 binding and reduction on single Fe atom deposited MoS2 nanosheets is feasible under mild conditions and the strong Fe–S bonds guarantee the dispersion of Fe, but the activation barrier of 1.02 eV is still high.45 To our knowledge, a WS2 monolayer has emerged as a promising and cost-effective electrocatalyst for the HER46–51 but its application in the NRR has rarely been reported. The properties of an inert WS2 basal plane with a high surface-to-volume ratio could be modulated through heteroatom doping, where the doped atoms are introduced into the crystal lattice of the host WS2via substitution of original lattice atoms or by plugging into the interstitial sites of the lattice.47 Shi prepared a Pt SAC supported on a WS2 monolayer by a site-specific electro-deposition technique and fine modulation of the oxidation state of the Pt SAC through electronic metal–support interaction activated the alkaline and acidic HER.52 However, for SACs supported on a WS2 monolayer, the general NRR activity trend and descriptor have yet to be developed. Based on the linear scaling relations between the adsorption energies of different species, the overall reaction activity of the complicated reaction with multiple elementary steps can be plotted in activity trend maps by a couple of descriptors or in volcano curves by a single descriptor, which significantly facilitates the vast amount of catalyst screening.53,54 The development of a general NRR activity descriptor on the basis of the establishment of the activity trend can provide us with rational design principles for SACs supported on a WS2 monolayer. Previous studies have shown that various types of electrocatalyst can be screened based on thermodynamic data, such as TM surfaces,12 TM nanoclusters,13 TM SACs,55,56 TM dual-atom57–59 and 2D materials.60,61 The electrocatalytic activity of the experimentally prepared electrocatalysts can be well explained by the calculated limiting potential.62–65 However, kinetic barriers of the proton transfer involved in electrochemical reactions are generally ignored.66
In this work, based on thermodynamic calculations, we found that the *N2H adsorption energy was an independent variable to describe the limiting potential of NRR. Promising candidates, Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2, were screened by combining the activity descriptor and selectivity descriptor. Subsequently, we used the explicit Eigen H9O4+ model67 to simulate solvated proton transfer on the three candidates under acidic conditions and the moderate kinetic barriers of the rate-determining step (RDS) indicated a feasible protonation process. Considering that the local concentrations, temperatures and electrode potentials could affect the reaction rate, we conducted detailed microkinetic modeling. The electronic structure unveiled the origin of NRR activity. We proposed a feasible means to enhance NRR activity by regulating the adsorption energy of the key *N2H intermediate. We calculated the diffusion barriers of TM atoms and performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the stability of candidate SACs. For TM SACs supported by a WS2 monolayer, we provided comprehensive insights into NRR mechanisms, thermodynamics, kinetics, activity trend and descriptor, which may guide the experimental preparation of SACs with high NRR performance in a large family of layered nanostructures.
2. Computational methods
Spin-polarized first-principles calculations under the framework of density functional theory (DFT) were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).68 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the frame of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was employed to describe the exchange–correlation functional.69,70 The pseudopotential under the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method was applied to treat electron–ion interactions.71 The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 450 eV. Given the van der Waals interactions between the substrate and the adsorbate, the dispersion correction of DFT-D3 in Grimme's scheme was applied.72 The energy and force convergence were set to 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1 during structure relaxation. A 4 × 4 × 1 WS2 supercell was selected as the support and a vacuum space of 15 Å was chosen to avoid false periodic image interactions. 3 × 3 × 1 and 9 × 9 × 1 k-point grids were used for geometrical optimization and electronic structure calculations, respectively. The climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was used to search the minimum energy pathways.73 Mean-field microkinetic modeling was conducted by solving the kinetic equations that describe the coverage of surface species.74 Except for the RDS, all elementary steps were treated in equilibrium. The coverage of surface species could be solved analytically under the quasi-equilibrium approximation.75 The overall turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated as the reaction rate of the RDS. The computational details of the microkinetic modeling are shown in the ESI.†
To evaluate the adsorption strength between adsorbates and substrates, the adsorption energy (ΔE) is defined as follows:ΔE = E(adsorbates/substrates) – E(substrates) – E(adsorbates)where E(adsorbates/substrates), E(substrates) and E(adsorbates) are the energies of the substrates adsorbed with adsorbates, substrates, and adsorbates, respectively.
The Gibbs free energy is calculated on the basis of the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE).76 The formula for the change in free energy (ΔG) for each reaction step is as follows:ΔG = ΔEDFT + ΔEZPE – TΔS + eU + ΔGpHwhere ΔEDFT is the adsorption energy based on DFT calculations. The contribution of zero-point energy, as well as the vibrational contribution to the entropy are considered in the free energy. ΔEZPE and ΔS are the differences in zero-point energy and entropy between the adsorbed state and the free state,20 and T is the room temperature of 298.15 K. The definition of ZPE is as follows:  where i is the frequency number, and vi is the frequency (cm−1).
The vibrational entropy (Sv) of the intermediates is considered, as shown in the formula:77  where kB = 1.38 × 10−23 J K−1, h = 6.63 × 10−34 J s, and R = 8.314 J mol−1 K−1.
The applied electrode potential is denoted by U and e is the transferred electron. The correction for electrolyte pH can be given by the following formula:ΔGpH = kBT × pH × ln10where acidic conditions (pH = 0) were considered in this work. The electrochemical step where the free energy increases the most (ΔGmax) is the potential-determining step (PDS) in the electrochemical reaction. The limiting potential (UL) is defined as follows:UL = –ΔGmax/e
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Anchoring TM on a WS2 monolayer

Fig. 1(a) shows the 2H-phase WS2 monolayer with honeycomb hexagonal symmetry, which is arranged in SWS atomic stacking order in the z direction.78 The optimized lattice constant of the WS2 monolayer unit cell is 3.17 Å, consistent with the experimental value of 3.15 Å79 and the theoretical value of 3.17 Å.80 The electronic structures of the pristine WS2 monolayer are exhibited in Fig. 1(b), where the calculated direct band gap of 1.92 eV is in good agreement with the result from another theoretical study81 of 1.95 eV and close to the experimental value82 of 1.97 eV. The accuracy of the calculation of the geometric and electronic structures ensures the rationality of our parameter settings. The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are mainly composed of W-5d and S-3p states with strong hybridization. The W-top, Hollow and S-top sites are selected as anchoring sites for TM based on the symmetry of the WS2 monolayer and the adsorption system is abbreviated as TM@WS2.

TMs are anchored at the top site of the W atom (W-top), the hollow site of three S atoms (Hollow), and the top site of the S atom (S-top) and these sites are marked with red, green and blue circles, respectively. The band structure and partial density of states (PDOS) of (b) the pristine WS2 monolayer. Total DOS (TDOS) and PDOS of (c) Re@WS2, (d) Os@WS2 and (e) Ir@WS2. The S and W atoms closest to TM (Re, Os, Ir) are selected to analyze the hybridization of the orbitals. The Fermi level (EF) is set to zero. 
We use the hybrid functional (HSE06)83 to calculate the band structure of the pristine WS2 monolayer because the PBE exchange–correlation functional generally underestimates the band gap, and the calculated band gap of the pristine WS2 monolayer is 2.38 eV based on the HSE06 method (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is close to the previously reported band gap of 2.45 eV.81 The calculated band gap of 1.92 eV obtained using the PBE functional agrees well with the experimental value,82 due to the quenched coulombic screening, and the large exciton binding energies of TMD materials roughly compensate for the underestimation of the band gaps at the PBE level.81,84,85 We test the energies of different intermediates using the HSE06 and PBE functionals (Fig. S2, ESI†), and the results show that the relative trends of energies of different intermediates are consistent with each other, regardless of which exchange–correlation functional is used. Therefore, reasonable results for material screening can be obtained based on the PBE functional in this work.
The effect of the solvent model is tested by using the Poisson–Boltzmann implicit solvation model,86 in which the dielectric constant is set to 78.54 for water.87 Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the calculated free energies of intermediates with and without the solvent effect. When the solvent effect is included, the change in free energies is not significant and the limiting potential increases only 0.11 eV, which is consistent with other theoretical studies.57,88 Other studies suggest that this effect may be much smaller than the energy differences between different materials.57,88–91 This situation is consistent with most published theoretical studies, and many experimental results are well reproduced by using the PBE functional without considering the solvation effect.38,57,92–97 Therefore, the solvent correction is not included in the initial screening of SACs. However, the explicit solvation model is considered in the kinetic study of the solvated proton transfer.
To search for the most stable TM adsorption structure, adsorption energy scanning is performed on the WS2 monolayer to compare the stability of various TMs at different anchoring sites. As shown in Fig. S4, (ESI†) the calculated adsorption energies of the TMs are all negative, suggesting an exothermic adsorption process. The adsorption energies of the overwhelming majority of TMs at the W-top sites are more negative than at other sites, except for Ag, Au, Hf, and W. In view of their structural stability, Ag, Au, Hf, and W@WS2 will not be further considered due to the more positive adsorption energies (> −1 eV) of Ag and Au and the deformation of the host material as regards the incorporated Hf or W (see Fig. S5, ESI†). The closed-shell Zn, Cd and Hg adatoms are excluded from consideration on account of the properties of physical adsorption. The satisfactory TM adatoms (3d: from Sc to Cu; 4d: from Y to Pd; 5d: Lu, Ta, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) are anchored to the W-top site in a triple (three S ligands) coordination mode. As shown in Fig. S6, (ESI†) Bader charge analysis indicates the cationic properties of TM adatoms and the negative correlation of number of electrons of TM and S ligands. The transferred charge near the interface suggests a strong TM–S interaction and ensures the stability of the systems.
The electronic properties of the most promising candidate SACs, i.e., Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2, are studied through the electronic DOS and band structure, as presented in Fig. 1(c–e) and Fig. S7 (ESI†). The anchoring of Re, Os and Ir on WS2 induce spin polarization in the otherwise non-magnetic host material and the mid-gap states primarily come from the 5d states of the doped TM (Re, Os, and Ir). It can be seen that the TM-5d (Re, Os, and Ir) orbitals dramatically hybridize with W-5d and S-3p orbitals near EF, indicative of a strong metal–support interaction. The distribution of spin-charge clouds is concentrated in the vicinity of Re (Os and Ir) (Fig. S8, ESI†), indicating that these TMs contribute the main part of the spin moment, i.e., Re@WS2 (3 μB), Os@WS2 (2 μB) and Ir@WS2 (1 μB). The introduced spin-polarized metal center with a local spin moment of these candidates facilitates the N2 adsorption and N–N triple-bond activation.18,19 In addition, the substantially reduced bandgaps of the pristine WS2 monolayer with an intrinsic semiconductor phase after the introduction of Re (Os and Ir) promote efficient electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process.20,98
3.2 Reaction mechanisms and limiting potential
N2 is adsorbed onto the catalytically active center in the common forms of end-on and side-on configurations and is then continuously protonated to be converted to NH3 through distal, alternative, consecutive and enzymatic mechanisms,20 as exhibited in Fig. 2(a). For the distal mechanism, the proton/electron pair (H+ + e−) continuously attacks the distal N atom of the adsorbed N2 until the NN bond breaks to form the first NH3. Subsequently the proximal N is hydrogenated in succession. The generation and desorption of the second NH3 announces the termination of an electrocatalytic NRR cycle. Moreover, the distally coordinated N2 may be attacked alternately by a proton/electron pair up to the breakage of the N–N bond. In the case of the side-on mode, the consecutive mechanism means that one N atom of the adsorbed N2 is continuously hydrogenated to produce the first NH3 and the remaining N adatom is further hydrogenated in three-proton/electron steps to form the second NH3. Two N atoms can be alternatively attacked by H+ + e− through a biomimetic enzymatic mechanism to achieve cleavage of the NN bond.

An essential parameter to evaluate the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts is the limiting potential (UL), which makes the electrochemical reaction step thermodynamically descending. In the six-electron/proton transfer process, the elementary step with the largest uphill in free energy, i.e., PDS, determines the magnitude of UL. Generally, reduction of a stable intermediate to an unstable intermediate is thermodynamically unfavorable, i.e., the hydrogenation of *N2 to *N2H and *NH2 to *NH3, which are usually the PDS of NRR.4,87,99–101 It has been reported that the screening efficiency of SACs could be vastly improved by using the ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) (free energy change of the first hydrogenation of *N2) and ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3) (free energy change of the last hydrogenation of *NH2) activity descriptors on the premise of their screening accuracy.56 In the preliminary stage of NRR, the stable NN bond is slightly weakened when *N2 is protonated to form unstable *N2H with an ascending free energy, and cleaving the inert bond still requires a higher energy intake. The unfilled orbital of NH2 could be coupled strongly with the d orbital of TM, resulting in stable *NH2, while the polar NH3 with a filled sp3-hybridized orbital has a weak interaction with TM to form unstable *NH3, and thus ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3) is extremely high as well.56,99 Based on the above analysis, the UL and PDS of NRR can be determined accurately by calculating ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) and ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3).
The intrinsic activity of TM@WS2 toward the NRR can be characterized by UL, determined by the relative positions of the energy levels of different intermediates. Fig. 2(b) records the calculated UL of TM@WS2. With the increase in valence electrons, the UL of TM@WS2 in each period shows a trend of waveform change. The most promising electrocatalytic NRR candidates possess a less negative UL: for example, Cr (–0.70 V) of 3d TM, Tc (–0.46 V) of 4d TM, Os (–0.38 V) of 5d TM, whose electron configurations are half-full (3d54s1 for Cr) or nearly half-full (4d55s2 for Tc and 5d66s2 for Os). More negative UL are located at Ni (–1.84 V), Cu (–1.21 V), Rh (–1.02 V), Pd (–1.87 V), Ta (–1.18 V) and Pt (–1.72 V), and their NRR activity is poor compared to the benchmark Ru(0001) surface (–0.98 V).12 The UL calculations of various TM@WS2 provide us with preliminary information on NRR activity and it is worth noting that UL is associated with hydrogenation of *N2 and *NH2, which is related to the adsorption strength and activation of N2 by TM@WS2. In addition, the NRR performance of the in-plane pristine WS2 is studied since the exposed S atoms are possible active sites. Our results show that the adsorption height of N2 on the WS2 monolayer is 3.14 Å and the NN bond length is 1.12 Å, indicating that N2 cannot be activated by the pristine WS2 monolayer (Fig. S9, ESI†). The free energy change of the first hydrogenation step (*NN → *NNH) on the pristine WS2 monolayer is 2.11 eV, which is extremely high for NRR. Thus, the pristine WS2 monolayer is not suitable as an electrocatalyst for NRR.
3.3 Activity trend, descriptor and selectivity
To achieve the effective screening and rational design of an NRR electrocatalyst, the activity trend map and the combination of activity descriptor and selectivity descriptor are of paramount significance. To do this, the study of energetics of the adsorbed species is the basis. A series of calculations of the adsorption energies of *N, *N2H, *NH, and *NH2 on TM@WS2 are performed and the correlations between adsorption energies of different species are established, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The adsorption energy of the intermediate *N2H, denoted ΔE(*N2H), shows good correlation with that of other reaction intermediates (*N, *NH, and *NH2). For instance, greater *N adsorption strength involves more stable *N2H, i.e., the ΔE(*N2H) of Re (–3.95 eV), Os (−3.64 eV), Mo (−3.25 eV), and Tc (−3.23 eV) are more negative, and the values of ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) on those TMs are lower.
The first hydrogenation of *N2 (*N2 → *N2H) and the last hydrogenation of *NH2 (*NH2 → *NH3) are related to the adsorption strength of *N2H and *NH2. The relationships between the ΔG of the underlying PDS and ΔE(*N2H) (ΔE(*NH2)) are presented in Fig. 3(a–b). The linear scaling relation between ΔE(*N2H) and ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) is a positive correlation while the linear scaling relation between ΔE(*NH2) and ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3) shows the inverse trend with a negative slope. For early TMs (Sc, Zr, and Ta), the more negative ΔE(*N2H) (−3.16 eV for Sc, −3.68 eV for Zr and −4.17 eV for Ta) will reduce the energy level of the *N2H intermediate and thus ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) will decrease (0.26 eV for Sc, 0.09 eV for Zr and 0.08 for Ta), but concurrently the *NH2 adsorption configurations are more stable (−4.26 eV for Sc, −4.55 eV for Zr and −4.89 eV for Ta), increasing the energy level gap between *NH2 and *NH3 (0.79 eV for Sc, 0.81 eV for Zr and 1.18 eV for Ta), and the last hydrogenation step with a more negative UL is the PDS.

(c) Color-filled contour plot of the UL of the NRR as a function of ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) and ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3). (d) Volcano plot of the UL of the NRR as a function of ΔE(*N2H). The horizontal dotted blue line represents the UL of NRR on the Ru(0001) surface. The blue region represents the NRR activity region compared to Ru(0001). (e) Color-filled contour plot of UL(NRR) – UL(HER) as a function of UL(NRR) and UL(HER), where UL(NRR), UL(HER) and UL(NRR) – UL(HER) represent the UL of the NRR, the UL of HER on TM@WS2, and the difference between UL(NRR) and UL(HER). Highly active and selective SACs are indicated by a dashed red circle. (f) A volcano plot of the UL of the HER as a function of ΔG(*H). The horizontal dotted blue line represents the UL of the HER on the Pt(111) surface. The pink region represents the HER activity region compared to Pt(111). 
The opposite is true for the later TMs, where the first hydrogenation (*N2 to *N2H) is the PDS. For example, for Ni, Cu, Pd and Pt that are located in the region of weak binding strength of N-containing species, ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) is quite high for Ni (1.84 eV), Cu (1.21 eV), Pd (1.87 eV) and Pt (1.72 eV), while the last hydrogenation is exothermal with a downhill free energy (−1.46 to −0.3 eV). For the case of TMs (Cr, Tc, and Os) with less negative UL in different periods, the adsorption strength of N-containing species is moderate compared to the other elements in their periods. Specifically, for the first hydrogenation of *N2, the intermediate *N2H is substantially stable for Cr, Tc and Os with ΔE(*N2H) of −2.53 eV, −3.23 eV and −3.64 eV and ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) is low (0.70 eV, 0.46 eV and 0.38 eV). For the reduction of *NH2, the weak adsorption strength of Cr (−3.51 eV), Tc (−3.78 eV), and Os (−4.09 eV) makes ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3) close to 0.
Strong chemisorption of N2 is indispensable for realization of N2 activation, resulting in stable N-containing surface species, which makes it difficult for associative desorption of *NH2 to form NH3 even though ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) can be effectively reduced. Two contradictory criteria need to be balanced simultaneously for the most promising NRR electrocatalyst based upon the analysis of linear scaling relations. Optimal candidates should compromise between stabilizing *N2H and destabilizing *NH2, providing a strategy for the design of NRR electrocatalysts with high activity. Similarly, the selective stabilization of *N2H species and destabilization of *NH2 species are responsible for the high activity of an Mo-embedded defective BN monolayer87 and an Mo-doped g-GaN monolayer.102
To exhibit the inherent activity of TM@WS2 more intuitively, the color-filled contour plot of UL as a function of the free energy change of the underlying PDS is built in Fig. 3(c), where the x and y axes represent ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) and ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3), respectively. The distribution of activity trend is displayed via different color regions, and the red regions are ideal in terms of NRR activity. There is a clearly visible linear scaling relationship between ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) and ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3). Tc, Re, and Os are between the line depicted by the linear function and the region of ideal activity, whose UL (–0.46 V for Tc, –0.44 V for Re, and –0.38 V for Os) are less than half of the UL of the well-established Ru(0001) surface.12 The early and later TM SACs (Sc, Ta, Ni, Cu, Pd and Pt) are located in the region of weak activity. The constraints of the linear scaling relationship restrict most of the SACs from approaching the narrow active region. The predicted Os@WS2 with the highest activity still has much room for improvement. Breaking through the constraint of the linear scaling relation between ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) and ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3) by adjusting these two parameters independently is a feasible strategy for achieving proximity to the ideal region in the activity trend map.
Analysis of adsorption energy data of intermediates and the activity trend enables us to search for a descriptor to evaluate the NRR activity. In conjunction with the previous discussion, considering that ΔE(*N2H) has good correlation with other parameters, the volcanic structure between UL and ΔE(*N2H) is well established, and the activity trend originally associated with multiple parameters manifests a dependence on one parameter, as shown in Fig. 3(d). In addition, we also evaluate the correlation between the adsorption energies of other intermediates (*N, *NH, *NH2, and *N2) and the UL, and the result shows a weaker linear correlation than that of *N2H (Fig. S11, ESI†). The correlation between the unoccupied d states100 and d-band center58,103–105 of the TM SACs and the NRR activity is tested to evaluate whether these two single-parameters can be used as electronic descriptors. Unfortunately, there is no linear correlation between these two single-parameters and UL (Fig. S12, ESI†). The d bands of the TM SACs split into discrete states in the presence of the WS2 substrate's crystal field, which are different from the continuous d states of the TM surfaces (Fig. S13, ESI†), and thus the d-band center descriptor with average quantitative characteristics is inapplicable here. The failure of the d-band center to reproduce the activity trend of TM SACs has also been reported previously for carbon-based supports.94,106
As depicted in Fig. 3(d), the vast majority of SACs show high NRR activity compared with the Ru(0001) surface, such as Os (–0.38 V), Re (–0.44 V), Tc (–0.46 V), Mo (–0.54 V), Nb (–0.61 V), and Ir (–0.69 V), which are located near the apex of the active volcano map. Too strong (−4.17 eV of Ta) or too weak (−1.65 eV of Ni, −1.59 eV of Cu, −1.16 eV of Pd and −1.80 eV of Pt) *N2H adsorption strength both exhibit a more negative UL (–1.21 to –1.87 V), suggesting that the activity of these catalysts could be optimized by modulating ΔE(*N2H). The *N2H adsorption energy can also be used as an NRR activity descriptor for SACs sandwiched between BN and graphene sheets.107 Interestingly enough, the *N2H adsorption energy as an NRR activity descriptor is applicable to bimetallic catalysts as well, such as bimetal-coordinated phthalocyanine57 and an N-doped graphene supported atom-pair,58 indicating the validity and universality of the descriptor. The *N2H adsorption energy descriptor can be utilized to screen NRR electrocatalysts with high activity efficiently.
One of the great challenges in electrocatalytic NRR is the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that can lower the faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 production.108 The selectivity toward NRR is determined by the competition between NH3 formation and undesirable H2 production, which is measured by the difference between the UL of NRR and HER, i.e., UL(NRR) – UL(HER), termed the selectivity descriptor. More positive values of UL(NRR) – UL(HER) indicate higher selectivity toward NRR. Fig. 3(e) shows that Re, Os and Ir SACs have high NRR activity and selectivity, which is in accordance with the calculated high FE of the NRR, that is, 100% for Re, 99.86% for Os, and 96.96% for Ir (Note S1 and Table S4, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3(f), the adsorption Gibbs free energy of *H, written ΔG(*H), can be selected as a simple descriptor for HER activity. The calculated UL(HER) of V (–0.06 V), Fe (–0.06 V) and Pt (–0.07 V) SACs are extremely close to that of the Pt(111)109,110 benchmark, suggesting that they are potential HER electrocatalysts. Recently, Shi et al. reported a Pt SAC on a 2D WS2 nanosheet synthesized through a site-specific electrodeposition method, for which the acidic HER (mass activity) was up to 43-fold higher than that of commercial Pt/C.52 Our calculated prediction of the high HER activity of Pt@WS2 with a less negative UL of –0.07 V under acidic conditions is consistent with this experiment. The values of ΔG of *H desorption on Cr (0.16 eV), Tc (0.20 eV) and Mo (0.28 eV) SACs are lower than those of the PDS of NRR, indicating a more advantageous HER process. The adsorption Gibbs free energy of *N2 is shown in Fig. S14, (ESI†) where the more negative ΔG(*N2) of Re (−1.42 eV), Os (−1.24 eV), and Ir (−1.16 eV) indicate preferential NRR compared to HER, since the ΔG(*H) of −0.79 eV for Re, −0.55 eV for Os and −0.78 eV for Ir guarantee the elimination of the HER.
To clarify the NRR mechanisms on Re@WS2, Os@WS2, and Ir@WS2, free energy diagrams of all intermediates on the screened SACs through the optimal pathway (distal) are drawn in Fig. 4. The geometric structures of reaction species on Os@WS2 are shown as well to reveal the adsorption and hydrogenation of N2, and the release of NH3. The similarity is that N2 adsorption and cleavage of the NN bond are exothermic, while PDS and NH3 desorption are endothermic. The desorption energies of NH3 on Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 are 1.04 eV, 0.91 eV and 0.75 eV, respectively, which are lower than that of Re@MoS2 (1.18 eV).99 The protonation of *NH3 to NH4+ may facilitate the desorption of the final product under acidic conditions.111 Experimental and theoretical studies showed that even though the calculated desorption energies of *NH3 on the catalysts exceed 1 eV, the prepared catalysts achieved high ammonia yield under acidic conditions.112–114 The produced NH3 can be easily removed when the electrochemical reactions are performed in flow cells. Therefore, the release of *NH3 may be rapid on these screened SACs, which is important for the catalytic cycle of the catalysts, the continuous exposure of the active sites and the achievement of high durability.99,115 NRR prefers to proceed via a distal mechanism with the minimum ΔG (0.44 eV for Re, 0.38 eV for Os, and 0.69 eV for Ir) of the PDS, which requires the lowest applied potential (–0.44 V for Re, –0.38 V for Os, and –0.69 V for Ir) to drive the reaction in comparison to the alternative mechanism (Fig. S15, ESI†). The UL of Os@WS2 is less negative than that of N-doped graphene supported Mo SAC (–0.40 V)20 and boron sheet supported Ru SAC (–0.42 V).116 The NRR activity of Re@WS2 is higher than that of V@graphdiyne (–0.67 V).25 The calculated UL of Ir@WS2 is slightly negative but still fascinating compared with those of nanoporous carbon material supported Ru SACs (–0.98 V to –0.94 V).29

3.4 Reaction kinetics
To further investigate the NRR performance of Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 that are screened based on reaction thermodynamics, reaction kinetics are considered. To search for the reasonable transition state of the proton transfer, we use the Eigen H9O4+ model67 to simulate the solvated proton transfer under acidic conditions, where the solvated proton is near the reaction intermediates. The detailed reaction mechanisms, involving adsorption/desorption and proton transfer processes, are shown in Fig. 5. The atomic-scale mechanism of proton transfer on Os@WS2 is unambiguously shown. The atomic structures of initial state, transition state, final state, intermediate on Re@WS2 and Ir@WS2 are presented in Fig. S16 and S17 (ESI†). The adsorbed species grabs a proton from an adjacent water molecule and the central hydronium donates a proton to the remaining hydroxide to combine into a new water molecule. The RDS on Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 is protonation of *N2 into *NNH species and the corresponding free energy barriers are 0.47 eV, 0.65 eV, and 1.15 eV. Although the proton transfer involves many activated steps, the free energy barriers of other electrochemical reactions except for the RDS are extremely low or they are spontaneous processes, which guarantees that the solvated proton transfer is kinetically feasible.

The atomic structures of initial states, intermediates, transition states (TSs) and final states on Os@WS2 are shown. The TSs are searched using the CI-NEB method. The geometric structures of the initial states, final states, and intermediates are fully relaxed.

H: White; O: Red; N: Blue; Os: Green. The cyan balls represent the hydrogen atoms participating in the proton transfer. 
By using microkinetic modeling, the steady-state TOF of N2 reduction to NH3 can be calculated. We refer to previous work117–123 to calculate the temperature-dependent pre-exponentials and rate constant and to set partial pressures of the reactant and product. The phase diagrams of TOF, temperature and pressure are shown in Fig. 6(a–c). With an increase in temperature and pressure, the TOF increases rapidly, which is attributable to a decrease in reaction and activation energies at high temperature and pressure.118,119 The relationship between the TOF and a single variable temperature or pressure is shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†). The TOF increases slowly with pressure from 40 to 100 bar due to the limited active sites.121 At 400 K, the TOF values of NRR on Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 reach 1.52 × 105, 8.21 × 102 and 4.17 × 10−4 per s per site. The TOF of Re@WS2 is comparable to that of the reported ammonia synthesis electrocatalyst 2P@C2N119 (8.9 × 105 per s per site at 400 K).

(d) Simulated polarization curves of the NRR on Re@WS2, Os@WS2, and Ir@WS2 at 298.15 K. 
The kinetic rate of the electrochemical reaction can be regulated by the electrode potential (U), and the simulated polarization curves of NRR on Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 are shown in Fig. 6(d). The theoretical onset potentials of Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 are approximately 0.22 V, –0.27 V and –1.80 V. The current density radically drops to –3.38 mA cm−2 by adjusting the electrode potential. Fig. S19 (ESI†) shows the coverages of intermediates as a function of U at 298.15 K. At different spans of potential, *N2 is the only abundant surface species on the three catalysts. *N2 is quickly removed when U is less than 0.22 V (Re@WS2) or –0.27 V (Os@WS2). *N2 on Ir@WS2 is gradually depleted when U falls below –1.80 V due to the relatively high kinetic barrier for *N2 protonation. Furthermore, increasing the reaction temperature and partial pressure of N2 in the catalyst–electrolyte interface increases the reaction rate, which can positively shift the reaction potential.
3.5 Activity origin of the screened SACs
The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) and DOS are utilized to analyze the interaction between TM and N2, as shown in Fig. 7(a–c). The bonding orbital populations dominate below the EF, suggestive of a strong interaction between Re/Os/Ir and N2. In order to quantitatively measure the relationship between the bonding/antibonding orbital populations and N2 adsorption strength, we calculated the integrated COHP (ICOHP) of different N2 adsorption systems (Co, Cu, Rh, Pd, Re, Os, and Ir) below the EF, as presented in Fig. 7(g) (the details are shown in Fig. S20, ESI†). Based on the good linear scaling relationship between ICOHP and ΔE(*N2), one can find that the degree of filling in the populations of bonding/antibonding orbitals in different adsorption systems shows variability. More bonding states of the TM–N bond in Re@WS2 (ICOHP: −4.64 eV), Os@WS2 (ICOHP: −4.65 eV) and Ir@WS2 (ICOHP: −4.25 eV) indicate stronger N2 adsorption, i.e., more negative ΔE(*N2) (−1.62 eV to −1.90 eV). Whereas, more-filled antibonding orbital populations (or less-filled bonding orbital populations) of the TM–N bond in Cu@WS2 (ICOHP: −2.17 eV) and Pd@WS2 (ICOHP: −0.89 eV) indicate weaker N2 adsorption strength (−0.45 eV for Cu; −0.78 eV for Pd). As shown in Fig. S21, (ESI†) the linear scaling relation between the unoccupied d electronic states of TM and ΔE(*N2) is abundantly clear. The less unoccupied d orbital of Cu (0.23) and Pd (0.48) results in less σ donation from N to TM and weaker TM–N interactions.

Positive and negative values of –COHP indicate bonding and antibonding contributions, respectively. The Fermi level (EF) is set to zero.

(g) The linear relation between integrated COHP (ICOHP) of the TM–N bond and the adsorption energy of the N2 molecule (ΔE(*N2)). (h) The linear relation between the ICOHP of the NN bond and the charge state of adsorbed N2 (q(*N2)). A negative charge state of *N2 indicates that N2 gains electrons upon the adsorption process. 
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of gaseous N2 are σ and π* orbitals57 (Fig. S22, ESI†). When N2 in the gas phase adsorbs to Re/Os/Ir, the localized π* orbital becomes broadened and matches strongly with the 5d orbital of Re/Os/Ir. The occupied 5d electrons of Re/Os/Ir are injected into the vacant π* orbital of N2, forming the occupied d–π*(occ.) bonding orbital below the EF and the unoccupied d–π*(unocc.) antibonding orbital above the EF, as shown in Fig. 7(a–c). π* backdonation from the occupied 5d states of Re/Os/Ir induces the weakening and activation of the NN bond.
The correlation between the ICOHP of the NN bond and charge transfer from TM to N2 is investigated, as displayed in Fig. 7(h) (details are shown in Fig. S23, ESI†). The greater filling of antibonding orbital populations (or the less filling of bonding orbital populations) of the NN bond is an indicator of the weakened NN bond and there is more charge backdonation from the occupied 5d orbital of Re/Os/Ir to the vacant π* orbital of N2. The redistribution of charge in real space clearly reflects the “donation–backdonation” mechanism124 in Re/Os/Ir@WS2 with N2 systems, as depicted in Fig. 7(d–f). The large charge accumulation (yellow region) between the Re/Os/Ir and the proximal N atom indicates a strong TM–N interaction. Slight charge depletion (blue region) occurs within the NN bond, suggestive of a weakened triple bond. Overall, N2 acts as an acceptor that extracts charge from Re/Os/Ir (charge donor) and there are approximately 0.29–0.41 electrons transferred between donor and acceptor. To summarize, the unoccupied 5d orbital enables Re/Os/Ir to accept lone-pair electrons from N2 to achieve N2 adsorption, while the occupied 5d orbital ensures electron feedback to the antibonding orbital of N2 to activate the inert triple bond, thus reducing the reaction energy and barrier of subsequent hydrogenation.
Considering the good correlation between ΔE(*N2H) and the ΔG of the PDS, we also calculate the COHP and ICOHP of the TM–N bond in N2H adsorption (details are shown in Fig. S24, ESI†). The data for ICOHP and ΔE(*N2H) reproduce the good linear relationship above, which means that the adsorption and activation of N2 are crucial for the subsequent hydrogenation process.
3.6 Stability of the screened SACs
Evaluation of the stability of TM SACs supported by a WS2 monolayer is crucial for their practical application. A Pt SAC on a WS2 nanosheet has been successfully synthesized by using a site-specific electrodeposition method.52 The strong electronic metal–support interaction between the Pt SAC and WS2 nanosheet induces the redistribution of the charge density around the metal center with the formation of a metal–support bond. Bader charge analysis (Fig. S6, ESI†) from our calculations confirms electrons transfer (0.03 e) from the Pt SAC to the WS2 support. For the screened SACs, the adsorption of the TM (Re, Os, Ir) on the WS2 support introduces more intense charge redistribution (0.12–0.5 e transfer from the TM to the support) and the formation of thermodynamically stable metal–support bonds. All three calculated bond lengths of metal–support bonds are about 2.23 Å, shorter than the W–S bond (2.41 Å) of pristine WS2. The calculated adsorption energies of Re, Os and Ir SACs are −3.60 eV, −3.02 eV and −3.34 eV (Fig. S4, ESI†), which are comparable to or even stronger than that of the Pt SAC (−3.11 eV). The site-specific electrodeposition method may also be suitable for the preparation of Re, Os and Ir SACs, and we are looking forward to electrochemical NRR characterizations of these candidates.
Atomically dispersed metal atoms tend to diffuse and aggregate on the substrate surface to form clusters due to the large increase in surface free energy125,126 and calculation of the Re/Os/Ir diffusion barrier is necessary to determine whether the aggregation of metal atoms occurs under ambient conditions. As shown in Fig. S25, (ESI†) the diffusion barrier of Re/Os/Ir from the W-top site to the adjacent W-top, Hollow and S-top sites is 1.07–1.45 eV, which ensures good dispersity of Re/Os/Ir on the WS2 support at room temperature. To evaluate the thermodynamic stability of the screened SACs, we performed an AIMD simulation127 for 10 ps at 500 K by using 1 fs time step and a Nosé–Hoover thermostat, as exhibited in Fig. S26, (ESI†) and the slight temperature and energy fluctuations unequivocally demonstrate the high thermodynamic stability of Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2.
4. Conclusions
In summary, for TM SACs supported by a WS2 monolayer, we conducted a comprehensive NRR study by performing DFT calculations, including atomic-scale mechanisms, thermodynamics, kinetics, activity trend, descriptors (activity and selectivity) and electronic origin. We found that the diversity in UL stems from the various adsorption strengths of reaction species on different SACs. The activity trend was constructed by using three parameters: ΔG(*N2 → *N2H), ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3) and UL, which intuitively indicated that access to the ideal activity region was constrained by the linear scaling relation between ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) and ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3), and the activity of SACs could be improved by adjusting these two parameters independently. According to the good correlations between adsorption energies of *N2H and other reaction species, we established a volcanic map and identified the *N2H adsorption energy as a single-parameter activity descriptor. The difference in UL between the NRR and HER could serve as a selectivity descriptor that determines the NRR faradaic efficiency. On the basis of these findings, we screened three promising SACs, that is, Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2, whose UL of NRR were –0.44 V, –0.38 V and –0.69 V, respectively. The moderate activation energy (0.47 eV–1.15 eV) of proton transfer on Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 indicated a kinetically feasible process. The TOF values of the NRR on Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 achieve 1.52 × 105, 8.21 × 102 and 4.17 × 10−4 per s per site at 400 K. The σ donation and π* backdonation improved the adsorption and activation of N2, which was responsible for the high activity of the screened SACs. The migration and aggregation of the isolated Re (Os or Ir) on the surface of WS2 were difficult at room temperature and the candidate materials showed high thermodynamic stability at 500 K. Modulation of the adsorption strength of *N2H was a potential and effective means for enhancing the NRR activity of SACs. This work not only offers a novel strategy for the effective screening and rational design of TM-based SACs with high activity toward the electrocatalytic NRR, but also provides theoretical guidance for experimentalists in the preparation of NRR electrocatalysts.

 	Fig. 1  (a) The top and side views of the WS2 monolayer. The blue and yellow balls represent W and S atoms. TMs are anchored at the top site of the W atom (W-top), the hollow site of three S atoms (Hollow), and the top site of the S atom (S-top) and these sites are marked with red, green and blue circles, respectively. The band structure and partial density of states (PDOS) of (b) the pristine WS2 monolayer. Total DOS (TDOS) and PDOS of (c) Re@WS2, (d) Os@WS2 and (e) Ir@WS2. The S and W atoms closest to TM (Re, Os, Ir) are selected to analyze the hybridization of the orbitals. The Fermi level (EF) is set to zero.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Schematic diagram of the general reaction mechanisms of the NRR on the catalyst surface. (b) The limiting potentials (UL in V) of TM@WS2; the horizontal blue dotted line represents the UL of the Ru(0001) surface.	 

 	Fig. 3  Linear scaling relations of (a) ΔE(*N2H) and ΔG(*N2 → *N2H), and (b) ΔE(*NH2) and ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3). (c) Color-filled contour plot of the UL of the NRR as a function of ΔG(*N2 → *N2H) and ΔG(*NH2 → *NH3). (d) Volcano plot of the UL of the NRR as a function of ΔE(*N2H). The horizontal dotted blue line represents the UL of NRR on the Ru(0001) surface. The blue region represents the NRR activity region compared to Ru(0001). (e) Color-filled contour plot of UL(NRR) – UL(HER) as a function of UL(NRR) and UL(HER), where UL(NRR), UL(HER) and UL(NRR) – UL(HER) represent the UL of the NRR, the UL of HER on TM@WS2, and the difference between UL(NRR) and UL(HER). Highly active and selective SACs are indicated by a dashed red circle. (f) A volcano plot of the UL of the HER as a function of ΔG(*H). The horizontal dotted blue line represents the UL of the HER on the Pt(111) surface. The pink region represents the HER activity region compared to Pt(111).	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic diagram of the conversion of N2 to NH3 on Os@WS2via the distal pathway. The middle illustration is a comparison of the free energy diagrams of NRR on Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2via the distal pathway at 298.15 K. The vertical arrow marks the PDS and ΔGPDS indicates the free energy change (ΔG) of the PDS.	 

 	Fig. 5  Kinetics of solvated proton transfer. The solvated proton is adopted as H9O4+ near the intermediates. The atomic structures of initial states, intermediates, transition states (TSs) and final states on Os@WS2 are shown. The TSs are searched using the CI-NEB method. The geometric structures of the initial states, final states, and intermediates are fully relaxed. The calculated free energy diagrams of the NRR containing kinetic barriers on Re@WS2, Os@WS2 and Ir@WS2 at 298.15 K. The kinetic barriers are shown in parentheses. H: White; O: Red; N: Blue; Os: Green. The cyan balls represent the hydrogen atoms participating in the proton transfer.

Color-filled contour plot of the TOF as a function of temperature (300–1000 K) and pressure (1–100 bar) on (a) Re@WS2, (b) Os@WS2 and (c) Ir@WS2. The H+: N2 ratio is fixed at 3. (d) Simulated polarization curves of the NRR on Re@WS2, Os@WS2, and Ir@WS2 at 298.15 K.	 

 	Fig. 7  Crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) and PDOS of N2 adsorption on (a) Re@WS2, (b) Os@WS2, (c) Ir@WS2. Positive and negative values of –COHP indicate bonding and antibonding contributions, respectively. The Fermi level (EF) is set to zero. Charge density difference (in 0.001 eÅ−3) of N2 adsorption on (d) Re@WS2, (e) Os@WS2, (f) Ir@WS2. The yellow and blue regions suggest the accumulation and decrease in charge, respectively. (g) The linear relation between integrated COHP (ICOHP) of the TM–N bond and the adsorption energy of the N2 molecule (ΔE(*N2)). (h) The linear relation between the ICOHP of the NN bond and the charge state of adsorbed N2 (q(*N2)). A negative charge state of *N2 indicates that N2 gains electrons upon the adsorption process.
