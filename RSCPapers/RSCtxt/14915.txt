    , Accepted 4th February 2022First published on 7th February 2022AbstractEngineered anion vacancy catalysts exhibit speedy activity in the field of electrocatalysis due to their tunable electronic structure and moderate free energy of adsorbed intermediates. Herein, we demonstrate a facile process of preparing multiphase phosphides with abundant phosphorus vacancies (PV) supported on nanoporous Ni(Al). X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveal that the as-obtained material has ample PV induced by the AlP phase. The optimized catalyst also equips with aligned nanoflakes grown in situ on np-Ni(Al) skeletons/ligaments, thereby exposing a large specific surface area for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) in acidic media. Benefitting from its unique hierarchical structure and sufficient PV, the PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 electrode displays a low overpotential of 36 mV at a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 and an outstanding long-term operational stability for up to 94 h with a slight decay. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that PV could induce the redistribution of electrons and significantly reduce the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of 2PV-NiP2 on the P site close to PV (−0.055 eV). Moreover, the PV is beneficial for enriching the electronic states nearby the Fermi level, thereby improving the conductivity of NiP2 to achieve superior HER activity. This finding skillfully utilizes Al elements to not only create porous structures but also regulate the PV concentration, opening up an accessible route to obtain PVvia dealloying-phosphorization, and boosting the development of high-performance HER electrocatalyst.
Introduction
In the quest for renewable and clean energy, hydrogen has been identified as a potential candidate due to its high energy capacity and zero carbon dioxide release.1,2 With numerous advantages of using water as a starting material, no emission of greenhouse gases and high hydrogen production efficiency, electrochemical water splitting is considered to be a well-established commercial technology to convert electricity produced from intermittent renewable energy resources (i.e. solar energy, wind and wave power) into chemical energy stored by hydrogen fuel.3–5 Although noble metal Pt has been regarded as the most efficient cathodic catalyst, its high cost and scarcity are the key obstacles for large-scale industrialization and commercialization of hydrogen production.6,7 Hence, the intensive pursuit of earth-abundant materials with the ability to provide low overpotentials and long-term stability is beneficial for high-efficiency energy conversion systems.
At present, enormous efforts are devoted to exploiting first-row 3d transition metal-based materials including transition metal nitrides (TMNs),8,9 borides (TMBs),10,11 carbides (TMCs),12,13 sulfides (TMSs),14,15 and phosphides (TMPs)16–18 to enhance the catalytic activity of HERs. Especially, the TMPs possess a greater potentiality due to the polarization of the phosphorus terminal that can lead to partial negative charges of phosphorus centres, and thus, be conducive to the adsorption of protons.19 However, the hydrogen binding energy and conductivity are still hard to satisfy the demand of ideal HER electrocatalysts. According to previous research studies, these disadvantages can be improved by vacancy engineering, which is advantageous to modify the electronic structure of active sites and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*). To date, oxygen vacancy (OV) is the most reported anion vacancy because of its low formation energy. For instance, Karmakar et al.20 demonstrated that OV in NiMoO4 was favorable for the incoming of electroactive species and the reduction of the Fermi level by keeping antibonding states at higher energies. Besides, sulfur vacancy (SV), nitrogen vacancy (NV) and boron vacancy (BV) have been studied. For instance, Jia et al.21 showed that the SV created in Ni3S2 could dramatically increase the localized electron densities of the Ni atom around the SV and adjust the intrinsic HER activity. Zhang et al.22 verified that the NV-enriched Ni3N1−x/NF was in the metallic state with a high electrical conductivity and a low d-band center, facilitating the adsorption of H2O and optimizing the adsorption/desorption behavior of H*. At the same time, BV could alter the lattice parameters of transition metal diborides and increase the electron density at the Fermi level.23 Remarkably, the introduction of vacancies in catalysts brings about the following superiority for electro-catalytic reactions: (i) tuning the electronic structure and promoting electron transfer; (ii) improving the electrical conductivity by increasing the density of states (DOS) close to the Fermi level; and (iii) activating the adjacent atoms and decreasing the Gibbs free energy. However, the influence of the phosphorus vacancy (PV) on the catalyst's electronic structure and HER activity has been rarely experimentally and theoretically reported derived from its relatively higher formation energy.
Furthermore, it is considered that the micro configuration of catalysts can not only affect the distribution of active sites but also influence the mass or electron transportation during the electro-catalytic reaction process. Hence, a porous electrode with a three-dimensional (3D) structure and a large specific surface area is urgently required. Inspired by previous studies, the fabrication of 3D porous materials mainly depends on the “down-to-top” route such as hydrothermal treatment,24 solvothermal treatment,25 electro-deposition,26 and microwave pyrolysis,27 which are complicated, costly and commercially not viable. Inevitably, most nano-structured catalysts generally have to be immobilized on a conductive substrate using polymer binders, leading to inferior conductivity. Except for those self-supported electrodes based on foamy metals, precursor layers would be first obtained to decorate their microstructures, which belong to hetero-structures and are prone to fall off from the substrate with the evolution of gas bubbles. To this end, dealloying, a traditional “top-to-down” approach to selectively etch the chemically/electrochemically active constituents from the mother alloy and reorganize the relatively inert elements into bi-continuous porous metals/alloys/compounds, has been restudied lately and proven to generate 3D frameworks with tunable channels. Thanks to the unique dealloying mechanism, the stabilities of dealloyed electrodes have been enormously elevated. Jiang et al. developed Co3Mo/nanoporous Cu as a self-supported monolithic electrode by dealloying for highly efficient overall water splitting. Surprisingly, when Co3Mo/np-Cu was tested at −60 mV vs. RHE for 1000 h, there was nearly no obvious fluctuation because the intermetallic Co3Mo nanoparticles were seamlessly integrated into the firm metal skeleton. Apart from these, some reports in the literature also confirm that the dealloyed products have residual active components that cannot be completely dissolved and are rich in OV,28,29 which are expected to promote the formation of the PV after subsequent phosphating.
In this contribution, we combine dealloying and solid-vapor phosphorization to construct multiphase phosphide nanoflakes in situ with the AlP-induced PV on self-supported np-Ni(Al). As-fabricated PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 is featured with regularly aligned nanoflakes, which are self-grown on the ligament surface of the nanoporous structure, offering more sufficient active sites. The catalyst endows excellent electrocatalytic HER performance in an acidic environment, requiring an overpotential of only 36 mV (iR-corrected) at a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2, exhibiting a small Tafel slope of 38.03 mV dec−1 and good catalytic durability. DFT calculations demonstrate that the PV formed in phosphides could enrich the electron density of P atoms nearby the PV and facilitate the H* adsorption process on P sites, contributing to the enhanced conductivity and reduce ΔGH*. This work proposes a feasible and scalable strategy to explore efficient electrocatalysts via designing 3D porous structures and phosphorus vacancies, creating more opportunities in the field of material science and electrocatalysis.
Experimental
Material preparation

Preparation of np-Ni(Al). 
As shown in Scheme 1a, an Al85Ni15 (at.%) alloy ingot was first prepared by co-melting pure Al (99.99 wt%) and pure Ni (99.95 wt%) in a quartz tube using a high-frequency induction furnace and then extruded into a graphite crucible (with an inner diameter of 14 mm) under argon atmosphere protection. Second, a wire-cutting technique was introduced to cut the Al85Ni15 alloy ingot into several alloy sheets (∅ 14 mm × 1 mm). The circular specimens were polished to a mirror finish, sequentially washed several times with ethanol and ultrapure water, and definitively dried in air. Finally, the Al85Ni15 alloy sheets were dealloyed in a 6 M NaOH aqueous solution for different corrosion time periods, which was set as 20 min, 40 min and 60 min, respectively (Scheme 1b). With the incomplete dissolution of Al, the dealloying-driven np-Ni(Al) sheets can be free-standing as electrodes relying on the residual Al and Al3Ni phases. Thus, the np-Ni(Al) sheets with different porosities were denoted as np-Ni(Al)-20, np-Ni(Al)-40 and np-Ni(Al)-60, respectively. After dealloying, the samples were rinsed repeatedly with ethanol and ultra-purified water to remove the residual ions (Na+, OH−, etc.), followed by drying at 60 °C under vacuum overnight.

Preparation of PV-np-Ni(Al). 
In order to obtain phosphides, the np-Ni(Al) sheet was put into a ceramic boat, with ca. 1 g of red phosphorus placed 2 cm away from np-Ni(Al) at the upstream side (Scheme 1c). Subsequently, the boat was put into a tube furnace, which was purged with highly purified Ar for 20 min. The furnace was heated to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, and kept at this temperature for 2 h. Then, the chamber was cooled down to 250 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and held at this temperature for further 2 h. At last, the furnace was naturally cooled down to ambient temperature. The resulting specimens were marked as PV-np-Ni(Al)-20, PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 and PV-np-Ni(Al)-60.

Material characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were tested using a diffractometer (DX-2700 X-ray) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154059 nm) at 40 kV and 30 mA. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis was conducted using a JES FA200. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were carried out using a scanning electron microscope (S-4800, Hitachi) to observe the microscopic morphology and composition of catalysts. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2010F electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (Quantax-STEM, Bruker). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray source. All of the binding energies were calibrated according to the reference energy of C 1s (C 1s = 284.8 eV).
Electrochemical measurements
HER performances were tested using a CS2350H electrochemical workstation in a typical three-electrode cell equipped with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, a graphite sheet as the counter electrode and PV-np-Ni(Al)/np-Ni(Al)/Al85Ni15/P–Ni/NiP2 as the working electrode. For the preparation of state-of-the-art Pt/C (20%, Johnson Matthey), 10 mg catalyst was first mixed in 300 μL isopropanol and 100 μL Nafion solution (0.5 wt%) to form a well-dispersed suspension. Then, 60 μL suspension was dropped onto the surface of the as-treated Ti foil (∅ = 14 mm) using a micropipette and dried at room temperature. Finally, the catalyst was covered with 60 μL of Nafion solution to ensure the tight attachment of the catalyst onto the electrode surface. The catalytic performance toward the HER was evaluated in an acidic solution (0.5 M H2SO4, pH = 0). The reference electrode was converted into RHE according to the Nernst equation (ERHE = ESCE + 0.241 + 0.059 pH). Since the as-measured potentials/currents of reactions cannot directly reflect the intrinsic behavior of the catalysts due to the effect of solution resistance, an iR compensation was applied to all initial linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves according to the following equation: Ecorr = Emea − iR. Unless otherwise specified, the current densities were normalized by geometric areas.
DFT calculations
All DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The electronic exchange–correlation function of the interacting electrons was described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE). The cutoff energy was set to 400 eV and the Brillouin zone was sampled by a 2 × 2 × 1 k-point grid. Atomic positions were optimized until the residual force and energy were less than 0.05 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively. A 2 × 2 supercell with the (001) facet was used to investigate the HER mechanism. The vacuum thickness along the z-axis was set around 15 Å, which was large enough to prevent undesired interaction between the adjacent layers. The Gibbs free energy of H adsorption on NiP2 (001)/1PV-NiP2 (001)/2PV-NiP2 (001) surface was calculated as follows: ΔGH* = Etotal − Esurface − EH2/2 + ΔZPE − TΔS(1)where Etotal is the total energy of adsorption state, Esurface is the energy of the pure catalyst, EH2 is the energy of H2, ΔZPE is the zero-point energy difference, T is 298.15 K and ΔS is the entropy change.
Results and discussion
Phase and microstructure analysis
As shown in Fig. S2,† the Al85Ni15 alloy is mainly made up of α-Al (JCPDS 04-0787) and Al3Ni (JCPDS 02-0416) phases, which are consistent with the binary phase diagram shown in Fig. S1.† After selectively leaching Al at ambient temperature, most of the α-Al phase was dissolved but intermetallic Al3Ni retained, and thus, a typical bi-continuous interpenetrating cluster-channel structure was formed. With the prolongation of the dealloying time from 20 min to 60 min, the remaining Al elements were gradually decreased, which can be detected from Fig. S3(a, c and e).† Meanwhile, the ligament sizes were getting smaller and smaller (Fig. S3(b, d and f)†), resulting from the dissolution of α-Al at different levels. When suffering subsequent phosphorization, NiP2 (JCPDS 73-0436) and AlP (JCPDS 80-0013) phases were generated on the surface of PV-np-Ni(Al)-20 (Fig. S4a†), while the signal peaks of substrate material (α-Al and Al3Ni) were still obvious. It is worth noting that the diffraction peaks of NiP2 are slightly red-shifted relative to the standard lines, especially in the high-angle region. According to Bragg's law (λ = 2dsinθ), the value of d decreases along with the increase in angles at a given radiation wavelength, demonstrating the incorporation of smaller atoms (i.e. O atom) into the NiP2 lattice or the formation of vacancy defects.30 Differently, PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 consists of NiP2, Ni5P4 (JCPDS 89-2588) and AlP phases (Fig. 1), of which NiP2 is a major component (ca. 76.2 wt%, Fig. S5†). Interestingly, the diffraction peaks of NiP2 and Ni5P4 are all shifted to high angles except for those of the AlP phase. Besides, the PV-np-Ni(Al)-60 is composed of NiP2, Ni3P (JCPDS 89-4748) and AlP phases (Fig. S4c†), analogously exhibiting the phenomenon that the diffraction peaks of Ni–P phases have positive skewing. It can be speculated that the AlP phase may induce smaller lattice spacing of the Ni–P phase and then influence the XRD peak position. In order to verify this hypothesis, phosphatized pure Ni without Al was also synthesized under the same condition and the corresponding XRD result in Fig. S4e† indicates that there is no peak shift of the Ni5P4 phase, which is the only phosphide produced on pure Ni. Similarly, there is no positive shift for XRD peaks of pure NiP2, as shown in Fig. S4g.† Therefore, a small amount of AlP is good for the formation of O-doping or PV in Ni–P compounds, modifying their electronic structures and intrinsic activities.

Additionally, EPR curves in Fig. 2a clearly suggest that the resonance signal of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 is stronger than that of P–Ni, further confirming the high concentration of PV in PV-np-Ni(Al)-40. XPS analysis was employed to investigate the electron valence states of the PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 sample. The XPS survey spectra in Fig. 2b shows the presence of Al, Ni, P, O and C elements. Among them, C should be ascribed to the carbon contamination from air contacting. In the Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 2c), the two peaks located at 853.3 and 871.0 eV are corresponding to Niδ+ 2p3/2 and Niδ+ 2p1/2, being in good agreement with the previous reports in Ni–P compounds.31–33 While the peaks at 857.1 and 875.5 eV are assigned to Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+ 2p1/2, respectively, probably deriving from the surface oxidation.34,35 Apparently, the intensity of Ni–P peaks is much weaker than that of Ni–O peaks, which can also be found in Ni12P5 modified with phosphorus vacancies.36 Hence, it is reasonable to deem that the introduction of PV into NiP2 could result in the attenuation of Ni–P signal peaks. With respect to the P 2p region (Fig. 2d), the binding energies (BEs) at 129.5 and 131.1 eV belong to P–Ni bonds and the broad peaks at about 134.6 and 136.7 eV represent oxidized P species (i.e. PO3−/PO43−).35 Moreover, the O 1s XPS peaks located at 531.1 and 533.3 eV originated from oxygen vacancy (OV) and adsorbed oxygen (Oad), respectively (Fig. 2e).37,38 The striking OV peak is inevitable especially during dealloying39 and high-temperature phosphating processes. It can be interpreted that the O atoms are doped into the Ni–P compound by replacing partial P atoms and subsequently producing OV by virtue of its lower formation energy, equivalently forming the PV. In the Al 2p region (Fig. 2f), the peak centered at 74.1 eV and the small shoulder peak in a higher energy region (77.1 eV) mean Al3+ and defective sites, respectively.40,41

The low-magnification SEM image shown in Fig. 3a displays that the as-phosphatized PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 electrode still maintains its integrated porous feature. While in Fig. 3b, it can be seen that the surface of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 is well covered by vertically grown nanosheets, which are denser than that of PV-np-Ni(Al)-20 (Fig. S4b†), PV-np-Ni(Al)-60 (Fig. S4d†), Ni–P (Fig. S4f†) and NiP2 (Fig. S4h†). This is probably because the appropriate Al residual content in the catalyst could well induce the growth of Ni–P nanosheets on np-Ni(Al), further increasing the specific surface area. Based on the special structure, there exist synergistic interactions between skeletons and nanosheets as well as its interconnected porous architectures, offering significantly enhanced catalytic sites and promoting the mass/electron transportation.

The TEM image shown in Fig. 3c shows that the size of a single nanosheet on PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 is ca. 2–3 μm. Clearly, the surface of the nanosheet is rough and seems to have some nanoholes, which may be attributed to the existence of defects. The HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3d manifests a great many well-resolved lattice fringes with a mean interplanar distance of 2.72 Å, which is slightly smaller than the standard value (2.735 Å) of NiP2 (200). While the measured value (3.13 Å) of AlP (111) is equal to the reference value. These results are in accordance with the XRD information in Fig. 1. In addition to these, there appear some fuzzy lattice fringes around NiP2 (200) marked by yellow circles, further verifying the formation of PV sites. The correlative elemental mapping images shown in Fig. 3e indicate the existence of uniformly distributed Al (yellow), Ni (red) and P (green) across the whole surface of the PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 nanosheet without discernible segregation. The SAED pattern in Fig. 3f confirms the major diffraction rings that matched well with the planes of NiP2, Ni5P4 and AlP, which is in line with XRD results.
Electrochemical performance analysis
As shown in Fig. 4a, the electro-catalytic HER activities of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40, P–Ni, np-Ni(Al)-40, Al85Ni15 and commercial Pt/C catalysts were evaluated by LSV curves in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. It is clear that PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 exhibits Pt-like activities with a very small overpotential of 36 mV at a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2. As the current density increases to 100 mA cm−2, the corresponding overpotential of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 (η100 = 139 mV) becomes slightly larger than that of commercial Pt/C (η100 = 109 mV), but it is still far lower than that of P–Ni (η100 = 221 mV), np-Ni(Al)-40 (η100 = 324 mV), Al85Ni15 (η100 ≈ 460 mV) and the other porous/phosphatized electrodes in this work (Fig. S6 and Table S1†). Besides, the HER performance of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 electrode exceeds some previously reported catalysts such as FeP nanosheet/Ti (η10 = 79 mV),42 RuP2/NPC (η10 = 59 mV),43 FeCoP2@NPPC (η10 = 114 mV),44 and CoP/CN/Ni (η10 = 66 mV)45 (Table S2†).

(i) Amount of theoretically calculated and experimentally measured H2 production on PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 at an overpotential of 100 mV for 2 h. 
The Tafel slopes derived from polarization curves according to the Tafel equation (η = a + blogj, where η is the potential after iR correction, a is the Tafel constant, b is the Tafel slope, and j is the current density) are shown in Fig. 4b. In general, a smaller Tafel slope indicates a faster HER kinetics. Remarkably, the Tafel slope of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 is 38.03 mV dec−1, which is far lower than the values of np-Ni(Al)-40 (131.77 mV dec−1) and Al85Ni15 (145.70 mV dec−1), but still slightly higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (31.81 mV dec−1) catalyst. According to the classic theory on the mechanism of hydrogen evolution (eqn (2)–(4)), it is deemed that PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 involves the Tafel–Heyrovsky mechanism and the Heyrovsky reaction is the rate-limiting step.46

Recombination step (Tafel reaction): (4)
Furthermore, the exchange current density (j0) obtained from the intercept of the Tafel plot was used to evaluate the intrinsic activity of the electro-catalyst. The calculated j0 of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 is 0.542 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4c), which is not only superior to that of np-Ni(Al)-40 (j0 = 0.202 mA cm−2) and Al85Ni15 (j0 = 0.127 mA cm−2), but also surpasses the values of reported NPSCL@S-MoP NSs/CC (j0 = 0.399 mA cm−2),47 PBC-800 (j0 = 0.0525 mA cm−2)48 and Ni2P/CC (j0 = 0.066 mA cm−2).49
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40, np-Ni(Al)-40 and Al85Ni15 are shown in Fig. 4d to investigate the charge transfer mechanism of HERs on these catalysts. A common equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 4d was used for fitting the experimental data, and the obtained related parameters are summarized in Table S3.† Among them, the solution resistance (Rs) provides information about the ohmic resistance arising from the electrolyte and all contacts, as well as used for the iR-correction. The semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the H+ reaction at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces, and a lower Rct value corresponds to a faster reaction rate. Obviously, the Rs value of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 (ca. 0.393 Ω) is smaller than that of the other two, revealing a minor ohmic loss and a better conductivity of the electrode. Beyond that, the PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 also presents the lowest value of Rct (5.019 Ω), which further certifies that there occurs a faster charge transport rate during the HER process on PV-np-Ni(Al)-40.
To clarify the influence of the active surface area on the electrocatalytic HER activity, the corresponding electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the catalyst was analyzed by applying cyclic voltammetry cycles at different scan rates (Fig. 4e). By plotting Δj (Δj = janode − jcathode) at 0.15 V against the scan rates, the Cdl value of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 was calculated to be 39 mF cm−2 (Fig. 4f), which is larger than that of P–Ni (23 mF cm−2, Fig. S7†), np-Ni(Al)-40 (18 mF cm−2), Al85Ni15 (6.7 mF cm−2) and other reported self-supported electrodes such as CoMnP/Ni2P/NF (37.9 mF cm−2),50 P–CoTe2/C (28.4 mF cm−2)51 and FeP2–NiP2@PC (6.3 mF cm−2).52 Afterwards, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) can be approximatively reckoned from the value of Cdl according to the following formula: ECSA = Cdl/Cs(5)where Cs is the specific capacitance of a flat surface that could be in the range of 20–60 μF cm−2, and 40 μF cm−2 was selected as a moderate value in this study as in previous studies reported in the literature. Thereout, the ECSA of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40, np-Ni(Al)-40 and Al85Ni15 is ca. 975, 450 and 167.5 cm2, respectively. The larger surface area of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 is due to its dual structure of crosslinking nanoporous skeletons and nanosheet-like arrays on the ligament, cooperatively offering sufficient channels for the electron/mass transmission during the electro-catalytic HER process.
The turnover frequency (TOF) is defined as the number of H2 produced per second per site, which is the relevant scientific metric for comparing the intrinsic activity for HERs (ESI Note 1†). Fig. 4g shows that the TOF values of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 were determined to be 0.21 and 0.44 s−1 at overpotentials of 100 and 150 mV, respectively. It reveals that PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 is far superior to Ni2P–Ni12P5/NF (0.11 s−1 at 100 mV),53 S–NiCoP NW/CFP (0.024 s−1 at 100 mV),54 C–Co2P (0.14 s−1 at 100 mV),55 NiCo/NiCo–OH (0.23 s−1 at 150 mV),56 Al–CoS2 (0.164 s−1 at 150 mV),57 P–NiSe2@N–CNTs/NC (0.17 s−1 at 200 mV),58 NiCo2–B–P (0.17 s−1 at 200 mV)59 and Se–CoP (0.158 s−1 at 200 mV).60
Electrochemical stability is another important parameter for HER electrocatalysts. Usually, an accelerated degradation test (ADT) was performed between −200 and 60 mV (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. As depicted in Fig. 4h, the HER overpotential of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 at 100 mA cm−2 increases by only 49 mV after 5000 cycles, stating its reliable stability. Moreover, the long-term durability of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 was examined by electrolysis at a constant cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2. As expected, the η–t profile is steady within the initial 48 h and only has slight attenuation in the following 48 h, demonstrating the robust durability of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 even after continuous HER operation for 4 days in an acidic medium (inset of Fig. 4h). Meanwhile, the j–t profiles under various overpotentials from −50 to −150 mV (Fig. S8†) maintain their current densities at about 15, 53 and 115 mA cm−2, respectively. With the decrease in the applied overpotentials from −150 to −50 mV, the current densities decrease accordingly and rapidly reach stability. After a series of HER assessments, there is almost no structural changes of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 (Fig. S9(a and c)†), highlighting its outstanding structural robustness during the electrocatalytic HER process. However, the content of O declines after continuous stability and durability tests (Fig. S9(b and d)†), which are possibly caused by the dissolution of oxides in a sulfuric acid solution. To sum up, PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 is highly acid stable.
To further assess the superficial chemical state of post-tested PV-np-Ni(Al)-40, the XPS measurement was also employed (Fig. S10†). The survey spectra in Fig. S10a† show that the O signal peak has a sharp attenuation, being in line with the EDX result in Fig. S9d.† As for Ni 2p, the relative intensities (Fig. S10b†) and contents (Table S4†) of Ni2+ peaks significantly decline after the HER test, which is mainly due to the dissolution of surface oxides in an acidic electrolyte. Correspondingly, the intensities of Niδ+ peaks have obviously increased and thus expose more active sites for HERs. In view of this, it can be concluded that the valence of Ni for HERs is δ+, which represents Ni–P compounds. In the P 2p spectrum (Fig. S10c†), the atomic ratio of Pδ− and P5+ has only slight variation, proving that the P element is highly acid-stable. Remarkably, the binding energies of Ni and P peaks get smaller, manifesting that the electronic interaction between them may be slightly weakened by the long-term test. With regard to the O 1s region (Fig. S10d†), the OV peak becomes extremely weak, indicating the reduction of the vacancy defect and thus a lower electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, the defective site peak at ca. 77 eV in Al 2p has disappeared due to the long-term HER test but the Al3+ peak still exists.
To estimate the faradaic efficiency of H2 production on the PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 electrode, the amount of H2 generated was measured by a home-made H-type cell. In Fig. 4i, it is clear that the volume of experimentally quantified H2 matches well with that of theoretically calculated H2, revealing a high faradaic efficiency of ca. 100%.
Theoretical analysis
The above-mentioned experimental results indicate that the remarkable electro-catalytic activity of PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 should be rooted from its multilevel structure and multiphase composition, wherein PV-modified NiP2 serves as the main catalytic species and plays a key role in boosting the HER process. To deeply understand the effect of PV on NiP2, we performed DFT calculations on crystalline NiP2: NiP2 with one vacancy (1PV-NiP2) and NiP2 with two vacancies (2PV-NiP2). Based on NiP2 (Fig. 5a), we choose five different sites to remove one phosphorus atom as 1PV, respectively, which is shown in Fig. S11(a–e).† After structural optimization, the models all have changed and the total energy is −357.92, −358.95, −358.94, −358.79 and −358.78 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. S11(f–j).† It can be found that the total energy of 1PV-2 is the lowest, which is thus selected as the stable defect for further hydrogen adsorption (Fig. 5b). Subsequently, we calculate five possible adsorption sites for the H atom such as Ni–H-1, Ni–H-2, Ni–H-3, P–H-1 and P–H-2, which are all around PV (Fig. S12(a–e)†). After structural optimization, both the H atoms on Ni–H-1 and Ni–H-2 have been transferred on P sites (Fig. S12(f, g, k and l)†). Although their adsorption energies are lower than that of Ni–H-3 (Fig. S12(h and m)†), Ni–H-1 and Ni–H-2 are not optimal H* adsorption sites. Similarly, P–H-2 is more suitable than P–H-1 for H* adsorption due to its lower absorption energy (Fig. S12(i, j, n and o)†). Therefore, Ni–H-3 and P–H-2 sites are the optimal H* adsorption sites on Ni and P, respectively. In order to obtain the stable 2PV defect, we chose two symmetrical sites on the basis of 1PV to remove two phosphorus atoms as 2PV, as shown in Fig. 5c. For comparison, the same H* adsorption sites to 1PV were selected to calculate the adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy.

(g–i) Distribution of the charge density difference at NiP2-H, 1PV-NiP2-H and 2PV-NiP2-H. Gray, orange and white balls represent Ni, P and H atoms, respectively. Yellow zone and cyan zone mean electron accumulation and electron depletion, respectively. 
The density of states (DOS) of NiP2, 1PV-NiP2 and 2PV-NiP2 shown in Fig. 5d clearly indicates that the electronic states close to the Fermi level gradually increase as PV is introduced into NiP2. As we know, the higher the electron density at the Fermi level it presents, the more the active free electrons it possesses.61 Hence, NiP2 equipped with 2PV is more beneficial to charge-transfer, and produces a higher charge carrier density. In addition, DOS curves can also manifest that pure NiP2, 1PV-NiP2 and 2PV-NiP2 all have metallic properties, which are consistent with the results of band structures in Fig. S13(a–c).† To further study the real active sites of NiP2, 1PV-NiP2 and 2PV-NiP2 during acidic HERs, the Gibbs free energy of intermediate H* (ΔGH*) is proved to be a descriptor for assessing the intrinsic activity of catalysts. Generally speaking, the ideal value of |ΔGH*| is close to zero, implying that the reversible adsorption of hydrogen onto the surface of catalyst is neither too strong nor too weak, and is beneficial for HER process. Fig. S13(d–f)† show the H* adsorption model with the lowest energy on Ni sites of NiP2, 1PV-NiP2 and 2PV-NiP2, respectively. The corresponding ΔGH* was calculated to be −2.905, −0.645 and 0.525 eV (Fig. 5e), respectively, proving that the PV in NiP2 can change the electronic structure of pristine NiP2 and, indeed, boost the H* adsorption step. Surprisingly, the ΔGH* value of 2PV-NiP2 on P sites is significantly decreased to −0.055 eV (Fig. 5f and Fig. S13(g–i)†), which is superior to that of NiP2 (−2.045 eV), 1PV-NiP2 (−1.195 eV) and even Pt (−0.09 eV). It is likely that the redistribution of electrons on the P site around the PV generates a moderate H* adsorption/desorption trend. This phenomenon is more vividly illustrated by the differential charge density in Fig. 5g–i, affirming that more electrons aggregate on the surface of the P site adjacent to the PV especially in 2PV-NiP2. Furthermore, the charge redistribution is quantitatively described by Bader charge analysis (Table S5†), showing that about 0.07 electrons could migrate from Ni sites to P sites in 2PV-NiP2, which is more than that in NiP2 and 1PV-NiP2. Such changes of electronic states account for reasonable strength of H* adsorption, and thus, optimizing the environment for producing hydrogen.
Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated free-standing 3D electrodes by combining dealloying and solid-vapor phosphorization. The resulting catalysts are featured with tunable porous structures, on which they generate numerous nanosheets as active materials, dramatically increasing the special surface areas. In view of this, the PV-np-Ni(Al)-40 electrode holds the optimal HER activity, stability and durability in acidic electrolytes, which also depends on the appropriate dealloying time so as to produce NiP2, Ni5P4 and AlP in the subsequent phosphorization. Although there exist synergistic effects among the three final phosphides, the contribution of the AlP-induced PV is particularly meritorious. DFT calculations clearly manifest that the PV could induce electron enrichment on P sites close to vacancy and thus promote the H* adsorption step, which is regarded as the key factor in enhancing the HER performance. From the perspective of the electrode assembly, the in situ growth of nanosheets on np-Ni(Al)-40 further avoids the detachment of active materials and reinforces the binding strength, being conducive to the physical and electrochemical stability. This study paves a new way to fabricate a high-efficiency and low-cost self-supported electrode with tunable pore size and compositions for a wide range of energy- and environment-related applications.
