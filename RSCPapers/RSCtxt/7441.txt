    , Accepted 16th October 2019First published on 16th October 2019AbstractH2 has been identified as one of the potential energy vectors that can provide a sustainable energy supply when produced through solar-driven water-splitting reaction. Si is the second most abundant element in the Earth’s crust and can absorb a significant fraction of the solar spectrum while presenting little toxicity risk, making it an attractive material for photocatalytic H2 production. Hydrogen-terminated mesoporous Si (mp-Si) nanoparticles can be utilized to effectively drive the hydrogen evolution reaction using UV-to-visible light. In this work, the response of the photocatalytic activity of mp-Si nanoparticles to a series of HF acid treatments was investigated. A two-step magnesiothermic reduction method was used to prepare crystalline mp-Si nanoparticles with a specific surface area of 573 m2 g−1. The HF etching process was optimized as a function of the amount of acid added and the reaction time. The reaction time did not influence the H2 evolution rate substantially. However, the amount of HF used did have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity. In the presence of ≥1.0 mL HF acid per 0.010 g of Si, morphological damage was observed using electron microscopy. N2 adsorption measurements indicated that the pore size and surface area were also altered. Solution-phase 19F{1H} NMR studies indicated the formation of SiF5− and SiF62− when larger volumes of HF were used. Both factors, morphological damage and the presence of byproducts in the pores, likely result in a lowering of the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate. Under the optimized HF treatment conditions (0.5 mL of HF per 0.010 g of Si), a H2 evolution rate of 1398 ± 30 μmol g−1 h−1 was observed.
Introduction
H2 is an energy carrier that can be combusted without the release of CO2 and is also an important chemical feedstock.1,2 Industrially, it is predominantly produced via steam reforming of natural gas which is estimated to generate 8.6 tons of CO2 per ton of H2.3,4 As an alternative to this high carbon-footprint process, solar-driven water reduction systems have been explored extensively to sustainably produce H2.5–7 Coupled photovoltaic (PV)-electrolyzer systems,8–10 integrated photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells,11–13 and photobiological systems14–16 have all been demonstrated to enable solar-to-hydrogen conversion. Recent techno-economic analysis has shown that the direct conversion of water to H2 using dispersed particulate photocatalysts may be a simple and cost-effective alternative.17,18
The common semiconductors investigated for particulate photocatalytic water-splitting are metal oxides that absorb in the UV-region or nitrides, oxynitrides, or doped metal oxides that absorb visible light.19–25 While bulk Si has been extensively explored for water-splitting reactions in PV-electrolyzer and PEC systems,26–28 its application in particulate systems has been limited. This is due to the low energy difference between the conduction band-edge of Si and the water reduction potential, thus limiting efficient electron transfer from Si particles to the solution.29 However, quantum confinement increases the bandgap of Si (1.3–2.0 eV) from its bulk value (1.1 eV), which shifts the conduction band-edge position and allows for efficient electron transfer to drive H2 formation.30 Recent studies on photocatalytic H2 generation using particulate Si have focused on mesoporous nanostructures, because the porosity increases the number of catalytic sites and enhances light absorption via light trapping mechanisms.29,31,32 Due to these properties, mesoporous Si (mp-Si) generally outperforms conventional Si nanoparticles in H2 generation efficiency.
Along with porosity, the surface chemistry of Si also plays an important role in determining the efficiency of the photocatalytic reactions. Surface oxides can introduce trap states where photo-generated charge-carriers can recombine instead of performing fuel forming reactions.31 One way to mitigate this issue is to treat Si with HF to remove the surface oxides.33–35 However, the relationship between the etching routine and the observed photocatalytic activity, if any, has not been explored. Optimizing the etching conditions may enable the realization of superior photocatalytic activity using mp-Si nanoparticles. In this study, the influence of the amount of HF and the etching time on the photocatalytic H2 generation using mp-Si nanoparticles is reported. The porous nanoparticles were prepared via magnesiothermic reduction of SiO2 and treated with different volumes of 48% HF solution ranging between 0.2 and 5.0 mL to yield hydrogen-terminated surfaces. These nanoparticles were explored for photocatalytic H2 generation under 100 mW cm−2 of broadband illumination. The structural properties of the etched mp-Si nanoparticles were studied using electron microscopy, N2 adsorption, and solution- and solid-state NMR (ssNMR) techniques.
Results
The precursor silica was synthesized through a base-catalyzed Stöber sol–gel method which yielded an amorphous product as indicated by the broad peak at 22° in the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1A).36 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of 296 ± 11 nm (Fig. 1B). SiO2 nanoparticles were reacted with Mg powder initially at 650 °C for 0.5 h followed by 300 °C for 6 h under Ar atmosphere. We recently demonstrated that this two-step annealing process results in crystalline and high surface area mp-Si nanoparticles without a large amount of sintering.37 This is crucial as sintering can increase the distance that the carriers have to travel and introduce grain boundaries with trap states, both of which can lead to carrier recombination. After the reaction, the resulting product was cooled to room temperature and then treated with 1.0 M HCl solution to remove MgO and any unreacted Mg. After 4 h of HCl reaction, a brown-solid was collected via filtration and dried overnight. The powder XRD pattern of the isolated product showed characteristic reflections at 28.5°, 47.4°, 56.2°, 69.2°, and 76.6° corresponding to the (111), (220), (311), (400), and (331) planes of diamond structured Si (Fig. 1A).37 The SEM image showed mp-Si particles which are mostly spherical with a rough surface (Fig. 1C). The specific surface area of the mp-Si nanoparticles was determined to be 573 ± 32 m2 g−1 using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (Fig. S1A, ESI†).38 The average pore diameters were found to be 10 and 28 nm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model (Fig. S1B†).39 The diffuse reflectance spectrum and corresponding Kubelka–Munk function of the mp-Si nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 1D. The bandgap (Eg) was estimated to be 1.78 eV from the Tauc plot (Fig. 1E).

The mp-Si nanoparticles were treated with a mixture of EtOH, H2O, and varying volumes of 48% HF to yield hydrogen-terminated surfaces. The attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectra of the mp-Si nanoparticles showed characteristic Si–Hx stretches at ∼2080 cm−1 for all the etched samples (Fig. S2†).30 All the particles showed some degree of oxidation as evidenced by the presence of Si–O–Si stretches at ∼1100 cm−1,30 however, the intensity of these stretches decreased with increasing amount of HF. After treatment with HF, the hydrogen-terminated mp-Si nanoparticles were isolated, rinsed with DI-water, and quickly transferred to a Pyrex reaction vessel for photocatalysis experiments. The amount of H2 evolved was quantified using gas chromatography (GC) and is summarized in Fig. 2. A representative H2 evolution trend over the course of 5 h is shown in Fig. 2A. The unetched mp-Si nanoparticles had an average H2 evolution rate of 838 ± 22 μmol h−1 g−1 of Si in 5 h. The hydrogen-terminated mp-Si nanoparticles had an average H2 evolution rate of 815 ± 26, 1194 ± 18, 1060 ± 24, 775 ± 36, and 516 ± 45 μmol h−1 g−1 of Si when 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mL of 48% HF was used for the etching process, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE) of the mp-Si nanoparticles were calculated at 420 nm. The values were found to be 2.3 ± 0.3, 2.1 ± 0.4, 3.1 ± 0.4, 2.5 ± 0.4, 1.9 ± 0.3, and 1.2 ± 0.4% when no HF, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mL of 48% HF was used for the etching process, respectively.

The morphology of the mp-Si nanoparticles before and after treatment with HF acid was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Similar to the SEM image (Fig. 1C), the TEM image of the unetched sample (Fig. 3) mostly contained porous spherical nanoparticles. In the presence of 0.2 mL of HF, no morphological damage was observed, and the sample mostly consisted of intact nanoparticles. More broken nanoparticles were observed when 0.5 mL of HF was used. However, in the presence of 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mL of HF, significant damage was observed and none of the original spherical particles were visible. Instead, smaller non-spherical pieces (<250 nm) and particles ranging between 6 and 10 nm were observed. The absorption properties (based on the Kubelka–Munk function) of the mp-Si nanoparticles treated with 1.0–5.0 mL were similar (Fig. S3†). Particles treated with 0.2 mL were like the unetched particles and showed higher absorption between 300 and 550 nm compared to the 1.0–5.0 mL set whereas those etched with 0.50 mL had slightly higher absorption between 300 and 375 nm. The specific surface areas of the HF treated mp-Si nanoparticles were 560 ± 21, 428 ± 25, 243 ± 18, 149 ± 30, and 132 ± 24 m2 g−1 when 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mL of HF was used, respectively (Fig. S4†). The mp-Si pore diameter decreased with increasing volume of HF. The particles treated with 0.2 mL of HF had a broad pore size distribution with an average diameter of around 18 nm (Fig. S5†). With increasing volume of HF, pores with ∼4 nm diameters began to form and the relative number of pores between 15 and 30 nm in diameter decreased (Fig. S5†).

To complement the TEM and N2 adsorption studies which provided information on the morphological differences in the mp-Si nanoparticles and investigate if any of the HF etching products or byproducts were contained within the pores of the mp-Si, NMR studies were performed on nanoparticles dispersed in acetone-d6. The 19F{1H} NMR spectra showed a broad peak between −178 and −185 ppm for all samples. The peak width of the signal increased with increasing volume of HF (Fig. 4B). HF signals have previously been reported to be broad peaks with chemical shifts observed here and line widths changing as a function of their concentration.40–42 When 0.2 and 0.5 mL of HF was used, a second broad peak was observed around −151 ppm (Fig. 4A) which is assumed to be HF in a different chemical environment. For volumes ≥0.5 mL of HF, two sharp signals between −151 and −152 ppm were observed which is consistent with the presence of SiF5− (smaller peak) and SiF62− (larger peak).43,44 The intensity of both SiF5− and SiF62− signals increases with increasing volume of HF. 1H ssNMR experiments on hydrogen-terminated silicon nanoparticles have previously reported chemical shifts ranging between 6 and 3 ppm for the H atoms.45 The 1H ssNMR shown in Fig. S6† exhibits peaks between 7 and 0 ppm which likely result from the Si–H and Si–OH groups.45,46 The intensities of the signals between 3 and 0 ppm reflect the increased Si–Hx species with increasing HF amount, while those between 7 and 3 ppm are already present in the unetched sample and likely belong to Si–OH. In the solution-phase 1H NMR experiments, the signal for hydrogen-terminated mp-Si nanoparticles was found to shift with differing HF volume (Fig. 4C). The 1H NMR peak shifted from approximately 4.7 to 3.3 ppm when the HF volume changed from 5.0 to 0.2 mL, respectively. A quartet with a chemical shift ∼3.6 ppm was observed in all spectra, corresponding to ethanol –CH2– protons.47
 Fig. 4  (A, B, D and E) 19F{1H} NMR and (C and F) 1H NMR spectra of mp-Si nanoparticles treated with HF before and after evacuation. 
To remove the potentially trapped or adsorbed molecular species from the nanoparticles, the mp-Si was evacuated for 1 h and further investigated using NMR. 19F{1H} NMR spectra of the evacuated samples showed that the HF had been successfully removed through the disappearance of the peaks between −178 and −182 and at −151 ppm (Fig. 4D and E). However, multiple sharp signals were observed with chemical shifts ranging between −150 and −154 ppm which could be due to SiF5− and SiF62− in multiple chemical environments (Fig. 4D). In the 1H NMR spectra of the evacuated samples, the signals resulting from the hydrogen-terminated Si surface did not show much variation in chemical shift and all appeared between 3.0 and 2.8 ppm (Fig. 4F). This indicates that HF was the major species responsible for the downfield shifting of the 1H NMR signal when higher amounts of HF were used.
The unetched mp-Si nanoparticles and those treated with 0.20–1.0 mL of HF, were analyzed using 29Si{1H} CP/MAS ssNMR. This technique allows detection of Si atoms that are directly bound to protons (e.g. Si–Hx and Si–OH species), as well as those within close proximity of protons. The unetched mp-Si nanoparticles showed multiple overlapping signals ranging from −50 to −109 ppm (Fig. S7†). Signals from Si Q-sites ((Si–O)4−xSi(OH)x) are observed between −60 and −120 ppm.48 The signal for elemental Si is typically found between −60 and −85 ppm.45,49 Although the absence of nearby protons suppresses the signals for the crystalline Si-core in the 29Si{1H} CP/MAS ssNMR spectra, they are observed in the directly excited 29Si ssNMR spectra at −80.9 ± 1 ppm. It is likely that the 29Si NMR spectrum of the unetched nanoparticles has signals resulting from Q-sites and elemental Si atoms that are in proximity to –OH protons. The peaks at −5.1 and −20.4 ppm have previously been reported to result from (OH)nSi(–Si)m(–OSi)4−n−m species.50 The chemical identity of the species at −50 ppm is currently unclear. The 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mL etched samples had peaks around −95 ppm, likely corresponding to Si–Hx moieties (Fig. S7†). However, the Q-site Si atoms also have chemical shifts in that range complicating the determination of definitive assignments.49 The overlay plot of the unetched and etched samples shows that the width of this peak in the etched samples is narrower (Fig. S8†). The signals between −61 and −65 ppm are typical of Q0-site Si atoms.48 There were two peaks between −5 and −25 ppm in the etched samples. Signals in this region have previously been assigned to incompletely etched surfaces such as HSi(–SiH3)2–OSiH3 or HO(H)Si(–SiH3)2 but can also correspond to the suboxide species observed in unetched samples.50
The evacuated mp-Si nanoparticles were investigated for photocatalytic H2 evolution using a similar set-up to that used before and the comparative rates before and after evacuation are shown in Fig. 5. The unetched samples had similar H2 evolution rates before and after evacuation, which were 838 ± 22 and 843 ± 21 μmol h−1 g−1 of Si, respectively. The highest increase in evolution rate after evacuation was observed for the 0.5 mL HF etched sample, which had a value of 1398 ± 30 μmol h−1 g−1 of Si. There was also a slight increase with the 0.2 and 1.0 mL HF etched samples which had H2 evolution rates of 920 ± 23 and 1156 ± 32 μmol h−1 g−1 of Si, respectively. The 2.0 mL (812 ± 40 μmol h−1 g−1) and 5.0 mL (592 ± 41 μmol h−1 g−1) samples had H2 production rates similar to those of the samples before evacuation was performed.

The reaction of mp-Si nanoparticles with 48% HF solution was optimized as a function of etching time. A 0.5 mL volume was used for these studies and the particles were reacted for 1, 5, 10, and 15 min. The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate was found to be 1340 ± 50, 1398 ± 30, 1395 ± 32, and 1403 ± 27 μmol h−1 g−1 of Si for 1, 5, 10, and 15 min, respectively.
Discussion
The ∼300 nm mp-Si nanoparticles were synthesized using a previously reported magnesiothermic reduction method which resulted in a porous 3-D network of nano-sized (3–10 nm) primary Si particles.51 The small size of the primary particles reduces the carrier diffusion lengths and increases the bandgap, both of which should allow for better carrier transfer to generate H2 from water.29,31,52 The as-prepared (unetched) particles had a photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 838 ± 22 μmol h−1 g−1 of Si which is higher than that of previously reported mp-Si generated via magnesiothermic reduction.32 This shows that the two-step reduction method results in a higher performing material. Both IR (Fig. S2†) and 29Si ssNMR (Fig. S7†) characterization showed the presence of oxide species in the unetched mp-Si nanoparticles. To further improve the H2 evolution rates, attempts were made to remove the oxide using HF acid according to the following reaction:35SiO2 + 4HF → SiF4 + 2H2O
Volumes of 48% HF varying between 0.2 mL and 5.0 mL were investigated for the oxide etching step. This should result in mp-Si nanoparticles with hydrogen-terminated surfaces, and this was confirmed by the presence of Si–Hx stretches in the IR (Fig. S2†) and 1H NMR (Fig. 4C and S6†) spectra. However, oxide species were detected in all the etched samples at some concentration in both the IR (Fig. S2†) and the 29Si ssNMR spectra (Fig. S7†). This shows that either the etching process is incomplete, or some degree of oxidation occurs during sample preparation. 19F{1H} NMR characterization of the etched samples showed that residual HF was present in all the samples (Fig. 4B). This had a de-shielding effect on the chemical shift of the hydrogen atoms attached to mp-Si nanoparticles. As the amount of HF present decreased the chemical shift of the hydrogen-terminated mp-Si nanoparticles also decreased from 4.7 to 3.3 ppm (Fig. 4C). In the presence of ≥0.5 mL of HF, formation of the secondary reaction byproducts (as shown in the reactions below) SiF5− and SiF62− was observed using 19F{1H} NMR (Fig. 4A):SiF4 + HF → HSiF5SiF4 + 2HF → H2SiF6
The intensity of the penta- and hexa-fluorosilicate signals in the 19F{1H} NMR spectra increased with increasing HF volume. The volume of HF acid used did not significantly influence the absorption properties of the mp-Si nanoparticles (Fig. S3†).
The photocatalytic H2 evolution rate using etched mp-Si nanoparticles was investigated. Despite having a negligible amount of residual byproducts, Si etched with 0.2 mL of HF did not have the highest activity. This is likely due to a higher concentration of oxide species, which result in carrier recombination. This is supported by the higher intensity of Si–O–Si stretches in the IR spectrum and the lower AQE. The mp-Si nanoparticles etched with 0.5 mL of HF resulted in the best performing photocatalyst in this study. This is likely due to the optimum combination of oxide removal and byproduct amounts. With increasing HF volume (i.e. ≥1.0 mL), the H2 evolution rate decreased. This decrease could be due to (i) morphological damage, as observed in the TEM images (Fig. 3) or (ii) blocking of the catalytic sites due to the presence of a higher concentration of byproducts such as HF, SiF5−, or SiF62−. The change in morphology when ≥1.0 mL of HF was used resulted in reduced specific surface area and formation of smaller pores, which can lower the number of catalytic sites and limit the diffusion of reactants and products. Both of these can result in reduced charge-carrier transfer (as reflected in the AQE measurements) and H2 formation.
To study the effect of reaction byproducts, the mp-Si nanoparticles were evacuated after the etching process. The trend for the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate after evacuation was the same as that before. The 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mL etched samples showed an increase in the rate, but the others remained similar to those before. The 19F{1H} NMR spectra showed the disappearance of all the peaks corresponding to HF, however, SiF5− and SiF62− remained which were found to be in two different chemical environments. It is possible that the applied vacuum redistributes the fluorosilicate species within the pores of the mp-Si nanoparticles instead of effectively removing it. When in contact with water at neutral pH (such as through photocatalysis reaction), these fluorosilicate species will undergo hydrolysis to form SiO2 as shown below:43SiF5− + 2H2O → SiO2 + 5F− + 4H+SiF62− + 2H2O → SiO2 + 6F− + 4H+
Formation of the oxide can introduce trap states, and block pores and catalytic sites, which can all reduce H2 evolution rates.31,53,54 It is likely that both the change in particle morphology and formation of deleterious byproducts lowers the H2 evolution rates, however, the current techniques do not allow us to confidently differentiate or quantify these contributions. The H2 evolution rates did not change significantly with different etching times.
Conclusions
In this study, the influence of the HF etching routine on the H2 evolution using mp-Si photocatalyst was investigated. HF treatment was performed to remove the oxide from Si particles and improve the catalytic performance. The highest H2 evolution rate (1398 ± 30 μmol g−1 h−1) was observed when 0.5 mL per 0.010 g of Si was used. A lower volume (0.2 mL) of HF did not remove enough of the oxide in mp-Si, whereas the higher volumes (≥1.0 mL) introduced reaction byproducts and morphological changes, all of which led to reduced H2 evolution rates. This shows that care must be taken when an HF etching step is involved, especially with porous nanoparticles that can trap reaction byproducts. Reaction byproducts and changes in morphology can lower the catalytic rates more than the initial oxide itself.
Experimental
Materials
Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 28%) and magnesium −325 mesh powder (Mg, 99.8%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99.9%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), calcium chloride (CaCl2) acetone-d6, methanol, ethanol (95%), and benzene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrofluoric acid (HF, 48%) was purchased from ACP. All reagents were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of Stöber SiO2 nanoparticles
The precursor SiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using a sol–gel process. TEOS (30.0 mL) was added to 95% EtOH (700 mL) followed by the addition of aqueous 28% NH4OH (60 mL) solution. The mixture was left to stir at room temperature for 18 h (ambient humidity was recorded at 60%). The white product was collected through vacuum filtration. The product was washed twice with 95% EtOH and re-collected through centrifugation at 3300 rpm for 15 min. It was then dried overnight in an oven at 100 °C.
Synthesis of mp-Si nanoparticles
Mp-Si was synthesized through a previously optimized two-step magnesiothermic reduction reaction. SiO2 nanoparticles (0.220 g) and −325 mesh Mg powder (0.196 g) were mixed together using a mortar and pestle until a homogeneous gray powder was obtained. The powder was transferred to a ceramic reaction boat which was placed in a quartz tube under Ar atmosphere. The mixture was initially heated to 650 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 and held at that temperature for 0.5 h, followed by 300 °C for 4 h. The reaction product was treated with HCl (1.0 M, 25.0 mL) for 6 h (stirred at 300 rpm). The mp-Si was then collected through suction filtration and washed with distilled H2O (150 mL). The mp-Si was then dried overnight in an oven at 100 °C.
HF acid etching procedure

Caution: HF can be extremely dangerous and must be handled with great care. Distilled H2O (5.00 mL) and EtOH (5.00 mL, 95%) were added to the mp-Si nanoparticles (10 mg). The mixture was sonicated for 10 s to improve dispersion. The desired amount of HF (0.2 mL, 0.5 mL, 1.0 mL, 2.0 mL or 5.0 mL; 48%) was added with stirring. The mixture was stirred for 5 min at 300 rpm. It was then separated into 2 aliquots and centrifuged for 6 min at 3300 rpm. The supernatant was decanted, and the etched mp-Si was transferred to the appropriate vessel for immediate analysis or experimental usage. A supersaturated solution of CaCl2 was available at all times for neutralization purposes.
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments
The photocatalytic experiments were performed in a gas-tight Pyrex cell. The etched mp-Si nanoparticles were rinsed with 5.0 mL of DI-water and transferred to the reaction vessel which was flushed with N2 for 0.5 h. 10.0 mL of H2O and 5.0 mL of MeOH (sacrificial agent) were bubbled with N2 for 0.5 h and transferred to the reaction flask containing the mp-Si nanoparticles under N2 flow. A broadband LED (Thorlabs, SOLIS-2C) was used as the light source and the photocatalytic reactions were carried out at 100 mW cm−2 power density. The illumination power was calibrated using a silicon photodiode (Thorlabs). Gas from the reaction vessel headspace was analyzed periodically for H2 quantification using gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (Agilent 7890A) and N2 was used as a carrier gas. The experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility. Apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) measurements were performed by irradiating the catalyst solution for 1 h with a 420 nm LED source (Thorlabs). The efficiency was calculated using the equation  
Materials characterization techniques
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected using a Hitachi S-4700 electron microscope. The samples were drop-cast from aqueous dispersions onto a silicon wafer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a FEI TechaniTM 12 electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. TEM samples were prepared by drop-casting nanoparticle suspensions onto a 200 mesh carbon coated copper grid. The images were analyzed using ImageJ software (version 1.52a).
The XRD patterns were collected on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer employing CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). The samples were placed on a zero-background Si wafer and spectra were collected at 3 counts per s.
N2 adsorption measurements were performed using an ASAP 2020 analyser (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA).
Diffuse reflectance measurements were performed on a Cary-5000 spectrometer with an integrating sphere and the Kubelka–Munk function was obtained using the relationship:  where k is the absorption coefficient, s is the scattering coefficient, and R is reflectance.
Solution phase NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AV-300 and AV-500C spectrometer. Acetone-d6 was used to disperse the hydrogen-terminated mp-Si NMR samples. Benzene was added as an internal standard. Samples were prepared in 0.5 mm borosilicate glass NMR tubes. 64 scans were acquired for both 1H and 19F{1H} (no baseline subtraction) NMR experiments. The spectra were recorded at 298 K. 1H and 29Si magic angle spinning (MAS) ssNMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer with a 16.4T magnet (139.2 MHz 29Si Larmor frequencies). The samples were spun at 6.5 kHz in rotors of 4 mm diameter. The 29Si ssNMR spectra were accumulated using 29Si{1H} cross-polarization (CP) at 4 ms CP contact times acquiring between 14400 and 3600 scans using a 1 s recycle delay. The chemical shift scale was referenced externally against Kaolin at −91.0 ± 0.5 ppm as the secondary chemical shift standard relative to TMS. 1H ssNMR spectra were acquired with background suppression55 adding 16 scans and referenced externally based on the 29Si resonance using the IUPAC conversion factor.56
