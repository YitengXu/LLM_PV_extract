    , Accepted 26th December 2019First published on 27th December 2019AbstractIn this paper, a sequence of Zn-modified Co@N–C composites are designed and developed via the direct annealing of Zn–Co bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework materials with different Co/Zn ratios and at different pyrolysis temperatures. As proved by the various measurements made, the size of the Co particles in the composites could be successfully adjusted from 18 nm to 6 nm. In addition, with a decrease in particle size the Co particles become covered by carbon layers, and the specific surface area and number of Co–N–C bonds are successfully increased. As a result, the current density and CO faradaic efficiency (FE(CO)%) in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction gradually improved (from 1.8 to 4.2 mA cm−2 for current density and from 25% to 60% for FE(CO)%) with a decrease in the Co particle size. Meanwhile, the ratio of H2/CO in the obtained syngas could be regulated in the range 5:1 to 1:1.5. The Zn–Co@N–C-25 composite displayed optimal activity, and there was no obvious decrease in catalytic performance, even after 40 h, implying excellent stability for the Zn–Co@N–C catalyst.
1. Introduction
Syngas, made up of CO and H2, is a fundamental building block for the production of synfuel and industrial chemicals via well-established industrial technologies.1–3 For example, optimal H2/CO ratios of 1.5–2.2 are commonly desired for the synthesis of methanol and Fischer–Tropsch reactions; syngas with a H2/CO ratio of 3 is typically used in the methanation reaction; and a H2/CO ratio of 1 is generally used for fine chemical synthesis and hydroformylation.4–6 At present, syngas with a tunable H2/CO ratio is mainly obtained from coal gasification and natural gas reforming, which uses nonrenewable fuels.7–10 Electroreduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to syngas, which uses CO2 and H2O as ideal carbon and hydrogen sources, not only serves as a clean and efficient syngas production technology, but also can be easily coupled to other intermittent energy sources, such as wind, solar and tidal power.11–18
Currently, different catalysts have been used to obtain syngas via CO2RR. Sheng et al. synthesized a carbon-supported palladium catalyst for CO2RR to syngas, and the H2/CO ratio was found to be between 2:1 to 1:1 under −0.5 to −0.6 V vs. RHE.19 A Co3O4–CD–C3N4 (CD, carbon dot) three-component electrocatalyst was also designed and used for CO2 reduction to syngas, and the H2/CO ratio of the syngas produced was tunable from 0.07 to 4:1 by controlling the potential from −0.3 to −0.8 V vs. RHE.20 Wu and co-workers employed porous palladium nanomesh catalysts for electrochemical conversion of CO2 into syngas, and tunable syngas H2/CO ratios from 2:1 to 1:1 could be achieved from −0.5 to −0.9 V vs. RHE.21 In these cases, adjustable H2/CO ratios of syngas were obtained through change in the applied potential. However, the ability to adjust the ratios of syngas through regulation of the catalyst is of great importance and should be investigated.22–24
Metal–nitrogen (M–N) active sites anchored within a carbon material (M–N–C), which could provide the active sites for CO2 and could easily transfer electrons, have been selected as a new type of efficient CO2RR catalyst in recent years.25–32 For synthesis of the M–N–C composites an annealing process is typically needed. In this process, the metal species aggregate easily into large particles, and the size of these particles is uncontrolled. More importantly, the particle sizes have a significant influence on the M–N bonds and on the catalytic performance in CO2RR.33 Therefore, how to control particle size is an important consideration for these M–N–C composites.
Herein, we introduce the design of a Zn-to-Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) to obtain Zn–Co bimetallic ZIF materials and to use the Zn species to slow down aggregation of the Co species during the annealing process. The influence of Co/Zn ratios and pyrolysis temperature on the size of the Co particles is investigated. Co–Zn@N–C composites with different Co particle sizes are also employed as catalysts for CO2RR. The relationship between Co particle size, structure, chemical bonds, and catalytic performance is discussed in detail. The Zn–Co@N–C-25 composite displayed optimal activity for CO2RR, and there was no decrease in catalytic performance after 40 hours, implying excellent stability for this Zn–Co@N–C catalyst.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals and materials
All raw materials were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co. Ltd., including cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), methanol (CH3OH) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, C3H7NO). All reagents were used as received without further purification. Ultrapure Millipore water (18.2 MΩ) was used in all experiments.
2.2 Synthesis of Co–Zn@N–C
In a typical procedure,34,35 Co(NO3)2·6H2O (a mmol) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (b mmol) (a + b = 1.55 mmol) were dissolved in 3 mL of water, and then this solution was added to 20 mL of a solution containing 5.5 g of 2-methylimidazole. The aqueous solution was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours. After completion of the reaction, the supernatant was poured out following centrifugation and the lower precipitate was collected and washed three times with methanol to obtain the preliminary product, which was dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C overnight to obtain the final product. The product was calcined in a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1, a calcination temperature of 800 °C, and a holding time of 4 hours. The composites obtained are denoted as Zn–Co@N–C-X, where X stands for the Co content (X = a/(a + b)). For treatment at different temperatures Zn–Co@N–C-25 is named as Zn–Co@N–C-25-Y, where Y represents the final pyrolysis temperature (600, 700, 800, 900 or 1000 °C).
2.3 Characterization
The crystal structure and morphology of the as-prepared samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS D8 Advance) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectroscopy measurements were recorded using a LabRam HR system equipped with a CCD detector and laser beam (λ = 532 nm) to identify the carbon structure under ambient conditions. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using an ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics Instrument) static volumetric analyzer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of samples were recorded on an FEI Quanta FEG 250 spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and elemental mapping tests were conducted on an FEI TECNAI G2 F20 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Detailed chemical compositions were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a ThermoFisher Scientific ESCALAB 250 XI spectrometer.
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
Experiments were performed in a customized H-type cell with two compartments separated by a Nafion-115 membrane (Dupont), and electrochemical measurements were performed with a CHI760E electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai) in a standard three-electrode system. Each compartment contained 120 mL of electrolyte and electrochemical characterization of the Zn–Co@N–C catalysts was carried out in 0.5 M KHCO3 (made using de-ionized water). A Pt plate was used as the counterelectrode, with Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode, and measurements were converted to values against a reduced hydrogen electrode (RHE). For the procedure for the working electrode, the ink was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of the Zn–Co@N–C catalyst into 4900 μL of DMF solution containing 100 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution and agitated ultrasonically for 1 h. If the catalyst loading is 0.1 mg cm−2, it is necessary to apply 100 μL of homogeneous ink to both sides of the carbon paper (1.0 × 0.5 cm2), so that the working electrode is well prepared. During the reaction, the electrolyte in the cathodic compartment was stirred continuously and the electrolyte was bubbled with CO2 for 30 min before measurement. All potentials in this study were calibrated to RHE using the conversion E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.1989 V + 0.0592 × pH. The products were taken directly into a gas chromatograph (GC-2010 plus, Shimadzu) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and the gaseous products were analyzed by gas chromatography every 30 min. In this process, a thermal conductivity detector and a methanator-assisted flame-ionization detector were provided to detect the gaseous products. The liquid products were analyzed on an ion chromatograph (Dionex 2000, ThermoFisher Scientific).
The FE was calculated using the following equation:36,37  where, Zi is the number of electrons required to produce an i molecule; Vi is the volume ratio of product i; G is the volumetric flow rate (10 mL min−1); F is the faradaic constant (96485 C mol−1); Po is the atmospheric pressure (1.013 × 105 Pa); I is the current at each applied potential; R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1); To is the reaction temperature (298 K).
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves and double-layer capacitance (Cdl) measurements of the Zn–Co@N–C composites were all conducted in an H-cell. The scan rate for the LSV measurements was 5 mV s−1 between 0 and −1.0 V vs. RHE in Ar or CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts was calculated from their electrochemical Cdl, and the Cdl can be obtained by cyclic voltammogram calculation. The potential ranged from 0.20 to 0.30 V vs. RHE with various scan rates (10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 mV s−1) under a CO2 atmosphere. The Cdl was calculated by plotting Δj = ja − jc at 0.25 V vs. scan rate, where jc and ja are the cathodic and anodic current densities, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
First, XRD was used to evaluate the crystal structure of the Zn–Co@N–C-X composites. As presented in Fig. 1(a), Zn–Co@N–C-100, without introduced Zn species, exhibits characteristic peaks for metallic Co species, and the diffraction peaks at 44, 55 and 76° are ascribed to the (111), (200) and (220) reflections (JCPDS no. 15-0806). This indicates that the homogeneously dispersed Co species in the Zn–Co-ZIF materials are reduced and aggregated to metallic particles during the pyrolysis process. It should be noted that the peaks of the Co phase become weak and broad with introduction of Zn species, indicating their smaller particle size with higher Zn content, which implies that the Zn species inhibit aggregation of metallic Co species. The crystalline size of the metallic Co was calculated using the Debye–Scherrer formula and the values are given in Table 1. The size of the Co particles changes from 18.0 to 6.90 nm in going from Zn–Co@N–C-100 to Zn–Co@N–C-25, and the introduced Zn species successfully adjusts the particle size of the Co component. This conclusion could be further verified from the subsequent TEM images (see Fig. 4). In addition, the absence of diffraction peaks for the Zn species implies that Zn exists in a highly dispersed state in these composites. For the Zn–Co@N–C-0 material, the diffraction peaks for the Co particles vanish and only broad peaks are observed at around 25° and 43°, corresponding to the (002) and (100) lattice planes of graphitic carbon. This is a result of vaporization of Zn species at high temperatures.

Fig. 1(b) compares the XRD patterns of Zn–Co@N–C-25 at different pyrolysis temperatures. With the temperature rising from 600 to 800 °C, the intensity of the diffraction peaks for metallic Co species increase slightly, and the crystalline size increases gradually from 3.69 to 6.90 nm. However, when the temperature reaches 900 and 1000 °C, the diffraction peaks increase sharply and the crystalline size increases to 18.4 and 28.3 nm, implying aggregation of the metallic Co species to form large particles. Therefore, pyrolysis temperature has a large influence on Co particle size. Furthermore, it should be noted that the diffraction peak at 26° becomes stronger, indicating that graphitic carbon is formed at higher pyrolysis temperatures, especially for temperatures higher than 800 °C.
Raman spectroscopy was conducted to reveal the structure of the Zn–Co@N–C composites obtained. As displayed in Fig. 2(a), two vibrational bands positioned at 1590 (G band) and 1340 cm−1 (D band) were clearly detected. The G and D bands reflect the sp2 and defect carbon, implying the existence of a graphitic and a disordered carbon structure.38,39 As an indication of the degree of graphitic carbon material, the relative intensity ratio of the D to G band (ID/IG) rises from 1.01 to 1.10 with increase in Zn species, implying a decrease in the graphitic carbon structure. Of all the samples, the Zn–Co@N–C-100 material has the highest graphitic carbon structure, which might be owing to catalytic graphitization of Co species. Hence, the graphitic carbon structure decreases with decrease in the Co content.

Fig. 2(b) displays the Raman spectroscopy for Zn–Co@N–C-25-Y. For Zn–Co@N–C-25 treated below 700 °C, a shoulder at 1450 cm−1 is detected. This peak probably originates from non-pyrolyzed imidazolates and results in inaccuracy in the ID/IG ratio.40,41 A similar conclusion can be obtained from the thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) characterization, which exhibits a noticeable loss in weight, with an endothermic peak at 500–700 °C (Fig. S1†). With increase in the pyrolysis temperature from 800 to 1000 °C, the peak at 1450 cm−1 vanishes, which is indicative of thorough pyrolysis of the ZIF material. Meanwhile, the ID/IG value decreases from 1.06 to 1.00, implying that the disordered carbon structure continuously transforms to a graphitic structure because of the catalytic effect of Co species at high temperature. This agrees well with the XRD measurements, which show a stronger peak at 26° at higher pyrolysis temperatures (800–1000 °C).
In addition, the textural properties of the Zn–Co@N–C-X composites were tested by N2-physisorption (Fig. S2(a–e)†). For Zn–Co@N–C-100, the specific surface area was 201 m2 g−1. With increasing Zn content, the textural properties gradually improved, and the specific surface area reaches 669 m2 g−1 for Zn–Co@N–C-0. This can be ascribed to the introduced Zn species delaying the aggregation of Co species and decreasing the graphitic carbon content. Such a result suggests that introducing Zn species could promote hierarchical porosity, which could offer plentiful catalytically active sites and favor transportation of mass and charge.
This conclusion was further confirmed by the textural properties of Zn–Co@N–C-25 treated at different temperatures (Fig. S2(f–i)†). With a temperature increase from 600 to 900 °C, the specific surface area gradually improved, owing to the pyrolysis of imidazolates, which had been probed by Raman and TG-DSC characterizations. In addition, volatilization of Zn species at high temperatures favors the formation of a porous structure. Further increasing the temperature to 1000 °C causes the metallic Co species to assemble into large particles, and the lower regular structure continuously transforms to graphitic carbon. As a result, the specific surface area reduces to 265 m2 g−1 for Zn–Co@N–C-25-1000.
SEM images (Fig. 3 and S3 and S4†) were utilized to detect the morphology and particle size of the Zn–Co@N–C composites. For Zn–Co@N–C-100, the original morphology of the ZIF material has been destroyed and obvious aggregations could be observed after treating at 800 °C. In addition, large particles with different sizes were clearly detected (the light region in Fig. 3(a)), indicating agglomeration of Co species. With increasing Zn content, it was found that the original morphology of the ZIF material could be preserved and the Co particle size became smaller, particularly for Zn–Co@N–C-25 and Zn–Co@N–C-17, where no noticeable Co particles were found. This further supports the conclusion obtained from the XRD characterization, which showed smaller Co particle size at higher Zn content in these materials. Therefore, the Co particle size could be adjusted by introducing Zn species. As for Zn–Co@N–C-25 treated at different temperatures, distinct aggregation of ZIF and Co species was clearly observed at higher temperatures, especially at 1000 °C. Therefore, the size of the Co particles becomes large after treating at high temperature.

Moreover, TEM, HRTEM and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were recorded to further investigate the morphology, crystalline structure, particle size and composition. The composites Zn–Co@N–C-100, Zn–Co@N–C-25, Zn–Co@N–C-0, Zn–Co@N–C-25-600 and Zn–Co@N–C-25-1000 were considered as typical samples. As shown in Fig. 4, large particles with different sizes were observed in Zn–Co@N–C-100. With the introduction of Zn species, Zn–Co@N–C-25 shows a porous carbon structure and small Co particles, and the size of the Co particles is distributed around 7 nm, which further confirms the conclusions obtained from XRD characterization. For the HRTEM images (Fig. 4(g)), the encapsulated structure can be verified by analysis of the lattice fringes, in which the crystal plane spacing of 0.200 nm in the core region and 0.330 nm in the shell region correspond to the (111) and (002) lattice planes of Co and graphitic carbon phases, respectively. This might be owing to catalytic graphitization of Co species, and the formation of graphitic carbon phases around the Co particles. As a result, an encapsulated structure exists in the Zn–Co@N–C composites. As for the thickness of the graphitic carbon, Zn–Co@N–C-25 shows fewer numbers (only 4–6 carbon layers) of graphitic carbon layers than Zn–Co@N–C-100 (more than 10 carbon layers), agreeing with the ID/IG values obtained from the Raman spectra. Clearly, in contrast to Zn–Co@N–C-100 and Zn–Co@N–C-25, only the porous carbon structure is observed in Zn–Co@N–C-0 (Fig. 4(i)). The absence of particles indicates that after pyrolysis the residual Zn species are highly dispersed in the skeleton of the material.

For Zn–Co@N–C-25 treated at different temperatures, only small Co particles and no graphitic carbon layers were observed in Zn–Co@N–C-25-600 (Fig. 4(j and k)). The lower temperature (600 °C) is not sufficient for formation of the graphitic carbon structure. With the temperature reaching 1000 °C (Fig. 4(m–p)), obvious aggregation of Co particles was detected, and the graphitic carbon layers around the Co particles were thicker than for the sample treated at 800 °C, implying that the higher temperature favours formation of a graphitic carbon structure.
Furthermore, the line-scanning EDS spectra (Fig. S5†) show obvious signals for Co, Zn, C and N elements, and Co particles covered by the carbon skeleton were also observed. The elemental mappings for Zn–Co@N–C-100, Zn–Co@N–C-0, Zn–Co@N–C-25-600 and Zn–Co@N–C-25-1000 are given in Fig. S6–S9.† For the Zn–Co@N–C-0 and Zn–Co@N–C-25-600 materials, all the elements (C, N, O, Co and Zn) are homogeneously distributed in the skeleton, indicating that the Co particles have small size and high dispersion. However, for the Zn–Co@N–C-100 and Zn–Co@N–C-25-1000 composites, obvious aggregation of Co species was found, further implying the existence of larger Co particles in these two samples.
Furthermore, XPS characterization was undertaken to obtain insight into the elemental composition and chemical states of the Zn–Co@N–C materials. In the full spectra (Fig. 5(a)), signals for Zn, Co, O, N and C were clearly detected, and the change in signal intensity of Co and Zn is consistent with the amount of Co introduced in the preparation process. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 5(b), Co signals at 778.6 eV are assigned to the metallic Co particles. Meanwhile, the signals at 780.8 eV are ascribed to Co species that have a lower electron density, which might result from the strong electron interaction between the Co and N species through Co–N–C bonds.42,43 In addition, with increasing Zn content, the signal for metallic Co particles decreases; however, the Co species that interact with the N species change very little. This might be a result of the Co particles becoming smaller and more firmly covered by the N–C skeleton, which has been shown by the TEM measurements.

For the Zn spectra (Fig. 5(c)), typical signals at 1021.5 and 1044.5 eV, which are ascribed to metallic Zn, were clearly detected. In addition, the intensity of the Zn signals is enhanced from Zn–Co@N–C-100 to Zn–Co@N–C-0. In the case of C species (Fig. 5(d) and S10(a)†), the peaks at 284.7 and 285.8 eV are assigned to C–C and C–N bonds, respectively.44 With rise in Zn content, the proportion of C–N bonds increases, and this might be owing to the increase in N content of these materials. In the case of O 1s (Fig. 5(e) and S10(b)†), three different peaks centered at 530.0, 531.8 and 533.2 eV, corresponding to Co–O, C–O and CO were determined.45 The Co–O bond might be owing to the surface metallic Co particles, which are partially oxidized in an air atmosphere. With increase in Zn species, the small Co particles are tightly covered by the graphitic carbon, and the surface Co particles decrease. Therefore, the Co–O bond vanishes with introduction of Zn species.
For the N spectra (Fig. 5(f and g) and Table 1), the N content increases with the introduction of Zn species. The N 1s signal can be allocated to three types of nitrogen at 398.3, 399.6 and 401.0 eV, which are assigned to pyridinic-N, M–N and graphitic-N, respectively.46 The M–N bond, in particular, is regarded as the most efficient active site for the CO2RR process.47 Of all the samples, Zn–Co@N–C-25 has the highest M–N content, owing to the existence of small Co particles that have a strong interaction with the N–C skeleton. Therefore, this catalyst is expected to have excellent electrocatalytic activity.
In addition, the XPS spectra of Zn–Co@N–C-25 treated at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 6 and S11.† It can be seen that the Zn, O and N signals gradually decrease with an increase in pyrolysis temperature from 600 to 1000 °C, and this is caused by decomposition of these species at high temperatures. For the Co signals (Fig. 6(b)), the peaks at 778.6 eV owing to the metallic Co particles, decrease with a temperature increase from 600 to 800 °C. Meanwhile, the Co–N–C bond content increases, and this can be attributed to the metallic Co particles promoting the formation of graphitic carbon. This can also be confirmed by the N spectra (Fig. 6(f and g)), in which the M–N content is enhanced with increase in temperature from 600 to 800 °C. Graphitic carbon exists around these particles, which was shown by the HRTEM images. Further increasing the temperature to 900 and 1000 °C results in a decrease in the intensity of the Co signal, which might be due to the formation of vast areas of graphitic carbon around the Co particles. Furthermore, the M–N bonds in Zn–Co@N–C-25-900 and Zn–Co@N–C-25-1000 decrease with reduction in the N content.

Inspired by their unique structure and composition, the as-obtained Zn–Co@N–C composites were used as catalysts for CO2RR. First, the LSV test under Ar or CO2 atmosphere (Fig. 7) was carried out to investigate their electrocatalytic activity towards CO2RR with an applied potential ranging from 0 to −1.0 V (vs. RHE). For the Zn–Co@N–C-25 electrode (Fig. 7(a)), the reduction current is significantly enhanced from −0.4 V as the electrolyte is saturated by CO2 and the onset potential is lower than that attributed solely to the hydrogen evolution reaction in an Ar atmosphere. In addition, the cathodic current is clearly enhanced when CO2 is taken into the electrolyte. For instance, there exists a larger current (4.0 mA cm−2) under CO2 atmosphere than under Ar atmosphere (1.5 mA cm−2) at −0.57 V, which is indicative of superior electrocatalytic activity towards CO2RR. Furthermore, Zn–Co@N–C composites with different Zn contents were also investigated under a CO2 atmosphere. As displayed in Fig. 7(b), Zn–Co@N–C-100 and Zn–Co@N–C-50 electrodes exhibited similar LSV curves, implying close catalytic performance in the CO2RR. For the Zn–Co@N–C-25 electrode, the lower onset potential and higher current density suggested improvement in catalytic performance. Further increase in the Zn content results in a decrease in catalytic activity. The influence of pyrolysis temperature was also investigated, as shown in Fig. 7(c). With the temperature increasing from 600 to 800 °C, the catalytic performance improved, and Zn–Co@N–C-25-800 exhibits the lowest onset potential and highest current density, thus implying excellent catalytic performance. However, further enhancing the temperature, to 900 and 1000 °C, results in a reduction in the activity of the catalyst.

The electrocatalytic performance of the Zn–Co@N–C composite was further investigated by detecting the products obtained in the CO2RR. In the reaction process, CO and H2 were detected and no obvious liquid products were confirmed. In addition, the electric current curves and FE% of CO and H2 were investigated under −0.57 V. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the electric current of Zn–Co@N–C-100 and Zn–Co@N–C-50 is about 1.5 mA cm−2. For Zn–Co@N–C-25 and Zn–Co@N–C-17, the electric current is enhanced and reaches 4 mA cm−2, which implies that the catalytic performance was successfully improved with introduction of Zn species. This is owing to the decrease in small Co particles, which are tightly covered by graphitic carbon layers, and the electron transformation being successfully improved. For the Zn–Co@N–C-0 composite, the electric current is only 0.25 mA cm−2, showing that Co species are essential for enhancement of the electric current. In addition, the FE% of CO and H2 were also studied. For Zn–Co@N–C-100 and Zn–Co@N–C-50 composites, the FE(CO)% is about 25% and the principal product is H2. With increase in Zn species, the FE(CO)% was successfully enhanced and Zn–Co@N–C-25 shows the highest FE(CO)% (60%). This improved catalytic performance might be attributed to the decrease in Co particles, which causes an increase in Co–N–C bonds and specific surface area, thus providing more accessible active sites for the CO2 molecules. In consequence, the decrease in Co particle size favors the improvement in catalytic performance. In contrast, the sample without introduced Co species (Zn–Co@N–C-0), which has a large specific surface area (669 m2 g−1), only shows a low FE(CO)% (20%). Therefore, the Co species are necessary, and the Co–N–C bonds might be the active site for the CO2RR.
 Fig. 8  The catalytic performance of (a) Zn–Co@N–C-X with different Co content values and (b) Zn–Co@N–C-25-Y at different pyrolysis temperatures. 
The influence of pyrolysis temperature on catalytic performance was investigated and is shown in Fig. 8(b). With an increase in temperature from 600 to 800 °C, the electric current (from 0.4 to 4.2 mA) and FE(CO)% (from 15% to 60%) were successfully improved, owing to formation of the graphitic carbon structure around the Co particles and the existence of abundant Co–N–C bonds, further confirming the conclusions above. When the temperature reaches 900 and 1000 °C, the Co particles aggregate and the large Co particles are closely packed by the thick graphitic carbon structure. This does not favor the transfer of electrons to CO2, and so the electric current decreases. In addition, the M–N bonds in these two samples decrease with reducing N content, and hence the FE(CO)% changes from 60% to 30%. For all the catalysts, the ratio of H2/CO in the products could be regulated in the range of 5:1 to 1:1.5 by changes in the Co/Zn ratio and pyrolysis temperature.
To gain further insights into the differences in catalytic performance, electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was calculated to evaluate the ECSA and investigate potential influencing factors. As given in Fig. S12,† Zn–Co@N–C-25 and Zn–Co@N–C-17 exhibit the largest Cdl values (11.5 mF cm−2 and 10.48 mF cm−2) compared with Zn–Co@N–C-100 (3.69 mF cm−2), Zn–Co@N–C-50 (4.8 mF cm−2) and Zn–Co@N–C-0 (3.06 mF cm−2), and could contribute more active sites in the electrocatalyst. Therefore, the catalytic performance in the CO2RR is improved. This change is consistent with the catalytic performance discussed above, in which Zn–Co@N–C-25 and Zn–Co@N–C-17 show higher electric current and FE(CO)%. In addition, the higher ECSA of these two samples might be a result of the decrease in Co particle size and increase in Co–N–C bonds and specific surface area, which can be adjusted successfully using the introduced Zn species. For Zn–Co@N–C-25 treated at different temperatures (Fig. S13†), Zn–Co@N–C-25-800 provides the largest Cdl value (11.5 mF cm−2), further supporting the conclusions from Fig. 7(c) and 8(b). Therefore, the Zn–Co@N–C-25-800 composite is an excellent catalyst for CO2RR.
To explore the reaction process of CO2RR, Tafel plots for all the Zn–Co@N–C composites under different overpotentials were measured. As shown in Fig. 9, all the Tafel slopes are close to 118 mV dec−1, implying that the rate-determining step in the CO2RR reaction is the first electron transfer to CO2.29,30,47 The lowest Tafel slope (106 mV dec−1) for Zn–Co@N–C-25 implies the least resistance to transfer of the electron, thus enhancing the catalytic performance. The change law for the Tafel slope is consistent with the LSV curves and current density curves under different potentials. Therefore, we deduce that the Zn–Co@N–C catalyst with small Co particles, which has high Co–N–C bonds, a high graphitic carbon structure and a high specific surface area, is beneficial for electron transfer and, as a consequence, the catalytic performance is improved.

The catalytic activity of Zn–Co@N–C materials under different potentials was examined and is shown in Fig. 10(a) and S14.† For the Zn–Co@N–C-25 catalyst, with the applied potential increasing from −0.37 to −0.77 V, the current gradually increases from 0.4 to 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, the influence of potential on FE(CO)% was also tested. As the applied potential increased from −0.37 to −0.57 V, the FE(CO)% improved from 10% to 60%. Further raising the potential, to −0.67 and −0.77 V, results in a decline in FE(CO)% to 42% and 20%, respectively. Moreover, the catalytic performance for all the Zn–Co@N–C materials with different potentials was investigated and the results are shown in Fig. S14.† As a result, −0.57 V is the preferred potential for the CO2RR reaction here. As an important aspect for practical applications, the stability of Zn–Co@N–C-25 was also studied. As displayed in Fig. 10(b), the long-term (40 h) performance of Zn–Co@N–C-25 was tested under −0.57 V. No obvious decrease in current density and FE(CO)% were observed, implying significant electrochemical stability for Zn–Co@N–C-25 in the CO2RR. In addition, SEM images, elemental mapping and Raman spectra (Fig. S15–S18†) of the electrode (Zn–Co@N–C-25/carbon paper) before and after reaction were recorded to investigate the changes during the reaction process. No detectable difference was found in the electrode, further implying the excellent stability of the Zn–Co@N–C-25 catalyst.

4. Conclusions
In this study we have developed a series of Zn–Co@N–C composites, and the Co particle size in these materials was successfully adjusted via controlling the Co/Zn ratios and pyrolysis temperatures. In addition, the existing states of the different components in the materials were investigated. For the catalytic performance in the CO2RR, the current density and FE(CO)% values of Zn–Co@N–C gradually improved with a decrease in the Co particle size (from 25% to 60% for FE(CO)% and from 1.8 to 4.2 mA cm−2 for current density). Benefiting from the regulation of the Co particle size, the graphitic carbon layer, the Co–N–C bonds and the improved specific surface area, the Zn–Co@N–C-25 catalyst displayed the optimal catalytic performance. In addition, the ratio of H2/CO in the syngas obtained could be regulated in the range of 5:1 to 1:1.5. Moreover, no obvious decrease in current density and FE(CO)% were observed after 40 h, demonstrating the electrochemical stability of this Zn–Co@N–C catalyst, which is therefore a promising catalyst for the CO2RR.
