    , Accepted 24th January 2020First published on 27th January 2020AbstractPoly(1,2,3-triazolium)s are a versatile class of poly(ionic liquid)s that take advantage of the functional tolerance, orthogonal robustness and efficiency of the copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We use this reaction to design an all-in-one monomer gathering polymerization, crosslinking and ion-conducting functionalities in a single small molecule. A diepoxy 1,2,3-triazolium (DET) ionic liquid monomer is synthetized by CuAAC ligation between alkyne- and azide-functionalized epoxies, followed by N-alkylation of the central 1,2,3-triazole group by N-methyl bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. Advantageously, this monomer is a low viscosity liquid which can therefore be implemented by casting. As a mode of curing, we chose cationic homopolymerization in bulk to obtain readily a network without dilution by a comonomer or release of byproducts. Two cross-linked epoxy networks were thereby obtained (i) from DET and (ii) from a commercial poly(ethylene glycol)diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE, Mn = 500 g mol−1), taken as a neutral reference monomer, using benzylamine trifluoroborate as cationic initiator. The polymerization kinetics and the structure/property correlations of the resulting ionic and neutral epoxy networks are discussed based on differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and swelling/extractible measurements, as well as thermomechanical properties obtained by torsional rheometry and ionic conductivity measured by broadband dielectric spectroscopy. Although the ionic epoxy network exhibits a lower cross-link density (i.e. higher swelling ratio and lower storage modulus in the rubber state) than the neutral network due to the more pronounced occurrence of transfer and termination reactions, this work demonstrates that cationic ROP is a suitable route to produce a network solely from 1,2,3 triazolium functionalized diepoxy monomer. Besides, comparable levels of ionic conductivity were obtained for the neutral and 1,2,3-triazolium-based epoxy networks (i.e. σDC = 0.5 × 10−6 and 1 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 30 °C and under anhydrous conditions, respectively).
Introduction
Poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) gather the appealing properties of ILs (e.g. tunable solubility, thermal and (electro)chemical stabilities, ionic conductivity, etc.) and polymers (e.g. versatile processing, adhesion, film-forming capacities and tunable thermomechanical properties through macromolecular design, etc.).1–4 A broad range of PILs can be assembled by either polymerization of IL monomers (ILMs) or post-polymerization chemical modification of neutral polymers using a large array of cations (e.g. ammonium, pyrrolidinium, imidazolium, phosphonium, triazolium, etc.), anions (e.g. halides, inorganic fluorides, perfluorinated sulfonimides, etc.), and microstructures (e.g. block copolymers, (hyper)branched polymers, colloids, nanostructured coatings, and networks, etc.).5–8 PILs with broad chemical variety (e.g. styrenics, (meth)acrylates, vinyl esters, vinyl-imidazoliums, polyesters, polyimides, polyurethanes, etc.) have been obtained through different chain-growth or step-growth polymerization methods. Shortly after their introduction in 2013, 1,2,3-triazolium-based PILs (TPILs) have been established as a structurally rich family of PILs with performances reaching those of the best PILs developped so far.3 Up to now, different combinations of step growth or chain growth polymerization methods with the functional tolerance of CuAAC, and the quantitative nature of the N-alkylation of 1,2,3-triazoles and ion exchange reactions have afforded a broad array of tailored TPILs, e.g. linear and hyperbranched ionenes,9,10 poly(meth)acrylates,11,12 polystyrenes,13 poly(vinyl ester)s,14 poly(4-vinyl-1,2,3-triazolium)s,15 poly(ethylene glycol)s,16 poly(aryl ether)s,17 polyurethanes,18 polypeptoids,19 or polysiloxanes.20
Numerous reports have already demonstrated the potential of PILs in applications including catalysis,21,22 dye-sensitized solar cells,23 electrochromic devices,24,25 gas separation membranes,26,27 antimicrobial surfaces,28 sensors and actuators,29,30 electrolyte-gated transistors,31 fuel cells,32 as well as devices for energy storage such as batteries or super-capacitors.33–36 Most of these applications rely on PILs having enhanced ion conducting properties generally in the form of highly viscous liquids. Several strategies have been explored to yield mechanically stable PIL-based solid electrolytes. A convenient approach involves the dispersion of molecular ILs within thermoplastic or thermosetting matrices.27,32,37 However, the synthesis of chemically cross-linked PILs having one of the ionic moieties covalently attached to the polymer network are of particular interest since they prevent phase separation upon aging and afford enhanced mechanical properties. Typical examples of the most common synthetic pathways to achieve the synthesis of PIL networks include the chain-growth polymerization of difunctional ILMs,38 the chain-growth copolymerization of an ILM with either a neutral or an IL difunctional monomer,39 the step-growth polymerization of a difunctional ILM with a multifunctional neutral monomer (e.g. epoxy amine polyaddition, etc.),40 as well as the post-polymerization chemical cross-linking of multifunctional PIL intermediates.41
Herein, we explore the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of a synthetic diepoxy 1,2,3-triazolium (DET) ILM as a new approach to provide cross-linked solid polymer electrolytes. We detail (i) the synthesis of DET ILM; (ii) the comparison of the performances of two anionic and two cationic initiators for the ROP of DET using DSC and FTIR; (iii) the measurement of the activation energy of the systems by DSC, the investigation of polymerization kinetics using FTIR and DSC, and the evolution of the glass transition temperature with conversion for DET and a neutral diepoxy monomer (PEGDGE) by DSC; (iv) the gelation behavior of both epoxy systems by rheology and DSC experiments; and (v) the investigation of structure/properties correlations by TGA, DSC, swelling experiments, torsional rheometry and broadband dielectric spectroscopy for both types of epoxy networks.
Experimental section
Materials
Sodium hydride (NaH, 90%), epichlorohydrin (99.5%), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA, 99%), iodo(triethyl phosphite)copper(I) (CuP(OEt)3I, 97%), N-methyl bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (4, CH3TFSI, 90%), methylimidazole (1-MI, 99%), 2-phenylimidazole (2-PI, 98%) and poly(ethylene glycol)diglycidyl ether (6, PEGDGE, Mn = 500 g mol−1) were purchased from Merck and used as it is. 2-(2-(2-(Prop-2-ynyloxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol,42 2-(2-(2-(2-azido-ethoxy)-ethoxy)-ethoxymethyl)-oxirane 1,43 4-chloroaniline trifluoroborate (4CA-BF3),44 and benzylamine trifluoroborate (BzA-BF3),45 were synthesized as described previously.
Characterization methods

Nuclear magnetic resonance. 

1H (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) NMR spectroscopy was carried out using a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer in CDCl3 using residual hydrogenated solvent peak as reference (δ7.26). Abbreviations for peak multiplicity are s for singlet, d for doublet, dd for doublet of doublet, t for triplet and m for multiplet.


Thermal characterizations. 
DSC was carried out using a DSC Q200 (TA Instrument) calibrated with an indium standard. The samples were prepared using hermetic pans and the experiments were conducted under a helium purge of 25 mL min−1 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments). Samples of ca. 8 mg of epoxy networks 7 or 8 were heated from 20 to 600 °C at 10 °C min−1 under a helium purge of 60 mL min−1.


DSC monitoring of the curing process. 
Initially, several DSC capsules containing ca. 5 mg of reactive mixture of diepoxy monomers 5 or 6 with BzA-BF3 (0.075 mol EE−1) were sealed off under ambient conditions. A heating ramp was applied from −100 to 200 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to obtain the initial glass transition temperature (Tg0), the initial differential heat capacity (ΔCp0) and the total enthalpy of reaction (ΔH∞). A subsequent dynamic scan from −100 to 200 °C at 10 °C min−1 was performed to assess the final glass transition temperature (Tg∞) and the final differential heat capacity (ΔCp∞) of the resulting network. Tg values were taken as the midpoint of the heat capacity change. Tg0, Tg, ΔCp0 and ΔCp∞ values are average values obtained from 5 different runs. In addition, several capsules were heated in an oven at 130 °C for reaction times between 10 and 350 min. The capsules were then quenched in liquid nitrogen and directly analyzed by DSC to obtain Tg(t) of the formed epoxy network and residual enthalpy of reaction, ΔH(t). The conversion of reactive groups (x) at a given time t is given by eqn (1): (1)


IR monitoring of the curing process. 
Isothermal curing of epoxy monomers were performed using a Bruker-Tensor 37 IR spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm−1 coupled with a thermally controlled SPECAC Goldengate ATR accessory. A mixture of DET 5 or PEGDGE 6 with BzA-BF3 (0.075 mol EE−1) were placed on the ATR diamond in the center of a Teflon seal covered with a metallic lid held in place by pressure, resulting in a leak-proof cavity presenting very good atmosphere tightness. Transmitted I(ν) and incident I0(ν) beam energies were converted into a spectrum in absorbance A using the ATR correction: A(ν) = −(ν/1000) × log[I(ν)/I0(ν)] where ν is the wavenumber in cm−1. The disappearance of the absorption peak at 914 cm−1 (epoxy bending) was monitored to determine the conversion of epoxy groups (αepoxy) using eqn (2): (2)with A0914 and At914 the absorbance of epoxy groups before and after curing for a reaction time t, respectively.


Water content measurement by Karl-Fischer titration. 
Titration of water content in diepoxy monomers 5 and 6 was carried out by Karl-Fischer method on a 917 Coulometer apparatus from Metrohm. This apparatus is associated to an oven 860 KF Thermoprep where 50 mg of monomers 5 or 6 are melted at 160 °C.


Rheology monitoring of the curing process. 
Reactive mixtures of diepoxy monomers 5 or 6 (3.00 g, 3.90 mmol of 5 or 6.00 mmol of 6) with BzA-BF3 (0.075 mol EE−1) were deposited at 130 °C in the gap of an Anton Paar Physica MCR 501 rheometer equipped with 50 mm diameter disposable parallel plates. G′ and G′′ data were collected every 20 s for a frequency of 1 rad s−1 and an amplitude of 5%. Gel time (tgel) was taken as the crossing time of G′ and G′′.


Broadband dielectric spectroscopy. 
In order to investigate the ionic conductivity of epoxy networks 7 and 8, Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS) has been employed. The measurements have been carried out using a high resolution Alpha-Analyzer (Novocontrol GmbH). The temperature control has been realized under flow of pure nitrogen gas, employing a Quatro temperature controller. The presence of oxygen and moisture in the measurement chamber was thus excluded. The thermal stability was better than 0.1 K, with relative variations less than 0.2 K min−1. A solution of 200 mg of DET 5 or PEGDGE 6 with BzA-BF3 (0.075 mol EE−1) in acetone (0.5 mL) was deposited onto a platinum electrode (3 cm in diameter) and the solvent was slowly evaporated for ca. 1 h under ambient conditions. In order to evaporate the solvent and reach the equilibrium of properties for the samples under investigation, a thermal annealing under vacuum of 10 h at 110 °C, and then 3 h at 130 °C has been carried out. After the thermal treatment, a second platinum electrode (2 cm in diameter) was placed on top of the sample to build up a measurement cell as a parallel plate capacitor. A further annealing under nitrogen during 3 h at 110 °C was performed in the cryostat of the dielectric spectrometer and the evolution of the electrical and dielectric properties was continuously monitored until a steady state equilibrium was reached. After this equilibration procedure, the ionic conductivity measurements were started by measuring the complex conductivity function which is defined as: σ*(ω,T) = σ′(ω,T) + iσ′′(ω,T)(3)
The conductivity measurements were carried out from 10 MHz to 0.1 Hz under isothermal conditions from 110 to −50 °C in temperature steps of 10 °C. The applied voltage was 0.1 V, in order to exclude any possible non-linear effects. After completing the measurements, the sample was re-measured at several reference temperatures to validate that the experimental results were stable and reproducible.


Swelling experiments. 
Epoxy networks were immersed in acetone at room temperature for 48 h. The swollen mass was obtained by measuring the weight after immersion. The samples were then dried under vacuum at 50 °C until a stable dry weight was reached. The swelling ratio (S) and the amount of extractibles (X) were calculated using eqn (4) and (5): (4) (5)with m0, mwet, and mdry the initial mass, the swollen mass and the mass after drying of the networks, respectively.


Thermomechanical properties. 
Temperature sweep experiments were performed on a strain-controlled ARES G2 rheometer (TA instruments) using rectangular samples (20 × 5 × 2 mm3) in torsion mode at a frequency of 1 Hz in the linear viscoelastic domain. The applied heating rate was 3 °C min−1 for temperatures ranging from −80 to 100 °C.

NaH (2.37 g, 98.8 mmol) was added in small portions to a solution of 2-(2-(2-(prop-2-ynyloxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol (7.43 g, 39.5 mmol) in anhydrous THF (150 mL) maintained at 0 °C under argon. The mixture was brought to room temperature and stirred for 45 min before adding epichlorohydrin (7.7 mL, 99 mmol) and further stirring under argon for 18 h. After neutralization of residual NaH by ethanol (20 mL), water (50 mL) was added and THF was evaporated under reduced pressure. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 150 mL).

The solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with a 3:2 mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate to afford after evaporation of the solvents 3 as a slightly yellow liquid (4.57 g, 55.4%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ 7.69 (1H, s, Hg), 4.60 (2H, s, Hi), 4.47 (2H, t, J = 5.2 Hz, Hf), 3.81 (2H, t, J = 5.2 Hz, He), 3.76–3.68 (2H, m, Hc, Hk), 3.67–3.47 (20H, m, Hd, Hj), 3.39–3.27 (2H, m, Hc′, Hk′), 3.13–3.03 (2H, m, Hb, Hl), 2.77–2.67 (2H, m, Ha, Hm), 2.57–2.47 (2H, m, Ha′, Hm′). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz): δ 144.68 (1C, Ch), 123.61 (1C, Cg), 71.76 (2C, Cc, Ck), 70.83–70.22 (10C, Cd, Cj), 67.41 (1C, Ce), 64.36 (1C, Ci), 50.58 (2C, Cb, Cl), 49.99 (1C, Cf), 43.96 (2C, Ca, Cm).

General procedure for the preparation of epoxy networks

Synthesis of 7. 
Diepoxy 1,2,3-triazolium 5 (5.00 g, 6.49 mmol) and BzA-BF3 (0.17 g, 0.97 mmol, 0.075 mol EE−1) were dissolved in acetone (5 mL). Acetone was then evaporated under reduced pressure for 6 h at room temperature. The resulting homogeneous mixture was introduced in 5.1 × 2.3 × 1.3 cm3 silicone molds and was sequentially cured under vacuum for 2 h at 100 °C, 8 h at 130 °C and 1 h at 150 °C to ensure complete conversion of the monomer and to afford ca. 2 mm thick ionic epoxy network 7 as a flexible brown solid. The same procedure was applied for the preparation of neutral epoxy network 8 using PEGDGE 6 (5.06 g, 10.1 mmol), BzA-BF3 (263 mg, 1.50 mmol, 0.075 mol EE−1) and acetone (5 mL).

Results and discussion
Synthesis of diepoxy 1,2,3-triazolium 5
In order to achieve the synthesis of ionic epoxy networks by ROP we have developed a novel multistep synthetic strategy affording a diepoxy-functionalized ILM having a central 1,2,3-triazolium cation, a TFSI counter-anion and two terminal epoxy groups (Scheme 1). Compared to previously reported diepoxy-functionalized 1,2,3-triazolium ILM that contained ester linkages and aliphatic spacers at the N-1 and C-4 positions,46 DET 5 contains ether linkages and longer triethylene glycol-based spacers separating the terminal epoxy moieties from the central 1,2,3-triazolium group. Azide-functionalized epoxide 1 was synthesized in two-steps by azidation of 2-(2-(2-chloro-ethoxy)-ethoxy)-ethanol and subsequent O-alkylation of the resulting azido-alcohol with epichlorohydrin.42 Alkyne-functionalized epoxide 2 was synthetized by O-alkylation of 2-(2-(2-(prop-2-ynyloxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol with epichlorohydrin. Complementary epoxy-functionalized azide 1 and alkyne 2 were then coupled by CuAAC to afford after purification by column chromatography diepoxy 1,2,3-triazole (DET) 3 in 55% yield. Finally, N-alkylation at the N-3 position of the 1,2,3-triazole group of 3 using CH3TFSI 4 afforded DET 5 in quantitative yield, after evaporation of the solvent and excess CH3TFSI 4. The purity of compounds 2, 3 and 5 was demonstrated by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S6 in the ESI†) and by electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectroscopy (ESI-HRMS). However, DSC monitoring of the curing of crude DET 5 (Fig. S7 in the ESI†) shows an exotherm starting at 160 °C most likely corresponding to the polymerization of epoxy groups initiated by traces of an unidentified inorganic impurity coming from CH3TFSI 4, a commercial reagent with 90% purity, that could not be detected by the employed analytical methods. Nevertheless, DET 5 was finally purified by column chromatography, a method rarely used for the purification of ILs or ILMs, eluting with a 4:1 ethyl acetate/methanol mixture. After purification, DSC monitoring of purified DET 5 does not show any sign of reactivity up to 250 °C (Fig. S7 in the ESI†).

Investigation of different initiators for the ring opening polymerization of DET 5
Epoxy monomers have gathered a lot of interest since their commercial introduction in 1947 as they rely on a unique versatile chemistry involving non-volatile intermediates, a wide range of curing temperatures, and low shrinkage during curing.47 Epoxy networks exhibit a large range of properties suited for various applications such as composites, paints and varnishes, photoresists for microelectronics, and more recently 3D-printing.48 Difunctional epoxy monomers can yield cross-linked networks either by step-growth polymerizations with comonomers such as diamines or by catalytic chain-growth ring opening polymerization or copolymerization with cyclic anhydrides. Although there has been a significant amount of work regarding the preparation of PIL-based cross-linked solid electrolytes by step-growth copolymerization of epoxy or diepoxy ILMs using the epoxy-amine reaction,46,49–51 to the best of our knowledge neither the cationic nor the anionic ROPs of diepoxy ILMs have been investigated so far. The chain-growth ROP of diepoxy monomers can be mediated by anionic or cationic initiators52 such as imidazoles,53 Lewis acids such as BF3 complexes,44,45,54,55 or onium salts.56,57
Herein, we have initially investigated the ability of classical anionic and cationic initiators (Scheme S1 in the ESI†) to promote the ROP of DET 5 by DSC monitoring of the total reaction enthalpy (ΔH∞). Although being classical anionic initiators for the ROP of diepoxy monomers,53 1-methyl imidazole (1-MI) and 2-phenyl imidazole (2-PI) are not suited for the ROP of DET 5. Indeed, for both anionic initiators at a content of 0.075 mol EE−1 ΔH∞ is below ca. 10 kJ EE−1 (Fig. S8 in the ESI†) while values of ca. 100 kJ EE−1 are generally observed for the anionic ROP of classical diepoxy monomers.58 Besides, even after 15 h of curing at 135 °C the resulting materials can be dissolved in acetone attesting the poor efficiency of the anionic initiation for the ROP of DET 5 and the insufficient cross-link density of the resulting materials. This poor initiation observed for imidazole initiators might result from the trans-N-alkylation reaction between 1,2,3-triazoliums and imidazoles which has been previously demonstrated to be reversible for 1,2,3-triazoliums while it is irreversible in the case of the resulting imidazoliums.59
Cationic ROP of DET 5 was then investigated using two classical cationic initiators for the ROP of diepoxy monomers, i.e. 4-chloroaniline trifluoroborate (4CA-BF3),54 and benzylamine trifluoroborate (BzA-BF3).45 DSC monitoring (Fig. S8 in the ESI†) shows that both initiators exhibit comparable reaction enthalpies (ΔH∞ = 88 and 91 kJ EE−1 for 4CA-BF3 and BzA-BF3, respectively) thus confirming comparable and quantitative conversion of epoxy groups. However, while 4CA-BF3 starts initiating the ROP of DET 5 near room temperature (onset temperature = 30 °C) which could complicate the handling and storage of reactive mixtures, BzA-BF3 initiates the ROP at higher temperature (onset temperature = 85 °C) making it an ideal initiating system. Therefore, BzA-BF3 (0.075 mol EE−1) was chosen as cationic initiator for the further detailed study of the ROP of DET 5 (Scheme 2). Besides, the cationic ROP of PEGDGE 6 (Mn = 500 g mol−1, Xn ∼ 8, Đ = 1.46), a commercially available neutral diepoxy monomer having both a molar mass and a number of ethylene glycol units comparable to the cationic moiety of DET 5, was also investigated for comparison.

The activation energies (Ea) of the ROP of DET 5 and PEGDGE 6 initiated by BzA-BF3 (0.075 mol EE−1) were determined using the Kissinger method,60 which is based on the assumption that the exothermic peak coincides with the maximum reaction rate as described by eqn (6): (6)with ϕ the heating rate, Tp the peak of the exothermal reaction and R the ideal gas constant. Ea and the frequency factors (k0) of both reactive systems were obtained respectively from the slope and the origin of the linear relation of ln(ϕ/Tp2) as a function of Tp−1 (Fig. 1c). DSC scans performed from 25 to 250 °C at heating rates ranging from 5 to 20 °C min−1 exhibit very close activation energies for the ROP of epoxy monomers 5 and 6 (Ea = 87 and 85 kJ mol−1 respectively).

Kinetics of the ring opening polymerization of diepoxy monomers 5 and 6
The ROP of DET 5 and PEGDGE 6 initiated by BzA-BF3 (0.075 mol EE−1) were initially compared by DSC monitoring. Typically, a first heating scan of the reactive mixtures was performed from −100 to 250 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to determine Tg0, ΔCp0 and ΔH∞ of each reactive system (Fig. 2 and Table 1). DET 5 is amorphous with a Tg of −59 °C while PEGDGE 6 is semi-crystalline with a glass transition (Tg = −71 °C), a cold crystallization transition (Tc = −53 °C) and a melting transition (Tm = −3 °C). Subsequently, initiation and propagation of the cationic ROP of DET 5 starts at ca. 85 °C and ends at ca. 230 °C while the peak of the exothermal reaction (Tp) is observed at 181 °C (for a heating rate of 10 °C min−1). In the case of PEGDGE 6 ROP starts at ca. 85 °C and ends at ca. 200 °C while Tp is located at 163 °C. Comparable Tp values have been reported previously for the thermal curing of neutral diepoxy monomers initiated by BzA-BF3.45 Then, a second heating run from −100 to 250 °C of the cured sample afforded the final glass transition temperature (Tg∞) and final differential heat capacity (ΔCp∞) after full conversion of the reactive groups as confirmed by the disappearance of the exotherm corresponding to the ROP of epoxy groups. The enthalpies of reaction per equivalent epoxy are very close for the two epoxy monomers (ΔH∞ = 91 and 89 kJ EE−1 for 5 and 6, respectively) and on par with other reactive systems such as epoxies, cyanate-esters or bismaleimides for which ΔH∞ is generally close to 90 kJ EE−1.54

The kinetics of the cationic ROP of DET 5 and PEGDGE 6 initiated by BzA-BF3 (0.075 mol EE−1) at 130 °C were then investigated by analyzing samples after different curing times by DSC (Fig. 2) and by on-line FTIR monitoring of the decay of the absorption band of epoxy groups at 914 cm−1 during the curing (see e.g. Fig. S9 in the ESI† for DET 5). The conversion of epoxy groups (x) calculated using eqn (1) for DSC and eqn (2) for FTIR was plotted as a function of time (t) in Fig. 3. It is worth noting that a good agreement can be seen for kinetics results obtained using both monitoring methods. Complete conversions of epoxy groups were reached for curing times of ca. 300 min for DET 5 and 60 min for PEGDGE 6. The ROP of DET 5 is thus significantly slower than the ROP of the neutral analogue PEGDGE 6. As both systems show comparable activation energies, this difference most likely results from a probable ion exchange reaction. As previously pointed out,61 initiation by an amine-BF3 complex should proceed through decomposition of the latter into an ammonium tetrafluoroborate salt, which is in turn able to release the truly initiating species, i.e. the HBF4 super-acid (Scheme 3). A plausible ion exchange reaction between benzyl ammonium BF4 and 1,2,3-triazolium TFSI might enter in competition with the generation of HBF4 and as a result might explain the slowing down of the ROP kinetics.

Monitoring of the network formation during the ROP of diepoxy monomers 5 and 6
The evolution of Tg(t) as a function of x was monitored after an isothermal curing for a given time and subsequent DSC monitoring during a heating ramp from −100 °C to 200 °C to obtain Tg(t) and ΔH(t) (Fig. 4). The evolution of Tg as a function of x is described by eqn (7):47 (7)with Tg(t) the glass transition temperature of the polymerization media after a curing time t (or a conversion x) and λ = ΔCp∞/ΔCp0 (Table 1). Generally, λ < 1 for thermosetting polymers due to the inverse proportionality of ΔCp with Tg.62 As previously observed for other cross-linking reactions described for the synthesis of classical thermosetting polymers there is a fair agreement between experimental and theoretical evolutions of Tg(t) with the conversion of epoxy groups for the ROP of DET 5 and PEGDGE 6 (Fig. 4).47 The high values of λ (0.847 and 0.804 for 5 and 6) are representative of the low variation of Tg during the thermal curing which increases during the course of the ROP by 27 and 21 °C, respectively.

The gelation behavior during the formation of epoxy networks 7 and 8 was investigated by rheological measurements. The gelation times (tgel) at 130 °C during the cationic ROP of DET 5 and PEGDGE 6 at 130 °C initiated by BzA-BF3 (0.075 mol EE−1) were estimated by the crossover of G′ and G′′ for a frequency of 1 rad s−1 (Fig. 5). The conversions at the gel point (xgel) were then calculated from the DSC measurements of the residual reaction enthalpy ΔH(t) for samples quenched in liquid nitrogen after an isothermal curing at 130 °C for t = tgel and using eqn (1). The ROP of DET 5 exhibits higher tgel and xgel (xgel = 83%, tgel = 4480 s) than PEGDGE 6 (xgel = 72%, tgel = 1020 s). Typically for DGEBA homopolymerization, xgel ranges from 5% to 20% when the activated chain end (ACE) mechanism is dominant i.e. whenever the cationic ROP is performed in absence of hydroxyl groups. Higher values (25 to 45%) are observed when the activated monomer (AM) mechanism is dominant, i.e. when hydroxides, other protic additives or impurities (water) are present.45,52,54 The high xgel values recorded here strongly suggest that the polymerization mechanism involves a significant amount of transfer and termination reactions. This most likely results from the presence of water traces (0.5 and 1.4 wt% representing 0.1 and 0.2 mol EE−1 for DET 5 and PEGDGE 6, respectively) as measured by Karl-Fischer method. Besides the elevated curing temperature used herein, proton donating species such as water are known to provide transfer and termination reactions during cationic ROP. Moreover, it has been shown that the introduction of PEGDGE afforded a significant increase of tgel and xgel for the ROP of DGEBA initiated by 4CA-BF3 (i.e. xgel increases from 7% to 16% and tgel increases from 2 to 13 min when 0.06 mol EE−1 of PEGDGE are added to DGEBA).44 This can be explained by the ability of the PEG ether groups to form complexes with the initiator thus decreasing its efficiency. However as this phenomenon seems to be more important for the polymerization of DET 5 while its water content is ca. a third than for PEGDGE 6, the previously mentioned ion metathesis reaction (Scheme 3) must have also an impact on the initiator efficiency and on the occurrence of transfer and termination reactions.

Physical and thermomechanical properties of epoxy networks 7 and 8
Based on polymerization kinetics studies, epoxy networks 7 and 8 were prepared in bulk by the cationic ROP of DET 5 and PEGDGE 6 initiated by BzA-BF3 (0.075 mol EE−1) carried out in silicone molds (V = 5.1 × 2.3 × 1.3 cm3) and sequential curing under vacuum for 2 h at 100 °C, 8 h at 130 °C and 1 h at 150 °C. Thermal stability of epoxy networks 7 and 8 was first investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S10 in the ESI†). Neutral epoxy network 8 exhibits a higher 10% weight loss temperature (Td10) compared to ionic epoxy network 7 (Td10 = 330 and 305 °C, respectively). It is worth noting that while 1,2,3-triazolium units are often the weakest part regarding thermal stability of TPILs, Td10 of 7 is only slightly lower than 8. Td10 of 7 corresponds to the upper range of values previously reported for TFSI-containing TPILs (Td10 ranges from 203 to 371 °C),3 while it is comparable to 1,2,3-triazolium-based epoxy-amine network (Td10 = 308 °C).46 Measurements of the swelling ratio (S) and amount of extractibles (X) is an easy and convenient method to qualitatively compare the structure and cross-link density of polymer networks (Table 2). Such measurements performed in acetone have shown that ionic epoxy network 7 swells significantly more than neutral epoxy network 8 (S = 9.0 and 2.7, respectively) and therefore the amount of extractibles of ionic epoxy network 7 is logically higher than the one of neutral epoxy network 8 (X = 32.7% and 16.6%, respectively). 1H NMR of dried extractibles shows the presence of mainly branched structures without any residual epoxy groups (Fig. S11 in the ESI†). These results corroborate earlier observations on the conversion at the gel point and further demonstrate that, due to the enhanced occurrence of transfer and termination reactions 7 has a lower cross-link density than 8.

The thermomechanical properties of epoxy networks 7 and 8 were investigated by rheological temperature sweeps in torsion mode (Fig. 6 and Table 2). For both epoxy networks the alpha transition temperature (Tα) chosen as the maximum of the loss factor (tan(δ)) is 13 °C higher than Tg determined by DSC. However, ionic epoxy network 7 exhibits a significantly broader peak of tan(δ) ranging from −50 °C to 30 °C than neutral epoxy network 8 which ranges from −60 °C to 0 °C. This can be explained by the plasticizing effect of the different quantities of low molar mass species contained in the extractibles of epoxy networks 7 and 8. Besides, ionic epoxy network 7 exhibits a lower value of elastic modulus at the rubbery plateau than neutral epoxy network 8 (E′ = 0.12 and 0.75 MPa at 100 °C, respectively). In perfect agreement with previous results (i.e. higher xgel, S and X values), these observations corroborate the structure difference between epoxy networks 7 and 8, with a more loosely cross-linked network structure for epoxy network 7 which contains more structural defects such as dangling chains and branched species with finite molar masses.

Ion conducting properties of epoxy networks 7 and 8
The anhydrous ionic conductivity of epoxy networks 7 and 8 has been investigated as a function of temperature by BDS. The DC-conductivity (σDC) was determined by the value of the plateau observed in the frequency dependence of σ′ (Fig. S12 in the ESI†). Above Tg the dependence of σDC on the inverse temperature follows a typical Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT) behavior (Fig. 7a) for all our samples. The experimental results were thus fitted with the VFT eqn (8): (8)with σ∞ the ionic conductivity in the high temperature limit, B the fitting parameter related to the activation energy of the ionic conduction, and T0 the Vogel temperature.

The solid lines represent the best VFT fits of experimental data using eqn (8) with σ∞ = 0.12 S cm−1, B = 1035 K, T0 = 211 K for 7 and σ∞ = 8.4 × 10−4 S cm−1, B = 795 K, T0 = 196 K for 8. σDCversus reciprocal temperature normalized by Tg values measured by BDS (bottom) for epoxy networks 7 (open squares) and 8 (solid triangles). 
The ionic conductivity at 30 °C under anhydrous conditions of ionic epoxy network 7 (σDC = 1.3 × 10−6 S cm−1) is higher than neutral epoxy network 8 (σDC = 4.6 × 10−7 S cm−1) and is above the values previously reported for 1,2,3-triazolium-based networks with comparable Tg values (anhydrous σDC at 30 °C ranging from 2.2 × 10−11 to 1.0 × 10−6 S cm−1).3,40,47,63,64 The conductivity difference is even higher at high temperatures as a result of the higher B parameter for 7. The higher ionic conductivity of 7 may result from the high solubility, dissociation of ion pairs, and mobility of the TFSI counter-anion promoted by the low Tg flexible segments of the polymer network as well as the presence of numerous ether functionalities. Besides, the lower cross-link density and the presence of charged macromolecular species of finite size resulting from transfer reactions (i.e. extractibles) may also enhance the mobility of charge carriers and contribute to the higher ionic conductivity of epoxy network 7. However, anhydrous ionic conductivity of epoxy network 8 is surprisingly high for a neutral polymer material and the higher ionic conductivity of 8 compared to 7 below room temperature is even more intriguing. This might be due to the lower Tg of the neutral epoxy network 8 compared to ionic epoxy network 7. However, normalizing the temperature evolution of the ionic conductivity by the Tg values (Fig. 7b) still leads to a significantly higher ionic conductivity for 7. This difference cannot be therefore solely attributed to a higher ionic mobility induced by a faster molecular dynamics underlying the decrease in Tg. Since ionic conductivity is generally equal to qnμ (with q the electrical charge, n the number density of ionic charges and μ their mobility), a possible contribution arising from an increase in the number density of ionic species should be considered as well. This can originate from the presence of charged species resulting from the dismutation/hydrolysis of the Lewis acid initiator (Scheme 3) with n ∼ 1.9 × 10−4 mol cm−3. Although being lower than the number density of 1,2,3-triazolium TFSI ion pairs (n ∼ 1.3 × 10−3 mol cm−3) the much higher mobility of molecular species issued from the initiator might also significantly contribute to the ionic conductivity of epoxy network 7. This is due to the fact that, as opposed to DSC that is additive and measures all (macro)molecular species present in the volume of the sample, the dominant response in BDS is correlated to the product between the number density and mobility of the charged species.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we reported an original and straightforward synthetic pathway towards monocomponent cross-linked ion conducting networks. In contrast to previous reports based on diepoxy ILMs and diamine hardeners,46,50,51 we showed here that the bulk cationic ring opening homopolymerization of a liquid diepoxy 1,2,3-triazolium ILM (i.e. DET 5) readily affords PIL networks without using a comonomer which fatally dilutes the ionic species. The cationic ROP of DET 5 was investigated using a high pKa amine/trifluoroborate complex (i.e. BzA-BF3) initiator and compared to the ROP of a neutral analogue (i.e. PEGDGE 6) to understand the impact of the ionic moiety on polymerization kinetics as well as on physical and thermomechanical properties of the resulting epoxy networks. The study of the thermal curing behavior of these two monomers and the physical properties of the corresponding networks suggest that the ionic center affects the mechanism of polymerization and the structure of the network. Although PEGDGE 6 water uptake is higher than that of DET 5, the ROP of the ionic system is slower than the neutral system. Besides, it seems that the 1,2,3-triazolium TFSI ion pairs might interact with the initiating species (i.e. benzyl ammonium BF4) thus reducing its efficiency and favoring the occurrence of transfer and termination reactions. These observations are in good agreement with swelling, extractibles and thermomechanical measurements. Indeed, higher swelling ratios, amounts of extractibles and conversions at the gel point together with a broader tan(δ) peak are observed for ionic epoxy network 7 indicating a less cross-linked network structure with more structural defects (i.e. dangling chains and branched species with finite molar masses) than for neutral epoxy network 8. Nevertheless, the ionic system reaches quantitative conversion of epoxy groups and the corresponding network exhibit good thermal stability (Td10 = 304 °C) as well as remarkably high anhydrous ionic conductivity (σDC = 1.3 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 30 °C) for a cross-linked PIL. The assets of the resulting materials in combination with the desirable attributes of the cationic ROP process (i.e. prevention of hydroxide formation, a source of spurious protonic conduction and deleterious reactions with common electrolyte salts based on LiPF6,65 absence of network shrinkage and self-powered process by the exothermicity of the reaction) makes the proposed methodology of great interest for the conception of ion conducting polymer networks. Finally, the fact that cross-linked polymer electrolytes obtained from cationic ROP of neutral commercial precursors can reach levels of ionic conductivity comparable to those of PIL networks that generally require additional synthetic steps is another major finding of this study. It allows one to address a broad range of possible applications in the field of polymer electrolytes, by a simpler, less time consuming, more environmentally friendly approach that offers in the same time the potential of being more easily implementable at larger scales.
