1. Introduction
The realization of peculiar photodetectors play a major role as building blocks in providing solutions for emerging problems in the research field of optoelectronics.1–5 The basic prerequisites of photodetectors (PDs) have been well described in a few pioneering studies based on their knowledge at that period of time which could be revealed established on the Olympic principles of Citius, Altius and Fortius corresponding to the photodetector principles of faster, more sensitive and smarter, respectively.6 The term was proposed by G. van Aller and S.-O. Flyckt of Philips Laboratories in the year 1983.7 Photodetectors are significant optoelectronic devices that help in the conversion of light to electricity by means of the photoelectric effect.8 Photodetectors can be broadly classified as photoconductors and photodiodes.9 Photoconductors account for the conductivity change in materials that are placed between two electrodes. Photodiodes deal with the behaviour dependence in p–n or Schottky junctions under illumination of light.2,10 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of photodiodes is usually less than 1 attributed to the insufficient absorption of light and carrier recombination. Moreover, they have fast response caused by the electrons and holes associated with the photocurrent generation which recombine once they reach their own electrodes leading to a short carrier lifetime. In the case of a photoconductor, only one type of carrier is responsible for photocurrent while another one is trapped in the photoconductor.9 Photodetectors may find widespread applications in detection (radiation, smoke, flame, missile plume), engine monitoring, switching relays for street lights, atomic force microscopy, laser based devices (laser guided missiles, laser warning, security systems, laser range finders, alignment and control systems), communication (optical free-air, light-wave, intersatellite), spectral analysis in the medical field, chemical/biological sensors, sensors in space applications (solar, star), missile launch, spectral monitoring of earth's ozone layer and automotive anti-collision optical radar.11–22 Owing to the photoconductive properties of semiconducting materials, they form the basic element of the photodetector.5,23
Nanostructures can be broadly classified into different categories such as zero-dimensional (quantum dots), one-dimensional (nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, nanobelts, nanoribbons) and two-dimensional (nanosheets, monolayers, ultra-thin films). Due to the quantum confinement effect and dimensionality dependence, semiconducting nanostructures were found to exhibit unique size-dependent physical properties that vary significantly with respect to the corresponding bulk materials.24,25 The difference in dimensionality leads to diverse bandgap energies of nanocrystals attributed to the confinement in various dimensionalities and the bandgap structure is an important factor for quantitative modification by controlling the size, dimensionality and composition.26–29 The optical and electrical properties vary with the size of semiconductor nanocrystals having the same interior bonding geometry. This is caused by the systematic transformations in the density of electronic energy levels with a function of the size, otherwise called as quantum size effects.24,30 Photodetectors fabricated from one-dimensional (1D) structures display high sensitivity and high quantum efficiency in contrast to their bulk analogues by virtue of their increased surface-to-volume ratio, and Debye length comparable to their small size and reduced dimensionality.31–36 On the other hand, the increase in surface-to-volume ratio is significant in designing miniaturized portable devices and also provides greater advantage of detection sites for sensing. With the launching of considerable gap states in large bandgap 1D nanostructures, the photoresponse spectral region can be significantly broadened and this could be an alternative to overcome the disadvantage of 1D based PDs of a large bandgap operating under light with a narrow spectral range.15,32,37 The bandgap of the nanomaterials' strongly depends on their sizes (smaller than few nanometres comparable to Bohr radius) and it allows the spectral tunability within a single material system, making the way for multispectral photodetectors that are sensitive in the visible, near-infrared (NIR) and ultraviolet (UV).2 Moreover, this can also extend the photoactive region towards the visible or even infrared region. It thereby incomparably enhances the performance of optoelectronic devices and photocatalysts.38–41 The photocarrier lifetime can be further enhanced, which is attributed to the charge separation and migration developed by surface states.42,43 The reduced dimensionality significantly plays a leading role in the confinement of the active area of charge carriers leading to a shorter transit time.35
An interesting fact is that these 2D nanostructures can be more compatible with the current thin film micro-manufacturing techniques along with their easy fabrication into complex structures in contrast to quantum dots and other 1D materials (nanowires, nanorods and carbon nanotubes).44 These nanostructures could be assembled in the fabrication of photodetectors owing to their dimensionality, compact size, ease of manipulation, precise crystal structures, rationally designed surface and peculiar 1D enclosing surfaces.16,23,45 Furthermore, the response speed of photodetectors is influenced by the size of nanoribbons.46 In the year 2001, Wang and co-workers47 first reported nanobelts as 1D structurally controlled nanomaterials with well-defined chemical composition, crystallography and enclosing surfaces. The nanobelts/nanoribbons have been adopted in the fabrication of nanometer-scale multiband light sensors due to their large surface area exposed to light.46,48–53 The electronic and optoelectronic device performances are improved because nanobelts can be nearly void of dislocations and line defects. Single crystalline nanobelts with specific oriented surfaces having a rectangular cross section, uniform thickness, and ribbon (belt)-like morphology make them suitable for the development of miniaturized device applications and fabrication of nanoscale functional devices.54 The individual nanobelts have been demonstrated to inherit interesting optoelectronic properties.55
Compared to the photodetectors fabricated from bulk or thin film counterparts, some novel properties and characteristics such as a strong polarization dependence and a better photoresponse of ultra-thin two dimensional (2D) nanostructures have drawn much attention.44,46 Hence, this review is concentrated on nanosheets (NS), nanobelts (NB) and nanoribbons (NR) with the two main aspects of different wavelength ranges and the materials adopted for the demonstration of the device structures. The intention of this review is to supplement detailed knowledge of broadband, ultraviolet, visible and infrared photodetectors based on two-dimensional materials and nanostructures in the form of nanobelts, nanoribbons and nanosheets. The first part of this article presents the important parameters of photodetectors. The next part deals with different spectra of photodetectors based on the above-mentioned nanostructures with some peculiarities. Various types of photodetectors will simultaneously be described. Finally, the outlook and challenges section will discuss the current challenges photodetectors are now facing in terms of material selection, functionality and fabrication that has to be taken into account for future advancement necessary for further development in the field of fabrication and processing of photodetectors of 2D nanostructures. It is anticipated that this review can provide an overview and evaluation of state-of-the-art broadband photodetectors based on nanobelts, nanoribbons, nanosheets and the emerging two-dimensional material.
2. Important parameters of photodetectors
Device mechanisms: the significant characteristics of the desired high-performance photodetectors in practical applications include high photosensitivity, high stability, high spectral selectivity, fast response speed, high gain and small device size.56–58
Photocurrent (ΔI) is defined as, ΔI = Ip − Id(1)where Ip, and Id represent the current at a bias voltage of 0.1 V in the dark and under light illumination, respectively.
The quantitative and qualitative performances of photodetectors are determined by two significant parameters, namely spectra responsivity (Rλ) and external quantum efficiency (EQE). The spectra responsivity, also called current responsivity, is defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power of incident light on the effective area of a photodetector. The external quantum efficiency is the number of electrons detected per incident photon.
The large values of Rλ and EQE suggest high sensitivity for photodetectors and are expressed as follows:23,59 Rλ = ΔIλ/(PλS)(2) EQE = hcRλ/eλ(3)in which ΔIλ is the photocurrent induced by the incident light of wavelength (λ), Pλ is the light intensity, S is the effective illuminated area, h, c, and e represent the Plank constant, velocity of light and charge of electrons, respectively. The major parameters involved in the photodetection mechanism of nanostructured (NS/NB/NR) photodetectors in a wide-range of the electromagnetic spectrum from previous reports are tabulated in Table 1.

Wu et al.60 described three main optoelectronic processes in semiconductor nanostructured photodetectors. They are (1) the photodoping effect: resulting from the upliftment of the quasi-Fermi level of the carriers originated by photogenerated excess carriers thereby causing an increase in conductivity;46,59,61 (2) the photoconductance effect: arising from band bending achieved by a surface electric field at the surface of the nanostructures;14,62,63 and (3) the photogating effect: trapping of photogenerated excess minority carriers that would extend the photocarrier lifetime.15,46,61
3. Different spectra of photodetectors
Graphene (G) with its unique optical, electrical, magnetic, optical and mechanical properties is a booming research area mostly reported in recent years.64–68 Graphene is an interesting candidate for optoelectronic devices with stimulating properties of high response speed, broad spectral detection width, wavelength independent absorption and high carrier mobility.69–74 An unfavourable condition is that its gapless nature causes low responsivity and low photoconductive gain which could be a major problem in photoconductors.4,75,76 The limitation of graphene arises from its zero bandgap which causes a serious issue in different applications such as photodetectors or photoswitching microdevices as they demand definite ON and OFF states.64,77,78 The demerits of graphene-based photodetectors are low responsivity (∼10−2 A W−1), low external quantum efficiency (0.1–0.2%) and lack of spectral selectivity.79,80 Researchers have suggested that the integration of graphene with other 2D materials to form a van der Waals heterostructure might be a fascinating process to overcome the above-mentioned issues. In view of this, photodetectors based on MoS2–graphene, the WSe2–graphene heterojunction, and the graphene–Bi2Te3 heterostructure have achieved enhanced performance with high responsivity.81–84 Therefore, 2D materials came into the picture to add flavours to the photodetectors and hybrid photodetectors based on graphene/2D materials that have turned into a contemporary leader in photodetectors. We will review in detail the photodetectors fabricated from nanobelts, nanoribbons and nanosheets operating in different spectral ranges of incident light in the electromagnetic spectrum.
3.1. Broadband photodetectors
The two dimensional material-based photodetectors are found to have demonstrated the ability to detect light over a broad spectral range with a few limitations related to polarization sensitivity. The small and direct bandgap of black phosphorus (BP) makes it appealing for broadband photodetection in which transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are limited owing to their large bandgap.86–89 Bulk BP shows high carrier mobility (∼10000 cm2 V−1 s−1) and a ∼0.3 eV direct bandgap whereas its bandgap increases with the decrease in thickness and is predicted to exhibit a direct bandgap of >1 eV in its monolayer form.90–92 The layered BP crystal with a rectangular in-plane lattice exhibits a highly-anisotropic structure along the two perpendicular x and y directions in which every two rows of P atoms form an “armchair”-like geometry by preferably puckering up and down only along the x direction.93 Gomez et al.94 reported that transmission electron microscopy measurements confirm the crystallinity and stability of the exfoliated freely suspended flakes. This is due to the fact that the electrons and photons in BP behave in a highly anisotropic manner within the layer plane.93,95–97 Moreover, the orthorhombic layered structure together with a layer-dependent direct bandgap from monolayer to bulk also favours BP in photo-detection. BP is an excellent candidate for incorporating intrinsic crystal anisotropy in polarization-sensitive photo-detection compared to that of conventional photodetectors available for linear dichroism detection relying on extrinsic geometric effects.98–102 It is interesting to compare layered BP having a highly-anisotropic structure with a rectangular in-plane lattice with other 2D materials such as graphene and molybdenum sulphide (MoS2) having a hexagonal in-plane lattice that are insensitive to the linear polarization of incident light.98
BP transistors showed a response to excitation wavelengths from the visible to 940 nm with a rise time of about 1 ms and their suitability for broadband and fast detection was therefore understood.86 It was demonstrated that a gate tunable p–n diode based on a p-type BP/n-type monolayer MoS2 van der Waals p–n heterojunction is a promising material for broadband photodetection and solar energy harvesting. Fig. 1(a–c) show the schematics of the device formed using a p+ silicon wafer capped with 285 nm SiO2 acting as a global back gate and the gate dielectric is also clearly depicted. A van der Waals heterojunction was designed with a few tens of layered BP flakes exfoliated onto monolayer MoS2 and Ni/Au were later deposited to serve as contacts. The electrical measurements were conducted by applying a voltage Vd across the device and bias voltage Vg was applied to the back gate.

(d, e) Reproduced from ref. 148. 
Linear-dichroic broadband photodetectors with layered BP transistors as seen in Fig. 2(a–c) are reported by employing the strong intrinsic linear dichroism originating from the in-plane optical anisotropy with respect to the atom-buckled direction and this device is polarization sensitive over a broad bandwidth from 400 nm to 3750 nm.98 Linear dichroism probes different absorption of light polarized parallel or perpendicular to an orientation axis which directly depends on both the conformation and orientation whether the device material/device is intrinsically oriented in an anisotropic crystal structure or extrinsically oriented in anisotropic patterns.12,100,103 The important aspect is that the perpendicular built-in electric field induced by gating in black phosphorus transistors could spatially separate the photo-generated electrons and holes in the channel thereby reducing their recombination rate with enhancement of efficiency and performance for linear dichroism photo-detection. A polarization-sensitive broadband photodetector using a black phosphorus vertical p–n junction has also been recently reported.99

(g–i) Reproduced from ref. 90. 
The photoresponse of field-effect transistors (FETs) made up of a few tens of layered BP (3–8 nm thick) as a function of excitation wavelength, power and frequency was studied by Buscema et al.86Fig. 2(d–f) depict the optical image, device schematics and photocurrent behaviour of a few tens of layered BP FETs. The optical image, photocurrent mapping and photodetection responsivity of the BP/MoS2 heterojunction is given in Fig. 2(g–i). It showed a maximum photodetection responsivity of 418 mA W−1 (633 nm wavelength) and photovoltaic energy conversion with an external quantum efficiency of 0.3%.90 The samples used in their study have thicknesses of the few tens of layered black phosphorus flake and monolayer MoS2 as ∼11 nm and ∼0.9 nm, respectively. The increase in the back gate voltage resulted in a considerable increase in photocurrent and this is caused by the reduction of the MoS2 sheet resistance and the MoS2/metal contact resistance. The photoresponsivity of these devices is nearly 100 times higher than that of the recently reported black phosphorus phototransistor and 4.8 times more than the carbon nanotube-MoS2 p–n diode for a smaller voltage applied across the diode.86,104
Owing to the exotic properties of 2D nanostructured materials of high surface-to-volume ratio and reduced dimensionality, they became potential candidates in nanophotonic device components. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), an intrinsic n-type II–VI semiconductor with a wide bandgap (∼3.2 eV), finds application in organic electronics as efficient anode interfacial layers attributed to its high work function.32 Among the metal oxide nanostructures, Xiang et al.32 reported photodetectors based on MoO3 nanobelts irrespective of their low conductivity and weak photoresponsivity85 which was enhanced by the introduction of substantial gap states by means of H2 annealing. Their goal was to enhance the conductance significantly with enrichment of gap states in MoO3 by annealing in order to attain an excellent photoresponse in the wide visible spectral region. Fig. 3(a–c) show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and a schematic illustration of the device for photocurrent measurement along with the time dependent photoresponse before and after annealing under 660 nm laser illumination.

MoS2 is a semiconductor having a bandgap ranging from 1.2 eV to 1.8 eV as the thickness decreases from bulk to monolayer in which the bandgap depends on the number of layers.105–107 Being a direct bandgap semiconductor which shows high absorption coefficient and electron–hole pair generation rate during photoexcitation, monolayer MoS2 finds application in optoelectronic device circuits, light sensing, biomedical imaging, video recording and spectroscopy.107–111 Field effect transistors based on monolayer or multilayer MoS2 possess high current ON/OFF ratios of up to 107–108.112,113 A MoS2 photodetector with a poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) ferroelectric layer instead of the oxide layer in a traditional field effect transistor was realized as seen in Fig. 3(d–f). The ferroelectric polarization suppressed the dark current of the photodetector.114 Interestingly, the bandgap of few-layer MoS2 could be altered by the ultra-high electrostatic field from the ferroelectric polarization. Therefore, photoresponse wavelengths of the photodetector were broadened into the near infrared (0.85–1.55 μm). They suggested that the ferroelectric/optoelectronic hybrid structures would be an effective way to accomplish high performance 2D electronic/optoelectronic devices.
The semiconducting material tin disulfide (SnS2) with a direct band gap of ∼2.2 eV has a layered CdI2-type structure where the tin atoms are positioned between two hexagonal close-packed sulfur slabs to form a three-atom sandwich structure (S–Sn–S triple layer) so that it can be exfoliated to form two-dimensional crystals.116 Sn and S are bound by a strong covalent force within each triple layer and triple layers are bound by van der Waals interactions.117,118 Recently, a new flexible and rigid broadband photodetector based on SnS2 nanosheet self-assembled microsphere films was devised onto a transparent polypropylene film using double-side adhesive tape.119 The reported detector demonstrated an excellent photoresponse in the region of 300 to 830 nm with an outstanding photo-switching effect and stability. It was found that both the flexible and rigid photodetectors had the same photosensitive properties and photosensitive mechanism.
Bi2Te3 belongs to the topological insulator family with a similar hexagonal symmetry to that of graphene. The graphene–Bi2Te3 photodetector had shown enhanced photoresponsivity (35 A W−1 at a wavelength of 532 nm) and sensitivity (photoconductive gain up to 83) with respect to pure graphene based devices. The resultant device exhibited increased photocurrent attributed to the effective photocarrier generation and transfer at the interface between graphene and Bi2Te3.84 The SEM image of Bi2Te3 nanoplatelets on graphene, and a schematic of the fabricated photodetector device and photocurrent as a function of gate voltage are given in Fig. 3(g–i). It is also reported that the wavelength limit could be extended to the near-infrared (980 nm) and telecommunication band (1550 nm). Feng et al.115 realized ultrahigh photoresponsivity (∼104 A W−1) and detectivity (∼1012 to 1013 Jones) that can be adjusted using an applied gate voltage in multilayer indium selenide (InSe) nanosheet phototransistors with a broadband response from UV to near infrared wavelengths. Fig. 3(j–l) shows the schematic drawing of an InSe nanosheet phototransistor, a schematic of the photon absorption of the InSe multilayer and the band diagram of the InSe nanosheet phototransistor. It was reported that multiple reflection interference at the interfaces of the device leads to a thickness-dependent photo-response.
3.2. Ultraviolet photodetectors
The monitoring of UV rays is demanding due to the major health issue of skin cancer caused by the radiation coming to the earth. The bandgap of zinc sulphide (ZnS) is 3.72 and 3.77 eV for cubic zinc blend and hexagonal wurtzite forms respectively. The potential of ZnS as a UV detector in this specific wavelength regime is higher in comparison with the available substitute materials such as indirect band-gap diamonds (∼5.5 eV) and direct bandgap semiconductor zinc oxide, ZnO (∼3.4 eV).120–122 The photoresponsivity of ZnS-nanobelt-based UV-light sensors was found to have over three orders of magnitude gain under UV-light illumination compared to that of visible light.49Fig. 4(a–c) show the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of ZnS nanobelts (inset: the SEM image of a single-crystalline ZnS-nanobelt device), and a schematic diagram of the device and the time response upon 320 nm light illumination with and without UV light, respectively. The high spectral selectivity, high photosensitivity and fast response time (<0.3 s) make the single-crystalline ZnS nanobelts attractive for new “visible-light-blind” UV-light photodetectors, particularly in the UV-A region. A UV nano-photodetector based on chloride doped zinc sulphide (Cl:ZnS) nanoribbon/Au Schottky junctions with a photoresponsivity of 9.1 A W−1 was also reported.123

Due to the low electrical performances of UV photodetectors fabricated from solely inorganic semiconductors, the blooming research area namely hybridization was employed recently to improve the photocurrent thereby eliminating the above-mentioned limitations. The high electrical conductivity, enhanced mechanical flexibility, impermeability (to standard gases),124–126 and transparency of graphene make it interesting to be incorporated into photoactive semiconductors for the enhancement of light absorption and carrier transportation.127 Studies based on the hybrid structures of graphene and semiconductors showed improved UV photo-detection with few limitations of small area of effective-junction region attributing to the photocurrent.128–130 Kim et al.127 realized solution-grown ZnS nanobelts and chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown graphene based high-performance hybrid structured UV photodetectors of both sandwiched and multilayer stacked structures with excellent spectral selectivity and stable ON–OFF switching. They have used three different UV photodetectors under ambient conditions at a low bias voltage: (i) ZnS spin-coated on the surface of double-layer graphene, (ii) ZnS sandwiched between two graphene layers (S-G/ZnS) and (iii) multiple sandwiched graphene and ZnS (MS-G/ZnS). Interestingly, the photo-response behaviour of a photodetector was influenced by both the number of layers and the stacking sequence of graphene and ZnS. In comparison with the previously reported UV photodetectors based on ZnS nanobelts49 and ZnS–ZnO nanowires131 without graphene, optimized photodetectors based on S-G/ZnS exhibited photocurrent (37 μA) that is 106 times greater than the reported values. Fig. 4(d–f) show the TEM image of S-G/ZnS nanobelts, a schematic diagram of the device and the energy level diagram of S-G/ZnS heterojunctions presenting a charge-transfer process under UV-light illumination, respectively. The MS-G/ZnS photodetector showed a photocurrent of 0.115 mA which is 107 times higher than that of a graphene-free UV photodetector based on ZnS nanobelts.49 The photodetection mechanism of these devices was explained based on the spontaneous charge transfer of photoexcited electrons in the conduction band of ZnS to graphene channels.127
ZnS/ZnO biaxial nanobelts having diameters in the range of a few tens of nm to 100 nm and lengths up to tens of μm have been exploited for UV-A photodetectors.36 They had high spectral selectivity and a wide-range photoresponse and were found to be much better than pure ZnS or ZnO nanostructures. The mismatch stress between the ZnS and ZnO lattices causes the bending of ZnS/ZnO biaxial nanobelt.132 Hu et al.36 reported an interesting mechanism of photodetection in the ZnS/ZnO biaxial nanobelt. The SEM image of ZnS/ZnO nanobelts (inset: high-resolution SEM image) and the device structure are given in Fig. 4(g and h). Interestingly, the illumination of light leads to the electron–hole pair generation and the internal field at the ZnS/ZnO interface makes the electrons move towards the ZnO and holes move towards the ZnS. It forms a charge transfer state and spatial separation of photogenerated carriers within the nanobelts which in turn decreases the electron–hole pair recombination thereby increasing the photocurrent and EQE, see Fig. 4(i). The high photocurrent might be attributed to the Cr/Au electrodes and good Ohmic contact without any interfacial barrier or traps between the ZnS/ZnO nanobelt. A self-powered ultraviolet photodetector based on a single antimony doped zinc oxide (Sb:ZnO) nanobelt bridging an Ohmic contact and a Schottky contact was demonstrated with high photoresponse sensitivity (2200%) and response time (<100 ms).133 They have found degradation in the performance of their device with the decrease in the concentration of antimony-doping in the ZnO nanobelt. In this case, the energy of the photons from UV is higher than the bandgap of ZnO causing the NB to create the photo-generation of electron–hole pairs.
Gallium sulphide (GaS) is a member of the III–VI group where the interlayer interactions are dictated by the weak van der Waals forces and interlayer-bonding forces are covalent in nature. It has an indirect band gap of 2.59 eV at 300 K, a direct band gap at ∼3.05 eV and therefore used in near-blue light emitting devices. Highly crystalline, exfoliated GaS nanosheet based photodetectors were demonstrated on both mechanically rigid and flexible substrates.44 The SEM image of the above-mentioned GaS NS, and illustration of the device structure and photocurrent as a function of time are given in Fig. 5(a–c). The photoresponsivity of GaS NS on SiO2/Si substrates and on polyethylene terephthalate at 254 nm yielded up to 4.2 A W−1 and 19.2 A W−1 (with external quantum yields up to 9374%), respectively which is higher than that of the pristine graphene photodetector (1 × 10−3 A W−1 with an external quantum yield of 6–16%).4,44 It was evident from theoretical modelling that the decrease in the sheet thickness of GaS NS caused by the reduction of effective mass at the valence band maximum increases the carrier mobility leading to high photocurrent.44 Yang et al.45 reported a few-layer GaS two-terminal photodetector with a fast and stable response showing different photo-responses in diverse gas environments (refer Fig. 5(d–f)). The photo responsivity and external quantum efficiency are found to be higher in ammonia rather than in air or oxygen. The charge transfer between the adsorbed gas molecules and the photodetector resulted in different photo-responses. The photo-response of the above-mentioned GaS NS based device (64.43 A W−1)45 was found to be higher than the pure monolayer graphene photodetector (8.61 A W−1)76 and graphene nanoribbons (1 A W−1).134

Gallium selenide (GaSe) is a layered material belonging to the TMDC family which comprises of vertically stacked Se–Ga–Ga–Se sheets held together by weak forces such as van der Waals forces along with some ionic or Coulomb contributions.135 This p-type semiconductor material has an indirect bandgap of 2.11 eV which is very close to the direct bandgap.136 In this case, thermal vibration at room temperature is enough for the transfer of electrons between direct and indirect band edges because of the small difference (25 MeV). Single- and few-layer GaSe 2D ultrathin nanosheets obtained from mechanical cleavage and solvent exfoliation methods were employed for fabricating photodetectors.79 They showed a fast response of 0.02 s, a high responsivity of 2.8 A W−1 and a high external quantum efficiency of 1367% at 254 nm. As the wavelength of light decreased from 610 to 254 nm, a significant increase in photocurrent was observed particularly when the device is illuminated with short-wavelength light. Fig. 5(g–i) depict the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of few-layer GaSe flakes on a silicon substrate with a 300 nm thick oxide layer, a schematic of GaSe photodetectors and photocurrent as a function of time at a bias voltage of 1 V, respectively.
Zinc selenide (ZnSe) being a II–VI compound semiconductor having a direct bandgap of ∼2.70 eV (∼460 nm) at room temperature (RT) is a widely used material in optoelectronic devices.50,137 It is more sensitive to blue/UV light compared to silicon and gallium arsenide. 1D ZnSe nanostructures were limited by their high dark currents or poor stabilities which impose challenges in fabricating efficient photodetectors with high-performance characteristics of reproducible photocurrent, high photocurrent/dark-current ratio and fast response time.138 In this scenario, Fang et al.50 reported ultra-long, easily tuned/manipulated ZnSe nanobelts for the fabrication of blue/UV-light-sensitive photodetectors (λ < 460 nm) with ultralow dark current, a high photocurrent immediate decay ratio (>99%) and a fast time response (<0.3 s). The decrease in dark current is attributed to the perfect crystallinity of the chemically pure ZnSe structures. The typical SEM image of ZnSe nanostructures showing belt-like morphology with a nanobelt thickness of ∼40 nm, schematic illustration of the single ZnSe nanobelt fabricated as a photodetector and the I–V characteristics of the device illuminated with 400 nm wavelength light and under dark conditions can be well understood from Fig. 5(j–l).
Niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) belongs to transition metal oxides family with eminent applications in different fields such as field-emission displays, catalysis, electrochemistry and microelectronic devices. It can also be employed in the fabrication of optoelectronic circuit based devices (UV-A band of 320–400 nm) and visible blind VU light sensors ascribed to its bandgap of 3.4 eV.139 Fang et al.52 reported a nanoscale photodetector fabricated from an individual Nb2O5 nanobelt of 100–500 nm wide and 2–10 μm long. The cross-sectional SEM image of Nb2O5 NB arrays, a schematic diagram of a single Nb2O5-nanobelt device and the photocurrent–time plot can be seen in Fig. 6(d–f). The detector showed high UV-A light sensitivity, high external quantum-efficiency and excellent photocurrent stability of more than 2500 s. These UV photodetectors have excellent optoelectronic properties confirming their applicability as visible-blind UV-light sensors and optoelectronic circuits particularly operating in the UV-A range. UV photodetectors fabricated on single Nb2O5 nanoplates showed excellent sensitivity, high external quantum efficiency, robust stability, steady photocurrent dependence on light intensity and wavelength selectivity with respect to UV-A light.140Fig. 6(a–c) show the SEM image, pictorial representation of the Nb2O5 nanoplate photodetector and time-dependent responses of the photodetector upon illumination of the 320 nm light measured using the mechanical chopping method, respectively.

UV photodetectors based on WO3, HfS3, InSe and In2Ge2O7 are also joining the race of photo-detection. WO3 belongs to TMDC transition metal oxides having a bandgap of ∼3.3 eV with high chemical and thermal stability most suitable for UV photodetector application.141–143 Few-layer WO3 nanosheet based UV photodetectors144 showed high-performance with a faster photoresponse and higher EQE compared to that of previously reported WO3 nanowires142,143 and nanospheres.141 Recently, HfS3 nanobelts of 700–70 nm width, 10–30 nm thickness and 10 μm length with direct and indirect optical energy gaps of 2.19 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively are devised as flexible photodetectors.145 These devices have proven to have an exceptional photoresponse from ultraviolet to visible light. The solar-blind photodetectors based on individual single-crystalline In2Ge2O7 nanobelts as sensing elements exhibited a sensitive spectral response and high quantum efficiency.146Fig. 6(g–i) show the SEM image of In2Ge2O7 nanobelts, a schematic of the NB device and the time response of an In2Ge2O7-nanobelt photodetector, respectively. The orthorhombic layered structure together with a layer-dependent direct bandgap from monolayer to bulk favors BP for photodetection. More recently, Wu et al.147 reported the optoelectronics characteristics of high-quality, few-layer BP-based colossal UV photodetectors. Scanning measurement using AFM across the channel area of the device showed the thickness of BP flakes as ∼4.5 nm as seen in Fig. 6(j). The three dimensional (3D) view of the BP photo-FET device structure to measure the photoresponse and the photoresponsivity of the BP device for the combination of the fast and slow response of photocurrent with excitation of 390 nm light source at the same applied back gate is given in Fig. 6(k and l). UV photoresponsivity (∼9 × 104 A W−1) was achieved and it is the highest ever measured in any 2D materials until now with 107 times more compared to previous research on BP.86,90,98,99,148 The resulting colossal UV photoresponsivity was ascribed to the resonant-interband transition between two specially nested valence and conduction bands. They have concluded that these nested bands yield unusually high density of states for highly efficient UV absorption because of their singularity nature.
3.3. Visible photodetectors
Cadmium sulphide (CdS) is considered to be a promising material for visible photodetectors with a bandgap of ∼2.4 eV.23,46,149,150 It is challenging to fabricate a high-performance photodetector with fast response time, good reproducibility and high quantum efficiency by overcoming low quantum efficiencies and slow response speeds so that the practical demands could be met.46,149,151,152 Li et al.23 reported Ohmic contact-based single CdS NB photodetectors with ultrahigh responsivity and fast response time. The high-resolution SEM image of CdS NB shows that the belt-like structures have a flat surface with a uniform belt thickness of ∼200 nm as seen in Fig. 7(a). Fig. 7(b and c) report the schematics of the CdS-NB photodetector and reproducible ON/OFF switching (rise and decay times were ∼20 μs) upon 490 nm light illumination. Jie et al.46 reported the photoconductive characteristics of CdS NRs whose SEM morphology is given in Fig. 7(g). From Fig. 7(e), we can better understand the I–V curves illuminated with light of different wavelengths where the insets show the optical microscopy image of the single-NR device (left) and the schematic diagram of the configuration for photoconductive measurements (right). The time response of CdS NR to the pulsed incidence light (490 nm) power density of 13.4 kW cm−2 is depicted in Fig. 7(f). The systematic study of spectral response, light intensity response and time response in single CdS NRs reported a fast response speed where the size of NRs played a significant role. In addition, the smaller sized (width and thickness) CdS NRs showed higher response speed. Furthermore, large surface-to-volume ratio, high single-crystal quality of CdS NRs and the reduction of the recombination barrier are responsible for the high photosensitivity and high photoresponse speed.46 CdS NBs have a noticeable increase in the conductance with a response time of 1–3 s.149 Hence, it has the potential of realizing nano-photoconductors and optical switches by incorporating these NBs. The high sensitivity and quick response in the visible range of single CdS NBs were contributed by fast recombination and trapping in which the surface traps also influenced the photoresponse.153 It was revealed that the high photoconductance, the short rise time and decay time of CdS NRs are significant for their use in photo-detection.152

Single CdS NB metal–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET) based photodetectors were reported with the novel advantage of an additional dimensionality in controlling the channel conduction.154Fig. 7(d–f) show the field emission SEM (FESEM) image, schematic illustration of an individual CdS NB MESFET based photodetector and the ON/OFF photocurrent response of CdS NB without Schottky contact as a function of time. In view of this, the dark current is greatly reduced thereby increasing the photoresponse so that it can overcome the disadvantage of a conventional two-terminal photodetector. Hence, the overall performance of the photodetector can be enhanced by the realization of MESFET based CdS NB photodetectors. Rare earth (RE) doping can serve as effective luminescent centers attributed to the recombination of the photogenerated carriers confined in semiconductors and subsequent energy transfer to RE ions leading to the excitation of charge carriers in RE ions and this finds application in multicolor photodetectors.155 Dedong et al.156 reported Er3+-doped CdS nanoribbon (Er:CdS NR) based photodetectors with the ability of detecting multicolor light like blue, red, and near-infrared light with higher responsivity and external quantum efficiency. Fig. 8(a–c) shows the SEM image of a single Er:CdS NR at high magnification, schematic of the detector configuration and I–V curves of the Er:CdS NR device under illumination with an incandescent lamp. The superior performance of the Er-CdS NR device offers an avenue to develop highly sensitive multicolor photodetector applications. Self-powered photodetectors based on gallium doped cadmium sulphide (Ga:CdS) NRs/Au Schottky barrier diodes were investigated.157 The FESEM image of Ga:CdS NRs, energy band diagrams of open-circuited and short-circuited Ga:CdS NR/Au Schottky junction devices under light illumination and the time response (95/290 μs) at zero bias under light illumination of 510 nm are illustrated in Fig. 8(d–f). Moreover, the photoresponse of Schottky junction photodetectors at zero bias had excellent repeatability and stability with fast response speed in a wide range of switching frequencies.

Cadmium selenide (CdSe) being a direct bandgap II–VI semiconductor with a bandgap of ∼1.797 eV (wurtzite) and ∼1.712 eV (zinc blende) covers a broad range of the visible spectrum.158 CdSe nanobelts and nanosheets are promising towards the application of optical and sensory devices.159 The potential of CdSe nanoribbons in high-sensitivity photodetectors and photoelectronic switches was reported. Photodetectors made from CdSe nanoribbons showed high sensitivity, high photo-to-dark current, high response speed, excellent stability and reproducibility. The presence of discrete traps at different energy levels in the bandgap is caused by the light-dependent response speed.61 The impurity dependent optoelectronic properties resulted from the impurity traps in CdSe NB causing different photoresponse behaviour. The intrinsic CdSe NB is found to be more suitable for fast and sensitive photodetector applications in contrast to n-type CdSe NB that is favourable for high-gain photodetector applications.60Fig. 8(j–l) depicts the FESEM image of CdSe NBs, the schematic diagram of an experimental setup adopted for studying the photoresponse speed of CdSe NB PDs and the reproducible light ON/OFF switching properties of the two devices as reported by Wu et al.60 Moreover, Ohmic and Schottky contact based CdSe NB are used for photodetector fabrication in which the sizes of i- and n-NBs are almost identical so that the size-dependent effect can be minimized. High performance CdSe NB MESFET based photodetectors with high current responsivity, high gain and and fast photoresponse were also reported.160 A plasmonic photodetector (PPD) based on sole CdSe NRs and CdSe NRs decorated with plasmonic hollow gold nanoparticles (HGNs) on the surface with high sensitivity to red light illumination that can couple the incident light due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) was demonstrated.161 HGNs can function as an “antenna” for improving photocurrents owing to the plasmonic nearfield coupling. It also possibly enhances light absorption by localizing the incident field. The light illumination of the as-formed Schottky barrier leads to the energetic hot electrons from LSPR excitation of metallic plasmonic nanoparticles to couple with the resonant photon energy which further transfers to the nearby CdSe NR. The TEM image of individual CdSe NR, schematic illustration of PPD and the photoresponse of pure CdSe NR and HGNs@CdSe NR PD under 650 nm light illumination are shown in Fig. 8(g–i). The significant improvement of responsivity, ON/OFF current ratio and detectivity occurred via altering the HGNs. The optimized performance of the device was attributed to localized field enhancement and direct electron transfer induced by HGNs.
Gallium telluride (GaTe) exists in III–VI layered semiconductors having a direct bandgap (∼1.7 eV at RT in both single layer and bulk) with a monoclinic crystal structure in the space group C2h3 and individual layers were bonded to each other by weak van der Waals interactions. The Ga–Ga bonds in GaTe belong to two categories: one-third is parallel and two-thirds are perpendicular to the layer. GaTe received great interest in the demonstration of optoelectronic applications because of their direct band structure either in bulk or in single layer. GaTe nanosheets on mica of a few tens of μm to 100 μm were adopted for photodetectors.162Fig. 9(g–i) depict the SEM image of GaTe NSs on SiO2/Si substrate grown by the CVD method, optical images of the GaTe nanosheet device on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate and a time-dependent photoresponse of the same device with the laser being ON and OFF after bending different times at a bias of 5 V. It was found that the adsorbates on the GaTe surface influenced the performance of the device and fast response GaTe photodetectors were achieved after the removal of the adsorbates in ∼7 × 10−5 Torr vacuum. Hu et al.163 reported GaTe nanosheet based phototransistors in which the performance (photoresponsivity, detectivity) can be tuned by the applied gate voltage. Fig. 9(a–c) show the SEM image of GaTe NS, schematic of PD (inset: GaTe NS device) and also the time-resolved photoresponse at different bias voltages Vds = 0.1, 0.5 and 1 V. The detectivity of these devices was found to be ∼1012 Jones, which exceeded that of the InGaAs photodetectors (1011–1012 Jones).164 The direct bandgap structure of GaTe nanosheets played a major role in increased photon absorption and generation of excitons. The reported GaTe nanosheet photodetectors showed a responsivity of 274.4 A W−1 that surpassed the previously reported 2D nanosheet devices based on graphene, GaSe and GaS.44,75,79 Liu et al.165 studied high-sensitivity photodetectors based on multilayer GaTe flakes with high photoresponsivity (104 A W−1) and fast response time (6 ms). The optical image of the multilayer GaTe device, its 3D schematic view and time-resolved photoresponse are shown in Fig. 9(d–f). The reported photoresponsivity was higher than that of graphene, MoS2, and few layered compounds.111

The direct bandgap (1.44–1.50 eV) of cadmium telluride (CdTe) along with its interesting photoresponse characteristics make it suitable for photodetection in the visible-near infrared (NIR) region (400–800 nm). Xie et al.51 reported photodetectors based on single CdTe NRs with high responsivity, gain, high stability and reliability. The influence of surface states of NRs, channel length, light intensity, and working bias voltage on the photoresponse characteristics was also analysed. It has been demonstrated that surface state-induced traps is a significant factor to attain high responsivity and gain. The channel length was reduced with the increase in bias voltage which was responsible for responsivity and gain enhancement whereas the response speed was reduced due to the high trap density.
Zirconium trisulphide (ZrS3) belongs to transition metal trichalcogenides having a direct optical bandgap of 2.56 eV at room temperature. Flexible visible-light photodetectors based on ZrS3 nanobelt films were fabricated with broad photoresponse, excellent photo-switching effect and stability.16 The as-fabricated devices showed a tunable spectral selectivity, wide-range photoresponse, high-speed response and excellent environmental stability. With light illumination, currents are higher at similar bias voltages in the wavelength range of 405 nm to 780 nm with respect to that of the dark state which explains the photosensitivity of the ZrS3 nanobelt based device from visible light to near infrared. The photocurrent induced by 405 nm light at 45 mW cm2 is greater than the 780 nm light at 49.9 mW cm2 at the same voltage.16 This is evidence for the dependence of photosensitivity on the optical intensity and wavelength of light. The response of the device in air and vacuum was studied in order to understand the photosensitive mechanism. The current under vacuum is found to be higher than that in air which shows the presence of oxygen chemisorption/desorption on the ZrS3 nanobelts. The oxygen molecules are adsorbed on the surface of nanobelts in the presence of air so that they can attract free electrons from NB (form O2−) to form a low-conductivity depletion layer adjacent to the surface. The electron–hole pairs are generated in the device under illumination of light. The migration of holes towards the surface recombines with O2− to form O2 that desorbs from the surface. This causes an increase in the concentration of electrons thereby increasing the photocurrent. The response speed was found to be faster than in air. Hence, the nanobelt-film-based photodetectors show enhanced stability and durability compared to a single nanowire photodetector. Therefore, they could be attractive candidates for high-performance nanoscale optoelectronic devices for photodetection of visible to near infrared light. Xiong et al.166 reported photodetectors based on individual nanobelts of zirconium triselenide (ZrSe3) and hafnium triselenide (HfSe3) NB photodetectors which showed a good photoresponse to wavelengths ranging from 405 nm to 780 nm, high sensitivity, stability and a fast response to visible light.
The high-magnification SEM image of zirconium disulphide (ZrS2) NB, a schematic diagram of the ZrS2 nanobelt FET device and their reproducible ON/OFF switching upon 450 nm light illumination are given in Fig. 9(g–i). The photoconductivity of individual ZrS2 nanobelts showed excellent visible-light sensing performance.167 Monolayer MoS2 phototransistors with improved device mobility and ON current showed a maximum external photoresponsivity of 880 A W−1 at a wavelength of 561 nm and the photoresponse in the 400–680 nm range was demonstrated.168Fig. 10(a–c) present the optical image of a single-layer MoS2 flake and device, the schematic of the photodetector and (c) the cross-sectional view of the PD structure together with electrical connections. MoS2 nanosheet based phototransistors with prompt photoswitching and good photoresponsivity were also investigated.169 The AFM image of single-layer MoS2, the optical image of the FET device made by single-layer MoS2 and photoswitching characteristics of the same device at different optical powers and drain voltages are depicted in Fig. 10(d–f).

Molybdenum doped rhenium selenide (Mo:ReSe2) is optically biaxial and has relatively high crystal symmetry (CdCl2-type octahedral structure of triclinic symmetry) that makes it different from most of the other hexagonal layered TMDCs.170 It is an octahedral structured semiconductor that has optically biaxial and highly anisotropic nature. As the crystals are optically biaxial, a clustering of Re4 diamond units form along the b-axis within the van der Waals plane in the Mo:ReSe2 monolayer which is in contradiction with hexagonal structured TMDCs with their optical axis perpendicular to the van der Waals plane i.e. optically uniaxial.171,172 This phenomenon of “diamond chains” clustering accounts for their in-plane optical and electrical anisotropic response and is the reason for their usage in the fabrication of polarization sensitive photodetectors, photo-electrochemical solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.170,172 The investigation on the effects of physisorption of gas molecules on the few-layer Mo:ReSe2 nanosheet based photodetectors was made by comparing the photoresponse of the as-exfoliated device with an annealed device both in air or ammonia.170 The AFM image of these few-layer Mo:ReSe2 NS along with their device schematic and examination of the ON/OFF responsivity are given in Fig. 11(d–f). These photodetectors after annealing under an ammonia atmosphere displayed enhanced photoresponsivity and EQE compared to that in air and is evident that charge transfer between NH3 molecules is caused by the physisorption of the NH3 molecule thereby increasing the n-type carrier density.

Engel et al.173 reported a multi-layer BP photodetector to record diffraction-limited images of microscopic patterns in the visible (λVIS = 532 nm) and infrared (λIR = 1550 nm) spectra. Diffraction-limited images were confirmed by correlating the measured edge cross sections with model point spread functions. The experimental resolution (270 ± 5 nm) complies well with the width of the model point spread function at λVIS in which the estimate of the theoretical resolution limit is ∼260 nm. Similarly, the obtained experimental resolution (720 ± 15 nm) agrees well with the width of the model point spread function at λIR in which the theoretical estimate is ∼760 nm. Hence, a BP photodetector can be employed for the acquisition of diffraction-limited microscope images in both the visible and infrared spectral domain. The AFM image of the above-mentioned BP PD and the schematic of the imaging process (500 nm square array) are shown in Fig. 11(g and h). Fig. 11(i) depicts the scanning photocurrent micrographs of the short-circuit photocurrent excited at λVIS = 532 nm with an optical power density of 13.4 kW cm−2. Photodetectors based on single-crystalline germanium monosulphide (GeS) nanoribbons having a thickness of 20–50 nm, a width (several μm) and a length of hundreds of micrometers responded well to the entire visible light with a response edge at around 750 nm reliable with the bandgap of GeS.174Fig. 11(a–c) depict the SEM image of GeS nanoribbons, the fabricated photodetector and their time dependence with a bias voltage of 5 V under 530 nm light illumination. GeS is a layered p-type semiconductor with a distorted rock-salt orthorhombic structure and a bandgap of 1.65 eV.175,176 Graphene nanoribbons decorated with MoS2 as a carrier transport channel and MoS2 nanoparticles were employed to develop flexible (bending radii >6 mm) and low-cost photo-transistors exhibiting a photoresponsivity of 66 A W−1.53 Graphene nanoribbons acted as a carrier transport channel and the MoS2 nanoparticles supplemented high gain absorption thereby generating electron–hole pairs.
3.4. IR and terahertz photodetectors
Germanium selenide (GeSe) is a IV–VI p-type narrow band gap (1.08 eV) semiconductor with a layered crystal structure and has a high anisotropic crystallization in the layered structure with layers in parallel to the growth direction.177 A Schottky photodetector based on single-crystal GeSe nanosheets combined with Au contacts showed NIR light illumination (maximum photoconductive gain ∼5.3 × 102% at 4 V) at a wavelength of 808 nm.178Fig. 12(a and b) represent the low-magnification SEM images of GeSe nanosheets and the performance of the GeSe nanosheet-based photodetector device under 808 nm-light illumination, respectively. The time-dependent photocurrent response of the device to laser light illumination with different light intensities under vacuum (4 × 10−3 mbar) at a fixed bias of 4 V is given in Fig. 12(c). The defect-induced in-gap defective states caused slow decay of the current in the OFF state and weak light intensity dependence of photocurrent and was confirmed from first-principles calculations. Photodetectors integrated with five MoS2 monolayers exhibit a high photoresponsivity of 1.8 A W−1, an external quantum efficiency >260%, and a photodetectivity of ∼5 × 108 Jones at a wavelength of 850 nm.179 Youngblood et al.148 reported a gated multilayer black phosphorus photodetector integrated on a silicon photonic waveguide operating in the NIR telecom band. Fig. 1(d) shows the 3D representation of the waveguide integrated BP device configuration with a few-layer graphene top-gate. The optical microscopy image of the final device is given in Fig. 1(e) where the BP field-effect transistor is incorporated in one arm of the Mach–Zehnder interferometer circuit.

Armchair graphene nanoribbons (AG-NRs) are found to be a great substitute in infrared photodetectors owing to their tunability of bandgap by changing the width, and number of layers and inducing a transverse electric field on the structure. The photodetector parameters such as quantum efficiency and optical responsivity of AG-NRs p–i–n structure with all three structural families, different width and number of layers to be used in IR detectors were studied using tight-binding model.180 The responsivity of the AG-NR based IR photodetector was found to increase by increasing the width and number of layers and it was decreased by increasing the temperature.180 Theoretical studies on the dark current of IR photodetectors based on AG-NRs with its dependence on the gate voltage, the width of nanoribbons and temperature were conducted.181 Moreover, carriers to the AG-NR area were induced by the gate voltage in which photo-excited carriers sweep out of the detection area to produce an output signal. The results revealed that the dark current was increased with the increase in temperature. The width of the AG-NRs also influenced the dark current and it can be explained as follows: (1) in narrow AG-NRs, the dark current was increased by increasing the gate voltage and (2) in wider AG-NRs, the dark current was decreased by increasing the gate voltage.181 The optical properties of armchair graphene nanoribbons embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (BN) lattices studied by tight binding calculations showed that a larger photo current could be achieved in AG-NR/BN structures compared to conventional graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) attributed to the more allowed transitions.182
Ryzhii et al.183 reported the new concepts of terahertz and infrared photodetectors based on multiple graphene layers and multiple graphene nanoribbon structures and concluded that their responsivity and detectivity were caused by the high values of quantum efficiency and low rates of thermogeneration. Monolayer graphene has high quantum efficiency of interband transitions compared to bilayer graphene and graphene nanoribbons.184,185 With the increase in the number of graphene layers, the responsivity of multiple graphene layer photodiodes increases sub-linearly thereby increasing the quantum efficiency. The responsivity is very high in the case of a sufficiently large number of graphene layers owing to strong interband absorption. Moreover, the detectivity being a function of the number of graphene layers attains the maximum and slightly decreases afterwards.183 The mechanisms of photoconductivity in graphene layer–graphene nanoribbon–graphene layer (GL–GNR–GL) structures having i-type gapless GL as sensitive elements and I-type GNRs as barrier elements by developing a device model for the GL–GNR–GL photodiode were demonstrated.186 The dark current, photocurrent, and responsivity are calculated as functions of the structure parameters (width of GNR, doping causing a change in lattice constant), temperature, and the photon energy by means of the above-mentioned model. Their studies suggested that GL–GNR–GL photodiodes could be an interesting candidate for the fabrication of infrared and terahertz detectors operating at room temperature. The theoretical concept of terahertz and infrared photodetectors using the resonant radiative transitions between graphene layers in double-GL structures was also proposed by Ryzhii et al.187 The calculated absorption spectrum and the spectral characteristics of the reported photodetector responsivity showed sharp resonant maxima (tunable by applied voltage) at photon energies in a wide range. The working of double graphene layer PDs is correlated with the absorption of incident IR radiation together with the electron tunneling transitions between GLs for producing the electric terminal current. Chitara et al.134 established IR photodetection using both reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and GNRs in terms of time-resolved photocurrent and photoresponse. The TEM image of GNRs, the high-resolution (HRTEM) image (inset) along with the photodetector mechanism and photocurrent as a function of time with different IR intensities at 2 V for GNRs are presented in Fig. 12(d–f). The responsivity and external quantum efficiency of RGO were 4 mA W−1 and 0.3%, respectively, whereas for GNR these values were 1 A W−1 and 80%, respectively, for an incident wavelength of 1550 nm at 2 V. Graphene has an optical absorbance of 2.3% ± 0.2% and the value is doubled for bilayer graphene.188–192 A recent report showed that the optical absorbance spectrum of few-layer graphene depends on the stacking sequence of monolayer graphene.193 Hence, GNRs could be a better material for high-selectivity, high sensitivity and high-speed nanometer-scale photodetectors and photoelectronic switches.
Recently, researchers are more oriented towards graphene plasmonics and it is an interesting research field which is evident from the publications.194–204 Interestingly, van der Waals heterostructures are also growing in the field of mid-infrared nanophotonics.205 Graphene plasmons can be excited by electromagnetic radiation if and only if their wave vector, energy and optical fields are matched. This can be performed in different ways: (i) enhanced plasmonic extinction by light scattering in the vicinity of the sub-wavelength nano-scale structures,206 (ii) coupling by grating developed on either top or bottom of graphene207 (iii) by patterning the graphene to form periodic plasmonic metamaterials.208–210 Graphene's optical properties in the infrared and terahertz could be altered/improved by sculpting graphene into periodic metamaterials with sub-wavelength feature sizes. Moreover, arrays of graphene nanoribbons, nanodiscs or nanorings have the ability to support localized plasmonics thereby acting as sharp notch filters in the mid-infrared. Freitag et al.211 realized polarization-sensitive and gate-tunable plasmonic photodetection in graphene nanoribbon arrays in which the photo-induced temperature increases up to four times as large as comparable two-dimensional graphene detectors. The close-up SEM image of the contact area of a GNR array photodetector having 100 nm GNR width and 100 nm GNR spacing is shown in Fig. 12(g). The length and width of the whole array are given as 30 and 10 mm, respectively. Fig. 12(h) shows the schematic diagram of the photoconductivity setup in which the IR laser light at 10.6 mm was chopped at 1.1 kHz and the photocurrent was analysed by a lock-in amplifier referenced to the chopping frequency. The scanning photocurrent image of the GNR superlattice PD is depicted in Fig. 12(i). Here, novel room-temperature mid-infrared detector based on the intrinsic graphene plasmon excitations was demonstrated by altering the graphene plasmons by means of remote plasmon–phonon coupling with the surface phonons of the polar substrate.
4. Outlook and challenges
The next significant technological step might be the nano-optoelectronic integration of hybrid devices in the realization of photodetectors. The size of NB/NR/NS tunes their bandgap that can be the key factor for spectral tunability within the single material system in the process of multispectral photodetectors that are sensitive to visible, near-infrared, ultraviolet and broadband spectral range. One can tune the bandgap if the structures are formed in core–shell form and also there are more opportunities for this kind of research as it combines two different materials. The potential of doping strategies in a controllable manner during the time of growth to achieve uniform distribution in NB/NR/NS could also be considered. NB/NR/NS are rewarded with bounteous enhanced properties of the quantum confinement effect, dimensionality dependence, compact size, ease of manipulation, precise crystal structures, rationally designed surface, peculiar 1D enclosing surfaces, large surface area exposure to light, strong polarization dependence, better photoresponse and the response speed. The design of ternary compounds in these materials will be a great challenge in order to understand the tuning of the photo-detection range by taking into account the solid solution formation.
The fabrication of complex hybrid nanostructured material based photodetectors is blooming nowadays. The sustained progress in this field and the future of these devices will demand new paradigms. It is more challenging to form precise hybrid nanostructures with more focus on the feature size, dimensionality and distribution of materials which will pave the way for attaining better performances in photo-detection. The two-dimensional nanostructures can be more compatible with the current thin film micro-manufacturing techniques along with their easy fabrication into complex structures owing to their dimensionality, compact size, ease of manipulation, precise crystal structures, rationally designed surface and peculiar one-dimensional enclosing surfaces. In this way, one can overcome the limitations such as reducing the dimensions to the nanoscale, controlling the crystallinity, surface to volume ratio, lattice mismatch, and no well-defined interface and purity. The novel hybrid nanostructures will be a great boon for the realization of novel photodetectors with enhanced properties to achieve better performances. The new innovations should be more focussed on grasping these plentiful properties to upgrade the device fabricating techniques in terms of bandgap engineering. There is still plenty of room for the design of smart, flexible, self-powered, portable, and multifunctional photodetectors in the emerging area of nano-optoelectronics. More future studies will be encouraged in this specific theme dedicated towards the real-time applications to be available for the common man in society.
