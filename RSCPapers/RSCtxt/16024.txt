    , Accepted 10th June 2018First published on 12th June 2018AbstractOwing to good crystal structure and novel one-dimensional (1D) outer surface, MAPbI3 nanowires (NWs) show fewer grain boundaries, lower defect density and longer carrier lifetime as compared with their polycrystalline thin films, leading to MAPbI3 NWs exhibiting higher quantum efficiencies in optoelectronic devices. Herein, by a simple two-step spin-coating method with the addition of various N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) contents, a PbI2–DMF adduct is formed; this changes the micro-morphology of MAPbI3 perovskite from 3 dimensional (3D) nanocubic to 1D NW. Through optimizing the DMF contents, MAPbI3 NWs with strongest light absorbability and best crystallinity have been obtained (500 μL DMF). In addition, photodetectors (PDs) are assembled with various DMF amounts on glass substrates, and the optimal MAPbI3 NW PD (500 μL DMF) shows the best performance with on/off ratio greater than 250; the rise and decay times are 12 and 22 ms, respectively. Furthermore, a flexible MAPbI3 NW PD is assembled, and it shows good sequential and stable response with the on/off ratio of more than 45. Notably, under various bending curvatures and many cycles, the performance of the flexible NW device has only slight degradation. Our results may have great value for the application of flexible MAPbI3 NW devices in the future.
1. Introduction
Methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite (PVK) is used as an absorber in solar cells for obtaining more than 20% conversion efficiency,1–3 and it has attracted tremendous attention. In addition, MAPbI3 as the active material has also been widely reported in the field of light-emitting diodes,4 lasers,5 field-effect transistors6 and photodetectors (PDs)7–19 due to its tunable band gap, large optical absorption coefficient, long electron–hole diffusion length, high carrier mobility and lower preparation cost.20–22
Owing to good crystal structure and novel one-dimensional (1D) outer surface, MAPbI3 nanowires (NWs) show fewer grain boundaries, lower defect density and longer carrier lifetime as compared with their polycrystalline thin films, leading to MAPbI3 NWs exhibiting higher quantum efficiencies in optoelectronic devices.20 Thus, optoelectronic devices based on MAPbI3 NWs are expected to exhibit greater optoelectronic properties, and their unique one-dimensional structures may lead to wider application prospects. A PD has two kinds of structures, i.e., p–n junction and metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) structures. Compared with the p–n junction, the MSM structure can show better transmission capability of electron–hole towards the radial direction of a NW. In addition, devices based on MSM structures are more suitable for application in flexible wearable devices. Furthermore, the simple preparation methods of MAPbI3 NWs such as one-step self-assembly,22 two-step spin-coating,29 and two-step dipping method23,24 are beneficial for flexible devices. Although PDs based on MAPbI3 NWs have attracted intense research interests, few studies are focused on flexible MAPbI3 NW PDs.25–28
Herein, we report a simple two-step spin-coating method with the addition of various N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) contents to prepare flexible MAPbI3 NW PDs. A PbI2–DMF adduct is formed first with the addition of DMF, leading to the formation of MAPbI3 NWs. In addition, PDs based on various DMF amounts are assembled on glass substrates. The PD based on MAPbI3 NWs with 500 μL DMF shows the best performance with the on/off ratio greater than 250, and the rise and decay times are 12 and 22 ms, respectively. Furthermore, a flexible PD based on MAPbI3 NWs is prepared, and it shows good sequential and stable response with the on/off ratio of more than 45. Notably, under various bending curvatures and many bending cycles, the device shows only slight performance degradation.
2. Experimental section
Materials and reagents
The chemical materials and reagents used for preparing MAPbI3 were methylammonium iodide (MAI, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp, Xian, China), lead iodide (PbI2, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp, Xian, China), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China), and isopropanol (IPA, AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China). All chemicals were directly used without any purification.
Formation of MAPbI3 nanocube (NC), NC + NW and NW
Glass substrates (size 2 × 2 cm2) were ultrasonically washed in deionized water, acetone solution and anhydrous ethanol for 30 minutes. Before use, the substrates were treated by a UV cleaner for 30 minutes to improve surface adhesion. As shown in Scheme 1, MAPbI3 NWs were prepared using a simple two-step spin-coating procedure as previously reported.29 For the deposition of PbI2 films, 1 mL PbI2/DMF solution was prepared by dissolving 0.462 g PbI2 powder in 1 mL DMF solution in a thermostat oven at 70 °C for 12 h. Then, 90 μL of PbI2/DMF solution was loaded on the glass substrate for 10 s, spun at 3000 rpm for 5 s and 6000 rpm for 5 s, and annealed at 70 °C for 20 minutes. Then, the PbI2 film was formed, and 200 μL of mixed solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) including various DMF contents (200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 μL) was loaded on the PbI2 film. It can be seen that the yellow PbI2 film gradually turned to the “white” stage; after reaction for 50 s, the sample was spun at 4000 rpm for 20 s, and the “white” stage turned to the “red brown” stage. Finally, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 5 minutes, and MAPbI3 NWs were obtained. MAPbI3 NC and NC + NW were prepared using the same two-step spin-coating procedure with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) including 0, 50 and 100 μL volumes of DMF. All experiments were carried out in air with the humidity of ∼60%.

Fabrication of MSM structure PDs
After preparation of MAPbI3 NWs, Au interdigital electrodes with finger width of 100 μm and active area of 0.0252 cm2 were evaporated, and a photograph of the MAPbI3 NW PD is shown in Fig. S1(a)–(d) (ESI†). Au electrodes were evaporated by the JSD-300 evaporation coating machine at the pressure of about 10−4 Pa. The thickness of the Au interdigital electrodes was 60 nm. The PD based on MAPbI3 NWs was fabricated on a PET substrate using the same process to obtain flexible MSM structure.
Characterization and measurement
The absorption spectra of MAPbI3 NC, NC + NW and NW were measured by a UV-via-NIR spectrophotometer (MPC-3100, SHIMADZU) in the range from 400 to 900 nm. The crystal structures of MAPbI3 NC, NC + NW and NW were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 FOCUS X-ray diffraction) with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Titan G2 60-300). The morphologies of MAPbI3 NC, NC + NW and NW were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM7100F). Current–voltage (I–V), current–time (I–T), photoresponse time and performances of the flexible devices were measured by Agilent Technologies Semiconductor Device Analyzer (B1500A); the light source used was the 7IPD30 deuterium lamp, and light power intensity of the light source was measured by a light intensity meter. Responsivity and detectivity were measured by a Keithley 4200 electrometer. A 66984 Xe arc source (300 W, Oriel) and an Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator were used to achieve various wavelengths of monochromatic light. The light illuminated from the FTO side and the I–T measurements were carried out by an optical chopper. An optical filter was used when illuminating 500 nm light. Light intensity was measured by a UV-enhanced Si detector. All characteristics were measured in air environment without any encapsulation.
3. Results and discussion
To investigate the micro-morphology of MAPbI3 prepared on a glass substrate with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) including various DMF contents, SEM images were taken for analysis. When the DMF content was 0 μL, MAPbI3 showed 3-dimensional (3D) NC morphology (Fig. 1(a)). The 3D NC morphology of MAPbI3 PVK started to change when the DMF content was 50 μL (Fig. S2(a), ESI†); some 3D NCs disappeared, and a small amount of 1D NWs was formed. When more DMF was added (Fig. 1(b)), more 3D NCs disappeared, and more 1D NWs were formed. 3D NCs changed to 1D NWs completely when the DMF content was increased to 200 μL (Fig. 1(c)). When more than 200 μL DMF was added (Fig. 1(d) and Fig. S2(b)–(d), ESI†), the diameter and the length of 1D NWs increased and decreased, respectively; also, the NWs became sparse. To clearly study the variation in the diameter of NWs with various DMF contents, the diameter distribution of NWs in an area of 5 × 5 μm2 is shown in Fig. S2(e) (ESI†). It can be seen that the diameters of NWs ranged from ∼200 to ∼1200 nm, and the diameter distribution of NWs shifted to a larger space region with increasing DMF contents. Based on the above-mentioned morphology analysis, we inferred that DMF plays a key role in preparing 1D NWs.

To further understand why a certain amount of DMF can result in 1D MAPbI3 NWs from 3D NCs, the formation mechanism of MAPbI3 NW must be analyzed in detail. Petrov et al.23 used a two-step dipping method to prepare MAPbI3 NWs by dipping PbI2 films into MAI/IPA solution having a certain amount of DMF, and they reported that the white intermediate phase formed first is a kind of MAI–PbI2–DMF adduct;30 the preferred growth direction of the adduct was in accordance with the direction of the PbI2〈100〉 crystal surface, because the crystal surface allows minimum distance between lead atoms. The white intermediate phase crystallized as the 1D crystal form, resulting in the formation of the MAPbI3 NWs; this growth process is a oriented attachment growth mechanism,31 in which DMF plays a key role in the formation of the MAI–PbI2–DMF adduct. Im et al.29 believed that the PbI2 film prepared in the first step would be dissolved by a certain amount of DMF added in MAI/IPA solution, and locally dissolved PbI2 may act as a priority network to react with MAI for forming a 1D structure similar to that of a liquid phase catalyst cluster model;32 they also inferred that DMF plays a key role in partially dissolving PbI2 to induce the formation of 1D NWs. In our experiment, the spin-coated PbI2 film has a 2D sheet structure, as shown in Fig. 2(a). After the MAI/IPA solution having a certain amount of DMF was dropped on the PbI2 film, it remained for several seconds, and the PbI2 film gradually turned from yellow to white (Scheme 1); this process may include the following chemical reactions: (I) PbI2 and DMF formed a kind of PbI2–DMF adduct;33,34 (II) the preferred growth direction of the PbI2–DMF adduct was in accordance with the direction of the PbI2〈100〉 crystal surface33,34 and thus, the adduct crystallized in a 1D rod-like structure form; (III) MAI reacted with PbI2, and MAPbI3 PVK was formed. Based on the above-mentioned analysis, we believe that DMF plays a key role in the formation of PbI2–DMF adduct, and this results in the formation of MAPbI3 PVK NWs.

SEM images of PbI2 film after reacting with the solution of IPA (5 mL) including various DMF contents for 50 s: (b) 0 μL DMF, (c) 50 μL DMF, (d) 100 μL DMF, (e) 200 μL DMF, (f) 300 μL DMF, (g) 400 μL DMF, (h) 500 μL DMF, and (i) 600 μL DMF. PbI2 film was deposited on a glass substrate. 
To verify the above-mentioned analysis, SEM images were taken to investigate the changes in the micromorphology of PbI2 film after reacting with the solution of IPA (5 mL) having various DMF contents for 50 s, as shown in Fig. 2(b)–(i). When the PbI2 film reacted with the solution of IPA (5 mL) having 0 μL DMF for 50 s, its morphology did not change (Fig. 2(b)). As we added 50 and 100 μL DMF into the IPA (5 mL) solution, the morphology changed slightly (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). When the amount of DMF increased to 200 μL, the morphology of the PbI2 film changed clearly, and the 2D sheet structure changed to 1D rod-like structure (Fig. 2(e)). With the increasing content of DMF, some large 1D rod-like objects appeared (Fig. 2(f)–(i)). When the DMF content increased from 300 to 600 μL (Fig. 2(f)–(i)), the length of the 1D rod-like structure increased. Furthermore, from Fig. 2(h) and (i), we can see that the diameters and lengths of the rod-like structures reached μm levels.
Thus, we can conclude that when the DMF content was increased, the number of 1D rod-like structure objects was less, which may be related to the reaction time. The PbI2 film reacted with DMF/IPA (5 mL) solution having 500 μL DMF for different reaction times (from 10 to 180 s), and the results are shown in Fig. 3. When the PbI2 film reacted with the solution of IPA (5 mL) containing 500 μL DMF for 10 s (Fig. 3(a)), 1D rod-like structure started to form, but the structure was not clearly seen since the time was too short. When the reaction time was 20 s (Fig. 3(b)), the 1D rod-like structure was formed, and its length reached several microns. To further observe the change in morphology following reaction time, the time durations were increased to 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150 and 180 s, as shown in Fig. 3(c)–(i), respectively. It was evident that as the reaction time became longer, many large 1D rod-like structure objects could be obtained. Most importantly, with the prolongation of reaction time, the orientation of 1D rod-like structures also changed, which eventually led to the formation of the NW network.

To explore the effects of various DMF contents on the photoelectric properties of MAPbI3 PVK, we have fabricated PD devices based on MAPbI3 PVK prepared by a two-step spin-coating method with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) containing various DMF contents. The schematic diagram of the PD based on MAPbI3 NWs is illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The corresponding optical microscopy image of Au interdigitated electrodes with finger width of 100 μm is presented in Fig. 4(b). When voltage is applied on the Au interdigital electrodes, as shown in Fig. 4(a), electric fields are formed between the Au electrodes. Under illumination, shown in Fig. 4(a), the formed electric field separates the photogenerated carriers (electrons and holes) and facilitates these carriers to the Au electrodes, resulting in photocurrent.18 To better understand the working mechanism of the PD device, the band diagram of the PD based on MAPbI3 PVK is shown in Fig. 4(c). It can be seen that the top of the valence band (Ev) and the bottom of the conduction band (Ec) of MAPbI3 are −5.43 eV and −3.93 eV, respectively.35 When the device is under illumination (hv > Eg), the electrons and holes transfer from Ec and Ev to the Au band under electric field. Also, due to the high work function of contact metal Au, the interface between MAPbI3 PVK and metal Au forms a good ohmic contact,36 facilitating the transport of the carriers. The performances of PDs based on MAPbI3 PVK prepared with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) having various DMF contents are measured and presented in Fig. 4(d)–(f) and Fig. S3 (ESI†). Fig. 4(d) and Fig. S3(a) (ESI†) show I–V logarithm curves of PDs in dark and under ultraviolet light irradiation (2.00 mW cm−2). It can be seen that the light current under illumination is much larger than the dark current, thus showing that the devices exhibit good photoelectric response. To study the change of the dark current and photocurrent with various DMF contents, current–DMF content curves of PDs at 5 V bias are shown in Fig. S3(c) and (d) (ESI†). The PD based on MAPbI3 NWs prepared with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) having 500 μL DMF shows the largest photocurrent with the value of 64 nA at 5 V bias. To explore the sequential response to light switch of PDs, I–T logarithm curves of PDs at 5 V under ultraviolet light irradiation (2.00 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4(e) and Fig. S3(b) (ESI†). It is evident that the photocurrent of PDs is stable during repeated on/off cycles. Notably, the PD based on MAPbI3 NWs prepared with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) having 500 μL DMF possesses the largest on/off ratio (more than 35), as shown in Fig. S3(e) (ESI†). The switching ratio, which is defined as the ratio of photocurrent to dark current (Iph/Idark), is a main parameter of PDs;37 it can be calculated from the I–V logarithm curves, as shown in Fig. 4(d) and Fig. S3(a) (ESI†). Fig. 4(f) and Fig. S3(f) (ESI†) show the ratios of Iph/Idark curves of PDs under different sweep voltages. It can be seen that the Iph/Idark ratio of the PD based on MAPbI3 NWs prepared with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) containing 500 μL DMF is higher than those of other PD groups. Clearly, the device based on 500 μL DMF possesses the largest Iph/Idark ratio with a value of ∼70 at −1 V; the smallest value is ∼2.5 at −1 V for the device based on 100 μL DMF. Notably, it can be seen that when the voltage varies from −5 V to −1 V, the dark current and photocurrent decrease at the same time, but the values of the Iph/Idark ratio change very slightly. Based on the above-mentioned analysis of the performances of PDs, we can conclude that the PD based on MAPbI3 PVK NWs prepared with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) containing 500 μL DMF shows the best photoelectric response characteristics.

To understand why the PD based on MAPbI3 PVK NWs prepared with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) containing 500 μL DMF shows the best photoelectric properties, we first performed UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometry. The UV-vis absorption spectra of MAPbI3 PVK are measured, and they are presented in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. S4(a) (ESI†). It is seen that the light absorption edge of MAPbI3 PVK exhibits a red shift after DMF is added. In addition, with the change in the DMF content, the range of the red shift is also changed, and the range of red shift is the largest when 500 μL DMF is added. The band gap (Eg) of MAPbI3 PVK decreases with the increase in the light absorption edge, according to the Tauc formula (αhν)2 = c(hν − Eg),22 and the band gap of MAPbI3 PVK is the smallest when 500 μL DMF is added, which is beneficial for excitation of photogenerated carriers. In addition, after adding DMF, the light absorption of MAPbI3 PVK is significantly enhanced between 500 and 800 nm, which may be due to the morphology of MAPbI3 PVK changing from 3D NC to 1D NW network; the networks formed by crisscrossing of 1D NWs may reduce light reflection and increase scattering of light therein11 and thus, the light absorption of MAPbI3 PVK is clearly enhanced. NWs prepared by 500 μL DMF show the strongest light absorption; the reason may be that 1D NW networks formed by 500 μL DMF are more beneficial for reducing light reflection and increasing light scattering. In general, the addition of 500 μL DMF results in the smallest band gap and the best morphology of MAPbI3 PVK NWs, which greatly facilitate excitation of photogenerated carriers and light absorption; thus, MAPbI3 NW PDs prepared with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) containing 500 μL DMF show the best photoelectric response characteristics.

(d) The corresponding HRTEM image and (e) high-quality SAED pattern of the labelled area of a single MAPbI3 NW as shown in (c). MAPbI3 PVK was deposited on a glass substrate. 
The XRD patterns of MAPbI3 PVK are shown in Fig. 5(b) and Fig. S4(b) (ESI†). It can be seen that the crystal structure of MAPbI3 PVK does not change after adding DMF; it is a tetragonal phase structure,38,39 and the (110) and (220) diffraction peaks are much stronger than the (112), (202), (310), (224) and (314) diffraction peaks, indicating that the {110} planes prefer to align parallel to the substrate. In addition, it can be found that the crystallinity of MAPbI3 PVK increases when DMF is added, and the (220) diffraction peak of MAPbI3 PVK is the highest when 500 μL DMF is added, which illustrates that the crystallinity of MAPbI3 PVK NWs is the best. It is known that the better the crystallinity, the less the defects of MAPbI3 PVK, which results in less recombination of photogenerated carriers and larger photocurrent. In addition, the crystal structure of MAPbI3 PVK NWs formed by adding 500 μL DMF is further analyzed by TEM. Fig. 5(c) is a low-resolution TEM image of a single MAPbI3 NW, and the NW shows uniform diameter of about 370 nm and smooth surface. Higher magnification of the part marked in the red box in Fig. 5(c) is shown in Fig. 5(d), and the NW shows a clear lattice stripe with lattice spacing of 0.31 nm, which corresponds to the (220) lattice plane of the tetragonal MAPbI3 phase.38,39 Also, the high-quality SAED pattern (Fig. 5(e)) shows the single crystal properties of the NW. Through the above-mentioned analysis, it is evident that MAPbI3 PVK NW based on 500 μL DMF has the strongest light absorbance, smallest band gap and best crystallinity, resulting in the best photoelectric properties.
Thus, we can infer that the PD based on MAPbI3 PVK NWs prepared with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) containing 500 μL DMF possesses optimal performance, but the on/off ratio is only about 35, and the photocurrent is 64 nA at 5 V bias. The process is further optimized, and better performances of the PD based on MAPbI3 NW prepared with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) containing 500 μL DMF are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and Fig. 6(a)–(f). The I–V curves of the PD in dark and under ultraviolet light irradiation (4.76 mW cm−2) and the I–T curves of the PD at 5 V under ultraviolet light irradiation (4.76 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. S5(a) and (b) (ESI†); it is evidenced that the value of the photocurrent reaches more than 2.9 μA at 5 V bias, which is much larger than the previous value (64 nA). The on/off ratio increases to more than 250, which is much larger than the previous value (35). To study the light response ability of the PD with different light intensities, the I–V curves of the PD in dark and under different intensities of ultraviolet light irradiation are shown in Fig. 6(a). The photocurrent increases with increasing light irradiation intensity because the number of photogenerated carriers is proportional to the number of absorbed photons, especially at high applied bias.36 Also, the I–V curves present typical linear behavior with increasing bias, indicating that an ohmic contact is formed between PVK and Au electrode. To explore the sequential response to light switch under different light irradiation intensities, the I–T curves of the PD at 5 V under different light irradiation intensities are obtained, and the results are shown in Fig. 6(b). The photocurrent of the PD is stable during repeated on/off cycles, and it increases with increasing irradiation intensity, which is consistent with the I–V results (Fig. 6(a)). To clearly observe the variation of photocurrent with different light irradiation intensities, photocurrent–light intensity curves are obtained, and the results are shown in Fig. 6(c); the curves exhibit almost linear variation characteristics. In addition, it can be seen that under the same light intensity, the higher the applied bias, the larger the photocurrent, which indicates that the applied bias can effectively promote the separation of electron–hole pairs, restrain their recombination and improve photoelectric response of the device. The variation of photocurrent under long-time light irradiation is an important parameter to test the light stability of a PD. To examine the light stability of our mesh-structured NW PD, the I–T curve of the PD at 5 V under ultraviolet light irradiation (0.43 mW cm−2) for more than 20 min is obtained, and the result is shown in Fig. 6(d). From the curve, it is clear that when the PD remains illuminated under ultraviolet light irradiation up to 20 min, as shown by the blue dotted line, the photocurrent slightly decays; the decay may be due to instability of MAPbI3 PVK PD when it is studied in air without any encapsulation and more than 50% humidity. In spite of the slight decay, the light stability of the PD is relatively very good. In addition, after the PD remains illuminated up to 20 min, the periodic I–T measurement is taken, and the PD still shows good sequential and stable response to light switch. Response speed is an important parameter of PDs,20,40 which reflects the speed of the photocurrent generated after sudden light irradiation and the dark current when light irradiation is suddenly removed to achieve a stable value. From Fig. 6(e), the rise time (tr) and decay time (td) are extracted with values of 12 and 22 ms, respectively. Responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) are two key parameters to characterize the performance of PDs,41,42 and they can be calculated with the following equations. (1) (2)Here, S is the effective irradiation area, Popt is the light density, and Jd is the dark current density. Fig. 6(f) shows responsivity and detectivity of the PD at three major wavelengths (405, 500, 600 nm). It can be seen that the responsivity and detectivity increase with a near-linear trend as the applied bias increases. Notably, at the same bias, the device shows the largest responsivity and detectivity at 405 nm, which may be due to the largest absorbance of PVK around 400 nm, as shown in Fig. 5(a). In addition, under 405 nm wavelength light irradiation, the responsivity reaches 15 mA W−1 and detectivity is 3.5 × 1011 Jones, which are good values for PDs based on mesh-structure NWs with several layers.

To study the application of the NW device in the flexible field, the PD based on MAPbI3 PVK NWs with the solution of MAI in IPA (35 mg/5 mL) containing 500 μL DMF was fabricated on a flexible PET substrate. The photograph of the flexible PD and SEM image of MAPbI3 NW on flexible PET substrate are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. We can see that NWs on flexible substrate show good morphologies, and the distribution of NW diameters is consistent with that of NWs prepared on glass substrates. The performance of the flexible PD without bending was measured, and the results are presented in Fig. 7(c)–(f). When the flexible device was irradiated under ultraviolet light irradiation (2.00 mW cm−2) or in dark (Fig. 7(c)), the device showed good photoelectric response characteristics. In addition, from the I–T curve of the PD at 5 V under ultraviolet light irradiation (2.00 mW cm−2) (Fig. 7(d)), it was inferred that the flexible device showed good sequential response, and the on/off ratio reached more than 45. Fig. 7(e) shows the I–V curves of the PD under ultraviolet light irradiation with various light intensities; the device showed good light response ability with optical power increasing from 0.5 to 2.0 mW cm−2. To clearly see the variation of photocurrent with different light irradiation intensities, the photocurrent–light intensity curves of the flexible PD were obtained, and they are shown in Fig. 7(f); the curves showed similar characteristics compared with those of the PD formed on the glass substrate, as analyzed from Fig. 6(c). In general, the performances of the flexible PD based on MAPbI3 PVK NWs are very good.

The stable electrical property of a flexible optoelectronic device under bending is an important factor for practical applications. Bearing this in mind, we systematically studied the electrical properties of the flexible device under bending. The performances of the flexible PD based on MAPbI3 PVK NWs under bending were measured, and the results are presented in Fig. 8 and Fig. S6 (ESI†). Fig. 8(a) shows I–T logarithm curves of the flexible PD under various bending curvatures. In the bending process, the bending curvatures of the flexible device increased gradually, as shown in the insets of Fig. 8(a); the four different bending states of the flexible device were studied, and they were labeled as I, II, III and IV.43 It can be seen that as bending curvatures increased, photocurrent and dark current decreased slightly, but the on/off ratio was almost the same; the corresponding I–V logarithm curves under various bending curvatures are shown in Fig. S6(a) (ESI†). It can be seen that the I–V logarithm curves showed good symmetry when the device was under different bending curvatures, which indicated that a good ohmic contact was formed between PVK and Au electrode; the changing trend of photocurrent and dark current was consistent with that shown in Fig. 8(a). To further study the effect of bending behavior on device performance, the I–T logarithm curves of the device after repeated bending cycles are shown in Fig. 8(b); the insets are the fixed bending curvatures for each bending. It can be seen that when the bending cycles were changed from 0 to 90, the photocurrent and dark current decreased slightly, which was consistent with the I–V logarithm curves shown in Fig. S6(b) (ESI†). Notably, after bending for different cycles, the device still showed good sequential and stable response to light switch. From the above-mentioned data, it is evidenced that our device shows good bending tolerance and thus, it may be applied in flexible optoelectronics field.
 Fig. 8  The performances of the flexible PD with bending: (a) I–T logarithm curves of the flexible PD when bent with different curvatures at a bias voltage of 5 V under ultraviolet light irradiation (2.00 mW cm−2). The insets are corresponding photographs of the device under different bending states. (b) I–T logarithm curves of the flexible PD after 0, 30 and 90 cycles of bending under fixed bending state at a bias voltage of 5 V under ultraviolet light irradiation (2.00 mW cm−2). The insets are corresponding photographs of the device under the fixed bending state for each bending. 
Our flexible devices showed good repeatability, stability and bending tolerance. However, slight decrease in dark current or photocurrent was also seen, which may be due to fracturing of parts of NWs, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Mesh structured PVK NWs may be more easily broken due to NW stacking. To enhance the stability of the NW device, surface modification of NW may be a good way; also, it may be useful for improving the preparation process. Furthermore, the use of a single NW to replace the mesh structure may be another way to obtain more stable flexible devices.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, by using a simple two-step spin-coating method, MAPbI3 NWs with a mesh structure were prepared in air, and flexible devices based on NWs were also obtained. The PD based on NWs on the glass substrate showed an on/off ratio greater than 250, and the rise and decay times were 12 and 22 ms, respectively. Under irradiation of 405 nm monochromatic light, the responsivity reached 15 mA W−1, and detectivity was 3.5 × 1011 Jones. In addition, the flexible PD showed good sequential and stable response, and its on/off ratio reached more than 45. Furthermore, under various bending curvatures or many bending cycles, the device showed negligible performance degradation. This study may supply valuable information for the application of flexible devices based on MAPbI3 NWs in the future.
