    , Accepted 19th May 2014First published on 27th May 2014AbstractNovel one-dimensional SiC@carbon nanotube (CNT) coaxial nanocables have been successfully fabricated on a large scale by using a carbothermal chemical vapor deposition method. Sol–gel-derived silica xerogels containing commercial multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were used as silicon and carbon sources. The obtained product was characterized by SEM, HRTEM, Raman spectroscopy and XRD. The coaxial nanocables have been found to be composed of a 40–100 nm diameter carbon nanotube as the core, surrounded by a thick SiC outlayer. The inner nanotube corresponded to the multi-walls of the carbon nanotube with a lattice spacing of 0.34 nm. The PL spectrum revealed that the SiC@CNT nanocables have two broad emission bands centered at 461 nm and 573 nm which can be attributed to the quantum confinement effect and the morphology effects. The morphology of the product was tuned by simply altering the reaction temperature. In the formation of SiC@carbon nanotube coaxial nanocables, it was proposed that CNTs acted as a template to confine the reaction, which resulted in the continuous SiC outlayer growth on the CNT surface to form SiC@CNT coaxial nanocables.
Introduction
SiC is a wide-bandgap semiconductor and has various excellent properties such as high electron mobility, high thermal conductivity, high tolerance for electrical breakdown, high hardness, and high mechanical strength.1,2 These excellent properties make SiC a good candidate for electronic and photonic devices designed for high-temperature, high-power, and high-frequency applications.3,4 Many research efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of SiC-related one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures.5–7
As a unique kind of one-dimensional (1D) nanoarchitecture, nanocables are a coaxial core–shell heterostructure that can offer the possibility to enhance functionality and multifunctional properties compared with those of their limited single-component counterparts.8 Coaxial nanocables can be fabricated by first forming nanotubes with a nano-size diameter and then depositing a material dissimilar to the nanotubes over the surfaces of the nanotubes.9,10 Such nanocables possess one-dimensional features of both nanowires and nanotubes in the axial direction. Because of spatially confine reaction based on the morphological integrity of CNTs, CNTs have been used as ideal templates to synthesize one-dimensional nanostructures with similar diameters, lengths, and orientations close to those of the CNTs.11 Hence, many efforts have been devoted to the direct synthesis of special 1D coaxial nanocables by using CNTs as the template. For example, well-defined silica-coated CNT coaxial nanocables have been synthesized at room temperature by using sonication with sol–gel techniques.12 The CNT@SnO2-Au nanocables were successfully prepared by a simple one-pot synthetic route.13 There has also been a report on the direct reaction between CNTs and Si powders via a thermal evaporation process in vacuum to form SiC@CNT composite nanotubes.14 Nevertheless, significant difficulties still exist in directly fabricating well-defined SiC@CNT coaxial nanocables which can maintain the skeleton of the CNT template in the final product.
Carbothermal reduction of silica is the most useful method of SiC nanowire synthesis owing to its efficiency and simplicity. Herein, SiC-based nanocables can possibly be obtained by forming a SiC outlayer on the surface of the CNT template via direct reaction between CNTs and silica. Such heterostructures may offer great potential for applications in field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, gas sensors, magnetic sensors and optical nanodevices.7
In this work, we report the fabrication of SiC@CNT coaxial nanocables on a Co(NO3)2-catalyzed Si substrate by using a carbothermal chemical vapor deposition method (CVD). The structure, properties, and the possible growth mechanism of the SiC@CNT heterostructure on the Si substrate are discussed.
Experimental
Sol–gel-derived silica xerogels and commercial multi-wall carbon nanotubes (purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd, China) were used as silicon and carbon sources, respectively. The preparation method of silica xerogels containing MWCNTs was similar to that described in our previous work.15 A monocrystalline n-type Si (100) substrate was etched in molten KOH at 500 °C for 5 min in a muffle furnace. After the etching process, the Si substrate was washed with deionized water, immersed in Co(NO3)2 ethanol solution (0.04 M), and dried naturally. The loose raw materials were put in an alumina boat that was located at the center of the furnace tube, and Si substrate with a thin layer of Co(NO3)2 was placed downstream at a distance of 6 cm from the center point (as illustrated in Fig. S1†). The raw materials were heated to 1425 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and maintained at this temperature for 6 h in argon gas (Ar, purity 99.999%) flow (200 sccm). The as-grown samples with a gray-black color deposited on the Si substrate were taken out for the following measurements.
The crystalline structure was characterized by using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation. A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6700F) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (Hitachi, S-4200) was employed to investigate the morphology of the products. Further structure characterization was performed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM-2010) at 200 KV. Raman spectroscopy (RENISHAW inVia) was carried out at 30 mW Ar using a green light (λ = 514 nm) laser as an excitation source. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was recorded using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature with the 325 nm line from a He–Cd laser.
Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology
Typical SEM images of as-prepared coaxial nanocables grown on a Si substrate are shown in Fig. 1 at different magnifications. A low-magnification SEM image in Fig. 1(a) shows large-scale uniform nanowires densely stacked on the substrate, which is essential in potential applications in future nanodevice designs. Fig. 1(b) reveals that the nanowires possess a coaxial nanocable structure. High-magnification SEM observations (Fig. 1(c) and (d)) further indicate that the inner nanotubes are at the top end of the nanostructures. The nanostructures have a cross section with clear concentric circles which further confirm the coaxial cable structure. The nanocables exhibit uniform dimensions along their entire lengths. The diameter of the CNTs is in the range 40–100 nm. The outlayers on the CNTs are continuous and uniform; the thickness of the outlayers ranges from 200 to 400 nm, larger than the size of the inner nanotube.

A typical XRD pattern of the as-prepared products is shown in Fig. 1(e). As can be seen, the characteristic peaks of SiC can be easily indexed as the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) reflections of 3C-SiC (JCPDS, no. 29-1129). In addition, the chemical composition of SiC@CNTs was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). As shown in Fig. 1(f), the corresponding EDS spectrum of the products demonstrates the presence of silicon and carbon. It can be inferred that the thick outlayer coated on the inner nanotube is SiC. The inner nanotube is a CNT which was used as the carbon source in the reaction. The result can be further confirmed by TEM analysis.
Further characterization of the nanostructures was carried out by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(e). The surface of a coaxial nanocable is smooth and homogeneous. A thick and solid tubular-like structure is attached to the surface of the inner nanotube. The hollow feature of this heterostructure is clearly revealed by the exposed top end. The nanocable was too thick to obtain clear HRTEM images, but good images were obtained from the exposed top end. Fig. 2(b) and (c) show the HRTEM micrograph of the top end of the nanocable marked by dotted red rectangles A and B respectively in Fig. 2(a). Two parallel walls indicate that the inner core is a nanotube. The lattice plane spacing is about 0.34 nm, which is attributed to the (002) planes of MWCNTs as shown in Fig. 2(d). Fig. 2(e) shows the HRTEM image of the outer layer marginal regions recorded from the marked area D in (b). According to the HRTEM image, the lattice plane spacing of 0.25 nm corresponds to the SiC (111) crystal plane. The morphology and composition analysis imply that they were obtained as a result of carbon nanotube confined reaction: CNTs served as the template for the continuous growth of SiC nanolayers to form SiC@CNT coaxial nanocables.

3.2 Raman and PL spectra
The Raman spectrum was recorded at room temperature using an excitation wavelength of 514 nm from an Ar+ laser (as shown in Fig. 3). The peaks at 804 cm−1 and 972 cm−1 correspond to the transverse optical (TO) phonon and longitudinal optical (LO) phonon at the Γ point of 3C-SiC, respectively. The Raman spectrum of the SiC nanostructure is different from that of bulk SiC or thick SiC films.16 It is speculated that the peak shift of the TO lines of SiC in the Raman spectrum is caused by the defects and the size confinement effect. The two peaks at around 1368 and 1582 cm−1 are typical Raman peaks of CNTs. The peak at 1368 cm−1 (D-band) indicates the existence of defective graphite layers in the CNTs.17 The peak at 1582 cm−1 (G-band) appears due to the C–C stretching Raman-active Eg mode of CNTs.18 The coexistence of the SiC phase and the graphite phase in the Raman spectrum further confirms the product is SiC@CNT.

Fig. 4 shows the room-temperature PL spectrum of the as-prepared SiC@CNT coaxial nanocables under 260 nm ultraviolet fluorescent light excitation. The PL spectrum reveals that SiC@CNT nanocables have two broad emission bands centered at 461 nm and 573 nm. The strong green emission band centered at 573 nm is similar to that of the previously reported irregular SiC tubes or SiC films.19 It may be associated with C-related deep level defects formed during the reaction process. The emission peak at 461 nm is attributed to the blue emission luminescence of SiC. The PL bands in the present SiC nanostructures are also blue-shifted relative to those of bulk SiC, which is attributed to the quantum size effects of SiC nanocables.20

PL properties of SiC nanostructures depend strongly on the growth conditions, microstructure, and morphology. The wide PL spectrum of SiC@CNT coaxial nanocables may be attributed to the existence of a special rough core–shell interface, the quantum confinement effect and the morphology effects.21 However, detailed explanation for the photoluminescence in SiC@CNT coaxial nanocables is not yet available, and further study is necessary. The intense blue-green emission properties of the SiC@CNT nanocable are of significant interest due to their potential blue-green light-emitting device applications.
3.3 Growth mechanism
To investigate the formation mechanism of SiC@CNT coaxial nanocables, their temperature-dependent growth was investigated by carbothermal reaction at 1345 °C (a), 1375 °C (b), 1425 °C (c), and 1455 °C (d) for 6 h (Fig. 5). When the reaction temperature was 1345 °C, it was found that only a few SiC nanowires were obtained, as shown in Fig. 5(a). A large amount of CNTs maintained their original state after reaction. For the product obtained at 1375 °C, a high density of cracked coaxial nanocable structures can be clearly seen on the Si substrate in Fig. 5(b). With the growth temperature increased further to 1425 °C, similar nanocable structures marked by dotted red rectangles in Fig. 5(c) were again seen. A large amount of bent and intertwined CNTs converted to straight and relatively decentralized coaxial nanocable structures which were covered by a SiC layer. At the reaction temperature of 1455 °C, nanocable structures almost disappeared and were replaced by solid rod-like structures marked by a dotted red rectangle in Fig. 5(d), revealing that higher temperature will accelerate the SiC nanorod growth and increase the yield of SiC nanorods. The diffraction peak intensities of the XRD patterns presented in Fig. 6 were gradually enhanced and the diffraction peaks became sharper with increasing reaction temperature. Along with the XRD and SEM analysis, this suggests that the structure evolution of samples can occur when the temperature is increased.

Although the detailed process of nanocable to nanorod conversion is not fully understood at the moment, the above-mentioned results indicate that SiC@CNT nanocables have been directly formed on the CNT skeleton. CNTs not only serve as a carbon source but also act as the template for the nanocable growth. A high density of nanocables was observed on the Si substrate by introducing the Co catalyst in the growth system. Interestingly, the nanocables are not obtained with a Ni catalyst under the same conditions (as shown in Fig. S2†). Therefore, we speculate that Co plays an important role in the growth of the nanocables. In general, it is difficult for SiC to nucleate on CNTs due to the inert graphene surface and small diameter of CNTs.22 However, the nanoscale Co droplets can be deposited on the surface of the carbon nanotubes to produce a catalyst layer, which can induce the growth of SiC nanostructures on the CNTs because of the high catalytic activity of Co.23
According to the above-mentioned results, the proposed growth process of SiC@CNT nanocables is illustrated in Fig. 7. In the first stage, SiO vapor is obtained by carbothermal reduction of silica xerogels by reaction (1) (in Fig. 7(a)). In the nucleation stage, nanosize liquid Si–Co–C droplets are formed by the reaction of the SiO vapors and the carbon atoms in the outer layers of remaining CNTs with the Co catalyst. After Co is sufficiently saturated with Si and C, the SiC crystallites formed by reaction (2) serve as the nucleus as shown in Fig. 7(b) which leads to SiC layer growth. However, reaction (2) does not ensure the continuous growth of SiC nanolayers. Once the nanotubes are covered with SiC nuclei, the inner CNT would be isolated by the grown SiC layer from the flowing fresh air, keeping the inner layer intact. Nevertheless, nanocables may thicken if an epitaxial growth on the surface of the as-grown SiC layers results from the reaction between SiO and CO, gas by-products of reaction (1). The generated CO2 gas from reaction (3) might react with the remaining carbon nanotubes. Thus, reactions (1) and (4) can provide the CO gas source and have a positive feedback characteristic for reaction (3). SiO2(s) + C(s) = SiO(g) + CO(g)(1) SiO(g) + 2C(s) = SiC(s) + CO(g)(2) SiO(g) + 3CO(g) = SiC(s) + 2CO2(g)(3) CO2(g) + C(s) = 2CO(g)(4)

Layer growth is a general phenomenon associated with supersaturation.25 SiC was formed layer by layer via surface diffusion of Si atoms and C atoms on the surface of carbon nanotubes.24 As a result, the SiC layer continued to grow along the length of the CNT to form a nanocable structure (Fig. 7(c). CNTs acted as a template to constrain and determined the shape morphology of the final products. Along with the SiC outlayer continuously grown on the CNTs, SiC@CNT nanocables became relatively straight which is obviously different from the curved and twisted starting carbon nanotubes. With the increase of reaction temperature, the flexibility of carbon nanotubes enhances, and consequently weakens the influence that results from the restriction of the bending footpath which provides carbon atoms.26 Therefore, the SiC@CNT nanocables grow straight at high reaction temperature.
The coaxial nanocable structure is only a transient state morphology. This type of one-dimensional growth process continues until the depletion of carbon atoms available in the CNTs by the reaction with silicon atoms at higher temperatures. Higher reaction temperature may make the carbon atoms of CNTs become so active that they can more easily react with SiO2 to produce supersaturated SiO and CO vapors. Thus, the final product became straight solid SiC nanorods. Therefore, we propose that the high growth temperature and the carbon source are a key factor for preparing the SiC nanocables and nanorods.
Conclusions
In summary, novel SiC@CNT coaxial nanocables were designed and synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reaction by using carbothermal reduction of silica xerogels and CNTs. The investigations of SiC nanostructures have been performed at the temperature range between 1345 °C and 1455 °C, and the as-prepared products have been characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman and PL spectroscopy. The growth of the SiC@CNT nanocables is attributed to the reaction of SiO with CO on excess CNT surfaces assisted by the Co catalyst. The SiC outer layer is continuous and uniform on the CNT template. This carbon related core–shell semiconductor heterostructure would be expected as potential building blocks in nanodevices.
