    , Accepted 4th November 2016First published on 7th November 2016AbstractOxygen storage materials such as ceria are used in many catalytic applications because they can reversibly bind and release oxygen. Tools are needed to observe and quantify this activity which involves a change in the cerium oxidation state and to understand the involvement of cerium in catalytic processes. To prove that cerium changes its oxidation state in the catalytic cycle the transient rates of Ce3+ formation and decay should be compared to the overall reaction rate. For such mechanistic studies the time resolution is essential as the quantification of the Ce3+ species should be faster than the reaction rate. However, it is challenging to follow the dynamic changes of the cerium oxidation state under reaction conditions, especially when the concentration of cerium atoms involved in the reaction cycle is low. In this paper, we evaluate the sensitivity of high-resolution X-ray emission-based methods for the in situ time-resolved quantification of small concentrations of Ce3+ in ceria-based materials. We demonstrate that resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) at optimal excitation energy is more sensitive than high energy resolution off-resonant spectroscopy (HEROS) and non-resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (non-resonant XES) and that it can track the reactivity of less than 0.3% of cerium atoms in a 1% Pt/CeO2 catalyst in a plug-flow reactor with sub-second time resolution. These results demonstrate that X-ray emission-based methods can be used as very sensitive tools and provide new insights into dynamic changes of the oxidation state in reducible oxides in a variety of applications.
Introduction
Ceria is an industrially important oxide because it can reversibly store and release oxygen.1 This oxygen storage capacity (OSC) renders ceria a widely used material as an additive or substrate for noble metal catalysts. It finds application amongst others in the water-gas shift reaction,2 three-way catalysis,3 soot oxidation,4 low-temperature carbon monoxide oxidation5,6 and in solar thermochemical water and carbon dioxide splitting.7 Furthermore, ceria can be applied as an antioxidant in pharmacology8 and is a promising electrode material for solid oxide fuel cells.9 Upon release of lattice oxygen, a fraction of cerium atoms reduces from Ce4+ to Ce3+ and during oxygen uptake, Ce3+ is reoxidized. Sensitive analytical tools are needed for quantifying the kinetics of cerium oxidation and reduction under working conditions of the catalyst. This is needed to understand the structure–performance relationships in a variety of ceria-containing materials and to allow a more rational design of more powerful catalysts.
During kinetic studies, heterogeneous catalysts are typically tested in a plug-flow reactor under differential conditions to ensure the homogeneous contact of the reactants and the catalyst.10 A classical plug-flow reactor is a tubular reactor which allows quantification of the catalyst performance avoiding any mass and heat transport limitations.10 Differential conditions are met when the conversion of the reactants is low enough so that all active sites in the catalyst are in contact with the same concentrations of reactants and products. Surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts are typically non-uniform in reactivity and often contain very low amounts of active sites. For example, catalytic reactions taking place at the metal-ceria interface have been shown to involve only a small fraction of cerium atoms which can be below one percent.11 To prove that Ce3+ is an active intermediate involved in the catalytic cycle it is necessary to detect it under transient conditions and correlate its reactivity with the overall rate of the catalytic process.12 For this purpose it is necessary to develop tools with very high sensitivity to cerium oxidation state changes below 1% and with a time resolution better than 1 s.
X-ray based analytical techniques are widely used for structural studies of functional materials including catalysts.13 Due to their high brilliance and tunable photon energy, synchrotron based X-ray sources are particularly suitable for time-resolved studies. Several X-ray based methods available at modern synchrotrons, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), have previously been used to investigate the reactivity of ceria based materials.14–19 Among them, XAS at the Ce L3-edge (5.723 keV) is the most commonly used for the quantification of Ce3+ in ceria-containing materials20–26 as this technique is available at most synchrotrons, can be applied in situ, and is sensitive to the Ce3+ concentration not only in the crystalline part of the catalyst but also at the disordered surface. Due to its high electron density, cerium strongly absorbs X-rays. For this reason, the amount of cerium atoms in catalysts is often too high to perform the experiment in transmission mode using a plug-flow reactor. El Fallah et al. used time-resolved transmission XAS at the Ce L3-edge to quantify the kinetics of the reversible transformation of Ce4+ into Ce3+ in ceria supported rhodium catalysts.25 In their paper the method had a time resolution of 12 s and a quantification error of 5% in the concentration of Ce3+ and Ce4+. To resolve the problem of short absorption lengths of ceria for transmission studies, a several micron thick layer of the catalyst was placed between two graphite sheets forming the flow cell. Yamamoto et al. also studied the dynamics of oxygen storage and release in Pt/Ce2Zr2O8 using energy dispersive XAS at the Ce L3 and Zr K-edges in transmission mode with a time resolution of 2 ms.26 They correlated the dynamics of the electronic and geometric structural changes in cerium and in zirconium during oxygen uptake and release. This method was sensitive to the oxidation state down to 3% of the cerium atoms. Ce K-edge XAS is more promising for transmission studies of catalysts in plug-flow reactors due to the longer absorption length of ceria at the higher Ce K-edge energy (40.443 keV). However, the K-edge of 5d elements is less sensitive to the change in the chemical state than the L3-edge. This is due to the selection rules. In K-edge spectra weak 1s–5d quadrupole transitions are hindered by much stronger dipole excitations, while the use of L-edge absorption provides direct access to dipole allowed 2p–5d excitations. Moreover, X-rays with high energies (e.g. above 30 keV) are still rarely available at synchrotrons and were used only in a few recent studies.27–29
Recently, using resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) at the Ce L3-edge and the Lα1 and Lα2 emission lines we were able to detect the kinetics of formation of less than 1% of Ce3+ in a ceria supported platinum catalyst during low temperature carbon monoxide oxidation.11 To determine whether a species is actively involved in a reaction mechanism or if it is a spectator, it is necessary to correlate its rate of formation and consumption with the global reaction rate and when they match, then the species is active in the mechanism.12 In a plug-flow reactor, we quantified the rate of Ce3+ formation with one second time resolution and correlation with the global rate of carbon monoxide oxidation showed that the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple is involved in the rate determining step. This also demonstrates that for such kinetic studies it is essential that the time-resolution of the spectroscopic technique is faster than the process it should observe.
To the best of our knowledge the time-resolved quantification of the cerium oxidation state with a second time resolution was never performed using fluorescence-detected XAS. It was recently demonstrated that high energy resolution X-ray emission methods coupled with energy-dispersive optics and position sensitive detectors are also well-suited for in situ time-resolved studies of catalysts in plug-flow reactors11,30–34 with a time resolution in the second and sub-second regime. The gas phase composition and therefore the catalytic conversion can be monitored online using mass spectrometry to allow operando type studies. High energy resolution off-resonant spectroscopy (HEROS) at the Pt L3-edge was used for example to detect intermediates at the platinum surface in a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst with sub-second time resolution during switching between reductive and oxidative conditions.35 RXES was used at the Au L3-edge and the Au Lα1 emission line to follow the reduction of Au2O3 during temperature programmed reduction in hydrogen and to detect an Au+ intermediate.32 Here, we compare the sensitivity of RXES with that of HEROS and non-resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (non-resonant XES) and define the best incident energy for the time-resolved quantification of Ce3+. The excitation energies for the different X-ray emission based techniques are schematically depicted in the X-ray absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 1. In non-resonant XES, the incident energy is far above the Ce L3-edge (some 100 eV), thus exciting a core electron into the continuum leads to an ionization of the atom (see Fig. 2). The so-formed core–hole is refilled with an electron from a higher lying orbital while emitting X-ray photons, which gives rise to the characteristic emission lines. The emission lines that correspond to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 to 2p3/2 transitions are known as Lα1 and Lα2 emission lines, respectively. In RXES, the energy of the incident photon is close (within several eV) to the absorption edge energy. The electron is excited into unoccupied bound states above the Fermi level. In the case of ceria, the Ce L3-edge absorption promotes an electron from a 2p3/2 orbital into an empty 5d orbital. While in Ce3+ a Ce 4f orbital is occupied by one electron, the 4f orbitals are empty in Ce4+ and tend to hybridize with ligand orbitals.14,36 The 5d energy level and therefore the Ce L3-edge energy depend on the oxidation state of cerium. The remaining 2p3/2 core–hole can be refilled with an electron originating from higher energy levels, such as the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 orbitals. In HEROS, the incident energy is 10–20 eV below the Ce L3-edge. The coherent nature of the excitation–emission process in the off-resonant regime allows that an excited electron takes up energy from the emitted photon and thereby the electron is promoted into unoccupied states above the Fermi level.37 The energy of the emitted photon thus contains information about the unoccupied energy states.

 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of the excitation and emission process for non-resonant XES, RXES and HEROS. In non-resonant XES, an electron is excited from a 2p3/2 level into the continuum and the 2p core hole can be refilled with an electron from 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 orbitals giving rise to the characteristic Lα1 and Lα2 emission lines. RXES shows an excitation from a 2p3/2 orbital into a free 5d orbital and a decay of electrons from 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 orbitals to the 2p core hole. In HEROS the excitation energy is lower than the binding energy of the 2p electron; however, an excited electron can take up additional energy δ from an electron decay and be promoted to above the Fermi level. Thereby the energy of the emitted photon is reduced by δ. 
All three methods use the same experimental setup. The spectrometer is based on the von Hamos geometry in which the sample, the analyzer crystal, and the detector do not move during data acquisition.38 The emitted photons are collected by the energy-dispersing analyzer crystal and imaged on a position-sensitive detector which records the full emission/fluorescence spectrum instantaneously. A scanning-free arrangement allows acquiring emission spectra with sub-eV energy and sub-second time resolution.39 Fluorescence detected XAS often deals with self-absorption effects which makes the comparison of samples with different concentrations of the element of interest and different absorption lengths difficult. In HEROS, RXES and non-resonant XES the shape of the emitted spectrum is not affected by self-absorption effects.37
Materials and methods

In situ reactor setup
The sample consisted of 1.5 wt% platinum nanoparticles supported on ceria. The ceria particles were produced by a hydrothermal method and showed a truncated octahedral shape with a high surface area (85 m2 g−1).20,40 Platinum nanoparticles with 1.2(±0.2) nm diameter on ceria were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation with tetraammine platinum(2+) nitrate (Aldrich, 99.995%). The catalyst was calcined in air (400 °C, 4 h) and reduced in a flow of 5% H2 (300 °C, 4 h), both with a heating-up rate of 5 °C min−1.20
The performance of the catalyst was tested inside a plug-flow reactor cell41 and the gas mixtures were provided by a gas mixing setup consisting of six mass flow controllers (El Flow, Bronkhorst). About 30 mg of a sieved 100–150 μm fraction of the sample were fed with 50 ml min−1 of gas mixture which corresponds to a space velocity of 1000 ml h−1 g−1 for carbon monoxide. The catalyst bed was enclosed with a 20 μm thick Kapton foil. The sample was heated with two heating cartridges (Türk Hillinger) whereas the temperature of the cell and that of the middle of the sample bed were monitored by two thermocouples.
The spectra were acquired under defined conditions at 150 °C where the catalyst was exposed to reducing (1% carbon monoxide) or oxidizing (1% oxygen) gas mixtures. The gas phase composition at the reactor cell exit was monitored using online mass spectrometry. Prior to the experiments, the sample was reduced in 1% hydrogen at 150 °C. Switches between two different gas mixtures were made by two three-way switching valves (Parker, Series 9) whereas the total flow of gas was held constant. After the switch, the gas mixture in the cell volume was completely exchanged within 2 seconds. This was checked using a mass spectrometer. For time-resolved experiments, the gas supply was switched periodically between 1% carbon monoxide and 4% oxygen in argon and 1% carbon monoxide in argon gas mixtures keeping the total flow constant and using a needle valve to correct for the pressure drop, which was less than 100 mbar. To ensure that Pt remains reduced during the switches, the temperature was kept sufficiently low to keep carbon monoxide conversion below 20%.
X-ray emission data collection
The HEROS, RXES, and non-resonant XES spectra of cerium were recorded at the SuperXAS beamline at the Swiss Light Source (PSI, Villigen, Switzerland).42 The incident photon beam was provided by a 2.9 T super-bend magnet source and collimated and harmonics rejected by a Si-coated mirror at 2.5 mrad. Monochromatic photons were selected by a Si(111) channel-cut monochromator and focusing was achieved with a rhodium-coated toroidal mirror at 2.5 mrad. The energy position was calibrated using a V foil (V K-edge at 5.465 keV). The size of the X-ray beam at the sample position was measured to be 0.1 × 0.1 mm2 with a total beam intensity of about 4 × 1011 ph s−1.
The emitted X-ray photons were energetically dispersed on a cylindrically bent Ge(400) analyzer crystal (R = 250 mm) and imaged on a single photon counting pixel array detector (Pilatus 100 K, Dectris). The sample, the crystal and the detector were arranged in a vertical von Hamos geometry.38,39 The combined incident energy resolution convoluted with the emitted energy resolution was about 1.1 eV at a Bragg angle of 65°. The absorption of X-rays by air was reduced by placing a plastic bag filled with helium in the path between the sample, the analyzer crystal, and the detector.
Energy calibration of emission spectra
The pixel array detector was calibrated by using the emission energy of the spectral features of a non-resonant XES spectrum of ceria recorded at an excitation energy of 6.000 keV. The pixels in the energy dispersive direction corresponding to the Ce Lα1 and Lα2 maxima were calibrated to the tabulated values.43 All other pixels were assigned to the corresponding energies by using linear regression.
Data acquisition and processing
Non-resonant XES, RXES and HEROS spectra were collected in an energy range between 4.780 keV and 4.900 keV. Reference emission spectra were obtained with an acquisition time of 3 min. Fig. 3 depicts the data acquisition and processing. The 2D images from the Pilatus 100 K detector were saved as tiff files. The vertical direction of the detector surface was parallel to the energy dispersive axis of the analyzer crystal and the horizontal direction was perpendicular to the focusing plane (Fig. 3). The images from the Pilatus detector were analyzed by using the RXES GUI software based on Matlab. Using the above-mentioned calibration procedure we assigned the specific emission energy to each pixel on the energy dispersive axis. To produce a 1D XES signal spectrum from each 2D image we summed the signal intensity in the focusing direction over a region of interest (20–30 pixels) containing most of the counts. From each 2D image we also produced a 1D XES background spectrum, which was subtracted from each signal spectrum. The background XES spectra were calculated by integrating the 2D images over the same number of pixels (20–30 pixels) lying aside from the main signal pixels and containing counts originating from elastic scattering. RXES planes were measured by scanning the incident energy from 5.715 keV to 5.740 keV with one eV step size. At each incident energy step, an emission spectrum in the 4.788–4.909 keV energy range was recorded with an exposure time of 30 s. For the quantification of Ce3+ in the static and transient experiments, we used two reference conditions. In 1% carbon monoxide in argon at 150 °C the Ce3+ content in the 1.5% Pt/CeO2 catalyst was 11 ± 1%. In 1% oxygen in argon at 150 °C the Ce3+ content in the 1.5% Pt/CeO2 catalyst was 0 ± 1%. These values were determined by linear combination analysis of the Ce L3 XANES spectra of the same sample and the corresponding XANES spectra of cerium(3+) nitrate hexahydrate (Sigma Aldrich) and ceria (NIST) reference samples.11
 Fig. 3  Schematic representation of data acquisition and processing of time-resolved RXES. From left to right: After excitation of the sample with a monochromatic X-ray beam, the emitted X-rays are dispersed and imaged on a pixel array detector. The resulting image is integrated along the focal direction and calibrated in the energy-dispersive direction. The resulting spectra are averaged over the switching period and processed using linear combination analysis to determine the Ce3+ concentration as a function of time. 
For time-resolved measurements the incident energy was fixed and RXES spectra were recorded with a repetition rate of 0.5 Hz during periodical changes in the gas phase composition. Afterwards, the spectra were analyzed using the RXES GUI software: the spectra were averaged according to their appearance in the switching period to produce one spectrum for every 2 s within the 180 s period and then background subtracted and normalized to the maximal intensity. The Ce3+ concentration as a function of time was determined by a linear combination fit using the entire emission spectra between 4.788 and 4.909 keV. The normalization of the XES spectra was important to correct for changes in the emission counts due to any kind of instability in the setup.
Results and discussion
Comparison of HEROS, RXES and non-resonant XES under reference conditions
First of all, we compared the reference spectra of a 1.5% Pt/CeO2 sample containing 0% Ce3+ and 100% Ce4+ under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 4). The HEROS spectra were collected by exciting the sample at 5.715 keV, which is 11 eV below the Ce L3-edge of ceria and below the resonant region. RXES spectra were recorded within the resonant region at 5.720 keV. For non-resonant XES, the incident energy was set at 6.000 keV. These three techniques were compared under identical conditions, using the same incident photon flux, measurement geometry and acquisition time. The shift in the positions of the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 levels in RXES and HEROS is due to the non-complete ionization of the absorbing atom. This can be explained by the energy conservation law: a lower incident energy leads to the emission of a lower energy photon. The intensity of the emission spectra increases as a function of energy and is about 15 times higher for non-resonant XES in comparison to HEROS. These changes are related to the probability of the absorption process which strongly increases at the absorption edge.
 Fig. 4  Comparison of non-resonant XES, RXES and HEROS. The three spectra were recorded at 150 °C and in a 1% oxygen atmosphere showing the sample with 100% Ce4+. The intensity of the non-resonant XES spectrum (black) was divided by a factor of 5 for comparison. The maxima of the non-resonant XES spectrum correspond to the cerium Lα1 and Lα2 emission lines of ceria. It can be seen that not only the maxima of the spectra change but also the shapes of the peaks and the total count rates. 
Influence of the oxidation state of cerium on HEROS, RXES and non-resonant XES
The sensitivities of the X-ray emission based techniques to the oxidation state of cerium were evaluated by comparing the difference spectra collected under oxidizing and reducing conditions. Fig. 5 compares the non-resonant XES, RXES and HEROS spectra recorded at 150 °C in 1% carbon monoxide and in 1% oxygen containing 11% and 0% Ce3+, respectively. Depending on the Ce3+ concentration, the spectra differ mainly in the shape of the main peak. To calculate the integral intensity in the spectra of the reduced and oxidized sample, Sred and Sox, we summed all counts over 101 detector-pixels in the energy-dispersive direction corresponding to a region of 62–64 eV containing the main spectral features. The difference spectrum (Diff) was produced by the subtraction of the spectrum corresponding to 0% Ce3+ from the one corresponding to 11% Ce3+. We also calculated the absolute integral counts of the difference spectrum (ΔS) according to eqn (1). (1)As each pixel of the detector is itself a single photon counting detector, the noise level (Noise) was calculated according to eqn (2) as a sum of noise levels of integral signals Sox and Sred: (2)To compare the chemical sensitivity of the three spectroscopic methods to the presence of Ce3+ we calculated the signal-to-noise ratios of the integrated difference signals (ΔSNR) defined by eqn (3). (3)For non-resonant XES, RXES and HEROS, the ΔSNR for an acquisition time of 3 min was 11, 48 and 26, respectively. From this comparison we can conclude that RXES is more sensitive to the presence of Ce3+ in ceria-based materials than non-resonant XES and HEROS. Non-resonant XES shows the highest overall count rates, nonetheless, the method has the lowest sensitivity to the presence of Ce3+. We have not tested the efficiencies of all X-ray emission processes for the Ce3+ quantification. Considering the absorption cross-sections, a promising alternative to the RXES process presented in this work can be the excitation close to the Ce L2-edge and RXES detection in the energy region close to the Ce Lβ1 line.
 Fig. 5  Comparison of the (a) non-resonant XES, (b) RXES and (c) HEROS spectra under oxidizing (black, in 1% oxygen) and reducing (red, in 1% carbon monoxide) conditions and the corresponding difference spectra. Integral counts were calculated between 4.803 and 4.867 keV for non-resonant XES, between 4.791 and 4.853 keV for RXES and between 4.779 to 4.841 keV for HEROS. 
RXES planes and optimal excitation energy
RXES has shown the highest sensitivity to the presence of Ce3+ in ceria-based materials. In a next step the incident excitation energy was optimized to further increase the sensitivity of this method. We recorded the RXES spectra while scanning the incident energy between 5.715 keV and 5.740 keV. The corresponding 2D RXES planes were acquired on the same sample, which depending on the conditions contained either 11% Ce3+ or 0% Ce3+. Fig. 6 shows a RXES plane recorded under reducing conditions together with an extracted absorption spectrum in the right inset and extracted emission spectra in the upper inset of the figure. The partial fluorescence yield (or high-energy-resolution) X-ray absorption spectrum was obtained by integration of the emission intensity in the energy region between 4.837 keV and 4.843 keV. The emission spectra were obtained by cutting the 2D plane at fixed incident energies indicated in the legend of the emission spectra. The main peaks correspond to the transitions from 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 to 2p3/2 as already discussed in the previous section. The RXES spectrum which was recorded by excitation at the white line energy (5.732 keV) shows the highest count rate in comparison to all other RXES spectra. The spectra which were recorded below the white line (5.715 keV and 5.726 keV) show lower intensities and a slight peak shift to lower emission energies due to the energy conservation law.
 Fig. 6  RXES plane of 1.5 wt% Pt/CeO2 measured in 1% carbon monoxide at 150 °C. The incident energy was scanned around the Ce L3 edge from 5.715–5.740 keV and the X-ray emission was recorded from 4.788 keV to 4.909 keV. The emission energy scale is inverted. The right panel shows a partial fluorescence yield XAS spectrum which was obtained by integration over the maximal emission line (4.845–4.833 keV). 
The ΔRXES (difference) 2D plane shown in Fig. 7 was calculated by the subtraction of the RXES plane of the sample containing 0% Ce3+ from the one of the sample containing 11% Ce3+. As expected, the partial fluorescence yield XAS difference spectrum in Fig. 7 shows that in the presence of Ce3+ the absorption edge shifts to lower energies. Concerning RXES, the highest signal difference and ΔSNR were observed upon excitation at the inflection point of the absorption edge of ceria at 5.726 keV. Excitation at energies below or above this energy decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. As suggested before, a deviation of 1–2 eV from optimal excitation energy has a major influence on the chemical sensitivity of this spectroscopic method. The ΔSNR for RXES spectra excited at 5.722 keV, which was used in our previous work,11 is 2.5 times lower than that for RXES spectra excited at an optimal excitation energy of 5.726 keV. If noise depends only on the statistics of the detector, then using optimal excitation energy should reduce the required acquisition time by a factor of 6.

The vertical axis represents the incident energy and the horizontal axis shows the emission energy. The upper inset shows the difference emission spectra at different incident energies. The right panel shows an X-ray absorption spectrum which is obtained by integrating over the emission energies between 4.837 keV and 4.843 keV. 
Time-resolved RXES measurements
Under steady-state conditions during catalytic reactions, it is often impossible to observe catalytically active intermediates because their concentrations can be low and they can be short-lived, which is the case for active Ce3+ species at the Pt–CeO2 interface.11 In our previous work, we used transient RXES to detect short-lived Ce3+ intermediates, to correlate the rate of their formation with the overall rate of carbon monoxide oxidation, and to distinguish between active and spectator Ce3+ species. In the present study, we performed a similar transient RXES experiment under similar conditions; this time, however, we used an optimal incident energy of 5.726 keV instead of 5.722 keV. The ultimate goal was to check, which signal-to-noise level can be achieved at the optimized energy. We thus placed the 1.5% Pt/CeO2 catalyst in a plug-flow reactor cell and periodically switched between 1% carbon monoxide and 4% oxygen in argon and 1% carbon monoxide in argon. In each cycle, the sample was spending 120 s in 1% carbon monoxide for the generation of Ce3+ (reductive part) and then 60 s in 1% carbon monoxide/4% oxygen to reoxidize Ce3+ back to Ce4+. The spectra were recorded for 80 cycles corresponding to 4 h. The measured time-resolved RXES spectra were processed and linear combination analysis in the entire energy region revealed the transient Ce3+ concentration as a function of time shown in Fig. 8. During periodic cycling, the Ce3+ concentration changed between 1.5% and 3%. The difference of 1.5% Ce3+ was detected with a noise level of 0.3% Ce3+. The noise level was determined as the standard deviation of the signal under steady state conditions. We considered that between 150 and 180 s the catalyst was under steady state conditions since the catalytic performance was stable and the concentration of Ce3+ was almost constant. The noise level was similar to our previous RXES experiment using similar acquisition times.11 It seems that the current detection limit of 0.3% Ce3+ cannot be further reduced due to some non-statistical noise. This can be due to tiny displacements of the 100–150 μm catalyst particles in the plug-flow reactor during gas switches in combination with a small beam size (100 × 100 μm) and a very low penetration length of X-rays at the Ce L3-edge in a concentrated sample. One might try to solve this problem by defocusing the beam in the horizontal direction which is not important for the energy dispersive detection but could decrease the noise related to the sample displacement.
 Fig. 8  Transient Ce3+ concentration as a function of time measured at 31 °C. The transient Ce3+ concentration was obtained by linear combination fitting of the entire RXES spectra collected at an incident energy of 5.726 keV. Ceria was reduced in 1% CO from 0–120 s and reoxidized in 1% CO and 4% O2 from 120–180 s. 
The components of the experimental setup presented in this work are commercially available and therefore the experimental method can be implemented at various synchrotron beamlines delivering monochromatic hard X-rays. This method can be extended to other ceria-containing catalysts in a wide range of reactions. The efficiency of the X-ray detection can be further improved by using a von Hamos type spectrometer covering higher solid angles. The time resolution can be further improved especially at facilities which provide higher X-ray flux by using a Pilatus detector which is able to collect images with a frequency of 1 kHz.
Conclusions
We presented a highly sensitive spectroscopic tool for in situ and time-resolved kinetic studies of ceria-based materials. We evaluated the sensitivity of HEROS, RXES and non-resonant XES at different incident energies close to the Ce L3-edge for the discrimination of Ce3+ and Ce4+ in mixed valence ceria-based compounds. All three methods demonstrated sensitivity to the oxidation state of ceria. Although non-resonant XES spectra showed the highest overall count rates, RXES demonstrated the highest potential for discriminating between oxidized and partially reduced ceria. Time-resolved RXES allows monitoring oxidation state changes of less than 1% of cerium atoms under differential conditions in a plug-flow reactor similar to standard laboratory reactors. We demonstrated the power of time-resolved RXES by observing the formation of the active Ce3+ species in ceria-based platinum catalysts during low-temperature carbon monoxide oxidation. This is a major advancement in the chemical sensitivity allowing monitoring the reactivity of cerium atoms at metal-support interfaces. A time resolution faster than the rate determining step of the catalytic reaction is essential to prove that Ce3+ species are catalytically relevant intermediates.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Ce L3-edge XANES spectrum of ceria recorded in transmission mode. The dashed lines correspond to the excitation energies used for recording HEROS, RXES and non-resonant XES spectra.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematic representation of the excitation and emission process for non-resonant XES, RXES and HEROS. In non-resonant XES, an electron is excited from a 2p3/2 level into the continuum and the 2p core hole can be refilled with an electron from 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 orbitals giving rise to the characteristic Lα1 and Lα2 emission lines. RXES shows an excitation from a 2p3/2 orbital into a free 5d orbital and a decay of electrons from 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 orbitals to the 2p core hole. In HEROS the excitation energy is lower than the binding energy of the 2p electron; however, an excited electron can take up additional energy δ from an electron decay and be promoted to above the Fermi level. Thereby the energy of the emitted photon is reduced by δ.	 

 	Fig. 3  Schematic representation of data acquisition and processing of time-resolved RXES. From left to right: After excitation of the sample with a monochromatic X-ray beam, the emitted X-rays are dispersed and imaged on a pixel array detector. The resulting image is integrated along the focal direction and calibrated in the energy-dispersive direction. The resulting spectra are averaged over the switching period and processed using linear combination analysis to determine the Ce3+ concentration as a function of time.	 

 	Fig. 4  Comparison of non-resonant XES, RXES and HEROS. The three spectra were recorded at 150 °C and in a 1% oxygen atmosphere showing the sample with 100% Ce4+. The intensity of the non-resonant XES spectrum (black) was divided by a factor of 5 for comparison. The maxima of the non-resonant XES spectrum correspond to the cerium Lα1 and Lα2 emission lines of ceria. It can be seen that not only the maxima of the spectra change but also the shapes of the peaks and the total count rates.

 	Fig. 5  Comparison of the (a) non-resonant XES, (b) RXES and (c) HEROS spectra under oxidizing (black, in 1% oxygen) and reducing (red, in 1% carbon monoxide) conditions and the corresponding difference spectra. Integral counts were calculated between 4.803 and 4.867 keV for non-resonant XES, between 4.791 and 4.853 keV for RXES and between 4.779 to 4.841 keV for HEROS.	 

 	Fig. 6  RXES plane of 1.5 wt% Pt/CeO2 measured in 1% carbon monoxide at 150 °C. The incident energy was scanned around the Ce L3 edge from 5.715–5.740 keV and the X-ray emission was recorded from 4.788 keV to 4.909 keV. The emission energy scale is inverted. The right panel shows a partial fluorescence yield XAS spectrum which was obtained by integration over the maximal emission line (4.845–4.833 keV).	 

 	Fig. 7  ΔRXES plane showing the difference between the partially reduced catalyst with 11% Ce3+ in a 1% carbon monoxide atmosphere and the fully oxidized catalyst with 0% Ce3+ in 1% oxygen. The vertical axis represents the incident energy and the horizontal axis shows the emission energy. The upper inset shows the difference emission spectra at different incident energies. The right panel shows an X-ray absorption spectrum which is obtained by integrating over the emission energies between 4.837 keV and 4.843 keV.	 

 	Fig. 8  Transient Ce3+ concentration as a function of time measured at 31 °C. The transient Ce3+ concentration was obtained by linear combination fitting of the entire RXES spectra collected at an incident energy of 5.726 keV. Ceria was reduced in 1% CO from 0–120 s and reoxidized in 1% CO and 4% O2 from 120–180 s.
