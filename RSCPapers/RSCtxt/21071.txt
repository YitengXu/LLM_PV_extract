However, the absorption spectrum of PSII limits the quantum efficiency in the range of visible light, due to a gap in the green absorption region of chlorophylls (500–600 nm). To overcome this limitation, we have stabilized the interaction between PSII and Phycobilisomes (PBSs) – the cyanobacterial light harvesting complex, in vitro. The PBS of three different cyanobacteria (Acaryochloris marina, Am, Mastigocladus laminosus, ML, and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Syn) are analyzed for their ability to transfer energy to Thermosynechococcus elongatus (Te) PSII by fluorescence spill-over and photo-current action spectra. Integration of the PBS–PSII super-complexes within an Os-complex-modified hydrogel on macro-porous indium tin oxide electrodes (MP-ITO) resulted in notably improved, wavelength dependent, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCE). IPCE values in the green gap were doubled from 3% to 6% compared to PSII electrodes without PBS and a maximum IPCE up to 10.9% at 670 nm was achieved.
Introduction
Solar energy is one of the most valuable energy sources to overcome the emission of deleterious pollutants that fossil fuel energy production inevitably generates.1 Nature has continuously evolved and improved the mechanisms which transform solar energy into chemical energy in the process of photosynthesis.2 Consequently, various systems for solar energy conversion like semiartificial bio-photovoltaics3,4 or photo-electrochemical cells5,6 have been reported that are based on highly efficient photosynthetic proteins, i.e. photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII).5,7
Due to its unique light-induced water splitting activity, PSII is of major interest in such devices since H2O acts as an abundant and renewable electron source. PSII is a multi-subunit transmembrane protein complex and located within the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria, algae and plants.8 The initial step in light-driven charge separation of linear photosynthetic electron transfer is induced at the reaction center P680 of PSII. Electrons are further transferred via pheophytin and two plastoquinones (QA and QB), resulting in the reduction and protonation of plastoquinone in vivo.9 The resulting P680+ cation is reduced by the step-wise oxidation of water by the Mn4CaO5 cluster within PSII.10 Compared to a direct electric communication between the photoactive enzyme complex and the electrode surface that depends on the orientation of the enzyme, the use of redox hydrogels as immobilization matrix ensures a substantially more efficient electron transfer (ET) towards the electrode surface.4,11 ET in redox hydrogels follows an undirected electron hopping mechanism with high charge transfer rates.12 The electron shuttling process is independent of the biocatalyst's orientation and renders effective wiring in PSII based photoanodes.3,13 Electrons are transferred via both plastoquinones (QA and QB) of PSII to the Os-complex modified redox hydrogels.14 Moreover, tailor-made porous 3D electrode materials have been proven recently to act as efficient electrode supports in PSII photovoltaic devices.13,15,16 The main advantages of porous electrodes are higher protein loadings on the electrode surface15 and a more stable protein/hydrogel interaction13 as well as a more efficient wiring of the redox hydrogel matrix compared to flat electrodes.13
Thermophilic cyanobacteria like Thermosynechococcus elongatus (Te) are well suited for the isolation of intact PSII complexes.17–19 However, cyanobacterial PSII contains only chlorophyll (Chl a) as photoactive cofactors, thus resulting in a restricted absorption spectrum of visible light,18 in a wavelength range between 400–450 nm (Soret) and 650–700 nm (Qy) excitation bands.
Cyanobacteria, red algae and glaucophytes are oxygenic photosynthetic organisms that utilize phycobilisomes (PBS) as their major light harvesting antenna. Unlike PSII, PBS is not membrane-integrated, but rather water-soluble and membrane peripherally-associated. It interacts with PSII on the cytoplasmic side of the thylakoid membrane in a highly packed manner.20 Moreover, PBS is a multi-subunit complex ranging from 1 MDa to 17 MDa (depending on species), which is comprised of mostly-chromophorylated subunits called phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The PBPs composition is species-dependent, but in almost all cases contains allophycocyanin (APC, λmax = 652 nm) at the inner core quaternary domain and phycocyanin (PC, λmax = 620 nm) at the peripheral rod quaternary domain, flanking the core domain. In addition to these major PBPs, all PBSs also contain linker proteins (LP) which serve as an energy-tuning skeleton for the PBPs surrounding it.21 Some organisms possess additional PBPs (i.e. phycoerythrocyanin, λmax = 575 nm or phycoerythrin, λmax = 560 nm) which are always assembled within the rod domain, distal to PC and even more so to APC. As the spatial position of these PBPs within the PBS complex correspond to their energy transfer scheme (PE/PEC to PC to APC), the PBS is well-designed to channel its absorption amplification towards Chl a found within PSII. Thus, the PBS filling exquisitely the spectroscopic idle region spans between the Soret and Qy excitation bands of Chl a, embedded within PSII.

In vitro reconstitution of a PBS-PSII super-complex is particularly challenging due to its large size and the varying demands on buffer conditions. However, it enables combining material from different species and thereby facilitates specific engineering of the super-complex dependent on the desired photoanode properties. The proof-of-concept for an inter-organism interaction between PBS and PSII was demonstrated by showing that even reconstitution of the prokaryotic PBS with eukaryotic PSII is possible.22 Since then, various in vivo and in vitro studies were performed, all proving photo-activity of PBS-PSII super-complex via indirect fluorescence measurements.23
The approach proposed here demonstrates the benefit of integrating light harvesting complexes to already-established systems for enhanced bio-photocurrent generation under various excitation wavelengths. We stabilized robust inter-organism super-complexes by strengthening the PBS–PSII interaction in vitro using a cross-linking procedure. These super-complexes were embedded into an Os-complex-modified redox hydrogel, which allows fast and efficient electron transfer from PSII to a microporous electrode in an all-immobilized state. We were able to demonstrate improved light harvesting of the PBS–PSII super-complex by detection of an enhanced fluorescence spillover and an increased PSII photocurrent. This results in an improvement of absolute IPCE values gained from PBS–PSII modified photoanodes.
Results and discussion
Low temperature fluorescence emission spectra of interspecies PBS–PSII energy transfer
We focused on the in vitro formation of PBS–PSII super-complexes to increase the quantum efficiency of a semiartificial bio-photoanode. The PBS complexes from Acaryochloris marina (AmPBS), Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (SynPBS) and Mastigocladus laminosus (MLPBS) as well as PSII from Thermosynechococcus elongatus were purified following established methods.19,24 The formation of PBS–PSII super-complexes was analyzed by low-temperature fluorescence emission spectroscopy. PBS was selectively excited at 580 nm and fluorescence emission of PSII was detected between 600 and 700 nm in diluted or crosslinked (see Methods for more details) samples (Fig. 1). In isolated form, AmPBS exhibits an emission peak at 665 nm for the fully-assembled, functional PBS complexes. When disassembled into its trimeric constituents, the emission is blue shifted to 645 nm (Fig. 1A). For MLPBS peaks with 660 nm for fully assembled and 621 nm for partially disassembled complex are detected respectively (Fig. 1C). Fully assembled SynPBS exhibits slightly red-shifted emission at 670 nm while when disassembled emission was measured at 646 nm (Fig. 1E). These spectroscopic signatures are an indication that energy transfer does not occur all the way towards the terminal emitter of the respective PBSs but is rather emitted at the first component of the disassembled complex – trimers of PC (in the case of AmPBS and SynPBS) or trimers of PEC (in the case of MLPBS). Fluorescence peaks at 685 nm indicative for PSII emission are not observed in these samples, whereas an interaction in highly concentrated protein solutions could be demonstrated (Fig. S1†). Therefore, we applied chemical crosslinkers to stabilize the formation of PBS–PSII super-complexes in low concentrated samples. The crosslinker glutaraldehyde did not lead to any functional stabilization of the super-complex (data not shown), but 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) strengthened the interaction of PBS–PSII super-complexes. BDDE is a short epoxide-type linker molecule,25 like poly (ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE), which is commonly used to crosslink amino-modified hydrogel backbones (vide infra).3,4,11 Different concentrations of BDDE have been analyzed. Surprisingly, the best stabilization was achieved by pre-incubation of PBS in highly concentrated BDDE (Fig. 1B, D and F). This leads to a decorating effect by which, in some cases, only one reactive epoxide group binds to the PBS surface, while additional intra-PBS crosslinks most likely occur as well. After dialysis and addition of PSII, the second epoxide reacts with the photosynthetic complex and stabilization of the super-complex is attained within several minutes (Fig. 1B, D and F). The introduced crosslinked adduct shows a constant PSII fluorescence and thoroughly stabilizes the complex in diluted mixtures. The initial measurement (0 min) of AmPBS–PSII interaction shows a peak at 665 nm but no fluorescence at 685 nm. The peak at 665 nm vanishes after 5 min incubation, simultaneously a fluorescence peak at 685 nm appeared. This indicates a short delay in super-complex formation for the AmPBS–PSII sample.

The super-complexes can be kept on ice, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C without decomposition (Fig. S2†). This enables the measurement of a single super-complex formation by various techniques.
Photocurrent action spectra of PSII/P–Os on Au electrodes
The emission spectra indicate that energy transfer occurs from PBS to PSII in the stabilized complexes, which allows us to further investigate the resulting charge separation of P680 by electrochemical studies. The photocurrent action spectrum of PSII has been characterized in various studies and shows a significant similarity to its absorption spectrum.13,26 Here, we use the wavelength-dependent photocurrent response of a PSII modified electrode to determine PSII action spectra (Fig. S3†). All measured light-induced currents can be further translated to incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as a function of the light intensities at each wavelength (Table S1†).
Calculated from the observed photocurrent and light intensity at 10 nm wavelength steps, the IPCE represents a convenient value to investigate the wavelength-dependent quantum efficiency of PSII (Fig. 2A). Thus, PSII was immobilized on flat Au-electrodes in a standard drop cast process by means of the redox hydrogel P–Os (poly(1-vinylimidazole-co-allylamine)-[Os(II)(bpy)2Cl]Cl; with bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine), that exhibits a redox potential of around +0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) (Fig. S4†) and serves as immobilization matrix as well as electron relay for the electrical connection of the enzyme to the electrode surface in a mediated electron transfer regime. This polymer has proven earlier to be an efficient immobilization and wiring matrix for PSII (note that the redox potential of the polymer is significantly more positive than those of the electron donor site in PSII, thus the polymer provides a significant thermodynamic driving force for an efficient electron transfer).4,11,13 The measured photocurrents at an applied potential of +0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) between 500–660 nm already increase slightly compared to the absorption spectrum (Fig. 2A), which is in good agreement with the increase in IPCE values at the given wavelengths.13

PBS-related functional improvement of PSII/P–Os
Albeit the absolute IPCE values vary from electrode to electrode, the relative quantum efficiency (QE) of a certain modification is comparable between preparations. Hence the IPCE was measured in the range from 500–700 nm and normalized to the value at 670 nm (QE670nm), as the highest IPCE values were measured for PSII without PBS modification at this wavelength (Fig. 2B). The increase of relative QE indicates a positive effect of PBS interaction. The different solubilization conditions of PBS and PSII have urged us to apply sequential cross-linking. First, we decorated the PBS with cross-linker, then interacted it with PSII. Therefore, due to the stochastic nature of the cross-linking manipulation, one could expect that the cross-linked PBS–PSII super-complex would not always result in a functional interaction architecture. This was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy examinations of the cross-linked super-complex. It can be observed that the PBS cylinder binds to the PSII dimer in various conformations, as well as the formation of very large PBS–PSII aggregates (Fig. S5†). As energy transfer is highly dependent on distance and orientation between the donor and the acceptor, it is very likely that not all PBS–PSII super-complexes are contributing to the observed photo-induced activity. This could explain the moderate increase in relative quantum efficiency due to PBS absorption. To verify the effect of PBS, difference action-spectra of PBS–PSII/P–Os and PSII/P–Os are compared to the absorption spectra of the isolated PBS. Albeit SynPBS and MLPBS show an increase in relative quantum efficiency, the difference spectra are not in good compliance with the respective absorption spectra (Fig. 2D and E). The increase might be related to partially disassembled PBS interacting with PSII which is supported by a relative fluorescence decrease at related peaks (Fig. 1C and E). The absorbance spectrum of AmPBS and difference spectrum ΔQE670nm of AmPBS–PSII in comparison to PSII are coherent in shape and the given peak maxima (Fig. 2C). Evidently, the similarity of AmPBS absorption spectra and QE670nm difference spectra seems to be a strong evidence for a functional super-complex of AmPBS and PSII, which was further corroborated by free flow electrophoresis (Fig. S6†). The results indicate formation of a larger PBS–PSII super-complex with PSII specific fluorescence emission that is only present in the crosslinked sample.
Improved stability and quantum efficiency on MP-ITO electrodes
Concerning the limited capacity of effectively wired enzymes on a flat Au electrode, the absolute IPCE values drop significantly with the application of large PBS complexes (Table 1). Most likely due to a destabilizing effect of the bulky super-complexes on the film integrity on the flat electrode surface12 and/or due to a hampered electron transport within the film induced again by the large PBS complexes that may block electron transport pathways within the layer (disconnected polymer domains).

Hence, transparent 3D macro-porous ITO electrodes (MP-ITO) were fabricated and optimized to stabilize and enhance the loading of PBS–PSII/P–Os films (Fig. S7†). MP-ITO electrodes were prepared by spray-coating of an ITO nanoparticle (diameter < 50 nm) solution containing polystyrene polymer beads (diameter = 1 μm) as templates. After removal of the polymer beads in a pyrolytic process, the resulting macro-porous transparent electrode structures were modified with a PBS–PSII/P–Os mixture (Fig. 3).

(Green circle) Focus on electron transfer from PSII towards electrode surface via redox-active Os-complexes within the hydrogel by electron hopping mechanism. 
Adaptation of the MP-ITO pore sizes allows an optimized interaction with varying PBS–PSII/P–Os surface modifications.27 Structures that were produced with templates with diameters of 1 μm showed the best interaction with PBS–PSII/P–Os, as derived from tests with ITO electrodes obtained with polymer beads of different diameters (data not shown). These electrodes show pore openings on the surface of the MP-ITO layer with diameters of 590 to 960 nm (Fig. S7a and b†) and absolute pore diameters that are slightly smaller than 1 μm (Fig. S7c and d†). The large pore openings should allow an unhindered penetration of the polymer and enzyme super complex, since these pore channels are significantly larger than those reported for similar 3D structured ITO electrodes (150 nm) that were modified with the same Os complex-modified polymer and for which penetration was already proven.13 Drop-cast PBS–PSII/P–Os mixtures show a high stability after immobilization on the MP-ITOs ensuring a high loading capacity with PBS–PSII/P–Os. Combination of PBS and PSII embedded within P–Os on MP-ITO results in IPCE values of up to 10.9% (AmPBS–PSII/P–Os) at 670 nm (Fig. 4A). These are competing with the highest reported IPCE values for a PSII-based photobioanode so far (Table S2†). A determination of the half-life period of PSII shows that the improved IPCE values are not depending on a stabilizing effect of PBS interaction on PSII28 (Table S3†). The exact mechanism leading to improved IPCE values above a wavelength of 670 nm needs to be investigated. PBS modification shows a significant IPCE improvement not only at wavelengths of PSII absorption but also nearly doubling the absolute IPCE value from 3% to 6% at 620 nm. Normalization on QE670nm depicts PBS-related effects independent on improved quantum efficiencies and shows an improvement of relative QE as well (Fig. 4B).

P–Os-embedded PBS without PSII were tested as control (Fig. S8†). These electrodes show light-induced background currents below 500 nm due to a minor photoactivity of the hydrogel and the electrode itself. However, their absolute photocurrents values are small and thus represent only a small contribution to the overall activity (<0.15 μA cm−2) that is negligible in comparison to the light-induced PSII currents (>10 μA cm−2 for all PSII-containing modifications). At illumination above 500 nm, no photocurrents are detected for the controls, which demonstrates that all used PBS complexes are electrochemically inactive.
Conclusions
The present study introduces a novel approach of optimizing PSII-based photoanodes by modification of the photoactive element with PBS to broaden the overall light absorbance in the visible range. This enabled the design of a photoanode with improved quantum efficiency for visible light. Hence, a new field of biological optimization of semiartificial photovoltaics is suggested. The application of MP-ITO electrodes (large surface area, high catalyst loading) and redox polymers (efficient wiring) allows reliable measurements of gigantic complexes of up to 10 MDa and results in IPCE values of above 10% under monochromatic illumination competing with the highest PSII-related anodic external quantum efficiencies reported so far. Moreover, the first photoactive in vitro inter-species PBS–PSII interaction of isolated protein complexes was demonstrated. Future studies will focus on the crosslinking mechanism and the separation of the different PBS–PSII sub-species of super-complex formation. It can be anticipated that a rational design of minimized PBS antenna complexes might enable the exploitation of additional wavelengths and the fabrication of photoanodes with high catalyst loading due to a lower structural demand of the bio-complex. Furthermore, our approach enables the rational design of bio-photovoltaic devices based on PBS–PSII anodes that can be coupled to modified photocathodes for energy conversion or solar-driven fuel production (e.g. H2 production) in future studies.
Experimental methods
Protein purification and polymer synthesis

Thylakoid preparation from Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1. 
Intact dimeric PSII complexes were isolated from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (T. elongatus; Te) according to Kuhl et al. 2000.19 The cells were grown in a 20 L foil fermenter (Bioengineering, Switzerland) in BG-11 medium supplemented with 5% CO2 in air at 45 °C and illuminated with white light of increasing intensity (20–100 μE). Cells were harvested at an OD680 of 3–3.5 by a hollow fiber system (Amicon DC10 LA) and centrifugation for 20 min at 6800×g (Beckman Coulter, JLA 8.1000). The pellet was resuspended in cell storage buffer (20 mM MES pH 6.5, 20% [w v−1] glycerin, 10 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2) and kept at −80 °C until used. Cells were washed twice for 15 min at 4 °C with 9000×g (Sorvall; GSA) and resuspended in buffer B (20 mM MES, pH 6.5, 10 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 500 mM mannitol). 0.2% [w v−1] lysozyme was added, and the cells were incubated on a shaker (180 rpm) in the dark at 37 °C for 75 min. After addition of DNase the cells were disrupted by Parr bomb, pelleted and washed twice in buffer B at 20000×g for 15 min at 4 °C (Sorvall, GSA). The thylakoid membranes were frozen in buffer B + 20% [v v−1] glycerin in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used.


PSII isolation. 
Thylakoid membranes were washed with buffer B (Sorvall, SS34, 30 min, 4 °C, 20000×g) and pelleted in a 2nd washing step with buffer B + 0.05% [w v−1] β-dodecyl-D-maltoside (β-DM). The pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1.2% [w v−1] β-DM, 0.5% [w v−1] sodium cholate) at a concentration of 1 mgChl mL−1 and incubated in the dark for 30 min at RT. After ultra-centrifugation for 60 min at 4 °C and 125000×g (L8-80M ultracentrifuge, Ti60) the PSII containing supernatant was loaded onto a sucrose cushion (0.4 M) containing buffer B + 0.03% β-DM and ultra-centrifuged for 18 h at 4 °C and 82000×g (L8-80M ultracentrifuge, Ti60). Chlorophyll containing bands of the sucrose gradient were further purified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). In a first step a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) column (POROS OH 52 mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) incorporated in an HPLC-system (ÄKTA purifier, GE Healthcare, Sweden) was used. PSII-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 mL by a stirred cell (Amicon 8050) with a MWCO of 30 kDa (Ultracel-30 membrane, EMD Millipore Coop., USA) followed by a desalting column (HiPrep 26/10 Desalting, GE Healthcare, Sweden) to remove high concentration of (NH4)2SO4. Subsequently the sample was further purified by an anion exchange column (UNO Q6R, Bio Rad, Germany) and fractions containing active dimeric PSII were pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of 3.5 mgChl mL−1. Purified PSII shows an oxygen evolving activity of approximately 5000 μmol O2 h−1 mgChl−1 and was characterized by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.


PBS isolation from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Acaryochloris marina and Mastigocladus laminosus. 

Synechocystis PCC 6803 (Synechocystis; Syn), Acaryochloris marina (A. marina; Am) and Mastigocladus laminosus (M. laminosus; ML) cells were grown in BG11/BG11/MBG11 (Syn/ML/Am) medium supplemented with 5% CO2 in air at 27 °C/55 °C/27 °C (Syn/ML/Am) under fluorescent lights. Cells were grown for a week and then collected by centrifugation at 6000×g for 15 min and then kept at −20 °C until used. Cells were resuspended in 0.9 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), incubated with 1 mg mL−1 lysozyme for 2 h at RT in the dark, pelleted, resuspended and homogenized in 0.9 M phosphate buffer. Subsequently, cells were disrupted by a microfluidizer (M-110S) at maximal pressure followed by 15 min of centrifugation at 1200×g (Sorvall; SL-250T) to discard the unbroken cell fraction. The blue-green supernatant was then incubated with 2% (v v−1) Triton-X100 for 90 min at RT and then centrifuged for 45 min at 27500×g (Sorvall; SL-250T). PBS containing supernatant was separated from the thylakoid membranes, then loaded onto a step sucrose gradient (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.5 M)/(0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.5 M)/(0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.2 M), (Syn/ML/Am) containing 0.9 M phosphate buffer and centrifuged for 15 h at 165000×g (Beckman; type 70 Ti rotor). PBS-containing bands were carefully collected from gradient and analyzed by absorbance and fluorescence measurements.

PBS were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 500 μM 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) in a 0.9 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7.5). Excess BDDE was removed over night by dialysis (12–14000 Da cutoff). PSII and PBS/BDDE were mixed in a molar ratio of 10:1 unless stated otherwise. Except for time-resolved fluorescence measurements, the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in the dark and used for electrode modification or biophysical methods.


Synthesis of the redox-hydrogel P–Os. 
The synthesis of the redox-hydrogel poly(1-vinylimidazole-co-allylamine)-[Os(II) (bpy)2Cl]Cl, with bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, (P–Os) has been described previously.29 In brief, the poly(1-vinylimidazole-co-allylamine) backbone11 was modified with the precursor cis-Os(bpy)2Cl2 by stirring a mixture (weight ratio 1:1.65) dissolved in ethanol at 90 °C for several days. The crude polymer was precipitated by adding diethyl ether and washed several times with diethyl ether. The polymer was purified by multiple precipitations from chloroform ethanol mixtures.29 The water-soluble polymer was used as aqueous stock solution of 10 mg mL−1.

Electrochemical measurements

Manufacturing MP-ITO electrodes. 
ITO-coated glass (15–25 Ω sq−1, Sigma Aldrich) was cut in squares of 5 mm × 10 mm × 1.1 mm. The pieces were ultrasonicated in absolute ethanol for 15 min, immersed in ultrapure water for further 20 min and dried under air. Afterwards, the ITO electrodes were masked with copper tape (Scotch, 1181) to generate a free ITO area of 5 mm × 5 mm. For modification of the free ITO area, the electrodes were fixed on a solid copper heating block and heated up to 70 °C. Initially, a first thin layer of only ITO nanoparticles dissolved in methanol (2 mg mL−1) was sprayed over the glass surface. Polystyrene-based spherical polymer beads of 1 μm diameter (5100A, Thermo Fisher) were mixed with ITO nanoparticles (<50 nm, Sigma Aldrich, 544876) in a 1:1 mass-ratio and suspended in methanol to achieve a final concentration of 2 mg mL−1. Under heavy stirring, the suspension was sprayed in small volumes onto the electrode surface, following a previously programmed automatic procedure. For this, a home-built spray-coating device, equipped with a syringe pump, a three-dimensional moveable robot arm and a compressed air nozzle to form fine aerosols was utilized.30 A customized software, based on Microsoft Visual Basic 6, was used to adjust the spray parameters depending on the area to be modified area (electrode size and amount) and the number and density of sprayed layers (desired thickness, increment between two sprayed spots, pumping volume and speed). The spray nozzle was moved in an x/y-array at a fixed z-height of 7 cm tip- to-sample distance and kept at a pressure of 10 psi (diameter of spray tip = 1 mm). In each run, a batch of 20 samples, covered with 5 subsequently sprayed MP-ITO/polymer bead layers could be prepared.
For removal of the polystyrene-based template beads, the covered ITO glass slides were placed in a tube furnace and heated to 150 °C in air with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, followed by a slower heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to achieve a final temperature of 300 °C. This temperature was hold for at least 90 min to ensure the complete removal of the polymer templates. Afterwards, the oven was slowly cooled down to room temperature and the electrodes were removed. Investigation of the electrodes by means of scanning electron microscopy shows a complete removal of the template beads and the successful fabrication of mesoporous ITO electrodes with a layer thickness of 15–18 μm (Fig. S7†). The diameter of the pores was estimated to be around 1 μm ,which nicely matches the diameter of the used polymer beads. This indicates that the formed free-standing ITO structure is stable and not prone to collapse.


Electrode modification. 
Au electrodes (0.03 cm2) and MP-ITO electrodes (projected surface area = 0.25 cm2) were coated with a mixture of PSII, PBS, crosslinker and the Os-complex modified redox hydrogel P–Os. The films were assembled as follows: PSII and PBS were crosslinked by BDDE. A 5 μL droplet containing 5 mg mL−1 P–Os, 3 mg mL−1 protein mixture (BDDE pre-treated) and 0.02 mg mL−1 poly (ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE, Mn = 400–500 Da, Polyscience, USA) dissolved in distilled water was drop-casted on the electrode surface. After 4 h (Au) or 30 min (MP-ITO) incubation at 4 °C in the dark, the electrodes were rinsed carefully with buffered electrolyte solution (50 mM MES, pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, 100 mM KCl).
Photocurrent spectroscopy was performed as discribed previously31 using an automated monochromatic system (Instytut Fotonowy, Poland) with integrated shutter. A 150 W Xe-Lamp (Ushio, Japan) was used as light source. A short pass filter (<400 nm) and a long pass filter (>400 nm) were used additionally to the monochromatic system. All measurements were carried out in a customized measuring cell (optical path length 12 mm) with a quartz glass window and a buffered electrolyte solution (50 mM MES, pH 6.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, 100 mM KCl). The power of the incident light was determined with a power meter (Thorlabs, USA). An Autolab PGSTAT12 potentiostat (Metrohm, Switzerland) was used to apply an external bias of +0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl). The obtained photocurrents were derived by subtracting the dark current from the current measured under illumination.

Biophysical methods

Low temperature fluorescence emission spectra. 
Fluorescence emission spectra (600–700 nm) were recorded in an SLM Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer (Thermo Electron Scientific Instruments Corporation, USA) at 77 K with excitation wavelength at 580 nm (PBS). The bandwidth for excitation was set to 4 nm and emission wavelength was set to 4 nm respectively. Measurements were carried out with 3 μg Chl of PSII and altering PBS concentrations either diluted in 200 μL 0.9 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7.5) or in μL scale within a standard-coated glass capillary (Nanotemper, Germany).


SEM/FIB measurements. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using an environmental scanning electron microscope (eSEM) from FEI Quanta 3D (Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) with 20 kV accelerating voltage and magnifications of 10000× and 20000×. The cross-sections of the MP-ITOs were prepared by a focused ion beam (FIB) treatment in two consecutive steps. First, a selected area of 20 μm × 20 μm was sequentially cut with a focused Ga-Ion beam (U = 30 kV, I = 15 nA). Subsequently, a thin film was gently peeled off from the raw cutting edge using a low beam current of 100 pA at 30 kV to create a preferably smooth cut.
