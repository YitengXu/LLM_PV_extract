To create bismuth species with valence lower than trivalent, synthesis must usually be performed in a reducing atmosphere which facilitates the reduction reaction. In this work, we propose an alternative approach where interstitial barium sites are intentionally created in a bismuth-doped barium compound with an open crystal structure. We observe that this leads to the auto-reduction of Bi3+ to Bi2+ even when the sample is prepared under oxidizing conditions. We show that the approach can be generalized to various host matrices, i.e., Ba3(PO4)2, Ba2P2O7:Bi and Sr3(PO4)2. It therefore provides a convenient and highly efficient tool for controlling the valence state of bismuth towards exploiting the rich variety of bismuth-based optical materials.1 IntroductionBismuth-containing inorganic materials have seen significant research over the past ten years due to numerous potential applications in medicine, catalysis, lighting, superconductivity and optical fiber communication.1–6 At the base of this is the peculiar nature of bismuth as a non-toxic and highly versatile heavy metal species. That is, bismuth is not only an almost ideal substitute for other (often toxic) heavy metal ions (e.g., lead), but also by itself offers a wide range of properties, originating mainly from the many redox and complexation states in which it can be present.7–9 For example, in oxide glasses, bismuth is usually present in its trivalent state, divalent or even more reduced species which have been shown to enable tailored photoluminescence, ranging from red (divalent) to ultra-broad near infrared (NIR). In many glasses, the latter has been shown to almost ideally match the optimal transmission window of silica optical fiber, which has stimulated intensive research into the potential application of bismuth-doped glasses in next-generation optical amplifiers and lasers.3–5,10,11 In this regard, concepts for controlling the valence state of bismuth dopants in inorganic glassy and/or crystalline matrices are highly desired, but only a little is known on this issue.In the present study, we concentrate on divalent bismuth, Bi2+, due to its specific luminescence properties which enable ultraviolet (UV)/blue-activated phosphors with red photoemission.6,12–15 Such phosphors are of high interest for improving the color quality of solid-state light sources,12–15 but also, e.g., as spectral converters for improved solar energy harvesting.16 For synthesizing a Bi2+-doped phosphor in a solid state reaction, Bi3+ usually has to be converted to Bi2+ since Bi2O3 is typically employed as the starting source of bismuth. According to the experimental results ever reported on Bi2+-doped compounds, we notice that synthesis is performed in one of two possible ways: (1) preparation in a reducing atmosphere, e.g. H2 or CO,6,14 or (2) preparation under oxidizing conditions, e.g. air.12,13,15 The former may be universally employed when an optically active ion of low valence is desired, besides Bi2+ also for Eu2+, Ce3+ or Mn2+. It can be applied to virtually any host material.17–21 The latter approach (2) is more interesting, but apparently applicable only to very specific host materials. For example, it has been used for the synthesis of some alkaline earth compounds such as SrB4O7:Bi2+, SrB6O10:Bi2+, and MBPO5:Bi2+ (M = Ca, Sr, Ba).12,13,15 As the mechanism for Bi3+ reduction, it was proposed that the charge and size mismatches of Bi3+ and M2+ lattice sites create a driving force for the internal reduction of Bi3+ to Bi2+ and incorporation of Bi2+ on M2+ sites. It was noted that these compounds comprise a stiff three-dimensional network built up by tetrahedral anion groups (e.g., SrB4O7, depicted in Fig. 1a),13,21,22 which protects the Bi2+ species from subsequent oxygen attack. Similar scenarios have been proposed for the reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+.21,23–25 Further understanding and control of such site-specific reduction mechanisms is highly desirable as it avoids the often complicated and costly provision of a reducing reaction atmosphere.24,25 Fig. 1  Double cells of (a) SrB4O7 and (b) Ba3(PO4)2 shown along the c and a axes, respectively. An immediate question concerns the possibility to apply the case (2) to compounds which do not provide a well-shielded environment to Bi2+ dopants, e.g., as shown in Fig. 1b. To answer this question, first, the incorporation and stabilization of Bi3+ species must be considered. When Bi3+ is introduced into a stoichiometric alkaline earth compound (Fig. 1b or 2a), partitioning on M2+ sites strongly depends on the ionic radius and charge. Here, we exemplarily consider the Ba2+ site. Substitution leads to the formation of  defects. When the sample is sintered in air, ambient oxygen can penetrate into the permeable crystal structure, possibly forming an interstitial  defect in the vicinity of the  (Fig. 2b). Similarly, a barium vacancy  may be created due to slight fluctuations in the barium distribution (Fig. 2c). The negatively charged defects of  or  would neutralize and in this way stabilize the positively charged defects of . If, however, these stabilizing sites can be removed, the  species would destabilize and transform to , i.e., the simultaneously size and charge-driven reduction of Bi3+ to Bi2+. Fig. 2  Stabilization and destabilization scheme for Bi3+ when doped into a compound which lacks a stiff enclosing crystallographic environment around the Bi3+ host cation, exemplarily shown for Ba3(PO4)2. (a) Crystal segment before doping, for clarity showing only Ba atoms (green); (b) stabilization of Bi3+ (blue: ) which occupies a barium lattice site through the creation of an interstitial oxygen atom  (red); (c) stabilization of Bi3+ through a barium vacancy  (grey); (d) destabilization of Bi3+ by intercalating barium interstitial atoms (purple: ) while keeping the crystal structure. The conversion of  to , Bi3+ → Bi2+, is driven by charge and size mismatches. In the present study, we test this mechanism by intentionally creating interstitial barium sites,  in bismuth doped barium phosphates. The basic approach is depicted schematically in Fig. 2d, where  sites are obtained by providing excess barium oxide in the synthesis of the compound. In the following, we extend the concept also to strontium sites, using Sr3(PO4)2:Bi2+ as a model compound. The complex luminescence properties of both types of materials are discussed with respect to potential application as orange-red emitting phosphors.2 Experimental procedureAll samples were prepared in a traditional solid state reaction at high temperature. For this, analytical grade reagents BaCO3, SrCO3, H3BO3, Y2O3, NH4H2PO4 and Bi2O3 were selected as raw materials. For a proof of concept, individual batches of 20 g were weighed stoichiometrically to Bax(PO4)2:1 mol% Bi (x = 2.90, 2.95, 3.00, 3.05, 3.10, 3.15, 3.20, 3.30, 3.40, and 3.50), ground and mixed thoroughly. A low heating rate (50 K h−1) was employed to prevent batch foaming due to the violent thermal decomposition of NH4H2PO4. Sintering was achieved in the following way: (1) all batches were preheated at 500 °C for 5 h in air in alumina crucibles to release NH3 and other potential reducing reagents; (2) subsequently, they were ground again to improve sample homogeneity; (3) these samples were then sintered at 1300 °C for 10 h in air; and (4), finally, after another intermediate grinding step, they were fired at 1300 °C again for 5 h in air. In order to evaluate the effect of bismuth content, the samples Ba3.15(PO4)2:y mol% Bi (y = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0) were prepared in the same way. To confirm the existence of Bi2+ in the compound, reference samples of SrB6O10:0.5% Bi2+, SrB6O10:0.5% Bi2+, 15% Y3+ and Ba2P2O7:Bi2+ were prepared as reported in ref. 13 and 14, respectively. For further comparison and extension of the conclusions, Ba2+ was replaced by Sr2+ and a sample of Sr3.10(PO4)2:1 mol% Bi was prepared accordingly.The crystal structures of all the samples were examined by X-ray diffractometry (Rigaku D/max-IIIA, 40 kV, 1.2° min−1, 40 mA, Cu-Kα1, λ = 1.5405Å). Static and dynamic photo-excitation and emission spectra as well as dynamic photoemission decay spectra were recorded in the temperature range of 50–300 K with a high resolution spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments FLS 920), equipped with a red-sensitive photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R928P). A microsecond-pulsed xenon flashlamp with an average power of 60 W was used as an excitation source to measure the decay curves. Absorption efficiency and internal quantum efficiency were measured with an integration sphere.3 Results and discussion3.1 Crystal structure of Bax(PO4)2:BiFig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of Bax(PO4)2:1 mol% Bi (x = 2.90, 2.95, 3.00, 3.05, 3.10, 3.15, 3.20, 3.30, 3.40, and 3.50) after synthesis in air. For simplicity, the samples are coded as “Bax” (e.g., Ba2.90 stands for Ba2.90(PO4)2:1 mol% Bi). Comparison to the reference spectrum of Ba3(PO4)2 confirms that trigonal Ba3(PO4)2 (ICSD #150866) dominates the XRD pattern of Ba2.90. However, at least one secondary phase can also be detected in the samples. Rietveld analysis indicates the presence of hexagonal Ba2P2O7 (ICSD #80101) in a volume fraction of ∼9%. The amount of this phase gradually reduces to ∼1 vol% as x increases to 3.05 in Ba3.05. No crystalline Ba2P2O7 could be found in Ba3.10, which is why this composition was chosen in the following for more detailed analyses. For further increasing amount of Ba2+, hexagonal crystalline Ba5(PO4)3(OH) (ICSD #152722) is detected. In Ba3.30, its presence dominates the XRD pattern, and Ba3(PO4)2 is found only as a minority species. The samples of Ba3.40 and Ba3.50 comprise only Ba5(PO4)3(OH) as the sole crystalline phase (Fig. 3). Fig. 3  XRD patterns of Bax(PO4)2:1 mol% Bi (x = 2.90, 2.95, 3.00, 3.05, 3.10, 3.15, 3.20, 3.30, 3.40, 3.50) prepared in air. Calculated patterns of Ba3(PO4)2 (bottom) and Ba5(PO4)3(OH) (top) are shown for reference. Peaks related to Ba2P2O7 are labeled with green rectangles. Structural refinement to the space group Rm was performed on the XRD pattern of Ba3.10. The result reveals two distinct barium sites, Ba(1) and Ba(2), one type of phosphorus site P(1) and two types of oxygen sites, O(1) and O(2). Ba(1) is coordinated by six O(1) and six O(2) with a bond length of 2.763 and 3.236 Å, respectively. The mean interionic distance between Ba(1) and O(1/2) is 2.999 Å. Ba(2) is surrounded by nine O(2) and one O(1). Here, the bond length ranges from 2.657 Å to 2.836 Å, and the mean Ba(2)–O distance is 2.797 Å, notably below that of Ba(1)–O.The volume of the unit cell was found to increase with increasing barium content x, i.e., values of 570.771(6), 570.800(3), 571.245(7) and 571.338(7) Å3 were found for Ba2.90, Ba2.95, Ba3.05 and Ba3.10, respectively. This expansion reflects the increasing amount of excess barium clathrated into the lattice. In a first assumption, we expect that the excess barium ions reside in interstitial spaces.3.2 Site-specific reduction of Bi3+ in Ba3(PO4)2:BiIn Ba2.90 to Ba3.00, no red to near-infrared photoluminescence could be observed after excitation at 254 nm (it is noteworthy, however, that a weak red luminescence could be observed for excitation at 284 nm, which will be discussed later). This suggests that the barium vacancies  and the interstitial  defects which assumedly occur due to the understoichiometric availability of Ba2+ in the synthesis process are not optically active in the compound in this spectral range. This observation will be discussed later. Contrarily, under the same illumination, Ba3.10 to Ba3.30 emit bright yellow light which is readily visible to the naked eye (inset of Fig. 4). Samples Ba3.40 and Ba3.50 do not show similar luminescence characteristics, probably because of the absence of Ba3(PO4)2 in those compounds (Fig. 3). Fig. 4a depicts the excitation and emission spectra (taken at 300 K) of samples Ba3.10 to Ba3.30. A sole excitation peak is found in those samples, i.e., at a wavelength of ∼260 nm. Excitation at this peak always results in yellow emission. The emission peaks shift regularly from 590 nm (Ba3.10) to 578 nm (Ba3.30). The lifetime of the yellow emission lies between 22 and 24 μs, and the emission intensity, when integrated over the range of 400–800 nm, shows a maximum for Ba3.15 (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4  (a) Emission (λex = 260 nm) and excitation (λem = 590 nm) spectra at 300 K of Bax(PO4)2:1 mol% Bi (x = 3.10, 3.15, 3.20, 3.30) prepared in air; (b) dependence of emission intensity and lifetime on barium content x, the inset shows a photograph of samples Ba2.95, Ba3.00, Ba3.05, Ba3.10, Ba3.15, and Ba3.20 under 254 nm UV-illumination; (c) emission intensity and lifetime of samples Ba3.15(PO4)2:y% Bi (y = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0); and (d) lifetime of Ba3.10(PO4)2:1% Bi at different temperatures as indicated. Measurements were performed by monitoring the decay of the emission at 590 nm upon 260 nm excitation. The observation of this yellow luminescence is attributed to Bi2+ for the following reasons:(1) As schematically depicted in Fig. 2b and c, Bi3+ can be stabilized in samples Ba2.90 to Ba3.00 where the phase of Ba3(PO4)2 dominates. If the yellow luminescence of Ba3.10 to Ba3.30 was from Bi3+, it would not be absent in the former samples. In addition, the absence of any visible luminescence in Ba2.90 and Ba3.00 indicates that either Bi3+ is not active in those compounds, or that its emission efficiency is so low that it lies outside the detection limit of our spectrometer (it is noteworthy that a weak Bi3+-related luminescence was noticed previously in borate, phosphate and borophosphate compounds6,12–15).(2) We do not attribute the yellow photoemission to the presence of defects or impurities since the blank samples which were, besides the absence of Bi2O3, prepared under exactly the same synthesis conditions and from the same raw materials do not luminesce in the relevant spectral range. Instead, the photoactivity occurs only in the presence of bismuth, reaches a maximum for a nominal bismuth concentration of 1.0 mol% and decreases due to typical concentration quenching for a higher dopant concentration (Fig. 4c).(3) The lifetime of yellow emission (Fig. 4) from samples Ba3.10–Ba3.30 corresponds well to previous observations of Bi2+ luminescence. In fact, its characteristics correspond to the transition from the first excited state of Bi2+, 2P3/2(1), to the ground state 2P1/2.6,12–15 In some cases (e.g., SrB4O7:Bi2+) the lifetime of this transition is barely temperature-dependent.15 In contrast, Bi3+-related photoemission is much more complicated. It involves an orbitally allowed transition from 3P1 to 1S0 and a forbidden transition of 3P0 to 1S0.26,27 The collective effect of these transitions can be directly reflected by dramatic changes of the emission lifetime with temperature. At a higher temperature (300 K), 3P1 → 1S0 is normally dominant and the lifetime is several hundreds of nanoseconds. At a lower temperature, contributions of 3P0 → 1S0 become more important, which leads to a significantly prolonged lifetime of several hundreds of microseconds.26,27 For example, in Bi3+-doped germanate glasses, it may reach more than 700 μs at 4.2 K, and be shorter than 500 ns at 250 K.26 In the present case, we do not observe such a notable temperature-dependence of lifetime. As shown in Fig. 4d, over the temperature range of 50–300 K, it decreases from 45 μs to 24 μs, in very good accordance with the properties of other Bi2+-doped crystals.6,12–15,27(4) Bi2+-doped compounds usually exhibit three absorption bands in the UV-vis spectral range. For example, bands at ∼287, ∼380 and ∼560 nm occur in SrB6O10:Bi2+. These can be related to 2P1/2 → 2S1/2, 2P1/2 → 2P3/2(2), and 2P1/2 → 2P3/2 (1).13 The presence and intensity of the latter two bands appear to be strongly dependent on the ligand situation in the host material. For example, in SrB6O10:0.5 mol% Bi2+, 15 mol% Y3+, the introduction of yttrium into SrB6O10:Bi2+ while keeping the crystal structure intact results in the disappearance of the latter two bands.In conclusion, comparison of the present data to the spectroscopic properties of other bismuth-doped compounds lets us unambiguously assign the observed yellow luminescence to the transition of 2P3/2(1) → 2P1/2 in Bi2+. The excitation band at ∼260 nm is assigned to 2P1/2 → 2S1/2.6,12–15,27 This confirms that in Ba3(PO4)2:Bi, Bi3+ (originating from the batched Bi2O3) is indeed reduced to Bi2+ without the presence of a reducing reaction atmosphere. Instead, the reduction reaction is driven by a site-specific mismatch in charge and ionic radius and controlled by provision of interstitial Ba2+ species as schematically depicted in Fig. 2d. In sample Ba3.05, the amount of  (determined by the amount of excess barium) is not sufficient to consume all of the negatively charged stabilizers for . Therefore, the conversion of Bi3+ to Bi2+ does not occur in a notable quantity. Samples Ba3.10 and Ba3.15 represent the optimal range of excess barium. For higher barium content (Ba3.20 to Ba3.30), the emission intensity related to Bi2+ decreases due to the decreasing phase volume of Ba3(PO4)2 and/or the increasing presence of structural defects which act as luminescence quenching centers (Fig. 3). In Fig. 4a, a significant blue-shift of the emission peak is visible from Ba3.10 to Ba3.30. This is related to the volume expansion of the unit cell with increasing barium content as discussed before. Such cell expansion results in decreasing crystal field strength in the vicinity of Bi2+ species. Fig. 5 depicts the time resolved emission spectra of sample Ba3.10. Apparently, there are at least two emission centers of Bi2+, consistent with the crystallographic data. The longer-wavelength emission center is attributed to Bi2+ on Ba(2) sites while the shorter-wavelength emission center is due to Bi2+ on Ba(1) sites. For Ba3.15, an absorption efficiency of 75.9% was obtained at 260 nm. The internal quantum efficiency was 22.0%, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of 16.7%. Fig. 5  Time-resolved emission spectra of Ba3.10, λex = 260 nm. Labels indicate the delay time. 3.3 Site-specific reduction of Bi3+ in other host matricesUnder specific conditions, the site-specific reduction of trivalent bismuth can be achieved also in other oxide host matrices. Let us first consider Ba2P2O7. Efficient Bi2+-related luminescence has been observed in stoichiometric Ba2P2O7 only when the synthesis was performed under a reducing atmosphere.14 In order to enable site-specific reduction of Bi3+ in Ba2P2O7 according to Fig. 2d, interstitial  species would have to be created by introducing an excess of barium into the crystal lattice. This is in fact the case for samples Ba2.90 and Ba2.95, which are over-stoichiometric in barium relative to Ba2P2O7. As already noted, notable amounts of secondary Ba2P2O7 were found in both samples by Rietveld refinement of the XRD data. As noted before, we also observed Bi2+-related emission from those samples, however, in a different spectral region. Exemplary excitation and emission spectra are shown in Fig. 6. The corresponding emission lifetime is between 25 and 28 μs. These data are very similar to those which have been reported previously for Ba2P2O7:Bi2+ prepared in a CO atmosphere. The difference is that in the present case, the active sites in Ba2P2O7:Bi2+ were not created by atmospheric reduction but by site-specific reduction. The resulting slight change in the band position is probably a direct result of the change in local crystal field strength due to the occupation of interstitial sites. Fig. 6  Excitation and emission spectra of Bi-doped barium phosphate. Curve a (λem = 700 nm) and curve b (λex = 284 nm) for sample Ba2.90 prepared in air; curve c (λem = 716 nm) and curve d (λex = 284 nm) for Ba2P2O7:Bi2+ prepared in CO. In a similar way, site-specific reduction can be induced in Sr3(PO4)2:Bi. Interstitial strontium sites are generated by providing an excess amount of Sr2+. Fig. 7 shows the excitation and emission spectra of Sr3.10(PO4)2:1 mol% Bi prepared in air. The active bands with a luminescence lifetime of 12 μs can readily be assigned to Bi2+. Fig. 7  Excitation and emission spectra of Sr3.10(PO4)2:1% Bi prepared in air. 4 ConclusionsIn summary, we discussed a concept which enables the internal site-specific reduction of an optical activator in an inorganic oxide matrix during synthesis in an oxidizing atmosphere. The approach is based on the intentional creation of interstitial defects which facilitate the ionic charge- and size-driven reduction process. We implemented this concept for the reduction of Bi3+ to Bi2+ in Ba3+x(PO4)2:Bi, Ba2+xP2O7:Bi and Sr3+x(PO4)2:Bi. In all three compounds, efficient Bi2+-related luminescence can be obtained in this way after synthesis in air. We believe the concept can be extended to other compounds as well as to other polyvalent species. It may therefore be used to prepare various types of luminescent materials doped with active ions of lower valence in a more secure, economical and environmentally friendly way.AcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants no. 51072060, 51132004, U0934001), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Guangdong Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (grant no.

 	Fig. 1  Double cells of (a) SrB4O7 and (b) Ba3(PO4)2 shown along the c and a axes, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  Stabilization and destabilization scheme for Bi3+ when doped into a compound which lacks a stiff enclosing crystallographic environment around the Bi3+ host cation, exemplarily shown for Ba3(PO4)2. (a) Crystal segment before doping, for clarity showing only Ba atoms (green); (b) stabilization of Bi3+ (blue: ) which occupies a barium lattice site through the creation of an interstitial oxygen atom  (red); (c) stabilization of Bi3+ through a barium vacancy  (grey); (d) destabilization of Bi3+ by intercalating barium interstitial atoms (purple: ) while keeping the crystal structure. The conversion of  to , Bi3+ → Bi2+, is driven by charge and size mismatches.	 

 	Fig. 3  XRD patterns of Bax(PO4)2:1 mol% Bi (x = 2.90, 2.95, 3.00, 3.05, 3.10, 3.15, 3.20, 3.30, 3.40, 3.50) prepared in air. Calculated patterns of Ba3(PO4)2 (bottom) and Ba5(PO4)3(OH) (top) are shown for reference. Peaks related to Ba2P2O7 are labeled with green rectangles.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Emission (λex = 260 nm) and excitation (λem = 590 nm) spectra at 300 K of Bax(PO4)2:1 mol% Bi (x = 3.10, 3.15, 3.20, 3.30) prepared in air; (b) dependence of emission intensity and lifetime on barium content x, the inset shows a photograph of samples Ba2.95, Ba3.00, Ba3.05, Ba3.10, Ba3.15, and Ba3.20 under 254 nm UV-illumination; (c) emission intensity and lifetime of samples Ba3.15(PO4)2:y% Bi (y = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0); and (d) lifetime of Ba3.10(PO4)2:1% Bi at different temperatures as indicated. Measurements were performed by monitoring the decay of the emission at 590 nm upon 260 nm excitation.	 

 	Fig. 5  Time-resolved emission spectra of Ba3.10, λex = 260 nm. Labels indicate the delay time.	 

 	Fig. 6  Excitation and emission spectra of Bi-doped barium phosphate. Curve a (λem = 700 nm) and curve b (λex = 284 nm) for sample Ba2.90 prepared in air; curve c (λem = 716 nm) and curve d (λex = 284 nm) for Ba2P2O7:Bi2+ prepared in CO.	 

 	Fig. 7  Excitation and emission spectra of Sr3.10(PO4)2:1% Bi prepared in air.
