Here we are reporting the absolute upconversion QYs for different concentrations of M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ (M = Gd, Y, La) in comparison with β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ for the UC emissions centered at 410, 550, 667 and 822 nm at varying excitation power densities under 980 nm excitation. Concentration dependent upconversion QY analysis has revealed that La2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+ and Y2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+ possess almost similar upconversion QY compared to that of 9%Yb3+/1%Er3+:La2O2S. Measurements under identical conditions with respect to the reported most efficient upconverting phosphor NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ show that M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ yields a higher absolute upconversion QY at lower excitation power densities compared to that of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+. Furthermore, UC spectral studies and lifetime measurements were performed for a series of M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors to analyze the UC mechanisms in these phosphors. We show that upconversion emission from 4F9/2 is mainly influenced by the longer lifetime of metastable state 4I13/2.
1 Introduction
Upconversion (UC) refers to a nonlinear optical process characterized by the successive absorption of two or more pump photons via intermediate (real or virtual) energy states followed by the emission of output radiation at a shorter wavelength than the excitation wavelength.1,2 In order to have efficient two photon absorption, the material should have a high multiphoton absorption coefficient, which enables the application of several organic nonlinear materials as potential candidates for efficient upconversion. But it was found that UC in a trivalent rare earth (RE) doped system happens through real energy states.1,2 These real energy states within trivalent RE make RE doped UC phosphors special over the other nonlinear UC materials since they can be excited by a low power continuous laser, and even by non-coherent light sources.
Most of the earlier studies on RE doped UC materials were restricted to several fluoride hosts in the bulk and their applications are limited to lasers. However, recently new applications of UC phosphors have emerged in many areas such as life sciences, medicine, display, security and solar energy conversion.3–26 Similarly, the investigations on upconversion phosphors have gone beyond NaYF4 and interest in developing the most efficient UC phosphors is rapidly increasing due to their possible applications in many areas.27–34 In conjunction with many other important applications, dye sensitized solar cell is the one where nano-composites of the efficient UC phosphors could potentially make the difference.35,36 Recently, Shan and Demopoulos have shown the slight enhancement of the dye sensitized solar cell performance with the addition of nano-composite LaF3–TiO2:Yb3+/Er3+.36 Similarly, many groups have proposed an UC layer of Yb3+/Er3+ doped phosphor beneath a bifacial single crystalline silicon based solar cell.18,37–40 Theoretically, an efficiency up to 52% has been proposed using the UC of these sub-bandgap photons to high energy photons.40 However, in order to realize the potential application of these upconverting phosphors for solar cell applications, it is necessary to observe the efficient UC emission under an excitation power density that is close to the magnitude of solar power density. Our recent measurement of UC quantum yield (QY) at varying power densities for La2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ at 980 nm excitation compared to the brightest β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ shows that RE oxysulphides possess lower threshold excitation compared to β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+, making them suitable for many practical applications.41 Specifically, high QYs at lower excitation power densities make them suitable for utility-scale concentrating solar power plants, such as multi-megawatt power towers and parabolic trough projects in California's Mojave Desert. At these plants, mirrors are used to direct sunlight to get the higher excitation power density for the solar cells.
Moreover, the nontoxic nature of these materials enables large-scale production for many practical applications. Our most recent study shows that these materials can also act as a bimodal contrast agent in biomedical imaging that is capable of both infrared optical imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features.42 Above all, the increasing demand of a halide free efficient UC phosphor turned our attention to explore in detail the dopant (Yb3+/Er3+) concentrations-dependent absolute UC efficiency of these phosphors (M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ (M = La, Gd, Y)) in comparison with β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+.
Although UC emission intensities and the ratios of the various UC emissions are also influenced by the synthesis condition, preparation temperature, and impurities, in this paper, we are reporting the efficient NIR and visible UC emissions at 980 nm excitation in M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors prepared by solid state reaction method. Absolute UC QYs comparison between different concentrations of M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ and β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ (known as the brightest UC material reported so far) will be reported for the UC emissions centered at 410, 550, 667 and 822 nm under 980 nm excitation at varying excitation power densities. Furthermore, UC spectral studies and lifetime measurements have been performed for a series of M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors to analyze the UC mechanisms in these phosphors. Above all, we like to propose these halide free efficient oxysulphide phosphors as a potential candidate for many photonic applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the extensive analysis of the UC QY in an UC phosphor for a range of pump power densities including the UC QY for NIR (822 nm) and UV (410 nm) emissions in addition to the red (677 nm) and green (550 nm) emissions.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
Hexagonal micron sized M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ (M = Gd, Y, La) phosphors were synthesized via the high temperature solid state flux fusion method.43,44 In order to analyze the functional dependence of the UC QYs (NIR, red, green and UV) on the Yb3+/Er3+ concentrations, three sets of samples were prepared. In the first series, the total Yb3+ + Er3+ molar concentrations were fixed at 10 mol% viz. (0:10), (1:9), (2:8), (3:7), (5:5), (9:1), and (9.5:0.5). In the second set, the Er3+ concentration was kept constant at 1 mol% while Yb3+ was varied and the Yb3+/Er3+ ratios were viz. (0/1), (1/1), (2/1), (3/1), (5/1), (9/1), and (8/1). Finally for the third set, the Yb3+ concentration was kept constant at 9 mol% while Er3+ was varied and the Yb3+/Er3+ ratios were viz. (9/1), (9/2), (9/3), (9/5), (9/7), and (9/10). For comparison between the hosts, 3 ± 1 μm sized β-NaYF4 phosphor powder doped with 20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ was synthesized using the method described in ESI S1.†
X-ray powder diffraction was performed at 40 kV and 30 mA in the parallel beam method using a RIGAKU Altima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the samples was observed using a Hitachi S5500 field emission scanning transmission electron microscope (FE-STEM) operated at 30 kV in secondary electron mode.
2.2 Upconversion quantum yield and lifetime setup
An optical setup was developed as shown in Fig. 1(a) for the fast and reproducible determination of UC quantum yield of the phosphor samples. For the absolute UC QY measurements, we employed a barium sulfate coated integrating sphere (203 mm in diameter) from Oriel (Model 70451) mounted on the side of the spectrofluorometer sample chamber opposite the excitation source, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The spectra were collected after diffuse reflectance from the sample relative to a non-absorbing standard at the excitation wavelength and emission spectra under the same conditions for all excitation power densities. The UC emission (350–900 nm) and excitation spectra (960–1000 nm) not absorbed by the sample and reference were measured using the QuantaMastertm 51 spectrofluorometer from Photon Technology International Inc. (PTI) with a thermo electrically (TE) cooled housing with a Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT) R2658p (Hamamatsu). Different excitation power densities at 980 nm were obtained by changing the current on the laser diode controller. Since the PMT of the spectrofluorometer was saturating faster with excitation source than the emission spectra, neutral density filters with optical density OD = 4.0 and OD = 1.0 were used to avoid the PMT saturation, respectively. Wavelength dependent QY correction factors for the PMT were employed to generate the corrected spectra for each excitation power density for the final calculation. The detailed experimental explanation and significance of the upconversion QY can be found in our previous publications.41

(blue) and sample (red) for NaYF4:20%Yb,2%Er at 64 ± 2 W cm−2, and (d) digital image showing the difference in intensity of the green (550 nm) emission to the naked eye at 100 mW under 980 nm excitation. 
The upconversion QY was measured by finding the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.41,45,46 The emitted and absorbed photons were measured by finding the area under the corrected emission spectra as shown in Fig. 1(b) and from the difference in corrected area under the diffuse reflectance spectra for the sample and the reference at the excitation wavelength as shown in Fig. 1(c), respectively. Since upconversion is excitation power dependent and this kind of measurement method was not feasible for a range of excitation power densities and is overall difficult and time consuming, certain compositions of M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ with comparatively higher quantum yield were selected for the power dependent QY study based on the UC QY measured at lower excitation power densities and visible emission seen to the naked eye at higher excitation power densities under 980 nm, as shown in the digital image in Fig. 1(d).
Similarly, the photoluminescence decays were collected on a QuantaMaster 40 system from Photon Technology International Inc. (PTI) using the Single Shot Transient Digitizer technique with a Nitrogen Dye Laser (PTI part GL-3300 + GL-302) excitation source. The Nitrogen laser has an 800 ps pulse width that pumps a high resolution dye chamber to give an 800 ps pulse width with maximum energy of 200 μJ at 5 Hz repetition rate. The collected decay curve was analyzed using built in software provided by PTI. The time evolution of the transitions were recorded under 800 ps pulse excitation at 488 nm (direct excitation) and under 980 nm (UC excitation), respectively.
3 Results and discussions
3.1 Structural characterization
Fig. 2(a) shows the scanning transmission electron microscopy (SEM) image of the M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphor. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) result as shown in Fig. 2(b) reveals that the well crystallized M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ (M = Gd, Y, La) phosphors are of hexagonal structure with cell parameters a = b = 0.3852 nm, c = 0.6567 nm. A typical XRD pattern obtained for the Y2O2S:Yb/Er is shown in Fig. 2(b) in comparison with standard powder peak positions of Y2O2S hexagonal phase (JCPDS card no. 26-1422). The sharp peaks are indications of the large and good crystallization of the particles. The STEM image as shown in Fig. 2(a) and histogram in the inset of Fig. 2(c) confirm the non-uniform morphology of the particles with an average size of 5 ± 2 μm. The compositional distributions of each element in the particles were confirmed by Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectral and line mapping analysis as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), Fig. 2(c) and (d). In this particular example, EDX signals obtained from K, L, and M shell electrons were clearly traced across the region of the nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 2(c), which clearly guarantees the doping of Yb3+/Er3+. The line-scan EDX spectrum of Y2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ as shown in Fig. 2(d) was recorded through the center of a nanoparticle marked by a red line as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a).

The absorption and emission spectra collected from the phosphors were also the confirmation of doping of Yb3+/Er3+ into the crystalline matrix of the host. Moreover, detailed synthesis and morphology of the NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ phosphor have been discussed in ESI S1, Fig. S2 and S3.†
3.2 Upconversion quantum yield: β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+
The UC QY measurement setup was first confirmed by reproducing the results for the 3 ± 1 μm sized β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ sample whose QY has been previously reported in the literature employing the power density of 20 ± 3 W cm−2, which is known to be at the saturation regime of the power dependence curve. Saturation of UC emission intensities beyond the excitation power densities of 20 ± 3 W cm−2 in this measurement, as shown in Fig. 3(a), clearly show the non-linear nature of the UC process in β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ as proposed in the literature.45,46 QYs of 3–4% (for >3 μm β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+) measured using the integrating sphere have been reported previously for the visible UC (green + red) emission.45,46 In this experiment, a QY of 4.27 ± 0.64% was measured at the power density of 22 ± 3 W cm−2 as shown in Fig. 3(b), which matches well with the reported values employing the power density of 20 ± 3 W cm−2.45,46 Besides the visible UC emissions, strong infrared and weak UV emissions were observed as shown in Fig. 3(b). Due to the absence of wavelength dependent quantum yield corrected PMT with the ability to scan both excitation and UC emissions in a single scan, the UC QY for NIR (822 nm) emission was never reported before for β-NaYF4 and others at 980 nm excitation. Our measurements show that total UC QY under 980 nm excitation for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ is 7.8 ± 1.2% excluding the downconversion emission centered at 1550 nm corresponding to 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition. Furthermore, absolute UC QYs for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ measured by an independent group at our request are in good agreement with our measurement evidencing the ability to reproduce the data anywhere in the lab.

The dashed lines are for guiding the eye. 
3.3 Upconversion quantum yield: La2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+
Compositions for power dependent QY study were selected based on the upconversion QY measured at lower excitation power densities and visible emission seen by the naked eye at the higher excitation power densities under 980 nm excitation. A few compositions with relatively higher UC QY measured at lower excitation power densities of 0.5 ± 0.07 and 3.8 ± 0.57 W cm−2 are shown in ESI Tables S4 and S5. We observed that UC QY for green, red vs. NIR changes with the concentration of the Yb3+/Er3+. Almost similar UC QY was measured for red (677 nm) and NIR (822 nm) UC emissions at lower excitation power densities. But at higher excitation power densities, the major contribution for total UC QY came from NIR (822 nm) emission for higher Er3+ containing sample compared to that of red (677 nm), green (550 nm), and UV (410 nm), as shown Fig. 3(c) and (d). On the other hand, the major contribution for total UC QY came from red (677 nm) UC emission for higher Yb3+ containing sample compared to that of NIR (822 nm), green (550 nm), and UV (410 nm) at higher excitation power densities, as shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c). The changes in Yb3+ concentration suggest an optimum concentration of 9 mol% where the maximum total UC QY of 5.83 ± 0.9% was obtained for 1% Er3+ concentration at the excitation power density of 13 ± 2 W cm−2, which is higher compared to that of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ for the same excitation power density, as shown in ESI Table S6.† Based on our observation, UC QYs for La2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ is 3 to 4 times higher than that of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ at the lower excitation power densities as shown in ESI Table S6,† which makes La2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ a potential candidate for solar cell and many photonic applications. Furthermore, for those samples whose molar concentrations (Yb3+ + Er3+) were fixed at 10 mol%, the variation in the threshold excitation power density is very small (9 to 13 W cm−2) as shown in Fig. 3(c), (d), and 4(a), (b) within the experimental error in excitation power densities of 2 W cm−2. In order to further confirm the optimized concentrations of Er/Yb within those samples whose molar concentrations (Yb3+ + Er3+) were fixed at 10 mol%, UC QY was measured for different concentrations of Er3+ with a constant Yb3+ concentration of 9 mol%, as shown in Fig. 4(d) at the threshold excitation power density of 13 ± 2 W cm−2. The variation of the UC QY as shown in Fig. 4(d) clearly indicates that 9%Yb3+/1%Er3+ is the optimized concentration of Yb3+/Er3+ to get the higher UC QY for red (3.84 ± 0.60)% emission followed by NIR (1.1 ± 0.20)%, green (0.87 ± 0.10)%, and UV (0.024 ± 0.04)% at the threshold excitation power density of 13 ± 2 W cm−2. On the contrary, the highest UC QY (6.22 ± 0.93)% was measured for La2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+ at the threshold excitation power density of 22 ± 2 W cm−2 as shown in Fig. 4(c), compared to that of 5.83 ± 0.9% for La2O2S:9%Yb3+/1%Er3+ at the corresponding threshold excitation power density of 13 ± 2 W cm−2. The increase in the threshold excitation power density to 22 ± 3 W cm−2 for La2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+ as shown in Fig. 4(c) shows that the threshold of the excitation power density is concentration dependent.
 Fig. 4  Upconversion QY variation for the emissions centered at 408, 550, 667, and 822 nm for (a) La2O2S:5%Yb3+/5%Er3+, (b) La2O2S:9%Yb3+/1%Er3+, (c) La2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+, and (d) upconversion QY variations for La2O2S at 13 W cm−2 excitation power density with varying concentration of Er3+ at constant 9 mol% Yb3+. The dashed lines are for guiding the eye. 
This shows that almost the same or even higher UC QY can be achieved at the expense of higher excitation power density even at the lower concentrations of La2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+. This discrepancy can be due to the difference in population path of each emitting state at different excitation power densities at different doping levels, which has also been proved in many other hosts.47,48 The detailed explanation of the UC process in these UC phosphors will be explored in a later section.
3.4 Upconversion quantum yield: Y2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+
In order to analyze the functional dependence of the UC QY (NIR, red, green and UV) on the Yb3+/Er3+ concentrations, two sets of upconversion QY measurements were performed initially at the excitation power densities of 0.5 ± 0.07 W cm−2 under 980 nm excitation as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The variations in UC QY as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b) at the excitation power density of 0.5 ± 0.07 W cm−2 clearly indicates that UC QY for NIR (822 nm) emission is higher for those samples with higher Er3+ or no Yb3+ containing samples. But the Yb3+/Er3+ concentration dependent study as shown in Fig. 5(b) suggests that UC QY for the red (677 nm) emission overtakes the NIR (822 nm) emission at the doping concentration of 9%Yb3+/1%Er3+. This shows that the right composition of Yb3+/Er3+ is needed to optimize the UC QY under 980 nm excitation. Although the non-linear nature of the UC makes the process complicated, the preliminary study at 0.5 ± 0.07 W cm−2 and visible emission seen to the naked eye at higher excitation power densities at 980 nm excitation were used to select the compositions of Y2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ for the power dependent QY study. A few compositions with relatively higher UC QY at 3.8 ± 0.57 W cm−2 are shown in ESI Table S7.†
 Fig. 5  Dopant concentration dependent upconversion QY variations for the emissions centered at 408, 550, 667, and 822 nm at 0.5 ± 0.07 W cm−2: (a) varying Yb3+ molar concentration keeping constant 1 mol% of Er3+, (b) varying Er3+ and Yb3+ molar concentrations, (c) upconversion emission profile for Y2O2S:0%Yb3+/1%Er3+ at various excitation power densities, and (d) upconversion QY variation for Y2O2S:0%Yb3+/1%Er3+. The dashed lines are for guiding the eye. 
Fig. 5(c) shows the UC emission intensity dependence on excitation power density for Y2O2S:0%Yb3+/1%Er3+. Variations of UC QY measured at various excitation power densities for Y2O2S:0%Yb3+/1%Er3+ as shown in Fig. 5(d) and the UC emission intensity dependence on excitation power study as shown in Fig. 5(c) have revealed the threshold excitation power density for this composition to be 19 W cm−2. In total, an UC QY of 4.44 ± 0.66% was measured for Y2O2S:0%Yb3+/1%Er3+. However, a higher UC QY of 5.50 ± 0.80% was measured for Y2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+ at the excitation power density of 19 W cm−2 (found to be the threshold excitation power density) under 980 nm excitation than that of 4.44 ± 0.66% measured for Y2O2S:0%Yb3+/1%Er3+. Higher UC QY for Y2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+ compared to that of 0%Yb3+/1%Er3+:Y2O2S is the clear fingerprint of energy transfer upconversion (ETU) dominance in the co-doped system. The detailed UC process in co-doped system will be discussed in the upconversion analysis section. Individually, UC QY for NIR (822 nm) emission was measured to be higher than that of red (677 nm), green (550 nm) and UV (410 nm) UC emissions for all the samples studied at higher excitation power densities, as shown in Fig. 5(d) and Fig. 6(a)–(d). Identical comparison with β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ at lower excitation power densities shows that UC QYs for Y2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors were similar or higher compared to those of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+.
 Fig. 6  Upconversion QY variation for the emissions centered at 408, 550, 667, and 822 nm for (a) Y2O2S:2%Yb3+/8%Er3+, (b) Y2O2S:3%Yb3+/7%Er3+, (c) Y2O2S:5%Yb3+/5%Er3+, and (d) 1%Yb3+/1%Er3+:Y2O2S. The dashed lines are for guiding the eye. 
Furthermore, for those samples whose molar concentrations (Yb3+ + Er3+) were fixed at 10 mol%, the variation in the threshold excitation power density was also found to be very small (8 to13 W cm−2), as shown in Fig. 5(d) and Fig. 6(a)–(d), within the experimental error in excitation power densities of 2 W cm−2. But the threshold excitation power densities for Y2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+ and Y2O2S:0%Yb3+/1%Er3+ were lifted to 19 ± 3.0 W cm−2 as shown in Fig. 5(d) and Fig. 6(d), confirming that the threshold of the saturation regime is concentration dependent.
3.5 Upconversion quantum yield: Gd2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+
Compositions for power dependent UC QY study were chosen using the same procedure as proposed previously for the two other hosts. A few compositions with relatively higher UC QY measured at lower excitation power densities of 0.5 ± 0.07 and 3.8 ± 0.57 W cm−2 are shown in ESI Tables S8 and S9.† UC QYs measured at different excitation power densities have been plotted for the selected compositions as shown in Fig. 7(a)–(d). The highest QY of 4.20 ± 0.60% was measured for Gd2O2S:3%Yb3+/7%Er3+ at the excitation power density of 9 W cm−2 (found to be the threshold excitation power density) under 980 nm excitation as shown in Fig. 7(b). Although UC QYs for red (667 nm) and NIR (822 nm) emissions were measured to be almost similar at lower excitation power densities as shown in ESI Tables S8 and S9, UC QYs were measured to be higher for NIR (822 nm) emission for all the compositions studied at higher excitation power densities, as shown in Fig. 7(a)–(d). Based on the experimental observation at lower excitation power densities as shown in ESI Tables S8 and S9, UC QYs for Gd2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ were found to be 2–3 times higher compared to that of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+, which makes Gd2O2S superior as a host over β-NaYF4. Furthermore, those samples whose molar concentrations (Yb3+ + Er3+) were fixed at 10 mol%, the variations in the threshold excitation power densities were found to be small (9 to 13 W cm−2), similar to La2O2S as shown in Fig. 6(a)–(c) within the experimental error of 2 W cm−2. However, the threshold excitation power density for the Gd2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+ increased to 22 ± 3 W cm−2 as shown in Fig. 7(d), confirming the dependence of threshold excitation power density on concentration.
 Fig. 7  Upconversion QY variation for the emissions centered at 408, 550, 667, and 822 nm for (a) Gd2O2S:2%Yb3+/8%Er3+, (b) Gd2O2S:3%Yb3+/7%Er3+, (c) Gd2O2S:5%Yb3+/5%Er3+, and (d) Gd2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+. The dashed lines are for guiding the eye. 
In addition, Gd based phosphors are known for their paramagnetic features.42 Combining their optical and magnetic properties, these Gd based phosphors could find applications in many more areas over the La and Y based oxysulphide phosphors. Finally, maximum absolute upconversion QYs measured for different concentrations of M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ at their corresponding threshold excitation power densities compared to that of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ are tabulated in Table 1.

4 Upconversion analysis
4.1 Upconversion analysis at 980 nm excitation
The decrease of UC QY beyond the threshold of the excitation power density clearly shows the saturation of the emitting states. Moreover, we have observed a variation in the threshold of the saturation regime depending on the dopants’ concentration. This shows that the UC emission process in M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ is a non-linear process and is highly dependent on the power density of the excitation laser. In order to understand the presence of these non-linear processes, we investigated the excitation power density dependence of UC fluorescence intensity for La2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+. For an unsaturated UC regime, the UC emission intensity was found proportional to the nth power of the excitation power density I ∝ Pn, where n is the number of photons absorbed per upconverted photon emitted.49,50 Fig. 8(a) and (b) shows the UC intensity (I) vs. excitation power densities (P) and double logarithmic plot of I as a function of P for all the four UC emissions centered at 408, 550, 667, and 822 nm. The values of the slope are n = 1.700 ± 0.03, n = 2.050 ± 0.2, n = 2.23 ± 0.02, n = 1.510 ± 0.03 corresponding to 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 + 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively. These n values reveal that these transitions are mainly happening due to a two-photon process.

4.2 Intrinsic lifetimes under 488 nm excitation
The intrinsic lifetimes of the La2O2S:1%Er3+ (4S3/2, 2H11/2), 4F9/2, 4I9/2 and 4I13/2 states under 488 nm pulsed excitation were measured to be 103 ± 3 μs, 124 ± 6 μs, 277 ± 12 μs and 2.72 ± 0.02 ms, respectively, while the La2O2S:1%Yb3+ (2F5/2) level had a lifetime of 725 ± 5 μs. The corresponding lifetimes are tabulated in Table 2 and the decays are shown in insets of Fig. 9(a)–(d).

4.3 Lifetimes under upconversion excitation (980 nm)
The time evolution of the Er3+ (4S3/2, 2H11/2) → 4I15/2 (550 nm) and Er3+ 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (667 nm), Er3+ (4I11/2 → 4I15/2, NIR 1010 nm) and Er3+ (4I13/2 → 4I15/2, IR 1550 nm) transitions were recorded at UC excitation at 980 nm as shown in Fig. 9(a)–(d). At the end of the excitation pulse, the rise and decay were collected for the above mentioned transitions. The presence of rise and decay is a strong proof of an energy transfer UC process. In this particular example, the Er3+ 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (667 nm) transition has a rise after the excitation pulse followed by delay, showing that both excited state absorption (ESA) and energy-transfer UC (ETU) processes were involved in the Er3+ 4F9/2 red level population as proposed in the energy level diagram as shown in Fig. 10. Collected rise and decay intensity at 980 nm excitation were fitted to; 
(1)where A and B are the intensity factors, and τR and τD represent the rise and decay times of the transition, respectively. Moreover, τD is the UC fluorescence lifetime, which is influenced by the lifetime of the emitting level and lifetime of the levels feeding the excited state. In addition to this, rise and decay time are influenced by the energy transfer rate constants between Yb3+ and Er3+ and to the intrinsic lifetimes of the levels involved.

The best fit for the Er3+ 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition at 980 nm pulse excitation corresponds to τR = 89 ± 6 μs and τD = 160 ± 8 μs. The rise and decay times of the Er3+ (4S3/2, 2H11/2) → 4I15/2 emission at 980 nm excitation were measured to be τR = 56 ± 3 μs and τD = 120 ± 6 μs, respectively. Similarly, the rise and decay times of the Er3+ (4I11/2 → 4I15/2) and Er3+ (4I13/2 → 4I15/2) emissions at 980 nm excitation were measured to be τR = 350 ± 7 μs, τD = 3.03 ± 0.02 ms and τR = 700 ± 13 μs, τD = 3.88 ± 0.3 ms, respectively. These lifetimes at 980 nm pulse excitation were compared with Yb3+ free samples and found to be much shorter compared to those of Yb3+ free samples.51,52 This confirms the high proportion of energy transfer in the depopulation mechanism of the UC emitting levels.
Temporal evolution analysis indicates the lengthening of the UC emission lifetime of states for La2O2S:9%Yb3+/1%Er3+ with UC excitation at 980 nm compared to that of direct excitation (488 nm) for 1%Er3+:La2O2S as shown in Table 2. Lengthening of the lifetime for 9%Yb3+/1%Er3+:La2O2S clearly indicates that UC emission is affected by the longer lifetime (3.88 ms) of the metastable state 4I13/2. Given the relatively long Yb3+ excited state lifetimes and the short Er3+ emitting level intrinsic lifetimes in the investigated sample, results suggest that the UC emitting level lifetimes are dominated by energy transfer dynamics between Yb3+/Er3+ and not by the intrinsic lifetimes of Er3+.
The order of the UC QY starting from the highest for red (677 nm), NIR (822), green (550 nm) and UV (408 nm) for La2O2S:9%Yb3+/1%Er3+ suggests that two different intermediate levels of Er3+ are involved in the UC mechanisms populating the green Er3+ (4S3/2, 2H11/2), and red Er3+ 4F9/2 emitting levels. Furthermore, the green level was shown to build up faster than the red one (56 μs and 89 μs rise times, respectively). These results confirm that the green and red emitting levels are populated via two different routes. In this matching energy condition as proposed in Fig. 10, Yb3+ to Er3+ energy transfer populating the Er3+ (4S3/2, 2H11/2) level necessarily involves the 4I11/2 through: Yb3+ 2F5/2 + Er3+ 4I11/2 → Yb3+ 2F7/2 + Er3+ 4F7/2. According to our experimental results, the intermediate level involved in the red level (4F9/2) population mechanism is 4I13/2 via the following Yb3+ to Er3+ energy transfer: Yb3+ 2F5/2 + Er3+ 4I13/2 → Yb3+ 2F7/2 + Er3+ 4F9/2 as proposed in the energy level diagram shown in Fig. 10.
Note that the 4I13/2 level is populated by nonradiative relaxation from the upper lying 4I11/2 level as shown in Fig. 10. As shown in Table 2, the lifetime of the 4I13/2 level is much longer than that of 4I11/2, which makes the Yb3+ 2F5/2 + Er3+ 4I13/2 → Yb3+ 2F7/2 + Er3+ 4F9/2 energy transfer (populating directly the red emitting level Er3+ 4F9/2) more favorable than the Yb3+ 2F5/2 + Er3+ 4I11/2 → Yb3+ 2F7/2 + Er3+ 4F7/2 energy transfer (populating the green emitting level Er3+ 4F7/2 → (4S3/2, 2H11/2)) and final population of 4F9/2 through the multiphonon relaxation. This explains the high UC QY for red emission compared to the QY for green emission observed in these materials when excited at 980 nm. However, the short decay time observed for 4F9/2 reflects the slow feeding of the higher excited state 4G9/2 by energy transfer between two Er3+ ions, which brings one ion to a higher excited which is responsible for the UC emission at UV 410 nm and the other ion to the ground state.
Furthermore, higher UC QYs were measured for NIR (822 nm) for the samples with higher ratio of Er3+ to Yb3+ contained in the sample as shown in Table 1. This shows that emission through 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 transition is also slightly influenced by the Yb3+ concentration and ETU. The lifetime (intrinsic) at 488 nm excitation and the decay time measured at UC excitation for the 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 transition as shown in Table 2 indicate that although there is not a direct contribution of energy transfer UC through Yb3+ in populating the 4I9/2, decay at 4I9/2 has been influenced by the presence of Yb3+. Our experimental observations suggest that 4I9/2 is populated through cross relaxation from 4I13/2 as 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 4I13/2 (Er3+) → 4I9/2 (Er3+) + 4I15/2 (Er3+). Finally, the emission from 4I13/2 level, being a metastable level with lifetime of 3.88 ms, gives the most intense 1550 nm emission. The measured downconversion QY (980 to 1550 nm) will be reported in future articles.
5 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors exhibit very efficient UC emission under 980 nm excitation. The UC QYs at different concentrations of Yb3+/Er3+:M2O2S have been successfully accomplished, paying particular attention to the role of Yb3+/Er3+ on absolute quantum yield. We have shown that UC emission in M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ is excitation power density dependent. More importantly, we have found that UC QY in these M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors are 3–4 times higher than that of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ at lower excitation power densities. Furthermore, we have found that threshold excitation power densities for maximum upconversion quantum yields in these oxysulphide phosphors are low compared to that of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+ and other metal fluorides making M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors more suitable for many photonic applications over the halides and metal fluorides. We demonstrate the highest UC QY (6.20 ± 0.90)% in La2O2S:1%Yb3+/1%Er3+ at the excitation power density of 22 ± 3 W cm−2 compared to that of 5.83 ± 0.87% for La2O2S:9%Yb3+/1%Er3+ at 13 ± 2 W cm−2. Moreover, the threshold excitation power density was found essential to generate the highest UC QY for any dopant composition. We have also observed that UC QYs in M2O2S:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors are slightly higher in the visible region than that of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/2%Er3+. Although advanced furnaces were not used to produce these phosphors, the UC efficiency in these phosphors was high and even at a minor focus of sunlight with the band pass filter at 980; one could see the green UC with the naked eye. Therefore, high upconversion QY at lower excitation power densities for the present phosphors offers several advantages over NaYF4 for many applications such as solar energy conversion, novel three-dimensional solid-state display, UC LED lighting, biomedical multi-color imaging and low threshold UC lasers. Finally, an UC mechanism has been proposed based on the time evolution of the rise and decay observed for the individual transitions involved in the UC emission showing that ETU, CR and multi-phonon relaxation are the dominant mechanisms for the red and green UC and NIR emissions under 980 nm excitation.
