    , Accepted 7th December 2022First published on 9th December 2022AbstractCathode interface layers (CILs) play an important role in inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) to correct the mismatched energy levels, improve electron extraction, and passivate interfacial defects. Herein, we reported a perylene diimide (PDI) and fluorene-based CIL material 2PDINT-FN with four dimethylamino functional side chains for highly efficient inverted PVSCs. The dimethylamino groups in both PDI and fluorene side chains endow 2PDINT-FN with high electrical conductivity, electron mobility, strong self-doping and interfacial dipole properties, which were further enhanced by adding N-DMBI as the dopant. The inverted PVSCs with 2PDINT-FN as a CIL showed a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.03%, which was further improved to 21.85% with a simultaneously enhanced current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) after adding the N-DMBI dopant. A detailed analysis indicates that the defect density and charge recombination at the interface can be reduced effectively after adding the 2PDINT-FN CIL, leading to an improvement of charge collection and extraction efficiency.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) due to their outstanding optoelectrical properties have attracted a lot of attention in solar cell applications.1,2 Since the first PVSC was reported in 2009, the current state-of-the art power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PVSCs have reached 25.7% with the development of materials and device optimization in the past decade, which potentially make PVSCs the most competitive next generation photovoltaic technology.3,4 The device structures of PVSCs are cataloged into the conventional n–i–p and inverted p–i–n types, in which the former structure generally provides better efficiencies than the inverted one, and most recorded efficiencies of PVSCs are also obtained from the n–i–p structure. However, the inverted p–i–n structure is of much importance and attractive because of its easy integration with the traditional photovoltaic technologies, and the further improvement in the photovoltaic performance in the inverted PVSC are therefore essential in terms of commercialization.5–8
Interfacial engineering is one of the important strategies in the optimization of PVSCs because the interface of adjacent layers is crucial for charge collection and recombination.1,4,9,10 In the inverted structure, the interface between the perovskite layer and cathode plays a dominant role in the photovoltaic performance and device stability, and therefore an electron transport layer (ETL) is needed to be introduced to eliminate the interfacial defect, facilitate the charge transfer and also passivate the perovskite layer.11–16 The most common and successful ETL material is the fullerene derivative PCBM; however, the thin layer PCBM ETL suffers from obvious aggregations with large roughness and also has a large energy level barrier with the cathode (i.e. Ag), which will lead to serious energy loss and charge recombination.17–19 Adding the cathode interfacial layer (CIL) between the PCBM and cathode is an exceptional strategy to solve this dilemma.10,20–25 In the solution processing of the ETL and CIL, the CIL material should have the orthogonal solubility with the PCBM to avoid washing-off. Hence, ionic or polar side chains are needed in organic CIL materials to endow them with solubility in alcohol solvents since the PCBM ELT is mostly processed from chlorobenzene solution. A dimethyl amine polar group is generally applied at the end of the side chains of CIL materials, in which the dimethyl amine group will make the CIL molecule soluble in solvents such as methanol and ethanol, and most importantly, this polar group will also interact with the metal cathode to form the interfacial dipole so as to facilitate the energy barrier for electron extraction.26–29 In addition, the inserted CIL can block the ion migration of perovskite materials to improve the device stability.30–33
Herein, we have designed and synthesized a novel perylene diimide (PDI) and fluorene-based CIL material 2PDINT-FN possessing the fluorene unit in the molecular center and PDI units at ends. The side chains of fluorene and PDI units in 2PDINT-FN are fully functionalized with the dimethylamino groups, which provide better alcohol solubility, higher electron mobility and conductivity, and stronger self-doping behavior than the similar CIL materials with some dimethylamino groups in their side chains. As a result, while applying 2PDINT-FN as the CIL in the inverted PVSCs, these outstanding properties of 2PDINT-FN effectively lowered the work function of the Ag cathode, improved the charge collection and transport and reduced charge recombination. The PCE of the inverted PVSCs with 2PDINT-FN as the CIL reached 20.02% and further increased to 21.85% with doped 2PDINT-FN as the CIL, which are higher than those of the CIL materials with partial polar groups. This result demonstrates that the fine tuning of the side chains of the CIL is an effective strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of PVSCs.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route of 2PDINT-FN is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†), and the detailed synthetic procedures can be seen in the ESI.† The molecular structure of 2PDINT-FN is shown in Fig. 1(a). The fully-functionalized dimethylamino side chains make 2PDINT-FN more easily soluble in alcohol-type solvents compared to the partially functionalized CIL materials. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level to study the geometry optimization and molecular orbitals of 2PDINT-FN. As displayed in Fig. 1(b), the molecular configuration of 2PDINT-FN tends to be planar, and the dihedral angles between thiophene and the neighbouring fluorene core or PDI unit are 2.38° and 34.53°, respectively. The intramolecular distance between dimethylamino functional groups in two PDI units and the distance between the PDI units are 19.00 Å and 21.64 Å, respectively (Fig. 1(e)), which provide enough space for the exposure of the dimethylamino groups in the fluorene unit. This will lead to the potential interactions with PDI or the metal cathode. The electron delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of 2PDINT-FN are shown in Fig. 1(c) and (f), it can be seen that the LUMO is entirely located on PDI units, and the HOMO mainly localized in fluorene–thiophene conjugated π-bridge planes, the complete separation of the HOMO and LUMO levels in 2PDINT-FN is beneficial for the efficient charge-carrier transport and the prevention of reverse energy transfer.34,35 As shown in Fig. 1(d), 2PDINT-FN exhibits continuous electrostatic potential (ESP) and large dipole moment (1.54 D), which is conducive to modify WF of the metal cathode (Ag).

The UV-vis absorption spectrum of 2PDINT-FN in the film state is shown in Fig. 2(a). The absorption peak at 381 nm is attributed to the fluorene–thiophene unit, and the absorption band at 450–600 nm is believed to be from the PDI unit. It is noted that the PDI peak in 2PDINT-FN becomes broad compared to the non-polar side chain substituted PDI due to the strong aggregation and charge transfer between fluorene and PDI units. In addition, the UV-vis absorption of 2PDINT-FN doped by (4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine (N-DMBI) was also measured, the doped 2PDINT-FN(+) film showed similar absorption with the undoped one, which indicates that N-DMBI has little effect on the backbone absorption of 2PDINT-FN. The optical band gap (Eoptgap) of 2PDINT-FN deduced from its absorption spectral onset is 1.60 eV. The ELUMO level was estimated via cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 2(b)) located at −4.06 eV, and the corresponding EHOMO level was calculated to be −5.66 eV by ELUMO and Eoptgap.

The self-doping properties of 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) are shown in Fig. 2(c), and for comparison purpose, the ESR results of 2PDI-FN and 2PDIT-FN, which have the dimethylamino groups only in the central fluorene unit, are also listed in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It can be found that 2PDINT-FN shows a stronger self-doping strength than 2PDI-FN and 2PDIT-FN, and the self-doping strength was further increased in the doped 2PDINT-FN(+). These results indicate that the amount of dimethylamino groups in the side chain of 2PDINT-FN has a vital effect on the improved self-doping properties. Moreover, the stronger self-doping strength also resulted in the higher electrical conductivities of 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+), which are 1.32 × 10−2 and 1.91 × 10−2 S cm−2, respectively. Fig. 2(d) shows the J–V curves of 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) in the electron-only device with the structure of ITO/ZnO/2PDINT-FN/Ca/Al, and the electron mobilities calculated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method are 1.09 × 10−3 and 3.87 × 10−3 cm2 (V−1 s−1) for 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+), respectively. The higher electrical conductivity and electron mobility in 2PDINT-FN than those of 2PDI-FN and 2PDIT-FN indicate the importance of dimethylamino groups, and will also expect to achieve higher Jsc and FF in PVSCs with 2PDINT-FN as the CIL.
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were used to investigate the interfacial dipole interactions of 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) on the Ag cathode. As shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†) and Fig. 2(b), the contact potential differences (VCPD) between bare Ag and Ag/2PDINT-FN or Ag/2PDINT-FN(+) are calculated to be 510 mV and 660 mV, respectively. As a result, the WF of Ag (−4.20 eV) was reduced to −3.69 eV and −3.54 eV after coating with 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+), respectively. The WF values of Ag/2PDINT-FN and Ag/2PDINT-FN(+) films measured by UPS (Fig. S3a, ESI†) are calculated to be −3.70 eV and −3.48 eV, respectively. The KPFM results are consistent with UPS and prove that 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) can effectively regulate the WF of the Ag cathode, which is helpful to correct the energy level mismatch at the interface and thus improve the Voc in PVSC.
The surface morphologies of bare perovskite films and the films coated with PC61BM, PC61BM/2PDINT-FN and PC61BM/2PDINT-FN(+) were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As depicted in Fig. 3, the AFM topography images of the pristine perovskite film and that coated with PC61BM exhibited a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 17.0 and 7.6 nm, respectively. It can be seen that there are some large aggregations in the PC61BM coated film. However, after coating with 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+), the surface morphology becomes more uniform and the RMS values were reduced to 5.9 and 4.6 nm, respectively. These results indicate that unfavourable large aggregations on the PC61BM surface are smoothed by 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+).

The photovoltaic properties of 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) as CILs were evaluated in PVSCs with an inverted architecture of ITO/PTAA:BCF/perovskite/PC61BM/CIL/Ag (Fig. 4(a)). The energy levels of the corresponding materials in PVSCs are shown in Fig. 4(d). The J–V curves and the detailed photovoltaic performance of these PVSCs are shown in Fig. 4(b) and listed in Table 1, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters of PVSCs with 2PDINT-FN or 2PDINT-FN(+) as the CIL under different scanning directions are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The device with PC61BM as the CIL gave the maximum PCE of only 15.13% with a Voc of 1090 mV, a Jsc of 20.12 mA cm−2, and an FF of 68.99%. The device with 2PDINT-FN as the CIL gave the maximum PCE of 20.03% with a Voc of 1173 mV, a Jsc of 23.98 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.21%. The PCE was further increased to 21.85% with a Voc of 1178 mV, a Jsc of 25.06 mA cm−2, and an FF of 74.00% with 2PDINT-FN(+) as the CIL. To our best knowledge, this PCE is the highest one in the inverted PVSCs with PDI-based materials as the CIL (Table S3, ESI†). The increased PCE was mainly attributed to the improvement of Jsc and FF in the 2PDINT-FN(+)-based device. The higher Jsc in the 2PDINT-FN(+) device is mainly contributed by the higher electrical conductivity, electron mobility of 2PDINT-FN(+), and the better film coverage at the PC61BM/2PDIVT-FN(+) interface, which leads to efficient electron extraction and reduces charge recombination. As shown in Fig. 4(c), both devices exhibited broad photoresponses and the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of both devices are over 90%. The 2PDINT-FN(+) device exhibited stronger photoresponse than the PDI-D device in the wavelength ranges from 340 to 360 nm and 550 to 600 nm. The Jsc values integrated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are 22.01 and 23.15 mA cm−2 for the 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+)-based devices, respectively, which agreed well with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurement. From Fig. 4(e), the stable Jsc and PCE values were found to be 23.07 mA cm−2 and 19.23%, and 24.46 mA cm−2 and 21.32% for 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) devices, respectively. Moreover, the average PCEs with deviation are 19.53 ± 0.31% and 21.04 ± 0.28% for 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) devices, respectively (Fig. 4(f)).

In order to study the effect of defect density and charge recombination with PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) as CILs, the charge dynamics analysis of the perovskite device was carried out. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the steadystate photoluminescence (PL) measurements show that the PL peak of the perovskite was at ∼772 nm, which was significantly quenched after coating with PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) top layers. The 2PDINT-FN(+) sample shows the lowest PL intensity, meaning that the maximum exciton quenching efficiency occurred at the interface and the defect density is effectively reduced in the 2PDINT-FN(+) device. The electron-only device architecture of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PC61BM/CIL/Ag was fabricated to study the trap density of PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) as the CIL and the J–V curves of the electron-only devices are shown in Fig. 5(b). The onset voltages of the trapfilled limit regions (VTFL) of PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) devices are 0.64 and 0.50 V, and the corresponding trap densities were calculated to be 1.64 × 1015 and 1.28 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Moreover, the slopes calculated from the light intensity dependence of Voc were 1.33 × kT/q and 1.14 × kT/q for PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) devices (Fig. 5(c)). These results indicate that the trap-assisted recombination of PVSCs in the 2PDINT-FN(+) device is significantly suppressed, and therefore, resulting in the largely improved photovoltaic performance.

The effects of 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) on the device performance were also investigated by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The recombination resistance (Rrec) in the Nyquist model is shown in Fig. 5(d), and the 2PDINT-FN(+) device with a larger Rrec value indicates that the recombination rate in the 2PDINT-FN(+) device is lower than that of the 2PDINT-FN device. A lower recombination rate will be beneficial to improve charge transfer at interfaces and induce a larger Jsc and FF. The built-in potentials (Vbi) calculated from capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements (Fig. 5(e)) conducted under dark conditions for PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) devices were 1.06 and 1.13 V, respectively. The larger Vbi in the 2PDINT-FN(+) device provides a stronger driving force for charge separation and contributes to the lower surface recombination rate and the higher Voc compared to those of the 2PDINT-FN device. Besides, the dark J–V measurement results (Fig. 5(f)) for PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) devices were 2.49 × 10−3 and 3.41 × 10−4 mA cm−2, respectively. Lower dark current density demonstrates that the introduction of 2PDINT-FN(+) as the CIL can effectively reduce the defect density and charge reorganization at the interface, thereby improving the Jsc, FF and PCE of the resulting PVSC.
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a PDI and fluorene-based CIL material 2PDINT-FN with fully-functionalized dimethylamino side chains for inverted PVSCs. The fully-functionalized dimethylamino side chain endows 2PDINT-FN with high electrical conductivity, electron mobility, strong self-doping and interfacial dipole properties. With these superior properties, the PCE of the inverted PVSC with 2PDINT-FN as the CIL reached 20.03%, and the device with doped 2PDINT-FN(+) as the CIL can further improve the PCE to 21.85%, with a Voc of 1178 mV, a Jsc of 25.06 mA cm−2, and an FF of 74.00%, which is the best result for the PVSCs with PDI-based CIL. The physical analysis of the device shows that the 2PDINT-FN and 2PDINT-FN(+) layers in PVSCs can effectively reduce the defect density and charge recombination at the interfaces and improve the charge collection and extraction, thus obtaining higher device performance. These results provide us with a simple method to obtain efficient CIL materials by finely tuning the density of dimethylamino side chains in order to improve the overall photovoltaic performance in inverted PVSCs.
