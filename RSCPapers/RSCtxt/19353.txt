    , Accepted 25th May 2014First published on 27th May 2014AbstractWe report on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under full-arc light irradiation of CuIn1−xGaxS2 wurtzite nanocrystals in the presence of SO32− and S2− as sacrificial reagents. We analyzed the hydrogen generation rate as a function of the Ga content and associated it with the energy band positions. For photocatalytic water splitting, the CuInS2 bandgap is slightly too low to efficiently overcome the reaction over-potential. The presence of Ga shifts up the CuInS2 conduction band edge providing a larger driving force for photogenerated carriers to activate the water splitting reduction reaction. The larger the Ga content, the more energetically favorable the electron injection, and thus a more efficient use of the photogenerated carriers is reached. However, the band gap increase associated with the Ga incorporation reduces the concentration of photogenerated carriers available for water splitting, and consequently a lower hydrogen conversion rate is obtained for very high Ga contents. The optimum Ga concentration was experimentally found at CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2.
1. Introduction
Among the available technologies to harvest sunlight, the direct storage of solar energy in renewable fuels through photocatalysis is particularly interesting, as it allows the solar energy use on demand. While several are the potential energy carriers, hydrogen has the unique advantage of being carbon-free.
Since the work of Fujishima and Honda in 1972, there has been considerable interest in generating clean and renewable hydrogen by photocatalytic water splitting.1,2 Some metal oxides, e.g. TiO2, SrTiO3, and NaTaO3, with suitable band structures, low or null environmental impact and toxicity, and a high stability during the photocatalytic process have been heavily explored for this task.3 However, such wide band gap oxides provide low conversion efficiencies as they are only active under UV light, which accounts for just a 4% of the solar spectrum. While molecular sensitizers or chromophores have been used to expand the absorption spectra of wide band gap metal oxides, they still lack of enough photostability.4
For solar energy to be efficiently harvested and converted into a clean and renewable fuel such as hydrogen, photostable semiconductor materials with high absorption cross-section over a wide spectral range and an appropriate band gap (1.7 eV < Eg < 2.2 eV) are needed.1,5 In this context, direct band gap Zn-, Cd- and Cu-based chalcogenide semiconductors are excellent candidates for hydrogen production through photocatalytic water splitting.6
In particular, the selenide CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGSe) has been demonstrated as an excellent material for solar energy conversion. CIGSe has been extensively investigated for photovoltaic solar energy conversion, reaching conversion efficiencies above 20%.7 In this field, the optimum band gap is in the range 1.2 eV < Eg < 1.5 eV. While the CISe band gap is slightly too low, Ga incorporation replacing part of the In allows adjusting the CIGSe bandgap in the range 1.01 eV < Eg < 1.68 eV.
The sulfide-based compound, CuIn1−xGaxS2 (CIGS), also possesses excellent optical and optoelectronic properties, with a direct band gap that can be tuned in the range 1.55 eV < Eg < 2.53 eV, depending on the Ga concentration.8 Sulfides are also generally more stable than selenides, and S is much more abundant than Se. However, CIGS solar cells are generally characterized by lower conversion efficiencies than those of CIGSe devices due to the larger band gap, the usually lower crystallographic quality of sulfides compared with selenide-based thin films, and the worse energy band alignment with the CdS buffer layer used in CIGS and CIGSe solar cells.9 Such disadvantageous characteristics for photovoltaic energy conversion are not detrimental for photocatalytic water splitting, where larger bandgaps, extended surface areas and no CdS buffer layer are required. Nevertheless, most of the investigation on the photocatalytic properties of Cu-based chalcogenides has been focused on selenides instead of the more stable and lower cost sulphides.10 While the CIGS potential for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production was previously evaluated,11 its photocatalytic water splitting properties, and particularly the influence of the In/Ga ratio, remain unexplored.
We used the current potential of colloidal synthesis routes to systematically tune the composition, crystal phase and shape of ternary and quaternary copper-based chalcogenides12–17 to determine the influence of Ga in the photocatalytic properties of CIGS. Specifically, we report here the hydrogen evolution rate under full-arc light irradiation of colloidal CIGS nanostructures with controlled In/Ga ratios.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
Copper(II) acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2, 99.99%), Indium-(III) acetylacetonate (In(acac)3, 99.99%), Gallium(III) acetylacetonate (Ga(acac)3, 99.99%), 1-dodecanethiol (1-DDT, >97%), tert-dodecanethiol (t-DDT, 98.5%), oleylamine (OLA, 70%, technical grade), and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, 99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
Chloroform, isopropanol, and ethanol were of analytical grade and obtained from various sources. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. All syntheses were carried out using standard airless techniques: a vacuum/dry argon gas Schlenk line was used for the synthesis and an argon glovebox for storing and handling air and moisture-sensitive chemicals.
2.2 Synthesis of CuIn1−xGaxS2 nanocrystals
CIGS nanocrystals were prepared following the procedure developed by the K. M. Ryan group.13 Briefly, 1 mmol of copper(I) acetate (0.261 g), 1 mmol of a mixture of indium(III) acetate (0.412 g) and gallium(III) acetylacetonate (0.367 g), depending on the target In/Ga ratio, and 3.5 mmol of trioctylphosphine oxide (1.353 g) were mixed with 10 mL of oleylamine (8.13 g, 30.39 mmol) in a four neck round-bottom flask and stirred at 80 °C for 30 min with nitrogen purging. The solution was then heated to 150 °C with continuous stirring, and a mixture of 0.25 mL of 1-dodecanethiol (0.227 g, 1.12 mmol) and 1.75 mL of tert-dodecanethiol (1.5 g, 7.43 mmol) was rapidly injected into the solution under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution mixture was then heated up to 230 °C for CIS and 270 °C for CIGS and CGS, and maintained at this temperature for 1 h. The crude solution was subsequently cooled down to room temperature. Finally, a mixture of hexane and ethanol was used to purify the product, which was collected via centrifugation. The final yield of the nanoparticle synthesis was about 80%.
2.3 Characterization
The morphology and size distribution of the nanocrystals were determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100). For this purpose the nanocrystals were dispersed in toluene and drop-wise deposited on a TEM copper grid. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8) was used to study the structure of the nanocrystals. The optical properties were measured using the LAMBDA 950 UV-Vis spectrophotometer from PerkinElmer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a ZEISS Auriga SEM with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) detector to study the composition. The composition was further confirmed using optical emission spectroscopy by means of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) using a Perkin Elmer Optima 3200 RL system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were used to determine the surface composition of the materials and were performed on a Thermo Scientific XPS spectrometer.
2.4 Ligand exchange
We rendered CIGS nanocrystals water soluble by replacing the hydrophobic surfactants with ammonium sulphide.14 In a typical procedure, 5 mL chloroform solution of CIGS nanocrystals (50 mg) was mixed with 50 μL [NH4]2S (20% aqueous) and 3 mL formamide. The bi-phase system was vigorously shaken to promote the phase transfer. Almost immediately, the CuIn1−xGaxS2 nanocrystals moved into the upper formamide phase. The clear chloroform solution was discarded and the formamide phase was cleaned a few times with fresh chloroform. The CuIn1−xGaxS2 nanocrystals were precipitated with acetone and dried under vacuum overnight. The product yield of the ligand exchange procedure was about 95%.
2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation experiments
In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 10 mg of the catalyst were dispersed into 50 mL of de-ionized water, containing Na2SO3 (0.1 M) and Na2S (0.1 M) as hole scavengers, in a septum-sealed glass chamber. The reaction mixture was purged with Ar gas for 10 min prior to the reaction. A 300 W Xe lamp (Newport) was used as a light source. The light intensity on the sample was 193 mW cm−2 as measured using a Newport 1918-R high performance optical power meter fitted with a Newport 918-D calibrated photodetector. While no UV filter was used, illumination was performed through the glass chamber, which absorbed most of the UV radiation above 350 nm. As a control experiment, we analysed the hydrogen evolution of the solution containing Na2S and Na2SO3, but no CIGS nanoparticles.20 No significant amount of hydrogen was detected under these conditions.
The reaction product was monitored by periodically sampling the gas phase from the glass chamber using a gas tight syringe. The gas was analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (GC, Varian GC-450) fitted with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, connected to molecular sieve column) to detect H2, O2 and N2. Argon was used as the GC carrier gas. To test the catalyst stability, 10 mg of material was tested for four consecutive runs. To make up for the loss of catalysts during the washing process between runs, powders collected from parallel experiments were combined for the next run.
2.6 Fabrication of thin film electrodes and electrochemical measurements
5 mg of photocatalyst and 10 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%) were dispersed in 1 mL water–isopropanol mixed solvent (3:1 v/v) by at least 30 min sonication to form a homogeneous catalyst colloid. For the measurements, 100 μL of the catalyst colloid was deposited onto a 1 cm2 area on a FTO conductive glass to form the working electrode. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode while an Ag/AgCl electrode used as the reference in the three electrode electrochemical system. The electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution degassed with Ar. Electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded under an AC perturbation signal of 10 mV over the frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 mHz.
3. Results and discussion
CIS nanocrystals produced by the above detailed procedure displayed a bullet-like morphology (Fig. 1a). Their average length was 50 nm and their average thickness was 12 nm. With the introduction of Ga, CIGS nanocrystals became slightly thicker and shorter (Fig. 1b and c). CIGS nanocrystals also lost monodispersity as the Ga content increased. The morphology variation with different Ga/In ratios was likely caused by differences in the binding strength of the respective cations with TOPO.16,18 For CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2 nanocrystals (Fig. 1c), the average length decreased to 30 nm and their average thickness increased to 15 nm. With no In, irregular-shaped CuGaS2 nanostructures were obtained (Fig. 1d).

From XRD analysis, the crystal structure of the CIGS nanocrystals produced in the whole In/Ga range was identified as wurtzite (Fig. 2).17 A systematic decrease of the lattice parameters was obtained with the Ga incorporation, due to the smaller ionic radius of Ga3+ (0.62 nm) compared to In3+ (0.81 nm). Compositions were initially determined by EDX inside a SEM and confirmed by ICP. XPS analysis further confirmed the elemental composition of CIGS nanocrystals and the oxidation states of their composing elements (Fig. 3): Cu+ (Cu 2p peaks at 932.4 and 952.4 eV), In3+ (In 3d peaks at 444.9 and 452.5 eV), Ga3+ (Ga 3d at 19.9 eV) and S2− (S 2p peaks at 161.8 and 162.8 eV).19 No secondary phases were detected, in the whole compositional range by either XRD or XPS.

The optical absorption spectra of the nanocrystals suspended in toluene showed a blue shift with Ga incorporation (Fig. 4). The calculated band gap energies were 1.55 eV, 1.6 eV, 1.75 eV, and 2.35 eV for CuInS2, CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2, CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2 and CuGaS2, respectively, which were close to the values found in the literature for wurtzite CIGS.15,16

In the complete water splitting reaction, two molecules of water are split into two H2 and one O2 molecule, and electrons need to be moved from the oxidation to the reduction site. Here we studied only the reduction half reaction and used a sacrificial electron donor to collect the unpaired holes from the catalytic nanoparticles. As hole scavengers, we used a combination of Na2SO3 and Na2S. Note that the reduction of protons by SO32− and S2− is thermodynamically unfavorable. Light is needed to activate the H2 production. Thus this was a relevant experiment to determine the potential of CIGS for the reduction half reaction in a water splitting system.
Prior to the analysis of the photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate, CIGS nanocrystals were rendered water soluble by capping with (NH4)2S. After ligand exchange, nanocrystals were dispersed in water using an ultrasonic bath. Thus produced and suspended CuIn1−xGaxS2 nanocrystals were highly active for splitting water to hydrogen even without a noble-metal co-catalyst. Fig. 5a displays the H2 evolution rate obtained from CuIn1−xGaxS2 nanocrystals as a function of the Ga content. The H2 evolution rate augmented with respect to CIS when increasingly larger amounts of Ga were introduced. A maximum conversion rate of 750 μmol g−1 h−1 was obtained with a composition CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2. The H2 evolution rate for this material was about 3 times higher than that of pure CuInS2. A further increase of the Ga concentration clearly decreased the H2 generation rates.

The stability of the nanocrystals with the maximum hydrogen generation rate, CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2, was further assessed by measuring the H2 evolution during several consecutive runs. We set the test time to 24 h per run and evaluated the catalytic activity of our material during 4 consecutive runs, 96 h. Between runs, the photocatalyst was recovered by centrifugation and redispersed in a new deionized water solution containing fresh hole scavengers. As displayed in Fig. 5b, a slight decrease (∼5%) of the hydrogen generation rate after each 24 h run was observed. This decrease could be related to the aggregation of the nanoparticles or to a slow and progressive degradation of the material. However, from the XRD analysis of the material after the photocatalytic reaction, no significant crystallographic or compositional change was observed (Fig. 6).

An efficient photocatalyst need to be able to absorb light in a broad spectral range, to transport the photogenerated charge carriers to the reaction sites without recombination, and to efficiently inject them to produce the fuel. It is well known that in both CIGS and CIGSe the incorporation of Ga has a major impact on the position of the conduction band minimum, which is shifted to higher energy values than in the position of the valence band maximum, which remains almost unchanged.21,22 The additional energy of the electrons at the conduction band minimum when increasing the Ga content provides a larger driving force for charge injection, which translates into a faster charge transfer. The faster charge injection has associated a decrease of the recombination frequency and thus a more efficient use of the photogenerated charge carriers.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to analyse the variation of the charge transfer at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface with the Ga introduction. Nyquist spectra obtained for CuInS2 and CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2 electrodes are displayed in Fig. 7. With the introduction of Ga, a decrease of the charge transfer resistance was clearly obtained. We associate this with the energetically more favourable charge carrier injection obtained with the upward shift of the conduction band maximum caused by the Ga incorporation. A down shift of the Fermi level towards the valence band and the associated larger hole concentration are also generally obtained with the incorporation of Ga in CIS.22,23 These parameters have little influence on the photocatalytic properties of the colloidal nanoparticles in solution, but they may play an important role in supported layers, where charge carriers may need to travel relatively long distances from the photogeneration to the reaction site.

On the other hand, very high Ga concentrations resulted in very large band gaps. This translated in a relatively severe reduction of the photogenerated charge carrier density, which was not possible to compensate by their higher injection efficiency. As a consequence, CIGS nanocrystals with very large Ga concentrations showed lower photocatalytic activities. The optimum compromise between the injection efficiency and the width of the spectral absorption range was reached with CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2, which was characterized by a bandgap of 1.75 eV, close to the ideal band gap for water splitting.5
In order to study the influence of a co-catalyst on the photocatalytic properties of CIGS nanoparticles, 1 wt% Pt was loaded on the surface of CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2 by photoreduction of H2PtCl6. As shown in Fig. 8, the average production rate of H2 in the presence of Pt increased up to 1.728 mmol g−1 h−1, a 2.3-fold higher than blank CIGS.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated that the controlled incorporation of Ga into CuInS2 nanostructures could significantly enhance their hydrogen generation potential. The highest hydrogen generation rate was obtained from CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2 with a bandgap of 1.75 eV. UV-Vis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies proved that the enhancement was a consequence of the compromise reached between the favorable shift of the conduction band minimum towards higher energies and the detrimental decrease of the response of the photocatalyst in the visible region.
