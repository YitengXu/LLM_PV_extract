    , Accepted 18th July 2018First published on 20th July 2018AbstractPhotoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals represents a promising approach for artificial photosynthesis, but often suffers from limited selectivity and stability. Improving its performance would require proper design of semiconductor and co-catalyst materials, along with a strategy for effective coupling. Here, we report that controlled chemical etching of Si wafer by Ag+ ions yields effective semiconductor/co-catalyst interface for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction. Resultant photocathodes exhibit large photocurrent density (∼10 mA cm−2 under 0.5 sun), great CO faradaic efficiency (90% at −0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode), and impressive operational stability (little activity or selectivity loss within 8 h). Further enhancement (by ∼20%) of photocurrent density is achieved by combining photolithography patterning with chemical etching. Our study applies long-known chemistry as an unexpected solution and may provide a new strategy for high-performance photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction.
1. Introduction
Natural photosynthesis process converts sunlight, water and CO2 to carbohydrates and O2, storing solar energy as chemical bonds.1,2 It is the basis of all life forms and is crucial to our everyday life. Inspired by this natural process, artificial photosynthesis has been proposed and actively pursued.2–4 It aims to mimic critical steps of natural photosynthesis and improve these steps using synthetic materials, thereby making potentially significant contribution to a sustainable future. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion is an important approach for artificial photosynthesis.5–7 It typically involves water oxidation to O2 at the anode, and H2 evolution or CO2 reduction (to CO or hydrocarbons) at the cathode. Development of efficient PEC devices is dependent on synergistic optimization of light harvesting, charge separation and surface reaction steps.8–16 PEC water splitting has attracted tremendous research attention over several decades, while PEC CO2 reduction is relatively under-explored.17 Compared to the former, PEC CO2 reduction differs mainly in its surface reaction step, whose rate is generally orders of magnitude slower. Selectivity is also a serious challenge owing to competing side reaction (i.e. hydrogen evolution). Improvement of PEC CO2 reduction would require the design of both a proper cocatalyst material for selectively expediting the surface reaction, and a suitable semiconductor/co-catalyst interface for rapid charge transfer across such interface.
Past research on potential co-catalyst materials for CO2 reduction electrocatalysis have provided several promising candidates, including Au, Ag, Cu and Sn.18–22 While some have already been investigated for PEC CO2 reduction,23,24 an effective strategy is needed for coupling co-catalyst with the light absorbing semiconductor. At present, co-catalysts are often introduced on the semiconductor surface via solution drop-casting.25–27 However, such semiconductor/co-catalyst interface is typically insufficiently robust and prone to disintegration during reaction. This is likely the primary cause of limited operational stability of cathodes for PEC CO2 reduction observed in most literature. New strategies are needed to generate better semiconductor/co-catalyst interface, without increasing design complexity or incurring significant manufacturing cost.
Metal-assisted chemical etching of Si wafers in AgNO3/HF solution is a simple and scalable method for fabricating Si nanowire arrays.28–31 This process involves oxidation of Si by Ag+ ions and subsequent dissolution of oxidized Si in HF. Notably, this etching process is accompanied by intimate deposition and accumulation of metal nanoparticles on Si surface that typically has to be removed chemically (e.g. by treating with HNO3) to expose the Si underneath for various applications. Herein, we propose that such as-etched Si wafers loaded with Ag nanoparticles may hold great promise for PEC CO2 reduction. Ag is known as a good cocatalyst material for selectively reducing CO2 to CO.18–20 By carefully controlling the etching time, it is possible to tune roughness of the Si photocathode surface and thickness of the Ag co-catalyst film for an optimum balance of light absorption and surface catalytic reaction. Moreover, we experimentally found that rapid etching of Si wafers in AgNO3/HF solution affords high-performance Si/Ag photocathodes, which are capable of photoelectrochemically reducing CO2 to CO with a positive onset potential (∼0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode). In addition, the photocathodes exhibit large photocurrent density, high faradaic efficiency (∼90%), and impressive operation stability (>12 h). Combining photolithography patterning with chemical etching further improves semiconductor light absorption by 20% without compromising the PEC activity or selectivity.
2. Results and discussion
Boron-doped p-type Si wafers (0.2–0.8 Ω cm) were used as the semiconductor materials, and chemically etched in 0.02 M AgNO3 and 5 M HF solution at 8 °C for 10–60 s (see Experimental methods for details). Fig. 1a schematically depicts the etching process. Initial Ag nuclei are formed on Si surface via a galvanic displacement between Ag+ and Si. They would further catalyze reduction of Ag+ ions from the solution, hence leading to continuous growth of Ag nuclei.31,32 Injected holes are transferred to the Si substrate, leading to localized oxidation, followed by dissolution of Si in HF. Etching time determines both the Si surface roughness and the thickness of Ag deposit. Note that in our experiments, this etching time is considerably shorter than typical fabrication time for nanowire arrays (>10 min).28,29 Here, we selectively present and compare results from quick etchings of 10 s, 35 s and 60 s. After just a 10 s reaction, Si wafer surface already turns pale yellow. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images reveal that the Si surface is uniformly covered with a Ag particulate film, with an average thickness of ∼100 nm and individual particle size of ∼50 nm (Fig. 1b and c). Metallic nature of Ag deposit is confirmed by both X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S1†). As etching time is extended to 35 s and 60 s, the Ag film grows thicker and dendrites start to evolve and propagate over the surface, whereas the Si wafer underneath it remains shallowly etched (Fig. 1d–g). Corresponding results from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of Si and Ag at the cross section are shown in Fig. S2.† It is also worth emphasizing that the Ag film is firmly interfaced with the Si substrate for all three samples. Such a Si/Ag interface is sufficiently robust during subsequent washing, transfer and PEC measurement. In contrast, direct electron beam or magnetron deposition of Ag on Si is unable to yield mechanically robust Ag–Si interface in absence of an adhesion layer.

We used this Ag-loaded Si (denoted as e-Si/Ag) as the photocathode for PEC CO2 reduction. Experiments were carried out in a membrane-separated two-compartment electrochemical cell filled with CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 (pH = 7.2) via the standard three-electrode system (see Experimental methods for details). For the sake of clarity, we focus on the performance of e-Si/Ag electrode etched for 35 s, unless otherwise specified. As shown in Fig. 2a, negligible current is measured in dark. Under illumination of 50 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G solar simulator (0.5 sun), the polarization curve exhibits an onset potential (defined as potential required to reach 0.1 mA cm−2) of ∼0 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode or RHE, used hereafter). Beyond the onset potential, cathodic photocurrent density quickly rises, starts to level off at −0.6 V and saturates at 10.2 mA cm−2. Saturation photocurrent density is lower than the ideal value of Si photoelectrodes (∼17 mA cm−2 under 0.5 sun),11,28 presumably due to optical loss associated with the Ag cocatalyst film on surface. To monitor CO2 reduction product, we conducted chronoamperometric measurements at a few selected potentials between −0.1 and −0.8 V for at least an hour. All i–t curves are stable, except for some slight fluctuations (Fig. 2b). During these measurements, gaseous products were periodically sampled by an on-line gas chromatography (GC), while liquid products were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at end of each measurement. We find that CO is the only product from CO2 reduction, accompanied by a minor amount of H2 from water reduction. Fig. 2c summarizes potential-dependent faradaic efficiency for CO. Within the entire surveyed potential region from −0.1 to −0.8 V, faradaic efficiency for CO remains between 60% and 90%. Such high selectivity of e-Si/Ag for PEC CO2 reduction over a broad potential window is superior to that obtained in all previous reports.24,25 Notably, plain Si cathode exclusively produces H2 under the identical conditions (Fig. S3†).

Similarly, we etched degenerately doped Si wafer (p++-Si) in AgNO3/HF solution to prepare the photocathode (denoted as p++-Si/Ag) and tested its activity for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The polarization curve changes rapidly at −0.67 V and reaches 10 mA cm−2 at −1.47 V (Fig. 2d). The difference in onset potential between e-Si/Ag and p++-Si/Ag corresponds to the photovoltage of the former generated across the semiconductor–electrolyte junction under light illumination, which is consistent with values reported in literature.28 To demonstrate the structural advantage of our e-Si/Ag, we also prepared control samples by conventional electron beam deposition of 5 nm Ti (as an adhesion layer) and 5 nm Ag on Si wafer, denoted as Si/Ti/Ag. When evaluated in the same experimental setup, Si/Ti/Ag exhibits a PEC onset potential of −0.50 V. Product analysis shows that the major reduction product is H2 and the peak faradaic efficiency of CO is only ∼30% (Fig. S4†). Electron beam deposition of thicker Ti and Ag films leads to worse PEC performance (Fig. S5†). More importantly, we find that Si/Ti/Ag is significantly less stable than e-Si/Ag. Its CO selectivity is observed to dwindle quickly as a result of degradation of the Ag co-catalyst film during PEC measurements. Better results for activity, selectivity and stability of e-Si/Ag over Si/Ti/Ag unambiguously underscore the effectiveness of our chemical etching strategy for preparation of photocathodes for PEC CO2 reduction.
Next, we explored the influence of etching times on the PEC performance. It was observed that with shorter etching time, such as 10 s, the resultant photocathode has a small gain in saturation photocurrent density (∼11 mA cm−2) at the expense of a slight negative shift in onset potential by ∼80 mV (Fig. 2e). Extending etching time from 35 s to 60 s barely improves onset potential and selectivity, and adversely affects the saturation photocurrent density (∼8 mA cm−2) (Fig. 2e and S6†). This trend is reasonable since shorter etching time generates a thinner Ag film with limited catalytic power, whereas longer etching yields thicker Ag film that greatly attenuates light transmission to the Si wafer underneath. Our investigation reveals that the electrode etched for 35 s has optimum balance of light absorption and surface catalytic activity, and thus, it is optimal for PEC CO2 reduction.
Light intensity is also an important experimental parameter. When light is modulated from 0.2 sun to 1 sun, saturation photocurrent density of e-Si/Ag increases almost linearly from 4.6 mA cm−2 to 20.9 mA cm−2, while the onset potential improves slightly from ∼0 V to ∼0.1 V (Fig. 2f). Product analysis reveals that under strong light illumination (e.g., 1 sun), CO selectivity declines drastically at large overpotentials (Fig. S7†). For example, the CO faradaic efficiency is measured to be < 40% at −0.80 V under 1 sun. We believe that strong light illumination would yield a photogenerated electron flux too large to be rapidly consumed via CO2 reduction on Ag, presumably due to CO2 diffusion limitation in electrolyte.25,33 This flux is instead diverted to H2O reduction to H2. We suppose that this problem may be overcome by designing nanostructured photocathodes to dilute the distribution of photogenerated electron flux over large surface areas.
Furthermore, long-term stability of e-Si/Ag was assessed by continuously running the chronoamperometric measurement at −0.5 V for 12 h. During the course of this evaluation, the photocurrent density slightly increased, i.e., from 8 mA cm−2 to 9 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3a), while CO faradaic efficiency decreased from ∼90% to ∼60% (Fig. 3b). Such stability data are impressive, considering that most literature on PEC CO2 reduction does not even disclose long-term stability.24,26 This approximate retention of photocurrent density and CO faradaic efficiency is due to the robust Si/Ag interface from controlled chemical etching. Subsequent SEM analysis of e-Si/Ag shows that particulate Ag film on Si wafer remains largely intact after the stability test (Fig. S8†). The slight loss in CO selectivity might be due to decay in CO2 reduction activity of Ag cocatalyst nanoparticles or a partly damaged Si/Ag interface.
 Fig. 3  Long-term stability of e-Si/Ag. (a) Chronoamperometric curve of e-Si/Ag at −0.5 V; (b) corresponding change in H2 and CO faradaic efficiency over time. 
The above study concludes the high activity (onset potential ∼100 mV positive of the standard reduction potential of CO2/CO), great selectivity (CO faradaic efficiency up to 90%), and impressive long-term stability of e-Si/Ag for PEC CO2 reduction, despite its relatively low saturation photocurrent density (∼60% of the theoretical value) due to light blocking by the Ag film on surface. To further improve saturation photocurrent density, without sacrificing PEC activity and stability, we used photolithography to define Si surface areas for selective chemical etching. The logic is as follows: by patterning the etching area (and hence controlling the surface coverage of Ag cocatalyst film), light transmission to the Si wafer underneath can be considerably improved; moreover, PEC activity and selectivity would not be compromised since photogenerated electrons can travel long distance laterally through an electrolyte-induced inversion layer under illumination and negative potentials.34 Combining photolithography with chemical etching yields ordered arrays of circular areas covered with Ag cocatalyst nanoparticles. Circle diameter (d) varies from 20 μm to 200 μm, while pitch (p) is fixed at 200 μm. Fig. 4a depicts the patterned electrode surface with d = 190 μm, etched for 35 s in AgNO3/HF. Ag nanoparticles within the circular area have regular morphology (Fig. 4b), whereas no Ag growth is observed outside the circle. On measuring their PEC performances, photocathodes with different d values exhibit varying activities. In general, smaller d leads to an increase in fraction of exposed Si surface and consequently larger saturation photocurrent density. However, onset potential is shifted to higher negative potentials due to the smaller surface coverage of Ag cocatalyst film (Fig. 4c). Optimal PEC activity is achieved at d = 190 μm, while saturation photocurrent density reaches ∼12 mA cm−2 with no discernible loss of the onset potential. Also, the potential-dependent faradaic efficiency of Ag cocatalyst film for CO was measured to be in the range of 70–90% (Fig. 4d).

3. Conclusion
In summary, we described a simple and scalable method to fabricate e-Si/Ag photocathodes for PEC CO2 reduction. Rapid Ag+ etching of Si wafers yielded particulate Ag films intimately deposited on Si surface. By carefully controlling etching time, we were able to tune the thickness of Ag co-catalyst film for optimum balance of light absorption and surface catalytic reaction. Best photocathode was capable of photoelectrochemically reducing CO2 to CO with a positive onset potential (∼0 V versus RHE), large photocurrent density (∼10 mA cm−2 under 0.5 sun), great faradaic efficiency (∼90%), and impressive operation stability (>12 h). This superior performance was attributed to an efficient and robust semiconductor/co-catalyst interface, which facilitated interfacial charge transport and selective CO2 reduction on surface. Furthermore, photolithography patterning was combined with the chemical etching to improve light transmission to the Si underneath. It improved saturation photocurrent density by another 20%, without compromising PEC activity or selectivity. Our study shows the unique potential of this chemical etching method for preparing Si photocathodes for efficient PEC CO2 reduction. It can also be extended to prepare other transition metal, such as Au, Pd and Cu, decorated Si photocathodes (Fig. S9†).
4. Experimental methods
Photocathode fabrication
Boron-doped p-type Si wafers ((100)-oriented, 0.2–0.8 Ω cm2) and degenerately doped p++-Si wafers ((100)-oriented, <0.0015 Ω cm2) were purchased from Lijing Co., China. To fabricate e-Si/Ag, p-type Si wafers were first cut into small pieces of ∼2.0 × 2.0 cm2 and then cleaned sequentially in acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 5 min by ultra-sonication. These small pieces were then etched in 0.02 M AgNO3 and 5 M HF at 8 °C for 10–60 s. The etched wafers were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and blow dried with N2. For patterned chemical etching, BCI-3511 photoresist was first spin-coated onto p-type Si wafers at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then baked at 100 °C for 90 s. Photolithography on BCI-3511 photoresist was performed by exposing the substrate to UV irradiation for 5 s using a custom designed mask. The photoresist was then developed in developer for 45 s. Next, these wafers were etched in AgNO3/HF solution for 35 s and the remaining photoresist was finally removed by soaking in acetone for 15 min. To fabricate p++-Si/Ag, degenerately doped p++-Si wafers were similarly etched in AgNO3/HF solution for 35 s. To fabricate Si/Ti/Ag, 5 nm of Ti and 5 nm of Ag were deposited on p-type Si wafer by E-beam evaporation at a deposition rate of 0.1 Å s−1.
Structural characterizations
SEM images were taken with a Zeiss Supera 55 scanning electron microscope. XRD was collected on a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. XPS was conducted on a SSI S-Probe X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Ohmic contact to photocathodes was made by scratching Ga–In eutectic to their backside, followed by attachment of a thin Cu tap. The backside and part of the front side was sealed with epoxy to expose a surface area of ∼0.2–0.3 cm2 in the front. The exposed area was accurately measured by Image J software (from National Institutes of Health). PEC experiments were performed in an H-type square cell comprising ∼125 mL cathode and anode compartments separated by a SELEMION anion exchange membrane. Standard three-electrode system was used for measurements and controlled by a potentiostat from CH Instruments (CHI 660C). Working electrode and saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE, calibrated using a commercial RHE from ASL Japan) were placed in the cathode compartment, and a graphite rod was placed in the anode compartment as a counter electrode. The electrolyte used was 0.5 M KHCO3 pre-saturated with CO2 (pH = 7.2, 90 mL for each compartment). During PEC measurements, a constant CO2 flow of 20 sccm was continuously bubbled into the catholyte to maintain its saturation. Front side of the working electrode was illuminated directly with a Xe lamp (Newport Co.) through a circular quartz window (∼5 cm2) in the cathode compartment. Light intensity was calibrated using an optical power meter equipped with a thermopile detector. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were collected at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 with or without light illumination. Chronopotentiometric response of the working electrode was recorded at selective potentials for at least 1 h. In our study, no iR compensation was made. All potential readings were reported with respect to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following equation: RHE = SCE + 0.24 + 0.059 × pH.
Gaseous reduction products together with unreacted CO2 from the cathode compartment were periodically sampled and analyzed by GC (SP 3420A, Beijing Beifen Analytical Instrument). The GC was equipped with a molecular sieve 5A, a GDX-502 column, and a Porapak Q column with N2 as the carrier gas. Products were first analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to measure H2 concentration, and then by flame ionization detector (FID) with a methanizer for CO measurements. Their faradaic efficiencies were calculated using the following equation:  where v (= 20 sccm) is the flow rate of CO2, x is the measured concentration of product in 1 mL sample loop (for the GC calibrated with a standard gas), N (=2) is the number of electrons required to form a molecule of CO or H2, F is the Faraday constant (96500 C mol−1), and j is the recorded photocurrent.
