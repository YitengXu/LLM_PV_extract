    , Accepted 4th March 2015First published on 4th March 2015AbstractEarth-abundant and nontoxic sulfur (S) is emerging as a key element for developing new materials for sustainable energy. Knowledge gaps, however, still remain regarding the fundamental properties of sulfur especially on a theoretical level. Here, a comprehensive first-principles study has been performed to examine the predicted structural, elastic, phonon, thermodynamic, and optical properties of α-S8 (α-S) as well as energy-related sulfides. A variety of exchange–correlation (X–C) functionals and van der Waals corrections in terms of the D3 method have been tested to probe the capability of first-principles calculations. Comparison of predicted quantities with available experimental data indicates that (i) the structural information of α-S is described very well using an improved generalized gradient approximation of PBEsol; (ii) the band gap and dielectric tensor of α-S are calculated perfectly using a hybrid X–C functional of HSE06; (iii) the phonon and elastic properties of α-S are predicted reasonably well using for example the X–C functionals of LDA and PBEsol, and in particular the PBE + D3 and the PBEsol + D3 method; and (iv) the thermodynamic properties of α-S are computed accurately using the PBEsol + D3 method. Examinations using Li2S, CuS, ZnS, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), SnS, Sn2S3, SnS2, β-S8 (β-S), and γ-S8 (γ-S) validate further the crucial role of the van der Waals correction, thus suggesting the X–C functionals are PBEsol + D3 and PBE + D3 (and PBEsol in some cases) for sulfur as well as S-containing materials. We also examine the possibility by using the Debye model to predict thermodynamic properties of unusual materials, for example, α-S. In addition, the bonding characteristics and non-polar nature of α-S have been revealed quantitatively from phonon calculations and qualitatively from the differential charge density.
1. Introduction
Sustainably satisfying the world's future energy needs, which are estimated at 30 terawatt of new power by 2050,1 will require development of new materials for energy conversion and storage. This vision includes the need for use of earth-abundant and nontoxic elements such as sulfur (S). This element is particularly challenging as it is the one with the largest number of solid allotropes (around 30 reported).2,3 The most thermodynamically stable allotrope under standard temperature and pressure (STP) is an orthorhombic cyclo-octasulfur with space group Fddd,2,3i.e., α-S8 (labeled as α-S for simplicity in the present work and its structure is given in Fig. 1). In addition, the other two crystalline phases consisting of S8 rings are β-S8 (β-S) and γ-S8 (γ-S), as detailed in Table 1. A significant number of metal-based (including Ag, Bi, Co, Cu, Fe, Ge, In, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sb, Sn, V, W, and Zn) sulfides/chalcogenides have been developed for energy conversion and storage applications that include fuel cells, photoelectrochemical water splitting cells, solar cells, Li-ion batteries, and supercapacitors.4,5 Current examples of earth-abundant photovoltaic absorbers include Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4,6,7 CuSbS2,8 Fe2GeS4,9 SnS,6 SnS2,6 ZnS,6,10 and Cu2S.6 As another example, the Li–S battery is notable for its high energy density,11,12 and multiple S-containing solid electrolytes have been developed for all-solid-state batteries (e.g., Li10GeP2S12,13 Li4SnS4,14 Li3PS4,15,16 Li7P3S11,17 Li3AsS4,18 and Li2S–P2S5 (ref. 19 and 20)). In addition, α-S crystals are used as a visible-light-active photocatalyst;21 CoS2 has the potential as an earth-abundant electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction;22 and MoS2 can be used for energy conversion and piezotronics,23 catalytic hydrogen generation,24 and photodetectors.25
 Fig. 1  Orthorhombic α-S (space group Fddd) composed of the crown-shaped S8 rings, which are roughly parallel or perpendicular to each other. One S8 ring, consisting of atoms 1, 2, …, 8, and its differential charge density (Δρ Å−3, charge gain shown in yellow) predicted from PBEsol are also shown. 
Table 1 Calculated structural properties of α-S, β-S, and γ-S in terms of various X–C functionals, including the enthalpy of formation (ΔH with the reference state being α-S in kJ per mole atoms), the equilibrium volume (V0, Å3 per atom), bulk modulus (B0, GPa) and its pressure derivative (B′0), and the band gap (BG, eV). Note that (i) the percent errors of the calculated V0 and B0 with respect to experimental data are also shown; (ii) the values shown in parentheses indicate the results related to P–V EOS, (iii) all the calculated properties are results at 0 K without considering the zero point vibrational energy (ZPE); and (iv) the calculated V0 and B0 at room temperature for two examples, α-S and Li2S, are given in Table S4†

Despite the major role of sulfur in emerging energy materials and considerable effort in using first-principles calculations preformed to predict the characteristics of sulfur (e.g., α-S)21,26 and sulfides,16,17,27–33 the fundamental physical and chemical properties related to structure, phonon, elasticity, and thermodynamics are still lacking in the literature for sulfur and even for α-S. As an example, the needed enthalpy of formation27,29,34 and temperature–pressure–composition growth windows for syntheses are not well defined.35 Due to the uncertainty of the exchange–correlation (X–C) functional in the density functional theory (DFT), various X–C functionals have been selected for sulfur in the literature, including the local density approximation (LDA)36 and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE)37 for α-S;21,26 the LDA, GGA (both GGA-PBE and GGA-PW91)37,38 and the hybrid method (e.g. HSE06)39,40 for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4;27–31 the LDA and PBE for Li10GeP2S12,32,33 the LDA for Li3PS4 (ref. 16) and Li7P3S11,17 and the PW91 for MoS2.41 Since physical and chemical properties of pure sulfur were not well examined and established in the literature, it is difficult to judge the reliability of each X–C functional and hence the aforementioned DFT calculations were performed more or less in isolation.
The present work aims to evaluate the capability of first-principles calculations to predict the structural, phonon, elastic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of the most stable α-S under STP (the focus of the present work) as well as β-S, γ-S, Li2S, CuS, ZnS, Cu2ZnSnS4, SnS, Sn2S3, and SnS2. Specially, the present work answers the following critical questions. (a) What is the best X–C functional for first-principles calculations in sulfur and sulfur-containing materials for different purposes and properties? (b) What is the role of van der Waals interaction in these materials? (c) What are the fundamental physical and chemical properties as well as the quantitative bonding and (non)polar nature in sulfur?
In the present work, structural properties of the aforementioned materials are examined using eight or the presently suggested X–C functionals. Thermodynamic properties are probed using the quasiharmonic approach in terms of phonon calculations (or the Debye model for testing purposes).42 Phonon dispersions and phonon density of states are calculated using a mixed-space approach capable of predicting the LO–TO (longitudinal and transverse optical) zone center splitting.43 Elastic constants are predicted by an efficient strain–stress method.44 In Section 2, computational approaches are briefly presented. In Section 3, computed properties of α-S as well as other materials are presented and discussed along with bonding mechanisms of α-S based on the computed force constants and the distribution of charge density. Based on a comparison of the predicted quantities with respect to experimental data, suitable X–C functionals are suggested for practical calculations of α-S as well as S-containing materials. Major conclusions are summarized in the final section.
2. Computational methodologies
2.1. Structural information for sulfur and sulfides
The focus of the present work is the most stable allotrope of sulfur under STP, i.e., the orthorhombic α-S8 (α-S) with space group Fddd (#70).2,3 α-S consists of crown-shaped S8 rings, including four kinds of independent atoms located at four different Wyckoff sites 32h. Correspondingly, there are 128 atoms in the crystallographic (conventional) cell and 32 atoms in the primitive cell (see Fig. 1, Tables S1, and S2† for structural details). In addition to α-S, the other two crystalline phases consisting of S8 rings are β-S8 (β-S) and γ-S8 (γ-S).2 At low temperatures, ordered β-S belongs to a space group of P21 (#4) and gets converted to a disordered β-S with the space group of P21/c (#14) at about 198 K.2 For simplicity, only the ordered β-S will be studied in the present work. Regarding the monoclinic γ-S, it has a space group of P2/c (#13),2 and its bond lengths are much longer than those in α-S and β-S. In addition to the three sulfur allotropes consisting of S8 rings, the S-containing energy materials Li2S, CuS, ZnS, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), SnS, Sn2S3, and SnS2, along with their constituent elements α-Sn, fcc Cu, bcc Li, and hcp Zn, were also examined in the present work with their structural details given in Table 2.
Table 2 Calculated and experimental properties of S-containing energy materials and their constituent elements, including enthalpy of formation (ΔH, kJ per mole atoms) with respect to pure elements shown in this table and α-S in Table 1, equilibrium volume (V0, Å3 per atom), bulk modulus (B0, GPa) and its pressure derivative (B'0). Note that the predictions are results at 0 K using the E–V EOS and without considering the zero point vibrational energy (ZPE), and the calculated V0 and B0 at room temperature for two examples, α-S and Li2S, are given in Table S4†

2.2. First-principles and phonon calculations
All DFT-based first-principles calculations in the present work were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP 5.3.5),45,46 together with the ion–electron interaction described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.47 Eight X–C functionals (and methods) were tested in the present work: (i) the LDA;36 (ii and iii) the widely used GGA developed by Perdew–Wang (GGA-PW91)38 and by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE);37 (iv) the improved PBE for densely packed solids and their surfaces, i.e., the PBEsol (or PS for simplicity);48 (v) the revised PBE by Zhang and Yang, i.e., the RP;49 (vi) the hybrid X–C functional of Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)39,40 with 25% nonlocal Hartree–Fock exchange and 75% semilocal exchange of PBEsol used in the present work; and (vii and viii) the semi-empirical van der Waals correction as implemented by Grimme et al. (the D3 method),50i.e., the PBE + D3 and the PBEsol + D3 method. Note that PBEsol was included in both the HSE06 and the D3 methods since it is one of the recommended X–C functionals in the present work (see details below). In addition, the D3 method was also applied to PBE based on the present tests (see Table 1). Note also that the D3 method was tested previously for structural properties of molecular crystals by Moellmann and Grimme.51
For elemental sulfur, six electrons (3s23p4) were treated as valence electrons. Valence configurations for other elements can be found in our previous publications.52,53 During VASP calculations, a 360 eV plane wave energy cutoff was generally employed (except for α-Sn). In addition, k-point mesh of 5 × 7 × 7 (or 3 × 3 × 3 for time-consuming HSE06 calculations) was used for the primitive cell of α-S with 32 atoms. Other k-point meshes and cutoff energies are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The reciprocal-space energy integration was performed using the Gauss smearing method for structural relaxations and phonon calculations. Final calculations of total energies and electronic structures were performed by the tetrahedron method incorporating a Blöchl correction.54 The self-consistency of total energy was converged to at least 10−6 eV per atom.
Phonon calculations were carried out using the supercell method in terms of the 128-atom cell for α-S (see Fig. 1, the k-points mesh is 3 × 3 × 1 (or 4 × 4 × 1 for test purpose)) and 48-atom cell for β-S (see Table 1, k-mesh is 4 × 3 × 3). Force constants, i.e. the Hessian matrix, were calculated directly using the VASP code. Phonon properties were predicted using a parameter-free, mixed-space approach as implemented in the YPHON code.43,55 It is worth mentioning that this mixed-space approach was recently developed in our group with force constants computed from the real space (supercell) and the long-range dipole–dipole interactions computed from the reciprocal space, and works well for both polar and nonpolar materials.43,55 In the present work, the long-range dipole–dipole interactions including properties of the Born effective charge tensor and dielectric tensor, which result in the LO–TO splitting, were calculated from the linear response method in the reciprocal space (or from the Berry phase approach56 for the case of the hybrid functional of HSE06). More details of phonon calculations using the YPHON code can be found in the literature.43,53,55,57–59
2.3. First-principles thermodynamics and elasticity
First-principles thermodynamic properties can be predicted using the quasiharmonic approach, i.e., the Helmholtz energy F under volume V and temperature T is determinable by42 F(V,T) = E(V) + Fvib(V,T) + Fel(V,T)(1)
Here, Fel(V,T) is the thermal electronic contribution estimated from the electronic density of state (DOS). This term is important for metals with non-zero electrons at the Fermi level, and was ignored herein since the materials of interest (α-S and β-S) are semiconductors. Fvib(V,T) is the vibrational contribution to F, which can be determined from phonon DOS (at least 5 volumes used herein) or the Debye model (see details in the ESI†).42 The term E(V) is the static energy at 0 K without the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE).53 This term is determinable by fitting the first-principles E–V data points according to a four-parameter Birch–Murnaghan equation of state (EOS):42 E(V) = a1 + a2V−2/3 + a3V−4/3 + a4V−2(2)where a1, a2, a3, and a4 are fitting parameters. Correspondingly, the pressure–volume (P–V) EOS can be obtained by P = −∂E/∂V, i.e. P(V) = (2/3)a2V−5/3 + (4/3)a3V−7/3 + 2a4V−3(3)
Equilibrium properties estimated from both the E–V EOS and the P–V EOS include the volume V0, the bulk modulus B0, and the pressure derivative of bulk modulus B′0, plus the equilibrium energy E0.42 At least six reliable data points were used to estimate the parameters for each EOS in the present work.
Regarding elastic constants cij's for the orthorhombic α-S, nine independent cij's exist. Here, an efficient strain–stress method developed by the present authors44 was employed. The non-zero values of ±0.007, ±0.01, and ±0.013 were adopted for each set of strains. More details about first-principles elastic constants and the format of the employed sets of strains are available in the literature.44,60,61
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and optical properties of α-S

Table 1 summarizes the structural properties of α-S predicted by the E–V EOS (eqn (2)) and the P–V EOS (eqn (3)) in terms of eight X–C functionals: LDA,36 PBEsol,48 PBEsol + D3,50 HSE06,39,40 PW91,38 PBE,37 PBE + D3,50 and RP.49 It is noted that the P–V EOS predicts a smaller V0 but a larger B0 in comparison with those from the E–V EOS. Note also that a large difference of V0 (as well as B0) between predictions from the P–V EOS and from the E–V EOS is a signal of less accurate calculations, such as the cases from HSE06, PBE, PW91, and RP for α-S (see Table 1). In the present work, the properties from the E–V EOS are mainly employed, unless otherwise stated. Similar to the observations for bcc Fe with dilute oxygen,62 computed values of V0 for α-S follow the trend LDA < PBEsol + D3 < PBEsol < PBE + D3 < HSE06 ≪ PBE < PW91 ≪ RP. As expected, the van der Waals correction (using the D3 method) reduces the corresponding V0. Note that the D3 correction was applied to GGA-PBE instead of GGA-PW91, since PBE gives a relatively smaller V0.

Table 1 as well as Fig. 2 indicates that PBEsol is the best X–C functional to predict V0 with the error <2% (compared with experimental data,2,63 the same below). Other reasonable predictions of V0 are from PBEsol + D3 (−9% smaller) and PBE + D3 (6% larger). However, the normal GGA (both PBE and PW91) and the improved one of RP are worse selections to predict V0 with the errors >45%. V0 computed from LDA is smaller than that from experimental data2,63 with the error about −13%. HSE06 also gives reasonable but larger V0 (or smaller V0 from the P–V EOS). However, the hybrid functional of HSE06 is a time-consuming calculation. Regarding the values of V0 predicted from the E–V EOS and the P–V EOS, smaller differences (<3%) are found for results from LDA, PBEsol, PBEsol + D3, and PBE + D3, while calculations using the other X–C functionals are less reliable with the predicted V0 differences >9% (see Table 1 and Fig. 2). From the predicted lattice parameters and Wyckoff sites in comparison with experimental data63 (see Tables S1 and S2†), it is found that the predictions from PBEsol are also better than those from LDA, PBEsol + D3, and PBE + D3. However, structural properties from these three X–C functionals are also acceptable to some extent, especially for the case of PBE + D3.
 Fig. 2  Calculated errors of bulk modulus (B0 in red) and equilibrium volume (V0 in blue) with respect to experimental data for α-S. Predictions are based on both the P–V EOS and the E–V EOS in terms of different X–C functionals. Note that (i) these data are also shown in Table 1, (ii) PS represents the PBEsol, and (iii) the calculated V0 and B0 at room temperature for two examples, α-S and Li2S, are given in Table S4.† 
Regarding the computed B0 of α-S at its theoretical equilibrium volumes, Table 1 as well as Fig. 2 shows that the PBEsol + D3 method predicts the best B0 in comparison with experimental data64–66 (around 10.6 GPa, see Table 1 for details). Other reasonable predictions are from LDA, PBEsol, and PBE + D3. It seems that the value of B0 from HSE06 in terms of the P–V EOS is the most reasonable one (error −3%). However, HSE06 in terms of the E–V EOS predicts a much smaller B0 (error −71%). Opposite to the V0 case, PBE, PW91, and RP predict a very small B0 with errors around −95% (see Table 1 and Fig. 2). Regarding the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus, B′0, Table 1 shows that this value is around 7–10 for α-S, which is larger than the normal value of 3–6,60 implying a larger thermal expansion of α-S.67 Note that the measured B′0 = 7 was based on four data points at high pressures,64 which is for reference only but it also agrees more or less with the present predictions. The large value of B′0 is also a main reason regarding the failure of the normal Debye model to predict thermodynamic properties of α-S, see the ESI.†

Table 1 also lists the predicted band gaps of α-S at its theoretical equilibrium volumes. It is seen that the prediction from HSE06 (3.55 eV) agrees well with experimental values (∼3.6 eV, see Table 1 for details),21,66 and the predictions from PBEsol + D3 (1.78 eV), PBEsol (1.96 eV), and PBE + D3 (2.11 eV) are also reasonable. Note that the predictions from PBE, PW91, and RP are listed for reference only since (i) they predict unreasonably large volumes and (ii) the predicted band gap increases with increasing volume for α-S. As examples, Table 3 lists the predicted macroscopic static dielectric constants from PBEsol, PBE + D3, PBEsol + D3, and HSE06. Similar to the conclusion drawn for the band gap, dielectric constants calculated from HSE06 agree well with experimental data along different axes.66 In addition, the other three X–C functionals also give reasonable results, indicating that dielectric constants are not sensitive to the X–C functional.

In terms of the predicted structural properties as well as band gaps and dielectric constants of α-S, it is conclusive that the D3 method (PBEsol + D3 and PBE + D3), PBEsol, and LDA are practical selections by considering both accuracy and computational efficiency; moreover, HSE06 predicts very accurate optical properties including band gap and dielectric constants. Hence, these four X–C functionals (PBEsol, PBEsol + D3, PBE + D3, and LDA) will be examined further.
3.2. Phonon properties and bonding characteristics of α-S
At the Brillouin zone center (Γ point) of α-S with space group Fddd, four Wyckoff sites of 32h (see Table S2†) possess the following mechanical representation of vibrational modes: 12Ag(R) + 12B1g(R) + 12B2g(R) + 12B3g(R) + 12B1u(IR) + 12B2u(IR) + 12B3u(IR) + 12Au(4)
Hence, α-S has 48 Raman (R) active modes, 36 infrared (IR) active modes, and 12 silent (inactive) modes. Three acoustic modes are B1u, B2u, and B3u. These 96 modes at Γ point predicted from PBEsol, PBE + D3, PBEsol + D3, and LDA are listed in Table S3† together with available measurements.68 It is found that these four X–C functionals predict similar phonon modes, which agree reasonably well with experimental data. For example, the maximum frequency from measurement (476 cm−1)68 agrees with the predictions (around 470–480 cm−1, see Fig. 3, S1, and Table S3†). It is worth mentioning that no apparent differences exist for the predicted frequencies of α-S with and without the consideration of LO–TO splitting. For example, the maximum difference is less than 1 cm−1 for a B2u mode with frequency of 226 cm−1 (from PBEsol, see Table S3† for details). Here, the employed Born effective charge tensor and dielectric tensor for phonon calculations were predicted using HSE06 based on the structure relaxed by PBEsol (see Table 3 for the predicted dielectric constants). The negligible effect of LO–TO splitting indicates that α-S is almost a non-polar crystal, therefore, the LO–TO splitting is ignored in the present work for other phonon calculations.
 Fig. 3  Calculated phonon dispersions and phonon density of state (DOS) of α-S at its theoretical equilibrium volume in terms of PBEsol (a) and PBEsol + D3 (b). Measured frequencies at Γ point by Raman and infrared spectra66 are shown by green circles, and these dispersion curves have no obvious differences with and without the LO-TO splitting, see Table S3† for more details. Note that predicted results of α-S from LDA and PBE + D3 are shown in Fig. S1.† 
As examples, Fig. 3 shows the predicted phonon dispersions and phonon DOS of α-S at its theoretical equilibrium volumes in terms of PBEsol and PBEsol + D3 (see Table 1). Measured frequencies at Γ point (see Table S3†)68 by Raman and infrared spectra are also shown for comparison. A reasonable agreement is found between experiments and predictions except for the measured frequency of 424 cm−1, since a forbidden phonon region is predicted from around 400 to 450 cm−1. In addition, Fig. 3 shows that the maximum frequency is about 480 cm−1 from both the predictions and the measurements, and the largest forbidden phonon gap is from around 250 to 370 cm−1. Similar predictions and conclusions also can be drawn from LDA and PBE + D3 (see Fig. S1†). Regarding phonon DOS, it is shown (see Fig. S2†) that PBEsol, PBEsol + D3, and LDA predict similar results, which are different from that of PBE + D3. It is observed that at the low frequency region (<100 cm−1) the phonon densities from high to low follow the trend PBEsol > PBE + D3 > PBEsol + D3 > (but ≈) LDA. This indicates that a softer α-S is predicted from PBEsol among these four functionals (see also bulk moduli in Table 1 as well as Fig. 2), and in turn, a faster increase of entropy with increasing temperature will result from PBEsol, since vibrational entropy is proportional to phonon DOS as follows:69 S ∝ ∫g(ω)ln(ω)dω(5)where ω is the frequency and g(ω) the phonon DOS.
Force constants from phonon calculations allow quantitative analysis of the interactions between atomic pairs.53,57,70 A strong interaction between atomic pairs is indicated by a large and positive force constant, while a negative force constant indicates that the atomic pair tends to separate from each other. As an example, key variations of the reduced force constants, i.e., the stretching force constants (SFC's), are plotted in Fig. 4 predicted from PBEsol. As expected, the largest SFC's (about 10 eV Å−2) are for the nearest atomic pairs (∼2.05 Å) within the S8 ring (see atomic pairs 1–2, 2–3, 3–4, and so on in Fig. 1), and the second largest SFC's (about 2.7 eV Å−2) are for the second nearest atomic pairs (∼3.35 Å) within the S8 ring (see atomic pairs 1–3 and 2–4 etc. in Fig. 1). For atomic pairs between the S8 rings with bond lengths from 3.4 to 5.4 Å and the SFC's around 0.1–0.2 eV Å−2 (representing the van der Waals forces), they possess similar SFC values to those for the third nearest atomic pairs within the S8 rings (atomic pairs 1–4 and 2–5 etc. in Fig. 1) and play a crucial role in connecting the S8 rings.
 Fig. 4  Key stretching force constants of α-S (from phonon calculations) with bond length less than 6 Å predicted from PBEsol. The ordinate is on a log scale. A large positive force constant suggests strong interaction, while the small values (<0.01 eV Å−2) are ignored in this plot. The stretching force constants around −0.34 eV Å−2 are also ignored, which are for atomic pairs within the S8 ring and possessing the longest bond lengths (∼4.0–4.75 Å). 
The strong interactions within the S8 ring of α-S are also indicated by the charge density difference contours shown in Fig. 1. They are computed from the difference between the charge density after electronic relaxations and the non-interacting charge density from one electronic step,71 indicating the charge density redistribution upon formation of the orthorhombic α-S. Between the S8 rings, the charge gains and losses are negligible and therefore they are ignored in Fig. 1. The charge gains in Fig. 1 indicate the strong interactions within the S8 ring, and the bond directionality between the S–S pairs provides an indication of the covalent character. These interactions are traceable from the s–p hybridization, contributed by more electrons in the 3p orbital as well as a small part of electrons in the 3s orbital, see the partial electronic DOS of α-S in Fig. S3.†
3.3. Elasticity of α-S

Table 4 summarizes the predicted elastic constants cij's of α-S from LDA, PBEsol, PBEsol + D3, and PBE + D3 in comparison with experimental data.65 The error of each cij is around 0.5 GPa by examining the cij values from different groups of non-zero strains (±0.007, ±0.01, and ±0.013). Table 4 shows that these cij values are small (<about 41 GPa), due mainly to the weak van der Walls forces between these S8 rings (see force constants in Fig. 4). The c33 value is the largest one, followed by c11 and c22, which are consistent with the predicted dielectric constants along the a-, b-, and c-axis directions (see Table 3). Except for c11, c22, and c33, the relatively large values are for c44 (i.e., c2323 or c3232etc. in the format of the fourth-rank tensors) and c23 with respect to the others (c55, c66, c12, and c13). Fig. 5 plots the predicted cij's in comparison with experimental data.65 Similar to the observation for bulk modulus from EOS fitting (see Table 1), the D3 method gives a better cij prediction, and the experimental elastic properties are roughly in the middle of the predictions from PBE + D3 and PBEsol + D3. In addition, LDA and PBEsol also give a reasonable cij prediction.

 Fig. 5  Measured elastic constants of α-S at 77 K (ref. 65) in comparison with experimental data at 293 K (ref. 65) and estimations from lattice dynamics data65 as well as predictions by LDA, PBEsol + D3, PBE + D3 and PBEsol, see also Table 4. 
In terms of the single crystal cij's and the Hill approach,61,72Table 4 also shows the polycrystalline aggregate properties of bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (Y), and Poisson's ratio (ν). The predicted values of BHill from cij's (4.2, 6.8, 12.9, and 15.2 GPa from PBEsol, PBE + D3, PBEsol + D3, and LDA, respectively) agree well with but are slightly smaller than those from the EOS fittings (B0, see Table 1). Similar to BHill and B0, measured values of GHill and YHill are also roughly in the middle of the predictions by PBEsol + D3 and PBE + D3. Regarding the Poisson's ratio νHill, the predictions (in particular from PBEsol) are smaller than the measurements due mainly to a smaller B/G ratio, since (6)
Based on Poisson's ratio (calculated from cij's) and equilibrium properties of bulk modulus and volume, Debye temperature at a given volume can be predicted (see details in the ESI† as well as the literature42,73,74). Table 4 lists the Debye temperatures (Θ0) of α-S at its equilibrium volumes from first-principles calculations and experiments.65 The Θ0 values from elasticity are roughly 200 K (170–258 K), which are only half of the second moment Debye temperature (510–520 K) predicted from phonon DOS (in terms of PBEsol, PBE + D3, PBEsol + D3, and LDA).42 The scattered Debye temperatures from predictions (∼200 and ∼520 K) agree reasonably well with experimental results for α-S (187.5,65 250,66 and 520 K (ref. 75)).
3.4. Thermodynamic properties of α-S

Fig. 6 illustrates the predicted thermodynamic properties of α-S up to 370 K under external pressure P = 0 GPa using the quasiharmonic phonon approach of eqn (1), including enthalpy (equal to internal energy due to P = 0), entropy, and Gibbs energy (equal to Helmholtz energy at P = 0). Here, the enthalpy is set to zero at 298.15 K, i.e., the same as the standard element reference used in the CALPHAD community.76,77 Each figure is terminated at 370 K, which is close to the phase transition temperature of α-S to a high temperature phase of β-S.2,76Fig. 6 shows that the predictions from LDA and PBEsol + D3 agree well with the Scientific Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE) data76 evaluated based on experimental data, while the predictions from PBEsol and PBE + D3 agree reasonably with the SGTE data due to the faster increase of vibrational entropy with temperature, see Fig. S2† and the reason shown in eqn (5).
 Fig. 6  Entropy (S), enthalpy (H) and Gibbs (G) energy of α-S predicted by LDA, PBEsol, PBEsol + D3, and PBE + D3. The circles are the SGTE data.76 
Regarding thermodynamic properties which are the second derivatives of Gibbs energy (or Helmholtz energy due to P = 0 GPa), Fig. 7 illustrates the heat capacity at constant pressure (CP) and the linear thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of α-S calculated by the quasiharmonic phonon approach in terms of LDA, PBEsol, PBEsol + D3, and PBE + D3. SGTE data76 and experimental data66,78 are also plotted for comparison. For CP, all these four X–C functionals give a good prediction, especially the results from LDA and PBEsol + D3. Regarding the linear TEC, the best prediction is from PBEsol + D3. Note that these TEC predictions are consistent with the above observation: a softer α-S crystal (from those such as PBEsol and PBE + D3) corresponds to a larger vibrational entropy contribution, and in turn, a larger TEC.
 Fig. 7  Heat capacity at constant pressure (CP) and linear thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of α-S predicted by LDA, PBEsol, PBEsol + D3, and PBE + D3, in comparison with the SGTE data76 and measurements of the linear TEC78 and CP.66 
According to the predicted thermodynamic properties of α-S as shown in Fig. 6 and 7, it is conclusive that PBEsol + D3 is the best X–C functional. Moreover, phonon properties of α-S from PBEsol + D3 should be the most accurate predictions, at least in the low frequency region (see the reason given by eqn (5)). For comparison, it is also interesting to see how good the thermodynamic properties of α-S predicted from the Debye model42 are (see the ESI† for details). As mentioned above, Debye temperatures of α-S are scattered. In addition, Table 1 indicates that α-S is an unusual crystal with large B′0 (7–10) and small B0 (around 10 GPa). Test calculations show that the normal settings of the Debye–Grüneisen model42 cannot describe the thermodynamic properties of α-S due to a rapid change of Debye temperature with increasing volume (see the ESI† for details). This rapid change is due mainly to the large B′0, and in turn, the large Grüneisen constant (see the ESI†). Hence, we suggest that the Grüneisen constant can be treated as an adjustable parameter in the Debye–Grüneisen model42 in order to describe the “slow” change of Debye temperature with respect to the change of volume (see details in the ESI†). Accordingly, a roughly reliable prediction of thermodynamic properties can be obtained for α-S (see Fig. S4†). It is expected that the present suggestion also works for other unusual materials with large B′0 (such as >7) and small B0 (such as <50 GPa).
3.5. Test of structural and thermodynamic properties of β-S, γ-S, and sulfides
Based on the results from α-S, the suggested X–C functional is PBEsol + D3 as well as PBE + D3 and PBEsol. Further examination of these functionals is summarized in Table 2 for β-S, γ-S, and the energy-related metal sulfides Li2S, CuS, ZnS, CZTS, SnS, Sn2S3, and SnS2. The enthalpy of formation (ΔH), equilibrium volume (V0), bulk modulus (B0) and its pressure derivative (B′0) were predicted at 0 K using the E–V EOS (see eqn (2)) without considering the ZPE. Available experimental data60,63,79–92 are also listed for comparison in Table 2. Note that (i) the reference states of ΔH are α-S and the pure elements listed in Table 2; (ii) the measured B′0 was −2 ± 2 for covellite CuS,82 but other first-principles results (4–5)93 agree with the present value near 5; (iii) direct measurement of ΔH is not available for CZTS, other first-principles results were from −42.1 to −50.8 kJ per mole atoms,29,94,95 and an indirect value based on the sputtering rates measurement was −116 ± 12 kJ per mole atoms for Cu1.9Zn1.5Sn0.8S4,85 which is far from the present and other first-principles predictions maybe due to the large composition difference; and (iv) direct measurement of B0 is not available for CZTS; the estimated B0 of 83.6 GPa (ref. 96) was based on an empirical relationship for chalcopyrite compounds.97
Similar to the conclusion drawn for α-S, Table 1 as well as Fig. 8 shows that PBEsol is the best X–C functional to predict V0 for both β-S and γ-S, and PBEsol + D3 gives the best prediction of ΔH for β-S (followed by LDA). It is found that PBEsol gives a wrong prediction of ΔH for β-S, and the ΔH value from PBE + D3 is too small. Table 2 as well as Fig. 8 also shows that PBE + D3 as well as PBEsol gives a good V0 prediction for sulfides (Li2S, CuS, ZnS, CZTS, SnS, Sn2S3, and SnS2), and PBEsol + D3 predicts a better B0 and especially ΔH for these sulfur and sulfides. It should be remarked that the measured values of B′0 are usually based on the scattered data at high pressures, which should not be set as the benchmark to judge the quality of first-principles calculations.
 Fig. 8  Calculated errors of equilibrium volume (a), bulk modulus (b) and enthalpy of formation ΔH (c) with respect to experimental data for S-containing energy materials and their constituent elements. Predictions are based on the E–V EOS in terms of different X–C functionals. See also Table 2 for details. Note that the calculated equilibrium volume (V0) and bulk modulus (B0) at room temperature for two examples, α-S and Li2S, are given in Table S4.† 
At finite temperatures, Gibbs energy difference (ΔG) between the ordered β-S and α-S is shown in Fig. S5† based on the PBEsol + D3 method and the quasiharmonic phonon approach of eqn (1). It is found that the predicted ΔG decreases with increasing temperature because of more phonon density for the ordered β-S with respect to that of α-S in the low frequency region (such as <50 cm−1, see Fig. S6† and the reason shown in eqn (5)). The predicted phase transition temperature between the ordered β-S and α-S is greater than 700 K, much higher than the measurement value of 368 K,2 but this temperature is quite reasonable because of (i) the ignorance of phase transition between the ordered and disordered β-S at about 198 K,2 and (ii) the omission of configurational entropy for the disordered β-S. Regarding sulfides, we tested the anti-fluorite Li2S in terms of the quasiharmonic phonon approach, similar to the case of α-S; the best thermodynamic properties in comparison with experiments also result from the van der Waals correction (PBE + D3 or PBEsol + D3), see details in another publication.98
These examinations validate further the conclusion drawn for α-S, i.e., the van der Waals correction is crucial to predict the properties of sulfur and S-containing materials, and the suggested X–C functional is PBEsol + D3 as well as PBE + D3 and maybe PBEsol for some cases.
It should be remarked that the calculated structural properties at 0 K and without the effect of ZPE are presented in Tables 1 and 2, and Fig. 2 and 8; however, experimental data are usually measured at room temperature (298 K). As examples, Table S4† shows the predicted V0 and B0 for two materials at 0 K (with and without the effect of ZPE) and room temperature (298 K): an unusual material of α-S with B′0 > 7 and a normal material of Li2S with B′0 ∼ 4. The general trend shown in Table S4† is that the calculated V0 at 298 K is about 2–4% larger than the V0 at 0 K and without ZPE. The trend for B0 is slightly complicated. It is seen that the calculated B0 at 298 K decreases about 6–9% for a normal material such as Li2S in comparison with the B0 at 0 K and without ZPE. However, the decrease of B0 is more than 10% for an unusual material, for example α-S. Note also that the structural properties at room temperature will not change the conclusions drawn from Tables 1, 2, Fig. 2, and 8. However, the general difference of structural properties between 0 K (without ZPE) and room temperature should be kept in mind when compared to experimental data.
4. Conclusions
A comprehensive first-principles study based on density functional theory has been performed to examine the structural, phonon, elastic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of the orthorhombic α-S with space group Fddd by using a variety of exchange–correlation (X–C) functionals and the van der Waals correction in terms of the D3 method. Further examination is also performed for β-S and γ-S and the energy-related metal sulfides Li2S, CuS, ZnS, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), SnS, Sn2S3, and SnS2. In comparison with experimental data, it is found that (a) the best X–C functional to predict the structural properties of α-S is an improved GGA of PBEsol, while the worse selections are GGA-PW91, GGA-PBE, and GGA-RP; (b) the hybrid X–C functional of HSE06 is a good selection to predict the optical and electronic properties of α-S such as the band gap and dielectric constants; (c) phonon and elastic properties of α-S can be predicted reasonably well using LDA and PBEsol and in particular using the PBE + D3 and the PBEsol + D3 method; (d) the PBEsol + D3 method is the best X–C functional to compute the thermodynamic properties of α-S in terms of the quasiharmonic phonon approach, and the other reasonable functionals for this purpose are LDA as well as PBE + D3 and PBEsol. It is also possible to use a revised Debye model to predict the less-accurate results for unusual materials such as α-S. The present work demonstrates the crucial role of van der Waals correction for sulfur and S-containing compounds, making the suggested X–C functionals PBEsol + D3 and PBE + D3 (and PBEsol in some cases) for first-principles study of these materials. In addition, the strong interactions within the S8 ring of α-S and the weak van der Waals interactions between these S8 rings are also revealed quantitatively from phonon force constants and qualitatively from the differential charge density.

 	Fig. 2  Calculated errors of bulk modulus (B0 in red) and equilibrium volume (V0 in blue) with respect to experimental data for α-S. Predictions are based on both the P–V EOS and the E–V EOS in terms of different X–C functionals. Note that (i) these data are also shown in Table 1, (ii) PS represents the PBEsol, and (iii) the calculated V0 and B0 at room temperature for two examples, α-S and Li2S, are given in Table S4.†

 	Fig. 3  Calculated phonon dispersions and phonon density of state (DOS) of α-S at its theoretical equilibrium volume in terms of PBEsol (a) and PBEsol + D3 (b). Measured frequencies at Γ point by Raman and infrared spectra66 are shown by green circles, and these dispersion curves have no obvious differences with and without the LO-TO splitting, see Table S3† for more details. Note that predicted results of α-S from LDA and PBE + D3 are shown in Fig. S1.†

 	Fig. 4  Key stretching force constants of α-S (from phonon calculations) with bond length less than 6 Å predicted from PBEsol. The ordinate is on a log scale. A large positive force constant suggests strong interaction, while the small values (<0.01 eV Å−2) are ignored in this plot. The stretching force constants around −0.34 eV Å−2 are also ignored, which are for atomic pairs within the S8 ring and possessing the longest bond lengths (∼4.0–4.75 Å).

 	Fig. 8  Calculated errors of equilibrium volume (a), bulk modulus (b) and enthalpy of formation ΔH (c) with respect to experimental data for S-containing energy materials and their constituent elements. Predictions are based on the E–V EOS in terms of different X–C functionals. See also Table 2 for details.
