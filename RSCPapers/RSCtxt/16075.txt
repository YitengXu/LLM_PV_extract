    , Accepted 22nd May 2020First published on 22nd May 2020AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) employing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have drawn significant research attention in recent years. Molecular stacking and aggregation of electron donors and acceptors within the photoactive layer is vitally important for light absorption and the photon-to-electricity conversion process. Herein, we present the versatile molecular stacking of the state-of-the-art NFAs, as well as the affecting factors including the chemical structures of NFAs and physical processing conditions. We highlight in particular experimental approaches to regulate molecular stacking and aggregation and summarize the influences of these features on optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of NFA-based OSCs, which provide crucial guidance for further development of high performance OSCs.
1. Introduction
In the past few years, photovoltaic technologies have made impressive progress in both academia and industry for the purpose of generating clean, low cost and sustainable energy. In particular, organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn considerable research attention due to advantages in molecular tailoring of optoelectronic properties as well as their flexibility, light weight and solution processability.1–3 Based on the concept of a bulk heterojunction structure, OSCs were initially made of p-type polymer donors and n-type fullerene acceptors, and a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.7% has been achieved in fullerene-based OSCs.4–7 The performance of OSCs has been further improved, benefiting from enormous efforts on the development of new semiconducting materials.8–10 The emergence of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in particular represents a milestone in the development of OSCs, as their absorption spectra and energy levels can be tailored to maximize the power conversion process of OSCs.11–15 The best NFA-based OSCs have achieved PCEs of over 18% in single junction bulk heterojunction devices16 and 17.3% in a tandem architecture.17 There is no doubt that NFA-based OSCs represent the future direction of organic photovoltaics.
The early NFAs applied in OSCs are rylene diimides and their derivatives which have remarkable electron mobility and affinity. Among this type of NFA, perylene diimide (PDI) has been widely investigated.9 The PDI series exhibit strong self-assembly and molecular stacking tendency to form large-sized crystallites, which subsequently lead to over-sized phase separation and therefore a reduced donor/acceptor interface for exciton dissociation. Strategies to optimize the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology is to reduce the planarity of the PDI series via chemical structure modification, thereby decreasing the aggregation extent.11 The efficiency of the PDI series based OSCs has just surpassed 11%,15 which is still inferior to that of fullerene-based OSCs. NFAs that exhibit exceptional device efficiency usually adopt an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type molecular structure, with the electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units covalently linked via C–C bonds to form a push–pull structure to induce a charge transfer effect in molecules,12 and π spacers are sometimes introduced between the D core and A terminals to tune the optoelectronic and film-processing properties.18 The D core of NFAs can also be extended to more complex D–A–D units, e.g. the most recent Y6 series.19 The D–A–D fused core endows the backbone with better planarity and facilitates charge transport.20 Whilst some NFAs have fused-rings as the core, others employ unfused-rings as the D moiety and the noncovalent S⋯O, S⋯N and O⋯H interactions then play a vital role in generating a planar molecular backbone for efficient intermolecular π–π stacking and charge transport.21,22
Molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the D and A units rarely fall into one plane, and the side chains grafted on the D core reside perpendicularly on both sides. NFAs exhibit various molecular stacking and aggregation behaviors during the film casting process, which are significantly different from their nearly spherical fullerene acceptor counterparts (PCBM).23 Whilst some molecular stacking facilitates charge transport, other types may hinder it.24 At large length scales, the aggregation of NFAs due to different molecular stacking also has influence on the phase separated domain features,25,26 with appropriate aggregation being beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge generation, while excessive aggregation is an obstacle. It is therefore of great necessity to rationally control molecular stacking and aggregation to achieve high efficiency.27–29
This article highlights the various molecular stacking forms of the state-of-the-art NFAs. The D and A units of the NFA molecules can undergo different packing to form J-aggregation, H-aggregation and clusters in solid films, resulting in diversified photon absorption and charge transport characteristics.30–32 Due to the anisotropy and tunable chemical structure of NFAs, the electron transport can be localized in three-dimensional (3D) intermolecular networks to realize efficient carrier mobility. The larger aggregates of NFAs in highly ordered (crystals, fibrils and spherulites) and less ordered (π–π stacking or amorphous) states have a significant impact on phase separation, which plays a vital role in maximizing the efficiency of OSCs. The experimental controls of NFA stacking and aggregation are summarized in this perspective, and a fundamental understanding of how these features impact power conversion processes is presented to guide future work on developing efficient and stable OSCs towards commercialization.
2. Molecular stacking of non-fullerene acceptors
Unlike the closely packed fullerene acceptors that have an isotropic orientation, NFAs have rich structural components including a core unit, terminating units and side-chains (see Fig. 1). They undergo versatile molecular stacking that consequently determines the BHJ morphology of the photoactive layer of NFA-based OSCs.24,33–38 The key information about molecular orientation and intermolecular stacking structures can be ascertained with the help of grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) alongside absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, but unravelling the details experimentally remains challenging. Toward this end, molecular dynamics and DFT calculations have provided valuable information.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of non-fullerene NFAs discussed in this work. 
Regardless of the self-organization ability of NFAs to form a low structural order (e.g. ITIC18) or highly ordered state (e.g. COi8DFIC,39,40 and INPIC-4F41,42), molecular π–π stacking of NFAs with polymer donors and/or adjacent NFA molecules has been widely observed by experiments and simulations. Literature reports have shown versatile stacking among NFA molecules, which includes H-aggregation, A–to–A type J-aggregation, A–to–D type J-aggregation, A-to-A type clusters and A-to-D type clusters, as schematically represented in Fig. 2. The H-aggregation here refers to the π–π stacking of “D-to-D” units of two NFA molecules (i.e. side-by-side with a slipping angle less than the “magic” angle 54.7°).43 The “A-to-A” type J-aggregation refers to the end-to-end π–π stacking between the terminating A units among NFA molecules, whilst the “A-to-D” type J-aggregation refers to the π–π stacking of the “A” unit of one NFA molecule with the “D” unit of another NFA molecule. The localized molecular packing of “A-to-A” and “A-to-D” type clusters is similar to those of “A-to-A” and “A-to-D” type J-aggregation respectively, whereas the packing in J-aggregation extends monotonically over a long range, and that in clusters is restrained in a short range instead.

Molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to reveal the molecular stacking of the COi8DFIC NFA.44 After studying the geometry of a COi8DFIC molecule, it has been found that the planes of the A unit and the side chains are twisted away from the plane of the D unit due to strong steric hindrance, forming a 3D configuration. Usually, the stacking between backbones in the direction of π-orbitals of conjugated molecules has a distance of not more than 4 Å.45 As shown in Fig. 2b, the H-aggregation, with a π–π stacking distance of 3.9 Å and a slipping angle less than the magic angle of 54.7°, is clearly observed as one type of molecular stacking. Meanwhile, A-to-A (Fig. 2c) and A-to-D (Fig. 2d) type J-aggregations are also identified, with distances of 3.4 Å and 3.7 Å respectively, suggesting that the A-to-A stacking would be denser than the A-to-D stacking. Yi and coworkers revealed a three-dimensional molecular packing among ITIC molecules through intermolecular π–π stacking of the terminal A unit, i.e. forming A-to-A type J-aggregation (named chain-like aggregates in this work, see Fig. 2e).46 This A-to-A type J-aggregation can provide 3D networks for efficient charge transport, in abrupt contrast to the A-to-A (Fig. 2f) and A-to-D (Fig. 2g) type clusters where charge transport is localized and restrained in a short range.33,46 Lin et al. investigated the single crystal structure of a chlorine-substituted ITIC derivative called m-ITIC-OR-4Cl and revealed that both A-to-A and A-to-D type J-aggregates can be formed.47 Realistically, the formation of “A-to-A” and “A-to-D” type J-aggregates of NFAs has been widely reported in the literature, with much less H-aggregates being revealed due to the steric hindrance of the bulky side-chains attached to the D core.48
Li et al. experimentally realized the formation of H- and J- type aggregates in COi8DFIC via a hot-substrate film casting approach.40 COi8DFIC (or in its photovoltaic blend with PTB7-Th) prefers to grow into lamellar crystals when its chlorobenzene (CB) solution is cast at room temperature or in a solvent vapor atmosphere, but it can form face-on oriented H- and J- aggregates simultaneously when it is cast on a hot substrate held at high temperatures, e.g. 100 °C. Whilst the thermodynamic driving force to form H- or J- aggregates is not clear at this stage, hot-substrate casting apparently suppresses the formation of highly ordered lamellae and encourages π–π stacks among COi8DFIC molecules, a phenomenon that has been termed heating induced aggregation.49 Zhang et al. recently demonstrated that by adding different solvent additives into the low boiling-point chloroform (CF) solution of COi8DFIC, the formation of A-to-D type J-aggregation can be varied.44 The additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), with alkyl chains dominating its structure, has more favorable interactions with the alkyl side chains of COi8DFIC compared with additives of diphenyl ether (DPE) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) that have conjugated units, and provides side-chain flexibility to adjust conformation to form “A-to-D” type J-aggregation among the COi8DFIC backbone.
Liu et al. reported that Y6 molecules can form “A-to-A” type J-aggregation via stacking of the terminal groups.50 This kind of molecular stacking is realized by casting from the fast evaporating CF solution rather than CB solution, to form a “polymer-like” conjugated backbone to improve carrier transport. He and coworkers revealed that the trifluoromethylated Y6 derivative, i.e. BTIC-CF3-γ, would form “A-to-D” type J-aggregation and “D-to-D” type H-aggregation simultaneously.51 As shown in Fig. 3a–c, π–π stacking is formed between the end groups and between fused cores of BTIC-CF3-γ, and the interlocked F⋯N (2.98 and 3.13 Å), N⋯O (3.78 Å), F⋯S (3.49, 3.55 and 3.63 Å), N⋯N (3.75 and 3.69 Å) and N⋯S (3.63 and 3.68 Å) interactions also exist in BTIC-CF3-γ. These cooperative J/H-aggregation and multiple intermolecular interactions could lead to a 3D interpenetrating network (see Fig. 3d and e), which provides abundant electron transport junctions between adjacent NFAs to facilitate charge transport. 3D “honeycomb” can sometimes be observed within these 3D networks, being either loose or compact depending on the strength of π–π stacking and intermolecular interactions.52

The chemical structure of NFAs not only influences the energy levels, absorption spectra and other optoelectronic properties, but also directly affects the molecular stacking, and this has been demonstrated in a considerable amount of literature.53–60 For example, Yao et al. modified ITIC by changing the end group from 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) to thienyl-fused indanone to obtain a new NFA called ITCC (see Fig. 4).53 ITCC demonstrates a closer π–π stacking distance (3.7 Å for ITCC vs. 3.8 Å for ITIC as determined experimentally via GIWAXS) because the sulfur atom is easier to be polarized than the carbon atom. This is consistent with theoretical calculations of the binding energy of ITCC and ITIC dimers, with that of ITCC decreased by 2.6 kcal mol−1 therefore having a stronger tendency for intermolecular stacking. With a further modification of the thienyl-fused indanone end group, Yan et al. obtained another ITIC derivative ITCT-DM54 and found that ITCT-DM molecules form two types of J-aggregates including the A-to-A type with a π–π distance of 3.1–3.7 Å, and the A-to-D type with a π–π distance of 3.4–4.2 Å. The unique interpenetrating J-architecture of ITCT-DM still exists in the PBDB-T:ITCT-DM photoactive layer. Swick et al. extended the π-conjugation of the IDTT end group by replacing the benzene unit with a naphthyl moiety, obtaining new NFAs ITN-C9 and ITzN-C9, and found that the stronger π–π interaction of the naphthyl end groups favors the formation of J-aggregation.55
 Fig. 4  Single-crystal analysis of (a) ITIC-0F, (b) ITIC-4F and (c) ITIC-6F reveals the molecular stacking, in which J-aggregation is formed in ITIC-0F and ITIC-6F due to the face-to-face stacking of the INCN end group, and less J-aggregation is formed in ITIC-4F due to the existence of some edge-to-face packing.

Halogenation has been an effective method for modifying the end group of NFAs, which usually leads to downshifted energy levels and red-shifted absorption spectra.56–58 In Aldrich's work, the INCN terminating groups of ITIC have been fluorinated to have differing numbers of fluorine atoms from 0 to 6 (see Fig. 4a–c), and the analysis of single-crystal packing reveals that intermolecular packing is rather non-linear as the number of fluorine atoms increases.59 ITIC-0F and ITIC-6F form J-aggregation (A-to-A type in ITIC-0F and A-to-D type in ITIC-6F) due to the face-to-face packing between the INCN end groups, whilst the existence of edge-to-face packing hinders the formation of J-aggregation between ITIC-4F molecules. In Qu's work,60 a series of NFAs, IDIC-4H, IDIC-4F and IDIC-4Cl, were synthesized. The IDIC-4Cl molecule was found to exhibit a more planar structure than others, and strong Cl⋯S intermolecular interactions induce an interlocked network leading to 3D packing with ideal overlapped IDIC-4Cl molecules forming J-aggregation. In He's work,61 two NFAs ITIC-2Cl-δ and ITIC-2Cl-γ were synthesized by shifting the position of the chlorine atom on the end group. ITIC-2Cl-γ was found to form more planar π–π stacks toward 3D interpenetrating networks, indicating that different positions of the chlorine atom on the A terminal can greatly affect molecular packing.
Side chains of NFAs are normally introduced to increase solubility, whilst their difference in shape, length and branch position can significantly affect molecular interactions.62 As for ITIC, the steric effects of its out-of-plane alkyl-phenyl substituents would prevent D-to-D stacking (i.e. H-aggregation) between backbones to obtain good solubility and appropriate aggregation during film processing, with the formation of A-to-A J-aggregation via stacking of the terminal A unit being largely unaffected.46,48 In the isomerization of ITIC, Li's group synthesized m-ITIC with meta-alkyl-phenyl side-chain substitution, and this tiny change induces a predominant face-on crystalline orientation.63 In another work ITIC-Th molecules can form tighter π–π stacking after the benzene ring on the side-chains of the D core was changed to a thiophene ring.64 Lu et al.65 reported that the backbone ordering could be significantly promoted by the mutual molecular packing of ITIC and ITIC-Th when two NFAs were mixed in the ternary film. Ming et al.66 designed two NFAs (IDT-ToFIC and IDT-TiFIC) with differences in the substituted position of side-chains on the thiophene bridges. IDT-ToFIC shows a blue-shifting absorption spectrum and higher LUMO in contrast to IDT-TiFIC. Moreover, IDT-ToFIC exhibits twisted terminal groups away from the core plane, whilst IDT-TiFIC maintains a planar conjugated backbone to favor π–π stacking. He et al.67 investigated four NFAs named BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl and BTIC-HD-4Cl with different types of branched alkyl chains attached to the N atom. BTIC-BO-4Cl forms A-to-A type J-aggregation with a short π–π distance of 3.29–3.53 Å, which is beneficial for intermolecular electron hopping. Furthermore, the Cl⋯S and Cl⋯π interactions facilitate the combining of BTIC-BO-4Cl together as a kind of spiral ring structure, and the interconnecting molecules eventually form 3D interpenetrating networks. By shortening the alkyl chains connecting the thiophene units of the BTP-eC11 molecule, Hou et al. synthesized BTP-eC9 and found that BTP-eC9 exhibited enhanced electron transport properties due to more ordered intermolecular packing.68 These reports suggest that the functions of side-chains are not only to introduce solubility, but can also be a feasible way to tune molecular stacking and aggregation behavior of NFAs, thereby further impacting photovoltaic properties.
In a typical design of NFAs, D cores with high planarity are preferred in pursuit of tight π–π stacking and excellent crystallinity. Changing the number of fused rings in the core unit of NFAs is a common and widely explored strategy. The NFAs F6IC, F8IC and F10IC with six, eight, and ten fused rings respectively were synthesized by Dai et al.69 By extending the aromatic core size from 6 to 10 rings, the energy levels are upshifted and absorption is redshifted, but the effect becomes marginal when the core size is more than 8 rings; consequently the PTB7-Th/F8IC film exhibits the smallest π–π stacking distance and highest electron mobility, consistent with the observed highest device efficiency. In Li's work,49 several novel NFAs (namely COi5DFIC, COi6DFIC, COi7DFIC and COi8DFIC, shown in Fig. 5a) featuring a carbon–oxygen-bridge core demonstrate a similar effect. With the fused ring size increased from 5 to 8, the self-organization ability of these NFAs is enhanced. GIWAXS confirms that the COi5DFIC and COi6DFIC molecules grow into edge-on lamellae, but turn into a combination of edge-on and flat-on (also known as end-on) lamellae with enhanced crystallinity for COi7DFIC and COi8DFIC molecules. The observed highly ordered edge-on (Fig. 5b) and flat-on (Fig. 5c) lamellar crystallites signify molecules that are stacked away from the substrate in the direction of side chains and backbones, respectively.54,70,71 The highly ordered edge-on and flat-on lamella in COi8DFIC can be altered to undergo H- and J-type π–π stacking after blending with PTB7-Th and processing via hot-substrate casting.

The majority of D cores of NFAs contain symmetric ladder-type multi-fused rings, which provide long conjugation length and effective electron movement due to their covalently forced planarization. Li et al. designed an asymmetric ladder-type thiophene-phenylene-thieno-[3,2-b] thiophene-fused building block TPTT and the corresponding NFA TPTT-IC.72–75 The asymmetrically structured TPTT-IC gives rise to three kinds of packing models via π–π stacking of the terminal units, two of which have stronger intramolecular interactions than those of the symmetric NFA ITIC, resulting in better electron mobility.
NFAs based on non-fused rings as D cores represent another important class of acceptors. For these non-fused ring NFAs, the non-covalent intramolecular interactions (e.g. O⋯H, S⋯O, S⋯N, and N⋯H) play a vital role in allowing the formation of a planar and stackable conformation, and decent device efficiency can be achieved with the advantage of simplified synthetic routes.21,22,76 For example, Yu et al. synthesized three NFRAs (non-fused-ring acceptors, namely PTICH, PTIC and PTICO) by using unfused 2,2′-(2,5-dialkyloxy-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene (PT) as the D core and fluorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (DFIC) as the A terminal. NFRAs with O⋯H geometry conformation can rotate in solution and form J-aggregation in the solid state (described as “end-to-end” stacking in their report).22 It is also proposed that once the covalent chemical bonding in fused-ring acceptors is removed, the NFRAs prefer higher crystallinity and tighter π–π stacking with the help of non-covalent intramolecular interactions.
Donor polymers can also affect the molecular packing of NFAs when they are mixed together, thus influencing the electron mobility and efficiency of NFA based OSCs. Yan et al.77 adopted five different polymer donors (PffBT4T-2DT, PffBT-T3, PTFB-P, PTFB-O and PTB7-Th) to blend with ITIC-Th and found that the molecular packing of ITIC-Th was stronger in the PTFB-O:ITIC-Th blend than that in others. This has been suggested as a result of miscibility between ITIC-Th and these polymers, with a slightly lower miscibility between PTFB-O and ITIC-Th leading to enhanced phase separation to allow better ordering of ITIC-Th without the interference of PTFB-O. In another dedicated comparison of nonfullerene OSCs made by blending ITIC with PTFB-P and PTFB-O, both of which exhibiting a temperature-dependent aggregation behavior with PTFB-O demonstrating reduced lamellar stacking and crystallinity via the introduction of a less symmetric monomer unit, Yan et al. concluded that NFA based OSCs can yield higher efficiency when matched with a less crystalline polymer donor, through maintaining a better balance between crystallinity and domain size.78
3. Aggregation of non-fullerene acceptors
In the fabrication of OSCs, NFA aggregation and morphological evolution during the film-casting process occur concurrently due to the occurrence of molecular stacking and ordering.24,79 The aggregation of NFAs at large length scales also determines the phase separated domain features,80 which can be revealed by a number of morphological characterization techniques. For instance, atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) have been used to provide comprehensive information on domain features at multiscales.45,81
Studies show that the poor control of aggregation can lead to defects in the photoactive layer, resulting in reduced performance of OSCs.82,83 The solution casting conditions can alter the film drying time and therefore allow different molecular organization times for NFAs.42 Film-casting performed on a hot substrate (HS), at room temperature (RT), or in a solvent-vapor atmosphere has been found to facilitate abruptly different molecular ordering or crystallization processes to impact aggregation characteristics. For example, a fluorinated NFA INPIC-4F has been synthesized and reported to exhibit a high tendency to crystallize.41 By manipulating the INPIC-4F ordering time via solvents with different boiling points, the molecular packing and aggregation behavior can be tuned.84 When casting its photovoltaic blend with PBDB-T from a CB solution at room temperature, the INPIC-4F molecules crystallize into lamellae which have enough time to further aggregate into large spherulites having a diameter over 1 μm, resulting in large phase separation and a photoactive layer with high surface roughness (see Fig. 6a). This strong stacking and aggregation behavior can be suppressed by casting from a low boiling-point solvent such as CF, which evaporates much quicker than CB to kinetically inhibit the self-organization of INPIC-4F, resulting in fine phase-separated domains. Casting from a binary solution made of CB:CF (1.5:1, v/v) leads to an intermediate film drying time and results in the formation of bi-continuous phase-separated networks with appropriately sized PBDB-T and INPIC-4F aggregates for efficient charge transport (see Fig. 6b).84 This over-sized aggregation behavior of INPIC-4F can also be suppressed by casting on a hot-substrate to have a shorter molecular organization time, with GIWAXS tests confirming the conversion from edge-on lamellae to π–π stacks.42

As previously mentioned, the NFA COi8DFIC molecules also have a strong tendency to crystallize, and the aggregates can also be tuned via control of the film casting process. Room temperature casting or casting in a solvent vapor atmosphere can encourage the formation of edge-on and flat-on lamellae, which can further aggregate into large fibrils (see Fig. 6e).40 When casting on a hot-substrate held at 100 °C, the cast film becomes uniform and homogeneous without the presence of any large aggregates due to the reduced molecular organization time (see Fig. 6f). GIWAXS characterization verifies the lamellar crystalline structure in Fig. 6e and the π–π stacking feature in Fig. 6f. In Yan's work, the fibril morphology of NFAs can also be observed, but at the nanoscale.54 These nanofibrils may act as electron transport channels to improve the mobility in devices.
Solvent additives can be used to control the aggregation of NFAs to improve device efficiency.85 These solvent additives usually have higher boiling points resulting in slower film-dying, which enables a well-organized molecular structure. In fullerene-based OSCs, DIO is one of the most popular solvent additives86 and can optimize the aggregate size of PCBM for efficient OSCs.87 This additive has also been found to be effective in NFA-based OSCs, as DIO can influence the flexibility of alkyl side chains of NFAs due to their preferential interactions. Zhao et al. found that ITIC with the addition of 0.5 vol% DIO exhibited a rough surface with large irregular aggregates in PBDB-T:ITIC based OSCs.88 Song et al. found that the crystallization and coherence length of acceptors in a PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend underwent an increase with increasing concentration of another common solvent 1-chloronaphthalene (CN).89 In Hou's work,90 volatilizable solid additives, such as SA-4 and SA-7, were applied in a PBDB-TCl:IT-4F blend to investigate their influence on molecular aggregation and device performance. Although both of these solid additives can promote the stacking of IT-4F, only OSCs processed with SA-4 demonstrated increased efficiency due to its higher volatility. The incomplete volatilization of the additive SA-7 results in large crystals on the film surface (Fig. 6d) compared to the properly-sized blend film processed with SA-4 (Fig. 6c). Wang et al. recently reported fluorinated solid additives to promote π–π stacking of NFAs.91 These fluorinated solid additives, namely INB-1F, INB-3F and INB-5F, consist of a benzaldehyde moiety having different numbers of fluorine atoms and the typical terminal group 1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione as in NFAs, which ensured good miscibility as well as tunable interaction with NFAs. Their molecular dynamic simulations revealed attractive interactions between these additives and BTP-4F, leading to enhanced π–π stacking among BTP-4Fs that is supported by their GIWAXS experiments.91
4. Effects of NFA aggregation on optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of OSCs
The near-spherical shape of fullerene acceptors enables them to have close packing and aggregation in three-dimensions, resulting in good charge separation and exceptional charge transport properties.92 Although the efficiency of NFAs has surpassed that of their fullerene-based counterparts, the charge mobility of NFAs has not been found to be much higher. The two-dimensional conjugated structure of NFAs makes the molecular stacking and aggregation of NFAs crucial to the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of NFA-based OSCs.24,48
NFA molecules are face-on oriented when the π–π stacking is normal and lamellar stacking is parallel to the substrate. Face-on orientation can improve orbital overlap, exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in a high fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) which are favorable for OSCs. Hot-substrate casting has been demonstrated to induce the face-on oriented H- and J-type aggregation in COi8DFIC, which provides high-mobility charge transport channels to improve device performance.40,93 A-to-A and A-to-D type aggregation can simultaneously exist in the NFA J-architecture, in which the interconnected π–π stacks offer multiple pathways for efficient exciton diffusion and electron transport, leading to a higher mobility.53 The side chains grafted on the D cores usually impede the compact stacking of the core units, and the large distance between two conjugated planes normally hinders electron transport (see Fig. 7a). As discussed in an earlier section, the reduced π–π stacking distance of ITCC compared to ITIC enables six times higher electron mobility for ITCC, i.e. 9.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ITCC vs. 1.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ITIC.94 In Bo's work,95 three NFA (FOC6-IC, FOC6-FIC and FOC2C6-2FIC) based blend films exhibited π–π stacking distances of 3.72, 3.74 and 3.61 Å, and their electron mobilities were 4.04 × 10−5, 7.32 × 10−5 and 1.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It was concluded that planar geometries were favorable for compact and ordered molecular packing, and thereby enhanced charge mobility in the FOC2C6-2FIC based blend films.

3D molecular stacking supports multiple electron transport and therefore is crucial for high mobility. Most NFAs based on linear-shaped molecular structures exhibit low electron mobilities due to the absence of efficient electron transport channels. Zhan and coworkers synthesized a fluorinated NFA FINIC via introduction of fluorine atoms into INIC and realized compact 3D molecular conjugation and multidimensional transport (see Fig. 7b–e).52 As shown in Fig. 7b and c, INIC molecules with planar and linear geometric conformations exhibited J-aggregates and loose “honeycomb” shaped stacks caused by π–π interactions. FINIC formed more complicated stacking due to the intermolecular interaction caused by fluorination (see Fig. 4d and e), forming compact 3D “honeycomb” networks with decreased π–π distances through the synergistic effects of C–H⋯O hydrogen-bonding, F⋯S interactions and π–π stacking. This modification guarantees FINIC more rapid charge transport along the horizontal and vertical directions than INIC, featuring a charge mobility of 8.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to 9.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 of INIC.
In J-aggregation with the Coulomb coupling being negative, electrons need a lower energy to be excited, and this is beneficial to obtain more excitons and a higher photocurrent.96 In contrast, electrons in H-aggregation with positive Coulomb coupling need a higher energy to be excited. These two features will lead to red- and blue- shift absorption spectra in J- and H- aggregation respectively.43,97 The absorption spectra of COi8DFIC films cast at room temperature (RT), at room temperature with the presence of solvent vapor (RT + SA), and on a hot-substrate held at 100 °C are shown in Fig. 7b. With the formation of a lamellar crystalline structure, the absorption spectrum of the COi8DFIC film is relatively narrow with a strong primary peak at 850 nm, but turns broad with enhanced absorption in both short and long wavelengths after hot-substrate casting, although the primary peak is slightly weaker (see Fig. 7b). The enhanced absorption in the short and long wavelengths originates from the formation of H- and J- aggregates respectively during hot-substrate casting. This broadened absorption significantly increases the short-circuit current of the resulting OSC (see Fig. 7c) and results in an enhanced PCE of 13.8% featuring the coexistence of H- and J- aggregation in the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC photoactive layer, compared to a PCE of 9.3% only when edge-on and flat-on lamellae are the primary molecular order. These H- and J- aggregations are also found to be beneficial toward the storage lifetime of PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC OSCs.26,40 The molecular packing and orientation also affect exciton dissociation efficiency. The electron donor PTB7-Th adopts a face-on orientation in the pure form and its blend with COi8DFIC, but PTB7-Th and COi8DFIC molecules can be adjusted either parallel or perpendicular to each other by converting the edge-on or flat-on lamellae to face-on H- and J- aggregation, and it has been found that the exciton dissociation efficiency is around 96.6% when the donor and acceptor are parallel, and is much lower at 92.6% only when they are perpendicular to each other.
Large aggregates formed in the active layer, such as spherical INPIC-4F and large fibrillar COi8DFIC, will lead to excessive phase separation and poor charge transport, resulting in an abrupt reduction of the photovoltaic performance.40,42,84,98 However, the NFA fibril network strategy is a promising method to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Recently, an NFA IDMIC-4F forming a fibrillar structure has been employed as the third component in a PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F binary cell.99 The presence of this fibrillar structure confines the growth of host donors and acceptors to fine domains, and they also act as charge transport channels to enhance electron mobility. Single junction ternary devices incorporating IDMIC-4F exhibit enhanced carrier mobility and achieve a maximum PCE of 16.6% compared to 15.7% of the binary device. Aiming at suppressing the over-sized aggregation of NFAs, Du et al.100 put forward a novel ternary strategy to minimize the negative impact of the planar structure forming over-sized aggregates by adding the third component DIBC in a PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend. The formation of intermolecular hydrogen-bonds between DIBC and IEICO-4F can increase the molecular stacking distance. As a result, aggregation can be controlled in a suitable range, and the PCE is increased to 16.4% from 15%.
By replacing the liquid additive DIO with fluorinated solid additives in the BTP-4F NFA, Cai et al. were able to dramatically enhance the π–π stacking among BTP-4F molecules, as evidenced via both molecular dynamics simulations (Fig. 8a) and GIWAXS characterization (Fig. 8b) and improved the PCE of PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4F binary solar cells from 15.2% to 16.5% (Fig. 8c).91 Different from DIO that is hard to evaporate from the solid photoactive layer due to its high boiling point as well as confinement to the glassy film, the solid additives can be removed from the active layer easily via a moderate thermal treatment around 100 °C for ten minutes to improve the long-term device stability (Fig. 8d–g). Solid additives are therefore superior to traditional liquid additives and represent a promising direction that deserves further exploration.

5. Summary and outlook
In this perspective, we have summarized various molecular stacking forms of the state-of-the-art NFAs, including A-to-A type and A-to-D type J-aggregation and A-to-A type and A-to-D type clusters, as well as H-aggregation. The influences of different chemical structures, including the core units, terminating groups and side-chains, on molecular stacking are analyzed, and the impact of these characteristics on charge transport, light absorption, and exciton dissociation properties is discussed. Physical approaches to manipulate the molecular packing and aggregation of NFAs, including hot-substrate casting, and casting in the presence of solvent vapors, solvent mixtures and additives are also presented. The formation of 3D interconnected, J-aggregated π–π stacks to facilitate charge transport, the suppression of over-sized aggregation into nanoscale domains, and the fibrillar charge transport channels will facilitate the photon-to-electron conversion process. There is no doubt that dedicated control of the molecular stacking and aggregation of NFAs via the synergistic effects of chemical design and physical tuning to maximize the light absorption, and charge generation and collection will lead to the achievement of device efficiency over 20% in single junction OSCs in the near future.
