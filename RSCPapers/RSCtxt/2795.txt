    , Accepted 12th March 2019First published on 13th March 2019AbstractA new electron-rich central core (BTT) based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene with a thio[3,2-b]thiophene side chain was coupled with methyl and fluorine-modified 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) electron-withdrawing end groups to furnish two novel non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), namely BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC. Compared to BTT-MIC, BTT-FIC exhibits a stronger near-infrared (NIR) absorption with a smaller optical bandgap (1.47 eV). The BTT-FIC/PM6 based device achieved a champion PCE of 12.65% for benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]di(cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene)-containing NFA based organic solar cells (OSCs), while the BTT-FIC/PM6 based device delivered a PCE of 10.04% with a high Voc of over 1 V. Fluorinated IC is more suitable for this new core BTT than methyl substituted IC, because fluorine atoms enhance the charge transport (CT) state (absorption) and are also beneficial to exciton dissociation, charge mobility and morphology. This work revealed that BTT with a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene side chain is an effective electron-donating core for creating effective NFAs and fluorinated IC is a suitable end group for BTT.
Compared to the traditional polymer-fullerene blend system, solution-processed OSCs with NFAs have attracted considerable interest due to their unique merits of highly tunable properties including their optical absorption, energy levels and crystallinity via chemical modification.1–6 Numerous highly efficient NFAs have been developed and the state-of-the-art single-junction NFA OSCs have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 13%.7–11 Particularly, fused-ring core-based NFAs adopting the molecular design strategy of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbone architectures have become the most successful and greatest potential materials for use in OSCs.12–20 A–D–A-type NFAs consisting of a fused-ring electron-donating core as the central building block and electron-withdrawing end groups could offer distinctive advantages, such as wide and intense absorption in the visible-NIR region, tunable energy levels, high electron mobility and suitable crystallization properties. In pursuing high-performance OSCs, great efforts are currently being made to optimize the A–D–A-type NFA structures of electron-donating central cores, electron-withdrawing end groups and the bridges between the core and the end groups.21–30 It is found that most high-performance A–D–A-type NFAs with a narrow bandgap (1.5–1.7 eV) could achieve impressive PCEs owing to their small trade-off between the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the short-circuit current density (Jsc).12,14,31,32 Since the Voc of OSCs is directly proportional to the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the acceptor, NFAs with elevated LUMO levels have been used to obtain high Voc.33 However, many of the narrow bandgap NFA (Eg < 1.5 eV) based OSCs always showed very high Jsc (19–22 mA cm−2), but relatively low Voc (approximately 0.75 V), resulting in moderate PCEs within 11%.34–36 It is found that the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state between the fused-ring core and the end groups gives red-shifted absorption, which is beneficial for harvesting photons and enhancing the Jsc but meanwhile accompanied by the sacrifice of Voc with decreased LUMO levels. There is a problematic trade-off between the Jsc and the Voc for matching new narrow bandgap (Eg < 1.5 eV) NFAs with medium bandgap polymer donors, which is one of the most crucial issues that limit the further improvement of the device performance. Nevertheless, designing an appropriate molecular design strategy from a materials perspective to address this issue is still a challenge.
To the best of our knowledge, electron-donating fused-ring central cores as an essential building block play a key role in the structure of A–D–A-type NFAs, thus significantly impacting their photovoltaic performance.37 Currently, improving the electron-donating capability of the fused-ring core is probably one of the most used strategies for enhancing the intramolecular ICT effect to achieve narrow bandgap A–D–A-type NFAs with optical absorption in the NIR region, which is one of the ideal cases for further optimizing the overall OSC performance. The common strategy for construction of more electron-donating fused-ring cores is to extend the conjugation length of the aromatic heterocycle by incorporating thiophene.38–40 For example, the analogues of the star molecule 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC) with rings of the core varying from 5, 7 to 9 by modulating the number of thiophene showed a gradually reduced Eg of 1.77, 1.73 and 1.55 eV, respectively.41–44 However, these indacenodithiophene-based ladder-type cores suffer from relatively weak electron-donating capability and intermolecular interaction, leading to a relatively large bandgap (≥1.5 eV), which impedes the development of A–D–A-type NFA (Eg < 1.5 eV)-based OSCs. To date, a few large fused-ring donor units have been developed and used as building blocks to prepare A–D–A-type NFAs, and the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]di(cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene) (FBDT) unit has been demonstrated as a prospective block for designing new and excellent performance A–D–A-type NFAs. For example, a novel NFA based on the FBDT unit was first reported by Chen with an optimized PCE of 10.42%.45 Furthermore, 2-ethylhexyloxy was introduced on the FBDT core to obtain 4,4,10,10-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-5,11-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-4,10-(dihydrodithien-yl[1,2-b:4,5-b′]benzodithiophene-2,8-diyl)bis(2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene))malononitrile (BT-IC) with narrower Eg of up to 1.43 eV showing more pronounced red-shifted absorption compared to those indacenodithiophene based NFAs, and a J71:BT-IC-based device with a PCE of 10.5% was obtained.46 Subsequently, Zhan reported that ITIC-2 based on an FBDT core with conjugated 5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene as side chains achieved an encouraging PCE of 11% when blended the wide-bandgap polymer donor poly[(2,6-(4,8-(3-hexylundecyl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-alt-(4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2-(2-butyloctyl)-5,6-difluoro-2-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole)] (FTAZ).47 In addition, the ITIC-2 derivative named BDTThIT-M acceptor was obtained by Zhang' group through replacing hydrogen atoms of the end-group with methyl which was then blended with the polymer donor poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T) to give a higher device PCE of 12.12%.48 These promising achievements indicated the potential of using FBDT as the core for designing novel NFAs for OSCs. It has been well-recognized that ideal NFAs should simultaneously possess the properties of strong light harvesting abilities, proper energy levels, high electron affinity and high electron mobility.29,49,50 Thus, developing new larger ladder-type fused cores as central building blocks utilizing the A–D–A architecture appears to be a good way to obtain higher performance NFAs.
A general methodology in our previous work was proposed for straightforward access to 4,8-functionalized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) via Pd mediated coupling reactions, and the larger planar structure of the fused thio[3,2-b]-thiophene (TT) unit vertical to the core of BDT was successfully synthesized and exhibited the conjugation extension (25 nm) of absorption compared to that of the single thiophene analogue.51 Motivated by the superior performance of these materials, we introduced TT side chains onto the FBDT molecular backbone as fused-ring conjugated side chains to design and synthesize a new larger ladder-type BTT fused core due to its more delocalized π-electron conjugation structure compared to that of FBDT's counterpart. On the other hand, suitable electron-withdrawing end-groups are also important to achieve high performance A–D–A-type NFAs. IC and its derivatives have been proved to be the most successful electron-withdrawing end-groups.52–55 In this work, two electron-withdrawing end-groups including methyl-modified and fluorine-modified IC are coupled with the BTT fused core to afford BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC acceptors. BTT-FIC with fluorinated IC shows a wide absorption range extending to the NIR region with a narrower Eg of up to 1.47 eV than that of BTT-MIC owing to the higher electron affinity of fluorine atoms. With the wide-bandgap polymer donor poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl))-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PM6) (Scheme 1b), BTT-FIC-based OSCs achieved a PCE as high as 12.65% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 18.54 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 71.6%, while BTT-MIC-based OSCs delivered a PCE of 10.04% with a high Voc of over 1 V and relatively low Jsc and FF. The more electron-rich methyl substituent up-shifts the LUMO energy level of BTT-MIC to improve the Voc. The simultaneously enhanced Jsc and FF of BTT-FIC-based OSCs could be attributed to the fact that the higher electron-withdrawing ability of fluorine atoms enhances the stronger ICT resulting in a better light-harvesting ability, and improves better exciton dissociation, charge mobility and morphology. It should be noted that the PCE of 12.65% is the highest value so far for FBDT-containing NFA based OSCs.

The synthetic routes and molecular structures of BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC are shown in Scheme 1a. Compound 2 was synthesized by Stille cross-coupling between compound 151 and ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate under the Pd catalyst in 80% yield. The key intermediate compound 3 with two ester groups was subjected to double addition reactions using (4-hexylphenyl)magnesium bromide as the nucleophilic reagent, followed by acid-mediated intramolecular Friedel–Crafts reactions to obtain compound 3 in a two-step overall yield of 43%. Double formyl groups of compound 3 were introduced by lithium reagent reaction to afford compound 4 in 81% isolated yield. Effective Knoevenagel condensation reactions between compound 4 and 2-(5/6-methyl-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (MIC) and 2-(5/6-fluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (FIC) were conducted to afford BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC in isolated yields of 85% and 88%, respectively. BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC show good solubility in commonly used solvents such as chlorobenzene and chloroform, meeting the basic requirements for solution-processing.
The molecular geometries and electronic properties of BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC were investigated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level (Fig. 1). Both BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC possess a highly planar backbone and conjugated TT side-chains are almost perpendicular to the molecular plane. It was found that the HOMO mainly localized on the central core units while the LUMO delocalized on the backbone. It is evidenced that the benzene ring of IC is involved in the LUMO of the IC-conjugated NFAs.50 It is effective to tune the LUMO energy level of NFAs by modifying the benzene ring of IC through introducing fluorine atoms or methyl groups.48,50–52 The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.38/−3.42 eV for BTT-MIC, higher than the −5.43/−3.51 eV for BTT-FIC, which could be because the electron-donating properties of the methyl group led to the upshift of the acceptor’s LUMO and HOMO levels. The trend of the calculated HOMO and LUMO changes is consistent with the electrochemical results (the measured values are listed in Table 1).

The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC in both chloroform solutions and solid films are measured and shown in Fig. 2a, and the detailed optical data are summarized in Table 1. Complementary absorption between the two NFAs and the donor PM6 was obviously observed. BTT-MIC exhibits an absorption peak at 704 nm with an absorption coefficient of 1.04 × 105 M−1 cm−1, while BTT-FIC exhibits an absorption peak at 720 nm with an absorption coefficient of 1.36 × 105 M−1 cm−1. The red-shifted absorption peaks of BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC films are located at 740 nm and 766 nm relative to those in solution due to the intense intermolecular π–π stacking. The BTT-FIC film shows broader absorption spectra ranging from 550 to 850 nm compared with those of the BTT-MIC film, which would benefit harvesting low-energy photons. The Eoptg values of BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC estimated from the absorption edge of the thin film are 1.53 eV and 1.47 eV, respectively. The energy levels of BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC were investigated by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 2b). The HOMO/LUMO energy levels (Table 1) of BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC are estimated from the oxidation/reduction potentials, respectively. BTT-MIC shows slightly higher HOMO (−5.55 eV) and LUMO (−3.76 eV) energy levels relative to those of BTT-FIC (HOMO: −5.64 eV and LUMO: −3.87 eV), which is ascribed to the more electron-rich nature of the methyl group compared to the F atom. The electron mobilities of BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC were measured by adopting the space charge limited current (SCLC) method based on electron-only devices with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/Al (Fig. S1†). The electron mobilities of BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC are 1.63 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.87 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The planar molecular backbones of both NFAs facilitate molecular stacking and charge carrier transport, resulting in relatively high mobility. To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the two NFAs, a series of OSCs based on PM6 as the donor (D) and BTT-MIC or BTT-FIC as the acceptor (A) were fabricated with a device configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-styrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PDIN/Al. The D:A blend ratio, the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive and thermal annealing treatments were optimized to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. The results of the different optimization processes are provided in Fig. S2 and Table S1.† The optimized experimental conditions are a D:A blend ratio of 1:1 (wt/wt), 0.75 vol% of the DIO additive and active layers with annealing treatment at 100 °C for 5 min.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of OSCs based on PM6:BTT-MIC and PM6:BTT-FIC under solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of OSCs are listed in Table 2. The optimized PM6:BTT-MIC-based OSCs exhibit a PCE of 10.04% with a high Voc of 1.027 V, a Jsc of 15.90 mA cm−2 and an FF of 61.51%. For the PM6:BTT-FIC-based OSCs, a higher PCE of 12.65% with a Voc of 0.953 V, a Jsc of 18.54 mA cm−2 and an FF of 71.63% was obtained. It was obviously observed that the Voc of BTT-FIC-based OSCs is smaller than that of BTT-MIC-based cells due to the lower LUMO levels of BTT-FIC, which can be well compensated by the higher Jsc and FF values. The higher Jsc for BTT-FIC-based OSCs should be mainly attributed to the significantly enhanced absorption of BTT-FIC in the NIR region relative to the BTT-MIC.8,9,36 The higher FF of BTT-FIC-based OSCs suggests the well developed morphology of PM6:BTT-FIC blend films for efficient charge transport and collection. The statistical PCE distribution histograms of two kinds of OSCs according to 40 samples prepared from different batches was to exhibit the repeatability of this experiment, which is presented in Fig. 3b. The average PCEs of BTT-MIC- and BTT-FIC-based OSCs are approximately 9.82% and 12.46%, respectively. As far as we know, the PCE of 12.65% is the highest value so far for FBDT-containing NFA based OSCs. Fig. 3c presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized BTT-MIC- and BTT-FIC-based OSCs. According to the EQE spectra, the calculated Jsc values are 15.46 mA cm−2 and 18.35 mA cm−2 for BTT-MIC- and BTT-FIC-based OSCs, respectively, which are slightly less than the measured Jsc values with errors less than 3%. The EQE values in the short wavelength range from 400 nm to 650 nm are mainly related to the contribution of PM6, and the EQE values in the long wavelength range from 650 nm to 800 nm are mainly attributed to the acceptors. The BTT-FIC-based OSCs show wider and stronger photocurrent responses in the long wavelength range than BTT-MIC-based cells, which is consistent with the trend of absorption profiles for their films. Furthermore, EQE values of PM6:BTT-FIC-based OSCs are also higher than those of PM6:BTT-MIC-based cells, which suggests the efficient utilization of excitons in BTT-FIC-based OSCs.

To investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties of the BTT-MIC- or BTT-FIC-based OSCs, the dependence of the photocurrent density Jph (Jph = JL − JD) on the effective voltage Veff (Veff = Vo − Va) was investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 3d, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively, Va is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero. The key parameters extracted from Jph–Veff curves are listed in Table S2.† It is generally assumed that all photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charges and efficiently collected by individual electrodes at high Veff. The saturated current density (Jsat) is mainly determined by the maximal exciton generation rate (Gmax). As a result, Jsat = qLGmax, where L is the thickness of the active layer. The BTT-FIC-based OSCs exhibit a higher Gmax value of 1.22 × 1028 m−3 s−1 than that of BTT-MIC-based cells (1.16 × 1028 m−3 s−1), which should result from the enhanced light absorption of the PM6:BTT-FIC film compared with the PM6:BTT-MIC film. The Jsat of BTT-FIC-based OSCs shows an enhancement of ≈5.3% compared to BTT-MIC-based cells, which is much lower the amplification of Jsc (16.6%) for the corresponding OSCs. This further indicates the efficient utilization for BTT-FIC-based OSCs. As displayed in Fig. 3d, the Jph of BTT-FIC-based OSCs can rapidly approach higher saturation photocurrent (Jsat) compared with that of the BTT-MIC-based cells, suggesting efficient photon harvesting, exciton dissociation, and charge carrier transport and collection. The probability of exciton dissociation and charge collection can generally be estimated by the Jph/Jsat values under short circuit and maximal power output conditions, respectively.10,48,56 Under short-circuit conditions, the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) of the device based on BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC are 85.25% and 94.97%, respectively (Table S2†). This result suggests that the process of dissociation of photo-generated excitons into free charges for the BTT-FIC based device is more efficient than that of the BTT-MIC based device. Under maximal power output conditions, the Jph/Jsat value of 79.25% for BTT-FIC based OSCs is also larger than the 67.08% for BTT-MIC based cells, indicating efficient charge collection in BTT-FIC based OSCs. To study the charge transport properties of the optimized devices, the hole and electron mobilities of these blend films were calculated by using the SCLC method (Fig. S3 and Table S3†). Relative to the PM6:BTT-MIC blend film (electron mobility μe = 7.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; hole mobility μh = 5.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe/μh = 2.16), the PM6:BTT-FIC film possesses higher and more symmetric mobilities (μe = 7.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; μh = 5.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe/μh = 1.33), resulting in the highly efficient EQE response and higher FF (about 0.71) value, which can be further confirmed from the small series resistance (RS) and large shunt resistance (RSH) of the corresponding OSCs.48
In order to gain more insights into the observed difference in device performance, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterize the surface morphological properties of the active layers, as shown in Fig. 4. It is apparently observed that both kinds of blend films exhibit a quite uniform and smooth surface. The root mean-square (RMS) roughness values of PM6:BTT-MIC and PM6:BTT-FIC blend films are 0.748 nm and 0.618 nm (Fig. 4a and b), which indicates the good miscibility of the donor and acceptor components in the blend films. The PM6:BTT-FIC blend films exhibit more obvious phase separation than PM6:BTT-MIC blend films, which helps to improve the efficiency of exciton dissociation. In addition, the fibrous features and flocculent structure are also seen from the TEM images of PM6:BTT-MIC and PM6:BTT-FIC blend films (Fig. 4e and f), respectively. A more homogeneous bi-continuous interpenetrating network structure is formed in PM6:BTT-FIC blend films, which is favourable for improving exciton dissociation and charge transport for achieving high Jsc and FF.

Conclusions
In summary, a new benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene side-chain electron-rich central core (BTT) and two novel NFAs (BTT-MIC and BTT-FIC) with methyl-modified and fluorine-modified IC end groups are designed and successfully synthesized for use in OSCs. BTT-FIC shows a wide absorption range extending to the NIR region with a narrower Eg of up to 1.47 eV and down-shifted HOMO/LUMO energy levels relative to BTT-MIC. With the wide-bandgap polymer donor PM6, BTT-FIC-based OSCs achieved a PCE of 12.65% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 18.54 mA cm−2 and an FF of 71.6%, while BTT-MIC-based OSCs delivered a PCE of 10.04% with a high Voc of over 1 V and relatively low Jsc and FF. As far as we know, the PCE of 12.65% is the highest value so far for FBDT-containing NFA based OSCs. The PM6:BTT-FIC blend film exhibited not only a better light-harvesting ability and more balanced electron/hole mobility but also showed more suitable phase separation for efficient exciton dissociation and collection, resulting in a simultaneously enhanced Jsc and FF in comparison to the PM6:BTT-MIC blend film. This is mainly attributed to the higher electron affinity fluorine atoms. In addition, it was demonstrated that the BTT-MIC-based OSCs achieved a higher Voc relative to BTT-FIC-based OSCs by modulating the LUMO level via methylation of end-groups. We believe that the combination of the BTT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene fused-ring side chain electron-donating core and the fluorinated IC end group is an effective strategy to design high-performance NIR-absorption NFAs.
