    , Accepted 11th March 2015First published on 11th March 2015AbstractPolymer solar cells (PSCs) are apparently becoming one of the leading technologies to reduce our dependency on traditional power sources. However, the frequent use of a transparent conductive electrode, indium-tin-oxide (ITO), in the present PSC technologies has increased the overall expenses. In addition, its brittleness in nature could limit the future development of PSCs, particularly in a flexible format. Here, we report on the development of Au-doped single layer graphene nanoribbons (Au-doped SLGNRs) as an option to the transparent conducting electrode (indium tin oxide, ITO) that could yield a single-layer PSC with power conversion and external quantum efficiencies comparable to commonly used transparent electrodes. When the Au-doped SLGNRs are implemented in tandem architecture, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.48% is achieved. This is the highest efficiency for ITO-free tandem PSCs to date. The improved performance of the Au-doped SLGNR anode is characterized to the structure of the device that enables a hole transport from the active layer into the Au-doped SLGNR anode.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells have been the center of attraction since the last few decades as they offer numerous advantages including lightweight, low-cost fabrication, non-toxicity, mechanical flexibility and easy fabrication. However, as our indium price has risen up rapidly, there is a clear and urgent need for potential replacement of our commonly used transparent conducting electrode, indium tin oxide (ITO). Hence, in this study, we fabricated ITO-free tandem polymer solar cells utilizing Au-doped single layer graphene nanoribbons as the transparent electrode and hopefully we are able to convince researchers in this theme that there is a life after indium.

Significant improvements in the performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs) were seen in the last few years through excellent donor materials, control of processing conditions, control of morphology of the active layer and purification.1–10 PSCs have become popular due to their various advantages that include large area fabrication, ease of fabrication and simple solution processability.5–7 They are lightweight, flexible, and cost-effective in the production process. Recently, the transparent conductive electrode (TCE) has become one of the considerable focuses of research activities among all elements in PSCs, since it has been used in many optoelectronic devices as a perquisite material. Some main requirements of TCE are high transparency (>90%) in the visible regime, low sheet resistance (Rs) (∼10 Ω sq.−1) and uniformity over the electrode area.
Today, indium-tin-oxide (ITO) is a commonly used TCE in PSCs1–10 due to its excellent attributes in both optical and electrical properties. Yet, ITO has substantial limitations that could likely restraint future advancements of PSC technology. In general, high annealing temperature allows the production of superior grade ITO. Higher Rs was seen in ITO coated on flexible substrates like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) compared to ITO coated on a glass substrate, in which cold hampered its flexibility because of the brittleness of the ceramic coating.11,12 Consequently, this could limit the future developments of PSCs specifically in flexible, rollable, or foldable formats. In addition to being costly13,14 because of the minimal amount of output relative to the input deposition process and the cost of the substance, the indium element in our frequently used ITO could lead to deterioration in its operation when diffusing through PSCs' active layers.15 Hence, it is crucial that we develop transparent electrodes that are cost-effective, mechanically flexible, and chemically stable for the future of PSCs.
PSCs also play a major role in the concept of flexibility applied to large area mass production by a roll-to-roll process.16–23 Moreover, there is a limited detailed in cost for PSC because of some serious production issues even though the cell efficiency has been the main focus during the past few years. According to Krebs et al., the total cost of the PSC modules ranges from €6.16 m−2 to €191.89 m−2.20a Based on this comprehensive study, it is proven that apart from the cost of processing, the low cost of raw materials used in each layer has also led to the minimal cost of PSC. Hence, it is crucial to reduce the processing cost in order to make sure that the cost of our PSC doesn't hit a relatively high value.20a Moreover, solar cells based on inorganic materials are currently the main commercially used devices because of their relatively high efficiencies (e.g., 15–20% for silicon-based solar cells); nevertheless, these devices are limited by their high fabrication cost and related environmental issues.20b Finally, stability and reliability are other important issues that have been identified as the main focus.19,24–29
Recently, graphene has triggered a lot of interest in both industrial and academic sectors. Graphene has become a great option as a flexible transparent conductor due to its excellent electrical and mechanical properties.30–33 On the basis of symmetric conical band structure, the high carrier density of ∼1014 cm−2 could be obtained via doping without sacrificing its carrier mobility,34,35 leading to a reduced Rs. Apart from the high carrier density, there were no physical and electrical deteriorations that occurred in the bending tests.31 Today, graphene has the smallest bending radius among other flexible transparent conductors which is as small as one.36 Various experimental studies have explored this impressive feature which involved the use of graphene electrodes in numerous devices such as field-effect transistors,37 touch screens,38 liquid crystal displays,39 PSCs40 and organic light emitting diodes.41–43
A pioneering work of deploying graphene as TCE in PSCs40 demonstrated the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.45% only. The inefficient transport of charge from the active layers into the graphene electrode has resulted in a significantly lower efficiency obtained compared to the reference device made on ITO. Zhang et al.44 showed enhanced performance on graphene electrodes. Despite the significant enhanced performance, the graphene electrode also demonstrated a high Rs of 1.2 kΩ sq.−1.
We have recently demonstrated the use of a graphene mesh as a transparent anode in a high performance semi-transparent tandem PSC. In this study, we demonstrated an Rs of 8.6 kΩ sq.−1 with 90% transparency. Despite high Rs, we were able to achieve 8.02% PCE along with a high VOC of 1.62 V.30 Apart from placing a graphene mesh as the transparent anode, we also demonstrated its capability to be used as the interconnecting layer (ICL). In this study, we used a titanium oxide (TiOx) layer paired with a graphene oxide (GO) layer as the recombination layer.45 Surprisingly, there is no voltage loss in that particular device where we achieved 1.60 V VOC for the tandem PSCs. A recent study by Chen and co-workers demonstrated the usage of a GO/Cesium neutralized GO bilayer modified with ultrathin Al and molybdenum oxide (MoO3) as the recombination layer. In this study, they achieved a VOC of 1.69 V giving a PCE of 3.91%.46 The excellent energy level matches the efficient charge transport and recombination has led to the high performance tandem PSC.
Even though there has been a lot of advancement in photovoltaic technology lately, specifically tandem cells, reports on high performance tandem cells using ITO-free architecture remain restricted. In order to produce high efficiency PSCs, efficient hole transport to the anode from the active layer is highly preferred. Therefore, a high work function (WF) anode is required in equalizing the deep lying highest-occupied molecular-orbital (HOMO) energy level of active layers. Although Au-doped single layer graphene nanoribbons (SLGNRs) possess a better work function of 5.1 eV, it is still inadequate for hole transporting from donor materials like (SMPV1), which has a HOMO level of 5.51 eV. In this work, the SLGNRs were grown by a chemical vapour deposition process with a Cu foil47 and later transferred onto plastic or glass substrates48,49 for tandem cell fabrication. The yield and quantity of SLGNRs (width 10–30 nm) exceeds those of previously reported values of GNRs.50,51 In this study, we incorporate anode interfacial layers (AIL) consisting of a transition metal oxide (tungsten trioxide, WO3) to continuously improve the WF of the Au-doped SLGNRs anode, relative to their tasks in modifying the WF of ITO electrodes in organic electronics.52–57 Lack of nucleation in initializing the film growth has affected the growth of WO3 on SLGNRs in which they do not grow as uniform films.55,56 In order to ensure good and uniform wettability, it is vital to spin-cast a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) on Au-doped SLGNR. Through thermal evaporation, WO3, was later deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer.

Fig. 1a shows the p-type chemical doping process by dispersing the SLGNRs in water containing AuCl3. It was found that the carbon nanotubes appeared to be stable over time by utilizing the same method. Fig. 1b demonstrates the Raman spectra of undoped and doped SLGNRs. The G peak of doped graphene shifted from 1591 cm−1 (undoped SLGNRs) to 1608 cm−1. After the doping process had taken place, the carrier density and mobility of doped SLGNRs increased significantly (discussed below).
 Fig. 1  (a) The doping process illustration. (b) Raman spectra of undoped SLGNRs and Au-doped SLGNRs. 
For doping of SLGNRs, the dopant solution with various doping concentrations was dropped on the SLGNR film. Fig. 2 shows the effects of doping concentration on the surface topographies of Au-doped SLGNR film. As shown in Fig. 2a, the as-prepared SLGNR film was found to be a single layer evidenced by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height profile. AFM can be considered one of the most popular techniques used in PSC characterization.20b In addition, the roughness (Rq) and thickness (t) of Au-doped SLGNRs were found to be almost identical. As shown in Fig. 2b–f, spots of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) (∼10–30 nm) were distributed on the surface of the SLGNR films. As the doping concentration increases, the SLGNR surface becomes more roughened and this can be clearly seen from the Rq value, where it is found to be proportional to doping concentrations (Fig. 2g). With the increment in dopant concentration from 0 to 15 mM, the Rq and t values enhanced to ∼4.59 and ∼3 nm respectively. Rs was measured as a function of doping concentration for the Au-doped SLGNRs films transferred onto 300 nm SiO2/Si. The Rs of the as-prepared Au-doped SLGNRs ranges from 350 to 221 Ω sq.−1 as shown in Fig. 2g. Fig. 2h demonstrates the percentage change of Rs and the absolute Rs as a function of doping concentration. As doping concentration increases up to 3 mM, the Rs sharply decreases to ∼261 Ω sq.−1, but above 5 mM it starts to saturate, and finally reaches 221 Ω sq.−1 (∼36.85% change) at a doping concentration of 15 mM. These results suggest that by controlling doping concentration Rs can be adjusted to the values required. The doping concentration effect was further analysed by fabricating a SLGNR transistor. The as prepared SLGNRs and doped SLGNRs were transferred onto the substrates followed by the deposition of Au as source/drain electrodes, while n+ Si was chosen to be the gate electrode. Fig. 2i exhibits the transfer characteristics (IDSversus VGS, VGS = 0 V) of the fabricated SLGNR transistors under different conditions, where IDS is the channel current, VDS is the drain voltage, and VG is the gate voltage. We observed a p-type doping behaviour of SLGNRs due to the absorbed water since the Dirac point is located at ∼50 V VG in the as-prepared SLGNR transistors. In contrast, the Au-doped SLGNR transistor demonstrates the increase in the current IDS at zero VG, which is consistent with the decrease in Rs of about 36.85% (Fig. 2h) along with a clear p-type doping effect and the shifted of the Dirac point to higher VG compared to that of the as-prepared SLGNR transistor. It is generally accepted that PEDOT:PSS is a p-doped conducting polymer with a work function of ∼5 eV, which is a little bit higher than that of graphene (4.9 eV); electrons will transfer from SLGNRs to PEDOT:PSS after the coating and thus the SLGNRs will be doped with holes. Thus, the decrease of sheet resistance is mainly due to the p-type doping by AuCl3 solution. The distribution of carrier concentration and Hall mobility for as-prepared and Au-doped SLGNRs (at zero bias) is shown in Fig. 2i. After doping of 15 mM AuCl3, the average Hall mobility lessens from 1374 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1005 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the presence of additional charge impurity scattering.

To verify the uniformity of WO3, Fig. 3b and d compare the atomic force microscopy images of the WO3 film on ITO and Au-doped SLGNRs. The surface RMS roughness of the pristine ITO was 0.73 nm. The RMS roughness significantly reduced to 0.28 nm after deposition of 4 nm WO3. However, the RMS roughness remarkably increased from 0.43 nm (Fig. 3a) to 0.83 nm after the direct deposition of 4 nm WO3 on Au-doped SLGNRs was transferred on the glass substrate, and this is due to the WO3 cluster (Fig. 3c). A very thick WO3 layer can basically cover the whole surface; however, one should bear in mind that electrical characteristics will be significantly affected with a thick layer of WO3 which contributes to a high resistance and inhomogeneity contact to Au-doped SLGNRs. Highly uniform film growth can be seen since the RMS roughness is reduced to 0.41 nm (Fig. 3d) from 0.85 nm (Fig. 3a) after the deposition of 4 nm WO3 on PEDOT:PSS on Au-doped SLGNRs, similar to that of WO3 on ITO. Fig. 3e compares the transmittance of the WO3/PEDOT:PSS/Au-doped SLGNRs layers (>95%) with Au-doped SLGNRs (∼97%) and double-layer GNRs (DLGNRs). It is worth to note that the transmittance of SLGNRs is reduced by ∼1.03% with an additional layer, which is higher than DLGNRs and also much higher than PEDOT alone with similar sheet resistance.47

In this study, we demonstrate a first systematic attempt to study the solution processed conventional tandem PSC (Fig. 4a) utilizing the Au-doped SLGNRs as an anode, combining a large bandgap two-dimensional small molecule (SMPV1, Fig. 4a)58 and a low bandgap polymer, poly{4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-2-ethylhexyl-4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate}, (PTTBDT-FTT, Fig. 4a).59 It is emphasized that a single junction solar cell (front cell) comprising of SMPV1 blended with PC71BM, provided an efficient single junction of 6.22 ± 0.02%. Moreover, the rear cell of PTTBDT-FTT with PC71BM provided a maximum single junction PCE of 6.29 ± 0.02%. SMPV1:PC71BM front cell gives high VOC = 0.88 ± 0.01 V in conventional configuration. The low bandgap rear cell with PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM was moderate, VOC = 0.74 ± 0.01 V. With optical bandgaps of 1.77 and 1.55 eV, the optical absorption of these two photoactive layers was complementary and covered a wide range of spectral response (Fig. 4b). We demonstrate that the conventional polymer tandem cell provided a PCE of 8.48 ± 0.01% with 6.22 ± 0.02% and 6.29 ± 0.02% efficiencies for the front and rear cells, respectively. Fig. 4c and d illustrate a schematic diagram that shows the fully processed conventional tandem PSC, and the proposed energy level diagram. The excitons were photoexcited in the front and rear cells with electrons injected into the ZnO and holes of the PEDOT:PSS. The front and rear cells were both electrically attached to the ZnO/PEDOT:PSS ICL that accepts electrons from the front cell, holes from the rear cell, and subsequently recombines them. The tandem solar cell architecture prohibited individual testing of its cells. Hence, corresponding single junction solar cells with photoactive layers from the same synthesis batch fabricated under identical film deposition conditions have been constructed as reference cells.

Electron and hole transport layers (E/HTL) tremendously affect the performance of a single junction solar cell. Optimizing the thickness of ETL, HTL as well as the active layer is beneficial to successfully prevent exciton quenching and the probability of losing charge at the anode and cathode sides. Thus, a series of single junction solar cells with different active layer thicknesses, and anode and cathode interfacial layers were prepared by applying the optimized processing conditions and the devices were characterized in detail in order to evaluate the performance of tandem cells.

Fig. 5a shows the mean for spectral average IQEs of two dimensional small molecule solar cells (glass/Au-doped SLGNRs/PEDOT:PSS/WO3/SMPV1:PC71BM/ZnO/Al) that was about 70% with a standard deviation of approximately 2%. Then, the photovoltaic performance of single junction SMPV1:PC71BM solar cells with a variety of SMPV1:PC71BM thicknesses was evaluated. As being anticipated in conventional device architecture, a device performance basically relies on the thickness of the photoactive layer. In these optimization experiments, it is worth noting that WO3 could function as a p-doped hole injection layer as well as a contact interface layer.

Fig. 5b depicts the typical J–V characteristics of the single junction with numerous HTLs as well as different active layer thicknesses ranging from 60 nm to 120 nm under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination. Despite the varying thicknesses of the active layers, the VOC of all cells was 0.88 ± 0.01 V (Table 1). It is worth noting that the VOC values were less than the previously reported value58 probably due to unstable SLGNR networks. This is predictable since the VOC value relies largely on the energy level of the active layer. Unlike VOC, the JSC of the cell varies significantly according to the thickness of the SMPV1:PC71BM layer. One can see that the JSC showed an oscillatory behaviour because JSC usually relies on the amount of photon absorbed into the SMPV1:PC71BM layer. Yet, at 120 nm, photocurrent was significantly less compared to that of 80 nm. There are a few factors that must be taken into account for efficient exciton dissociation at the active layer, namely the conjugation length of the polymers, interfacial dipoles and field dependence. One of the most popular models that are being used to estimate the exciton dissociation rate was the Onsager–Braun model, although it gives a weak dependency of the dissociation efficiency on the electric field.60 Generally, the electric field determines the efficient exciton dissociation process. So, low JSC in the SMPV1:PC71BM indicated that the electric field decreases with the increment of SMPV1:PC71BM thickness at a constant bias voltage, and consequently the dissociation rate becomes smaller at the low electric field. The increase of charge carrier recombination by space char effects, low charge carrier mobility, and increased Rs of the device could possibly be the reasons to the decrease of JSC in thicker SMPV1:PC71BM. A thicker SMPV1:PC71BM offers a long optical path length for charge collection. However, it maximized charge carrier recombination. Besides, there was no increase of charges during short-circuit conditions, and the drift of charges decreased in speed due to the smaller electric field in the thicker cell, which has led to the increase of recombination of the separated charges. As a result, the obtained lower JSC in 120 nm thick single junction solar cell resulted from an increased charge recombination. In the meantime, the FF decreased with the increase of the SMPV1:PC71BM layer. The electric field was even smaller at the maximum power point, and there was a lower dissociation rate and a higher recombination rate if compared during the short circuit conditions.61 The electric field in thicker cells become smaller due to the distance between the electrodes. Consequently, a low FF was produced due to the recombination of charge carriers at the maximum power point which was significant in thicker devices. In addition, the thicker SMPV1:PC71BM also resulted in the decrement of the ideality factor. This was consistent with the decrement of diffusion and recombination currents, as well as the Rs deduction. It can be related to the decrement of trap-assisted recombination, where the photogenerated electron and holes turned out to be effectively separated and transported in the space charge region.

Fig. 5c and d demonstrate the measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the absorption spectra of single junction solar cells, respectively. The EQE highest peak was approximately 62%, and the average absorption in the visible region was about 55%. It is also worth mentioning that the integrated EQEs for 60, 80, 100, and 120 nm devices were 9.83, 10.21, 9.02, and 7.01 mA cm−2. These values were in agreement with the obtained JSC values from J–V characteristics as shown in Table 1.
Secondly, additional work was carried out to establish the best single junction photovoltaic performance based on Glass/Au-doped SLGNR/PEDOT:PSS/PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM/Ca/Al, where Ca was employed as an electron transport layer (ETL). The similar action can be seen as stated earlier and a great dependency of photovoltaic performance was seen in diverse active layer thicknesses and ETLs.

Fig. 6a shows the IQE plots with different active layer thicknesses (ranging from 80 to 140 nm). The mean spectrally averaged IQE was 76% for PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM with a standard deviation of 3%. The highest IQE extended to nearly 80% for 100 nm thickness, and the increase of photoactive layer thickness has led to a small decrease of the IQE value. The charge recombination loss also increased with the expansion in the photoactive layer thickness. Therefore, this method did not account for a high performance solar cell.

Fig. 6b demonstrates the J–V characteristics of the single junction solar cells with various PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM layer thicknesses under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination. According to Table 2, the JSC of the single junction solar cells increased by enhancing PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM thickness, in which it increased from 11.98 ± 0.02 mA cm−2 for the 80 nm thick BHJ layer to 12.75 ± 0.01 mA cm−2 for the 100 nm thick BHJ layer. The increased in light absorption and exciton generation influenced the increment of JSC. Consequently, the expanding thickness of the BHJ layer influenced the increment of FF that was from 61.69 ± 0.02% for the 80 nm thick BHJ layer to 66.61 ± 0.02% for the 100 nm thick heterojunction layer. In contrast, the VOC of the PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM was 0.74 ± 0.01 V and it was not influenced by the thickness of the PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM BHJ layer. When the thickness of the PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM BHJ layer increased, the PCE of the PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM BHJ cell decreased from 6.29 ± 0.02% for the 100 nm thick BHJ layer to 4.84 ± 0.04% for the 140 nm thick heterojunction layer. As for this matter, the JSC and FF declined to 11.43 ± 0.02 mA cm−2 and 57.28 ± 0.03%, individually.

Fig. 6c and d show the EQE and the absorption plots of a single junction, respectively. The PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM cells had a great EQE response in the infrared region with a maximum response of 750 nm with an absorption up to 800 nm. Moreover, the increment in the PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM BHJ layer's thickness influenced the enhancement of the photoresponse in the infrared region. The photoresponse spectra of the BHJ cells were accordant to the optical absorbance spectra for the PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM mixed film. The highest value of EQE reached 62% at 740 nm wavelength in the single junction solar cells with the 100 nm thick PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM BHJ layer, and the average was ∼55%. The integrated EQEs for 80, 100, 120, and 140 nm devices were 11.21, 12.11, 11.84, and 10.87 mA cm−2. The obtained JSC values from J–V curves are consistent with these integrated values. The absorption in the infrared region was 35% as illustrated in Fig. 6d. Whilst, the average absorption was as high as 60% in the visible region. Thus, intensifying visible absorption, as well as conserving highly efficient charge transport and collection, are crucial.
Noticeable and vital correlations between charge recombination, ETL, HTL, and the film thicknesses were seen based on our observations from these two different independent evaluation experiments. We concluded that 80 nm of SMPV1:PC71BM and 100 nm of PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM were both ideal BHJ thicknesses as they balanced absorption, charge collecting, and charge transporting.
The device performance of a fully solution processed conventional tandem cell solution (Fig. 7, Table 3) shows that the VOC of the tandem cell was 0.06 V which was lower than the summation of the VOC of the front and rear cells. Fig. 7a shows that polymer tandem solar cells on both glass/Au-doped SLGNRs and ITO had nearly identical behaviours (not shown). This is anticipated due to the use of WO3 contact interfacial layers in both devices. The average performance of the fabricated cell on glass/Au-doped SLGNRs had VOC = 1.56 ± 0.01 V, JSC = 8.45 ± 0.02 mA cm−2, FF = 64.32 ± 0.02%, and PCE = 8.48 ± 0.01%. While, the cell fabricated on ITO/Au-doped SLGNRs had VOC = 1.56 ± 0.01 V, JSC = 8.63 ± 0.02 mA cm−2, FF = 66.11 ± 0.2%, and PCE = 8.90 ± 0.03%. The front cell demonstrated VOC = 0.88 ± 0.01 V, JSC = 10.75 ± 0.02 mA cm−2, FF = 65.77 ± 0.04%, and PCE = 6.22 ± 0.02%. The rear cell exhibited VOC = 0.74 ± 0.01 V, JSC = 12.75 ± 0.01 mA cm−2, FF = 66.61 ± 0.02%, and PCE = 6.29 ± 0.02%. It was found that ZnO/PEDOT:PSS ICL is an excellent junction for both electrons and holes as the FF of the tandem cell was 64.32%. It indicates that the photogeneration in the tandem cells is somewhat field-independent. The current matching in the tandem cells resulted in the redistribution of the built-in electric field in the cells which produced the high FF. Even though the FF was high, the JSC of the tandem cell was less than both the front and rear cells. This is due to the fact that there was only minor overlap in absorption of the SMPV1:PC71BM and PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM films in the visible region and the optical field redistribution when the front and rear cells were stacked in tandem architecture.

The EQE curves of each cell within the tandem cell of the corresponding photoactive layers in the device stacks are illustrated in Fig. 7b. Note that, due to a couple light absorption and current-generation processes in the front and rear cells, the EQE measurements of the tandem solar cell structures always require extra awareness.62 The measurements of EQE were carried out with two excitation light sources in which a 700 nm light optical bias light beam was used to excite only one of the cells whereas a 550 nm light was used to measure the EQE of the other cell. The EQE spectra demonstrated a comprehensive match in currents that were generated in each cell as shown in Fig. 7b. It could be validated that the current was supplied from the active layers due to the fact that the EQE spectra very much follow the absorptance spectra of the front and rear cells greatly. An outstanding charge injection from Au-doped SLGNRs to the active layers was seen from a relatively constant EQE up to 700 nm. According to Fig. 7b, it is proven that the EQE of the tandem cell prepared on glass/Au-doped SLGNRs was less than the one fabricated on ITO/Au-doped SLGNRs.

Fig. 7c depicts PCE as a function of storage time in air of the tandem cell without encapsulation. The prepared tandem cell consists of a glass/SLGNRs/PEDOT:PSS/WO3/SMPV1:PC71BM/ZnO/PEDOT:PSS/PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM/Ca/Al structure. It is worth to note that the efficiency of our tandem cell dropped by 19.26% from its initial value after 840 h storage in the air. Although we have seen only 20% deterioration of its efficiency, the real degradation mechanism in solar cells remained ambiguous especially in the case of no encapsulation. Therefore, comprehensive studies on the degradation mechanism in PSCs are needed in order to comprehend the phenomenon and continue to increase the stability. It is also worth noting that we are currently thoroughly investigating the device performance (the single and tandem structure of both PSC and organic light emitting diodes) employing low work function metal with and without encapsulation, and will be reported elsewhere.
Throughout this study, 37 tandem cells were prepared, with the average device efficiency demonstrating 8.48%. More than 29 tandem cells show efficiencies greater than 8.2%.
Moreover, another vital issue in high performance tandem cells is current matching. The current in tandem cells is restrained by the current of the front cells, therefore, it is rather important to optimize the thickness of the front and rear cells for balance optical absorptions. Even though low carrier mobilities and unbalanced electron–hole mobilities in organic solar cells63–65 are characteristics of organic solar cells that will make it complicated to match the current densities between the front and rear cells, but still the number of absorbed photons, charge carrier transport, and bimolecular recombination64 in tandem cells connected with the series must be fully optimized in order to have a current matching condition.
The amount of light that will be absorbed through changes in optical field distribution within the cells depends on the layer thickness of the tandem solar cells. The optical field distribution inside the cells can be controlled through various methods such as by varying layer thickness,66 introducing an optical spacer,67 and using a highly refractive electrode.68
Here, a series of tandem cells were properly fabricated in order to investigate the effect of front cell thickness on the performance of the devices. Thus, the SMPV1:PC71BM layer thickness was varied between 90 and 130 nm. In order to match the current between the front and rear cells and keep sufficient absorption and photocurrent in the rear cell, we have fixed our rear cell, PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM thickness at 100 nm. Fig. 8 exhibits resultant J–V characteristics of three different sets of tandem cells with different SMPV1:PC71BM thicknesses. Table 4 tabulates the photovoltaic parameters obtained from Fig. 8 and we found that these three tandem cells provided identical VOC of 1.56 ± V. As we know the ideal tandem has got 80 nm and 100 nm for the front and rear cells but one could see that variation of SMPV1:PC71BM layer thickness has strongly influenced both JSC and FF values of all the tandem cells. As we enhanced the front cell thickness from 80 to 90 nm, the tandem cell maintained its performance, although there was a small drop in JSC. The JSC decreased from 8.45 ± 0.02 mA cm−2 to 8.30 ± 0.03 mA cm−2 together with a decrease in FF from 64.32 ± 0.02% to 62.28 ± 0.02%. This was due to the increase in Rs, value in which the Rs increased from 12.3 Ω cm2 to 15.6 Ω cm2. A drastic change in JSC was seen when one increased the thickness of SMPV1:PC71BM from 90 nm to 110 nm, where the JSC plummeted from 8.30 ± 0.03 mA cm−2 to 7.50 ± 0.03 mA cm−2. At the same time, the FF dropped to 60.48 ± 0.02% from 62.28 ± 0.02%, leading to 7.08 ± 0.03% PCE.

The thickest cell of SMPV1:PC71BM having 130 nm produced a bad tandem cell, in which the JSC reduced to its lowest value of 6.40 ± 0.01 mA cm−2 while the FF value increased to 66.70 ± 0.04%. The overall PCE was 6.66 ± 0.05% for a 130 nm thick layer of SMPV1:PC71BM cell. As stated above, the lower dissociation rate of excitons was the cause for the fall of the JSC value in the thinner rear cell, whereas the slow drifting of charges which leads to recombination of separated charges has led to the fall in the thicker rear cell.
Over years, various ideas and new concepts of ICL have been discovered.69–77 So, in order to look for a new and compatible ICL, we affirm that the ICL not only functions as the charge recombination electrode between cells, but also it guarantees the occurrence of suitable interface energy to efficiently recombine the charges between the front and rear cells. Additionally, it prevents any generation of a reverse built-in potential that could potentially reduce the VOC of the tandem cell. Hence, in order to avoid any absorption and reflection when projected light passes through the front cell into the rear cell, ICL must be optically transparent. Our comprehensive study on the tandem cell was extended by proposing three different sets of ICLs namely (i) Li-doped zinc oxide (LZO)/PEDOT:PSS, (ii) zinc oxide (ZnO)/graphene oxide (GO), and (iii) titanium oxide (TiOx)/GO. Fig. 9 demonstrates the J–V characteristics of tandem cells under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination with three sets of ICLs. Table 5 collects the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding tandem cells. As illustrated in Fig. 9, the cell's performance changed prominently with various ICLs. It indicated that the ICL played an important role in the charge recombination process. These observations have indicated that tandem cells with ICLs of LZO/PEDOT:PSS, ZnO/GO, and TiOx/GO had lesser values of VOC which were 1.38 ± 0.01 V, 1.46 ± 0.01 V, and 0.94 ± 0.01 V. These values of VOC were lower compared to that of ZnO/PEDOT:PSS ICL. The low VOC values obtained in these three different ICLs could be attributed to the energy barrier, leading to an expansive voltage drop in the ICLs. Moreover, larger internal resistance, inefficient charge extraction, and recombination of the ICLs are the causes for the low FFs. In order to ensure the robustness of our proposed ICLs, the solvent resistance study on ZnO/PEDOT:PSS ICL has been conducted by using various solvents and the ZnO/PEDOT:PSS demonstrated good chemical resistance to chlorobenze, 1,2-dicholorobenzene, and 1,3,5-tricholorobenzene. It shows that ZnO/PEDOT:PSS ICL is an ICL that could prevent any solvent penetration upon the deposition of the rear cell as it can be regarded as an excellent and robust ICL.

Conclusion
The ITO-free tandem PSC realizing the Au-doped SLGNRs have successfully demonstrated as a potential candidate to replace ITO-based device and achieved the highest record performance among all ITO-free PSCs. The Au-doped SLGNRs tandem PSC matched the highly efficient commercially available photovoltaic technologies. The Au-doped SLGNRs tandem PSC has the potential to exhibit even higher efficiency with the continuous optimization of device parameters and optical structures. Our ITO-free tandem cell exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 8.48% and it was discovered to be equal to a tandem cell constructed by using commercially available indium tin oxide. This study has also generated a new path in searching for a potential replacement to the frequently used transparent conducting electrode apart from providing a potential solution for high performance, low cost, flexible display of the photovoltaic technologies.
Single layer graphene nanoribbons
The SLGNR sample preparation started with the growth of a large-sized monolayer graphene film on a copper foil using CVD in a tubular quartz furnace.23 A copper foil was placed at the centre of the quartz tube, and the system was flushed with a constant flow of hydrogen (50 sccm) at 760 mTorr for 50 min. The Cu foil was annealed at 1000 °C for 40 min to remove organic matter and oxides from the surface. A gas mixture of methane and hydrogen (CH4 = 60 sccm and H2 = 15 sccm at 750 mTorr) was introduced into the system at 1000 °C for the growth of the graphene layer. After the graphene films were grown, the graphene and Cu foil were cooled to 25 °C. The as-grown graphene was transferred from the Cu foil to a thermally grown SiO2 (300 nm thick) substrate atop a heavily p-doped Si substrate (SiO2/Si) using the following transfer procedure: (i) a poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film was spin-coated onto the surface of the graphene on the Cu foil; (ii) the PMMA/graphene layer was separated from the Cu foil by chemical etching of the Cu in an iron chloride solution; (iii) the suspended PMMA–graphene layer was placed on the surface of deionized water overnight to remove any residual Cu etchant; (iv) the PMMA/graphene layer was then transferred to the SiO2/Si substrate; (v) after drying on a hotplate at 120 °C, the PMMA was dissolved and washed away by soaking the substrate in acetone to leave only the monolayer graphene film on the SiO2/Si substrate; (vi) finally, the sample was rinsed with isopropyl alcohol and deionized water to obtain graphene/SiO2/Si. The SLGNRs were prepared by EBL patterning followed by O2 NBE under the following conditions: a chamber pressure of 0.7 mTorr, an RF power of 250 W, an O2 flow rate of 6.7 sccm, and an irradiation time of 3.5 min. A negative-tone resist, hydrogen silsesquioxae (HSQ), with a thickness of around 150 nm was spin-coated onto the graphene/SiO2/Si samples. Following the patterning and subsequent development of the etching mask pattern, the unmasked graphene area was etched by O2 NBE. After removing the HSQ by using diluted hydrofluoric acid, we obtained SLGNRs on the SiO2/Si substrate.
Au-doped single layer graphene nanoribbons
SLGNRs (100 mg) were dispersed in water (10 mL) containing gold(III) chloride (AuCl3). The suspension was consequently dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 48 hours to yield the AuCl3 doped-SLGNRs powders. The thermal exfoliation of the dry precursor was carried out at 1000 °C for 12 minutes, by placing the precursor inside a porous quartz glass capsule connected to a magnetic manipulator in a vacuum tight quartz reactor with controlled atmosphere. This system provided a temperature gradient of over 1000 °C min−1. The sample was then flushed repeatedly with pure nitrogen and subsequently inserted into a pre-heated reactor in nitrogen (99.9999% purity) or hydrogen (99.9999% purity) atmosphere (pressure: 1 atm) to give the Au doped-SLGNRs hybrid material. The flow of the gases was 1000 mL min−1, resulting in the removal of the by-products of the reactions.
Transistor fabrication
Devices were fabricated on 300 nm SiO2/Si substrates. The SLGNR suspension was spin coated onto the substrates and calcined at 375 °C for 20 min. Electron beam lithography was performed using 2% PMMA in anisole spun on at 3000 rpm as the resist layer. 18 nm/4 nm Pd/Au electrodes were deposited via e-beam deposition to form a source and drain contact after lift-off. In order to improve the contact resistance, the devices were annealed in Ar at 200 °C. The transistors were then electrically annealed in a vacuum probe station at 10−6 Torr to remove adsorbates until the Dirac points of the current vs. gate voltage curves appeared near 0 V grate voltage.
Single junction fabrication (front cell)
After doping the graphene nanoribbons samples were coated with 20 nm poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), followed by a 120 °C bake on a hot plate for 20 minutes before organic material deposition. The glass substrate was first cleaned by a detergent and solvent, followed by a 10 minute exposure to UV/ozone treatment before the organic material deposition. The substrates are then loaded into a vacuum chamber with the base pressure of 1 × 10−7 Torr for film deposition by thermal evaporation. The film deposition for a front cell single-layer device included a 4 nm WO3 anode interfacial layer. After baking at 120 °C for 15 minutes, the active layer was spin-coated from a different blend ratio (weight-to-weight, w:w) of a conjugated small molecule (14 mg mL−1) and PC71BM in chloroform solution on the glass/PEDOT:PSS/WO3 substrate. As for the active layer fabricated with the PDMS additive, PDMS with desired amounts was added in the SMPV1:PC71BM blend solution and stirred for 1 hour before spin-coating. The active layer thickness was measured as ∼80 nm using a Dektak profilometer. Finally, a 20 nm of ZnO was spin-coated on the substrate at a spin-speed of 1000 rpm followed by heat treatment at 130 °C for 20 minutes. A 100 nm Al layer was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask. The active area was 0.1 cm2.
Single junction fabrication (rear cell)
A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP Al 4083, filtered at 0.2 mm) was spin-coated onto (glass/Au-doped SLGNR surface at 4000 rpm, ca. 40 nm). After being annealed at 120 °C for 15 minutes, the low bandgap polymer was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 30 seconds. The polymer solution was prepared by dissolving the polymer (10 mg mL−1) in a 97% chlorobenzene/3% DIO mixture. Ca and Al contact were thermally deposited by vacuum deposition at a pressure below 1 × 10−7 Torr, and the device area is 0.1 cm2.
Tandem device fabrication
The front and rear cells were produced according to the single junction procedure. Samples were transferred into the glove-box for PEDOT:PSS layer deposition; the thickness of PEDOT:PSS is 40 nm. Then the rear cell was fabricated as the front cell; the thickness of the active layer was controlled by the spin coating speed. Finally, the samples were transferred into the evaporation chamber to fabricate the Ca (5 nm)/Al (100 nm) electrode; the device area was 0.1 cm2.
Device characterization
As for tandem solar cells, the layers that comprised of PEDOT:PSS/WO3/SMPV1:PC71BM/ZnO/PEDOT:PSS/PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM were electrically isolated using toluene and methanol along the perimeter defined by the area of the top electrode. This isolation avoids fringing effects and also prevents over estimation of the photocurrents generated by the tandem cell. During the measurement and stability tests, a shadow mask (0.1 cm2) with a single aperture was placed onto the tandem solar cells in order to define its photoactive area. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2410 source unit. The EQE measurements were performed using an EQE system (Model 74000) obtained from Newport Oriel Instruments USA and a HAMAMATSU calibrated silicon cell photodiode used as a reference diode. The wavelength was controlled using a monochromator 200–1600 nm.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells have been the center of attraction since the last few decades as they offer numerous advantages including lightweight, low-cost fabrication, non-toxicity, mechanical flexibility and easy fabrication. However, as our indium price has risen up rapidly, there is a clear and urgent need for potential replacement of our commonly used transparent conducting electrode, indium tin oxide (ITO). Hence, in this study, we fabricated ITO-free tandem polymer solar cells utilizing Au-doped single layer graphene nanoribbons as the transparent electrode and hopefully we are able to convince researchers in this theme that there is a life after indium.
