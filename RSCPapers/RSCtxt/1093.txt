    , Accepted 7th October 2022First published on 11th October 2022AbstractA novel [uniaxial needle]//[coaxial needle]//[uniaxial needle] parallel spinneret is first innovatively designed and manufactured by inserting a coaxial needle into the middle of a bi-axial parallel needle, and the corresponding spinning device is established. With the aid of the distinctive-structured spinneret and the spinning device, a novel and brand-new flexible one-dimensional nanobelt//coaxial nanobelt//nanobelt tri-strand parallel nanobelt, very much like a tricolor flag and named a pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt, is successfully prepared by electrospinning technology for the first time. Microscopically, partition of four independent domains in the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt is realized, and such a partitioned structure can assemble various functions and helps reduce detrimental interactions among various functions to acquire excellent poly-functions of multifunctional nanomaterials. As a case study, {anthracene/Eu(2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone)3(triphenylphosphine oxide)2 [Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2]/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)}//{[CoFe2O4/PMMA]@[polyaniline (PANI)/PMMA]}//{coumarin-6/PMMA} pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelts and arrays (abbreviated as [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA) are designed and constructed via electrospinning. Each pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt is composed of left and right sides of blue and red fluorescent [anthracene/Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2/PMMA] nanobelts and green fluorescent [coumarin-6/PMMA] nanobelts, respectively, and the middle of the [CoFe2O4/PMMA]@[PANI/PMMA] coaxial nanobelt with magnetic-conductive bifunctionality using the CoFe2O4/PMMA nanobelt as the core and PANI/PMMA as the shell. Luminescence-magnetic-conductive polyfunctionalities are highly integrated but also mutually separated in the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt, and thus, both segregation and integration of the functions are actualized in the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt. A pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt as the building unit ensures strong fluorescence and high conductive anisotropy of the array. Moreover, energy transfer between dyes is controlled by the special structure of the nanobelt and thus white light emission is realized by the combination of europium complexes with the dyes. The conductive anisotropy and magnetism of the array are tuned by changing the content of PANI and CoFe2O4, respectively. The formation mechanism of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt is proposed, and new techniques for constructing nanobelts and arrays are established. This kind of pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt with four functional subareas possesses important implications as a building unit to construct other polyfunctional nanostructures. More importantly, the design philosophy and the construction techniques for the novel pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt and array afford some guidance for the development of other multifunctional materials.
Introduction
At present, anisotropic conductive films (ACFs) have been widely used by researchers because of their many practical advantages, such as flexibility, reliability, simplicity and environmental friendliness.1–3 Type I ACFs have been widely used in the electronic industry, which conduct electricity unidirectionally along the Z-axis and insulate along the X–Y plane.4 Type II ACFs have the characteristics of different conductivities in two perpendicular directions along the X–Y plane, which are still in the laboratory research stage.5 With the continuous development of ACFs, type III ACFs are further developed to possess a left-to-right structure achieving double anisotropic conductance.6 To meet the needs of rapid development of electronics and nanotechnology, researchers are working on new types of ACFs to achieve the specific direction conductivity of the film surface and versatility. Li et al.7 prepared highly anisotropic conductive composite materials. The conductivity in the parallel direction was 10 S m−1, which was 7–8 orders of magnitude higher than that in the perpendicular direction. Qian et al.8 synthesized an anisotropic conductive hydrogel with bacterial cellulose (BC) as a template, and the hydrogel had a high water content and a high conductivity of 0.24 S cm−1. Due to the anisotropic structure of BC, the hydrogel possessed anisotropic conductivity. The conductivity in the direction parallel to the cellulose nanofiber layer is about 4.1 times higher than that in the perpendicular direction. Qi et al.9 constructed a Yin-Yang Fish structure film with dual-anisotropic conductivity and up-/down-conversion fluorescence properties. The conductance of the composite film is up to 10−2 S, and the conductance ratio of the conductive direction to the insulative direction reaches 108.
White light emitting materials have been widely studied because of their important applications in the fields of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), display backlights and sensors. However, it still remains a great challenge to obtain high quality white light emission from a single-host phosphor. The white light emission spectrum should be wide enough to cover the entire visible light range. One of the main methods to realize white light emission is by using a donor–acceptor (D–A) system which consists of red, green and blue primary colors or orange and blue two complementary colors. In most D–A systems, the excitation energy is transferred from high-energy molecules to low-energy molecules to achieve white light emission.10 However, if the distance between molecules is too close, it is difficult to obtain broadband emission in the visible range due to the strong energy transfer (ET) between the donor and the acceptor.11,12 Therefore, it is very important to design a microstructure to adjust ET. The separation of fluorescent substances in space can provide appropriate isolated areas to effectively suppress ET and better realize white light emission. Qin et al. prepared a flexible white light-emitting film by combining the blue fluorescent organic dye and a specifically designed orange fluorescent dye.13 Han et al. constructed a white luminescent film by using three luminescent organic dyes. The obtained flexible composite film exhibits uniform white light emission.14
With the rapid development of science and technology, single functional materials cannot meet the actual needs. It is of great significance to combine two or more kinds of materials with various functions so that different functions can form complementarity. Thus, a new type of composite material with multi-functions is achieved.15–17 Due to different variety and unique properties, poly-functional nanocomposites have attracted extensive attention from researchers.18 Fluorescent-conductive-magnetic multi-functional materials have been widely used in bone tissue engineering,19 electromagnetic shielding,20 medical diagnosis,21 electronic packaging,22 light-emitting devices,23 sensors24 and microwave absorption.25 Li et al.19 prepared PEDOT/Fe3O4/PLGA conductive-magnetic bi-functional fibrous scaffolds. The double stimulation of electricity and magnetism is very beneficial to the construction of bone tissue in vitro or in vivo and can promote the growth of bone cells. Wang et al.23 prepared a bifunctional luminescent thermometer by combining lanthanide(III) elements with a single molecule magnet. The prepared material simultaneously possesses magnetism and visible near-infrared luminescence. He et al.26 prepared a composite film with both conductive and fluorescence performances as a temperature probe. Polyaniline (PANI) is a widely studied conductive polymer and has been widely used in flexible electronics, solar cells, electromagnetic shielding and supercapacitors owing to its excellent conductivity and easy synthesis. Chen et al. have prepared a multifunctional conductive hydrogel by in situ polymerization of ANI to form PANI in the hydrogen-bonded PSS network. It has the merits of high conductivity, stretchability and rapid self-healing ability.27 In recent years, magnetic nanomaterials have been widely used in magnetic storage materials, biosensors and microwave absorption materials. CoFe2O4, as a typical magnetic spinel ferrite, has been increasingly used in various fields because of its good chemical and physical stability, strong saturation magnetization and corrosion resistance.28–30 As important fluorescent materials, organic dyes such as blue fluorescent anthracene and green fluorescent coumarin-6 have been widely used as optical brighteners and organic fluorescent sources, and in the fields of fluorescence analysis and medical fluorescence tracing. Rare earth complexes such as red fluorescent europium compounds have the advantages of a narrow spectral line, high color purity and high luminescence efficiency, which make them widely applied in biomedicine, luminescence and other fields.
Electrospinning is one of the most commonly used methods to prepare nanofibers and nanobelts because of its simple equipment, low cost, convenient operation and controllable process.31–34 In order to prepare light-emitting fibers by electrospinning, fluorescent materials need to be doped into a polymer matrix. However, if the fluorescent materials are too closely connected, they will interact with each other, so ET between the two fluorescent materials will occur.35 Previous studies36–42 have demonstrated that when dark-colored conductive and magnetic materials are straightly in contact with fluorescent materials, the fluorescence intensity of fluorescent materials will be significantly reduced. For one thing, the dark-colored conductive and magnetic materials can absorb visible light (400–700 nm) and much more easily absorb ultraviolet light (<400 nm). For another, heavy metal compounds, such as Fe, Co and Ni compounds, can cause fluorescence quenching of rare earth luminescent compounds, resulting in a decrease in luminescence intensity. In addition, due to the doping of non-conductive fluorescent and magnetic materials into the composites, the conductance of the composite film is reduced. When non-conductive materials (fluorescent substances and CoFe2O4) are blended with PANI, contacts among PANI macromolecular chains will be affected. Thus, the existence of non-conductive materials will hinder the formation of a continuous conductive network of PANI, resulting in weak conductivity of the composite film. Therefore, it is necessary to design a unique partitioned structure, which can limit different functional substances in their own regions, so as to achieve effective separation and avoid adverse effects among them. According to the references reported,43,44 the already-prepared electrospun Janus nanobelts prepared by using a bi-axial parallel spinneret are made up of two nanobelts parallelly bound together side by side, mainly possess a [nanobelt]//[nanobelt] structure, and each strip of nanobelt has a different functionality. Partition of two independent domains is realized in the Janus nanobelts.45,46 Janus materials are a class of new-type materials possessing different properties on each side. The special Janus structure is used to separate different substances with different properties, so as to reduce the adverse interactions among them and obtain excellent multifunctions. Therefore, the division of two functional domains can be realized at the micro level. Furthermore, the electrospun already-existing coaxial nanobelts fabricated by applying a coaxial spinneret are composed of two nanobelts, in which one nanobelt is placed over another nanobelt to form a [nanobelt]@[nanobelt] core–shell structure, and each strip of nanobelt has a different functionality. Partition of two independent domains is also realized in the coaxial nanobelt.47,48
Enlightened by these special one-dimensional structures, in this work, a peculiar [uniaxial needle]//[coaxial needle]//[uniaxial needle] parallel spinneret is designed and manufactured, and then the spinning device is established. On the basis of the already-reported bi-axial parallel needle and the coaxial needle, in this work, a coaxial needle is inserted into the middle of a bi-axial parallel needle to obtain a peculiar [uniaxial needle]//[coaxial needle]//[uniaxial needle] parallel spinneret. Afterwards, a novel and brand-new flexible one-dimensional nanobelt is successfully prepared by using the peculiar spinneret and spinning device. The prepared nanobelt includes a nanobelt, a coaxial nanobelt and another nanobelt bonded together side-by-side to form a nanobelt//coaxial nanobelt//nanobelt tri-strand parallel nanobelt. Furthermore, it is very much like the tricolor flag and thus named a pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt. To our knowledge, this is the first time to construct this new type of pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt. As a case study, we use blue fluorescent dye anthracene, green fluorescent dye coumarin-6 and red fluorescent Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2 as fluorescent materials, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) as magnetic substances, conductive PANI as a conductive substance, and PMMA as a template and a matrix to construct the [anthracene/Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2/PMMA]//[(CoFe2O4/PMMA)@(PANI/PMMA)]//[coumarin-6/PMMA] pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt. Microscopically, partition of four independent domains in the particular-structured nanobelt is realized, and such a partitioned structure helps reduce the detrimental interactions among various functions to acquire excellent poly-functions of the nanomaterials. This partitioned structure is also expected to confine different fluorescent substances in their own regions, so as to effectively adjust ET and achieve better white light emission by the combination of europium complexes with dyes. Next, a pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt is utilized as a building unit to fabricate the [anthracene/Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2/PMMA]//[(CoFe2O4/PMMA)@(PANI/PMMA)]//[coumarin-6/PMMA] pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt array (abbreviated as [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA) via the established spinning apparatus by applying a rotary drum as a collector. The conductive polymer has a continuous conductive network in the length direction of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt, resulting in strong conduction in the length direction, but two insulative regions are introduced in the width direction of this nanobelt, leading to strong insulation in this width direction and thus leading to high conductive anisotropy of the array. Magnetism and fluorescence can also be assembled into the array to achieve excellent luminescent-conductive-magnetic versatilities. In addition, five contrast samples are also prepared to demonstrate the structural superiorities of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt in the construction of multifunctional materials.

Fabrication and formative mechanism of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA and contrast samples by electrospinning

Fig. 1 exhibits the preparation process of the distinctive [uniaxial needle]//[coaxial needle]//[uniaxial needle] parallel spinneret, which consists of four different truncated stainless-steel needles (16#, 12#, 12# and 8#). First, two 12# stainless steel needles were cut into 2.5 cm in length and then bent to 145°. Then the two bent 12# needles and a 16# needle were fixed together side-by-side with copper wire. They were further fixed with glue to ensure that the three needles were parallelly arranged and the bottoms of the three needles were in the same plane. Afterwards, the 8# needle was inserted into the middle 16# needle to form a coaxial needle. Finally, a yellow plastic nozzle was sheathed at the bottoms of the three needles, and thus a [uniaxial needle]//[coaxial needle]//[uniaxial needle] parallel spinneret was successfully fabricated.

The abbreviations of the target sample and the five contrast samples are listed in Table 1. The detailed preparation process of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA is shown in Fig. 2a. First, spinning liquids A, C and D were added into three 10 mL syringes connected to needles, respectively. At the same time, a 5 mL syringe containing spinning liquid B was inserted into the syringe containing spinning liquid A. During the experiment, the amount of each spinning liquid was 4 mL. The high direct current voltage of 8 kV was provided between the spinneret and a rotary drum by a high voltage power supply. The rotary drum was used as a collecting device, the rotation speed was set at 1200 rpm, and the distance between the spinneret and the rotary drum was about 13 cm. Because the rotary drum is used as the collecting device in the spinning process, the nanobelts are highly ordered in the same direction. After the spinning liquids were completely consumed, the array with a certain width and thickness was collected from the drum. To reveal the superior performances of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA, five contrast samples were also prepared. The detailed preparation processes of contrast samples are listed in the ESI,† and the diagrams for the spinning process of the contrast samples are shown in Table S3 (ESI†).

 Fig. 2  Schematic diagrams of (a) spinning device and preparation process for [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA and (b) formation mechanisms of pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelts and arrays. 
The formation mechanism of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt is presented in Fig. 2b. In the electrospinning process, the four spinning liquids were loaded into different syringes. The Taylor cone with a uniaxial//coaxial//uniaxial parallel structure was formed at the bottom of the spinneret tip and the uniaxial//coaxial//uniaxial parallel structure jet was ejected under the action of electric field force, and the positive charges were evenly distributed on the jet. The cross section of the jet was slightly deformed due to electrostatic repulsion. In this case, the positive charge was concentrated at the section with a larger radius of curvature, and bigger Coulomb repulsion was generated to stretch the jet into a strip-shaped structure. Thus, a pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt was prepared by volatilization of the solvent. In addition, due to the instability of the electrospinning process, the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt with a uniaxial//coaxial//uniaxial parallel structure swung and whipped in the air, and the array with a certain width could be collected on the surface of the drum.

Results and discussion
XRD and magnetism analysis
The prepared CoFe2O4 NPs and [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA are analyzed by XRD. As shown in Fig. 3, the diffraction peaks of CoFe2O4 NPs correspond to the standard card of cubic phase CoFe2O4 NPs (PDF#79-1744). No diffraction peaks of other impurities are detected, indicating that the pure-phase CoFe2O4 NPs are synthesized. The diffraction peaks of CoFe2O4 NPs are found in [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA, meaning that the composite array contains CoFe2O4 NPs. The wide diffraction peak of the array near 20° indicates that amorphous substances (PMMA, PANI and fluorescent substances) exist in [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of CoFe2O4 NPs with the PDF standard card of CoFe2O4 and [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA. 

Fig. 4 demonstrates the hysteresis loops of CoFe2O4 NPs and [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA with different contents of CoFe2O4 NPs. The saturation magnetization of CoFe2O4 NPs is 30.18 emu g−1, while [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA has relatively weak magnetism in comparison with the CoFe2O4 NPs, because [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA contains a lot of non-magnetic materials, resulting in reduced magnetism. It is universally known that the saturation magnetization of the composites is mainly related to the doping content of the magnetic materials.49 It can be seen from the figure that the saturation magnetization of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA increases with increasing CoFe2O4 NPs content in the [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA. When the ratio of CoFe2O4 NPs to PMMA increases from 0.3:1, 0.5:1 to 1:1, the saturation magnetization value of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA increases from 2.02 to 7.44 emu g−1. The magnetism of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA can be regulated by adjusting CoFe2O4 NPs content, implying that [B + R]/[M@C]/[G] PNA has adjustable magnetism.

Morphology and structure
As shown in Fig. 5, the morphology and structure of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA and contrast samples are analyzed in detail. Fig. 5a is the SEM image of the nanobelts in [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA. The surface of the nanobelts in the array is smooth and orderly arranged in a certain direction. This arrangement is the key factor to ensure high conductive anisotropy of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA. The width of the nanobelts is 7.21 ± 0.58 μm (Fig. 5b). Fig. 5c demonstrates the fluorescence microscopy (FM) photo of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt under 365 nm UV light excitation. The fluorescence regions on both sides display different fluorescence colors (reddish and green color) under the excitation of 365 nm ultraviolet light. To further clearly demonstrate the distinct structure of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt, the internal structure of a nanobelt is determined by EDS line-scan analysis. Elements Eu, S and Fe represent Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2, PANI and CoFe2O4, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 6, element Eu only distributes on the left side, element S and element Fe alternately appear in the middle subarea, conforming to the overall structure of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt and further element Fe appears between elements S, agreeing well with the structure of the (CoFe2O4/PMMA)@(PANI/PMMA) coaxial nanobelt. There is no element N in CoFe2O4, anthracene, Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2 and PMMA, and element N only exists in coumarin-6 and PANI. Distribution of N on the left side [containing anthracene/Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2/PMMA without element N] is less than those in middle subarea [containing (CoFe2O4/PMMA)@(PANI/PMMA)] and on the right side (containing coumarin-6/PMMA), also tallying with the overall structure of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt. Furthermore, the N content in PANI is higher than that in coumarin-6, so the distribution of element N in PANI locations is more than that on the right side. Also, element N distribution in the center (containing CoFe2O4/PMMA as the core, PANI/PMMA as the shell) of the middle subarea is less than those on the left and right sides of the middle subarea, according to the structure of the (CoFe2O4/PMMA)@(PANI/PMMA) coaxial nanobelt. From the above analytical results, we can safely conclude that the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt with four micro functional subareas has been successfully constructed. Four subareas are independent of each other and closely combined to form four micro functional subareas, which successfully realize to confine the different functional substances in their own subareas and thus reduce the harmful mutual interferences among them. For comparison, the SEM images of the [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN, [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNA, [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNN, [B + R + G + M + C] CNA and [B + R + G + M + C] CNN are also presented in Fig. 5d, e, f, g and h, respectively. The widths of the nanobelts of the contrast samples are similar, as demonstrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The nanobelts in [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNA and [B + R + G + M + C] CNA are orderly arranged. However, the nanobelts in [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN, [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNN and [B + R + G + M + C] CNN are disordered.

Mechanical property test
The mechanical properties of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA are tested, and the stress-strain curves of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA are demonstrated in Fig. 7. The stresses along the direction parallel to and perpendicular to the nanobelts arrangement are separately measured. The sample is cut into 1 cm × 3 cm, and the test is carried out at room temperature. It can be seen from the figure that the stress along the direction parallel to the nanobelt is 1.5 MPa, while the stress along the direction perpendicular to the nanobelt is 0.7 MPa, implying that [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA possesses mechanical anisotropy. The maximum strain refers to the ratio of the tensile length to the original length of the film when the film surface begins to break. The maximum strain of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA is about 200%, indicating that the film possesses excellent tensile properties.
 Fig. 7  Stress–strain curves of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA. 
Electrical conduction analysis
CSA with surface activation acting as the dopant was introduced into PANI, increasing solubility of PANI. In this acidic environment, the doped proton acid decomposes to produce H+ and anions, and H+ enters the main chain to generate bipolarons. Then, the bipolarons are transformed into polarons, and thus the conduction is realized by the movement of these polarons. Therefore, PANI doped with protonic acid possesses excellent conductivity.50,51
A series of samples were prepared to study the conductivity of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA and the contrast samples. For the convenience of discussion, the conductive direction (viz. parallel to the nanobelt arrangement) in the [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA is marked as the XC direction, and the insulative direction (i.e. perpendicular to the nanobelt arrangement) is denoted as the YI direction. To indicate the anisotropic conductive degree of the samples, the conductivity ratio of the conductive direction and the insulative direction is defined as XC/YI. The conductivity test process of the sample is shown in the ESI.† First, the effect of PANI content on the conductivity of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA is investigated. The contents of the fluorescent materials and magnetic materials remain unchanged, and the content of PANI increases from 30%, 50% to 70%. With increasing PANI content, polaron mobility increases, so the conductivity in the XC direction is significantly enhanced. For the YI direction, two insulating subareas in the width direction of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt can hinder polaron mobility, as a result, the YI direction is insulated. The conductivity values of all samples are listed in Table 2. The conductivity values in the XC direction increase from 1.88 × 10−4 S cm−1 to 2.52 S cm−1 with increasing PANI content from 30% to 70%. However, the conductivity of the insulative direction is almost unchanged, which is always 10−9 S cm−1. Therefore, the conductivity ratio of XC/YI increases significantly, meaning that the conductive anisotropy of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA increases and can be modulated. In particular, when the content of PANI is 70%, the conductivity in the XC direction is 8 orders of magnitude higher than that in the YI direction, and the conductive anisotropy is the strongest. Fig. S4 (ESI†) is the sketch map of conductive directions of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA with different PANI contents. It can be seen from Fig. S4 (ESI†) that the color of the array gradually deepens with increasing PANI contents, indicating that more PANI exists in the array. This results in a significant increase of the conductivity value in the conductive direction. The conductivity value of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA remains almost unchanged with the different contents of CoFe2O4 NPs. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) that CoFe2O4 NPs and PANI are dispersed in different areas, the change of CoFe2O4 NPs content will not affect the conduction of PANI, thus the conductivity value does not change significantly.

To show the superior performance of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA, the conductivities of the contrast samples are also investigated in detail. The sketch maps of conductive directions of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA and the contrast samples are presented in Fig. 8. It can be seen from Table 2 that [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN has no conductive anisotropy and [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN has conductivity in any direction because the nanobelts in [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN are randomly arranged. Therefore, the ratio of conductivity in any two perpendicular directions is close to one. For [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNA, PANI and CoFe2O4 NPs are blended together in the Janus nanobelt used as a building unit. The conductivity of [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNA is a little smaller than that of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA. Similarly, the [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNN has no conductive anisotropy because the Janus nanobelts in [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNN are disordered. For [B + R + G + M + C] CNA and [B + R + G + M + C] CNN, due to the fact that PANI is further mixed straightly with non-conductive fluorescent substances in the composite nanobelt as the building unit, the conductivity is further reduced. Furthermore, for the above same reasons, [B + R + G + M + C] CNA possesses weak conductive anisotropy and [B + R + G + M + C] CNN has no conductive anisotropy. The above analysis results indicate that the [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA with the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt as the building unit has the best conductive anisotropy.

Fluorescent performance
As fluorescent substances, anthracene, Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2 and coumarin-6 can emit blue, red and green fluorescence, respectively. Their molecular structures are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The energy transfer (ET) efficiency is closely related to the donor–acceptor system, especially the distance between the donor and the acceptor and the overlapping area of their excitation (EX) and emission (EM) spectra. To prove the ET relationship among anthracene, coumarin-6 and Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2, their EX and EM spectra are studied in detail. Fig. 9 demonstrates the EX and EM spectra of anthracene, coumarin-6 and Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2. Fig. 9a exhibits that merely a small overlap between the EM spectrum of anthracene and the EX spectrum of Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2 can be found, indicating that only extremely weak ET could occur between the anthracene and Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2. Most of the energy of anthracene will be transferred to coumarin-6, due to the large overlapping between the EM spectrum of anthracene and the EX spectrum of coumarin-6 (Fig. 9b), that is, obvious ET between them occurs. However, for Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2 and coumarin-6, no ET between them is found owing to no overlap between the EX spectrum of Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2 and the EM spectrum of coumarin-6 (Fig. 9c). To achieve better white light emission by using the three fluorescent substances, the anthracene and Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2 can be put in the same subarea due to almost no ET between them, coumarin-6 is placed in another segregative subarea, and it is better to place the two kinds of organic dyes in the two non-contact segregative subareas to totally inhibit the ET between them. Therefore, in order to better realize white light emission, it is necessary to design and fabricate reasonable construction units to adjust ET. In this work, the [uniaxial needle]//[coaxial needle]//[uniaxial needle] parallel spinneret is creatively designed to prepare the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt with four functional partitions achieved by parallel electrospinning technology. Thus, we expect that this unique structure can not only realize white light emission by regulating ET but also effectively limit conductive and magnetic substances in their own subareas, so as to effectively reduce their influence on fluorescent substances.

The pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt is rationally designed, fabricated and used as a building unit to prepare a series of samples to explore the effect of PANI and CoFe2O4 NPs on the fluorescence properties of samples. To explore the effect of PANI content on the fluorescence performance of the [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA, the content of CoFe2O4 NPs and fluorescent substances is kept unchanged, and the percent of PANI to PMMA is increased from 30%, 50% to 70%. When discussing the effect of CoFe2O4 NPs content on fluorescence properties, the content of PANI and fluorescent substances remains unchanged, and the mass ratio of CoFe2O4 NPs to PMMA increases from 0.3:1 to 1:1. Based on the literature,52,53 we adopt 365 nm as the EX wavelength, and the EM spectra of the samples are provided in Fig. 10. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 10a that the fluorescence intensity decreases significantly with increasing PANI content because PANI has strong absorption to ultraviolet and visible light.54 Similarly, the fluorescence intensity of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA also decreases with increasing CoFe2O4 content (Fig. 10b) due to the fact that CoFe2O4 also has strong absorption to ultraviolet and visible light.55 With increasing PANI contents, the color of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA is gradually more deepened due to the dark-green color of PANI, and more light can be absorbed, as a result, the fluorescence intensity decreases. The same is true with CoFe2O4. However, CoFe2O4 NPs are located in the core layer in the middle nanobelt of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt, the absorption of light is relatively weak, and thus the reduction in fluorescence intensity is relatively small.
 Fig. 10  EM spectra of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA doped with different contents of (a) PANI and (b) CoFe2O4 NPs. 
To reveal the advantageous performances of the prepared [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA, five contrast samples were also prepared and comparatively studied. As shown in Fig. 11, [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN has a weak fluorescence intensity in comparing the [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA. For the two samples, although they have the same building unit of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt, the nanobelts are randomly stacked in [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN and some gaps among adjacent nanobelts exist. As a result, part of the EX light will be absorbed when EX light reaches the lower nanobelts through the upper nanobelts. Similarly, the EM light from the lower layer will also be absorbed by the upper layer of the nanobelts when passing through the upper nanobelts, resulting in a certain degree of reduction of the luminescent intensity. In [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNA and [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNN, the green fluorescent dye (i.e. coumarin-6) is directly mixed with the blue fluorescent dye (i.e. anthracene) and the red fluorescent substance (viz. Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2) in the Janus nanobelt as the building unit. The distance between coumarin-6 and anthracene is very small, which will lead to ET between them, and anthracene will transfer energy to coumarin-6. Therefore, in comparing [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA with [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN, the intensity of blue light (403 nm and 426 nm) decreases and the intensity of green light (490 nm and 538 nm) increases in [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNA and [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNN. Moreover, the peak intensity of [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNA and [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNN at 538 nm is higher than that at 490 nm, while the peak intensity of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA and [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN at 490 nm is higher than that at 538 nm. The difference of relative intensity between 538 nm and 490 nm may result from the direct contact between coumarin-6 and the other two fluorescent substances. In particular, coumarin-6 in [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNA and [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNN is directly mixed with anthracene and Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2, while coumarin-6 in [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA and [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN are separated from anthracene and Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2. Similarly, the fluorescence intensity of [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNN is weaker than that of [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNA. As shown in Fig. 12, the three fluorescent substances are directly mixed with the deep-colored PANI and CoFe2O4 NPs in the composite nanobelt as the building unit for [B + R + G + M + C] CNA and [B + R + G + M + C] CNN. The EX light and EM light will be greatly absorbed due to the fact that PANI and CoFe2O4 NPs have strong absorption to light. Therefore, the fluorescence intensity of [B + R + G + M + C] CNA and [B + R + G + M + C] CNN decreases significantly, and [B + R + G + M + C] CNN possesses the weakest fluorescence intensity (Fig. 11a). It can be found from Fig. 11b that the CIE chromaticity coordinates of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA and [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNN are ascertained to be (0.28, 0.34) and (0.29, 0.28), which belong to white-color fluorescence, and those of [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNA, [B + R + G]//[M + C] JNN, [B + R + G + M + C] CNA and [B + R + G + M + C] CNN are ascertained to be (0.30, 0.45), (0.29, 0.44), (0.24, 0.34) and (0.24, 0.33), which represent green-color fluorescence. The physical digital photo and the fluorescence picture of the [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA under 365 nm ultraviolet light irradiation in a dark environment are shown in Fig. 11c. The color of [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA is dark green under natural light due to the existence of PANI in the array but [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA possesses obvious white light emission under 365 nm ultraviolet light irradiation in a dark environment.

From what has been discussed above, it can be easily concluded that the unique pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt structure can effectively suppress the excessive ET and achieve better white light emission. The above results indicate that the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt as the building unit in [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA possesses a four functional partitioned structure, which not only can achieve white light emission but also effectively avoid the influence of the dark-colored conductive material and magnetic material on the fluorescent material, so that [B + R]//[M@C]//[G] PNA has excellent fluorescence properties. Based on the above fluorescence analysis in combination with the foregoing conduction analysis, we can reasonably draw the conclusion that the structures (pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt, Janus nanobelt and composite nanobelt) and arrangement modes (array and non-array) of building units will directly influence the performances of the final products, and further the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt with four functional partitions used as a building unit has unique advantages in the construction of multifunctional materials.
Conclusions
In summary, [anthracene/Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2/PMMA]//[(CoFe2O4/PMMA)@(PANI/PMMA)]//[coumarin-6/PMMA] pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelts and arrays are rationally designed and constructed via electrospinning technology by using a unique [uniaxial needle]//[coaxial needle]//[uniaxial needle] parallel spinneret for the first time. Four independent domains in the nanobelts are microscopically obtained. Each pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt restricts the conductive polymer, fluorescent materials and magnetic nanoparticles in their own spatial areas due to its special four functional partitions, which effectively reduces the adverse mutual interferences among these functional materials to obtain excellent multifunctionalities. Both segregation and integration of poly-functions are realized in this pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt. The array film has strong fluorescence, high conductive anisotropy and tuned magnetism. Moreover, white light emission is realized by the combination of rare earth complexes and dyes via suppression of ET between dyes with the aid of the special structure of the pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt. The conductive anisotropy and magnetism of the array can be respectively adjusted by changing the content of PANI and CoFe2O4 NPs. When the content of PANI is 70%, the conductivity in the conductive direction is 8 orders of magnitude higher than that in the insulative direction. This unique pseudo-tricolor typed nanobelt with four functional partitions can be popularized to assemble other functional materials to realize the multi-function. The design idea and the construction method afford important theoretical and technical guidance for the design and fabrication of other multifunctional materials.
