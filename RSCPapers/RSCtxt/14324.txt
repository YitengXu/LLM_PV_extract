    , Accepted 15th December 2011First published on 25th January 2012AbstractConverting solar energy into fuel via photo-assisted water splitting to generate hydrogen or drive CO2 reduction is an attractive scientific and technological goal to address the increasing global demand for energy and to reduce the impact of energy production on climate change. Engineering an efficient, low-cost photocatalyst is necessary to achieve this technological goal. A photocatalyst combines a photosensitiser and an electrocatalyst to capture light and accelerate the chemical reactions in the same device. In this perspective paper, we first describe the recent developments of some families of semiconductors that are attractive candidates for engineering photocatalysts. We then discuss the use of semiconductors as light harvesting agents, combined with a bio-catalyst, synthetic bio-mimetic molecular catalyst or synthetic all-inorganic catalyst, in photocatalytic hybrid systems for water splitting and CO2 reduction. To highlight the advantages of semiconductors for engineering efficient and robust photocatalysts, we compare these systems to examples of homogeneous photocatalytic systems constructed from molecular photosensitisers (dyes). We conclude that all-inorganic catalysts coupled to appropriate semiconductors look more promising for the construction of robust photocatalytic hybrid systems for producing solar fuels.

Broader context
Exploiting renewable carbon-free energy sources such as solar energy is an attractive solution in response to satisfying present and future global energy demands, and to address environmental issues associated with the use of fossil fuels. Solar energy can be converted into chemical energy stored within highly energetic compounds such as hydrogen, methanol and methane (i.e. solar fuels) through the employment of appropriate robust and efficient photocatalysts. Such photocatalyst contains a light harvesting agent to capture sunlight and convert it into electrochemical potential needed to drive the chemical reactions required to produce solar fuels with the aid of appropriate electrocatalysts. In this review, we highlight progress in photocatalyst engineering involving the combination of a dye or semiconductor for light harvesting with a wide range of bio-, bio-mimetic or all-inorganic electrocatalysts. It was concluded that the hybridization of an all-inorganic electrocatalyst with a semiconductor is the most promising approach for engineering a robust system with sufficient turnover rates for solar fuels production.

1. Introduction
The global energy supply and the related environmental issues are among the biggest current technological challenges being confronted by chemists and technologists of our time. The rate of global energy use is projected to increase, from its current level of about 15 TW to 27 TW by 2050 and may reach 43 TW by 2100.1 Recent climate change issues linked to fossil fuel combustion demand more sustainable policies and actions. Alternative energy supplies are urgently needed to limit our dependence on fossil fuel. Solar energy is an attractive candidate for alternative energy because it is the most abundant and sustainable natural energy source. Each year, the Earth receives solar energy at a rate of ∼120000 TW, which is 104 times higher than the current global energy demand. A photovoltaic cell can convert solar energy into electricity for direct use or storage in batteries. Direct conversion of sunlight into fuels, often termed solar fuels, involves converting solar energy into energy stored in chemical bonds with the aid of an artificial photocatalyst. Solar fuels are an attractive solution for sustainable energy because the energy can be stored at a high density and is long-lived. Solar fuels can take the form of hydrogen (produced by photo-assisted water splitting, eqn (1) and (2)) or high-energy carbon compounds (CO, HCOOH, or CH3OH) that are produced by direct or indirect light-driven reduction of CO2 (eqn (3)–(7)): 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e, +0.81 V(1) 2H+ + 2e → H2, −0.42 V(2) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e → HCOOH, −0.61 V(3) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e → CO + H2O, −0.53 V(4) CO2 + 4H+ + 4e → HCHO + H2O, −0.48 V(5) CO2 + 6H+ + 6e → CH3OH + H2O, −0.38 V(6) CO3 + 8H+ + 8e → CH4 + 2H2O, −0.24 V(7)Note: redox potentials are converted to NHE reference, pH 7 (ref. 2).
As in the case of natural photosynthetic systems, artificial photocatalysts require a light harvesting system that captures and converts solar energy into the redox potentials required for driving chemical reactions (eqn (1)–(7)), with the aid of appropriate rate-accelerating electrocatalysts. Fig. 1 shows the schematic presentation of two possible engineering schemes for artificial photocatalysts. Electrocatalysts for water oxidation and reduction reactions can be co-attached to a light harvesting agent, which has an appropriate band structure for overall water splitting (Fig. 1A). The alternative is that the electrocatalysts are separately linked to two different semiconductors which are connected by a conventional ‘hard wire’ or by a redox mediator ‘soft wire’ (Fig. 1B). This design combines two semiconductors which, due to their restricted band structures, can drive only half of a water splitting process: either oxidation or reduction reaction. In this wired engineering, an external bias can be applied if necessary. For the maximum efficiency of these artificial photocatalytic systems, the key processes, such as (i) solar light absorption by the light harvesting agent, (ii) charge separation and electron transport, and (iii) effective utilization of the generated redox potential to drive desired chemical reactions through the aid of an efficient electrocatalyst, need to be optimized. Moreover both light harvesting agents and electrocatalysts employed must be stable under working conditions to achieve long-lived systems.
 Fig. 1  Schematic presentation of possible engineering processes of photocatalysts for water splitting. It consists of a light harvesting agent with appropriate band structure for overall water splitting into H2 and O2 and two electrocatalysts for water oxidation and proton reduction reactions (A). These two electrocatalysts can be separately loaded onto two different semiconductors that can drive only water oxidation or water reduction. External bias, from a solar cell, can be applied for this tandem configuration (B). Similar engineering can be applied for CO2 reduction photocatalysts. 
Noble metals and metal oxides (Pt, Pd, RuOx, IrOx, etc.) meet the requirements as electrocatalysts, which are able to catalyze desired reactions with relatively low overvoltages, have high catalytic rates (quantified by turnover frequency, TOF) and have stability for long-term application (quantified by total turnover number, TON). However, the scarcity and high cost of noble metals inhibit scaling up water splitting technology with these catalysts. As such, alternative low-cost, efficient, and robust electrocatalysts based on abundant elements are urgently needed to facilitate the production of solar fuel on a large scale. Both molecular dyes and semiconductors can be used as light harvesting agents in artificial photocatalysts. However, semiconductors seem to be more promising for engineering a long-lived robust system since dye is usually subjected to photodecomposition resulting in degradation of the photocatalyst. Here, we discuss recent developments in hybrid photocatalysts based on abundant materials for water splitting, hydrogen production and CO2 reduction. We begin by reviewing various promising semiconductor materials with light harvesting properties as well as photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activities. We then explore recent developments that integrate biocatalysts, synthetic bio-mimetic molecular catalysts and all-inorganic catalysts with such systems and emphasise those which approach the catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes, despite being compositionally and structurally different.
2. Some families of semiconductors are attractive candidates for engineering photocatalysts
Light absorption and charge separation within a semiconductor mirror the same principles as those found in natural photosynthesis. Semiconductors can therefore be loosely considered as bio-inspired equivalents of the natural photosensitising system, and they play an important role in developing efficient photocatalysts for solar fuel production. Since the publication of the seminal work by Fujishima and Honda3 on photo-driven water splitting using a TiO2 n-type semiconductor as photoanode, numerous families of semiconductors have been developed for this purpose. This area of research has been well documented in recent reviews.4–7 Readers are invited to refer to these papers for more details. Here, we briefly describe some semiconductors that we consider to be attractive candidates for engineering new photocatalysts.
2.1 Copper chalcopyrites and copper(I) oxide
Copper chalcopyrite compounds (i.e., CuInSe2, CuInS2 and CuInGaSe2) are attractive as photocathode materials because of their narrow and precise band gaps, which allow strong absorption of solar radiation at specific wavelengths. They have band structures, which are easily tailored to specific needs by altering the alloy composition (band gap 1.1–2.5 eV), and also have excellent electronic transport properties.8 The conduction bands of this class of semiconductors lie at a more negative potential than that of 2H+/H2 and CO2/HCOOH redox couples, which makes them potential photocatalysts for hydrogen production and CO2 reduction (Fig. 2). However, because their valence band positions are more negative than required for the water oxidation reaction, copper chalcopyrite must be used in tandem configuration with another semiconductor to produce a complete photo-driven water splitting/proton or CO2 reduction system.
 Fig. 2  Band position of selected semiconductor materials in contact with an aqueous electrolyte (pH 7) (green lines represent the upper edge of the valence band and red ones represent the lower edge of the conduction band). The visible spectrum corresponds to energies from 1.56 eV (800 nm) to 3.12 eV (400 nm). 
Copper chalcopyrite can be synthesised as thin films,9 nanocrystals,10 nanowires,11,12 nanorods or nanotubes.13 Currently, nanostructure forms of semiconductors have gained increasing attention, both generally and for copper chalcopyrite specifically, as an emerging approach to enhance the photo-electrochemical efficiency of semiconductors for both solar cell and solar fuel applications. The improvement in photo-assisted energy conversion is possible because nanoscale engineering allows for the tailoring of the band structure, enhancing the efficiency of charge separation and charge transport and increasing the reactivity of the bulk solution reagents at the semiconductor/solution interface due to the increased semiconductor surface area.
Copper(I) oxide is another promising p-type semiconductor that has a narrow band gap (2.0–2.2 eV), a high absorption coefficient over the solar irradiation spectrum and conduction band positions at ∼−1.15 V (vs. NHE (pH 7)) which is thermodynamically suitable for hydrogen production or CO2 reduction (Fig. 1). Economical scaling up of this material is feasible because copper is found in relatively abundant supply and exhibits low environmental toxicity. However, Cu2O suffers from self-photoreduction into Cu0 when the generated electrons are not used quickly and efficiently in the intended reduction reactions. Combining Cu2O with an n-type semiconductor with a more positive conduction band (i.e., TiO2 or ZnO) in a p–n junction can improve its photostability14 because the electrons are efficiently transported to the n-type semiconductor, thus reducing the self-photoreduction process. Recently, Grätzel and co-workers reported a multilayer system made of a homogeneous coating of a Cu2O film with 5 bilayers (ZnO (4 nm)/Al2O3 (0.17 nm)), followed by a TiO2 thin film (11 nm) and topped with a layer of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) that act as a co-catalyst for H2 evolution15 (Fig. 3). The ZnO/Al2O3/TiO2 multi-layer forms a p–n junction with Cu2O and isolates the latter from electrolyte solution, therefore minimizing the self-photoreduction. The authors reported an impressive photocurrent of 7.4 mA cm−2 with good photostability (only 20% reduction in photocurrent after 20 min of irradiation) with this multilayer photocathode subjected to AM 1.5 illumination in a pH 4.9 electrolyte solution. The incident photo-to-current efficiency was 40%, and the Faradic yield was unity for H2 photo-evolution at 0 V compared to RHE. However, such engineering decreases the reductive potential of photo-generated electrons due to their migration in the conduction band of TiO2. As a result, an efficient electrocatalyst, which can facilitate hydrogen evolution reaction with small overvoltage requirement (less than 170 mV, the difference between the TiO2 conduction band level and redox potential of the H+/H2 couple), is needed. Chen et al. reported a nanostructuring approach to improve photostability and photocatalytic properties of Cu2O. The authors demonstrated that Cu2O nanowires displayed superior photostability and a higher photocurrent than Cu2O cube-like nanoparticles (a factor of 5 was found for photocurrent at a bias of −0.3 V).16 Here, better generated charge diffusion within the Cu2O nanowire and a more efficient use of electrons for proton reduction at the nanowire–electrolyte interface are possible reasons for this improvement.

2.2 Hematite (α-Fe2O3)
Hematite (α-Fe2O3) is an attractive photoanode material for water splitting because of its visible light absorption (band gap 2.1 eV), its high stability under operation conditions and its widespread availability. However, its photo-oxidising water efficiency is limited due to indirect band gap transitions,17 a very short excited-state lifetime (10−12 s),18 a short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm)19 and slow kinetics in the oxygen evolution reaction.20 To address these issues, researchers have explored elemental doping,21–23 varying electrode nanostructures,24,25 plasmonic Au nanoparticles26 or O2-evolution co-catalysts.20 Elemental doping and nanostructuring were thought to allow for enhancing the diffusion of photogenerated charges from bulk hematite onto its surface to drive chemical reactions. Plasmonic Au nanoparticles were shown to improve absorption and charge separation on the Fe2O3–Au interface. For hybrid photocatalyst engineering, an O2-evolving catalyst was decorated onto the hematite surface for enhancing water oxidation reaction. To date, nickel oxides, cobalt oxides and their oxide-phosphate cubane-like clusters have been reported in a hybrid with Fe2O3-based photocatalysts. We will address our analysis in greater detail on this hybrid approach in Sections 5.3 and 5.4. However, it is worthy of note that the conduction band level of α-Fe2O3 is not sufficient to reduce protons to hydrogen (Fig. 2). Applying an external bias or combining this n-type oxide with another appropriate p-type semiconductor in a tandem configuration (Fig. 1B) is needed to drive the complete water splitting reaction.
2.3 Titanium dioxide (TiO2)
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been used in a wide variety of technological applications such as sunscreens, photodegradation of organic pollutants, and photovoltaic cells. The synthesis, characterisation and application of TiO2-based nanomaterials were documented recently by Chen and Mao.27 Here, we briefly summarise some of the most recent advancements in TiO2-based photocatalysts for water splitting application. Fujishima and Honda published the first proof-of-concept study using TiO2 as the photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell for photo-assisted water splitting.3 This n-type semiconductor has outstanding chemical and thermal stability, is easy to manufacture, and is economical, all of which are major advantages for use in solar energy conversion. However, due to its wide band gap (3.0–3.2 eV), this material only absorbs UV light. Moreover, its conduction band (−0.52 V vs. NHE for anatase, pH 6)28 is quite close to the thermodynamic potential of the 2H+/H2 couple (−0.36 V vs. NHE, pH 6), which requires the use of an efficient co-catalyst with a relatively low overvoltage requirement (e.g., Pt) to produce H2. Engineering strategies to narrow the band gap for visible light absorption and enhance the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 have been employed, including nanostructuring,29,30 elemental doping,31,32 coupling with a narrow band gap p-type semiconductor such as Cu2O in a p–n junction,33,34 dye sensitisation,35,36 grafting silica species37 or iron oxide,38 forming a composite with graphene or C60 as an electron-acceptor39–42 or using H2 evolution co-catalysts.43–45 Recently, Mao and co-workers introduced a disordered layer onto TiO2 nanocrystal surfaces as a new way to sensitise TiO2.46 The disordered layer, created by partial hydrogenation of the TiO2 nanocrystal surface, shifted the absorption of TiO2 dramatically from the UV range to the near infrared spectrum. Black TiO2, loaded with Pt nanoparticle co-catalysts, generated H2 in a highly efficient manner under visible light (10 mmol H2 g−1 h−1), with catalytic activity that was stable for up to 22 days. In a different approach, Batzill and co-workers observed a narrow band gap of 2.1 eV for the two-dimensional TiO2 grown on a rutile TiO2 (001) surface.47 However, information on the photocatalytic efficiency of this material was not reported.
2.4 Carbon nitride
Carbon nitride, named g-C3N4, is a graphite-like polymeric semiconductor that exhibits outstanding chemical and photochemical stability. This n-type semiconductor has a band gap of ∼2.7 eV that allows a maximal absorption at 400–450 nm. Band gap engineering was achieved by elemental (B, S, F) doping,48–51 protonation post-treatment52 or by copolymerization of the g-C3N4 precursor with barbituric acid.53 For instance, photogenerated currents reported for this material are rather low, in the order of a few microamperes (μA).54,55 However, the rich chemistry of graphite-like g-C3N4 matrix makes possible to functionalize this semiconductor to enhance its light harvesting activities. Domen and colleagues reported attachment of magnesium phythalocyanine (MgPc) dye on a C3N4 matrix via π–π stacking interactions that allows for more efficient capture of the visible light spectrum.56 Also via π–π interaction, a C3N4–graphene composite was synthesized.57,58 In this engineering, graphene acts as electron acceptor59 forming a p–n junction with a C3N4 semiconductor. As a result, charge separation within the C3N4 matrix was improved and translated into enhancement of the photocurrent (a factor of 3).57 Graphene content should be carefully dosed to avoid its competitive absorption to C3N4. Recently, engineering mesoporous C3N4, named mpg-C3N4, appeared to be the most promising strategy to enhance light harvesting and catalytic activities of carbon nitride by increasing its surface area and creating multiple scattering effects.54,60
The application of carbon nitride as photocatalyst for water splitting has been demonstrated. For instance, both photo-assisted water oxidation and proton reduction reactions were investigated, though separately. mpg-C3N4 is catalytically active for H2 photogeneration from triethanolamine (TEOA)/water solution with54,60 or without55 a platinum nanoparticle co-catalyst. Catalytic efficiency was found to be strongly dependent on the porosity and surface area of mpg-C3N4: higher surface area resulted in higher efficiency for H2 photogeneration. A positive effect was also reported using graphene as an electron acceptor, where the mpg-C3N4/graphene composite showed 3 times more activity than pristine mpg-C3N4.58 Water photo-oxidation was also demonstrated to be feasible with carbon nitride photocatalyst.61,62 In this case, O2-evolving electrocatalysts (RuO2, Co3O4, etc.) are required as co-catalysts on mpg-C3N4.
The latest advancement achieved by Domen and colleagues,62 the construction of a mpg-C3N4/Co3O4 photocatalyst for water oxidation, highlights the possibility to design a low-cost photocatalyst for water splitting based on the carbon nitride semiconductor and noble metal free electrocatalyst. However, attachment of a platinum free H2-evolving electrocatalyst onto a carbon nitride matrix has yet to be reported. Given that the band structure of carbon nitride is suitable for driving the overall water splitting process, it would be interesting to co-attach both H2-evolving and O2-evolving electrocatalysts onto the carbon nitride surface to produce a wireless hybrid photocatalyst. Further efforts are also needed to address issues related to light absorption properties of carbon nitride to optimize solar light harvesting.
2.5 Other semiconductors
Other semiconductors, including CdS, CdSe, WO3, GaP, GaAs, and ZnO, have also been successfully used as photocatalysts for water oxidation, hydrogen production or overall water splitting, but these materials suffer from low chemical and photochemical stability and potential toxicity, which hinder their use for large scale energy conversion. Semiconductors, such as CdTe, InP, and N-doped Ta2O5, have acted as hybrid photocatalysts for H2 evolution, CO2 reduction or water oxidation when coupled with an electrocatalyst. These materials will be further considered when we discuss hybrid materials later in this article.
To conclude this section on semiconductor photocatalysts, we would like to highlight the key observations from the current literature and our views on this field in the future. Even though numerous attractive semiconductor families have been developed and explored, there is still no artificial photocatalyst that can spontaneously split water into H2 and O2 with sufficient rate for application. Narrow band gap semiconductors such as copper chalcopyrites, copper(I) oxide and hematite have good visible light absorption properties but their band gap structure is not appropriate for driving the overall water splitting process. Moreover, they are usually subjected to photo-corrosion phenomenon that limits their application for engineering long-lived robust devices. Other semiconductors that have an appropriate band structure for the water splitting process and are relatively stable such as TiO2, carbon nitride, etc. can absorb only a small portion of the solar spectrum. Consequently, light-to-current conversion efficiency is rather moderate for these materials. The multiple layer design reported by Grätzel's group is an attractive strategy to overcome the photo-instability of narrow band gap semiconductors. For water splitting application, employing these semiconductors in a tandem configuration with a conventional “hard wire”, which allow external bias application to the system, or with a redox mediator “soft wire” could be the solution. To enhance light harvesting efficiency of semiconductors, different promising strategies have been proposed including elemental doping and nanostructuring. However, due to the multiple electron nature of chemical reactions of the water splitting process, employing an efficient electrocatalyst as a co-catalyst to accelerate redox reactions on a semiconductor surface is indispensable in order to achieve fast rates and high efficiencies. The role of electrocatalyst is also very important when we wish to reduce CO2 to fuels again due to the multielectron requirements. Hence, in our view the development of electrocatalysts must go hand-in-hand with development of semiconductors and for an efficient photocatalyst the assemblage electrocatalyst-semiconductor should be targeted. In the following sections, we examine the current situation in development of hybrid photocatalysts for water reduction to H2, CO2 reduction and water oxidation reactions with the prospects of employing these photocatalysts for solar fuel production.
3. Engineering photocatalysts for H2 evolution
3.1 Using hydrogenases
In a wide range of micro-organisms, hydrogenases efficiently catalyse the reversible inter-conversion between two protons and two electrons and molecular hydrogen. Hydrogenases are attractive catalysts for integrating into technological devices, such as electrolysers and hydrogen fuel cells. Moore and co-workers reported the first integration of a [FeFe]-hydrogenase within a photoelectrochemical cell (Fig. 4A).63 In this wired photocatalytic system, the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from Clostridium acetobutylicum (CaHydA) was immobilised onto carbon felt and was used as a cathode, while a porphyrin-sensitised TiO2 acted as the photoanode.
 Fig. 4  Photocatalyst and photoelectrochemical cell engineering using hydrogenases as H2 evolving catalysts: (A) Moore's photoelectrochemical cell, ref. 63; (B) Armstrong's photocatalyst, ref. 64 and 65; and (C) King's photocatalyst, ref. 67. 
Photocatalysts for H2 generation can be achieved by direct attachment of hydrogenase to a light harvesting agent: a dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticle or a semiconductor. Armstrong and co-workers created an efficient and stable photocatalytic system by grafting an O2-tolerant hydrogenase, [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum, onto [Ru(bpy)3]2+-sensitised TiO2 nanoparticles (TOF 50 s−1 in pH 7 buffer, using a TEOA sacrificial electron donor) (Fig. 4B).64,65 King and co-authors combined the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from Clostridium acetobutylicum with CdTe nanocrystals (p-type, band gap 2.1 eV, conduction band edge −1.98 V (ref. 66)) via electrostatic interactions (Fig. 4C).67 The CdTe (2.5 nm) nanocrystal surface was functionalised by mercaptopropionic acid (deprotonated at pH values above 4.3 (pKa)), creating a negatively charged surface for hydrogenase adsorption. Under optimised conditions, this CdTe nanocrystal–hydrogenase hybrid produced H2 with a TOF of 25 mol H2 mol−1 H2ase s−1, which was two times less efficient than the results obtained with Armstrong's hydrogenase hybrid. At 532 nm illumination, this hybrid material had a photo-to-H2 conversion efficiency of 9.0 ± 1%. However, the mercaptopropionic acid was dissociated from the CdTe surface due to instability of the CdTe–S thiolate bond under acidic conditions causing precipitation of this nanocrystal and leading to a decrease in the H2 evolution efficiency.
These original works gave a nice proof-of-concept for the direct integration of hydrogenase within a photocatalytic system for H2 photoproduction. It was also demonstrated by Armstrong's group that hydrogenase can be used as a H2 oxidation catalyst in the anode of a hydrogen proton exchange membrane fuel cell.68 However, the application of hydrogenase-based technological devices is uncertain. Several issues can be raised for discussion such as: (i) scale limitations imposed by using a biological enzyme, (ii) oxygen sensitivity for the majority of known hydrogenases, and (iii) large geometric size of hydrogenases that do not allow for high loading of these biocatalysts on an electrode surface to gain sufficient current/photocurrent. These issues are also similar for other biocatalysts such as carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, or photosystem II that would be discussed in the next sections.
3.2 Using synthetic organometallic molecular catalysts that mimic active sites of hydrogenases

3.2.1 A brief overview of synthetic bio-mimetic molecular catalysts. 
While the direct use of hydrogenase raises technical concerns, the synthesis and employment of a small molecular catalyst that mimics the catalytic centre of hydrogenase, named [H]-cluster, could be a good alternative. Importantly, the [H]-clusters contain only abundant elements: Fe, Ni, C, H, N, O, and S. Therefore, by mimicking the [H] cluster, it may be possible to produce low-cost molecular catalysts to replace platinum in a water splitting electrolyser or photoelectrolyser. Important advancement has been achieved in this research direction in the last two decades, during which several synthetic catalysts which are coordination compounds of Fe, Co or Ni were developed.69–71 Most of these synthetic compounds are dinuclear [FeFe] complexes which exclusively catalyse H2 evolution from protonated organic solutions and with relatively high overvoltage requirement (0.5–1.0 V). In contrast, there are only limited water-soluble [FeFe] catalysts that facilitate H2 evolution.72
To date, the highest catalytic activities were reported for nickel bisdiphosphine catalysts designed by DuBois's group. These catalysts contain the key functional features of [H]-clusters: a Ni2+ redox platform as found in the [NiFe]-hydrogenase and nitrogen proton relays at the second coordination sphere as found in the aza-dithiolate ligand in the [FeFe]-hydrogenase. Recently, using a nickel bisdiphosphine electrocatalyst wherein a coordination environment was designed to facilitate protonation and proton-coupled-electron transfer process, Dubois and colleagues reported a remarkable TOF of 106000 s−1 from protonated acetonitrile/water solution which is even higher than that reported for [FeFe]-hydrogenase, 9000 s−1. However, the nickel bisdiphosphine catalyst required ∼600 mV overvoltage to function whereas less than 100 mV overvoltage is needed for hydrogenase. Overvoltage requirement can be minimized along with significant enhancement of catalytic activities when the nickel bisdiphosphine catalyst is immobilized onto conducting porous carbon nanotube electrodes to accelerate electron communication as reported by Artero and colleagues.73,74
Cobaloxime is another efficient family of H2 evolution catalysts and contains a coordinated CoIII ion as the redox platform and an –OH group in the second coordination sphere as the proton relay position. These catalysts facilitate H2 evolution in strong acids and organic solutions.75–78 Recently, Alberto and co-workers used these cobaloxime catalysts in aqueous solution with an optimised pH range of 8 to 10.79 Under the reported conditions, the cobaloxime catalysts degraded, most likely due to their inherent instability, which can be minimised by using diffusible ligands in the experimental solution. However, this issue becomes more critical when the cobaloxime catalysts are attached onto an electrode surface in a cathode or photocathode system, in which any irreversible decomposition of the catalysts will lead to deactivation of the system in the absence of a self-repairing capability. Therefore, the more stable and active cobalt diimine–dioxime catalyst developed by Artero and co-workers is the most promising second-generation technology for cobaloxime catalysts for future electrode and photoelectrode engineering.80


3.2.2 Coupling molecular catalyst with dye to construct homogeneous photocatalyst. 
To avoid the external bias needed for H2 evolution when using molecular bio-mimetic electrocatalysts, it is desirable to have these catalysts with light harvesting agents. In such a system, the light-harvesting agent captures and converts sunlight to required reducing potential for catalytic H2 evolution. The first attempts involved the use of dyes ([Ru(bpy)3]2+, [Ir(bpy)3]2+, metalloporphyrin or organic dyes) used in combination with biomimetic [FeFe]-catalysts, cobaloxime catalysts or nickel bisdiphosphine catalysts. In Table 1, we summarise photocatalytic investigation of some representative systems for discussion. Details of photocatalytic efficiency, mechanistic insight, etc. of other systems can be found in recent reviews.81,82

To date, very low photocatalytic activities (only few TONs) were reported for systems constructed using the [FeFe] electrocatalyst.83,84 High overvoltage requirement to reduce protons to H2 and the instability of [FeFe] electrocatalyst are thought to be the reasons for this inefficiency. Better activities were achieved for cobalt-based and nickel-based systems.85–88,90,92 However, for all investigated systems, H2 photoproduction yield decreased with time. Eisenberg and colleagues reported an initial TOF of 20 h−1 for their systems combining [Ru(bpy)3]2+ or Eosin Y dye with [Ni(P2PhN2Ph)2](BF4)2 catalyst which significantly decreased subsequently.92 The authors studied the intactness of the nickel bisdiphosphine catalyst during the H2 photoproduction process and found that the degradation of their system was caused by photo-instability of dyes. By continuously adding [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye into their system, 2700 TON after 150 h was achieved.
In the multiple component photocatalytic system, the excited state of dye (PS*) is quenched by a sacrificial electron donor giving PS−, a potent reducing agent, which needs to be efficiently quenched by a catalyst to avoid degradation.89,92 In a dye-sensitized solar cell, this oxidative quenching is efficiently performed by the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticles. Exploiting this approach, Lakadamyali and Reisner reported a co-immobilization of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye and Co(dmgH)2PyridineCl catalyst onto TiO2 nanoparticles via phosphate linkages (Fig. 5A).91 The cobaloxime catalyst is active for H2 evolution reaction from Et3NH+/DMF solution with only 30 mM overvoltage requirement.75 Hence it is expected that TiO2 conduction band electrons were still sufficiently reactive to reduce protons to H2 from aqueous pH 7 solution. A direct reductive quenching of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye excited state by a CoIII catalyst is also probable, in our opinion. An initial TOF of 19 ± 1 h−1 was achieved for this system under visible light irradiation. Here again, the system was deactivated after 4 h irradiation indicating photodegradation of dye and/or cobalt catalyst.
 Fig. 5  Co-attachment of Ru dye and cobaloxime catalyst onto TiO2 nanopowder designed by Lakadamyali and Reisner (A), ref. 91; assemblage of a CdTe nanocrystal and [FeFe] catalyst in aqueous solution (B), ref. 93; and embedding the [FeFe] catalyst within a mesoporous InP semiconductor support (C), ref. 94. 
In summary, besides efforts needed to design new molecular catalysts which are more stable and functional for H2 generation with high TOF and low overvoltage requirements, robust light harvesting agents can be explored to combine with some known potential catalysts to engineer photocatalytic systems. Some of the known semiconductors display interesting chemical and photostability. They are therefore promising alternatives to dyes for engineering robust artificial photocatalysts. We discuss on hybridization of semiconductors and molecular catalysts in the following section.


3.2.3 Integration of a molecular catalyst with a semiconductor to construct photocathode materials. 
Wu and co-workers reported using a CdTe nanocrystal to replace molecular dye in a homogeneous photocatalytic multiple component system.93 The CdTe nanocrystal was first decorated with 3-mercaptopropionic acid to create a stable aqueous dispersion and then mixed with a water soluble [FeFe] catalyst (Fig. 5B). Under optimised conditions, a TON rate of 505 was achieved for H2 evolution after 10 h of visible light irradiation. This is the record H2 photogeneration efficiency reported to date for a photocatalytic system based on the [FeFe] electrocatalyst. This work highlights that semiconductors can positively contribute to the robustness of artificial photocatalysts even though deactivation was still observed on this CdTe-[FeFe] system after 10 h irradiation.
Nann, Pickett and co-workers reported a hybrid photocathode engineering by incorporating [Fe(CO)3-Fe(CO)3] (the simplest mimic of [FeFe]-hydrogenases' [H]-cluster) within a mesoporous support of InP nanocrystals (band gap: 2 eV) (Fig. 5C).94 In this system, InP semiconductors generated photoinduced electrons with excess reductive potential (InP conduction band positions at −1 V vs. Ag/AgCl) than that needed for H2 evolution catalysed by the [FeFe] catalyst (Ecat = −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl). A moderate photocurrent density of ∼110 nA cm−2 was obtained at a bias potential of −400 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in a pH 7 aqueous solution under illumination with a 395 nm LED. H2 was produced with a faradic yield of 60%. Surprisingly, the photocurrent was steady for at least one hour, suggesting that the diion hexacarbonyl complex is stable once it is incorporated within the porous semiconductor support.
The Co(dmgH)2PyridineCl catalyst was covalently attached onto a TiO2 nanoparticle, resulting in a photocatalyst that can function for H2 generation under UV light (Fig. 5A).91 In pH 7 buffer solution with TEOA as artificial electron donor, H2 was generated with an initial rate of 42 ± 3 h−1. Interestingly, this system exhibited higher robustness than the similar system with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye co-attached. The Co(dmgH)2PyridineCl–TiO2 system continuously generated H2 whereas the Co(dmgH)2PyridineCl–TiO2–Ru(bpy)32+ system was deactivated after 4 h. Functional assemblies of cobalt, nickel catalysts with robust visible light active semiconductors are still to be reported.

3.3 Using robust all-inorganic electrocatalysts
Both hydrogenases and their synthetic models are potential electrocatalysts for assembling with light harvesting agents (dyes or semiconductors) to engineer artificial photocatalysts. Indeed, as reviewed above, a proof-of-concept of such combination has been achieved. However, further work is needed to address the stability issue of these photocatalytic systems. With the requirement of long operating lifetimes it is also important to develop and exploit other potential H2-evolving electrocatalysts which do not contain any organic ligand in their structure and therefore could be relatively more stable.
Two examples are MoS295–97 and WS2.98,99 The edge plane of single layer MoS2 can be loosely considered as a mimicking equivalent of the active site of hydrogenases.100 MoS2 had been reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for H2 evolution in a wide range of electrolyte media (pH 0–13).96,101 H2 photoproduction was obtained under visible light irradiation using a three component photocatalytic system containing colloidal nanoparticles MoS2 electrocatalyst, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye and ascorbic acid.102 MoS2 and WS2 nanoparticles or nanodots were also employed to enhance H2 photo-evolution using CdS, a visible light absorption semiconductor (Fig. 6A).98,103,104
 Fig. 6  All-inorganic photocatalyst based on abundant elements: MoS2 or WS2 catalyst loaded on CdS nanocrystal or nanoparticles (A), ref. 98,103 and 104; [Mo3S4] cluster or NiMo alloy deposited on silicon pillar/wires (B), ref. 105 and 109. 
Most recently, Chorkendorff and co-workers constructed a promising photocathode by physically adsorbing a bioinspired H2 evolution catalyst, a [Mo3S4] cluster, onto a p-type Si semiconductor (Fig. 6B).105 When a nano-structured Si pillar electrode was used, a photocatalytic current as high as 9 mA cm−1 was achieved with 0 (zero) overpotential and a faradic efficiency of unity. This electrode, which could work continuously for 24 h without any significant deactivation, achieved a TOF of 65 s−1. However, the deposited [Mo3S4] co-catalyst, when placed in an electrolyte medium, detached from the electrode due to the lack of a robust linkage between this cluster and the Si surface.
Yu and Ran reported the use of Cu(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 nanoclusters as pre-catalysts for H2 evolution.106,107 These clusters were coated on TiO2 NPs and were then reduced in situ by electrons generated from UV-irradiated TiO2, resulting in the formation of Cu0 and Ni0 clusters that subsequently acted as co-catalysts. Recently, we demonstrated that loading Ni0 and Co0 nanoclusters onto TiO2 nanopowders at a low surface concentration significantly improves photocatalytic H2 evolution of this material under UV light.108 TiO2/Co or TiO2/Ni displayed a catalytic efficiency only 4–7 times lower than that of TiO2/Pt nanoparticles at a similar co-catalyst concentration loading, while pristine TiO2 was catalytically inactive under the experimental conditions. It was noted that Co and Ni are positioned lower than the noble metals but at the same level as MoS2 in the volcano plot of the exchange current density as a function of the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy of adsorbed atomic hydrogen.96 Homogeneous, stable adsorption of these earth-abundant co-catalysts on semiconductors which absorb visible light can be an attractive approach to fabricate low-cost photocatalytic materials for photo-driven hydrogen production.
Recently, Gray and co-workers reported an attractive photocatalyst engineered by depositing a Ni or Ni–Mo alloy electrocatalyst onto planar or microwire array-doped p+-Si substrates (Fig. 6B).109 It was found that both Ni and Ni–Mo alloys are efficient co-catalysts for H2 evolution. An impressive photocurrent density of 20 mA cm−2 was achieved for planar Ni/p-Si or Ni–Mo/p-Si photocathodes under illumination (100 W cm−2 of AM 1.5 solar simulation) in a pH 4.5 electrolyte solution, with a bias of −100 mV (vs. RHE). These results are similar to those obtained for planar Pt/p-Si (photocurrent of 25 mA cm−2) under similar conditions. Energy conversion efficiencies of 0.2–0.4% were achieved for these photocatalysts.
The latest breakthrough in the development of a robust and efficient H2-evolving catalyst based on earth abundant elements has been reported recently by the Nocera group.110 A ternary alloy NiMoZn was discovered in which Zn acts as a soft material, desorbing in electrolyte solution and presenting freshly porous NiMo alloy, which displays outstanding catalytic activities for H2 evolution. With the same geometric surface area, this alloy showed 50 times higher current than a smooth Ni electrode in 1 M potassium borate (pH 9.2) solution. These latest advancements achieved by Nocera and Gray's groups highlight the possibility of using abundant elements to engineer water splitting photocatalysts.
4. Engineering photocatalyst for CO2 reduction
4.1 Using CO2 fixation enzymes
The first example of photo-assisted CO2 reduction using an enzyme catalyst was published by Parkinson and Weaver in 1984.111 In this seminal work, a p-type Zn-doped InP semiconductor harvested sunlight, generating reducing power that was subsequently transferred to a dehydrogenase enzyme through a methyl viologen mediator to drive the two-electron reduction of CO2 to formic acid. With a similar configuration, using a CdS light harvester and an isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme, the photo-assisted fixation of CO2 in oxoglutaric acid produced isocitric acid.112 A quantum efficiency of 1.2% was reported at 410 nm with an intensity of 1.3 mW cm−2. Armstrong and co-workers recently reported the direct integration of carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) (the biocatalyst for interconversion of CO and CO2) onto dye-sensitised TiO2 nanoparticles113,114 or CdS nanocrystal115 suspended in aqueous buffer at pH 6 (Fig. 7). Under visible light irradiation, the dye-sensitized TiO2 system reduced CO2 to CO at a TOF of 0.14 s−1. Significantly higher efficiency was achieved for the CdS nanocrystal system (TOF of 1.23 s−1). Better interaction between the CdS nanocrystal and CODH biocatalyst as well as broader visible light absorption of CdS compared with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye-sensitized TiO2 can be the origin of this difference. However, these systems were unstable over long time periods, due to enzyme detachment from the semiconductor surface. The active site of these enzymes is a [Ni4Fe-4S] cluster and could be, as for the [H]-cluster of hydrogenases, a source of inspiration for construction of molecular catalysts for converting CO2 to CO.

4.2 Using a synthetic molecular catalyst in a homogeneous photocatalytic system
Molecular catalysts provide a promising approach for constructing robust photocatalytic materials for CO2 photoreduction, as reviewed by Fujita and Meyer.2 Potential catalysts include nickel and cobalt tetraaza-macrocyclic compounds,116 ruthenium and ruthenium bipyridine complexes117–119 and ruthenium bipyridine-based polymer [(Ru0(bpy)(CO)2)n].120,121 Deronzier's [(Ru0(bpy)(CO)2)n] polymeric film deposited onto a conducting electrode support is a good electrocatalyst for the two-electron reduction of CO2 to CO or HCOOH because it has a relatively low overvoltage requirement and is active over a large pH range. The selectivity of the electrocatalytic reaction could be tuned by tailoring the electronic nature of the substitutes introduced into the bipyridine ligand. Under optimised conditions, HCOOH was produced with a current efficiency of 90%. However, the Ru0 electrocatalyst film was unstable at potentials higher than −0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), making it difficult to handle this catalyst in air.
CO2 photo-reduction catalysts have been constructed by combining these molecular catalysts with a dye in a supramolecular system via robust covalent linkages.122–124 For example, the Ishitani [RuRe(P(OEt)3)] system catalyses the reduction of CO2 to CO up to 232 TON with a quantum efficiency of 0.21 under visible light from a homogeneous CO2-saturated DMF solution.124 However, as in the case of engineering a photocatalyst for H2 production, photodegradation of dye is an issue that places limitations on this supramolecular approach.
4.3 By immobilisation of molecular catalyst onto semiconductor electrode surface
Sato et al. reported immobilisation of a molecular CO2 reduction catalyst onto a semiconductor surface for engineering hybrid photocatalytic materials.125–128 The ruthenium catalysts were grafted onto different p-type semiconductors such as N-doped Ta2O5, Z-doped InP, etc. via covalent linkages or via a polymerization process. We summarise catalysts employed for this hybridization in Fig. 8 and photocatalytic activities of each are given in Table 2. It was reported that the robustness of a hybrid system depends strongly on the choice of grafting linkages. The (1a)/N-Ta2O5 system with phosphate linker displayed a 5 times higher rate of CO2 reduction to HCOOH (in acetonitrile solution using visible light) compared with the (1b)/N-Ta2O5 system with carbonate linker (Fig. 9A). By using a Deronzier's-type ruthenium bipyridine-based polymeric film (2) catalyst, a robust system being adapted for working in aqueous solution was achieved (Fig. 9B).

 Fig. 9  Integration of a CO2 reduction catalyst within photocatalysts (A and B), ref. 128 and 129; and a photocatalytic device (C), ref. 127. 
An attractive scientific and technological solution to reducing CO2 to fuel is to couple CO2-reducing photocatalysts with a water oxidation photocatalyst. In principle, the coupling can be conducted in a photoelectrochemical cell, where a CO2 reduction photocatalyst is deposited onto a cathode, while the anode contains a water oxidation photocatalyst. Such engineering has been reported recently by Sato, Arai and co-workers (Fig. 9C).127 In their photoelectrochemical cell, the photoanode was a Pt-decorated TiO2 electrode and the photocathode was an InP electrode on which the CO2 reduction catalyst (2) was grafted. Two compartments were separated by a proton exchange membrane. Under white light irradiation, the TiO2 electrode absorbed UV light generating an electron–hole pair. Electrons are conducted via a wire to an InP photocathode where they are excited by visible light to get enough reductive potential for driving CO2 reduction to HCOOH. Generated holes in the TiO2 photoanode were used to extract electrons from water via a 2-electron oxidation process catalyzed by Pt nanoparticles resulting in H2O2 which subsequently decomposed to water and O2. A solar-to-fuel efficiency of 0.03–0.04% was achieved for this photoelectrochemical cell.
CO2-reducing and O2-evolving electrocatalysts can also be co-immobilised onto the surface of a semiconductor that contains a band structure matching both the CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions (wireless system). To the best of our knowledge, an engineered bifunctional tandem hybrid photocatalyst is absent in the open literature.
It is worth noting that ruthenium catalysts employed in photocatalytic systems discussed above catalyze exclusively for two electron reduction of CO2 to formate and CO. Although these reduced carbon compounds are usable precursors in the chemical industry, they are not ideal ‘fuels’ due to their low energetic storage density and toxicity to human beings. As fuels, methanol and methane are more desired. In this context, the simple pyridinium (7)/p-GaP system reported by Bocarsly and colleagues130 seems to be very exciting. An outstanding solar-to-methanol efficiency of 44% was achieved at 365 nm irradiation and with an applied bias of −0.5 V vs. SCE. It is still not clear how the pyridinium, a metal free electrocatalyst, will function on other semiconductors but it can be considered as an alternative for engineering CO2 reduction photocatalysts. Another promising candidate is copper. For example, Grimes and colleagues reported an efficient photocatalyst to reduce CO2 to methane by loading a copper co-catalyst onto N-doped TiO2.133 An important issue that must be taken into account for CO2 reduction is its low solubility in water and other solvents, making its concentration and conversion into fuels challenging. Using an electrocatalyst or photocatalyst that is encapsulated within Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) can be a solution, given that this porous structured material has excellent CO2 adsorption properties. Such a system was recently reported by Wang et al.134
5. Engineering photocatalysts for water oxidation
5.1 Using PSII
Photosystem II (PSII) is a multi-subunit enzyme that catalyses light-driven water oxidation reaction of natural photosynthesis. Upon irradiation, the chlorophyll antenna absorbs sunlight resulting in efficient charge separation and charge transfer via a sequenced electron transfer process involving a chain of redox active cofactors.135 The generated oxidative driving force is transferred to the O2-evolving centre (OEC) composed of a CaMn4Ox cubane cluster,136 where water oxidation reaction occurs. Photoelectrodes for driving water oxidation can therefore in principle be achieved by immobilization of PSII onto a conducting electrode surface in a way comparable with the immobilisation of hydrogenase enzymes for hydrogen production. Immobilisation of PSII can be done: (i) via selective interaction of the His-tag, genetically pre-introduced onto the surface of PSII, and the exposed Ni2+ function pre-introduced onto the electrode surface (Fig. 10A)137 or (ii) by embedding this enzyme within a porous polymer matrix (Fig. 10B).138 For the first immobilisation methodology, only one layer of PSII can be expected on the electrode surface resulting in poor light absorption and consequently low photocurrent density. Even when an 80% coverage was achieved on a gold electrode surface the photocurrent was only 8 μA cm−2 mW−1.137 Higher current densities up to 18 μA cm−2 mW−1 were reported when the PSII enzyme was embedded within a polymer matrix, which is pre-modified by the Os-complex, playing as an efficient redox mediator.138 However in both cases, the immobilised PSII is vulnerable to light induced damage leading to a short lifetime of the photoelectrode (only a few hundred minutes). Thus the direct integration of the PSII enzyme onto electrode surfaces seems to be not an appropriate approach to develop robust and efficient photoelectrodes for large scale water splitting application.
 Fig. 10  PSII photoanode engineering: by chemical attachment of PSII-His onto an exposed Ni2+ electrode (A), ref. 137; and by embedding PSII within a polymer matrix containing the Os-complex as electron mediator (B), ref. 138. 
5.2 Using synthetic molecular organometallic catalysts

5.2.1 A brief overview of molecular catalysts that mimic the O2-evolving centre of PSII. 
Noble metals or metal oxides, such as Pt, IrO2 and RuO2, are efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. For example, IrO2 colloidal particles catalyse water oxidation with a TOF of 40 s−1 in aqueous solution (pH 5.7) at room temperature.139 Photocatalytic systems were also constructed through several methodologies, such as coupling IrO2 NPs with a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye in suspension,140–142 a single Cr chromophore incorporated within a silica scaffold,143 Ru(bpy)3-sensitised TiO2 nanoparticles,144 or with a hematite photoanode.20 Most recently, 2 nm IrO2 nanocrystals, stabilised by succinic acid, demonstrated an ability to act as O2-evolving photocatalysts in an aqueous solution under UV or visible light irradiation without a photosensitiser.145 However, the limited availability and cost of noble metals restrict the market application of these photocatalysts for large scale solar fuel production. Developing highly efficient, robust and low-cost electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for water oxidation is critical in achieving a clean energy economy.
The structural resolution of the photosystem II (PSII) of the natural photosynthesis system has revealed the unique, complex structure of the CaMn4Ox cubane cluster of the O2-evolving centre (OEC).136,146,147 A multi-faceted team of inorganic chemists and organometallic chemists across many labs are designing OEC-inspired catalysts for O2 evolution. To date, numerous synthetic bio-mimetic compounds of the CaMn4Ox cluster have been developed, including tetranuclear Mn, MnCa and Co clusters, Ru mono- and dinuclear complexes, and Ir mononuclear complexes. The redox potential of metallic ion centres depends strongly on the ligand environment; therefore, engineering the ligand set is a powerful strategy to lower the overvoltage required for the catalytic water oxidation reaction and to enhance the catalytic rate. The advances in this field have been well-documented in these review papers.148–151 The latest advance has been recently achieved by Agapie and coworkers in successfully synthesising [Mn3CaO4]6+ cubane using a trinucleating ligand framework.152


5.2.2 Coupling molecular catalyst with dye to construct homogeneous photocatalyst. 
First attempts to engineer water oxidation photocatalysts consisted of a dye coupled to a sacrificial electron acceptor and a synthetic O2-evolving electrocatalyst in a homogeneous, three-component system. Dyes with an oxidation potential higher than +0.82 V are required to drive water oxidation in a solution at pH 7. Conventional [Ru(bpy)3]2+ or [Ir(bpy)3]2+ dyes are routinely used to harvest visible light and to generate the sufficient oxidising driving force (e.g., [Ru(III)(bpy)3]+) to activate the catalyst. The activated catalyst then extracts electrons from water to complete the redox cycle.
Sun and co-workers combined a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye, a [Ru(II)(2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-dicarboxylate)(4-picoline)2] electrocatalyst, and a [CoIII(NH3)5Cl]2+ electron acceptor in a phosphate buffer system (pH 7), creating a system that catalysed O2 evolution at a TOF as high as 550 h−1 under visible light irradiation.153 However, this system suffered from photodegradation of the Ru-dye and photodecomposition of the Ru catalyst, due to oxidation of the C–H bond in their picoline ligand. The lifetime of this system was estimated to be only 7 min.
Another strategy for combining dye and O2-evolving molecular catalyst was reported by Yagi and co-workers.154 They incorporated both the [MnMn] dinuclear manganese catalyst and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye within a mica support via cation exchange. By such a way, the reductive quenching of the excited dye by a [MnMn]-based catalyst was enhanced, thanks to the proximity of two components. However, the isolation of these reactive centres within a mica support limited the oxidative quenching by the dissolved S2O82−. Consequently, the efficiency of the mica/[MnMn]-catalyst/[Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst was limited. Only 3.4 TON was achieved after 17 h of visible light irradiation from this photocatalyst in acetate buffer (pH 6.2). Hence it was expected that a co-attachment of both dye and O2-evolving catalyst onto a TiO2 nanoparticle surface can help to solve this problem. Such a co-attachment allows for enhanced reductive quenching of excited dye by the catalyst thanks to the proximity of the two counterparts while the oxidative quenching is ensured by the TiO2 conduction band.


5.2.3 Integration of a molecular catalyst with a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode. 
Dismukes, Spiccia and co-workers encapsulated a hydrophobic tetranuclear manganese cluster [Mn4O4L6] catalyst, which partially mimics the CaMn4Ox cubane cluster of PSII, within a Nafion polymer matrix through simple ion exchange (Fig. 11A).155,156 Combining this [Mn]–Nafion hybrid with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye-sensitised TiO2 nanoparticles created a composite photoanode material. Using this [Mn]–Nafion/[Ru]–TiO2/FTO photoanode in an aqueous electrolyte at pH 6.5 produced a photocurrent on the order of 31 μA cm−1 (Faradic yield for O2 evolution: 10%; TOF of 47 ± 10 h−1) under white-light irradiation. However, this photocurrent's instability increased with irradiation time.
 Fig. 11  Immobilisation of bio-inspired O2-evolving catalysts onto sensitised-TiO2 to engineer hybrid photoanode materials: (A) Dismukes and Sun's photoelectrochemical cell, ref. 155–157; (B–D) Crabtree–Brudvig's designs, ref. 158–160. 
Inspired by this strategy, Sun and co-workers fabricated a [Ru]–Nafion/[Ru(bpy)3]2+–TiO2/FTO photoanode157 (Fig. 11A). This photoanode achieved a photocurrent on the order of 50 μA cm−1, comparable to that obtained for the Dismukes' photoanode. Light-driven water oxidation with a TOF of 27 h−1 was reported using this photoanode with 1 h of visible light irradiation. Overall photo-assisted water splitting required a bias of −0.325 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) when using this Ru-based photoanode with a Pt cathode in a photoelectrochemical cell.
Crabtree, Brudvig and co-workers reported an interesting way to directly attach a [MnMn]-dinuclear catalyst onto TiO2 nanoparticles via a robust chromophoric covalent linker (Fig. 11B)158 or a TiO–Mn coordination bond (Fig. 11C).159 Although the chromophoric linker absorbed visible light to generate enough driving force for the oxidation of the [MnIII,MnIV] catalyst to [MnIV,MnV], there was no photo-oxidation of water. However, water oxidation with the TiO2–Mn-coordinated linker was driven by the Ce4+ oxidant, but there was no photo-assisted water oxidation in this case either.
Dye and O2-evolving catalyst can be covalently co-grafted onto the TiO2 nanoparticle surface as demonstrated for a zinc porphyrin dye coupled to an iridium-based catalyst (Fig. 11D).160 A photoanode current density of 30 μA cm−2 was obtained for this photoanode by applying a 0.3 V external bias and irradiating with visible light. The water oxidation efficiency was not determined for this photoanode material.
However, a recent in-depth analysis of Dismukes–Spiccia's [Mn4]–Nafion/[Ru]–TiO2/FTO hybrid system using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the catalytically active species responsible for water oxidation was not the initial tetranuclear manganese cluster [Mn4O4L6] but was instead its decomposition product.161 The manganese cluster was found to decompose once it was incorporated within a Nafion membrane, generating a Mn(II) compound (type Mn(H2O)62+), which was then electro-oxidised into the Mn(III)/Mn(IV) oxide states responsible for water photo-oxidation. This finding raises questions concerning the nature of catalytic species in hybrid materials obtained by incorporation of Ru, Ir-based molecular O2 evolution catalysts within electrode supports, since RuO2 and IrO2 are outstanding electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Even for the Cp*-Ir based homogeneous O2-evolving catalysts, there is a possibility that, depending strongly on the chosen ligand set, electro-decomposition onto the electrode surface can occur resulting in an IrO2 electroactive film. Crabtree, Brudvig and co-workers found that [Cp*Ir(H2O)3] decomposed, producing an IrO2 film, while [Cp*It(pyr-CMe2O)X] did not decompose when pyr-CMe2O is 2-(2′-pyridyl)-2-propanolate and X is Hal or CF3SO3.162
At this stage of development, further work is needed to design stable molecular oxygen generating catalysts and establish appropriate grafting methodologies to immobilize these catalysts onto the electrode surface for investigation. In this context, employing all-inorganic catalysts which do not contain any organic ligands in their structure appears to be a good alternative for engineering a water oxidation photocatalyst, particularly when combined with an n-type robust semiconductor as the light harvesting agent. In the following sections, we discuss first the assembly of all-inorganic catalysts with conventional dyes in ‘solution dispersible’ photocatalytic systems. We will then end our discussion by focusing on photoanode engineering using an abundant O2-evolving catalyst and semiconductor.

5.3 Using robust all-inorganic water splitting catalysts
To overcome the problem of photo-oxidative degradation of organic ligands in synthetic organometallics O2-evolving catalysts, Bonchio and co-workers used oxidation-resistant polyoxometallate ligands to stabilise the Ru4O4 or Co4O4 cores of their catalyst.163 These all-inorganic catalysts were highly robust and as efficient for O2 evolving as bio-mimetic molecular catalysts containing organic ligands. Hill and co-workers used [(Ru4O4(OH)2(H2O)4)(γ-SiW10O36)2]10− as an O2-evolving catalyst in phosphate buffer, with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as the photosensitiser and S2O82− as the electron acceptor. They reported a visible light-driven water oxidation rate with an initial TOF of 288 h−1 and a TON of 3.5 × 102 TON, with an estimated quantum efficiency of up to 9%.164 This Ru4O4 polyoxometalate catalyst displayed 10–20-fold higher O2 photo-evolution rates than commercial RuO2 nanoparticles when assembled within the same homogeneous photocatalytic system. When the above [Ru4O4] catalyst was combined with a tetranuclear Ru(II) dendrimeric dye, it showed a superior visible light absorption efficiency in comparison to the conventional [Ru(bpy)3]2+ dye, as evidenced from the outstanding photon-to-oxygen quantum yield of 30%.165
Recently, Kurz and co-workers showed that inserting Ca2+ ions within the crystalline structure of MnOx enhanced its O2-evolution catalytic properties by a factor of 30.166 In-depth characterisation by X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the surprising structural similarity between this mineral catalyst, which is simply prepared from Mn2+ and Ca2+ precursors, with the structure of the CaMn4Ox cubane cluster of the O2-evolving catalytic centre of PSII.167 A system containing this mineral catalyst and [Ru(bpy)3]2+/[Co(NH3)5Cl]2+ was able to photo-oxidise water, even though the catalyst degraded under working conditions. This finding suggests that nature may have chosen a simple, thermodynamically feasible chemical way to optimise the catalytic conversion of water oxidation by constructing the O2 evolving centre before inserting this cubane cluster within a protein environment.
Frei and co-workers developed a promising way to fabricate robust, efficient, all-inorganic O2-evolving catalysts by encapsulating CoOx or MnOx nanoclusters inside microporous silica scaffolds.168–170 This heterogeneous catalyst generated visible light-induced water oxidation using a mild acid solution, with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as a photosensitiser and S2O82− as an electron acceptor. These photocatalytic systems were stable for several hours without significant loss of catalytic activity and displayed outstanding catalytic rates (TOF of 1140 s−1 for the Co3O4/Silica catalyst168 and up to 3330 s−1 for the MnOx/KIT-6 (ref. 169)). Silica mesoporous supports are thought to play a critical role in the catalytic efficiency of these hybrid materials because they create a stable dispersion of metal oxide nanoparticles, typically in a very small size of a few nm, and may also contribute to their stability under acidic photo-oxidative conditions. Recent finding suggested that, at least for MnOx nanoparticles, the catalytic activity of the oxide strongly depends on its surface area (thus nanoparticle size), while the crystal structure and morphology are ineffective.171 However, due to the electrical insulation properties of silica supports, metal oxide/silica hybrid catalytic materials cannot be adapted as photoanode materials for integration within photoelectrochemical cells for photo-assisted water splitting.
Simple treatment with Co2+ solution can result in an interesting photocatalytic enhancement for the cauliflower mesoporous Fe2O3 photoanode.25 A cathodic shift of 80 mV and an enhancement of photocurrent by a factor of 1.2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE were reported. However, the photo-electrochemical properties of the Fe2O3/Co2+ electrode were investigated in basic solution of pH 13.5, so it is possible that isolated Co(OH)2 clusters were formed on Fe2O3 nanoparticles surface. When Fe2O3 was irradiated, the generated hole which is a potent oxidant oxidizes this Co(OH)2 to higher oxidized cobalt species such as Co3O4 which act as O2-evolving electrocatalyst. Low Co2+ loading (surface concentration was estimated to be ∼1 to 2 × 10−8 mol cm−2) avoided the aggregation of Co(OH)2 and ensured in situ formation of small CoOx nanoclusters, which are dispersed as isolated sites within the Fe2O3 mesoporous support, perhaps similar to how they are isolated within the silica support in Frei's system.
The cobalt oxide-phosphate cluster, named CoPi, discovered by Nocera's group is another emergent O2-evoving catalyst that was largely used as co-catalyst in combination with an n-type semiconductor for engineering an effective photoanode for water oxidation. Advancement of this approach will be discussed in the following section.
5.4 Using Nocera's CoPi catalyst
In 2008, Kanan and Nocera discovered a robust electrocatalyst for water oxidation based on a cobalt phosphate system (CoPi). This self-assembling efficient catalytic O2-generating system worked with a moderate overvoltage requirement (410 mV), high TOFs (0.0007 s−1) and a neutral pH and even worked in salt water.172,173 The CoPi system showed a surprising similarity in structure to the cubane O2-evolving catalyst centre of PSII.174,175 The preparation of CoPi via anodic electrodeposition from Co2+ solution in KPi buffer172 or anodic oxidation of Co0 thin film176 is reproducible, scalable and manufacturable. CoPi is therefore appropriate for use as a photoanode co-catalyst for photoelectrochemical cells.
Steinmiller and Choi reported the first example of integrating this CoPi co-catalyst with ZnO, a wide band gap n-type semiconductor (Fig. 12A).177 Photo-assisted deposition of CoPi using Co2+ in phosphate solution (pH 7) as a precursor and generated hole from UV-light irradiated ZnO as the oxidising driving force resulted in a CoPi nanoparticles catalyst being homogeneously dispersed on the ZnO surface. The presence of the CoPi co-catalyst on semiconductor surfaces accelerated the use of light-generated holes for O2 evolution and decreased the electron–hole recombination, thereby enhancing the photocurrent and reducing the overpotential by 230 mV. Using the same principle, CoPi was homogeneously photo-deposited onto a mesostructured α-Fe2O3 photoanode.178 A small applied bias (0.1–0.4 V) was needed because the α-Fe2O3 conduction band is not a strong enough reducing agent to produce hydrogen. CoPi photo-assisted deposition displayed better catalytic efficiency than CoPi electrodeposition or Co2+ wet impregnation. A cathodic shift of 170 mV was observed for the photo-assisted deposition of CoPi, compared with a 100 mV shift for electrodeposited CoPi and an 80 mV shift for wet impregnated Co2+. The presence of the CoPi catalyst on α-Fe2O3 enhanced the photocurrent by 33% at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). The CoPi/α-Fe2O3 composite showed a higher photostability than IrO2/α-Fe2O3, probably due to less CoPi catalyst detachment from semiconductor surfaces.20 Electrodeposition of CoPi amorphous films onto WO3 semiconductor surfaces (band gap of 2.7 eV) improved the O2 evolution rate and suppressed the generation of peroxo species that cause photodeactivation of the photocatalyst.179
 Fig. 12  Photoanode engineering using a CoPi O2-evolving catalyst: (A) Photodeposited ZnO–CoPi, Choi's design, ref. 177 and (B) Nocera's photocatalytic device consisted of a triple n–p-silicon junction, CoPi O2-evolving catalyst and NiMoZn H2-evolving catalyst, ref. 110. 
Recently, the Nocera group reported the integration of CoPi with a single, double or triple n–p-junction silicon connected in series.110,180,181 In a typical single junction engineering, a 50 nm ITO protective barrier layer was deposited onto a silicon surface to protect this material under the highly oxidizing conditions of water splitting. A CoPi catalyst layer was then deposited on top of the ITO layer. The combination of CoPi and n–p-Si junction dramatically enhanced the photocurrent and lowered the overvoltage requirement for water oxidation. Without the Si junction, an applied anodic potential of 1.3 V vs. NHE is required for the CoPi-ITO electrode to maintain a current density of 1 mA cm−2 for water oxidation. Combining this CoPi–ITO with a single n–p-Si junction solar cell, that can generate a photovoltage of 0.5–0.7 V, lowered the applied voltage requirement to 0.8 V vs. NHE, being close to the Nernstian potential for water oxidation at this pH 7 buffer (0.82 V vs. NHE). The current-to-oxygen faradic yield was unity and moreover this system was stable for the long-run experiment (12 h). Upon connecting this system in series with a second silicon solar cell, the onset potential for water oxidation was further reduced by 0.5 V.181 An in series triple n–p-Si junction is expected to generate a photovoltage of 1.5–2.1 V and using this arrangement, Nocera's group reported a device that can split water under sunlight irradiation without any external bias requirement (Fig. 12B).110 This device contains all low-cost materials based on earth abundant elements: NiMoZn alloy as H2-evolving catalyst, CoPi as O2-evolving catalyst and silicon solar cell as light harvesting agent. This latest discovery is a major step towards the development of efficient, robust, low-cost and scalable photocatalysts and photocatalytic devices for water splitting to generate molecular hydrogen using solar energy. For the moment, even without optimization, Nocera's innovative device can operate under near neutral pH conditions (pH 9.2, 1 M potassium borate buffer solution), giving solar-to-fuel efficiencies of 2.5–4.7%. These efficiencies are quite comparable to that achieved for the Grätzel's tandem cell consisting of an α-Fe2O3 or WO3 photoanode and a Pt-decorated dye-sensitized TiO2 photocathode (4.5% solar-to-fuel efficiency).182 Optimisation is expected to achieve the 7.8% solar-to-fuel efficiency reported for the Rocheleau's device which combines a triple junction amorphous silicon-solar cell, a NiFexOy O2-evolving catalyst and a CoMo alloy H2-evolving catalyst.183 However, basic conditions are required (pH 14, 1 M KOH electrolyte solution) for functioning of Rocheleau's device due to associated corrosion issues.
6. Conclusions
In recent years significant advances have been made in constructing molecular electrocatalysts for water oxidation, hydrogen evolution, and CO2 reduction with the view of replicating the ability of natural photosynthesis to capture solar energy and store it in chemical bonds. To this end the synthetic molecular electrocatalysts have been functionally tethered to appropriate photosensitizers: dyes or semiconductors. However, many of these photocatalysts are not appropriate for long-time application, at least for this stage of development, due to photo-degradation of the synthetic molecular catalysts and/or their associated light harvesting systems. From our review of the field we conclude that all-inorganic catalysts coupled to appropriate semiconductors look more promising for use in photocatalytic hybrid systems. Important advancements have been achieved in integration of Nocera's CoPi catalyst with α-Fe2O3, a promising semiconductor for photoanode engineering. However, a tandem cell consisting of CoPi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode and an appropriate photocathode, preferably without noble metals, has yet to be reported. The recent results achieved by the Gray and Lewis groups at Caltech and Nocera at MIT are good examples of the progress being made towards the goal of engineering economically viable photocatalysts for large scale photoproduction of H2 from water. More effort is now needed to make similar progress with CO2 photoreduction.

Broader context
Exploiting renewable carbon-free energy sources such as solar energy is an attractive solution in response to satisfying present and future global energy demands, and to address environmental issues associated with the use of fossil fuels. Solar energy can be converted into chemical energy stored within highly energetic compounds such as hydrogen, methanol and methane (i.e. solar fuels) through the employment of appropriate robust and efficient photocatalysts. Such photocatalyst contains a light harvesting agent to capture sunlight and convert it into electrochemical potential needed to drive the chemical reactions required to produce solar fuels with the aid of appropriate electrocatalysts. In this review, we highlight progress in photocatalyst engineering involving the combination of a dye or semiconductor for light harvesting with a wide range of bio-, bio-mimetic or all-inorganic electrocatalysts. It was concluded that the hybridization of an all-inorganic electrocatalyst with a semiconductor is the most promising approach for engineering a robust system with sufficient turnover rates for solar fuels production.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic presentation of possible engineering processes of photocatalysts for water splitting. It consists of a light harvesting agent with appropriate band structure for overall water splitting into H2 and O2 and two electrocatalysts for water oxidation and proton reduction reactions (A). These two electrocatalysts can be separately loaded onto two different semiconductors that can drive only water oxidation or water reduction. External bias, from a solar cell, can be applied for this tandem configuration (B). Similar engineering can be applied for CO2 reduction photocatalysts.
