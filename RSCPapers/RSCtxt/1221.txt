    , Accepted 21st April 2022First published on 22nd April 2022AbstractThe performance of FAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been drastically improved with a photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7%, showing attractive application potential. To achieve higher efficiency and longer-term stability of PSCs, a large number of passivation methods are used to inhibit Pb and I defects of FAPbI3 films. In this study, we developed a facile method to suppress the residual PbI2 of perovskite films and the related defects efficiently by a two-step spin-coating process, which prominently improves the carrier lifetime of α-FAPbI3 films (from 459 ns to 1346 ns). In addition, the morphology and crystallization characteristics of the films were also significantly improved, and the grains grew up to 1 μm. The efficiency of FAPbI3-based PSCs fabricated by this method reached 22.64%.
1. Introduction
The power conversion efficiency of single-junction solar cells based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials has been up to 25.7%.1 It has been confirmed repeatedly that the crystallization characteristics of perovskite films are very important to obtain high-performance solar cells.2 To meet the conditions of controlling the crystallization process in perovskite films, one-step and two-step methods have been developed and both achieved high efficiency.7,8,24 Although these two methods can produce efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs), in the preparation process of efficient high-performance perovskite solar cells, the two-step method has been proved to have more obvious advantages.2–5 The two-step method can control the crystallization rate, overcome solvent incompatibility and has great flexibility. For example, each step of the two-step process can be individually optimized to promote better nucleation.6,15 Compared with the perovskite films prepared by one-step process, the perovskite films prepared by two-step process have higher coverage and better compactness, and exhibit high crystallinity, uniform film formation, high stability and high conversion efficiency.16
In 2020, Bing et al.6 used a two-step deposition method to improve the morphology and crystallization of perovskite films, reduce defects and obtain high-quality perovskite films with high PCE by forming PbI2 complexes or making perovskites transform better and grow more orderly via intermolecular exchange. Li et al.9 proposed a strategy to increase the average grain size by slowing down the reaction rate in a two-step method, and systematically reviewed the preparation of high-quality perovskite thin films by solvent-controlled crystallization. Du et al.10 confirmed that the crystallization and morphology of PbI2 are finely controlled, which modulates the crystallization and pore filling of perovskites in the mesoscopic structure by using different lead sources by a low-temperature, two-step sequential deposition method. However, there are some problems in the two-step method, the most important being the control of PbI2 film formation and the residue of PbI2 after the formation of perovskites, which will affect the performance and stability of perovskite films and devices.9† In order to overcome these problems, Chen et al.11 developed a simple, effective and easy two-step method to form high-quality perovskite films (with low PbI2 residue), that is, by doping CsAc to promote the reflection of PbI2 and organic amine salts; in addition, a moderate excess of PbI2 can passivate the defects and stabilize the structure of the perovskite film to yield smooth and less defective perovskite films. Bing et al.12 carried out XRD measurements in the spin-coating process to observe the (001) PbI2 peaks and found that the PbI2 contents were reduced, which may improve the quality and photoelectric properties of perovskite films, and may further improve the repeatability of the two-step method. Although these methods have achieved excellent results, challenges remain in the development of high-quality perovskite films, such as the suppression of residual PbI2 and the enhancement of crystallization of the as-prepared films.
In this work, we used the method of adding a small amount of MABr into a PbI2 precursor solution to control the crystallization of FAPbI3 films and suppress residual PbI2 efficiently. The defects related to residual PbI2 were inhibited dramatically and the carrier lifetime was extended significantly. The high-efficiency PSCs fabricated by this method exhibited an obvious improvement up to 22.64% compared with that of the control PSCs. This simple method can effectively improve the film morphology, enhance the efficiency of FA-based PSCs, and provide reliable experimental reference for fabricating efficient FA-based PSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Formamidinium iodide (FAI), 2,20,7,70-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,90-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), methylammonium chloride (MACl), and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Lead iodide (PbI2), and a SnO2 colloid precursor was bought from Alfa Aesar. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and isopropanol (IPA) were bought from Acros Oganics (extra dry).

Solution preparation. 
A SnO2 solution was prepared according to the method reported by Jiang; a SnO2 colloid precursor was diluted with deionized water in the volume ratio of 1:6.19 For the PbI2 solution, 1.5 M PbI2 was dissolved into a DMF/DMSO (600 mg/78 mg) solution, and for the FAI solution, 90 mg of FAI and 9 mg MACl were mixed into 1 ml IPA. These two solutions were stirred for 2 hours at room temperature in a glove box. To prepare different concentrations of MABr/PbI2 precursor solution (0–0.05 g ml−1), different weights of MABr were dissolved into the above-mentioned PbI2 precursor, and the MABr/PbI2 solution were stirred for 2 hours in a glove box. For the Spiro-OMeTAD precursor, 80 mg Spiro-OMeTAD powder was solved in 1 ml chlorobenzene, and then tertbutylpyridine (28.5 μl in 1 ml chlorobenzene), and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (8.75 mg ml−1) were added into the Spiro-OMeTAD solution as additives followed by stirring in a glove box for over 2 hours.

2.2. Device fabrication
FTO glasses (12 Ω sq−1) were ultrasonically cleaned several times with deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min, respectively. After drying, these cleaned substrates were treated with UV ozone for 20 min for use. To prepare the SnO2 films, 30 μl SnO2 precursor was spin-coated onto FTO substrates at 6000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 180 °C for 30 min in ambient air. After cooling down to the room temperature, these prepared SnO2 films were again treated with UV ozone for 20 min before being transferred into a N2-filled glove box. The perovskite films were fabricated by a two-step method. First, a PbI2 solution with different concentrations of MABr was spin-coated onto a SnO2 substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 70 °C for 1 min. After cooling to room temperature, the FAI solution (MACl 9 mg ml−1 in IPA) was spin-coated onto PbI2 films at 4000 rpm for 20 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min in a glove box. Then, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated onto perovskite films at 6000 rpm for 30 s for fabricating a hole transport layer. Finally, 100 nm Au was evaporated on the films as the electrode.
2.3. Characterization
Current–voltage curves were characterized using a source meter (Keithley 2400) under AM 1.5G irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator (XES-301S + EL-100) by forward (−0.1 V to 1.2 V) or reverse (1.2 V to −0.1 V) scans. The step voltage was fixed at 10 mV and the delay time was set at 5 ms. The chemical compositions of the films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer, Cu-Kα radiation λ = 0.15406 nm). The morphologies of the perovskite films were measured using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; HITACHI Regulus SU8100). The absorption of the films was characterized using a ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis). The roughness of the films was tested using an atomic force microscope (AFM). An Edinburg PLS 980 was employed for measuring the static and time-resolved PL spectra of the perovskite films. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on PSCs with the FTO/TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure using an electrochemical workstation (Germany, Zahner Company). The EQE of the devices was performed using a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (Model QEX10).
3. Results and discussion
To investigate the effect of doping MABr on the crystallization process of PbI2 and FAPbI3, the surface morphologies of the as-prepared films with different MABr concentrations are provided in Fig. S1a–S1p.† In order to more intuitively highlight the role of MABr, we selected representative SEM and atomic force microscopic (AFM) images for analysis. As shown in Fig. 1a, the PbI2 layer without MABr exhibits homogeneous fine particles with heterocysts; Fig. 1b exhibits the surface morphology of the corresponding FA-based perovskite film. From Fig. 1b, it can be observed that perovskite grains are disorderly distributed and porous, with small grain size (average 500 nm) and poor orientations. Subsequently, we continue to increase the concentration of MABr in PbI2 films (from 0.005 g to 0.05 g) and find that with the increase in MABr concentration, the grains of PbI2 films grow up and obvious pores appear. To examine whether MAPbI2Br is formed when the concentration of MABr is increased, we added more MABr in PbI2 films and XRD results show that there was a peak at 14.1°, as shown in Fig. S2,† giving us reasons to speculate that it might be MAPbI2Br.35 With the increase in the amount of MABr, the relative intensity of the MAPbI2Br peak enhances. Therefore, we believe that the incorporation of MABr will form MAPbI2Br, which may affect the crystalline process of perovskites. We will study this phenomenon further in our future work. These large PbI2 grains can provide larger reaction sites for the formation of FAPbI3 films, thus promoting the formation of FAPbI3 films. At the same time, these pores contribute to the reaction between the formamidine iodide (FAI) solution and PbI2, and therefore, the content of PbI2 in FAPbI3 thin films is suppressed. Amazingly, with the increase in MABr concentration, perovskite grains generally show a trend of increasing first and then decreasing, and the grain arrangement develops from disorder to uniformity on the whole; in the meantime, the film surface changes from porosity to compactness and flatness.

By comparison, we found that when the concentration of MABr is 0.03 g ml−1, the grain size of the PbI2 film is uniform (100 nm), and there are a lot of holes, which can provide a lot of paths for the penetration of the FAI solution and promote the reaction to form FAPbI3 films, as shown in Fig. 1c. Fig. 1d shows the corresponding perovskite film, we can see that the grain size of perovskite reaches 1 μm. The results indicate that the perovskite thin film has the best performance among all doping concentrations.
Furthermore, in order to characterize the roughness of as-prepared perovskite films, the topography and roughness images of pristine perovskite films and the perovskite film with 0.03 g MABr were revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 1e and f, the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of the perovskite film with MABr is about 22 nm (Fig. 1f), and that of pristine perovsktie is 31 nm (Fig. 1e). This phenomenon indicates that our method can promote the growth of grains and inhibit the surface roughness of the film, so that a more compact and smooth perovskite film can be obtained.
To reveal the crystalline properties of perovskite films with different concentrations of MABr, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed, as shown in Fig. 2a–d. The peak at 12.8° exhibited in the XRD patterns of perovskite films with different MABr concentrations corresponds to the PbI2 (001) crystal plane.13,33,34 In order to compare the crystallization of PbI2 and perovskites more clearly, we selected the diffraction peak of PbI2 at 12.8° (corresponding to the (001) plane) and that of the FAPbI3-based perovskite at 28.1° (corresponding to the (002) plane) and compared these peaks, respectively. It can be seen in Fig. 2b that the diffraction peaks of perovskite are obviously enhanced with the increase in MABr concentration from 0 to 0.05 g; in contrast, the PbI2-induced peaks are tremendously suppressed. This indicates that the doping of MABr into PbI2 can improve the crystallization of the as-prepared perovskite films and inhibit the residuals of unreacted PbI2. To exhibit this trend more clearly, we calculated the relative intensity of the main peaks of PbI2 and perovskites by dividing the value of peak intensity of PbI2 by that of the perovskite shown in Fig. 2c.12 It can be seen that with the increase in MABr concentration, the value of relative intensity decreases from 3.42 to 0.14, indicating that PbI2 is obviously inhibited during the preparation process. In addition, we further studied the position changes of perovskite diffraction peaks corresponding to the (110) plane. As shown in Fig. 2d, it is obvious that the diffraction peak of the (110) plane of perovskite moves upwards with the increase in MABr concentration. This is due to MA cations partly replacing the FA+ sites in the perovskite lattice structure, which could reduce the lattice parameters.13,14

In order to identify the reduction of lead iodide residue after adding MABr, we characterized the buried face of FAPbI3 films and identified the atom ratios of these films using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). As shown in Fig. 3a and b, it can be observed that after the addition of MABr, perovskite grains grew significantly and the film surface was compact and flat. We present details on the element distribution diagram of the FAPbI3 buried face without and with MABr in Fig. S3, ESI.† We also compared the N/Pb element content under a certain energy state range, as shown in Fig. 3c; it is prominent that the characteristic peak of the Pb element is distinctly reduced for the film with MABr compared with the film without MABr, which confirms that the specific value of Pb and N of the film with MABr is closer to the stoichiometry. This reveals that the addition of MABr can suppress the residue of PbI2 dramatically. The full spectra of the two above-mentioned samples are displayed in Fig. S4.† Furthermore, we exhibited the element content of FAPbI3 with and without MABr, as shown in Fig. 3d; it is clear that the ratio of N and Pb for the film with MABr is 6:1, whereas that for the film without MABr is close to 5:1. This is related to the fact that the addition of MABr can effectively inhibit the residue of PbI2 and reduce the PbI2-induced defects, as confirmed by Fig. 3c.

In order to investigate the luminescence properties of the samples, photoluminescence spectra (PL spectrum) of these films were recorded.18 As shown in Fig. S5,† with the increase in MABr concentration, the peak intensity increases first and then decreases, and the peak intensity for a doping concentration of 0.03 g ml−1 is the largest, which indicates that the sample has low non-radiative recombination and relatively few defects. At the same time, with the change in MABr concentration, the luminescence peak position of the sample changes from 805 nm to 780 nm, which is similar to that measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. S6.† In order to better compare the luminescence characteristics of these samples, we show the PL two-dimensional diagram, as shown in Fig. 4a. It can be seen that when the doping concentration is 0.03 g ml−1, the luminescence is the strongest, and the peak position exhibits a decreasing trend. Moreover, we carried out time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements to evaluate the charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 4b) for FAPbI3 and MABr–FAPbI3. The TRPL decay profiles were fitted using the exponential equation: I = I0 + I1e(−t/τ1) + I2e(−t/τ2)(1)and extracting the associated lifetimes τ1 and τ2. The τ1 decay component is related to non-radiative recombination from defects, and the τ2 component corresponds to the radiative recombination from the bulk perovskite.20,25 The FAPbI3 perovskite presented the characteristic PL lifetime τ1 of 52 ns and τ2 of 407 ns. The TRPL decays exhibited longer lifetimes and fewer dispersion tendency with τ1 of 153 ns and τ2 of 1193 ns for the MABr–FAPbI3 film. It is shown that the average lifetime increases from 459 ns (the FAPbI3 film) to 1346 ns (the MABr–FAPbI3 film), indicating that the defect density and defect-assisted recombination are greatly reduced in the Br-doped film,21,38–40 which is in good agreement with the steady-state PL measurements.

Furthermore, in order to investigate the absorption characteristics of as-prepared films, a ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer was utilized for revealing the effect of MABr concentration changes on the optical properties of these films.17 As shown in Fig. S6a,† it can be seen that with the increase in MABr concentration, these absorption profiles display an upward and then a downward tendency. For the film with 0.03 g ml−1 MABr, the profile intensity showed the highest absorption, indicating the better optical property. In addition, we computed the band gaps of these films, as shown in Fig. S6b.† With the increase in MABr concentration, the band gap values range from 1.51 eV to 1.55 eV, and the band gap corresponding to the doping concentration of 0.05 g ml−1 MABr (green line) is 1.55 eV. Moreover, we estimated the Urbach tail energy from the Tauc plot, as shown in Fig. S7.† The corresponding tail energy values are 12 and 9 meV for FAPbI3 without and with MABr, respectively. The highest tail energy can be considered to have a high density of defects, which indicates that PbI2-induced defects are obviously inhibited in the FAPbI3 films with MABr.22,23
We fabricated FAPbI3 thin films into PSC devices with the planar configuration of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. By adjusting the concentration of MABr, we found that the device efficiency increases first and then decreases; meanwhile, the Voc value increased from 1.12 V to 1.15 V, which may be related to the reduction of internal defects in the films, as shown in Table S1.† Among them, Table 1 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and photovoltaic parameters of FAPbI3 and MABr–FAPbI3, in which the FAPbI3-based device measured with a reverse scan shows a PCE of 20.05% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.95 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.12 V, and a FF of 74.95%. In contrast, the MABr–FAPbI3-based device exhibited a JSC of 25.30 mA cm−2, a VOC value of 1.15 V, a FF of 77.83%, and a PCE of 22.64% under the same measuring condition, which is shown in Fig. 5a. It demonstrates that the additional MABr could improve the hysteresis characterization of the as-prepared PSCs. We can see that the efficiency improvement is mainly due to the FF, which is related to the fact that the addition of MABr can effectively inhibit the residue of PbI2 and reduce the PbI2-induced defects, as confirmed by PL spectra. At the same time, we draw the statistical charts as shown in Fig. S8† and study the reproducibility of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE separately. It was found that the device doped with 0.03 MABr has a significant advantage over the device without doping, and the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, filling factor and the device efficiency distribution are all more concentrated. As shown in Fig. S8a,†Jsc of the device without doping MABr is 23.7%, whereas Jsc of the device doped with 0.03 concentration is 24.7%. As shown in Fig. S8b,†Voc of the device without doping MABr is 1.10 V, whereas Voc of the device doped with 0.03 concentration is 1.14 V. As shown in Fig. S8c,† the FF of the device without doping MABr is 72.64%, whereas the FF of the device doped with 0.03 concentration is 77.01%. In addition, the average efficiency of the device without doping MABr is 19.3%, whereas the average efficiency of the device doped with 0.03 concentration is 21.8%, as shown in Fig. S8d.† These are related to the fact that the addition of MABr can effectively inhibit the residue of PbI2 and reduce the PbI2-induced defects. These figures show that the addition of 0.03 g ml−1 MABr is conducive to the preparation of high-efficiency FAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells, which is helpful to launch the efficiency of the cells.26,27

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further performed to investigate the charge carrier recombination mechanism of the devices based on MABr-modified FAPbI3 and pristine FAPbI3 devices. Fig. 5b shows the Nyquist plots of the devices using different ETLs measured at an open-circuit voltage in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 Hz under one sun illumination, with the equivalent circuit and the corresponding fitting results presented in Table S2.† In the EIS analysis, high-frequency component is characteristic of transfer resistance (Rtr), while low-frequency component is characteristic of recombination resistance (Rrec).31,39 The Rtr is associated with the pristine FAPbI3–perovskite or the MABr-modified FAPbI3–perovskite interface since the perovskite–ETL interface is identical in both cases. For the device based on MABr-modified FAPbI3, the Rtr decreased from 58.28 Q to 9.8 Q, and the Rrec increased from 49.4 Q to 58.3 Q, indicating that carrier extraction was enhanced, and carrier recombination was restrained.
The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the pristine and MABr-containing devices are displayed in Fig. S9c (ESI†).11,31 It can be observed that the external quantum efficiency in the 400–800 nm range is higher in the MABr-containing device. The photocurrent densities obtained from the IPCE spectra of pristine and MABr-containing devices was 23.53 and 24.89 mA cm−2, respectively, which is in good agreement with the JSC values obtained in J–V curves.28 In order to determine the device performance, we conducted a stability test at 80 °C in ambient air (relatively humidity of 60) for 1000 seconds, as shown in Fig. S10.† It was found that the PCE of the device doped with MABr remains at about 80%, whereas the non-doped device has been attenuated to 60% under the same aging condition of 1000 seconds, which shows that MABr can improve the stability of the device as shown in Fig. S9d.† It can be seen that the stability of the device increases with the addition of MABr. Fig. 5d shows that the VOC value is dependent on the steady-state light intensity (I) in the investigation of the charge carrier recombination in PSCs. According to the linear fitting and calculation, the slope (S) of VOCversus ln(I/I0) for the MABr–FAPbI3 device is 1.26kBT/q, where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature and q is the elementary charge, while 1.74kBT/q of slope was achieved for the FAPbI3 device. The decreased ideality factor indicates the reduced non-radiative recombination losses of the MABr–FAPbI3 film. The larger the deviation of S from 1, the more the defect-induced recombination.29,30 Moreover, we remade the FAPbI3 thin films into PSC devices with the planar configuration of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au to test the trap density. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was used to evaluate the trap density for the FAPbI3 and MABr–FAPbI3 perovskite-based “electron only device”, as shown in Fig. 5c. The density of trap state of the perovskite film (Ntrap) was calculated by measuring the trap-filling limited voltage (VTFL), according to the equation Ntrap = VTFL·2εε0/ed2, where ε, ε0, e, and d are the dielectric constant (46.9), vacuum permittivity (8.8542 × 10−14 F cm−1), electric charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), and thickness of the perovskite film (500 nm) determined from the SEM image shown in Fig. 1(b), respectively. VTFL was obtained by fitting the dark I–V data in the above-mentioned equation. The measured VTFL with the standard deviation were 0.35 V and 0.40 V for MABr–FAPbI3 and FAPbI3, respectively. The calculated values (average and standard deviation) of Ntrap are 7.3 × 1015 and 8.3 × 1015 cm−3 for MABr–FAPbI3 and FAPbI3, respectively.32,36,37 The SCLC results indicated that MABr–FAPbI3-based devices have a lower trap density than that of FAPbI3-based PSCs, indicating a much superior effect on the performance of the device. To sum up, the improvement of stability is due to the addition of MABr, which improves the crystallization process of the perovskite, reduces defects and enhances the carrier transmission in the device.
4. Conclusion
In summary, a facile method of adding MABr into a PbI2 precursor has been revealed to inhibit residual PbI2 during the fabrication process of FAPbI3 films. These as-prepared PbI2 films showed large grain size and uniform pore distribution. This effectively promoted the reaction between the FAI solution and PbI2 films, and then regulated the morphology and crystallization of sequentially produced FAPbI3 films. By this method, high-quality and smooth FAPbI3 films with a grain size over 1 μm could be prepared expediently, and residual PbI2 in the films is suppressed dramatically. We selected the best two devices for related performance characterization and found that the composite resistance increased by about 38.3%, while the defect density of states decreased by 12.3%. The device equipped with the optimized FAPbI3 film exhibits a higher performance, with the best PCE of 22.64%. This work provides a reliable way to suppress PbI2-induced defects and further improve the morphology of FAPbI3-based films and promote the performance of FAPbI3-based PSCs.
