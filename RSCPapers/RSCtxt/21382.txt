Broader context
Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFC) are leading-edge targets for what concerns the diversification of the power sources required by the current environmental politics. These devices find potential application in the next generation of hybrid or fully electric auto-vehicles and in the storage and conversion device for hydrogen, produced by a solar cell through a photo-catalysed water splitting process. The polymer membrane does determine the attainable power density and the cell durability. In the recent past, Nafion has been the reference target in the optimization process of the electrolyte. However, it does not seem to fit the energetic needs for the automotive compartment. Inside the wide spectrum of alternatives proposed during these past years, acid-doped polybenzimidazole membranes seem to be particularly promising due to the high proton conductivity (>0.1 S cm−1) above 160 °C, even in the absence of humidity. However, some questions are still open: under which operating conditions (chiefly temperature) are the acid-doped PBI systems a real alternative to Nafion? What is the real durability of the PBI cells/stacks? In this perspective we aim to address the state of the art and the most recent developments which could make polybenzimidazole systems the choice for the future high temperature PEMFCs.

A Introduction
Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFC) are leading-edge targets for what concerns the diversification of the power sources required by the current environmental politics. After many years of development, they actually may be considered the key technology for the next generation hydrogen-powered vehicles. However, the large scale-up of polymer fuel cells is still limited by their incompatibility with the operating conditions of the automotive applications, namely working temperatures higher than 130 °C and low humidification. The reasons to work at higher temperature are well-known [see, for example, ref. 1 and 2]. First of all, CO poisoning of the catalyst remarkably decreases above 120 °C. The rates of diffusion and H2/O2 reactions do improve at higher temperature. Furthermore, PEMFCs working above 130 °C are preferable from the point of view of water and heat management.
The most investigated polymers for use as the electrolyte in polymer fuel cells are perfluorosulfonic acid membranes such as Nafion™, which for many years has been the reference target of the market. Both advantages and disadvantages of Nafion are well-known: it is a very chemically stable polymer, in particular towards the oxidising species coming from the H2/O2 reaction. Furthermore, its proton conductivity is very high, but only up to 100 °C and at high humidity level. At higher temperatures it starts to degrade. Recently, a perfluorinated membrane has been proposed which partially overcomes the Nafion™ drawbacks.3
As previously stated, the stringent requirements of the automotive market push the research towards membranes able to work in dry conditions and in the temperature range 120–200 °C.1,4 In spite of the wide spectrum of investigated systems, only three types of membranes may be actually considered for a future industrial scale-up: (i) nanocomposite membranes, based on modified Nafion™ (or similar perfluorosulfonic monomers) and sulfonated aromatic polymers; (ii) hybrid systems based on proton conducting ionic liquids (PCIL); and (iii) acid–base membranes.
(i) The modification of Nafion™ and Nafion™-like membranes points to improve water retention and absorption in order to keep high the hydration degree and, consequently, to avoid conductivity drops above 100 °C. To this aim, the dispersion of properly designed fillers into the polymer matrix seems to be an encouraging approach.4 The positive effects of inorganic particles in the transport and mechanical properties of the polymer electrolytes were widely proved in the case of lithium-based systems.5 In the proton conducting membranes, besides the proton conductivity, the filler affects the water uptake, the mechanical and thermal stability, and the methanol permeability.6 For these reasons, a wide variety of inorganic fillers were dispersed in Nafion™-based membranes as well as in sulfonated aromatic polymers such as poly(ether ether ketones) (SPEEKs). Two types of fillers were chiefly investigated: (i) inert hygroscopic oxides, like SiO2, laponites, zeolites, montmorillonites, TiO2, and Al2O3; (ii) proton conducting oxides, such as heteropolyacids (SiWA, PWA, PMoA) or Zr-based oxides and salts, in particular phosphates, which increase the acid sites hence providing additional paths for the proton transport.7 At the basic level, the membrane proton conductivity and the MEA power density are improved by the inorganic phase, due to the presence of acid–base interactions between polymer and filler, as proved by FTIR analyses.8–10 Such interactions are stronger in the presence of an extended polymer/filler interface, which is generally obtained through a homogeneous dispersion of particles with higher surface area.11–13 The MOx-based fillers improve the water uptake and retention and decrease the humidification requirements. To this aim, nanosized and/or mesoporous hierarchical structures are preferred,14 as well as nanochannel-like structures, like TiO2 nanotubes.15 Further improvements have been also observed by means of filler functionalization processes with protogenic groups, like sulfonic, phosphotungstic or phosphoric ones.14,16
In the case of solid acid membranes, the incorporation of layered zirconium phosphate or phosphonates still seems to be a promising approach, because these materials are good proton conductors with high chemical and thermal stability.2 In the case of phosphate systems, the conductivity may reach values of the order of 10−2 S cm−1 and even 10−1 S cm−1 if the filler is properly functionalised.2,17 Alberti and coworkers deeply investigated these types of nanocomposites as electrolytes for fuel cells, showing how the Zr-based fillers may improve the Nafion mechanical properties as well as the fuel cell performances at temperatures higher than 100 °C.18,19 An important effect on the reduction of methanol cross-over was also observed, making these systems interesting even in the case of direct methanol (DM) FCs. A great deal of attention was devoted to both the role of the filler and the preparation procedures in the electrochemical properties of the membrane. New strategies for the production of nanocomposites were proposed, like, for instance, (1) in situ formation of the inorganic particles, or (2) filling of the nanoporous polymer membranes.17
(ii) Nowadays, a great deal of attention is devoted to the use of protic ionic liquids (PILs) as possible media to replace water in Nafion™-based electrolytes for high temperature PEMFCs.20 This interest is motivated by the unique properties of the ionic liquids and by the successful applications obtained in the field of lithium batteries.21–24 ILs show several advantages, namely low volatility, thermal stability, safety, high conductivity and wide operating temperature ranges. Besides, they work above 80 °C under dry conditions, with proton conductivity exceeding 10 mS cm−1.20 The most investigated PILs are ammonium salts, such as triethylammonium-based systems with different anions, e.g. methane sulfonates or triflate.20 However, some studies revealed that promising improvements in the fuel cell efficiency may be reached even in the presence of imidazolinium-based ionic liquids.25 These liquids have been dispersed in Nafion™ and PVDF with weight loadings up to 80%. The resulting hybrid membranes at 130 °C showed high proton conductivity, very close to the one observed for fully hydrated Nafion™, at 80 °C and RH > 90%.26,27 However, the proper design of PIL is a key factor in the improvement of the fuel cell performances. In fact, the nature of both cation and anion affects the cell open circuit voltage (OCV), as well as the HOR and ORR activities.20 Recently, hybrid inorganic–organic nanocomposites were also studied, aiming to improve the membrane mechanical stability and the hydrogen permeability and to further improve the proton conductivity. In the particular case of SiO2-based ionogels, filled with amounts of silica in the range of 0–15 wt%, interactions between the hydrophilic domains were observed which results in the formation of micelle-like nanoparticles where the silica core is covered by a shell of solvating IL molecules.28,29
(iii) The acid–base membranes are typically composed of a polymer including basic sites, like ether, alcohol, amine, and imide groups, doped with an inorganic acid or blended with an acid polymer.30 The basic polymer behaves like a proton acceptor, forming an ion-pair. Proton conductivity of the order of 1 mS cm−1 is generally obtained at room temperature by using amphoteric species, like phosphoric or phosphonic acids. These species are particularly effective because they form a hydrogen-bond based backbone made of both proton and acceptor groups which favour the proton transport. The polymers generally used to this aim are polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylenimines (PEI), and homo- and copolymers based on aromatic polyethers, eventually functionalised with pyridine units. The latter systems were also grafted with diphosphonates and/or diphosphonic groups in order to control the possible leaching of the doping acid.31 Among the possible acid/base combinations, however, the most promising ones are indeed the H3PO4-doped polybenzimidazole membranes, which show good thermal and mechanical stability and very high proton conductivity at temperatures above 160 °C, even in the absence of humidity.3,32 The measure of this interest is given by the growing number of companies involved in commercializing PBI-based products.33,34
Provided that PBI is the best-suited candidate as the electrolyte for HT-PEMFCs, some relevant questions are still open: under which operating conditions (chiefly temperature) are the acid-doped PBI systems a real alternative to Nafion? What is the real durability of the PBI cells/stacks? In this perspective we aim to address the state of the art and the most recent developments, which could make polybenzimidazole systems the market choice for HT-PEMFCs.
B Monomer modifications and polymer synthesis
Polybenzimidazoles are heterocyclic, thermoplastic, basic polymers characterized by at least one aromatic unit, which confers high mechanical and thermal stability (Tg > 400 °C). The most investigated basic units of this class of polymers are 2,5-polybenzimidazole and poly[2,2′-m-(phenylene)-5,5′-bibenzimidazole] (herein labelled as ABPBI and PBI_4N respectively). These macromolecules were synthesized for the first time in 1961 by Vogel and Marvel.35 Basically, the synthetic procedure is based on a thermal polycondensation reaction at temperature near 180–200 °C between amino-groups and carboxylic units, using polyphosphoric acid (PPA) as the polymerization agent. In the particular case of ABPBI, the process is the self-condensation of a diaminobenzoic acid, whereas the PBI_4N is formed through the reaction of a diaminobenzidine with isophthalic acid (see Scheme 1a and b, respectively).
 Scheme 1  Thermal polymerization of 2,5-polybenzimidazole (a) and poly[2,2′-m-(phenylene)-5,5′-bibenzimidazole] (b). 
Generally speaking, the PBI syntheses are quite simple to perform and polymers with different polymerization degrees may be produced. The average molecular weight of the PBI-based polymers is not determined by the standard gel permeation chromatography techniques, because these products are completely insoluble in a large number of solvents. In contrast, it is commonly obtained by means of inherent viscosity measurements, performed on polymer solutions in sulfuric acid, through the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada equation:[η] = K′(Mw)ahere Mw is the polymer average molecular weight, which is related to the polymerization degree, DP, through the relationship DP = MWpol/MWmon. K′ and a are the Mark–Houwink phenomenological constants whose values are equal to 1.94 × 10−4 and 0.791, respectively, for PBI, and to 8.7 × 10−3 and 1.10 for ABPBI. These values can be taken as rough references for other polymers whose constants are not reported in literature.
In order to avoid insoluble residues, polymers with inherent viscosity ranging between 0.5 and 1 dl g−1 are usually synthesised, which means average Mws of 23000–40000 g mol−1. However, in the case of use as electrolytes for fuel cells, PBIs with higher molecular weights are preferred in order to obtain membranes with good free-standing properties.
In addition to the more conventional poly-condensation in PPA, other syntheses have been proposed in the literature, e.g. by using novel preparation media containing methane-sulfonic acid and P2O5.36 Recently, in our laboratory we synthesized a series of PBIs via a microwave-assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) approach.37 The use of MAOS allowed us to produce polymers with similar or even higher inherent viscosity in shorter times and with larger yields with respect to the standard thermal methods.38 In the case of ABPBI, for instance, thermal poly-condensation gives polymers with inherent viscosity higher than 3 dl g−1 after 5 h of reaction. In contrast, with MAOS a similar polymerization degree was obtained in 45 minutes. Even better results have been reached for poly[2,2′-m-(phenylene)-5,5′-bibenzimidazole], which displays a slower polymerization kinetics than ABPBI. In this case, MAOS produces in 2 hours polymers with longer chains (η = 0.68 dl g−1) than those obtained after 5 hours of thermal polymerization (η = 0.42 dl g−1).
By changing the chemical nature of the starting monomers, it is relatively easy to modify the polymer backbone in order to modulate its physicochemical properties, including thermo-oxidative stability, mechanical performances, methanol permeability, polymer solubility, and film processing behaviour. To this aim, several new systems have been recently proposed, including groups based on ketone, ether, sulfone, and fluoroalkyl units.2,32 PBIs have been also cross-linked in order to improve the mechanical strength of the acid-doped membranes. Several types of crosslinking processes have been tested, including covalent, ionic and mixed ionic–covalent. However, if the membrane toughness increases, the polymer solubility in the conventional casting solvents decreases as well.
Recently, polybenzimidazoles with a properly tailored basicity were synthesised with the aim to increase the acid–base interactions between the polymer and the doping acid (e.g. H3PO4), in order to reduce the acid leaching, and to favour the proton transport.39Table 1 reports a series of new polymers developed in our lab and tested in proton exchange membranes for fuel cells.

In this series the number of nitrogen atoms, as well as their interspacing along the polymer backbone, have been modulated by using a number of monomers, including naphtylidene-, pyridine-, bi-pyridine and pyrazole units. We showed how both the acid doping level and retention and the proton conductivity increase with the polymer molecular weight and basicity. Table 2 shows the inherent viscosity and the polymerization degree of the polymers. The polymerization time and temperature were the same for all the polymers. From the analysis of the data reported in Table 2 we stress the following points: (i) the increase of the monomer molecular weight reduces the condensation rate; (ii) the enhanced basicity provided by the presence of extra N-atoms in the PBI backbone (see, for example, PBI_5N) determines an increase of the DP for equal condensation times, probably because of the improved solubility in PPA of the monomer. All these aspects will also reflect on the phosphoric acid uptake and leaching and on the proton transport, as we will see in detail in the following sections.

A recent interesting novelty in the PBI design for fuel cells applications is the synthesis of arylether-polybenzimidazoles. It was shown that the introduction of ether groups in the polymer backbone: (i) improves both mechanical and chemical stability, (ii) reduces the polymer crystallinity and (iii) increases the chains flexibility. Furthermore, it enhances the polymer solubility in polar solvents, so improving the membrane and MEA workability.32 Several oxy-based PBIs were synthesised by changing the oxygen atom position along the chain, as in the case of poly-diphenylether-5-oxybenzimidazole (generally labelled as PBI-OO)40,41 or oxybenzimidazole (PBI-O),42 by adding hydroxyl units (PBI-2OH),43 or by preparing ether/pyridine-based mixed systems (Py-O-PBI).44 Due to the electron-donor properties of the ether bridges, the oxy-PBI may be easily sulfonated by means of mild synthetic routes.32,40,45 The presence of protogenic groups, like SO3H, does confer higher proton conductivity with respect the non-sulfonated PBI doped with the same content of H3PO4. In the particular case of PBI-OO, for instance, four aromatic rings per monomer unit are available for sulfonation and conductivity values up to 80 mS cm−1 were obtained at 120 °C and high humidity.40 We recently reported the synthesis and characterization of new arylether-based PBIs, namely poly-1,4-bis-(4-(1H,1′H-2,5′-bibenzo[d]imidazol-2′-yl)phenoxy)benzene and poly-2′,2′′-(4,4′-oxybis(4,1-phenylene))bis(1H,1′H-2,5′-bibenzo[d]imidazole), presented in Scheme 2a and b and labelled as PBI-108 and PBI-109, respectively.46 The polymers differ in the number of the ether-based spacers, one in the case of PBI-108, and two for PBI-109. We showed that the monomer structure does not remarkably affect the electrochemical properties of the membranes. However, an improvement in the polymer chemical stability in the presence of oxy- and hydroxyl free radicals is clearly observed in the case of the PBI-109 membrane with respect the oxygen-free PBI systems.

C Membrane preparation and acid leaching tests
In general, PBI membranes are obtained by standard casting of polymer solutions onto Petri dishes. PBIs may be dissolved in organic acids, like trifluoroacetic and methanesulfonic acid, in bases like dimethylacetamide, or in ethanol/NaOH mixtures. Basically, the casting solvent affects the crystallinity and the mechanical properties of the membranes. Films cast from TFA, for instance, are more crystalline, and display higher proton conductivity, than those ones obtained from DMAc. In some cases, the nature of the starting monomer as well as a too high polymer inherent viscosity may remarkably influence the polymer solubility. An alternative film forming procedure was recently proposed by Benicewicz et al., who reported the direct casting of the polyphosphoric acid (PPA) polymerization solution, with a consequent in situ doping process at room temperature and relative humidity around 40%. The resulting membranes achieved a very large phosphoric acid uptake.47
PBI is a basic and hydrophilic polymer (pKa ≈ 4.5), which may be doped by several strong inorganic acids, such as HClO4, H2SO4, HBr, HNO3 and H3PO4. However, only phosphoric acid has been deeply investigated as dopant due to its good proton conductivity and thermal stability. Some organophosphonic acids have been also tested in order to enhance the acid retention capability of the PBI membranes [see for example ref. 32 and references therein indicated]. The doping level, n, which is generally expressed in terms of acid molecules per monomer unit, is a key parameter for the proton transport. The higher the acid content of the membrane is, the higher its proton conductivity will be (see next section). In the case of poly[2,2′-m-(phenylene)-5,5′-bibenzimidazole], doping levels up to n = 6 are easily obtained at room temperature, after at least 50 hours of membrane immersion in acid aqueous solutions (e.g. 75 wt% in the case of H3PO4).
The doping mechanism has been widely discussed by Bouchet and Siebert48 and Li et al.,49 by means of spectroscopic measurements and calculations of the dissociation/protonation constants. PBI_4N contains two N-based sites with different basicity (–N–, and –NH–). The two more basic nitrogen sites of the monomer unit are firstly protonated by the acid and a doping level n = 2 is attained (the so-called bonded acid). In the case of doping levels n > 2 the excess of acid is in the non-dissociated form, in equilibrium with the ionic species.
As already stressed, one of the major drawbacks of PBI membranes is related to the leaching of the free phosphoric acid during the fuel cell operation. By means of elution tests it has been demonstrated that, in the case of the standard PBI_4N, the amount of retained acid gives a residual doping nr ≅ 2, leading to a four orders-of-magnitude decrease of the conductivity with respect to the as-prepared samples. In order to overcome such a limiting factor, we recently proposed two strategies: (i) the modification of the starting monomer structure;50,51 and (ii) the preparation of composite membranes by adding properly tailored fillers.52,53Table 2 reports the acid doping levels, n and nr, calculated for some novel PBI-based membranes obtained from different monomers with 4 ≤ N ≤ 6. Both n and nr are a complex function of the polymer basicity, which is correlated to the number of additional basic N-groups in the standard PBI backbone as well as of the increase of the monomer molecular weight. These parameters further improve the affinity to the acid, so allowing an acid uptake and retention higher than that observed in the case of PBI_4N. Similar effects seem to take place by increasing the N-group interspacing in the polymer network. The highest acid affinity of the as-prepared membranes is provided by the PBI_5N_2,5 sample which displays n = 9.5. Following the elution test, promising results are obtained in the case of PBI_5N_2,6, which shows a residual doping level nr = 4.5.50,51
Remarkable improvements in the reduction of the acid leaching have been achieved by adding properly designed silica-based fillers. Fig. 1 shows the H3PO4 uptake vs. the content of silica functionalized by imidazole-based units (SiO2_Im, see Scheme 3) for some PBI_4N composite membranes, both as prepared and after the forced leaching.

 Fig. 1  Acid uptake of the composite membranes vs. the imidazole-based filler content, both for the as-prepared samples and after the leaching. Redrawn from ref. 52. 
Free standing, mechanically strong membranes could be prepared even in the presence of high filler loadings (up to 50 wt%). This has been possible likely because of the chemical affinity of the filler with the polymer. The effect of the filler is twofold: on one hand, it increases the retention capability of the membrane as prepared, and on the other hand, it allows the membrane to retain a larger quantity of acid (up to three times more) in the presence of liquid water. Moreover, even relatively small amounts of the filler (∼5 wt%) do reduce the acid leaching out of the membrane by more than a factor of two. This point, together with the wide filmability range, is a further advantage since it allows designing of the membrane by privileging other technical aspects, such as the mechanical properties. In the case of the membrane with 50 wt% of filler, the H3PO4 uptake after washing is 200% higher than that of the pure PBI membrane.52 Similar positive effects have been also observed for pyridine-based PBI composite membranes. In the case of PBI_5N films, the introduction of SBA-15 mesoporous silica led to higher residual acid content, although in a less efficient way than SiO2_Im.53 The preparation of composite systems to reduce the acid leaching and the consequent conductivity drop is particularly appealing, since the filler plays other different positive key roles. For instance, the addition of 2 wt% nanosized silica (HiSil™) to PBI_4N determined an order-of-magnitude decrease of the methanol permeability. These minima of permeation may be interpreted in terms of lower probability of particle aggregation in the case of small filler contents, and of a consequent better dispersion which improves the capability of the membrane to hinder the methanol crossover (ref. 54 and references therein indicated).
To this aim, nanoscaled fillers based on Al- and/or Zr oxides may be an interesting alternative to explore in the optimization process of PBI based HT-PEMFCs.
D Conductivity properties and models for ion transport
The proton conductivity of acid-doped PBI membranes is dependent on temperature, relative humidity and acid doping level, which, in turn, depend on the molar concentration of the doping solution.55,56Fig. 2 reports the conductivity behaviour vs. acid concentration at 80 °C and 50% RH. Several mechanisms for proton transport were proposed in the past:
 Fig. 2  Plot of the proton conductivity at 80 °C and RH = 50% vs. the doping level, n, before acid leaching. The dotted and dashed lines indicate the maximum degree of protonation of standard PBI (PBI_4N) and the conductivity of the H3PO4 solution respectively. Full circles: data from ref. 48. Open circles: data from ref. 50. 
(1) direct hopping along the nitrogen sites of the PBI chains. This term is relevant only for non-doped PBI;
(2) hopping from the N–H sites to the phosphoric acid anions. This contribution is likely to be relevant for n < 2. Conductivity values as high as 10−2 Ω−1 cm−1 at 200 °C were obtained;
(3) hopping along the phosphoric acid anions (n > 2). This term is associated to the presence of free acid, and can contribute a several orders of magnitude increase of the conductivity (see Fig. 2);
(4) hopping via water molecules. This term, which is concurrent with the previous one, is more significant at high temperature. Increases from 0.03 to 0.07 Ω−1 cm−1 have been reported at 200 °C from 0.15 to 0.5% RH.
The prevalent hopping-like nature of the transport mechanism seems to be demonstrated by the quasi-Arrhenius behaviour of the conductivity.50 The activation energies for n > 2 are in the range 15–25 kJ mol−1, i.e. very near to that of concentrated H3PO4 aqueous solutions. However, the issue of the transport mechanism is far to be fully addressed. By means of careful broadband electric spectroscopy measurements we recently demonstrated that acid-doped PBI_5N membranes exhibit a Vogel–Tamman–Fulcher (VTF) type proton conduction mechanism, where proton hopping is coupled with the segmental motion of the polymer chains.57
As already stressed in the previous section, a strong decrease of the conductivity levels is associated with the leaching of the free phosphoric acid, which may take place during the fuel cell operation. In the case of PBI_5N_2,6, which shows a residual doping level nr = 4.5, a permanent conductivity of 2 × 10−4 Ω−1 cm−1 has been obtained at 120 °C and 50% RH, and the activation energy for proton conduction changed from 0.31 eV (before leaching) to 0.42 eV.50,51 The acid leaching can be also reduced by increasing the membrane thickness and/or by changing the preparation method. Benicewicz reported PA losses of the order of few nanograms per cm per hour in sol–gel prepared PBI membranes.58 This point will be further addressed in the last section.
Inert fillers can also improve the conductivity of the as-prepared membranes. We showed that the addition of limited amounts (5 wt%) of nanosized silica (HiSil™) causes the conductivity of PBI_4N membranes to increase by more than one order of magnitude.59 Such conductivity increase has been interpreted in terms of favoured paths for the proton hopping due to the presence of surface hydroxyl groups of HiSil™. Greater quantities of filler lead to a conductivity decrease (dilution effect) as commonly reported for polymer electrolytes.21 At higher contents, in fact, all the fillers act as a physical barrier for the H+ migration. However, problems are opened regarding the stability of these composite membranes, since nanosized SiO2 could be dissolved by phosphoric acid.60 We used sol–gel silica microparticles functionalized with imidazole groups.52 This filler, which can be considered as an active one, does allow to increase the permanent conductivity of PBI_4N by a factor of ∼103 with respect to the unfilled membrane, so reaching 10−3 Ω−1 cm−1 at 120 °C and 50% RH. Fig. 3 reports the conductivity behaviour vs. the filler content. There is no dilution effect because of the active nature of the filler.

E MEA assembly, functional properties
Different strategies were tried earlier to prepare MEAs, including the use of commercial (e.g. E-TEK) as well as homemade carbon electrodes, with Pt loadings in the range 0.5–2 mg cm−2.61 Two procedures were proposed: (i) hot pressing of the electrodes with a dry PBI membrane, and subsequent doping with H3PO4, and (ii) hot pressing of the electrodes with a doped PBI membrane. The latter method was reported to be more suitable for the preparation of large MEAs. In this latter case, however, a careful post-pressing doping with H3PO4 is likely needed for optimal MEA operation.46
In order to optimize the MEA performances, however, some important aspects should be considered, such as the electroactivity of the cathode and the nature of the electrocatalyst.62–65 Generally speaking, it is recommended to prepare in-house electrodes containing the proper ionomer. Some recipes were proposed in the recent literature. Li and Scott66 prepared a catalyst ink by blending the carbon-supported catalyst (60 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72, E-TEK) and a solution of PBI_4N and PVdF in DMAc. The ink was cast onto a carbon-supporting layer covered with a gas diffusion layer. After proper thermal treatments, the MEAs were assembled by hot pressing the anode and cathode onto the acid-doped membranes at 150 °C and a pressure of 100 kg cm−2 for 10 min. Modestov et al.67 used a similar Pt/C catalyst blended with a Nafion 5% solution used as a binder to ensure integrity of the catalyst layer. The ink was spray-coated on the anode and cathode gas diffusion layers (GDL, Sigracet 10DC, SGL Group). Another recipe employing a different binder was proposed by Kulikovsky et al.68 In this case, gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) with a platinum loading of 1.2 mg cm−2 were prepared by coating an ink containing 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (HiSPEC 3.000, Johnson Matthey) and PTFE (Dyneon) onto a woven gas diffusion layer (GDL, HT 1400-W, Basf) via an automated doctor blade technique followed by a drying step.
In order to allow a good contact among the electrodes and the membrane, however, the GDEs should be impregnated by H3PO4, and this is normally performed after MEA assembly. Impregnation with about 20 mg cm−2 of H3PO4 was reported.68 In our recent paper,44 we demonstrated that better results can be obtained by impregnating the anode and the cathode with different amounts of H3PO4, namely 20 mg cm−2 and 8 mg cm−2, respectively. However, scarce information may be found in the literature on this issue, and further systematic work is needed for MEA optimization.
Finally, the as-prepared MEAs may require a specific activation in order to assure proper long-term working conditions. The activation procedure is dependent on the customer. For example, Celtec® P1000 MEAs must be activated at a constant 0.2 A cm−2 load for 50 h and 160 °C. Boaventura and Mendes recently proposed two different methods for their own MEAs: (i) galvanostatic activation at 0.02 A cm−2 for 48 h and 160 °C and (ii) potential cycling activation consisting of performing 25 polarization curves for approximately 53 h69
Because of the high proton conductivity at low relative humidity, PBI based MEAs can be operated without gas humidification, which greatly simplifies the construction of the fuel cell when compared with those based on perfluorosulfonic ionomer-based membranes. Moreover, because of the polymer high thermal stability, the PBI-based fuel cells have been tested up to 200 °C, and power densities as high as 1 W cm−2 have been reported with H2/O2 feeding under a pressure of 3/3 bar and no gas humidification.70 Tests of MEAs are often performed with homemade apparatuses, although commercial systems (e.g. Arbin, Bekktech) are available today. The obtainable power is dependent on several parameters such as temperature, gases humidity, flow and stoichiometry, and anode and cathode backpressures. A good analysis was reported a few years ago by Zhang et al.71Fig. 4 shows, as an example, the polarization curves of an aryloxy-PBI membrane under different air stoichiometry values which were recently published by our group.46

The curves were collected at 150 °C and at five different air stoichiometry values: λair = 0.25 (circles), 0.5 (squares), 2 (triangles), 4 (stars), 6 (diamonds). λH2 = 1:5. The measurements were performed at RH < 1% and a backpressure p = 1 bar. Membrane doping level, N = 14. Membrane thickness: 100 μm. Taken from ref. 46. 
F Stack tests and degradation
The major problems affecting the lifetime of the PBI-based fuel cells likely are: (i) catalyst poisoning, (ii) loss of the phosphoric acid, (iii) polymer oxidative degradation, and (iv) catalyst agglomeration/sintering or dissolution.
Concerning the catalysts poisoning, it has been reported that 3% CO in hydrogen can be tolerated at 200 °C up to a current density of 0.8 A cm−2, whereas at 125 °C 0.1% CO can be still tolerated below 0.3 A cm−2.72 These results are very encouraging when compared with the 25 ppm tolerated by Nafion at 80 °C and current densities not exceeding 0.2 A cm−2. The poisoning caused by CO2 is of less extent.
The problem of PA loss has been addressed by the group of Benicewicz.58 They operated the cells in the range 80–180 °C under different loads, including OCV, 0.2 A cm−2, and 0.6 A cm−2. The measured lifetime was about 1000 hours. The observed voltage degradation rate was in the range 4.9–6.3 μV h−1, and the greater PA losses, at the cathode side, were of the order of 10 ng cm−2 h−1. The PA loss was more relevant at high temperature and electric load, which was explained by invoking a steam distillation mechanism for its removal. However, they concluded that the PA loss was not a major factor affecting MEA operation.
Modestov et al.67 tested their MEA for 763 h at 0.2 A cm−2 and 160 °C. They found Pt catalyst grains increase from 3.8 nm to 7.8 nm, which lowered the electrochemically active surface area (ESA). This effect caused a voltage loss of about 25 μV h−1, and a 20% decrease of the membrane resistance. In contrast, the carbon support ESA remained practically unchanged.
Zhai et al. reported a 550 h test of a MEA performed without humidification at 150 °C and constant current at 640 mA cm−2.73 They found that the current performance started to reduce at a rate of 0.18 mV h−1 after about 90 h activation. The ESA loss of the cathode platinum due to agglomeration and a slight increase of internal resistance of the single cell due to PA leaching were detected, contributing to the performance degradation of the MEA during the life test.
PBI-based stacks have been recently tested. One of the main technological problems of stacks operating at high temperatures is the heat removal. Scholta et al.74 modelled (with a finite elements method) and tested external liquid cooling designs which offered two advantages: (i) no liquid coolant is present in the cell active area, so avoiding sealing, and (ii) high temperature gradients exist between the heat removal zone and the active area, which results in a good adjustability of temperature and more compact design. A 500 W stack based on commercial Celtec P1000 MEAs was recently tested by simulating a microheat and power cogeneration (micro-CHP) profile.75 After 658 h of cumulated operations, the electrical efficiency decreased from 30.6 to 28.3%, corresponding to a stack performance loss of 7.6%. Finally, a 20 W stack with PTFE-based electrodes has been tested for 1200 h without any relevant cell degradation.76 A recent work of the group of Lobato suggested that the main degradation mechanism of a fuel cell stack based on polybenzimidazole is not the electrolyte loss but rather the loss of catalytic activity.77 However, further experimental and modelling work is needed to address these points.
G Conclusions
PBI-based membranes are, at present, the most serious candidates as electrolytes for the large-scale development of high-temperature polymer fuel cells, which are particularly interesting for automotive applications. In this frame, some of the technical goals of the VII Framework Programme, FCH JU Call for Proposals are: (i) durability for at least 5000 hours, (ii) proton conductivity higher than 10−1 S cm−1 at 120 °C (25% RH) and higher than 10−2 S cm−1 at −20 °C, and (iii) chemical stability in the presence of fuel, oxidant and water. In order to fulfill these requests, some development/optimization work must be done, chiefly in order to improve the conductivity behaviour at low temperature and humidity. This would require further chemical modifications of the polymer backbone (e.g. O/N groups, sulfonation, etc.), and proper tailoring of active fillers which can also improve chemical and electrochemical stability of the membrane and, as a consequence, MEA durability.

Broader context
Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFC) are leading-edge targets for what concerns the diversification of the power sources required by the current environmental politics. These devices find potential application in the next generation of hybrid or fully electric auto-vehicles and in the storage and conversion device for hydrogen, produced by a solar cell through a photo-catalysed water splitting process. The polymer membrane does determine the attainable power density and the cell durability. In the recent past, Nafion has been the reference target in the optimization process of the electrolyte. However, it does not seem to fit the energetic needs for the automotive compartment. Inside the wide spectrum of alternatives proposed during these past years, acid-doped polybenzimidazole membranes seem to be particularly promising due to the high proton conductivity (>0.1 S cm−1) above 160 °C, even in the absence of humidity. However, some questions are still open: under which operating conditions (chiefly temperature) are the acid-doped PBI systems a real alternative to Nafion? What is the real durability of the PBI cells/stacks? In this perspective we aim to address the state of the art and the most recent developments which could make polybenzimidazole systems the choice for the future high temperature PEMFCs.

 	Scheme 2  (a) Chemical structure of PBI-108. (b) Chemical structure of PBI-109.	 

 	Scheme 3  Chemical structure of the imidazole-containing silica filler (SiO2_Im).	 

 	Fig. 1  Acid uptake of the composite membranes vs. the imidazole-based filler content, both for the as-prepared samples and after the leaching. Redrawn from ref. 52.	 

 	Fig. 2  Plot of the proton conductivity at 80 °C and RH = 50% vs. the doping level, n, before acid leaching. The dotted and dashed lines indicate the maximum degree of protonation of standard PBI (PBI_4N) and the conductivity of the H3PO4 solution respectively. Full circles: data from ref. 48. Open circles: data from ref. 50.	 

 	Fig. 3  Proton conductivity of composite PBI_4N-SiO2_Im membranes vs. the filler content at 120 °C and RH = 50%. Filled circles: as prepared membranes. Open circles: membranes after leaching. Redrawn from ref. 52.	 

 	Fig. 4  Polarization curves of a fuel cell with a membrane made of poly 20,200-(4,40-oxybis(4,1-phenylene))bis(1H,10H-2,50-bibenzo[d]imidazole). The curves were collected at 150 °C and at five different air stoichiometry values: λair = 0.25 (circles), 0.5 (squares), 2 (triangles), 4 (stars), 6 (diamonds). λH2 = 1:5. The measurements were performed at RH < 1% and a backpressure p = 1 bar. Membrane doping level, N = 14. Membrane thickness: 100 μm. Taken from ref. 46.
