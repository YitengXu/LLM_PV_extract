    , Accepted 23rd January 2014First published on 28th January 2014AbstractAg2O/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures have been found to possess high ultraviolet photocatalytic activity, but a poor cycling performance. After a S-doping treatment, the obtained Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 heterostructured nanobelts exhibited an enhanced and stable photocatalytic activity under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation, which was exemplified by photo-degradation of organic pollutants and photocurrent response measurements. Meanwhile, the crystal structure and phase transformation of Ag2O, Ag2S2O7 and Ag2S were studied by XRD and XPS measurements.
Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2), as an efficient photocatalyst, has been intensively investigated since Fujishima and Honda discovered the photocatalytic splitting of water on TiO2 electrodes in 1972.1 TiO2 has been shown to be an excellent photocatalyst due to its long-term stability, low-cost preparation and a strong oxidizing power useful for the decomposition of unwanted organic compounds.2–5 However, this material is only active under UV excitation because of its large energy band gap of 3.2 eV (in its anatase form). Considering that the fraction of UV light is less than 5% in the total solar spectrum on the earth, it is crucial and a great challenge to develop efficient, visible light-active photocatalysts. Thus, band gap engineering of photocatalysts to induce absorption into the wide visible light region has been considered as a possible solution to this problem. The doping of anions such as N,6,7 H,8,9 and C10 into TiO2 has been widely reported. In addition, the growth of TiO2-based heterostructures, such as Ag2O/TiO2,11 CuxO/TiO2,12 MoS2/TiO213 and Fe2O3/TiO2,14 and SrTiO3/TiO215 have been developed, aiming to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency by broadening their light-harvesting window into the visible range. At the same time, the efficiency of charge separation can be enhanced by coupling two semiconductor structures with matching energy levels, leading to improved photocatalytic activity.16–19
Previously, we developed a new system of Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelts, which can effectively suppress the hole–electron recombination under UV light irradiation.11 Ag2O nanoparticles have been found to act as efficient electron absorbing agents under UV light irradiation and as an efficient photosensitiser under visible light irradiation.11,20,21 Subsequently, many studies on the synthesis of Ag2O photocatalysts have been reported, such as Ag2O,20,22 Ag2O/ZnO,23 Ag2O/Bi2O3,24 Ag2O/TiO2,25 Ag2O/Ag2CO3,26 graphene oxide/Ag2O27 and g-C3N4/Ag2O.28 In our work, we found that the Ag2O/TiO2 heterostructures possess a high photocatalytic activity, but a poor cycling performance, as Ag2O may be reduced into Ag by photogenerated electrons.11 Thus, in order to improve the stability of these photocatalysts, surface plasmon effects and core–shell structures have been used to prevent photocorrosion, as shown in the preparation of Ag/AgCl29 and Cu2O@TiO230 hybrid structures. Herein, we designed a new approach based on the S-doping of Ag2O onto TiO2 nanobelts to prepare Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 heterostructures that exhibit high and stable photocatalytic activity, under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. Ag2S2O7 on the surface of Ag2O can effectively protect Ag2O from conversion to Ag. The crystal structure and phase transformation of Ag2O, Ag2S2O7 and Ag2S were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
Experimental
Chemicals
Titania P25 (a commercial TiO2), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and sodium sulfide (Na2S) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. All chemicals were used without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout all experiments.
Synthesis of TiO2 nanobelts with a rough surface
The TiO2 nanobelts with a rough surface were synthesized through a simple hydrothermal procedure, followed by an acid corrosion treatment.4 In a typical reaction, 0.1 g of TiO2 powder (P25) was mixed with 20 mL of 10 M NaOH aqueous solution. The mixed solution was stirred and then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, heated at 180 °C for 48 h, and then air-cooled to room temperature. The obtained wet powder was washed thoroughly with deionized water followed by a filtration process. The obtained Na2Ti3O7 nanobelts were immersed in 0.1 M HCl aqueous solution for 24 h and then washed thoroughly with distilled water to obtain the H-titanate (H2Ti3O7) nanobelts. To roughen the surface, the obtained H2Ti3O7 nanobelts were added into a 25 mL Teflon vessel, then filled with 20 mL of 0.02 M H2SO4 aqueous solution and maintained at 100 °C for 12 h. Finally, the products were isolated from the solution by centrifugation and sequentially washed with deionized water several times, and dried at 70 °C for 10 h. By annealing the acid-corroded H2Ti3O7 nanobelts at 600 °C for 2 h, anatase TiO2 nanobelts with a rough surface were obtained.
Synthesis of Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures
The formation process of the Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures (50 wt% of Ag2O) was as follows.11 Typically, 0.2 g of the acid-corroded TiO2 nanobelts prepared above was dispersed in 50 mL of distilled water and 0.29 g of silver nitrate (AgNO3) was then dissolved into the suspension. The mixture was stirred magnetically for 30 min to establish the adsorption equilibrium. 50 mL of a 0.2 M NaOH aqueous solution was slowly dropped into the above mixture of AgNO3 and TiO2. The amount of NaOH was more than sufficient to completely consume all the added AgNO3, and the final pH of the reaction solution was 14. Finally, the TiO2 nanobelts coated by Ag2O nanoparticles were collected after centrifugation and washed with deionized water several times, then dried at 50 °C for 12 h.
Synthesis of S-doped Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelts heterostructures
0.2 g of the Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures (50 wt% of Ag2O) prepared above was dispersed in 50 mL of distilled water, then stirred magnetically for 30 min. A calculated amount of an aqueous solution of 0.01 M sodium sulfide (Na2S) was slowly added into the above suspension during the magnetic stirring. The color of the suspension was found to gradually change from yellow to black. S-doped Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelts were produced and collected after centrifugation and sequentially washed with deionized water several times, then dried at 50 °C for 12 h. The different components of the heterostructures were controlled by adding different amounts of sulfur; 0 mg, 8.4 mg, 16.8 mg and 33.6 mg of Na2S were added into the above aqueous solution of 0.2 g Ag2O/TiO2. The obtained heterostructures were denoted as S1 (Ag2O/TiO2), S2 (Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2), S3 (Ag2S2O7/TiO2) and S4 (Ag2S/TiO2), respectively.
Characterizations
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were recorded with a Bruke D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm). A HITACHI S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) was used to characterize the morphologies and size of the synthesized Ag2O/TiO2 samples. The chemical composition was investigated via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The high resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images were acquired with a JOEL JEM 2100 microscope. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu) with an integrating sphere attachment and BaSO4 as a reflectance standard. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB 250 instrument.
Photocatalytic degradation activity under UV and visible light irradiation
Methyl orange (MO, 20 mg L−1) was selected as the model chemical to evaluate the activity and properties of the different photocatalysts. In a typical experiment, 20 mL of an aqueous solution of MO and 20 mg of photocatalyst powders were placed into a 50 mL beaker. Prior to photoirradiation, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the dye and the catalysts under ambient conditions. A 350 W mercury lamp with a maximum emission of 356 nm was used as the UV resource, and a 300 W Xe arc lamp through a UV-cutoff filter (≤420 nm) was used as the visible light source. At different irradiation intervals, an aliquot of the reaction solution was collected, centrifuged to remove the catalyst, and used to measure the concentration of MO by monitoring the absorbance with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2102PC). The different samples were repeatedly used six times with the same experimental conditions to test the photocatalytic stability.
Photocurrent measurements
For the fabrication of the photoelectrodes, 1 mL of an ethanol suspension of the as-prepared photocatalyst powders (20 mg) was dropcast onto a piece of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass with a cover area of 1 cm2 and allowed to dry under ambient conditions. The photocurrents were measured with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 750E, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai) using a three-electrode mode in an aqueous solution of 1 M Na2SO4. The reference electrode and counter electrode were a Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) and platinum wire, respectively. The as-prepared photoelectrodes were used as the anodes for the electrochemical characterizations. A 350 W mercury lamp with a maximum emission at 356 nm was used as the UV resource with a light intensity of 450 mW cm−2. A 300 W Xe arc lamp through a UV-cutoff filter (≤420 nm) was used as the visible light source with a light intensity of 220 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of Ag2O/TiO2, Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2, Ag2S2O7/TiO2 and Ag2S/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures are shown in Fig. 1, which illustrate the phase transformation of Ag2O by S-doping. In curves (a) to (c), one can see a series of diffraction peaks at 25.2, 37.7, 47.9, 53.8, 55 and 62.5° which are assigned to the anatase TiO2 (JCPDS files no. 21-1272); and the diffraction peaks at 32.8, 38 54.9 and 65.4° in the pattern of Ag2O/TiO2 correspond to the cubic structure of Ag2O (JCPDS files no. 41-1104). After a full vulcanization treatment, pure Ag2S was obtained, with the corresponding diffraction peaks at 29, 31.5, 33.6, 34.4, 34.7, 36.5, 36.8, 37.1, 37.7, 40.7 and 43.4° (JCPDS files no. 14-0072), as depicted in Fig. 1d. In comparison with the diffraction profiles of Ag2O/TiO2 and Ag2S/TiO2, the peaks of the partially S-doped Ag2O nanoparticles at 20.5, 32.6 and 33.6° are attributed to Ag2S2O7 (JCPDS files no. 21-1343, Fig. 1b and c). The Ag2O, Ag2S2O7 and TiO2 phases coexist in the S2 sample (Fig. 1b), which indicates that Ag2S2O7 is the metastable interphase between Ag2O and Ag2S.

The morphological and microstructural details of the as-prepared Ag2O/TiO2, Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2, Ag2S2O7/TiO2 and Ag2S/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures were then investigated by SEM and HRTEM measurements. Fig. 2a shows a typical SEM image of the as-prepared Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelts. The acid corroded nanobelts show a width of 50 to 200 nm, and a length of up to hundreds of microns, which is shown in Fig. S1.† The Ag2O nanoparticles on the TiO2 nanobelts exhibited a narrow size distribution with a small size of 5 to 20 nm. However, the Ag2O nanoparticles can't be distinguished from the TiO2 nanobelts with a rough surface by SEM equipment due to the low contrast.4,11 The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. 2e) reveals that the Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelts are only composed of Ag, Ti and O elements. After the sulfur doping, the morphologies of the nanobelt heterostructures of Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2, Ag2S2O7/TiO2 and Ag2S/TiO2 remained virtually unchanged as shown in Fig. 2b–d, indicating the nanoparticles on TiO2 nanobelts are very stable. The EDS analysis reveals that the sulfur content of the heterostructures increased with the doping contents, which is shown in Fig. 2e.

The HRTEM images of the samples further confirm the formation of a heterostructure between the TiO2 nanobelt and Ag2S2O7 nanoparticles (Fig. 3). After a Na2S aqueous solution was added into the mixed aqueous solution of Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelts, Ag2S2O7 nanoparticles were found to be tightly attached to the surface of the TiO2 nanobelt, forming Ag2S2O7/TiO2 heterostructures (Fig. S2†), which may be propitious to electron transfer between the two phases. Measurements of the lattice fringes showed an interplanar distance of ca. 0.35 nm and 0.14 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 and the (220) plane of Ag2S2O7, respectively. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping analysis of the S3 sample also confirmed that the Ag2S2O7 nanoparticles, composed of Ag, S, and O elements, were dispersed on the surface of the TiO2 nanobelt with Ti and O signals (Fig. 3c). In addition, the obscure interfaces on the surface of the Ag2O nanoparticles were observed in the HRTEM image of S2 (Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2) as shown in Fig. S3,† which implies that the Ag2S2O7 was possibly formed by sulfur diffusion into the interior Ag2O nanoparticles.

The electronic states of the Ag and S elements in the S-doped Ag2O were then studied by XPS measurements. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The Ag 3d5/2 electrons of Ag2O/TiO2 can be identified at 368.1 eV, which is characteristic of Ag+ (Fig. 4a). The asymmetric peaks for Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 suggest that the Ag2O nanoparticles might have undergone a partial surface reduction from the photoelectrons of the TiO2 nanobelts. From sample S2 to sample S4, the binding energy of the Ag 3d5/2 electrons was found to shift to 367.8, 367.9 and 368 eV, respectively, in good agreement with the expected values for Ag bound to sulfur, indicating the increasing degree of sulfur doping.31 The XPS measurements of the S 2p electrons display similar results (Fig. 4b). For the Ag2O/TiO2 sample, no S signal was observed. After sulfur doping, obvious signals can be observed for the S 2p electrons in the S2, S3 and S4 samples. For instance, for the S2 and S3 samples, in addition to the S2− electrons at 162.9 and 161.7 eV, the S6+ electrons can also be at 168.7 and 167.7 eV, indicating the formation of Ag2S2O7. After being completely vulcanized (S4), the S6+ peaks disappeared, consistent with the complete conversion from Ag2S2O7 to Ag2S. In comparison with the results of Ag2S, the S 2p peaks for Ag2S2O7 shift by about 0.7 eV from 161.0 eV to 161.7 eV, which could be attributed to the S–O bonding effect. These XPS results suggest that the S-doping process might involve a change of the S valence state from S2−(Na2S) to S6+(Ag2S2O7), and then to S2−(Ag2S).

To evaluate the photocatalytic activity, we examined the decomposition of MO in water under UV light irradiation as a function of time. For comparison, the decomposition over (S1) Ag2O/TiO2, (S2) Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2, (S3) Ag2S2O7/TiO2 and (S4) Ag2S/TiO2 was carried out under the same experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 5a, the Ag2O/TiO2 heterostructures exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity of MO degradation under UV irradiation. With increasing irradiation time, the decomposition of the MO dye progressed steadily and completed in 8 min of UV irradiation. The degradation activity of Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 heterostructures was much higher than those of the Ag2S2O7/TiO2, Ag2S/TiO2 and TiO2 nanobelts, and slightly lower than that of Ag2O/TiO2. The results suggest that the photocatalytic activity of the heterostructures decreased with the increase of the sulfur content.

Yet, the photocatalytic stability of the heterostructures under UV light irradiation was enhanced with S-doping. Experimentally, the photocatalysts were used repeatedly six times after separation via membrane filtration, and the activity was evaluated and compared, as shown in Fig. 5b. One can see that the Ag2O/TiO2 photocatalyst was unstable for repeated use under UV irradiation with a marked decrease of photocatalytic activity after each repetition. For instance, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of MO was only 65% after the sixth time. However, the S-doped samples of Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2, Ag2S2O7/TiO2, Ag2S/TiO2 photocatalysts all exhibited stable photocatalytic performance under UV light irradiation. There is no obvious decrease of the removal rate of MO after six cycles for 96 min.
The visible-light photocatalytic activities of TiO2 nanobelts, Ag2O/TiO2, Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2, Ag2S2O7/TiO2 and Ag2S/TiO2 were also evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of a MO aqueous solution under visible light irradiation, which are shown in Fig. 6. Due to the large band gap energy (3.2 eV for anatase), TiO2 nanobelts can absorb UV light with wavelengths shorter than 400 nm. So, TiO2 nanobelts showed only a low photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation, and the degradation was only 12% in 150 min. In contrast, the Ag2O/TiO2, Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2, Ag2S2O7/TiO2 and Ag2S/TiO2 heterostructured catalysts all showed apparent visible-light photocatalytic activity. Fig. 7 depicts the UV-vis absorbance spectra of the different samples. One can see that Ag2O, Ag2S2O7 and Ag2S might act as efficient visible-light sensitizers leading to improved visible light photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanobelts. For instance, Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelts display a strong light absorption in both UV and visible regions of 250–1200 nm. After sulfur doping, the obtained Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2, Ag2S2O7/TiO2 showed a similar absorption in the same range of 250 nm to 1200 nm but with a blue shift. As for Ag2S/TiO2, the absorption peak between 500 and 600 nm disappeared, and the absorbance was significantly reduced at a wavelength greater than 1000 nm. Note that the photocatalytic activity of Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 heterostructure was better than those of Ag2O/TiO2, Ag2S2O7/TiO2 and Ag2S/TiO2. This might be accounted for by energy band matching that has been found to play an important role in enhancing photocatalytic activity. The degradation rate of MO by Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 reached 81% in 150 min. The corresponding degradation rates of MO under the same conditions in the presence of Ag2O/TiO2, Ag2S2O7/TiO2 and Ag2S/TiO2 were 55%, 62% and 24%, respectively. To investigate the photocatalytic stability under visible light irradiation, the same samples were repeatedly used for six cycles, which are shown in Fig. 6b. All the heterostructured photocatalysts, (S1) Ag2O/TiO2, (S2) Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2, (S3) Ag2S2O7/TiO2 and (S4) Ag2S/TiO2, exhibited very stable photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation. There is no obvious decrease in the degradation rate of MO after six cycles (for 900 min). Of these, the Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 heterostructured nanobelts exhibited the best photocatalytic performance under both UV and visible light irradiation.

To further understand the effects of heterostructures and S-doping on the photocatalytic activity, we studied the photo-induced charge transfer properties of the S-doped Ag2O/TiO2 heterostructures. The photocurrent response of the different heterostructures was recorded under UV and visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Fig. 8a shows the photographs of the different photoelectrodes. The rich colors indicate different energy band structures of the S-doped Ag2O/TiO2 heterostructures that might affect photoabsorption. Fig. 8b shows the photocurrent–time curves for S-doped Ag2O/TiO2 heterostructures under several on–off light irradiation cycles. All samples generate photocurrents with a reproducible response to on–off cycles under UV light irradiation, demonstrating the effective charge transfer and electron collection for the photoelectrodes. However, only pure TiO2 nanobelts were fast in generating a photocurrent with a reproducible response to on–off cycles. The S-doped Ag2O/TiO2 heterostructures show a longer photo-response time, implying a slower charge transfer process, which is possibly due to the heterostructured interface and the random order of the S-doped Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelts. However, sample S1 (Ag2O/TiO2) exhibited the highest photocurrent, which is consistent with the UV photocatalytic activity of S-doped Ag2O/TiO2 heterostructures (Fig. 5). Under visible-light irradiation, pure TiO2 nanobelts show only a negligible photocurrent, whereas all S-doped heterostructures show apparent photocurrents, even higher than those under UV light irradiation, such as S2 (Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2). The high current density demonstrates that the photo-induced electrons and holes of Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 prefer to separate and transfer to the ITO glass due to the heterostructures built between Ag2O, Ag2S2O7 and TiO2.
 Fig. 8  Photographs (a) and time-dependent photocurrent responses (b) of the ITO photoelectrodes composed of the different heterostructured photocatalysts at a bias voltage of 0.5 V. All of the photocurrent intensities were calibrated with dark current. The scale bar of the y-axis in (b) is 0.5 mA cm−2. 
On the basis of the above results, a possible mechanism of the high and stable photocatalytic activity of the Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 heterostructure under UV and visible light irradiation is proposed (Fig. 9). Standard density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the electronic structure of Ag2S2O7 herein, which has not been reported up to now. The atomic unit cell structure, band structure and electronic density of states for Ag2S2O7 are shown in Fig. S4 and S5.† A band gap of ∼2.24 eV for Ag2S2O7 was obtained. In addition, the conduction and valence band positions were determined by using the following empirical equation,32ECB = X ¬ Ee ¬ 0.5Egwhere ECB denotes the conduction band edge potential, X is the geometric mean of the Mulliken electronegativity of the constituent atoms, Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (about 4.5 eV) and Eg is the band gap. The X values for TiO2, Ag2O and Ag2S2O7 are 5.81 eV, 5.29 eV and 6.02 eV, respectively,33 and the corresponding Eg values are 3.2 eV, 1.2 eV, and 2.24 eV. Thus, the positions of the conduction band edge (ECB) at the point of zero charge are estimated to be −0.29 eV, 0.19 eV, and 0.26 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 9.

Under UV light irradiation, TiO2 nanobelts were excited to produce holes (h+) and electrons (e−). The Ag2O nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 nanobelts captured electrons effectively due to the more positive conduction band of Ag2O than that of TiO2. The obtained electrons reacted with the Ag2O nanoparticles with the narrow band gap (1.2 eV) to produce Ag nanoparticles.11 The Ag2O nanoparticles, as electron acceptors, prevent electrons and holes from undergoing recombination, and the holes efficiently oxidize organic compounds, and thus the photocatalytic activity is enhanced, but the catalysts were unstable. After sulfur doping, the obtained Ag2S2O7 on the surface of the Ag2O nanoparticles can effectively prevent deformation of the crystal structure. Ag2S2O7 has the appropriate energy structure and energy band matching with that of Ag2O, to capture electrons from the conduction band of Ag2O, but not be reduced by the photogenerated electrons of TiO2 due to the wide band gap of Ag2S2O7 (∼2.24 eV). However, compared with Ag2O/TiO2, the photocatalytic activity of Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 was slightly decreased due to the reduced content of Ag2O. So, the relatively high and stable UV photocatalytic activity of Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 was obtained by the sulfur doping due to the protective effect and energy band structure of Ag2S2O7.
Under visible light irradiation, Ag2O, Ag2S2O7 and Ag2S can be excited to produce h+ and e− due to the narrow band gap (1.2 eV, 2.24 eV and 0.92 eV, respectively), leading to the apparent visible photocatalytic activity. Compared with Ag2O/TiO2 and Ag2S2O7/TiO2, the Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 heterostructure possessed the best visible photocatalytic activity. The results were mostly attributed to the heterostructure and energy band matching of Ag2O and Ag2S2O7. The lifetime of the excited electrons and holes was prolonged in the transfer process between heterostructures, thus the photocatalytic reaction was enhanced. As electron excitation did not occur in TiO2 by visible light irradiation, Ag2O and Ag2S2O7 were stable in the system of Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2. These characteristics led to the emergence of the Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 heterostructures as the best photocatalyst among the series.
Conclusions
The Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures were synthesized by the S-doping of Ag2O/TiO2 nanobelts. The crystal structure and phase transformation of Ag2O, Ag2S2O7 and Ag2S were studied by XRD and XPS measurements. XPS studies indicated that the sulfuration process involved various valence states of the S element, from S2− (Na2S) to S6+ (Ag2S2O7), then to S2− (Ag2S). Within the present experimental context, the Ag2O/Ag2S2O7/TiO2 heterostructured nanobelts exhibited high and stable photocatalytic activity under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. The UV-vis absorption spectra showed that Ag2O, Ag2S2O7 and Ag2S served as effective visible-light sensitizers that led to the improved visible light photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanobelts. The results might be accounted for by the energy band matching among Ag2O, Ag2S2O7 and TiO2, as well as by the structure restriction effects.
