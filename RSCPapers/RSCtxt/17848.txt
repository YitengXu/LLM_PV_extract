    , Accepted 26th June 2017First published on 26th June 2017AbstractRecently, semiconductor photocatalysts have received significant interest in addressing the global energy and environmental crisis. Despite the great potential application of zinc oxide (ZnO), the utilisation efficiency of solar energy is limited only to the ultraviolet (UV) region. Therefore, our research interest is centred on the development of a model hybrid ZnO-based photocatalyst material with efficient photocatalytic performance and stability. A hybrid ternary ZnS/graphene oxide (GO)/ZnO system, where the band edges of the individual components in the heterostructure will have a step-wise structure for harvesting a broader portion of the solar spectrum, is an excellent solution. Herein, we explore the charge transfer, the improved photocatalytic mechanism, and the electronic and interfacial properties of the hybrid van der Waals (vdWs) ZnS/GO/ZnO heterostructure for the first time by carrying out comprehensive hybrid density functional theory calculations. Our results reveal the existence of vdWs interaction, enhance charge transfer, narrow the band gap and show remarkable improvement in the visible light photocatalytic activity of the heterostructures compared to pure ZnO. This enhancement is ascribed to the electron acceptor–transporter role played by the GO sheet in the interfacial layer of ZnS and ZnO. According to adhesion energy results, the monolayers are in contact and form stable heterostructures. The calculated charge density difference shows interlayer charge transfer from the ZnO(001) surface to the ZnS(110) surface through the GO sheet. Most significantly, the ZnS/GO/ZnO heterostructures exhibit a type-II band alignment, which significantly restrains the recombination of charge carriers. The band edge positions of ZnS/GO/ZnO with enough driving force for electron and hole transfer are well aligned for the feasibility of splitting water into H2 and O2, as well as for photodegrading pollutants in the water system. Therefore, the vdWs ZnS/GO/ZnO heterostructures appear as a new type of photocatalyst material for solar energy application. This study illustrates the usefulness of using low cost GO as an interfacial electron acceptor–donor to boost the photocatalytic performance of ZnO-based photocatalysts. The findings in this study provide a theoretical basis for developing highly efficient ZnO-based photocatalysts, as well as attract broad interest in VdWs heterostructure research in photocatalysis.
1. Introduction
Energy storage and conversion play a key role in the development of modern human society. The global dependency on the limited, low-efficiency and non-renewable fossil fuels has triggered researchers to look for alternative energy sources. Furthermore, the burning of fossil fuels produces a huge amount of CO2, which causes environmental pollution and climate change.1 Therefore, the search for renewable and sustainable energy sources alternatively to non-renewable fossil fuels is significant. The photocatalytic splitting of water into H2, which is a green and promising route to produce clean energy, has been used to address global environmental pollution.2–4 The design of semiconductor-based photocatalyst materials with a suitable band gap energy of ∼2.0 eV has received considerable interest in water splitting,5,6 reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbons,7,8 and photodegradation of contaminants in waste water using sunlight.9 A suitable photocatalyst should have its band edges straddle the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potentials. Moreover, the band gap must be less than 1.6 eV to efficiently utilise solar energy.10 In photocatalysis, the semiconductor absorbs light to generate electrons (e−) and holes (h+).11 The region of the spectrum where the semiconductor absorbs light depends on the energy difference between the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB). Subsequently, the photoinduced electron–hole pairs can then initiate the redox reactions at the semiconductor surface, which can then degrade the adsorbed pollutants in the wastewater, as well as results in splitting of water into H2.12
Semiconductor metal oxides, such as ZnO, TiO2, ZrO2, WO3, SnO2, MoO3 and α-Fe2O3, as well as sulphides, such as CdS, CdSe, ZnS, MoS2 and WS2, are utilised as promising cocatalysts for photoinduced redox reactions. This is due to their inherent electronic structure that comprises an empty CB and a filled VB.13,14 To achieve a high redox reaction, the recombination rate of the charge carriers should be kept low15,16 to improve the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor towards the degradation of pollutants and water splitting. Even though TiO2 is shown as the most promising photocatalyst, ZnO has received considerable interest due to its photochemical stability, non-toxicity, low cost, ease of preparation and availability.17,18 Additionally, ZnO is reported to exhibit better performance in eliminating organic pollutants in water matrices than TiO2.19 ZnO is an excellent semiconductor for photocatalysts, ultraviolet laser and photodetectors.20,21 However, the wider band gap (3.20 eV), the large binding energy (60 meV) and the fast recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers22 reduce the photocatalytic activity of ZnO over a wider wavelength region. To enhance the photocatalytic activity, several strategies, such as doping,23,24 noble metal deposition,25,26 morphology modification27,28 hybridising ZnO with carbon materials29,30 or combining ZnO with other semiconductors,31,32 are used.
Another important II–VI semiconductor is zinc sulphide (ZnS), which comprises the hexagonal form (h-ZnS) and the cubic form (c-ZnS).33 ZnS is a promising photocatalyst due to its fast generation of charges, as well as the highly negative reduction potential of the photoexcited electron. ZnO is applicable not only to water splitting,34 but also to the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants in water systems.35
A possible method to enhance charge transfer and induce visible light response is to couple two semiconductors. Coupling two semiconductors create interfacial states (heterostructures) to improve charge transfer across the interface.36 The strategy of designing heterostructures enhances charge separation towards a highly effective photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, the immobilisation of ZnO with other semiconductors is a plausible approach to enhance its photocatalytic activity.37–39 The interaction between heterostructures determines the stability, electron transfer mechanisms, as well as the photocatalytic performance.40 Besides the interface separation, the adsorption energy of the composite also signifies the strength of the interfacial interaction. In this study, the heterostructure of ZnS and ZnO is an excellent system. The incorporation of these semiconductors can tune the structure to lower photoexcitation threshold energy41 compared to the individual components.
Recently, the design of ternary heterostructures is an excellent approach to achieve a highly efficient charge transfer and photocatalytic activity. The coupling of graphene oxide (GO) with semiconductors is shown as a promising approach to enhance their photocatalytic activity.42,43 GO contains several polar surface oxygen functional groups, and a tuneable band gap (2.4–4.3 eV), which is highly suitable in the area of visible light photocatalyst application.44,45 However, to date, only a few ternary heterostructures, such as GO/SnO2/TiO2,46 CuO/ZnO/rGO,47 ZnO/rGO/Ag,48 ZnS/Ag2S/RGO,49 ZnO/rGO/Au,50 ZnO/Si/rGO,51 TiO2/Au/TiO2,52 and RGO/TiO2/ZnO,53 have been successfully utilised for the photocatalytic water splitting and degradation of contaminants. Recently, several van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructures have been designed to modify the properties of the photocatalyst.54 More significantly, vdWs heterostructures improve the optical and electronic properties by combining the advantages of the individual monolayers.55
Band gap narrowing can be done either by shifting the conduction band minimum (CBM) in the downward direction or by elevating the valence band maximum (VBM) in the upward direction. However, shifting of the band edge to a large extent will influence the oxidising and the reducing properties of the photocatalyst material, which are significantly related to the OER and the HER, respectively. Therefore, one needs to employ controlled band gap engineering. In this study, we are interested in discussing how the band gap of ZnO can be tuned to enhance its visible light absorption behaviour. A ternary based heterostructure of GO, ZnS and ZnO with enhanced photocatalytic activity is a promising material for visible-light-driven photocatalysts. The use of ZnS and the GO sheet is motivated by their special properties and structure. The main objective of this study is to show whether the ternary vdWs heterostructure based on GO and ZnS modification will enhance the electronic properties and the visible light response of ZnO. In this study, we have used a comprehensive hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional56 and long-range dispersion corrections to investigate the adsorption of ZnS and GO on the ZnO(001) surface, the effects of non-covalent interactions and the role the interface play in the overall photocatalytic performance of ZnO by ZnS and GO modification. Electronic structure calculations using the density functional theory (DFT) method are essential for revealing the interactions of photocatalyst materials as they are capable of accurately predicting the lowest-energy adsorption geometries, as well as identifying charge transfer and effective masses of the charge carriers.57 The stability, electronic structures and optical properties of the ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures are investigated to comprehend the underlying mechanism responsible for the improved photocatalytic activity. The suitability of the proposed heterostructures towards water splitting and pollutant degradation is assessed by aligning the band edges relative to the water redox potentials. These findings are expected to provide the usefulness of adopting the interfacial mediator approach to optimise the transfer of charge carriers at the interface and van der Waals interaction towards high-performance photocatalyst materials.
2. Computational details
All the DFT calculations are performed using the norm conserving pseudopotential58 of the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code59 in Materials Studio 2016.60 The exchange–correlation effect is treated with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)61 formalism of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the long-range vdWs interaction is taken into account using the DFT-D2 method proposed by Grimme62,63 due to its good description of long-range vdWs interactions. The cut-off energy is set to 400 eV. For self-consistent electronic minimisation, the Pulay density mixing method is employed with the convergence tolerance of 10−6 eV per atom. Geometry relaxation is carried out on all the systems until the stress and forces converge to 0.05 GPa and 0.03 eV Å−1, respectively. The energy and maximum displacement tolerance are 10−6 eV per atom and 10−3 Å, respectively. The integration over the Brillouin zone is sampled using the Monkhorst–Pack grids64 with a k-point mesh of 9 × 9 × 9 for geometry calculations. Since the DFT-GGA scheme extremely underestimates the band gap of most semiconductors, the most sophisticated hybrid HSE06 functional given by Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof65 is adopted in this study. Once the optimised structures are obtained, the HSE06 functional is used to precisely calculate the electronic structure (band structure, optical properties and density of states) of GO, bulk ZnO, the ZnO(001) surface, bulk ZnS, the ZnS(110) surface, ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterojunction. For the hybrid functional calculation, the electronic structure calculations are carried out with a k-point grid of 3 × 3 × 3. In the HSE06 functional, the exchange–correlation energy is expressed as EHSEXC = χESRX(μ) + (1 − χ)EPBE,SRX(μ) + EPBE,LRX(μ) + EPBEC,(1) In the HSE06 functional, the electron–electron interactions are separated into short-ranged (SR) and long-ranged (LR) Hartree–Fock exchange to enhance the discontinuity of the Kohn–Sham potential for integer electron numbers. The screening parameter μ is set to 0.20 Å−1.
The chosen GO sheet, ZnS and ZnO monolayers are all available under current experimental conditions. Under normal conditions, ZnO crystallises to the Wurtzite crystal structure with a space group of P63mc, and lattice constants of a = b = 3.250 Å, and c = 5.207 Å.66 In addition, the sphalerite ZnS crystal structure with a space group of F3m and lattice parameters of a = b = c = 5.409 Å is used.67 The initial structures of ZnO, ZnS and GO sheet are modelled using the experimental atomic positions and lattice parameters as discussed above. The initial structure model of a GO sheet is modelled following the experimental lattice constants and the atomic positions.68 A lattice constant of a = 5.68 Å, b = 2.64 Å, and c = 15.00 Å and a space group of cmmm is used to model the GO sheet.68 The atomic position and lattice parameters of ZnO, ZnS and GO sheet are relaxed during the geometry optimisation process on all the systems using the conjugate gradient method of the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shannon (BFGS) scheme.69 The optimised structures are then used to build the ZnO(001) and ZnS(110) slabs. To construct the ternary hybrid heterostructures, stoichiometric Wurtzite ZnO(001) and Sphalerite ZnS(110) slabs are chosen since it is the most stable surface among the low index surfaces.70,71 In our heterostructure model, the ZnO(001) and ZnS(110) slabs are expanded into 3 × 4 to support the GO with a 4 × 5 super cell. The heterostructures are modelled using an interface of 20 Å vacuum to avoid the periodic interaction, as shown in Fig. 1.

The optical absorption spectrum of semiconductor-based photocatalyst materials associated with their electronic band structure is a key factor for examining their photocatalytic performance.72 The absorption spectrum of the heterostructures is evaluated using the frequency dependent dielectric function,73 ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω)(2) The imaginary part of the dielectric function (ε2(ω)) is derived based on the momentum matrix element as shown in eqn (3):73 (3)where Ω, u, ω, v and c represent the unit cell volume, the vectors describing the polarisation of the incident electric field, the photon frequency, theVB, and the CB, respectively. The real part of the dielectric function (ε1(ω)) is obtained from ε2(ω) using the Kramers–Kronig transformation, eqn (4): (4)The absorption coefficient (I(ω)) is derived from ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) using eqn (5):73 (5) The stability of the heterostructures can be accessed using the interface adhesion energy (Ead) as shown in eqn (6): Ead = Ecomb − EX − EY(6)where Ecomb, EX, and EY are the total energy of the heterostructures and the individual components (X and Y) in the heterostructures, respectively. Moreover, negative formation energy indicates that the heterostructures can form a stable interface.

The calculated lattice parameters using the GGA-PBE exchange–correlation functional are underestimated. The lattice constants are all smaller than the corresponding experimental data in the range of 0.24–4.28%. This is due to the shortcoming of the semilocal functional in the Kohn–Sham density functional theory calculations. Using the hybrid HSE06 functional, the lattice constants of a = b = c = 5.407 Å for a unit cell of cubic ZnS and a = b = 3.248, and c = 5.206 Å for wurtzite ZnO agree well with the experimental data (a = b = c = 5.409 Å for ZnS; a = b = 3.249 Å and c = 5.207 Å for ZnO)67,74 and theoretical studies.75 The calculated crystallite size of pure ZnO (47.50 Å3) is in good agreement with 47.59 Å3 reported by Alshammari et al.76 The optimised structural parameters of the GO sheet (a = 5.670 Å, b = 2.640 Å, c = 15.003 Å) are in close agreement with the experimental results. The agreement is very good and demonstrates the reliability of the HSE06 method. In the present study, the HSE06 determined lattice constants of a = 16.361 Å, b = 12.929 Å, and c = 30.594 Å for ZnS(110)/GO, a = 16.962 Å, b = 11.779 Å, and c = 31.360 Å for GO/ZnO(001), a = 16.717 Å, b = 12.952 Å, and c = 36.735 Å for ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) are slightly higher than those obtained using the GGA-PBE method.
To investigate which adsorption model is the most thermodynamically stable, the interface adhesion energy is calculated. The calculated interface adhesion energies are −2.86, −2.66 and −0.95 eV Å−1 for ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures (Table 1), implying that these heterostructures absorb firmly at the surface. All the heterostructures are exothermic, thus, the modification of ZnS and GO on the ZnO surface is energetically favourable. Compared with the ZnS(110)/GO and GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures, the ternary ZnS/GO/ ZnO(001) heterostructure with lower adhesion energy can form easily. After fully relaxing the ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures by the vdWs correction, we find an equilibrium interfacial distance value of 3.43, 3.82 and 3.31(2.96) Å, respectively (Table 1). Based on the long equilibrium distance results, we conclude that the interfacial interactions will be very weak. The smaller interfacial distance shows that the interaction in the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is stronger than the GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure, due to the presence of C atoms near the ZnO(001) surface acting as an electron mediator and transporter. After optimisation, the GO sheet, ZnS(110) and ZnO(001) surfaces are nearly unchanged in the heterostructures (Fig. 1), indicating that the interaction at the interface is indeed vdWs rather than covalent, which is in agreement with other studies.77 Thus, the adhesion energy and the equilibrium distance confirmed vdWs interaction. It should be noted that when the GO sheet adsorbs onto the ZnO(001) surface, only physical adsorption occurs and the non-destructive contact between the GO sheet and the ZnO(001) surface may be a unique characteristic in photocatalysis applications.78
Surface energies of ZnO(001) and ZnS(110) surfaces are calculated according to eqn (7):79 (7)where Ebulk and Eslab represent the total energy of the bulk units and the slab, respectively. “A” represents the surface area of the slab. The calculated surface energies of ZnO(001) and ZnS(110) surfaces are 0.21 and 0.14 J m−2, respectively. The surface energies of the ZnO(001) and ZnS(110) surfaces are small, demonstrating that these two surfaces can form easily. In addition, the smaller surface energy of the ZnS(110) surface compared to the ZnS(110) surfaces indicates its high stability.
3.2 Band structure
To understand the effect of coupling a GO sheet and ZnS on the electronic structure of bulk ZnO, we calculated the band structures of GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures using the hybrid HSE06 method. In addition, the band structures of pure ZnO, pure ZnS, GO sheet, as well as ZnO(001) and ZnS(110) surfaces are also calculated for comparison. The band structures along the high-symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone are shown in Fig. 2. The Fermi level is set at 0 eV.
 Fig. 2  HSE06 calculated band structures of (a) pure ZnO, (b) ZnO(001), (c) pure ZnS, (d) ZnS(110), (e) GO sheet, (f) ZnS(110)/GO (g) GO/ZnO(001) and (h) ZnS(110)/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures. 
The comparison between the DFT-GGA and the hybrid HSE06 functional is given in Table 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The band gap of 2.98 eV for bulk ZnO, 3.39 eV for bulk ZnS and 1.69 eV for the GO sheet determined by the GGA-PBE functional, significantly underestimated the experimental value of 3.20 eV,80 3.60 eV81 and (2.4–4.3 eV)44,45 for bulk ZnO, ZnS and GO, respectively. This is due to the shortcoming of self-interaction inherent in GGA functionals for strongly correlated electron systems with localised electrons. This can be improved by the hybrid HSE06 functional, which enhances the discontinuity of the Kohn–Sham potential for integer electron numbers. As shown in Table 1, the hybrid HSE06 functional calculations of the experimental band gap of the bulk ZnO, ZnS and GO are more accurate than the standard GGA-PBE functional calculations.
The HSE06 calculated band structures for ZnS/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures are shown in Fig. 2. The band structure calculation of the heterostructures is significantly improved by the hybrid HSE06 functional compared to the GGA-PBE exchange–correlation (Fig. S1, ESI†). The bulk ZnO shows a direct band gap (Eg) with the CBM and the VBM situated on the G point of the Brillouin zone. The calculated Eg of 3.24 eV (Fig. 2a) is found to be comparable to the experimental value (3.20 eV).80 When the ZnO(001) surface is exposed, an indirect band gap is observed with the CBM and the VBM positioned on the G and S points, respectively (Fig. 2b). The calculated Eg of the ZnO(001) surface is reduced to 2.72 eV. As shown in Fig. 2c, our calculated direct bandgap (3.64 eV) of bulk ZnS is also comparable to the experimental value (3.60 eV).81 The ZnS(110) surface is a direct band gap semiconductor (3.31 eV) with both the CBM and the VBM positioned on the X point (Fig. 2d). Hence, the HSE06 functional is an effective approach to precisely characterise the electronic structures of the bulk ZnO and ZnS. An indirect band gap (2.68 eV) is observed for the GO sheet with the CBM appearing at the GZ points and the VBM at TY points (Fig. 2e). This value is within the experimental band gap range (2.4–4.3 eV).44,45 The ZnS(110)/GO nanocomposite is a semiconductor with no band gap between its VB and CB (Fig. 2f). Thus, the linear dispersion bands of GO are filled into the band gap of ZnS monolayers. For the ZnS(110)/GO interface, the energy bands near the Fermi level can almost be divided into two groups due to the weak vdW force between the interlayers. When the ZnO(001) surface is hybridised with GO, the band gap is also significantly reduced with the Eg of around 2.53 eV (Fig. 2g). This indicates that the band gap of ZnO as a photocatalyst material can be reduced upon modification with other materials. The ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is an indirect gap (2.25 eV) with the CBM located on the G point and the VBM found between the G and Z points (Fig. 2h). The band gap of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure calculated by the hybrid HSE06 is obviously larger than the theoretical water splitting value of 1.23 eV. Since the band gap of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is around 2.3 eV, the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures are suitable visible-light-driven photocatalyst materials. The reduced direct band gaps can make the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) absorb most sunlight and the transfer of a photogenerated electron from the CBM to the VBM becomes easier. The narrow band of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is due to the direct photogenerated electron acceptor and transporter role played by graphene oxide, which efficiently decreases the electron–hole pair recombination rate and thus, increases the catalytic reaction sites on the ZnO surface. Our theoretical results reveal that the GO and ZnS monolayer is an ideal material to turn the indirect gap of ZnO(001) monolayer into direct band gap ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures due to the newly formed interfaces. Therefore, the GO and ZnS monolayer will preserve the inherent electronic properties of ZnO. The built-in potential, which is well-defined as the energy difference between the CBM of ZnO and the CBM of ZnS(GO), is 0.71 and 0.99 eV for GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) interfaces, respectively. The large built-in potential of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) interface can drive the photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in efficient separation.
3.3 Projected densities of state
To evaluate the influence of vdWs interaction on the electronic structure of ZnO, the projected density of states (PDOS) of pure ZnO, ZnS, GO sheet and their heterostructures are calculated. The HSE06 calculated PDOS are illustrated in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  HSE06 calculated PDOS for (a) pure ZnO, (b) ZnO(001), (c) pure ZnS, (d) ZnS(110), (e) GO, (f) GO/ZnO(001), (g) GO/ZnO(001) and (h) ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures. The Fermi level is shown with a black dashed line. 
In the range of −4 to 0 eV, the VB of bulk ZnO is mainly occupied by O 2p, Zn 3d and Zn 4s states (Fig. 3a), while the VB of pure ZnS mainly consists of S 3p, Zn 3d and Zn 4s states (Fig. 3c). This is one of the key significant factors for the reduced photocatalytic properties of bulk ZnO. Above the Fermi level, the CBs of bulk ZnO are composed of O 2p and Zn 4s states, while Zn 4s and S 2p states dominate the CBs of ZnS. The PDOS analysis signifies that O 2p dominate the VBM, while the CBM of the ZnO(001) surface is composed of Zn 4s states (Fig. 3b). For the ZnS(110) surface, the VBM and the CBM are mainly dominated by S 3p and Zn 4s states, respectively (Fig. 3d). In Fig. 3e, GO exhibits a mixed character of the CB and VB states. The VB is mainly contributed by the O 2p states with some hybridization with the O 2s state, whilst the CB has contributions from C 2p and 2s states. As shown in Fig. 3f, the VB of the ZnS(110)/GO heterostructure comprises O 2p and 2s states, while the CB is composed of S 3p and Zn 4s states. Interestingly, the shape of the conduction band in the GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures is absolutely different from that of the conduction band of ZnO. For the GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures, the VBM is mainly occupied by the O 2p state. By comparing the band structures of GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001), it is obvious that their CBs are similar. This is verified by their PDOS plots, where the CB of the GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures is mainly contributed by the pz orbital of the C atoms in the GO sheet. Thus, the charge transfer is supposed to take place from the Zn 3d and O 2p hybrid states to the C 2p states upon photoexcitation. In the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure, the strong hybridization between the O 2p states and the C 2p states will lead to a huge splitting between the bonding and antibonding states. Therefore, the optical absorption of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is expected to increase significantly with photon energy over the visible light range. The optical transition between the VBM and the CBM around the G point will contribute to the increase in the absorption peak. Therefore, the hybridization between the ZnO(001) surface and the GO sheet influences the band gap reduction of ZnO in the heterostructures.
3.4 Charge transfer and mechanism
The calculated Fermi energies of ZnO, ZnS, GO, ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure monolayers are estimated as 3.22, 4.16, 2.24, 1.71, 0.88 and 0.72 eV, respectively. The Fermi level energy shift indicates a substantial charge transfer after a ZnS monolayer and a GO sheet are coupled to the ZnO(001) surface. Moreover, the interaction at the ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) interfaces indicates a substantial charge transfer among the individual components in the heterostructures. The charge transfer and separation are investigated by plotting the charge density difference with an isosurface of 0.006 e Å−3 and the results are given in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  The density difference of (a) ZnS(110)/GO, (b) GO/ZnO(001) and (c) ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures. Pink and yellow isosurfaces indicate charge depletion and accumulation, respectively. 
The difference between the charge density of the heterostructures, as well as the sum of the charge densities of the individual cluster making up the heterostructures, Δρ can be expressed by eqn (8):40 Δρ = ρhetero − ρX − ρY,(8)where ρhetero, ρX, and ρY are the charge densities of the heterostructures and the isolated components X and Y in the same heterostructure, respectively.
A general scheme of electron accumulation and depletion provides insightful information about the attractive and repulsive nature of charge migration interaction upon adsorption. Due to the interaction, a strong charge distribution occurs in the interface region of the ZnS(110)/GO and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures, whereas there is virtually no charge transfer at the GO/ZnO(001) interface. Although the large separation between GO and ZnO(001) will induce a weak acceptor–donor coupling, there is still charge transfer from the ZnO to the GO sheet. In the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure, the interfacial charge density redistribution is more obvious than the ZnS(110)/GO heterostructure, which indicates stronger interaction and greater electron transfer. The strong charge density at the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) interface is attributed to its smaller separation between the individual monolayers making up the heterostructures. The charge redistribution is observed in the whole slabs for ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures, signifying a significant amount of charge transfer. For the ZnO(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures, the majority of charges are found to be depleted on the proximity of the surface Zn atoms, and partially on the C atoms on the GO sheet, while charges accumulate at the bottom of the S atoms on the top-most ZnS surface. The charge redistribution along the O atoms of the GO sheet is symmetrical due to the homogeneous planar GO. Thus, strong charge depletion and accumulation appear on the O atoms to form both a hole-rich and electron-rich site, respectively. The interfacial interaction results in more negatively charged O atoms in the GO sheet and this shows that initially some of the O atoms, which are catalytically inert, may serve as active sites to enrich the photocatalytic performance of the heterostructures. Based on the Mulliken population analysis, there is an average charge transfer of 0.56, 0.69 and 1.24 |e| at the ZnO(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) interface, respectively. The significant amount of charge transfer at the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) interface demonstrates strong donor–acceptor interactions. Therefore, due to the large charge redistribution and proper built-in potential, the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is an ideal candidate for photocatalytic water splitting and pollutant degradation among the three heterostructures.
To understand the charge variation at the interfaces of the heterostructures, the Mulliken population analysis is investigated on different atoms in the heterostructures; the results are given in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Charge distribution maps of (a) ZnO(001), (b) GO sheet (c) ZnS(110), (d) ZnS(110)/GO, (e) GO/ZnO(001) and (f) ZnS/GO/ZnO(001), with an isovalue of 0.4 e Å−3 within the HSE06 formalism. 
For the ZnO(001) surface, the O and Zn atoms have a charge of −0.88 and 0.88 |e|, respectively. Due to interfacial interactions, a considerable variation of charge of each atom in the heterostructures is found. The top-most S atoms of ZnS, ZnS(110)/GO and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures have a charge of −0.55, −0.43 and −0.25 |e|, respectively, signifying that the electrons in the S atoms are reduced due to the coupling of ZnS(110) and a GO sheet. The bottom-most O atoms of the ZnO(001) surface, ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001), and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures with a charge of −0.88, −0.44, −0.65 and −0.43 |e|, respectively, signify that the electrons of the bottom-most O atoms are reduced in the heterostructures. Based on the charge variation results, the bottom-most O atoms of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure will lose more electrons compared to the isolated ZnO, ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001). This will enhance the stability of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure, which agrees well with the interface adhesion energy calculation discussed previously. The charge redistribution can cause the O atoms to be active sites even though they are catalytically inert in the isolated ZnO monolayer. This is a key factor to enrich the photocatalytic performance of ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures. The bottom-most Zn atoms of ZnO, GO/ZnO(0001) and the ZnS/GO/ZnO(0001) heterojunction, respectively, have a charge of 0.88, 0.97 and 0.99 |e|. This indicates that the bottom-most Zn atoms of GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures can lose more electrons compared to the ZnO(001) surface.
The energy level is another significant factor that affects the properties of heterostructures and is explored by calculating the work functions of the monolayers in the heterostructures. The work function is a critical parameter normally used as an intrinsic reference to the band position calculation.82 The work function of any material may change with surface conditions, which results from an altering surface electric field induced by the electron distribution at the surface. The work function (Φ) potentials along the Z-axis are plotted by positioning the Fermi energy level (EF) with reference to the vacuum energy level (Evac) as given in eqn (9). Φ = Evac − EF(9)

Fig. 6 shows the work function for ZnO(001), ZnS(110), GO sheet, ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures.
 Fig. 6  Calculated electrostatic potentials for (a) ZnO, (b) ZnS, (c) GO sheet, (d) ZnS(110)/GO, (e) GO/ZnO(001) and (f) ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) within the HSE06 functional. The red and green dashed lines denote the Fermi level (EF) and the vacuum energy (Evac) level, respectively. 
The work functions for ZnO, ZnS, GO, ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) are estimated as 5.13, 5.96, 5.48, 4.84, 4.75 and 4.66 eV, respectively, by the DFT-GGA functional (Fig. S2, ESI†). Moreover, the work functions of ZnO, ZnS, GO and their heterostructures are calculated using the HSE06 functional. The work function obtained by the HSE06 functional is found to increase in comparison to the DFT-GGA method. The work functions for ZnO, ZnS, GO, ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures are estimated as 5.19, 6.08, 5.51, 4.91, 4.94 and 4.76 eV, respectively, using the hybrid HSE06 functional. The calculated work function of ZnO (5.19 eV) is in close agreement with the previous theoretical results (5.1 eV).83,84 As given in Fig. 6b, the WF of ZnS is larger than those of GO and ZnO by 0.89 and 0.57 eV, respectively. Hence, the spontaneous charge transfer at the interface may be rationalised by the higher work function of the ZnS surface. The electrons are transferred from ZnO to ZnS through the GO sheet with a low work function. Therefore, ZnO will be positively charge, while ZnS is negatively charged due to strong electrostatic induction. As a result, a built-in potential directed from the ZnO to the ZnS surface will stop the continuous charge diffusion. The WFs of the heterostructures are decreased due to the efficient interfacial charge transfer and the formation of interface dipoles emanating from exchange effects.85 The charge transfer at the ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) interface can be rationalised based on the difference of their work functions. Furthermore, a larger work function difference will induce a more charge transfer. The work function difference (1.14 eV) in the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures is larger than 0.32 (0.57 eV) between ZnS (ZnO) and the GO sheet. Therefore, the amount of charge transfer in the former is larger than that in the latter. These large interfacial charge transfers will improve the photocatalytic activity of ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures. The electrostatic potential difference at the interface, where the potential at ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures is higher than that at ZnS(110)/GO and GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures, can successfully reduce the recombination rate of charge carriers.
The ionisation energy (Eion) of the heterostructures is evaluated according to eqn (10): Eion = WF + VBM(10)
As shown in Fig. 7, the Eion decreases from 7.30 eV in the ZnO monolayer to 6.71 eV and 6.14 eV in the GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001), respectively. This indicates good electron transporting properties between the individual components in the heterostructures.
 Fig. 7  Work function and ionisation energy plot for the ZnO monolayer, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures. 
Therefore, the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures are promising materials to enhance the photocatalytic performance, as well as to restrain the recombination rate to enhance the charge transfer at the interface due to its lower ionisation energy.
As the ZnS(110) and GO monolayer comes in contact with the ZnO(001) surface, the heterostructures become a combined electronic system. Without charge transfer between the individual components in the heterostructures, a small band bending can occur,86 which is derived from eqn (11): ΔW = W − WZnO,(11)where W and WZnO represent the work function of the heterostructures and the ZnO(001) surface, respectively. The band bending is −0.28, −0.57 and −0.43 eV for ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures, respectively. Since ΔW > 0, electrons are migrated from the ZnO monolayer.
3.5 Optical properties
To explore the visible light photocatalytic performance of the heterostructures, the UV-vis absorption spectra and the imaginary part of the dielectric function of ZnO, ZnS, GO sheet, ZnS(110)/GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures are plotted using the HSE06 functional. The absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Calculated (a) absorption spectra and (b) the imaginary part of the dielectric function of ZnO, ZnS, GO sheet, GO/ZnO(001), GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) within the hybrid HSE06 formalism as a function of wavelength. 
As given in Fig. 2a, the ZnO monolayer with a direct energy gap must be a visible light absorber. However, the absorption intensities of the bulk ZnO are limited to the UV region, due to the low Zn 4s states in its CBM and its wide band gap. This is attributed to the fact that the optical transitions and orbital overlap between the conduction band maximum and the valence band maximum are negligible, resulting in a weak absorption band in the visible light region. In the wavelength range of 100 and 800 nm, the optical absorption of the GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is enhanced compared to the pure ZnO. The large redshift is due to the electron transition from the O 2p to the C 2p states (Fig. 3). As a result of the presence of strong interfacial interaction between the GO sheet and the ZnS(110) monolayer, the linear band structure of the GO sheet is disrupted and zero bandgap occurs. Thus, the absorption band corresponding to the interband transition of the GO sheet can induce the absorption spectrum of the ZnS(110)/GO heterostructure to cover the entire visible light region. An obvious absorption peak at a wavelength (λ) of 380 nm is observed in the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure compared to the λ at 320 and 250 nm for the GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS(110)/GO heterostructures. Moreover, the visible light response of GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS(110)/GO heterostructures compared to the bulk has been proved experimentally.87,88 Besides the effective absorption peak value around a λ of 380 nm, the absorption properties of ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) display an excellent visible light response, which will benefit light harvesting. The strong electron coupling at the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) interface induces a unique optical transition. The red-shift absorption of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is due to the C 2p and 2s states of the GO sheet serving as an electron mediator to enhance the photocatalytic performance of ZnO through the efficient separation of the photoinduced charge carriers and then hinders their recombination rate. Therefore, the redshift absorption edge and higher absorption intensity of the heterostructures are due to different electronic transitions, particularly those near the band gap. In summary, the coupling of ZnS and GO sheets on the surface of ZnO will enhance its absorption in the visible light region, which is one of the most significant factors to promote the photocatalytic performance of ZnO.
To confirm their absorption properties, the imaginary part of the dielectric function is shown in Fig. 8b. For the ZnO, three main peaks appear at 3.20, 6.83 and 8.20 eV. The peak at 3.20 eV is ascribed to the inherent transition from the O 2p (S 3p) to Zn 4s states. The peak at 6.83 eV is due to the optical transition between the Zn 3d and O 2p states, while the weak peak at 8.20 eV is largely derived from the direct optical transition between the Zn 3d and O 2s states. Pure ZnS shows ε2(ω) peaks around 3.62, 6.99 and 8.88 eV. The peaks at 3.62 eV are mainly due to transitions between S 3p and Zn 3d states. Above the main peaks, the peaks from 6.99 to 8.88 eV mainly arise from direct transitions between S 3p and Zn 4s states. In the GO sheet, the peaks appear at 3.48, 9.40 and 11.30 eV respectively, and are related to direct transitions from the O 2p to C 2p states. The optical transitions from the O 2p to C 2p states are 2.53(2.45), 6.56(5.98) and 11.70(8.25) eV for the GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures. The shift of the optical transition shows that the direct band gap is decreasing, which is in good agreement with the band structure results. Moreover, the optical transition is enhanced in the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures due to C 2p states in the CB. The peaks appearing, as shown in Fig. 8b belong to the energy transition of some states corresponding to certain energy since ε2(ω) is associated with the PDOS and band structure results.
3.6 Effective mass of the photoinduced charge carriers
To examine the mobility rate of charge carriers, which is a significant contributor to the photocatalytic performance of a semiconductor-based material,89 the effective mass (m*) of carrier charges is extrapolated from the calculated band structures using eqn (12).90 (12)where m* is the effective mass, E(k) is the band dispersion function, ℏ represents the reduced Planck's constant, and ± denotes (−) for the holes, while (+) for the electrons. The E(k) value is found by fitting a trajectory to the energy band as a wave function (k). Moreover, the second order term  is the curvature of the band structure. Generally, a larger coefficient of the second order term indicates higher effective mass and mobility of the carrier charges. The calculated m* of the various heterostructures is presented in Table 2.

The me* values of the ZnS are smaller compared to ZnO and GO, which signifies that the electron transfer in ZnS is fast compared to the ZnO and GO monolayers. However, the small mh* value of the GO sheet indicates that the transfer of holes in the GO sheet is fast, as confirmed by the more dispersive VBM structure. The electron effective mass of charge carriers of the pure ZnO, ZnS and the GO sheet is much higher than those of the GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures, signifying that the charge carrier transfer in ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) is more fast. The smaller effective mass of both electrons and holes in the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure signifies that the charge carriers are better transported in the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure compared to the GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure. Therefore, the smaller effective mass and higher carrier transfer ability of ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) contribute to the improved photocatalytic activity compared to those of GO/ZnO(001) and ZnO.
The effective mass of the electrons is reduced compared to the holes. Therefore, the large effective mass difference between the electrons and the holes is advantageous to restrain their recombination rate.91 To further analyse the recombination rate of the electron excitation within the heterostructures, the relative ratio (D) of the effective masses as defined in eqn (13) is adopted:92 (13) Generally, a higher D value signifies a higher mobility and a lower recombination rate of the photoinduced charges.93 As shown in Table 2, the highest D value is calculated for the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure compared to ZnO and GO/ZnO(001). Therefore, the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure exhibited an enhanced separation of photoexcited charges to improve its photocatalytic activity due to its low recombination of charge carriers.
3.7 Feasibility of photocatalytic water splitting and pollutant degradation
The improved photocatalytic performance derived from the efficient generation of charge carriers, separation and migration of photoinduced charge carriers strongly relies on the band structure. Band gap reduction is necessary to enhance the visible light activity, however, may not be sufficient to achieve excellent photocatalytic performance for water splitting and pollutant degradation. As the band gap reduction involves either a downward shift of the conduction band minimum or elevation of the valence band maximum, it may affect the reducing–oxidising efficiency of the material. Hence, it is necessary to check the band edge position of the modified material relative to water redox levels. The capability of the photocatalyst material to undergo redox reactions at the reaction surface relies on its band position. The reactions are energetically favourable if their band edges are located inside the band gap region. The CB potential must be located above the H+/H2 potential and the VB potential must be located below the H2O/O2 potential. In this study, the redox ability of GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures is assessed by evaluating the band edges of the CBM and the VBM with reference to the water reduction/oxidation potential level. The valence band maximum and conduction band minimum positions of the pure and modified systems are determined using the work function approach.94 The band edge positions evaluated from the work function are similar to those calculated by the electronegativity.95 Based on this, the band edge position can be deduced by eqn (14) and (15) as follows:96,97 ECBM = −Φ + 0.5Eg(14) EVBM = −Φ − 0.5Eg(15)where, ECBM and EVBM represent the energy of the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum, respectively. For bulk materials, the band edge calculation is a difficult task, as it entails the utilisation of thick slabs to signify the bulk interior and its surface.98 However, these difficulties are not present in monolayers,98 making them ideal benchmarking systems for calculating the band edge position. The calculated band edges of ZnO, ZnS, GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) are given in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  The band alignment of ZnO, ZnS, GO, GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) with respect to the water redox levels. The two dashed black lines (1.23 and 0 V) are the oxidation potential of O2 and the reduction potential of H2. 
In the ZnO monolayer, the VBM edge potential is 2.11 V, which is more positive compared to the O2/H2O (1.23 V) potential and the CBM edge potential is −0.61 V, which is more negative than that of the H+/H2 (0 V) potential. Thus, the ZnO monolayer has the ability to reduce H+ to H2 and oxidise H2O to produce O2. In the GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures, the CB edge potential is −0.77 and −0.88 V, and the VBM edge potential is 1.77 and 1.38 V, respectively. Hence, the GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures have the ability to reduce H+ to H2, as well as to oxidize H2O to produce O2. Hence, the overall water splitting is thermodynamically feasible in the modified systems. However, the reducing behaviour at the conduction band of the GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is lower than the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure. This designates that the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is a suitable material to harvest a wider portion of the solar energy. The CBM of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is found to be 0.27 V above the CBM of the ZnO monolayer. This implies that the modified system should be more feasible for H2 evolution due to the improvement of reducing power with respect to the ZnO monolayer. The feasibility of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure to decompose organic pollutants, such as methyl orange dye is checked in this study. The CB edge position (0.88 V) of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is more negative compared to the O2/O2−˙ potential (−0.28 V),.95 This makes the dissolved O2 molecules react with the electrons to generate superoxide radical anions (O2−˙), which possess a stronger oxidation ability to decompose organic pollutants. Moreover, O2−˙ radical anions are shown as the most reactive agent in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange dye.99 Henceforth, the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure showed high photocatalytic activity upon H2 evolution and organic pollutant degradation under simulated visible light irradiation.
4. Conclusion
A hybrid ternary ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure for efficient solar conversion is successfully designed. Intensive hybrid functional calculations, using the HSE06 functional and long-range dispersion correction, are performed to explore the stability, optical properties, charge transfer and electronic structure of the individual monolayers and the corresponding heterostructures. The underlying mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the heterostructures is explored. The chosen GO sheet, ZnS and ZnO monolayers are all available under current experimental conditions. We found that ZnS and GO sheets interact weakly with ZnO via weak vdWs interactions to preserve their inherent electronic properties. The negative interface adhesion energy indicates that heterostructures are energetically stable. The GO/ZnO(001), GO/ZnO(001) and ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures have a smaller band gap compared to the ZnO monolayer, which favours visible light absorption. The electronic properties of ZnO, especially the direct band gap is found to be preserved in the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures, making it a high-performance electronic material for photocatalytic water splitting. In this study, GO can act as a sensitizer and a co-catalyst in the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructures to enhance the photocatalytic stability and activity. The CB and VB positions of the monolayers changed with the Fermi level, resulting in favourable type-II band alignment heterostructures. Under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons will transfer from the CB of ZnO to ZnS through the GO sheet. However, the holes will move from the VB of ZnS to that of ZnO through the GO sheet. Moreover, the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure displays a smaller effective mass and a higher carrier transfer ability, which will lower the electron–hole recombination rate to improve charge separation and the photocatalytic activity compared to the GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure and ZnO-based systems. The band alignment for the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is such that both photoreduction and photo-oxidation processes associated with water splitting are energetically feasible. Moreover, the reducing power of the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is higher than that of the bulk ZnO, making it more suitable for H2 generation. In addition, due to the fascinating charge separation, high thermal stability, efficient absorption in the visible light region and suitable band positions, the ZnS/GO/ZnO(001) heterostructure is a suitable material for H2 generation and photocatalytic degradation. Therefore, this theoretical study illustrates the usefulness and efficacy of using a low-cost GO sheet as compared to the noble metals to develop high-performance GO-based photocatalysts.
