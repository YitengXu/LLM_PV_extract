    , Accepted 4th November 2022First published on 4th November 2022AbstractA hydrogen bonded pyridine-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-pyridine type building block TTPY has been synthesized for π-conjugated polymers. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds (RAHBs) formed in the building block. The RAHBs and weak intramolecular noncovalent interactions together enabled a rigid co-planar structure, extended π-conjugated and a tight lamella arrangement in the solid state. Two conjugated polymers based on TTPY have also been synthesized. The PTTPY-DPP-based devices exhibited a p-type field-effect mobility of 0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the PTTPY-BDT:Y6-based polymer solar cells showed a power conversion efficiency of 10.8%. The results demonstrated that pyridines and other azines, due to their combined electron deficiency, less steric hindrance, and especially their ability to form RAHBs, can be useful building blocks for organic semiconducting materials.
Introduction
The prospective applications of π-conjugated polymers in many emerging technologies, such as wearable and flexible electronics, have led to a surge of interest in recent years.1–3 Molecular design plays an important role in creating high-performance polymers with specific electronic and optical properties.4–8 Recently, the strategy of embedding nitrogen-based aromatic heterocycles as alternatives to conventional arenes and thiophenes has attracted much attention.5,9 Pyridine is the parent of a huge class of π-electron deficient heteroaromatics which are referred to as azines. The hexatomic, nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles have three major advantages as building blocks for conjugated polymers. (1) The electron-withdrawing property of pyridine is beneficial to the construction of semiconducting materials with low frontier molecular orbital levels.10–12 (2) The nitrogen atom of pyridine is sterically less demanding compared with the C–H bond in benzene. So, the torsion angles between the repeating units of the conjugated backbone are reduced.11–15 Furthermore, the imine nitrogen of pyridine can form weak intramolecular noncovalent interactions with hydrogen or sulfur atoms in the adjacent repeating unit, and therefore improve coplanarity.16–22 (3) The pyridine nitrogen atom with an unshared electron pair, like tertiary amines, can be metal ion coordinated, N-protonated, N-oxidated, and quaternized.23–28 When a pyridine reacts as a base or a nucleophile, it forms a pyridinium cation in which the aromatic sextet is retained and the nitrogen acquires a formal positive charge. These reactions at nitrogen can significantly alter the optical and electrical properties of the polymers.23,24,29,30 Despite these advantages, the pyridines as building blocks of high-performance semiconducting polymers have been restricted to a few examples so far, especially, focusing on the pyridine-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (PyDPP) type polymers.10,12,31–35
Polymers with high charge carrier mobility in organic electronic devices usually have planar structures and extended π-electron delocalization.5,36–38 Recently, dynamic noncovalent intramolecular interactions, such as O⋯S, N⋯S, and X⋯S (where X is the halogen), have become an effective strategy for designing high-performance organic semiconductors.8 They contribute to planarizing the conjugated backbone and favor charge delocalization and transport. Hydrogen bonding (H-bond) is the most common dynamic noncovalent interaction, which occurs through various functional groups within and between molecules.39–43 H-bonds are relatively strong directional interaction and can lead to stable supramolecular structures. In many organic and biological compounds, the H-bonds are decisive factors governing conformation, molecular recognition, and packing.42,44 Recently, we have developed a strategy for high performance organic semiconducting polymers by incorporating intramolecular resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds (RAHBs) into polymer main chains.45,46 The RAHBs are special type of strong hydrogen bonds with a bond energy of 20–30 kcal mol−1 which is about 3–5 times ordinary hydrogen bonds. The RAHBs often occur in a six- or five-membered ring, and the hydrogen donor and the acceptor are connected by a π-conjugated molecular framework, an example is the enol form of β-diketone.42,47–49 The large bonding energy of RAHBs was suggested as a result of the increase in the donor and acceptor strengths through a charge flow in the polarizable π-bond systems.42 Combining π-electrons delocalization effect and strong hydrogen bonding, the formation of RAHBs promotes planarity and polarization and thus enhances π-electron delocalization.50,51 Herein, we present a new pyridine based building block TTPY (Fig. 1) with RAHB interactions, the carbamate functionalized thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) flanked by two pyridines. In TTPY, the imine nitrogen atoms of pyridines are hydrogen acceptors and the carbamate hydrogens are hydrogen donors. The single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of TTPYa revealed that medium strength RAHBs formed in the building blocks. The analysis also revealed the weak non-covalent interactions between the carbonyl oxygen of the carbamate and the thienyl sulfur atom of TT. The RAHBs and weak non-covalent interactions act simultaneously in the long and short molecular axis of TTPYa, improving the rigidity and planarity of a molecular skeleton. The two polymers PTTPY-DPP and PTTPY-BDT based on TTPY also have been synthesized. Both polymers showed strong aggregation behavior in their dilute solution. The organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices based on PTTPY-DPP offered the highest/average hole mobility of 0.17/0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1. Solar cells fabricated with Y652 as a small molecular non-fullerene acceptor (SM-NFA) and PTTPY-BDT as a donor afforded a power conversion efficiency of 10.8%.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis route and detailed procedure for the preparation of monomers and polymers are presented in Scheme 1 and the Supporting Information. The new compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-3,6-dicarboxylic acid was prepared by following a literature procedure.53 It was converted to bis-carbamate (1a) in a one-pot reaction of acyl azide formation, Curtius rearrangement, and then 2-octyl-1-dodecanol attacking the intermediate isocyanates.541a was brominated with NBS to give compound 2a. The Stille coupling reaction of 2a and 2-(tributylstannyl)pyridine provided TTPY. The chemical shift of the carbamate protons in 1a and TTPY appeared at 7.37 and 12.17 ppm, respectively. It shifted significantly to the down-field due to the formation of RAHBs. TTPY reacts with bromine in chloroform to produce monomer TTPY-Br2 in 40% yield. The bromination happened exclusively on the 5,5′-positions of pyridines. The regio-chemistry of the bromination reaction was confirmed by analyzing the splitting patterns and the coupling constants of the 1H NMR spectrum. The detailed analysis was provided in the Supporting Information. TTPYa-Br2, which had the same backbone but ethylhexyl side chains, was synthesized by the same method for the cultivation of a single crystal. The structure of TTPYa-Br2 was directly determined by X-ray single crystal analysis. Dibromo compounds have been practically used as universal intermediates in the preparation of extended π-conjugated structures. Prior to this work, 1,4-bis(5-bromopyridin-2-yl) flanked building blocks were usually synthesized from 5-brominated pyridine derivatives and the connections to the central ring(s) were made either by ring-closure reaction (S1) or by cross-coupling reactions (S2 and S3) (Scheme S1, ESI†). Here, we demonstrated an alternative way of making this type of building blocks. The bis(pyridin-2-yl) could be dibrominated selectively on 5, 5′ positions of the pyridines after the preparation of the conjugated core.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of monomers and conjugated polymers. 
The polymers PTTPY-DPP and PTTPY-BDT were prepared via Stille cross-coupling reactions of TTPY-Br2 and distannyl monomers. At room temperature, both polymers were soluble in chloroform and formed a viscous solution. These two polymers were dissolved well in hot chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were conducted at a high temperature (150 °C) with 1,2,4-trichloroenzene as the eluent. PTTPY-DPP and PTTPY-BDT showed the number average molecular weight (Mn) of 153.5 and 86.6 kDa and polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of 3.5 and 4.0, respectively. The relatively large PDIs could result from strong aggregation in a polymer solution.25,55,56
Single-crystal structure analysis
The single crystals of TTPYa and TTPYa-Br2 were cultivated by the slow diffusion of ethanol into their solutions in chloroform. The molecular conformation, intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, and solid-state packing were analyzed. The crystal structures of TTPYa (CCDC: 2130514) and TTPYa-Br2 (CCDC: 2130513) are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), and the crystal data and structure refinement parameters are provided in Table S1 and S2 (ESI†), respectively. The bond lengths and torsion angles in the two structures are summarized in Table S3 and S4 (ESI†). The TTPYa molecules were stacked in a one-dimensional lamellar packing with a slipping angle of 24.4°, and the interplanar distance was 3.17 Å. This close packing motif increased the overlapping area of π orbital between molecules. The distances of N–H, N⋯N, and H⋯N in TTPYa were about 0.88, 2.71 and 2.08 Å, respectively. For the TTPYa-Br2 single crystal, the distance of N–H, N⋯N, and H⋯N was about 0.79–0.96 Å, 2.70–2.73 Å, and 1.96–2.15 Å, respectively. These bond distances were typical for structures with moderate RAHBs.42 In TTPYa, the intramolecular hydrogen bond was in a conjugated hexatomic ring (NC–CC–N–H) and the delocalization of π-electrons also occurred in the rings. The RAHBs led to conformation locking in TTPYa, thereby promoting coplanarity and improving conjugation in the direction of the long molecular axis. The intramolecular distance of thienyl sulfur and carbonyl oxygen was 2.81 Å, which was significantly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms (3.25 Å), indicating intramolecular noncovalent S⋯O interactions.57–59 Therefore, the introduction of the carbamate side chains also enhanced the rigidity and planarity of the structure in the direction of the short molecular axis of TTPYavia noncovalent interactions. TTPYa showed a centrosymmetric structure with the dihedral angle N(1)–C(1)–C(6)–S(1A) of 169.3°. TTPYa-Br2 gave a non-centrosymmetric structure with slightly different dihedral angles of 175.09° and −174.91° for N(2)–C(12)–C(11)–S(2) and N(1)–C(1)–C(6)–S(1), respectively. The short π–π distance and large π–π orbital overlap in TTPYa might be beneficial to the charge transport in the conjugated polymer based on it. The carbamate side chains not only provided solubility but also enhanced intramolecular conjugation and tight intermolecular packing.

Theoretical calculations
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to investigate the molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbitals using Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The calculations were performed on three repeat units for each polymer, and the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the dihedral angle between the pyridine unit and carbamate-functionalized thieno[3,2-b]thiophene was about 9° and 10° for trimers of TTPY-DPP and TTPY-BDT, respectively. The dihedral angles were close to those obtained from the single crystal structure analysis of TTPYa.
This suggested RAHBs and non-covalent interactions improved the coplanarity. In contrast, when there were no RAHBs between the pyridine and the adjacent thiophene, the dihedral angles were about 20–24°. The computational results suggested that the RAHBs significantly reduced the twists in the conjugated units. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were calculated to be −3.00/−4.90 eV for PTTPY-DPP and −2.44/−4.94 eV for PTTPY-BDT.
Thermal properties
The thermal properties of the polymers were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The TGA and DSC curves are presented in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), respectively. The decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of PTTPY-DPP and PTTPY-BDT were at 262 and 250 °C, respectively. Both polymers exhibited adequate thermal stability for OFET and solar cell device applications. The polymers did not show noticeable glass transitions in the scanning range from 20 to 200 °C in the DSC measurements.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of the polymers in dilute chlorobenzene solution and as neat films are shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S5 (ESI†). The relevant data are listed in Table 1. The A0-0 peaks were attributed to the intermolecular aggregation of the polymers, and the A0-1 peaks were assigned to the stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor units.60–62 The PTTPY-DPP solution displayed an ICT absorption peak (A0-1) at 654 nm and a sharp peak (A0-0) at 718 nm. The PTTPY-BDT solution exhibited A0-1 and A0-0 at 505 nm and 545 nm, respectively. The absorption maximum (molar extinction coefficient) of PTTPY-DPP and PTTPY-BDT in dilute chlorobenzene was at 718 nm (ε = 1.08 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and 545 nm (ε = 1.37 × 105 M−1 cm−1), respectively. The temperature-dependent UV-vis spectra were recorded at different temperatures of 30, 50, 70 and 90 °C to further investigate the aggregation of the polymers in a dilute solution. The ratios of intensity, I0-0/I0-1, corresponding to A0-0 and A0-1 peaks was used to evaluate the degree of aggregation (Fig. 3b).63,64 For PTTPY-DPP, the I0-0/I0-1 ratio was 1.66, 1.60, 1.53, 1.49 at 30, 50, 70 and 90 °C, respectively. As to PTTPY-BDT, the I0-0/I0-1 ratio was 1.77, 1.71, 1.66, 1.59 at 30, 50, 70 and 90 °C, respectively. This absorption character suggested both polymers possessed strong interchain aggregation in solution. From solution to film, the onset absorptions of both PTTPY-DPP and PTTPY-BDT were red-shifted. The onset absorptions for the PTTPY-DPP and the PTTPY-BDT thin films were at 777 and 585 nm, corresponding to optical bandgaps (Eg) of 1.60 and 2.12 eV, respectively.

The electrochemical energy levels of the polymers and ferrocene were measured by cyclic voltammetry as shown in Fig. 4. The results are listed in Table 1. A ferrocene-ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was selected as the calibrating potential which was found to be 0.07 V versus Ag/Ag+. The oxidation/reduction potentials of PTTPY-DPP and PTTPY-BDT were 0.61/−1.52 V and 0.65/−1.93 V, respectively. Hence, the corresponding HOMO/LUMO levels were −5.34/−3.21 eV for PTTPY-DPP, −5.38/−2.80 eV for PTTPY-BDT, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO levels of PTTPY-BDT could be used as polymer donors to pair with some well-known small molecular acceptors, such as Y6 which had HOMO/LUMO levels of −5.65/−4.10 eV for bulk heterojunction solar cell applications.52

Field-effect transistor devices based on PTTPY-DPP
The OFET devices with the bottom-gate/top-contact (BGTC) configuration were fabricated to study the charge transport property of PTTPY-DPP. The optimized transfer and output characteristics of PTTPY-DPP are shown in Fig. 5, and the performance parameters including maximum mobility (μmax), average mobility (μave), threshold voltage (VT) and current on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) are summarized in Table 2. The results were based on the average of 10 devices. All OFET devices exhibited typical p-type carrier transport characteristics (Table 2). The PTTPY-DPP films were deposited at room temperature and were annealed at 80, 120, and 160 °C for 10 min. The as-spun thin film devices exhibited the hole mobility (μh,max/μh,ave) of 0.12/0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an Ion/Ioff ratio of 104–105 and VT of −12 to −16 V. After thermal annealing at 80 °C, the devices showed the hole mobility (μh,max/μh,ave) of 0.13/0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an Ion/Ioff ratio of 104–105 and VT of −16 to −23 V. After thermal annealing at 120 °C, the devices gave the highest mobility (μh,max/μh,ave) of 0.17/0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an Ion/Ioff ratio of 104–105 and VT of −17 to −26 V. After annealing at 160 °C, the hole mobility (μh,max/μh,ave) decreased to 0.091/0.086 cm2 V−1 s−1, with an Ion/Ioff ratio of 104–105, and VT of −17 to −25 V.

Photovoltaic properties of PTTPY-BDT
The photovoltaic property of PTTPY-BDT was studied in solar cell devices with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/blend film/MoO3/Ag. Devices were optimized in terms of the donor/acceptor weight ratio and the amount of additives. The performances of solar cells were evaluated under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 6. The device metric acquired under various fabrication conditions is present in Table S5 and S6 (ESI†). The highest power conversion efficiencies were obtained from the devices with a D/A ratio of 1:1.2, an active layer thickness of 95 nm, and chloronaphthalene (CN) as the additive (0.5 vol%). The solar cell device exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.8%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.2 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.62. The EQE curve of the solar cell showed a broad response range. The Jsc value which was calculated from the integration of the EQE spectrum was consistent with the result acquired from the J–V measurements. The polymer PTTPY-BDT has a large absorption extinction coefficient (1.37 × 105 M−1 cm−1) at its maximum absorption (545 nm), and Y6 has strong absorption in the near infrared region. The devices showed a high photoelectric response in visible and near-infrared regions. A small depression between 540 and 650 nm on the EQE spectrum could result from the mismatch between the absorption spectra of the donor and the acceptor. PTTPY-BDT possessed a relatively high HOMO level for donors and led to moderate Voc. Some high performance polymer donors, such as PM6,52 PM7,65 PBQ-1066 and P2F-EHp,67 had optical bandgaps in the range of 1.80–1.92 eV, and they were significantly smaller than that of PTTPY-BDT (Eg = 2.12 eV). The optical bandgap of PTTPY-BDT was too large to pair well with Y6. This may contribute to the relatively low Jsc value of PTTPY-BDT:Y6-based solar cells. The relationships of Jsc and Voc as a function of light intensity (Plight) were analyzed to investigate the recombination mechanisms of the solar cells.68,69 The results and fitted lines are presented in Fig. S25 (ESI†). The light intensity (Plight) depended on Jsc and Voc in solar cells are described by the formula: Jsc ∝ Pαlight(1) Voc ∝ (nkT/q) ln(Plight)(2)where the exponential factor α represents the degree of bimolecular recombination. The α value was close to the unit for the PM6:Y6-based device, but the PTTPY-BDT:Y6-based device showed a slightly small α of 0.954. It indicated that bimolecular recombination was more likely to occur in PTTPY-BDT:Y6-based devices. Bimolecular recombination was dominant when the slope was close to kT/q, while trap-assisted recombination or geminate recombination was dominant when the slope was close to 2kT/q.70 The slope was 1.12kT/q for the PM6:Y6-based device and 1.73kT/q for the PTTPY-BDT:Y6-based device. The result also implied that the geminate recombination is more likely to occur in PTTPY-BDT:Y6-based devices. Therefore, the large band gap of PTTPY-BDT and possible recombination in the active layer may result in relatively low Jsc and FF of PTTPY-BDT:Y6-based solar cells.

Microstructure characterization
The surface topographic features of the as-spun and thermal annealed thin films of PTTPY-DPP were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The film morphology did not change much with thermal annealing processes. The as-spun and thermal annealed thin films displayed fibrous features. The 120 °C thermal annealed film showed the lowest root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.65 nm (Fig. 7). The morphology might reduce charge traps and lead to efficient charge transport. The OFET devices also showed the highest hole mobility after annealing at the temperature. After thermal annealing at 160 °C, the films displayed a slightly larger RMS value, which might be responsible for the deterioration of device performances.71 The microstructures of PTTPY-BDT:Y6 thin films were also studied via AFM. The height image of the PTTPY-BDT blend film showed uniform, smooth and appropriately phase separation with the RMS of 2.30 nm, and the morphology was beneficial for charge generation and transport (Fig. 8a).

A two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) study was carried out to investigate the pristine PTTPY-BDT and PTTPY-BDT:Y6 blend films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and corresponding 1D out-of-plane and in-plane scattering profiles are provided in Fig. 8(c–e). The PTTPY-BDT film displayed a typical face on orientation arrangement with a π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction at q = 1.72 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π distance of 3.65 Å. The PTTPY-BDT:Y6 film showed a distinct π–π diffraction feature along the OOP direction located at q = 1.82 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π distance of 3.45 Å, indicating that the blend film had relatively tight packing. Considering that the π–π stacking peak of Y6 was around 1.76 Å−1,52 the clear π–π diffraction signals of blend films might contribute to both PTTPY-BDT and Y6. These results suggested that the PTTPY-BDT:Y6 film adopted a face-on stacking which was often favorable for charge transport in bulk-heterojunction solar cells.72,73

In conclusion, we have synthesized a new hydrogen bonded pyridine-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-pyridine type building block TTPY for π-conjugated polymers. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the monomer revealed that the RAHBs formed between carbamate hydrogens on TT and the nitrogen atoms of pyridines, and weak intramolecular noncovalent interactions existed between thienyl sulfur atoms and carbonyl oxygens. They together enabled a rigid co-planar structure, extended π-conjugated and a tight lamella arrangement in the solid state. Two conjugated polymers based on the TTPY have been also synthesized. The PTTPY-DPP based devices exhibited the p-type field-effect mobility of 0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the PTTPY-BDT:Y6-based polymer solar cells showed a PCE of 10.8%. Our investigations demonstrated that hexatomic, nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles can be used as hydrogen acceptors for the construction of RAHBs in conjugated structures. Due to their combined electron deficiency, less steric hindrance, and especially their ability to form RAHBs, pyridines and other azines can be useful building blocks for organic semiconducting materials.
