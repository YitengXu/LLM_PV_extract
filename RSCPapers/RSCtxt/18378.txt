    , Accepted 14th June 2022First published on 15th June 2022AbstractRed-emitting Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors are promising narrow-band and high efficiency down-conversion luminescent materials for use in high-color-rendition or wide-color-gamut white light emitting diodes. However, their intrinsic moisture-sensitive nature severely hinders their practical applications. Herein, we utilized the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to deposit a passive layer of Al2O3 on K2GeF6:Mn4+ (KGF) phosphor for enhancing its water resistance. The coated KGF phosphor can maintain 91% of its initial photoluminescence when immersed in water for 2 h, in comparison to 67% for the uncoated one. By the Al2O3 protective coating, the KGF phosphor particles can be well isolated from the water and their hydrolysis was then greatly suppressed. The Al2O3 coated phosphor enables the production of LEDs with much better reliability, which have a luminous flux of two times higher than that of the uncoated one when aged under 200 mA for 80 h. This demonstrates that the ALD approach provides a facile route for passivating the moisture-sensitive Mn4+-activated fluoride phosphors with enhanced chemical stability.
Introduction
White light emitting diodes (wLEDs), known as promising energy saving and environmentally friendly lighting devices, are widely used in our daily life.1–3 Up to now, the most popular commercial wLEDs are fabricated by combining a blue light-emitting InGaN chip with a yellow Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ phosphor. However, they suffer from a low color rendering index and high correlated color temperature owing to the lack of intense red emission, restraining their practical applications in high-performance indoor lighting and backlighting devices.4–6 Tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring various kinds of red-emitting phosphors, such as sulfides, nitrides and oxynitrides.7,8 Among them, M2Si5N8:Eu2+ and MSiAlN3:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) are considered as preferable candidates owing to their high quantum efficiency and superior thermal stability.9,10 However, the synthesis conditions of nitride phosphors are rigorous (e.g. a high temperature >1500 °C and a high pressure of nitrogen gas), and the broad-band emission of Eu2+ also makes them unsuitable for wide-color-gamut backlighting.
On the other hand, Mn4+-doped A2MF6 (A = Li, Na, K…, M = Si, Ge, Ti…) fluoride red phosphors, with the advantages of room temperature synthesis and narrow-band emission, have attracted considerable attention in recent years.11–16 In the meantime, this kind of phosphor also shows promising photoluminescence properties including high quantum efficiency, less emission longer than 650 nm and small thermal quenching, making them conspicuous candidates to fabricate high luminous efficiency and color rendering wLEDs. However, most of these fluoride phosphors are quite sensitive to moisture, leading to severe decrease of their luminescence and the lifetime of the fabricated wLEDs.17–20 Therefore, it is essential to improve the moisture resistance of the Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors.
Typically, it is a feasible approach to form a protective layer on the phosphor surface to improve its stability. A layer of SiO2 or carbon was used to protect phosphors against outside attacks.21,22 In the case of the Mn4+-activated fluoride phosphor, its easy hydrolysis makes it hard to apply an aqueous method to prepare the protective layer. Alternatively, organic layers were coated on the phosphor for surface modification.23–25 Zhou et al. prepared a water-resistant K2TiF6:Mn4+ (KTF) phosphor by coating a surface layer of octadecyltrimethoxysilane. The coating layer enabled the phosphor to maintain ∼84% of its luminous efficiency after being dispersed in water for 0.5 h, as compared to ∼44% of the uncoated sample.24 Arunkumar et al. reported a waterproof K2SiF6:Mn4+ (KSF) phosphor by forming a layer of oleic acid, which shows 85% of its initial emission intensity after being aged at 85 °C and 85% humidity for 450 h.25 However, in order to clad an organic layer on the phosphor surface, the usage of organic solvents is unavoidable and the coating procedure is usually complex. Moreover, the endurance of the organic protective layer may not be as good as an inorganic protective layer. As reported by Zhou et al., when compared with the uncoated sample, the improvement in luminous efficiency of the coated one was largely reduced after aging for 1 h.24 Huang et al. constructed a core–shell KTF@K2TiF6 structure with a Mn4+-free shell by the cation exchange method.26 The inert K2TiF6 shell provided the KTF phosphor with superior moisture resistance. However, a large amount of hydrofluoric acid is used during the ion corrosion process, and the cation exchange method is not universal for other fluoride phosphors such as KSF and KGF. Consequently, a non-aqueous, green and efficient method to coat fluoride phosphors with an inorganic shell is highly desirable.
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a gas phase deposition technique based on cyclic alternative self-limiting surface reactions.27 It has been applied to deposit passivation layers for a variety of materials used in solar cells and lithium batteries.28,29 Fang et al. directly deposited a transparent layer on KTF-fabricated wLEDs using the ALD technique, which enhances the reliability of the lighting devices.30 In our previous work, a nanoscale Al2O3 layer was successfully attached on Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ and KSF phosphor particles via ALD in a fluidized bed reactor. The thermal stability of the Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor was enhanced and the hydrothermal stability of the KSF phosphor was also studied.31,32 In this work, we proposed to deposit an inorganic Al2O3 layer on KGF phosphor powders by a moderate ALD technique and investigate the influence of the coating layer on its optical performance and water resistance and the reliability of the fabricated LEDs.
Experiment section
Al2O3 ALD
Al2O3 ALD was carried out in a viscous flow reactor (GEMStar-6 Benchtop ALD, Arradiance) at 80 °C. Trimethylaluminium (TMA, Nanjing MO Yuan Scientific Instruments & Materials Co. Ltd) was used as the aluminum precursor, and O3 was chosen as the oxidizer. Ultrahigh purity N2 (UHP, 99.999%) was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 150 mL min−1. After the commercial KGF phosphor (Xi’an Hongyu Optoelectronic Technology Co. Ltd) was spread into the ALD reactor, different cycles of Al2O3 ALD were carried out with a timing sequence of 30, 50, 10, and 50 s for TMA exposure, N2 purge, O3 exposure, and N2 purge, respectively. The number of coating cycles was set as 10, 20, 30 and 50.
Characterization
The phase composition was examined by X-ray diffractometry (Bruker D4 Endeavor, Germany). The morphology of the KGF particles and the SEM-EDS elemental mapping were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SU-70, Hitachi, Japan). ICP-OES was employed to measure the mass fraction of the deposited aluminum by induced couple plasma optical emission spectrometry (Optima 5300, PerkinElmer, USA).
The excitation and emission spectra were collected using fluorescence spectrometry (F-4600, Hitachi, Japan). The quantum efficiency was measured using a home-built instrument with an integrating sphere (SPL Photonics, China), an LSR-PS-II 450 nm laser excitation source (LASEVER INC, China), and a spectrometer (QE2000 +, Ocean optics, USA). UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectrometry was performed on a UV-3600 Plus spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The decay curves were measured using an FLS-980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instrument, UK) at room temperature. The water resistance test was performed by dispersing 0.1 g of phosphor powders in 0.5 mL of deionized water for various times, then drying at 60 °C for 24 h. The electronic conductivity was measured by using a DDS-120W microprocessor conductivity meter (BANTE, China) using a solution of 0.1 g of the phosphor powder dispersed in 3 mL of deionized water.
Purple LEDs were fabricated by combining a blue InGaN LED chip with the KGF phosphors, and their optical properties and stability were investigated. 0.1 g phosphor powder was mixed with 1.5 g of an organic resin and then mounted on the LED chip. The luminous efficiency of the LED chip (λem = 450 nm) is 6 lm W−1. The fabricated LEDs were naturally cured overnight. The luminous flux and chromaticity coordinates of the LEDs, driven at a current of 40 or 200 mA were recorded by using an EVERFINE ATA-500 auto-temperatured LED opto-electronic analyzer (EVERFINE Corporation, China).
Results and discussion
Microstructures of the Al2O3 coating
SEM images of the uncoated KGF and the Al2O3 coated KGF with 30 cycles are shown in Fig. 1. It shows that the spherical KGF powders have a particle size in the range of ∼25–40 μm and an average diameter (D50) of 32 μm. Meanwhile, the surface of the uncoated KGF is quite smooth. After Al2O3 coating, alumina islands were formed on the surface of KGF according to the corresponding SEM-EDS mapping. Formation of alumina islands instead of a uniform coating layer might be due to the limited nucleation sites on the sample surface.33

As seen in Fig. 2a, the diffraction peaks of the sample w/o the Al2O3 coating are consistent with those of the standard card of K2GeF6 (PDF No. 73 1531). No peak shifts or secondary phases are detected after coating, indicating that the deposition process does not change the phase or the structure of the KGF phosphor. The XRD peaks of the crystalline Al2O3 are not detected in all the coated samples, consistent with the literature that ALD Al2O3 is generally amorphous.27,34 Accordingly, ICP-OES was employed to measure the mass fraction of aluminum deposited on the sample surface (Fig. 2b). The mass fraction of aluminum for samples coated with 10, 20, 30, and 50 cycles is between ∼0.5–2.3%. As reported, the layer thickness can be estimated based on the mass fraction of aluminum, and the ideal growth rate of ALD Al2O3 is ∼0.1–0.2 nm per cycle. Thus, the thickness of the Al2O3 coating should be in the nanometer scale.27,35–37 Meanwhile, it is noticed that there is a linear relationship between the mass fraction of aluminum and the number of coating cycles, and a larger number of coating cycles leads to an increase of the deposited aluminum, indicating that the content of the deposited Al2O3 and the coating thickness can be controlled by changing the number of coating cycles.

Photoluminescence properties of the coated KGF phosphors
The uncoated and Al2O3 coated KGF phosphors exhibit similar profiles of emission and excitation spectra, indicating that the coating does not change the spectral position and shape (Fig. 3a). The excitation spectra of all the samples show two broad excitation bands centered at ∼350 and 460 nm, which originate from the spin-allowed transitions of Mn4+ from 4A2g to 4T1g and 4A2g to 4T2g, respectively. The emission spectra display several asymmetric bands in the range of 600–650 nm, and have the highest emission intensity at ∼633 nm owing to the electronic transitions from the 2Eg to 4A2g state.38 On the other hand, the photoluminescence intensity and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of KGF decrease after the Al2O3 coating (Fig. 3a, b). This can be ascribed to the reduced absorption of the excited photons when Al2O3 is coated on the phosphor surface, which is seen in the UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectra (Fig. 3c). In addition, the Al2O3 coated KGF phosphors with various deposition cycles show an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of ∼82–78% (Fig. 3b), declined by 5–9% when compared to the uncoated sample. This decrease of IQE is probably due to the scattering of Al2O3 and the surface damage of KGF by the highly reactive TMA and O3 during the deposition process.

The uncoated and Al2O3 coated KGF samples have similar reflection profiles and band widths, confirming that the Al2O3 coating has no significant effects on the reflection spectra of the phosphor powders (Fig. 3c). However, the reflectance of the coated samples around 350 and 460 nm is increased with increasing the deposition cycles, indicating that less excited photons can be absorbed by the coated phosphor. This is one of the origins for the decline in the photoluminescence intensity and EQE of the coated samples. It implies that the optical absorption behavior of the phosphors is largely affected by the amount of deposited Al2O3.39 Zhou et al. reported that a thin Al2O3 film of 2 nm can improve the light absorption of Y3Al5O12:Ce3+, whereas a thick film of 5 nm decreases the absorbance of Y3Al5O12:Ce3+.40 This is also true in this work, where a large amount of the deposited Al2O3 hampers the absorption of the incident light and obstructs the emitted light at the same time.
The Al2O3 layer has no influence in the decay behavior of the KGF phosphor (Fig. 3d). All the samples show a single exponential decay curve and a decay time of 6.7 ms, when monitoring the emission at 631 nm under 460 nm. The decay time is in good agreement with the reported ones and is a characteristic of Mn4+.41–43
Water resistance of the coated KGF
To investigate the influence of Al2O3 coating on the water resistance of the KGF phosphor, the emission spectra and IQEs of the samples dispersed in water for various periods were measured (Fig. 4). As seen, the emission intensity of the uncoated KGF quickly decreases with the immersing time in water, and a large loss of 24% occurs after just 10 min (Fig. 4a). For the Al2O3 coated KGF with 30 cycles, the emission intensity is declined by only 6% (Fig. 4b). After 2 h, the uncoated KGF shows 67% of its initial emission intensity, while the Al2O3 coated KGF can still retain as high as 91% of its initial intensity. The IQE of the uncoated KGF largely deceases from ∼86 to ∼55% (i.e., 31% loss) after being immersed in water for 2 h, while it only reduces from ∼81 to ∼70% (i.e., 11% loss) for the Al2O3 coated KGF (Fig. 4c). This demonstrates that the Al2O3 thin layer can effectively protect the KGF phosphor against moisture attack.

As shown in Fig. 4d, the deposition cycle or the layer thickness of Al2O3 will affect the quantum efficiency and water resistance of the KGF phosphor. When the coating cycle reaches 30, the Al2O3 coated KGF shows the highest IQE after being immersed in water, indicating the best water resistance. The samples with smaller or larger deposition cycles have moderate water resistance, because of the less amount of the protective Al2O3 deposited on the phosphor surface, or being over-exposed in TMA and O3 leading to the appearance of cracks on the phosphor surface.
Protection mechanism of the passive layer of Al2O3
It is generally accepted that the poor water resistance of the Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors is due to the hydrolyzation of the [MnF6]2− group to MnO2 hydrate when they are under moisture attacks.17,19 In this work, the following ionization will occur.12K2Ge1−xMnxF6(s) → 2K+(aq) + [Ge1−xMnxF6]2−(aq)
To confirm this, we measured the electronic conductivities of the uncoated and the Al2O3 coated KGF samples (0.1 g for each) immersed in 3 mL of water for different times. As seen in Fig. 5, the electronic conductivity of the uncoated KGF solution is ∼1120 μs cm−1 at first, and then increases to ∼1400 μs cm−1 rapidly within 2 min, which means that the KGF phosphor is immediately decomposed after being contacted with water. After 2 h of immersion, it increases up to ∼1470 μs cm−1. However, the electronic conductivity of the Al2O3 coated KGF solution is much lower, which shows a slow increase from ∼900 to ∼1100 μs cm−1 within 2 min and almost keeps stable after 20 min. This implies that the Al2O3 layer works as a shelter to suppress the ionization or decomposition of the KGF phosphor in water.
 Fig. 5  Electronic conductivities of the uncoated and Al2O3 coated KGF solutions as a function of time in water. 
As shown in Fig. 6a, once the uncoated KGF powders are dispersed in water, the aqueous solution gradually turns light brown and finally dark brown particles are precipitated from the solution after 2 h, while for the Al2O3 coated KGF with 30 cycles, the aqueous solution is visually transparent and no changes are observed within 2 h (Fig. 6d). In addition, the dark brown particles have a totally different morphology from the pristine KGF and a much bigger size of ∼180 μm with plenty of agglomerates attached (Fig. 6b). The elemental mapping shows that the elements of potassium, germanium and fluorine are detected in the dark brown particles and signals of manganese and oxygen are detected in these agglomerates but not in the bulk (Fig. 6c). Therefore, it can be concluded that the uncoated KGF phosphor powders are decomposed in water, and the [MnF6]2− group is hydrolyzed to manganese oxide, followed by the recrystallization of the KGF particles into a new shape. However, the Al2O3 coated KGF retains its original morphology (Fig. 6e). Moreover, when a drop of water is dropped on the phosphor surface for 10 min, the color of the uncoated KGF particles turns dark brown, whereas that of the Al2O3 coated ones is slightly changed (Fig. 6f), which further evidences the enhanced water resistance of the KGF phosphor by the Al2O3 layer.

Based on the above observations, we proposed a protection mechanism of the KGF phosphor coated with the passivation layer of Al2O3 (Fig. 7). Under moisture attack, the pristine KGF phosphor powders start to dissolve and ionize, and the ionized [MnF6]2− is hydrolyzed to manganese oxide, finally resulting in the decrease of the luminescence of the phosphor. In the meantime, when the KGF particles are recrystallized from the solution, their morphology changes from an original sphere into irregular blocks with a much bigger size. On the other hand, the Al2O3 coating deposited on the phosphor surface can isolate the phosphor from the water, thus suppressing the ionization and hydrolysis of the KGF phosphor, and improving the water resistance.

LED aging test
The uncoated or the Al2O3 coated KGF powders were combined with commercially available 450 nm LED chips to prepare purple LEDs. The LEDs were driven under 40 mA and 200 mA for different periods, respectively (Fig. 8). As shown, when aged under 40 mA for 2800 h, the luminous flux of the LEDs fabricated with the uncoated powders decreases from 9.3 to 7.0 lm (i.e., 25% loss), whereas it slowly reduces from 9.25 to 8.1 lm (i.e., 12% loss) for LEDs using the coated ones. When aged under 200 mA for 80 h, the luminous flux decreases much faster, and is ∼65% of its initial value for LEDs using the uncoated KGF (8.8 to 3.1 lm), and ∼28% of its initial value for those with the coated one (8.7 to 6.3 lm). In both cases, the coated KGF phosphor enables the fabrication of longer lifetime and higher stability LEDs with less aging loss and smaller shifts in chromaticity coordinates. This demonstrates that the Al2O3 protective layer produced by ALD allows effective improvement of the reliability of the KGF phosphor and the LEDs (especially high-power LEDs).

Conclusions
In this work, an Al2O3 coating layer was successfully deposited on the KGF phosphor surface using the ALD technique. The thickness of the deposited Al2O3 can be controlled by the number of coating cycles, and the photoluminescence intensity and quantum efficiency of the coated phosphor are slightly decreased due to the reduced absorption. The uncoated KGF phosphor is easily decomposed by water, with the [MnF6]2− group hydrolyzed to manganese oxide and the morphology re-constructed. The Al2O3 protective layer suppresses the decomposition and hydrolysis of the phosphor and therefore greatly improves its water resistance. The coated phosphor with a deposition cycle of 30 shows the best water resistance. Thanks to the enhanced stability of the coated phosphor, the reliability of LEDs fabricated using it can also be remarkably improved. This indicates that the ALD technique is an interesting way to improve the water resistance of the KGF phosphor and may also enhance the thermal or chemical stability of other phosphors when the coating materials and the deposition parameters are carefully selected or controlled.
