    , Accepted 2nd June 2017First published on 2nd June 2017AbstractTwo novel small molecular non-fullerene acceptors, BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4, respectively, carrying two and four peripheral perylenediimide moieties, are obtained from appositely functionalized 9,9′-bifluorenylidene and perylenediimide via Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. Owing to their twisted molecular structures, these acceptors possess good solution processability and exhibit relatively weak intermolecular interactions in both solution and the solid state as evidenced from their spectral characteristics. Both display an optical bandgap of 1.94 eV, and their LUMOs as estimated from electrochemical data are −3.83 and −3.92 eV for BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4, respectively. Both can be utilized as a fullerene acceptor replacement in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells with a polymer donor, PBT7-Th, affording reasonable power conversion efficiencies of 2.46 and 4.43%, respectively.
1. Introduction
Solution processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted growing interest owing to their perceived advantages of low costs for mainstream solar energy harvesting adoption, and light weight and structural flexibility characteristics for mobile devices and niche applications.1–5 The most widely used architecture in BHJ-OSCs comprises an active layer of an electron donor (small molecular or polymeric) and a fullerene electron acceptor (e.g., [6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester [PC61/71BM]). To date, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in excess of 10% have been achieved for polymer donor/fullerene-based BHJ-OSCs.6–8 Despite their widespread use as acceptor materials in OSCs, fullerene derivatives have several intrinsic drawbacks such as weak light absorption, poor electronic tunability, tedious purification and high material costs.9,10 In addition, the morphology of active layers with fullerene acceptors changes dramatically with time and temperature due to their propensity to aggregate into larger domains. These limitations have driven researchers to explore for fullerene replacements, both small molecular and polymeric, as electron acceptors for OSCs.
Among non-fullerene acceptors for OSCs, perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives are the most studied candidates for their excellent thermal and photochemical stabilities, strong electron-withdrawing ability and relatively high electron mobility.11–13 However, structurally simple PDI compounds undergo strong intermolecular π–π stacking as a result of their relatively planar molecular structures. This has given rise to their tendency to form relatively large crystalline domains with severe phase separation in the donor–acceptor blended films, and thus poor photovoltaic performance in BHJ-OSCs using these acceptor molecules.14,15 Accordingly, one of the critical design strategies for smaller molecular PDI-based acceptors is to restrain the propensity of PDI to self-aggregate through structural features that offer steric hindrance to excessive intermolecular ordering. Small molecular compounds with structurally twisted molecular features or bulky substituents have been engaged to hamper or minimize the formation of excessively large crystalline domains. For example, many smaller molecular electron acceptors with conformationally twisted peripheral PDI moieties, particularly those with 3D or quasi-3D geometries, have been utilized as fullerene replacements in BHJ-OSCs in varying degrees of success.16–18 These PDI-based acceptors have been utilized to inhibit undesirably excessive aggregation to facilitate isotropic charge transport needed for efficient charge separation. Ma, et al. employed a spiro-bifluorene molecule with four twisted peripheral PDI moieties as an acceptor and achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.26%.19 Likewise, Yan and co-workers recently reported a tetraphenylethylene core with four peripheral PDI units as an acceptor in OSCs with a PCE of 5.53%.20
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two new PDI-functionalized 9,9′-bifluorenylidene-based small molecular acceptors, one with two (BF-PDI2) and one with four (BF-PDI4) peripheral PDI units. In the ground state, 9,9′-bifluorenylidene experiences significant steric strains arising from excessive H1–H1′ and H8–H8′ steric interference, leading to a somewhat spirally twisted conformation.21,22 9,9′-Bifluorenylidene accordingly behaves as if it is an electron deficient entity in that gaining an electron would transform it into a radical anion, breaking up its intervening double bond into a single bond to provide its two fluorenylidene moieties some rotational freedom to relieve steric strains. The electron accepting capability of 9,9′-bifluorenylidene can be supplemented or modulated through PDI functionalization. It is thus an appealing candidate for constructing an electron acceptor design for use as a fullerene alternative with low-bandgap polymer donors in BHJ-OSCs. Our 9,9′-bifluorenylidene-based acceptors, when used with a common low-bandgap polymer donor, PTB7-Th, afforded a PCE of about 4.5%, which is comparable to that of bifluorenylidene-based acceptors recently reported.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and measurements
All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. N,N′-Bis(1-hexylheptyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylbisimide (PDI-Br) was prepared according to the reported procedures (ESI†).1 All the reactions were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ultrashield 400 Plus NMR spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted on a TA Instruments Q5000IR at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen gas flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a TA 2920 analyzer. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 20 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI 600 electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode cell in a deoxygenated anhydrous dichloromethane solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) under a nitrogen atmosphere. A platinum disk electrode, a platinum wire, and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively, with a polymer thin film coated on the surface of the platinum disk electrode for evaluation. The CV curves were calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard, which was measured under the same conditions before and after the measurement of samples.
2.2 Fabrication and characterization of OPV Cells
The device configuration of experimental BHJ-OSC devices used in the evaluation was ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The solutions for the active layer were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of PTB7-Th and BF-PDI2 or BF-PDI4 in chlorobenzene with or without 3 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene. The solution was spin-coated on ZnO-coated ITO glass, and dried in vacuo before MoO3 (2 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were thermally deposited as the anode under 10−6 Torr. The active area of the device was about 9 mm2. The devices for PCE and EQE measurements were encapsulated in a glove box and measured under ambient conditions. A SAN-EI XEC-301S solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp and an air mass AM 1.5G filter was used to generate a simulated AM 1.5G solar spectrum irradiation source. The irradiation intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell VS 0831. A monochromator WDG30 and Bentham DH-Si silicon detector were used in external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements.
2.3 Synthesis of BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4

2.3.1 General synthetic procedure for BF-Bpin2 and BF-Bpin4. 
2,7-Dibromo-9,9′-bifluorenylidene (or 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-bifluorenylidene) (0.5 mmol), bis(pinacolato)diboron (2.2 or 4.2 equiv.) and KOAc (10 equiv.) were dissolved in dry 1,4-dioxane (6 ml) in a flask. The reaction solution was degassed for 15 min and then Pd(dppf)Cl2 (0.05 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 48 h under N2 atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the reaction mixture was subjected to solvent removal under reduced pressure. Subsequently, 20 ml of CH2Cl2 was added to the residue and the resulting solution was washed twice with water and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The residue after solvent removal under reduced pressure was purified by column chromatography using hexane:dichloromethane (v/v = 1:3) as an eluent. The final product was recrystallized from dichloromethane/methanol as an orange solid.

2.3.2 General synthetic procedure for BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4. 
A mixture of BF-Bpin2 (or BF-Bpin4) (0.5 mmol) as obtained above, Br-PDI (2.2 or 4.3 equiv.), Pd(Ph3P)4 (0.05 mmol), K2CO3 (8 equiv.), 10 ml THF and 4 ml H2O was heated to 85 °C and stirred for 48 h. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and extracted using dichloromethane, washed with water and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. Subsequent solvent removal under reduced pressure gave a residue which was purified by column chromatography using hexane:dichloromethane (v/v = 1:2 ∼ 1:3) as an eluent to give the final product as a red solid.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The syntheses of BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 are outlined in Scheme 1. Both BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 were synthesized by Suzuki coupling of an N-alkyl bromoperylenediimide derivative, Br-PDI, with the corresponding intermediates, BF-Bpin2 or BF-Bpin4, in reasonable yields of 33% and 45%, respectively. Both products were fully characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF-MS spectroscopy. In view of their relatively twisted molecular structures, both BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 had shown reasonably good solubility in common organic solvents such as toluene, dichloromethane, and chloroform.

3.2 Thermal properties
The thermal properties of BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The decomposition temperature (weight loss > 5%) of both products under nitrogen atmosphere was determined to be more than 350 °C, indicating that they have good thermal stability (ESI†, Fig. S1). The DSC study showed that there were no obvious melting and crystallization peaks in the range of 50–300 °C, revealing the amorphous nature of BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 (ESI,† Fig. S2).
3.3 Optical properties
The solution (chloroform) and thin-film UV-vis absorption spectra of BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 are shown in Fig. 1 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The solution absorption spectra of BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 displayed strong absorptions in the spectral region of 400–650 nm, and both also exhibited similar vibronic splitting features in an approximately similar wavelength region in both solution and thin film. Of particular significance was the observation that both compounds showed no obvious spectral shifts from solution to thin film, indicating that intermolecular interactions between the molecules for both compounds in both solution and thin film were weak at best, and that there was no appreciable molecular aggregation. These observations were in agreement with the severely twisted structures of BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4. The optical bandgaps calculated from the absorption onset for both compounds were around 1.94 eV.

3.4 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane solution. The cyclic voltammogram is presented in Fig. 2 and the results are summarized in Table 1. The measured reduction potentials (vs. Fc+/Fc) were primarily related to the reductions of PDI and 9,9′-bifluorenylidene structures. As expected on the basis of the degree of PDI substitution, BF-PDI4 displayed a lower reduction potential of −0.53 V than BF-PDI2 whose reduction potential was measured to be −0.62 V. The corresponding LUMO energy levels of BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 were calculated to be −3.83 eV and −3.92 eV respectively. Thus, the HOMO levels for BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4, as calculated from the difference between the LUMO level and optical band gap, were −5.77 and −5.86 eV, respectively. As the LUMO and HOMO levels of both compounds were essentially comparable to those of fullerene derivatives, they would thus be able to serve as electron acceptors for OSCs on the basis of energetic considerations.

3.5 Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic device performance
The photovoltaic performance characteristics of experimental BHJ-OSC devices with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag using PTB7-Th:BF-PDI2 or PTB7-Th:BF-PDI4 blended films as active layers were investigated. A study of the donor:acceptor (D:A) ratio by weight revealed that the optimum D:A ratios for both BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 were 1:1 by weight (Table S1, ESI†). Using chlorobenzene as a processing solvent, the devices with active layer compositions of 1:1 by weight of PTB7-Th:BF-PDI2 and PTB7-Th:BF-PDI4 afforded PCEs of 1.92% and 3.75%, respectively. In addition, the utilization of an appropriate amount of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as a processing additive also led to dramatic PEC improvements of the devices. In general, addition of CN into the active layer coating solutions greatly enhanced the photovoltaic performance of the resulting OSC devices (see Table S2, ESI†). In particular, using 3 vol% CN and chlorobenzene as the processing solvent, the PCEs of the PDI2 and BF-PDI4 devices with an active layer D:A composition of 1:1 by weight improved significantly to 2.46% and 4.43%, respectively (Table 2). As can be noted from Table 2, the PCE enhancements were primarily related to significant improvements in their FF.

While the BF-PDI2 devices provided a higher Voc owing to its higher LUMO, the BF-PDI4 devices had nonetheless performed much better overall. This could likely be attributable to a higher 3D molecular geometry of BF-PDI4 as a consequence of higher degree of PDI substitution. The 3D molecular geometry was less prone to excessive intermolecular aggregation and thus more conducive to isotropic charge transport, leading to increased Jsc and thus higher PCE. The observed improvement in current density of BF-PDI4 devices was also reflected in its external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 3b), showing generally higher EQEs than those of devices with the BF-PDI2 acceptor over the whole 350–750 nm spectral region. In addition, the EQE spectra of these OSC devices exhibited relatively broad photo-responses over the entire visible region (∼300–800 nm), implying that the light absorptions by both the acceptor (BF-PDI2 or BF-PDI4) and donor (PTB7-Th) had contributed to current generation.

4. Conclusions
Two new PDI-functionalized 9,9′-bifluorenylideneacceptors, BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4, have been developed for BHJ-OSCs. By virtue of their severely twisted molecular structures, these compounds exhibited reasonably good solubility in common organic solvents despite the fact that these are fused-ring aromatics which generally possess limited solubility characteristics. Spectroscopically, both BF-PDI2 and BF-PDI4 absorb strongly in the 400–600 nm spectral region, and thus complement low bandgap polymer donors such as PTB7-Th for efficient harvesting of solar energy in the visible to near-infrared region. Thin films of PTB7-Th with BF-PDI2 or BF-PDI4 can be readily solution fabricated for use as active layers in BHJ-OSCs. Under appropriate fabrication conditions, BHJ-OSC devices using these acceptors and PTB7-Th as a donor have afforded a respectable PCE of significantly over 4%. We strongly believe that, with a proper choice of compatible polymer donor, the BF-PDI4 acceptor can serve as an excellent fullerene replacement for BHJ-OSCs.
