    , Accepted 15th January 2014First published on 15th January 2014AbstractIn this work, we have synthesized CdS quantum dots and also supported CdS nanoparticles on ZSM-5 type metalosilicates (ferrisilicate and aluminosilicate) as CdS–metalosilicate composites. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production over the prepared catalysts was investigated. It can be observed that the synthesis of CdS quantum dots by a solvothermal method results in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of this semiconductor in comparison to other procedures, which has been reported previously. Our objective was to improve the photocatalytic activity of our synthesized CdS nanoparticles; for this purpose, we have supported CdS on metalosilicates and investigated their photocatalytic activity. These composites show high efficiency for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. This suggests that, due to the high surface area of metalosilicates, the effective and homogenous dispersion of CdS particles on the external surface or within the pores of metalosilicate can be achieved by supporting the nanoparticles which inhibits the agglomeration of the formed semiconductor. We have thus distinguished that supporting of CdS nanoparticles leads to improvement of the photocatalytic activity in water reduction; so that the hydrogen production rate for CdS–metalosilicate composite was about 11 mmol h−1 gcat−1; which is significantly higher than that of unsupported CdS nanoparticles.
1. Introduction
Issues relating to energy and environmental problems are important topics that must be tackled at a global level in the 21st century. This can be assigned to the depletion of the world's fossil-fuel resources as well as the increasingly critical environmental problems resulting from the consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new, advanced catalytic materials to resolve several critical problems related to the environment and energy. Hydrogen can be considered as a standard fuel for future energy requirements because of not only having a high calorific value, but also using it as an energy source results in only water, which is harmless as compared to carbon dioxide (CO2), the usual and common combustion product.1,2 The production of hydrogen by photocatalytic water splitting is an environmentally consistent process for photochemical conversion and storage of solar energy.3
Utilization of solar energy is a very interesting aspect of science. The development of semiconductors as efficient photocatalysts which can harvest solar light energy, separate the photo-generated electron–hole pair and cause a redox reaction on the surface, is a critical point in order to put photocatalytic water splitting into practice.4,5 Sulfides, such as CdS, ZnS–CuInS2 solid solutions, etc., have narrow band gaps and valence bands at relatively negative potentials, which present them as good visible-light driven photocatalytic activities in the presence of sacrificial reagents.6 It is noteworthy that sulfide photocatalysts are not applicable for water splitting; because of the induction of photocorrosion in which photogenerated holes oxidize the photocatalyst itself. However, the presence of sacrificial hole scavengers, such as sulfide and sulfite ions suppresses the photocorrosion and improve the photocatalytic activity for water splitting under visible light irradiation.7 Although chalcogenide semiconductors usually have the disadvantage of photocorrosion, some tactics, such as incorporation of metal sulfides into mesoporous materials,8,9 hybridizing with conductive polymers,10 combining with co-catalysts,11 and forming solid solutions12 have been used to stabilize the metal sulfides and improve their efficiency for hydrogen production. Here, we have decided to use the first approach to suppress photocorrosion. In this paper, our main purpose was to synthesize CdS–metalosilicate composites and study their photocatalytic activity in comparison with pure and unsupported CdS nanoparticles. Firstly, we have thus reported the synthesis and characterization of CdS nanomaterials by a facile solvothermal method in ethylene glycol without the use of any surfactant. The effects of temperature and reaction duration on the crystallinity of the CdS nanoparticles were investigated. This procedure was efficient in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts, in contrast with other procedures which have been reported previously. Secondly, we have used metalosilicates (ferrisilicate and aluminosilicate) as support and synthesized the composite form (CdS–metalosilicate) using an efficient procedure. It should be mentioned that we have exploited metalosilicates as supports for the purpose of CdS photocorrosion inhibition and enhancement of uniform distribution of CdS on metalosilicates; and this leads to an improvement the photocatalytic activity of the prepared CdS nanoparticles.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Cadmium acetate (dihydrate), thiourea, ethylene glycol, ethanol, were purchased from the Merck Company. Aluminosilicate and ferrisilicate was prepared in our laboratory.13,14
2.2. Synthesis of photocatalysts

2.2.1. Synthesis of CdS. 
2.2.1.1. Solvothermal reaction. 
In a typical synthesis, 1 mmol Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.266 g) was dissolved in 40 mL ethylene glycol (EG) and a colorless solution was formed. Then 2 mmol thiourea (SC(NH2)2, 0.152 g) was added into the above-mentioned solution under vigorous stirring for 30 min. Afterwards, the solution was transferred into a 60 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 150 °C for 12 h in an oven. Then the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature. Finally, the products were centrifuged and washed with distilled water and ethanol three times, respectively, and dried at 60 °C for 4 h. The product was referred to as cub-CdS (cub referred to the cubic phase of CdS). The dried powder was calcined at 673 K for 4 h. The resultant product was denoted as hex-CdS (hex referred to the hexagonal phase for CdS). The reaction conditions were varied to explore the effect of different reaction parameters on the size and crystallinity of the products.
2.2.1.2. Effect of reaction temperature. 
The similar above-mentioned procedure was followed at a constant molar ratio of Cd:S (1:2) with varying the temperatures; at 140 °C, 150 °C and 160 °C. Other reaction conditions were the same as Section 2.2.1.1.
2.2.1.3. Effect of reaction duration. 
The similar above-mentioned procedure was followed at a constant molar ratio (1:2), but the reaction time was varied at different durations: 8, 12, and 24 h. Other reaction conditions were the same as Section 2.2.1.1.


2.2.2. Preparation of metalosilicates. 
Metalosilicates (aluminosilicate and ferrisilicate) was prepared using the procedures of our previous works.13,14


2.2.3. Synthesis of CdS–metalosilicate composites. 
2.2.3.1. Procedure (1). 
At first, the Cd-exchanged form of metalosilicates was prepared using a liquid ion exchange technique. For this purpose, 1 mmol Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.266 g) was dissolved in 50 mL ethylene glycol (EG) and a colorless solution was obtained. Then, 1.5 g of the metalosilicate sample was added into the mentioned solution. The resultant slurry was sonicated for 1 h. Afterwards 2 mmol thiourea (SC(NH2)2, 0.152 g) was added to the reaction mixture and the mixture was then refluxed at 80 °C for 3 h. Finally, the products were centrifuged and washed with copious amount of distilled water and ethanol three times, respectively, and dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight. This composite was referred to as CdS(I)/F1 or as CdS(I)/Z1 the case of using ferrisilicate or aluminosilicate (ZSM-5 zeolite), respectively. (“I” referred to the preparation conditions of the Cd-exchanged form of metalosilicates using a 0.02 M solution of Cd(CH3COO)2); F and Z referred to the type of metalosilicate: ferrisilicate and aluminosilicate (ZSM-5), respectively and the subscript number is related to the type of procedure: “1” referred to Procedure 2.2.3.1 and “2” related to Procedure 2.2.3.2. The composites which were denoted as CdS(II)/F1 and CdS(II)/Z1 were synthesized using the same procedure except for using a 0.03 M solution of Cd(CH3COO)2 for the preparation of the Cd-exchanged form of the metalosilicates.
2.2.3.2. Procedure (2). 
A solid state dispersion method was used for preparation of the CdS/Z. The SSD method initially involves thorough mixing of CdS (0.09 g) and aluminosilicate (ZSM-5) (1.5 g) using ethanol in an agate pestle and mortar; the solvent was then removed by evaporation while mixing. The prepared photocatalyst was denoted as CdS(I)/Z2.

2.3. Characterization of photocatalysts
The XRD patterns of all powder samples were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (D500 Siemens) using a Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation source (30–40 kV and 40–50 mA) in the range of 2θ = 4–70°. Crystallite sizes (D, in Å) were estimated from the Scherrer equation: D = Kλ/βcosθ(1)where λ is the wavelength of Cu Kα radiation, β is the corrected half-width of the diffracted peak, θ is the angle, and K is equal to 0.9.
The products have been characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM). TEM studies were carried out on a Zeiss LEO 912 Omega instrument, operating at 120 kV. TEM specimens were made by evaporating one drop of solution of sample in ethanol onto carbon-coated copper grids. Grids were blotted dry on filter paper and investigated without further treatment. BET surface area were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm at liquid nitrogen temperature using a Chembet-2000. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs combined with EDAX data were carried out on an LEO-1430VP scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded in air at room temperature in a wavelength range of 200–800 nm using a Scinco 4100 spectrophotometer.
2.4. Evaluation of photocatalytic activity
Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a side-irradiation-type Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. The photocatalytic reaction was performed by taking 0.05 g of powder photocatalysts in 50 mL of deionized water containing both 0.25 M Na2SO3 and 0.35 M Na2S as sacrificial agents inside the reactor for H2 evolution. The solution was kept under stirring with a magnetic stirrer, preventing particles from settling at the bottom of the reactor and producing a homogenous suspension. Prior to irradiation, the reactant solution was first evacuated for 45 min to ensure complete removal of air by purging with argon gas. The suspension was irradiated by a tungsten filament bulb of 500 W (Osram) lamp through a transmitting glass filter (λ ≥ 420 nm), and the irradiation power after the filter was measured to be 55 mW cm−2. The illumination intensity of the lamp was ∼10000 lux, as determined with a MS-1300 A luxmeter. The temperature of the reactants reached about 70 °C during the hydrogen production process in the presence of light.15 The reaction was carried out for several hours after which the gas collector was closed tightly and detached from the reactor. Then the amount of hydrogen evolution was analyzed using a GC/TCD equipped with a Molecular Sieve 5A column. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was calculated by the eqn (2). The number of incident photons per cm2 was estimated according to literature.2 A 450 nm band-pass filter and a fiber optic spectrometer were used in measurements. (2)
3. Result and discussion
3.1. X-Ray diffraction
XRD patterns of pure CdS nanoparticles and the CdS–metalosilicate composites, are depicted in Fig. 1. All the diffraction peaks of Fig. 1a and b can be easily indexed to cubic zinc blende and hexagonal structures of CdS, which are consistent with the standard data of cubic CdS (space group F4h3m; JSPDS Card No. 10-0454) and hexagonal CdS (space group P63mc; JSPDS Card No. 41-1049), respectively. As can be seen, hex-CdS (which has been obtained by heat treatment of cub-CdS) has higher crystallinity in comparison with the cubic phase so, annealing at high temperature (in this case 673 K) leads to phase transformation and enhancement of crystallinity and size of obtained particles. Thus, the high-temperature annealing of CdS leads to the formation of the hexagonal wurtzite phase, which is known to be a more active phase, than the cubic zinc blende phase.16 The effects of different factors such as temperature and duration time in the solvothermal process for the synthesis of cub-CdS were investigated. Using XRD patterns of these samples (Fig. 2 and 3), it can be realized that the optimum process for synthesis of crystalline CdS can occur at 150 °C in 12 h. The average size of cub-CdS and hex-CdS was estimated by analysis of XRD data using the Scherrer equation. The obtained crystallite size is 7.6 nm and 18.8 nm for cub-CdS and hex-CdS, respectively (Table 1). Calculated values of crystallite size by the Scherrer equation using XRD data almost confirmed the results of TEM observations. Curves e–h in Fig. 1, exhibit the comparative XRD profile of the synthesized CdS photocatalyst over metalosilicate as support. For comparison purposes, the corresponding XRD patterns of the virginal CdS and pure metalosilicate are included in curves a–d, respectively of the Fig. 1. It is important to note that the reflections related to CdS crystal phases are found to be broadened considerably because of little CdS loading, indicating the presence of highly dispersed nanoparticles of poor crystallinity. Thus, the phase of the CdS particles is not detectable. Also it is noteworthy that the crystallinity of metalosilicates would be decreased, and the relative intensity of three strongest peaks has been changed, although the inherent framework structure of the supports was maintained after loading of CdS. It should be mentioned that in the case of using Procedure (2) for synthesis of composites, the observed decrease in crystallinity of metalosilicate is less than that of using Procedure (1). This is good evidence for the incorporation of CdS in the structure of metalosilicates. However, the characteristic peaks of CdS nanoparticles cannot be indexed, so the CdS crystallite size cannot be calculated by the Scherrer equation. In fact, the crystallite size in the samples with a CdS loading of less than 10% over metalosilicates is beyond the XRD sensitivity (Fig. 1, curves g–k).

3.2. Optical absorption spectra studies
Optical absorption behavior of all the photocatalysts was investigated by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra, for the neat and supported CdS photocatalysts. Fig. 4 shows the optical absorption spectra of neat and supported CdS form on ZSM-5 type metalosilicates (aluminosilicate and ferrisilicate). From the optical absorbance spectra, it was clearly observed that all the prepared photocatalysts are active under visible light irradiation. It was observed that with incorporation of CdS, in the structure or on the surface of metalosilicate, the absorption edge of the photocatalysts was slightly shifted towards shorter wavelengths in the case of CdS(I)/metalosilicate; this was due to the uniform distribution of CdS and the quantum size effect;17 which leads to a extension of the band gap energy. The band gap energy of all the prepared photocatalysts can be calculated accurately by using Kubelka–Munk function (the following equation).18 αhν = C1(hν − Eg)n(3)where α, ν, C1, and Eg are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, proportionality constant, and bandgap energy, respectively. In the above equation, n decides the characteristics of the transition in a semiconductor, i.e. n = 1/2 for direct transition and n = 2 for indirect transition. The method to evaluate the value of n was been reported elsewhere.19,20 Using this method, the calculated value, n = 1/2, characterizes a direct optical transition for the photocatalysts. The Kubelka–Munk function was applied to convert diffuse reflectance measurements into the equivalent absorption coefficient.21 α = (1 − R)2/2R(4)where α is optical absorption coefficient near the absorption edge for direct interband transitions, R is the reflectance of the semiconductor, R = 10−A, and A, is optical absorbance. αhν = C1(hν − Eg)1/2(5) hν = 1240/λ(6)where C1 is the absorption constant for an direct transition, hν is photon energy (eV), Eg is the direct bandgap energy (eV), and λ is the wavelength (nm).

Fig. 5 shows the (αhν)2 plotted versus hν and the vertical segment of the spectra is extended to intersect the hν axis (x-axis) by means of extrapolating the straightest line to the hν axis intercept to obtain the direct bandgap (Eg) value of the measured samples.22 The calculated bandgap energy for all the prepared photocatalysts together with other physical properties and elemental analysis and also the average rates of hydrogen evolution during the first 4 h are compared in Table 2.

3.3. Elemental analysis
Elemental analysis (Table 2), which was performed using EDAX analysis to evaluate the content of cadmium sulfide in the metalosilicate matrix or on their external surface, reveals that the experimental values are in agreement with the theoretically calculated values. This result confirms that the procedure was successful in supporting the CdS nanoparticles on the metalosilicate.
3.4. BET surface area analysis
The BET surface area of the prepared photocatalysts has been determined and represented in Table 2. It can be observed that, due to composite formation, the specific surface area of the metalosilicate decreases. This could possibly be related to blockage of pores. It is also noteworthy that the surface area of the CdS–metalosilicate composite enhances with an increase in the loading amount of CdS. This can be an indirect evidence for successful support.
3.5. Morphology studies
The surface morphology of the samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The SEM images are shown in Fig. 6. It can be observed that the surface morphology of the cub-CdS particles is comprised of near-spherical, agglomerated, nanometer-sized particles. In the case of CdS(I)/Z1, CdS(I)/Z2 and CdS(I)/F1, (Fig. 6d–f and h) SEM images show the distribution of CdS nanoparticles on the surface of ferrisilicate and aluminosilicate, respectively. For the purpose of comparison, the SEM image of aluminosilicate and ferrisilicate before loading of CdS has been presented in Fig. 6c and g, respectively.

Fig. 7 shows TEM images of cub-CdS and hex-CdS nanoparticles, which illustrated the agglomeration of nano-sized particles. The size of cub-CdS and hex-CdS particles can be estimated as 8 nm and 15 nm, respectively, using TEM images.

3.6. The mechanism of formation and growth of nanocrystalline CdS
According to the literature,23 it is believed that the reaction mechanism of cadmium salts and thiourea in ethylene glycol as the solvent to produce nanocrystalline CdS, can be summarized as below: In the first stage, the strong complexation between Cd2+ and thiourea results in the formation of a Cd–thiourea complex,23–25 which prevents the release of a large amount of free S2− in the solution and will be favorable for the formation of the desired products. On the basis of our experiments and observations, the cadmium salt solution is colorless and, furthermore, after adding thiourea and stirring for a reasonable time the color of the solution does not change and the solution remains clear; so this confirms that an intermediate complex between thiourea and cadmium(II) has been formed. At the second stage, by heating the solution and then performing a solvothermal process, the color of the solution turns to yellow; indicative of CdS nanoparticles formation by undergoing thermal decomposition. The reaction taking place can be expressed as follows:  
It is worth pointing out that in this synthesis process ethylene glycol as a solvent is acting as both a reaction media and dispersion media, and also can efficiently adsorb and stabilize the surface of the particles26 and promote the production of monodispersed metal sulfide crystals with good dispersivity.26 Meanwhile, ethylene glycol with a high permanent dipole, takes up the energy from the solvothermal process and causes the polar reaction solution to heat up to a high temperature immediately.27,28 All of this provides assistance for the decomposition of the mentioned M–thiourea complex and the production of nanocrystalline CdS during the solvothermal process.
In general, the growth process of crystals contains two stages: an initial nucleating stage and a subsequent growth stage. The essential factor responsible for the final morphology of the products is the crystallographic phase of the seed formed during the nucleation process,29 which depends on the nature of the material and the environmental conditions. The formation of agglomerated morphology can be rationalized on the basis of the above investigations on varying the reaction through the stages as shown in Fig. 8. At the initial stage, CdS nuclei are formed in ethylene glycol. In the subsequent step, these nuclei are grown preferentially in the different direction and further transferred into CdS nanosphere owing to the same surface energies of the cubic crystal structure. On increasing the reaction duration time, sphere like structures self-assemble to form microspheres and then the microspheres aggregate to result in an agglomerated morphology. Therefore, nanospheres were the constituting units of the agglomerated morphology.

3.7. Photocatalytic hydrogen production
Photocatalytic activity of synthesized photocatalysts was quantitatively investigated by photocatalytic H2 evolution from the suspension of photocatalysts in an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 and Na2S for 4 h irradiation using visible light. The results presenting the amount of hydrogen generated in mmol h−1 gcat−1 are given in Fig. 9 and Table 2. As shown in Fig. 9, it can be observed that the maximum hydrogen generation of 11.1 mmol h−1 g−1 of photocatalyst has been obtained for CdS(I)/F. This value is very high as compared with the values reported for other visible-light active photocatalysts, such as CdS/ETS-4 which gives 175 μmol H2 h−1 gcat−1.30 Moreover, according to Fig. 9, it can be deduced that the photocatalytic activity of cub-CdS is enhanced significantly by supporting them on metalosilicates (aluminosilicate or ferrisilicate) in comparison with an unsupported sample.
 Fig. 9  The average rate of hydrogen evolution for synthesized photocatalysts. 

3.7.1. Effect of metalosilicate as a support. 
Metalosilicate as a suppor, can offer a very high surface area and also provides an effective and homogenous dispersion of CdS particles on the external surface or within the pores of its structure. So the specific surface area of CdS nanoparticles, can be enhanced by means of a support as shown in Table 2. Moreover, the metalosilicate structure with electron-accepting and donating properties, can play an important role in the control of charge transfer process.1 In order to highlight the role of the metalosilicate not only as a support for stabilizing CdS species but also as an active charge-transfer-assisting component in enhancing the overall efficiency of the synthesized material, different products with or without metalosilicate have been synthesized and according to evaluation of the rate of hydrogen evolution in the water reduction process, we can understand the effective role of the support in this reaction. According to the results, it can be observed that in the case of supporting CdS on metalosilicate the efficiency of the photocatalyst increases significantly for cub-CdS.


3.7.2. Effect of the type of CdS phase. 
According to Fig. 9, it can be observed that the average rate of hydrogen evolution of hex-CdS (hexagonal wurtzite phase) with high crystallinity was faster than that of cub-CdS (cubic zinc blende phases). This again seemed to be the effect of CdS crystallinity as previously reported.16 In addition, the high crystallinity of CdS will reduce surface defects in the crystals, which play the role of recombination centers for photogenerated electrons and holes.17 Indeed, it was reported that hex-CdS can show higher activity for the oxidation of aqueous electrolyte solutions containing S2− or SO32− compared to cub-CdS.31


3.7.3. Effect of CdS incorporation mode. 
In order to understand the effect of the preparation method we have synthesized the cub-CdS(I)/Z1 composite with two different methods and observed that the Procedure (1) (see Section 2.2.3.1), which used ion exchange in order to incorporate CdS in the structure of metalosilicate, can lead to formation of a more efficient photocatalyst in comparison with that of the solid state dispersion (SSD) method (CdS(I)/Z2) (see Section 2.2.3.2).


3.7.4. Effect of CdS loading. 
In order to understand the role of metalosilicate in photocatalysis as a support for stabilizing different species, we have synthesized a CdS–metalosilicate composite with different ratios of CdS/support and observed that by decreasing amount of support (or increasing the amount of CdS), the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst will be decreased significantly; this confirms the effective role of support in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst in the hydrogen production process by virtue of the quantum size effect (see Fig. 9).


3.7.5. Proposed mechanism for hydrogen production in the presence of sacrificial reagents. 
The photocatalytic activity over various synthesized photocatalysts for hydrogen production, is shown in Fig. 9. The reaction was performed with an aqueous solution containing 0.35 M Na2SO3 and 0.25 M Na2S as sacrificial reagents (hole scavengers) under visible light irradiation. Based on the above discussion, a tentative reaction mechanism has been proposed for photocatalytic process, as illustrated in Fig. 10.
 Fig. 10  Illustration of the proposed reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic process. 
The first primary reaction is the photoinduced reaction on the semiconductor, which includes excitation of CdS electrons from the valence band to the conduction band: CdS + hν → e−(CB) + h+(VB)(7)
The second reaction is the reduction of protons of H2O to H2, using photogenerated electrons. H2O + 2e−(CB) → H2 + 2OH−(8)
The photogenerated holes are utilized in order to oxidize sulfide ion to elemental sulfur or disulfide anions: SO32− + H2O + 2h+(VB) → SO42− + 2H+(9) S2− + 2h+(VB) → S(10)
Elemental sulfur can participate in one of the following reactions: S2− + h+(VB) → S22−(11) S + SO32− → S2O3(12)
Afterwards, the products can react with each other (if both of them occur) (eqn (13)) or otherwise, sulfite anion can react with disulfide or sulfide ion and produce thiosulfate ion (eqn (14) and (15)): S2O3 + S22− → S2O32− + 2S(13) S22− + SO32− → S2O32− + S2−(14) SO32− + S2− + 2h+(VB) → S2O32−(15)
The formation of S22− is significantly suppressed by reaction with SO32− according to eqn (12). However, the H2 production can drop because of the excess consumption of SO32− and S2− ions. Therefore, it is necessary to replace fresh sacrificial reagents solution in each photocatalytic reaction run. The production of S2O32− is colorless and does not compete with the photocatalyst for light absorption. The presence of excessive S2− in the reaction solution inhibits the formation of sulfur defects and stabilizes the photocatalyst.6,32,33


3.7.6. Stability test. 
The stability of a catalyst is an important feature that ensure its durability during photocatalytic hydrogen generation.34–36 Photocatalytic stability tests were conducted for CdS(I)/M1 samples. To evaluate the photostability, the photocatalyst after the first run of 4 h of the hydrogen production process, was stored overnight, then separated from the suspension, and then the recovered photocatalyst was used for the second and third run of photoreduction under the same conditions with a fresh solution of sacrificial reagents. According to the results (Fig. 11), the photocatalytic activity of the mentioned sample was changed to 11.7% and 25.1% for CdS(I)/F1 and CdS(I)/Z1 catalysts, respectively; the decreased activity could be ascribed to the probable coverage of active sites by the reaction products during overnight storage.
 Fig. 11  The average rate of hydrogen evolution for CdS(I)/F1 and CdS(I)/Z1 in stability test. 
In order to explore this further, XRD, FTIR, SEM and DRS analyzes were performed on the recycled catalysts. The results are presented in Fig. 12, Fig. S1–S3 (ESI†), respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 11, for the recycled catalysts, crystallinity decreases significantly. For CdS(I)/F1, the weakening of the peaks’ intensity is similar and obvious for all characterization peaks of the support, however the intensity of the CdS peaks is constant to some extent. In contrast, however, for CdS(I)/Z1, the intensity of some characterization peaks of the support decreases more significantly than the others. Thus, the intensity of the peaks related to the reflections of some planes like (241) and (600) at 2θ ≈ 20.90 and 2θ ≈ 26.67, respectively,37 remains intact to some extent. Therefore the observed decreases of crystallinity are not similar. However, the same as CdS(I)/F1, the intensity of the CdS peaks is constant approximately. In order to explain this, it can be considered that a small amount of metal oxide or free cation could be released from the support, derived from the partial degradation of the metalosilicate support was due to the reduction of a small number of Al or Fe ions in its structure in the presence of hydrogen gas as a reductant. The FTIR spectra of recycled catalysts are almost similar to those of the fresh samples (Fig. S1, ESI†). The SEM images (Fig. S2, ESI†) reveal that the morphology of the CdS(I)/F1 sample is preserved after recycling, in contrast with the CdS(I)/Z1 sample. This is consistent with XRD analysis results, which confirm that the crystallinity of CdS(I)/F1 sample reduces uniformly in the direction of all planes but for the case of CdS(I)/Z1, the intensity of some characterization peaks reduces less than the others; this leads to disorganization of the morphology of CdS(I)/Z1. The UV-vis absorption spectra (DRS) (Fig. S3, ESI†), show that the absorbance edges of the recycled samples were red shifted (Eg = 2.42 and 2.43 for CdS(I)/F1 and CdS(I)/Z1 catalysts respectively); this was probably because of integration of some separate channels derived from decreasing of crystallinity and thereby agglomeration of some amounts of CdS nanoparticles. Our study demonstrates that the unique structural features of the metalosilicate as a support are essential for the CdS–M composites to maintain both photocatalytic stability and efficiency; which is preserved for a CdS(I)/F1 sample to a greater extent than for CdS(I)/Z1.

4. Conclusions
In summary, CdS quantum dots have been successfully prepared via a facile and surfactant-free solvothermal method. The results show that the reaction temperature and growth time are crucial factors for the crystallinity and size of CdS nanoparticles. These nanoparticles of CdS are formed in the cubic zinc blende phase; performing heat treatment on them at 673 K induces the formation of the hexagonal wurtzite phase of CdS. The hydrogen yield for CdS in hexagonal phase works out to be 9.94 mmol h−1 gcat−1, in visible light. It is significantly higher than that of Cub-CdS, which is 1.66 mmol h−1 gcat−1. Supporting cub-CdS nanoparticles on ZSM-5 type metalosilicate (ferrisilicate and aluminosilicate) leads to a decrease of the CdS particle size and increase of the surface area of the obtained particles, and thereby amplification of the photocatalytic activity of the obtained photocatalysts. Metalosilicate as a support, plays an important role here; it can offer a very high surface area, provides for effective and homogenous dispersion of CdS particles on the external surface or within the pores of its structure and inhibits agglomeration of the formed semiconductor. Moreover, metalosilicate can serve as an electron acceptor which delays the back electron transfer reaction (recombination), and so improves photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts. Supporting cub-CdS nanoparticles raises the hydrogen evolution rate by about 6.5 times in comparison with the unsupported one. The UV-vis spectrum shows that the CdS nanoparticles have a broad absorption band in the visible range of light. CdS–metalosilicate composites have revealed a blue shift for their adsorption edge compared with bare CdS. This can be attributed to the quantum size effect which originates from effective distribution within the structure of support. So, the degree of hydrogen productions was found to be related to the phase of CdS and also the use of a support in a proper ratio in order for effective distribution of the CdS particles.
