    , Accepted 2nd November 2020First published on 2nd November 2020AbstractWater nanofluidics in confined channels has endowed pressure-driven separation membranes with superior permeability. However, the nanofluidics effect in solar-thermal steaming materials is hindered by discrete heat absorbers and nanochannels. Here we report the modular design of solar-thermal nanofluidics membranes by integrating carbon nanotubes and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) through a self-crosslinkable polyelectrolyte under mild conditions. The uniformly dispersed carbon nanotubes permit efficient sunlight absorption for localized heat transfer. Subsequently, water molecules form clusters in the nanochannels of MOF nanoparticles, and the water vaporization enthalpy was reduced by 45% due to water nanofluidics, which was confirmed by both simulation and thermal characterization. As such, mixed matrix membranes exhibited exceptional combination of high evaporation rates (2.56 kg m−2 h−1, under 1 sun irradiation) with stability versus recycling, solvents, solution pH (1, 13) and oil fouling. These findings provide a modular design of MOF evaporators featuring high performance arising from solar-thermal nanofluidics.
Introduction
Water and energy crises are major threats to global sustainability, with 4 billion people worldwide having limited access to safe water.1–3 Materials for efficient energy-water nexus are needed.4,5 Solar-thermal steaming is a green technology which involves designing photothermal materials on water–air interfaces to harness solar energy for localized evaporation.6–10 Solar absorption and water transportation are crucial steps determining evaporation performances.8,11–14 Nanostructured carbons feature broadband solar absorption through the thermalization of optically excited electrons by electron–electron and electron–phonon scattering.9,15–19 As economic and stable heat absorbers, carbons have been regarded as one of the most practical materials for photothermal conversion.5,20–25 Various nanocarbons such as graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes have been composited with tailor-made polymers for task-specific photothermal applications in fields of energy and biological research.19,26–28 In this context, the properties of photon absorbers were modified by using polymers to improve processability, interfaces and microstructures. Nevertheless, when it comes to water desalination, most of the carbons lack confined channels for the activation of water molecules, leading to a moderate evaporation rate compared to hierarchically structured hydrogels.29–31 In addition, hydrophobic carbons are susceptible to fouling that reduces evaporation performance.32 To circumvent these problems, carbon-based composites are needed to facilitate the synergy between light absorption, heat transfer and water transportation. Developing a modular design meeting these needs remains challenging.
Nanochannels in two-dimensional materials and porous frameworks have underpinned the rise of water nanofluidics for ultra-permeable membranes and devices.33–36 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), with well-defined channels for capillary force and a confinement effect,37–41 enable high-performance water nanofluidics in pressure-driven membranes.42–45 When it comes to solar-thermal steaming, however, the vast majority of MOFs suffer from poor light absorption and membrane formation ability. As such, MOFs have been less exploited for solar-thermal applications, in contrast to their popularity in membrane research. Very recently, hierarchical MOF structures with a dark color were pioneered to improve light absorption through two-step nano-engineering.32 Despite the antifouling potential of these MOF structures, the solar-thermal evaporation rate is moderate compared to that of cutting-edge hydrogels.11,46,47 We envisioned that the potential of MOF channels could be unleashed by enhancing the solar absorption of MOFs, which is accomplishable through the rational design of MOF-based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Though MOF-based MMMs are established for nanofluidics in separation membranes such as nanofiltration,48 they have not been reported for solar thermal steaming.
In this work, we report a modular strategy to devise MOF-based MMMs for solar-thermal nanofluidics with improved light absorption and water evaporation. A self-crosslinkable polyelectrolyte was designed to knit carbon nanotubes (CNTs, light absorber) and MOF nanoparticles (water nanochannels) under mild conditions. Hybrid membranes are hydrophilic and yet very stable in water and under harsh conditions. The CNTs enable efficient solar absorption for water evaporation, while importantly, water clusters form in nanochannels of MOF nanoparticles.49,50 As such, the water evaporation enthalpy in the MMMs was reduced, leading to beneficial combination of high evaporation rates and antifouling ability.
Experimental section
Materials
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a diameter of 35–60 nm and length of ca. 30 μm were purchased from the Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry (China). These CNTs were ball-milled at 400 rpm for 6 h before being used, and the length was reduced to 0.3–1 μm. The cationic polyelectrolyte, poly[1-cyanomethyl-3-vinylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide] (PCMVIM), was synthesized and characterized (Fig. S1†) according to our previous work.51 UiO-66-COOH was synthesized and characterized (Fig. S2 and S3†) according to reported studies.52 Ammonia was purchased from Zhengzhou Alpha Chemical Co. Ltd (China). Simethicone and a lubricating oil were purchased from Huaxia Jujiang Ecommerce Ltd. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF, diameter = 50 mm, pore size = 0.22 μm) filter membranes were bought from Shanghai Zuofei Experimental Equipment Co. Ltd (China). Wastewater was collected from the Huxi river (Wuhan), respectively. Seawater was collected from the South China Sea (near to Hainan). An oil/water emulsion (dimethylpolysiloxane concentration = 10000 ppm) was prepared.
Preparation of UiO-66-COOH/CNTs@PCMVIM (UCP-x) membranes
Typically, 20 mg of UiO-66-COOH was dispersed into 20 mL of PCMVIM solution (concentration: 0.43 mg mL−1) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent. A tailored amount of CNTs was added into the solution. The solution mixture was ultrasonicated for 1 h and filtered onto a PVDF filter membrane. Finally, after being treated in an NH3 atmosphere (0.2 bar) at ca. 25 °C for 14 h, mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were prepared. These MMMs were named UiO-66-COOH/CNTs@PCMVIM, abbreviated as UCP-x, where x denotes the mass content of CNTs in the MMMs.
Interfacial solar steam generation experiments
A solar light simulator (CEL-S500L) was employed to conduct the interfacial steam generation experiment conducted at ca. 30 °C environmental temperature and 50% relative humidity. Typically, the as-synthesized UCP-x membranes with a diameter of ca. 26 mm were put on the surface of a 2 cm-thick polystyrene foam, which was used as the thermal insulating layer and wrapped up by hydrophilic silk to facilitate the diffusion of water to the membranes. The surface temperature of the membranes was constantly monitored by using an infrared thermal imaging camera (DM-I220, Dongmei) during the course of solar steam generation. The water mass change was measured by using an electronic balance (JA2003, Soptop), and recorded in real time. The evaporation rate (kg m−2 h−1) and solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency (%) were calculated using eqn (1) and (2), respectively: Evaporation rate = Δm/(S × t)(1) Solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency = m′ × hLv/3600Pin(2)where Δm is the mass change of water (kg) in 1 h, S is the membrane area (m2), t is the time of solar irradiation (1 h), m′ is the evaporation rate after subtracting the evaporation rate in the dark (kg m−2 h−1), hLv is the latent heat of water vaporization (kJ g−1), and Pin is the incident light power on the absorber (kW m−2).
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
All the all-atom MD simulations were based on a general AMBER force field53 with the RESP charges54 and were carried out using the Gromacs-4.6.7 software package.55 The UiO-66-COOH-water and water–water systems were built with 4.3 nm × 4.3 nm × 4.3 nm, respectively. For the UiO-66-COOH-water system, there are 488 molecules in one-unit cell of UiO-66-COOH, and there are 2349 water molecules in the water–water system. The system is a relaxed liquid configuration at 298 K. The total run time was 15 ns using NVT for the equilibrium MD simulation. We used the relaxed system as a starting configuration. As it is prior to system relaxation MD, energy minimization was carried out with a composite protocol of steepest descent using termination gradients of 100 kJ mol−1 nm−1. A Nosé–Hoover thermostat56 was used to maintain the equilibrium temperature at 298 K and periodic boundary conditions were imposed on all three dimensions. The Particle Mesh–Ewald method57,58 was used to compute long-range electrostatics within a relative tolerance of 1 × 10−6. A cut-off distance of 1 nm was applied to real-space Ewald interactions. The same value was used for van der Waals interactions. The LINCS algorithm59 was applied to constrain the bond lengths of hydrogen atoms. A leap-frog algorithm60 was used with a time step of 1 fs. Based on the analysis for the path of water molecules rooting from NVT, the specific information (i.e., length, numbers and RDF) of different hydrogen bonds was obtained.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed on a Rigaku Smartlab 9 kW X-ray diffractometer at room temperature, in parallel beam geometry employing Cu Kα line focused radiation at 9 kW (45 kV, 200 mA) power. The distribution of surface elements was analyzed using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX, Genesis 2000). 13C CP-MAS NMR measurements were carried out on a 9.4 T wide-bore Bruker Avance III solid-state NMR spectrometer, operating at a Larmor frequency of 100.6 MHz. A 4.0 mm Bruker HX double resonance MAS probe was used. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed with a Tecnai G2 F30 at 200 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted with a SPM9700, Shimadzu. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves were tested in a DSC200 F3 (Germany). The contact angle was determined on an interface viscoelastic measuring device (0CA15EC, Dataphysics).
Results and discussion
Design and characterization of UCP-x membranes
As shown in Fig. 1a, a stable dispersion of UiO-66-COOH, CNTs and PCMVIM in DMF was filtered onto PVDF membranes (5 cm diameter) under vacuum, dried at 25 °C for 2 hours, and treated in an NH3 atmosphere (0.2 bar) at 25 °C for 14 hours. The as-prepared MMMs were named UiO-66-COOH/CNTs@PCMVIM, abbreviated as UCP-x, where x denotes the mass content of CNTs in the MMMs. In addition, the mass ratio of UiO-66-COOH to PCMVIM in all MMMs is maintained at 10:4.3 (Table S1†). The thickness of the UCP layer on PVDF membrane is 13 ± 0.7 μm (Fig. S4†).

The PCMVIM before and after NH3 vapor treatment was characterized by 13C MAS nuclear magnetic resonance (Fig. 1b). A new peak at 168 ppm appears in the NH3-treated polymer, which is assigned to the C signals in triazine rings61,62 formed due to the cyclization of nitrile groups. Nitrile cyclization normally requires harsh catalysts (e.g., trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and sodium hydride) or high temperatures (e.g., 550 °C). Here room-temperature crosslinking is activated by the neighboring imidazolium.51 The coupling of nitriles was also supported by new infrared peaks around 1015 cm−1 and 1660 cm−1 of NH3-treated UCP-10 (Fig. S5†).61 X-ray diffraction peaks of the UCP-10 membranes are identical to those of UiO-66-COOH crystals (Fig. 1c), indicating that the crystalline structures of UiO-66-COOH are retained. In addition, UCP-10 shows improved hydrophilicity compared to CNTs, UiO-66-COOH and PCMVIM (Fig. 1d), which is likely due to the combination of hydrophilic PCMVIM with the nanostructures of UiO-66 and CNTs.
As displayed in Fig. 2a, UiO-66-COOH and CNTs in the UCP-10 membrane are well dispersed, with UiO-66-COOH nanoparticles tightly attached to CNTs. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) examination of UCP-10 reveals that a 3–5 nm-thickness layer of the crosslinked PCMVIM polymer covers the interfaces of CNTs and UiO-66-COOH (Fig. 2b). As such, the interfacial stability of UCP MMMs is effectively enhanced without losing the crystallinity (Fig. 1c) and pore properties (Fig. S6†) of UiO-66-COOH. Here, the tight integration of CNTs and UiO-66-COOH particles is beneficial for the interplay between light absorption, heat transfer and water transportation. This unique structure underpins the solar-thermal nanofluidic effect in the hybrid membrane. In addition, Fig. 2c and d further show the homogeneous distribution of N and Zr elements in the UCP-10 membrane (Fig. S7†), respectively, which confirms the uniform blending of UiO-66-COOH particles.

Both the UCP-10 and control membranes were treated by high-power (40 kHz) ultrasonication in a DMF/H2O mixture for 10 min at 25 °C (Fig. 3a). The NH3-treated UCP-10 remains intact without any visible damages, and the DMF/H2O supernatant after ultrasonication is clear as seen from inserted vials (Fig. 3a, left). By contrast, the top layers of both the untreated UCP-10 and CNTs delaminated from the PVDF support (Fig. 3a, middle and right panels), which is consistent with the charcoal grey color (Fig. 3a, inserted vials) and SEM examinations (Fig. S8†) of the supernatant DMF/H2O mixture. The mass retentions of NH3-treated UCP-10, untreated UCP-10, and CNTs on PVDF supports are 98 wt%, 45 wt% and 40 wt%, respectively. In addition, delamination of the UCP layer was also observed when UiO-66-COOH and CNTs were mixed with non-crosslinkable polymers such as polyethylene glycol, poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylonitrile, and polyethylene glycol methyl ether (Fig. S9†). These results show that the crosslinked PCMVIM serves as a strong “glue” that enhances the interfacial stability.

(b) Photographs of UCP-10 membranes before and after being treated by ultrasonication in pH = 1 and 13 aqueous solutions (top) or acetone/H2O and NMP/H2O (v/v = 1:6) solution (bottom). (c and d) Atomic force microscopy images of UCP-10 membranes before and after ultrasonication treatment in DMF/H2O (v/v = 1:6) solution for 10 min. 
The NH3-treated UCP-10 membranes were stable after consecutive ultrasonication in pH 1 and pH 13 solutions (Fig. 3b, top) and various solvent mixtures (Fig. 3b, bottom) for 10 min. Mass retentions in these cases are as high as 98 wt% and 97 wt%, respectively. Morphology characterization shows that both the CNTs and UiO-66-COOH particles are dispersed uniformly and the phase structures are retained before (Fig. 3c) and after (Fig. 3d) ultrasonication in DMF/H2O solution. These results are consistent with SEM characterization (Fig. S10†), supporting that UCP membranes were effectively stabilized by the self-crosslinked PCMVIM. Here, the mild crosslinking conditions are beneficial for the modular design of composites that reserve properties of pristine building blocks.51
Interfacial solar steam evaporation
The temperature of the UCP-10 membrane, floating on water, remains stable around 43 °C under 1 sun irradiation, close to that of pure CNT membranes under similar irradiation conditions (Fig. 4a). By contrast, the temperature of various control membranes (without CNTs) is lower than 32 °C. In the dry state, the temperature of the UCP-10 membrane is as high as 65 °C, far exceeding that of control membranes without CNTs (<45 °C, Fig. 4b). The surface temperature of UCP-10 is equivalent to that of carbonaceous materials in the literature.9,14,22 The high surface temperature is consistent with the effective light absorption of CNTs (99% in Vis-NIR regions, Fig. S11†). Considering the high MOF contents in the UCP-10 membrane (63 wt%), it indicates that the addition of MOFs and the PCMVIM polymer does not offset the heat absorption of CNTs. This feature, beneficial for effective solar-thermal evaporation, is likely attributed to the enhanced interfaces in the mixed matrix membrane.

The UCP-10 membrane was used for interfacial solar evaporation under 1 kW m−2 irradiation (Fig. S12†). The evaporation rate of the UCP-10 membrane is 2.56 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. 5a, S13 and Video S1†), significantly higher than that of UiO-66-COOH@PCMVIM (UP, 0.95 kg m−2 h−1) or CNTs@PCMVIM-10 (CP-10, 1.72 kg m−2 h−1) membranes. The improved evaporation rate indicates the synergy of CNTs and UiO-66-COOH. That is, the effective light absorption of CNTs (99% in Vis-NIR regions, Fig. S11†) and the elevated surface temperature (Fig. 4) were integrated with high water transportation in UiO-66-COOH nanochannels. In addition, UCP-10 shows the highest hydrophilicity compared with control membranes (Fig. 1d), which also facilitates the surface wetting and transportation of water molecules in the membrane. That is, the evaporation rate of the untreated UCP-10 membrane drops from 2.39 to 1.3 kg m−2 h−1 after ultrasonication. By contrast, the UCP-10 membrane shows stable performance (ca. 2.55 kg m−2 h−1) after either the ultrasonication treatment (Fig. 5a) or 20 hours of continuous solar-thermal evaporation (Fig. 5b). Moreover, both the morphology and structure of the used UCP-10 membrane are similar to those of the fresh one (Fig. S14†). These results confirm that the PCMVIM crosslinking (Fig. 1b) improves the stability of the hybrid membrane. The solar-thermal steaming performance of the UCP-10 membrane is superior to that of the state-of-art materials in terms of evaporation rate, flexibility, and stability (Fig. 5c and Table S2†). The energy conversion efficiency is ca. 80.2%. The total energy consumption including the energy conversion of water evaporation (80.2%), reflection loss (1%), radiation loss (7.5%), convection loss (3.1%), and conduction loss heat (3.5%) under 1 kW m−2 solar irradiation is calculated to be 95.3%, which is close to 100% (Section S1†).

When it comes to anti-acid/base and antifouling abilities, the evaporation rate of UCP-10 maintains around 2.33 kg m−2 h−1 for 10 hours continuous solar-steaming pH 1 and pH 13 solutions (Fig. 6a). The used UCP-10 membrane was continuously tested with waste water, simethicone and lubricating oil emulsion, and the evaporation rate remains above 2.14 kg m−2 h−1 after 50 hours of operation (Fig. 6a). The evaporation rate of seawater is up to 2.39 kg m−2 h−1 and the UCP-10 membrane shows a good self-cleaning ability (Fig. S15–S17†). As shown in the optical images of the condensed water (Fig. S18†), oil drops were completely removed. The excellent antifouling ability was due to the lipophobicity of UCP-10, as characterized by the three-phase contact angle (Fig. 6b). It is seen that the contact angle of a dichloromethane droplet on the water-immersed UCP-10 membrane, CNTs, UiO-66-COOH, and PCMVIM is 153°, 66°, 134° and 143°, respectively. This result is consistent with the hydrophilicity test of these materials (Fig. 1d). Thus, the UCP-10 membrane is lipophobic despite the incorporation of hydrophobic CNTs, which is beneficial for antifouling properties. Moreover, the concentrations of Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ in seawater dramatically decrease from 22197 to 2.3 ppm, 964 to 0.5 ppm, 560 to 0.03 ppm, and 1120 to 0.2 pm, respectively. The rejection efficiency of UCP-10 against these ions reaches up to 99.9% in the solar-thermal desalination process (Fig. 6c).

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for water transfer in UiO-66-COOH
The state and transportation of water molecules in the UCP-10 membrane were studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. When UiO-66-COOH particles were saturated in water, free water molecules diffuse into the nanochannels of UiO-66-COOH and form clusters consisting of ca. 6–8 water molecules (Fig. 7a). Two types of hydrogen bonds are identified, i.e., hydrogen bonds between water molecules within individual water clusters (Fig. 7b, Type-I) and interfacial hydrogen bonds between water clusters and –COOH groups on UiO-66-COOH channels (Fig. 7b, Type-II). The length of type-II hydrogen bonds (1.9–4.6 Å) is longer than that of bulk water (1.5–2.5 Å, Fig. S19†) or type-I hydrogen bonds (1.5–2.8 Å, Fig. 7c). Meanwhile, Fig. 7d shows that the number of type-II hydrogen bonds (0.2 per water molecule, orange line) is much lower than that of free water (1.68 per water molecule, green line) or water clusters (0.98 per water molecule, blue line). The reduced length and number of type-II hydrogen bonds indicate lower energy needed for water nanofluidics in nanochannels.33 As a result, the evaporation enthalpy of water in the UCP-10 membrane should be reduced compared to that of bulk water.

(c) Radial distribution function of the hydrogen bond length calculated from MD simulations at 300 K. (d) Average number of hydrogen bonds in bulk water and water clusters. 
Experimental data support the simulation results. Fig. 8a shows that the enthalpy of water evaporation from UCP-10 is 1.33 kJ g−1 (Fig. S20†). The DSC results in Fig. 8b show that the peak temperature of water evaporation from the UCP-10 membrane is ca. 10 °C lower than that of bulk water. In addition, the enthalpy of water evaporation from the UCP-10 membrane is 1.31 kJ g−1 measured by DSC (Fig. 8b), close to that measured by dark field evaporation (Fig. 8a). Both values are ca. 45% lower than that of bulk water (2.4 kJ g−1).63 Based on these results, the mechanism of solar-steaming is illustrated in Fig. 8c. Sunlight is absorbed by CNTs through the excitation of electrons and their subsequent relaxation, which are transferred to UiO-66-COOH particles. The formation of water clusters in UiO-66-COOH channels would drastically reduce the water evaporation enthalpy. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional structure of CNTs with a high specific surface area can facilitate the transportation of water, resulting in the further reduction of evaporation enthalpy. A similar phenomenon has been observed in a Zr(Ti)O2 nanotube-based solar steam system in the previous work.64 As a result, the water evaporation enthalpy of the UCP-10 membrane is decreased. The evaporation rate of UCP-x first increases and then decreases with increasing CNT content, and the maximum evaporation rate is achieved at 10 wt% CNTs (Fig. S21 and S22†). This phenomenon indicates that solar-thermal nanofluidics correlates with the synergy of heat absorption and water transportation steps.

Conclusions
We reported a facile method to devise solar-thermal nanofluidic membranes featuring a high evaporation rate, structure stability, and antifouling properties. This was accomplished by knitting CNTs with UiO-66-COOH particles through the mild crosslinking of the tailor-made PCMVIM polyelectrolyte. Efficient sunlight absorption by CNTs drives localized evaporation, followed by nanofluidic transportation of water in UiO-66-COOH. The water evaporation enthalpy was reduced by ca. 45% due to the three-dimensional structure of CNTs with a high specific surface area as well as the formation of water clusters in UiO-66-COOH channels. The hybrid membrane displays an evaporation rate up to 2.56 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun irradiation and is among the most efficient photothermal materials. This work offers a new strategy to fabricate flexible, robust photothermal membranes for solar-energy harvesting.
