    , Accepted 13th August 2017First published on 15th August 2017Abstractα-V2O5 nanowires with a layered structure have been fabricated through a two-step procedure. When measured as a pseudo-capacitive electrode with a three-electrode configuration in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions, α-V2O5 exhibits ideal capacitive characteristics with a specific capacitance of ∼238 F g−1 at a high current of 2 A g−1, but poor cycling stability with a continuous drop in the first 2000 cycles before it is maintained. To find possible solutions towards this problem, the energy storage behavior of the α-V2O5 electrode has been carefully investigated. In situ Raman analysis suggests that it is electrolytic hydrated cations [Na(H2O)n]+ rather than anions (SO42−) that are involved in the energy storage process through reversible adsorption/desorption on the surface or intercalation/deintercalation at the interlayer of the (001) planes accompanied by interlayer spacing expansion/contraction. Moreover, the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance results indicate that, besides a reversible mass change, there is a continuous mass loss that may originate from slow dissolution of V2O5, which should bear the main responsibility for the poor stability (initial dramatic drop). Hence, how to inhibit dissolution, such as by coating or adding additives in the electrolyte, is found to be the key approach to improve the stability of V2O5 based electrodes.
Introduction
Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also called supercapacitors, as one of the significant electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs), complementary to electrolytic capacitors, batteries and fuel cells, have been applied to various fields from the collection of sustainable energy (such as wind, solar and tidal energy) to the power of electric automobiles.1 Carbon based electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are one of the two distinct families of supercapacitors, which have been widely used in commercial markets. Their energy storage mechanisms have been well developed in the past ∼50 years from the Helmholtz model to the Gouy–Chapman–Stern (GCS) model.2 For pseudocapacitors, another attractive family of supercapacitors, famous for high energy density (always an order of magnitude higher than that of EDLCs), though they have attracted considerable attention and a lot of active materials have been well investigated in the past few decades, some obstacles are still present in their way to the commercial applications for most of the active materials, such as undesirable cycling stability arising from the crystal structure change, mass loss or inactivation upon cycling. Reversible Faradic reactions or phase changes have been proposed to be responsible for their high energy storage capability. However, fundamental studies on their energy storage mechanisms are still scarce, which is not conducive to effectively mitigating the problems that exist in most of the active materials, e.g., poor stabilities induced by the John–Teller effect or disproportionation reaction in MnOx and mass loss in V2O5.3 To find possible permanent solutions towards these problems, it is necessary to fully understand the energy storage mechanisms of these materials.
In recent decades, not only transition metal oxides,4–8 but also hydroxides,9–11 carbides,12 nitrides13 and phosphates14 have been widely explored as pseudo-capacitive electrode materials. Among them, vanadium oxides have aroused widespread concerns due to various oxidation states in the coordination polyhedra and different metal–oxygen connectivity with rich crystal chemistry.15 Layer-structured α-V2O5, as one of the vanadium oxides, exhibits high appropriateness for electrochemical energy storage owing to its layered structure that is beneficial for the accommodation of ions and the high valance state of V which means accessibility of multiple-electron (2–4 electrons) transfer per one V2O5 during the charge storage/release process. Various nano/micro-structured V2O5 materials serving as pseudo-capacitive electrodes and their electrochemical performance have been reported. The charge storage process of V2O5 has ever been suggested in other reports, which involves the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of electrolyte cations at the interlamination with simultaneous electron transfer16 according to the following reaction:  where M+ denotes alkali-metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, etc.) from the electrolyte and x is the charge amount that V2O5 can store. Zhi et al.17 suggested a 4-electron-transfer process companied by a valence change between V(V) and V(III) and hence a high theoretical capacitance of 2120 F g−1 was estimated. There is also a 2-electron process with a valence conversion between V(V) and V(IV).16
Though V2O5 has a high theoretical capacity, two primary challenges, poor electronic conductivity and low stability in aqueous solutions, still limit its further application. The electronic conductivity of an oxide can be improved by combining with high conductivity materials or doping. The other issue of low stability can be possibly completely resolved only after its energy storage mechanism is fully illustrated. Raman spectroscopy, due to its ability of signal detection with high-resolution both in time and in space, is an effective tool to explore slight crystal structure changes of a material in working condition according to the molecular vibration mode changes. Hence, in situ Raman spectroscopy is always used to explore the energy storage mechanism of a material.
Herein, V2O5 nanowires were fabricated through a two-step procedure. Though α-V2O5 exhibits ideal capacitive characteristics when tested as a pseudo-capacitive electrode with a three-electrode configuration in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions, its cycling stability is poor. To find possible permanent solutions to this problem, the energy storage behavior of the α-V2O5 electrode was carefully investigated. Operando Raman spectroscopy is used to detect its structural change and an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) is used to monitor its mass change during the charge storage/release process. From the in situ Raman spectroscopy results, it is found that it indeed is electrolyte cations (Na+) that are involved in the energy storage process through reversible adsorption/desorption on the surface or intercalation/deintercalation at the interlayer of the (001) planes accompanied by interlayer spacing expansion/contraction. EQCM analysis suggests that besides a reversible mass change, there is a continuous irreversible mass loss that should bear the main responsibility from its initial capacity drop. Therefore, how to inhibit the mass loss, such as by coating or adding additives to the electrolyte, is proposed to be the key approach to improve the stability of V2O5 based electrodes.
Results and discussion
Morphology characterization and phase analyses
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was first used to explore the morphology of the pristine V2O5 obtained after hydrothermal treatment, as shown in Fig. 1b and c. Uniform super long nanowires (in tens μm) with a diameter of about 30–40 nm can be observed. All the nanowires interlaced together and formed a net structure. Some straight wires are bonded together serving as latitudes and longitudes. The structural features of the V2O5 nanowires were investigated using XRD and Raman spectroscopy. In the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1d, five main peaks at 15.36°, 20.25°, 21.76°, 26.18° and 31.02° that can be indexed to the (200), (001), (101), (110) and (301) planes of α-V2O5, respectively (JCPDS 41-1426, orthorhombic crystal system; unit cell parameters: a = 11.498 Å; b = 3.545 Å; c = 4.345 Å),18 can be observed clearly, which is consistent with other α-V2O5 concerned reports.19,20 All the peaks are very sharp and almost no other peaks can be detected, indicating high crystallinity and high purity of the as-obtained α-V2O5 sample. Furthermore, a schematic lattice of the α-V2O5 sample is illustrated and presented in Fig. 1e according to the XRD results. The α-V2O5 sample exhibits a two-dimensional (2D) layered framework along the (001) plane with an interlayer space of 0.4345 nm, which is beneficial for electrolytic ion accommodation. Further, the morphology and crystal structure of the sample were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the low-resolution image, quite straight V2O5 nanowires with a diameter of ∼40 nm can be clearly observed (Fig. 1f), which is consistent with the SEM results. In the high-resolution image, lattice spacing with an interplanar distance of 0.347 nm that is attributed to the (201) plane of α-V2O5 can be seen, further indicating the formation of the target phase.

Raman spectrum of V2O5
The Raman spectrum was also recorded for the sample coated on a carbon glass electrode and placed in the electrolyte at open circuit potential, shown in Fig. 2a. There are mainly 12 bands including shoulder peaks, all of which can be indexed to different vibration modes of V2O5 (consistent with the data estimated from density functional theory (DFT) by Bhandari and Lambrecht,21 assigned in Table 1), further confirming the formation of V2O5 and no phase change when immersed in the electrolyte. Bands 3a and 3b highly related to the combination of V2O5 and H2O are clearly observed,22 confirming the accommodation of water molecules at the interlayers. Moreover, most of the bands undergo a blue or red shift compared with the calculated values, which should be induced by the nanoscaled structure of the sample as well as the intercalation of water molecules and electrolytic hydrate cations.

According to bond length analysis, the structure of α-V2O5 can be viewed as V2O5 chains combined with ladder steps (interchain V–O2 contacts shown by dashed sticks in Fig. 2b), in which O has three different locations (different symmetry) marked in different colours and named as O1, O2, O3. The α-V2O5 mainly contains two types of ladder steps linked by O3. The vibration modes of the ladders (ladder modes, LM) mainly include ladder-breathing, ladder-puckering, V–O1 swinging, ladder-like distortion (parallel to the y-axis) and shear-like distortion (parallel to the y-axis), which are abbreviated as a, b, c, d and e, respectively.
Electrochemical data
The electrical behaviour of the V2O5 electrode was evaluated in a three-electrode system using 1 M Na2SO4 solution as electrolyte. Fig. 3a exhibits cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates from 1 to 100 mV s−1 within a potential window of 0.0 to 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl. All the CV curves exhibit a near-rectangular shape even at a high sweep rate of 100 mV s−1, indicating ideal capacitive properties. Further, according to the power-law relationship between current and sweep rate, i = avb, where a and b are tunable,23 a log(I, peak current) versus log(ν, sweep rate) plot was obtained for both cathodic and anodic peaks, as shown in Fig. 3b. The b-values are calculated to be 0.93 and 0.94 (close to 1) respectively, indicating surface-controlled and ultra-fast kinetics. Besides, the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves at various currents display almost symmetric and linear shapes, implying high reversibility (Fig. 3c). The specific capacity of V2O5 is calculated to be ∼238 F g−1 at a discharge current of 2 A g−1, which is comparable with other reports.24 However, the cycling stability of V2O5 is very poor. An obvious drop can be seen in the first ∼2000 cycles and after that the capacity is maintained in the following 8000 cycles (Fig. 3d). Coulombic efficiency is also presented here, which is ∼100% during the whole cycling test.

In situ Raman spectroscopy of the V2O5 electrode
To explore the energy storage mechanisms of the α-V2O5 electrode, in situ Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor its structural change during charge/discharge cycling and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a is a schematic representation of the configuration used to perform the in situ Raman measurements, which consists a three-electrode system with a glass window to allow the laser to transit through. One spectrum was recorded in every 220 seconds and hence total 21 spectra were obtained in one cycle at a sweep rate of 0.455 mV s−1 in a potential range of 0 to 1.0 V. The corresponding in situ results are shown in Fig. 4b. First, no bands that do not belong to V2O5 can be observed during the charge/discharge process, indicating no new generated inter-phases or species. Second, the intensity of all the bands increases obviously as the potential rises from 0.0 to 1.0 V and decreases when it drops; even some indiscernible bands become clearly visible, such as the bands at 352 cm−1 (band 8) and 324 cm−1 (band 9) assigned to different ladder vibration modes, as seen in Fig. 4c. As we all know, the intensity of the Raman scattered radiation IR is given by:  where ν is the frequency of the exciting laser, IO is the incident laser intensity, N is the number of scattering molecules in a given state, α is the polarizability of the molecules, and Q is the vibrational amplitude.25 According to this formula, only ∂α/∂Q would change with cycling as N, IO and ν are usually constant after the in situ measurement is set up. Therefore, the band intensity evolution mentioned above should mainly be induced by polarizability change due to the electron density change that obviously reduces accompanied by deintercalation of hydrated Na+ upon the increase of positive potential during charging and an opposite change is observed during discharging.26 Third, some bands experience obvious shifts during the CV cycling. The band at 873 cm−1 (named as band 2) that can be assigned to νas(V–O3–V), undergoes a blue shift of ∼25 cm−1 when the potential rises to 1.0 V during the anodic charge scanning and shifts back to its initial position when the potential is dropped to 0.0 V during the cathodic discharge scanning. The Raman band shift should result from the band length change of V–O3–V caused by the compression/expansion of the (001) planes upon deintercalation/intercalation of hydrated Na+ during the charge/discharge process. In addition, band 1a that is assigned to the ν(V–O1) of the A1g mode also exhibited a similar change trend to that of band 2, but much slighter. In contrast, band 12 assigned to LM(a)–LM(c) undergoes a slight red shift during the anodic process.

(d) Position and intensity changes of bands 1a, 2 and 12 upon charge/discharge. 
The mapping mode of the Raman signal evolution with time is also presented here in Fig. 4c. Periodic intensity change can be observed clearly in this image. Besides, to show these changes more clearly, the position and intensity of bands versus charge/discharge potential are plotted in Fig. 4d for three typical bands, 1a, 2 and 12. As described above, both the position and the intensity of these bands experienced periodical changes upon charging/discharging. These in situ Raman results discussed here further confirm the energy storage reaction proposed previously.
EQCM
To further investigate the nature of low stability, an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) test, which is a powerful tool for probing electrochemical processes occurring on active materials attached to a thin quartz crystal by recording the vibration frequency change of the quartz crystal (the configuration is schematised in Fig. 5a), was performed on the electrode. The mass change of the materials is evaluated according to the following equation:  where Δf is the frequency change caused by addition of mass (m) per unit area, f0 is the resonant frequency of the quartz crystal in the fundamental mode (8.000 MHz in our experiment), A is the area of the gold disk (0.205 cm2 for the included crystal), ρ is the density of the quartz crystal (2.648 g cm−3), and μ is shear modulus of the quartz crystal (2.947 × 1011 g cm−1 s−2). According to this equation, the sensitivity factor, Cf, equals to 7.068 × 108 Hz g−1, and one Hz change corresponds to a mass change of 1.41 ng.

The quartz electrode is placed between two gaskets to be sealed and protected from scratching. (b) In situ EQCM results, which reflect mass change trend of the quartz electrode along with one cyclic voltammetry cycle at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The red and black curves are the according results of the before and after long time cycling electrode, respectively. 
The EQCM results during two CV cycles at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 are presented in Fig. 5b. The green curve is the potential change with time and the red curve is the change profile of Δf. As shown in the figure, with the increase of positive potential, Δf increases monotonously, indicating a monotonous loss of the active materials during the charge process (positive charge accumulation process of the active materials) which should correspond to a desorption/deintercalation process of electrolyte ions. Therefore, it should be positive ions (hydrated cations, M+) that are involved in the energy storage process speculated from electrostatic interaction, which is consistent with the operando Raman spectroscopy results. Moreover, the mass loss is much more obvious in the lower potential range (0–0.15 V) than that in the higher potential range (>0.15 V). There is almost no mass change in the high potential range, which is more clearly observed in the second cycle. It means that the mass change is far deviated from linearity, while the charge storage remains almost linear (as reflected in the charge curve of Fig. 3a), which should be attributed to the delaying of adsorption/intercalation of water molecules after the desorption/deintercalation of hydrated cations (M+). An almost opposite behaviour of mass increase was observed during the discharge process, but gentler. However, the mass of the active material does not return to the original value after a full charge/discharge cycling, which means, besides a reversible mass change caused by cation adsorption/desorption, there is an irreversible mass loss that may be caused by dissolution of the active material and this should be the main reason for the low stability. Furthermore, it can be seen that mass loss is slightly reduced in the second cycle and disappeared after about 2000 cycles (black curve in Fig. 5b), which can be attributed to the inhibition of dissolution with the increase of vanadate amount in the electrolyte.
Experimental methodology
Synthesis of V2O5
The synthesis procedure of V2O5 is based on the report of Wu et al.24 More specifically, 10 g of V2O5 (95%, CP, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China) powder was melted in a corundum crucible at 800 °C for 30 min and then directly poured into 600 mL of deionized (DI) water under vigorous stirring. After cooling down, the obtained dark-red solution was transferred into an autoclave with PTFE lining and kept at 180 °C for 48 h. The black powder was finally collected from the bottom of the autoclave after filtration and cleaning with alcohol and DI water several times. The corresponding fabrication procedure of the V2O5 powder is illustrated in Fig. 1a.
Characterization
The morphology of the obtained sample was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi LEO 1530). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was collected by using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Raman spectra ware recorded by using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution system equipped with a semiconductor laser (λ = 532 nm, Laser Quantum Ltd). The in situ Raman signal was obtained in time mapping mode, while a cyclic voltammetry test was performed at a scan rate of 0.455 mV s−1. The in situ Raman cell was a three-electrode system with the as-prepared sample as the working electrode (WE), a Pt mesh as the counter electrode (CE), a Ag/AgCl (Sat. KCl) electrode as the reference electrode (RE), and a glass window on top of the WE to allow the laser to transmit through, as shown in Fig. 4a.
Electrochemical measurements
The working electrode was prepared using the following process: the active material (V2O5 powder), conductive additive, and polytetrafluoroethylene emulsion (PTFE, 60 wt%, Aladdin Ltd) were mixed in a weight ratio of 40:50:10 to form a homogeneous slurry by using a mortar, dip coated onto a carbon glass electrode and dried at 60 °C. For the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) test, the working electrode (WE) was prepared as follows: slurry containing the active material was drop coated onto a gold disk pasted on a quartz crystal, fully dried under an infrared lamp for 12 h, cooled down, and then assembled into the EQCM cell (shown in Fig. 5a), in which it was connected to an oscillator communicating with an electrochemical working station. The quartz electrode (WE) was placed between two gaskets in order to be sealed and protected from scratching. The general electrochemical measurements, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and EQCM measurements were performed using a CHI 400C workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Ltd, China) in a three-electrode system with the same CE and RE in Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte.
Conclusions
This work mainly discusses the energy storage behavior of α-V2O5 during the charging/discharging process. V2O5 nanowires used in the experiment were fabricated through a two-step procedure. Though V2O5 exhibits ideal capacitive characteristics when tested as a pseudo-capacitive electrode with a three-electrode configuration in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution, its cycling stability is poor, especially in the first 2000 cycles. Operando Raman spectroscopy and an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) were used to evaluate the energy storage behavior of the α-V2O5 electrode during the charge storage/release process. From the in situ Raman results, it is found that it indeed is electrolytic cations (Na+) that are involved in the energy storage process through reversible adsorption/desorption on the surface or intercalation/deintercalation at the interlayer of the (001) planes accompanied by interlayer spacing expansion/contraction. The EQCM analysis suggests that, besides a reversible mass change, there is a continuous irreversible mass loss which may be induced by the dissolution of V2O5 and should bear the main responsibility for the poor stability. Therefore, how to mitigate the dissolution, such as by coating or adding additive to the electrolyte, is the critical factor to improve the stability of V2O5 based electrodes.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagram of the preparation procedure for the V2O5 sample. SEM images of the obtained sample in (b) low and (c) higher resolutions. (d) XRD patterns of the as-prepared V2O5 nanowires. (e) Schematic lattice of the α-V2O5 sample with a typical layered structure stacked along the (001) planes. (f) TEM image and (g) HRTEM image of V2O5.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Raman spectrum of V2O5 in electrolyte used here, ∼12 obvious bands indexed to different vibration modes can be detected. (b) Stick-ball model of α-V2O5, in which O has three different locations (different symmetry) marked in different colors and named as O1, O2, and O3. The structure of α-V2O5 is viewed as V2O5 chains combined with ladder steps that are interchained by V–O2 and shown by dashed sticks. The vibration modes of the ladders mainly including ladder-breathing, ladder-puckering, V–O1 swinging, ladder-like distortion (parallel to the y-axis) and shear-like distortion (parallel to the y-axis) are abbreviated as a, b, c, d and e, respectively. The VO1O2–O3–VO1O2 chain is encircled by dashed lines.
