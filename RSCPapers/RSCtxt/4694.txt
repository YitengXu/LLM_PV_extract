    , Accepted 4th April 2011First published on 4th May 2011AbstractLow band gap dyad molecules were prepared that have absorption spectra matched well with the solar spectrum, and the construction of efficient charge transport pathways was observed. Under AM 1.5 illumination, the devices have achieved the highest JSC (4.79 mA cm2) and FF (0.46) in dyad-based organic solar cells to date.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) fabricated by solution processes using π-conjugated materials have attracted much attention as a renewable energy source, owing to their low fabrication cost, light weight, and high flexibility.1,2 To date, the highest efficiency of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures, which are prepared by mixing electron donor and acceptor materials, has reached 7–8% when low band gap polymers and fullerene derivatives are used.3 The large interface between the donor and the acceptor, and the formation of the nanoscale interpenetrating networks that serve as efficient charge transport pathways are considered to be important for high performance in OSCs.4 However, such phase-separated nanostructures are not necessarily well controlled since they are made by simple mixing of two materials and subsequent thermal annealing for a short time. Hence, BHJ systems often suffer from undesirable structural changes such as too much phase segregation, which causes low reproducibility and poor stability in device performance.5–7
Consisting of covalently attached donor and acceptor moieties, dyad molecules have been widely studied with a primary aim of gaining fundamental understanding of charge separation in solution.8–11 Dyads have several advantages over mixed BHJs when used in OSCs; the use of a molecular based system can avoid the many problems with polymers such as molecular weight distribution, batch-to-batch variation, end group contamination, and difficulty in purification.12 Moreover, since the donor and acceptor molecules are connected to each other, phase segregation is suppressed, and higher charge separation, owing to the proximity of the donor and the acceptor, leads to current generation. These characteristics of dyads enable single-component OSCs to be constructed, which is advantageous in terms of nanostructure control and device reproducibility.9 Many research studies have been reported on the synthesis of dyads and their application in OSCs.23 Our group has reported dyad molecules with π-conjugated oligomers and fullerene derivatives.9,10,13 The efficiency has been improved from about 0.1% in early studies to over 1% in recent reports.10 This improvement comes from changes in the design of the electron donor moiety. Introduction of a highly crystalline donor part, namely, oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV), resulted in a fill factor (FF) of 0.44, improved from 0.23 in less crystalline oligothiophene-based dyad molecules.9,10 Crucial problems that must be addressed in order to improve the efficiency of dyad OSCs are low FF and the mismatch between the absorption spectrum of the donor part and the solar spectrum. So far, these shortcomings limit the short circuit current (JSC) and FF of the dyad devices to 3.3 mA cm−2 and 0.44, respectively.10
In this study, low band gap dyad molecules with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units as the donor and a fullerene group as the acceptor were synthesized to match the molecules' absorption spectra with the solar spectrum. The number of thiophene rings in the donor part was varied in order to tune the structure of the films. OSC devices were fabricated, and in this report, the relationship between molecular structure, film morphology, and device performance is discussed.
The chemical structures of the dyads with different lengths of the oligothiophene unit (n = 1–3) are shown in Fig. 1. DPP derivatives are known as excellent dyes,14,15 and have been used as an electron-withdrawing group in so-called donor–acceptor type low band gap polymers and oligomers.16–19Oligothiophene was used as an electron-donating group. Three oligothiophenes with different lengths were synthesized to investigate the influence of the connectivity of the donor part on the film and the charge collection ability. The synthesis of the low band gap dyad molecules is described in the ESI.† Briefly, a methyl group and hexaethylene glycol were attached to the DPP core. The modified DPP core was then connected to the oligothiophenes viaStille coupling.20 Finally, the dyad molecules 4T (n = 1), 6T (n = 2) and 8T (n = 3) were synthesized via the esterification reaction between the DPP–oligothiophene donor part and a fullerene derivative with a carboxylic acid chloride functional group.9 The π-oligomers are attached to the fullerene derivative through a long flexible spacer of hexaethylene glycol, which enables moderate segregation of the donor and acceptor groups, and leads to efficient charge separation and construction of efficient charge transport pathways at the same time.10 After purification by column chromatography and preparative HPLC, the product was identified by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF-MS. The spectral data are available in the ESI.†

The absorption spectra of 4T, 6T, and 8T in chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 2(a). Absorption peaks at around 330 nm correspond to fullerene, and those at around 600 nm correspond to the oligomers. As the number of thiophene units was increased from 4T to 8T, continuous shifts of absorption edges were observed due to the increased π-conjugation length in the donor part. Absorption spectra of the dyads in thin films are shown in Fig. 2(b). Compared with the absorption spectra in the solution in Fig. 2(a), red shifts of the absorption edges and broadening of the absorption width were observed. The absorption spectra of all dyads matched well with the solar spectrum, as shown in Fig. 2(b), owing to the low band gap properties.

The first oxidation (Eox) and reduction potentials (Ered) of the dyad molecules in solution were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were estimated by assuming the Fc/Fc+ potential to be −4.8 eV relative to the vacuum level.17 The results are summarized in Table 1. The LUMO energy levels were almost the same as in PCBM because the acceptor groups have analogous structures. In contrast, the energy levels of the HOMO in the donor became higher-lying as the number of thiophenes increased, owing to the conjugation length in the donor part.

Solar cell devices were fabricated with a simple configuration of ITO/dyad/Ca (20 nm)/Al (30 nm). The solutions of 4T, 6T, and 8T had concentrations of 20, 20, and 15 g L−1, respectively, and the active layers were spin-coated at a spinning rate of 2500 rpm. The active layers were, respectively, 90 nm, 70 nm, and 100 nm in thickness, as measured by surface profilometry. After Ca and Al evaporation, the devices with 6T and 8T dyads were thermally annealed at 110 °C for 5 min under an N2 atmosphere, while the device with 4T dyad was not annealed because the device performance was found in preliminary studies to be degraded by annealing.21 The OSC devices were evaluated under irradiation of simulated solar light (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) through a photomask with an aperture size of 0.06 cm−2.

J–V characteristics of the dyad devices under AM 1.5 illumination are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the performance of each device is summarized in Table 1. As the number of thiophene units was increased in the π-conjugated oligomers, the photocurrent increased from 0.69 to 4.79 mA cm−2; furthermore, FF also increased from 0.25 to 0.46. In contrast, VOC decreased from 0.6 to 0.51 V when the thiophene number was increased. This is because the energy level of the HOMO in the donor part became higher, as determined by CV. Due to low band gap properties and favorable hole transport properties, the device of 8T dyad showed power conversion efficiency of over 1%. In particular, JSC and FF were the highest among dyad-based solar cells.

In the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 3(b), photocurrent response at longer wavelengths can be seen, owing to the low band gap properties, which led to high JSC. Especially in the 8T dyad device, the photocurrent response was extended to 850 nm. Furthermore, when the number of thiophene units was increased from 4T to 8T, the EQE value increased gradually to their highest values, from 0.08 to 0.27. The increase in JSC induced by the change of the absorption spectra was estimated from the normalized UV-vis spectra and the solar spectrum. The results indicate that the broader absorption of 8T compared with 4T should increase JSC by only about 25%. However, the estimated increase was much smaller than the observed enhancement of JSC under solar illumination for 8T (about 7-fold higher than JSC for 4T). Therefore, the major factor in the improved device performance could be a more effective construction of hole transport pathways with a greater number of thiophene units.
Previously, we reported two similar molecular designs of dyads based on oligothiophene (OT) and OPV. In comparison with these molecules, the low band gap properties of 4T–8T led to broader absorption and better matching with the solar spectrum, resulting in the increase of JSC from 0.93 in OT to 4.79 mA cm−2 in 8T. At the same time, by increasing the number of thiophene units in the DPP dyads, FF was improved to 0.46, which is comparable with that of highly crystalline OPV dyad molecules (0.44). These comparisons indicate the possibility of enhancing both the light absorption properties and the charge transport properties of dyads through careful molecular design.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the device surfaces revealed that all the dyad films have featureless flat surfaces (see ESI†). Therefore, no large-scale segregation occurs in the films, reflecting the fact that the donor and acceptor are covalently attached to each other.
In summary, the introduction of a low band gap donor part into the dyad molecule improved the light-harvesting ability. The length of the oligothiophene greatly affected charge transport in the dyad-based solar cells. The performance should be improved by introduction of a larger hole transport part, and this study demonstrates the high potential of donor–acceptor dyads as photovoltaic materials. Further optimization of energy levels could enable realization of higher VOC and JSC,3,22 and highly efficient solar cells based on a single component.
