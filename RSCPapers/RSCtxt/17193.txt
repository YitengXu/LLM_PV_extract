    , Accepted 2nd January 2020First published on 3rd January 2020AbstractThe intrinsically poor stability of three-dimensional (3D) α-CsPbI3 perovskites (PVSKs) greatly hinders their application in solar cells and optoelectronics. Here, we propose a new series of compounds, quasi-2D Dion–Jacobson (DJ) CsPbI3 PVSKs, through density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The material design is based on periodic intercalation of tailored ethylenediamine cations (EDA2+) between the inorganic layers. The resultant quasi-2D (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs exhibit fundamentally enhanced stability, owing to the strong I–H interaction of diamine cations with a shortened interlayer distance (∼3.5 Å). Their bandgaps can be widely and linearly tailored from 2.150 (n = 1) to 1.476 eV (n = ∞) with the increase of the inorganic layer number (n). In comparison to the conventional 3D counterparts, they have smaller effective masses, lower exciton energies and larger dielectric constants. Furthermore, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) is calculated to be 20.9% (n = 50), evidencing that the quasi-2D DJ CsPbI3 PVSKs could be an excellent candidate for exciting applications in optoelectronic devices.

New concepts
Among the community of metal halide perovskites (PVSKs), the all-inorganic α-CsPbI3 counterparts have attracted extensive interest in optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes and solar cells. Unfortunately, their intrinsic phase instability greatly hinders their potential applications. One of the emerging approaches is to convert the traditional 3D bulk analogues into two-dimensional (2D) layered PVSKs, by intercalating organic amine cations between the inorganic layers. However, to date, few research studies have focused on Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phases with one-layer divalent organic cations between inorganic layers. Herein, we report the concept of organic intercalation engineering for Dion–Jacobson (DJ) quasi-2D α-CsPbI3 PVSKs, by stacking inorganic slabs between the inorganic layers. Such a strategy could endow the CsPbI3 PVSKs with fundamentally enhanced stability, as well as linearly and widely aligned bandgaps, which might be meaningful to direct the exploration of advanced CsPbI3 PVSK materials. This evidences that the simulated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction solar cells based on quasi-2D α-CsPbI3 PVSKs is up to 20.9%, underscoring their bright future for exploring high-performance optoelectronic devices.

Introduction
The celebrated organic–inorganic halide perovskites (PVSKs), e.g. CH3NH3PbI3, have great potential in serving as solar cell absorbers.1–3 However, the volatility of CH3NH3+ causes intrinsically severe thermal instability, which greatly hinders their long-term device applications. In comparison, the all-inorganic cubic counterparts (α-CsPbI3) hold much better thermal stability with suitable and tunable bandgaps, which has inspired exciting applications in various optoelectronic devices, e.g., their photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) in solar cells recently reached 18%.4 Unfortunately, the small size of Cs+ cannot sustain the corner-sharing [PbX6]4− octahedra well, leading to an unsatisfactory tolerance factor. Correspondingly, the crystal structure distortion and/or corner-sharing framework breakdown make α-CsPbI3 (Eg = 1.73 eV) undergo easy transformation to non-perovskite δ phase (Eg = 2.82 eV) with poor photovoltaic properties at room temperature,5–7 which is recognized as the grand challenge for the further application of α-CsPbI3.
One of the emerging strategies to overcome their poor stability is to convert traditional 3D bulky counterparts into two-dimensional (2D) layered PVSKs, which is based on the intercalation of organic amine cations between the inorganic layers.8 2D PVSKs have the general formula of A′mAn−1MnX3n+1 (A′: an intercalated monovalent (m = 2) or divalent (m = 1) organic cations; A: MA+, FA+, Cs+; M = Pb2+, Sn2+; X: I−, Br−, Cl−; n: the number of the inorganic layer). In 2D PVSKs, the intercalated organic cations could act as the spacers in bulky PVSKs, preventing the distortion of the [PbX6]4− octahedra, and thus improving their stability with tunable optoelectronic properties. The quasi-2D PVSKs can be mainly classified as Ruddlesden–Popper (RP, m = 2)9,10 and Dion–Jacobson (DJ, m = 1)8 phases. So far, most of the reported quasi-2D CsPbI3 PVSKs are RP phase, which is based on two layers of monovalent organic cations intercalated between inorganic layers. However, distinctively different to the RP ones, the DJ PVSKs feature divalent ones, thus requiring just one interlayer.11–15 Accordingly, in comparison, the DJ PVSKs have the unique advantage of shortening the interlayer distance with enhanced interaction between interlayers, which endows them with better physical performances.13,15
Here, we report a strategy for organic intercalation engineering of DJ quasi-2D α-CsPbI3 PVSKs by stacking inorganic slabs with inorganic layer numbers (n) ranging from 1 to 8. The ethylenediamine cations (EDA2+) with two NH3+ ligand tails are intercalated into 3D α-CsPbI3, leading to the desired construction of DJ quasi-2D (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs. It is discovered that the DJ quasi-2D CsPbI3 PVSKs possess enhanced thermodynamic stability, as compared to the pristine 3D counterparts. Furthermore, their bandgaps exhibit an interesting linear dependence on the inversed inorganic layer number (1/n), which has important implications for designing high-performance PVSK devices.
Results and discussion
The geometrical models for intercalating EDA2+ cations and the calculated lattice parameters are given in Fig. S1 and Table S1, respectively (ESI†). The a and b are elongated with the rise of n (n = ∞ refers to the pristine α-CsPbI3), indicating the less distortion of the lattice with larger n values. To illustrate the structural variations, the Pb–I bond lengths (RPb–I), as well as the I–Pb–I and Pb–I–Pb bond angles (referred to ∠I–Pb–I and ∠Pb–I–Pb, respectively) are plotted as a function of n as shown in Fig. 1. The bonds and angles are classified into equatorial (parallel to inorganic slab) and apical (vertical to inorganic slab) categories (Fig. 1a and b), which present the in-plane and out-of-plane distortion of the lattice, as shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively.16 The evolution of the equatorial, apical and averaged ∠I–Pb–I, ∠Pb–I–Pb and RPb–I is summarized in Fig. 1e–g. The average angles of quasi-2D (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs (n ≥ 2) increase up to a planar angle of 180° and the average RPb–I converges to that of α-CsPbI3 with the rise of n, indicating that the lattice distortion gradually becomes weaker with the increase of n. Owing to the intercalation of organic ligands, the inorganic Pb–I octahedra are clarified into two categories, i.e. outer and inner ones (Fig. S2, ESI†). The variation of ∠I–Pb–I, ∠Pb–I–Pb and RPb–I in the PVSKs shows more distortion in the outer inorganic layers than the inner bulky layers for a given n (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†). The detailed bond lengths and angles of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs are listed in Tables S2–S8 (ESI†). The interaction of EDA ligands with inorganic octahedra results in lattice distortion, which is weakened as the inorganic layer becomes thicker. Fig. 1h discloses that the variation in ∠Pb–I–Pb accounting for the rotation of [PbX6]4− octahedra makes the major contribution to lattice distortion, and the changes of ∠I–Pb–I and RPb–I cause the distortion of the [PbX6]4− octahedra. In addition, the bending of ∠Pb–I–Pb results in the rotation of [PbX6]4− octahedra around the central Pb2+ cation. Accordingly, n = 4 is regarded as the turning point with a significantly reduced lattice distortion for quasi-2D CsPbI3 PVSKs (Fig. 1h). The unique feature of the PVSK with n = 4 contributes to the obviously enhanced buffer effect of the inner bulk layers on the force moment (Fig. S5, ESI†) and its structure without confinement.17

Fig. 2a displays the calculated formation energy (ΔHform) of quasi-2D (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs as a function of n. As the organic cation gets intercalated, the quasi-2D PVSKs exhibit enhanced stabilities, as implied by the negative ΔHform with respect to the 3D ones. As for the case of n ≤ 4, the ΔHform decreases dramatically with the rise of n, suggesting that the increase of interlayer numbers could significantly enhance the stability of quasi-2D PVSKs with small n values. The ΔHform begins to increase slowly with the rise of n up to 50, and then increases rapidly with the further rise of n. Therefore, in comparison to those with n < 4 and n > 50, the (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs with 4 ≤ n ≤ 50 have much more improved stability than the pristine 3D α-CsPbI3. Furthermore, the decomposition energy (ΔHdecom) is also calculated as shown in Fig. 2b. The ΔHdecom of α-CsPbI3 approaches nearly zero, indicating its intrinsic instability. However, the quasi-2D PVSKs have much higher ΔHdecom, evidencing their fundamentally enhanced phase stability. The calculated ΔHdecom and ΔHform suggest that the stability of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs has been significantly enhanced by increasing n, and then decays slightly, followed by being maintained at a considerable level when n is smaller than 50. The most stable one is achieved at n = 4, which could be regarded as the optimal inorganic layer number for the best phase stability, owing to its significantly reduced lattice distortion (Fig. 1h). As a result, the PVSKs could be divided into two groups, i.e. the PVSKs (n < 4) with heavy lattice distortion and the PVSKs (4 ≤ n ≤ 8) with light lattice distortion. For the PVSKs with n < 4, the differentiation of lattice distortion is significant and the PVSKs with n = 1–3 exhibit much more distortion than those with n = 4, representing their much better stability. Compared to the PVSKs with n < 4, the PVSKs with 4 ≤ n ≤ 8 exhibit similar lattice distortion (see Fig. 1g and h). Under this circumstance, the intrinsic difference among these PVSKs is the change of n. Smaller n means more organic cations, thus bringing stronger interaction between the organic cations and inorganic layers, which contributes better phase stability. Therefore, the decomposition energy of PVSKs with n = 4 is higher than the counterparts with n = 5–8, implying that those with n = 4 are the most stable structure. To evaluate their enhanced effect, the dynamic stabilities of cubic (α) and orthorhombic (δ) CsPbI3, and (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–5) PVSKs are calculated at 300 K for 5 ps via ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation. Their energy changes are plotted in Fig. 2c, and their structural variations before and after the AIMD simulation of 5 ps are shown in Fig. S6–S14 (ESI†). The remarkable energy augment and the broken [PbI6]4− octahedra for α-CsPbI3 disclose its instability with easy transformation to δ-CsPbI3 at room temperature (Fig. 2c and Fig. S6, ESI†). In comparison, δ-CsPbI3 PVSKs are stable at 300 K (Fig. 2c and Fig. S7, ESI†), in accordance with the experimental observations.7 Interestingly, the energy curves of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs with n = 1–5 show the balance with a negligible fluctuation and very slight structural variation after AIMD simulation of 5 ps (Fig. S8–S12, ESI†), evidencing their fundamentally improved dynamic stability similar to δ-CsPbI3.

The enhanced stability could be mainly attributed to the critical role of EDA2+ in DJ α-CsPbI3 PVSKs with two terminal NH3+ groups occupying Cs+ sites and crosslinking quasi-2D inorganic layers. The ligands are mainly bonded with inorganic layers, forming a strong hydrogen-bonding network. Viewing along the inorganic layers (Fig. 2d and e), all of the H+ of –NH3+ cations form I–H bonds with I− anions. As shown in Fig. 2e, these H-bonds connecting with the bridging and terminal I− will give rise to in-plane and out-of-plane tilting, respectively, contributing to the lattice distortion and stretched bonds, as shown in Fig. 1. The I–H bonds enable a strong interaction between organic and inorganic layers, which reduces the freedom of atom relaxation, thereby inhibiting the α-CsPbI3 phase transformation. The strong I–H chemical interaction competitively leads to reduced I⋯I distance (∼3.9 Å) of the terminal I− between the inorganic layers, which essentially defines the interlayer distance (∼3.5 Å), as one of the shortest distances compared to the other quasi-2D PVSKs (Fig. S13, S14 and Table S9, ESI†).18–20 For example, it is 8.2 Å for RP phase (BA)2CsPb2I7 (Fig. S13, ESI†) and 7.1 Å for (BA)2MA4Pb5I16.18 Notably, the shortest interlayer distance reported so far for DJ quasi-2D PVSKs is ∼4.0 Å.13 Besides, the propane-1,3-diammonium cation (PDA2+) intercalated PVSKs with different n ranging from 1 to 4 (Fig. S14, ESI†) are calculated to disclose the effect of alkyl chain length on interlayer distance. As shown in Fig. S14 and Table S9 (ESI†), the interlayer distances of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 are obviously shorter than those of (PDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1, regardless of the rise of n value. Fig. S15 (ESI†) presents the band structures and the corresponding effective masses of quasi-2D α-CsPbI3 PVSKs (n = 4) intercalated by organic cations with different alkyl chain lengths. With the increase of chain length, the bandgap gradually gets smaller, which can be attributed to the reduced lattice distortion. The limit of chain length before the performance dramatically declines is supposed to be 6-C-atom diamine cations (i.e. NH2(CH2)6NH2) (Fig. S15c, ESI†). Therefore, the features of diamine cations and short chain length contribute to the strong I–H interaction network with shortened interlayer distance, which accounts for the enhanced phase stability of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs.

Fig. 2f, g and Fig. S16–S24 (ESI†) show the calculated partial charge densities at the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs. The charge distribution with quite higher density around terminal I− verifies the stronger electronic coupling, in spite of the organic blocking layers, as shown in Fig. 2g. The projected density of states (PDOS) for six couples of I and H (of NH3+) with I–H bonding as well as those pairs of I and H without chemical interaction are plotted in Fig. 2h and Fig. S25 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2h, all of the peaks of H-s orbitals completely overlap with those of I-s, p ones. These PDOS analyses suggest that all of the six I–H bonds have strong coupling with an average I–H bond length of ∼2.56 Å, indicating the strong interaction between inorganic and organic interlayers. As presented in Fig. 2i and Fig. S26 (ESI†), the peak position, density and area of two terminal I (I76–I80) completely overlap with each other, indicating the considerable coupling of I–I bonds. That is to say, the I–I interaction further strengthens the interaction between the inorganic layers, which consequently improves the phase stability of quasi-2D DJ PVSKs. Besides, the close I–I distance allows the efficient charge transport between the interlayers,15 as illustrated by the arrows in Fig. 2f and g. In addition, it also plays a crucial role in tailoring the electronic band structure of these PVSKs.

Fig. 3a displays the calculated band structures of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs following the high symmetry k-point path edging M → Γ → X → R → Z → A (Fig. S27, ESI†), clarifying the nature of direct bandgaps of quasi-2D CsPbI3 PVSKs (except n = 2 and 8). Although the PVSK with n = 8 has an indirect bandgap, the energy of the CBM or VBM at Γ and Z is almost equal (|ΔEB| = 0.0002 eV, see Table S10, ESI†), and the distance between Γ and Z is as small as 0.009 Å−1. Accordingly, these PVSKs (except n = 2) are all direct bandgap semiconductors, regardless of the change in n values. Among those PVSKs with a direct bandgap, their CBM and VBM are located at the Γ or Z point. The lattice expansion in the c-axis direction of the unit cell of PVSKs directly causes a reduced symmetric operation in reciprocal (k) space, making Γ gradually approach Z, thus driving the movement of the VBM and CBM from Γ to Z. It is found that their bandgaps (Eg) could be tailored from 2.150 (n = 1) to 1.497 (n = 50), and finally to 1.476 eV (n = ∞)21 with the increase of n. More interestingly, the Eg shows a highly linear behavior, which can be fitted by Eg = 1.231n−1 + 1.473 (n ≥ 2, n is an integer) (Fig. 3b). The highly linear dependence of Eg(n) on 1/n holds a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.994, except the single-layer PVSK (n = 1), which has quite different geometric and electronic structures. Remarkably, their bandgaps can thus be linearly aligned via EDA2+ intercalation engineering by controlling the inorganic layer numbers of n, implying a meaningful guidance on designing versatile PVSKs. The calculated CBM, VBM and Fermi energy of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs (Fig. 3c) illustrate the downshift of the CBM and upshift of the VBM. This band alignment is type-I (funnel-like) (Fig. 3d),22 which has interesting applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs).23 In the energy funnel effect, the photo-generated electrons and holes can easily move from the PVSKs with smaller n to those with larger n, and the accelerated radiative recombination improves the light-emission efficiencies of LEDs. Furthermore, if the VBM energies are aligned in the same way as the CBM, the electrons and holes will move to the PVSKs with larger and smaller n, respectively, constructing the type-II band alignment (see Fig. S28, ESI†) with enhanced PCE in solar cells.24,25 Briefly, the present quasi-2D PVSKs exhibit unique and interesting potential applications in photoelectric devices.

Fig. 4 provides the calculated electronic structures of inorganic and organic layers. It is well known that 2D PVSKs are self-assembled quantum-well (QW) structures, with the organic and inorganic layers acting as the insulating barrier and well layers, respectively.23,26–28 To investigate the contribution of s, px, py, and pz orbitals of EDA2+, Cs+, Pb2+ and I− ions on the band structures, the decomposed band structures of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 (taking n = 50 as an example) PVSKs are analyzed in Fig. S29 (ESI†). The decomposed bands verify that the inorganic Pb–I octahedra make a dominant contribution to those states around the bandgap, while the organic ligands and Cs+ ions dominate those states with higher energy levels (<−5 eV vs. VBM). The VBM is composed of strongly coupled Pb-6s and I-5p orbitals, wherein the I-5px, 5py and 5pz orbitals contribute equally to the VBM. With respect to the CBM, it is mainly contributed by Pb-6p orbitals, where 6px, 6py and 6pz orbitals are included. Owing to the intercalation of organic ligands, the inorganic Pb–I octahedra are clarified into two categories, i.e. outer and inner ones (Fig. S2, ESI†), which are defined as barrier and well layers, respectively (see Fig. 4a and Fig. S30, ESI†). The structure of the barrier layer is exactly the unit cell of the 2D PVSK (n = 1) (Fig. 4b), and the well layer is similar to the 3D PVSK with a certain thickness. The bandgap of the barrier layer is close to 2.15 eV, which is larger than that of the well layer (see the schemes in Fig. 4b). The decomposed bands of the barrier and well layers for (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs (take n = 50 as an example) as well as their calculated DOS are shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. The well layer contributes to the VBM and CBM, whereas the barrier layer makes negligible contribution. Furthermore, the DOS analyses confirm the band decomposition. The bandgap of the barrier layers is wider than that of the well layers, and the electrons and holes with lower binding energy are localized on the well layer (Fig. 4b).26 Thus, the overall bandgap is indeed determined by the VBM and CBM of the well layer (Fig. 4b). As shown in Fig. S31 (ESI†), the distribution of different orbitals matches well with that of 3D α-CsPbI3, in accordance with our previous calculation.21 The CBM is mainly contributed by Pb-6p orbitals with negligible coupling with I-5p orbitals, forming the antibonding orbitals (π*) (Fig. 4e). Meanwhile, the fully occupied Pb-6s orbital has strong chemical interaction with the I-5p orbital, generating σ* and σ orbitals, where the σ* orbital emerges as the VBM. For the barrier layer, the lattice distortion of the octahedra is much stronger than that of the well layer, i.e. with elongated RPb–I and shrunk ∠I–Pb–I and ∠Pb–I–Pb (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†), which weakens the bonding between Pb-6s and I-5p orbitals.29 In addition, the lack of coordinating ligands for terminal I ions affects the Pb–I interaction. Therefore, the σ* orbitals formed by Pb-6s and I-5p are much weaker or even negligible, making the VBM of the barrier layer shift down to the nonbonding orbitals of I-5p (see the black line in Fig. 4e), consequently bringing an enlarged bandgap (∼2.15 eV) (Fig. 4c). On the contrary, the well layer with much lighter distortion possesses stronger Pb–I interaction, resulting in a smaller bandgap. With the increase of n, the distortion of the well layer becomes lighter, and finally approaches that of 3D α-CsPbI3. Fig. S32–S35 (ESI†) provide the decomposed band and the PDOS of the other PVSKs (n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8). It seems that the VBM of the PVSK with n = 2 is mainly occupied by the barrier layer, due to the thin well layer with only one-layer of I ions (Fig. S32a and g, ESI†). Once n ≥ 3, the formation of strong Pb–I coupling of the well layer makes the dominant contribution to the VBM, while the barrier layer makes little contribution. As shown in Fig. S33–S35 (ESI†), the densities of Pb2+ and I− ions in the well layer grow with the increase of n, thereby strengthening the Pb–I interaction. As a result, the energy level of σ* orbitals formed by Pb-6s and I-5p is shifted up with a reduced bandgap, also giving rise to the enhanced optical adsorption with the increased n (Fig. S36, ESI†).

Fig. S36 (ESI†) presents the TDOS change of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs with the variation of n, showing that the bandgap reduction is similar to the one shown in Fig. 3a. Fig. S36b–e (ESI†) show the absorption spectra vs. binding energy as well as vs. wavelength along the x, y and z axes. The (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs with n ≥ 3 should respond to the visible light and show red shift in comparison to those with n ≤ 2, owing to the reduced bandgap. The absorption spectra for all quasi-2D PVSKs along the x and y axes imply better photo responses than those along the z axis, because of the barrier of the organic layer and the anisotropy structures in the quasi-2D PVSKs. Notably, the PVSK with n = 50 shows similar or even better optical adsorption than the pristine α-CsPbI3 (Fig. S36b, ESI†).
To evaluate the charge transport of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs, their electron (me*) and hole effective mass (mh*) are calculated based on the parabolic band fitting approach around the CBM and VBM (Fig. S37, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5a and Table S11 (ESI†), the me* of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs except n = 2 becomes much smaller than that of pristine α-CsPbI3, while the mh* exhibits little change (except n = 1 and 2). However, the (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs with n ≥ 3 have close and quite small me* and mh*, which might facilitate the ambipolar carrier conduction and efficient transfer,30 suggesting their promising application in efficient p–i–n junction solar cells. The 3D band structures of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for pristine α-CsPbI3 and (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–6) are displayed in Fig. 5d and Fig. S38–S42 (ESI†), respectively. The change of the curvatures of the CBM and VBM agrees with the variation of me* and mh*. The swells of the HOMOs of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3, 4, 5, 6) resemble that of α-CsPbI3, while their LUMOs show more bulge than that of α-CsPbI3 (Fig. 5e and Fig. S40–S43, ESI†), in agreement with the significantly enhanced hole carrier mobility of quasi-2D PVSKs. The HOMO and LUMO of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 with n = 2 are both rather flat with a large effective mass (Fig. S39, ESI†), which might be caused by the heavy lattice distortion and enlarged bond length (Fig. 1e–g).29,31Fig. 5b displays the dielectric constants (εr) along different directions (x, y, and z), showing that the εr of the (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs increases with the rise of n, and gradually approaches that of 3D α-CsPbI3 PVSKs. Therefore, the conductivity of quasi-2D PVSKs could be enhanced once the intercalated inorganic layers become thicker, in line with the reported work.32 Besides, the calculated εxxr, εyyr and εzzr of 3D α-CsPbI3 are identical owing to the cubic isotropy. However, those of the quasi-2D PVSKs are different, due to the breakdown of isotropic periodic boundary conditions along the z-direction. Furthermore, the εzzr is a little smaller than the εxxr and εyyr, which could be mainly attributed to the organic barrier of quasi-2D PVSKs. The exciton binding energy (Eb) is calculated by using the Wannier exciton model, as shown in Fig. 5c.30,32–34 Consequently, the Eb of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs (n ≥ 3) falls in 29–46 meV, which is smaller than that of 3D α-CsPbI3. The Eb of the (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSK with n = 1 is much larger than the others, which could be mainly ascribed to the quantum confinement effect of ultrathin 2D materials. In addition, the unusual large value for the (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSK with n = 2 might be caused by the extremely heavy carrier effective mass.32 The smallest exciton binding energy can be expected with n approaching 50, indicating its photoelectric properties similar to those of 3D α-CsPbI3.

PCE vs. Eg of CsPbI3 and (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–6, 8, 50 and ∞) PVSKs. 
To estimate the performance of quasi-2D DJ CsPbI3 PVSKs as solar cell absorbers, their open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC) and PCE as a function of the bandgap are shown in Fig. 5f, g and Table S12 (see the details in the ESI† and Fig. S44). With the assumption of some common device parameters, the PCE of single-junction solar cells based on α-CsPbI3 PVSKs is estimated to be ca. 21.1%, and that of EDA-based PVSK (n = 50) is ca. 20.9%, which is close to that of α-CsPbI3. Because of their linearly aligned bandgaps, enhanced stability, smaller effective masses, lower exciton energies and larger dielectric constants as compared to the conventional 3D counterparts, the present quasi-2D DJ CsPbI3 PVSKs could be an excellent and emerging candidate with exciting applications in optoelectronic devices.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a strategy for organic intercalation engineering of quasi-2D DJ α-CsPbI3 PVSKs through DFT calculations and AIMD simulations. The improved stability of quasi-2D DJ α-CsPbI3 PVSKs can be attributed to the strong I–H bond with shortened interlayer distance induced by the intercalated diamine cations. The bandgaps of (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs (n ≥ 2) can be widely tailored from 2.150 (n = 1) to 1.476 eV (n = ∞) with a good linear dependence on the inversed inorganic layer number (1/n), due to the upshift of the VBM contributed by the enhanced coupling between the Pb-6p and I-5p orbitals with the increase of n. Moreover, in comparison to the conventional 3D analogues, it is confirmed that these quasi-2D (EDA)Csn−1PbnI3n+1 PVSKs have desirable properties: (i) fundamentally enhanced stability with much more negative formation energies and more positive decomposition energies with enhanced dynamic stability; (ii) efficient carrier transfer with smaller carrier effective masses (i.e. ∼0.15 m0) and larger dielectric constants; (iii) more effective photo-induced carrier separation with small exciton energy (i.e. ∼30 meV). The current work suggests that the organic intercalation engineered DJ CsPbI3 PVSKs would be an excellent and emerging candidate of halide PVSKs with exciting potential applications in optoelectronic devices.

New concepts
Among the community of metal halide perovskites (PVSKs), the all-inorganic α-CsPbI3 counterparts have attracted extensive interest in optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes and solar cells. Unfortunately, their intrinsic phase instability greatly hinders their potential applications. One of the emerging approaches is to convert the traditional 3D bulk analogues into two-dimensional (2D) layered PVSKs, by intercalating organic amine cations between the inorganic layers. However, to date, few research studies have focused on Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phases with one-layer divalent organic cations between inorganic layers. Herein, we report the concept of organic intercalation engineering for Dion–Jacobson (DJ) quasi-2D α-CsPbI3 PVSKs, by stacking inorganic slabs between the inorganic layers. Such a strategy could endow the CsPbI3 PVSKs with fundamentally enhanced stability, as well as linearly and widely aligned bandgaps, which might be meaningful to direct the exploration of advanced CsPbI3 PVSK materials. This evidences that the simulated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction solar cells based on quasi-2D α-CsPbI3 PVSKs is up to 20.9%, underscoring their bright future for exploring high-performance optoelectronic devices.
