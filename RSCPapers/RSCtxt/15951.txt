    , Accepted 1st September 2017First published on 9th September 2017AbstractOrganolead halide perovskites are an impressive and relatively recent class of light-absorbing materials for solar cells and light-emitting devices. It has been reported that exposure of perovskite materials to light has negative impacts on device performance. Also, surface recombination has been reported as a major obstacle to the total carrier lifetime in perovskite polycrystalline thin films. Herein, we explored the role played by nanosecond pulsed UV laser-irradiation in carrier dynamics in perovskite thin films. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements revealed the interplay of disorder and heterogeneity on photoexcited carrier dynamics, while in situ micro Raman spectroscopy and angle dispersive X-ray diffraction showed the mechanisms of crystal phase reconstruction. Exposure to laser light leads to rapid crystal phase reconstruction and hence, unexpectedly, extends the PL lifetime by fourfold instead of promoting degradation. This verifies that nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation plays a beneficial role in improving optoelectronic material parameters. Our findings reveal that pulsed laser irradiation is a new approach to the reconstruction of the microstructure and offers beneficial effects in the manufacture of perovskite solar cells. Moreover, this work provides a clear insight towards identifying the physical origin behind the disorder, heterogeneity, film reconstruction and nano-structuring as well as their correlation with improved PL lifetimes.
Introduction
Solar cells using organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) materials are revolutionizing photovoltaics. Their power conversion efficiencies are now 22.1%,1 a fivefold increase in cell efficiency over the past six years.2 This rapid increase in efficiency is due to the excellent properties of perovskite polycrystalline films, which exhibit very high absorption coefficients as evidenced by their sharp absorption edges, direct bandgaps, long charge carrier diffusion lengths, low carrier effective masses, and tolerance to defects.3–6 These allow them to be incorporated into a wide variety of device architectures such as mesoporous,7 planar8 and inverted structures,9 while overcoming the conventional limitations of solution-processed semiconductors.10
The reasons underlying the long carrier lifetime of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films remain unclear.2,11 Theoretical investigations have indicated that the dynamic position of the conduction band minimum could be the reason for the prolonged carrier lifetime:12 the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum originate in the 6p orbital of Pb and the 5p orbital of iodine, since absorption takes place at the symmetric vibrations of the PbI3− octahedral site. Thus, the bandgap in CH3NH3PbI3 is altered by changing the Pb–X bond length, where X denotes the halides.13 It has been reported that the optical and electronic bandgaps vary in orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic structures14,15 and that changes in Raman peaks, morphology and X-ray patterns have been reported as light-induced degradation16–18 and light-induced structural transformations.19
Although CH3NH3PbI3 is a promising light harvesting material, its structural fluctuations and instability impede understanding and technological applications. The influences of dynamic structural disorder,20 heterogeneity and phase transition phenomena are not clearly understood. Hence, the in situ interplay of these factors on the lifetime and relaxation processes as well as the device performance during operation requires more exploration.
Recent experiments have indicated that carrier recombination kinetics can be described as a combination of trap-assisted, monomolecular (first-order), and bimolecular (second-order) recombinations.21 Although most studies agree that radioactive bimolecular recombination dominates at high initial carrier densities (n0 > 1017 cm−3),22,23 other reports at lower excitation densities (relevant to solar cell operation)24 range from single-exponential6,25 to biexponential26,27 or to stretched-exponential24,28 functions with varying levels of fidelity. These distributions have in turn been explained in terms of unintentional doping29 and charge trapping.30 Furthermore, perovskite synthesis and growth conditions,7,31 as well as post-deposition treatments,25,32 greatly alter the CH3NH3PbI3 structure, carrier lifetime, and device performance, yet the underlying relationships between these parameters remain unanswered. Understanding these issues will help in the design of laser devices, high performance solar cells and ultrafast optoelectronic devices. To this end the structural characterization of CH3NH3PbI3 can increase our understanding of the in situ dynamic structural evolution, variations in morphology disorder and heterogeneity as a function of laser irradiation and their further impact on carrier decay times and relaxation processes as well as charge carrier mobility. In particular, the physical origin of the disorder and heterogeneity and their correlation with optical properties of hybrid perovskite materials is not clearly known.
Micro-Raman spectroscopy, angle dispersive X-ray diffraction (ADXRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) are powerful tools to reveal the structural and morphological disorder,33,34 the relationships of photoexcited carrier dynamics, and the presence of disorder and heterogeneity.35 Herein we combine these techniques to study the presence/absence of structural disorder and film heterogeneity on CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films, as well as the impacts on the dynamics of photoexcited carriers. We found that an increase in temperature induces structural disorder and morphological heterogeneity, together with the in situ transformation of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 to the cubic CH3NH3PbI3 phase. These changes have a significant impact on the dynamics of photoexcited carriers, diminishing the decay time to less than 1 ns. In contrast, laser irradiation can effectively mitigate the impacts of structural disorder and morphology heterogeneity present in the CH3NH3PbI3 films on the dynamics of the photoexcited carriers. Nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation boosts the decay time fourfold, i.e., from 7 ns to 29 ns with increasing pulsed laser irradiation times. These findings point out the importance of nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation during the manufacture of perovskite films for perovskite solar cells and other ultrafast optoelectronic devices and that it is equally important to understand and consider light and temperature associated phenomena taking place during the device operation. Light exposure is associated with rapid and dynamic photothermally induced structural evolution, morphological changes and reduction of non-radiative recombination centers in CH3NH3PbI3 films and further improving the PL lifetime, indicating that they are not as benign as has been suggested in previous literature.16–18 In particular, our results provide an insight towards exploring the mechanism of temperature, nanosecond pulsed laser and continuous laser light irradiation induced surface recombination in perovskite films with the thought of developing a materials model for analyzing what happens with temperature and laser light exposure during manufacturing of perovskite thin films.
Experimental procedures
CH3NH3PbI3 film preparation
2.0 × 2.5 cm microscope glass slides were washed using acetone, 2-propanol and DI water, each twice and then dried using N2 gas. Finally, we treated them using UV/visible light for 30 min to activate their surface. CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was prepared using the method reported elsewhere.36 The CH3NH3PbI3 powder was prepared using acetonitrile as a solvent by mixing PbI2 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and CH3NH3I (>98%, Uniregion Biotech or UR-CH3NH3I). CH3NH3PbI3 films were prepared in DMF and then spin-coated onto a microscope glass slide (2.0 × 2.5 cm) at 2000 RPM for 30 seconds, which were subsequently annealed at 80 °C for 15 minutes in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Interestingly, we have observed that treating the glass surface using UV/visible light before the spin-coating is an essential step to obtain uniform film coverage. The power of this UV lamp is 60 W and its wavelength is 185 nm. Each substrate was treated for 30 minutes after washing and quickly transferred into the glovebox. The as-synthesized CH3NH3PbI3 powder and films were characterized by in situ micro-Raman spectroscopy combined with in situ angular dispersive X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Impacts of in situ structural evolution and transformation on the decay time of the photoexcited state were studied using combined steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence, together with atomic force microscopy.
Characterization techniques

Steady state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurement. 
Samples were encapsulated in the in situ device (Fig. S1a, in the ESI†) filled with inert gas and excited face-on (not through the substrate) for both steady state and TRPL measurements. PL and TRPL spectra were acquired with a dark chamber, Micro PL and TRPL system (UniNanoTech Co. Ltd, 5 ns pulse width). Steady-state PL measurements were performed with the 266 nm several hundred nanosecond pulsed UV laser. The spectra were corrected for the optical transfer function of the system. PL measurements were carried out in a 90° configuration with the PL signal detected in the same direction of the reflected excitation beam. The maximum power density of this technique is 20 mW cm−2 but we used an optimum power density of 10 mW cm−2 for this study. A 470 nm pulsed diode laser (PDL-800 LDH-P-C-470B, 250 ps pulse width) was used for excitation with repetition rates between 625 kHz and 80 MHz. The emission was filtered through a long pass filter. Photoluminescence from the sample was directed by using a photon counting PMT mounted with an S193 spectrometer for time-resolved PL and the steady-state PL measurements were made by using a CCD with 1024 × 256 pixels. For steady-state PL and TRPL measurement, CH3NH3PbI3 thin films on the glass substrate were encapsulated in an in situ device inside glovebox and PL measurement using a 266 nm laser and TRPL measurement using 470 nm lasers were conducted, respectively, before and after each laser exposure in order to observe the effect of laser light on the CH3NH3PbI3 structure and the impact of structural changes on the decay time photoexcited carrier. Three spectra were acquired to take averages from different locations for each sample to ensure representative sampling and incorporate spot-to-spot variability into the signal.



In situ micro-Raman spectroscopy. 
Raman spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 powder and films were collected on a micro-Raman spectrometer with a laser excitation of 532 nm. The data acquisition time and exposure time were 10 s and 5 s, respectively. The peak intensities of the samples were normalized to those of a silicon wafer at 520 cm−1. A thermoelectrically cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) with 1024 × 256 pixels operating at −60 °C was used as the detector with 1 cm−1 resolution. The laser line was focused onto the sample in a backscattering geometry, using an Olympus 50× objective with a numerical aperture of 0.55, providing a scattering area of ∼0.25 mm2. The laser excitation intensity was maintained from 1% to 30% at an estimated laser spot size of ∼0.8–1.0 mm, and integration times were increased accordingly. The CH3NH3PbI3 powder and films were encapsulated in the in situ device or the sample stage (Fig. S2†) filled with N2 gas and excited face-on (not through the substrate).



In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction during the heating process. 
During the heating process, in situ XRD measurements were carried out by using a synchrotron light source at beamline 01C1 at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), HsinChu, Taiwan. The electron storage ring was operated at 1.5 GeV with a beam current of 360 mA. An image plate detector was used for data collection. The wavelength was moved to 0.774901 Å and calibrated using silicon–LaB6 mixtures. A typical amount of sample powder (1–2 mg) was put into a flow cell (quartz capillary tube with a diameter of 0.8 mm) in the Ar-filled glovebox in advance. The samples were then heated by using a hot-air gun from room temperature to 100 °C. Thus, any structural transformations observed were not because of decomposition or oxidation of the material upon air exposure. The 2theta scan was performed in the range of 5–100 degrees with the angle step size of 0.02 degree. The obtained XRD patterns were then converted to 1.5418 Å as the energy of Cu Kα1 in order to facilitate the comparison with the in-house XRD results and other literature.


Angle dispersive X-ray diffraction (ADXRD). 
ADXRD measurements were performed using the beamline BL12B1 at SPring8, Japan. The wavelength is 0.688917 Å (18 keV). To find d-values from the IP data, both the sample–detector distance and the monochromatic beam energy must be determined before the 2D-ADXD measurement by measuring a standard sample (e.g., CeO2) whose d-values are well known. In this system, we use CeO2 as the standard sample to calibrate the energy of the monochromatic beam and to determine the sample–detector distance. For calibration of the monochromatic beam energy, CeO2 is measured using the monochromatic beam. A program (General Structure Analysis System, GSAS)37 with an editor (graphical user interface, GUI, EXPUGI) was adopted to control the progress of the Rietveld-type fit to obtain unit cell parameters and volumes.



In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. 
The X-ray absorption spectra were recorded at the beamline BL17C1 (NSRRC, HsinChu, Taiwan) with an operation current of 360 mA. The electron storage ring was operated at 3 GeV. A double Si(111) crystal monochromator was used for energy selection. Three gas-filled ionization chambers were employed in series to measure the intensities of the incident beam (I0), the beam transmitted by the sample (It), and the beam subsequently transmitted by the reference foil (Ir) as represented with a general setup in Fig. S3a.† The third ion chamber was used in conjunction with the reference sample, which was a Pb foil for Pb L3-edge measurements. The CH3NH3PbI3 powder was prepared in a metal plate and sealed with Kepton® tape inside the glovebox to avoid air contact during measurement. Then the metal plate containing the sample was placed in a stainless steel holder in order to control the temperature change during XAS measurement. The sample with the stainless steel holder was then placed between the incident beam detector and the reference beam detector. Prior to the XAS measurements, the perovskite sample was treated in the holder with pure Ar gas for 30 min with a flow rate of 30 cm3 min−1. The in situ XAS scan was performed at various temperatures 25, 80, and 100 °C). In order to investigate the radiation effect, two temperature ranges were applied for the measurement: the in situ XAS scan was firstly conducted at 25 °C, then the temperature was increased to 100 °C and then brought back to 25 °C by natural cooling. All in situ measurement steps, including the sample preparation, control of parameters for extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements, and data collection modes, were following the guidelines set by the International XAFS Society Standards and Criteria Committee.38,39


Atomic force microscopy. 
The surface morphology of the perovskite thin film was imaged with tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM, Asylum MFP-3D-BIO).36 An Al reflex coated AFM probe (Olympus AC240TS) with a spring constant of 2 Nm−1 and tip radius of 9 nm was used. A temperature controller and 532 nm laser source were installed together with the AFM to study the temperature and laser irradiation-dependent morphology evolutions and grain size change. Parameters such as drive amplitudes, set points, scan size and resolution, and feedback gains were all tuned to yield high-quality scans with minimal noise or damage to the sample and tip.

Results and discussion
Physical origin behind the disorder and film heterogeneity
A reliable crystallization method for perovskite thin films, compatible with a fast continuous process over large-area flexible substrates is crucial for high performance solar cell production. We investigated laser light irradiation induced reconstruction, crystallization and associated material property changes in solution processed organolead halide hybrid perovskite thin films. Moreover, we mainly explored the impact of the nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation of hybrid perovskites and mechanisms of laser induced processes, which require an in-depth study. We applied a UV pulse laser for thin film treatments.
Laser irradiation vs. thermally induced photoexcited carrier dynamics in CH3NH3PbI3 thin films are compared and the experimental TRPL results are shown in Fig. 1a and b. According to the previous time-resolved studies in the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, controversial decay features of the photoexcited state have been reported as nonexponential24,26–28 and exponential6,25 decay features. In contrast to previous reports that showed light-induced degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 crystallinity,16–18 we investigated that laser irradiation can extend photoexcited carrier decay times. The decay equation, as shown in eqn (1), can have a single-exponential decay from the fast process and stretched exponential decay from the slow process.40,41 The type of exponential form depends on the β values. These values are less than unity and the stretching exponential dominated over the single exponential. The controversial reports from previous studies did not include important parameters: (1) the role of disorder and heterogeneity of the perovskite thin film and (2) the dispersion factor, β. Therefore, considering these two parameters allows us to determine the exponential form in the perovskite thin film. Based on our findings, the type of exponential is stretched exponential and the decay has only a slow component. R(t) = Aexp(−t/τ)β,(1)where, R(t) is the normalized PL intensity (i.e., relaxation phenomena) during the decay process. The decay time τ and the dispersion factor β are characteristic wavelength-dependent decay constants. The parameter β (0 < β < 1) is related to the curvature of the decay, i.e., the decay time distribution.41 This decay law is often encountered in disordered and heterogeneous systems and is considered as a consequence of the dispersive diffusion of the photoexcited carriers.42 A stretched exponential (β < 1) is often used to describe the heterogeneous dynamics of disordered materials. Hence, diffusion heterogeneities are often quantified by the exponent β of a stretched exponential function, which in the homogeneous case is 1 (single exponential function) and for heterogeneous systems is less than 1. The heterogeneities manifested themselves in the apparent randomness in the morphology of materials.43

(c) and (f) Dynamics of the time-dependent decay time and β values, respectively. 
Note that we used the term disorder to explain the position and orientation disorder or lattice distortion and thermal fluctuation, while the term heterogeneity was used to describe thin film surface inhomogeneities related to the presence of traps, defects, and impurities, resulting in a non-uniform film morphology and local structural inhomogeneities related to phase coexistence in the sample or a spatially heterogeneous polycrystalline morphology of these perovskite based materials, which arise from the presence of crystalline grains with remarkably different sizes, shapes, and possibly distinct levels of defects unless otherwise stated. Therefore, we proposed that the nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation induced reduction of randomness in the morphology, dynamic disorder and heterogeneity extended the lifetime of the photoexcited state in the CH3NH3PbI3 film as illustrated by the extension of the decay time from 7 ns to 29 ns after 266 nm laser pulse irradiation (Fig. 1b). The best result we obtained was due to both reduced disorder and heterogeneity as indicated by the increase in β values, from 0.45 to 0.68 as shown in Fig. 1b, indicating laser induced reduction of disorder, defects and its related non-radiative recombinations such as Auger and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination pathways in the CH3NH3PbI3 film, respectively. We used the term reconstruction process that was related to the removal of disorder and heterogeneities and improving the surface (morphology) of the thin film, for instance, our nanosecond pulsed laser reconstructed the original and randomly networked morphology into a 1D or a nano-pillar-like morphology, with improved properties as well as crystal phase reconstruction by reorganization of the atoms in the crystal unless otherwise stated.

Mechanisms of microstructure reconstruction and nano-structuring-steady state PL. 
The occurrence of small β values (β < 1) in our experimental results (Fig. 1) indicated the presence of dispersive exciton motions that confirm the influence from the disorder and the heterogeneity at room temperature. The β exponent in eqn (1) is determined only by the dispersive motion.42 Indeed, in the absence of disorder and heterogeneity, the electron diffusion will not modify the decay line shape, at most it will change the decay time constant. Previous reports based on a free carrier model and exciton energy analysis have indicated that a single exponential has been used to interpret time-resolved studies and the recombination of free electrons and holes, dominated by the relaxation process of photoexcited states.29,30 In our work, however, we have observed a slower decay process. This is attributed to slow carrier recombination processes resulting from more ordered morphologies or decreases in heterogeneity as indicated by the increase in β values from 0.45 to 0.68 in Fig. 1c. This indicated that pulse nanosecond laser irradiation cleans the disorder and heterogeneities present in the perovskite thin film surface. This verified that pulse nanosecond laser treatment of the perovskite thin film surface is a powerful surface cleaning tool to reconstruct and restructure the surface, improve the morphology and reduce non-radiative recombination centers. All of this is proved by the increase in PL intensity shown in Fig. 2a. The evolution of the PL intensity clearly verified the removal of non-radiative recombination centers present in the thin film before (and after) the laser light treatment. Therefore, the PL lifetime increase shown in Fig. 1b and c is due to the increase in the total PL intensity (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, as the temperature increased, both τ and β (Fig. 1e and f) decreased and thus the morphological disorder and/or the degree of heterogeneity increased, indicating that even higher-order recombination effects are present.44 The corresponding reduction in the PL lifetime (Fig. 1e, 2b and c) is impacted by the disorder and disorder induced trap states and heterogeneities such as defects, which verified the increase in the non-radiative recombination rate at higher temperatures. As the temperature increases, the PL intensity decreases, with a thermal quenching activation energy equal to the exciton binding energy.45 Thus, at elevated temperatures, charge carriers are no longer bound together, and it is faster for electrons and holes to find heterogeneous sites such as structural and/or interface defects and quickly recombine non-radiatively. The low carrier radiative recombination rate does not change as a function of temperature but the non-radiative recombination rate increases as the temperature increases.46 Hence, nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation of the CH3NH3PbI3 film mitigated the impact of the structural disorder, morphology heterogeneity and in situ transformation into the cubic CH3NH3PbI3 phase, which boost the decay time almost fourfold (i.e., from 7 ns to 29 ns) with increasing laser irradiation times. This indicates the extreme importance of laser light treatment during perovskite film manufacture for perovskite solar cells and other ultrafast optoelectronic device applications.
 Fig. 2  Laser light and thermal treatment of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. PL intensity versus (a) nanosecond pulsed 266 nm laser exposure time, (b) temperature and (c) at continuous 266 nm laser irradiation of the perovskite thin film. Note that while the pulse laser exposure was dominated by photon energy (enhancing the PL intensity), the continuous laser irradiation was dominated by thermal energy (quenching the PL intensity). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 470 nm and 765 nm, respectively. 
Low-temperature in situ PL spectra, taken using 266 nm UV laser excitation (∼10 W cm−2) and aging times ranging from 0 to 57 minutes continuously, are shown in Fig. S5b–d.† The fast intensity decay (Fig. S5b and c†) indicated either laser induced surface traps and/or structural transformation induced crystal and interfacial defects. Previous reports16–18 showed changes in the morphology and XRD patterns which were simply assigned to light-induced degradations. However, all of those changes are associated with light-induced structural transformations and changes in the morphology of the perovskite film rather than light-induced degradations under an inert atmosphere. This is due to continuous laser irradiation induced high photon flux, which enhanced the thermally induced effects and this verified an increased non-radiative recombination rate. This was the reason for the reduction of total PL intensity in Fig. S5b and c.† We performed in situ Raman spectroscopy after extended irradiation of CH3NH3PbI3 using the UV laser and found that the shape of the Raman spectra, obtained after steady-state PL measurement using 266 nm laser excitation, was similar to those for CH3NH3PbI3 irradiated with longer exposure times using a 532 nm laser (Fig. S6a†). Fig. S6b and c† also indicated that the material had undergone a phase transformation verified by the shift in the band edge luminescence position from 1.61 to 1.59 eV. The effect of 266 nm laser intensity was applied to get an optimum intensity with the optimum laser intensity of 10 mW cm−3 (Fig. S7a and b†). We noticed that this effect is laser wavelength dependent: longer wavelength (e.g., 470 nm, weak irradiation) laser irradiation treatment shows no remarkable extension of lifetime decay (Fig. S7c and d†) compared to 266 nm laser strong excitation, attributed to a rapid relaxation of the carriers to defect states. 266 nm laser strong excitation induced higher PL lifetimes due to strong defect deactivation and disorder reduction on the surface of the thin film. In general, excitons could be trapped by structural disorder, impurities or defects. In disordered polycrystalline thin films such as CH3NH3PbI3, a greater number of trap states are likely to be formed. Thus, an increase in temperature and continuous laser irradiations of the thin film enhance all these non-radiative recombination centers and result in reduction of both PL intensity and PL lifetime. The TRPL analysis confirmed that laser light extended the decay time and enhanced the carrier mobility by reducing the recombination in the perovskite thin film. This suggested that laser induced surface reconstruction and in situ photo-thermal dynamic microstructural evolution play a role in extending the decay time dynamics. In order to understand the mechanisms of these two key processes in the thin film of CH3NH3PbI3, we used in situ micro-Raman spectroscopy and ADXRD. Notably, as observed in Fig. 3b and c, the Raman signal intensity gradually evolved as a function of laser irradiation time. This evolution can be summarized using two Raman spectral patterns, i.e. tetragonal and cubic CH3NH3PbI3. Note the detailed discussions of the integrated peak intensity, integrated peak area and full-width half maxima (Fig. S9 and S10 in the ESI†).

Mechanisms of microstructure reconstruction and nano-structuring-micro Raman and angle dispersive X-ray diffraction. 
In α-CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 3b), it can be observed that two dominant Raman active peaks are assigned to the vibrations of the Pb–I bond (87 cm−1) and vibrations of I–I interaction (120 cm−1): these vibrational modes progressively shifted to 89 cm−1 and 123 cm−1, respectively. During the laser exposure period (500 seconds), the peak intensity (especially the I–I signal) increased. After this, a discontinuity appeared with a Raman peak blue shift from 120 to 139 cm−1 accompanied by the appearance of a new broad peak, assigned to the methyl ammonium-MA at 280 cm−1, possibly in a disordered state. Raman spectra of cubic CH3NH3PbI3, shown in Fig. 3c, evolve as follows: (i) peak splitting results in two dominant peaks with the first at a lower wavenumber shifting from 89 to 85 cm−1, red shifted, and the second at a higher wavenumber shifting from 120 to 139 cm−1; (ii) peak intensity increased to a maximum and then decreased; (iii) the decrease in peak intensity was compensated by peak broadening; (iv) a final 10 cm−1 peak position red shifted from 280 to 270 cm−1. A blue shift was observed from 120 to 139 cm−1, while the appearance of a broad peak at 280 cm−1 indicated the presence of high structural distortion in CH3NH3PbI3. This peak distortion activated new Raman modes (see Table S1 in the ESI†) as indicated by the appearance of a new broad peak at 280 cm−1 and the peak split, shift and appearance of the more intense peak of the Raman I–I band indicating phase transition and in situ formation of the new microstructure. The phase transition from tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 to cubic one was indicated by the discontinuity, the appearance of new peaks and the evolution of the Raman intensities at 500 seconds as shown in Fig. 3b. After 650 seconds (Fig. 3c), the Raman intensity started to decrease up to 1000 seconds showing crystal defect formation during the disappearance of tetragonal and appearance of cubic phases. Then the intensity starts to increase up to 1200 seconds indicating laser induced reconstruction of the microstructure of the cubic or defect passivation. The final decrease in Raman intensity may be due to laser induced ablation.
Therefore, we noticed laser induced reconstruction and microstructure evolutions in the perovskite thin film surface with increasing laser irradiation times. The main incidence of this topic lies in the use of pulsed-laser processing in the fabrication and, improving the surface and microstructure properties of the perovskite thin film. Laser processing has been demonstrated to be a powerful surface tool: it can clean semiconductor surfaces very efficiently and very rapidly, and it can induce original surface structures, which cannot be obtained by other means.47 Laser crystallization of hybrid perovskite solar cells using a near-infrared (NIR) laser (λ = 1064 nm) has been reported as an alternative strategy to achieve higher device performances than conventional thermal annealing.48 632.8 nm and 785 nm lasers were, therefore, applied to study the effect of a longer wavelength laser on the structure of this material as shown in Fig. S11 in the ESI.† We observed that except the change in Raman intensity, no structural changes occurred during the given irradiation time. This suggested that the photon energy of these two types of lasers may not be enough to induce the change of the chemical bonding or crystal phase change, consistent with what we observed from the aforementioned TRPL measurements. Therefore, the laser induced changes depend on the laser wavelength and power and energy densities of the laser sources. High laser power and extended laser irradiation time can induce thermal effects due to the high photon flux of the laser. These thermal effects induce local heating, which promotes structural transformation. Hence, the local coordination of iodine surrounding Pb2+ and the conversion of tetragonal-CH3NH3PbI3 to cubic-CH3NH3PbI3 results in the rearrangement of the PbI3− octahedral site and phase transition, as indicated by the appearance of a new Raman peak, the Raman-active peak shifts as well as a gradual split of peaks at tetragonal-CH3NH3PbI3 at 500 seconds. It is important to note that these laser-induced transformations primarily occur on the surface rather than in the bulk.
In order to clearly understand the laser induced reconstruction of the microstructure and transformations observed by micro-Raman, we further applied ADXRD (wavelength and energy of 0.688917 Å and 18 keV, respectively) available at the BL12B1 Materials X-ray Study beamline in Spring-8, Japan. As a result of laser irradiation, we observed three processes as shown in Fig. 4a and b: (1) the laser induced more intense X-ray diffraction patterns compared to the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 indicating laser induced re-crystallization and reconstruction of the tetragonal phase; (2) after 800 seconds of laser irradiation, peaks at 2Theta values of 13.9, 28.6, 31.67 and 40.7° disappeared verifying that another new phase started to appear and (3) the X-ray diffraction patterns of the new phase become even more intense indicating that laser induced crystallization and reconstruction of the material increase with laser irradiation time even after phase transition. 30 mW cm−2 of homemade laser power (Fig. 4a) resulted in slower reconstruction, crystallization efficiency and phase transformations as compared with these processes at higher laser power (90 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 4b, the homemade laser power of 90 mW cm−2 resulted in strong diffraction peaks and fast phase transformation into the cubic structure. This is evidenced by the diffraction peaks after 480 seconds (Fig. 4b) and the diffraction peaks at 500 seconds (Fig. 4a). This indicated that the laser irradiation has two advantages: (1) induces crystallization and then (2) crystal structuring, which both verify crystal reconstructions in perovskite materials. The 3rd one is a phase transition, which is free of crystal phase coexistence and cannot be achieved by using temperature. The formation of a highly crystalline cubic phase is evidenced by the similarity of the laser induced diffraction peaks at 480 seconds (Fig. 4b) and temperature induced diffraction peaks at 100 °C (Fig. S11†). The intense diffraction peaks in Fig. 4b verify that pulsed laser irradiation can achieve better crystallization of the hybrid perovskite than temperature. A laser power of 90 mW cm−2 can resolve this structural coexistence within 100 seconds and this verifies the special advantage of the laser treatment of perovskites over temperature treatment. Therefore, the reason for the extended decay time after laser treatment of the perovskite film in the previous discussions is due to laser induced reconstruction of the perovskite thin film and achieving better crystallization efficiency during laser irradiation. It is important to note that the use of a high-powered laser and extended laser irradiation leads to degradations as shown in Fig. 4b at 720–960 seconds. A pulsed laser power greater than 100 mW cm−2 can directly lead to degradation. The signals at 9.68 and 12.53° (Fig. 4b), which are readily assigned to CH3NH3I and PbI2, respectively, clearly showing the degradation of perovskite films under laser irradiation.

In situ XAS study of local disorder and structural evolutions in CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. 
The detailed dynamic behavior of CH3NH3PbI3 can be extracted from in situ micro-Raman and ADXRD studies. In order to understand the thermal and nanosecond pulsed laser effects, we applied temperature dependent in situ XAS for the first time. The local structures around Pb(II) atoms were studied by Pb L3-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy to examine the structural distortion of the octahedron and local structural changes. Fig. 5 shows an in situ XAS study of local structural changes in CH3NH3PbI3. The peak intensity decreased when the temperature increased as shown in Fig. 5a and b. Changes of the fine structure (Fig. 5a and b) and atomic distortions are observed in Table 1. Changes in the XANES are not observed in the temperature range used in this study (Fig. 5c). Note that, except the fine structure of CH3NH3PbI3 in EXAFS spectra, the oxidation state of Pb in CH3NH3PbI3 does not show any change with changes in temperature in the XANES spectra, indicating that it is in the +2 state similar to PbI2. In order to ensure the reliability of the structural information, we fitted multiple shells of atoms (two shell-fitting for the room temperature structure, and five shell-fitting for the high-temperature metastable structure) resulting in ‘well-fitted’ results as shown from the experimental spectra of the Pb L3-edge, χ(k), shown in Fig. 5. The fitting parameters are r and σ2 for each shell, giving a total coordination number of 6. At room temperature, two kinds of atom pairs, a longer Pb–I (1) bond (3.218 Å) and shorter Pb–I (2) bond (3.102 Å) are analyzed independently. All these values correspond to the tetragonal structure. However, at higher temperatures, above the phase transition, we found five types of atom pairs as shown in Table 1. From these values, we estimated the distortion of Pb atoms with I atoms in the tetragonal and cubic structures, respectively. Our fittings used the standard r factor and the fitting results from the Fourier transform window shown in Fig. S14 in the ESI.† In very rare cases, high values of the Debye–Waller factor are indicative of a distortion of the iodine environment of the Pb atoms, which is due to deformation and rotations of the PbI3− octahedral site.49 Thus, the local environment of Pb(II) is drastically disordered when the temperature was increased as indicated by the larger value of the Debye–Waller factor, which increased with temperature. Based on the fitting results we have developed a theoretical model for both room temperature and high temperature as shown in Fig. S15a and b.† CH3NH3PbI3 crystals have a tetragonal symmetry of the room temperature phase as shown in Fig. S15a and Table S3.† For this phase, iodide anions are ordered, which resulted in the lower symmetry. Site occupancies are 1/4 for C and N for the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3. While the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals have a cubic symmetry for the high temperature phase, the CH3NH3+ cation is polar and has a C3v symmetry, which should result in a disordered cubic phase.8 In addition to the disordering of the CH3NH3+ cation, the halogen ions are also disordered in the cubic phase shown in Fig. S16b and Table S4 in the ESI.† Site occupancies are 1/4 for the I atom and 1/12 for C and N atoms. Those CH3NH3+ cations occupy those 12 equivalent orientations of the C2-axis, and hydrogen atoms have two sets of configurations on the C2-axis. Then, the total degree of freedom is 24.50 In order to understand the effect of radiation on the local environment of Pb(II), we measured EXAFS spectra at room temperature and then after heating to 100 °C and finally cooled to room temperature to make sure the material was not decomposed. The calculated values after cooling are similar to the values calculated at room temperature except for higher distortion values, due to the reversible phase transition from cubic back to the tetragonal structure and a greater degree of distortion after treatment, as indicated by the distortion values and Pb–I (1) bond length in Table 1. This confirmed that CH3NH3PbI3 does not decompose, but only phase change occurred inside the thin films. The pulse laser irradiation did not lead to a phase transition, but it played two roles: (a) crystallization efficiency increased after pulse laser treatment indicated by the increased peak intensity compared to the thermally treated one (Fig. 5), which is observed to decrease the intensity; (b) the distortion values decreased after laser treatment as shown in Table S2.† These results verified that the structural disorder was well minimized while crystallinity was well enhanced. The phenomena induced by the two conditions clearly reason out why the PL lifetime and total PL intensity changes in Fig. 1a, c and 2a, respectively, with temperature and laser light. In order to understand the effect of radiation on the local environment of Pb(II), we measured EXAFS after cooling the temperature back to room temperature and we found better crystallization efficiency, indicating that there was no degradation during heating.

In addition, this weighting scheme minimizes the influence of chemical and multiple scattering effects on the signal, which occur mainly in the low-k region of the spectrum.

Based on this information, we conclude that the thermal post-treatment results in structural disorder in CH3NH3PbI3 as shown in Table 1. This distortion results from the difference between the shortest and the longest nearest neighboring spacing for different Pb–I distances within the different CH3NH3PbI3 structures. EXAFS spectra obtained from samples annealed at different temperatures also reflect that the large local atomic distortions occur during the thermal process.


CH3NH3PbI3 film morphology evolution. 
The significant morphological improvements of the CH3NH3PbI3 film have been reported using the intermixing-seeded growth technique by intermixing precursor-capped inorganic nanoparticles of PbS.51 We used UV pulse laser irradiation to reconstruct and improve the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 film. AFM (tapping mode) topographic imaging was used to characterize and visualize the surface morphological changes in the CH3NH3PbI3 films treated by laser irradiation and thermal heating. Fig. 6A(a, c, e, and g) show the morphology changes with increasing laser irradiation times. The pristine film has a surface roughness (Rq) of 15.9 nm (5 μm × 5 μm scan). The Rq of the CH3NH3PbI3 film increased from 15.9 to 74.1 nm as the laser irradiation time increased from 0 to 6 minutes (360 seconds). Similarly, the AFM measured grain size of the film increased from 111 to 610 nm with the corresponding laser irradiation time. Higher film roughness correlates directly to larger grains. This increase in roughness and grain size is related to the growth of the 1D morphology. The microscopic mechanisms of nucleation and growth of these of 1D morphology may need further investigation. As shown in Fig. 6A(a), the morphology displays valleys and hills. These changes of the valleys and hills in Fig. 6A(c) are the surface morphology of coalesced grains, suggesting that the laser irradiation stimulated the migration of grain boundaries and may cause the coalescence of more grains upon a time. This can also happen not only with increasing laser irradiation time, but also with increasing laser power: (1) as a result, the randomness in the morphology/structural disorder and film heterogeneity observed before laser irradiation becomes changed into a compact, uniform and dense film with a narrow grain distribution of particle interconnections. (2) The growth of the 1D morphology should have fascinating properties and extending the decay time. The fascinating properties, which these 1D nanostructures exhibit, are based on their atomic scale structures and their 1D morphology e.g. their length and their diameter dimensions at the nanoscale. This potential relies on the subtle control of their physical properties such as their density of states and the transport of electrons and photons. As shown in Fig. 6B(b, d, f and h), however, the growth of the 1D morphology is not observed after thermal heating except various valleys and hills, verifying the increased morphological heterogeneities and degree of morphological randomness. The temperature induced roughness and measured grain size changes are far less than those resulting from laser excitation. The main reason for the extended PL lifetime and PL intensity was that the pulse laser induced the following phenomena: (1) surface photo-brightening or cleaning of the disorder (random network) of the surface or the morphology and cleaning of heterogeneities related to size, shape and defects as well as coexisting crystal phases. (2) Growth of the 1D morphology i.e. pulse laser induced structuring of the randomly networked surface and morphology of the perovskite thin film into 1D morphology as shown in Fig. 6 and S17 and S18 in the ESI.† Phenomena (1) and (2) collectively increased the probability of radiative recombination over non-radiative recombination. However, for the temperature treated and continuously irradiated thin film, higher probability of non-radiative recombination over radiative recombination was observed due to thermally activated quenching of the PL intensity and PL lifetime. An analysis of the temperature dependence of the spectra and PL decays suggests that the observed reduction of PL lifetimes and PL intensity can be attributed to the increase of impurity or defect concentrations. Intrinsic impurities and deep level defects were shortening the PL lifetime and reducing the PL intensity. Additionally, the surface disorder induced by the processing temperature and continuous laser irradiation can have a significant effect on the luminescence intensity for non-radiative recombination centers can be generated. Unlike the above physical phenomena, there was a possibility that surface chemical composition changes were not happening. This was supported by the increase in the X-ray diffraction intensity and EXAFS data, verifying the increase in crystallization efficiency and decrease in distortion. However, at extended time exposure and higher laser power, it is confirmed by the XRD data that degradation was taking place.
 Fig. 6  Comparison of laser irradiation and thermally induced morphology variations in CH3NH3PbI3 film surfaces. Variations of morphology disorder and heterogeneity with variations in (A) laser light irradiation time and (B) temperature. Laser power used was 30 mW cm−2. 
To this end, substantial differences in the microstructure and morphology of the laser treated and temperature treated films are clearly observed from the 3D AFM images shown in Fig. 6 and 2D images of the surface morphology as shown in Fig. S16 in the ESI.† Thus, we concluded that nanosecond pulsed laser processing is a powerful surface tool that can clean hybrid perovskite surfaces very efficiently and very rapidly and can induce 1D morphology structures, which cannot be obtained by other means such as temperature as shown in the SEM images of Fig. S17 and S18 in the ESI.† Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the Auger recombination results from charge carrier congregations in ‘Auger hot spots’: lower-energy sites that are present because of energy disorder. Disorder-enhanced Auger recombination is a general effect that is expected to be active in all disordered materials.52 The reduced heterogeneity leads to overcome recombination at defect sites like SRH recombination, while the reduced randomness in the morphology and disorder present in the perovskite thin film overcomes the Auger recombination as shown in Scheme 1a. This was achieved by the proposed mechanisms of morphological and structural transformations into the oriented 1D morphology structure shown in Scheme 1a after nanosecond pulsed laser irradiations when compared with the morphology in Scheme 1b after thermal treatment. Thus, nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation changed the randomly packed particle network to a regularly orient 1D packed particle network, which further reduces the disorder and heterogeneity present in the thin film. Nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation can be a strategy to extend decay time in perovskite thin films by reducing the morphological disorder, heterogeneity, and dimensionality of the morphological network and mitigating the non-radiative recombination processes. The results obtained from the AFM study along with our structural investigations can help understanding the role of nanosecond pulsed laser light. Thus, this nanosecond pulsed laser treatment during and post-synthesis crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 film have been shown high efficiencies of 17.8%53 and 11.3%,48 respectively, verifying nanosecond pulsed laser treatment of hybrid perovskites during the synthesis results in better crystallization efficiency. Thus, both film homogeneity and pulse laser excitation-driven non-thermal transformation of the random network of the morphology into a highly ordered 1D morphology reduced the non-radiative recombination centers in the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film thereby extending the decay time (Fig. 1b and c). Moreover, this work provides a clear insight towards identifying the physical origin behind the disorder, heterogeneity, film reconstruction and nano-structuring as well as their correlation with improved PL lifetime. More importantly, our results provide an insight towards exploring the mechanism of temperature and light-induced surface recombination in the perovskite film with the thought of developing a material model for what happens with temperature and laser light.

Conclusion
We found that thermal post-treatment caused morphology/structural disorder, film heterogeneity, and thermally induced phase transition in perovskite films. All these parameters strongly diminished the decay time of the photoexcited carrier and phonon lifetime. In contrast to this, laser treatment cleaned the morphology/structural disorder and film heterogeneity and overcame problems related to phase transitions by introducing rapid crystal phase reconstruction and a 1D morphology. This rapid reconstruction varies with the laser irradiation time, laser power and/or laser intensity and laser wavelength. Compared to 633 nm and 785 nm wavelength laser sources, a better crystal phase reconstruction using 532 nm lasers at constant laser power and a 266 nm UV pulse laser is explored. A nanosecond pulsed UV laser can derive the reconstruction process more rapidly compared to visible and near infrared pulse lasers. Interestingly, nanosecond pulsed laser induced cleaning further is a useful approach to reduce the density of recombination centers of the perovskite film, and strongly enhances the phonon lifetime, the decay time of the photoexcited carrier and charge carrier mobility. Thus, light irradiation is directly associated with rapid and dynamic photo-thermally induced morphology reconstruction, structural evolution, electro-optical modifications and phase transformation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites, but not necessarily linked with degradation, though extended laser irradiation time and high laser power lead to degradations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that by using nanosecond pulsed laser light treatment during manufacturing, it is likely that we will see boosting of the lifetime and performance of perovskite solar cells. Our work highlights the importance of nanosecond pulsed laser cleaning of morphological disorder, heterogeneity, and various imperfections in developing high-performance perovskite based optoelectronic devices. Thus, nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation is a new approach to the reconstruction of perovskite film microstructure and will create a new approach towards future processing of high quality organolead halide hybrid perovskite materials. Moreover, this work provides a clear insight towards identifying the physical origin behind disorder, heterogeneity, film reconstruction and structuring as well as their correlation with improved PL lifetime.

 	Fig. 1  Laser irradiation vs. thermally induced photoexcited carrier dynamics and heterogeneity. (a) and (d) Schematic representation of the experimental setup for laser irradiation and thermal treatment, (b) and (e) bulk time-resolved PL extended decay time after excitation of the CH3NH3PbI3 film using a 266 nm laser and treated at a different temperatures, respectively, fitted to a stretched exponential function. (c) and (f) Dynamics of the time-dependent decay time and β values, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  Laser light and thermal treatment of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. PL intensity versus (a) nanosecond pulsed 266 nm laser exposure time, (b) temperature and (c) at continuous 266 nm laser irradiation of the perovskite thin film. Note that while the pulse laser exposure was dominated by photon energy (enhancing the PL intensity), the continuous laser irradiation was dominated by thermal energy (quenching the PL intensity). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 470 nm and 765 nm, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  Laser-induced in situ microstructure reconstruction. (a) Schematic representation of the in situ Raman experimental set up; structural transformation of (b) tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 to the (c) cubic CH3NH3PbI3 phase at continuous laser exposure using 532 nm with 30% laser power under a controlled atmosphere, where α and β represent tetragonal and cubic phases.	 

 	Fig. 4  Laser irradiation induced microstructure reconstruction. Microstructure evolutions and transformations of tetragonal phase at laser irradiation times (a) from 0 to 900 seconds at 30 mW cm−2 and (b) from 0 to 960 seconds at 90 mW cm−2 laser power of a 532 nm homemade laser source during laser irradiation time under the atmosphere controlled environment. Note that an MGL–FN–532–300 mW cm−2 and 12060578-DPSSL DRIVER movable laser source was used in this study. Its operating mode is CW and output power is up to 300 mW cm−2.	 

 	Fig. 5  
In situ XAS study of local structural change CH3NH3PbI3 powder. Pb L3-edge (a) and (c) EXAFS spectra, (b) and (d) XANES spectra and (e) and (f) the k-weighted XAFS, k3χ(k) CH3NH3PbI3 at room temperature, 80 and 100 °C obtained in a transmission mode. All measurements have been conducted in an atmosphere controlled system using a sealed metal plate. Experimental χ(k) spectra of the Pb L3-edge for CH3NH3PbI3 at various temperatures and nanosecond pulse laser irradiation time. Note that a weighting scheme of k3 compensates for the attenuation in EXAFS amplitude at higher k values and prevents the domination of larger amplitude oscillations in the determination of interatomic distances. In addition, this weighting scheme minimizes the influence of chemical and multiple scattering effects on the signal, which occur mainly in the low-k region of the spectrum.
