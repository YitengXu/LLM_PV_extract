Introduction
Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) are considered as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation electronic and photonic devices. Research on semiconductor NWs can be traced back to the 1960s, when Wagner and Ellis at Bell laboratories demonstrated that nano- to millimeter-sized Si whiskers could be formed via a Au-catalyzed vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) method.1 However, this novel nanostructure did not attract significant attention until the 1990s, when scientists at Hitachi Ltd successfully fabricated nanometer-scale GaAs and InAs whiskers and demonstrated the application potential of GaAs wires in light-emitting devices (LEDs).2–6 Since then, NWs have quickly become a hot research topic in the field of semiconductor materials. To date, great progress has been made in the growth, characterization, and applications of semiconductor NWs. Different growth methods, including foreign-metal-catalyzed, self-catalyzed, selective-area epitaxy, catalyst-free self-assembled, and aerotaxy, have been developed.1,7–10 A large variety of materials, including group IV (Si, Ge, SiGe, and GeSn), group III–V (GaAs, InAs, GaP, InP, GaSb, InSb, and ternary alloys), group II–VI (ZnO, CdS, CdSe, ZnSe, and ternary alloys), and nitrides (GaN, InN, and ternary alloys), have been grown.11–28 Various NW heterostructures with advanced functions, such as axial, radial (core–shell), NW/quantum-well, and NW/quantum-dot, have been fabricated.29–32 Novel NW-based devices, including field-effect transistors (FETs), lasers, photodetectors, solar cells, LEDs, switches, sensors, single-photon devices, and synaptic devices, have been developed, showing unique advantages in ultra-compact low-consumption integrated circuits and flexible systems.33–45
Controllable growth of semiconductor NWs with certain characteristics is a fundamental and important topic in the field of NW research. It is well known that NWs typically grow in the low energy 〈111〉 direction for zinc blende (ZB) (or the 〈0001〉 direction for wurtzite (WZ)).2–6 For 〈111〉-oriented NWs, particularly III–V NWs, the mixed ZB/WZ structure and stacking faults (SFs) are widely observed due to the small energy difference between the two critical nuclei; this is believed to severely affect the electrical and optical properties of NW devices.46 For example, it was demonstrated that phase mixing and SFs in NWs severely degraded the field-effect mobility.47–50 So far, many efforts have been devoted to the realization of SF-free phase-pure NWs. Several groups have reported a pure WZ phase in ultra-thin NWs and a pure ZB phase in relatively thick NWs, but the WZ/ZB mixed phase in intermediate-sized NWs.51–53 Some other groups, however, demonstrated a pure ZB phase in thin NWs and a pure WZ phase in thick NWs.50,54,55 Crystal phase engineering can also be realized by carefully controlling the growth parameters, such as temperature, precursor molar fraction, and V/III ratio.56–59 However, for different materials, and even for the same material, the dependence of phase perfection on the growth parameters is not consistent. For example, ZB GaAs NWs are obtained at both high and low V/III ratios.56,57 Other crystal phase engineering methods include epitaxial burying, doping, radial growth, etc.60–62 Overall, the inherent characteristics of 〈111〉-oriented NWs make it difficult to grow them simply with a pure crystal phase, and crystal phase engineering is still a complicated and limited task.
Due to their ultra-small footprint, NWs can be grown on a large-lattice-mismatched substrate without dislocations within a certain critical diameter, paving the way for heterogeneous integration and low-cost devices.63,64 III–V NWs grown on Si substrate are particularly promising for application in an optoelectronic integrated circuit (OEIC). During the past decades, different methods have been developed for the growth of high-quality III–V NWs on Si substrate, including buffer layers, selective-area growth (SAG), and catalyst-free self-assembled growth, giving rise to a number of Si-based NW optoelectronic devices and integrated circuits.44,65–70 However, growth is typically conducted on Si (111) substrates, which are not compliant with industry-standard Si (100) substrates. Although the monolithic growth of InGaAs NW lasers on Si (100)-based functional metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) has been demonstrated, the actual “minisubstrate” is composed of exposed silicon (111) planes due to etching of part of the silicon (100) substrate.71 The preparation of wafer-scale vertical-aligned high-quality NWs monolithically grown on Si (100) substrate is still a big challenge for the development of 〈111〉-oriented NWs.
From the theoretical point of view, NWs prefer to grow along the 〈111〉 direction since the (111) facets are the closest packing planes and usually have the lowest surface free energy.72–74 As a result, non-〈111〉-oriented NWs are difficult to obtain under normal growth conditions. However, under certain conditions, non-〈111〉-oriented NWs are also observed, opening up new possibilities for the study and applications of NWs. Givargizov first reported the 〈110〉 NW growth direction for Si in 1971 and the 〈100〉 NW growth direction for GaAs in 1975 by using the Au-catalyzed VLS technique.75,76 During the past decades, non-〈111〉 orientations, mainly 〈100〉, 〈110〉, 〈112〉, and 〈10−10〉, have been achieved in Si, Ge, GeSn, GaAs, InP, InAs, GaSb, InSb, ZnSe, ZnO, GaN, InN NWs, etc., by various methods such as thermal evaporation, metal-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD)/ultra-high vapor (UHV) CVD/chemical beam epitaxy (CBE)/molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)/metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), self-catalyzed MBE/MOCVD, and SAG. It is found that those non-〈111〉-oriented NWs exhibit significantly different properties in comparison with the 〈111〉-oriented ones. For instance, most of the reported non-〈111〉-oriented NWs exhibit an inherently SF-free ZB crystal structure, significantly outperforming the 〈111〉-oriented NWs typically possessing ZB/WZ mixed phases. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that for NWs grown along different orientations, the electronic structures, transport, and optical properties are also different. Among those orientations, the 〈100〉 orientation has attracted particular interest due to its compatibility with industry-standard Si(100) substrates. Table 1 summarizes reported non-〈111〉-oriented NWs for several important semiconductor materials grown by different methods. It should be noted that 〈111〉 A-oriented arsenide and phosphide NWs, which typically grow along the 〈111〉 B direction, are also listed in this table.

This paper aims to give a comprehensive review of the growth, characterization, and applications of non-〈111〉-oriented NWs. Major semiconductor materials, including IV, III–V, and II–VI groups, were studied. The main factors dominating the NW growth orientations, such as substrate orientation, catalyst engineering, NW diameter, growth conditions, kinking, SAG, etc., are summarized. Physical properties, whether predicted by theory or confirmed by experiment, are discussed. Finally, several emerging electronic and optoelectronic devices based on non-〈111〉-oriented NWs are introduced.
Growth
Substrate orientation
From a crystallographic point of view, there is a strong dependence between the substrate orientation and epilayer growth direction. In most cases, on a (111)-oriented homogeneous substrate, vertically aligned 〈111〉-oriented NWs are obtained. For III–V NWs on a nonpolar substrate such as Si(111), in addition to a preferred 〈111〉 direction vertical to the substrate surface, a small percentage of 〈111〉 direction inclined to the substrate is also observed.72 Several groups have demonstrated that non-〈111〉-oriented NWs can be obtained by simply using non-(111) substrates without any treatment. 〈110〉 Ge NW growth was observed on Ge(001) and Ge(110) substrates in addition to 〈111〉 growth by the Au-catalyzed CVD method, with proportions of 20% and ∼50%, respectively.88 〈100〉, 〈110〉, and 〈112〉 GaAs NWs are occasionally observed on a Si(001) substrate grown by Au-catalyzed MBE.98 A 45–50% yield of vertical 〈100〉 GaAs NW growth is also achieved on the (100) GaAs substrate by Ag-catalyzed MBE, without employing any type of surface modification or nucleation strategy.99 Although engineering of the substrate orientation is a simple way to grow non-〈111〉-oriented NWs, it is still difficult to achieve 100% yield without 〈111〉 growth. In addition, as demonstrated by many groups, even on non-(111) substrates, the dominant growth direction is still 〈111〉, which means that the substrate orientation is sometimes affected by certain conditions, rather than there being a universal method to control growth.6,149–152
Catalyst engineering
The metal catalyst plays a critical role in foreign-metal-catalyzed and self-catalyzed VLS NW growth. Studies have shown that the material/composition, shape, position, and contact angle of the catalytic droplet strongly affect the NW properties, such as size, morphology, crystal structure, and doping.153–157 Prior to wire growth, the metal catalysts are typically annealed at high temperature to deoxidize the surface and alloy the catalyst with the semiconductor material, promoting the growth of 〈111〉-oriented NWs. Instead, without annealing the Au catalyst at high temperature and using poly-L-lysine surface pretreatment, Krishnamachari et al. successfully obtained vertical [001] InP NWs on InP (001) by MOCVD.106 They explained that at high temperature, the InP substrate will be locally dissolved during the reaction with Au, forming low-energy facets such as {111} B and {011}. Nucleation on such facets could be the starting point for commonly observed NW growth in the 〈111〉 direction and more seldom observed for the 〈110〉 direction. Without annealing, the reaction between InP and Au will be suppressed. Nucleation for NW growth can start at an intact InP(001)/Au interface, promoting growth in the [001] direction. A remarkable effect of the [001] NW is a perfect ZB crystalline structure free of SFs, which is attributed to the formation of SFs during growth in the [001] direction needing to overcome an activation barrier for the creation of partial Frank dislocations. After optimization of the growth conditions, including temperature, NW diameter, V/III ratio, and precursor molar fraction, a maximum yield of 97% is obtained, and a reversible switching between 〈100〉 and 〈111〉 directions is demonstrated by varying the indium content of the droplet.107,108 The high yield of 〈001〉 InP NWs and related direction-switching structures not only pave the way for the development of NW-based devices on widely used (100) substrates, but also create new opportunities to realize novel devices.109 One drawback of this method is that contamination cannot be ruled out.
Another route to obtain non-〈111〉 NWs is by replacing the widely used Au catalyst with other metals. By using Pd as the catalyst, Xu et al. obtained defect-free ZB InAs NWs grown along the 〈0〉 direction.124 Other than the {111} NW/catalyst interfaces commonly observed in Au-catalyzed growth, the Pd-catalyzed NWs contain {} NW/catalyst interfaces, which promote growth in the 〈0〉 direction and make it difficult to generate lattice defects along the growth front. Moreover, the Pd-catalyzed NWs contain four low-energy {111} side facets, suggesting that the growth of NWs is dominated by energy minimization of the side facets. A more detailed growth experiment was presented by Perumal et al.125 In addition, by employing the Pd catalyst, ZB 〈111〉 A InAs NWs were obtained on InAs(111)A substrate by CBE.133
For self-catalyzed NWs, catalyst engineering is also demonstrated to be an effective way to achieve growth direction switching. Potts et al. reported the use of In droplets to tune the growth direction of self-catalyzed InAs NWs.132 In their work, In droplets were obtained either by annealing NWs under vacuum or by direct deposition on the NWs. It was demonstrated that the In droplet size and position could be tuned by changing the annealing time. The In droplets could then be used as seeds to continue NW growth, enabling the growth of L-shaped InAs nanostructures corresponding to one of the 〈11−2〉 directions. One drawback of this method is that the 〈11−2〉 NWs adopt the crystal structure of the 〈−1−1−1〉-oriented host NW, which is typically polytypic (Fig. 1).

Diameter
The dependence of growth direction on NW diameter is observed in NWs of different materials such as Si and ZnSe.80–82,138–140 Wu et al. characterized Si NWs grown on SiO2 with different diameters and found a clear preference for growth along the 〈110〉 direction in the smallest Si NWs and along the 〈111〉 direction in larger SiNWs.81 They showed that the Au/NW interface consisted of two {111} planes, whereby the 〈111〉 and 〈11〉 directions combined to yield a growth axis of 〈110〉. These results indicate that the liquid/solid (111) interface remains the lowest-energy interface in the smallest NWs. For Si NWs grown epitaxially on Si (100) substrate, the growth direction from 〈111〉 to 〈110〉 occurred at a crossover diameter of approximately 20 nm.82 To clarify the diameter-dependent crystallographic orientation of Si NWs grown via the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism with an Au catalyst, a nucleation thermodynamic model that considered the orientation-dependent surface and interface energies of Si NWs was developed by Wang et al.158 Theoretical results indicated that the growth direction of a Si NW changed from the 〈110〉 to the 〈111〉 direction at a critical size of 25 nm, in excellent agreement with reported experimental results. In addition to Si NWs, a similar direction change phenomenon was also observed in ZnSe NWs grown by Au-catalyzed MBE.138 The experimental results suggested that the thickest ZnSe NWs with diameters greater than 20 nm preferred to grow along the 〈111〉 direction, while NWs with diameters of 10–20 nm or even smaller might grow along the 〈110〉 or 〈112〉 directions. A theoretical model predicted that 7 nm and 17 nm were the critical diameters for growth direction changes from 〈110〉 to 〈112〉 and 〈112〉 to 〈111〉, respectively. The diameter-induced direction change is a simple way, as the diameter can be easily tuned by controlling the size of the catalyst and mask opening.159–161 However, the dependence of growth direction on NW diameter has not been observed in III–V NWs (Fig. 2).

Growth conditions
Growth temperature plays a critical role in NW growth. Cai et al. found that the growth direction of ZnSe NWs was not only determined by the NW diameter, but also influenced by the growth temperature.141 For a constant ZnSe NW diameter, a high growth temperature led to the 〈112〉 or 〈110〉 growth directions, while a low growth temperature led to growth in the 〈111〉 direction, which was understood in terms of the liquid-catalyst–NW interfacial energy and the ZnSe NW surface energy. The experimental results were further quantitatively analyzed by a thermodynamic model proposed by Li et al.162 By calculating and comparing the total free energy of NWs with different growth directions, they found that NWs with a large diameter or those grown at low temperature preferred to grow along the 〈111〉 direction, and NWs with a small diameter or grown at high temperature favored the 〈110〉 direction.
The dependence of the growth direction of Si NWs on pressure was demonstrated by Lugstein et al.86 When changing the total pressure from 3 to 15 mbar, a transition between the 〈111〉 and 〈112〉 orientations was observed. For growth pressures between 3 and 15 mbar, a mixed distribution of growth directions was found. The result was in conflict with the previously reported diameter–direction relationship through which, at a higher total pressure, the catalytic particles swelled in size because of the higher supersaturation of Si in the Au particles, which should stabilize the 〈111〉 growth direction.82 Jagannathan et al. observed a similar phenomenon in which decreasing the partial pressure of germane increased the number of 〈111〉 NWs.92 Another basic growth condition that affects the III–V NW directions is the V/III ratio. By employing highly Ga-rich conditions (low V/III ratio), the growth of Ga-assisted GaAs NWs along the 〈111〉A direction was demonstrated, with a high yield of up to ∼50%.105 This suggested that in addition to surface energies, growth kinetics was also important in determining the growth direction. In fact, the effect of growth kinetics on the morphology and crystallinity is widely reported.163–165 Korgel et al. also suggested that the growth rate was important in dominating the growth direction of Ge NWs.93
Kinking
Kinking in NWs was reported as early as 1968, when Wagner and Doherty observed branching and kinking during VLS growth of Si NWs.166 They suggested that the morphology of the solid–liquid interface and the contact angle configuration of the liquid alloy droplet determined the direction of VLS-grown NWs. A sudden change of growth conditions, e.g. temperature, introduced instability in the droplet or at the solid–liquid interface, resulting in the formation of branches or kinks. To date, kinking has been widely observed in Si, Ge, GaAs, InP, and InAs NWs as well as in axial NW heterostructures.83,87,90,91,99,110,125,167–171 Kinking can be induced by a sudden change of growth conditions. For example, kinking away from [111] to 〈112〉 was observed during the growth of Si NWs by either reducing the substrate temperature or increasing the disilane pressure.82 Kinking with a transition from 〈111〉 to 〈110〉 oriented growth during the VLS synthesis of Ge NWs was induced by the addition of methylgermane (GeH3CH3).90 Spontaneous kinking, that is, kinking that occurs without a change in the conditions during NW growth, has also been demonstrated in different materials. Li et al. observed spontaneous kinking from vertical [111] to 〈110〉 in Ge NWs with a nominal diameter of ∼20 nm, as this was precisely the diameter at which 〈111〉 and 〈110〉 growth were equally preferred energetically.91 Yan et al. reported spontaneous kinking from 〈111〉 to 〈110〉 during the self-catalyzed growth of InP NWs.113 Unlike the Ge NWs, for which kinking from 〈111〉 to 〈110〉 occurred at small diameters, kinking in self-catalyzed InP NWs was observed over a broad diameter range, and, interestingly, the NW length before kinking exhibited a nearly linear relationship with the diameter. This type of kinking was attributed to instabilities at the liquid/solid interface caused by fast In incorporation into the droplet. Also using the self-catalyzed growth method, kinking from 〈111〉 to 〈112〉 was observed in InAs NWs (Fig. 3).131

SAG
SAG is a promising way to achieve position-controlled highly uniform NWs for a variety of applications including silicon photonics, NW-based topological insulators, and photovoltaics. Also, it provides an effective way to control direction. With the assistance of a template, NWs grown along different directions can be obtained, depending on the substrate orientation. The templates are typically made of oxides, e.g. anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) or SiO2. Before NW growth, an oxide template with openings is fabricated on the substrate, which forces the NWs to grow along the substrate orientation. Moreover, NWs with a certain morphology and diameter can be realized by engineering the shape and size of the openings. Inside the openings, the NWs can be grown either following the metal-catalyzed VLS mechanism, or by the catalyst-free SAG technique. With the SAG method, non-〈111〉-oriented NWs of different materials, such as Si, GaAs, InAs, GaSb, and GaN, have been obtained on homogeneous or heterogeneous substrates. By using an AAO template and Au-catalyzed SA-UHV-CVD growth technique, vertical high-density epitaxial Si 〈100〉 NW arrays were obtained on a Si (100) substrate.77 More than 90% of the nanopores were filled with Si NWs, and bicrystalline Si NWs containing {111} twin boundaries were observed. By using vertical SiO2 nanotube templates and the catalyst-free SA-MOCVD growth technique, InAs and GaAs NWs with different crystallographic orientations were vertically grown on Si substrate.100 Particularly, Si–InAs heterojunction NW tunnel diodes were fabricated on Si(100) substrate, promoting the development of NW devices compliant with industry-standard substrates. However, unlike the non-〈111〉 NWs grown by other methods that typically adopt a defect-free pure ZB structure, non-〈111〉 NWs obtained by SAG usually contain a high concentration of defects, limiting their applications in high-performance devices. Besides, using SA-MOCVD, two-dimensional photonic crystals based on highly uniform 〈111〉 A-oriented InP NWs were also obtained.116,117
In addition to the vertical-aligned non-〈111〉 NWs, in-plane non-〈111〉 NWs have also been demonstrated by the SAG method. In-plane GaSb nanotemplates and InAs nanowires along the 〈110〉 directions were obtained on a GaAs (001) substrate by the SA-MBE growth technique, showing great potential for application in next-generation gate-all-around transistors.130 Using a similar growth method, in-plane twin-free GaAs NWs grown along the 〈110〉 directions were also achieved on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers with (001) crystal orientation, providing a possible way to realize complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) compatible III–V materials on Si (100) (Fig. 4).102

Properties
Crystal structure
Compared with the 〈111〉 NWs, one of the most attractive advantages of non-〈111〉-oriented NWs is the high crystal quality.
Most of the reported 〈100〉, 〈110〉, and 〈112〉 NWs exhibit a defect-free pure ZB crystal structure, as SFs and rotational twins are difficult form perpendicular to the growth axis in those directions.172 Although rare, SFs have indeed been observed in some non-〈111〉-oriented NWs, particularly near the catalyst. Sun et al. observed inclined SFs near the catalyst in an individual 〈001〉 InAs NW grown by Au-catalyzed MBE.121 For kinked NWs, twins are typically observed at the direction-transition region, which may extend into the non-〈111〉-oriented branch during growth.113,131 However, those twin faults are typically parallel to the growth direction, which may have a small influence on the mobility of NWs.122,131 One exception is the 〈11−2〉 InAs NWs formed by manipulating the position of indium droplets, which adopt the crystal structure of the 〈−1−1−1〉-oriented host NW with a high density of planar SFs.132
Electronic structure
Electronic structures of Si NWs with different orientations were theoretically studied by different groups. Zhao et al. calculated the electronic structures of Si NWs along the [110] and [111] directions, and found that [110] wires exhibited a direct fundamental band gap at the Γ-point with diameters up to 4.2 nm, while the [111] wires exhibited a transition from a direct gap in small wires to an indirect one with diameters larger than 2 nm.173 Vo et al. found that the band gap of [001] and [011] Si NWs was still direct with diameters up to 3 nm, while the gap of [111] NWs became indirect at a diameter of 2 nm.174 For 〈112〉 NWs, Scheel et al. predicted an indirect band gap for diameters down to 0.8 nm.175 Similar to Si NWs, Ge NWs grown in the [110] direction were also found to present a direct energy gap, while in the [111] direction the gap was indirect, even for small diameters.176 On the other hand, band structure modulation by strain is considered to be an effective way to obtain a direct band gap in Si NWs towards optoelectronic applications. It was found that for [100] and [111] Si NWs, tensile strain enhanced the direct band gap characteristic, whereas compressive strain attenuated it.177 For 〈112〉 Si NWs, by applying axial compression, an indirect-to-direct band gap transition was also observed.178 Interestingly, by applying a relatively large tensile stress, a direct to indirect band gap transition was observed in 〈110〉 InAs NWs.179
In addition to the band gap type, band gap values are also different for different-oriented NWs due to the different effective confinement lengths and effective masses. Yan et al. calculated that the band gaps of [100] and [111] Si NWs were similar, but distinctly larger than that for the [110] wires.180 Zhang et al. gave the order of energy band gaps for Si NWs with different orientations: 〈100〉 NW > 〈112〉 NW > 〈111〉 NW > 〈110〉 NW.181 A similar dependence of band gap on growth orientation was also observed in III–V NWs. As calculated by Alam et al., the band gaps of the 〈100〉, 〈110〉, and 〈111〉 wires had the same values for wire widths of 8 nm or higher, while for smaller wires, the 〈100〉 wires had the highest band gap, whereas the 〈110〉 wires had the lowest band gap at the same wire width.182
Transport properties
Studies have shown that the carrier transport properties strongly depend on the NW orientation. Neophytou et al. calculated the electron and hole transport properties for Si NWs with different orientations and found that the [110] and secondly the [100] oriented NWs exhibited the best electron transport performances compared to [111] NWs, while the [111] and then the [110] oriented NWs exhibited the highest hole velocities compared to [100] NWs.183,184 Similar results were obtained by other groups.185,186 Buin et al. predicted a room-temperature acoustically limited hole mobility of 2500 cm2 V−1 s−1 for [110] Si NWs, which was nearly three times larger than the bulk acoustically limited Si hole mobility.187 Mori et al. studied the electron transport properties of Ge NW FETs with [001], [110], [111], and [112] orientations and found that a [112] Ge NW FET on the (10) face exhibited the highest injection velocity but low drive current because of its insufficient density of states, while a [110] NW FET on the (001) face had both a large density of states and high injection velocity, achieving the highest drive current.188 Better electron transport performances were obtained in 〈110〉 and 〈111〉 InAs NWs; these originated from the smaller band gaps and lighter effective masses.182
Photovoltaics
The improved crystal quality of non-〈111〉-oriented NWs is promising for high-efficiency photovoltaic devices thanks to the enhancement of carrier transport and suppression of nonradiative recombination. On the other hand, the morphology has a significant impact on light absorption in NW photovoltaic devices. Both experimental measurements and simulations demonstrated that rectangular NWs were more efficient at absorbing light due to the high quality factor of the rectangular cavity.209,210 Unlike the hexagonal cross section commonly observed in 〈111〉 NWs, rectangular cross-sections are widely observed in 〈100〉 and 〈112〉 NWs, which make those non-〈111〉-oriented NWs promising candidates for high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. A 〈112〉 Si NW p–i–n photovoltaic device with a rectangular cross section was fabricated that yielded a dominant mode centered at 570 nm with near-unity external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the transverse-electric polarized spectrum.209 In addition, theoretical studies showed that inclined NW arrays could sufficiently increase the conversion efficiency of solar cells by enhancing light trapping as well as the absorption of light in the active region, which could be easily built by growing non-〈111〉-oriented NWs on a (111) substrate (Fig. 5).211–213

Thermal properties
In addition to electron/hole transport, thermal transport also has a strong relationship with the NW orientation. Based on atomistic calculations, Markussen et al. found that NWs grown along the 〈110〉 direction exhibited 50–75% higher thermal conductance than NWs along the 〈100〉 and 〈111〉 directions;189 this was attributed to the fact that bands in the 〈110〉 Si NWs generally had a larger group velocity than that in other orientations.189–191 The anisotropy of thermal conductivity was also observed in InAs NWs due to their different phonon group velocities. It was found that thermal conductivity along the [110] growth direction was about three times larger than that along the [100] or [111] directions.192 However, thermal conductivity along the [110] direction decreases significantly with an increase in temperature, while thermal conductivity along the [100] or [111] direction is not sensitive to temperature. Xiong et al. experimentally investigated the thermal conductivity properties of 〈110〉 InAs NWs and demonstrated that thermal conductivity could be enhanced by up to 159% through sulfur passivation.193
Applications
FETs
Non-〈111〉-oriented NWs are promising in high-performance FETs due to their excellent crystal quality. Among the common orientations, 〈110〉 has attracted particular attention due to the small effective mass. To date, 〈110〉 NW FETs have been realized in a variety of materials such as Si, Ge, InP, InAs, (In)GaSb, and InSb.115,123,134,135,194–197 A remarkable room-temperature electron mobility of 1438 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for a top-gated FET based on self-catalyzed 〈110〉 InP NWs; this value was much higher than that for 〈111〉 InP NWs with SFs.115 A back-gated FET based on Pd-catalyzed 〈110〉 InAs NWs exhibited a high electron mobility of ∼6415.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, which was several times higher than that of 〈111〉 InAs NWs.123 A high hole mobility of 463 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained from a back-gated FET based on a 〈110〉 In0.09Ga0.91Sb NW, which was similar to that of a MOSFET based on an epitaxial InGaSb film (Fig. 6).135 Despite the outstanding transport property of 〈110〉 NWs, the electron mobilities of 〈110〉 NWs are still lower than those of their bulk or thin-film counterparts. Since the 〈110〉 NWs typically have a defect-free ZB crystal structure, surface state scattering caused by ZB/WZ crystal phase mixing is eliminated, while surface state scattering has a dominant effect on the mobility. To further enhance the mobility of NWs, surface passivation by growing a wide band-gap shell or depositing a dielectric material is demonstrated to be effective.198,199 It is worth noting that, despite superior mobility, 〈110〉 InAs NWs exhibited an inferior threshold voltage (VT), on–off ratio, and subthreshold swing (SS) compared with other higher index orientations such as 〈131〉 and 〈332〉.200 Those high index orientations, however, are rarely reported in NWs and still need further in-depth research.

Photodetectors
Studies have shown that the optical absorption properties are strongly dependent on the NW orientation. Through first-principles calculations, Rehman et al. observed strong optical absorption in [110] directional ZnS–Si core–shell NWs throughout the spectrum from the visible to ultraviolet region, showing great potential for application in high absorption optoelectronic devices.201 On the other hand, as mentioned above, non-〈111〉 NWs, particularly 〈110〉 NWs, exhibit high mobility due to the excellent crystal quality and small effective mass, which results in a short transit time. The short transit time not only increases the speed of the photodetector, but also enhances photoconductive gain.202 Based on the self-catalyzed 〈110〉 InP NWs, a metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photodetector was fabricated that exhibited a low room-temperature dark current of several hundred pA at moderate biases and a remarkable photoresponsivity of 6.8 A W−1.114 Later, a 〈110〉 InP NW photoconductor was demonstrated that exhibited a high responsivity of 5495 A W−1, which was significantly higher than that of most of the reported 〈111〉 InP NW photodetectors.115,203–205 In addition, a fast response/recovery time of 0.6/2.2 ms was obtained, 2–3 orders of magnitude shorter than that reported for 〈111〉 InP NW photodetectors.204–207 An ultra-fast photodetector based on high-mobility 〈110〉 InGaSb NWs, which yielded efficient rise and decay times down to 38 and 53 μs, respectively, much shorter than that of a 〈111〉 InGaSb NW p–n heterojunction photodetector, was also reported (Fig. 7).135,208

Conclusions
In this article, we reviewed the growth techniques, physical properties, and potential applications of non-〈111〉-oriented semiconductor NWs. From a crystallographic point of view, non-〈111〉 NWs can be grown on a certain substrate orientation, with relatively low yield. Growth energetics play a dominant role in the NW orientations, which can be controlled by engineering the NW diameter, catalyst state, and growth conditions such as temperature. Non-〈111〉 NWs can also be formed on the 〈111〉 NW “root” through kinking during VLS growth induced by the instability of the droplet or the solid–liquid interface, suggesting that growth kinetics also has a significant impact on the NW orientation. Using a template is a rough method for obtaining vertical-aligned NWs with desired orientations, but the yield, flexibility, and crystal quality are less than satisfactory. One of the most attractive advantages is that most of the reported non-〈111〉 NWs exhibit an inherently defect-free pure ZB crystal structure, laying the basis for high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices. In addition, non-〈111〉 NWs exhibit different band gap types and values, electron/hole mobility, and thermal conductivity compared with 〈111〉 ones. For example, 〈110〉 Si NWs show much higher electron/hole mobility and thermal conductivity compared with other orientations, showing great potential for application in high speed electronic and high efficiency thermoelectric devices. Based on the high crystal quality and excellent physical properties, several electronic and optoelectronic devices were fabricated or designed based on non-〈111〉 NWs. Remarkable electron/hole mobilities were obtained from 〈110〉 NW FETs, which were much higher than those of the 〈111〉 NWs, and even close to their bulk/thin film counterparts. The 〈110〉 NW photodetectors also show an ultrahigh photoresponsivity and ultrafast speed. Moreover, vertical-aligned 〈100〉 and high-quality in-plane 〈110〉 III–V NWs were demonstrated on Si(100) substrates, promoting the development of NW-based electronic and optoelectronic devices compliant with industry-standard substrates. In addition to the low-index orientations, some high-index orientations such as 〈131〉 and 〈332〉, although rarely reported, exhibit excellent electrical transport properties, which may become a new research hotspot.200
Despite this progress, there is still much to be explored in the area of non-〈111〉-oriented NWs. In comparison with popular 〈111〉-orientated NWs, the physics, growth, and applications of non-〈111〉-oriented NWs are far from mature. Although different methods have been developed to obtain non-〈111〉 NWs, the growth requirements are relatively strict, and the yield and controllability still face great challenges. Therefore, a more universal and simple growth technique is urgently required to be developed, on the basis of a deep understanding of growth energetics and kinetics. Despite plenty of theoretical studies on the physical properties of very thin non-〈111〉 NWs, experimental studies on practical NWs are lacking, limiting people's understanding of this type of NW. Although non-〈111〉 NWs have been applied in FETs and photodetectors, the application potential in other devices, such as lasers, LEDs, and sensors, has not been effectively exploited. In addition, most of the reported devices are based on single non-〈111〉 NWs, whereas more practical NW array devices have not yet been developed. We believe that with further exploration of the fundamental physics and process technologies, non-〈111〉-oriented NWs can emerge as one of the most promising candidates for the development of future electronic and optoelectronic devices.
