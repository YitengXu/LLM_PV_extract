    , Accepted 15th February 2013First published on 18th February 2013AbstractFacile synthesis of TiO2 nanotube branched (length ∼0.5 μm) thin hollow-nanofibers is reported. The hierarchical three dimensional photoanodes (H-TiO2-NFs) (only ∼1 μm thick) demonstrate their excellent candidature as photoanodes in QD-sensitized solar cells, exhibiting ∼3-fold higher energy conversion efficiency (η = 2.8%, Jsc = 8.8 mA cm−2) than that of the directly grown nanotube arrays on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate (η = 0.9%, Jsc = 2.5 mA cm−2).
The mesoscopic sensitized-solar cell is an emerging candidate in electrical power production through direct conversion of solar energy to electrical energy without the greenhouse effect.1 Recently, quantum dot (QD) semiconductors have attracted a great deal of interest as sensitizers in mesoscopic sensitized solar cells.2,3 Because of the outstanding abilities in multiple hot carrier generation, panchromatic solar harnessing and high extinction coefficient, the quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) are becoming the future solar energy conversion systems.4 Many efforts have been invested in developing a wide range of sensitizers; in particular, CdX, PbX, CuInX (X = S, Se, Te) and Ag2S etc., have been tested in QDSCs, resulting in ∼4–6% photo conversion efficiency.5–7 These sensitizers are decorated on a wide band gap metal oxide framework (TiO2, ZnO and SnO2) that acts as a photoanode (selective electron contact). Though QDSCs demonstrate feasible performance utilizing a variety of QD sensitizers, still it requires more improvement to compete with the commercial dye-sensitized solar cells.
Semiconductor QD sensitizers are larger in size than dye molecules; therefore it is difficult to penetrate deeper parts of TiO2 electrodes, thus limiting the sensitizer loadings. Although, the higher extinction coefficient of semiconductor QDs, in comparison with molecular dyes, partially compensates for the loss of the effective surface area and subsequently the decrease in the sensitizer loading, configuring the photoanode framework with a large-pore network is necessary to further promote the QD sensitizer loading.8 In addition, such photoanodes could demonstrate high charge transport from the sensitizer to a charge collector, ultimately overwhelming the charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. Thus, to achieve high sensitizer loading, fast electron transport channel, and good electrolyte pore-filling, establishing vertically aligned nanostructures, in particular, directly synthesized on transparent conductive oxides (TCO), has been identified as the promising approach in dye or QD-sensitized solar cells.9 Most importantly, vertically grown nanotube (NT) arrays have longer electron diffusion length and more benefits in pore-filling of solid state hole transport materials (HTM), compared to disordered TiO2 mesoporous films.10 Diverse methods were demonstrated for the fabrication of TiO2 NT arrays, including electrochemical anodization,11 hydrothermal treatment12 and vapour–liquid–solid methods. Recently, the Gao group developed directly assembled TiO2 NT arrays on TCO using ZnO nanowire templates.13 Though direct assembly of NT arrays on TCO substrates is more adventurous,14 template-based NT arrays have wide tube–tube voids which resulted in less distribution compared to the anodization technique. Besides, such low density of NTs on a TCO substrate markedly lowers the internal surface area of the electrode as well as limits the QD loading.
One simple way to promote the interface surface area of the NT array is to extend its length,15 however there exists a trade-off between the NT length and mechanical stability. Therefore, assembling NT arrays on a highly interconnected 3D fibrous backbone would be a more effective way to achieve high electron transport channels in energy conversion devices.16–18Scheme 1 illustrates the fabrication stages of hierarchical 3-D hollow TiO2 nanofibers (H-TiO2-NFs). Our proposed hierarchical 3-D hollow TiO2 NFs would be the optimum nanostructure for achieving higher sensitizer loading and fast electron transport for QDSCs. In this communication, we demonstrate the fabrication of TiO2 nanotubes branched on TiO2 hollow nanofiber photoanodes, directly grown on TCO, and elucidate their candidature as an excellent photoanodes in QDSCs.

Fig. 1a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of backbone TiO2 NFs confirming the continuous 1D geometry. The distribution of the fiber diameter lies between 200 and 500 nm with an average wall thickness of 20 nm. The ZnO NR templates with an average diameter of ∼25 nm and a length of ∼500 nm were vertically grown on the outer surface of TiO2 NFs which completely covered the backbone (Fig. 1b). After coating the TiO2 thin layer on ZnO NRs, the ZnO templates were finally removed by selective etching (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d shows the QD-sensitized 3-D TiO2 nanotubes branched on TiO2 hollow nanofibers (H-TiO2 NFs). The high resolution TEM images and the selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern reveal that the TiO2 hollow nanofibers possess an anatase phase and polycrystalline nature (Fig. 1e). Fig. 1(f) reveals that the spatially decorated ZnO NT arrays on TiO2 NFs have good contact with the TiO2 backbone. Furthermore, TEM images (Fig. 1g and h) suggest that the TiO2 tubular branches have sufficiently large pore channels for electrolyte filling as well as good structural stability even after removing the ZnO templates and QD sensitization, respectively.

The detailed experimental procedure for the fabrication of hierarchical TiO2 NFs, QD sensitization (CdS/CdSe with a ZnS passivation layer) and QDSC device fabrication steps is explained in the ESI† (see SA and SB). To demonstrate the influence of electrode geometry on photovoltaic performance of QDSCs, the following electrodes were tested as photoanodes in QDSCs: (a) directly grown TiO2 NTs on TCO (TiO2-NT) and (b) hierarchical three dimensional TiO2 nanotubes branched on hollow TiO2 NF (H-TiO2 NF) electrodes. The optical reflection capability of both TiO2-NTs and H-TiO2 NFs is studied by diffused reflectance spectra (Fig. 2a). Under the identical TiO2 nanotube growth conditions, the H-TiO2 NF electrodes show high reflectance compared to TiO2-NTs in the wavelength range of 380–800 nm. This might be attributed to the multiple scattering of incident light at the hierarchical TiO2 NT branches, thus drastically enhancing the reflectance of the electrode. Both QD-sensitized TiO2-NT and H-TiO2 NF electrodes found to exhibit decreased reflectance at wavelengths 610 and 660 nm, respectively, due to the light absorption of the CdS/CdSe sensitizer.

By subtracting the electrode effect from QD-sensitized TiO2 samples, we estimated the optical reflectance of only QDs (-DR) (see ESI,† SD). From Fig. S3 (ESI†), a high -DR was observed at H-TiO2-NFs, which evinces the higher loading of QDs compared to TiO2-NT electrodes. The photovoltaic performance (J–V plots) of TiO2-NT and H-TiO2 NF photoanodes are presented in Fig. 2b and the estimated PV parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The TiO2-NTs directly grown on a FTO electrode resulted in a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of ca. η = 0.9% with photovoltage, Voc = 0.62 V, photocurrent, Jsc = 2.5 mA cm−2 and fill factor, FF = 58.3%. As anticipated, the hierarchical TiO2 nanotube branches grown on a hollow NF backbone show unprecedentedly promoted PCE to η = 2.8% with Voc = 0.61 V, Jsc = 8.8 mA cm−2 and F.F. = 50.3%. It is clearly evident that the TiO2 NTs spatially assembled on the hierarchical 3D-nanofibrous backbone promote the QDSC performance by a factor of three compared to the TiO2 NTs directly grown on a TCO substrate. We can relate the enhancement of photocurrent generation with the H-TiO2 NF photoanodes to several contributions: (a) higher effective surface area and consequently higher QD loading and light harvesting; (b) highly efficient charge collection throughout the photoanode with fewer boundary layers and (c) the multiple scattering effect of the comb-like hierarchical NT arrays, in particular, red photon harvesting (see ESI,† SE and Fig. S4).
On the other hand, it is interesting to point out that Voc values obtained for both devices are similar, in spite of the larger effective surface area of H-TiO2 NFs, for which a higher recombination rate (and consequently lower Voc) is expected. But this is not the case as observed in Fig. 2b, where similar Voc values are observed for both the samples. For further understanding of this behaviour, the QDSC recombination has been analyzed using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The stability of the samples during the impedance measurement was verified by comparing the cyclic voltammograms before and after EIS measurement (see ESI,† SF and Fig. S5). Fig. 3 shows the recombination resistance obtained for the samples analyzed in Fig. 2b. Similar recombination resistances are observed for both samples. Despite the larger effective surface area of H-TiO2 NFs, the recombination resistance does not become significantly higher than the resistance observed for TiO2-NTs.
 Fig. 3  Recombination resistance of TiO2-NT and H-TiO2 NF QDSCs. The inset shows Nyquist plots of the H-TiO2 NF sample at applied voltage, Vapp = 0.57 V. The red solid line is the fit of the experimental data points using the previously described model for EIS analysis of QDSC samples.7 
In this sense, the recombination rate does not increase for the hierarchical sample; rather it decreases as shown in Fig. 3. This may contribute to the significant 3-fold enhancement in the solar cell efficiency observed for the H-TiO2 NFs in comparison with the TiO2-NTs. The huge increase in photocurrent is not deleteriously compensated by a reduction in Voc, giving place for a final efficiency improvement of 310%. In addition, high collection efficiency can be deduced for H-TiO2 NF QDSCs (see ESI,† SG and Fig. S6).
In summary, 3-D hierarchical TiO2 nanotube branches were successfully assembled onto the primary hollow TiO2 nanofibrous backbone. The newly designed H-TiO2 NF photoanode offered large surface area for high QD loading with high light scattering property. In comparison with the NT arrays directly grown on a TCO substrate, the introduction of NTs on the continuous hollow nanofibrous layer results in effective charge collection. In addition, the hierarchical structure enhances effective surface area without altering the recombination rate, as should be expected. The proposed H-TiO2 NF architecture fabricated using the simple protocol can allow wide applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices including QDSCs, DSSCs, photocatalysts and batteries, where highly catalytic/electroactive materials have to be loaded and fast charge transport characteristics are required.
