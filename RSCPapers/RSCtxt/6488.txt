    , Accepted 4th December 2018First published on 4th December 2018AbstractTo improve the charge separation and transport efficiency in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a TiO2-based hybrid mesoscopic/planar architecture, CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 are incorporated into the CH3NH3PbI3 active layer through in situ synthesis to prepare CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2:CH3NH3PbI3 bulk-heterojunction films for PSCs. The incorporated CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 improve the quality of perovskite films. Moreover, Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 can effectively reduce the defect state density on the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal surface, which decreases charge recombination and facilitates charge transport in PSCs. Furthermore, first-principles calculations show that the I atom of CH3NH3PbI3 has a strong interaction with the Cd atom of CdS, which induces interfacial charge redistribution and charge transfer at the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface and therefore decreases the energy of the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS composite system, leading to more efficient electron–hole separation and improved structural stability of the perovskite bulk-heterojunction film. For the above reasons, the CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2:CH3NH3PbI3 bulk-heterojunction cell shows much higher efficiency and better stability than the PSCs with pure CH3NH3PbI3. The highest efficiency reaches 20.1%, which is 1.16 times that (17.3%) of the PSCs with pure CH3NH3PbI3 and is also much higher than those of previously reported CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs with a compact/mesoporous TiO2 film. Our research results may provide a new understanding for improving the structural stability and performance of PSCs.
1. Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on lead trihalide perovskite materials (MAPbX3, MA = CH3NH3+; X = Cl−, I−, and Br−) has increased from 3.8% (ref. 1) to 23.2% (ref. 2) in the past few years, since CH3NH3PbI3 was first used as a visible-light sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).1 According to the development history of PSCs, the device configurations of PSCs are mainly classified into two types: porous and planar architectures. The PSC with a solid mesoporous structure was first proposed by Grätzel and co-workers,3 in which the perovskite acts as both a sensitizer and a hole transporter. Other porous configurations of PSCs, such as meso-superstructure4 and pillared structure,5 were reported subsequently. In general, in PSCs with a porous structure, perovskite crystals are formed within the mesoporous layers that are composed of metal oxide insulators (e.g. Al2O3,4 SiO2,6–8 and ZrO2 (ref. 9)) or semiconductor materials (TiO2,10 ZnO,11 SnO2,12 and NiO13). As the device structure evolved further, the planar structure was proposed. In planar PSCs, the perovskite films are deposited on a compact electron- (TiO2 (ref. 14–17) and ZnO18,19) or hole- (PEDOT:PSS20,21 and NiO22,23) transporting layer. Each architecture has its advantages and disadvantages. There are some advantages of the planar architecture over the porous architecture, such as a lower temperature preparation process, larger perovskite grains, and faster charge mobilities.24,25 However, charge extraction is less effective in the planar architecture than in the porous architecture due to the limited interfacial area between the compact layer and perovskite film in the former case.25 To date, the most efficient PSCs have been fabricated with a TiO2-based hybrid mesoscopic/planar architecture that utilizes the benefits of both planar and porous architectures.26–28 In this hybrid architecture, a mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer is deposited on a compact TiO2 (cp-TiO2) film to act as both the scaffold of the perovskite and the electron-transporting material that has a large TiO2/perovskite interfacial area for electron transfer from the perovskite to TiO2.
So far, extensive investigations into the surface modification and band-gap engineering of TiO2 by doping have been attempted to promote electron transfer from the perovskite to the TiO2 electron-transporting material in PSCs.29–32 In addition to changing the electrical properties of TiO2, to improve the quality and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films for both reduced charge recombination and enhanced charge transport inside the perovskite active layer may be another way to improve the performance of PSCs. For example, a uniform and compact perovskite film composed of large perovskite grains is also a crucial factor for high performance PSCs, because both the grain size and grain boundaries of perovskite crystals have an important effect on charge separation and transport.33,34 Although the CdS thin film has been used as a simple electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells,35,36 the investigations of CdS nanoparticle doped CH3NH3PbI3 (i.e., CH3NH3PbI3:CdS bulk-heterojunction) for PSCs remain rare except for seldom cases.33,37 It is quite difficult to evenly distribute the preformed CdS nanoparticles into the perovskite precursor solvent. Our group has previously developed a strategy to prepare the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS precursor blending solution to fabricate a CH3NH3PbI3:CdS bulk-heterojunction active layer for inverted ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS/PC60BM/Ag cells with Al2O3 as the scaffold.37 With the application of the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS bulk-heterojunction, we got a significantly improved short-circuit current (Jsc) in comparison to those of the counterpart devices based on pure CH3NH3PbI3, and achieved an efficiency of 16.5% in inverted solar cells.
In this study, a novel strategy that combines chemical in situ synthesis and an anti-solvent process is demonstrated. Both CdS and complex [Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2] are incorporated into a pure CH3NH3PbI3 film by a newly developed process which involves spin-coating the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor with cadmium chloride hydrate (2(CdCl2)·5(H2O)) and thiourea onto a mp-TiO2 surface. During the spin-coating process, ethyl ether antisolvent was also used to increase the size of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals and remove the excess thiourea, resulting in CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2:CH3NH3PbI3 (denoted as C:C:CH3NH3PbI3) bulk-heterojunction films with improved perovskite film quality for the fabricated FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au PSCs. By using such a C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 active layer, we achieve an efficiency of 20.1% in the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au solar cells, much higher than that of the pure CH3NH3PbI3-based counterpart devices mainly due to the significantly improved Jsc. The architecture and energy level alignments of the fabricated cells are presented in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. Our results show that the incorporation of CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 into CH3NH3PbI3 significantly improved the quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 film and reduced the trap state density in the perovskite, which suppresses charge recombination and improves charge transport inside the perovskite layer for significantly improved Jsc. Furthermore, the formed CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface also plays an important role in promoting charge separation and maintaining the performance stability of the as-prepared PSCs. As a result, the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 bulk-heterojunction PSCs have a much higher stability than the counterpart devices based on pure CH3NH3PbI3.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and preparation of the precursor solution
Titanium butoxide (≥99.0%), acetylacetone (≥99.5%), bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) (99%), chlorobenzene (OCB, 99.5%), and cadmium chloride (CdCl2, 99%) were purchased from Aladdin. Methylammonium iodide (MAI, ≥99.5%) and lead iodide (PbI2, ≥99.9%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp (China). 4-tert-Butylpyridine (96%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Spiro-OMeTAD (>99%) and thiourea (CS(NH2)2, 99%) were purchased from Derthon Co Lid and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd, respectively. Before use, CdCl2 was placed in air for adequate moisture absorption to form 2(CdCl2)·5(H2O). Other reagents were used without further purification.
FTO glass substrates were first etched with zinc powder and HCl and then subsequently cleaned with deionized water, isopropyl alcohol and acetone with an ultrasonic cleaner for 15 min. The cp-TiO2 thin films were synthesized. Titanium tetraisobutanolate (1 ml), glacial acetic acid (1 ml) and acetaldehyde acetonide (1 ml) were gradually added into the absolute ethanol solution (9 ml) at room temperature with stirring for 2 h. After that, deionized water (1 ml) was slowly added and the obtained solution was stirred for a day to obtain an orange sol. A mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer was deposited by spin-coating TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NR-T) diluted in anhydrous ethanol at 1:7 by weight. The pure perovskite precursor was prepared with an N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of 1 M MAI (CH3NH3I) and 1 M PbI2 (1:1 molar ratio). In addition, 0.03 mM CdCl2 and 0.09 mM thiourea in a molar ratio of 1:3 were added to the pure CH3NH3PbI3 precursor to prepare the CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2:CH3NH3PbI3 (C:C:CH3NH3PbI3) precursor solution. The metal complex [Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2] and CdS were synthesized following the reaction,CS(NH2)2 (thiourea) + CdCl2 → Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2;Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 → CdS + NH4CdCl3.
0.03 mM CdCl2 and 0.09 mM thiourea were dissolved into the pure DMF solution to prepare the complex Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 precursor solution. Then, the precursor solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s to obtain the CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 film after 100 °C hot treatment (10 min).
The hole-transport layer (HTL) was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 29 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine and 18 μl of a stock solution of 520 mg ml−1 bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) solution (260 mg in 0.5 ml acetonitrile) in 1 ml chlorobenzene.
2.2 Fabrication of solar cells
The previously prepared TiO2 sol–gel was spin-coated onto clean FTO glasses at 6500 rpm for 30 s and then the films were heated at 500 °C for 30 min to obtain 40 nm thick cp-TiO2 films. The TiO2 nano-dispersion was further spin-coated onto the FTO/cp-TiO2 films at 3000 rpm for 30 s, after which the films were calcined at 300 °C for 10 min and then heated to 500 °C and held for 30 min at this temperature to obtain FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 films. The C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 precursor layer was deposited on the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 film by spin-coating the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS precursor solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s. After the first 10 s of the spin coating process, the ethyl ether solution was quickly dropped onto the film. The films were then dried at 100 °C for 10 min. A pre-prepared spiro-OMeTAD solution with additives was spin-coated onto FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS at 4500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm thick Au was thermally evaporated as the counter electrode. The active area of the devices was defined as 0.04 cm2 using a metal mask.
2.3 Device characterization
SEM images were observed by using a scanning electron microscope (JSM-7001F, Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co, Japan). The XRD pattern and surface photovoltage spectrum were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (DX-2700, Dandong Haoyuan Instrument Company, China) and a surface photovoltage spectrometer (Beijing Zhuoli Hanguang Instrument Co., Ltd. China), respectively. It should be noted that, in order to eliminate the interference of TiO2, the CH3NH3PbI3, CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2, and C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 thin films were prepared directly by spin-coating the corresponding precursor solution on cleaned glass substrates. After drying at 100 °C for 10 min, the as-prepared films were used for XRD tests. Furthermore, the CH3NH3PbI3, C:C:CH3NH3PbI3, and CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 powders were scraped off from the corresponding substrate with the purchased pure thiourea powder for the infrared spectroscopy study. Infrared spectroscopy was performed using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (VERTEX80v, Bruker). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent Technologies (China) Co. Ltd. Australia). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence decay dynamics were obtained using a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer system with a Xe 900 (450 W xenon arc lamp) as the light source and an Edinburgh Instrument FLS 980 photoluminescence spectrometer, respectively. Reconvolution fit analysis was used to fit a measured sample decay to a model function with three exponential terms. The quality of the fit was estimated using the parameter χ2 (0.90 ≤ χ2 ≤ 1.10) and the symmetrical distribution of the residuals about the zero axis.37 AFM was performed using a Bruker AFM (Multimode 8.0, Bruker Co, USA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were performed using a JEOL-2010 microscope under an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. To exclude the influence of TiO2 nanoparticles, the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 blend sample was first deposited on clear glass substrates and then a portion of the sample was scratched in 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution (DCB), followed by ultrasonication for a few minutes. Finally, a drop of DCB was placed on a copper grid to dry. After that, the grids with samples were subjected to TEM measurements. IPCE spectra were recorded using a solar cell quantum efficiency test system (Qtest Station 500ADX, United States dawn Technology Co., Ltd. USA). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2410 sourcemeter (Cleveland, OH, USA) under illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity is calibrated using a Si reference cell certificated by JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards). During the J–V measurements, the FTO and Au contacts were taken as negative and positive electrodes, respectively. The J–V curves were measured along the reverse scan direction from −0.1 V to 1.2 V or the forward scan direction from 1.2 V to −0.1 V. The scanning rate is 20 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded using a CHI660E (Chenhua Device Company, Shanghai, China) electrochemical measurement system under illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The measured EIS results were simulated using Z-view software. The details about the first-principles calculations are presented in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
In order to confirm the chemical composition and structure of the as-synthesized films, XRD technology was used.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 film and the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid film prepared from the mixed precursor solution with PbI2, CH3NH3I, CdCl2 and thiourea. The pristine CH3NH3PbI3 film exhibited (110), (112), and (200) structures at 14.2°, 19.9°, and 28.46° of 2θ angles, agreeing well with the reported patterns.38 For the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid film, two strong perovskite diffraction peaks at 14.2° and 28.46° of 2θ were found, proving that CH3NH3PbI3 crystals existed in the hybrid film. To obtain more details, XRD data collected at 2θ from 27.0° to 29.1°, from 55° to 60.1°, and from 11° to 14.9° are shown in Fig. 2b, c and d, respectively. Two peaks at 28.2° and 58.3° can be clearly observed from Fig. 2b and c, which are indexed to the (101) and (202) lattice planes of hexagonal CdS (PDF#01-074-9663), respectively, confirming the presence of CdS. From Fig. 2d, the diffraction peak of the tetragonal Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 (111) plane (PDF#01-074-2685) in the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid film was found, confirming the formation of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2. The existence of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 and CdS is due to the partial decomposition of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 at 100 °C in accordance with the chemical reaction: Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 → CdS + NH4CdCl3.39

In order to further analyze the chemical composition of thin films, FT-IR spectroscopy was used to characterize thiourea, the chemical reaction products of CdCl2 and thiourea, CH3NH3PbI3, and C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 powders and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The peaks of FTIR spectra of the chemical reaction products of CdCl2 and thiourea are consistent with the reported Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 results,39 confirming the formation of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2. Furthermore, the CS stretching vibration was observed at 740 cm−1 for pure thiourea, which was shifted to 717 cm−1 for the complex phase Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2, and was further shifted to 711 cm−1 for the CdS + Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2+ CH3NH3PbI3 film. When thiourea was combined with CdCl2, the force constant of CS decreased due to the electrostatic attraction between Cd2+ and the electron cloud of CS because the frequency was proportional to the square root of the force constant.40 When thiourea was combined with both CdCl2 and PbI2 in the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor, Pb2+ would further attract a partial electron cloud from CS to S·Pb, which resulted in a greater reduction in the CS stretching vibration frequency, which was similar to the phenomenon reported by another group.41 Moreover, it was also found that the FT-IR absorption peak (1097 cm−1) of the CS vibrational mode of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 or CdS + Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 + CH3NH3PbI3 is slightly blue-shifted compared to that of pure thiourea (1085 cm−1) (Fig. 3b), which can be attributed to the formation of the Cd–S bond and therefore proved the existence of CdS in the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film. Besides, the FT-IR absorption peak of the N–H stretching modes in CH3NH3PbI3 is located at about 3200 cm−1.42,43 In our case, the N–H stretching modes in pure CH3NH3PbI3 red-shifted to 3114 cm−1 from 3190 cm−1 due to the electrostatic attraction between Cl− and CH3NH3+, which is similar to the reported red shift phenomenon resulting from the electrical attraction interaction between Se2− and cationic CH3NH3+.44 Therefore, considering the XRD and FTIR results, it can be concluded that CH3NH3PbI3, CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 coexist in the perovskite layer.
 Fig. 3  FTIR spectra of pure thiourea, Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2, pristine CH3NH3PbI3, and C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 in the regions (a) 300–3750 cm−1 and (b) 950–1200 cm−1. 
The top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 film is shown in Fig. S1,† which clearly displays the mp-TiO2 pores and the TiO2 nanoparticles with an average particle size of 20 nm in the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 film. Fig. 4a and b show the top-view SEM images of the pure CH3NH3PbI3 and CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2:CH3NH3PbI3 capping layers on the top of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 films at 100000× magnification, respectively. For both capping layers, the formed pure CH3NH3PbI3 and C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 thin films had full surface coverage on the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 films. The CH3NH3PbI3 grain size in the anti-solvent treated FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film varies from tens of nanometers to 300 nm (Fig. 4a), which is significantly larger than that (from tens of nanometers to more than one hundred nanometers) of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals in the previously prepared ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film without anti-solvent treatment.37 The main reason is that the anti-solvent precipitation method increases the size of perovskite crystals due to rapid extraction of DMF using an anti-solvent. After adding thiourea and CdCl2 to the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution, a more compact C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer was found (Fig. 4b) and the perovskite grain size in the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film significantly increased and varied from more than 100 nm to 900 nm, which is much larger than that of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film (Fig. 4a). The main reason might be due to the introduced thiourea that increased the CH3NH3PbI3 size by forming the intermediate phase CH3NH3I·PbI2·SC(NH2)2.41 The root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the film was examined by AFM, as shown in Fig. S2.† Apparently, the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film with a small rms value of 7.42 nm showed a more flattened surface compared to the pure CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer with a rms value of 10.45 nm. To investigate the effect of CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 on the thickness of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film, Fig. 4c and d display the cross-sectional SEM images of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 films, respectively. It can be observed that, for both films, the thicknesses of the cp-TiO2, mp-TiO2, and perovskite capping layers are 50 nm, 250 nm, and 300 nm, respectively. Therefore, these SEM and AFM results confirm that the incorporation of CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 improves the compactness and flatness of the perovskite film and does not change the thickness of the perovskite layer. To verify the uniformity of the element distribution, a SEM image of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film at 20000× magnification is shown in Fig. S3a† and the corresponding element mapping analysis is illustrated in Fig. S3b–f.† The Cd and S element distributions fully demonstrate the uniformity of CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 distribution in the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film.

To study the atomic structures of the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 composite film, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-magnification TEM (HR-TEM) are used to characterize the formed structure. The low-magnification TEM image of C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 after ultrasonic dispersion treatment is displayed in Fig. S4,† which clearly shows CdS nanoparticles with small size on the surface of large size CH3NH3PbI3 crystals. To further determine the size of the CH3NH3PbI3 and CdS nanoparticles, the corresponding magnified TEM image is displayed in Fig. S5a,† which clearly shows the adsorption of the about 10 nm spherical CdS nanoparticles (marked by yellow circles) onto the surface of 140 nm diamond CH3NH3PbI3 crystals, suggesting the coexistence of CH3NH3PbI3 and CdS in the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS composite film. The inset in Fig. S5a† shows a lattice fringe spacing of 0.357 nm, which corresponds to the (400) planes of orthorhombic CdS. Fig. S5b† shows the HR-TEM image of one diamond CH3NH3PbI3 crystal, which displays a lattice fringe spacing of 0.317 nm, corresponding to the (220) plane of the tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3. These TEM results show the conformation of the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS composite film consisting of CH3NH3PbI3 and CdS crystals.
For exploring the effect of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 on charge transfer in the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 bulk-heterojunction film, the conduction and valence band-edge (CB and VB) energies of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 are first studied by first-principles calculations, as displayed in Fig. 5, for more details see ESI.† The calculated CB and VB energies of CH3NH3PbI3 with respect to its Fermi level are about 1.50 eV and 0 eV, respectively, corresponding to −3.90 eV and −5.40 eV with respect to the vacuum energy level, while the calculated CB and VB energies of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 with respect to its Fermi level are 3.54 eV and 0.08 eV, respectively. Thus it can be deduced that the CB and VB levels of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 with respect to the vacuum energy level are −1.86 eV and −5.32 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1b.

Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2, FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3, and FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 films, respectively. The exponential shaped absorption line of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 film shows that the film absorbs mainly UV light with wavelengths smaller than 400 nm, which corresponds to the light absorption properties of TiO2 and confirms the formation of TiO2. The absorption spectra of the CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 film are displayed in Fig. S6,† which shows main light absorption in the 300–375 nm wavelength region. After coating CH3NH3PbI3 on the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 film, increased absorption properties in the 375–800 nm wavelength region can be found for both FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3, and FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 films, which can be ascribed to the light absorption of the perovskite layers. Furthermore, compared to FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 without CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2, FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 shows stronger spectral absorption in the 300–550 nm wavelength range, which can be mainly attributed to the light absorption of formed CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2.

(b) Photoluminescence spectra of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 films, excitation at 515 nm.

Fig. 6b shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 films. An excitation wavelength of 515 nm was used. For both films, the PL peak is located around 772 nm, which is characteristic of the applied perovskite absorber CH3NH3Pb3. Moreover, the PL intensity of FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 is much lower than that of FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3. The larger the perovskite crystal particles, the fewer defects exist on the surface of the perovskite surface or perovskite grain boundaries in the perovskite.45,46 Since the perovskite grain size in the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film increases compared to the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film (Fig. 4), the PL intensity should increase due to less non-radiative recombination loss after the incorporation of CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2, which is contrary to the obtained experimental results. Therefore, the decreased PL intensity of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film can only be explained by more efficient charge separation and faster transfer at the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3/CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 interfaces. According to the energy level diagram shown in Fig. 1b, photo-generated electrons in CH3NH3PbI3 for FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 can only transfer to TiO2 through the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 interface. However, for the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film, the electron can transfer simultaneously to TiO2 and CdS through both CH3NH3Pb3/TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interfaces, which would lead to a quenched PL emission of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film. Meanwhile, the hole may transfer from CH3NH3Pb3 to Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 through the CH3NH3PbI3/Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 interface due to the higher VB level (−5.32 eV) of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 than that (−5.40 eV) of CH3NH3PbI3. In short, the addition of two interfaces (i.e., CH3NH3PbI3/CdS and CH3NH3PbI3/Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2) in the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 composite film can simultaneously extract electrons and holes from the perovskite, which will greatly improve the charge separation and transfer efficiency. To support this explanation, the time-resolved PL decay transients detected at 775 nm are displayed in Fig. 6c, which shows that the carrier lifetime (23.04 ns) of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film is much shorter than that (80.14 ns) of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film, indicating more efficient charge separation and transfer in the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film.
To further evaluate photo-induced charge separation and transfer on surfaces and at interfaces, the surface photovoltage technique is adopted. Fig. 6d shows the surface photovoltage spectrum (SPV) of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 films. The positive photovoltaic signals are due to the hole drift toward the surface of the perovskite films.47 For the film with pure CH3NH3PbI3, the SPV response is attributed to the hole accumulation at the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer after the electron transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to mesoscopic TiO2. However, for the perovskite film with CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2, charge transfer can occur not only through the mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface but also through the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS and CH3NH3PbI3/Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 interfaces (Fig. 1b), which leads to more efficient charge separation and achieves a higher hole concentration at the surface of the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer. Furthermore, for the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 capping layers, the separated electrons and holes exist in different material phases, while for the pure CH3NH3PbI3 capping layers, electrons and holes exist in the perovskite simultaneously. Therefore, the probability of charge recombination in C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 layers may be much lower than that in the pure perovskite layer due to the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer. The SPV results further confirm the more efficient charge separation in the film due to the incorporation of CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2.

Fig. 7a shows the forward and reverse scanning J–V curves measured under simulated AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 irradiance and dark conditions for the best-performing FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au and FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au solar cells. The extracted performance parameters are listed in Table 1. The most efficient FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au cell had an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.1 V, a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 21.27 ± 0.43 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.74, corresponding to a PCE of 17.31%, while the most efficient cell with CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 had an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.1 V, a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 24.34 ± 0.44 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.75, yielding a PCE of 20.1%. Compared to the PSCs with pure CH3NH3PbI3, the highest PCE (20.1%) of PSCs with C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 has been improved by 16.2%, which is also much higher than those (<19.3%) of reported TiO2-based CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs.30,31 Obviously, the cell with C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits an increase in Jsc and PCE in comparison to the cell with the pure CH3NH3PbI3 active layer.

It is worth noting that, compared with the surface photovoltage difference between the pure CH3NH3PbI3 film and C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film (Fig. 6d), the Voc difference between the cell with the pure CH3NH3PbI3 film and the cell with the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film is much smaller. Commonly, the information detected by SPV technology is mainly the properties of the surface layer of the sample (usually tens of nanometers), so it is not affected by the substrate or the bulk, which is important for the study of the properties of the photosensitive surface and the process of interfacial electron transfer. In our case, SPV technology is used to measure the surface photovoltage of the samples (i.e., FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 films) under the irradiation of monochromatic light. For these two films, the top layers are pure CH3NH3PbI3 and C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 films, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. Considering that the detection depth of SPV is smaller than the thicknesses (>100 nanometers) of the top layers (i.e., pure CH3NH3PbI3 and C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 top layers) of these two films (Fig. 4c and d), the surface photovoltage originates from the accumulation of holes on the surfaces of the pure CH3NH3PbI3 and C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 films after light excitation and the influence of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 substrate on the measured surface photovoltage may not be a major factor. The C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film shows a higher surface photovoltage compared to the CH3NH3PbI3 film, indicating more effective charge separation in the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film after the incorporation of CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2. However, for complete devices, i.e., FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au and FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au cells, The Voc is affected by many factors, including the energy level matching between the electrode and the active layer material, charge recombination in the active layer, the transport resistance of the electron and hole transport layers, etc. As shown in Fig. 7a, the Voc difference between these two cells is not obvious. Nevertheless, the Jsc of the cell with the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film is much higher than that of the cell with the pure CH3NH3PbI3 film, suggesting more effective charge separation in the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film, which is consistent with the SPV result.
The effect of deposited CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 on the electronic charge transport properties of the cells is further studied by comparing the J–V hysteresis, as shown in Fig. 7a. The changes between forward and reverse scan directions for both cells are small, yet the cell with CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 shows less hysteresis than the cell with the pure perovskite film, which can be further proved from the data in Table 1. For the cell without CdS, the PCE is 16.8% under reverse scan conditions, which is 0.97 times that (17.3%) under forward scan conditions. For the cell with CdS, the PCE is 19.6% under reverse scan conditions, which is 0.98 times that (20.2%) under forward scan conditions. Therefore, for the cell with CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2, the obtained PCE from the reverse scanning is closer to that obtained from the forward scanning. The slightly decreased hysteresis could be associated with increased perovskite crystal size and efficient charge collection due to the introduction of CdS.6,48Fig. 7b compares the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for PSCs, and shows that the cell with CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 has a stronger IPCE response than the cell with pure perovskite in the wavelength range 450–750 nm. This result can be associated with better charge extraction and recombination reduction.10 The calculated Jsc values determined by integration of the IPCE values are 22.7 mA cm−2 and 20.7 mA cm−2 for the bulk-heterojunction cell with the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film and the cell with the pure CH3NH3PbI3 film, respectively, which are close to the measured Jsc values.
To evaluate the influence of CdS on the long-term stability of PSCs, the time-dependent PCE retentions were investigated using current J–V characteristics for 240 h without any encapsulation process, which is shown in Fig. 7c. The cell without CdS lost 76.6% of its original efficiency within 240 h, compared to a 13.8% reduction in the PCE of the cell with CdS under the same period and conditions. One obvious reason for the improved stability of PSCs with CdS may be the enhanced compactness of the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS composite film (Fig. 4), which slows the penetration of moisture and oxygen into the perovskite active layer. For the cell with the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 film, the increase of PCE in the first 50 hours might be due to the charge accumulation at the TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 and C:C:CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces.
In order to investigate deeply the reasons for the improved performance and stability of the PSCs with CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 at the atomic scale, the trap state density (ntrap), atomic interface structures and electrical properties are studied. Generally, there are two typical charge recombination processes in perovskite solar cells, namely monomolecular recombination and bimolecular recombination,49 which can be studied through the relationship between Voc (or natural logarithm of light intensity ln(Jsc)) and the natural logarithm of light intensity ln(I). The slope of 1kbT/e represents the bimolecular recombination process, while the slope will gradually get closer to 2kbT/e with the increasing degree of monomolecular (or trap-assisted) recombination, indicating that the monomolecular recombination process or trap-assisted recombination is involved. From the relationship between Jsc and light intensity I shown in Fig. 8a, it is found that the slope (1.0) of the cell with C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 is lower than that (1.02) of the cell with pure CH3NH3PbI3. Similarly, from the relationship between Voc and light intensity I shown in Fig. 8b, it is found that the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 cell also represents a lower slope (1.09) compared with that (1.16) of the pure CH3NH3PbI3 cell.

Therefore, the dependence of Jsc and Voc on I suggests that the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 cell showed a lower degree of monomolecular recombination compared to the cell with pure perovskite and therefore should have a lower trap state density (ntrap).49 To prove this conclusion, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement is employed for the cell with the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 active layer and the cell with the pure perovskite layer, as shown in Fig. 8c. With the increase of the applied bias voltage, the defect state will be filled by the injected charge gradually. When the applied bias voltage exceeds the defect state filling voltage (VTFL), the current will increase rapidly and nonlinearly. The ntrap can be calculated using the equation ntrap = 2ε0εVTFL/eL2, where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (ε0 = 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), ε is the dielectric constant of CH3NH3PbI3 (ε = 32), e (=1.6 × 10−19 C) is the elementary charge, and L is the thickness of the active layer. As shown in Fig. 8c, after the incorporation of CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2, the VTFL drops from 0.14 V to 0.09 V for the cell with the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 active layer. Consequentially, the calculated ntrap decreases from 1.72 × 1015 cm−3 to 1.05 × 1015 cm−3, which suggests that the defects in CH3NH3PbI3 have been passivated effectively in the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 active layer. For this phenomenon, a possible explanation from the atomic level is given. It has been previously reported that the under-coordinated metal cations and halide anions at the perovskite crystal surface are the main reasons for the trap states of the perovskite,50,51 which would cause severe potential wells at perovskite grain boundaries, slowing down charge transport and increasing charge recombination. In the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 layer, in the absence of the iodine ion, the Cl− of Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 may play an electrostatic attraction role of I− to the ammonium ion to a certain extent through the CH3NH3PbI3/Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 interface, thus reducing the defect state and maintaining the stability of the perovskite structure.52
The atomic interface structures and electrical properties at the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface were studied using DFT calculations. Similar to the reported calculation process,53 CH3NH3PbI3 was used as the model system and the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS heterojunction was made of the CH3NH3PbI3 (001) surface and CdS (001) surface because the CH3NH3PbI3 (001) surface is most stable. After systematic calculations, it is found that the PbI2 plane of CH3NH3PbI3 has a stronger interaction with CdS compared to the CH3NH3 plane. The calculation results for the PbI2 plane of CH3NH3PbI3 in contact with CdS are displayed in Fig. 9, which clearly shows that both the CH3NH3PbI3 and CdS sides at the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface exhibit a severe structural change. In particular, the I atoms are protruded out of the PbI2 plane indicating a strong interaction with CdS. Furthermore, it can be found from the local charge density redistribution in the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface region (inset of Fig. 9) that a large number of green electron accumulation regions appear between I atoms and Cd atoms, suggesting a strong bonding interaction. Moreover, more blue electron depleted regions appear near the Pb and I atoms, which indicate electron transfer from PbI2 to CdS. Therefore, the charge interaction at the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface induces interfacial charge redistribution and electron transfer between CH3NH3PbI3 and CdS, which may greatly improve electron–hole separation in the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS active layer, beneficial to the performance improvement of PSCs.
 Fig. 9  Interfacial bonding interaction and charge redistribution at the interface of PbI2 of CH3NH3PbI3 in contact with the Cd plane of CdS (isovalue = 0.0125 e Å−3). Atomic color codes are: S (yellow), Cd (bright purple), I (dark purple), and Pb (grey). The green color and blue color represent charge accumulation and charge depletion, respectively. 
In order to investigate the structural stability of the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface system, the binding energy Eb = [E(CH3NH3PbI3) + E(CdS) − E(CH3NH3PbI3/CdS)]/A of the interface systems is calculated, in which E(CH3NH3PbI3) and E(CdS) are the total energies of the CH3NH3PbI3 and CdS films before the formation of the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface, respectively. E(CH3NH3PbI3/CdS) is the energy of the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS composite film after the interface formation. A is the surface area of the supercell. The calculated Eb equals 49.6 meV Å−2, which is even much larger than the reported 27.3 meV Å−2 for the CH3NH3PbI3/CdSe system.53 Therefore, this calculated binding energy strongly supports the formation of CdS nanoparticles on the CH3NH3PbI3 surface forming a CH3NH3PbI3:CdS system with lower energy, which undoubtedly enhances the stability of CH3NH3PbI3:CdS bulk heterojunction PSCs.
The effect of CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 on the charge transport properties of the PSCs was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS of the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au and FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/C:C:CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au cells were measured at an applied bias V = 0 V and a frequency range from 100 mHZ to 1 MHZ under illumination. The obtained Nyquist plots consisting of two semicircular arcs are shown in Fig. S7a† and the corresponding EIS data are analyzed by fitting to an equivalent circuit model (Fig. S7b†).54,55 The series resistance of the cell is represented by Rs. The semicircles in the high (left arc) and low frequency regions correspond to the resistance RHTM of hole transport materials and the charge recombination resistance Rrec of the cell, respectively. CHTM and Cμ are the capacitance of hole transport materials and the chemical capacitance of the cell, respectively. The detailed fitting parameters are presented in Table S1.† The cell with CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 exhibited a larger high frequency arc than the cell without pure perovskite (Fig. S7a†), which corresponds to an increased Rrec value of the cell with CdS (Table S1†). Therefore, charge recombination is suppressed due to the decreased ntrap at perovskite grain boundaries and enhanced charge separation efficiency, which also contributes to the increased Jsc in the cell with CdS.
4. Conclusions
High-efficiency CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2:CH3NH3PbI3 bulk-heterojunction PSCs with a TiO2-based hybrid mesoscopic/planar architecture are successfully fabricated, during which a more larger perovskite crystal size and more compact and flat perovskite morphology are obtained compared to the pure perovskite film. Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 promotes hole transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 and decreases the defect density of states in CH3NH3PbI3, which promotes charge separation and facilitates charge transport between perovskite crystal particles. Moreover, due to the strong interfacial bonding interaction and charge redistribution at the interface of the PbI2 plane of CH3NH3PbI3 in contact with the Cd plane of CdS, the incorporated CdS does not only lead to more efficient charge separation and better charge transfer in the C:C:CH3NH3PbI3 bulk-heterojunction film compared to the pure CH3NH3PbI3 film, but also enhances the structural stability of CH3NH3PbI3. As a result, the PSCs with CdS and Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2 exhibit a significantly enhanced efficiency compared with the PSCs with pure perovskite in terms of 16.7% improvement in the PCE. The maximum power conversion efficiency of 20.1% of the PSCs with CdS is also much higher than those of the TiO2-based CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs with a similar architecture. The bulk-heterojunction PSCs also exhibit an enhanced stability by maintaining 86.2% of the initial efficiency for a span of 240 h. The high efficiency and enhanced stability of the CdS:Cd(SCN2H4)2Cl2:CH3NH3PbI3 bulk-heterojunction PSCs fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods we have adopted. Our research results provide new insights into improving the performance of perovskite solar cells.
