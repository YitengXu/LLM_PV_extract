    , Accepted 2nd March 2021First published on 2nd March 2021AbstractSurface properties of all-inorganic halide perovskites play a crucial role in determining optoelectronic performance of these materials. We investigate the surface energies and electronic structures of cubic CsPbBr3 surfaces systematically using density functional theory (DFT) methods. We calculate the surface phase diagrams of low-index surfaces of CsPbBr3, i.e., (100), (110), (111) surfaces. We found that nonpolar (100) surfaces are more stable than polar (110) and (111) surfaces. The nonpolar CsBr-terminated (100) surface shows the best stability, which is attributed to the effect of surface relaxation and high ionicity of the surface layer. The electronic structures reveal that charge transfer to compensate the polarity raises the energy of polar surfaces, which makes polar surfaces unstable. Furthermore, we found that the modulation of surface chemical composition provides an effective way to compensate polarity and thus make polar surfaces of CsPbBr3 stable. Our results provide physical insights into understanding and further enhancing the surface stability of all-inorganic halide perovskites. This would be helpful in promoting the advancement of all-inorganic halide perovskite-based materials and devices.
1. Introduction
Halide perovskites have attracted intensive research attention due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties which make them very promising in developing optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers.1,2 They exhibit striking semiconducting properties such as long carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths,3–5 tunable bandgap,6,7 and strong absorption for visible light.8 Moreover, halide perovskites with high crystallinity can be fabricated from low cost methods such as low-temperature solution methods.9,10 These excellent physical and chemical properties are corroborated with the rapid promotion of optoelectronic efficiency for devices based on halide perovskites. For example, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of halide perovskite solar cells were improved rapidly from 3.8% to the recent 25.5% in the last decade.11–16 However, the long-term stability of these materials and devices is the main obstacle for their wide applications.17,18
Recently, all-inorganic halide perovskites such as CsPbBr3, CsPbI3 and their alloys [CsPbBrxI3−x] have received special attention due to their much better stability than organic–inorganic partners (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3).19,20 Moreover, all-inorganic halide perovskites also exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties, similar to organic–inorganic perovskites. For example, solar cells based on CsPbI3 show high PCE up to 18%.21 Also, all-inorganic perovskites display narrow photoluminescence emission and high photoluminescence quantum yields,6e.g. >90% quantum yields for CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs),22,23 which makes them very promising candidates in high performances LEDs.6,24 Apart from the excellent properties of halide perovskites, surfaces and interfaces of perovskites play critical roles in determining the quality and performance of the devices.25,26 This poses an urgent requirement to have a good understanding of surface properties of all-inorganic perovskites.
Surface properties (surface energy, atomic structures, electronic structures etc.) make a large difference to the stability of the materials and the performance of devices, especially in nanocrystals because of large surface-to-bulk ratio. For example, previous studies showed that surface energy influences the stability of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals6,27 and even could stabilize CsPbI3 nanocrystals in a meta-stable cubic phase via reducing nanocrystal size or strain effect.28–30 Furthermore, surface energy affects the surface morphology and the growth of all-inorganic halide perovskites.31,32 Recently, CsPbBr3 nano-wires in a cubic phase with triangular prism shape have been synthetized via surface-guided growth methods.33–35 Interestingly, the CsPbBr3 triangular prisms expose their (100) and (010) facets to gas phase and (110) facet contacting substrates such as mica and sapphire. Besides, 2D CsPbBr3 with a thickness of several unit cells has been experimentally identified to have CsBr-terminated (100) surfaces.36 These results imply special stability of (100) surfaces, which is also supported by theoretical results.37 However, relative stability of low-index surfaces such as (100), (110) and (111) surfaces of typical all-inorganic halide perovskites (e.g. CsPbBr3) with varied chemical potentials and surface chemical compositions, i.e., surface phase diagram, remains in large part unknown. Moreover, it is not very clear which kind of strategy could compensate for the polarity of polar surfaces (e.g. (110) and (111) surfaces) effectively and make these surfaces stable in halide perovskites. Therefore, the stability of low-index surfaces of all-inorganic halide perovskites and further the origin of stability have not yet been fully understood.
In this work, we investigate the surface properties of cubic CsPbBr3 from the atomic and electronic level using density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles calculation methods. We focus on the cubic phase not only because of its prototype structure of perovskites, but also for its wide application at the nanoscale. Other perovskites phases are commonly considered as pseudo-cubic phases, and show rotations and tilts with respect to cubic phase. We calculate the surface energies and phase diagrams of common low-index surfaces of CsPbBr3, i.e., (100), (110), (111) surfaces. Furthermore, the electronic structures of CsPbBr3 surfaces are calculated to obtain a deep understanding about the origin of stability of polar and nonpolar surfaces.
2. Computational details
We performed total energy and electronic structure calculations using density functional theory (DFT) within the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).38,39 Electron–core interaction is described in the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method.40 PBEsol is utilized as the exchange–correlation functional.41 A kinetic energy cutoff of 350 eV is used in calculations. A Monkhorst–Pack42 mesh of 8 × 8 × 8 is used for the cubic perovskite unit cell and scaled meshes are used for slabs. We calculated the lattice constant of cubic CsPbBr3 to be 5.862 Å, which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 5.868 Å.43 Surface models are built from the optimized cubic structure. The convergence criteria of forces in structure relaxation are 0.01 eV Å−1.
We consider common low-index surfaces of cubic CsPbBr3: (100), (110), (111) surfaces (Fig. 1a). Along the [100] direction, CsPbBr3 shows –[CsBr-PbBr2]– layer stacking order (Fig. 1b). This stacking order leads to two terminations for (100) surfaces, i.e., CsBr- and PbBr2-, marked as (100)-CsBr and (100)-PbBr2, respectively. Assuming formal charge states for all ions (Cs+, Pb2+ and Br−), both CsBr and PbBr2 surface layers are neutral. Along the [110] direction, CsPbBr3 consists of alternating charged (CsPbBr)2+ and (Br2)2− layers and thus these two terminations are polar (Fig. 1c) (marked as (110)-CsPbBr and (110)-Br2). Similarly, along the [111] direction, CsPbBr3 displays the order of alternating charged (Pb)2+ and (CsBr3)2− layers, and thus ideal (111) surfaces also possess polarity (Fig. 1f) (marked as (111)-Pb and (111)-CsBr3). Along the polar direction, CsPbBr3 films act as a stacking of dipoles which are formed between adjacent layers with inverse charges. Electrostatic potential in these polar thin films diverges with increasing thickness, which makes polar surfaces unstable.44
 Fig. 1  Structural models of CsPbBr3 bulk and surfaces (cyan big ball: Cs; black middle: Pb, brown small: Br): (a) Cubic structure of CsPbBr3 with three planes cut through the bulk (red for (100), blue for (110), magenta for (111)); (b) (100) surfaces with two types of terminations: CsBr- and PbBr2-; (c) ideal (110) surfaces with two types of terminations: CsPbBr- and Br2-; (d) modified (110) surface with PbBr-termination; (e) modified (110) surface with Cs-termination; (f) ideal (111) surfaces with Pb- and CsBr3-terminations, and a modified (111) surface with one Br atom attached upon ideal Pb-termination (i.e., (111)-Br). (110)-PbBr and (110)-Cs surfaces can be obtained from CsPbBr-termination with Cs and PbBr atoms deleted in the CsPbBr surface layer, respectively. Vertical lines indicate calculation cells. 
According to electrostatic rules, a polar surface can be properly compensated if charge density at the surface is just half that of bulk layers.44 Commonly, surface charge density can be varied through several approaches such as surface charge transfer and surface stoichiometry change. Therefore, besides the polar surfaces with ideal stacking as in the bulk, we also consider the reconstructed surfaces in which changes in chemical compositions may provide possible ways to compensate for polarity. For example, (PbBr)+ and Cs+ layers with half the formal charge (+2) of ideal layers are expected to compensate for the polarity of (110) surfaces (Fig. 1d and e). (110)-PbBr and (110)-Cs surfaces can be viewed as sawtooth-shaped surfaces composed of PbBr2- and CsBr- (100)/(010) micro-facets, respectively. Similar micro-facets (TiO2(100)/(010) micro-facet) have been observed in experimental studies for the SrTiO3 (110) surface.45–47 Similarly, we also consider a polarity-compensated scheme for the (111)-Pb surface with one more Br attached to the surface Pb atom. This Br− in combination with Pb2+ forms the (PbBr)+ surface layer which compensates for the polarity of the (111) surface. The additional Br also increases the coordination number of Pb (from three coordination to four coordination) and thus reduces the dangling bonds of the (111)-Pb surface. These modified terminations and all ideal terminations are calculated in this work.
In order to avoid spurious electrostatic interaction between periodic slabs, we use symmetric slabs with two equivalent terminations to model the surfaces. In this scheme, dipoles at two surfaces of the slab are canceled with each other, as indicated by the planar-averaged local potential of polar surfaces (Fig. S1 of ESI†). It is seen that there is no potential gradient in the vacuum layer. A vacuum layer larger than 15 Å is thick enough to obtain converged total energy for slabs.
Surface energy and cleavage energy are calculated according to the following definitions. For a slab with two equivalent surfaces, surface energy (Eisurf) is calculated as follows:48 (1)where Eislab is the total energy of slab i from DFT calculation, Nj is the number of atoms in the slab, and μj is the chemical potential of j (j = Cs, Pb or Br) and S is the area of the symmetrical surface. Chemical potential describes the variation of free energy of the system when one j atom is interchanged between the surface and a reservoir, i.e., the derivative of free energy with respect to the number of j particles.48 By introducing chemical potentials, we can predict the stability of different surface structures by considering chemical potential conditions and obtain surface phase diagrams. We use relative chemical potential Δμj with respect to the energy of stable element substance (body-centered cubic Cs, face-centered cubic Pb and Br2 molecules in the gas phase), that is Δμj = μj − Ej(2)where Ej (eV per atom) is the total energy of element phase from DFT calculation. Assuming that the surface is in equilibrium with bulk, there should be ΔμCs + ΔμPb+ 3ΔμBr = ΔHbulk(3)where ΔHbulk is the formation energy of bulk CsPbBr3, i.e., ΔHbulk = Ebulk − ECs − EPb − 3EBr (Ebulk is the total energy of CsPbBr3 bulk). Based on eqn (1)–(3), we obtain (4)where (5)This method has been applied to calculate the surface energy of cubic SrTiO3 surfaces.49
Surface energy depends on chemical potentials ΔμCs and ΔμBr, which may be regulated by experimental conditions. Besides, there are some basic restrictions on the variation range of chemical potentials. First, the formation of metal phases (Cs and Pb) and Br2 gas is forbidden at the surfaces. This corresponds to the conditions: ΔμCs < 0; ΔμBr < 0; ΔμPb < 0. Using eqn (3), we can write ΔμPb < 0 as ΔμCs + 3ΔμBr > ΔHbulk. The calculated ΔHbulk is −7.02 eV. These three conditions define a triangle region in which the variation of chemical potentials ΔμCs and ΔμBr is possible (triangles formed by black solid lines as shown in Fig. 2). Second, typical binary phases CsBr and PbBr2 should be precluded. This poses further conditions on ΔμCs and ΔμBr: ΔμCs + ΔμBr < ΔHCsBr = −3.79 eV(6) ΔμPb + 2ΔμBr < ΔHPbBr2 = −3.11 eV(7)where ΔHCsBr and ΔHPbBr2 are the formation energies of CsBr and PbBr2 with respect to element phases. Combining eqn (3) and (7), we obtain: ΔμCs + ΔμBr > −3.91 eV(8)Thus, the sum of ΔμCs and ΔμBr can only be varied in the range (−3.91, −3.79) eV.

The most stable terminations are marked with surface notation inside the region, e.g. (100)-CsBr and (100)-PbBr2 inside the triangle in (a). Blue dot lines indicate the phase boundaries. (110)-Br2 polar surfaces appear only under extremely Br-rich conditions, as indicated by the small triangle area in (b) and (d). A magnification of the small triangle (blue dot lines) in (d) is displayed below the phase diagram. Numbers mark the crossing of boundary lines with an axis. Chemical potential conditions for the equilibrium growth of the CsPbBr3 bulk are depicted between two red dashed lines. The right upper and left lower red dashed lines correspond to CsBr- and PbBr2-rich conditions, respectively. 
Note that the lower and higher boundaries correspond to PbBr2-rich and CsBr-rich conditions (two parallel red dashed lines as shown in Fig. 2). A narrow stable range for cubic CsPbBr3 is similar to other halide perovskites, such as MAPbI3.50
Using total energies of slabs and bulks, we first calculate the surface energy parameter λi according to eqn (5) and then obtain the surface energy as a function of ΔμBr and ΔμCs from eqn (4). Equilibrium boundary (blue dot line inside triangle) between two surfaces is determined by allowing these two surfaces to possess equal surface energy. With all possible surfaces considered, the termination with the lowest surface energy is depicted as a stable surface (marked with this termination). Regions of stable surfaces form surface stability diagrams, as shown in Fig. 2.
Cleavage energy (Ecl) is calculated from the total energies of slabs with two complementary terminations, e.g. (100)-CsBr and (100)-PbBr2, (110)-CsPbBr and (110)-Br2, (110)-Cs and (110)-PbBr, and (111)-CsBr3 and (111)-Pb. Taking (110)-Cs and (110)-PbBr surfaces as an example, we obtain (9)where Nbulk is the total number of the formula unit of bulk CsPbBr3 in two slabs. Total energies of relaxed and unrelaxed slabs are used to calculate Ecl for relaxed and unrelaxed cases. Because (110)-Cs and (110)-PbBr surfaces are complementary with each other, Ecl is independent of chemical potential. In this definition, the cleavage energy is the energy cost in cutting bulk CsPbBr3 into two complementary surfaces.
We have checked the convergence of surface energy with respect to slab thickness (less than 0.01 eV per unit cell surface area or 0.29 meV Å−2). For (100) non-polar surfaces, a nine-layered slab is sufficient for (100)-CsBr and (100)-PbBr2. For (110) surfaces, a nine-layered slab is used for CsPbBr-, Cs- and PbBr-terminations, while a thirteen-layered slab is used for Br2-terminations. For (111) surfaces, nine-, eleven-, thirteen-layered slabs are used for Pb-, Br- and CsBr3, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Energetic properties

Fig. 2 shows the stability phase diagrams of three low-index surfaces of CsPbBr3: (100), (110), (111). We first have an inspection at the (001) surface, as shown in Fig. 2a. As expected, the CsBr-terminated (100) surface is stable under Br- and Cs-rich chemical potential conditions, i.e., high values of ΔμBr and ΔμCs. On the other hand, the PbBr2-terminated (100) surface is more stable under Cs-poor conditions. Interestingly, within the condition that the CsPbBr3 bulk is thermodynamically stable (the area between red dashed lines), the CsBr-terminated surface is always in ground state in comparison with PbBr2-termination. This implies that the CsBr-terminated (100) surface shows larger possibility to appear in synthesized samples.
We then turn to (110) surfaces with possible existence of polar surfaces. As (110)-CsPbBr and (110)-Br2 surfaces are polar, these two surfaces are expected to be unstable. (110)-Cs and (110)-PbBr compensated surfaces should be more stable. Relative stability of these four (110) surfaces is shown as the phase diagram in Fig. 2b. It is seen that (110)-Cs and (110)-PbBr surfaces are stable within most of the region of chemical potentials. In particular, the (110)-Cs surface is in the ground state under Cs-rich conditions, while the (110)-PbBr surface is more stable under Cs-poor conditions. The (110)-Br2 polar surface appears to be in a thermodynamically stable state only under extremely Br-rich conditions, while the (110)-CsPbBr polar surface does not appear to be in a stable state. Notably, the (110)-Cs surface is more stable than other (110) surfaces at most of the areas in which bulk CsPbBr3 is stable. Our results reveal that non-polar surfaces show better stability than polar surfaces and changing surface composition provides an effective approach to improve the stability of perovskites polar surfaces.
Similar to the (110) surface, the ideal (111) surface also shows polar character, with alternating charged (Pb)2+ and (CsBr3)2− layers along the [111] direction. The calculated phase diagram is presented in Fig. 2c. Within the chemical potential range where bulk CsPbBr3 is stable, the non-polar (111)-Br surface is stable in most areas, while (111)-CsBr3 is in its ground state under Br-rich conditions.
Now we might ask the question, what is the relative stability of (100), (110) and (111) surfaces. Fig. 2d presents the relative stability as a phase diagram with all terminations considered. It is seen that (100)-CsBr is the most stable under the condition of stable CsPbBr3. Our results explain the good stability of (100) and (010) facets of triangular-prism shaped CsPbBr3 in experiments.33–35 A recent study revealed that (100) surfaces are more stable than (110) surfaces even with ligand complexes adsorbed on (100) surfaces of CsPbBr3, which provide a more likely model for the surfaces of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals.51
The effect of spin-orbital coupling (SOC) on the phase diagram was also considered and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). We find that the inclusion of SOC only induces a minor shift of phase boundaries and does not change the order of the stability of the surfaces. Another difference is that the (111)-Pb surface appears under very special conditions of Br-poor and Cs-rich for (111) surfaces in the SOC case, which however is beyond the condition of stable CsPbBr3 (between two red dashed lines). Therefore, PBEsol + SOC calculated phase diagrams are consistent with PBEsol results.
We calculate the cleavage energy (i.e., the energy cost in cutting the bulk into surfaces) to get a clearer insight into the stability of these surfaces (Table 1). We can draw the following points from Table 1: (1) cleavage energies of non-polar surfaces are significantly lower than those of polar surfaces. This is consistent with the results of stability diagrams. (2) Cleavage energies decrease after structural relaxations and promote the stability of the surfaces, especially for polar surfaces. For example, the decrease of cleavage energies due to surface structural relaxations is 18.8 and 13.0 meV Å−2 for (110) and (111) polar surfaces, respectively, while it is 8.8 meV Å−2 for (100) non-polar surfaces. (3) (100) non-polar surfaces show much smaller energy costs in cleaving bulk into surfaces. This indicates that (100) surfaces can be made with the lowest energy cost and thus possess the best stability. We note that the unrelaxed cleavage energies agree well with the previous calculations of Jung et al.37
Table 1 Cleavage energies (Ecl, meV Å−2) through (100), (110), and (111) planes of cubic CsPbBr3. For (110) surfaces, polar and non-polar cases correspond to (CsPbBr)–(Br2) and (Cs)–(PbBr) combinations, respectively. Ecl values for relaxed and unrelaxed cases are calculated from the total energies of relaxed and unrelaxed slabs, respectively. (Theoretical lattice constant a0 = 5.862 Å)

We then calculated the surface energies of the most stable surfaces, i.e., (100)-CsBr and (100)-PbBr2 surfaces under specific chemical potential conditions (Table 2). We consider two extremes: CsBr- and PbBr2-rich conditions. These two boundaries provide all the possible conditions for stable CsPbBr3 bulk. CsBr or PbBr2 bulk phases may form outside the two boundaries. Based on the surface energies of relaxed surfaces, the (100)-CsBr surface is predicted to be more stable than the (100)-PbBr2 surface independent of chemical potential. This suggests that CsBr-termination is more likely to appear as a stable surface compared with the PbBr2 case for cubic CsPbBr3 whatever the growth conditions are. This is consistent with the previous experimental findings that two dimensional CsPbBr3 with the thickness of two-unit cells has been identified to have the CsBr-terminated (100) surface.36 Now we might wonder the reason why one is more stable than the other because they appear as counterparts from cleaving bulk CsPbBr3.
Table 2 Calculated surface energies (Esurf, meV Å−2) for (100)-CsBr and (100)-PbBr2 surfaces under CsBr-rich (ΔμCs + ΔμBr = −3.79 eV) and PbBr2-rich conditions ((ΔμCs + ΔμBr = −3.91 eV)), corresponding to right upper and left lower boundaries (red lines) as shown in Fig. 2, respectively. The surface energies at middle point (ΔμCs + ΔμBr = −3.85 eV) between these two extremes are also calculated. According to the definition, the sum of surface energies of two surfaces should be equal to the cleavage energies. This is verified by the sum of surface energies with the value of 12.7 meV (21.5 meV) for a relaxed (unrelaxed) surface, which is exactly the same as relaxed (unrelaxed) cleavage energies (see Table 1)

Commonly, the distinct effect of surface relaxation for these two surfaces is considered as the main reason for the difference in their surface energies. For example, the surface energy calculation method based on bond cleaving and surface relaxation follows this way.37,52,53 In this method, unrelaxed counterpart surfaces, e.g. (100)-CsBr and (100)-PbBr2, possess the same surface energy, i.e., half the cleavage energy of unrelaxed cases. The difference in their surface energies is solely attributed to the distinct effect of surface relaxation for these two surfaces. However, surface energy may show a dependence on chemical bonding character of surface atoms (e.g. the ionicity of the surface layer).54 This calculation method makes it difficult to discriminate the influence of chemical bonding character of surface atoms from that of the surface relaxation effect. Thus, it is required to calculate the surface energy by considering both effects of chemical potentials and relaxation effects.
We first analyzed the relaxation effect on surface energy for these two terminations. We found that the relaxation effect is different for two surfaces and the relaxation effect of CsBr-termination is larger that of PbBr-termination. This is evidenced by the decrease in surface energy after surface relaxation, which is 5.6 meV Å−2 for CsBr-termination, and is larger than 3.2 meV Å−2 for PbBr2-termination (Table 2). This point agrees with the previous study.37
Interestingly, except for surface relaxation, we find that the ionicity of the surface atomic layer makes a difference to surface energies. We calculate the surface energy for unrelaxed surfaces, i.e., ideal surfaces cut from bulk (Table 2). It is seen that the surface energy of CsBr-termination is lower than that of PbBr2-termination for most chemical potential conditions, except for under PbBr2-rich conditions where their surface energies are close. Notably, under moderate conditions (ΔμCs + ΔμBr = −3.85 eV), the difference in surface energy between two terminations is 1.8 meV Å−2. This is non-negligible in comparison with the difference induced by the surface relaxation effect for two terminations. The lower surface energy of CsBr-termination could be understood in that the higher ionicity of the CsBr surface layer leads to less surface dangling bonds than the PbBr2 surface layer. In common semiconductors, increase in ionicity usually leads to lower surface energy.55 To summarize, better stability of the (100)-CsBr surface can be attributed to the larger effect of surface relaxation and higher ionicity of the surface layer in comparison with the (100)-PbBr2 one. This together with a similar phenomenon on orthorhombic CsPbBr3 and MAPbI354 demonstrates that the AX-terminated surface of halide perovskites (APbX3) is in the ground state for (100) surfaces.
3.2. Electronic structures
To obtain a deep insight into the origin of stability of polar and nonpolar surfaces, we calculate the electronic structures of CsPbBr3 surfaces (Fig. 3). It is seen that both CsBr- and PbBr2-terminated (100) surfaces preserve the semiconducting character of CsPbBr3 bulk, but with a larger band gap (1.58 eV for the CsBr-surface and 1.78 eV for the PbBr2-surface) compared with the bulk value (1.40 eV) (Fig. 3a). This can be understood in the quantum confinement effect due to the quasi-two-dimensional character of slab structures. Note that there are no in-gap states for both surfaces. The absence of in-gap states implies that surface dangling bonds do not lead to severe mid-gap trap states, consistent with the bright emission and high photoluminescence quantum yields of CsPbBr3 NCs found in experiments.6,22,23
 Fig. 3  Density of states (DOS, states/eV) of cubic CsPbBr3 low-index surfaces: (a) (100), (b) (110), (c) (111) surfaces. DOS of each termination for all cases are marked in the inset. Fermi levels are indicated by the vertical dashed lines for polar surfaces. For other surfaces, valence band maximum is set as zero. The DOS value of the bulk is presented as 4.5 times larger for a better comparison with the nine-layered slab. 
For (110) polar surfaces, charges are transferred to surfaces to compensate for the polarity of surfaces. The polar surface can be compensated for if charge density at the surface is half that of bulk layers. Negative charges (or electrons) are needed for the compensation of the (110)-CsPbBr surface, while positive charges (or holes) are needed for the compensation of the (110)-Br2 surface. As shown in Fig. 3b, the bottom of the conduction band is occupied by electrons for (110)-CsPbBr surfaces, while the top of the valence band is unoccupied for the (110)-Br2 surface, i.e., holes fill in valence bands. Notably, compensated surfaces via composition change, (110)-Cs and (110)-PbBr surfaces, are insulating. These insulating surfaces are in the absence of charge occupation at the Fermi level and thus more stable than those polar surfaces.
We calculated the electrons in conduction bands by summing all occupied states of conduction bands for the (110)-CsPbBr slab. Calculated transferred electrons are 1.0 e per unit cell surface (e: element charge unit) which are the negative charges needed for a full compensation. Furthermore, we calculated the distribution of the charges along the surface normal via planar-averaged density. Fig. 4a presents the density of the charges for the (110)-CsPbBr slab. The density shows the largest peak in the outermost CsPbBr layers and permeates into inner CsPbBr layers. This indicates that the charge from the self-consistent calculation exhibits a complex distribution beyond the simple charge-compensated model from formal ionic charge.

(110)-CsPbBr and (111)-Pb surfaces are electron-doped, while (110)-Br2 and (111)-CsBr3 surfaces are hole-doped. Electron density is the sum of all the occupied states in the conduction bands, while hole density is the sum of all the unoccupied states in the valence bands. Planar-averaged density is calculated along the surface normal. Density peaks are labeled with the corresponding atomic layers shown vertically or with labeled with an arrow. Half of the slab layers are labeled as the slabs are symmetric about the middle. 
Calculated hole charges are 1.0 e per unit cell surface for the (110)-Br2 slab, and thus fulfil the compensation rule. The density of holes is presented in Fig. 4b. The largest density occurs in the outermost layers and decays into inner-layers. As expected, doped holes are mainly concentrated in Br2 layers. Besides, holes can reside in the CsPbBr layer as Br and Pb atoms in this layer make a contribution to the top of valence bands.
As expected, electronic structures of polar (111) surfaces are not insulating due to their polarity. To compensate for the polarity of (111)-CsBr3 surfaces, positive charges of 1 e have to be transferred to the surface. This leads to the occupation of the top of the valence band with holes (Fig. 3c). Calculated holes are 1.0 e per unit cell surface, just as the negatively charged (CsBr3)2− surface required. On the other hand, for the (111)-Pb surface with a positive charge Pb2+ layer, electrons are required at the surface to avoid polarity. In this case, electrons fill in the bottom of conduction bands and the electron number is calculated to be 1.0 per unit cell surface, making the surface compensated. Fig. 4c and 4d display the electron and hole densities in (111)-Pb and (111)-CsBr3 slabs, respectively. Similar to (110) surfaces, charge density peaks occur in the outermost layers. We note that holes mainly concentrate in CsBr3 layers and also reside in Pb layers. This indicates an interesting feature of the top of valence bands, i.e., the top of the valence band is in anti-bonding state which consists of Br 4p and Pb 6s orbitals.
Similar to the (110) polar surface, changing chemical composition provides another approach to compensate for the polarity of the polar (111) surface. We take the (111)-Pb polar surface as an example. With one Br adsorbed on the Pb layer, one would expect that a polar surface can be avoided as Br− ions carry one negative charge, which thus acts as an electron at the surface. Insulating character of DOS of the (111)-Br surface is consistent with this picture. Moreover, the insulating character of the (111)-Br surface suggests its better stability over the (111)-CsBr3 and (111)-Pb surfaces, consistent with the picture obtained from the thermodynamic phase diagram.
The effect of SOC on the electronic structures of surfaces is given in Fig. S3 (ESI†). PBEsol + SOC predicts the same insulating (or metallic) character and transferred charges as PBEsol except for a down-shifted conduction band minimum (CBM). The shift originates from the splitting of CBM when SOC is included. We also check the effect of the hybrid functional (HSE06) on the electronic structures of typical surfaces, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). We find that CBM calculated by HSE06 is shifted up for non-polar surfaces, while the top of valence bands is shifted down for polar surfaces compared with PBEsol results. This is due to a larger band gap predicted by HSE06. Besides, HSE06 predicts a larger width of the valence band than PBEsol, which results in a down-shift of the bottom of valence bands.
4. Conclusions
We investigated the energetic and electronic properties of cubic CsPbBr3 surfaces using the first-principles method based on DFT. We found that nonpolar (100) surfaces are more stable than the polar (110) and (111) surfaces. The nonpolar (100)-CsBr surface possesses the lowest surface energy and thus shows the best stability. The stability of the (100)-CsBr surface can be attributed to the larger effect of surface relaxation and higher ionicity of the surface layer in comparison with the (100)-PbBr2 surface. Electronic structure analysis reveals that all non-polar surfaces show semiconducting properties, while polar surfaces have metallic character due to the charge transfer to compensate for the polarity. Semiconducting surfaces occur in the absence of charge occupation at the Fermi level and thus more stable than those polar surfaces. Polar surfaces can also be compensated for by properly varying the chemical compositions of surfaces, which can be more effective to compensate for the polar surface than the charge transfer scheme. Our results present a clear picture about the surface stability of cubic CsPbBr3. Based on theoretical analyses at the atomic and electronic level, we provide an explanation to experimental findings that (100) surfaces of CsPbBr3 show good stability. The conclusions made here should be helpful in understanding the surface properties of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals and nanosheets and further promoting the advancement of CsPbBr3-based materials and devices. Based on the understanding of surface properties of cubic CsPbBr3, as a prototype of all-inorganic halide perovskites, our study provides some general points of surface stability for all-inorganic halide perovskites.
