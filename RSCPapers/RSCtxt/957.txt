    , Accepted 25th July 2020First published on 27th July 2020AbstractOver the last few decades, significant progress has been made with inorganic materials to enable them as next generation photovoltaic materials that can fulfil the demands of green energy. Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 stands out as a p-type absorber material due to exemption from scarce and strategic elements and its similarities with Cu2InGa(S,Se)4. Organic materials such as fullerenes and its derivatives are effective n-type semiconductors. We report the usage of n-type fullerene materials with kesterite-based absorbers in a thin film polycrystalline solar cell for the partial substitution of the CdS buffer layer with C60 or C70 fullerenes. Impedance measurements reveal that using C60 as an interlayer increases the built-in potential, suggesting reduction in the interfacial recombination. This promotes charge conduction, resulting in an increased open circuit voltage and thus device performance.
Introduction
Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) with a kesterite structure are promising absorber materials for large-scale solar integration, due to their unique composition which encompasses abundant non-toxic elements. The high absorption coefficient of kesterite facilitates its application in thin films and flexible devices; moreover, its tuneable band-gap ranging between 1 and 1.5 eV is suitable for single junction solar cells. Furthermore, it exhibits robust stability under outdoor conditions.1 The potential of being solution processable makes it attractive for small-scale manufacturing and with low capital cost.2 However, advances in kesterite have been impeded and have been subject to less exploitation during the last years owing to its complexity and relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) as compared to the other emerging thin film photovoltaic technologies.3 One of the reasons for the lower performance lies in the formation of a junction with the buffer layer.4 Unfavourable band alignment, dipole formation and lattice mismatch create recombination paths that lower the open-circuit voltage. Furthermore, the buffer layer absorbs part of the solar spectrum, which reduces the short-circuit current. CdS is the most studied n-type buffer layer for thin film solar cells fabrication, borrowed from established technologies such as CdTe and Cu2InGaSe4 (CIGS), where it shows a competitive PCE, owing to its high transparency, electrical properties and ease of processing through chemical bath deposition (CBD).4–6 Attempts to modify or substitute this buffer layer have been limited to Zn(S,O),7–9 In2S3,10 (Zn,Sn)O,11 (Cd,Zn)S12 or alloys with CdS.12,13 However, a little improvement in terms of reproducibility has been observed. In most of the cases, a second n-type material is required to improve the charge conduction and to minimize short circuits, typically ZnO as a window layer.
On the other hand, organic semiconductors have delivered significant results, due to the tuneable electro-optical properties that can be achieved by engineering the molecules. Fullerenes have been used since 1985,14 and their photovoltaic properties have been studied.15,16 Currently, fullerenes and their derivatives are widely used in organic and perovskite based solar cells, as electron transport materials to achieve high performance.17–19 They are environmentally friendly and stable, as they are composed of carbon atoms joined by covalent bonds. They can be further functionalized to increase their solubility, as in the case of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).
However, reports on fullerenes in kesterite solar cells are in scarce and limited efforts have been made to combine CZTSSe with organic materials. CZTSSe nanocrystals have been used for photodetectors or for improvements in organic solar cells.20–22 Among the reports, Saha et al. made an attempt to create a planar superstrate device with CZTS nanoparticles and PCBM, with the limitation of having a non-ohmic contact between ITO electrode and CZTS,22 measuring 0.9% PCE. Jang et al. introduced CZTS nanoparticles into a bulk heterojunction (P3HT:PCBM) to improve the absorption of an organic solar cell, thus increasing the generated photocurrent and yielding a PCE of 3.32%.21 Nevertheless, these attempts exhibited poor photovoltaic performances.
In this work, we designed an architect for both type of kesterite (CZTS and CZTSe) based absorbers, by the introduction of n-type C60 and C70 fullerenes as interlayers and reducing the CdS thickness. The reduction of the CdS thickness was found to be advantageous by many groups, due to the higher transparency in the short wavelength region and low series resistance, additionally, owing to the reduced loadings of the highly contaminant and toxic Cd. On the contrary, the reduced CdS thickness resulted into a lower voltage and a high risk of pinholes,23,24 an effect that is more remarkable in CZTS than in CZTSe.25
We settled for the best possible configuration of a bilayer buffer by changing the deposition order, and put forward promising results for both the absorbers with C60. The measured open circuit voltages are notably high with both types of absorbers and resulted in a PCE of 8.37% and 4.58% with CZTSe and CZTS, respectively, even with the reduced thickness of CdS. Additionally, an array of electrical measurements (impedance and C–V) were made for the CZTS samples to observe the underlying phenomena. An increase in the built-in potential (Vbi) and reduction in the interface recombination were noted, allowing a significant improvement in the charge transport.
Experimental method
Device
For the fabrication of CZTSe and CZTS solar cells, cleaned soda–lime glass (SLG) were used as the substrate providing the sodium (Na) source. An 800 nm thick film of molybdenum (Mo) was sputtered on the SLG as the back contact, followed by the deposition of metallic precursors Sn, Cu and Zn. For the selenium containing absorbers, a thin film of 20 nm of Ge was also deposited by thermal evaporation, as a doping agent to improve the bulk quality.26,27 This was then placed into a closed graphite box, and then introduced inside a quartz tube furnace to perform sulfurization or selenization. The annealing treatment was performed in two steps, in the first step, a low temperature was used to create the sulphide or selenide binary compounds, and in the second step high temperature treatment was used to form the quaternary compound to promote grain growth.
Etching treatment was performed by dipping the samples in 22% diluted (NH4)2S in H2O, in order to remove the binary Sn(S,Se)x compounds formed at the interface. Extra air annealing treatment at 300 °C was applied to the CZTS absorber to oxidize some of the remaining binary compounds.
The following buffer layers were deposited on top of the absorber. CdS was grown by chemical bath deposition (CBD). Cd(NO3)2 was used as the Cd precursor for CdS in the CBD, which allows better growth control of the thickness as the formation is slower.28 For standard deposition, a 60 nm film grown in 40 minutes was required to achieve the best performance;23,29 however, notably in this work, the process was reduced to 20 minutes in order to minimize the thickness, producing a thinner film of ∼30 nm of CdS. The fullerene C60 and C70 thin films were prepared following the procedure reported elsewhere.18 The fullerenes were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 and were stirred overnight. The solution was filtered with a PTFE filter of 0.42 μm pore size, and deposited by spin coating 50 μL at 1500 rpm for 60 seconds. After spin coating, it was transferred to a hotplate to dry at 80 °C for 2 minutes. The devices were finished by sputtering 50 nm of ZnO as a window layer and 300 nm of ITO as a transparent conductive film at 200 °C. Furthermore, neither the top metallic contact nor the anti-reflection coating was used in this work. The cells were then mechanically scribed in squares of 3 × 3 mm2.
Characterization
Absorption and transmittance spectra were recorded using an Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrometer. For device characterization, current–voltage curves were measured using a class AAA Oriel solar simulator from Newport and a Keithley multi-meter, by connecting the positive contact to the bare molybdenum and the negative contact directly to the ITO. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured within the 300 to 1100 nm range on a PVE300 photovoltaic EQE system, powered by a 150 W xenon lamp and a 1/4m monochromator. For impedance measurements, a constant bias signal with 20 mV of perturbation was applied, in a frequency range from 5 GHz to 300 Hz. The measurements were done inside a Faraday chamber, to avoid signal interferences, using a Biologic impedance analyser and EC-LAB software was used for fitting of the data to extract the parameters of the equivalent circuit.
Results and discussion
Optical characterization
A prerequisite for the buffer layer is high transmittance in a wide range of visible and near infrared wavelengths, in order to allow maximum light absorption by the active material. The optical properties were acquired on the films deposited on glass (Fig. 1). The transmittance spectra of the CdS thin films with a thickness of 30–40 nm exhibit higher transparency within the 450 to 1000 nm wavelength, while for a thickness of 60–70 nm, a further reduction of 15–20% of transmittance in the same wavelength region for CdS was seen, and was further decreased for the annealed film of CdS in the wavelengths smaller than 450 nm (Fig. 1a).
 Fig. 1  (a) Transmittance spectra of thin films deposited on glass of C60 and C70 (spin coating) and CdS (CBD) and (b) transmittance spectra of the bilayer buffer before and after heat treatment at 230 °C for 20 min. 
To unravel the effect of annealing on the band gap of the buffer layer, the film was annealed at 230 °C for 20 min in air and the transmittance was measured before and after to note the optical band gap using the Tauc plot method (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Besides the reduction in the transmittance in the 480–580 nm range, the annealed film of CdS also exhibits a red shift in the band-gap from 2.35 eV to 2.23 eV (Fig. S1a, ESI†). This change is associated with a transition from the hexagonal to cubic structure and in the case of C60, a minute loss in transmittance occurs at 500 nm, while in the case of C70, it shows a slight loss in transparency from 450 to 700 nm. Thus, the high optical transparency of these organic materials suggests its usage as the buffer layer with a low band-gap absorber material such as kesterite.
However, parasitic absorption of these materials can slightly reduce the photocurrent which will be higher in the case of C70. The calculated optical band-gap values of these fullerenes through a linear fit of the Tauc plot (Fig. S1b, ESI†) are in agreement with the reported value in the literature.

Fig. 1b shows the changes in the transmittance of the C60 and C70 films after the deposition of the CdS thin film, and after annealing in air at 230 °C for 20 min. In both cases, the trend is similar; however, a reduction of 5–10% of the transmittance can be deducted after the organic material is covered with CdS, and an unnoticeable reduction in the transmittance after the heat treatment is noted. The bandgap remains unchanged suggesting that the amorphous nature of the fullerenes is conserved.

Fig. 2 illustrates the energy level diagram of the studied device with the materials used. In spite of different band-gaps of the materials, the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is close to the conduction band of the CZTS(e) in all cases, which facilitates the flow of electrons, while the low energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) can block the holes effectively, making it an ideal candidate as a buffer layer.

Device characterization
Firstly, we used CZTSe as an absorber layer. Three different configurations were prepared (Fig. 3), where the thickness of CdS was reduced and partially substituted by the fullerene in the double buffer layer. The first one is denoted as CdS/C60. In the second configuration, CdS/C70 was probed as the buffer layer. In the third one, C60/CdS was used as the interfacial agent, to test the possibility of minimizing the interface recombination by fullerenes being deposited directly over the CZTSe absorber (shown in the right side of the figure).
 Fig. 3  Architecture of the different configurations of kesterites used for solar cell fabrication. 
The influence of the thickness and the annealing temperature of CdS on the solar cell performance has been studied. In the case of the selenium containing absorber, a thin CdS film of 30–50 nm is deposited and post heat treatment (PHT) above 200 °C is applied. This treatment induces Cd2+ diffusion to the absorber, and exchanges between S and Se, reducing the interface recombination and thus improving the voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). This process was reported for CIGS,30 and is also applied for CZTSe to deliver similar results.31,32
However, organic materials are susceptible to annealing and can decomposed or oxidized at a higher temperature. In fullerenes the covalent bonds of the carbon are stable.33 Furthermore, we have not observed any thermal evaporation of organic materials at temperatures lower than 350 °C, in agreement with the transmittance measurements. However, it is vital to evaluate the role of organic layers under the required treatment and the possible effects this may have on the fabricated solar cell, such as changes in the crystal structure or oxidation.
To evaluate this, the final devices were characterized before and after annealing at 230 °C for 20 minutes in air on a hotplate. The average parameters extracted from the J–V characterization of eight different cells are shown in Table 1. A similar trend was noted for all the devices with C60. The Voc and the FF showed an increased value after the heat treatment, and gave an average PCE >7.5%. In the case of C70, an improvement in Voc and Jsc can be noticed after annealing, but the reduction in FF resulted in a decrease in the final PCE.

Table S1 (ESI†) illustrates a detailed study of post heat treatment and suggests the optimized results, with treatment at 225 °C. The open circuit voltage can be further increased at higher temperatures, but reduction of the current and FF will reduce the PCE. We can speculate that the use of an organic layer is compatible with the required post heating treatment and will not hinder the element diffusion between CdS and CZTSe.
The devices using C60 between CZTSe and CdS registered 20 mV higher Voc and a competitive FF of 64% on average, which can indicate the surface passivation effect, but with minute loss in the photocurrent. The J–V curves (Fig. 4a) of the best devices with post annealing yielded a value of 446 mV of Voc, without compromising other parameters, and a PCE of 8.37% was noted for the champion solar cells. CdS/C60 also showed a similar value and a PCE of 8.35% was obtained, due to a slightly higher photocurrent, but a reduced voltage. The samples with complete substitution of CdS by C60 and PCBM (Fig. S3a, ESI†) were not able to deliver competitive performance as compared to standard cell using only CdS or a bilayer buffer. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices (Fig. 4b) reveal that the loss of current is higher in the infrared region, which we assigned to the absorber layer itself rather than the buffer or the interfacial layers.
 Fig. 4  (a) J–V curves under 1 sun illumination for the CZTSe absorber and (b) the EQE spectra of the best devices after annealing. 
Complementary to this, a higher response in the violet and ultraviolet regions can be noticed (Fig. S3b, ESI†), which can be attributed to a lower parasitic absorption of the double buffer layer in this region in comparison with that in the pure CdS buffer layer. On the other hand, a loss of response can be noticed in the infrared region for the double buffer layer, which is also responsible for the current loss from the ideal value, while the decrease in the infrared region is characteristic for the CZTSe absorbers, and can be attributed to the bulk defects that cause fast recombination of the electron–hole pairs produced from the p–n junction. We observed a slightly lower photocurrent for the double buffers as compared to only the CdS, which can be attributed to the loss of transparency. For the devices using C70, a decrease in the FF led to a lower PCE than that of C60. The Voc remains similar, but there is a decrease in the current value, as was expected from the transmittance data, and also supported by the EQE measurement, where the signal is reduced for wavelengths shorter than the calculated bandgap (1.79 eV or 700 nm). This behaviour is similar to the results of using C70 as a buffer layer in other types of solar cells.34 The competitive FF of both CdS/C60 and C60/CdS suggests rational energy level alignment between the conduction band of CdS and the LUMO level of C60.
The flow of current shows low resistance independent of the layer order, but this is not the case for C70 where the low FF indicates a high resistance for CdS/C70. Furthermore, these fullerenes were also tested with the CZTS absorber, using a similar three configurations as shown in Fig. 2. In this case, the surface passivation of the absorber is of significant interest, as the interface between CZTS and CdS presents several issues due to the valence band offset and secondary phases which induce interface recombination. Usually, etching treatment35,36 or an oxide interlayer37,38 is required for the passivation of interface defects.

Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves of the best device for each condition under AM1.5 illumination conditions, and the average values are shown in Table 2. In the case where C60 was used as an interlayer between the CZTS absorber and CdS, the devices registered a significant increase in PCE from 1% to 4.5%, with a remarkable Voc of 718 mV in the best cell. Considering that the record value of 730 mV for the pure CZTS absorber was achieved by high temperature thermal annealing and a protective Al2O3 film in the back contact.39 In this case, no special treatment was applied to molybdenum, so an excess of MoS2 formation during sulfurization could increase the resistance and could be responsible for the low FF in these devices.

The EQE spectra (Fig. 6a) were recorded to investigate the deficiency of the current. No relevant changes in the band-gap of the absorber were noticed, having a value of 1.47 eV for all cases. The spectra of the CdS/C70 lost part of the signal in the 380–700 nm region, which can be associated to the absorption of C70 in this region. However, the differences between the samples are lesser than expected from the J–V curves and the integrated photocurrent from the EQE is calculated (Fig. 6b).
 Fig. 6  (a) EQE spectra of the CZTS samples. The band-gap is calculated in the graph by a linear fitting of the last part of the graph and (b) the corresponding integrated photocurrent density extracted from the EQE measurements. The inset table shows the difference between the integrated photocurrent and the Jsc measured at 1 sun illumination (marked with an arrow on the right). 
The integrated current density value should match the Jsc value measured on the J–V curve but a difference of 6.24 and 7.27 mA cm−2 was noted for the CdS/C60 and CdS/C70 samples, respectively. This result reveals that there is a loss of photocurrent when they are illuminated under AM1.5 conditions, an effect that is less noticeable in the C60/CdS sample.
This suggests a change in the carrier concentration under illumination, and a possible high density of defects or secondary phases in the CZTS/CdS interface that can aggravate the accumulation and recombination of the charge at the interface. It seems contradictory to attribute the reduction of the FF to the bilayer buffer, because in the case of C60, it works efficiently in the structure of CZTSe/CdS/C60. Therefore, we attribute this increase of resistance to the un-optimized CZTS/CdS interface, and when C60 is placed between CZTS and CdS, the electrons are transported efficiently through the buffer layer and the interface recombination is avoided.
Impedance spectroscopy
Impedance measurements were performed on the devices with a configuration of CZTS/CdS/C60 and CZTS/C60/CdS to elucidate the role of the junction formed. The capacitance measurement at different frequencies can display the behaviour of physical mechanisms occurring at different time scales.
The change of the applied voltage will modify the carrier density and the space charge region. 3D mapping of the capacitance from a simple RC circuit is represented in Fig. 7a. The capacitance contribution mainly originates from the pseudo-capacitor formed by the p–n junction between the absorber and the buffer layer, (Fig. 7b). Three main features can be distinguished, marked as 1, 2 and 3 in Fig. 7a:
 Fig. 7  (a) Capacitance mapping from a RC circuit vs. frequency and voltage, measured in the dark, with the three mentioned regions marked and (b) the scheme of the charges in the p–n junction. 
(i) At lower frequencies (102–104 Hz), the capacitance rapidly increases with the increment of voltage. Although the capacitance is inversely proportional to the width of the depletion region according to eqn (1) of the capacitor, the width of the depletion region at this point is minimum. For an applied voltage higher than the built-in potential, the p–n junction allows passing of the current and the capacitance is dominated by the minority carrier diffusion, which is proportional to the current, as shown in eqn (2). This region is associated with the chemical capacitance. (1)C is the capacitance, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative permittivity, A is the area of the cell and W is the depletion width. (2)Cd is the diffusion capacitance, I is the current, τT is the transit time, V is the applied bias and R is the equivalent resistance.
(ii) When the applied bias is smaller than the built-in potential, the width of the depletion region is narrowed within the voltage, following eqn (3). Typically, the buffer layer required a high-density carrier concentration ND ≫ NA, so most of the depletion width falls in the absorber and the equation can be simplified as eqn (4). At negative bias, the polarization is inverted and the current is blocked, thus the diffusion capacitance is negligible and the charge drift dominates the capacitance, called the depletion region capacitance. (3) (4)Wp and Wn are the widths of the depletion region in the p and n materials, respectively, εs is the relative permittivity, ND is the donor concentration of the n material, NA is the acceptor concentration of the p material, and Vb is the built-in potential.
(iii) At a high frequency, the transit time τT is much larger than the signal and the charges do not have sufficient time to transfer across the device, provoking a decrease in the capacitance. In this region, the single effect remaining is the series resistance.
A solar cell is a complex circuit, where many simultaneous processes occur, and thus a simple RC circuit will not be able to provide reliable information. To further expand this, we made fitting in an equivalent circuit to the Nyquist plot. The Nyquist plot versus the voltage map (Fig. 8a) represents semicircles for which the size changes with the voltage. These semicircles fit with the equivalent circuit composed of a series resistance followed by a certain number of loops with the capacitor and the resistance,40,41 (Fig. 8b). Each loop represents a physical process occurring inside the device. This part is very tricky, as some of the semicircles can overlap, making the analysis complex.
 Fig. 8  (a) Map of the Nyquist plot vs. bias voltage with different perspectives measured in the dark, (b) the equivalent circuit used for fitting the solar cells and (c) the equation that describes the equivalent circuit for n loops and the representation scheme for n = 3. 
The first semicircle is usually associated with the junction p+/p in the back contact with MoS(e)2, while the main semicircle is associated with the p–n junction.
Other processes as trap states or grain boundaries generally overlap with the main semicircle, producing a modification in the shape. These semicircles are represented as shown in the scheme Fig. 8c. By minimizing the error between the equivalent circuit and the measurement, different values of the capacitance and resistance can be extracted for different processes, independently from the frequency. The value of C3 is represented in Fig. 9a for the CZTS absorber with the (CZTS/C60/CdS and CZTS/CdS/C6)0 configuration. Two different regions can be differentiated, and as in the RC circuit shown in Fig. 7a, at a negative voltage the capacitance is dominated by the depletion layer, while at a sufficiently forward voltage, the capacitance is dominated by the chemical capacitance. From the value of the capacitance C3, which represents the p–n junction at a reverse voltage, the Mott–Schottky plot can be determined by plotting (area/C3)2vs. applied voltage, (Fig. 9b). Typically, the built-in voltage can be calculated by intercepting the x axis to a linear fit at the reverse voltage because this is the region where the capacitance is dominated by the pseudocapacitor of the depletion layer.42 However, here it does not follow a linear trend, and fits well with a second order polynomial. This is a characteristic behaviour of non-crystalline and polycrystalline materials, which indicates the presence of non-ideal processes such as deep levels. Therefore, the built-in potential is calculated by the extrapolation of the polynomial fit to the cross with the x axis, and a term of kT/q is substracted.

From Table 3, we can deduct a significant increase in the built-in voltage of 155 mV for the sample CZTS/C60/CdS, pointing towards the increase of Voc in these solar cells. This increase of Vbi can be associated with a higher voltage in the depletion region, which will contribute to the final Voc.

By elucidating the Vbi value, a representation of the carrier concentration in the absorber can be calculated by using eqn (5), with the same criteria ND ≫ NA (eqn (6)). NA is usually reported in the order of 1016 cm−3 for CZTS, while ND for both CdS and C60 has been reported in the order of 1018 cm−3. The carrier concentration versus the depletion width is represented in Fig. 10a, where the width is calculated by using eqn (1). It can be noted that the depletion width is broader and the carrier density is lower for the CZTS/CdS/C60 based device.
 Fig. 10  (a) Profiling of the calculated donor concentration and (b) the minority carrier lifetime at different applied bias. 
The C60 used as a buffer layer increases the apparent carrier concentration of CZTS close to the interface, which may indicate a passivation of the CZTS surface by preventing the surface recombination. On the other hand, the reduction in the depletion width is about 55 nm. However, this reduction is not desirable, as it may not be affected if the diffusion length of the photo-generated charge is at least in the order of the thickness of the absorber, thus all the charges can reach the space charge region.
An analogous situation has been reported for the use of an In2S3 interlayer between CZTS and CdS, where a similar effect of the increased carrier concentration and reduction of the interlayer was found, which resulted in an improved open-circuit voltage.43 (5) (6)
The transit time (τT) was calculated by multiplying C3 and R3 of the equivalent circuit, and it is represented vs. the voltage (Fig. 10b), and the characteristic values of both the cells are shown in Table 3. This measure can be associated with the minority carrier lifetime when it is measured in the area where the capacitance is dominated by the chemical capacitance. Apparently, reduction in the minority lifetime affects the C60/CdS mainly due to the reduction in R3, associated with the recombination resistance. However, the calculated values in both cases are much higher than the reported ones by other methods, and are in the order of few nanoseconds.44 This discrepancy suggests that the carrier lifetime can change under illumination conditions due to the changes in the carrier concentrations.
To check this effect for the CZTS/C60/CdS device, impedance spectra were also recorded under illumination near to Voc (700 mV) and an equivalent bias voltage of 700 mV in the dark (Fig. 11). It can be noted that the shape of the semicircle decreases under illumination, due to a decrease in the recombination resistance, and a decrease of the capacitance. At this point, the carrier diffusion dominates, but the carrier lifetime decreases substantially to a value in the order of 1 μs. This value is still much higher than the reported ones of ∼20 ns, highlighting that the carrier lifetime measured close to the junction is not a limiting factor, but there are other processes that lower this value within the bulk. In addition, a reduction in the series resistance (R1) can be noticed under illumination from 185 to 45 Ω, which reaffirms that the C60/CdS bilayer buffer is highly photoactive. This effect indicates that the power extracted from a solar cell can be further increased with the illumination time. Measurements following the maximum power point under 1 sun illumination (Fig. S4, ESI†) show that during the first 30–40 s the observed power increase is mainly due to an increase in the extracted current, increasing the PCE from 4.4% to 4.6%.

Conclusions
The partial substitution of CdS by organic charge transport materials is shown to be an effective method to reduce the loading of Cd based materials, without having an adverse effect on the perfomance of the solar cells. We noted that reducing the thickness of CdS also induces an increase in the photocurrent in the violet and UV region of the spectra, where the absorption of CdS is parasitic. The fullerene derivative used as an electron transport layer was noted to be stable at the required post treatment temperature of 230 °C for fabrication of CZTSe solar cells. Among the fullerene derivatives, C60 showed better electro-optical properties than C70 as a buffer layer in kesterite solar cells. The use of C60 as an interlayer between the absorber and the CdS allowed us to register remarkably high values of Voc, of 446 mV for CZTSe, and 718 mV for CZTS, even with a significant reduction in CdS thickness. For pure sulfide CZTS kesterite, the use of a double buffer of C60 and CdS was noted to increase the carrier concentration close to the junction, and an increase in the built-in potential was responsible for the high Voc. Optimization of the process and the thickness of these films will be vital for further reducing the voltage deficit. One of the main barriers in inorganic solar cells is the limited choice of materials that can be used efficiently as buffer layers, and is being typically dependent on cadmium or indium elements and here rational organic charge transport materials can be used. Our investigation paves the way for further optimization and exploration of using organic materials for kesterite type solar cells to develop cost-effective and green photovoltaics.
