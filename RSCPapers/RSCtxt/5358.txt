    , Accepted 18th April 2022First published on 22nd April 2022AbstractRecently, low-band gap non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have achieved rapid development and proven to be an effective means to improve the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) because of their adjustable energy levels and strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption. In order to enhance light capture in the NIR region, strong electron donating and electron withdrawing units were introduced to enhance intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). However, the commonly used end-group engineering often fails to achieve a simultaneous enhancement of short-circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). In contrast, the strategy of core engineering can enhance both Jsc and Voc. Moreover, among five-membered aromatic heterocycles, pyrrole has the highest electron density, and thus multi-pyrrole could be a strong electron donating unit. Therefore, we designed and synthesized a novel pyrrole-based NFA (DPBT-2Cl) for comparison with a thiophene-based NFA (TPBT-2Cl). Red shifts of 55 nm (in solution) and 75 nm (in film) of the absorption peaks were achieved through core engineering by substituting pyrrole for thiophene. The morphology of the active layer also plays a crucial role in the performance. By modifying the N atom of pyrrole with alkyl chain as the side-chain engineering, the phase separation of PM6/DPBT-2Cl in the active layer is more ideal than that of PM6/TPBT-2Cl. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases from 1.0% for TPBT-2Cl to 11.5% for DPBT-2Cl, which is one of the high performances we know of for reported OSCs based on the penta-fused-ring (PFR), with Jsc increasing from 3.56 mA cm−2 to 23.1 mA cm−2 and Voc from 0.74 V to 0.78 V. We demonstrate that core engineering by replacing thiophene with pyrrole enables low-band gap NFAs and side chain engineering enables a more ideal phase separation in the active layer, which is an excellent strategy to realize a simultaneous enhancement in both Voc and Jsc and maximize the performance of OPVs.
Introduction
In the recent years, low-bandgap NFAs have achieved rapid development and proven to be an effective means to improve the performance of OPVs because of their adjustable energy levels and strong NIR absorption.1–8 Furthermore, the NIR region (700–3000 nm) energy occupies more than half of the total energy of sunlight.9 In order to enhance light capture in the NIR region, strong electron donating (D) and electron withdrawing (A) units were introduced to enhance ICT and reduce the optical band gap. However, the commonly used end-group engineering often fails to achieve a simultaneous enhancement of Jsc and Voc. In contrast, the strategy of core engineering can enhance both Jsc and Voc.10–18 In the NFA molecular designs, the thiophene ring was the most commonly used donor unit in the core, regardless of whether they adopted the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) or acceptor–donor–acceptor′–donor–acceptor (A–D–A′–D–A) structure, as shown in the cases of ITIC, IT-4F, IEICO, and BTPTT-4F (Y6).19–30 Among five-membered aromatic heterocycle rings, pyrrole has a higher ionization energy than furan or thiophene, which could be used as a strong D, and the pyrrole unit in the molecule can form stronger ICT with the A unit than the other two. In addition, since the C atom and the heteroatom N belong to the second period element and the heteroatom S lies in the third period, the overlapping of hybrid orbitals formed by S and C atoms is not as high as that by N and C atoms. Therefore, the pyrrole ring has a better hybrid orbital overlap and is more likely to adopt a robust π–π stacking. This molecular packing property is beneficial to improve the mobility of charge carriers.14 Furthermore, with the increase of the core size of the fused ring skeleton, the absorption spectrum is red-shifted, the band gap becomes smaller, and the acceptor charge carrier mobility increases.31,32 Certainly, as the number of fused rings in the skeleton increases, the difficulty and cost of synthesis also increase greatly. As a comprehensive consideration, the penta-fused-ring (PFR) core has a higher reference value for the development of novel and efficient fused-ring molecular acceptor cores.
To explore the effect of replacing thiophene with pyrrole, we designed and synthesized two new small-molecule PFR acceptors, denoted as DPBT-2Cl and TPBT-2Cl. This is the first synthesis of a fused-ring backbone using pyrrolo[3,2-b] pyrrole (DP) as the edge group of the fused core, indicated by the blue part in Fig. 1(a). The two acceptor molecules kept the same electron withdrawing group and only changed thieno[3,2-b] pyrrole (TP), the green part in Fig. 1(a), to DP at the edge of the fused core. They used an electron-deficient central core and electron-rich units to form the fused ring skeleton, and were capped with a strong electron-withdrawing group by a condensation reaction. DPBT-2Cl (Fig. 1a), 6,10,11-tetrakis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,7,10,11-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrolo[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g][1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]indole-2,8-diyl)bis(methaneylylidene))bis(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile, was synthesized through a four-step reaction (Scheme S1, ESI†), and TPBT-2Cl (Fig. 1a) [2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((10,11-bis(2-butyloctyl)-10,11-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,8-diyl)bis(methaneylylidene))bis(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile-2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((3,7,10,11-tetrakis(2-ethylhexyl-3,7,10,11-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrolo[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g][1,2,5]thiadiazole[3,4-e]indole-2,8-diyl)bis(methaneylylidene))bis(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile(1/1)] was synthesized through a condensation reaction (Scheme S1, ESI†). DPBT and TPBT maintain conjugation along the length of the fused ring skeleton, and the 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile (IC2Cl) unit was used as the end group to enhance ICT, resulting in improved NIR absorption. To verify that the absorption of DPBT-2Cl is more red-shifted and the optical band gap is narrower than that of TPBT-2Cl, we performed UV-Vis spectrum measurements. As compared to TPBT-2Cl, the DPBT-2Cl molecule showed that the spectral absorption peak in chloroform (CF) is red-shifted by 55 nm, the absorption edge is red-shifted by 43 nm, and the absorption onset of the DPBT-2Cl film is 921 nm, red-shifting by 64 nm than that of TPBT-2Cl (Fig. 1b and c, and Table 1). Then the photovoltaic devices were fabricated with PM6/DPBT-2Cl or PM6/TPBT-2Cl as the active layer, and the optimized optimal performance of the conventional photovoltaic device based on PM6/TPBT-2Cl showed a poor PCE of 0.96% with a moderate Voc of 0.74 V, Jsc of 3.56 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 37% at a total weight concentration of 10 mg mL−1 (w/w, 1:1.2) when dissolved in CF at 40 °C for 4 h, whereas the corresponding DPBT-2Cl based device showed an excellent photoelectric performance with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc as high as 23 mA cm−2, and a FF of 64%, achieving a PCE of 11.49% at a total weight concentration of 16 mg mL−1 (w/w, 1:1.2) when dissolved in CF at 40 °C for 4 h. This performance is much higher than the former and is one of the first-echelon performances we know of for reported OSCs based on the penta-fused ring. Furthermore, we observed that the pyrrole-based NFA can form a more ideal phase separation morphology from PM6 in the active layer, which may be attributed to the pyrrole unit in the pyrrole-based NFA is alkyl chain modification, and the thiophene unit in the thiophene-based NFA is not.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As described in Scheme S1 (ESI†), TPBT-2Cl and DPBT-2Cl were easily synthesized. Compound 2 was obtained from the organotin reagent of N-alkyl pyrrole and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-dinitrobenzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole by a Still coupling reaction. Then it was subjected to a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction using dry DMF and POCl3 to obtain the aldehyde compound DPBT-CHO, followed by end-capping with a Knoevenagel condensation reaction to get DPBT-2Cl. TPBT-2Cl was obtained by a one-step condensation reaction of IC2Cl and 10,11-bis(2-butyloctyl)-10,11-dihydro-[1,2,5] thiadiazole[3,4-e]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo [3,2-g]thieno[3,2-b] indole-2,8-dicarbaldehyde (TPBT-CHO). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and high-resolution mass spectra (MALDI-TOF) are shown in Fig. S12 and S22 (ESI†), and the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results of TPBT-2Cl and DPBT-2Cl are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The molecules adopt ladder-type fused ring backbones, as shown in Fig. 1a. Moreover, the steric hindrance of the alkyl chain on the N atom can effectively prevent the excessive aggregation of the central conjugated core while retaining an intramolecular charge transport channel.33 The contact angles of the neat PM6, DPBT-2Cl and TPBT-2Cl films were measured using deionized water and diiodomethane (DIM) as the calibration liquids, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The London dispersion (γd), polar (γp) component, and surface tension (γ) values of the thin films were calculated from the measured contact angles, and the relevant parameters are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†). The surface tension values were determined to be 39.00, 45.05, and 42.27 mN m−1 for the PM6, TPBT-2Cl, and DPBT-2Cl pristine films, respectively, which suggest that TPBT-2Cl and DPBT-2Cl have a very similar surface tension to PM6. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) for each pair of the above materials was determined by applying the formula: , where χPM6-TPBT-2Cl = 0.22 K and χPM6-DPBT-2Cl = 0.07 K, meaning that both DPBT-2Cl and TPBT-2Cl have good compatibility with PM6. Considering that the solubility of the acceptors also has a significant effect on the morphology of the active layer, we tested their solubility in CF, and the values are about 25 mg mL−1 and 15 mg mL−1 for DPBT-2Cl and TPBT-2Cl, respectively. The absorption spectra of pure DPBT-2Cl and TPBT-2Cl in CF solution and blend films with PM6 are shown in Fig. 1b and c. As shown in Fig. 1b, the molar absorption coefficients in CF solution are 2.47 × 105 L (mol−1 × cm−1) for TPBT-2Cl and 2.63 × 105 L (mol−1 × cm−1) for DPBT-2Cl. Compared to the absorption spectrum in solution, a red shift in the film implied the aggregation induced by the molecular framework π–π interactions in the solid state. We also noted that the maximum absorption/onset absorption red-shifted 98/103 nm for DPBT-2Cl, larger than that of 78/82 nm for TPBT-2Cl, implying that DPBT-2Cl exhibits stronger molecular π–π interactions in the solid film. This also indicates to some extent that pyrrole-based NFAs can more easily accumulate and form strong intermolecular π–π interactions than thiophene-based NFAs because of their higher molecular orbital overlap. Thus, the DPBT-2Cl-based OPV device should deliver a higher carrier mobility than the TPBT-2Cl-based counterpart, which will be discussed below. The absorption onset of DPBT-2Cl in the film is 921 nm (Fig. 1c), corresponding to an optical band gap Eoptg of 1.35 eV, as compared to the Eoptg of TPBT-2Cl which is 1.45 eV, meaning a broader photoresponse of PM6/DPBT-2Cl. In order to investigate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of DPBT-2Cl and TPBT-2Cl, we conducted the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement using Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and a ferrocene/ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) redox couple in anhydrous CH3CN solution as the internal reference (Fig. S7, ESI†). Related electrochemical results are summarized in Table 1, and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of DPBT-2Cl and TPBT-2Cl are estimated to be −5.65/−3.90 eV and −5.71/−3.94 eV, respectively.
Photovoltaic properties
As shown in Fig. 1, PM6 has complementary absorption and appropriate energy levels to TPBT-2Cl and DPBT-2Cl. Therefore, PM6 was chosen as the donor matching with the two acceptors to fabricate OSC devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN–Br/Al. The variables involved in the optimization process of active layers include additive content and thermal annealing (TA), which could affect the morphology of the active layer. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristic curves were measured under AM 1.5G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the cell devices was measured using a Stanford Systems SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp, and then a calibrated silicon detector was used to determine the absolute photosensitivity at different wavelengths.
All detailed optimization process and relevant device parameters are summarized in Tables S1–S4 and Fig. S1–S4 (ESI†). When using additive or thermal annealing (TA), the PCE of the PM6/TPBT-2Cl-based device decreased, while in contrast the CN additive or TA enhanced the performance of the OSC based on PM6/DPBT-2Cl. As a result, the optimal conditions for the PM6/DPBT-2Cl-based device are D/A = 1:1.2 (w/w), 0.75% CN as the additive, and TA at 110 °C for 10 minutes, and the optimal conditions for the PM6/TPBT-2Cl-based device are D/A = 1:1.2 (w/w), without an additive, and as-cast. The EQEs were measured to make a thorough investigation of the photoresponse of PM6/DPBT-2Cl-based and PM6/TPBT-2Cl-based devices (Fig. 2b). The devices based on PM6/DPBT-2Cl and PM6/TPBT-2Cl covered broad response ranges of 300–960 nm and 300–860 nm, respectively, and their maximum EQEs achieved 76% at 700 nm and 19% at 640 nm. The calculated Jsc values integrated from the EQE curves were 22.97 mA cm−2 and 4.00 mA cm−2, respectively, both of which were well matched with the Jsc from the J–V measurement (Fig. 2a and Table 2), with only 0.4% and 1.0% errors.

To gain insight into the charge recombination in the devices, the dependence of Voc and Jsc on light intensity (P) was measured.34,35 As shown in Fig. 2c, we observed a weaker dependence of Voc on P for the PM6/DPBT-2Cl device (1.4 kT q−1) than that of the PM6/TPBT-2Cl device (1.8 kT q−1), indicating the relatively strong trap-assisted recombination for the latter. In addition, from the formula of Jsc ∝ Pα, the power-law component α implies the extent of bimolecular recombination. The closer the value of α tends to the limit 1, the smaller the degree of bimolecular recombination in the device is.36 As shown in Fig. 2d, the optimized PM6/DPBT-2Cl device delivered an α value (0.97) higher than that of the PM6/TPBT-2Cl device (0.85), suggesting a weaker bimolecular recombination for the former. This well supports the high Jsc of the PM6/DPBT-2Cl device. More notably, the optimized device based on PM6/DPBT-2Cl showed a substantially suppressed bimolecular recombination compared to the as-cast counterpart (Fig. S9, ESI†), which manifested that the CN additive and TA treatment might optimize the blend morphology and facilitate the charge transport, higher exciton dissociation and higher charge collection efficiency compared to the as-cast devices. This also supports the results that Jsc and FF were both improved after the optimization.
The space charge limited current (SCLC) method37,38 was used to determine the electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) in the OPV cells with the hole-only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au) and electron-only device (ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al) (Table S6, ESI†). The active layers were the as-cast and optimized blend films of PM6/DPBT-2Cl, and the J1/2–V curves of the devices are demonstrated in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Then μh and μe were calculated to be 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for the as-cast blend film, and 5.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for the optimized blend films as listed in Table S6 (ESI†), and obviously both μh and μe were improved after the optimization. We noticed that the μh/μe value (1.11) of the optimized blend film is close to 1 and smaller than that (1.39) of the as-cast blend film, meaning faster and balanced charge carrier transport for the optimized blend films of PM6/DPBT-2Cl than that for the as-cast ones.11 Considering that the exciton dissociation and charge transport are often closely related to the morphology in the blend films, we characterize the morphology of the active layer in the following section.
Subsequently, the measurement of photoluminescence (PL) quenching was conducted to confirm the exciton dissociation and charge-transfer behavior observed in the blend films. The excitation wavelengths of PM6, DPBT-2Cl, and TPBT-2Cl were set at 550, 800 and 700 nm around their maximum absorptions, respectively. The PL spectra of DPBT-2Cl, TPBT-2Cl and their blend films with PM6 are shown in Fig. 3. When mixed with PM6, the PL spectra of the blend films were dramatically quenched by 96% for DPBT-2Cl excited at 800 nm and 86% for TPBT-2Cl excited at 700 nm, and the PL spectrum of PM6 was also effectively quenched by 98% in the blend film of PM6/DPBT-2Cl and 73% in the blend film of PM6/TPBT-2Cl. These results indicate that the electron transfer between PM6 and DPBT-2Cl was more efficient than that between PM6 and TPBT-2Cl, correlated with the higher Jsc and FF values found for the corresponding solar cells.

Active layer morphology characterization
Besides absorption spectra and energy levels, morphology is also critical to device performance.39 The morphologies of the active layers prepared under the optimal conditions were investigated by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to understand the molecular packing within the films (neat and blend).40,41 From the one-dimensional (1D) patterns shown in Fig. 4c, DPBT-2Cl has a strong lamellar stacking signal peak (100) in the in-plane (IP) direction, q = 0.39 Å−1 (d = 16.11 Å), and a strong π–π stacking signal peak (010) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, q = 1.77 Å−1 (d = 3.55 Å). This means that DPBT-2Cl mainly adopts a face-on orientation. TPBT-2Cl has a strong lamellar stacking signal peak (100) in the OOP direction, q = 0.35 Å−1 (d = 17.95 Å), and a distinct π–π stacking signal peak (010) in the IP direction, q = 1.79 Å−1 (d = 3.51 Å). This indicates that TPBT-2Cl mainly adopts an edge-on orientation. Through the above analysis of the orientation of the pure DPBT-2Cl film and pure TPBT-2Cl film, it is found that the two have completely opposite orientations. This is probably due to the effect of additional alkyl chains on the DPBT-2Cl terminal pyrrole, resulting in the face-on orientation of the molecule. According to the analysis of the PM6/DPBT-2Cl mixed film in Fig. 4c, it can be seen that PM6/DPBT-2Cl has a strong lamellar stacking signal peak (100) in the IP direction, q = 0.31 Å−1 (d = 20.27 Å). In addition, in the OOP direction, q = 1.74 Å−1 (d = 3.61 A), there is a strong π–π stacking peak (010). According to the spectrum analysis of the PM6/TPBT-2Cl mixed film in Fig. 4c, it can be seen that PM6/TPBT-2Cl has a strong lamellar stacking signal peak (100) at q = 0.25 Å−1 (d = 25.13 Å) in the IP direction, while there is almost no π–π stacking signal peak (010). According to previous reports, the polymer donor PM6 mainly adopts a face-on orientation and has strong π–π stacking perpendicular to the substrate of the device. If the π–π stacking between the donor and acceptor can be maintained in the same direction, it is beneficial to achieve efficient vertical electron transport in the device. It has been shown that the mobility of charge carriers along the π–π and backbone directions is several orders of magnitude higher than that along the lamellar stacking direction. Because the overall charge transport is in the direction perpendicular to the substrate plane, face-on stacking is considered a more favorable stacking direction. Therefore, the common orientation in the mixed film has a great influence on the performance of the device. Such a stacking mode is conducive to the realization of efficient charge transport perpendicular to the substrate, which is also the reason why the devices corresponding to PM6/DPBT-2Cl show a high Jsc, while that of PM6/TPBT-2Cl is very low.

The AFM micrographs for the blend films in the tapping mode under ambient conditions showed the topography of the blend films with root-mean-square roughness values (Rq) of 1.51 and 1.65 nm (Fig. S11, ESI†) for the PM6/DPBT-2Cl and PM6/TPBT-2Cl, respectively, which indicated that the blend films have a smooth surface.29 According to their TEM images (Fig. 5), compared to PM6/TPBT-2Cl, PM6/DPBT-2Cl showed an increase in the degree of phase separation. Particularly for the PM6/DPBT-2Cl blend film, interpenetrating networks could be clearly observed, suggesting efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport for the PM6/DPBT-2Cl blend film. On the other hand, strong aggregated clusters appeared in the PM6/TPBT-2Cl blend film, which is probably the main reason for the poor performance of TPBT-2Cl-based OSCs. In addition, the alkyl chain is also very important to optimize the morphology of the active layer via side-chain engineering.40

Conclusion
In summary, we designed and synthesized a novel pyrrole-based small-molecule acceptor, namely DPBT-2Cl. Compared with its thiophene-based counterpart (TPBT-2Cl), the absorption peaks of DPBT-2Cl are red-shifted by 55 nm (in solution) and 75 nm (in film). The morphology of the active layer also plays a crucial role in the performance. By modifying the N atom of pyrrole with alkyl chain as the side-chain engineering, the phase separation of PM6/DPBT-2Cl in the active layer is more ideal than that of PM6/TPBT-2Cl. The PCE was increased from 1.0% to 11.5%, which is one of the high performances we know of for reported OSCs based on the penta-fused ring. Furthermore, the Jsc was increased from 3.56 mA cm−2 to 23.1 mA cm−2, and the Voc was slightly improved from 0.74 V to 0.78 V. It has been demonstrated that core engineering by replacing thiophene with pyrrole enables lower-band gap NFAs and side chain engineering enables a more ideal phase separation morphology in the active layer, which is an excellent strategy to realize a simultaneous enhancement in both Voc and Jsc and maximize the performance of OPVs. Furthermore, it can be expected that, based on DPBT, to expand the number of fused rings in the molecular framework by using more pyrrole or thiophene units would possibly produce a novel class of NFA molecules with more red-shifted spectral absorption and better photovoltaic performance.
