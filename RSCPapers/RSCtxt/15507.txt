    , Accepted 21st January 2021First published on 22nd January 2021AbstractThe synthesis of methane from CO2 and H2O using a Ru catalyst and water electrolyzer was examined between 210 and 270 °C. A Ru/TiO2 catalyst, Pd–Ag membrane, CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 electrolyte, and Pt anode were combined. At 10 mA cm−2, 0.087 cmSTP3 min−1 CO2 flow rate, and 270 °C, 93.3% of the current was consumed for methanation and 59% CO2 conversion was attained. The formation of H2 and CO as byproducts accounted for 1.7% and 0.33% of the current, respectively, under these conditions. The potential of the proposed method as a power-to-gas technology is discussed.
Increased utilization of renewable energy can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, which leads to a sustainable society. The construction of solar and wind power plants is globally expanding. A fundamental drawback of solar and wind power plants is that their electricity output fluctuates considerably depending on the weather. Furthermore, areas abundant in solar and wind energy are often not areas of high population density. Storage of electricity on a large scale and its transportation over long distances are difficult, and the utilization of surplus solar and wind power has become a key technological objective of the next generation. The conversion of surplus electricity to chemical fuels is expected to be a central research theme. Modern Li ion batteries exhibit a capacity of ca. 260 W h kg−1 which corresponds to 936 kJ kg−1.1,2 However, the heat of combustion of CH4 is 55.5 MJ kg−1 (890 kJ mol−1).3,4 Hence, the difference in energy density between batteries and chemical fuels is remarkable. Chemical fuels can be stored in simple tanks without the requirement of complicated structures such as batteries; thus, their scalability is significant. Herein, we propose a new method for the conversion of CO2 and H2O to CH4 using an electrochemical cell as a power-to-gas technology.
Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a significant research topic in energy conversion technology.5–12 At elevated temperatures (800–1000 °C), solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) convert CO2 and H2O to CO and H2. Organic compounds, such as hydrocarbons and alcohols, cannot be obtained at such temperatures because of chemical equilibrium limitations. Although the mixture of CO and H2 is a synthetic gas that can be converted to various chemicals by catalytic processes,13 CO is generally not regarded as a fuel itself. However, CO2 reduction in aqueous electrolytes at ambient temperature forms various mixed products and this process has been extensively studied.5–12 A typical example entails copper electrodes reducing CO2 chiefly to CH4 and C2H4.12 The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in aqueous electrolytes has been intensively studied. The low current density and high overpotential of aqueous electrochemical systems are drawbacks. Additionally, selectivity for objective products is challenging to achieve in aqueous electrochemical systems. Electrochemical CO2 reduction to useful chemical fuels has not yet reached an industrial level of efficiency.
The catalytic conversion of CO2 with H2 to CH4 is termed the Sabatier reaction and is shown in eqn (1).13–17 CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O(1)
Ni and Ru catalysts are frequently used in this reaction.13–17 CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O can be practically performed using a combination of water electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction.20,21 However, the combination of two independent processes, water electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction, presents two essential issues. The first is associated with thermodynamics. Considering that under standard conditions which include liquid water, water electrolysis is an endothermic process, which requires 1.23 V of electrochemical (ΔrG° = 237 kJ mol−1-H2), and 49 kJ mol−1-H2 of heat energy.3,4 Here, ΔrG° and ΔrH° denote standard Gibbs energy and enthalpy changes for the reaction. Therefore, overall, 1.48 V (ΔrH° = 286 kJ mol−1-H2) of energy is required if all of it is to be supplied by electricity.3,4 Even with the exclusion of electrochemical energy, water electrolysis is an endothermic reaction. However, the Sabatier reaction is exothermic with ΔrH° = −165 kJ mol−1-CH4 (−41.3 kJ mol−1-H2).14,15 If the Sabatier reaction is performed as a separate process, the generated heat would be wasted. When water electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction are performed in a single vessel at the same temperature, endothermic and exothermic heats are largely compensated.18,19 Therefore, direct synthesis of CH4 in an electrochemical cell from CO2 and H2O has an energetic advantage over being performed in an isolated system.18,19 Second, the frequent start/stop operation is not favorable for combining the water electrolyzer and Sabatier reactor. The output of solar and wind power plants frequently fluctuates; therefore, the system should be controllable for fluctuating output. A single electrochemical device may have an advantage over the combination of two separate processes for variable operations, as seen in fuel cells.
Our group has reported an electrochemical system for NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2O.22–24 A Ru-based ammonia catalyst (Ru/Cs+/MgO), H-permeable membrane (Pd–Ag), phosphate electrolyte (CsH2PO4/SiP2O7), and Pt anode comprise the cell, which was operated at 200–250 °C and 0.1–0.7 MPa.24 NH3 is synthesized near the limit of thermodynamic equilibrium (5–17% conversion of H2 depending on temperature and pressure). The CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 electrolyte exhibits sufficient proton conductance between 150 and 300 °C.25,26 This electrochemical system was considered to be more suitable for CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O than for NH3 synthesis because of the matched temperature and pressure ranges. The equilibrium limitation of the Sabatier reaction tends toward the product side in this temperature and pressure range, in contrast to that of NH3 synthesis. Note that the catalyst in this cell behaves as thermal catalyst without any electrochemical potential as the H-permeable membrane electrically isolates the catalysts from the electrolyte. Electrochemical methane formation from CO2 and water has been achieved with molten CsH2PO4 salt at 350 °C, but only a small amount of methane was detected.27 Phosphate electrolyte systems display considerable potential for application in intermediate-temperature electrolysis.28
In this short article, electrochemical cells, which consist of a phosphate electrolyte, Pd–Ag membrane, and Ru catalyst were investigated for CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O. Ru catalysts are known to be suitable for the Sabatier reaction at laboratory-scale over a wide temperature range without generating CO byproducts.19
A schematic of the electrochemical cell is shown in Fig. 1. Electrochemical cell construction was identical to that detailed in our previous studies.22–24 CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 electrolyte powder was pressed into a disk of 20 mm in diameter (3.1 cm2) and 2 mm in thickness. The anode comprised Pt paste (TANAKA Precious Metals, TR-7070) applied on a carbon sheet with a diameter of 20 mm (TORAY, TGP-H-120), which was calcined at 300 °C. Pt loading was approximately 10 mg cm−2. The Pd–Ag (25 mol% Ag) membrane was 0.1 mm in thickness. Ru/TiO2 (10 wt%) was prepared by impregnation of TiO2 (Catalysis Society Japan, reference catalysts, JRC-TIO15) in a tetrahydrofuran solution of Ru3(CO)12. After evaporation of THF, the catalyst was calcined at 300 °C in vacuum to form metallic Ru particles. Ru/TiO2 powders were formed into granules with diameters of 600–800 μm, and 130 mg cm−2 of Ru/TiO2 granules were set into the cell. The cathode and anode vessels of the cell were constructed with stainless steel (SUS304) and titanium, respectively. Due to the fact that CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 electrolyte is corrosive, a titanium vessel was used for the anode side. A gasket made of polytetrafluoroethylene (GORE, Hyper-sheet gasket) was placed between the cathode and anode vessels, and the maximum operating temperature was 315 °C. The Pd–Ag membrane, CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 electrolyte disk, and Pt/carbon sheet were pressed by a compression coil in the cell.

The electrochemical cell was placed in an oven at 100 °C to avoid water condensation. CO2, Ar, and H2 gases were controlled by mass flow controllers, and H2O was injected into the line using a plunger pump. The exhaust gas from the cathode vessel was analyzed using gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (GL Science, GC-3200).
Transmission electron microscopy images of 10 wt% Ru/TiO2 and TiO2, which is obtained by JEOL JEM-2100F, are shown in Fig. 2. The TiO2 particles were approximately 20–30 nm in diameter and Ru particles, 2–3 nm in diameter, were dispersed on TiO2 surfaces. The Ru particle size was comparable to that described in the literature.19 The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD, Shimazu XRD-6100) of CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 was similar to the previous works.22–26
 Fig. 2  Transmission electron microscope images of 10 wt% (A) Ru/TiO2 and (B) TiO2. 
First, the activity of 10 wt% Ru/TiO2 was examined for the methanation of CO2 with H2 without electrolysis. A stoichiometric mixture of 0.90 cmSTP3 min−1-CO2 and 3.6 cmSTP3 min−1-H2 was introduced into the cathode vessel without any electrolysis of H2O; STP indicates values at standard temperature and pressure conditions (0 °C and 101 kPa). The temperature was varied between 110 and 270 °C. The conversion of CO2 and H2 in CH4 formation is shown in Fig. 3. The conversion of CO2 exceeded 98% above 230 °C, confirming that this catalyst exhibited sufficient activity for the methanation of CO2 in this temperature and flow rate region. The equilibrium limit of Sabatier reaction is >95% in CO2 conversion below 300 °C (ref. 29) while the reaction above 190 °C in this study almost reached equilibrium. Below 190 °C, the conversion of CO2 was found to be kinetically limited. Employing electrolysis at 10 mA cm−2, H2 formation was equivalent to only 0.22 cmSTP3 min−1, which is approximately 23-fold lower than the H2 flow rate in the methanation of CO2. The activity of 10 wt% Ru/TiO2 was considered sufficient for electrolysis at 10 mA cm−2. CO production was not detected, which indicates that the formation of CO was less than 0.5% that of CH4. Other organic gases, such as higher hydrocarbons and alcohols, were not detected by gas chromatography. Thus, 130 mg cm−2 of 10 wt% Ru/TiO2 was found to exhibit appropriate activity and selectivity for CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O even when combined with electrolysis.

Filled circles and triangles denote decreasing temperature results, and open circles and triangles denote increasing temperature results. CO was not detected, indicating that the formation of CO was less than 0.5% that of CH4. 
Next, CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O using electrolysis was examined with the exclusion of H2 by changing the flow rate of CO2. The temperature and current density were fixed at 270 °C and 10 mA cm−2, respectively. The current density was controlled by a constant-current power supply to maintain constant reaction rates. Typically, the present cell is operated at 10–30 mA cm−2, and it can be operated for a few hours at 30 mA cm−2. At 10 mA cm−2, the cell voltage was maintained between 1.5 and 1.8 V for several days, as described in our previous report.22–24 Ar flow at 10 cmSTP3 min−1 along with injection of liquid H2O at 10 μL min−1 was implemented for the anode vessel. 10 μL min−1 of H2O is equivalent to 12 cmSTP3 min−1 of gas, and the ratio of steam, H2O/(Ar + H2O), in the anode gas is thus 55%. The formation rates of CH4, H2, and CO in the exhaust gas and the conversion of CO2 to CH4 and CO are plotted in Fig. 4. Other organic gases, such as higher hydrocarbons and alcohols, were not detected by gas chromatography. The CH4 formation rate increased with increasing CO2 flow rate and remained virtually constant above a CO2 flow rate of 0.087 cmSTP3 min−1. H2 formation was evident below a CO2 flow rate of 0.043 cmSTP3 min−1, which indicates that the rate of H2 formation derived from the current density stoichiometrically exceeded the rate of CO2 flow. As discussed in the previous paragraph, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (104 nmol-electron per s per cm2) corresponds to 0.22 cmSTP3 min−1-H2 formation for the whole cell. The stoichiometric amount of CO2 flow is a quarter that of H2, which is 0.05 cmSTP3 min−1. The appearance of H2 formation below a CO2 flow rate of 0.05 cmSTP3 min−1 was reasonably explained by stoichiometry. A small amount of CO was observed in the entire region of CO2 flow. However, the formation of CO was 1.2–1.9% that of the total formation of both CH4 and CO. CO formation increased slightly with increasing CO2 flow.

Formation rates of CH4, H2, and CO (left axis) and conversions of CO2 to CH4 and CO (right axis) as a function of CO2flow rate. Note that the values for CO were multiplied by 10. The anode gas was Ar at a flow rate of10 cmSTP3 min−1 with 10 μL min−1 of H2O as liquid. 
Formation rates, CO selectivities, and current efficiencies are summarized in Table 1. The current efficiencies for CH4, CO, and H2 formations (CECH4, CECO, and CEH2, respectively) were defined as follows.      where rCH4, rCO, and rH2 are rates of formation of CH4, CO, and H2, respectively. F and j are faradaic constant (96485 s A mol−1) and current density, respectively. Although CO2 is converted to CH4 by catalytic reactions without any electrochemical reaction in this system, the protons are electrochemically reduced to hydrogen atoms at the cathode/electrolyte interface and quantities of all reactions are associated to produced hydrogen atoms, even. When sum of current efficiency for all products are different from 100%, leakage in the cell between the anode and cathode parts through the electrolytes or sealing materials is possible. The accuracy of product analysis and flow meters may contribute the current efficiency. Current efficiency is proof that the electrochemical system is properly working.

The maximum current efficiency for CH4 formation was 93.3% obtained at a CO2 flow rate of 0.087 cmSTP3 min−1, and the current efficiencies for H2 and CO formations were 1.7% and 0.33%, respectively, under these conditions. Due to the fact that H2 and CO formation are two-electron processes, while CH4 formation is an eight-electron reaction, the fraction of current efficiency for H2 and CO formation is smaller than the formation rate fraction. CO was slightly observed for the synthesis with electrolysis, but not for the Sabatier reaction from CO2 and H2. The CO2 conversion with electrolysis was smaller than for Sabatier reaction from CO2 and H2. For the synthesis with electrolysis, the catalyst layer worked as a counter flow reactor such that the inhomogeneous mixing of H2 and CO2 is a possible reason for the significant CO production and smaller CO2 conversion. For Sabatier reaction, all reactants are well-mixed and flowed in the catalyst bed in one direction while the whole part of catalysts is efficiently utilized. However, for electrolysis, H2 is supplied from the Pd–Ag side, but CO2 was supplied from the gas phase side. The part of the catalyst layer, which can contact with the stoichiometric mixture of reactant, is quite limited. Thus, the conversion of CO2 was considered to be smaller than that for Sabatier reaction from CO2 and H2, which almost reached chemical equilibrium. Total current efficiency deviated from 100%, and this was more prominent below a CO2 flow rate of 0.043 cmSTP3 min−1. There are two possible reasons for this deviation. First, there may be leakage in the cell between the anode and cathode parts, arising from the clacking of the electrolyte disk or inefficient sealing. A portion of produced H2 and O2 could be recombined in the cell, thereby lowering current efficiency. The second possibility is based on the accuracy of the CO2 flow rate. Flow rates in the range below 1 cmSTP3 min−1 are difficult to control by a mass flow controller. This may contain about 10% error. The gas chromatography only monitored the ratios of CH4, H2, and CO, but not their absolute amounts. Thus, the current efficiencies are derived from the CO2 flow rate and the ratio of CH4, H2, and CO; consequently, the accuracy of the CO2 flow rate was directly reflected in the current efficiencies. Nevertheless, this electrochemical system produced CH4 from CO2 and H2O with a current efficiency of 93.3% which indicates its significant potential for practical application in power-to-gas technology.
The temperature dependence of CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O using electricity was examined, as shown in Fig. 5. The formation rate of CH4 decreased with decreasing temperature. However, H2 formation was dominant at lower temperatures. Formation of the CO byproduct was considerable between 230 and 250 °C. Due to the fact that the formation rate and conversion were not saturated with temperature even at 270 °C, the activity of Ru/TiO2 was considered to be insufficient. Thus, the development of more active catalysts is regarded as the next objective.
 Fig. 5  Formation rates of CH4, H2, and CO and conversion of CO2 for the synthesis from CO2 and H2O with constant current of 10 mA cm−2 and a CO2 flow rate of 0.043 cmSTP3 min−1 as a function of temperature. Note that the rates of CO were multiplied by 10. The anode gas was 10 cmSTP3 min−1 of Ar with 10 μL min−1 of H2O as liquid. 
This electrochemical system could convert CO2 and H2O to CH4 using electricity with a current efficiency of over 90%. The cell voltage was in the range of 1.5–1.8 V; thus, total energy efficiency was comparable to that of commercial water electrolysis. However, several challenges remain for this system. First, the current density was as low as 10 mA cm−2 in this study, and the maximum current density was 30 mA cm−2 in our previous work.24 At 30 mA cm−2, the cell was degraded within a few hours with increasing overpotential, and it was operational for several days at 10 mA cm−2. Industrial electrolyzers require a current density between a few hundred mA and a few A; therefore, considerable electrode and electrolyte improvements are essential. The reasons for limited current density are considered as follows: the separation of Pd–Ag membrane and phosphate electrolyte by deformation of membrane for H-absorption; the use of carbon and organic materials at the anode also promotes the degradation; and the highly humid acidic condition of cell affects the electric contact of various parts. Further improvement in cell design is required for stability at higher current density. Second, the cell is several millimeters thick. The stacking of single cells is required for practical use, and the thickness of the cell should be less than 1 mm. Hence, the development of thinner cells is crucial for practical applications. Improving catalyst activity is important for decreasing the thickness. Third, this cell uses an H-permeable Pd–Ag membrane. The use of H-permeable membranes as cathodes has been remarkably effective for NH3 synthesis because NH3 is readily absorbed by acidic electrolytes.22–25 The feed steam can be isolated by H-permeable membranes to avoid mixing with NH3. For CH4 synthesis, reactants and products are not all alkaline, and H2O is formed on the cathode side as a product. H-permeable membranes are therefore not strictly necessary and can be replaced by another cathode material. Pd, Pt, and Ru are used as the H-permeable membrane, anode, and catalyst, respectively; however, the use of precious metals inhibits the broad commercialization of this system.
Although this electrochemical system is still a primitive technology for CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O, CH4 synthesis was achieved with a current efficiency of 93.3%. The potential of electrolyzers in the synthesis of chemical fuels from abundant gases, such as CO2 and H2O, at intermediate temperatures in the range of 270 °C was demonstrated. In addition to NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2O,22–24 this system can synthesize CH4 with significant current efficiency and minimal production of byproducts, H2 and CO.
Conclusions
An electrochemical cell comprising a phosphate electrolyte, Pd–Ag membrane, and Ru catalyst was examined for CH4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O using electricity at 270 °C and 10 mA cm−2. The production rate of CH4 was 12.1 nmol s−1 cm−2 and a current efficiency of 93.3% was achieved. Current efficiencies of 1.7% and 0.33% were detected for the formation of byproducts CO and H2, respectively. This single electrochemical system is expected to evolve into an efficient power-to-gas device in future.

 	Fig. 5  Formation rates of CH4, H2, and CO and conversion of CO2 for the synthesis from CO2 and H2O with constant current of 10 mA cm−2 and a CO2 flow rate of 0.043 cmSTP3 min−1 as a function of temperature. Note that the rates of CO were multiplied by 10. The anode gas was 10 cmSTP3 min−1 of Ar with 10 μL min−1 of H2O as liquid.
