In recent years, side-chain engineering has become a promising strategy for researchers to modulate and realize high Voc. In this study, we adopted a new side-chain to coordinate the molecular crystallinity and miscibility, affording a copolymer L19, in which the benzodithiophene (BDT) and dithienobenzothiadiazole (DTBT) units were used as the electron-sufficient and -defective units, respectively. As a comparison, a non-fluorinated analogue L18 was also synthesized. As a result, the OSCs based on L19:Y6 exhibited an impressive Voc than L18-based devices (0.93 V vs. 0.89 V) due to further fluorination. L19 had the higher hole mobility of 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 than L18 of 7.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and better miscibility, thereby achieving a higher PCE of 11.73% for L19 than that of L18 (6.44%). Moreover, the high Voc of 0.93 V is a good reference for Y-series small molecular acceptor systems. These results indicate that the new side-chains of L19 can synergistically regulate the HOMO level and miscibility between the donor and acceptor, providing more options for the development of a high open-circuit voltage polymer for Y-series based non-fullerene systems.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention from the scientific community around the world due to their outstanding advantages, such as solution-processing, low cost, light weight and flexible properties.1–7 With the boom in Y-series (such as Y6) small molecular acceptors in recent years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have exceeded 18%.8–10 However, PM6 is still the most widely used polymer donor in the OSCs with Y-series non-fullerene acceptors until now.11 The fewer choices of polymer donors restrict the development of OSCs. Currently, in order to further improve the performance of Y-series small molecular acceptor-based OSCs, it is also necessary to develop high open-circuit voltage (Voc) polymer donors.12–19
In general, the development of novel polymer donors includes two strategies: main-chain engineering and side-chain engineering.20,21 To further fine-tune the polymer crystalline property and microscale phase-separation and miscibility, the modification on the side chains of the polymer is an effective and widely used strategy.22,23 In simple terms, side-chain engineering is realized by connecting different modified side chains to the main chain. Benzodithiophene (BDT) as a star electron-donating core, is often used in copolymer donors because of its good planarity, high mobility and easy modification.24 To further tune the photoelectric and stacking properties of polymer donors, the use of conjugated heterocyclics (such as furan, thiophene, benzene ring, etc.) as side chains to modify the electron-donating units is the current mainstream method.25–29 Thereinto, the phenyl side chains have been proved to decrease the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and observably increase Voc as compared to other conjugated heterocyclic side chains. For example, Guo et al. replaced the thiophene unit with a benzene moiety as the BDT-conjugated side chain, which further reduced the HOMO energy level of the polymer, and the Voc in the photovoltaic device was as high as 0.88 V.30 On the other hand, fluorination is also a common mean in side-chain engineering, and it is an effective method to adjust the molecular crystallinity and energy levels.31–33 However, the increase in crystallinity is a double-edged sword, and too strong crystallization can cause oversize phase separation, reducing the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. This problem can be solved by regulating the position of alkyl-chain on the conjugated side chain. In 2020, Huo et al. reported that the alkyl-chain in the meta position could more easily control the miscibility between the donor and acceptor.34
In this study, we designed and synthesized two new polymer donors L18 (side chain with nonfluorination) and L19 (side chain with fluorination) by adopting differently fluorinated phenyl-substituted BDT units with phenyl meta-substitution positions of the alkyl chain as the donor units and dithienobenzothiadiazole (DTBT) as the acceptor units (Scheme 1). Both L18 and L19 exhibited high Voc due to the low electron-delocalization of phenyl side chain than thienyl homologue, which decreased their HOMO levels, respectively. Compared to L18, the introduction of fluorine further deepened the HOMO level of L19, thereby achieving a higher Voc of 0.93 V. Moreover, the synergistic effect of the alkyl positions on the phenyl side chain and fluorination facilitated the intermolecular charge transfer for L19 in the active layer.35,36 As a result, the device based on L19:Y6 realized a higher PCE of 11.73% than the L18-based device. The study indicates that the synergistic effect of the alkyl positions on the phenyl side chain and fluorination can not only enhance Voc resulting from the decreased HOMO energy level, but also achieve the fine-tuning of crystallinity and miscibility.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes of the copolymers of L18 and L19 are shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed synthesis of the polymers are exhibited in the ESI.† Both polymers exhibited good solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene (CB). The number of the average molecular weights (Mn) of L18 and L19 were determined to be 12.8 and 13.5 kDa with polymer dispersity index (PDI) values of 2.0 and 1.8, respectively, by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in a chloroform eluent with a polystyrene standard. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed the thermal properties of L18 and L19. The TGA curves of the two polymers showed the decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss at 358 °C and 373 °C for L18 and L19, respectively (Fig. S7†). The result suggests that the two polymers have adequate thermal stability for the application of PSCs.
Optical properties and energy levels
The normalized UV-visible absorption spectra of L18 and L19 in the chloroform solution and thin films were measured to study the optical properties of the two polymers. The detailed data of the optical properties are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the two polymers exhibited the same major absorption peaks at 522 nm and outstanding shoulder peaks at 556 nm at 20 °C, suggesting strong aggregation behaviors in solution.37 With an increase in temperature, L19 demonstrated a more obvious major peak relative to the shoulder peak, which was mainly due to the introduction of fluorine atoms on the side chain of L19 to increase the intermolecular aggregation. As shown in Fig. 1c, the main absorption peaks of L18 and L19 were at 531 and 528 nm in the films, respectively. Compared to the solution state, L18 and L19 in the film state red-shifted 9 nm and 6 nm, respectively, indicating stronger π–π interactions in the polymer thin film than those in solution. The absorption onsets in films (λonset) of L18 and L19 were both 612 nm, and the corresponding optical bandgaps of the two polymers were 2.03 eV. To assess the molecular energy levels of the two polymers, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to measure their HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The onset oxidation and reduction potentials are shown in Fig. S8,† and their corresponding EHOMO/ELUMO values could be calculated according to the equations of EHOMO/ELUMO = −e(Eox/red + 4.80) (eV). The measured HOMO/LUMO values were −5.43 eV/−3.44 eV and −5.47 eV/−3.43 eV for L18 and L19, respectively. Fig. 1d exhibits the energy level diagrams of donor and acceptor, indicating the effective exciton dissociation in their interfaces.

Organic solar cell performance
In order to estimate the photovoltaic performance of L18 and L19, OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were tested under air mass 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination, and the relevant device structure is shown in Fig. 2a. The optimized photovoltaic performance of PSCs fabricated with various device fabrication conditions were carefully screened, including various D:A ratios, additive mass content, and annealing temperatures, and the corresponding experimental results are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.†Fig. 2b shows the J–V curves of the optimal devices and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Table 2. The best PSC based on L18:Y6 demonstrated a PCE of 6.44% with a Voc of 0.89 V, Jsc of 17.25 mA cm−2, and FF of 41.85%. In contrast, the optimal device of L19:Y6 exhibited an enhanced photovoltaic performance with a superior PCE of 11.73%, accompanied by a Voc of 0.93 V, high Jsc of 22.88 mA cm−2, and FF of 54.86%. Thereinto, the L19-based devices exhibited higher Voc than that of L18-based devices, which was ascribed to the introduction of fluorine reducing the HOMO level for L19. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2c, we found that the Voc of devices based on L19:Y6 was the highest among devices based on polymer:Y6 in recent studies, and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table S2.†Fig. 2d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the optimized devices of the two polymers. From the EQE spectra, both devices exhibited an excellent photoresponse region covering from 300 to 900 nm, distinctly, and the L19-based device displayed a stronger photoresponse than L18 in the range from ≈450 to 850 nm, even achieving a maximal EQE value over 75% in the range of 490–600 nm for L19. The different EQE photoresponse values of the two polymers can conclude that the L19-based device has a more efficient photon-harvesting, hence achieving higher Jsc.

To further study the charge carrier mobility in L19 and L18, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to investigate the carrier transport properties of the neat copolymers and their blended films.38 The hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) in the active layers were measured with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag, respectively, and the related results are shown in Fig. S9 and Table S3.† As expected, the L19 possessed a higher μh value of 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that of L18 (7.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). For the blended films, L18:Y6 showed the μh and μe values were 5.93 × 10−4 and 7.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the corresponding μh/μe ratio is 0.78. The μh and μe of L19 were calculated to be 3.34 × 10−3 and 3.32 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.01. The higher and more balanced charge mobilities of L19:Y6 improved the charge transport and explained the reason why the blend film of L19:Y6 had higher Jsc and FF than the L18-based devices.
To further gain a better understanding of the different side chains on the exciton dissociation and charge recombination in OSCs, the relationship of the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff), as well as the relationship dependence Jsc/Voc and light intensity (Plight) were measured. First, the exciton dissociation and charge collection characteristics of PSC devices based on L18 and L19 are discussed. The Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. The Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and V is the applied voltage. On the other hand, when Veff ≥ 2 V, the Jph reaches saturation (Jsat), indicating that all of the excitons are dissociated into mobile charge carriers and collected by the corresponding electrodes. Therefore, the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) could be estimated by the Jph/Jsat ratio.39,40 As shown in Fig. S10,† the values of Pdiss were 84.9% and 93.5% for the PSCs based on L18:Y6 and L19:Y6, respectively, which suggested that the L19-based device had higher charge generation and collection efficiency than that of the L18-based device. Subsequently, the evolution trend of photocurrent (Jsc) versus the light intensity (P) was measured. In general, the relationship between Jsc and P can be defined as Jsc ∝ Pα, and when the value of α is close to 1, it indicates less charge-recombination.41–44 As shown in Fig. 2e, the corresponding image slopes of the logJscversus logP were 0.94 and 0.95 for the L18 and L19-based devices, respectively. This result indicates that the bimolecular recombination in the two sets of devices can be effectively suppressed, which helped to improve the Jsc and FF of the devices. To confirm the mode of charge-recombination, the dependence curves of Voc on different P were plotted. The slope of Vocversus ln(P) can reflect the degree of trap-assisted recombination in the device. When the slope is close to kT/q, it means that bimolecular recombination is the dominant. However, when the slope is close to 2kT/q, it indicates that trap-assisted recombination is in a dominant position, where k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge. As shown in Fig. 2f, the slopes of the devices based on L18:Y6 and L19:Y6 were 1.80kT/q and 1.02kT/q, respectively. These results suggest that the bimolecular recombination was dominant in the devices based on L19:Y6, and fluorination in the side chain can suppress the trap-assisted recombination. Combined with the above analysis, L19-based devices had higher charge generation and collection efficiency, less charge-recombination, thereby obtaining higher FF, Jsc and PCE in the PSCs.
The stability of photovoltaic devices plays an important role in the commercial applications of OSCs. Fig. S11† exhibits the photovoltaic performance of the unencapsulated devices under nitrogen atmosphere at approximately 25 °C. It can be seen that the L19:Y6-based device demonstrated better storage stability than that of the L18:Y6-based devices. After storing for 510 h in the glove box, the L18:Y6-based device remained 75.83% of its initial PCE, while the L19:Y6-based device remained about 81.59% of its initial PCE.
Morphological characterization
The morphology of the active layer often plays an important role in the photovoltaic performance of the device. To further explore its influence, we characterized and analyzed the phase separation and micromorphology of L18 and L19 neat and blend films by an atomic force microscope (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The AFM height and phase images of the neat and blend films of the two polymers are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the root-mean-square (RMS) values of the L18 and L19 neat films were 1.38 and 0.7 nm, respectively. With blending with acceptor Y6, the RMS values of L18 and L19 blend films increased to 1.22 and 1.09 nm, respectively (Fig. 3c and d). After the optimized process, both blend films displayed changed RMS values (Fig. 3e and f), which indicated that the thermal annealing and additives were efficient to tune the micromorphology of the active layer. Importantly, the blend films of L19:Y6 (0.58 nm) displayed a more uniform surface and smaller RMS value than L18:Y6 films (0.81 nm), signifying that L19 had better miscibility with the acceptor and a more ordered morphology in the blend films due to the large steric hindrance derived from the alkyl chain of phenyl meta-substitution positions. The phase images of L18:Y6 exhibited distinct phase separation compared with the L19:Y6 blend film under the optimized conditions (Fig. S12†). Furthermore, the TEM micrographs of the L19:Y6 blends showed a smaller nanoscale phase separation with the appropriate nanosize than the L18 blends (Fig. 3g and h). Consequently, the L19:Y6 blend film could generate better exciton dissociation and carrier transport, achieving higher Jsc and FF than those of the L18-based devices.

In order to comprehensively compare the miscibility between the different polymers and Y6, the contact angles of L18, L19 and Y6 with water and glycerol were measured, as shown in Fig. 4. The two polymers showed gradually increasing water contact angles (L18 (103.3°), L19 (104.6°)) and the same trend was observed for glycerol contact angles, and the contact angles of Y6 with water and glycerol were 90.4°and 81°, respectively. The surface tension data of L18, L19 and Y6 as well as the interfacial tension between copolymer donor and Y6 receptor were calculated, and the related results are shown in Tables S4 and S5.† The surface tensions of L18 and L19 were 31.58 and 28 mN m−1, respectively, and the surface tension of Y6 was 21.57 mN m−1. The surface tension gap between L19 and Y6 was smaller than that of L18 and Y6, which indicated that the L19:Y6 blend had higher miscibility. The interfacial tensions between the two polymers and Y6 were 11.69 and 9.55 mN m−1, respectively. The interfacial tension calculated from the corresponding surface tension data shows that the lower was the miscibility of the blend, the higher was the interfacial tension value. On the contrary, the higher miscibility of the mixture led to the lower interfacial tension value.45 In attention, the miscibility variation of the blends was further determined by analyzing the Flory–Huggins46 interaction parameter χ, χ values of the L18:Y6 and L19:Y6 blends were 0.95 and 0.42, respectively. In general, a high χ value indicates lower miscibility and high molecular domains, which may result in a greater phase separation, which is unfavorable for carrier transport and exciton separation at the interface between the donor and the acceptor. In our study, the L19:Y6 blend achieved more balanced miscibility and thus obtained higher PCE.

The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement was adopted to study the molecular accumulation and crystal characteristics of the two polymer films. The 2D GIWAXS profiles and corresponding line-cuts of in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions are exhibited in Fig. 5. Both L18 and L19 neat films showed a predominant face-on molecular orientation and distinct (010) π–π stacking diffraction peaks were observed at 1.57 and 1.60 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, respectively, corresponding to the π–π stacking distances of 4.0 and 3.93 Å. Moreover, the lamellar scattering of both polymer films was observed at 0.31 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction. L19 showed a smaller π–π stacking distance than that of L18, which means that the introduction of fluorine atoms was beneficial to increasing the intermolecular stacking degree. As for the neat films, the crystal coherence length (CCL) of L18 (18.38 Å) was larger than that of L19 (17.8 Å); however, when mixing with acceptor Y6, the CCL value of the TA-treated L19:Y6 blend film was calculated to be 19.79 Å, which was larger than that of the L18:Y6 blend film, indicating that the crystallinity became stronger after the blending of L19 and Y6. In addition, compared with the L18:Y6 blend film, the L19:Y6 blend film had a more obvious face-on molecular stacking orientation, and the intensity of π–π stacking diffraction peaks was greater in the OOP direction. Moreover, L19:Y6 blends exhibited tighter molecular packing features in the OOP direction, and the stacking distance was 3.67 Å, which was smaller than that of the L18 blend (3.70 Å), suggesting that L19:Y6 blends had better charge transport capability in the vertical direction of the substrate, which was consistent with its better photovoltaic performances.

In summary, we designed and synthesized two new conjugated polymers, L18 and L19, and used them as polymer donors to blend with Y6 acceptors for high open-circuit voltage photovoltaic polymers. In comparison with L18, the introduction of fluorine not only further deepened the HOMO level of L19 but also improved its charge mobility. Moreover, the L19 blend films had a more suitable phase separation size and an efficient and balanced charge transport. As a result, the PSC based on L19:Y6 realized a pronounced superior performance to its competitor of L18:Y6. Simultaneously, the synergistic effect of the alkyl positions on the phenyl side chain and fluorination played important roles in enhancing its Voc and miscibility, achieving an impressive high open-circuit voltage based on the Y6 small molecular acceptor-based non-fullerene systems. Therefore, the feasible and efficient molecular designing strategy could be referenced to other donor polymers for high-performance Y6-based non-fullerene systems. In addition, the lower Jsc and FF in this binary blend could be considered to be further improved simultaneously by using the complementary advantages of the third component from a ternary system, this work is in progress.
