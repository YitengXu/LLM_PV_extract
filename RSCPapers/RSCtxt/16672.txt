    , Accepted 10th January 2014First published on 17th January 2014AbstractRoom temperature liquid-like nanoparticles have emerged as an exciting new research and development area, because their properties could be tailored over a broad range by manipulating geometric and chemical characteristics of the inorganic core and organic canopy. However, related applications are rarely reported due to the multi-step synthesis process and potential toxicity of cadmium based nanomaterials. In this study, we prepared inexpensive and eco-friendly carbon dot fluid by the direct thermal decomposition method. The carbon dot fluid can be excited from UV to near infrared light, and can be prepared as highly concentrated luminescent ink or incorporated into sol–gel derived organically modified silicate glass, suggesting that it has great application potential in the field of printable electronics, solid state lighting and so on.
1. Introduction
In recent years, functionalized nanoparticles with liquid-like behavior in the absence of solvents have received great attention, because of their prospect of breaking through the limitations of current nanoscale objects which have been commonly utilized in the form of dry powders, dilute solutions or ultrathin films.1–3 Since the first report in 2005, two approaches have been utilized to produce solvent-free nanoparticle fluids, which are ion-exchange4–7 and acid–base reaction,8 which grafted an organic canopy layer onto the surface of specially modified nanoparticles either electrostatically or covalently.1 Given their hybrid character, the physical and chemical properties of solvent-free nanoparticles can be tailored by varying geometric and chemical characteristics of the core and canopy as well as external parameters such as temperature, mechanical deformation, electric and magnetic fields, making them more appealing in the applications of lubricants, plasticizers, heat transfer, gas capture and more.4,9–11 Using these approaches, various nanoparticle fluids have been synthesized, including luminescent fluids such as CdSe, ZnO, CdTe, PbS, and CdSe/CdS/ZnS.12–17 Nevertheless, multi-step laboratory procedures, intrinsic toxicity, and potential environmental hazards of cadmium based quantum dots (QDs) have greatly hindered their potential applications.
The emerging multicolor luminescent carbon dots (CDs) appear to be a promising alternative to the conventional organic dyes, QDs and rare-earth based nanoparticles in terms of chemical inertness, eco-friendliness, and low cost.18–20 Typically, CDs are comprised of surface passivated graphite or amorphous carbon nanoparticles and exhibit size or excitation wavelength dependent photoluminescent (PL) behaviour.20 Since the serendipitous discovery in 2004,21 powdery CDs have been produced from all sorts of carbon precursors and used in a wide range of technologies.22–25
Herein, we report an alternative form of CDs which demonstrates liquid-like behavior in the absence of solvents at room temperature. Due to the fluidity of CD fluid (CDF), it could become an ideal inkjet printing material. Especially for the high concentrated ink which remains a major challenge currently, because in order to form a reliable droplet, the ink material has to meet parameters of viscosity, surface tension and stability.26,27 As expected, the CDF can be made into luminescent ink with a concentration as high as 60 wt% for a piezoelectric printer and 85 wt% for a thermal inkjet printer, and efficient emission is observed from the printed graphical art. In addition, we further successfully embed CDF in sol–gel derived organically modified silicate glass for potential applications of displays, solid state lighting, etc. The as prepared glass doped with 0.1 wt% CDF has 61% quantum yield under 360 nm excitation.
Moreover, effective up-conversion luminescence (UPL) is observed from the CDF. UPL is a well-known nonlinear optical process of converting low energy incident radiation into higher energy output radiation. In contrast to other converting processes based on second-harmonic generation or multi-photon absorption, UPL can be efficiently excited even at low excitation densities.28–30 On account of this, UPL nanoparticles show considerable promise for applications in areas of 3D luminescent displays, optical storage disks, optically written displays, and photovoltaic cells.30 Therefore, it is of great interest to incorporate the advantages of the flowing and UPL properties of CDF to address more novel applications.
2. Experimental methods
2.1 Materials
Citric acid anhydrous, tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), methyltriethoxysilane (MTES), and all other chemicals were purchased from Beijing Chemical Factory (Beijing, China) and used as received without further purification. Milli-Q water was used in all experiments.
2.2 Synthesis of CDF
10 mL TEPA was placed into a 100 mL three-necked flask and degassed with nitrogen for 5 min. When the temperature was raised to 240 °C, 0.5 g of citric acid anhydrous was quickly added into the solution with vigorous stirring. The mixture was then kept at the temperature for 3 min. The crude product was purified by dialyzing against Milli-Q water with a cellulose ester membrane bag (Mw = 3500) for 48 hours by changing the Milli-Q water approximately every 8 h, and then dried in a vacuum at 80 °C for 24 hours.
2.3 CDF doped silica glass
The materials were prepared by the hydrolysis and polycondensation of MTES in acidic medium (H2O, acetic acid or HCl, pH = 2.5) using a modified method reported in the literature.26 The molar ratio of MTES:ethanol:distilled water in the precursor was 3:1:3. The mixture was stirred overnight and evaporated to the initial volume of the MTES precursor. The mixture was stirred for 5–7 days. The ethanol solution of the CDF was added to the sol. After aging was finished, the gels were divided into several volume parts, cast into polypropylene cells individually, and dried for 1–2 days at room temperature to give the final glasses.
2.4 Characterization
Fluorescence spectra were recorded using an F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. For the upconversion luminescence, the Tsunami mode-locked Ti–Sapphire laser was used. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a UV-1601PC UV-visible spectrophotometer. The absolute quantum efficiency of the CDF was obtained using an integrating sphere connected to an Edinburgh FLSP920 instrument. To obtain infrared (IR) spectra, the sample was ground with KBr powder and the transmittance of each resulting pellet was measured using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer (Varian670, USA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM 2100F (JEOL, Japan) operating at 200 kV accelerating voltage. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D8 Focus (Bruker, Germany) diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα (λ = 0.15405 nm). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed on a Dynapro NanoStar (Wyatt, USA). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded using a MFP-3D Stand Alone Atomic Force Microscope (Asylum Research, USA). Confocal images of CDF were recorded using a Leica TCS SP5 by spin coating a dilute CDF ethanol solution on a clean glass coverslip. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA Q5000 V3.5 Build 252 in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) traces were recorded on a Q1000 TA instrument with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Rheological properties were studied using a rheometer (TA, ARES-RFS). Inject printing was performed on a conventional piezoelectric printer (EPSON Me1+) and a thermal inkjet printer HP Deskjet 1010; the printed images were irradiated with a SPITFIRE 800 nm laser.
3. Results and discussion
The CDF was prepared by a modified one-pot pyrolysis method31,32 using TEPA as a coordinating solvent and citric acid anhydrous as a carbon precursor. Experimentally, CDF was prepared by quickly injecting 0.5 g of anhydrous citric acid into 10 mL of TEPA at 240 °C. After dialyzing against Milli-Q water for 48 hours and subsequent removal of the water under vacuum at 80 °C, the final CDF was obtained. The synthesis process involves the decomposition and polymerization of anhydrous citric acid accompanied by the formation of gas and condensable vapor, along with the in situ surface grafting reaction of the amine groups of TEPA with the carboxyl groups driven by the pyrolyzed species.31 The acylation reaction can be confirmed by FTIR spectra (Fig. S1†), which show typical signals of νCONR vibration at 1658 cm−1 as well as νCON–HR vibration at 3296 cm−1. CDF was further characterized by XRD, which gives one broad reflection centered at 4.3 Å (Fig. S2†), indicating the amorphous nature.

Fig. 1A shows a TEM image of CDF, indicating that CDF is comprised of spherical nanoparticles of size around 10 nm without obvious aggregation. Further information obtained from the height image of AFM reveals that CDF can be well dispersed on the mica substrate with height in the range of 6–9 nm (Fig. 1B). The size distribution of CDF is also characterized by DLS (Fig. S3†), which shows that the average particle size of CDF in water is 11 nm, in line with the TEM and AFM results.

As demonstrated in Fig. 1C, CDF shows an obvious absorption feature centered at 366 nm in the UV-vis absorption spectrum. When excited in the range of 320–400 nm, the emission peaks locate at 500 nm and show a maximum intensity at λex = 400 nm, and on further increasing the excitation wavelength, the emission peak shifts to longer wavelength, exhibiting an excitation wavelength dependent emission property, similar to most of the luminescent CDs.20 In contrast, the absorption peak of CDF in water (Fig. S4†) is at 360 nm, and the luminescence spectra between 320 < λex < 400 nm show a maximum at 450 nm with the strongest intensity recorded at λex = 360 nm. The absolute quantum yield (excitation at 360 nm) of CDF in water is 17%, higher than that of the pure CDF (9%). When further increasing the excitation wavelength, the emission of CDF in water also shifts to longer wavelength and is accompanied by a remarkable photoluminescence intensity decrease. Compared with its water solution, the relative red shift of the absorption and emission of the pure CDF might be due to the energy transfer within an inhomogeneous distribution emitting species or re-absorption of the high-energy part of the emission in the optically dense nanostructures.33 The fluidity of CDF and light emission are depicted in Fig. 1D and E, which clearly show that CDF is a homogeneous viscous and deep yellow fluid at room temperature and can emit a bright cyanic color upon UV lamp excitation.
The exact photo-luminescence mechanism of the CDs remains elusive until now, however, two main suppositions have been utilized to explain the multi-emission phenomenon. One is size dominated emission, similar to the size-dependent quantum confinement effects of quantum dots.34,35 The other is the light emission from surface defects with various energy levels.36 In this study, we found that the crude CDs also have some smaller particles (1 nm) besides the 10 nm nanoparticles (Fig. S5A†); the smaller particles and the unreacted TEPA were out of the membrane after dialysis (Fig. S5B†). However, as shown in Fig. S6,† besides a less quantum efficiency, the absorption and emission features of the crude CDs and the outside particles are similar to the purified CDF. To further study the size effects, the purified CDF was characterized by fluorescence confocal microscopy. The concentration of diluted CDF solution was first tested by AFM until particles can spread on the mica substrate separately with a distance larger than 400 nm. The CDF solution was then dispersed onto the coverslip and scanned under different excitations. As shown in Fig. 2, under the excitation of 405 nm, 455 nm and 476 nm, diffraction-limited luminescent spots are overlapped, so we speculate that CDs might possess multi-luminescent centers. Hopefully this observation may provoke some ideas for the mechanism of CD luminescence.20

The UPL spectra of CDF are shown in Fig. 3A. In the excitation range of 700–840 nm, CDF exhibits almost identical emission peaks at 500 nm, similar to the emission excited in the range of 320–400 nm. The inset of Fig. 3A shows the typical UPL photograph of CDF under an excitation of 720 nm. Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of UPL, which include Auger recombination, two-photon absorption and thermally assisted surface-state processes. Usually the dependence of the UPL on the input photon power can generate some insights into the mechanism. As displayed in Fig. 3B, a fit of experimental data to a power function reveals that the exponent is equal to 1.06. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the UPL process is thermally aided because the two-photon absorption and Auger recombination are quadratic and cubic dependent on the excitation intensity, respectively.37,38

Fig. 4A shows the TGA trace of CDF. The slight weight loss before 120 °C is due to physisorbed water. While after that and up to 450 °C, the weight loss is around 85%, which reveals that CDF is organic in nature. This feature is highly important for endowing CDF with its liquid manner. DSC analysis shows that CDF (Fig. 4B) crystallizes at −40.3 °C and melts at −38.6 °C, similar to the melting point of TEPA (−40 °C), indicating that the grafting of TEPA is essential for the fluidity of CDF. Since CDs can be modified with a wide variety of commercially available organic materials, the fluidity could be tailored in a large scope.

The modulus of CDF at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 5A. It is clear that the loss modulus (G′′) is higher than the storage modulus (G′) throughout the measured temperature, which is characteristic of the liquid-like nature. As shown in Fig. 5B, the viscosity of CDF is 1.32 Pa s at room temperature, much higher than the reactant TEPA. However, with the increase of temperature to 85 °C, it quickly decreases to 0.04 Pa s. Additionally, the luminescence intensity of CDF is also sensitive to the temperature (Fig. S7†), suggesting that it is a promising alternative for nanoscale thermal sensing.39

Generally, for the fabrication and end-use of various devices such as displays, sensors, solar cells, flexible, and solid state lighting devices, it is desirable to pattern functional materials on a target substrate. In contrast to other deposited methods, drop-on demand inkjet printing technology, which reproduces digital images or characters according to designed templates using ink drops, is superior in its features of simpleness, speed, large area, and low material consumption.40–42 As a proof-of-concept experiment, CDF was made into luminescent inks with different concentrations and inkjet printed by a commercial piezoelectric printer, which leads to ejection of droplets through direct mechanical actuation of a piezoelectric transducer.41Fig. 6A shows the pattern printed using the CDF ink with 60 wt% concentration. It is hard to see the logo under normal light and even invisible at lower concentration (Fig. S8†), however, under the UV light a bright and distinct graph is observed (Fig. 6B). Considering the decreasing viscosity of CDF under heating, we further evaluated the CDF ink on a thermal inkjet printer, which forces the ejection of droplets by rapid heat transfer.27 As shown in Fig. S9,† CDF ink with concentration as high as 85 wt% was used, and the printed image can be clearly recognized under daylight. The printed image has good photo-stability. It still exhibits intense fluorescence after six months under daylight at room temperature (Fig. S8E†). When continuously exposing the image to a 36 W UV lamp for 10 hours, the fluorescence has no obvious decrease (Fig. S8F†).

As shown in Fig. 6C, the printed pattern exhibits obvious UPL under the irradiation of the 800 nm laser, suggesting that the CDF ink is an excellent choice for defining security features, while currently used UV-to-VIS down conversion fluorescent dyes are easy to be duplicated.43 It is worth noting that as the CDF ink is water soluble, so when using it for practical applications, we should select a substrate which has a strong interaction with CDF or use a layer of the film to prevent the leakage of CDF.
In an attempt to evaluate the performance of CDF in a solid state matrix, CDF doped organic silica glass was prepared. The organically modified silicate matrix is a good host material owing to the advantages of mechanical stability, facile preparation, thermal stability and designable microstructures. As shown in Fig. 7A, it is clear that the 0.1% CDF doped glass is transparent, without obvious agglomeration, phase separation and crack. Under the UV light, strong blue emission is observed, with absolute quantum yield up to 61%; the increase of the quantum yield in a rigid matrix is reasonable because the hydrogen bond and the cage-effect44 can reduce the molecular rotation and quenching. The loading fractions could be further increased to 15% (Fig. S10†), comparable to the in situ prepared CdSe QD-silica films. Furthermore, when excited with an 800 nm laser, bright UPL is observed by the naked eye in the daylight. All the above-mentioned results suggest that the CDF glasses could become alternative upconverting composites compared to the most commonly reported rare earth oxide or fluoride incorporated polymers or glass ceramics.45,46

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a fascinating class of CDs which can flow like liquid without solvent was synthesized. It can exhibit efficient luminescence under the UV, VIS and near infrared light excitation. In our preliminary evaluation, CDF is proved to be a good alternative for high concentration inkjet printing. The ink suspension is found to be stable for at least six months at room temperature. In addition, CDF can be further incorporated into organically modified silicate glass, and exhibit bright luminescence under both UV and near infrared light. Given the down and upconversion luminescence and flow ability, CDF would usher in a new era for its applications in the area of security, flexible and solid state optical and photonic devices.
