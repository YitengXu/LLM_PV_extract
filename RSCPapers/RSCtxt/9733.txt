    , Accepted 2nd December 2014First published on 2nd December 2014AbstractAqueous electrolyte Li-ion–polysulphide batteries offer great promise due to the use of low-cost and abundant raw materials. Following up on our previous studies in which we explored a totally new practical battery chemistry coupling a well-known cathode material in Li-ion batteries (i.e. LiMn2O4) with a dissolved polysulphide anode, herein we aim to further develop the system by replacing the ceramic membrane with an ion-selective polymer membrane, allowing cost-effective and higher energy density options. After tuning the osmotic movements inside the membrane, dissolved polysulphide leakage from one compartment to another is successfully eliminated. With the additional use of porous silica serving as an absorbent for sulphur-based gaseous products, a 1.5 V average voltage together with a stable cycling profile over 200 cycles at high current density regimes are easily achieved.
1. Introduction
Storage is one of the essential components of the forthcoming energy supply system to make use of renewable energy sources with fluctuating power output. Load-levelling systems to meet peak-power demands are highly important for grid operation. Therefore, the challenge is to develop new means of storage. Aside from hydroelectric storage, numerous storage technologies enlisting supercapacitors, electrochemical batteries, fly wheels, and compressed air do exist and cover a broad spectrum of the power output-energy storage domain.1 The rechargeable batteries are highly preferable among the various energy storage technologies due to their large-scale storage abilities, high energy conversion efficiencies and simple maintenance.2 To date, particularly, Li-ion batteries have been powering portable electronics as well as electrical vehicles (EVs). However, they still fall short for grid applications because of both their high costs and inherent safety issues related to the use of flammable organic electrolytes. Thus, the development of alternative low cost battery technologies is becoming essential. Aware of such a cost issue, scientists are exploring new strategies by focusing mainly on the electrolyte, which is the most costly component of today's Li-ion systems. An obvious solution could be to switch back to aqueous electrolytes.
Although the use of aqueous electrolytes in the field of Li-ion batteries dates back to 1994,3 the progress on improving their performances has been limited. One of the main reasons for these limitations is nested in the low thermodynamic stability of water, 1.23 V, which is too narrow to achieve high operational voltages. Luckily, slow kinetic secondary reactions can occasionally play in our favour as it does for the lead–acid batteries, which function at near ≈2.1 V, but this is still insufficient to compete with non-aqueous electrolytes.
To preserve high voltage utilisation, strategies aiming towards the development of two compartment cell configurations to enable the use of different electrolytes at the positive and negative electrode are presently explored. Along that line, an acidic–alkaline double electrolyte primary battery operating at a voltage approaching to 3.0 V has already been reported.4 Moreover, water soluble redox couples as the cathode (or so called catholyte) together with a metallic lithium functioning in a non-aqueous electrolyte as the anode were suggested as a new concept of alkali-ion batteries.5 Along that concept, Li–iodine batteries using a triiodide/iodide couple6 or Li–bromide batteries using Br2/Br− couples7 have already been reported. However, all these approaches require utilizing a high cost and fragile lithium ion conducting glass ceramic membrane, denoted as LIC-GC, made of a combination of Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2–P2O5–TiO2–GeO2, to separate the aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. Although elegant for conceptual demonstrations, such a heavy and brittle ionic conducting ceramic is still questionable for practical applications.
Turning to the Li–S technology, it is worthwhile mentioning that the use of an aqueous electrolyte was suggested more than two decades ago by Licht and co-workers8 and put in practice a few years later for polysulphide-based batteries as well as solar cells.9–12 In 2013, Visco et al. developed a high performance rechargeable Li–S battery using Li2S in an aqueous cathode.13 A still remaining down side, cost-wise, of their approach is rooted in the use of a two compartment cell having a ceramic conducting membrane to separate the aqueous and non-aqueous electrolyte.
Recently, our group demonstrated for the first time an aqueous electrolyte Li-ion–polysulphide battery coupling a well-known cathode material (LiMn2O4) with dissolved polysulphides as the anode (so called anolyte). The cell shows an output voltage of ∼1.5 V with sustained capacities of ∼110 mA h g−1 at C/2 rate for more than 100 cycles, resulting almost 80 Wh kg−1 energy densities, which could compete with those of NiMH or Pd–acid aqueous electrolyte rechargeable batteries.14 Additionally the solubility of active sulphur can reach up to 12 M,13 allowing much higher energy densities. However, the cell still used a glass ceramic membrane.14 Searching further for cost reduction, an obvious implementation was to replace the ceramic membrane. Herein, we report a Li-ion–polysulphide battery using an ion-selective polymer membrane, namely a perfluorosulfonate ionomer (Nafion), rather than a ceramic membrane as separator.15 In the field of batteries, Nafion has already been used as (i) a proton conducting membrane for fuel cells,15 (ii) a binder for alloy negative electrodes in Li-ion batteries,16 (iii) a covering substance for carbon–sulphur composite electrode in order to trap dissolved polysulphides within the composite,17 and (iv) to obtain a functional separator either for Li–S18 or room temperature Na–S19 batteries because of its effectiveness in reducing polysulphide dissolution. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, Nafion has never been used in the field of aqueous electrolyte lithium batteries. Using such a modification we could assemble a less costly Li-ion–polysulphide showing better performances than ceramic-based cells in terms of cycle life and rate capability.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and electrode preparations
LiMn2O4, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich. The working electrode (WE) for CV measurement was prepared by mixing LiMn2O4 powders with Ketjen-black carbon and an organic binder (PVDF), in a weight ratio of 80:10:10 in NMP. After stirring, the mixture was casted on a stainless steel electrode and then dried at 100 °C for 5 h.
The aqueous polysulphide solutions were made by mixing various amounts potassium (poly)sulphide (>42% K2S) powders (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte.
A Swagelok-type hardware was used to assemble the cells. The positive electrode was made from a LiMn2O4 containing slurry (as described above), which was casted on a stainless steel disk electrode and dried at 100 °C for 5 h. The electrode area was 0.9 cm2, and the weight of active material was typically in the range of 2–3 mg for each sample. A 0.15 mL aqueous polysulphide solution together with 5 mg Ketjen black carbon powder as a conductive additive was used as the counter electrode (CE). Last, a 25.4 μm-thick NAFION® Membrane NR-211, supplied from Ion Power Inc., was used as the separator.
2.2. Electrochemistry
All potentials are reported, if not specified otherwise, versus the standard calomel electrode (SCE). The electrochemical characterization was realized using a VMP-3 instrument from Biologic performed in both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic cycling modes with potential limitation (GCPL). CV measurements were performed with a 3-electrode cell configuration using a 2.5 M or 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. A scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 over 0.4–1.2 V vs. SCE was applied for LiMn2O4. For the dissolved polysulphide the CV test was done at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 over −1.0 to 0.3 V (vs. SCE). In both cases, carbon coated stainless steel was used as the CE and SCE as the reference electrode.
For the full cell configuration, experiments were carried out using two-electrode Swagelok-type cells. The electrolyte consisted of a solution of 0.5 M or 2.5 M of Li2SO4 in water. The cells were tested in the 0.2 to 1.6 V voltage range with a current density of 2 C or 10 C. In general, the cells were assembled with an excess of polysulphide to compensate for the eventual elimination of gaseous active material. Based on the theoretical capacity value of LiMn2O4 and dissolved polysulphide, the anolyte to cathode weight ratio was usually taken as 2.5. Lastly, and only when specified, 5 mg SBA-15, synthesized according to the method described in ref. 20, was mixed with 5 mg Ketjen black carbon and placed at the polysulphide side.
2.3. Characterizations
Cycling experiments coupled with mass spectrometer measurements were carried out galvanostatically at room temperature with a cycling current density of 2 C. The gases were measured using a mass spectrometer (Netzsch QMS 403 Aeolos) operating under primary vacuum. Gaseous product signals were recorded prior to cycling the cell and after 30 cycles.
The BET surface area and pore volume of the SBA-15 were evaluated by nitrogen sorption at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP2020 apparatus. The sample was degassed at 150 °C for 6 h prior to measurement.
Microstructural analyses were done using a transmission electron microscope (TEM-FEI TECNAI F20 S-TWIN) fitted with a scanning mode and both high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector and EDAX EDS.
3. Results and discussions
Prior to assembling a full cell configuration, membrane leakage and polysulphide diffusion tests were performed. To do so, a known amount of polysulphide (∼1.5 M) was dissolved in an aqueous electrolyte and placed in a glass vial covered with a Nafion membrane. Then, the well tightened polysulphide containing vials were dipped into aqueous electrolytes with salt concentrations varying as shown in Fig. 1. We initially checked the effect of having different salt concentrations on each side of the Nafion membrane by first dissolving 1.5 M polysulfide in a 2.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 1a) and in a 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 1b), both being dipped into a 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. As expected, due to the repulsive interaction between the negatively charged membranes (SO3− groups) and negatively charged polysulphides, we did not observe any leakage of the polysulphides for at least one day. Nevertheless, during that waiting time there was an increase of the water level in the polysulfide containing compartment due to water displacement. This contrasted with the samples left for 3 days, for which there was a clear appearance of yellowish colour, indicative of the diffusion of polysulphide through the Nafion membrane. Such diffusion was faster for the larger salt concentration gradient between the two compartments (Fig. 1a). Similar tests were repeated when the salt concentration between both compartments was kept close to equilibrium (Fig. 1c), and in this case, we could not see any polysulphide diffusion through the membrane even after 5 months of rest. In brief, these simple experiments remind us of the osmotic pressure phenomenon and increase our awareness about carefully tuning the concentration gradient across the membrane when assembling the full cell to prevent polysulphide diffusion, with the lowest concentration gradient being the most suitable solution.
 Fig. 1  Nafion membrane polysulphide leakage test with different salt concentrations after variable resting times. (a) 1.5 M polysulphide dissolved in a 2.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and then placed in 0.5 M Li2SO4 in water, (b) 1.5 M polysulphide dissolved in a 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and then placed in 0.5 M Li2SO4 in water, (c) 1.5 M polysulphide dissolved in a 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and then placed in 2.5 M Li2SO4 in water. Note: only in the case of (c) were the inside and outside salt concentrations close to equilibrium, resulting in no leakage up to 5 months. 
We next implemented the aforementioned conditions for assembling two cells having salts concentrations in equilibrium across the Nafion membrane (conditions of Fig. 1c) and in non-equilibrium (conditions of Fig. 1b). Both cells (Fig. 2a) showed similar capacities for the first cycle, but rapidly differed with a sharp capacity decay for the cell having a non-equilibrated salt concentration (red dots) prior to being stabilized after 10 cycles as opposed to a smooth capacity increase for the cell having an equilibrated concentration (black dots). The capacity fading is much drastic (bearing in mind that a complete cycle takes less than one hour) compared to the leakage test results, which did not reveal any diffusion of polysulfide species through the membrane for at least one day (Fig. 1). One possible reason is nested in the presence of an electrical field through the membrane, which could enhance the migration of polysulphides towards the LiMn2O4 side, hence decreasing the concentration difference between both sides and explaining why the capacity stabilizes after 10 cycles. The better cycling performances (black dots) measured for the cell with equilibrium concentration is reminiscent of a properly functioning Nafion membrane, as it is permeable to lithium ions and impermeable to polysulphide species.
 Fig. 2  (a) Cycling performance of the aqueous electrolyte LiMn2O4–polysulphide cells at a 2 C current density. Capacity values refer to LiMn2O4, whose theoretical capacity is 148 mA h g−1. Cell configuration at the black dots is 2.5 M Li2SO4 at the LiMn2O4 cathode side and 0.5 M Li2SO4 containing polysulphide (1.5 M) at the anode side. Cell configuration at the red dots is 0.5 M Li2SO4 at the LiMn2O4 cathode side and 0.5 M Li2SO4 containing polysulphide (1.5 M) at the anode side. Note: cells were not balanced and excess polysulphide was used here to compensate for the elimination of gaseous active material in the cell, meaning that considering the theoretical capacity value of LiMn2O4 and dissolved polysulphide, the ratio between the cathode and anolyte is kept at 2.5. (b) Third galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the LiMn2O4–polysulphide full cells with different electrolyte configurations at a current density of 2 C for the voltage range between 0.2 and 1.6 V. 
The electrochemical activity of LiMn2O4 and polysulphide electrodes in 0.5 M Li2SO4 containing aqueous electrolyte were confirmed by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies (Fig. S1†). The two reversible redox peaks, reminiscent of the Li insertion–deinsertion processes in LiMn2O4 are clearly seen at 0.68/0.82 and 0.76/0.90 V (vs. SCE) on reduction and oxidation, respectively.21,22 For the dissolved polysulphide solution, a single redox couple whose peak appeared at −0.3/−0.8 V (vs. SCE) was detected in agreement with former studies.9,23 When the two electrodes operated in tandem in electrochemical cells (Fig. 2b), an average output voltage of nearly 1.5 V was measured. These cells delivered 110 mA h g−1 or 60 mA h g−1, capacities at a 2 C (Fig. 2a) or at 10 C rate (Fig. S2†), respectively, with excellent capacity retention. The reported capacity values herein correspond to LiMn2O4, whose theoretical capacity is 148 mA h g−1; thus, the capacity utilization is around 80% (at 2 C). The reason for such limitation comes from the use of a non-electrochemically optimized LiMn2O4 sample. We believe enhanced performances can be achieved with an optimised cathode material made by either with dual Al–F doping24 or templating approaches.25
Obviously, the cell voltage for this aqueous system (1.5 V) is lower than that for classical Li–S batteries (2.2 V). Nevertheless, considering the lower initial cost (aqueous vs. organic electrolyte), ability to operate at superior current densities and anomalously high solubility of polysulphide salts in water (Li2S is not soluble in organics), the aqueous Li-ion–polysulphide battery is a potential candidate to power stationary applications. Therefore, for this to happen, one must master the amount of gaseous product produced during cycling, which is linked mainly to the polysulfide anolyte.13,14
As discussed in our former study,14 the electrochemical performance of sulphur (or its reduced polysulphide species) in aqueous media bears no similarities with the organic electrolyte counterparts as no reversible colour changes upon reduction/oxidation are observed. Instead, in aqueous electrolytes, the colour transforms from orange to greenish, and even disappears if the cells are not properly sealed,14 meaning that active material is prone to leave the cell via the formation of gaseous products. From the redox chemistry of polysulphides in aqueous media, three main chemical species are known to be formed, HS−, Sx2− and H2S (aq).8,9,26 Thus, an over-simplified reaction mechanism can be written as in (eqn (1)). S22− + 2H2O + 2e− ↔ 2HS− + 2OH−Eo = −0.51 V vs. SHE(1)
In light of this remark, we avoid giving specific values for the theoretical capacity of our system as it will be highly depend on many parameters among which are the types of polysulphides, amount of conductive additives, pH, type of the cell compartment, etc. Nevertheless, considering the use of K2S at pH 14, we expect to have a specific capacity ranging from 240–480 mA h g−1.
Turning to side reactions, according to eqn (1), gaseous products form and they seep from the cell depending on its configuration. Fig. 3a shows the capacity behaviour of a cell whose balancing is performed by taking into account the capacities of both polysulphide and LiMn2O4. As previously shown at Fig. 2a, a capacity of ∼105 mA h g−1 is obtained for the first cycle but here the cell was dead after 60 cycles. Upon opening the cell, we noted that the characteristic colour of dissolved polysulphide was transformed from yellowish (Fig. 3a, inset picture) to a colourless/transparent solution (Fig. 3b, inset picture). When the same cell was restarted with additional polysulphide, there was an upgrade of its capacity from ∼10 mA h g−1 to ∼80 mA h g−1, which was followed by a smooth and continuous capacity decrease. The lost in capacity (from ∼105 to ∼80 mA h g−1) between the two events is indicative of the loss of an active material during cycling. With respect to practicality, for large scale applications, this means that such an aqueous battery system will need to be coupled with a tank accommodating a large volume of dissolved polysulphide, so that the system as a whole can be viewed as an intermittent semi-redox flow set-up.5
 Fig. 3  (a) Cycling performance of the aqueous electrolyte LiMn2O4–polysulphide cell at a 2 C current density. Cell balancing is done considering the theoretical capacity value of LiMn2O4 and dissolved polysulphide. Capacity values refer to LiMn2O4, whose theoretical capacity is 148 mA h g−1. Cell configuration is 2.5 M Li2SO4 at the LiMn2O4 cathode side and 0.5 M Li2SO4 containing polysulphide at the anode side. (b) Cycling performance of the same cell (a) when it was restarted with additional polysulphide at a 2 C current density. 
To understand the nature of the side products generated upon cycling, a home-made Swagelok cell connected to a mass spectrometer was used. During such an in situ cycling experiment, the released gaseous reaction products were continuously pumped off from the top of the cell through a capillary into the mass spectrometer and analysed/quantified on-line by detecting changes in mass signals as a function of time. The evolution of the gaseous products between the 1st and 30th cycles is shown in Fig. S3.† The amount of O2 released increases upon cycling, but to our surprise, the difference in the amount of released sulphur based gaseous products between the 1st and 30th cycles was barely detectable, as exemplified by the slight change in the H2S (molecular weight: 34 g mol−1) signal (Fig. S3†). This could suggest that the formed corrosive H2S is consumed during cycling, which is supported by visual observation of corrosion pits at the surface of our stainless-steel current collector. Regarding corrosion, besides H2S, one could also consider the role of Li2SO4 salt, which is proven to cause corrosion on the stainless steel electrode at the electrochemical capacitors in aqueous electrolytes.27
Regenerative adsorption and removal of H2S is part of many industrial processes, and this is mainly done via the use rare earth oxides,28 activated carbons29 or porous silica.30 Moreover, in the field of Li–S battery, oxygenated porous architectures have already been proposed to trap dissolved polysulphides31,32 due to its Si–O binding sides. Thus, in light of this previous article, we decided to use porous silica additives in order to adsorb sulphur-based products. Here we used a SBA-15 mesoporous silica20 with a bi-connected porous structure and highly hydrophilic surface properties. It exhibits a high surface area, 740 m2 g−1, (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) with a very narrow pore size distribution centred at 8.8 nm and a specific pore volume of 0.95 cm3 g−1 (Fig. S4†). HRTEM images (Fig. S5†) reveal that SBA-15 silica comprises well-ordered hexagonal arrays of mesopores (1D channel) and a 2D hexagonal structure.
Electrochemical cycling experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of the SBA-15 additive. Fig. 4a shows the 3rd galvanostatic discharge–charge profiles recorded at a current rate of 2 C with and without SBA-15 additives. The irreversible capacity for the cell containing SBA-15 is the lowest, and this is most likely due to the great aptitude of SBA-15 silica to trapped H2S. Moreover, the addition of SBA-15 (Fig. 4b) enables achievement of a better capacity retention performance as a sustained capacity retention of 90 mA h g−1 at 2 C up to 200 cycles could be achieved. Without SBA-15 we have a smooth increase in capacity up to 50 cycles follow by a severe downturn afterwards. This smooth increase is reminiscent of a time-dependence electroactivation process, which could here be due to the time required to establish a good interaction between the hydrophobic carbon and aqueous polysulfide. Lastly, other oxides, besides SBA-115, with a great affinity towards sulphur, including Ti4O7 as recently reported,33 could also enhance the cell performances.

Capacity values refer to LiMn2O4, whose theoretical capacity is 148 mA h g−1. Cell configuration in both cases is 2.5 M Li2SO4 at the LiMn2O4 cathode side and 0.5 M Li2SO4 containing polysulphide (1.5 M) at the anode side. 
4. Conclusions
Considering the low cost and long cycle life requirements for large-scale storage, aqueous-based batteries are attractive. Herein, we have demonstrated the feasibility and proof of concept of an aqueous electrolyte polysulphide system utilizing a renowned cathode material, LiMn2O4, together with dissolved polysulphide (anolyte) and a Nafion-based membrane as a separator. We show that such a 1.5 V battery system, free of costly and brittle ceramic membranes, holds promise for constructing a long-lifespan storage device. Side issues such as the release of gaseous products (H2S) were partially overcome via the use of porous SBA-15 silica adsorbent. Sustained reversible capacities of 90 mA h g−1 at a 2 C rate for more than 200 cycles were already achieved. Although we have established proof-of-concept with Nafion, obvious improvements of this work range from exploring other cationic polymer membranes besides Nafion as well as other oxides besides SBA-15 for H2S trapping. Plus, implementation of our general approach in Na-based systems will present much more cost effective options.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Nafion membrane polysulphide leakage test with different salt concentrations after variable resting times. (a) 1.5 M polysulphide dissolved in a 2.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and then placed in 0.5 M Li2SO4 in water, (b) 1.5 M polysulphide dissolved in a 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and then placed in 0.5 M Li2SO4 in water, (c) 1.5 M polysulphide dissolved in a 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and then placed in 2.5 M Li2SO4 in water. Note: only in the case of (c) were the inside and outside salt concentrations close to equilibrium, resulting in no leakage up to 5 months.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Cycling performance of the aqueous electrolyte LiMn2O4–polysulphide cells at a 2 C current density. Capacity values refer to LiMn2O4, whose theoretical capacity is 148 mA h g−1. Cell configuration at the black dots is 2.5 M Li2SO4 at the LiMn2O4 cathode side and 0.5 M Li2SO4 containing polysulphide (1.5 M) at the anode side. Cell configuration at the red dots is 0.5 M Li2SO4 at the LiMn2O4 cathode side and 0.5 M Li2SO4 containing polysulphide (1.5 M) at the anode side. Note: cells were not balanced and excess polysulphide was used here to compensate for the elimination of gaseous active material in the cell, meaning that considering the theoretical capacity value of LiMn2O4 and dissolved polysulphide, the ratio between the cathode and anolyte is kept at 2.5. (b) Third galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the LiMn2O4–polysulphide full cells with different electrolyte configurations at a current density of 2 C for the voltage range between 0.2 and 1.6 V.	 
S22− + 2H2O + 2e− ↔ 2HS− + 2OH−Eo = −0.51 V vs. SHE	(1)

 	Fig. 3  (a) Cycling performance of the aqueous electrolyte LiMn2O4–polysulphide cell at a 2 C current density. Cell balancing is done considering the theoretical capacity value of LiMn2O4 and dissolved polysulphide. Capacity values refer to LiMn2O4, whose theoretical capacity is 148 mA h g−1. Cell configuration is 2.5 M Li2SO4 at the LiMn2O4 cathode side and 0.5 M Li2SO4 containing polysulphide at the anode side. (b) Cycling performance of the same cell (a) when it was restarted with additional polysulphide at a 2 C current density.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Third galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the LiMn2O4–polysulphide full cells with (red) and without (black) SBA-15 additive at a current density of 2 C for the voltage range between 0.2 and 1.6 V, and (b) comparison of the cycling stability of the aqueous electrolyte LiMn2O4–polysulphide cells with (red) and without (black) SBA-15 additive at a 2 C current density. Capacity values refer to LiMn2O4, whose theoretical capacity is 148 mA h g−1. Cell configuration in both cases is 2.5 M Li2SO4 at the LiMn2O4 cathode side and 0.5 M Li2SO4 containing polysulphide (1.5 M) at the anode side.
