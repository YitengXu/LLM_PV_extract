    , Accepted 29th December 2013First published on 6th January 2014AbstractAn inorganic layer and dye molecules have synergistically suppressed the recombination in a quantum dot sensitized solar cell (QDSSC), by the design of a structure featured TiO2–CdS–ZnS–N3 (N3: RuL2(NCS)2 (L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)) hybrid photoanode. When fabricated into solar cells, a cobalt complex-based electrolyte rather than an iodine-based one was employed to obtain an impressive photostability for the devices. Raman and Photoluminescence (PL) measurements revealed that not only the CdS QDs were passivated by both the inorganic layer of ZnS and dye molecule of N3, but also N3 served as an efficient hole scavenger for the CdS QDs due to a type-II energetic alignment between the two sensitizers. This role of N3 as an intermediary in hole extraction from CdS QDs to the electrolyte was further proven by the significant photovoltaic performance improvement of the CdS sensitized solar cell after ZnS deposition and N3 co-sensitization. The overall efficiency of the solar cell incorporated with TiO2–CdS–ZnS–N3 film exceeded the sum of the single CdS QDs and N3 dye sensitized solar cells. This enhancement is ascribed mainly to the synergistic recombination suppression by the inorganic layer ZnS and N3 co-sensitization, leading to inhibited recombination and increased electron lifetime, as illustrated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis.
Introduction
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have drawn much attention in recent years due to their specific advantages, such as an easily tunable energy gap, broadband optical absorption, high extinction coefficients,1,2 a large intrinsic dipole moment facilitating rapid charge separation, and potentially high stability and resistivity against oxygen and water. Various QDs such as CdS,3–8 CdSe,9–11 CdTe,12 CdTe/CdSe,13 PbS,14 and Ag2S15 have been widely investigated and have successfully served as sensitizers instead of dye molecules. CdS, whose bulk conduction band (CB) edge lies above that of TiO2 which is propitious to the injection of excited electrons from CdS into TiO2, is a common choice for a QD absorber. Having been developed extremely quickly and outstandingly, the efficiency of QDSSCs still lags behind that of dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs), for which the prominent issue is that the internal recombination is typically very significant for QDSSCs.16 A possible strategy to reduce the internal recombination, as proposed in previous works,16,17 could be to introduce a fast hole scavenger, such as a Ru dye. Bisquert and co-workers18–20 have done extensive research on the charge transfer mechanism between QDs and dye molecules and proved the feasibility and advantages of this hybrid system of assembling QDs and dyes together. It is worth noting that charge separation was made favourable between the two sensitizers by constructing a type-II band alignment featuring the occupied and unoccupied electronic states descending from the molecular dye via the QD to the TiO2, thus the recombination could be effectively inhibited.21 In Zaban's work,22 a thin layer of amorphous TiO2 was inserted between the QDs and dye molecules serving as a QDs stabilizer, enabling the iodine-based electrolyte to be a feasible one and improving the full cell conversion efficiency from 0.57% for CdS sensitization alone to 1.51% for the co-sensitized structure. Recently, Yuan and co-workers23 have employed atomic layer deposition method to build a TiO2 interfacial layer between QDs and the dye, which enhanced the performance significantly from 1.67% to 2.36%.
In our previous work,24 a sandwich-structure of TiO2–CdS–ZnS–N719 (N719: [RuL2(NCS)2]:2TBA(L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid; TBA = tetra-n-butylammonium)) was designed by using a wide band gap semiconductor (ZnS) as an interlayer between QDs and the dye, for which an impressive efficiency of 4.4% was obtained. It was deemed that ZnS, deposited both on the surface of CdS QD and the vacant TiO2 surface uncovered by QDs, was promising in prohibiting two possible recombination pathways of electrons from TiO2 or CdS QDs to the electrolyte redox species. However, the recombination restraining effects caused by the inorganic layer (ZnS) in our system coupled with the impact imposed by the dye co-sensitization in all the literature hasn't been systematically investigated. Besides, in QD–dye co-sensitized system it is necessary to select an appropriate electrolyte redox couple which is both efficient and non-corrosive for both sensitizers.25 This is a difficult task, due to the drastic chemical divergence of QDs and dyes. When using an iodine-based electrolyte, though the co-sensitized structure with an inorganic interlayer exhibited much better photostability than a CdS only sensitized solar cell, the stability lasts no longer than 600 s, as was disclosed in our previous work.24 To resolve this problem, here the cobalt based complex26,27 as one of the most promising electrolyte species, was used in the system of a similar hybrid structure of TiO2–CdS–ZnS–N3 (N3: RuL2(NCS)2 (L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)). Raman and Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were employed to investigate the charge separation between the CdS QDs and N3 molecules, which was further validated by the photovoltaic performances. Importantly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was employed to determine how the inorganic layer and organic molecule synergistically affected the electron behaviour, particularly electron recombination and electron lifetime. Additionally the short circuit current density as a function of time using periodic illumination intervals was employed to evaluate the photostability of the devices.
Experimental
Hybrid photoelectrode preparation
The four-layer structure TiO2 mesoscopic film was screen-printed on the F-doped SnO2-coated glass (FTO glass) substrate serving as a photoanode. The active area was 0.16 cm2. The thickness of the TiO2 film was about 14 μm measured using high-resolution surface profiler (XP-1, AMBIOS, USA). The CdS quantum dot sensitized TiO2 film was prepared by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) methods. The TiO2-loaded substrates were alternately dipped into an ethanol solution of Cd(NO3)2 (0.5 M) and a methanol solution of Na2S (0.5 M) for 5 min each.28 Before being dipped into each solution, the electrodes should be washed with pure methanol. The above procedure is named one cycle and was repeated 4 times. ZnS deposition was carried out by dipping the CdS-sensitized TiO2 thin film into an aqueous solution of Zn (NO3)2 (0.5 M) for 1 min, washing with deionized water thoroughly, dipping again into a methanol solution of Na2S (0.5 M) for 1 min and at last washing with methanol.29 ZnS(1) and ZnS(2) referred to one cycle and two cycles of ZnS deposition. For N3 co-sensitization, the as-prepared film was immersed into an ethanol solution of N3 (5 × 10−4 M) for about 24 h.
Device fabrication
The cobalt complex-based electrolyte consisted of 0.3 M Co(o-phen)3(TFSI)2 (o-phen = 1, 10-phenanthroline, TFSI = bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), 0.1 M NOBF4, 0.5 M 4-tertpyridine (TBP), and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile.30 Co(o-phen)3(TFSI)2 was synthesized according to the literature as follows. A solution of CoCl2 (0.25 g, 1.05 mmol) in water is added drop wise to a methanolic solution of (3.15 mmol) ligand o-phen. Then LiTFSI (0.80 g) in 10 ml water was added into this solution, which immediately formed the precipitate and was filtered. The precipitate was then washed with water and dried under vacuum to obtain Co(o-phen)3(TFSI)2. The counter electrode was prepared by sputtering platinum onto the FTO glass for 20 seconds, and incorporated into a device together with the respective hybrid photoanode using a 20 μm thick Surlyn hot-melt ring (DuPont, USA).
Characterization methods
Raman and PL spectroscopy were carried out by the equipment (HORIBA JOBIN YVON HR800, France) to measure the optical and vibrational properties of various photoanodes. Raman was measured using the laser of 488 nm, while PL was measured using a 325 nm laser with an excitation power of about 20 mW. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained from JEOL 2011 (JEOL, Japan). The photovoltaic performances of the devices were measured with a solar simulator (91192, Oriel, USA), under illumination of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2). The IPCE spectra were measured by IPCE measurement system (PEC-S20, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Japan) with a standard silicon solar cell (Si PDS1337-1010BQ, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd) as reference. Impedance measurements were performed using a CHI650C Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China). The frequency range was 0.05–100000 Hz, and the magnitude of the modulation signal was 5 mV. The spectra were fitted by Z-View software (v2.9c, Scribner Associates Inc.) in terms of appropriate equivalent circuits.
Results and discussion
Comparisons of TEM images between the pure TiO2 nanoparticles and the CdS sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1. The pure TiO2 nanoparticles are of a relatively uniform size of about 20–30 nm with quite smooth surfaces, while the surface of the CdS sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles is rough, and non-uniform in size, indicating that CdS QDs were deposited on the surface of TiO2 (Fig. 1(b)). In the HRTEM image (Fig. 1(c)), the white circles indicate the CdS QDs, for which the average size is no more than 5 nm.

Raman and PL characterization of the various devices was executed to investigate the charge separation between the CdS QDs and N3 molecule, which are shown in Fig. 2. We can identify from the Raman spectra the intense Eg Raman mode of anatase TiO2 at 142 cm−1 and the resonantly excited longitudinal optical (LO) phonon of CdS QDs at 305 cm−1 for all the QD sensitized photoanodes.31 As seen in Fig. 2(b), the rest of the Raman peaks (1270 cm−1, 1480 cm−1, 1540 cm−1, 1615 cm−1) between 1200 cm−1 and 2000 cm−1 were brought in by the N3 co-sensitization.18,24 It has been confirmed that dye molecules were both adsorbed on the vacant places of the TiO2 surface uncovered by QDs and on the surface of the QDs.24

(ZnS(1) and ZnS(2) referred to one and two deposition cycles respectively, with details described in the Experimental section.) 
In the PL spectra, all CdS QD/TiO2 samples exhibited sharp peaks stemming from the band-edge emission of CdS QDs (Fig. 2c). In CdS QD only sensitized electrodes, the PL peaks were obviously enhanced by employing ZnS as an intermediate layer with enlarged luminescent quantum yields, since the nonradiative recombination and deep trap emission was inhibited by passivation of the vacancies and trap sites on the CdS QD surface. Meanwhile, when fabricated into a solar cell, another possible recombination channel between photo-injected electrons in the TiO2 film with the electrolyte redox species was expected to be inhibited, which would be further proved by the photovoltaic performances and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of the devices. More importantly, an evident reduction of the QD emission intensity by N3 dye co-sensitization was observed. As reported in the QD–dye hybrid system, three different basic arrangements of the energetic levels between the two sensitizers and TiO2 are generally possible, leading to different charge separation efficiencies.18 Since the CdS–N3 co-sensitized electrodes exhibited type-II alignment with the occupied and unoccupied electronic states descending from the molecular dye via the CdS QD to the TiO2, N3 could serve as a regenerating agent of the CdS QDs with fast photoinduced hole transfer from QDs to the dye molecules rather than directly to the electrolyte redox species.19,24 This serves as evidence that employing composite heterostructures consisting of QDs and molecular dyes, with thoroughly different electron transfer mechanisms, is a promising alternative to the conventional configuration of QD-sensitized solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells. Furthermore, even in the presence of a ZnS deposition between the two sensitizers, a strong photoinduced charge transfer was possible, revealing that ZnS deposition should be an efficient method to enhance photovoltaic performances since it dramatically improved surface passivation without damaging the photoinduced charge transfer.
The above two speculations were further verified by the J–V and incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the fabricated devices with various electrodes, as shown in Fig. 3. The photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and overall energy conversion efficiency (η) are listed in Table 1, which shows clearly that the ZnS blocking layer improved the performance of the CdS QD sensitized solar cell. Generally, the recombination from the CdS QDs to the electrolyte redox species probably constituted a vital electron loss pathway, ascribed to the presence of surface states in the QDs acting as recombination centers.32 Another pathway is the direct electron recombination from TiO2 to electrolyte redox species due to the low surface coverage by the CdS QDs.16 Deposition of a ZnS blocking layer gave rise to considerable enhancement in both Jsc and Voc in the CdS-sensitized solar cells, demonstrating effective suppression of charge recombination from either the TiO2 or CdS quantum dots to the electrolyte redox species. This has also confirmed the ZnS passivation effects revealed in the PL tests. When repeating the ZnS SILAR cycle twice, both Jsc and FF were further improved, yielding an efficiency improved by two-fold.

Furthermore, dye molecule N3 deposition to form a newly proposed TiO2–CdS–N3 hybrid photoanode resulted in an obvious enlargement in photovoltaic performance compared with each single sensitizer, larger even than the sum of them. The CdS–N3 sensitized solar cell exhibited a Jsc of 2.58 mA cm−2, Voc of 690 mV, FF of 0.55, and η of 0.98%. To analyze the N3 sensitizer's contribution to the photovoltaic performance, a TiO2 photoanode stained by N3 alone for 24 h was incorporated into a solar cell. This device showed a Jsc of 1.84 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of only 0.58%. Meanwhile, ZnS insertion between CdS and N3 further improved the device performance (Jsc by 45% and η by 50%), leading to an efficiency of 1.48% under 1 sun illumination. Despite the higher CB edge position of ZnS relative to both that of the CdS QDs and the LUMO level of N3, it serves as an effective blocker of charge recombination from QDs to the electrolytes rather than an undesired barrier of electron injection from N3 to TiO2 when it is thin enough. To further improve the photovoltaic performance, new dyes (such as porphyrin dyes) which are more compatible with cobalt complex-based electrolytes to match the QDs should be chosen, which is underway in our lab.26,33
The IPCE is given by eqn (1): IPCE = LHE × ηinj × ηc(1)where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency at a given wavelength, ηinj is the electron injection efficiency, and ηc is the charge collection efficiency. As seen in Fig. 3(b), for CdS-sensitized solar cells, the IPCE values were progressively enlarged with increased ZnS deposition times, which was in good agreement with the trend in Jsc values. After N3 co-sensitization, the IPCE values were further increased across the entire spectra. In the wavelength ranging from about 550–700 nm, the obviously enhanced IPCE was the result of N3 co-sensitization, and under the shorter wavelength the higher IPCE was the result of both CdS and N3. ZnS deposition also induced improved IPCE values in the CdS–N3 co-sensitized solar cell.
To further analyze the underlying mechanism of how N3 and the ZnS passivated the CdS QDs surface and to highlight the origin of the dramatic increase of photocurrent and efficiency after different surface treatments (ZnS coating and N3 co-sensitization), EIS was employed and is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) in the forms of both Nyquist and Bode plots. These spectra were then fitted to give parameters including chemical capacitance (Cμ), recombination resistance (Rct), and electron lifetime (τ), which are plotted versus bias voltages (see Fig. 4).

Chemical capacitance (Cμ) manifests the amount of the surface states or the conduction band position of TiO2,34,35 which could be expressed as eqn (2): (2)where α is a constant related to the distribution of electronic states below the conduction band, Ecb is the energy level of the conduction band, and EFn is the position of the Fermi level of electrons. As was shown in Fig. 4(a), Cμ was enhanced by ZnS coating, which was regarded to indicate a displacement towards the negative direction of the TiO2 CB (vs. vacuum).36 This shift of the TiO2 CB would actually affect the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells, with probably increased Jsc values thanks to a higher electron injection driving force, and meanwhile a decreased Voc is due to a reduction of the difference between the TiO2 Fermi level and redox potential. However, it can be found in Table 1 that the Voc increased by 50 mV from 313 mV (CdS–ZnS(1)) to 365 mV (CdS–ZnS(2)) rather than decreased. This should be induced by the inhibited recombination and thus improved Jsc, which will be analyzed in detail below. Besides, further N3 deposition on the CdS sensitized films on the whole induced a decrease of Cμ and thus a positive shift of the TiO2 CB (vs. vacuum), which was ascribed to an increase of electron concentration leading to more positive Fermi levels (vs. vacuum).37

R
ct represents the interfacial charge recombination resistance between TiO2 and the electrolyte, keeping to an exponential behavior expressed as eqn (3):36 (3)where β and R0 are two constants, EFn − Eredox = eV where EFn is the Fermi level of the TiO2 film, e is the electron charge and V is the applied potential at the electrode, and Eredox is the energy of the redox couple. Generally, a larger Rct represents a smaller recombination rate. It was found (in Fig. 4(b)) that ZnS deposition has caused an enhancement of Rct as expected, revealing the inhibited recombination from either the TiO2 CB or CdS QD to the electrolyte redox species. This caused not only the increased Voc in the CdS QD sensitized solar cell mentioned above, but also the enlarged Jsc in both the CdS sensitized and CdS–N3 co-sensitized solar cells. It should be noted that the dramatically improved photovoltaic performance of the CdS–N3 co-sensitized solar cell compared to that of the CdS sensitized solar cell was not only ascribed to N3’s extended sunlight absorption wavelength, but also the further increased Rct by the N3 dye molecule. This highlights the synergistic passivating effect of both the organic and inorganic layers on the QD surface.
Electron lifetime can be calculated from the formula (τ = RctCμ).38Fig. 4(c) shows that the ZnS coating led to an increase of electron lifetime, which is expected due to the effect of reduced recombination. Meanwhile, the deposition of the dye molecule N3 further increased the lifetime, similar to the trend of Rct. Overall, the fitted electron lifetime trend agrees well with the photovoltaic performance of the solar cell.
According to the EIS analysis, the energetic diagram of the CdS–ZnS–N3 hybrid nanoporous electrode is shown in Fig. 4(d) with the vital charge transfer pathways noted, in which the stepwise energy relationship between N3 and CdS are also shown. The energetic levels of each component are all from the literature.39–43 Upon sunlight illumination, electrons are injected directly from the CdS QDs or N3 into the TiO2 films. QDs are regenerated with the hole transfer from the QDs to the dye instead of the electrolyte species, which was denoted as “CdS regeneration by N3”. Undesired direct recombination channels from TiO2 or the CdS QDs to the electrolyte, which are strongly suppressed by ZnS, are indicated by dashed lines.
To evaluate the photostability of the devices, short circuit current density as a function of time using periodic illumination intervals was measured and illustrated in Fig. 5. It was observed that the CdS QD sensitized solar cell showed decreased short-circuit current under illumination, while the N3 or CdS/ZnS/N3 based ones exhibited no Jsc degradation over at least 1000 s. Actually, they were still stable even after we prolonged the illumination time to more than 2000 seconds. When they were kept in the dark for about 10 hours, the device exhibited similar photovoltaic performance to the fresh one (data were not shown). This revealed much higher photostability of co-sensitized structure using the cobalt complex electrolyte than iodine-based one.18,23,24

Conclusions
In summary, the inorganic layer and dye molecule have been found to synergistically suppress the recombination in a QDSSC, by designing a hybrid structure featuring a TiO2–CdS–ZnS–N3 hybrid photoanode. In this QD–dye hybrid system, strong photoinduced charge transfer occurred between the two sensitizers with CdS QDs regenerated by the quick hole transfer from CdS's valence band to N3's HOMO instead of the electrolyte redox, thanks to the type-II energetic alignment. EIS analysis illustrated that both the ZnS and N3 increased the recombination resistance and thus the electron lifetime, contributing to an impressive enhancement of photovoltaic performance. Notably, cobalt complexes were employed to serve as the hole carrier of N3, leading to the high photostability of the solar cells. For further improving the photovoltaic performance of the hybrid structure, a porphyrin based dye with suitable energetic alignment with QD is required and is under investigation in our lab.
