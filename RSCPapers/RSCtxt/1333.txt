    , Accepted 13th July 2017First published on 13th July 2017AbstractSeawater desalination is a leading method for tackling the challenge of global freshwater shortage. However, existing desalination technologies like capacitive deionization (CDI) have their own limits, including high energy consumption or low ion removal capacity, which is not sufficient for desalting high-concentration saline water with low cost. Herein, we present a concept of flow dual-ions electrochemical deionization technology, which consists of BiOCl for chloride ion Faradaic electrode on the negative side, sodium manganese oxide (Na0.44MnO2) as sodium ion Faradaic electrode on the positive side, and a flow salt feed as electrolyte. It utilizes a redox reaction to individually capture chloride ions and sodium ions concurrently. Under positive electric current operations, the two ions are released for NaCl water electrolyte to flow. On switching to negative electric current, the chloride ions are extracted into the negative electrode, and thus prevented from flowing into the NaCl solution while sodium ions are electrochemically captured into the positive electrode. The novel dual-ions in Faradaic deionization deliver a stable and reversible salt removal/release capacity of 68.5 mg g−1 when operated at a current density 100 mA g−1, which indicates an amount over twice the salt absorption amount of the previously reported best performance (31.2 mg g−1) obtained by a hybrid capacitive deionization system. The electric charge efficiency is up to 0.977 during salt desorption process and 0.958 during absorption process. Owing to the salt removal, energy will be released during discharge process; therefore, the current system is called “desalination generator”. Our research will supply a new method for desalination flow-through system.
Water scarcity and energy crisis are the two main global issues in addition to food, which affect millions of people worldwide.1–3 In recent years, this problem has worsened due to the increased population, drastic climate changes and environmental pollution, and it will continue in the next few decades. Scientists have paid great research attention to the renewable energy storage fields such as hydropower, wind energy, nuclear power and solar cell etc.4–6 In order to solve the fresh water shortage, seawater desalination has played a key role due to unlimited ocean water source.7,8 Technological advancements have made large-scale seawater desalination a reality for increasing the world's supply of freshwater. The common desalination strategies generally include reverse osmosis (RO),9–11 thermal distillation,12,13 capacitive desalination (CDI),14–23 and electro-dialysis24–27etc. Commercial RO and thermal distillation have been widely applied all over the world, and the demands have been still gone up. However, high energy consumption is required for these two methods. CDI and electro-dialysis as alternative solutions are easily operated and eco-friendly, which provide a sustainable water future for desalination in terms of low energy consumption.28 CDI removes ions from saltwater based on electrical absorption and desorption on the surface of electrodes. The ions are harvested and stored in an electrical double layer, which determines a relatively low deionization amount due to its low electric capacity. Commonly used porous carbon electrode materials, such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and carbon aerogel, can only deliver 10–15 mg g−1 salt absorption capacity in a typical CDI system.13 Recently, a hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI) system was demonstrated29–31 where sodium ions are captured by the chemical reaction at one electrode side, while chloride ions are physical adsorbed on the surface of the other activated carbon electrode during the desalination. In these studies, the salt removal capacity is more than 30 mg g−1, which is the highest reported value to date. The ever-growing demand for water and energy saving requires a new desalination technology with economic energy consumption, higher deionization capacity, lower cost, abundant material resources, and environment-friendly features. Desalination battery is another innovative desalination technique based on the chemical reaction of battery electrode materials with chloride and sodium ions.32–34 The deionization capacity of such a system was supposed to be very high owing to the high specific capacity of battery materials. To date, such a system was mainly reported as an energy harvest and storage device with the function of salt removal at static 300 micro liter feed condition,32 and the cyclability and high salt removal capacity of electrode materials have not been disclosed. It has not been applied for deionization. Herein, a new deionization system is demonstrated based on dual-ions electrochemistry with economic and stable BiOCl material as chloride ion Faradaic electrode, Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) as sodium ion Faradaic electrode and 50 ml flow salt feed for the first time. During the desalination process, a negative current is applied to the device; the chloride ions are chemically extracted from electrolyte while sodium ions are chemically captured and intercalated at NMO electrode. The reverse process will happen with the positive electric current. Due to the ion intercalation in the battery electrode materials, the stable and reversible removal/release capacity is up to 68.5 mg g−1 at 100 mA g−1 of current density for 50 cycles, which exceeds more than 200% salt removal capacity of previously reported best performance due to high specific capacity of electrode materials. The “desalination generator” device is simple to assemble and cost effective and has high potential to contribute significantly to renewable energy and water treatment in the future.
The design and experimental set-up of dual-ions electrochemistry

Fig. 1a and b, shows the schematic process of the dual-ions electrochemical deionization. In the electrochemical salt desorption process as described in Fig. 1a, chloride ions are intended to be released from BiOCl electrode while sodium ions are deintercalated at NMO side, which cause a conductivity increase. During the electrochemical salt absorption process, chloride ions in the electrolyte are inserted in the chloride ion Faradaic electrode with the recovery of BiOCl, while sodium ions move to sodium ion Faradaic electrode and are captured by NMO. A decrease in conductivity can be observed during this process. The fabricated working electrodes of BiOCl, NMO and graphite paper substrate are displayed in Fig. 1c, and half electrodes of BiOCl with anion exchange membrane (AEM) and NMO with cation exchange membrane (CEM) are shown in Fig. 1d. The process flow diagram of batch testing is shown in Fig. 1f, where 50 ml NaCl solution is used as feed. The feed water is circled back through the deionization device by the pump, and conductivity meter monitors and records in the feed at the stirring condition. A constant current is applied through the dual-ions electrochemical deionization device at the electro-circuit part. The photo of the experimental set up is shown in Fig. 1g.

Electrochemical performance
The electrochemical behaviors of the BiOCl and NMO were investigated with 1 M NaCl solution as the electrolyte. Fig. 2a and b display the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of 3 electrodes system (counter electrode: platinum; reference electrode: standard Ag/AgCl electrode). For the NMO electrode, the oxidation peaks are observed at 0.40 V and 0.59 V, and the corresponding reduction peaks are located at 0.14 V and 0.38 V. As regards the BiOCl material, the oxidation peak is observed at 0.31 V, and the corresponding reduction peak is located at −0.97 V. There is no clear observation of hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The CV curve of BiOCl–NMO with two electrodes system is shown in the Fig. 2c. It should be noted that water hydrolysis does not take place at such a voltage range (−1.4 to 1.5 V) owing to the existence of resistance in circuit and over potential between electrodes. At the cathodic cycle, there are two major peaks located at 0.93 V and 1.14 V, attributed to the chloride ions released to electrolyte at the BiOCl electrode while sodium ions get de-intercalated from NMO side, as described in eqn (1) and (2). During the anodic cycle, reduction peaks appear at −0.14 V and 0.35 V. The two peaks correspond to a conversion reaction of chloride ions extracted at chloride ion Faradaic electrode while sodium ions are inserted into NMO electrode, as in eqn (3) and (4). The CV behaviors in the NaCl electrolyte show great promise as a desalination device.

Three electrode CV curves of NMO (a) and BiOCl (b) with Pt as counter and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode in aqueous 1 M NaCl; (c) CV curve of the BiOCl–NMO electrode system; the voltage vs. electric charge capacity curves (d); cycling performance (e) and rate capabilities (f) of the BiOCl–NMO system. The electric charge capacity was expressed as the stored or released charge amount (Coulomb) per gram of BiOCl. 
The cathodic reactions during the salt desorption process can be described as follows: Chloride electrode: 3BiOCl + 3e− → Bi + Bi2O3 + 3Cl−(1) Sodium electrode: Na0.44MnO2 → Na0.44−xMnO2 + xNa+ + xe−(2)During the salt absorption process, the redox reaction can be explained as follows: Chloride electrode: Bi + Bi2O3 + 3Cl− → 3BiOCl + 3e−(3) Sodium electrode: Na0.44−xMnO2 + xNa+ + xe− → Na0.44MnO2(4)
Then, the overall reaction for the dual-ions electrochemistry could be expressed as 3xBiOCl + 3Na0.44MnO2 ↔ xBi + xBi2O3 + 3Na0.44−xMnO2 + 3xNaCl(5)

Fig. 2d–f show the electric charge capacity, cycling performance and rate capabilities of BiOCl–NMO system during cycling desalination process. The electric charge capacity (C g−1) is defined as the stored or released charge amount (Coulomb) per mass of BiOCl. The initial electric charge capacity is 540 C g−1 at the 100 mA g−1 current density. However, after 10 cycles the electric charge capacity is maintained at 344.9 C g−1. At the desalination process, chloride ions are captured from electrolyte at the chloride electrode, and sodium ions are inserted into NMO. During the salt release process, chloride ions are extracted from BiOCl and released to electrolyte while sodium ions are deintercalated from NMO electrode. As displayed in Fig. 2e, the recovery efficiency of charge is close to 100% during the electrochemical cycling, which indicates excellent cycling stability for the current deionization system. The BiOCl–NMO system was further investigated at various current densities from 100 to 500 mA g−1. As shown in Fig. 2f, with the increased current density, the electric charge capacity decreases since polarization becomes more serious at a high current density. After six cycles at 500 mA g−1, the capacity can be restored in subsequent cycling stable stage when the current density returns to 100 mA g−1, which indicates that the aqueous dual-ions system is capable of working stably and reversibly.
Salt removal/release performance of dual-ions electrochemistry
The curves of voltage variation and the corresponding salt concentration change vs. time are shown in Fig. 3a. It is observed that the salt concentration keeps decreasing when negative current is applied due to the electrochemical intercalation reaction at the chloride ion Faradaic electrode and sodium ion Faradaic electrode. With a positive current applied, the conductivity returns to the initial value owing to the electrochemical evolution of chloride and sodium ions at two corresponding electrodes. In addition, the conductivity variations show reproducible results for 50 cycles, demonstrating excellent regeneration under aqueous conditions, as shown in Fig. 3b. The salt removal capacity was calculated to up to 68.5 mg g−1 over fifty cycles. ESI,† Fig. S1 shows the maximum salt removal capacity vs. year of publication for capacitive, composite, hybrid, and flow CDI electrodes,28 as well as dual-ions electrochemical deionization (current study). For the static CDI electrodes like carbon materials (black star), the absorption capacity has had a rise from 7 mg g−1 to 15 mg g−1 during the last decade. The flow (green triangle) or composite (blue dot) electrodes system possesses a more than 20 mg g−1 of salt absorption capacity. The highest deionization capacity, 31.2 mg g−1, is obtained using a hybrid CDI technique with one capacitive and one Faradaic electrode (pink square).29 For our dual-ions electrochemical deionization system, the deionization capacity is the highest value due to the high specific capacity from electrode materials to date, which is six times higher than that of conventional activated carbon materials and over double the value of deionization capacity of the previous report where the best performance of 31.2 mg g−1 deionization capacity was obtained via hybrid capacitive deionization.29,30 After the testing of cycling stability, the energy consumption was found to be 0.46 kW h per kilogram salt, based on the calculation from cycle 30 as shown in ESI,† Fig. S2. The result is lower than that of constant voltage mode, and comparable with the constant current mode in the conventional CDI.35,36 Energy recovery is an effective way to further reduce the energy consumption, which was applied in conventional CDI.37–40 In the future research, the energy during the discharge will be integrated as a part of the operation; the overall energy will be greatly reduced, or even comparable with RO. The kinetic deionization rate is 0.020 mg g−1 s−1. It is observed that curve of the salt concentration change is linear. This is the result of the constant current, indicating no loss of electric charge.

(a) The curves of voltage vs. time and the corresponding salt concentration change during the salt desorption/absorption process; (b) the electrochemical salt removal/release capacity during cycling process and (c) the corresponding electric charge efficiency; (d) the curves of voltage vs. time and the corresponding salt concentration change at rate capability test; (e) the salt removal/release capacity and (f) the corresponding electric charge efficiency. Electrochemical salt removal/release capacity was calculated by the total mass of active materials (BiOCl and NMO). 
The charge efficiency Λ, defined as the ratio of the ionic removal charge from the water to the electrical charge of electrode, is viewed as one of the most significant parameters to evaluate the CDI performance. As shown in Fig. 3c, it is observed that the charge efficiency is 0.972 during the desorption process and maintains 0.954 during the absorption process. A comparison of salt removal capacity with 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4 weight ratio of BiOCl:NMO was conducted (ESI,† Fig. S3). After ∼10 cycles, the trend of salt removal capacity is to keep stable. The highest salt removal capacity was obtained at the ratio of 1:2 (BiOCl:NMO), depending on the specific capacity of electrode materials. In aqueous sodium ion battery, NMO has 40–45 mA h g−1 of specific capacity.41,42 BiOCl can be used as electrode material of chloride ion battery in ionic liquid chloride electrolyte.43,44 Recently, we proposed a novel aqueous chloride ion battery,45 which was demonstrated to work with a specific capacity of 92 mA h g−1 (BiOCl). The ratio of battery capacity performance (BiOCl:NMO) has approximate proportion of 2:1, which may explain that the best salt removal performance was obtained at the 1:2 weight ratio of BiOCl:NMO.
The voltage and salt concentration change are shown in Fig. 3d at the different current density test. It can be clearly observed that release/removal time becomes shorter with increasing current density, which is also reflected in the curve of salt concentration change. The salt removal capacity is calculated as 68.5 mg g−1 at 100 mA g−1, 37.5 mg g−1 at 200 mA g−1, 22.4 mg g−1 at 300 mA g−1 and 9.2 mg g−1 at 500 mA g−1. The corresponding desalination rates 0.021 mg g−1 s−1, 0.041 mg g−1 s−1, 0.062 mg g−1 s−1, 0.092 mg g−1 s−1, are shown in ESI,† Fig. S4. The electric charge efficiency decreases to ∼0.826 from 0.954 and recovers after current jumping to 100 mA g−1. The zoom-in results are shown in ESI,† Fig. S5. At a higher current density, the voltage drop is also higher (ESI,† Fig. S6). Some other factors, such as feed concentration, may also influence the salt absorption capacity, as shown in ESI,† Fig. S7. In the low feed concentration, the change of salt concentration is also low. The deionization capacity is 68.5 mg g−1 at 760 mg L−1 feed, 65.1 mg g−1 at 570 mg L−1 feed, and 61.0 mg g−1 at 400 mg L−1 feed. When the salt concentration is adjusted back to 760 mg L−1, the salt absorption/desorption capacity restores to initial level after eight cycles. A representative voltage vs. time curve at different salt concentration is shown in ESI,† Fig. S8. The voltage drop is higher for the lower salt concentration of feed, which indicates a higher resistance existence at lower salt feed condition.
Sodium and chloride ions account for ∼85.6% in composition of seawater. The removal of sodium and chloride is the main purpose during the seawater desalination process. Thus, the current electrode materials and experiment design is specifically targeted for the removal of sodium ion and chloride ion. However, other ions, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+, dominating in seawater except for Na+ may influence the sodium removal. To explore the effect of these ions, a synthetic mixed feed containing Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+ was prepared with the approximate ion ratio as diluted seawater. ESI,† Table S1 shows the ICP result of cycle two during salt recovery and extraction process. The NMO electrode material can also absorb other minor ions. However, the majorly absorbed is still sodium ion due to its high content. In the actual desalination application with complete system design, the pre-treatment or post-treatment can be conducted and other species or ions will be further reduced due to their larger size. The NMO electrode will adsorb and release other ions in the same way as Na+, which will not deactivate the cathode. These results agree with the previously reported desalination battery system.32 At the same time, with the recent development of other aqueous battery systems such as Ca2+ ion,46 Mg2+ ion,47,48 Al3+ ion,49,50 Zn2+ ion,51,52 and Li+ ion,41 it is also possible to remove these ions with the corresponding electrode materials by the similar electrochemical intercalation mechanism. Other trace quantity of ions such as Li+ and Br− may influence the intercalation of sodium ion and chloride ion. However, lithium element (0.17 ppm) in seawater accounts for one sixty-thousandth of sodium content. The molar composition of bromine ion is around 0.15 percent of chloride ion. Moreover, the chloride ion is selectively intercalated into BiOCl electrode following eqn (3). Thus, negligible influence can be caused.
Desalination generator
In the previous research related to conventional CDI devices, salt absorption always occurred with a positive constant voltage or constant current. However, in this case, the salt is released from electrode materials when the positive constant current is applied. Salt removal is observed during the discharge process (negative current), corresponding to an energy release at this stage, which is for the first time reported as a phenomenon. This is a combined system of salt removal and power generation at the same time, called “desalination generator”. The “desalination generator” system is demonstrated in Fig. 4. Three devices were connected in series to drive the three parallel LED bulbs. The voltage was charged to 4.5 V with increased conductivity at the feed. During rest process, the voltage dropped slowly; however, the conductivity was maintained at the same level. Once the LED bulbs were lit by three devices during the discharge process, it was observed that the conductivity dropped immediately, indicating salt removal during the discharge process. A video demo was conducted to describe the process in ESI,† Video S1.

Mechanism analysis
In order to evaluate the insertion/deinsertion process of chloride and sodium ions at the corresponding electrodes, X-ray diffraction patterns were carried out to analyse the phase transition of electrode materials, as shown in ESI,† Fig. S9 where the reflection peaks appearing at 2θ = 26.2° and 54.3° are assigned to the graphite substrate. The zoomed-in XRD patterns are presented in Fig. 5a and b. At the initial stage, only BiOCl peaks can be observed, which are marked in # in the black spectrum. During the salt de-intercalation process as shown in Fig. 1a, BiOCl releases the chloride ions and is transformed to bismuth and Bi2O3, as shown in reaction eqn (1). The diffraction peaks of BiOCl phase vanish while the XRD pattern of bismuth metal can be distinctly observed at this state.45 The bismuth peaks are marked in * in the red spectrum shown in Fig. 5a. However, no XRD pattern of Bi2O3 is clearly detected. One possible reason is that Bi2O3 exists in amorphous form, which is also proven by the Raman spectrum shown in ESI,† Fig. S10 where no bismuth oxide peaks can be observed. These results are consistent with pioneer study.43,45 The XRD pattern of BiOCl is still observed with weak intensity, which means a small part of oxychloride still exists at the state of chloride extraction. The previous studies also showed that BiOCl could lose chloride ions in ionic liquid electrolytes.43 During the electrochemical salt absorption as displayed in Fig. 1b, chloride ions are inserted back, resulting in the restoration of BiOCl peak, while the intensity of Bi metal peaks is drastically decreased as shown in the subsequent recovery state (blue line). An example of the peak intensity ratio (bismuth at 39.5°/BiOCl at 40.8°) is shown in ESI,† Table S2 for the initial BiOCl, its state of chloride extraction, and recovery state of chloride. At initial state, the intensity ratio of bismuth at 39.5°/BiOCl at 40.8° is 0.00. However, it increases to 2.08 after the salt de-intercalation, indicating the loss of chloride. Upon the completion of desalination, the electrode captures the chloride ion with the recovery of BiOCl. The XRD patterns of NMO at the initial state, the state of sodium extraction, and recovery state are shown in ESI,† Fig. S9b. Compared to the initial state, most of the diffraction peaks shift to higher 2theta angles at the state of sodium extraction, which is caused by the shrinking of lattice parameters during the chemical extraction of sodium ions.53,54 After the completion of salt absorption process, the diffraction peaks shift back owing to the insertion of sodium ions. The zoomed-in patterns of NMO with the 2theta degree region from 30° to 40° are displayed in Fig. 5b. It can be clearly observed that the peak (350) is split into (350) and (0100) at the state of sodium extraction.53,54 At the subsequent state, the peaks shrink back with sodium recovery.

The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements were performed to further study the loss and gain of chloride and sodium ions. Before characterization, the electrode samples were washed to remove the residual electrolyte with deionized water and dried in an oven overnight. The EDX spectra of BiOCl electrode at the initial state, its chloride extraction state and chloride recovery state are shown in Fig. 5c and ESI,† Table S3. No distinct morphology change was observed (ESI,† Fig. S11). The peaks of bismuth and chloride in EDX spectra are observed at 2.45 keV and 2.62 keV, which can be assigned to the binding energy of Bi M and Cl Kα respectively. The atomic ratio of Cl:Bi is summarized in ESI,† Table S3. At the initial state, the ratio of Cl:Bi is 0.824; however it decreases to 0.393 at the chloride extraction state, which indicates the loss of chloride. After recovery, the Cl:Bi ratio recovers to 0.672. The mapping images of chloride at the initial state, extraction state, and recovery state are shown in Fig. 5d–f. This is a direct proof of the gain of chloride ions during salt release/removal process. The observation is consistent with the XRD result in Fig. 5a. For NMO electrode, the morphology and composition were also investigated using SEM-EDX. In as-prepared state, the ratio of Na:Mn is 0.42 as shown in Fig. 5g and ESI,† Table S4. After salt de-intercalation, the ratio of Na:Mn decreases to 0.18, indicating sodium ions loss in this stage. After salt removal, the ratio of Na:Mn recovers to 0.35, which demonstrates that sodium can be gained by NMO. A detailed comparison of EDX spectra of initial state, extraction state of sodium, and recovery state of sodium was conducted and is shown in the ESI,† Fig. S12. These results agree with the observed phenomena in XRD measurement displayed in Fig. 5b. In addition, the morphology change can be apparently observed based on the SEM images during cycles, as shown in ESI,† Fig. S13.
Conclusions
A new battery deionization system based dual-ion electrochemistry, composed of BiOCl as chloride ion Faradaic electrode and NMO as sodium ion Faradaic electrode, is demonstrated to work for the first time. It utilizes a redox reaction to reversibly exchange chloride ions and sodium ions at the two electrodes with aqueous flow of NaCl electrolyte, which is confirmed by CV and the behaviors of cycling and rate capabilities. During the salt release process, the chloride ions are de-intercalated from the chloride ion Faradaic electrode under the positive electric current condition while the sodium ions are released at the NMO side by redox electrochemistry. At the salt removal process where negative electric current is applied, chloride ions are captured at the BiOCl electrode and sodium ions are chemically inserted into the NMO electrode. A stable and reverse electric charge capacity is obtained up to 344.9 C g−1 at 100 mA g−1 current density with a salt removal/release efficiency of ∼100%. The novel deionization system delivers a stable and reversible salt removal/release capacity of 68.5 mg g−1. This is the first time a super-high salt removal capacity in a deionization field has been demonstrated. This capacity is influenced by the current density and feed concentration. Low current density and high salt concentration of feed will result in a high deionization capacity. The charge efficiency is up to 0.972 during the salt release process, while it also maintains 0.954 during the salt removal process. A demo video demonstrates that three parallel LED bulbs are lit while the conductivity of feed keeps decreasing. Thus, it is called the “desalination generator”. We also investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism in detail during the salt removal/release process by XRD, SEM, EDX and Raman spectra. The results show that chloride ions and sodium ions can be synchronously and reversibly intercalated-deintercalated at the corresponding electrodes based on electrochemical reactions. The dual-ion electrochemical deionization system is simple to assemble with a super-high salt removal/release capacity and an excellent cycling performance. It is more suitable for high concentration salt treatment. Therefore, this strategy could be a major breakthrough for developing more efficient and economic desalination system, and can contribute significantly to renewable energy and water treatment in the future.
Methods
Material and material synthesis
Mn2O3, Na2CO3, BiOCl and NaCl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further chemical treatment. Sodium manganese oxide (NMO) was synthesized using a solid-state reaction at a high temperature.29 In brief, Mn2O3 was mixed with Na2CO3 in a molar ratio of 0.484:1 (Na2CO3:Mn2O3) and ball milled. The precursor mixture was heated at 500 °C for 5 h at the furnace in open air conditioning; the resulting product was ball-milled again and heated at 900 °C for 12 h under air conditions. The final NMO powder was obtained for the electrode fabrication and characterization.
Electrode fabrication and device assembling
The BiOCl electrode was prepared with 50 wt% BiOCl: 25 wt% polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF): 25 wt% carbon black in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) using a mortar and pestle. The NMO electrode was directly fabricated using the synthesized NMO mixed with PVDF and carbon black with the ratio 8:1:1. The slurry mixture was uniformly pasted onto the graphite paper and dried at 100 °C in a vacuum oven for two days. The prepared electrodes were assembled into 8 cm × 8 cm device. The size of electrode was 2.8 cm × 2.8 cm. The spacing piece between electrodes was 2 mm. A grid separator was inserted to further insulate the two electrodes. The ion exchange membranes were placed in front of each electrode to block the co-ions during absorption/desorption process. The detailed structure is shown in Fig. 1.
Electrochemical absorption test
Batch process experiments were carried out in a continuously recycling system including a unit cell, conductivity monitor, a peristaltic pump, and battery tester as shown in Fig. 1f and g. In the water flow circuit, the feed was continuously pumped into a unit cell and the effluent returned to the tank. The feed was prepared using sodium chloride as flow electrolyte with an initial concentration of 760 mg l−1. The volume of the feed solution was ∼50 ml and the temperature was 298 K. The flow rate was controlled at 100 ml minute−1. In order prevent water evaporation, preservative film was employed to fully cover the feed. In the electrocircuit, a constant current was supplied on the unit cell via a battery analyzer (Neware, Shenzhen, China) during the salt absorption/desorption process. The voltage window was controlled at the range of −1.4 to 1.5 V. The ratio of electrode weight was controlled at 10 mg BiOCl:20 mg NMO. Specifically, the mass of BiOCl was 14.2 mg and NMO was 30.3 mg during cycling testing. At the current density testing, the mass of BiOCl was 10.5 mg and NMO was 21.6 mg. The thickness of BiOCl was 40–50 μm and NMO had an 80–90 μm thickness. The electric charge capacity was expressed as the stored or released charge amount (Coulomb) per gram of BiOCl. The deionization capacity was calculated by the total mass of active electrode materials including BiOCl and NMO. The variations in conductivity and current were recorded simultaneously and independently.
The calculation of electric charge capacity, salt removal capacity and charge efficiency

Electric charge capacity (C g−1). 
The stored or released charge per gram of electrode material. Herein, the electric charge capacity can be calculated by the specific capacity of BiOCl (mA h g−1), which is directly obtained from battery analyzer (Neware, Shenzhen, China). Electric charge capacity (C g−1) = specific capacity of BiOCl (mA h g−1) × 3.6.


Salt removal capacity, Γ (mg g−1). 
The salt removal capacity of dual-ion electrochemical deionization is calculated as follows:Γ = (Cf − C0) × V/Mtwhere Cf and C0 are final and initial NaCl concentrations (ppm), respectively, V is the volume of NaCl solution (l) and Mt is the total mass of the active electrodes (g), specifically, the total mass of active electrode materials (BiOCl and NMO).


Charge efficiency, Λ. 
The ratio of the ionic removal charge from the water to the electrical charge of electrode, calculated as follows: Λ = Γ × Mt/(58.44 × MBiOCl × electric charge capacity/F), where Γ is salt removal capacity (mg g−1), Mt is the total mass of the active electrodes (g), MBiOCl is the mass of BiOCl electrode material, F is Faraday constant (C mol−1).

Characterization
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was carried out using electrochemical workstation (VMP3, Biologic, France) in a three-electrode mode, including a standard calomel electrode as reference electrode and a platinum foil as counter electrode and two electrode mode with BiOCl and NMO electrodes. Crystal structure of the electrode materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation under the accelerating voltage of 40 kV. The morphology and structure of the samples were examined via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7600F) with EDX analyzer. Raman spectra were measured using a confocal Raman system with the 532 nm laser excitation (WITec Instruments Corp., Ulm, Germany).
