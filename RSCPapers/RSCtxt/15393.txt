    , Accepted 10th July 2018First published on 11th July 2018AbstractTwo Bingel fullerenes, PCP and MCM, as electron transporting materials (ETMs) have been developed for achieving thick-film perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with efficiencies beyond 19% with a planar absorber layer over 1 micrometer. Almost no PVSCs have exhibited PCEs above 18% with a 1 micrometer planar layer before, owing to the excess perovskite defects deteriorating charge extraction and the performance of thick-film based devices. Benefiting from the nearly identical optoelectronic properties of two ETMs stemming from tailored chemical structures, the studies on them allow us to unveil the fact that subtle molecular interaction (anion–π and Lewis acid–base) between ETMs and perovskites strongly affects the charge extraction at the heterointerface, which in turn influences the device hysteresis and performance. Particularly, weak Lewis base–acid O–Pb2+ interaction between MCM and the perovskite helps passivate the trap-states at the interface, resulting in a smooth electron extraction and reduced device hysteresis (the average hysteresis index (HI) of 0.03 ± 0.01). However, the strong N–Pb2+ coordination induces misalignment of the energy levels at the perovskite/PCP heterojunction, causing electron accumulation at the junction, and hence the large HI (0.17 ± 0.05) in devices. This work provides new insights into the charge extraction at the perovskite/organic interface and the possible molecular interaction from organics to cure perovskite defects.
1. Introduction
The interfacial properties play important roles in determining the optoelectronic properties of polycrystalline lead halide perovskites1–6 as well as the photon-to-electron conversion of the derived perovskite solar cells (PVSCs).7–9 Although the performance surpasses 22% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs),7,10–12 the optimal PVSCs are usually obtained with the planar active layer thickness in the sub-micrometer range (300–500 nm), by avoiding a micrometer thick perovskite layer. Essentially, a thick-film perovskite layer can be beneficial for obtaining high-performance devices with good reproducibility, by improving light harvesting and decreasing the photocurrent leakage of PVSCs.13–15 Meanwhile, a thick layer also facilitates formation of uniform films with full coverage, which is a perquisite for scale-up fabrication of perovskites. The reason for the low success in developing high-performance thick-film PVSCs is that the thick polycrystalline perovskite layer might possess excess defects, where charge trapping and ion migration are heavily involved1,16–19 in deterioration of charge extraction and the performance of the resultant PVSCs.20 For instance, lead cations without saturated iodide coordination can capture free electrons as trap sites.21–23 Meanwhile, other trap states, such as mobile iodide, iodine24 and antisite PbI3−,25–27 also cause charge trapping and recombination. The presence of these defects can immensely decrease the device performances and induce severe hysteresis.15,28,29
In this regard, the physical and chemical information related to the heterojunction between the perovskite and charge transporting molecule needs to be further explored to understand perovskite interfacial properties and formulate defect-curing methods.30–32 Besides the growth of large perovskite grains, it has been reported that the introduction of charge transporting molecules or additives can help mitigate the density of trap-states for perovskites.17,33–37 For instance, in addition to charge extraction and transport, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and other fullerene derivatives have been known to be effective for passivating perovskite trap-states.25,35,38–46 Other heteroatom containing materials, like pyridine, cyano, imide and amino based derivatives have been also used to for this purpose.2,21,22,47–51 These studies suggested that the iodide and fullerene anion–π interactions not only retard mobile ions, but also improve fullerene electron conduction through anion-induced electron transfer n-doping.52–54 And the charge compensation between Lewis acid–base pairs (i.e. lead ion and electron lone-pair bearing heteroatoms) can passivate defects from lead ions without saturate coordination. We recently developed dopant-free hole extraction materials (HEMs),55–57 and revealed that heteroatoms conjugated in HEMs govern molecular interaction with the perovskite, strongly influence PVSC performance and hysteresis.56 Recently, Liu et al. demonstrated that the electron and hole transporting molecules simultaneously passivate the Pb–I antisite defects and uncoordinated Pb ions.58 These provide us platforms for probing the structure–property relationship between charge transporting molecules and the perovskite interface. The explication of this would provide new insights into developing efficient devices, which, however, remains less explored.
Herein, two nano-fullerene derivatives, di(3-(pyridin-4-yl)propyl) [60]fullerenyl malonate (PCP) and di(1-methoxyethyl) [60]fullerenyl malonate (MCM), are developed with tailored chemical structures, which have only differences in the terminal substituents, pyridyl (PCP) and methoxyl groups (MCM), respectively (Fig. 1). Introducing them as ETMs into planar inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) facilitates delivering PCEs over 19% for an over 1 micrometer thick planar perovskite layer. Note that almost no PVSCs have been reported before to exhibit PCE above 18% with a planar active layer beyond 1 micrometer. Owing to the nearly identical optoelectronic properties (absorption, energetics and electron mobilities) stemming from the tailored similar chemical structure, the studies on them allow unveiling the fact that the cooperative molecular interaction (anion–π and Lewis acid–base) between fullerene ETMs and perovskites can strongly affect the charge extraction and transport properties at the heterointerface, which in turn influences the device hysteresis and performance of the derived PVSCs. Particularly, besides the anion–π interaction between fullerene and mobile anions, the additional Lewis base–acid O–Pb2+ interaction59 (−78.9 kcal mol−1 in calculation) between MCM and the perovskite helps passivate the trap states of the perovskite, resulting in smooth electron extraction and negligible device hysteresis (the average hysteresis index (HI) of 0.03 ± 0.01). Whereas, the strong N–Pb2+ coordination (−113.6 kcal mol−1 in calculation) induces large misalignment of the energy level between the perovskite and PCP ETM, causing charge accumulation at the perovskite–PCP heterojunction, and therefore a large HI (the average HI of 0.17 ± 0.05). This work, exploring the subtle molecular interaction between fullerene ETMs and perovskite, would provide new insights on the influence of charge extraction to the derived molecular interaction with organics at perovskite heterojunction, which would open new aspects for exploring efficient PVSCs through the tailored molecular interaction.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Bingel fullerenes
The chemical structures of two ETMs are shown in Fig. 1a, and the detailed synthesis is given in the ESI (Fig. S1†). In short, bis(3-(pyridin-4-yl)propyl)malonate and bis(2-methoxyethyl)malonate were synthesized by an esterification reaction between malonic acid and 3-(pyridin-4-yl)propan-1-ol and 2-methoxyethanol, respectively. The ester intermediates subsequently reacted with C60 fullerene through Bingel–Hirsch reactions,60,61 yielding PCP and MCM. Target chemicals were purified by column chromatography, followed by re-precipitation. And these chemicals were characterized by NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Note that both ETMs, PCP and MCM, exhibit good solubility in common solvents such as chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB) (>30 mg ml−1).
2.2 Density functional theory calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed (Fig. 1 and S2†), revealing that these two ETMs have similar electronic structures. The LUMOs (lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals) and the HOMOs (highest-occupied molecular orbitals) of both ETMs are located on the fullerene core with similar energetics (Fig. S2 and Table S1†). To evaluate the potential interaction between these two ETMs and Lewis acidic Pb2+, p-methyl pyridine and dimethyl ether were used for calculation as the simplified model compounds. Fig. 1b shows the schematic description for the interaction between Lewis acidic Pb2+ and the Lewis basic N-atom and O-atom, respectively. The calculation showed that N–Pb2+ has stronger interaction (−113.6 kcal mol−1) than O–Pb2+ (−78.9 kcal mol−1) (Tables S2 and S3†).
2.3 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy characterization
To further confirm the interaction between pyridyl/methoxyl groups and lead ions, the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted to analyze the neat ETMs and ETM/PbI2 blends and the results are shown in Fig. S3.† Compared with neat PCP, the measurement of the PCP/PbI2 blend suggested that there is interaction between pyridyl and PbI2, as several C–H stretching vibration peaks for the pyridyl group (3100–3000 cm−1) in the blend disappear and there is a slight shift of 3023 cm−1 (neat PCP) to 3021 cm−1 (blend). In Fig. S3b,† in the region of the pyridyl backbone stretching vibration (1600–1500 cm−1), the peak of 1602 cm−1 (in neat PCP) has been shifted to 1599 cm−1 (for blend) and the relative intensities in the blend go up for peaks of 1559 and 1540 cm−1. These observations indicate the formation of a pyridyl and PbI2 complex in the PCP/PbI2 blend. However, its intensity at 433 nm remains unchanged in the MCM titration. This suggests that PCP forms stronger complexes with Zn-TBP, than that of MCM, due to the strong tendency of partial electron donation from the nitrogen lone-pair to zinc ions.
2.4 Ultraviolet-visible spectra and cyclic voltammogram characterization
The ultraviolet-visible (UV) absorption spectra of PCP and MCM films are shown in Fig. 2a. The absorption spectra show that the maximum film absorption peaks of PCP and MCM are located at 335 nm and 336 nm, respectively. With the absorption edges at 560 nm, their corresponding optical band gaps are estimated to be 2.21 eV for PCP and MCM. From the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of PCP and MCM, shown in Fig. 2b, the reductive peaks for the two molecules are reversible, indicating good electrochemical stability for them. No oxidation peaks are observed from the CV measurements. The LUMO levels of PCP and MCM are estimated to be −3.88 eV. This demonstrates that both have LUMO levels similar to the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the perovskite (−3.90 eV). Meanwhile, they have a deeper HOMO level (−6.09 eV, calculated using optical band gaps) than the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite (−5.40 eV). Therefore, these are two ETMs that energetically favour the electron-extraction and hole-blocking from the perovskite to the cathode.

2.5 Ultraviolet-visible titration of metal coordination
To differentiate the coordination strength between pyridyl/methoxyl and Lewis acidic metal ions, we conducted UV-vis titration of metal tert-butyl phenyl porphyrin with PCP and MCM, respectively. Here we choose planar and five-coordinated zinc porphyrin (Zn-TBP) as the standard rather than lead porphyrin (Pb-TBP) to perform the studies, because Pb-TBP has a saddle-shaped structure that is adverse for coordination characterization. Generally, the formation of complexation between metallic ions and organic ligands will change the electron cloud distribution of metallic porphyrins, corresponding to the generation of new absorption peaks and the decrease of the original absorption intensity. Zn-TBP in chloroform (2 × 10−6 mol l−1) exhibited a strong Soret absorption peak of 423.5 nm, which presented subtle changes when titrated with up to 20 equivalents of PCP and MCM, respectively (Fig. 2 and S4†). In addition, the absorption intensity at 433 nm showed a noticeable enhancement in the PCP titration, whereas, its intensity at 433 nm remains unchanged in the MCM titration. This suggests that PCP forms stronger complexes with Zn-TBP, than MCM, due to the strong tendency of partial electron donation from the nitrogen lone-pair to zinc ions.
2.6 Device performance characterization

Fig. 3a shows the current–voltage (J–V) results of planar PVSCs (inset picture) based on PCP and MCM as ETMs, characterized under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G solar illumination. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The device with PCP as the ETM exhibits an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.11 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 22.31 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.78, yielding a PCE of 19.30% in the reverse scan (from open circuit to short circuit) and VOC = 1.07 V, JSC = 22.12 mA cm−2, FF = 0.69, and PCE = 16.35% in the forward scan (from short circuit to open circuit), respectively. On the other hand, the device with MCM shows a PCE of 19.16% in the reverse scan (VOC = 1.08 V, JSC = 22.12 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.80), and a PCE of 18.13% in the forward scan (VOC = 1.07 V, JSC = 22.57 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.75), which exhibits a similar device performance to those based on PCBM. The histograms of device performance are shown in Fig. S5,† indicating the good reproducibility of these fullerene ETM based PVSCs.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) characterization is presented in Fig. 3b, and the calculated JSC obtained from the integral curves of the EQE spectra matches well with the experimental values (error range < 5%) (Fig. 3b and Table 1). Fig. 3c shows the stable photocurrent density and the PCE outputs obtained are over 18.7% and 18.6%, as a function of PCE to time at the maximum output power point and they maintain high efficiency outputs for several minutes.
Note that the two devices show almost the same best efficiencies, while there is a large difference in J–V hysteresis. To quantitatively compare the hysteresis effect across different ETMs, a modified hysteresis index (HI) is adopted.62,63 (1)where JRS (0.8VOC) and JFS (0.8VOC) represent the photocurrent density at 80% of the VOC for the reverse scan and forward scan, respectively. According to eqn (1), the calculated HIs of the 15 devices based on PCP and MCM were 0.17 ± 0.05 and 0.03 ± 0.01, respectively, which indicate that the MCM based devices show negligible hysteresis (Fig. 3d).

Fig. 4 shows the cross sectional view of the SEM (scanning electron microscope) for the entire photovoltaic device, showing that the thickness of the perovskite layer is ∼1050 nm with large vertical perovskite grains. Top-down SEM images for those perovskite/fullerene films indicated similar fullerene coverages atop perovskites. Please see ESI† for the detailed fabrication procedure. Note planar PVSCs with an active layer beyond 1 micrometer usually exhibit a PCE below 18%, since thick polycrystalline perovskite layers routinely possess excess defects that cause charge trapping and recombination and decrease performance. The recombination kinetics of these two ETM based thick-film PVSCs are further investigated by measuring JSC and VOC in the reverse scan at varied light intensities (I) from 139 to 5.2 mW cm−2 (Fig. S6†). Fig. S6a† shows that JSC ∝ Iα, where α = 0.979 and 0.984 for PCP and MCM devices, respectively. Fig. S6b† shows that VOC varied logarithmically (ln(I)) with light intensity, in which the slopes for PCP and MCM devices are both 1.16 kT e−1. These indicate the similar and mitigated recombination kinetics for both cases in the reverse scans. To further study the charge extraction ability of MCM and PCP, charge collection probability (Pc) with respect to internal voltage (Vint) under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 was examined using Pc = Jph/Jph,sat and it is shown in Fig. S11.†
 Fig. 4  The cross sectional view of the SEM image of the entire device. 
The photocurrent density Jph is calculated using Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Vint is determined as Vint = Vbi− Vapplied, where Vbi is the built-in potential, which refers to the voltage at which Jph is zero, and Vapplied is the applied voltage. The Vbi of PCP and MCM with reverse scanning are 1.13 V and 1.12 V respectively, while for the forward scanning, the relative values become 1.07 V and 1.09 V. Jph is saturated at high Vint (2 V), and therefore, we could find that both PCP and MCM had a high Pc (∼99.0%) with reverse scanning. While for forward scanning, the Pc decreased to 90% for PCP and 94% for MCM, indicating better charge extraction ability for MCM, which is well consistent with the higher forward Jsc of MCM. The worse charge extraction ability of PCP in forward scanning is responsible for the serious hysteresis.
2.7 Photoluminescence measurements
In order to differentiate the effect of ETM on the excited state of perovskites, we carry out steady state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL measurements on the neat perovskite film and the perovskites with PCP and MCM, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, the perovskite film without ETMs shows the strongest PL signal among the three samples. Very remarkable PL quenching is observed when the ETMs (PCP and MCM) were spin-coated atop the perovskite film. Time-resolved PL decay measurements were also performed (Fig. 5b and Table 2). Perovskites without ETMs exhibit an averaged decay time (τave) of 115.09 ns.

When PCP and MCM were applied atop, the decay time dramatically decreased to 54.33 ns and 29.88 ns, respectively. The fast decay (τ1) could be attributed to the surface traps related charge recombination and the charge extraction of the ETM.63 The bare perovskite layer exhibits fast τ1 with a small fraction value which corresponds to the abundant surface traps that quickly quench a portion of excited perovskites. After covering with a fullerene layer, the surface traps of the perovskite can be passivated. The charge extraction at the perovskite grain boundary can be the main channel to quench a large portion of excited perovskites with relatively slower τ1. When comparing the PCP and MCM, the misalignment of the energy level at the perovskite/PCP heterojunction leads to poorer charge extraction, which results in longer τ1 than in perovskite/MCM. It is worthy to note that both PCP and MCM have same level of intrinsic mobilities, perhaps the variation of decay lifetimes relying more on the interfacial properties between ETMs and perovskites. The slow decay for the perovskite with PCP would be the result of charge accumulation at the PCP/perovskite heterojunction. Whereas, the faster decay in the film with MCM illustrates its more efficient electron extraction out of the perovskite across interfacial heterojunctions.63
2.8 Energy band measurements
Note that the top-view SEM image (Fig. S8†) of the perovskite film implies the presence of abundant grain boundaries for the as-prepared perovskites. The solution spinning of ETMs atop the perovskite should allow fullerenes to cover and interact with unsaturated coordinated Pb2+ and iodides, together with competitive bonding to other species at the perovskite interface. Such interactions vary the interfacial properties. We have further obtained the cross-sectional SEM images and EDX profile of real devices (Fig. S10†). From the region down to the fullerene/perovskite junction at 100 nm (as shown in green circles along the white line in the figure), we can infer that the sharp increase of carbon signals might be representative for the fullerene rich perovskite interface regions. As further detected by Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) for the perovskite/PCP, perovskite/MCM and perovskite samples (Fig. S9†), the VBM/HOMO edges and the secondary electron cutoff (ECutoff) edges are 1.14, 0.93, and 0.82 eV and 16.44, 16.57, and 16.51 eV, respectively. The positions of the CBM/LUMO edges are calculated using the optical bandgap. The energy level alignment at the perovskite/ETM interfaces can be seen in Fig. 5c. Note that ultra-thin layer fullerene was spun atop perovskites in order to probe the interfacial electronic conditions. This indicates that the perovskite/PCP interface presents large bending of the energy level, where the electron donation from the nitrogen lone-pair to Pb2+ likely causes energetic misalignment at the perovskite–PCP heterojunction. The deep energy level deviation (Δ′ = 0.32 eV) at the perovskite/PCP interface results in electron trapping and accumulation, leading to poor charge extraction, which can be evidenced by the slow PL decay and device hysteresis. And the perovskite/MCM interface has only small energy level deviation (Δ′′ = 0.11 eV) between the perovskite and MCM, resulting in smooth electron extraction at the heterojunction. To our understanding, the downshift of the energy level from pyridine–perovskite coordination may be in favor of hole extraction from the perovskite to hole extraction materials (HEM).2,21 In our case, the pyridyl terminal on the fullerene ETM is adverse to electron extraction due to the mismatched perovskite CBM and fullerene LUMO. Meanwhile, the fullerene–anion interaction helps not only retard free iodide migration from the perovskite to the cathode, but also improves fullerene electron conduction through anion-induced electron transfer n-doping.52–54 These cooperative interactions work together to passivate the trap-states at the perovskite surface, and to optimize energetic alignment at the heterojunction, resulting in efficient electron extraction and reduction of device hysteresis in thick perovskite-film based PVSCs.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, two ETMs, PCP and MCM, are developed for facilitating high-performance thick-film PVSCs with PCEs over 19% with an over 1 micrometer thick perovskite layer. With the tailored similar chemical structures and nearly identical optoelectronic properties of the two ETMs, our studies unveil that the subtle molecular interaction (anion–π and Lewis acid–base) between ETMs and perovskites strongly affects the charge extraction and transport properties at the heterointerface, which in turn influences the device hysteresis and performance. Interestingly, the PCP based devices show distinct J–V hysteresis due to the strong coordination between the electron-donating pyridine with Lewis acid Pb2+, which causes energetic misalignment and hence charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETM heterojunction. In contrast, benefiting from the suitable heterojunction conditions, MCM based devices give negligible hysteresis. This work provides new insights into the interfacial properties and the possible molecular interaction with organics to cure perovskite defects, which could provide new opportunities for exploring efficient PVSCs.
4. Experimental
4.1 PVSC fabrication
The ITO coated substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent (2% vol Hellmanex), deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively. After that, the substrates were dried in a nitrogen flow and cleaned by UV-ozone treatment for 20 min before use. The NiOx substrate was prepared by spin coating precursor solution (nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate:ethylenediamine = 1 M:1 M in ethylene glycol) on ITO glass and annealed at 300 °C for 1 h, detailed information can be found in other reports.64 MAI and PbI2 were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio in a DMAc and NMP (4:1) mixture with a concentration of 1.4 M. Before spin-coating the perovskite layer, the precursor solution and NiOx substrate were heated at 70 °C. The spin-coating process was at 1000 rpm for 10 s, and 4000 rpm for 30 s, and started initially after dropping the heated precursor onto the heated substrate, after that 50 μl toluene was dropped at around 15 s during the second procedure, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 2 min. PCP or MCM solution (10 mg ml−1 in CB) was spin-coated on the perovskite at 2000 rpm for 30 s; PCP (0.5 mg ml−1 in ethanol) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by deposition of 100 nm Ag in a vacuum chamber under a high vacuum of 5 × 10−4 Pa. The device area is 0.115 cm2, which is defined by the cross section of Ag and ITO.
4.2 PVSC characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves were recorded on a Keithley source unit under AM 1.5G 1 sun intensity illumination (100 mW cm−2) by a solar simulation from Enli Technology, and the light intensity was calibrated with a standard photovoltaic reference cell. The EQE spectrum was measured using a QE-R Model of Enli Technology.
