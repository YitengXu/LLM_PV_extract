The NiS@ZnS composite exhibited a cabbage leaf like nanostructure and showed outstanding electrochemical performance in SCs with a specific capacitance of 1533.0 F g−1 at a current density of 7.5 A g−1, good cycling stability with 97.9% retention over 3000 cycles, greater energy density, and excellent rate capability compared to the bare NiS (1279.83 F g−1) and ZnS (616.66 F g−1)-based electrodes in SCs. The facile, novel synthesis method, outstanding performance, well defined surface morphology, synergetic effect and low cost make the NiS@ZnS composite an ideal electrode material for electrochemical energy storage devices.
1. Introduction
Supercapacitors (SCs) and energy storage devices have attracted considerable interest due to their high-power density, long cycling ability, reliability, and fast charge–discharge rates compared to conventional rechargeable batteries.1,2 Therefore, they are widely used in applications, such as memory backup systems, industrial power management, and hybrid electric vehicles.3–6 On the other hand, the major problem that hinders many practical applications of SCs is their low energy density. Finding good electrode materials with high specific capacitance, good rate capability, and low cost and of natural abundance is a challenging issue.7 SCs are classified according to the charge–discharge mechanism: (1) electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), which involve charge stored electrostatically by charge accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface and employ carbon active materials (carbon sphere, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, reduced graphene and so on) with a high specific area, and (2) pseudo capacitors, which rely on the fast and reversible redox reactions for charge storage (between electrolyte ions and electro active materials) and possess higher capacitance and superior energy density compared to EDLCs.8–10 Pseudocapacitor electrode materials are mainly conducting polymers and transition metal oxides/hydroxides considering their high specific capacitance. Transition metal oxides besides conducting polymers have attracted enormous interest as active electrode materials for SCs.
Transition metal sulfides (TMS) have unique properties, such as excellent specific capacitance, multiple redox reactions, high electrical conductivity, good electrochemical stability, eco-friendly nature, and low cost.11 NiS, SnS, ZnS, and CoS are widely used in SCs because of their hierarchical architecture and high specific capacitance.12 Among these TMSs, NiS has many advantageous properties, such as high theoretical specific capacity, low cost, ease of fabrication, low toxicity, and environmental friendliness and it is a promising candidate for SC application.13–15
Yang et al.16 prepared β-NiS with a hierarchical structure that achieved a specific capacitance of 119.1 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. Xiaoyan Yan et al.17 prepared NiS nanoflake arrays via a CBD method, achieving a specific capacitance of 718 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. Zhu et al.18 prepared NiS hollow spheres using a facile template-engaged transformation method, achieving a specific capacitance of 927–583 F g−1 at 4.08–10.2 A g−1. Previous studies suggested that binary metal sulfides can deliver richer redox reactions and enhanced electrochemical activity compared to single component sulfides. In particular, single component sulfides deliver low conductivity, lower specific capacitance, and poor cycling stability due to the feasible detachment of the active material on the substrate during the charge–discharge process.19 Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is an important II–IV semiconductor material with a large specific surface area, good electrical conductivity, environmental friendliness, ease of synthesis, nontoxicity, and a wide band gap of 3.5 to 3.8 eV. Several applications of ZnS nanomaterials have been proposed, such as solar cells, optoelectronic devices, and energy storage devices.
To the best of the author's knowledge, there are no reports on NiS@ZnS composites for SC applications. In this study, a cost-effective and facile solution-based method (CBD) was used for the synthesis of a NiS@ZnS composite on a nickel foam substrate without any conductive or binder-free material for high-performance SCs. Owing to the synergic effect of this unique structure, the as-fabricated NiS@ZnS composite delivered a higher specific capacitance of 1533 F g−1 at a current density of 7.5 A g−1, and an excellent capacity retention of 97.9% after 3000 cycles compared to the individual NiS (1279.83 F g−1) and ZnS (616.66 F g−1), which is mainly due to the synergistic effects of NiS and ZnS and their high surface area. The efficient NiS@ZnS composite is expected to have potential applications and would be an ideal electrode material for electrochemical energy storage devices. The comprehensive surface morphological and structural properties of the composite and bare electrode material are discussed briefly.
2. Experimental methods
2.1 Materials
All chemicals, such as nickel(II) sulfate hexahydrate [NiSO4·6H2O], zinc acetate dihydrate [C4H10O6Zn], urea [CH4N2O], sodium thiosulfate [Na2S2O3], and nickel foam (Ni foam), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
2.2 Synthesis of NiS, ZnS and NiS@ZnS electrodes
The electroactive NiS@ZnS materials were deposited on Ni foam substrates using a facile CBD method. Before depositing the NiS@ZnS materials, Ni foam substrates were cut into 1.5 cm × 5 cm pieces, and cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, ethanol, and deionized (DI) water for 15 min each to remove the unwanted particles. The substrates were then dried using a hair dryer.
For the synthesis of the NiS@ZnS electrode, 1.839 g of NiSO4·6H2O, 1.536 g of C4H10O6Zn, 1.681 g of CH4N2O, and 4.42 g of Na2S2O3 were dissolved in 70 ml of DI water and stirred vigorously for 20 min to achieve a homogeneous solution. After stirring for 20 min, the homogeneous solution was then transferred into a flask and the well-cleaned NF substrates were immersed vertically into a solution and kept in a hot air oven at 100 °C for 5 hours. After the samples were cooled to ambient temperature, the NiS@ZnS material deposited on Ni foam was washed several times with ethanol and DI water to remove the unwanted particles, and dried in an oven at 90 °C for 2 h. The bare NiS and ZnS materials on the Ni foam substrate were also prepared using the same experimental procedure except for no NiSO4·6H2O or C4H10O6Zn addition. The loaded weights of the bare NiS, ZnS and NiS@ZnS composite were approximately 8 mg, as determined using a microbalance with an accuracy of 0.01 mg.
2.3 Materials characterization
The surface morphology and structure of the crystals were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-2400, Hitachi) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20). Electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed for elemental analysis. The elemental composition and chemical valance states were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at the Busan Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI).
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were performed using a typical three-electrode system in a 3 M KOH aqueous solution. The prepared NiS, ZnS, and NiS@ZnS composite were used as the working electrode; Ag/AgCl and Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. The electrochemical properties were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed using a Biologic-SP150 workstation. CV was performed over the potential range of 0.5 to −0.3 V, at various scan rates of 10, 20, and 30 mV s−1. GCD tests were performed in the same electrolyte for different current densities. The power density (P, W kg−1), specific capacitance (Cs) and energy density (E, W h kg−1) of the samples were calculated from the GCD curves using the following equations: (1) (2) (3)where Cs is the specific capacitance; i is the discharge current; Δt is the discharge time; m is the mass of the electrode material and ΔV is the potential window.
3. Results and discussion
The cabbage leaf like nanostructure of the NiS@ZnS composite on Ni foam was prepared successfully using a facile and low-cost one-step chemical bath deposition technique. Fig. 1(a–i) show the SEM images of the NiS, ZnS, and NiS@ZnS composite materials at different magnifications. Fig. 1(a, b and c) present the FE-SEM images of the NiS electrode after the CBD method for 5 h deposition time at 100 °C, showing a coral reef structure. Fig. 1 presents low magnification images showing the surface uniformity of the NiS, ZnS and NiS@ZnS-based electrodes. The NiS particles were coated uniformly on the substrate, as confirmed from the FE-SEM images in Fig. 1(a and b). As shown in Fig. 1d and e, the ZnS nanosheets separated and staggered with each other, resulting in a rock crystal-like nanostructure with many open spaces that exhibited pseudocapacitive behavior. Fig. 1(f–i) show the FE-SEM images of the NiS@ZnS composite, in which the NiS coral reef and ZnS rock crystal-like nanostructure were staggered with each other on the surface of the Ni foam and resulted in a cabbage leaf like nanostructure. Based on the surface morphologies of NiS and ZnS, it can be deduced that the cabbage leaf like nanostructure of the composite can provide convenient diffusion channels for penetration of the KOH electrolyte and increase the active surface area for redox reactions, which further enhances the transportation efficiency of ions. The higher specific surface area is one of the most important parameters that illustrates the behavior of an active material because the redox reaction takes place on the surface of the material and the superior surface area was further likely to adsorb a larger number of molecules, which could enhance the electrochemical performance.

Fig. 2 shows that TEM images of the NiS (a, a1), ZnS (b, b1) and NiS@ZnS composite (c, c1), which was deposited on a Ni foam substrate. Virtually transparent NiS nanosheets with tiny nanorods and a smooth surface area were observed (Fig. 2a and a1), further revealing the ultrathin features. Fig. 2b1 shows a TEM image of ZnS, which was composed of many nanoflakes that were interconnected with each other to form a rock crystal like nanostructure, revealing a highly porous structure. Fig. 2c and c1 show a TEM image of the NiS@ZnS composite. The NiS tiny nanorods and ZnS nanoflakes were fused together to form a uniform surface that allowed the efficient use of the interspaces allowing the KOH electrolyte ions to access the total surface area of the active materials on the Ni foam substrate simply, and therefore upgraded the utilization rate of the composite electrode.

XPS was carried out for the NiS@ZnS composite to obtain information on the chemical states and surface composition (Fig. 4). Fig. 4a presents the XPS survey spectrum for the NiS@ZnS electrode revealing the presence of five elements, such as Zn 2p3, Ni 2p3, O 1s, C 1s and S 2p. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Zn 2p XPS peaks at 1022.34 eV and 1045.53 eV were assigned to the Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 signals of Zn2+, respectively.20–22 The Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 4c) displayed two main peaks at binding energies of 856.19 eV and 873.68 eV, corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 and two small satellite peaks, which confirmed the existence of nickel species.23,24 As shown in Fig. 4d, the S 2p curve shows two main peaks at binding energies of 162.20 eV and 167.85 eV with a binding energy separation of 5.65 eV, which completely matched with the previous results observed for NiS and ZnS-based materials.25,26 The chemical states and surface composition of pure NiS and ZnS were also examined by XPS. Fig. S1(a)† shows the survey spectrum of both NiS and ZnS electrodes, which revealed the existence of S 2p, C 1s, O 1s and Zn 2p3 for ZnS and S 2p, C 1s, O 1s and Ni 2p3 for NiS electrodes. The Ni 2p spectrum shown in Fig. S1(b)† exhibits two major peaks at 855.8 eV and 873.7 eV, corresponding to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 levels of Ni3+.27,28 Moreover, XPS further confirmed the existence of Zn, Ni and S, which is consistent with the EDX results.

The obtained nanostructures of NiS, ZnS and the NiS@ZnS composite were directly used as working electrodes without adding any conductives and insulting binders. The electrochemical studies of the NiS, ZnS, and NiS@ZnS materials were carried out in a three-electrode system in a 3 M aqueous KOH electrolyte with a potential widow from −0.3 to +0.5 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Fig. 5a shows the area under the CV curve for the NiS@ZnS composite; the area is much larger and there were more well-defined redox peaks compared to that of the bare NiS and ZnS electrodes, which is indicative of their pseudocapacitive characteristics.29,30 The pseudocapacitance of NiS@ZnS was related to the redox reaction between nickel or zinc ions associated with the OH− anion and the integral area of the composite was clearly higher than that of the NiS and ZnS electrodes, which occurred due to the contribution of bimetallic (Ni and Zn)-based metal sulfides.31Fig. 5b and c present CV plots at different scan rates showing a similar shape, and reveal a regularity that the anodic peaks shift towards the positive potential and the cathodic peaks shift towards the negative potential side, which can be attributed to the quasi-reversible characteristics of the redox reactions.32,33 Moreover, the cabbage leaf like nanostructure of the NiS@ZnS composite showed a large specific surface area, which accounted for the higher electron transfer rate and ion diffusion in the composite.

A galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) test was conducted to evaluate the electrochemical capacitance of the NiS, ZnS and NiS@ZnS composite electrodes at different current densities: 7.5, 8.75, 10.0, 11.25, and 12.5 A g−1 in 3 M KOH over the potential range of 0.0 to 0.4 V. It is noticeable that the NiS@ZnS composite shows a greater electrochemical performance at each tested current density. As considered from the FE-SEM images in Fig. 1, the NiS coral reef and ZnS nanosheets show many void places on the substrate which are different from the NiS@ZnS composite. The NiS and ZnS nanostructures with many void places block the electronic/ionic transport, and the specific capacitances also reduced consequently. The pseudocapacitive reaction of the electrode surface was matched well with the discharging time and charging time. According to eqn (1), the specific capacitance of the NiS@ZnS composite was 1533.0, 1370.5, 1299.14, 1239.75, and 1189.64 F g−1 at a current density of 7.5, 8.75, 10.0, 11.25, and 12.5 A g−1 respectively. The corresponding specific capacitances for NiS were 1279.83, 1150.91, 1056.44, 970.5, and 902.22 F g−1, and those for ZnS electrodes were 616.66, 571.08, 538.88, 498.25, and 473.88 F g−1. Moreover, the NiS@ZnS composite electrodes showed higher specific capacitance than the other two electrodes (Fig. 6(c)). The NiS@ZnS composite electrodes give a much longer charge–discharge time than the other samples, indicating an enhanced charge storage mechanism with the growing use of active materials.34,35 In Fig. 6d, the NiS@ZnS composite electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 1533.0 F g−1 at a current density of 7.5 A g−1, which was higher than that of the NiS (1279.83 F g−1) and ZnS electrodes (616.66 F g−1) at the same current density. Additionally, the NiS@ZnS composite also demonstrates excellent rate capability (77.60% capacitance is retained at 12.5 A g−1) which is attributed to the unique sheathing characteristics of both the Ni and Zn ions in majority. The NiS@ZnS electrodes exhibited superior specific capacitance owing to their higher surface area with the improved surface morphology of nanostructures and the conductive Ni foam substrate. CV and GCD tests were performed for the bare Ni foam substrate in the same amount of electrolyte and are shown in the ESI (Fig. S2 and S3†). We concluded that the higher electrochemical performance was attributed to only the active materials of NiS, ZnS and composites.

Compared to NiS and ZnS electrodes, the NiS@ZnS composite displays a nearly triangular shape, demonstrating a perfect capacitive behavior. At higher current density, a small internal resistance (IR) drop is observed compared to lower current density which indicates that the composite has little internal series resistance.36 The coulombic efficiency of the NiS@ZnS composite is also calculated to check the electrode efficacy using eqn (4). (4)where td and tc are the discharge and charge time in GCD curves, respectively. From the GCD curves, it is easily observed that the NiS@ZnS composite has a lower coulombic efficiency at lower current density and these efficiency values are increased from 75.36 to 92.25%, when the current density increased from 7.5 to 12.5 A g−1. This indicates that the higher coulombic efficiency of NiS@ZnS indicates high reversibility and a similar phenomenon was observed by many researchers.36 The enhancement of this efficiency of the composite is ascribed to the large amount of OH− ions in KOH solution transferred through the electrode and it shows high reversibility.37,38
To examine the electrical conductivity, charge transfer rate, and electrolyte diffusion in the electrode and electrolyte interface, EIS was performed over the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at the open-circuit potential with an amplitude of 5 mV in a 3 M KOH solution (Fig. 7). In the high frequency region, the series resistance (Rs) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) were evaluated from the intercepts of the high-frequency pseudo semicircle on the Z′-axis of the Nyquist plot. According to the EIS curves, the Rs value of the NiS@ZnS composite electrode exhibited lower charge transfer resistance than other electrodes. The improved cycling stability of the NiS@ZnS composite was attributed to the lower Rs and Rct values and the small diffusion path, which can support the reversible reactions for higher stability and sustain good electrode reliability when related to the bare ZnS and NiS electrodes.39 Remarkably, no peel off of the material from the Ni foam substrate was observed in the KOH solution after 3000 cycling tests. The composite exhibited an approximately vertical line, which represents the Warburg impedance and corresponds to KOH ion diffusion and transport through the material. The vertical line of the composite revealed less ionic diffusion resistance because the synergetic effects of NiS and ZnS can increase the surface area of the active material and provide more active sites.40 EIS also showed that the NiS@ZnS composite has an excellent rate capability. According to the previous reports, the composite owns a higher electrical conductivity than bare NiS and ZnS films, which can be the major reason for the observed higher specific capacitance of NiS@ZnS.41,42 Conversely, the inferior charge transfer resistance of the NiS@ZnS composite may be ascribed to the greater surface morphology on the Ni foam substrate, which benefits quick ion transfer.

The Ragone plot (Fig. 8) shows the energy density and power density of the NiS, ZnS, and NiS@ZnS electrodes calculated using the GCD results, according to eqn (2) and (3) in the Experimental section. The NiS, ZnS and composite material delivered a maximum energy density of 25.65, 16.82, and 35.21 W h kg−1 with an average power density of 1251.47 W kg−1. The composite material integrated strongly on the Ni foam substrate and the effective electrical contact, leading to improved rate properties.

The cycling stability of the supercapacitors was examined by performing cyclic charge–discharge experiments up to 3000 cycles. The specific capacitance of the NF/NiS@ZnS composite increased from 1533.0 F g−1 to 1543.9 F g−1 for the first few hundred cycles because of the activation of the composite caused by the enhanced contact area between the NF/NiS@ZnS composite and the KOH electrolyte during cycling. As shown in Fig. 9, the specific capacitance of the NiS@ZnS composite decreased slowly from 1543.9 F g−1 to 1189.64 F g−1 after 3000 cycles that of NiS decreased from 1279.83 F g−1 to 902.22 F g−1 and that of ZnS decreased from 616.66 F g−1 to 473.88 F g−1 at a current density of 7.5 A g−1. The NiS@ZnS electrode exhibited excellent cycling stability with approximately 97.9% capacitance retention (approximately 2.1% loss), whereas 91.2% and 83.4% were observed for the NiS and ZnS electrodes, indicating a distinguished electrochemical stability of the NiS@ZnS composite and it can be applied in practical energy storage device applications. The decreased cycling stability of bare NiS and ZnS electrodes might be due to the structural breakdown of the active material caused by enormous ion intercalation/de-intercalation. Moreover, the top view HR-SEM image of the NiS@ZnS composite after 3000 cycles is also shown in the ESI (Fig. S4†). No surface variation or degradation was observed in the composite, indicating enhanced electrochemical stability for higher stability applications at high current densities.43,44 These results highlight the high performance, and greater long-term cycling stability of the CuS@PbS composite electrode.

The outstanding electrochemical performance of the NiS@ZnS composite was attributed to the following reasons: (1) the synergistic effect between the NiS and ZnS material facilitates electron transport during charge–discharge cycles because of its higher electrical conductivity; (2) the cabbage leaf like nanostructure of the NiS@ZnS composite and the Ni foam substrate with zigzag flow channels and micro holes is advantageous for electrolyte diffusion and electron transport, which can stimulate the electrochemical properties; and (3) the NiS@ZnS composite increases the specific surface area compared to the bare NiS and ZnS electrodes, resulting in a greater capacitance.45 As a result, the composite can display higher electrochemical properties. Moreover, the specific capacitance reported in this work is much better than many previously reported bare and composite materials as summarized in Table 1.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a cabbage leaf like nanostructure of the NiS@ZnS composite was fabricated on Ni foam by a facile chemical bath deposition method. Owing to its well-defined surface morphology, rapid electronic conductive pathways, higher surface area, lower charge transfer resistance, more active sites for the electrochemical reaction and synergetic effects of NiS and ZnS, the composite exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 1533.0 F g−1 at a current density of 7.5 A g−1, a maximum energy density of 35.21 W h kg−1, a capacitance loss of only 2.1% after 3000 cycles, and remarkable rate capability. Considering the enhanced electrochemical properties and easy electrode preparation method at low cost and low temperatures, this composite material has potential applications as efficient electrode materials in various fields, such as energy conversion and storage, and wearable and portable electronics.
