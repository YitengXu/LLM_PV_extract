The high consumption and unregulated discharge of carcinogenic BTE and neurotoxic X have heavily impacted the environment and water quality. Sorptive separation of BTEX from the aqueous phase is cost-effective and easy to operate; however, slower uptake, adsorbent saturation, and complexity in sorbent regeneration are primary limitations. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) offer faster kinetics, reusability, and better efficiency to eliminate BTEX. However, the economics, sustainability, and large-scale extensibility of AOPs need to be verified. In this context, the current review discusses recent developments in aqueous BTEX removal by sorption and AOPs. Life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis of various treatment technologies was carried out to verify the environmental compliances of the process. Based on the single point score, the sustainability ranking of the treatment technologies was: adsorption (Ads.) (0.48), ozonation (1.90), electrochemical oxidation (EO) (4.82), photocatalysis (5.43), Fenton's (7.87), ultrasound-peroxymonosulphate (US-PMS) (31.8), acoustic cavitation (AuC) (228), and hydrodynamic cavitation (HdC) (245). The lower the impact score, the higher is the sustainability of the technology to treat BTEX. Overall, this review identifies the research gaps and boosts the researchers to find out the feasibility of the proposed suggestion to minimize the pollution of hazardous BTEX.Kowsalya VellingiriDr. Kowsalya Vellingiri obtained her M.Sc. from the P.S.G.R.

Water impact
Owing to the water stress, the removal of contaminants from water and wastewater is becoming a priority area of interest. Industries act as a point source of wastewater pollution, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the primary contaminants. Considering the toxicity and mobility, the removal of VOCs such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene is mandatory. A traditional tertiary treatment option such as adsorption is environmentally and economically beneficial for VOCs. However, identification of a suitable adsorbent with higher adsorption capacity and maximum regeneration with a simple desorption method is essential. On the other hand, handling of high concentrations of VOCs warrants destructive technologies such as an advanced oxidation process to cut down the secondary pollution caused by the spent concentrated adsorbent. Therefore, a brief outlook related to the adsorption capacity of different adsorbents and treatment efficacy of different degradation methodologies may create an insight to select affordable, sustainable treatment methods to remove VOCs from water and wastewater.

1. Introduction
The gradual upsurge in population and associated changes in lifestyle have increased the production and use of petrochemical products, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, paint, food additives, leather, etc. The manufacture of these commodities produces many organic solvents,1,2 collectively called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are emitted into the environment.3 Benzene (B), toluene (T), ethylbenzene (E), and xylene (X), commonly known as BTEX, have emerged as persistent, hazardous, and carcinogenic VOCs.4 Primarily BTEX are discharged from industries, accidental spills, and pipeline leakages (Table 1).

The World Health Organization (WHO) has included BTE in the potential carcinogen list.5 The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry6 reported the neurotoxic ability of X.7,8 The consumption of BTEX contaminated water causes health hazards such as endocrine disruptions,9 cancer,10 and damage to the central nervous system.11 The results of studies by Sivasankar and Gopalakrishna12 indicated that the consumption of groundwater collected near petrol filling stations induced the risk of cancer in 23 out of 10000 adult receptors. The cancer risk of children residing in a BTEX contaminated region in China was found to be higher than the allowable health risk limit of 1-in-1 million.13 Apart from this site-specific oral consumption, accidental spills (e.g., rupture of oil storage tanks) adversely increased the cancer risk. Without proper control measures, BTEX can induces chronic health risks (e.g., central nervous system damage).14
There is a high concentration of BTEX in the aqueous phase is due to their relatively higher water solubility and low logKOW. According to the WHO drinking water guidelines, the permissible limits of B, T, E, and X are 10, 700, 300, and 500 μg L−1, respectively (Table 2). Similarly, the United States Primary Drinking Water Standards and European Commission (EC) water framework directive 2000/60/EC have recommended permissible limits of B, T, E, and X of 5, 1000, 700, and 10000 μg L−1 and 10, 50, 30, and 30 μg L−1, respectively. Hence, the existence of higher BTEX concentrations than the permissible limits results in significant exposure of the general public and subsequent health risks. A recent study by Rajasekhar et al.15 indicated that the regular consumption of aquifer water contaminated with B and naphthalene increased the cancer risk by ∼89% in Chennai, India. Specifically, the children under the age group of 0 to 5 years displayed cancer risk even at a short exposure period (>3 years). Therefore, developing efficient water and wastewater treatment processes is necessary to eliminate the negative impacts of BTEX and their metabolites.

This article presents a comprehensive review of adsorption and AOP based treatment options for BTEX removal. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to understand the environmental compliances of the different treatment options to remove BTEX. Additionally, an overview of existing large-scale treatment systems for BTEX removal from groundwater, petroleum wastewater, and oil-spill contaminated surface water is provided. Finally, the challenges restricting the development of efficient, easily adaptable, and sustainable tertiary treatment for BTEX are discussed. Overall, the current comprehensive review may act as a catalyst to identify the best treatment method for removing BTEX from water and wastewater.
Why do we need a better treatment technology?
The detected concentration of BTEX in the aqueous environment was in the range of 5–27000 μg L−1.16 For example, Mohammadi et al.17 reported BTEX concentrations of 0.15–2.1 mg L−1 in effluents of the petrochemical industries of Iran. Also, Asejeje et al.1 reported BTEX concentrations in the range of 0.2–3.3 mg L−1 and 4.3–144 mg kg−1 in surface water and sediment samples of Ubeji Creek, Nigeria. The site contaminated with oil spills reported a BTEX level in the range of 4200–74000 μg L−1 (Table 1). More importantly, these reported environmental concentrations of BTEX are several times higher than guideline values.
Water and wastewater treatment plants operated with conventional biological systems like activated sludge showed 60–74% BTEX removal.18,19 Using a mixture of cultures ∼90–95% of BTEX removal was achieved. Further increase in residence time results in complete removal.9 For example, a microbial consortium enriched with Chryseobacterium and Rhodobacter provided faster degradation of BTEX.20 However, the intermediates of biological treatment caused toxicity in the microbial community.21,22 For example, Zhou et al.23 reported the inhibition effects of BTEX on Acinetobacter baumannii DD1. This reduced the treatment efficiency in the long run. You et al.24 showed 20% BTEX mineralization using Rhodococcus sp. ZJUT312, but ∼59% of BTEX accumulation was observed within the bacterium. This shows that biological treatments are inadequate for BTEX removal. Thus, tertiary treatment options such as adsorption or AOPs are required to remove the toxic BTEX from water and wastewater. In this context, adsorption and AOPs to remove aqueous BTEX have been immensely explored. The cost-effective and easy to scale-up nature of adsorption has resulted in effective sorption of BTEX on materials like carbonaceous adsorbents,25 zeolites,26 and polymeric resin.27 Similarly, with the aim of mineralizing BTEX, traditional and emergent AOPs such as Fenton's,28 photocatalysis,29,30 pulse power plasma technology,31,32 and cavitation33,34 have been validated. However, the field-scale application, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of these treatment methodologies for BTEX removal are not yet determined in large-scale applications. So, more studies are needed to improve the current BTEX treatment technologies.
2. Sorptive separation
The removal of BTEX from water via sorption is a challenging task due to their different physicochemical properties like solubility, polarity, and molecular size. Achieving similar adsorption capacities for B, T, E, and X via a common adsorbent is difficult. In this line, functionalizing agents are used to boost the adsorption performances via composite formation. In this section, the effectiveness of various adsorbents employed for the removal of BTEX is discussed. A comprehensive summary of adsorbents and composites found to remove BTEX from water and wastewater is provided in Table 3.

2.1. Activated carbon
The ease of availability, low cost, and higher sorption capacity are major reasons for choosing activated carbon (AC) for BTEX removal from an aqueous solution. In recent years, AC prepared from waste materials (e.g., municipal solid and plastic waste) and biomasses (e.g., sawdust, seeds, and shells of fruits) have gained attention. It also enables waste management and water remediation at an affordable cost.25,66 However, the sorption capacity of AC derived from agricultural waste (1 to 9 mg g−1) is nearly ten times lower than that of commercial AC (110–150 mg g−1). This could be due to irregular pore size and pore volume or limited functionalization of waste-derived AC.45 In this context, modification of the surface properties of AC by adding oxygen-containing functional groups has been carried out. The treatment of AC with acids (e.g., H3PO4, HNO3, and HCl/HF) improved the specific surface area (SSA) and porosity/pore volume.25,45 The AC prepared from almond shells (AS), date pits (DP), and olive stones (OS) were treated with H3PO4 (50%), and the SSA was found to be in the range of 771 (DP)–1346 (PS) m2 g−1.45 The acid treatment introduced about 0.6% of the acidic group per nm2 of AC, i.e., approximately 90–95% of carboxylic acid groups were introduced. Accordingly, DP with a narrower pore size (0.301 cm3 g−1) possessed larger acidic functional groups (1.335 μmol m−2) followed by OS (1.163 μmol m−2) and AS (0.642 μmol m−2). The BTEX adsorption capacities of OS, DP, and AS were 27.9, 25.6, and 20.2 mg g−1 with the adsorption order of B < T < E < X.45 OS holding the lowest surface area possessed more acidic functional groups, and it displayed higher adsorption capacity than DP and AS owing to their π–π-electron-donor–acceptor interactions. Specifically, the oxygen present in the carboxylic acid group enriched the electron density on the AC. On the other hand, BTEX tend to be positively charged in the pH range of 3–12, which results in the electron-donor–acceptor interactions.
Similarly, AC derived from coconut shell showed superior adsorption for BTX (115, 125, and 141 mg g−1). The favourable molecular configuration of X (e.g., kinetic size and dipole moment) compared to B and T allowed retention-free diffusion into the mesopores of AC (derived from coconut shell).25 This concludes that the surface functional properties and the pore features of AC are the two important parameters deciding the degree of electron donor–acceptor and diffusion mechanisms.67
Oxidizing agents like sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), and complexing agents such as citric acid (CA) and tartaric acid (TA) improved the specific surface properties like the surface area, pore-volume, and pore size distributions of pristine AC. For instance, the surface area and total pore volume of oxidized AC (O-AC) are 872 m2 g−1 and 0.59 cm3 g−1, respectively, and it is 1.67 and 1.44 times higher than pristine AC.66 The existence of basic and acidic sites in O-AC helps in achieving similar adsorption profiles for highly soluble (polarity) compounds like B (261 mg g−1), T (263 mg g−1), and molecularly configured and hydrophobic p-X (270 mg g−1)66via π–π and H-bonding interactions.68 At pH < pHzpc, AC exists in the protonated form and increases the adsorbate–adsorbent interaction via electrostatic attraction. But deprotonation occurs at pH > pHzpc, which diminishes the adsorption capacity via electrostatic repulsion. Therefore, O-AC showed maximum adsorption at acidic pH (5), and maintaining this pH level is not easy in practical settings as it requires additional chemicals and buffers. In addition, the electrostatic and π–π interactions of the adsorbent and BTEX may not be evident in the real scenario. Real wastewater is a complex mixture of diverse organic compounds with varying charges on the surface. In such circumstances, the selective surface interactions between the adsorbent (e.g., O-AC) and BTEX are not evident because of interference developed by other organic molecules present in the wastewater. In this line, the surface interactions might be reduced; subsequently, the adsorption capacity of BTEX is reduced. This deviation in the surface properties of the adsorbate in the presence of other pollutants should be considered while investigating BTEX removal from the mixed matrix system (e.g., wastewater). A new form of carbon material called ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) with a higher effective surface area (>1500 m2 g−1), narrow pore diameter (1–11 nm), enhanced pore volume (1.79 cm3 g−1), and thermal stability (500–600 °C) is a better option for BTEX sorption. The presence of narrow pores improves the diffusivity of BTEX (171 mg g−1) at near-neutral pH (7.5) via an ion-exchange mechanism.46 Nevertheless, the equilibration time required for OMC is comparatively higher (36–48 h) than that for AC (1–8 h), and this increases the capital expenditure. Furthermore, modification of OMC with acids such as boric, nitric, and CAs was not satisfactory either (Table 3).47 Hence, the only merit of OMC was its structural stability and adsorption of BTEX at neutral pH. Further functionalization of OMC with hetero atoms like nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) is a viable option for improving its kinetics for BTEX adsorption.69
In a nutshell, the larger pore size and oxygen-containing functional groups of AC positively affect the adsorption of BTEX. The chemical functionalization by oxidizing agents (e.g., nitric acid) significantly improves the sorption capacity of AC towards B and T. However, the formation of reinforced layers decreases the lifespan and regeneration possibilities of modified AC. Pore blockage and pH-dependent absorptivity of AC also restrict its usage in an adsorbent column.
2.2. Zeolites and clay materials
Zeolites are alumina silicates with a three-dimensional structure, composed of [AlO4]5− and [SiO4]5−.50 The corners of zeolites are connected via oxygen, thus developing a framework with regular pores and channels.49 However, the hydrophilic feature of the zeolite restricts the removal of organic compounds via ion exchange, molecular sieving, and diffusion mechanisms.49,50 The surface area and hydrophobicity of the zeolite can be improved via mechanical size reduction and chemical treatment using a surfactant.51 Size reduction using ball milling improves the surface-to-volume ratio of the zeolite. Further, the chemical treatment with a surfactant, i.e., hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA), decreases the length of the diffusion path and offers better accessibility for the adsorbate to the internal pores of the zeolite.70 This kind of post-modification strategy of zeolites significantly improves their adsorption behaviour towards polar (B and T) and non-polar VOCs (E and X) at neutral pH.
Granulation of zeolite modified with a surfactant, i.e., HDTMA and n-cetylpyridinium (CPB), showed similar removal kinetics for both polar VOCs (B and T) and non-polar VOCs (E and X).49 However, the synthetic zeolites (sodium doped Zeolite Socony Mobil-5: Na-ZSM-5) showed better performance (38.7 mg g−1) than the surfactant modified form (SMZ-100: 33.1 mg g−1).51 Surface modification causes pore blockages which decreases the surface area and pore size of the modified adsorbent. For example, the surface area and total pore volume of Na-ZSM-5 (439 m2 g−1 and 0.23 cm3 g−1) were higher than those of SMZ-100 (252 m2 g−1 and 0.16 cm3 g−1). Also, the micropore diameter of Na-ZSM-5 was similar (6.9 Å) to the kinetic size of BTEX (6.7–6.8 Å), which offered a favourable diffusion path by amplifying the sorption capacity.51 Similarly, the Greek natural zeolite (51.8 mg g−1) performed better than the fly ash-derived zeolite (Na-P1: 0.23 mg g−1).50
For both natural and synthetic/modified zeolites, the overall order of adsorption was B > T > E > X. The presence of Al and silanol groups provides hydrophilic properties to zeolite, and it adsorbs B and T via intra crystalline mass transfer reactions.71 Hence, the key merits of zeolitic materials are abundant availability, easy processability, adaptability towards surface modification, and increased absorptivity for B. Nevertheless, the adsorption capacity of zeolitic materials is relatively low in comparison with the commercially available AC. The hydrophilic surface and larger pore aperture of zeolite (e.g., >6.8 Å) hinder the interaction of BTEX with its surface functional groups. This kind of surface barrier can be rectified through composite formation. For example, the addition of sintered metal fibers to zeolite reduced the internal mass transfer resistance and increased the adsorption of VOCs (e.g., propane).72 Therefore, providing surface heterogeneity in zeolite via composite formation is an effective and easy way to improve its adsorption capacity for BTEX.
Like zeolites, clay materials are another low-cost alternatives for AC. Natural clays (e.g., smectite) possess layered structures, hydrophilic centers, and high efficiency, which promotes the adsorption of BTEX via electron donor–acceptor mechanisms.52 The cumulative adsorption capacity of smectite for BTEX (∼9 mg L−1, pH: 9, and 1 h) was 2.67 mg g−1 (ref. 52), and it was higher than that of the thermally modified diatomite (2 mg g−1)73 and type-II organoclay (0.01 mg g−1 at 15 h).54 Nevertheless, the overall adsorption capacity of the clay-based material is less than AC due to its Brønsted and Lewis centers.74 This limitation can be overcome by modifying the surface of the clay with inorganic surfactants such as quaternary ammonium cation.75 These cationic surfactants increase the hydrophobicity of the clays by adding [(CH3)3NR]+ groups. The non-ionic surfactant polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified montmorillonite (Mt) showed almost six times higher adsorption (18.8 mg g−1at pH 7) than smectite.53 The superiority of Mt-PEG was due to the hydrophobic sites created by PEG. This was confirmed by the decreased –OH bending vibration characteristic of a sorbed water molecule (1635 cm−1) and increased interlayer spacing (raw Mt: 0.12 nm and Mt-PEG: 0.17 nm). The intercalation of the surfactant onto the clay lowered the surface area of PEG-Mt (26.2 m2 g−1) compared with raw Mt (32.6 m2 g−1). Smectite had better reaction kinetics than PEG-Mt, because smectite removed 2.67 mg g−1 of BTEX within 1 h, while PEG Mt took 24 h to remove 18.8 mg g−1. Overall, the dominant mechanism of clay-based materials against BTEX was governed by partitioning and surface adsorption/precipitation, while diffusion played only a minor role.76
Weak van der Waals forces comprise the interaction of BTEX on the clay. Accordingly, the strength of dipole and polarity of the aromatic molecule decide the strength of van der Waals interactions with AC. Also, the interlayer distance of smectite is relatively smaller (2.9 Å) than BTEX, limiting the diffusion of BTEX to the micropores of smectite.77 This restricts the chemisorption of BTEX over the clay materials and helps in the regeneration of clay-based materials. Therefore, from the regeneration perspective, clay-based materials are more profitable than AC.
2.3. Biomass
Pristine biomaterials are often recommended as adsorbents for organic pollutants due to their relatively low cost, lower toxicity, and smaller aggregation nature.78 In this regard, ostrich bone waste (OBW) was used for treating BTEX after modifying it with chelating agents (e.g., CA).56 Covalent insertion of CA on OBW increased the electrostatic and H-bonding interactions via carboxylic acid groups. OBW–CA showed excellent removal efficiency for BTEX (1410 mg g−1) at neutral pH. OBW–CA was much better than biomass made from agricultural by-products like angico sawdust (0.024 mg g−1) and peat (0.026 mg g−1).55 It can be assumed that increasing the hydrophobicity of waste-derived AC with suitable agents (e.g., NaOH and CA) improves the carboxylic acid groups on the active surface.79 These active sites induce selective electrostatic interaction between OBW-NaOH–CA and BTEX (Fig. 1).55 OBW-NaOH–CA showed effective removal of BTEX (25 mg L−1 from the Persian Gulf water (e.g., B-58.1 to X-99.9%)). Overall, the modification of OBW with CA and NaOH results in pore opening; consequently, it increases the active sites in the surfaces. Furthermore, the carboxylic acid groups in CA act as electron donors and the aromatic ring in the BTEX molecules acts as an electron acceptor.45 So, π–π electron-donor–acceptor interactions are the primary mechanism of OBW-NaOH–CA to adsorb BTEX.
 Fig. 1  Change in a) hydrophobicity and b) surface charges of OBW-NaOH–CA with respect to B and X. Reproduced with permission from ref. 56 Copyright Royal Society of Chemistry, 2011. 
The presence of aliphatic and aromatic groups in the peat increased the interaction with BTEX.55 Such interactions are effective in removing BTEX from complex matrices such as water separated from crude oil production (e.g., produced water). The BTEX removal efficiencies of peat and angico sawdust in produced water were B-32.4 to X-67.8% and B-20.2 to X-57.8%, respectively.55 The reduced removal efficiency of peat with respect to OBW-NaOH–CA is due to dissimilar surface functional groups. The peat surface is decorated with aliphatic and aromatic functional groups, while OBW-NaOH–CA is rich in –COOH, –OH, and aromatic groups.55,56 In this regard, the presence of –COOH and aromaticity in OBW-NaOH–CA promotes BTEX adsorption via π–π electron-donor–acceptor interactions. It is important to mention that oxygen present in –COOH increases the electron density of OBW-NaOH–CA and serves as an electron donor.56 On the other hand, the weakly positive charge of the aromatic ring in BTEX serves as an electron acceptor.55 It should be noted that peat, angico sawdust, and OBW-NaOH–CA showed an unaltered adsorption capacity in the presence of interfering ions (e.g., Cl−, Br−, NO3−, SO42−, Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+).55 This indicates their ability to selectively adsorb BTEX even in a complex matrix.
Similar to AC, biomass-derived adsorbents capture BTEX at neutral pH. Yet, the pristine biomass-based materials possess lower adsorption capacity and a narrow adsorption range for BTEX. Increasing the hydrophobic properties of the biomass via functionalization may improve the adsorption capacity for BTEX. The regeneration of biomass-based materials under thermal swing desorption resulted in pore destruction and fewer surface-active sites, indicating their incompetence in repeated use. Because of their antagonistic effect, disposal of biomass-based adsorbents requires special care. Or else, it shall cause secondary pollution in the environment. Above all, the adsorption mechanism of biomass-derived materials is not well recognized. This calls for future research.
2.4. Carbon nanotubes (CNT)
CNT are one-dimensional macro-sized molecules with many surface functional groups. As-synthesized CNT consist of carbon and metallic impurities that restrict guest molecules' penetration into their micropores and limit the adsorption efficiency. Various surface modification strategies (e.g., thermal oxidation, microwave-assisted activation, and chemical oxidation) are commonly employed to remove impurities and open the caps/kinks of CNT. Accordingly, chemical oxidation is the most practiced method for CNT activation because it introduces various oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., lactone, quinone, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl). For this purpose, HNO3, KMnO4, H2O2, KOH, and NaOCl are often used as reagents. The evident opening of the head and tails of the hollow inner tubes of CNT was observed after interaction with NaOCl,57 HNO3,59 and KOH60 (Fig. 2a–c). This opening of end caps also results in a gradual enhancement in the surface area and porosity. Among various chemically treated CNT, CNT-NaOCl created maximum carboxylic acid functional groups (1.04) on the surface, followed by CNT-HNO3 (0.61), CNT-H2SO4 (0.29), CNT (0.16), and CNT-HCl (0.10).57 Owing to the greater number of carboxylic acid functional groups, CNT-NaOCl showed superior adsorption for BTEX. CNT-HCl and CNT-H2SO4 had basic characteristics, whereas the other three modified forms had acidic characteristics.57 However, the prolonged reflux to these oxidizing agents causes the deposition of carbon impurities on the surface of CNT. This acts as a barrier and will reduce the penetrability of the organic molecules.59 Moreover, the acidic property of CNT develops H-bonding with oxygen-containing functional groups and forms the molecular shield at alkaline pH.80 So, the maximum adsorption of organic pollutants using CNT can be achieved at neutral pH.

Owing to the large number of carboxylic acid functional groups, CNT-NaOCl showed superior adsorption for BTEX compared to CNT-HNO3, CNT-HCl, CNT-H2SO4, and CNT-KOH.48,57,60 Under neutral pH, the surface charge of CNT-NaOCl is negative (zeta potential: −51.2 mV) whereas, under the same conditions, BTEX is positively charged (0.0001 mmol mg−1).57 Therefore, carboxylic acid groups act as electron-rich centres and aromatic BTEX molecules act as electron acceptors (Fig. 2d).57 Additionally, surface carboxylic acid groups result in the monolayer formation of BTEX on the surface of CNT via π–π electron-donor–acceptor interactions.61 So, thermal swing desorption is used to regenerate the spent CNT. The degree of desorption in the thermal swing process is inversely proportional to the boiling point of the adsorbate, i.e., the higher the boiling point, the lower the desorption.53 The desorption of adsorbed molecules destroys the porous nature of CNT. Thus, successive adsorption of BTEX takes different paths to identify the vacant active sites causing adsorption/desorption hysteresis,61 which will eventually decrease the adsorption efficiency of CNT on repeated use. The material cost of the CNT is 150 USD per g, which is higher than the commercially available AC (1 USD per kg).81 So, regeneration of spent CNT is essential to reduce the cost of the treatment. From the literature, it has been concluded that composite formation enhances the regeneration capacity of CNT. For example, CNT-carbon dot-based composites showed excellent carbamazepine adsorption and reusability (2.2% reduction at the 6th run).82 Combining MnO2 with N-doped CNT improved formaldehyde adsorption and regeneration.83 The presence of oxygen groups in MnO2 was the prime factor that enhanced the reusability of CNT. But, the reported toxicity of CNT towards biological samples (e.g., loss of enzymatic activity and protein degradation) was higher than that of silica.84 So, composite formation using a less toxic material (e.g., clay) is required to reduce the toxicity of CNT while supporting adsorption and regeneration.
2.5. Covalent organic polymers
Carbonaceous (AC, OMC, CNT, and graphene oxide (GO)) and traditional materials (zeolites and clay) have limited surface functionality but increased pore diversity. The adsorption of BTEX is mainly governed by molecular sieving and electron-based interactions (electron donor–acceptor or π–π interactions). So, preparing a modern adsorbent with superior surface/pore characteristics and tuneable functionality is beneficial. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are inorganic moieties that bond with organic nodes, creating a prerequisite structural design for specific applications.85 The BTEX treatment was done using water stable UiO-66 MOFs.63 UiO-66 possesses a hydrophilic functional group (e.g., carboxylic acid groups). To increase the hydrophobicity of UiO-66, fluorine doping was done. The formed UiO-66-F4 showed reduced crystallinity, thermal stability, and surface area compared with UiO-66. The decreased surface functionality in UiO-66-F4 reduced its adsorption (mg g−1) on T (22.5), E (41.5), and X (59.2) compared with UiO-66 (e.g., T: 58.5, E: 51.3, and X: 147).63 The increased attraction of X towards UiO-66 was due to π–π interactions. However, in B adsorption, the efficiency of UiO-66-F4 (76.3 mg g−1) was 2.3 times better than that of UiO-66 (34.1 mg g−1). The decreased pore size of UiO-66-F4 enables stress-free diffusion of B.63 Wang et al.86 also observed a similar observation using Cu2L (L: 3,3′,5,5′-tetraethyl-4,4′-bipyrazolate). Both UiO-66 and UiO-66-F4 showed excellent reusability with simple thermal regeneration (120 °C for 72 h). This shows that these materials have the potential to treat real BTEX contaminated water (e.g., produced water) successfully. Another covalent organic framework (COF), namely thiol-functionalized-COF (COF-S-SH), showed extraordinary kinetics (<5 min for adsorption equilibrium) in the adsorption of BTEX (B: 150, T: 197, E: 242, and X: 227 mg g−1).64 COF-S-SH also exhibited constant regeneration capability (<10% reduction in adsorption capacity at the 5th cycle) after solvent and thermal treatment (e.g., methanol and HCl (6 M) at 50 °C). It displayed a high efficiency (B-63.6% to E-95.3%) in simulated sewage water. The underlying mechanisms of these MOFs are π–π staking and hydrophobic interactions.64 Researchers exploring new MOFs with suitable physicochemical properties are at a preliminary level only. This might be due to the instability of MOFs in aqueous solution (e.g., MOF-5) and their associated structural collapse at a slight variation in the working parameters (e.g., pH and temperature).87 On the other hand, the aggregation-free nature and easy immobilization of MOF/COFs with a porous material (e.g., zeolite foam or copper foam) open a new area of research on recoverable adsorbents for field applications.88,89
2.6. Polymeric resins
The polymeric resin has better functional properties than other adsorbents. It facilitates host–guest formation through various interactions.90 Pristine polymeric resin is hydrophilic and it is not suitable for adsorbing BTEX. Surface modification of resin is needed before usage. For this, β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) was cross-linked with poly(butyl methacrylate) resin(poly(BMA-β-CD)).27 β-CD was selected due to its hydrophobic internal cavity and hydrophilic external sites.91 This kind of structural diversity gives them higher stability in wider pH and ionic strength. The cumulative adsorption capacity of BMA-β-CD for BTEX (0.06 mg L−1) was 72.6 mg g−1 (24 h), and it was in the order of X-20.2 mg g−1, E-18.5 mg g−1, T-17.6 mg g−1, and B-16.3 mg g−1. The adsorption order shows that hydrophobic–hydrophobic interaction was the dominant mechanism, and the presence of –CH2– as repeating units attracted BTEX molecules near the surface of BMA-β-CD.27 The most exciting poly(BMA-β-CD) feature was its recovery and reusability due to its low particle density. It showed no reduction in the adsorption capacity until the 8th consecutive adsorption–desorption cycle. The use of ethanol as a solvent for regeneration is also helpful. Purosorb™ (PAD-910) polymeric resin was also used to adsorb BTEX (5.86 mg L−1). It exhibited a cumulative adsorption efficiency of 47.5 mg g−1, which was 1.53 times lower than poly(BMA-β-CD).65 The most prominent feature of polymeric resin over other adsorbents mentioned above is its ability to adsorb low-concentrations of BTEX. This quality helps in making VOC control filters for industrial purposes.92 Also, combining the polymeric resin with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) promoted faster diffusion of VOCs over water molecules.93 These composites are helpful in the treatment of VOCs in groundwater due to their superior selectivity. Recent progress in the development of polymeric resin composites for VOC trapping has shown that cross-linking heteroatoms (e.g., N or S) improved the π–π dispersive interactions, which further traps the polar VOCs (B and T).94 However, their usefulness is restricted due to the complicated synthesis protocol and the need for many chemical precursors.
2.7. Treatment cost and summary of adsorption technologies for BTEX removal
Adsorption using carbonaceous materials (e.g., AC, biomass, and CNT), traditional adsorbents (e.g., zeolite and clay), polymeric resin, and modern adsorbents (MOFs and COFs) was studied. The common mechanisms for these adsorbents were π–π electron-donor–acceptor interactions. The hydrophobic characteristics of the adsorbent were identified as a key parameter in the treatment of selected VOCs. The adsorption preference has followed the order; X > E > T > B except for zeolite (B > T > E > X). The hydrophilic property of the zeolite was responsible for the higher uptake of B.
The cost of the adsorption process for treating BTEX was calculated from the production and utilization cost of the adsorbent.95 The limited availability of information about precursors and functionalization agents restricted the cost calculation for composite materials, e.g., (poly(BMA-Co-CD)). AC prepared from agricultural waste materials, e.g., coconut-shell derived AC, showed lower treatment cost (0.5 USD per m3) than commercial AC (1.5 USD per m3). Further functionalization of AC increased the treatment cost to 2.8 USD per m3. The treatment cost of other traditional adsorbents such as smectite (19.8 USD per m3) and surfactant modified zeolite (10.7 USD per m3) was relatively higher than that AC as a higher dosage was needed to achieve greater than 90% BTEX removal.51,52 Adsorbents such as CNT functionalized with carboxylic acid groups and UiO-66 offered faster reaction kinetics but with higher production (material) cost (e.g., CNT: 150 USD per g and UiO-66200 USD per g), which subsequently increased the treatment cost.48,63 AC derived from agricultural waste has higher functional groups, surface area, and pore volume and is helpful in further cost reduction. Therefore, AC is a feasible low-cost adsorbent material to treat BTEX.
As a general observation, composite formation is a viable option to rectify the problems associated with the pristine adsorbents (e.g., promoting adsorption and recycling performances). Nevertheless, the research in this area is at the toddler level, and only a few composites have been developed and tested in the pilot level so far. The common limitations for the development of sorption technology are the knowledge gap on the following: a) the structural characterization of the adsorbent after adsorption, b) the possible reusability and suggestions for the safe disposal of the spent adsorbent, c) the immobilization of the solid sorbent onto the stable solid matrix for effective separation, d) the toxicity of the test solution prior to and after adsorption, e) the pathway of the adsorbent in the environment and biota, and f) the sorption efficiency in the presence of multiple real samples (e.g., industrial wastewater, groundwater, or lake water). The above-mentioned points affect the success of studies in developing a new adsorbent for BTEX or integrating the adsorbents to enhance the existing sorbent performance.
3. Advanced oxidation processes
Conventional treatment technologies offer only moderate removal of BTEX. Therefore, it is important to develop alternative treatment options to enhance the BTEX removal efficiency. AOPs have faster reaction kinetics and higher mineralization efficiency. The generation of by-products remains a common demerit. So, careful selection of the oxidant and catalyst helps to minimize the generation of by-products. In-depth knowledge of current AOP-based treatment for removing BTEX from water and wastewater is essential to achieve that goal. This section discusses the treatment results of BTEX in water and wastewater using AOPs such as photocatalysis, ozonation, Fenton-based systems, electrochemical oxidation, cavitation, and pulse power technology (Table 4).

3.1. Fenton-based technologies
Fenton technology is one of the widely studied processes for the remediation of persistent pollutants in practical settings.126 In the Fenton process, ˙OH is created from the reaction of H2O2 and Fenton's reagent (e.g., Fe2+) (eqn (1) and (2)), and it degrades BTEX via an electron transfer mechanism127 (Fig. 3a). Fe2+ + H2O2 + (aq) → Fe3+ + ˙OH + OH−(1) Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + HO2˙ + H+(2) 2CaO2 + 2H2O → 2Ca(OH)2 + O2(3) CaO2 + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2↓ + H2O2(4)Though H2O2 produces ˙OH, its low stability and need for a high concentration to treat BTEX limits its usage in Fenton-based applications. So, researchers tried using calcium peroxide (CaO2) as a source of H2O2.128 CaO2 is an oxygen donor. It reacts with water yielding H2O2 in the solution (eqn (3) and (4)). This H2O2 further reacts with the Fenton reagent (Fe2+) and generates ˙OH radicals.129 The working pH range of the CaO2-based Fenton system is wider than that of the traditional Fenton-reaction.99
 Fig. 3  Mechanism of a) Fenton and b) electro-Fenton processes for the degradation of organic pollutants. 
CaO2/Fe2+ in the molar ratio of 40/40 showed BTEX removal in the range, B-95% to X-98%, in 60 min at neutral pH.99 When ultrapure water was replaced with actual groundwater, the BTEX degradation efficiency dropped to 88%. Co-existing anions (e.g., HCO3− and SO42−) acted as ˙OH scavengers and reduced the availability of ˙OH in the bulk solution. Similarly, when the molar ratio of CaO2/Fe2+ was decreased from 40/40 to 5/5, the removal also reduced to 63% in ultrapure water and 83% in groundwater.99 A high concentration of CaO2 showed elevated production of ˙OH and induced self-scavenging reactions that produced HO2˙ (eqn (5)).130 Though HO2˙ also serves as a reactive radical, it is not effective in BTEX degradation due to its poor reactivity. On the other hand, excessive use of CaO2 induces the self-decomposition of HO2˙ to H2O2 (eqn (6)) and increases the precipitation rate of Ca(OH)2,99 resulting in elevated solution pH. For example, increasing the concentration of CaO2 from 5 to 40 M enhanced the solution pH from 3.26 to 10.8. The alkaline pH adversely affects the removal by increasing O2 production (eqn (3)). Also, a higher dose of Fe2+ restricts the production of reactive radicals and affects the efficiency.131 So, optimizing the CaO2 and Fe2+ levels is essential to achieve higher degradation of BTEX. ˙OH + H2O2 → H2O + HO2˙(HO2˙ ↔ O2˙− + H+)(5) 2H2O2 + 2H2O + O2(6)Controlling the precipitation rate of Fe2+ than CaO2 is crucial owing to its potential in reactive radical protection. Also, the accumulation of [Fe(OH)3] induces aggregation, which affects the degradation efficiency.99 Chelating agents can be used to reduce the Fe3+ precipitation rate and ensure the slow release of Fe2+. They regulate the competition between BTEX and Fe2+ for the reactive radical (˙OH) (eqn (7)).99 Thus, a rapid transition of Fe2+ to Fe3+ can be avoided (eqn (7)). Accordingly, glutamic acid (GA), CA, and oxalic acid (OA) with Fe2+ in the ratio of 10/20 resulted in an improvement in the degradation efficiencies of B, T, and X as 32, 60, and 72%, respectively. The notable chelating feature of OA is due to its higher ability to solubilize iron (e.g., stability constant of OA with Fe2+ is >4.7).132 Fe3+-chelating + H2O2 → Fe3+-chelating + HO2˙(7)CaO2 is a stable electron donor and helps to amplify BTEX degradation. However, its poor dispersion and electron transportation ability need to be improved to treat high concentrations of BTEX (e.g., industrial wastewater).133 To speed up the electron mobility in CaO2, increasing the effective surface area is one of the easiest methods. Accordingly, nano-CaO2 (nCaO2) was prepared by the hydrolysis precipitation method.98 The smaller particle size of nCaO2 (109 nm) increased the ˙OH production and subsequently showed higher removal efficiency than CaO2. For example, the removal efficiencies of CaO2 and nCaO2 for treating BTEX (∼40 mg L−1 at pH 3) were ∼60 and 96% in 180 min, respectively.98 Similar to CaO2, the change in the molar ratio of nCaO2 and Fe2+ affected the generation rate of ˙OH. In practical settings, the influence of surfactants on the efficiency of nCaO2/Fe2+ was investigated. The surfactants are commonly used to separate BTEX from the contaminated sites via soil washing or soil flushing. The presence of surfactants decreases the BTEX removal due to competition for reactive radicals. Because of the higher solubility, Brij35 showed higher interference for removing BTEX from contaminated groundwater than Tween 80.98 These findings add merits to the nCaO2/Fe2+-based technology for treating BTEX from highly contaminated groundwater with complex co-existing pollutants.
In the series of percarbonate-based H2O2 activation, sodium percarbonate (SPC: 2Na2CO3·3H2O2) has also been verified as a source of H2O2 in Fenton-based reactions.111 The function of SPC is like that of CaO2 (eqn (8)). However, its ability to prevent the precipitation rate of Fe2+/Fe3+ is low.134,135 Chelating agents such as citrate (CIT) or OA are usually combined with the SPC/Fe2+ system to increase the ˙OH production and decrease the deposition rate of Fe3+.135 2Na2CO3·3H2O2 → 2Na2CO3 + 3H2O2(8)The developed CIT/SPC/Fe2+ and OA/SPC/Fe2+ complexes showed 87.6 and 87.1% B removal within 30 min at near-neutral pH.111 Most importantly, the prepared complex showed a selective degradation profile for B even in the presence of co-existing pollutants (e.g., SO42−, NO3−, Cl−, and humic acid). Further, CIT/SPC/Fe2+ and OA/SPC/Fe2+ degraded 68.6 and 43.9% of B in contaminated groundwater samples. ˙OH and O2˙− were dominant reactive species, and the generation rate of these reactive species was as per the molar concentration of SPC. In this manner, increasing the ratio of CIT/SPC/Fe2+ and OA/SPC/Fe2+ from 4:2:2 to 8:4:4 led to an increase in B removal from contaminated groundwater from 68.6 and 43.9% to 95.7, and 99.9%, respectively.111 Eco-friendly chelating agents such as ethylenediamine-N,N′-succinic acid (EDDS) also produce ˙OH and O2˙− for the degradation of E. Unlike CIT/OA, EDDS removed E effectively (86.1%) at pH 2.7. The requirement of acidic pH is not a positive point, and it creates a potential threat to the environment. Also, the EDDS/Fe2+/SPC process develops toxic intermediates.28 Therefore, it is essential to monitor the level of intermediates and by-products to ensure the safe discharge of processed water into the environment.
In the Fenton process, recovery of Fe2+/Fe3+ from the treated effluent is one of the challenging steps, and immobilization of Fe on a stable structure like GO, CNT, biochar (BC), CaCO2, and MnO2 could be the better option to achieve its regeneration and safeguard its structural properties. Among these stable structures, MnO2 yields 1O2 as a reactive species and provides selective BTEX degradation.136 However, consecutive experiments led to the precipitation of Fe–Mn complexes which caused aggregation in bulk solution, thus terminating ˙OH production.137 The addition of GO or BC to Fe provides dual advantages; it limits the aggregation tendency of Fe–Mn oxides and catalyses H2O2 to produce ˙OH.138,139 The BTEX removal efficiency of Fe–Mn-biochar (FMBC) was E-83.1% to B-94.1% in 180 min at pH >3.101 The broader working pH of FMBC compared to that of the traditional Fenton reaction is due to its surface functionality. The oxygen-containing surface functionality of BC acts as a buffer and maintains the solution pH between 6.17 and 7.45.140 FMBC works effectively in a pH range of 3–10 (ref. 101) and maintains immobilization of Fe3+ on the active surface (e.g., pores and interface) of BC.141 Such immobilization decreases Fe and Mn leaching into the solution over seven consecutive runs.101 The BTEX removal efficiency of FMBC decreased to ∼57% at the 7th regeneration cycle due to catalyst deactivation, deposition of leached Fe/Mn oxides on the catalyst surface, and interference created by acidic by-products.142,143 Overall the reaction kinetics of FMBC was in the order of B > T > X > E. The electrophilic attack of ˙OH on BTEX is the underlying mechanism. Briefly, the reaction of ˙OH with BTEX is mainly accompanied by hydrogen abstraction and radical addition to the aromatic ring (Fig. 4).144 Subsequently, it leads to ring-opening and mineralization.97 The superior efficiency of FMBC was also evident in removing BTEX (93.2% in 12 h at pH 7.69) from produced water with varying concentrations of co-existing pollutants, which indicates their efficiency in treating BTEX in the contaminated samples.101 Combining carbonaceous materials with the Fenton reagent is profitable in terms of efficiency, regeneration, and sludge production. Nevertheless, the preparation and post-modification of BC need special care. Improper treatment leads to pore blockage and restricted diffusion of BTEX into the layers of BC. Furthermore, FMBC after the Fenton-reaction needs attention because the free radicals present in BC are known to develop toxicity towards aquatic organisms.145 Though ˙OH has been identified as a dominant radical species helping BTEX degradation, further investigation of the degradation pathway is essential to identify the reaction pathway of free radicals supplied from BC (e.g., O2˙−).

In electro-Fenton (EF), a catalytically active anode material and a continuous supply of Fenton's reagent (a solution of H2O2 with Fe2+ ion) are needed to avoid electrode passivation.146 In comparison with the Fenton reaction, EF is a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (eqn (9)), and the use of electricity reduces secondary pollution.147 Therefore, EF is an eco-friendly process that produces reactive radicals for organic pollutant degradation (Fig. 3b). O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2(9)GO is used to increase the inherent stability of Fe3O4, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were added to improve the kinetic reversibility of Fe3O4 under acidic conditions.148,149 Nanoporous CNT-Ce/WO3/graphite felt (GF) cathode, Ti/TiO2 anode, and Fe3O4/MWCNT/GO electro catalysts were used to degrade BTEX in the EF process.97 The WO3 and CNT with GF composite as a cathode material increased the electrode surface area and porosity with less agglomeration (Fig. 5a).150 For example, the surface area and pore volume of GF and CNT-Ce/WO3/GF were 1.71 m2 g−1, 0.008 cm3 g−1, and 11.9 m2 g−1, 0.193 cm3 g−1, respectively.97 Also, the modified GF electrode possessed hydrophobicity (contact angle: 124°), unlike the hydrophilic pristine GF electrode (contact angle: 139°). Combining MWCNT and GO increased the dispersibility of Fe3O4 and helped retain the hollow morphology of Fe3O4 (Fig. 5b). The degradation efficiency of the Fe3O4/MWCNT/GO assisted EF system was 73.2% which was 2.31 and 2 times higher than conventional Fenton and traditional electrodes. Moreover, the composite system retained its original capacity over five consecutive reusability cycles. 11% reduction in removal efficiency at the 8th cycle proved its high regeneration potential (Fig. 5c).97 The limitation to the usage of WO3-based electrodes is the low energy density. So, improving electrode energy density via replacing aqueous electrolytes with ionic electrolytes yields better results.151 Likewise, diffusion-related restrictions of MWCNT/GO after prolonged usage should also be considered while extending the application of the Fe3O4/MWCNT/GO-based electro catalyst for practical applications.

In a nutshell, Fenton-based technology offers similar degradation efficiency for B, T, E, and X. The need for acidic pH (>4) is a noticeable technical limitation, which can be resolved by forming composites with carbonaceous materials (GO and BC). Another limitation in using Fenton-based degradation is the demand for the continuous supply of H2O2. The use of CaO2/Na2CO3 for producing H2O2 is a feasible solution. However, the exact pathway for generating and utilizing the reactive species in CaO2 systems is not well documented. So far, very few studies have reported the photo, sono, and electro-Fenton-based technologies for treating BTEX in produced water or contaminated groundwater. Nevertheless, the process parameters of these methodologies are not generalized yet. The molar ratio of Fe2+ used in Fenton reactions is higher than the guideline value (3 mg L−1).152 Hence, secondary treatment is mandatory to remove excess Fe2+/Fe3+ from the effluent before discharge into the environment. Thus, it is crucial to identify the best Fenton-based technology for treating BTEX effectively and economically.
3.2. Ozonation and catalytic ozonation
Ozone (O3) is the oxidant preferred to degrade aromatic compounds153via two fundamental mechanisms, namely direct oxidation via molecular O3 and indirect oxidation by reactive radicals.17 Under certain circumstances (e.g., higher pollutant concentration), external supply of a secondary oxidant (e.g., H2O2) or catalyst can accelerate the reactive radical generation in ozonation process. The advantages of these integrated technologies are the absence of secondary contamination and low material and maintenance costs (compared to Fenton's or pulse power).154 Ozonation (without a catalyst) removed >99.5% of BTEX (10 mg L−1) within 356 min. Coupling H2O2 with O3 showed 100% removal in 317 min.102 In both cases, optimum removal is achieved through the ability of O3 to produce ˙OH under alkaline conditions (pH: 10.5) and the existence of BTEX in the protonated form that maximizes the interaction and removal (eqn (10)). A higher dose of H2O2 showed >92.6% BTEX removal in 180 min. The high concentration of H2O2 (62 g) elevated the production of the reactive radicals through an indirect mechanism.102 Total organic carbon (TOC) removal in H2O2/O3 system was 74%,96 and degradation had three stages a) H-abstraction, b) radical substitution on the aryl ring, and c) ring opening and mineralization.102 In an H2O2/O3 system, ˙OH and HO2˙ are produced simultaneously (eqn (11)), improving the reaction kinetics. This can be further sped up if photocatalysts (TiO2) are added. Thus, complete BTEX (40 mg L−1) removal was observed in O3/H2O2/UV and TiO2/UV/O3/H2O2 systems within 60 min.110 This highlights the importance of light irradiation in the preparation of ˙OH (eqn (12)) (Fig. 6). O3 + OH− → O3˙− + ˙OH(10) H2O2 + O3 → ˙OH + HO2˙ + O2(11) H2O2 + hγ → 2˙OH(12)The addition of catalysts to the ozonation process reduces treatment costs by reducing the reaction time. Accordingly, MgO was used to treat B (10 mg L−1). The O3/MgO system removed up to 99.3% B in 50 min, which was 1.61 times higher than the non-catalyzed ozonation process.103 This enhanced removal of B after the addition of MgO was due to the direct oxidation of O3 that produces abundant reactive radicals. The calculated operational cost ($ per m3) of O3/UV, O3, O3/H2O2/UV, and TiO2/UV/H2O2/O3 was 3.85, 16.5, 17.3, and 17.4, respectively.110 Hence, as per the treatment efficiency, reaction kinetics, and operational cost, O3/UV is the best treatment option for BTEX under the particular operational conditions considered by Fernandes et al.110 using synthetic wastewater. However, the real wastewater consists of several other organic compounds with unknown properties. Therefore, the validation of the O3/UV process in real wastewater containing low concentrations of BTEX is necessary.

The optimum levels of O3 and UV intensity will aid the BTEX treatment. The low solubility and stability of O3 in varying pH is a major drawback in treating BTEX on a field scale. Adding a catalyst (e.g., TiO2) speeds up the reaction kinetics and enhances the reactive radical formation. TiO2 is known to decrease the toxicity of the treated effluent.108 Hence, the quality of the treated effluent using the O3/UV system needs to be compared with the TiO2/UV/H2O2/O3 system to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. The main limitation of the ozonation technology is the need for alkaline pH (10–11) to maximize the degradation efficiency. Further, a pH drop during the degradation process causes structural damage to the catalyst (e.g., defects or cracks). Likewise, the accumulation of acidic by-products reduces reactive radical production, and secondary separation methods are required to remove residual oxidants. TiO2 catalysts doped with Ru, Pd, Ni, and Cu were recently identified as solid acid catalysts that aid the production of hydrocarbons from biomass.155 These kinds of TiO2-composites may help to reduce the burden related to acidic by-products.
3.3. Photocatalysis
Photocatalysis is one of those modern technologies that have found maximum application in water and wastewater treatment. The advantages of employing photocatalysts in treating BTEX are superior performance under ambient conditions and the creation of less toxic or readily biodegradable intermediates.156 The principal mechanism of photocatalysis is the absorption of photon energy (hγ) which is equal to or higher than that of the photocatalyst. Subsequent transfer of electrons (e−) from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) results in the generation of holes (h+) in the VB. The h+ and e− present in the VB and CB generate ˙OH and superoxide (O2˙−) radicals by reacting with water molecules.98 ˙OH is identified as a non-selective and highly reactive radical species compared with O2˙−. The factors affecting the speed of the photocatalytic process are the nature of the catalyst, pH, temperature, type of irradiation, and catalyst dose. The nature of the catalyst is a key criterion because it decides the effect of light penetration and subsequent reactive radical production (Fig. 6).
Accordingly, various semiconductor-based photocatalysts like ZnO, γ-Fe2O3, and TiO2/ZrO2 were developed to treat BTEX in water. Photolysis with and without the addition of an oxidant (H2O2 or O3) and catalyst (TiO2) has also been verified. TiO2/UV/H2O2 degraded 52.5, 59.5, 66.2, and 60.4% of BTEX which is low compared to H2O2/UV (e.g., 42.8, 51.5, 66.7, and 62.5%) and H2O2 (39.8, 25.8, 12.2, and 15.3%).102 A similar observation was made by Dhivakar29 by using UV/H2O2. Thus, it can be concluded that the addition of a catalyst into the photocatalytic system improved the degradation performance of UV/H2O2.96 The use of TiO2 (P-25) enabled 10% TOC removal under UVA radiation and 16% under solar light in 120 min.96 This poor mineralization efficiency of P-25 was due to the presence of co-existing pollutants such as organic matter (e.g., humic acid (HA)) and salts. Yet, the toxicity of half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of the treated effluent was in the range of 13–16%, which is lower than that of untreated water (10%). Adding H2O2 can improve the removal of BTEX. For instance, the UV/H2O2 ([H2O2]: 250 mg L−1) treatment system, when operated with 254 nm and 184 nm, showed 62 and 80% TOC removal at pH 3 in 240 min.109 The acidic conditions offer multiple benefits like a higher reaction rate, fewer issues related to the accumulation of acidic by-products (e.g., carbonic acid) and high biodegradability of the treated effluent.157,158 However, neutralization of the treated effluent before the discharge is needed.
TiO2 (P-25) is a commonly used photocatalyst, and surface properties control its efficiency. Some of the disadvantages of TiO2 are maximum efficiency at the UV region, aggregation, non-uniform particle distribution, and complexity in the recovery of dispersed TiO2.159 However, the catalyst is required to boost up the reactive radical production. In such regard, ZnO and Fe2O3 are being used as alternatives to degrade BTEX owing to their lesser aggregation feature. ZnO nanoparticles synthesized via the microwave-assisted hydrothermal process with uniform particle size (4.5 μm) and diameter (100 nm) have been utilized as a solar-light driven photocatalyst. Removal of 65% B to 90% of X was achieved within 180 min.104 The less degradation of B compared to T, E, and X is due to its lower adsorption on the surface of ZnO. As the reaction happens near the surface of the catalyst, it is important to assess the affinity of BTEX with the catalyst (ZnO) surface. Accordingly, the obtained rate constant for the surface reaction (kC: mg L−1 min−1) of B, T, E, and X was 0.189, 1.109, 0.339, and 0.706. These results clearly demonstrated that the reactive radicals developed by ZnO interacted with the targets in the order of T > X > E > B. This type of ZnO catalyst displayed complete mineralization of BTEX into CO2 and water within 180 min. During the degradation, stable intermediates such as benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, phenol, and benzyl alcohol were identified.104 Similarly, γ-Fe2O3 exhibited 97% and 95% removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) under UV and visible light in 90 min and 7200 min, respectively.106 The improved kinetics of γ-Fe2O3 under UV irradiation is due to its abundant surface active sites for BTEX adsorption compared to that under visible light.105,106 Though the efficiency of this nanophotocatalyst is higher than that of TiO2, the lack of enough information related to the quantitative and qualitative assessment of the treated effluent (e.g., toxicity and by-product chemical composition) questions its further application.
ZnO and γ-Fe2O3 display excellent photocatalytic features. Combining these two as zinc-ferrite will aid in post-separation (magnetic separation) and in reconciling catalytic properties. The main limitation of zinc-ferrite is its low photon absorption, which is resolved by doping zinc-ferrite with semiconductor-based metal oxides.104 In view of that, V2O5 prepared from e-waste was doped with zinc ferrite to yield zinc-ferrite-V2O5 (ZFV).107 Composite formation reduced the bandgap of V2O5 from 2.21 to 2.08 eV, and the maximum degradation of 95% (120 min) was observed at pH 3. Like ZnO and γ-Fe2O3, acidic pH (3) generated more positive holes on the catalyst surface which acted as reactive sites for BTEX degradation. The presence of interfering ions like Cl−, CO32−, and NO3− reduced the efficiencies of the system to 60, 65, 80, and 75%, respectively, whereas the presence of H2O2 improved the efficiency to 98% (Fig. 7a).107 The blocking effect of Cl− and the hydroxyl scavenging feature of CO32− significantly impacted the degradation of BTEX.160,161 H2O2 and SO42− aided in the production of ˙OH (eqn (13) and (14)), which enhanced the reaction rate.162 Also, the ease of separation of ZFV helped to maintain their removal efficiency (90%) even after five consecutive regeneration cycles (Fig. 7b and c).107 This inherent stability and viability of ZFV after regeneration (Fig. 7d) signifies the need for its pilot-scale application. H2O2 + e− → OH− + ˙OH(13) SO4˙− + H2O → ˙OH + SO42− + H+(14)Magnetic nanoparticles can be used to improve the separation ability of the spent photocatalyst at a reasonable cost. However, centrifugation and separation for further treatment of the treated effluent necessitate a significant amount of time and technical expertise. The production of the nano-photocatalyst as a film will solve the challenges in such circumstances. Thus the prepared TiO2/ZrO2 film was used to degrade BTEX (0.145–3.7 mg L−1) from groundwater samples at pH 7.108 The fabricated continuous system showed 80–90% removal within 120 min under the dissolved oxygen concentration of 10 mg L−1. The EC50-48 h value of the untreated and treated solution was found to be 14.1 and 84.3%, and this demonstrated the efficacy of the TiO2/ZrO2 film for removing BTEX from groundwater.108 It should be noted that the concentration tested in this study was 3–10 times lower than the studies listed in Table 4. More studies are needed to determine whether the nanocomposite film can effectively treat high levels of BTEX in industrial wastewater samples.

BTEX is removed with more than 90% efficiency and quicker reaction kinetics using photocatalysis (e.g., 1–3 h). Yet, the requirement for a high-intensity light source is a significant disadvantage. Another important feature in a liquid-phase photocatalytic system is the homogeneity and depth of incident light penetration. In such instances, slurry reactors outperform packed bed and film-based photocatalytic devices in terms of photon flux distribution and degradation efficiency. In a slurry-based system, post-separation (e.g., sedimentation) of the catalyst is required. Photocatalysts are immobilized on inert surfaces. However, due to their limited exposure to active sites per unit volume, photocatalytic films cannot remove BTEX from complex matrixes (e.g., generated water). Flow reactors, which can continually remove BTEX, can overcome these types of mass transfer limitations. Maintaining process parameters such as pH is also critical for ensuring reaction selectivity; otherwise, the catalyst's bandgap, degradation kinetics, and physicochemical properties would be affected. Future research is needed to see if TiO2, ZnO, and ZVF can remove BTEX from field samples using a slurry-based flow-through reactor method. The aforementioned key points should be considered before undertaking such research.
3.4. Persulfate process
Sulfate-radical (SO4˙−)-based AOPs are trending treatment options as they can selectively degrade π electrons of aromatic compounds and unsaturated bonds.163 Also, the half-life of SO4˙− is longer than that of ˙OH. The electron transfer is the dominant mechanism in PS-based systems, with PS (S2O82−) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS: HSO5−) as common precursors for SO4˙− production. However, their reaction kinetics for SO4˙− production is low. For example, the PS concentration of 105 mg L−1 exhibited 100% B removal from contaminated groundwater within 96 h.100 Therefore, diverse activation methods such as chemical treatment, heat treatment, UV-radiation, and ultrasonication are used to achieve better results.164 Thermally activated PS removed ∼90% of T, E, and X and ∼70% of B in 300 min at neutral pH.114 But, HCO3−, CO32−, HPO42− and HA inhibited the degradation efficiency by consuming SO4˙− and SO42−, NO3−, PO43−, and H2PO4− did not affect the degradation efficiency of SO4˙−. The presence of low concentrations (<10 mM) of Cl− and Br− reduced the degradation efficiency of the sulfate radical. However, it promoted the X degradation at higher concentrations via the formation of selective reactive radicals (e.g., Cl˙ and Br˙). It should be noted that the reaction of BTEX with Cl˙ and Br˙ produces toxic halogenated by-products, which can adversely affect the biota.114 Excess of SO4˙− radicals are required to reduce the interferences of co-existing pollutants and to boost the selective breakdown of BTEX. The chemical activation of PS creates a uniform PS activation and can guarantee sufficient production of SO4˙−.165
The use of heterogeneous chemical activators (e.g., Fe3O4-carbon black (CB)) for PS was examined.113 The addition of Fe3O4 increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and CB ensured electron mobility in the system.166 The low removal efficiency of Fe3O4-CB/PS for BTEX was >90% within 24 h, and X removal (97%) was higher than B (90%). The molecularly configured X is readily oxidized by SO4˙−via H-abstraction and the aromatic ring cleavage mechanism. Though Fe3O4-CB/PS offers above 90% removal, the in vitro studies using Clone 9 cells revealed its slight cytotoxicity (400 μg mL−1). CB induced significant toxicity in the Fe3O4–CB composite. When the concentration of CB was increased (100–400 μg mL−1), oxidative stress and physical changes in the cell-membrane were observed.167 Conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+ also caused oxidative stress in cells.113 These studies highlight the toxicity of Fe3O4–CB due to their typical nature. So, cautious usage of the Fe3O4-CB/PS system in field trials is mandated.
Asphaltenes (Asph) are polycyclic aromatic compounds that contain diverse functional moieties (e.g., –COOH, phenolic OH groups, and pyridine groups) in their structure.168 The physicochemical properties of Asph are similar to those of MWCNT, and they interact with sp2 carbon atoms of BTEX, forming π–π stacking. The Asph/PS system showed 9, 29, 53, and 53% degradation of B, T, E, and X, respectively.34 The low removal efficiency of the Asph/PS system was due to the low concentration of reactive radicals. Ultrasonication (US) is an effective and rapid method to activate PS/PMS via acoustic cavitation. The coupling of Asph with US will increase the production of reactive radicals, thus increasing the degradation efficiency. The degradation efficiency of the PS/US/Asph system for BTEX (B: 78, T: 94, E: 98, and X: 98%) was similar to that of PMS/US/Asph (B: 76, T: 91, E: 97, and X: 97%). The Asph dispersed in the bulk solution developed large cavitation bubbles, which acted as activation centers and improved the interaction between BTEX and PS.113 This causes an effective electron transfer from BTEX to PS and vice versa. The synergetic activity of US and Asph promotes the production of reactive radicals. For example, US activation develops ˙OH, and US/Asph/PS or PMS yielded SO4˙− and O2˙− in the system. The formation of multiple reactive radicals in US/Asph/PS or US/Asph/PMS causes high degradation of BTEX. Further, Asph's high stability and activity allowed it to cover the catalytic surface quickly via electron donor–acceptor interactions, resulting in enhanced BTEX degradation.169 However, the change in the surface charge of the Asph (due to reduced active sites) causes a decline in the production of SO4˙− in consecutive degradation cycles (eqn (15)–(17)).170 There was a 30% fall in degradation efficiency in the second cycle. S2O82− + Mn+ → M(n+1)+ + SO42− + SO4˙−(15) HSO5− + Mn+ → M(n+1)+ + HO− + SO4˙−(16) HSO5− + M(n+1)+ → Mn+ + H+ + SO5˙−(17)
The spent Asph finds its application as a co-component in bitumen production. In this way, the secondary pollution of spent Asph is reduced.113 Methanol washing of used Asph revealed the absence of metal and organic contaminants (e.g., polyaromatic hydrocarbon). Hence, using Asph as a catalyst in the PS process provides a closed-loop system that ensures the process's long-term viability.
Overall, because of its capacity to create enough reactive radicals to improve BTEX breakdown, the thermally activated PS process is a viable treatment technology for treating low quantities of BTEX (0.1 mg L−1).114 The use of a high concentration of PS (105 mg L−1) showed satisfactory results for removing B and T from contaminated groundwater.100 However, the further reaction of leftover SO4˙− with co-existing contaminants is not yet clearly known. It is vital to assess the life cycle of by-products. US/Asph is better than Fe3O4–CB in efficiency, reusability, and sustainability among hybrid activation technologies. But, the need for acidic pH in the US/Asph/PS system limits their application in the field-scale trial. A similar observation was also made by Xia et al.171 while treating BTEX from gasoline saturated groundwater using a PS/Fe2+/bioreactor. More than 93% of BTEX was removed then. But, the high concentration of PS reduced the pH of the solution from 8.1 to 3.3. This pH reduction inhibited the growth of the microbial community. Acidic pH is essential to avoid iron precipitation and to the release of the reactive radicals. Shielding the surface of the iron catalyst will reduce the precipitation rate of iron, and will facilitate a broader working pH range for the PS/iron system. For example, the zerovalent iron/L-cys/PS composite showed excellent removal of BTEX (>95%) from groundwater in a wide range of pH (3 to 9).172 The formation of a weak coordination complex between Fe3+ and the carboxylic group of L-cys lowered the precipitation of Fe3+ and facilitated higher BTEX removal. Such methods can be used in the future to eliminate issues like the need for a narrow pH range, iron precipitation, and cytotoxicity associated with catalytic PS-based oxidation.
3.5. Electrochemical oxidation (EO)
EO is a widely preferred technology for VOC removal. Simple design, operational flexibility, and eco-friendliness are the key advantages of the EO process. The EO process is usually accompanied by direct and indirect oxidation mechanisms.117 In the previous procedure, direct charge transfer at the anode resulted in the indirect oxidation of organic molecules into CO2 and H2O.118 In the latter process, the ˙OH generated from the water evolution reaction destroys contaminants and yields biodegradable by-products.173 The oxidation strength of direct and indirect oxidation depends on the anode material. Hence, diverse anode materials such as boron-doped diamond (BDD), Pt, carbon-based electrodes, and dimensionally stable anodes (DSA) were investigated. Most of those studies were on DSA-based anodes used in treating produced water.120 The mud-like-cracked morphology of DSA offers a higher effective surface area, chemical resistance, lower oxidation power, and thermal/mechanical stabilities.174 It also promoted the generation of other active radicals (e.g., SO4˙− and Cl˙) and acted as electrode corrosion inhibitors.175 The BDD anode generates a higher quantity of ˙OH than DSA and carbon electrodes. Yet, high energy consumption and a need to fine-tune the boron content limit the BDD application in produced water treatment.176
Ti/RuO2–TiO2–SnO2-based mixed metal oxide electrodes showed complete B, T, and X degradation at a current density of 89 mA cm−2.120 The metal ions reach a higher oxidation state at the anode under anodic polarization and produce ˙OH for the oxidation of organic pollutants.177 So, increasing the interaction between contaminants and oxidants will increase the degradation efficiency. For example, at high flow rates, the oxygen evolution reaction becomes a dominant reaction eqn (18)) which decreases the ˙OH production (eqn (19)) and subsequently decreases organic pollutant degradation (eqn (20)).120 The removal efficiencies of Ti/RuO2–TiO2–SnO2 at 0.25 and 1.3 × 10−3 m3 h−1 were 98% and 84%, respectively. The increased flow rate lowers the contact between BTEX and the anode, and that decreases degradation. H2O → 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e−(18) H2O + M → M[˙OH] + H+ + e−(19) R + M[˙OH] → M + RO + H+ + e−(20)Rocha et al.121 compared the efficiencies of Ti/Pt and BDD electrodes in removing BTEX from produced water collected from the petrochemical industry. Under set constraints (j = 30 mA cm−2 and Na2SO4: 5 g) the BDD electrode could remove BTEX better (e.g., T-62.4 to X-97.3% in 10 h) than Ti/Pt (T-82.4 to B-99.8% in 10 h). The high efficiency of the BDD electrode was due to the high concentration of reactive radicals (e.g., ˙OH and SO4˙−) near the catalyst surface.121 At high temperatures, the BDD electrode had low stability due to its inert surface properties. The ˙OH and SO4˙− generated were only weakly bound to the catalyst surface and then had a better reaction to BTEX.178 High temperatures favoured oxygen evolution in Ti/Pt, hence reducing ˙OH production as indicated in eqn (19).173 The high concentrations of NaCl in the produced water created chloro-hydroxyl (˙ClOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2˙) radicals. These secondary radicals react with BTEX via indirect oxidation and increased degradation kinetics (eqn (21)).120 However, the chlorine-related by-products are known to cause health hazards.1 Hence, the usage of high concentration of chloride as an electrolyte is not recommended.
The addition of electrolyte (Na2SO4) improved the degradation efficiency via the generation of S2O82−. This further improved the degradation and protected the electrode from film deposition (electrode passivation).179 Overall, EO of water enriched the production of ˙OH and increased BTEX destruction.180 The low probability for oxygen evolution in BDD adds additional advantages to uplift the degradation profile. R + M[HClO˙] → M + RO + H+ + Cl−(21)The agitation rate also affects the efficiency of the BDD and DSA electrodes. At a low agitation rate (200 rpm), the COD removal of the BDD anode was 43%. At optimum agitation (400 rpm) COD removal was maximum (50%). The removal efficiency decreased to 37% when it was further increased to 600 rpm.121 At a low agitation rate, the number of available pollutants on the catalyst surface is limited (mass transfer limitations). At high agitation, the excess pollutants formed a layer, and this restricted the electron transfer and resulted in lower mineralization.121 Thus, the maximum degradation efficiency can be achieved in electrochemical systems by ensuring synergy between the mass transfer and reactive radical production.
The reactive radicals produced from co-existing ions increase the performance of BDD or DSA electrodes. But ions present in electrolytes produce radicals, and it prohibits electrode passivation. Therefore, assessing the performance of Ti/Pt in the presence of electrolytes NaCl and K2SO4 can yield information on the above-mentioned indirect oxidation reactions.118 The degradation efficiency of Ti/Pt was higher with NaCl (j: 10 mA cm−2) than K2SO4 (j: 30 mA cm−2). The use of chloride as an electrolyte increased the production of chlorine-related reactive species (HClO and ClO−) at low current density (eqn (22)–(24)).181,182 Cl− → Cl2 + 2e−(22) Cl2 + H2O → HClO + Cl− + H+(23) HClO ↔ ClO− + H+(24)Nonetheless, SO4˙− acts as an active radical in addition to ˙OH. The removal efficiencies of NaCl and K2SO4 as electrolytes are not significantly distinctive. Usage of K2SO4 in the Ti/Pt system is profitable as there is no organo chlorinated by-product formation. Also, the energy consumption (kWh m−3) of Ti/Pt/K2SO4 (3.97) is lower than that of Ti/IrO2–Ta2O5/K2SO4 (11.9). Hence, for treating low concentration BTEX, the Ti/Pt anode with K2SO4 as the supporting electrolyte is recommended, even though Pt anodes create a foul smell while treating BTEX from brine or saline-produced water.121 The presence of excess chlorine and surfactants in produced water deposits organic impurities in the anode surface. Direct oxidation causes this film deposition over DSA electrodes. BDD electrodes serve as non-active electrodes and restrict film formation via an indirect oxidation mechanism.120 This unique behaviour of DSA and BDD was observed recently while treating BTEX in fresh ([Cl−]: 45.8 mg dm−3), brine ([Cl−]: 1573 mg dm−3), and saline ([Cl−]:86875 mg dm−3) produced water.119 In all cases, the BDD anode gave better results than Ti/IrO2–Ta2O5 in treating BTEX. The inactivity of BDD increased the anode lifetime and efficiency by retarding the adsorption of contaminants and by-products over the anode surface. The generation of active chlorine species by the BDD electrode is lower than DSA.119 However, the developed chloride radicals (ClO˙− or HClO˙) in bulk solution are involved in BTEX degradation. The poor performance of the DSA (e.g., Ti/IrO2–Ta2O5) anode compared to BDD was due to its active electrode phenomenon.119 Due to increased adsorption characteristics, by-products are deposited on the anode, decreasing the electrode efficiency.183 Therefore, BDD electrodes efficiently remove BTEX from produced water containing plenty of chlorine and COD. Seawater containing Cl− (23122 mg L−1) and BTEX (2.5 mg L−1) was treated using the BDD anode and carbon-polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cathode at the pilot-scale.117 The efficiency of this electrocatalytic system at a current density of 74 mA cm−2 and feed flow rate of 0.2 m3 h−1 for removal of X and E was 100% in 30 min and for T and B, 90 and 70–80% removal in 60 and 120 min, respectively. B removal was affected by variation in electric current and ETX removal efficiencies were dependent on the flow rate and initial concentration on a pilot scale. Temperature also adversely affects the removal of BTEX on large-scale treatment. DSA electrodes perform better than BDD at high temperatures due to the higher production of active chlorine species. For example, the TOC removal feature of Ti/IrO2–Ta2O5 at 25 °C and 40 °C was 71 and 65%, respectively. Notably, a low electrode potential is beneficial when chlorine is plenty. This reduced energy consumption and treatment costs.184
The BDD electrode removes BTEX from different water sources containing various co-existing pollutants efficiently. K2SO4 is a viable option as it develops reactive species that interact non-selectively with BTEX and yields fewer mineralized by-products. DSA electrodes show high efficiency at high temperatures, which also causes unnecessary high oxygen evolution. With brine, saline, and NaCl as electrolytes, the EO of BTEX creates recalcitrant by-products. Though EO is the best method to treat low concentrations of BTEX (1 to 10 mg L−1), it is not recommended to treat BTEX in saturated petroleum-contaminated groundwater or refinery influent. Appropriate electrode modification strategies (e.g., doping of nanomaterials), optimization of the matrix effect (e.g., coagulation before treating BTEX from petroleum wastewater), and designing hybrid technologies (coagulation–EO–adsorption using green adsorbents) can overcome the existing drawbacks of EO.
3.6. Cavitation-based oxidation
Cavitation is the most preferred AOP, for the past several years, due to its ability to treat produced water and acidic effluents.185 The mechanism includes the generation, growth, and collapse of gaseous microbubbles in a liquid medium.186 In hydrodynamic cavitation (HdC), a local difference in pressure (<vapor pressure) of the flowing liquid medium is created using nozzles of Venturi tubes.187 Passing of liquid through nozzles of Venturi tubes drops the local pressure to one below the saturated vapor pressure of the liquid. This generates bubbles or cavities. In acoustic cavitation (AuC), energy from ultrasound causes vibrations in particles dispersed in a liquid medium. Hence the static pressure of the liquid becomes less than its vapor pressure.186 The collapse of microbubbles generates reactive radicals with high oxidation potential. These radicals non-selectively interact with pollutants and lower their concentrations. Cavitation is preferred for treating only volatile compounds present in groundwater, tap water, and wastewater188 because treating semi-volatile and non-volatile organic compounds is less efficient due to hydrophobicity. Coupling of cavitation with other oxidants (e.g., O3, H2O2, Fe2+/Fe3+, PMS, and PS) reached >80% removal.188 The cavitation process's efficiency depends on the apparatus's velocity, pressure, geometry, pH, temperature, choke design, type, and contaminant concentration.189 AuC and HdC methods were used to treat 40 mg L−1 of BTYEX in simulated synthetic water at alkaline pH, and X-57 (X) to E-65 (E)% and X-41 to E-70% removal was seen in 360 min.122 Coupling with peroxone (H2O2 and O3) improved the reaction kinetics (e.g., 100% removal in 60 min). When the supply was only H2O2 (599 g), the removal of B was enhanced, but the removal of TEX was reduced (e.g., 70–80%) in both AuC and HdC reactions.122 From these experiments, the inefficiency of H2O2 for treating hydrophobic contaminants is revealed. To improve the degradation profile of E and T, HdC/AuC was coupled with a PS-based system. The efficiency of HdC-PS in removing BTEX (B-91.5 to T-95.5%) was almost twice that of HdC (B-90.9 to T-94.5%) within 240 min and at near-neutral pH (6.5).33 The estimated efficiency of HdC-PMS was lower than that of HdC-PS (B-90.9 to T-94.5%). The presence of short –O–O– bond length (0.14 nm) in PMS creates higher binding/activation energy (e.g., 140–213 kJ mol−1) in PMS than PS (e.g., –O–O– bond length: 0.15 nm and binding energy: 140 kJ mol−1).190,191 The presence of Cl− did not influence the HdC efficiency. But, it improved the efficiency of the HdC-PMS system by forming Cl˙ and Cl2˙− along with SO4˙−.33 The presence of CO32− ions created radicals like CO3˙− and HCO3˙ at pH 10. These radicals possessed lower oxidation potential than prominent reactive species (˙OH and SO4˙−), so their contribution in increasing treatment efficiency is considered insignificant.33 Acidic pH (5–6) suits sulfate-based systems best because CO32− is transformed to carbonic acid and the negative impact of CO32− is interrupted. HdC-PS and HdC-PMS remove TOC completely in 240 min. The dominant by-products were CO2 and H2O.33 This kind of superior mineralization efficiency is not seen in other AOPs. Unlike photocatalysis and Fenton reactions, removal of X was slow due to the steric effect of the methyl group. The total treatment cost of HdC/H2O2/O3 and AuC/H2O2/O3 was 0.17 and 0.33 USD per L. Though the estimated cost is less than other AOPs, the effort needed to cut down energy consumption caused by dissipation of high pressure must be accounted for. Proper use of inlet pressure increases velocity and will promote the generation of cavitation bubbles.189 So, after creating enough bubbles in the system, air circulation alone can support pollutant degradation by increasing bombardment by microbubbles. For instance, after cavitation, supplying 80 mL min−1 of air at an inlet pressure of 3.9 bar for 30 min resulted in 92.8% removal of B. This enables cost reduction.
The literature survey identified cavitation as an effective technology for treating high concentrations of BTEX with high mineralization efficiency. Just like the sonochemical process, cavitation can be easily adopted in pilot and large-scale treatment. However, AuC provides effective treatment up to a volume of <10 L. Increasing the volume treated necessitates a greater number of transducers to generate cavitation bubbles. Also, a properly constructed cavitation apparatus can treat low-density liquids (e.g., water). However, this technology is not beneficial for highly viscous wastewater such as petrochemical industrial effluent.192 In such cases, a Venturi-type reactor offers better degradation efficiency than an orifice or rotor–stator.193 More studies are needed to gain more insights into upgrading the cavitation apparatus (e.g., type of transducer or orifice and reactor material) and developing mathematical models to calculate the turbulence phenomenon and kinetic incidence of bubble dynamics.
3.7. Pulse power technology
The main limitation for treating BTEX using AOPs is their high volatility, which demands a rapid treatment process. Low-temperature and rapid generation of reactive radicals is essential to limit this aqueous to gaseous transition-related loss of BTEX. The non-thermal plasma created by high voltage electrical discharges is a new technology used to generate multiple reactive radicals (e.g., ˙OH, O2˙−, and HO2˙) in less time.194 Various discharge methods like corona, pulse power, glow, gliding arc, and dielectric barrier were developed for generating plasma. Pulsed corona discharge (PCD) was used to degrade B (15 mg L−1) with a liquid spray rate of 20 L min−1.31 The frequent and uniform discharge of pulses with a liquid spray helped to degrade even those (B) escaped from water samples (0.8 mg L−1), and the overall efficiency of PCD was 50% in 150 min. A similar degradation efficiency for B using DC-corona discharge was noticed by Satoh et al.195 A closed reactor in the pulse power method is beneficial in degrading aqueous and gaseous VOCs. However, the efficiency of PCD was not satisfactory though it helped to treat ∼15% of the escaped B component. In this, a needle-plate electrode was used to produce a uniform discharge of pulses to create an electric field near the tip of the electrode.124 This ensures the availability of enough reactive species in the test solution and promotes degradation patterns. For example, complete (200 mg L−1) degradation of T in 12 min and 82.8% removal of TOC in 30 min were achieved using peak voltage and pulse frequency of 25 Hz.124 Maximum degradation of T was achieved at neutral pH. The presence of co-existing pollutants such as ions and organic components (e.g., humic acid) slightly decreased (44.2%) the efficiency of pulse power. The use of spray-type discharge of solution near the plasma zone improved the energy efficiency in continuous flow reactor mode (e.g., 100% in 33.3 min).125 Coagulation and pulse power coupling resulted in >91% T removal from pharmaceutical wastewater with >90% of COD and biological oxygen demand (BOD) removal. Therefore, hybrid technology, i.e., coagulation coupled with pulse power, is the viable method to treat produced water with a high concentration of COD and BOD.
Pulse power technology facilitates the treatment of high concentrations of BTEX. It also has disadvantages such as incomplete degradation, secondary pollution, and an unclear mechanism. Improper design of the reactor reduced the interaction of BTEX with pulses and led to incomplete degradation and by-product formation. For example, a pulse power system operating in under ambient conditions leads to the generation of nitrate via interaction of N2 gas with plasma, thus increasing secondary pollution. Overall, research advancements on the treatment of aqueous BTEX using pulse power technology are at the toddler level and require multiple experimental trials before extending this technology to large-scale applications.
4. Life cycle assessment of BTEX treatment technologies
The up-scaling of treatment technologies (discussed above) is based on two main criteria: the efficiency of BTEX removal and economic/environmental burdens. Most of the studies discussed above lack assessment of energy consumption, material production, chemical addition, emission, and waste production. Also, their suitability for BTEX removal in field application cannot be determined. For instance, physicochemical processes like adsorption seem to be eco-friendly, but the limited capacity to adsorb BTEX makes the process incompetent. At the same time, AOPs utilize more energy and chemicals but generate toxic emissions from partial destruction of pollutants. Therefore, a detailed assessment of the environmental impacts of any emergent technology is essential.
A life cycle assessment (LCA) is needed to understand the impact of treatment processes in the environment. This can be used to define and reduce the environmental burdens of a process or activity by identifying and quantifying the energy and materials used, waste discharged, impacts of wastes on the environment, and opportunities to reduce the impact.196 Thus, LCA serves as a holistic decision-making tool in environmental management. The main advantage of implementing LCA is that it weighs all burdens and impacts in the life cycle of a process and not just on emissions and wastes generated by the plant or manufacturing site.197 Accordingly, in the current section, the LCA of BTEX treatment options was conducted to estimate the sustainability of the process using ISO-14040 guidelines.198 LCA was carried out using open LCA software for eight different advanced treatment technologies for BTEX removal based on available literature reports. Our analysis considered the treatment of 1 m3 of wastewater contaminated with BTEX by adsorption,48 Fenton,172 electrochemical,118 photocatalysis,104 ozonation, cavitation (acoustic and hydrodynamic),192 and catalytic PS-based systems.34 The BTEX concentrations in the influent and effluent were taken as reported in the literature. For instance, the influent BTEX concentration for treatment via Fenton172 and cavitation192 process was 10 and 40 mg L−1, respectively.
The system boundaries of the studies are outlined in Fig. 8. The operation phase of the treatment, i.e., BTEX concentration in influent and effluent, energy and chemical inputs, and disposal, encompassed the study's scope. It should be noted that regeneration/reuse, construction phase, decommissioning, and maintenance were not included. This is because the selected treatment processes were stated for lab-scale application. The inventory data (indirect and direct emissions) were taken from the literature and Ecoinvent v 3.6 database (details are provided in Table S1†). Constraints for each treatment technology were calculated using a consequential system model. The ReCiPe mid-point method was employed for impact assessment, which includes the cause–effect chain associated with the treatment process.199 The ReCiPe model offers impact evaluation for 18 mid-point impact categories i.e., climate change (kg CO2-Eq), ozone depletion (kg CFC-11-Eq), ionizing radiation (kg U235-Eq), photochemical ozone formation (kg NMVOC), particulate matter formation (kg PM-10-Eq), terrestrial acidification (kg SO2-Eq), freshwater eutrophication (kg P-Eq), marine eutrophication (kg N-Eq), terrestrial ecotoxicity (kg 1,4-DCB-Eq), freshwater ecotoxicity (kg 1,4-DCB-Eq), marine ecotoxicity (kg 1,4-DCB-Eq), human toxicity (kg 1,4-DCB-Eq), natural land use transformation (m2), water depletion (m3), fossil depletion (kg oil-Eq), metal depletion (kg Fe-Eq), agricultural land occupation (m2a), and urban land occupation (m2a). Lastly, the obtained impact was verified using the Ecoinvent data quality parameter. A summary of controlled impact categories is presented as a single-point score for comparison.
 Fig. 8  The system boundary of the selected treatment systems for LCA. 
4.1. Eutrophication potential: freshwater and marine
The highest eutrophication potential calculated in LCA was for cavitation-based technology (HdC followed by AuC), while other processes showed negligible emissions. The eutrophication potential for all the treatment processes is shown in Fig. 9. The marine eutrophication potential of AuC and HdC processes was 0.32 and 0.42 kg N-Eq, respectively. This value is nearly double the value of freshwater eutrophication potential (0.18 and 0.19 kg P-Eq for AuC and HdC). The possible reason for the highest contribution of cavitation-based treatment for raising the eutrophication might be related to the higher consumption of electricity which indirectly leads to the emissions aided by the consumption of a significant amount of chemicals and ozone. Since other processes do not include that much electrical energy and chemicals, the potential for eutrophication was found to be lower compared to the cavitation-based treatment technologies. The adsorption process is generally considered to have high eutrophication potential.200 However, in our evaluation, only negligible eutrophication is noted. This might have occurred because adsorbent regeneration (commonly using phosphoric acid) was not considered due to a lack of information.

4.2. Ecotoxicity potential: human, marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecotoxicity
From the LCA analysis for ecotoxicity potential, it was found that all discussed treatment technologies have the least impact on terrestrial ecotoxicity and highest on human toxicity. HdC (220 kg 1, 4-DCB-Eq), PC (214 kg 1, 4-DCB-Eq), and AuC (200 kg 1, 4-DCB-Eq) registered the highest toxicity potential (Fig. 9). It has been observed that the treatment utilizing H2O2 had resulted in higher toxicity (HdC and AuC) compared to persulfate-based systems (7.2 kg 1, 4-DCB-Eq). This large variation could be possible due indirect impacts associated with electricity consumption and the residual effects of the chemicals used in the processes. The estimated potential for freshwater and marine ecotoxicity is imparted basically by operation effectiveness. For instance, in Fenton's processes, there was no complete removal of BTEX (B-7, T-14, E-20, and X-18 mg L−1). The residual concentration of BTEX resulted in the toxicity. Additionally, in the case of HdC and AuC, indirect emission due to high energy consumption also contributed to the toxicity.
4.3. Resource depletion potential: water, fossil fuels, ozone, and metals
The maximum resource depletion potential was seen in terms of fossil fuel depletion followed by water, ozone, and metal depletion (Fig. 9). Cavitation-based AOPs showed the highest fossil depletion mainly for HdC (377 kg oil Eq) followed by AuC (179 kg oil-Eq) and US-PMS (63.6 kg oil Eq). On the other hand, another treatment technology involves negligible depletion potential compared to the aforesaid technologies. As it is evident from inventory analysis the electricity consumed was highest for HdC (789 kWh) followed by AuC (129 kWh) and US-PMS (206 kWh), which reflects the corresponding potential for fossil fuel depletion. It can be said from the above observations that the maximum of the impact is due to the production of cavities and energy consumed for reagent production. On the other hand, if we compare the treated water and utilized water for each process then it was found that only two treatment technologies i.e., HdC (1.12 m3) and AuC (1.06 m3) consumed more water than treated it. Apart from HdC and AuC all other processes showed significantly lower (10 times) water depletion potential.201 The lowest depletion potential for metal is found for all the processes except EO, HdC, and AuC. This observation is due to the use of chemicals like hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acids, etc. which contribute indirectly to metal depletion. Also, the usage of metal-based reactor parts such as electrodes in EO, transducers for cavity generation, etc. contributes to metal depletion. It should be noted that most processes contributed minimal to metal depletion due to the exclusion of construction activities from the system boundary. The calculated ozone depletion was lower for all the selected treatments.
4.4. Land occupation/transformation potential: natural, agricultural, and urban
The transformation potential regarding natural, agricultural, and urban land is shown in Fig. 9. The HdC based treatment process showed the highest land occupation in all three aspects i.e., natural (0.28 m2), agricultural (45.2 m2a), and urban (3.15 m2a) while processes like adsorption and ozonation showed the least land transformation potential. The maximum of the land occupational/transformation for all the treatment approaches is linked with their operational requirements. For example, chemical industries development results in forest transformation, and electricity generation is also associated with land occupation.
4.5. Climate change
The potential to contribute to climate change for various processes is depicted in Fig. 9. The LCA investigation suggests that HdC, AuC, US-PMS, and PC are contributing more to CO2 emissions and showed significant potential impact on climate change while the other processes like adsorption, EO, and ozonation showed minimum impacts. The major contribution of impacts arises due to the production of electricity and chemicals. It is very much evident from the above analysis that the potential of any treatment process in climate change is controlled by the usage of energy (production or operation) and chemicals (oxidants).
4.6. Photochemical oxidant formation potential
Among all the studied processes for LCA (Fig. 9), HdC (1.44 kg NMVOC), AuC (0.99 kg NMVOC), and Fenton (0.30 kg NMVOC) showed the highest emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds and were found to be the least suited treatment options of VOC removal. Processes such as adsorption, photocatalysis, and electrochemical oxidation (0.02, 0.07, and 0.03 kg NMVOC respectively) emit the least photochemical oxidants (directly or indirectly) among all the studied processes. Therefore, these treatment methods are found to be more suitable for treating VOC contaminated wastewater. The major possible cause of such high emissions is the high consumption of electricity (nitrogen oxide emissions from the production of electricity) which indirectly adds to the impacts of such processes.
4.7. Particulate matter formation potential
Particulate matter formation is one of the key aspects of selecting any processes for wastewater remediation. Under this category of impacts, the leading contributor is found in the order of HdC > AuC > EO > Fenton > US-PMS > PC > ozonation > adsorption (Fig. 9). The suitability of processes is determined by negligible generation of particulate matter formation. Therefore, HdC can be least preferred, while processes like adsorption, photocatalysis, and persulfate-based are effective methods for treatment. The prominent reason resulting in the high impact core by HdC can be attributed to the following factors: (1) high consumption of electricity (generation of electricity generates NOx and SOx) and (2) use of chemicals like H2SO4 and NaOH during operation (adjusting the pH mainly).
4.8. Terrestrial acidification
In terms of terrestrial acidification, EO (1.71 kg SO2-Eq) and cavitation-based AOPs (1.14 for AuC and 1.55 for HdC) were found to be the least suited options for the treatment of VOCs among all the selected processes in this study (Fig. 9). The emissions are basically from the usage of sulfuric acid and the burning of coal used in the production of electricity. On the other hand, it has been observed that with the introduction of persulfate in cavitation-based AOPs, the potential of acidification drops down drastically (up to 8 times that of without persulfate). Other processes like adsorption, photocatalysis, ozonation, and Fenton contributed a negligible quantity of emissions for their operation.
4.9. Ionizing radiation potential
As can be seen in Fig. 9, the processes like adsorption (0.2 kg U235 Eq) and Fenton (1.17 kg U235 Eq) showed insignificant ionizing potential in comparison with any other processes considered in this study and proved to be the best AOPs among them. On the other hand, cavitation-based processes showed the highest ionizing radiation potential (HdC-53.5 and AuC-19.7 U235 Eq). From the LCA impact values, it is evident that the acoustic cavitation-based AOPs ionization potential was ∼3 times less than that of hydrodynamic cavitation, and the factors mainly responsible for such high variation are the usage of very high electricity (789 kW h in HdC and 129 kW h). Therefore, based on bench scale LCA, it can be concluded that such processes are not suitable due to the higher impact associated with the operation. These observations matched very well with the process contribution chart (Fig. S1†). It assessed the contribution of each process from electricity (2.6–100%), H2O2 (84.6%), and ammonia (∼55.5%). For the electrochemical and PMS oxidation process, the impact contribution was due to electrodes (87.11%) and PMS (64.8%), respectively. A similar observation has been reported previously by Chaplin.202 Based on the single point score, the sustainability of eight treatment technologies can be depicted in the order of adsorption (Ads.) (0.48), ozonation (1.90), EO (4.82), photocatalysis (5.43), Fenton (7.87), US-PMS (31.8), AuC (228), and HdC (245) (Table 5).

5. Existing large scale treatment systems for BTEX contaminated water/site
Groundwater contamination by gasoline is a critical issue worldwide. An aeration-based adsorption column is commonly preferred for the treatment of BTEX in contaminated water as it yields higher removal efficiency (>95%) at an affordable cost.203 However, the efficiency of this method for treating high levels of COD and other long-chain hydrocarbons is significantly low. So, electrochemical cells based on BDD electrodes were testified and scaled up to the pre-pilot level.204 The possibility for BTEX removal by electrochemical units in a continuous mode operation for produced water or contaminated groundwater is still unknown. Coagulation coupled with the electrochemical system to remove BTEX from produced water at the pilot-scale level has been tested.117 In the initial stage, this hybrid technology helps to remove heavy metals and reduce COD and is followed by the EO for BTEX removal. However, the reported cytotoxicity of the treated solution via electrochemical unit is high. Current research for modifying electrode configuration may facilitate a solution to overcome the toxicity of the electrochemical process by more mineralization. In situ chemical remediation was also tested to remove groundwater contaminated with petrochemical effluent. For this purpose, H2O2, O3, permanganate, and PS have been used as oxidants.205,206 Nevertheless, non-selective uptake of oxidants by soil organic matter is an inevitable problem that adversely affects the treatment efficiency of the process. Given this drawback, bio-electrochemical technology has been proposed for treating T and E.207 Nonetheless, the impact of the produced metabolites on microorganisms is unknown.
The use of permeable reactive barriers is another alternative for passive in situ remediation methods with low environmental and energy footprints (compared to traditional pumping techniques). Accordingly, PS-zero valent iron-based slow-release candles were developed as a reactive barrier.205 The treatment efficiency of the material was >91%, with an 11 USD cost for a candle area of 1.87 m2. Continuous gate configuration of permeable reactive barriers had high efficiency and minimum impact on groundwater flow.208 However, zero-valent iron is known to pose nanomaterials-oriented toxicity to biota,209 so using reactive candles to treat groundwater needs further toxicity assessment.
6. Challenges in the BTEX treatment
BTEX has been a known toxic contaminant in water and wastewater over several decades. Many BTEX removal technologies have been developed and tested, but adsorption is the treatment of choice in field scale. Currently, AOP-based treatment options are on pilot-scale testing, though their high energy requirement and economics acts as the barrier. At this stage, it is essential to know the challenges associated with the treatment of BTEX.
The volatility of BTEX is an essential factor to be considered while designing reactors. Volatility increases with an increase in temperature. So, treatment technologies at high temperatures should have a proper way to treat volatilized BTEX in the reaction system. The degradation pathway of BTEX is not well documented in these treatment systems. However, the literature has shown the conversion of X to B but has not investigated the ultimate low-molecular-weight by-products. Though numerous adsorbents were developed to treat BTEX components individually, little effort was undertaken to study their simultaneous removal efficiency.
Further, X generally occupies a greater number of active sites than B, T, and E. Also, an exchange of adsorbed B, T, E by X, or other co-existing pollutants occurs, and this phenomenon is known as a roll-up. It mainly occurs where adsorbate–adsorbent interactions are weaker (e.g., van der Waals or ionic interactions). The roll-up behaviour between VOC molecules should be controlled by increasing the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbents. One possible way to solve this type of issue is composite formation. Again, the chemisorption of the adsorbate on the adsorbent limits the regeneration possibility. Hence, computational models are beneficial to identify the best catalyst/adsorbent and experimental parameters. It helps develop an efficient material for simultaneous removal of BTEX and helps to avoid multiple experimental trials.
7. Conclusions
The hazardous (e.g., carcinogenicity) nature of BTEX insists on continuing research for apt technology to minimize their concentration in the associated medium. Adsorption is a traditional phase separation method used to treat BTEX from groundwater, oil spills, and produced water. In such lines, adsorbents like carbonaceous materials (e.g., AC, CNT, and biomass) and polymeric resin have attracted more attention than traditional (e.g., zeolite) and modern adsorbents (e.g., COF and MOF). The fundamental adsorption mechanisms for BTEX removal were π–π and hydrophobic interactions. The common adsorption trend was X > E > T > B, and the polarity of B limited its removal via adsorption. The strong adsorbate–absorbent interactions and tactic structure of the adsorbents negatively affected the regeneration cycles and adsorption performance. AOPs have become popular VOC treatment options due to their mineralization properties and high degradation kinetics. The simplicity of experimental design and minimal requirement for supporting chemicals made EO a viable choice in treating BTEX from groundwater and produced water at a field scale. LCA analysis depicted the suitability of BTEX treatment technologies in the order of adsorption, EO, and PS. Nonetheless, very high concentrations of BTEX in the field (e.g., petrochemical industry wastewater and oil spill sites) could affect the proposed trend because of concentration tailing and saturation effects. In such cases, the use of hybrid technologies such as coagulation–AOPs–adsorption using green adsorbents is beneficial. Coagulation helps to reduce the interference; AOPs ensure maximum degradation of pollutants; adsorption warrants safe disposal by removing intermediates or toxic by-products. Reactor design and material features of sorbent/catalysts are identified as prime parameters deciding the efficacy of the treatment unit. This review is a comprehensive assessment of the best BTEX treatment technologies and it also analyzes their suitability and likelihood for development to achieve the desired goal with minimum impacts.

Water impact
Owing to the water stress, the removal of contaminants from water and wastewater is becoming a priority area of interest. Industries act as a point source of wastewater pollution, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the primary contaminants. Considering the toxicity and mobility, the removal of VOCs such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene is mandatory. A traditional tertiary treatment option such as adsorption is environmentally and economically beneficial for VOCs. However, identification of a suitable adsorbent with higher adsorption capacity and maximum regeneration with a simple desorption method is essential. On the other hand, handling of high concentrations of VOCs warrants destructive technologies such as an advanced oxidation process to cut down the secondary pollution caused by the spent concentrated adsorbent. Therefore, a brief outlook related to the adsorption capacity of different adsorbents and treatment efficacy of different degradation methodologies may create an insight to select affordable, sustainable treatment methods to remove VOCs from water and wastewater.
