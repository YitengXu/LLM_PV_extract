    , Accepted 11th April 2018First published on 13th April 2018AbstractCharge transport layers (CTLs) play a great role in achieving highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials with high mobility have been proved to be good candidates for CTLs in PSCs. Here, 2D-TiS2 nanosheets are prepared by a simple solution exfoliation method. It is demonstrated that 2D-TiS2 can be applied as an effective electron transport layer in planar PSCs for the first time. Using TiS2 films prepared from solution with an optimized concentration, PSCs show a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.37%. Benefiting from the merits of solution processability, low temperature, high mobility and suitable energy level, the proposed TiS2 fabrication method could aid the scalable production of PSCs with high efficiency and excellent UV stability. Moreover, such a facile and low-temperature film retreatment approach guarantees the application of TiS2 as an ETL in flexible devices.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low cost fabrication process. The highest certified PCE of PSCs is 22.1% with a mesoporous structure,1 which is comparable to that of commercialized Si-based solar cells while the cost of PSCs could be much lower due to their convenient fabrication process.2 Until now, TiO2 is most commonly used as an ETL owing to its favorable energy level and long electron lifetime. However, the TiO2 ETL with a mesoporous structure usually requires high temperature (≈500 °C) annealing/sintering to improve crystallinity and charge carrier mobility,3 which requires high energy consumption and is not compatible with the fabrication of PSCs on flexible substrates. Meanwhile, the low electron mobility, high UV sensitivity and high density of electronic trap states of TiO2 may affect the efficiency and stability of PSCs.4,5 Therefore, the development of another new and low-temperature-processed ETL is highly desirable, especially to offer a wider application on flexible and light-weight substrates at low temperatures.6,7
Fullerene (C60) and its derivatives [[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA)] have already been widely introduced into PSCs as the ETLs.8–10 Nevertheless, fullerene and its derivatives suffer from some drawbacks, such as photochemical instability, limited flexibility of energy levels and costly production processes. Graphene derivatives as 2D materials, represented by graphene oxides (GOs) and reduced graphene oxides (rGOs), show excellent features as promising charge transport materials, such as solution-processability, high conductivity, non-diffusivity, and chemical inertness.11 Recently, graphene and its derivatives have been introduced into PSCs as ETL additives to improve the charge injection and/or collection at the electrodes.12 Unfortunately, apart from additives, the performance of PSCs based on whole graphene derivative ETLs is far from the state-of-the-art ones.
Besides graphene derivatives, other 2D materials, such as black phosphorus,13 MoS2,14,15 WS216,17 and WSe2,18 have been intensively investigated as hole transport layers (HTLs) in organic photovoltaic devices and PSCs owing to their superior mechanical and electrical properties, such as high carrier mobility and conductivity.19 It is found that the use of 2D materials as charge transport layers can not only improve the device performance but also significantly increase the device stability. However, the highest efficiency of PSCs based on 2D material HTLs is only 15%,17 and the application of 2D materials as ETLs in PSCs has not been demonstrated. In this study, we investigated the use of a 2D TiS2 film as an ETL to fabricate PSCs. The TiS2 film is prepared at low temperature by a solution coating process, which shows good electron transport and collection ability, and is comparable to that of a TiO2 film. The TiS2 film also has a suitable conduction band to combine with perovskite layers for high open circuit voltage of the device. As a result, the planar PSC based on the TiS2 ETL fabricated on glass/FTO shows a PCE as high as 17.37%, comparable to that of the device with TiO2 as the ETL (17.07%). More importantly, compared to the PSC with the TiO2 ETL, the PSC with the TiS2 ETL shows higher UV stability as a result of the lower photocatalytic properties of TiS2 films. PSCs based on the TiS2 ETL can retain about 90% of the initial PCE value after 50 h of 10 mW cm−2 UV light soaking.
2. Results and discussion
Liquid-phase exfoliation has proven to be a scalable and simple technique to produce high-yield 2D nanosheets at room temperature, such as graphene, BN and transition metal dichalcogenides.20 In this work, the TiS2 nanosheets are prepared by a facile liquid exfoliation approach.21 TiS2 has a similar structure to MoS2, consisting of a hexagonally packed Ti atom layer sandwiched between two layers of S atoms. These sandwich layers are bound by a weak van der Waals force, which facilitates the exfoliation of a single layer by means of ultrasonic vibration. The whole process of preparing TiS2 nanosheets is shown in Fig. 1a. First, TiS2 powder was thoroughly mixed with IPA followed by ultrasonic vibration for 4 h at 600 W. The exfoliated 2D TiS2 suspension in IPA is centrifuged at a speed of 8000 rpm for 30 min to separate nonexfoliated and thick 2D TiS2 flakes from the IPA solution and an upper suspension containing several layers of 2D TiS2 is obtained. A typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the exfoliated 2D TiS2 nanosheets is shown in Fig. 1b. All the characteristic peaks are completely in line with those of TiS2 (JCPDS 88-1967). The XRD result suggests that the exfoliated TiS2 nanosheets are well crystallized. The thicknesses of the exfoliated TiS2 nanosheets are analyzed by AFM. Fig. 1c and d show the typical AFM image and the thickness distribution diagram of the TiS2 nanosheets, respectively. The SEM image demonstrated that the exfoliated TiS2 nanosheets have an average size of 100–150 nm. The thickness of single layer TiS2 is 0.57 nm,21 and therefore, most of the TiS2 nanosheets have 8–9 layers.

As shown in Fig. 2a, a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image is taken on a selected nanosheet. Energy-filtered TEM is carried out on the same flakes, and the corresponding S and Ti elemental maps are shown in Fig. 2b and c, respectively, and the mappings show the homogeneous elemental distribution of S and Ti over the nanosheet. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is used to quantify the ratio between Ti and S in the TiS2 nanosheets, as shown in the inset table of Fig. 2d, and the ratio of Ti to S is close to 1:2.22 For further details on the structure of the TiS2 nanosheets, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) data were collected through TEM. The HRTEM image is presented in Fig. 2e, from which the interplanar spacing is calculated. The lattice distance d is 0.32 nm, attributed to the (100) crystalline plane of TiS2.19 The diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 2f can also be indexed accordingly to the TiS2 single crystal. The TiS2 film is prepared by spin-coating TiS2 nanosheets in IPA solution on an FTO substrate, which shows a uniform distribution on the substrate (inset of Fig. 3a). The TiS2 film shows good transmittance from UV to visible light wavelengths, which could enhance the perovskite absorption (Fig. S1†). The optical band gap of the TiS2 films is determined by applying the Tauc model in the high absorbance region. The direct optical band gap of the TiS2 thin films is obtained by plotting (αhν)2versus hν (Fig. 3a), where α is the absorption coefficient and hν is the photon energy. The TiS2 film exhibits a band gap of 1.7 eV. As an effective ETL, the materials must have a low work function and high electron mobility and could lower the work function of the cathode and transfer electrons from the perovskite to the cathode efficiently. Therefore, the work-function of the TiS2 film is examined by using ultra-violet photoelectron spectra (UPS). As shown in Fig. 3b, the valence band of the TiS2 film is found to be 5.72 eV, the band gap is 1.7 eV, and so the conduction band is evaluated to be 4.02 eV. The as-prepared TiS2 film has a higher conduction band (4.0 eV) compared with TiO2 (4.2 eV),23,24 implying that TiS2 is more appropriate to form an ohmic contact with the perovskite film and a higher Voc can be expected.

In order to better evaluate the potential of TiS2 as an ETL for application in PSCs, the charge extraction efficiencies of the TiS2 and TiO2 thin films are determined by steady-state PL quenching coating with perovskite films on top of them. As shown in Fig. 3c, the perovskite thin film exhibited an efficient PL quenching on both TiS2 and TiO2 thin films, and the quenching efficiencies are similar for the two types of ETL films (90.2% for sol–gel TiO2 and 87.7% for TiS2), suggesting that the low temperature solution coated TiS2 could work well and had comparable electron extraction and transport to conventional sol–gel based TiO2. This hypothesis is further confirmed by using time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. As shown in Fig. 3d, the pristine perovskite film exhibits a PL lifetime of 57.9 ns. Once coated with TiO2 or TiS2, the PL lifetimes substantially decrease to 5.7 and 5.9 ns, respectively. The shorter PL lifetime for TiS2 agrees well with the lower quenching efficiency obtained in the PL spectrum. These results strongly point to the viability of employing TiS2 as an ETL in PSCs.
To prove further the possible application of TiS2 in PSCs as an ETL, a PSC based on the TiS2 ETL with a normal structure is fabricated. Fig. 4a shows the schematic diagram of planar PSCs with the device structure of FTO/TiS2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The cross-sectional SEM image of the device architecture is shown in Fig. 4b. For the device architecture, a TiS2 nanosheet suspension in IPA solution with a concentration of 1.0 mg ml−1 is prepared and the TiS2 film is deposited on an FTO glass substrate by the spin coating method without any post-treatments. The corresponding energy band diagram of the PSC device is depicted in Fig. 4c. It is found that the band level of the TiS2 matches with that of the perovskite film very well, and as a result, under light illumination, electrons and holes are generated within the perovskite layer and subsequently transported and collected by TiS2/FTO and spiro-OMeTAD/Au, respectively. Based on the high electron extraction ability and suitable band structure of the TiS2 film, high PSC performance can be expected. The dependence of the device performance on the TiS2 thickness is investigated by coating TiS2 solution with different concentrations. The corresponding J–V curves and key J–V parameters are shown in Fig. 4d and Table S1,† respectively. It can be found that when the TiS2 film is prepared with low concentration, the device shows leakage current behavior, leading to a low open-circuit voltage (Voc), poor current density (Jsc), and low fill factor (FF). This could be attributed to the poor coverage of TiS2 on the FTO substrate, which will result in a low shunt resistance and affect the device performance (the shunt and series resistances of PSCs based on different concentrations of TiS2 are calculated from the J–V curves and shown in Table S1†). When the TiS2 film is prepared with high concentration, the series resistance of PSCs is increased which leads to a reduced fill factor and might be caused by the poor conductivity of the thicker TiS2 layer. An optimized device performance is obtained when the TiS2 film is prepared with a concentration of 1 mg ml−1. In order to further optimize the thickness of the TiS2 layer, the spin-coating speed is changed to adjust the TiS2 thickness. Fig. 4e exhibits the J–V curves of PSCs with TiS2 ETLs that were prepared with different spin-coating speeds. The key J–V parameters of the PSCs are summarized in Table S2.† The PSC based on TiS2 that is coated at 5000 rpm exhibits the best PCE of 16.63%. J–V curves of the best performing PSC measured in reverse and forward modes show negligible hysteresis (Fig. S2†). For comparison, control devices using TiO2 as an ETL or without an ETL are also fabricated. Fig. 4f shows the best performance of the PSCs with no ETL, a TiO2 ETL, and a TiS2 ETL, respectively. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs are summarized in Table S3.† The PSCs based on TiS2 ETLs exhibit a Voc of 1.09 V, a Jsc of 21.49 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.23%, leading to a high device efficiency of 16.63%. The PSC with the TiO2 ETL exhibits an efficiency of 17.07% with a Voc of 1.06 V, a Jsc of 21.72 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.14%. This high open-circuit voltage of the PSCs based on TiS2 ETLs should be ascribed to the more favorable band alignment between the MAPbI3 film and electron transport layer, where the conduction bands of TiS2 and TiO2 are 4.0 and 4.2 eV, respectively. The PSC without an ETL exhibits a PCE of 8.71%. The above result indicates that the TiS2 film which is fabricated by using the room-temperature solution processes can be applied as a promising ETL in PSCs, as compared to the conventional TiO2 ETL.

In order to test the versatility of the TiS2 ETL and further improve the efficiency of PSCs, FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 is applied to replace MAPbI3 as the light absorption layer due to its wide light absorption range.25,26Fig. 5a shows the J–V curve for the best-performing FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 device based on the TiS2 ETL, exhibiting a Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 23.38 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.76%, leading to a high device efficiency of 17.37%. Fig. 5b shows the EQE spectrum of the best-performing FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 devices based on TiS2 ETLs, and the photocurrent density obtaining from EQE integration is 23.10 mA cm−2, which is in good accordance with the Jsc measured from the J–V curves (Fig. 5a). The stabilized current density and PCE at the maximum power point (0.86 V) as a function of time are also recorded. As shown in Fig. 5c, a stabilized PCE of 17.1% with a current density of 19.90 mA cm−2 is obtained, showing a stable output characteristic within 500 s.

In fact, the photocatalytic properties of ETLs will influence the stability of perovskite films, specially their UV photocatalytic properties.27 It is well known that TiO2 is an effective ultraviolet photocatalyst to decompose some organic materials28 and perovskite materials can also be photocatalytically degraded even under illumination of the ultraviolet portion of the solar spectrum,4,29 where the photogenerated holes in TiO2 react with oxygen adsorbed at surface oxygen vacancies to decompose perovskite thin films which leads to poor stability for the TiO2-based PSCs.30,31 Several methodologies have been adopted to overcome this issue, such as inserting a thin buffer layer between perovskite and TiO2 and using an ultraviolet filter.32–34 However, the inserted buffer layer or filter often leads to lower device performance due to reduced electron extraction efficiencies or parasitic light absorption. Recently, Chen et al. prepared a 2D TiO2 layer that exhibits high UV transparency and negligible oxygen vacancies,35 which makes the 2D TiO2 layer a promising ETL in the development of stable and high-performance PSCs. Replacing TiO2 with ultraviolet inactive materials is another effective way to reduce the degradation of perovskite.36 Here, we found that TiS2 is an ultraviolet inactive material and can be applied to replace TiO2 for UV stable PSCs. We measured the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 and TiS2 thin films by photoelectrochemical decomposition of water in Na2SO4 aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 6a, the photocurrent of the TiS2 film is much lower than that of the TiO2 film, which means that the TiS2 film has a much lower photocatalytic activity than the TiO2 film. The main reason for the low photocatalytic activity of TiS2 can be attributed to its high UV transparency (Fig. S1†) and lack of sulfur vacancies (Fig. 2d). The much lower photocatalytic activity of the TiS2 film has an important implication for the stability of PSCs. Indeed, the PSC based the TiS2 ETL shows dramatically enhanced UV stability. The UV stability tests of PSCs with TiO2 or TiS2 ETLs are performed under ambient conditions without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 6b, the efficiencies of the PSCs with TiS2 ETLs are decayed by only about 10% of its maximum value after continuous illumination under UV light (10 mW cm−2) for 50 h. In contrast, the efficiencies of the PSCs with TiO2 ETLs are decayed by 44% during the same test period. Therefore, compared with TiO2, the low photocatalytic activity of TiS2 can retard the decomposition of the perovskite material when under UV light illumination. The result suggests that employing TiS2 as the ETL is an effective way to enhance the UV stability of PSCs.

Low-temperature-processed PSCs, which can be fabricated on rigid or flexible substrates, are attracting great attention due to their wide range of applications. To demonstrate the viability of the TiS2 ETL for flexible PSC application, flexible PSCs with TiS2 ETLs are fabricated on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/ITO substrate. As shown in Fig. 7a, the resulting flexible PSC exhibits a Jsc of 20.05 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.95 V, and a FF of 66.93%, with a PCE of 12.75%. Bending tests of the flexible PSCs with different curvature radii are carried out to detect their mechanical stability. Fig. 7b–d show the J–V curves of the devices before and after bending at a curvature radius of 12, 7, and 5 mm and flexing for 300 cycles, respectively, and a vernier caliper is used to define the curvature radius. It is found that the performance of the flexible PSCs exhibits no significant degradation after bending at a curvature radius of 12 mm. The device can retain more than 90% of its initial PCE value even after bending at a curvature radius of 5 mm for 300 cycles, indicating its excellent mechanical stability.

3. Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, 2D TiS2 nanosheets have been obtained by a simple chemical exfoliation process to replace TiO2 as an ETL for planar PSCs. A TiS2 film can be prepared at low temperature by a solution coating process, which shows good electron transport and collection ability, and is comparable to that of a TiO2 film. At an optimized thickness of TiS2, a high PCE of 17.37% was obtained. What is more interesting is that due to the much lower photocatalytic properties of TiS2, the PSCs based on TiS2 ETLs exhibited out-standing UV light-soaking stability compared to devices based on conventional TiO2 ETLs. Our results demonstrate that chemical exfoliated 2D TiS2 holds great promise to act as an ETL material for fabricating low cost and high performance PSCs based on a fully solution-processable fabrication process.
4. Experimental
Preparation of 2D TiS2 nanosheets
TiS2 powder was synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method.19 To obtain 2D TiS2 nanosheets, 1.2 g of TiS2 powder was dispersed in 120 mL isopropanol alcohol (IPA) followed by sonication for 4 h at 600 W. The exfoliated 2D TiS2 suspension in IPA was centrifuged at speed of 8000 rpm for 30 min to separate nonexfoliated materials and thick 2D TiS2 flakes and the supernatant containing several layers of 2D TiS2 was used for preparing TiS2 films.
Device fabrication
The planar PSCs were fabricated with a structure of FTO/ETL/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. FTO based glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of water, acetone and isopropanol alcohol successively. The substrates were treated under UVO for 10 min to obtain hydrophilic surfaces. Then a 2D TiS2 suspension in IPA with different concentrations was spin-coated on the FTO substrates with different speeds. By contrast, a TiO2 film was prepared by the method reported in our previously published studies.37,38 The perovskite precursor solution containing PbI2 (99.99%, Alfa Aesar), CH3NH3I or HC(NH2)2I (Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, Aldrich) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Alfa Aesar). The mixed solution was spin-coated on top of the ETLs (TiS2 or TiO2) at 1000 rpm for 5 s and 4000 rpm for 45 s while dripping chlorobenzene onto the substrate during the second spinning step. The samples were then heated at 100 °C for 10 min (MAPbI3) or 150 °C for 30 min (FA0.85MA0.15PbI3) resulting in the formation of dark perovskite films. Spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene added with 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Sigma Aldrich) and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imidelithium salt (Li-TFSI, Sigma Aldrich) was spin-coated as a hole transport layer on top of the perovskite films. Finally, an 80 nm-thick gold layer was thermally evaporated as the top electrode using a shadow mask to form an device active area of 9 mm2. For the flexible PSCs, PET/ITO was used to replace glass/FTO as the substrate, and the ETL, perovskite layer, spiro-OMeTAD and Au electrodes were prepared by the same process on a rigid glass substrate.
Material and device characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images were recorded with a JEM-2800 JEOL operated at 200 kV. EDS was performed on a TEM (JEM-2800 JEOL). SEM images of TiS2 nanosheets and the cross-sectional images of PSCs were obtained under a HITACHI, SU-8020 microscope. The transmittance spectrum of the TiS2 film was measured by using a UV/Vis NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 950). The XRD spectrum was obtained using a D/MAX 2400 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (Rigaku). Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured by using a PicoQuant FluoTime 300. The band structure of the TiS2 film was analysed using ultra-violet photoelectron spectra (UPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher). The J–V characteristics of the PSCs were collected using a SAN-EI ELECTRIC XES-40S2-CE solar simulator under a simulated sunlight intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The solar simulator was calibrated with a standard silicon reference cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PSC was determined by using a QTest Station 2000ADI system (Crowntech Inc.), including a tungsten–halogen lamp, a Si detector and a monochromator. The photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 and TiS2 thin films were measured with a three-electrode configuration using a Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode and an aqueous solution of 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. Photoelectrochemical current density and time curves were measured under 365 nm UV light illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. For the UV-aging experiment, a UV light source (Kimmon laser, λ = 365 nm) with an intensity of 10 mW cm−2 was used to irradiate the PSCs based on TiS2 and TiO2 ETLs.
