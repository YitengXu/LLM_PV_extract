However, their performances deteriorate as the thickness decreases below 10 nm due to the local deformation induced by the phase change, which makes them less compatible with plasmonic nanogaps. Here, we address this issue by photothermally modulating the refractive index of germanium antimony telluride (GST) placed in plasmonic nanogaps, which tunes plasmon resonances in the visible region below the melting point of GST, making such optical switching highly reversible at a rate of up to hundreds of ∼kHz. They are also demonstrated to modulate the waveguiding efficiency of propagating surface plasmons, which is based on the photothermal modulation of plasmons with the assistance of GST. Such hybrid nanoplasmonic system with cost-effective fabrication and efficient operation method provides a promising route towards integrated nanophotonic chips.
Introduction
Plasmons, due to their strong field enhancement and broadly tunable optical properties, have been widely applied in solar cells, fluorescence enhancement, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, environmental monitors, photodetectors, nanolasers, etc.1–9 In addition, the unique features of ultracompact dimension and fast operating speed make plasmonic nanodevices a promising candidate for high-definition plasmonic displays, nanophotonic circuits, and sensors.10–12 However, the state-of-the-art strategy of plasmonic switching lacks excellent tunability and reversibility with fast optoplasmonic response, which hinders the progress towards this end.
Previous efforts towards tunable plasmons are largely based on (electro)chemistry or external physical fields, which are usually slow in speed.13–20 The optical tuning of plasmons is more attractive for the next-generation nano-optical devices due to its unique advantages of remote controllability and ultrafast speed. However, the modulation frequency of such optoplasmonic devices mostly falls within the infrared or near infrared region.21–25 Although tremendous efforts have been made in optical modulation of surface plasmons in the visible region, their tuning is either irreversible26 or has to be performed in liquid medium,27–29 which significantly limits its applications in optoplasmonic devices.
Germanium antimony telluride (GST) is a well-known phase change material,30,31 which has been vigorously applied for metasurface modulation,32–34 all-photonic non-volatile multi-level memory,35 circuits36,37 and optoelectronic switches.38 However, their modulation frequencies are mostly in the infrared region,39–42 which fails to address much wider applications in the visible region.43–48 Moreover, the sophisticated wiring of the electric circuits adds complexity to the devices, which burdens the aim of integration and miniaturization. Although some efforts have been made to combine GST with plasmonic nanogaps, the reversibility of switching is less robust due to the irreversible nanodeformation of the GST thin films during the repeated phase change,49–51 which compromises their performances for nanoplasmonic devices.
Here, instead of employing the phase-change-induced optical constant change, we make use of the thermo-optical effect of GST, which strongly tunes its refractive index (RI) in the visible region without incurring a strong deformation. As such, the stability and reversibility of plasmonic nanocavities can be maintained during the optical switching process, making it a reliable and robust prototype of optoplasmonic nanoswitches. To construct such thermo-optically tunable plasmonic system, we incorporate the GST thin films in a plasmonic nanocavity made of nanoparticles on a mirror (NPoM) via sputtering and drop-casting. Due to the thermo-optical effect of GST, plasmon resonances can be photothermally modulated at the rate of hundreds of kHz, which is three orders of magnitude larger than the video rate. The shift of the coupled plasmon resonance can reach up to 30 nm due to the large thermo-optical coefficient (βc ∼ 10−3 K−1) of GST in the visible region, which is an order magnitude larger than the commonly known thermo-optical coefficient (∼10−4 K−1). Thus, this tuning amplitude is quite large for solid state optoplasmonic devices as their thermo-optical effect in the visible region is mostly small.52,53 The highly absorptive nature of GST in the visible region also renders it a good nanoheater, which modulates the loss of plasmons. We further demonstrate its optical switching capability of plasmonic waveguides, which is fundamental for plasmonic logic circuits and nanophotonic chips.54
Methods
Sample preparation and characterizations
The gold substrates were firstly fabricated via thermal evaporation. Typically, a 3 nm Cr layer was evaporated on Si substrates, followed by evaporating 70 nm Au film at the rate of 0.8 Å s−1. A layer of 15 nm GST film was deposited on the Au/Cr/Si substrates using radio frequency sputtering at the rate of 5 Å s−1 (Nexdep, Angstrom Engineering) with a vacuum of 6 × 10−6 Pa in Ar atmosphere. The amorphous GST films were annealed at 250 °C before drop-casting 80 nm Au nanoparticles (NPs) (from BBI solutions) or silver nanowires (AgNWs) (4000 × 100 nm from XFNANO) on top.
The Raman spectra of GST were obtained with an exposure time of 1 s and varied excitation power (0.03–2.85 mW) on a confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw InVia) equipped with a ×100 objective lens (NA = 0.8) and a 633 nm laser. The thickness, RI and extinction coefficient of the GST film were determined via ellipsometry (α-SE, J. A. Woollam). SEM (Sigma Zeiss) images of the AgNW were captured at the acceleration voltage of 10 kV.
Nonvolatile optical switching of the plasmon resonances of Au NPoM/GST
The Au NPoMs with GST spacer were irradiated with a ps-pulsed laser (200 ps pulse width with a fluence of 1 μJ, 10 MHz repetition rate) of 633 nm (SC Pro, YSL Photonics) to amorphize and a 532 nm CW laser (OBIS, Coherent) to crystalize the GST layer under the Au NPs. Both laser beams were focused through a ×100 dark field objective (Olympus, NA = 0.8), and the scattering spectra were recorded confocally with a 50 μm fiber coupled to an optofiber spectrometer (integration time: 800 ms, QEPro, Ocean Optics).
Volatile optical switching of the plasmon resonances of Au NPoM/GST
The Au NPoMs with GST spacer were irradiated with a 532 nm CW laser focused through a ×100 dark field objective (Olympus, NA = 0.8). The response speed of the optical switching was determined by digitally modulating the 532 nm CW laser with a function generator (Rigol DG1022U) at ∼20 kHz, and measuring the scattering intensity changes with a photomultiplier tube (PMT1001/M, Thorlabs) monitored with an oscilloscope (DSOX2024A, Keysight). The decay and rise time of optoelectronic signal with laser switched on and off were fitted with the following exponential function:55 (1)where τ is the decay time.
Optical modulation of the waveguiding property of AgNWs on GST films
An incidence of 641 nm CW laser was focused at one end of a AgNW through the same ×100 dark field objective used in the measurement of Au NPoM, and the emitted light at the other end of the NW was collected confocally with an optofiber spectrometer (integration time: 10 ms). A modulation beam of 532 nm laser was focused on different spots of the AgNW at varied power to adjust the output intensity of the 641 nm light.
Simulations
The temperature distribution around the Au NPs were calculated based on the Maxwell equations for photothermal conversion and Laplace equation for solid thermal conduction. The RI of GST was set as 4 and 3.5. The RI of Au and Si were obtained from Johnson–Christy and Aspnes, respectively.56,57 The thermal conductivities of Au and GST are 318 and 2 W m−1 K−1, respectively. The plasmon resonance of Au NPoM was calculated based on the following circuit model,58 (2)where εg and εd are the permittivity of the gap and surrounding dielectric medium, respectively. R is the radius of the Au NP and d is the gap size.
The mode analysis and effective RI of AgNW was calculated with the finite element method (FEM).59 Specifically, a finite length of AgNW was placed on the GST substrate with variable dielectric constant of 4 + 2.5i and 3.5 + 3.5i representing the state of laser off and on, respectively. An electromagnetic envelope was employed as the physical field interface.
Results and discussion
The temperature-dependent optical property of GST is critical for the dynamic tuning of the plasmon resonances of Au NPoM (ESI, Fig. S1a and b†), whose wavelength can be photothermally modulated with picosecond pulsed (ps-pulsed, 633 nm) and continuous wave (CW, 532 nm) lasers (Fig. 1a), exhibiting the semi-reversible shift of a scattering peak between 760 and 800 nm (Fig. 1b). The local temperature around the NPoM can go up to 250 °C (the phase transition temperature) with just 3 mW laser power (ESI, Fig. S1c†), which is sufficient to induce crystallization of GST. With the ps-pulsed laser, both the heating and cooling rates are extremely fast (∼ns),60 which preserves the amorphous phase when the laser was switched off. As a consequence, nonvolatile plasmonic switching can be realized with the alternative irradiation of pulsed and CW laser (Fig. 1c). The phase transition of GST was also confirmed with Raman spectra (Fig. 1d), which shows decreased Raman intensity at 123.17 and 141.02 cm−1 after pulsed laser irradiation, suggesting the amorphization of GST (ESI Fig. S2†). Since the RI of GST changes from 4.0 to 3.5 when it is amorphized (ESI Fig. S1b†),31 the plasmon peak blue-shifts from ∼800 to ∼760 nm, as confirmed with simulations (Fig. 1e). Calculation via circuit model suggests the gap size is ∼20 nm, which also agrees with the spectral shift in the experiments (Fig. 1f).

However, as the GST film sandwiched in the nanogaps is very thin, it is noteworthy that the thermal deformation of the GST and Au NPs with multiple cycles of heating and cooling renders an incomplete recovery or even partial breakdown, resulting in large variability or even irreversibility in later cycles (Fig. 1b and c). To overcome this issue, we applied a low power CW laser on the Au NPoM, which increased the local temperature of GST but below its melting point to eliminate the deformation. However, the power was still high enough to result in a noticeable modulation of the RI and subsequently the plasmon resonances. In this way, the plasmonic modulation is dynamic and volatile as the RI of GST changes with temperature, but the switching speed can be much faster.
Indeed, the blue-shifts of the plasmon resonances with increasing laser power can reach up to 30 nm (Fig. 2a and b) because the increase of temperature leads to the decrease of RI (ESI, Fig. S1†). No phase change of GST happens upon laser irradiation as they were already crystalline to start with. Different from the shift observed in Fig. 1b, this blue shift is mainly due to the photothermal modulation of the RI of the GST medium, which is volatile and reversible when the laser is switched off (Fig. 2c). Thus, the photorefractive and photobleaching/darkening effects of the metal chalcogenide61 on the plasmon shift is not likely, as they normally lead to a nonvolatile change of the RI.62 Such optical switching of the coupled plasmon is very robust, which can be cycled for many times (Fig. 2d). The reason for such volatile switching is mainly due to the change of local temperature, as evidenced by the power-dependent Raman spectra (Fig. 2e). The Raman peak shift is related to the change of the phonon vibration frequency of GST, which is very reversible for cycles of high and low power excitation (Fig. 1f).63 Thus, the optical properties of GST can be dynamically tuned simply by attenuating the laser power, which can be harnessed to modulate the resonance of the gap plasmons.

(g) Schematic of the experimental setup for the measurement of the response speed. (h) Change of the light scattering signal (integrated over 550 nm–750 nm) in response to the square wave function modulation of the laser. 
The photoswitching of the plasmon resonances due to the change of RI via the thermo-optical effect can be approximated by the formula:64 n(T0 + ΔT) = n0 + βΔT(3)where n is the RI of GST at the temperature of T0 + ΔT, and β is the thermo-optical coefficient. The linear correlation of RI and temperature change gives the fitted β value of ∼−1.8 × 10−3 K−1 in the visible region (ESI Fig. S1b†), which is an order of magnitude larger than the thermo-optical coefficient of most materials.
We attempted to measure the response speed of the optical switching by modulating the laser beam with a function generator (FG), and monitoring the plasmon scattering signal change with an oscilloscope (Fig. 2g). A response time of a few μs can be resolved (2 μs for the switch-on and 6 μs for switch-off), which is 1000 times faster than the video rate. The lag time in response to the square wave trigger (blue line in Fig. 2h) is due to the response delay of the laser, which was calibrated with a mirror reflector without any GST (ESI Fig. S3†). Such fast switching speed is mainly due to the fast heating and cooling rate in nanogaps (usually in ∼ns time scale).60 This response speed is an order of magnitude slower than other fast photonic switching systems (sub-μs) based on similar phase change materials65–67 which however normally work in the infrared region. Since such fast plasmon switching is based on a single Au NPoM structure with an ultra-small volume, they can be potentially integrated into nanophotonic chips.
The absorptive nature of GST also renders it a good photothermal convertor for efficient nanoheating, which can also be utilized for plasmon modulation. Here, we place a plasmonic waveguide of AgNWs on top of GST thin films, which presents plasmonic scattering at 550 nm (Fig. 3a). The surface plasmon propagation (SPP, 641 nm) along the AgNW can also be modulated with a CW laser (532 nm), whose intensity drops at the output end when the 532 nm laser is switched on (Fig. 3b). The decrease of its intensity is not attributed to the photo-damage of AgNW as it can be reversibly modulated for many cycles, which shows an on–off ratio of ∼1.5 (Fig. 3c). We performed the mode analysis of the AgNW on GST/Si, and found that the effective RI of AgNW is 6.14 − 3.1i with laser off and 6.8 − 2.86i with laser on (Fig. 3d). Thus, in principle, it should increase the SPP propagation length when the laser is on due to its lower loss. This is also supported by the SPP near field simulations, which show a slightly higher intensity at the out-coupling end with 532 nm laser irradiation (Fig. 3e and ESI-Fig. S4†). However, our results (Fig. 3b) seem to be contradictory to this prediction. This is likely because the laser heating effect from the GST increases the loss of the AgNWs much further,68 which results in lower waveguiding efficiency when the 532 nm laser is on.

Inset is the dark field image of the AgNW with waveguiding performance of the 641 nm laser. Labels (a–c) indicate the modulation spots of the 532 nm laser, which is filtered out before the camera. (g) Change of the laser spectra at the out-couple end of AgNW with different modulation powers (532 nm). Inset is the change of the out-coupling laser (641 nm) intensity with modulation power. 
The optical modulation of the SPP transmission is also dependent on the location of the irradiation (Fig. 3f). A stronger decay is observed when the modulation beam spot is closer to the input end of the light, whereas no decrease of the SPP intensity is observed if the modulation takes place at the output end. This location-dependent modulation suggests that the efficiency of input coupling is strongly affected by the photothermal heating and the RI change of the GST medium.
The SPP transmission efficiency can also be attenuated by adjusting the modulation power, which shows a nonlinear correlation (Fig. 3g). This is reasonable as the optical constants change of GST happens only when the local temperature reaches a certain threshold (220 °C), which exactly matches the power threshold of the irradiation (∼0.7 mW, ESI, Fig. S5†).
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a dynamic and reversibly tunable plasmonic system based on Au NPoM with GST thin films that can be optically modulated, which serves as a key component for integrated optoplasmonic nanodevices. This modulation mechanism is based on the photothermal induced RI change of GST but not the phase change, which eliminates the irreversibility caused by deformation. The tuning range of the coupled plasmon resonances can reach up to ∼30 nm with mW laser power, which is fast (hundreds of kHz) and energy saving. These advanced performances benefit enormously from the optical constants change of GST, which is highly compatible for device fabrication. We further demonstrate this material system as a photothermal modulator for SPP transmission, which is essential for on-chip optical circuits and optical computation.54 We envisage that a plethora of applications can be exploited based on this photothermal effect of the nonvolatile phase change plasmonic system, which will benefit the future of nanophotonic devices.
