    , Accepted 8th November 2014First published on 10th November 2014AbstractFlexible ultra-thin silicon (∼30 μm thickness) solar cells implemented with an energy-down-shift layer showed stable flexible and twistable characteristics. In particular, spin-coating Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) on the cells enhanced the PCE by ∼0.7% through an energy-down-shift effect that enhanced the external quantum efficiency in the UV light region. In addition, the cells demonstrated an excellent bending fatigue performance because their PCE levels were sustained at ∼12.4% after 5000 bending cycles under a strain of ∼5.72%.
Introduction
For the past few decades, flexible or bendable silicon,1,2 dye-sensitized,3,4 organic,5–7 and hybrid solar cells8,9 have been intensively researched as means to improve power conversion efficiency (PCE) and minimize cell fabrication cost because of their attractive applications, which include building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), electronics-integrated photovoltaic (EIPV), portable electronics power, and automobile-integrated photovoltaic applications. Although flexible or bendable dye-sensitized, organic, and hybrid solar cells have demonstrated reasonable PCE and fabrication cost for actual photovoltaic application, their PCE values are still considerably low, and their fabrication costs are higher than those of solid silicon solar cells. Recently, S. Jeong et al.10 reported an ultra-thin silicon (∼10 μm thickness) solar cell showing a maximum PCE of 13.7%. However, it was fabricated with typical high-cost semiconductor device processes, such as SOI wafer, photolithography, and deep reactive-ion etching. In addition, it could not demonstrate good flexible or bendable characteristics. Thus, we developed a flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cell implemented with an energy-down-shift layer comprising Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs).11–13 In particular, it should be noted that to fabricate solar cells at low cost, we introduced ultra-thin silicon (∼30 μm in thickness) via potassium hydroxide (KOH) etching, p–n junction formation via phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) doping, back surface field formation via thin aluminium (Al) film evaporation and rapid thermal annealing, top electrode patterning via thin film silver (Ag) evaporation, anti-reflective coating using a silicon nitride (SiNx) anti-reflective film formed by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, and core/shell QD spin-coating. In addition, to enhance PCE in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength region, we implemented an energy-down-shift layer by coating Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell QDs on flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cells. In our study, we characterized physical, optical, electrical, and flexible properties in detail to achieve flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cells implemented with an energy-down-shift layer.
Results and discussion
A detailed vertical structure of our developed flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cell implemented with an energy-down-shift layer comprises an ∼10 nm thick energy-down-shift layer spin-coated with Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell QDs, an ∼95 nm thick SiNx anti-reflective film, an ∼500 nm thick Ag front-side electrode, an ∼30 μm thick silicon including a p/n junction, an ∼700 nm Al back-side electrode, and an ∼180 μm thick flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, as shown in Fig. 1a. The cell exhibited good flexible and twistable characteristics, which are useful for installing solar cells on the curved surfaces of buildings or automobiles (Fig. 1b) and on wearable devices (Fig. 1c and Video 1†). In addition, a flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cell implemented with an energy-down-shift layer did not emit any light after irradiating visible light on the solar cell surface, whereas it emitted visible light after irradiating UV light on the solar-cell surface, as shown in Fig. 1d. Furthermore, it demonstrated a good fatigue performance, as shown in Fig. 1e.

The physical, chemical, and optical properties of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell QDs demonstrated energy-down-shift, as shown in Fig. 2. The QDs showed a spherical shape, were well crystallized, and were well dispersed with each other, as shown in Fig. 2a. The average QD diameter was ∼6.7 nm, as shown in Fig. 2b. Fig. 2c shows an energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) line scan and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image, which evidently depict a core/shell QD structure, in which the chemical composition of the core QDs having a diameter of ∼4.0 nm was Cd0.5Zn0.5S while that of the 1.3 nm thickness shell QDs was ZnS. It should be noted that the Cd0.5Zn0.5S composition of core QDs was confirmed through the exact recalculation performed by considering the volume of the core QDs, although the EDX line scan indicated a Cd0.19Zn0.43S0.38 composition. Fig. 2d shows the crystalline structure of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell QDs, which was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The Cd0.5Zn0.5S core QDs exhibited peaks for (100), (002), (110), and (112) planes, which were observed at 26.44°, 28.22°, 46.66°, and 55.43°, whereas the ZnS shell QDs showed peaks for (111), (220), and (311) planes, which were observed at 28.26°, 46.99°, and 55.74°, respectively (JCPDS Cards: 01-9251, 12-6328). The XRD results indicate that the crystalline structure of the core QDs was hexagonal, whereas that of the shell QDs was a wurtzite structure. In addition, the Scherrer's equation of XRD patterns showed that the core QDs were 3.9 nm in diameter, which was similar to the diameter observed by TEM-EDX. The diameter using Scherrer's equation is given by14 (1)where τ is the mean size of crystalline domains, K is a dimensionless shape factor, β is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), and θ is the Bragg angle. To confirm the energy-down-shift of the core/shell QDs, UV-visible and photo-luminescence (PL) spectroscopies were used to measure the absorption of UV followed by the emission of visible light, which is the concept of energy-down-shift, as shown in Fig. 2e. In a quartz cuvette, a 0.3 wt% Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell QDs solution absorbed ∼100% light in the wavelength between 250 and 450 nm (the red solid line in Fig. 2e) and emitted a blue light (442 nm) after UV light was passed through the cuvette (the left image in the inset of Fig. 2e). In addition, a thin film layer on glass, spin-coated with the 0.3 wt% core/shell QDs solution, absorbed ∼80% light in the wavelength between 220 and 450 nm (the green solid line in Fig. 2e). A thin film layer on a flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cell spin-coated with the 0.3 wt% core/shell QDs solution emitted a blue light after being irradiated with UV light (the right image in the inset of Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the 0.3 wt% core/shell QDs solution in the cuvette emitted a 442 nm wavelength PL signal with a quantum yield of 79.9%, using Rhodamine 6G in ethanol as a ref. 15 (80.2% using quinine sulfate in 0.5 M H2SO4 as a reference),16 as shown in the blue solid line of Fig. 2e. The optical properties in Fig. 2e evidently demonstrated an energy-down-shift, in which the core/shell QDs absorbed UV light in wavelengths between 250 and 450 nm and emitted a blue light of 442 nm wavelength. The emitted 442 nm wavelength blue light would be produced via the exciton recombination process at the Cd0.5Zn0.5S core quantum-dot and due to the red shift induced by the compressive strain at the interface between the Cd0.5Zn0.5S core QD and ZnS shell QD (see ESI Table 1†). It should be noted that the wavelength and quantum yield of the emitted blue light from the Cd1−xZnxS/ZnS core/shell QDs strongly depended on the thickness of ZnS shell (see ESI Fig. 1†).17,18 In addition, the optical properties of core/shell QDs showed that the energy band gap of the core QDs was ∼2.81 eV,19 corresponding to the emitted 442 nm wavelength PL signal (blue visible light), whereas that of the shell QDs was ∼3.56 eV,20 corresponding to the absorption of ∼301 nm wavelength UV light, as shown in Fig. 3f. Because the energy band gap of the shell QDs (∼3.56 eV) was higher than that of the core QDs (∼2.81 eV), and because the diameter of the core QDs (∼4.0 nm) is considerably small, the core QDs would be easily quantized with E1, E2, and E3 and H1, H2, and H3, where E and H are the quantized states for the electrons and holes, and the subscript is the quantum number. Thus, the core/shell QDs would absorb UV light in wavelengths between 250 and 450 nm, and then generate electron–hole pairs at E2 and H1 or E3 and H1. Subsequently, the excited electrons would be transited from E3 to E1 or from E2 to E1 by transferring thermal energy to the Cd0.5Zn0.5S core QD lattices. Finally, the recombination of electrons at E1 and holes at H1 would emit 442 nm wavelength blue light, resulting into an energy-down-shift. Therefore, implementing the Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell QDs via spin-coating on the surface of a flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cell would absorb UV light, and then emit blue light. The emitted blue light would be reabsorbed through the surface of the cell, resulting in enhanced external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the UV light wavelength region. It should be noted that a silicon solar cell could not absorb the UV light because of ∼1.1 eV energy band gap of Si.

To confirm the optical properties of the flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cell implemented with the Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell QDs, the cross-sectional surface structure was observed by TEM, and the surface reflectance was measured as a function of wavelength. The core/shell QDs layer on the SiNx anti-reflective film was well-dispersed, as shown in Fig. 3a. The surface reflectance of an ultra-thin silicon solar cell without an anti-reflective film and QD layer rapidly decreased from ∼69–32% when the wavelength was increased from 250 to 1100 nm, as shown in Fig. 3b. Furthermore, depositing the anti-reflective film on the cell sharply reduced the surface reflectance because of the effects of the anti-reflective layer, i.e., the surface reflectance peaked to ∼47% at the wavelength of ∼400 nm and dropped to ∼7% at wavelengths between 700 and 1000 nm. In addition, spin-coating the core/shell QDs on the anti-reflective film showed a dependency of surface reflectance on wavelength similar to that obtained by merely depositing the anti-reflective film on the cell. However, spin-coating the core/shell QDs reduced the surface reflectance to ∼10% at the maximum wavelength (∼400 nm), demonstrating evidence of energy-down-shift.
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the cell implemented with the core/shell QDs layer, EQE was estimated as a function of wavelength. The EQE for a cell without the anti-reflective film and without the QDs layer increased from ∼23% to ∼62% when the wavelength increased from 300 to ∼600 nm, and then decreased from ∼62% to less than 6% when the wavelength decreased from 600 to 1100 nm. It peaked at ∼62% at 600 nm wavelength, as shown in Fig. 4a. Furthermore, the deposition of an anti-reflective film on the cell slightly increased the EQE by ∼10% in the UV light region (300–400 nm), whereas it greatly increased it by ∼24% in the visible light region (400–950 nm). It should be noted that the EQE strongly depended on the thickness of the anti-reflective film (see ESI Fig. 2†). In particular, spin-coating the core/shell QDs on the anti-reflective film considerably increased the EQE by ∼27% in the UV light region, but did not enhance it in the visible light region (400–900 nm), thus demonstrating an energy-down-shift. These results indicate that depositing the anti-reflective film mainly enhances the EQE in the visible light region (400–950 nm), whereas spin-coating the core/shell QDs principally enhances it in the UV light region (300–400 nm). In addition, the surface reflectance in Fig. 3b is well correlated with the EQE in Fig. 4a, i.e., a lower surface reflectance leads to a high EQE.

The effects of the anti-reflective film and the core/shell QDs layer on the electrical performances of the flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cells are shown in Fig. 4b (ESI Fig. 3†). The short-circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and PCE for an ultra-thin silicon solar cell without the anti-reflective film and the QDs layer were 21.52 mA cm−2, 0.495 V, 75.74%, and 8.07%, respectively. For a cell with the anti-reflective film, the JSC sharply increased from 21.52 to 31.35 mA cm−2, whereas the VOC and FF did not change, resulting in the PCE being substantially enhanced from 8.07% to 11.70%. In addition, with the core/shell QDs on the anti-reflective film, JSC considerably increased from 31.35 to 33.05 mA cm−2 because of the energy-down-shift effect, whereas the VOC and FF did not change, thus increasing the PCE from 11.70% to 12.37%, as can be seen by comparing Fig. 4a with Fig. 4b. These results imply that depositing the anti-reflective film enhances the JSC, which is mainly due to the anti-reflective layer effect, whereas spin-coating the core/shell QDs mainly enhances it because of the energy-down-shift effect. In particular, the comparison of Fig. 4a with Fig. 4b, demonstrates the energy-down-shift effect, where the core/shell QDs absorb the UV light and emit visible light (blue light) and the emitted visible light is reabsorbed into the cell.
To evaluate the bending fatigue characteristic for the cell implemented with the core/shell QDs, a bending test was performed under the conditions of a 12.7 mm Bending radius (R) and a 5000 bending cycles, as shown in Fig. 5. The applied strain for this bending test was ∼5.72%, as calculated by eqn (2).21 (2)where, ε is the strain, R is the bending radius, χ is Yf/Ys, Yf, Ys are the Young's moduli of the film and substrate, respectively, η is df/ds, df, ds are the film and substrate thickness, respectively. The flexible characteristic for a cell implemented with the core/shell QDs is well demonstrated in Video 2.† In particular, when exposed to UV light, the cell emitted a blue light under the bending test, as shown in Fig. 5a and Video 3 and 4.† All the cells showed a good bending fatigue characteristic, i.e., their PCE values did not change after 5000 bending cycles, as shown in Fig. 5b. The dependencies of JSC and VOC on the bending cycles are shown in ESI Fig. 4.† Thus, the cells implemented with the core/shell QDs achieved good bending fatigue results with a high PCE (∼12.37%).

Experimental
Quantum dot synthesis
A hot injection method was used for the synthesis of Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell QDs. In the synthesis process, 1 mmol of cadmium oxide (CdO), 7.5 mL of oleic acid (OA), and 10 mmol of zinc oxide (ZnO) were mixed at room temperature and reacted at 150 °C. After reaching 150 °C, the reaction flask was filled with N2 gas and injected with 15 mL of 1-octadecene (1-ODE). Subsequently, the distilled mixture was heated to 300 °C to produce a transparent solution of Cd(OA)2 and Zn(OA)2. Then, 2 mmol of sulfur powder was dissolved in 3 mL of 1-ODE and purged with N2, and the purged sulfur solution was quickly injected into the reaction flask and allowed to react. After the sulfur precursor was injected, the temperature of the reaction flask was elevated to 310 °C for growing Cd0.5Zn0.5S core QDs (nucleation process). After the elapse of the reaction for 8 min, a N2 purged and sulfur solution when 8 mmol of sulfur powder was dissolved in 5 mL of OA was introduced into the reactor to cap the existing Cd0.5Zn0.5S core QDs with a ZnS shell without any purification step. After 40 min, ZnS shell was obtained, and the solution dispersed with QDs was allowed to cool down to room temperature, and then centrifuged with an additional amount of methanol and acetone to eliminate impurities. Finally, the precipitated QDs were re-dispersed in chloroform. The detailed morphology, size distribution, absorption, chemical composition ratio, and PL for the QDs were characterized by high-resolution TEM at 200 kV, UV visible spectroscopy, XRD, EDX line-scan profile and PL spectroscopy using a HeCd laser source with 325 nm wavelength. The quantum yield (QY) of the QDs was measured and estimated by comparing their fluorescence intensities with those of primary standard solutions (QY: 95% Rhodamine 6G in ethanol and 54% quinine sulfate in 0.5 M H2SO4) at the same optical density (optical density = 0.05) and excitation wavelength (325 nm).
Solar-cell fabrication

Fig. 6 shows the flowchart of the fabrication of flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cells implemented with an energy-down-shift layer. Single-crystal silicon wafers doped with boron (10 Ω cm) were used and cut into substrate pieces with areas of 50 × 50 mm2 and thicknesses of 725 μm. The substrates were etched using KOH at 90 °C for 8.5 h, reducing the thickness to ∼30 μm, producing a flexible ultra-thin silicon substrate. When attached to ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and PET films, the substrate showed flexible or twistable characteristics, as demonstrated in Video 5 and 6.† Because the EVA film showed a weak thermal characteristic, the PET film was selected as a holding substrate for the flexible ultra-thin silicon substrate. To fabricate solar cells, the silicon substrate samples were subjected to phosphorous silicate glass deposition at 790 °C for 15 min and phosphorous diffusion at 810 °C for 5 min to produce an n-doping layer, resulting in an emitter resistance of 125 Ω □−1. Subsequently, the silicon substrates were etched using diluted hydrofluoric acid to remove the phosphorous silicate glass film. Bottom Al electrodes, 700 nm thick, were thermally evaporated at an evaporation rate of 3.0 Å s−1. To form the back surface field, they were heat-treated using rapid thermal annealing at 400 °C for 1 s. Top Ag electrodes, 500 nm thick, were thermally evaporated at 2.0 Å s−1 evaporation rate. Then, a 95 nm thick SiNx anti-reflective film was deposited by low frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. It should be noted that the anti-reflective film showed a maximum EQE (see ESI Fig. 2†). A 0.3 wt% Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell QDs solution was dropped on the cell coated with the anti-reflective film, then the cell was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 95 °C for 10 min to dry the solvent of the QDs solution. The thickness of the ∼0.3 wt% QDs layer after spin-coating was ∼7.9 nm, as measured by TEM. The surface reflectance of the flexible ultra-thin silicon solar-cells was estimated by UV-visible light spectrometry (Varian Cary-5000 UV-Visible Spectrophotometer). Photovoltaic performances, such as JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE, were estimated using a solar simulator (McScience LAB-160).

Conclusions
A flexible ultra-thin silicon (∼30 μm thickness) solar cell substrate was produced by a simple low-cost wet etching process using KOH, which demonstrated excellent twistable or flexible characteristics. Novel low-cost solar cell fabrication processes were used to produce a flexible ultra-thin silicon solar-cell substrate, e.g., thermal Al evaporation followed by rapid thermal annealing at 400 °C for 1 s for the back-side electrode, thermal Ag evaporation without firing for the front-side electrode, and SiNx anti-reflective layer deposition after the formation of front-side electrode. In addition, implementing an energy-down-shift layer via spin-coating Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS core/shell QDs on the cell, increased its PCE to 12.4% because the core/shell QDs absorb UV light and emit visible light (blue light), and the emitted visible light reabsorbs into the cell. In particular, the fabrication cost and PCE (12.4%) for the cells implemented with the energy-down-shift layer would be cheaper and higher than those for previous flexible silicon-based solar cells (i.e., silicon nanowire,22 silicon pyramid,23 and silicon nanocone24 hybrid organic–inorganic silicon solar cell). It should be noted that flexible dye-sensitized solar cells,3 flexible hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells,9 and flexible organic solar cells6 have achieved PCE of ∼5.8%, 12%, and 8.4%, respectively. Furthermore, our developed solar cells implemented with an energy-down-shift layer demonstrated an excellent bending-fatigue performance for about 5000 bending cycles with 5.72% strain. This property makes them practical and suitable for BIPV, EIPV, portable electronics power, and automobile-integrated photovoltaic applications. Implementing the ultra-thin cells with an energy-down-shift layer comprising core/shell QDs and with energy-up-conversion via doped core/shell QDs could further enhance the PCE of flexible silicon solar cells. It should be noted that the doped core/shell QDs providing energy-up-conversion absorb infra-red light and then emit visible light, which is reabsorbed into the cell. Thus, further study on flexible ultra-thin silicon solar cells implemented with energy-up-conversion will be necessary to maximize the PCE of the cells.25,26
