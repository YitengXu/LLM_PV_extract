In this paper, CsPbBr3 single crystal growth was conducted by a creative electronic dynamic gradient (EDG) method.

X-ray diffraction techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-dependent X-ray powder diffraction and the X-ray rocking curve, were used to identify the phase and to investigate phase transition rules. Electron diffraction techniques, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), were used to investigate the crystal micro-structure.

1. Introduction
Lead halide perovskite materials have attracted significant attention in the context of photovoltaics and other optoelectronic applications in recent years. The demonstrated optoelectronic applications of lead halide perovskites include high-efficiency solar cells,1,2 lasers,3,4 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),5,6 and high-gain photodetectors.7–10 However, organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite materials (with the general formula APbX3) are often criticized for their inherent instability, such as high sensitivity to oxygen and moisture.11,12 This instability originated from A-site organic cations or cationic clusters (MA+, FA+, et. al).1–3,11,13 Recently, more and more research efforts have been directed to all-inorganic lead halide perovskites,14–19 which have better mechanical and moisture stability than organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide ones. Benefiting from their promising properties such as excellent optical performance, high charge carrier mobility and general tolerance to defects, all-inorganic lead halide perovskites MPbX3 (M = K, Rb, and Cs, X = I, Br, and Cl) have drawn much attention to themselves.20–22 Furthermore, these all-inorganic lead halide perovskites show nearly the same power conversion efficiency as the leading solar cell material, hybrid organic–inorganic CH3NH3PbI3.23
In this study, we turn readers' attention to one kind of all-inorganic lead halide perovskite, cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3). CsPbBr3 is an attractive detection medium for nuclear radiation in view of its relatively high density (4.84 g cm−3) and high average atomic number (Cs: 55, Pb: 82 and Br: 35). Additionally, its large band gap (2.25 eV) offers the possibility of low noise performance at room temperature. What is more, CsPbBr3 has the same order of carrier mobility lifetime products for both electrons and holes (1.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 and 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 for electrons and holes, respectively),7 implying that no special engineering methodologies are required for patching mismatches between holes and electrons. Thus, this ternary compound shows potential characteristic of optoelectronic performance, especially in high energy radiation detection.7,10 However, the overwhelming majority of perovskite devices are based upon polycrystalline thin films, which suffer immensely from a high density of traps and grain boundaries. Compared with polycrystalline CsPbBr3 thin films, CsPbBr3 single crystals display exceptionally low trap densities (6 orders of magnitude lower compared to the polycrystalline films).24 However, the available research on the structure and physical properties of CsPbBr3 single crystals is not very sufficient and many great gaps need to be filled. Therefore, the potential application of these polycrystalline devices is markedly limited. Although the synthesis, crystallography, and photoconductivity of all-inorganic lead halide perovskites have been first reported more than 50 years ago, few researchers have focused on direct band-gap MPbX3 single crystals until 2015.25 Therefore, the growing interest in perovskite single crystals motivated us to develop facile methods for the single crystal growth of CsPbBr3.7,10,14,26
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline powders
Synthesis of the CsPbBr3 polycrystalline powders was carried out by a chemical co-precipitation method.27 Commercially available lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.999%) and cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.999%) were supplied by Alfa Aesar (Saint Louis, UK). Aqueous hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48 wt% in H2O, 99.99% metal basis) was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). PbBr2 (20 mmol, 7.34 g) and CsBr (20 mmol, 4.26 g) were respectively dissolved in hydrobromic acid [48% HBr(aq)] in separate beakers to form PbBr2 and CsBr solutions in advance. Then the solutions were simultaneously added dropwise into 5 ml of 48% aqueous HBr with stirring during the synthesis reaction. The precipitation reaction is as follows: PbBr2 + CsBr = CsPbBr3↓(1)
A bright orange precipitate of CsPbBr3 immediately formed in the aqueous HBr solution. The precipitate was filtered, copiously rinsed three times with absolute ethyl alcohol and then dried under vacuum to obtain orange CsPbBr3 polycrystalline powders.
2.2 Tube furnace and EDG crystal growth
The thermogravimetric analysis of the CsPbBr3 powders is described in the ESI† (Section 1.1 and Fig. S1 and S2). The melting point and solidifying point were 567 °C and 550 °C, according to Fig. S1.† The melting point is the same result as that reported in ref. 7, but the solidifying point had a slight deviation. This deviation may come from the different degree of supercooling under diverse testing conditions (rate of temperature rise, protective atmosphere, etc.). The reported crystal structure transitions from the orthorhombic (Pnma) to the tetragonal (P4/mbm) symmetries and from tetragonal (P4/mbm) to cubic (Pmm) were not observed in our analysis, possibly due to insufficient sensitivity of the measurement.7,14,28 The single crystal growth was conducted in a self-designed vertical two-zone tube furnace by a simplified electronic dynamic gradient (EDG) method.29 The detailed procedure of CsPbBr3 crystal growth is described in the ESI† (Section 1.2 and Fig. S3).
2.3 Structural characterization
The crystal structure was systematically investigated using scientific instruments and equipment. A BRUKER AXS D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer equipped with a heating system was used to carry out the phase identification of the crystal. The rocking curve was tested in ω scan mode using a CuK1 source with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å under a generator voltage of 40 kV and a generator current of 40 mA. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed using a Tecnai F30 G2 electron microscope with an incident electron energy of 300 keV. The micro-structural crystallographic characterization of the crystal was conducted by means of EBSD patterns using an FEI Nova Sirion 200 at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.
2.4 Optical characterization
The quality of the crystal was mainly characterized via the optical performance. The optical transmittance was studied using a Bruker Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer (wavenumber range 1000–4000 cm−1) and a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (wavelength range 190–2600 nm) at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase identification of CsPbBr3 powders
The powder XRD patterns of the synthesized polycrystalline powders, together with the standard patterns of the cubic phase (ICSD 29073, Pmm (221), a = b = c = 0.5874 nm)30 and the orthorhombic phase (ICSD 97851, Pbnm (62), a = 0.8207 nm, b = 0.8255 nm, c = 1.1759 nm)31 of CsPbBr3 are shown in Fig. 1. The standard patterns of the tetragonal phase (ICSD 109295, P4/mbm (99), a = b = 0.5859 nm, c = 0.5895 nm)32 are shown in Fig. S4.† It was illustrated that the first three strong peaks of the synthesized polycrystalline powders, namely, (110) at 15.198°, (112) at 21.443° and (220) at 30.663°, matched well with the standard orthorhombic perovskite structure. Thus, the synthesized powders can be identified as CsPbBr3 powders. Meanwhile, the clear splitting of the (110) and (220) diffraction peaks further indicated that the synthesized CsPbBr3 polycrystalline powders may be of the room-temperature orthorhombic phase (Pbnm),3 but further study was needed to prove it.

In order to further study the final phase of the CsPbBr3 crystal, a small portion of the grown CsPbBr3 ingot was ground into fine powders. Then temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction was used to study the phase transitions of CsPbBr3, and the results are shown in Fig. 2, with the standard patterns of the cubic (ICSD 29073), tetragonal (ICSD 109295) and orthorhombic (ICSD 97851) perovskite structures shown at the top, middle and bottom of the figure, respectively. Obviously, the crystal structure of CsPbBr3 changed with the increase in temperature from room temperature (300 K) to a high temperature (500 K). Splitting of the strong diffraction peaks disappeared gradually with the temperature increase. The weak diffraction peaks at 24.165°, 25.347°, and 28.587° (the featured peaks of the low temperature phase) also disappeared gradually with the temperature increase. These phenomena can be observed more clearly in the zoomed-in image of the XRD pattern, which is shown in the ESI† (Section 1.3 and Fig. S5). These phenomena indicated that the phase transitions of CsPbBr3 occurred with temperature rise and the phase transition temperatures were around 360 K (87 °C) and 400 K (127 °C). According to ref. 7, CsPbBr3 had two successive phase transitions at 88 °C and 130 °C, corresponding to the crystal structure transforming from room temperature orthorhombic (Pbnm, equal to Pnma) to tetragonal (P4/mbm) and then to cubic (Pmm), respectively. The temperature-dependent XRD patterns of this work were similar to those reported in ref. 7. The orthorhombic phase (Pbnm) had a typical characteristic of splitting diffraction peaks at 15.198° and 30.663° relative to the cubic phase (Pmm).3

3.2 General appearance of CsPbBr3 single crystal
An as-grown CsPbBr3 crystal with a 60 mm overall length was obtained from the EDG method. The conical part of the crystal ingot was about 30 mm in length as shaped by the ampule, and it was irregular with a gradually varied diameter. The isometric part, with a diameter of 8 mm and an approximate length of 30 mm, was sliced into wafers to investigate the phase and the quality of the crystal. The fabrication of the wafers is described in the ESI† (Section 1.4). Fig. S6† presents a photograph of the isometric part of the crystal ingot. Fig. 3 shows a photograph of a typical wafer 8 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness. Obviously, the wafer had an orange-yellow color, a good transparency and a bright, shiny and mirror-like surface.

3.3 X-ray diffraction and rocking curve analysis

Fig. 4 presents the XRD pattern of a CsPbBr3 wafer, with the standard pattern of the orthorhombic structure (ICSD 97851) provided at the bottom. It can be seen that the intensity of the (110) peak was quite strong, indicating that the crystal was a perfect single crystal preferentially orienting in the (110) direction. The secondary diffraction peak of the (220) plane suggested crystalline perfection. The clear splitting of the (110) and (220) peaks indicated that the grown CsPbBr3 crystal was of the room-temperature orthorhombic phase.3

To further study the crystalline quality of the crystal, the X-ray rocking curve of the (110) plane was measured, as inserted in Fig. 4. Evidently, the curve has a primarily symmetric single peak without any split peaks, which meant that there was no twinning in the crystal. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peak of the rocking curve was 0.16°. The relatively small FWHM of the crystal indicated a low dislocation density and small residual stress in the crystal.
3.4 Electron diffraction analysis
Considering the detection limit of XRD measurements (concentration >5%),33 the purity of the orthorhombic phase was still in doubt. Then high resolution TEM (HRTEM) technology was used to analyze the micro-structure of the crystal. A typical HRTEM image of the CsPbBr3 single crystal observed at room temperature is shown in Fig. 5. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) image of the HRTEM image is shown in the inset of Fig. 5. The well-regulated arrayed spots indicated that the grown crystal had a perfect quality without twinning, dislocation and stacking fault. The interplanar distances of the orthogonal directions in the HRTEM image were 0.582 nm and 0.586 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, the interplanar distances of the orthogonal directions in the FFT image were calculated to be 0.58 nm and 0.595 nm, respectively. As the diffraction spots in the FFT image were of low resolution, it is hard to distinguish the cubic phase from the orthorhombic one. Therefore, more clear and detailed diffraction spots are needed.

A selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image of the CsPbBr3 single crystal is shown in Fig. 6. Two reciprocal lattice primitive vectors in the SAED image, with lengths of 1.72 nm−1 (0.581 nm in the direct lattice) and 1.70 nm−1 (0.588 nm in the direct lattice), were rectangular. The other two reciprocal lattice vectors, with lengths of 1.92 nm−1 (0.52 nm in the direct lattice) and 3.85 nm−1 (0.26 nm in the direct lattice) were measured from weak (111) and (222) spots (marked with blue circles), which were unique for the orthorhombic (ICSD 97851) phase and were missing in the cubic (ICSD 29073) and tetragonal (ICSD 109295) phases. The weak and unique spots help to distinguish the orthorhombic from the cubic phase.34,35

Therefore the HRTEM and SAED image analyses revealed that the CsPbBr3 single crystal had a structure that matches with the orthorhombic crystal phase (ICSD 97851, Pbnm (62), a = 8.207 Å, b = 8.255 Å, c = 11.759 Å), which was also reported by Zhang et al.36 for CsPbBr3 nanowires,31 and by Abhishek Swarnkar et al.37 and Cottingham et al.38 for CsPbBr3 nanocuboids. The crystal was along the [10] zone axis and the (002), (112), (111) and (110) spots were in the same plane (see Fig. 6(a)). The vector angles among the (002), (112), (111) and (110) diffraction spots were 45.3°, 18.4° and 26.3°, respectively, as marked in Fig. S7.†Fig. 6(b) shows the standard reciprocal lattice patterns of the orthorhombic (ICSD 97851) and cubic (ICSD 29073) CsPbBr3 phases, respectively.
In order to identify the crystallographic orientations and domains of the crystal, the micro-structure crystallographic characterization was further analyzed by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD).39,40 EBSD is a SEM-based micro-structural crystallographic characterization technique that is well established to determine the crystallographic orientations, texture, defects, grain morphology and deformation of micro-structures. In this technique, the focused electron beam strikes the surface of the crystal at a high angle (here, 70°). Backscatter diffraction electrons scattered from the surface form a diffraction pattern called the Kikuchi pattern because of its prominent Kikuchi bands. Before the EBSD measurement, wafer surfaces were etched by argon ions for 30 min to smooth and clean the wafer. Fig. 7 shows the surface topography and micro-structural crystallographic orientation of a CsPbBr3 crystal wafer. As shown in Fig. 7(a), an area of 900 × 900 μm2 on the CsPbBr3 wafer surface was selected for EBSD pattern measurement. The corresponding EBSD patterns (Kikuchi patterns) are shown in Fig. 7(b). Remarkably, these patterns are similar, indicating the same crystallographic orientation and no grain boundaries within the crystal. Fig. 7(c) shows the crystallographic orientation map with the standard colour orientation reference system inserted. The crystallographic orientation map was formed by means of the number of Kikuchi patterns through statistical analysis. A specific color represented a specific orientation. Clearly, the map shows nearly the same color, indicating the crystal had a single orientation. This single orientation was confirmed by the inverse pole figure (IPF) map, as shown in Fig. 7(d). The concentrated point in the inverse pole figure (IPF) indicated that the crystal was a perfect single oriented crystal. More information about the characterization of the EBSD patterns on various regions from the edge to the center of the wafer is described in the ESI† (Fig. S8 and S9).

3.5 Optical characterization
The IR and UV-vis-NIR transmittance spectra of the wafer are shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), respectively. A high IR transmittance of over 55% in the whole spectrum region was observed. Since the IR average transmittance was mainly affected by point defects, vacancies and impurities in the crystal, a high IR average transmittance meant a low defect density in the crystal.41,42 Two absorption peaks were found clearly at about 1600 cm−1 and 3500 cm−1 in the transmittance spectrum, and they were regarded as the infrared absorption peaks of water vibrational modes in the atmosphere.43,44 The wafer also showed high transmittance in the UV-vis-NIR region, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The good optical performance indicated that the crystal had high purity and good crystal quality. Furthermore, the absorption edge of the wafer was found to be at 550 nm in the UV-vis-NIR transmittance spectrum.7,10,45 The band gap of the crystal was calculated to be approximately 2.252 eV according to the equation:  where λe is the absorption edge wavelength. The result was in line with the data reported in ref. 7.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, CsPbBr3 polycrystalline powders were synthesized by a chemical co-precipitation method. A CsPbBr3 single crystal of 8 mm diameter and 60 mm overall length was successfully grown by a facile melt method (EDG method). The phase transitions and micro-structure were systematically investigated using scientific instruments and equipment. The temperature-dependent powder XRD patterns indicated that CsPbBr3 had two successive phase transitions at around 88 °C and 130 °C, corresponding to the crystal structure transforming from room temperature orthorhombic (62, Pbnm, equal to Pnma) to tetragonal (99, P4/mbm) and then to cubic (221, Pmm), respectively. The XRD patterns showed that the crystal was a single crystal preferentially orienting in the (110) direction. The X-ray rocking curve of the (110) plane showed a sharp peak with a FWHM of 0.16°, indicating a low dislocation density and residual stress in the crystal. The HRTEM image showed the high quality of the crystal without twinning, dislocation and stacking fault. The FFT and SAED images indicated that the crystal exhibited the pure room-temperature orthorhombic phase. The results of EBSD confirmed that the CsPbBr3 crystal was a perfect single crystal along a single orientation with no grain boundaries. The crystal showed good transparency with high IR and UV-vis-NIR transmittance. The above results proved that the EDG method was a feasible and effective method to grow perfect CsPbBr3 single crystals.
