    , Accepted 9th August 2021First published on 2nd September 2021AbstractA zirconium-based metal–organic framework containing boron (UiO-66-B) is prepared, which displays efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. The H2O2 evolution rate is about 1002 μmol g−1 h−1, much higher than that of most known photocatalysts. Pristine UiO-66 displays a much lower activity (314 μmol g−1 h−1) under the same conditions, suggesting the significant role of boron. Both theoretical calculations and the combined experimental results verify the above conclusion, and the role of boron is ascribed to the following aspects: (1) enhanced O2 adsorption, (2) highly selective proton-coupled two-electron transfer, (3) faster carrier separation and surface charge transfer, and (4) faster generation but slower decomposition rates of H2O2. This work highlights key factors in the two-electron O2 reduction reaction (ORR), presents a deeper understanding of the role of boron in enhancing H2O2 production, and provides a new strategy for designing photocatalysts with excellent H2O2 evolution efficiency.

New concepts
In recent years, there have been many related studies on the preparation of H2O2 by photocatalytic O2 reduction, and it has been proven that the O2 reduction reaction is a two-step electron transfer process with a superoxide radical (˙O2−) as the intermediate product. However, the efficiency of H2O2 formation is very low, mainly due to the insufficient ability of the photocatalyst to adsorb and activate O2, and the low selectivity of the proton coupled two-electron transfer process. Our new concept here is based on the excellent gas adsorption capacity of metal–organic framework (MOF) materials, and the higher H2O2 selectivity of boron-containing materials. Therefore, we investigate a boron-containing zirconium-based MOF (UiO-66-B) with UiO-66 topology. Theoretical calculations and experimental results prove that the introduction of boron significantly enhances the adsorption capacity of O2 and promotes the proton coupled two-electron transfer process. This study provides a new strategy for designing photocatalysts with excellent H2O2 precipitation efficiency.

Introduction
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), acting as both an oxidant and a reductant, is an important clean chemical resource, which is widely used in organic synthesis, disinfection, food industry processes, water treatment, pulp bleaching, and other fields.1–4 Furthermore, H2O2 is also a promising substitute for hydrogen energy (H2) in fuel cell energy carriers, because it is more convenient and safe to store and transport than H2 due to its water solubility.5–7 At present, the anthraquinone method is widely adopted to produce H2O2 in industry, which displays several non-green features, such as high energy consumption, complicated industrial routes, and substantial amounts of toxic by-products.8–10 Compared with the anthraquinone process, photocatalytic H2O2 production, powered by solar energy, is considered the most promising approach, as this technology is more energy efficient, clean and simple.
In fact, a lot of related studies have been published on the preparation of H2O2 by photocatalytic O2 reduction recently. This O2 reduction reaction (ORR) has been proven to involve a sequential two-step electron transfer process with a superoxide radical (˙O2−) as the intermediate product (first step: O2 + e− → ˙O2−; second step: ˙O2− + 2H+ + e− → H2O2).11–13 However, the efficiency of H2O2 evolution is very low. The reasons are attributed to the following: (1) inability of a photocatalyst to efficiently adsorb O2, which is a necessary step for the following electron transfer; (2) the formation of H2O2 is limited by the second group, namely the proton-coupled electron transfer process.14,15 Therefore, the construction of catalysts, which not only improve the adsorption capacity of O2, but also facilitate the proton coupled electron transfer process, is significant.
To improve the O2 adsorption, increasing the surface area has been proven to be an efficient approach. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), composed of inorganic metal dots and organic ligands, are a series of porous materials, which are widely utilized in gas adsorption and separation due to their large specific surface area.16–18 Besides, they are also used in photocatalytic reactions due to their semiconducting behavior, such as H2 production,19 organic transformation20 and other fields.21,22 Therefore, MOFs hold great advantages for O2 adsorption and the following photocatalytic reduction reactions.
To improve the proton-coupled two-electron transfer process, besides noble metal deposition, atomic doping has also been proven to be an effective method.23,24 For example, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes, sulfur-doped carbon nitride, and phosphor-doped graphene has been proven to enhance the generation of H2O2via the ORR process.25–27 Recently, boron doping has been actively investigated to improve the efficiency of H2O2 generation. The unique electronic structure of boron endows boron containing materials with efficient photocatalytic activity towards H2O2 generation.28,29 Nevertheless, boron doping was only reported to improve O2 adsorption,30 and more specific roles of boron in the promoting effect are less understood. Therefore, a systematic study is needed to deepen the understanding and further improve the efficiency and ultimately realize practical application.
Hence, based on the structural and functional tunability of MOFs, 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid (CPBA) is chosen as the boron-containing organic ligand to replace p-phthalic acid (PTA) in the typical zirconium-based MOF (UiO-66). The obtained boron-containing MOF (UiO-66-B) displays enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production as expected. The H2O2 evolution rate over UiO-66-B (314 μmol L−1 h−1) is 3.2 times that over pristine UiO-66 (98 μmol L−1 h−1). Both theoretical calculations and experimental results verify that the introduction of boron plays an important role in improving H2O2 production via the following aspects: (1) enhanced O2 adsorption, (2) highly selective proton-coupled two-electron transfer, (3) faster carrier separation and surface charge transfer, and (4) faster generation but slower decomposition rates of H2O2. This work provides a new strategy for designing photocatalysts with excellent H2O2 evolution efficiency.
Results and discussion
To investigate the influence of boron doping on the ORR process, we first calculated the adsorption site and adsorption energy of O2 on UiO-66 and UiO-66-B. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the optimized structural model of UiO-66 and UiO-66-B after O2 adsorption. It can be seen that O2 adsorbs on the carbon site of the benzene ring for UiO-66, while for UiO-66-B, O2 is located at the boron site. According to the corresponding analysis of electron density distribution (Fig. 1a and b), the introduction of boron effectively utilizes the delocalized π electrons in the benzene ring, turning the electron-deficient boron into an electron-donating site, which makes UiO-66-B more conducive to the activation of O2. This result is further verified by the calculated adsorption energy. The adsorption energy of O2 on UiO-66-B is −0.81 eV, which is much higher than that on UiO-66 (−0.24 eV). The stronger O2 adsorption capacity of UiO-66-B is conducive to the accumulation of O2 on its surface and the generation of more superoxide radicals (˙O2−).29,30

Moreover, considering that H+ binding is a necessary step for the conversion of ˙O2− to H2O2, the amount and site of H+ adsorption on the catalyst are also important. Therefore, we further calculated the adsorption site and adsorption energy of H+ on UiO-66 and UiO-66-B, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. Apparently, the adsorption site of H+ on UiO-66 and UiO-66-B are the same, namely the oxygen of the Zr–O bond. The adsorption energy values are −0.41 eV and −0.49 eV, respectively, indicating that UiO-66-B is more conducive to H+ accumulation and consequently the conversion of ˙O2− to H2O2. Obviously, the adsorption sites of O2 and H+ on UiO-66-B are closer than those on UiO-66, which implies that UiO-66-B is more advantageous for the next proton coupling reaction from the point of view of geometry.
The theoretical calculation results suggest that UiO-66-B can significantly improve the adsorption of O2 and H+ compared with UiO-66, and the former may display improved photocatalytic performance towards H2O2 formation due to the presence of boron. Therefore, we prepared the boron-containing MOFs by replacing the original ligand PTA with boron containing CPBA to check the above conclusion. The chemical structures of the synthesized UiO-66 and UiO-66-B (the corresponding structures re shown in Fig. 2) were first characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. By the way, UiO-66-B-X with different molar percentages of CPBA in the place of PTA (denoted using X) were also prepared and investigated. As shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S2 (ESI†), the diffraction peaks of UiO-66 are consistent with those previously reported,31,32 and all the XRD peaks of UiO-66-B-X and UiO-66-B correspond well with those of UiO-66. The morphology and microstructure of the prepared samples were also observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). All the samples are octahedral and show no apparent difference in morphology and size. More detailed structural changes of UiO-66, UiO-66-B-X and UiO-66-B were further identified using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. As shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S5 (ESI†), the peaks at around 1390 and 1590 cm−1 for UiO-66-B and UiO-66-B-X are assigned to the B–O stretching vibrations of the borate group33–35 and the anti-symmetric stretching vibrations of the B–C bond,36 respectively. For the high-resolution of B 1s spectra (Fig. 3c), the two peaks with binding energies of 189.9 and 192.3 eV for UiO-66-B belong to the B–C and B–O species,37,38 and the intensity of the B 1s peak increases with the increase of CPBA linker in the samples (Fig. S6, ESI†). These results intuitively prove the successful introduction of CPBA into UiO-66-B. For the O 1s spectra (Fig. 3d), besides the oxygen in the C–O–Zr group for UiO-66,39 a new peak appears for UiO-66-B, which is attributed to the B–O–Zr lattice oxygen, again indicating the successful preparation of boron-containing UiO-66-B. Meanwhile, the B–O–Zr peak increases gradually with increasing CPBA content, indicating a gradual increase of boron content in the samples (Fig. S7, ESI†). As for the Zr 3d spectra (Fig. S8, ESI†), there are two peaks at 182.2 and 184.5 eV for all the samples corresponding to Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2, respectively.40 In addition, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution for UiO-66 and UiO-66-B calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherms do not change significantly (Table S1 and Fig. S9, S10, ESI†). Consequently, it is believed that the ligand replacement does not significantly influence the topological structure, crystallinity and pore structure etc.

The photocatalytic activity towards H2O2 production over the samples was evaluated under an O2-saturated isopropanol aqueous solution with simulated sunlight (AM 1.5) as the light source based on potential practical considerations. The light source was located at a distance of 20 cm from the reactor, and continuous magnetic stirring and cooled water (15 °C) were applied during the experiment. As shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S11 (ESI†), UiO-66 exhibits a H2O2 evolution rate of 314 μmol h−1 g−1, while the H2O2 yield over UiO-66-B-X and UiO-66-B is higher than that over pristine UiO-66. With increasing boron content, UiO-66-B exhibits a H2O2 evolution rate from 472 to 1002 μmol h−1 g−1. UiO-66-B shows the best photocatalytic activity, about 3.2 times that of UiO-66. Furthermore, since UiO-66 and UiO-66-B were tested using only simulated UV light, the photocatalytic performance under UV light (200–400 nm) irradiation was also tested. As shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the photocatalytic performance is significantly improved compared with that under simulated sunlight due to the increase of incident photons. Moreover, to check the effect of particle size on the activity, UiO-66-B of different sizes were prepared by changing the amount of modulator (benzoic acid),41 and the corresponding photocatalytic performance was tested (Fig. S13, ESI†). It was found that the H2O2 evolution rate gradually increases with decreasing particle size, which may be attributed to the exposure of more catalytically active sites.

Since H2O2 is easy to decompose, the final photostationary concentration of H2O2 (Fig. 4a) is a dynamic process of both formation and decomposition. Therefore, the rate constants of formation (Kf, μM min−1) and decomposition (Kd, min−1) of H2O2 over the samples were further evaluated via assuming the corresponding zero-order and first-order kinetics. The values of Kf and Kd are acquired by fitting the H2O2 production data in Fig. 4a and Fig. S11 (ESI†) to the formula: [H2O2] = (Kf/Kd){1 − exp(−Kd × t)},26,29 and the results are displayed in Fig. 4b (the details are shown in Fig. S14, ESI†). According to the analysis, the value of Kf gradually increases and that of Kd gradually decreases with increasing boron content. UiO-66-B exhibits the highest Kf and the lowest Kd, indicating that the introduction of boron not only enhances the production efficiency of H2O2 and but also stabilizes the formation of H2O2 under UV light irradiation (Fig. S15, ESI†). The comparison with other reported photocatalysts is displayed in terms of H2O2 evolution rate. As shown in Fig. 4c and Table S2 (ESI†), the UiO-66-B used in this work displays much better performance than most known photocatalysts, suggesting that the introduction of boron is an effective approach to improve H2O2 production. Considering that stability is a very important parameter, cycling experiments for UiO-66-B were performed and the results are shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). The H2O2 yield shows no significant decrease after three cycles, indicating the outstanding stability of UiO-66-B.
Furthermore, a control experiment was carried out to uncover the formation process of H2O2 (Fig. 4d). Under Ar-saturated conditions, the yield of H2O2 decreases significantly, which is about one fourth of that under O2 saturation, indicating that H2O2 is produced from O2. The H2O2 generation under Ar-saturated conditions is due to the dissolved O2 in the solution. In addition, when benzoquinone (BQ) as an ˙O2− scavenger is added, the generated H2O2 is almost negligible, suggesting that ˙O2− is an intermediate produced during the formation of H2O2. Moreover, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were obtained to further confirm the existence of ˙O2−. As shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†), UiO-66-B exhibits an enhanced DMPO-˙O2− signal compared to that of UiO-66, indicating the enhanced ˙O2− production capability of UiO-66-B. Besides that, the presence of ˙O2− was further observed when the Zr3+ signal was checked at 77 K. UiO-66 and UiO-66-B are ESR silent in the dark (Fig. S18, ESI†). However, after irradiation (2 min), two strong axial ESR signals appear (Fig. S19, ESI†), which are ascribed to the characteristic signals of paramagnetic Zr3+ (g = 1.96)42 and O2− radicals (g = 2.00).43–46 The existence of ˙O2− is due to the capture of photoexcited electrons by the O2 adsorbed on the samples, and the ˙O2− signal for UiO-66-B is obviously stronger than that for UiO-66, which suggests that UiO-66-B induces more ˙O2− than that of UiO-66 under the same conditions. There is no significant difference in the Zr3+ signal between UiO-66 and UiO-66-B, indicating that the presence of boron does not affect the saturation of the Zr3+–Zr4+ pair on the Zr–O groups.43 The above results indicate that the presence of boron enhances the ability of UiO-66-B to generate ˙O2−, which is advantageous for the following proton-coupling electron transfer process.
The average number of electrons (n) involved in the overall O2 reduction and the selectivity of H2O2 generation were further measured in terms of the reduction current of O2 (Id) and the oxidation current of the produced H2O2 (Ir) (Fig. S20, ESI†) to evaluate the properties of UiO-66-B in O2-saturated conditions.47,48 Based on the obtained current intensity, the average number (n) of electrons transferred over UiO-66 and UiO-66-B was calculated to be 2.80 and 2.18 (at −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively (Fig. 4e), indicating that UiO-66-B is more selective towards a two-electron transfer for H2O2 evolution. In addition, the calculated selectivity verifies the above conclusion (Fig. 4f). Compared with UiO-66 (60%), UiO-66-B (91%) displays a higher selectivity for H2O2 evolution.
O2 adsorption is the first and preliminary step for H2O2 formation. Therefore, in order to uncover why UiO-66-B displays superior performance, room temperature O2 adsorption and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were performed to investigate the adsorption capacity of UiO-66 and UiO-66-B for O2. As shown in Fig. 5a, the O2 adsorption capacity increases linearly with pressure, and the maximum O2 adsorption amount for UiO-66-B (27.6 cm3 g−1) is about 4.2 times that for UiO-66 (6.5 cm3 g−1) at P/P0 = 1. The TPD results (Fig. 5b) are consistent with the above results. The amount of O2 desorbed from UiO-66 and UiO-66-B is 6.49 mL g−1 and 27.55 mL g−1, respectively, which is nearly the same as the absorption results. The two tests strongly justify the conclusion obtained from the theoretical calculations that the O2 adsorption ability of UiO-66-B is superior compared to that of UiO-66. In addition, the O2 adsorption isotherms for the organic ligands (PTA (zero borons), CPBA (one boron) and 1,4-phenylenebisboronic acid (PEBA, two borons)) confirm that the presence of boron is advantageous for O2 adsorption (Fig. S21, ESI†).

The photocatalytic performance not only depends on the adsorption of target molecules, but is also closely related to the combined action of optical absorption (ηabs), charge carrier separation (ηsep), and surface charge transfer efficiency (ηtrans) of a photocatalyst. Therefore, these three aspects are analyzed in the following sections.
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were first obtained. As shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. S22 (ESI†), a gradual red shift in the absorption edge can be observed with increasing boron content. For the organic ligand, CPBA displays a broader absorption range than that of PTA (Fig. S23, ESI†). Therefore, the red shift for UiO-66-B is attributed to the introduction of CPBA. The corresponding band gaps of the samples were determined using the Kubelka–Munk function based on the DRS spectra, as shown in Fig. 6b and Fig. S24 (ESI†). The band gap (Eg) of the samples progressively narrowed from 3.70 to 3.40 eV, revealing the gradual enhancement of light absorption. In addition, the XPS valence band spectra were also obtained (Fig. 6c and Fig. S25, ESI†), and the results suggest that the valence band potential (EVB) for all the samples is located at about 2.80 eV, which is not affected by boron doping. Therefore, the conduction band potentials (ECB) can be determined to be −0.90, −0.84, −0.80, −0.76, −0.71, and −0.60 eV for UiO-66, UiO-66-B-20, UiO-66-B-40, UiO-66-B-60, UiO-66-B-80 and UiO-66-B, respectively, according to the equation Eg = EVB − ECB, and the band structure is shown in Fig. 6d and Fig. S26 (ESI†). Obviously, the introduction of boron displays limited effects on the light absorption and band structure, which cannot account for the obviously enhanced performance. Therefore, light absorption is not believed to be the main reason for the enhanced H2O2 production over UiO-66-B.

After light absorption, the charge carrier separation (ηsep) was investigated using photoelectrical and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. Fig. 7a shows a comparison of the transient photocurrent response for UiO-66 and UiO-66-B with on–off cycles under UV light illumination. Compared with UiO-66, UiO-66-B shows an enhanced photocurrent intensity, revealing a faster charge transfer ability for UiO-66-B. UiO-66-B (Fig. 7b) exhibits a smaller arc radius for the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots compared with that of UiO-66, suggesting that UiO-66-B possesses a smaller charge transfer resistance, and consequently a higher photoexcited carrier transfer and separation efficiency. Furthermore, the PL spectra for UiO-66 and UiO-66-B were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. As shown in Fig. S27 (ESI†), UiO-66 exhibits an intense PL signal due to the large charge recombination, while a dramatic reduction in the PL intensity is observed for UiO-66-B, which confirms that the introduction of boron effectively promotes the separation of photoexcited carriers. In addition, the PL wavelength is red shifted, which is also consistent with the narrowed band gap obtained from the DRS analysis.

(e) LSV curves of UiO-66 and UiO-66-B under UV irradiation in the presence of MVCl2. (f) Photocurrent density of UiO-66 and UiO-66-B without and with MVCl2. 
Time-resolved fluorescence decay curves under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were carried out to evaluate the charge carrier dynamics between UiO-66/UiO-66-B and O2 (Fig. 7c and d). The PL decay curves were fitted using a two-exponential function model, and the associated parameters are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). It is obvious that the lifetime for UiO-66-B is shorter than that for UiO-66, which indicates that the former displays a faster charge transfer efficiency both under Ar and O2 atmospheres. In addition, compared with the data under Ar, the lifetime under O2 is shorter for both UiO-66-B and UiO-66, suggesting a much faster electron transfer between the catalysts and O2. However, for UiO-66-B, the decay kinetics are accelerated by 3.9 times under an O2 atmosphere, which is higher than that for UiO-66 (2.3 times). The more obvious acceleration implies faster electron transfer from UiO-66-B to O2.
The carrier density results for UiO-66 and UiO-66-B verify the above conclusion that the presence of boron is beneficial for charge transfer, which was measured using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests in the presence of methylviologen dichloride (MVCl2). The carriers can transfer to the external circuit once the applied bias voltage reaches the quasi Fermi level since the over-potential can be regarded to be zero for the reduction of MV2+.29 As shown in Fig. 7e, the potential of UiO-66-B (−0.257 V vs. Ag/AgCl) is 0.064 V more positive than that of UiO-66 (−0.321 vs. Ag/AgCl). The 0.064 V increment 11.9 times higher in UiO-66-B compared to that in UiO-66, regarding carrier density (for details, please see the Experimental section).
Finally, the surface charge transfer efficiency (ηtrans) is analyzed. Herein, with MVCl2 as a fast electron scavenger, the ηtrans of UiO-66 and UiO-66-B was investigated using previously designed photocurrent response tests.49,50 As shown in Fig. 7f, UiO-66 and UiO-66-B exhibit photocurrent densities of 0.025 and 0.085 μA cm−2 in a normal electrolyte, which increase to 0.141 and 0.249 μA cm−2 in the presence of MV2+, respectively. Hence, the ηtrans for UiO-66 and UiO-66-B were calculated to be 17.7% and 34.1% (for details, please see the Experimental section), respectively, indicating that UiO-66-B exhibits a much higher surface charge transfer efficiency than that of UiO-66. Namely, the introduction of boron endows UiO-66-B with a faster injection efficiency for photoexcited carriers into the reaction system, which results in the enhanced photocatalytic performance.
From the above results, the reaction mechanism for photocatalytic H2O2 production over UiO-66 and UiO-66-B can be proposed (Fig. 8), which is a two-step electron reduction process (O2 → ˙O2− → H2O2). For UiO-66, the O2 adsorbed at the carbon site of the benzene ring is reduced by e− to produce ˙O2−. Then, the ˙O2− reacts with the H+ adsorbed at the oxygen site to form H2O2 with the assistance of another e−. However, for UiO-66-B, the O2 adsorption site is on boron. Compared with UiO-66, UiO-66-B displays two advantages: (1) π electrons from the benzene ring accumulate at the boron site and readily transfer to the adsorbed O2 molecules with boron as a bridge; and (2) the H+ is adsorbed on the oxygen adjacent to boron, which is more conducive to the proton coupling reaction of ˙O2− to H2O2 in the second step. Besides that, UiO-66-B displays a higher efficiency of carrier separation and surface charge transfer, as well as a higher selectivity for the two-electron ORR process, all of which are beneficial for photocatalytic H2O2 evolution.

Conclusion
To sum up, a new boron-containing MOF (UiO-66-B) with UiO-66 topology is successfully developed through the replacement of organic ligands. The introduction of boron leads to: (1) enhanced O2 adsorption, (2) highly selective proton-coupled two-electron transfer, (3) faster carrier separation and surface charge transfer, and (4) faster generation but slower decomposition rates of H2O2, all of which lead to significantly improved performance for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Specifically, the H2O2 generation rate is 3.2 times that over pristine UiO-66. This study systematically investigates the effect of boron on enhancing photocatalytic H2O2 generation, which provides an alternative approach to improve the activity and selectivity of MOF based catalysts.

New concepts
In recent years, there have been many related studies on the preparation of H2O2 by photocatalytic O2 reduction, and it has been proven that the O2 reduction reaction is a two-step electron transfer process with a superoxide radical (˙O2−) as the intermediate product. However, the efficiency of H2O2 formation is very low, mainly due to the insufficient ability of the photocatalyst to adsorb and activate O2, and the low selectivity of the proton coupled two-electron transfer process. Our new concept here is based on the excellent gas adsorption capacity of metal–organic framework (MOF) materials, and the higher H2O2 selectivity of boron-containing materials. Therefore, we investigate a boron-containing zirconium-based MOF (UiO-66-B) with UiO-66 topology. Theoretical calculations and experimental results prove that the introduction of boron significantly enhances the adsorption capacity of O2 and promotes the proton coupled two-electron transfer process. This study provides a new strategy for designing photocatalysts with excellent H2O2 precipitation efficiency.
