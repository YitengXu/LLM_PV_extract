    , Accepted 10th December 2019First published on 12th December 2019AbstractA full-spectrum solar cell exhibits potential as an effective strategy to enhance the absorption of incident solar light. To ensure the absorption capability of solar cells, trapping structures or plasmons have emerged as two main ways of utilizing the full spectrum of solar energy. First, recent progress in the full-spectrum solar cells based on NCs was reviewed from the aspects of trapping structures and plasmon design. Moreover, the effects of light trapping and surface plasmon resonance on light absorption and photoelectronic conversion were emphasized and discussed. Finally, the application prospect of their combination in the field of full-spectrum solar cells was examined. It was pointed out that the deep exploration of the physical mechanism of photoelectric conversion, controllable preparation of the interface and stability of composite structures will become the main directions of future research.
1. Introduction
With the rapid growth of global energy demand, the depletion of fossil fuel resources has prompted countries around the world to intensify their efforts to develop new clean energy. Solar energy has attracted close attention from researchers as the most promising clean energy. Thin-film solar cells have become the main subject of research and development due to their low cost and flexible fabrication processes. The working mechanism of a thin-film solar cell requires that the thickness of the optical active absorption layer must be greater than the incident depth of the photons to ensure that the photons are sufficiently absorbed. On the other hand, in order to ensure that the electron–hole pairs can reach the conductive layer before recombination, the thickness of the photoactive absorption layer must be less than the diffusion length of electrons and holes. The decreased thickness of the active layer greatly reduces the cost of thin-film solar cells, but it also creates the problem of light absorption. It is very difficult to fully absorb sunlight having a wavelength of several hundred nanometers. The structural characteristics of thin-film solar cells themselves cause their common contrast between photon absorption efficiency and charge transport. Therefore, ensuring high light absorption efficiency with good carrier extraction ability has become an urgent problem to be solved. The solution to the problem must start with improving the structure of thin-film solar cells. To address this key problem, researchers have carried out a series of studies on light absorption,1–10 structure design,11–18 carrier collection,19–30 and electrode design.31–40 Aiming at the phenomenon that the incident light is still not efficiently utilized,41–63 a series of device structures with light trapping patterns have been developed. However, the preparation of these patterns relies on lithography and nano-imprint technologies, which obviously do not benefit from the advantages of the low cost and solvable processing of devices. Therefore, a simpler strategy to improve light absorption must be found in the commercialization process of solar cells. In addition, for a single bandgap semiconductor material, excessive reduction in its bandgap will cause open circuit voltage loss, thus reducing the performance of solar cells. The energy band engineering multi-junction p–n junction design has been used to exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit, but a significant portion of solar energy cannot be utilized. Therefore, an effective method for full-spectrum utilization has been the focus. Wang et al. integrated plasmonic and electrocatalytic techniques into the fabrication of solar cells and the full spectrum utilization of solar light from the visible to near infrared (NIR) regions was achieved (Fig. 1).41 Moreover, the carrier lifetime, migration rate, and recombination of electrons and holes caused by defects also affect the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. When fabricating full-spectrum solar cells, it is necessary to consider both light absorption and carrier transport process. In this paper, the research progress of solar cells based on NCs was reviewed, from the main ways of utilizing the full spectrum of solar energy, such as optical trapping structure or SPR effect, to increasing optical absorption and enhancing interfacial photogenic charge transport.

2. Full-spectrum utilization
Currently, the main approach to full-spectrum usage is through material selection and structural optimization. Type II–VI semiconductors have direct band gaps (1.5–3.7 eV) corresponding to a spectrum range from infrared to ultraviolet. However, the binary sulfides (such as CdS) enhance light absorption only in a relatively narrow range and are unable to meet the requirements of capturing broad spectrum sunlight. In addition, the problem of high toxicity restricts their wide application. In contrast, multiple groups such as I–III–VI2 and I–IIIV–VI (I = Ag, Cu; II = Zn, Cd; III = In; IV = Sn; VI = S, Se, Te), with the advantages of low toxicity and continuous adjustable band gaps, have attracted the attention of a large number of researchers. These components can adjust the band gap within a great range, which gives them excellent, controllable optical and electrical properties. However, due to the existence of the forbidden bandwidth, photons with energies above and below the bandgap width cannot be used effectively for photovoltaic conversion, resulting in heat loss.
In respect to the heat loss of photogenerated carriers, the separation of photogenerated charges and transfer at the interface are also important factors affecting the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. In recent years, a great deal of work has attempted to effectively reduce both the band gap and defect state concentration through control of core–shell structure, selective ion exchange, interfacial gradient components, etc., which is conductive to the controllable preparation of high-quality NCs with complex components.64–82 However, there are few studies on the function orientation and regulation strategy for light absorption and charge transport performance. The existing methods rarely consider the position of band level, optical carrier separation and migration, avoiding radiation recombination, etc. It is very difficult to improve the PCE of solar cells simply by regulating the band gap. Therefore, the problems of light absorption and photoelectric conversion must be considered at the same time.
2.1. Trapping structure
At present, there are many methods for full-spectrum utilization applied to solar cells; the most widely used are the trapping structure and plasmon enhancement techniques. When introducing light trapping structures into a solar cell, light with a relatively small angle of incidence is dispersed in all directions by reflecting, refracting, and scattering, which reduces surface light reflection and increases light scattering, thereby increasing the length of the optical path. At present, random texture structures are usually adopted in the application of silicon solar cells. However, the random texture morphology treats light of any wavelength equally; it cannot control the propagation behavior of light nor focus on the weak absorption band of the solar cells, especially near-infrared long-wave light with a band-edge absorption region. In order to use incident light more effectively, researchers have explored some new light trapping materials and structures. Xuan et al. proposed a dislocation film composite structure based on the traditional TiO2/SiO2 anti-reflection film combined with silicon nano-pillars.83 Based on electromagnetic field theory, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was used to study the spectral reflection characteristics. By adjusting the characteristic parameters of the composite structure, a surface microstructure with wide spectral characteristics and anti-reflection was obtained.
Although the anti-reflection film can effectively reduce light reflection loss, it is effective only for light of a specific narrow wavelength range, so it is relatively limited. For thin film solar cells, the thickness of the absorption layer is only a few microns, so a conventional surface textured structure of several tens of micrometers is not feasible. Therefore, in constructing an excellent optical trapping structure to boost the utilization of sunlight in thin-film solar cells, surface nano-texture trapping structure has gradually become a research hotspot, including nano-particles, nano-rod arrays, nano-cones and so on. Tang et al. proposed a simple trapping strategy based on ZnO microspheres.84 The monodisperse ZnO microspheres with a diameter of about 100 nm were introduced into the electron transport layer to obtain the effect of light field redistribution inside the device (Fig. 2a). At the same time, to reduce the reflection loss of incident light on the surface of the substrate, they coated the multi-dispersed ZnO ball onto the substrate surface to obtain a broad spectrum anti-reflection effect (Fig. 2c and d). Application in specific devices shows that the organic solar cell based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM combined with ZnO microspheres achieves a PCE of 10.38% (Fig. 2b), obviously higher than the 9.05% of planar devices.

There are several main factors affecting the performance of thin-film solar cells, including the efficient absorption of sunlight, the fast separation of photogenic charge and the fast transmission of electrons. Existing nanocrystalline solar cells still have many technical problems that need to be solved in practical application. In particular, the controllability of the active layer material and the electrode interface significantly affects the PCE. It is desirable to search for micro-nano structures that utilize photoelectric transport to replace irregular arrangements.
Through structural design of the nano-array, the trapping effect of the resonance mode is formed and control of light absorption and emission angle is realized. In addition, the optical concentration inside solar cells can be improved by stimulating multiple resonance modes. These advantages have made solar cells based on nano-array structures become a research focus in recent years. The light management of nano-arrays is achieved by adjusting the geometric parameters of nanomaterials. Among these, the optical resonance mode in a nano-array strongly depends on the diameter of the nanomaterial. The resonance coupling effect of the period of the nano-array between adjacent nanomaterials can not only significantly enhance the absorption, but also effectively suppress the emission of nanometer axial dipole. Nath et al. proposed a nanotube array of CdS–CdTe p–n junction prepared by chemical deposition method (Fig. 3).11 Compared with the bulk film structure, the light absorption efficiency of the porous structure is more effective: coverage of less than 10% of the light absorption layer could produce the same photocurrent as the bulk film, and the light conversion efficiency was improved by 50%. The resonant light trapping absorption of the three-dimensional nanotube array structure was a key factor for the improvement of photocurrent and conversion efficiency.

Since nanoarrays are arranged neatly and vertically on the conductive substrate, the structure can effectively reduce both the grain boundary barrier between nano materials and the electron transport loss, as well as provide direct electron transport channels. At the same time, nanometer arrays in the solar cell had the significant effect of inhibiting carrier recombination, which was beneficial to the rapid migration of photogenic carriers, thus generating strong photovoltaic performance.19 However, perovskite materials have poor infiltration in the CdS array, resulting in less adsorption of perovskite materials in the gaps of nanocrystalline arrays.
In addition, a large number of gaps in the nanoarrays will become carrier recombination centers and affect the overall performance of the solar cell. Therefore, researchers focused on interface modification of the nanoarrays, such as the density and radial ratio of nanoarrays, etc., to improve the contact between perovskite and electron transport materials at the grain boundary, and increase the adsorption of the perovskite. In addition, the stability of the nanocrystalline array film also directly affects the lifetime of solar cells. Therefore, in-depth research on the influencing factors of the preparation process of nanocrystalline arrays, further optimization of controllable preparation methods of nanocrystalline array thin films, and improvement in the structural stability of NCs can enhance the photovoltaic properties of devices.
Improving the effective utilization of sunlight by nanocrystal arrays and suppressing the recombination of carriers are key factors to improve the PCE of solar cells. Yu et al. successfully prepared a unique ternary [ZnS–CdS–Cu2−xS] heteronanorods based on colloidal chemical conversion method, in which ZnS nanorods was embedded with multi-node sheath CdS–Cu2−xS.19 The prepared ternary sulfide heterogeneous nanorods could promote the solar energy conversion performance by expanding the solar absorption range and effective charge separation (Fig. 4). This excellent research works to promote understanding of full-spectrum utilization technology based on solar energy. However, the trapping structure is complicated and the preparation process is cumbersome.

It is expected that the PCE of the solar cell can be further optimized by adjusting certain parameters (e.g. density, diameter and length of the nanorod arrays, surface recombination rate and doping concentration) in the future. A reasonable combination of several different light trapping technologies can be used to prepare a light trapping structure with a composite functional coating that combines light trapping, low reflectivity, high absorption, and high conductivity.
2.2. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect
Surface plasmons focus or localize the energy of incident light into the nanoscale range far smaller than the wavelength scale; the energy density of light and the local electric field intensity are greatly enhanced to form so-called hot spots.85–87 Therefore, surface plasmons can significantly enhance the interaction between light and matter.88,89 By introducing nanoparticles into solar cells and using their surface plasmon characteristics to enhance photon absorption and accelerate carrier separation rate, the overall performance of solar cells can be improved.90,91
In general, plasmon structures can increase light absorption in three ways: nanoparticles trap free-propagating plane waves from the sun to a semiconductor, or act as a coupling semiconductor for the near-field of a sub-wavelength antenna plasmon, or surface plasmon polaritons propagate around the interface.92 According to the distance between the light absorbing layer and the nanoparticles, the mechanism of surface plasmon enhanced photovoltaic characteristics include two types, propagating surface plasmons (PSPs) and localized surface plasmons (LSPs).93 When the distance between them is larger and exceeds the range of the local field formed by surface plasmons, the electromagnetic field of the propagated surface plasmon decays exponentially along the normal direction on both sides of the interface of the two materials, which can confine the electromagnetic field in a spatial range far smaller than the wavelength, thereby breaking through the optical diffraction limit. After the parallel incident light is scattered by the surface plasmon, the light propagation direction is distributed at a certain angle, thereby effectively increasing the propagation path of light in the active layer and improving the absorption rate of light. When the distance is relatively small, the local field enhancement caused by surface plasmons and the scattering effect on light will work together, and increase the light absorption rate of solar cells. This mechanism mainly relies on the local field enhancement caused by the surface plasmon resonance and the larger cavity quality factor to increase the intensity of the light field near the nanoparticle and the effective propagation distance of light in solar cells to improve the probability, in which the energy of incident light is absorbed by the solar cell material.

2.2.1. Metal nanoparticles. 
Metal nanoparticles with SPR effect can be controlled to adjust their light absorption performance in the visible-near-infrared region by controlling the size, composition, morphology and other factors of the metal particles to expand the scope of light capture. Through design of new solar cell structures, metal nanoparticles have significant plasmon resonance effect.94–102 The light absorption and effective photoelectric conversion provide new opportunities for improving the full spectrum utilization efficiency of solar cells. SPR mainly improves the spectral utilization efficiency of solar energy through an extended absorption range, light scattering and plasmonic energy transport, which can promote electron–hole pair separation in semiconductors.
In recent years, the SPR effect of metal nanoparticles has been widely studied and developed in the field of photovoltaic cells. Skrabalak et al. systematically discussed the physical mechanism of the SPR effect of metal nanostructures enhancing the photoabsorption characteristics of solar cells.103 Au NCs have unique photochemical and photophysical properties and significant SPR characteristics; they exhibit a strong absorption band that cannot be observed in bulk phase materials in a wide band range from visible to near-infrared. In addition to physical and chemical properties similar to traditional semiconductor NCs (such as dimension-dependent physical and chemical properties), it is noteworthy that Au NCs have incomparable advantages in light absorption compared with other NCs materials.
The advantages of Au NCs are mainly reflected in the following aspects: (1) by adjusting their morphology, size and structure, Au NCs have a continuously adjustable absorption range: the spectral absorption peak of Au nanospheres is around 520 nm, while for Au nanorods, with the increase of the length to diameter ratio, the SPR absorption gradually red shifts and the absorption peak is continuously adjustable within 600–1300 nm, which makes it possible to extend the photoresponse of a composite system to the near-infrared region; (2) Au NCs are easy to modify on the surface and are able to effectively compound with semiconductors and other materials to form a stable composite coupling structure. The above properties of Au NCs can be utilized to realize interface structure design of composite structures and provide the electron transfer capability of the interface. A large number of experimental studies have shown that the optical response characteristics of metal nanoparticles are closely related to the shape, size, composition and environment of the particles (Fig. 5). Au nanoparticles have obvious SPR effect; the incident photons interact with free electrons on the surface of metal nanomaterials to generate surface plasmon excitons, which have a strong scattering effect on light, and enhance the absorption and utilization of light by solar cells. Lee et al. directly added Au nanoparticles to the hole transport layer to increase sunlight utilization.104 Yuan et al. added Au particles into a dense layer of planar heterojunction thin-film solar cell and the subsequent excited hot electron injection significantly improved the performance of solar cells.105 The isoionization effect of metal nanoparticles is highly surface-localized and the work mainly focuses on how to increase the optical path through the enhancement effect of surface local field and the scattering cross section.

In addition to the frequency and wave vector matching, excitation of PSPs is generally required to meet specific polarization conditions. In contrast, the LSP resonances are more easily excited. The resonant frequency of LSPs is strongly dependent on the dimension, shape and surrounding environment of nanoparticles. When the incident light frequency is close to the intrinsic frequency of collective electron oscillation, the electromagnetic field strength around the nanostructures is greatly enhanced, thus enhancing the interaction between light and matter on the nanoscale. Using these features of surface plasmons can help to control the light field and photoelectric conversion at the nanometer scale. The appearance of different shapes of metal nanostructures has broadened the surface plasmon resonance band from visible light to infrared; continuous adjustment of the surface plasmon resonance band can be realized by adjusting the shape and size.
In addition to material properties, the properties of surface plasmons are also closely related to the morphology and structure of material. For example, by adjusting the morphology and structure of nanoparticles, the absorption frequency and scattering frequency of surface plasmons can be selectively changed. By regulating the size of the metal nanoparticles, the corresponding optical properties can also be controlled. The quantum efficiency of photoelectric conversion can be improved by combining optical and electrical aspects. Reineck et al. deeply analyzed the relationship between the size effect and charge separation of Au nanoparticles during photovoltaic conversion and found that the charge separation process becomes more effective as the size of Au particles decreases.106 The smallest Au particles (5 nm) exhibited an internal quantum efficiency of up to 13.3% and the photocurrent generated by the Au nanoparticles increased linearly with the distribution of dense Au particles and incident light intensity (Fig. 6).

The properties of surface plasmons are closely related to materials, morphology and structure. The free electron concentration, mobility and inter-band/in-band transitions of carriers are three important factors affecting the surface plasmon characteristics. The resonance wavelength of surface plasmons can cover ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared and far-infrared spectral bands. Through the morphology and structural design of nanostructures, the surface plasmon characteristics can be effectively regulated. Chen et al. investigated energy transfer processes under different conditions (materials, morphologies, illumination conditions, device structures, etc.) and revealed the charge or energy transfer of metal–semiconductor interfaces with dielectric layers in different plasmon configurations.107 Combined with experimental and numerical simulation, it was found that in the TiO2–Al2O3–Au electrode system, SPR enhancement is mainly dominated by hot electron injection, rather than the traditionally considered near-field electromagnetic enhancement. In a series of designed composite photoelectrode structures of TiO2 nanotubes, the TiO2–Al2O3–Au electrode showed the best light response in both the UV and visible regions (Fig. 7).

In order to learn which channel is more likely and its possible contribution to the enhancement of photoactivity, the FDTD method was used to simulate the effect of incident light wavelength on the distribution of electric field in different electrodes (Fig. 7a1–c1). For all three samples with different nanostructures, significant electric field strength enhancement was observed near Au nanoparticles with a wavelength of 570 nm (Fig. 7a2–c2). Compared with the other two structures, the TiO2–Au–Al2O3 electrode showed a stronger localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) electric field and deeper penetration depth (Fig. 7d).
By constructing metal–semiconductor composite nanostructures, the local field enhancement effect caused by metal surface plasmons can improve the light absorption of adjacent semiconductor materials. Since field enhancement has a strong local effect, it can regulate the spatial distribution of photogenerated electron–hole pairs inside semiconductor materials and shorten the distance the charges diffuse to the surface, thereby suppressing recombination and improving the charge separation efficiency. Ma et al. prepared solar cells with ITO/ZnO/PbS-TBAI/PbS-EDT/Au structure in which dipyramidal Au nanoparticles and Au spheres coated by mesoporous silica layer were mixed (Fig. 8).108 Since the high refractive index of SiO2 can change the electromagnetic environment surrounding the bipyramidal Au nanoparticles and Au spheres, the surface plasma peaks of samples of different sizes were red-shifted to different degrees after coating with silica (Fig. 8). The resonance peaks of the two plasma gold nanoparticles in the near-infrared region and the visible region were complementary, so that the range of light response of the solar cell was significantly expanded. Due to the synergistic effect of the two Au nanoparticles, the PCE of the solar cell was significantly increased to 9.58%.

The tunable characteristics of MOFs in functional optoelectronic devices can be realized by combining metal ions and organic linkers that exist in a predetermined spatial direction of the MOF. Jiang et al. first integrated plasmon and up-conversion effects into MOF materials, reasonably designing and preparing a core–shell metal–organic framework composite with broad band light absorption from ultraviolet to near-infrared (UCNPs-Pt@MOF/Au) (Fig. 9), and realized broadband spectral response from UV to NIR.109 Due to the response to broad-spectrum sunlight, the composite exhibited relatively strong photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under ultraviolet, visible, and even near-infrared radiation. This MOF realized the spatial separation of Au and Pt nanoparticles, which gave the composites catalytic activity.

By adjusting the MOF shell thickness and Au content, the optimized composite material had good photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under simulated sunlight (280 μmol g−1 h−1). Moreover, it had good recycling performance under simulated sunlight irradiation.
It also integrated plasmon and up-conversion effects into MOF components, greatly expanding light absorption. Pt further promoted charge separation and achieved excellent photocatalysis for all three regions under full sunlight. Although precious metal nanomaterials have excellent SPR properties unmatched by other materials, there is still much room for development in terms of controllable structure, morphology and size. Controlling the morphology and size of the plasmon metal structures can achieve spectral control (wavelength, intensity, multi-mode resonance, etc.) and local field spatial distribution regulation. The expensive price limits their practical application and does not allow wide application in optoelectronic devices. Other non-metallic plasmon materials (Cu2−xS, Cu2−xSe, etc.) and their photoelectric applications have also attracted great attention.


2.2.2. Copper-based chalcogenides. 
Due to the number of valence states of copper and sulfur, copper vacancies are often contained in copper sulfide crystals. The vacancy density has been shown to be closely related to the optoelectronic properties.110–116 Compared with the noble metals, copper-based chalcogenide compounds have strong absorption peaks and significant SPR performance in the NIR region because of the vacancy of copper caused by a non-quantitative ratio. Kriegel et al. prepared Cu2−xTe and Cu2−xSe NCs with CdTe or CdSe as source materials by ion exchange method and achieved an adjustable absorption spectrum from visible light to near-infrared region by controlling their morphology.117 However, the toxicity of cadmium limits its application. In addition, although Cu2−xX (X = S, Se, Te) semiconductor NCs are relatively low in cost compared with noble metal materials, their PCE needs to be further improved. This is because the band matching mechanism used in the system needs to be further explored. Defects need to be reduced to take advantage of photo-generated carrier separation and migration and to avoid radiation recombination. In contrast, copper-based chalcogenides (CuS, Cu2−xS, Cu2−xTe, etc.) are ideal SPR materials because of the copper vacancies and low cost. Hu et al. prepared flower-shaped CuS NCs (Fig. 10a);118 these superstructures were actually constructed from crossed hexagonal NCs (Fig. 10b and c), showing obvious absorption enhancement characteristics in the NIR region (Fig. 10d). The same research group successfully synthesized hydrophilic Cu9S5 nanometer sheets through the combination of thermal decomposition and surface ligand exchange; LSPR effect was found due to the presence of Cu+ vacancies.119

By changing the size, morphology and structure of nanoparticles, the absorption frequency of surface plasmons can be selectively regulated and the local field of surface plasmons can be further enhanced. To further develop plasmon-related applications, the synthesis of copper-based NCs with controllable size and shape is of great significance for the in-depth study of photoelectric characteristics. Kriegel et al. prepared Cu2−xTe and Cu2−xSe NCs by ion exchange method using CdTe or CdSe as source material.120 While maintaining its original shape, Cu2−xTe (Fig. 11) with a well-defined morphology (spherical, rod-shaped, tetrapod) was obtained through cation exchange. The resulting Cu2−xTe had a distinct plasmon sub-band in the near-infrared and the absorption spectrum could be adjusted from the visible to the near-infrared region. This work provides a simple way to prepare copper telluride NCs with controllable shape and optical properties, and improves the understanding of the optical resonance properties of vacancy doped copper–sulfur NCs. There are still challenges in controlling composition, purity and critical reaction conditions of CuS NCs to explore broad application of near-infrared plasmon binary copper-based chalcogenide. Xie et al. prepared water-soluble CuS NCs at room temperature (Fig. 12f),121 using a different route than the previously reported one. CuS NCs were obtained by the reaction of copper precursors (CuCl2, Cu(NO3)2 and Cu(Ac)2) with sulfur precursors (Na2S, (NH4)2S) without high temperature, high pressure or inert gas.

The morphology and phase characteristics of CuS NCs are shown in Fig. 12a–c. The synthesized CuS NCs required no further ligand exchange and could be easily dispersed in water. CuS sheets synthesized at different reaction times showed a well-defined near-infrared LSPR absorbance centered at 1020 nm (Fig. 12d). When stimulated by laser (860 nm, 1.2 W cm−2), the water-soluble CuS NCs produced significant photothermal characteristics and the photothermal conversion efficiency was 20.3%, which was equivalent to the binary copper sulfide compounds previously reported. Combined with the good photothermal conductivity, photostability and synthetic scalability of CuS, this method provides a universal and economical synthesis scheme for other copper carbon compounds with photothermal application prospects. Although the cost of Cu2−xX (X = S, Se, Te) semiconductor NCs is lower than that of noble metal materials, its stability in practical application still needs to be improved. In the future, considerations in structural design, manufacturing processes, and material selection will be important research directions in the use of plasma structures to control optical modality in photovoltaic devices and improve the performance of solar cells.
Because sulfur and copper in copper sulfide are polyvalent elements and there are many vacancies in the crystal lattice, the energy band of copper sulfide can be changed through size adjustment, which affects the photoelectric performance of copper sulfide nanocrystals. Wu et al. presented flexible solar cells based on CdS nanorods and CuS nanocrystals, yielding a PCE exceeding 1.6% (Fig. 13).122 This opens an avenue of fabricating flexible solar cells based on NCs at low temperature. Future work will explore regulation of the properties of materials, nanostructures with controlled morphology and property, and ultimately increasing the PCE of solar cells.

The design of the trapping structure or the SPR effect has been investigated and great progress has been made in the utilization of the full spectrum of solar energy (Table 1). Although the active layer is the main body of the nanocrystalline solar cell, other sections (absorbing layer, interface of active layer) also affect the performance of solar cells. For example, the contact area and phase distribution of the interface have a direct influence on the generation and transport of photoelectric conversion. Therefore, the overall structure of a solar cell also has important influence on its final photoelectric performance.

With the development of both nanotechnology and preparation technology, a composite solar cell structure using metal plasmon resonance and NCs trapping structure will be adopted in the future to realize their synergy and complementary function. Through adjusting composition and crystal structure, the SPR effect in metal or copper chalcogenide NCs can be adjusted in the NIR region of the light spectrum. The physical mechanism of the collaborative enhancement of light absorption will be further studied. For example, the question of whether the new metal plasmon resonance and coupling structure of NCs superlattices contribute to the substantial improvement of the photoelectric conversion performance of solar cells is worth a thorough discussion.

3. Summary and outlook
At present, the research on full-spectrum utilization in thin- film solar cells focuses on revealing the properties and structural characteristics of materials, especially the spectral absorption characteristics of solar cells. However, the lack of deep analysis of the physical mechanism of photoelectric conversion based on the matching between different optical-electric-thermal modules limits the improvement of the utilization efficiency of full-spectrum solar cells. Therefore, it is of great scientific value to make use of the synergistic effect of composite nanostructure to study the photo-electrical conversion, the mechanism of minimizing heat loss from the perspective of the system and other coupling mechanisms of photovoltaic conversion, photonic radiation and conversion.
Methods to improve the optical absorption efficiency of semiconductor materials, inhibit the recombination and enhance the transport performance of the photocarriers are also important issues to improve the PCE of solar cells. The unique optical properties of surface plasmons provide a way to solve the above problems and improve the efficiency of photoelectric conversion. In addition, the energy loss of solar cell materials and the structure itself should be reduced as far as possible, and the aspects of material selection, structural design, and manufacturing process can be combined to enhance the trapping effect. With the continuous development of nanotechnology and microelectronics, emerging nanostructures and nanomaterials have injected new vitality into the research and development of solar cells, where it is expected that solar cells with high PCE can be available at low cost. In view of the unknown problems related to NCs composite structures, research in the field of plasmon-coupled multi-element NCs to synergistically enhance light absorption and carrier transport will be carried out, and it has important practical significance towards grasping the essential core of full-spectrum utilization as well as the development of high-efficiency and low-cost full spectrum solar cells.
