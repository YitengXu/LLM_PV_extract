    , Accepted 18th November 2013First published on 19th November 2013AbstractA detailed understanding of doping level, electron diffusion length and coefficient, as well as light capture and charge separation efficiencies in nanoporous Mo-doped BiVO4 (Mo:BiVO4) photoanodes is obtained using photoelectrochemical techniques. Efficient water oxidation is achieved by doping with 1.8% Mo, resulting in a several-fold enhancement in photooxidation rate versus non-doped BiVO4. Two techniques are used to study the effect of Mo doping on the electron transport: (1) an analysis of the front/back illumination ratio of incident photon-to-current efficiency and (2) intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy. These techniques show that Mo doping improves the diffusion coefficient four-fold and increases the diffusion length to ca. 300 nm (from 10 nm for the non-doped material), which is also the empirically-determined optimal Mo:BiVO4 film thickness for photoelectrolysis. These films are found to have a 90% charge separation efficiency and an 80% absorbed photon-to-current efficiency, excellent values for metal oxide photoabsorbers. Among the many oxygen evolution catalysts studied, surface modification with iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH), a simple earth abundant catalyst, dramatically enhances the water oxidation performance of Mo:BiVO4 to an integrated IPCE of 2.41 mA cm−2 and a photocurrent density of 2.77 mA cm−2 in neutral phosphate at 1.23 V vs. RHE.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach for both the conversion and storage of solar energy and will become commercially viable provided certain scientific challenges are overcome.1 The water oxidation half-reaction in particular has beguiled chemists the world over owing to the complex proton-coupled electron transfer reactions required for this process.2–4 Even with recent advances in earth abundant catalysts that lower the overpotential needed for this oxygen evolution reaction (OER),4–6 development of semiconductor photoanodes for converting solar photons to the renewable oxidizing equivalents required to drive these catalysts has lagged behind.
Of the many materials under investigation for this process, metal oxides have been studied intensely since Fujishima and Honda's seminal publication detailing the photolysis of water by TiO2.7–10 Metal oxide semiconductors are well-suited to the conversion of light energy to chemical energy in an aqueous environment owing to their generally stability, but almost all materials studied to date suffer from inadequate band structures (band gap, conduction and valence band energy levels, charge carrier mobilities, etc.).8,11
Recently, band structure calculations have shown that BiVO4 surmounts many of these problems. In contrast to many metal oxides having valence band (VB) positions near 3 eV (vs. RHE) due to their primarily O 2p character, the BiVO4 VB level is raised to 2.4 eV due to incorporation of Bi 6s orbital character in addition to the dominant O 2p states.8,11,12 This state mixing provides two important functions: (1) it shifts the VB closer to the vacuum level, lowering the band gap and minimizing the wasteful overpotential of most oxide VBs for water oxidation, and (2) it provides relatively light hole effective masses (on the order of the electron mass), which results in better hole conductivity when compared with other metal oxide photoabsorbers. It has been determined experimentally that BiVO4 is an n-type semiconductor with a direct band gap of 2.4 eV, thus utilizing the blue portion of the visible spectrum,13,14 and has a conduction band (CB) near 0.0 V vs. RHE,11,15 making it suitable for oxidizing water but not the production of H2. This limitation can be overcome by an additional potential in the form of an externally applied bias voltage,16 a tandem PV cell,17 or the more negative CB position of a tandem photocathode in a D4 cell configuration (dual absorber, 4 photons per H2).18,19
Owing to these unique properties provided by its band structure, BiVO4 has quickly become one of the best performing metal oxide light absorbers for water oxidation.10,14,17 Synthesis of BiVO4 thin films has been achieved via a number of routes, the most successful and simple of which include aqueous dip coating,20 electrochemical deposition,16 and metal–organic decomposition.21,22 However, poor water oxidation efficiencies have been observed for non-doped BiVO4 presumably owing to its poor charge transport properties.21,23 This issue has begun to be addressed via doping with Mo(VI), W(VI), and even phosphate species.14,17,24–27 Theoretical calculations have shown that Mo6+ and W6+ substitute at V5+ sites and enhance the n-type doping of BiVO4,28 and Mott–Schottky experiments confirm the increase in carrier density.25,29
Although there is little information on carrier diffusion lengths in either doped or non-doped BiVO4, nanostructured BiVO4 films have been investigated as a strategy to enhance performance,20,22,27,30,31 as this film geometry reduces the distance holes must travel to reach the interface with the electrolyte.8,32,33 However, several studies have identified electron transport, not hole transport, as a key limitation of BiVO4.14,21,34 Nanostructuring provides little benefit for the transport of electrons, which still must travel the thickness of the film to be collected at the back contact. This fact makes majority carrier diffusion length – and relatedly, film thickness – a critical yet poorly understood parameter. A detailed study on the effect of doping on the electron diffusion length will result in improved knowledge of the fundamental photophysics and, consequently, performance of BiVO4 photoanodes.
In this work, we undertake an examination of majority carrier diffusion length in BiVO4 photoanodes and relate this parameter to their water oxidation activity. Electrodes of varying thicknesses were synthesized using a simple aqueous dip coating method both with and without molybdenum as an n-type dopant. Charge separation efficiencies in these films were studied with sulfite – a commonly used sacrificial hole acceptor – and electron transport times were examined with intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy. The water oxidation activities of BiVO4 photoanodes were investigated by varying film thickness, Mo doping level, and different catalysts deposited on the film surface. Finally, the charge separation efficiency and light absorption of these nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 films were examined, which demonstrates that there are opportunities to extend the electron diffusion length further to obtain a fully optimized photoelectrode.
Experimental
Synthesis of BiVO4
Solutions for dip coating were composed of 0.93 g Bi2O3 (99.8%, Alfa), 1.05 g NH4VO3 (Lot # 032979, Alfa), and 6.6 mL concentrated HNO3 (68.8–70.0%, BDH Aristar) and were adjusted to 20 mL with deionized (DI) water, resulting in a transparent yellow solution containing 0.2 M Bi(NO3)3, 0.45 M VO2(NO3), ∼4 M HNO3, and 0.45 M NH4NO3. Triton X-100 (1 drop, Aldrich) was added immediately before dip coating for each 10 mL of solution to improve the whetting of the substrate and homogeneity of the final films. Prepared stock solutions are very stable over a period of several months as long as Triton X-100 is not present. In this case, the surfactant will slowly reduce a portion of the yellow VO2+ species to the blue VO2+ species, resulting in a green solution.
The molybdenum peroxo species for doping was prepared by dissolving 0.86 g Mo powder (APS 3–7 micron, 99.95%, Alfa Aesar) in 10 mL H2O2 (certified ACS, 30%, Fisher) with stirring.35 The reaction was exothermic, so a water bath was used to moderate the temperature increase, along with slow addition (over the course of 5 min) of the powder to the H2O2. The resulting solution was transparent yellow, and was diluted with DI water to 20 mL to give a 0.45 M solution with respect to Mo content. This Mo solution was added to the BiVO4 dip coating solution with a graduated microsyringe to achieve the desired doping percent versus V content (e.g., 250 μL Mo peroxo solution added to 20 mL BiVO4 dip coating solution gave 1.25% Mo versus added V content). Note, however, that since excess V is used (and excess V is later removed, vide infra), the final Mo/V content in the film is not the same as the initial Mo/V percentage in the precursor solution (e.g., 1.25% Mo versus added V content gives a final 1.8% Mo versus V content, vide infra).
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass electrodes (TEC 8, Pilkington), were prepared with a 2.5 × 1.0 cm2 area. Dip coating was performed by hand at different withdrawal rates, using a stopwatch to record withdrawal times. The film area was 1.8 × 1.0 cm2. Withdrawal rates were recorded in mm s−1 by dividing the 18 mm substrate length by the withdrawal time. Withdrawal times of 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26 s gave withdrawal rates of 4.5, 3, 1.8, 1.3, 1, 0.8, and 0.7 mm s−1, respectively. Faster rates gave thicker films.
Films were dried on a hot plate at 50 °C for 2 min, resulting in orange amorphous films composed of precipitated hydrated oxides and/or hydroxides of bismuth and vanadium (and in some cases molybdenum), along with ammonium and nitrate salts and trace Triton X-100. The samples were annealed to form crystalline BiVO4 (or Mo doped BiVO4) and remove all other components by decomposition to gaseous products. The annealing was performed in a tube furnace open to ambient air at 425 °C for 1 h, preceded by a 2 h ramp up and followed by natural cooling.
BiVO4 was prepared from precursor solutions containing excess vanadium to ensure that the stoichiometry of the final films would never be bismuth rich, because it is difficult to selectively remove excess Bi2O3. However, after annealing the vanadium rich films, any excess V2O5 was easily removed via a <5 min soak in 0.5 M KOH. Films were finally rinsed with DI water and dried under a stream of air.
FeOOH catalyst was photodeposited onto BiVO4 films at room temperature from 100 mL of 50 mM FeCl2·4H2O (98%, Alfa Aesar), which was measured to have an unadjusted pH of 4.2, with 300 rpm stirring of the solution. The photodeposition utilized a flat-faced glass cell with a 3-electrode configuration. 1.8 cm2 BiVO4 films were held for two min at 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode, with a Pt foil counter electrode (3 cm2) positioned approximately 1 cm away. Potential was applied and current measured by an EG&G Princeton Applied Research VersaStat II potentiostat. The FeCl2 solution remains light yellow and transparent with no visible precipitation throughout the photodeposition. During photodeposition, the entire BiVO4 film was front illuminated with a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Newport), adjusted with a GaP0.98N0.02 photodiode (Eg = 1.99 eV) to have an incident photon density identical to 1 sun at energies above its band gap. Photodeposition times shorter than two min resulted in lower water oxidation photocurrent density when compared with initial sulfite oxidation photocurrent density. Photodeposition times longer than two minutes resulted in no further enhancement.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Rigaku Ultima IV XRD, which employed Cu Kα radiation. Samples for XRD were made with a 4.5 mm s−1 withdrawal rate (750 nm thickness). Imaging of film morphology and thickness was performed using a JEOL JSM 7000F field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) operated at 5 kV and a working distance of 6 mm. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) also made use of the JOEL JSM 7000F FESEM, with a 15 kV accelerating voltage and a 10 mm working distance. Elemental ratios of Mo:Bi:V were determined by ICP-AES and ICP-MS by Huffman Labs in Golden, CO. Powders for ICP analysis were prepared from several identically-synthesized Mo:BiVO4 films scraped from their substrates to obtain at least 15 mg of sample. UV-vis data for Tauc plots were obtained using a Varian Cary 500 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Absorption coefficients for the electron diffusion length calculation were determined using absorbance data from a Cary 6000i UV-vis-NIR with an integrating sphere attachment and film thicknesses from cross-sectional SEM. Absorbance was calculated as: A = −log[(%T + %R)/100](1)
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photocurrent measurements were performed using the same instrumentation and cell setup described above for FeOOH photodeposition. When optimizing light absorption, charge separation, and transport, all solutions contained 0.1 M Na2SO3 (anhydrous, 98.2%, J.T. Baker), and 0.1 M NaH2PO4·H2O (≥99.0%, Sigma Aldrich), adjusted to pH 7 using NaOH. These concentrations were sufficient to obtain maximal photocurrent densities. For measurements of O2 evolution current in the absence of sulfite, it was necessary to increase the phosphate concentration to 1 M NaH2PO4 (still adjusted to pH 7 with NaOH) to obtain current that was not diffusion limited. In the case of I–V curves, data were first recorded in the dark and then under illumination at a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1 in the positive direction. Current densities were obtained by dividing the photocurrent by the 1.8 cm2 film area. All potentials are reported versus RHE for ease of comparison with literature and with the redox potentials of H+/H2 and O2/H2O. The conversion equation is: E(vs.RHE) = E(vs.Ag/AgCl) + 0.199 V + 0.0591 V × pH (at 25 °C)(2)
The double stack configuration used two front-facing electrodes epoxied together at the top (outside of the 1.8 cm2 active area) with a gap of about 2 mm between them. A 1.8 cm2 strip of aluminum tape (Shurtape, AF 075) was attached to the glass side of the rear electrode. It made no electrical connection to the cell, but simply acted as a back reflector.
Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) utilized light from a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Newport) passed through a monochromator (Acton Research Corporation, SpectraPro 150), and recorded current using a Princeton Applied Research VersaStat 4 potentiostat. A reference spectrum was measured as short circuit photocurrent by an NREL calibrated Si photodiode (Hamamatsu, A02 S1336-8BQB) at 10 nm intervals between 350 and 550 nm. The sequence at each wavelength was 3 s of dark and 3 s of illumination, and the current was collected at 10 points per s, with the final 10 points of each light and dark cycle averaged. The dark current was subtracted from the photocurrent to obtain a data point at each wavelength. The raw photocurrent at 470 nm was 9 μA. A “lamp current” (or photons s−1) was determined by dividing by the quantum efficiency of the photodiode at each wavelength. The photoelectrochemical cell setup was identical to that described above. The BiVO4 samples were held at 0.617 V vs. Ag/AgCl (1.23 V vs. RHE), and the same data collection procedure was followed as for the reference spectrum. The equation used to obtain the IPCE values was: IPCE = photocurrent/lamp current(3)
Electron transport was studied by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) as detailed previously.36 Solutions for IMPS studies contained 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M NaH2PO4·H2O, adjusted to pH 7 using NaOH. A flat-faced glass cell was used with a 2-electrode setup. A Pt mesh counter electrode was wrapped around the BiVO4 working electrode in order to maintain an identical illumination intensity and electrolyte resistance regardless of whether the films were illuminated from the film side (front illumination) or the FTO side (back illumination). The samples were probed with a small sinusoidally modulated beam of 455 nm LED light superimposed on a relatively large background illumination also at 455 nm. Neutral density filters were used to vary the illumination intensity. The amplitude of the modulated photocurrent density was kept at 10% or lower compared to the steady-state photocurrent density. A potential of 0.6 V was applied versus the Pt counter electrode using a current preamplifier (SR570, Stanford Research Systems). Charge transport time constant τ was calculated from the expression: τ = 1/2πf, where f is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMPS imaginary component in the complex plot. The diffusion coefficient D was determined by using D = d2/2.35τ,37 where d is the film thickness.
Results and discussion
BiVO4 films were synthesized on FTO electrodes via a simple dip coating procedure from nitric acid solutions containing Bi(NO3)3 and NH4VO3. The resulting orange amorphous films were composed of precipitated hydrated oxides and/or hydroxides of bismuth and vanadium along with ammonium and nitrate salts. They were annealed for one hour at 425 °C in air to produce yellow scheelite BiVO4. The precursor solution contained excess vanadium to ensure that every Bi atom was stoichiometrically incorporated into BiVO4, and so following annealing the excess vanadium oxide was removed with a KOH etch. XRD patterns for an annealed film and an annealed and KOH-treated film are shown in Fig. 1a and b. The peaks corresponding to vanadium oxide (VxOy) are not present following KOH treatment, with no changes to the BiVO4 or FTO peaks and no impurity phases in the final films. Compositional analyses verify removal of the majority of the excess vanadium from the annealed precursor films via the change in V:Bi ratio from the initial precursor ratio of 2.25:1.00, to a final 1.07:1.00 ratio after the KOH treatment (Fig. S1, ESI†). A Tauc plot confirms the expected direct band gap transition near 2.4 eV (Fig. S2, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of (a) as-prepared annealed BiVO4 film, (b) annealed and KOH treated BiVO4 film, and (c) annealed and KOH treated 1.8% Mo-doped BiVO4 film. The vertical lines correspond to the powder diffraction data for monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS # 00-014-0688). The other peaks are from the FTO substrate (●) and an unidentified VxOy phase (■) which is nearly completely removed with the KOH treatment. 
A molybdenum peroxo species35 was added to precursor solutions between 0 and 3 at% molybdenum (versus vanadium) to act as a dopant.24,25,28 Compositional analysis of the nominal 1.25% Mo sample (later shown to be the optimal doping) found an actual Mo incorporation of 1.8% versus vanadium (Fig. S1, ESI†). This increase in Mo content from precursor to final film simply reflects the fact that only 44% of the initial vanadium was incorporated into the Mo:BiVO4, whereas 64% of the Mo was incorporated. Thus, the higher incorporation rate of Mo compared with V results in a final Mo content (1.8%) that is 1.45 times higher than the 1.25% Mo contained in the initial precursor solution. XRD patterns exhibit no change of the BiVO4 phase with this level of Mo incorporation (Fig. 1c). SEM images of 1.8% Mo-doped BiVO4 show that as-deposited films are composed of a two-phase morphology, with small particles of faceted VxOy nearly completely removed upon soaking in KOH solution to reveal a porous BiVO4 network with feature sizes of ca. 75 nm (Fig. 2a and b).
 Fig. 2  SEM images of 1.8% Mo-doped BiVO4 films dipped at 1.3 mm s−1 (left column) and 4.5 mm s−1 (right column), showing the top view (a) after annealing and (b) after annealing and KOH treatment and (c) the cross-section after annealing and KOH treatment. The left column corresponds to 300 nm and the right column to 750 nm thick films. Scale bars are 250 nm. 
Cross-sectional images demonstrate that withdrawal rates of 4.5 and 1.3 mm s−1 give 750 and 300 nm thick films, respectively (Fig. 2c). As with the XRD results, the film morphology is unaffected by this doping level when compared with SEM images of non-doped BiVO4 (Fig. S3, ESI†).
Initial photocurrent experiments were performed under 1 sun illumination in 0.1 M NaH2PO4 at pH 7, with the addition of 0.1 M Na2SO3. Sulfite (SO32−) acts as an efficient hole scavenger, and allows the optimization of light capture and charge transport without the added concern of water oxidation kinetics, which can be very sluggish.16,24,38 These sulfite and phosphate concentrations were found to be sufficient to avoid mass transport limitations, as greater concentrations did not increase the photocurrent. As expected, the photocurrent indicated an n-type response at potentials positive of the flatband potential (above 0.0 V vs. RHE).12,14,25 For non-doped films dipped at 4.5 mm s−1 (750 nm thick), the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE was ca. 0.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3, leftmost data point). For this 750 nm film thickness, the photocurrent density increases upon doping to a maximum of 1.5 mA cm−2 for films with a nominal 1.25% Mo content (1.8% Mo via ICP following removal of excess VxOy), and decreases with additional doping. This threefold photocurrent enhancement is due to improved electron transport (vide infra) and begins to decrease with greater Mo content, because additional Mo decreases the diffusion length likely via the creation of recombination centers.
 Fig. 3  Plot of photocurrent density versus nominal Mo doping level (percent versus vanadium in precursor solution). Photocurrent performed on 4.5 mm s−1 dipped (750 nm thick) BiVO4 films in 0.1 M Na2SO3, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, pH 7 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 1 sun back illumination. Error bars display one standard deviation from the mean of four samples. 
Given the general rule that hole transport limits the optimum feature size and electron transport limits the optimum film thickness in nanoporous photoanodes, we were motivated to explore the impact of carrier diffusion in these films. Since hole diffusion lengths of doped BiVO4 have been shown to be on the order of 100–200 nm,21,27 hole transport should not be a limiting factor in our films with their 75 nm feature sizes (requiring hole diffusion lengths of ≤40 nm). To empirically determine the electron diffusion length for the optimal 1.8% Mo-doped films (hereafter called Mo:BiVO4), we probed the photocurrent density with both front and back illumination directions as a function of film thickness (as controlled by withdrawal rate, Fig. 4). Whereas photocurrent density under front illumination is much lower than back illumination for thick films, as films are made thinner (via a slower dip coating withdrawal rate), the photocurrent density for front illumination becomes larger than that for back illumination, increasing to a maximum of 3.0 mA cm−2 for 1.3 mm s−1 (300 nm thick) films (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Plot of photocurrent density of 1.8% Mo:BiVO4 films under back illumination () and front illumination () versus dip coating withdrawal rate. Photocurrent performed in 0.1 M Na2SO3, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, pH 7 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 1 sun illumination. Error bars display one standard deviation from the mean of four samples. 
These observations suggest that these nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 films are limited by electron transport, consistent with previous observations.21,23 Poor electron transport in the form of a short electron diffusion length also explains why a recent work, which produced elegantly nanostructured but thick (>1 μm) BiVO4 films, reported photocurrents limited to <1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE.30
From this empirical study, we conclude that the electron diffusion length in the nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 films prepared here is ∼300 nm. For films near this thickness, electron transport does not limit photocurrent density, and photogenerated charges can be collected efficiently from anywhere within the film. In this situation, illumination direction should have no effect, but it is apparent from the data in Fig. 4 that front illumination generates higher photocurrent densities (by ∼20%) than back illumination in films near this thickness (and all films thinner than 300 nm). This finding is easily explained by absorption losses from the FTO/glass substrate, which decreases the available photons in back illumination (Fig. S4, ESI†). In addition, photocurrent density of films <300 nm in thickness (both front and back illuminated) becomes steadily lower than the 300 nm sample due to the decreasing amount of light absorbed by each BiVO4 film.
An independent determination of electron diffusion length in these BiVO4 films was performed using the ratio of front/back IPCE values recently developed by Barnes and O'Regan and detailed in eqn (4),39 where α is the absorption coefficient (determined at a wavelength of 400 nm), L is the electron diffusion length in nm, and d is the film thickness in nm. This type of analysis has been performed in the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) literature to determine the electron diffusion length of TiO2.40,41 (4)

Eqn (4) was applied to IPCE data from 750 nm films for both BiVO4 and Mo:BiVO4 samples (400 nm wavelength points from Fig. S5, ESI†). The electron diffusion lengths were determined to be 305 nm for Mo:BiVO4 films and <10 nm for non-doped films, consistent with the ∼300 nm electron diffusion length found empirically for Mo:BiVO4. Molybdenum doping thus appears to lead to an order of magnitude enhancement of electron diffusion length compared with non-doped BiVO4.
Another powerful tool for studying charge transport is intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). This technique is commonly used to study electron transport in DSSCs and was utilized here to investigate the influence of Mo doping on the transport rate in BiVO4. For TiO2-based photoelectrodes in DSSCs, the transport rate usually displays a power-law dependence on the current density, which is often attributed to electrons undergoing multiple trapping and detrapping events with an exponential distribution of trap energy levels.42 In contrast, both BiVO4 and Mo:BiVO4 samples exhibit transport times that are nearly independent of light intensity (Fig. 5), suggesting that the transport-limiting traps are pinned at unique energy levels in these BiVO4 films.
 Fig. 5  IMPS data showing time constant versus photocurrent density of 300 nm samples of () non-doped BiVO4 and () Mo:BiVO4 front illuminated under various intensities of a 455 nm LED. Data collected using a 2-electrode cell with 0.1 M Na2SO3, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, pH 7 electrolyte at 0.6 V vs. Pt counter electrode. 
Consistent with the IPCE analysis, a significant decrease in time constant (i.e., faster transport) was observed upon doping 300 nm thick films with 1.8% Mo (Fig. 5), from which an electron diffusion coefficient in the doped films (1.5 × 10−7 cm2 s−1) was calculated (cf. 3.5 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 for non-doped films). Though IMPS cannot evaluate the number of traps, these results suggest that Mo doping introduces a shallow trap level below the conduction band that enhances electron transport, similar to the effect of a shallow proton level in nanoporous TiO2 films.43 This result is also consistent with the recent report of increased electronic transport upon 1% W doping of non-porous BiVO4 films.44 Experiments examining the time constants of back illuminated 300 nm vs. 750 nm thick Mo:BiVO4 films demonstrate a 2-fold smaller time constant (i.e., faster transport) for the 300 nm thick films, and the 750 nm thick Mo:BiVO4 films show a slightly larger time constant (i.e., slower transport) with front illumination, as expected (Fig. S6d, ESI†). These data provide the first quantitative measurements of the effect of Mo doping on the electron transport rate in nanoporous BiVO4 films.
The current–voltage curve of a 300 nm thick Mo:BiVO4 film in 0.1 M Na2SO3, 0.1 M NaH2PO4 at pH 7 under 1 sun front illumination shows an onset at ca. 0.25 V vs. RHE, slightly positive of the reported CB position (Fig. 6a).12,14,25 Notably, the electrode produces 3.13 mA cm−2 for the oxidation of sulfite at 1.23 V vs. RHE, a very high oxidation rate for a metal oxide photoanode.8,17,45–47 The same film with no sulfite present attains a significantly lower rate of photo-oxidation due to its poor catalytic activity for the OER (Fig. 6c). This kinetically slow performance of the native Mo:BiVO4 surface for the OER makes the addition of a catalyst crucial to increase the current density for the OER to the level of sulfite oxidation. Addition of surface catalysts has been shown to increase photocurrent by decreasing the overpotential of the OER and/or passivation of surface traps.21,23,48–50 Several catalysts have previously been paired with BiVO4, including Ag+ adsorbed to the surface via soaking in AgNO3,12 electro- and photodeposited cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi),17,21,22 photodeposited FeOOH16,31 and Pt,24 and carbonate.51 This latter catalyst appears to operate through a peroxocarbonate intermediate that is only accessible because of the very oxidizing potential (2.4 eV) of the BiVO4 VB.

Interestingly, IrOx and Co-Pi, both effective as dark catalysts on conductive electrodes, have been ineffective in certain cases as catalysts on BiVO4, possibly because of detrimental states at the BiVO4/catalyst interface.16,52 In fact, it has been noted that dark OER catalysts may not be acting as catalysts at all when placed on a photoelectrode.49,50 Instead, they may simply passivate surface defects, thus allowing photogenerated holes to persist longer and have a greater chance of participating in the kinetically slow OER before recombining. In either case, a beneficial surface catalyst will increase the current and thus the rate of oxygen production.
In this work, catalyst modification with Ag+, photodeposition of Pt, RuOx, MnOx, NiOx, and Co-Pi, precipitation of Ni0.9Fe0.1Ox, dispersion of NiFe2O4 nanocrystals, and operation in Cu-carbonate and carbonate solutions were screened for compatibility with the 300 nm Mo:BiVO4 films under varied catalyst loading conditions (see ESI†). Most modifications resulted in high levels of recombination as evidenced by large transient spikes and/or much lower steady-state photocurrent than with sulfite. Though each of these catalysts has demonstrated effective O2 evolution under certain conditions (in many cases as a dark electrocatalyst),4,6,12,24,51,53–58 here they all had a negative effect on the Mo:BiVO4 performance, presumably owing to interfacial recombination. These results illustrate the importance of the catalyst/semiconductor interface and demonstrate that in some cases a very efficient electrocatalyst can be ineffective when coupled with a semiconductor.
Like the other catalysts investigated, even thin layers of iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) should be capable of reaching 3 mA cm−2 under the excessive ∼1.2 V overpotential for water oxidation supplied by BiVO4. But distinct from the other catalysts, a thin layer (<5 nm) of FeOOH photodeposited from FeCl2 solution was the only catalyst that was found to enhance the photocurrent density for oxygen evolution to near (in this case, ca. 90% of the level) that achieved in the presence of the hole-scavenging sulfite (Fig. 7; for FeOOH details, see Experimental section and Fig. S7 through S10, ESI†). This result is notable given that several of the previously mentioned catalysts have been shown to outperform FeOOH as a dark catalyst with lower overpotentials and better Tafel slopes.4,57,59,60 FeOOH was also the only catalyst that tolerated various loadings with little difference in initial performance. The interface with the BiVO4 surface appears to be much more important to the photoelectrode performance than additional layers of FeOOH, which suggests that FeOOH may provide unique defect passivation for the surface of the nanoporous BiVO4 films developed here. These studies highlight the little understood role of the interface between the semiconductor oxide surface and the catalyst and beg further study in creating/suppressing interfacial states at BiVO4 surfaces.

Experiments performed under 1 sun front illumination in 1 M NaH2PO4 (pH 7) electrolyte at 1.23 V vs. RHE. 
Plot (i) in Fig. 7a shows a current–voltage curve of Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH for the OER in 1 M phosphate at pH 7. It reaches 2.77 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and produces vigorous O2 bubbles. IPCE was performed at 1.23 V vs. RHE in the same 1 M phosphate buffer (Fig. 7b) and displays a profile similar to the film absorption, exceeding 50% at wavelengths below 430 nm. No obvious enhancement in light harvesting could be attributed to the FeOOH (with an absorption onset near 600 nm, ref. 61), as the FeOOH layer is too thin to make an appreciable difference in the absorption profile of films with and without the catalyst (Fig. S9, ESI†). A control experiment of Mo:BiVO4 with no FeOOH in the 1 M phosphate solution reaches only 20% IPCE at 350 nm, illustrating the importance of the catalyst for maintaining a high rate of water oxidation (Fig. 7b).
Interestingly, in contrast to a recent work on compact (non-porous) BiVO4 films with Co-Pi catalyst that only required 0.1 M phosphate to support a photocurrent density of 1.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE,34 we observed that diffusion limitations occur at high photocurrent densities (>2 mA cm−2) with phosphate concentrations <1 M but can be alleviated by stirring or using a 1 M buffer concentration. We surmise that the nanoporous framework and higher current density in our system limits phosphate diffusion to the surface during water oxidation, likely resulting in a lower local pH that dissolves the FeOOH catalyst and causes the Nernst overpotential for water oxidation to be less favorable. The hypothesis that an inadequately buffered pH is causing these problems is supported by the observation that an electrolyte containing 0.1 M sulfite in 0.1 M phosphate shows no diffusion limitations and no improvement upon stirring, since the catalyst-free Mo:BiVO4 photoanode is less influenced by pH. The effect of buffer strength was differentiated from the effect of ionic strength by testing Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH in 0.1 M phosphate alone and then with the addition of 0.1 M Na2SO4. The solution with higher ionic strength but identical buffer strength gave no increase in photocurrent density (both tests gave 2.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE), suggesting that oxygen evolution performance is limited by buffer strength and not ionic strength in our 0.1 M phosphate condition.
Of note is that this 300 nm thick, nanoporous 1.8% Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH photoanode exhibits among the highest water oxidation activity of all previously reported BiVO4 electrodes when both IPCE and photocurrent are examined in concert.14,16,17,22,24,34,62,63 IPCE is the most reliable method when comparing performance between laboratories, which removes inconsistencies owing to lamp spectra and reference cell calibration.22,64 For instance, the reported 3.04 mA cm−2 for a WO3–BiVO4 composite film63 is greater than the 2.77 mA cm−2 current density for the Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 1 sun illumination reported here. However, the IPCE of the Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH reported here is markedly higher, with an integrated IPCE of 2.41 mA cm−2versus 1.99 mA cm−2 for WO3–BiVO4. These data underscore the importance of considering photocurrent densities derived from integrating IPCE data, and not just experimental photocurrent densities from broadband illumination, which can vary according to the solar simulator conditions used.
On the other hand, using only IPCE results to evaluate photoelectrode performance can also be misleading when experimental photocurrent density is not considered since photocurrent densities at individual wavelengths are very low with IPCE. Thus, systems that cannot support high photocurrents may still exhibit excellent IPCE spectra. For instance, by integrating across the solar spectrum using the IPCE spectra of BiVO4 photoanodes at 1.23 V vs. RHE in the reports of Abdi et al. and Pilli et al.,22,34 the 1 sun photocurrent densities corresponding to these benchmark IPCE values were found to be ca. 3.6 mA cm−2 in both cases.34,65 However, the photoelectrodes yield only 1.7 mA cm−2 and 1.8 mA cm−2, respectively, under 1 sun illumination at 1.23 V vs. RHE. As described by Abdi et al., their BiVO4 produces a much lower current density under 1 sun because of kinetic limitations at the electrode surface.34 The low photon flux of the monochromated illumination intrinsic to the IPCE technique allows this electrode to avoid the kinetic bottleneck that is observed under normal operating conditions, thus resulting in a high level of IPCE, which can overstate BiVO4 performance if not interpreted correctly.
Interestingly, the maximum attainable photocurrent density (Jmax in eqn (5)) for BiVO4 with 100% IPCE above its band gap is about 7.6 mA cm−2.65,66 Jwater = Jmax × IPCE(5)
The OER photocurrent (Jwater) of the 300 nm Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH films prepared here reaches 36% of this maximum IPCE at 1.23 V vs. RHE. However, these electrodes are very thin (owing to the short electron diffusion length as described above), and thus absorb only a fraction of the incoming light. When absorption of these films is taken into account, a 100% absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) would produce 3.45 mA cm−2 (Jabsorbed in eqn (6)) for 300 nm thick Mo:BiVO4. Jwater = Jabsorbed × APCE(6)
Thus, under 1 sun at 1.23 V vs. RHE, the Mo:BiVO4 films developed here utilize 80% of all absorbed photons for water oxidation (APCE in eqn (6)).
More detailed insight into the factors contributing to APCE can be gathered by examining this value as the product of the charge separation efficiency, Φsep, and the charge injection efficiency, Φinj21,67 as shown in eqn (7). APCE = Φsep × Φinj(7)
These values describe the fraction of charge carriers that overcome the two major loss mechanisms, bulk recombination (for Φsep) and surface recombination induced by slow reaction kinetics (for Φinj). Assuming that sulfite oxidation is kinetically fast enough to consume every hole reaching the surface, Φinj can then be calculated from the ratio between the photocurrent for water oxidation and the photocurrent for sulfite oxidation as shown in eqn (8). Φinj = Jwater/Jsulfite(8)
A plot of Φinjvs. potential is shown in Fig. 8a for the Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH electrode, which reaches 88% efficiency at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and for bare Mo:BiVO4, which reaches only 30% in Fig. 8b. This drastic difference in Φinj values illustrates the importance of an OER catalyst on the BiVO4 surface.

Experiments performed under 1 sun front illumination in pH 7 electrolyte (see main text for phosphate/sulfite concentrations). The plots are derived from the application of eqn (8) and (9) to the data in Fig. 6 and 7a. 
The charge separation efficiency, Φsep, can be calculated from the ratio between the photocurrent for sulfite oxidation and the photocurrent expected from the BiVO4 absorption spectrum (Jabsorbed = 3.45 mA cm−2 in this case) as shown in eqn (9). Φsep = Jsulfite/Jabsorbed(9)
The data show that the charge separation efficiency reaches 90% at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 8c). This separation efficiency is considerably higher than the 30% or 60% previously reported for BiVO417,21 or ca. 18% reported for hematite67 and emphasizes that metal oxide photoabsorbers have great promise in water oxidation systems.
Given the high APCE value of 80%, the primary limitation of Jwater is light absorption according to eqn (6). Fig. 9a shows the proportion of the solar spectrum that is absorbed by a 300 nm thick Mo:BiVO4 electrode, with a significant portion of photons near the absorption onset being transmitted. For purposes of illustration, two 300 nm thick Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH electrodes were stacked, and a reflective piece of Al tape was applied to the back electrode to increase the number of times weakly absorbed light traverses the films. The IPCE of each component individually and for the entire device is shown in Fig. 9b. The highest IPCE of the rear film is in the wavelength region near the band gap transition, as many of these low energy photons are weakly absorbed and are partially transmitted through the front film. The IPCE of the overall stack is higher than a single film at all wavelengths, reaching 60% at 440 nm, and remaining above this value into the UV.

(b) IPCE spectra of () the front electrode, () the rear electrode, and () both electrodes of a double stacked 300 nm Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH sample with aluminum rear reflector. IPCE collected at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 1 M phosphate at pH 7 under 1 sun front illumination. 
Current–voltage curves of a double stack and single electrode of Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH are compared in Fig. 10, which shows a 23% photocurrent increase (to 3.42 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) for the double stack structure due to the additional absorption of the second photoelectrode. This experiment effectively illustrates the significant potential of BiVO4 if the electron diffusion length can be increased beyond 300 nm to allow full absorption of all light above the 2.4 eV band gap. Such a development would allow for BiVO4 OER photocurrent densities exceeding 6 mA cm−2 if one considers the 7.6 mA cm−2 photocurrent possible from a 2.4 eV band gap material and the 90% charge separation efficiency found here.

Conclusions
The electron transport properties of nanoporous 1.8% Mo-doped BiVO4 (Mo:BiVO4) versus non-doped BiVO4 photoanodes were compared using an empirical thickness study, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). The electron diffusion length increases significantly (from ∼10 nm to ∼300 nm) upon doping by an analysis of the front/back illumination values of IPCE, and from IMPS data an electron diffusion coefficient in the doped films (1.5 × 10−7 cm2 s−1) was calculated (cf. 3.5 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 for non-doped films). These results agree with an empirically determined optimal film thickness of ∼300 nm for photoelectrolysis using Mo:BiVO4 films. These nanostructured photoanodes also achieve an excellent 90% charge separation efficiency and, following surface modification with FeOOH, an integrated IPCE of 2.41 mA cm−2 and photocurrent density of 2.77 mA cm−2 in neutral phosphate at 1.23 V vs. RHE. These results are extremely promising for overall solar water splitting using metal oxide photoanodes in low-cost tandem PEC systems, and more generally, this unique understanding and control of charge separation and electron transport provides a pathway for optimization of other metal oxide photoanodes for solar photoelectrolysis.
