    , Accepted 5th March 2012First published on 6th March 2012AbstractA convenient method for preparing highly crystalline Bi2S3 thin films by combining chemical bath deposition with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) is described. The surface morphology, structure and composition of the resultant Bi2S3 thin films were characterized by XPS, XRD and FESEM, respectively. The optical and photoelectrochemical properties of as-prepared Bi2S3 thin films with different reaction times were investigated by UV-vis absorption and photocurrent action spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that these properties were dependent on the film thickness which increased with the deposition time. According to the different deposition mechanisms on the NH2 and CH3 terminal groups, patterned Bi2S3 microarrays with different feature sizes (50, 130, 250 μm) were successfully deposited on –NH2-terminated SAMs regions of –NH2/–CH3 patterned SAMs surfaces. Clearly, with a decrease in feature size, the absorption intensity and photocurrent density of the patterned Bi2S3 thin film increased, which was due to the increased Bi2S3 surface area as well as the increased optical path length within the patterned Bi2S3 thin film, resulting from multiple reflection of incident light. The photocurrent density of the patterned thin film for the 50 μm-size feature exhibited an almost 9 times larger photocurrent density than a similar thin film without patterning. This work indicates that patterned Bi2S3 thin films are attractive systems for surface tailoring and also provide a novel approach to effectively control the photoelectrochemical properties of nanostructured Bi2S3 thin films with promising applications in microsystem devices for solar energy conversion.
Introduction
During the last few decades, there has been extensive research into nanostructured thin film semiconductor materials due to their wide potential applications in the fabrication of optical and electronic devices.1–3 Bismuth sulfide, Bi2S3, is V–VI semiconductor with a direct band gap of about 1.3 eV (bulk)4 and large absorption coefficient in the visible wavelength range.5 There are many applications for the thin film of this semiconductor, including solution-processed visible-wavelength photodetectors,6 photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar cells,7 thermoelectric cooling devices8 and electrochemical hydrogen storage.9 A variety of methods, such as spray pyrolysis,10 electrodeposition,11,12 thermal evaporation technique,13 metal–organic chemical vapor deposition14 and chemical bath deposition (CBD)15 have been employed to prepare Bi2S3 thin films. Among these methods, the CBD method is presently attracting considerable attention as it does not require sophisticated instrumentation like a vacuum system and other expensive equipment. Further, CBD can be easily adapted to large area processing. Although there have been many reports on Bi2S3 CBD, Bi2S3 thin films prepared from chemical bath deposition exhibit higher electrical resistivity (102–106 Ω cm−1) and lower photoconduction behavior in photovoltaic devices due to poor crystallization or containing some impurities.15,16 Moreover, the homogeneous nucleation reaction easily takes place in the plating solution due to the low solubility product of Bi2S3 (10−62),17 which makes it difficult to form high-quality thin films on the substrate. In the present work, we have achieved the preparation of Bi2S3 thin films of high-quality through chemical bath deposition (CBD) combined with SAMs which have highly organized, well-defined structures and have a uniform density of terminal-groups. The key of the technology is that the SAMs possessing functional groups can be employed to control nucleation.
In recent years, studies of surface patterned and miniaturization techniques have created the need for controlling surface properties as well as other potential properties.18 SAMs, as templates, can also be patterned using a variety of techniques to produce micro- and nanopatterned structures, including ultraviolet lithography,19 scanning probe lithographies,20 and microcontact printing.21 Micro- and nanopatterned SAMs have attracted increasing interest in electronic, photonic, and biological device fabrication due to demonstrations of selective metal and metal chalcogenide deposition and adsorption in only the desired areas.18,22,23 SAMs with varying functionalities have been successfully utilized to produce arrays of crystals, either as resists or as crystallization directing agents. Shirahata et al. have reported achieving the successful selective deposition of micropatterned tin oxide ultrathin films using patterned octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) SAMs as resists.24 Perhaps the most interesting way is to employ chemical reactions with specific SAM terminal groups to control the spatial position of functional materials for applications including molecular electronics,25 the production of microelectrodes and sensing.26,27 The key point of the success of the strategy is that the organic functional groups of the SAMs can promote and control crystal heterogeneous nucleation and selective growth. So far, there have been a large number of reports on the selective deposition of functional materials. For example, the selective electroless deposition of Cu,24 Au,28 TiO2,29 SrTiO3,29 CdS,23 CuS30 and ZnS31 have been achieved from a solution onto surfaces modified with organic SAMs.
Although there have already been a few studies about the selective deposition of inorganic crystals/films on SAMs, there are few reports on studying patterned Bi2S3 films as well as the effects of the patterning on the optical and photoelectrochemical properties. We describe a convenient, simple, inexpensive, and practical route for fabricating patterned Bi2S3 microarrays with different feature sizes (50, 130, and 250 μm) on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates using ultraviolet lithographed 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane SAMs as the functional organic thin layer template. The optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the as-prepared patterned Bi2S3 thin films with different feature sizes were investigated by UV-vis absorption and photocurrent action spectroscopy.
Experimental
Analytical-grade bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with purities better than 98% were purchased commercially and used as received. 3-Aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTS, 99%) and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS, 95%) were purchased from Aldrich. All the reagents were used without further purification. ITO glass (Grinm Semiconductor Materials Co. Ltd., China) was used as the substrate. Prior to film deposition, the substrates were ultrasonically cleaned by soaking in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, respectively, followed by thorough rinsing with deionized water and drying with dry nitrogen.
Bi2S3 chemical bath deposition and preparation of microarray patterns
The preparation of SAMs with –NH2 terminal groups used in this study has been described in detail previously.30 The plating solution employed consists of 15 mM Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (bismuth source), 15 mM Na2S2O3·5H2O (sulfur source) and 10 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) (complexing agent). The functionalized substrates were immersed in the prepared plating solution maintained at 60 °C using a thermostatically controlled water bath for a given time. The pH of the bath solution was adjusted to 1.8 by adding HNO3 solution (1 M). The substrates were placed vertically to the bottom of the beakers to avoid the effect of gravity. Then, the deposited films were rinsed in deionized water and ultrasonically washed to remove the leftover bismuth sulfide precipitates, and dried with nitrogen gas.

Fig. 1 presents a schematic of the fabrication processes of patterned SAMs similar to that reported in our previous work.30 In a typical experiment, the patterned SAMs were produced by irradiating the OTS–SAM surface through a Cu grid mask under UV light for approximately 1 h in air. UV-irradiation causes the formation of silanol regions in the exposed areas. Then, the patterned substrate with –CH3 terminal groups was immersed in a hexane solution of APTS for at least 3 h to assemble APTS on the silanol regions. Finally, the substrate was removed from the solution and ultrasonically washed with hexane for 3 min and dried with a highly pure nitrogen gas flow, resulting in a patterned –CH3/–NH2-terminated SAMs surface. Then, the substrate with patterned SAMs was immersed in the plating solution for the deposition of the Bi2S3 microarray patterns.

Characterization
The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were examined by a JSM-5600LV field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Japan) and an optical microscope (OM, China). The structure and the phase composition were analyzed by X'pert PRO X-ray diffraction (XRD, Netherlands) from 20 to 80° with Cu-Kα radiation at a scanning speed of 1.2° min−1. The chemical components of the elements on the films were determined using a PHI5702 multi-functional X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, USA). The XPS analysis was conducted at 400 W and a pass energy of 29.35 eV, using Al-Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation as the excitation source and the binding energy of contaminated carbon (C 1s = 284.6 eV) was used as a reference.
The optical absorption spectra were obtained with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (U-3010, Japan) within the wavelength range of 400–1000 nm. A computer controlled potentiostat (CHI 660d) was used for all PEC experiments. The PEC responses of the samples were measured in an electrochemical cell with a three-electrode system, in which the Bi2S3 thin film, a platinum wire and a saturation mercury electrode were used as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The illumination source was a xenon lamp, which produced an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at the plane of the sample. Photocurrent action spectra of the Bi2S3 photoelectrodes were studied at excitation wavelengths between 380 and 700 nm using a 150 W xenon lamp of the SM-25 Hyper Monolight (Japan) system. The electrolyte, an aqueous Na2SO3 (0.1 M) solution, was freshly prepared using double deionized water. Then, the electrolyte was put into an ultrasonic bath for 30 min before each experiment in order to decrease the gas solutes in the electrolyte.
Results and discussion
Bi2S3 thin films deposited on APTS SAMs
XPS was employed for the evaluation of the composition and purity of the obtained thin films. The typical wide-scan XPS spectrum of the as-prepared thin films growing on the APTS SAMs shown in Fig. 2a demonstrates that the only elements present are Bi, S, O and some traces of C. Weak C and O peaks should be ascribed to the physical adsorption of carbon and oxygen in the atmosphere. The binding energy of the C (1s) transition was used as a reference to standardize the binding energy of other elements. Two strong peaks at 158.5 and 163.8 eV in the high-resolution XPS spectrum (Fig. 2b) are assigned to Bi (4f7/2) and Bi (4f5/2), respectively. The peak at 163.5 eV corresponds to the S (2p) transition. It can be calculated that the S/Bi ratio is 1.5205, which is close to the stoichiometry of Bi2S3. Meanwhile, EDS measurements were performed on the Bi2S3 thin film, and the results showed a Bi:S ratio of 2.11(2):3.2(3), which is close to that found from the XPS data. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the Bi2S3 thin films for different deposition times. After the reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min, the diffraction peaks of the main phase were matched with the structure of ITO substrate, with no obvious Bi2S3 phase. However, after reacting for 1 h, apart from the strong peaks of the ITO glass, all of the peaks could be indexed as the orthorhombic lattice of Bi2S3 (JCPDS card 06-0333), indicating good crystallinity of the Bi2S3 with no impurities. Moreover, the peaks due to the Bi2S3 phase were enhanced in their relative intensity with an increase in reaction time. The crystallite size in the film was determined from the line (230) by using the Scherrer formula:d = λ/βcos θwhere λ is the wavelength used (1.54 Å), β is the angular line width at half maximum intensity in radians and θ is the Bragg angle. It was found that the crystallite size increases from 19 to 32 nm with the increase in film thickness. This significant improvement in crystallite size is due to the controlled slow release of bismuth ions from its complex [Bi(EDTA)]3+ in solution which increases the probability of growth of larger particles.

Fig. 4 displays the FESEM images of the Bi2S3 thin films which are prepared at 60 °C. After reacting for 60 min in the plating solution, Bi2S3 nanoparticles assembled into compact thin films on –NH2-terminated APTS SAMs and a uniform surface without any delamination or fracture was obtained (Fig. 4a). After reacting for 120 min, large nanocrystallites are observed on the surface (Fig. 4b). Both the size and the density of the larger crystallites increase with deposition time. When the reaction time was prolonged to 180 min, some aggregation of nanoparticles was observed on the densely packed surface (Fig. 4c). While on the ITO substrate without APTS SAMs, the Bi2S3 thin film prepared after 180 min was comprised of scattered clusters (Fig. 4d), which can be removed from the ITO substrate due to weak adherence. It was found if the substrate was not modified with APTS SAMs the Bi2S3 thin film would not be obtained at high quality. Liufu et al.17 reported that a Bi2S3 film on SAMs of (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane was obtained by CBD using Bi(NO3)3·5H2O as the Bi source and thiourea as both sulfide ion source and complexing agent at pH 0.47; they also found that the SAM was important for obtaining a compact Bi2S3 thin film. This result is consistent with the present study. The variation of film thickness with different deposition times is shown in Fig. 5. There is a continuous increase of film thickness with deposition time, while the growth rate decreases gradually. The maximum thickness of ∼200 nm was attained after a deposition period of 180 min. After 180 min, the thickness no longer increases obviously and declines if the deposition time is further extended. Such a phenomenon can be explained by considering the equilibrium of two competing processes taking place in the deposition solution: one process includes the heterogeneous and homogenous precipitation of Bi2S3, which leads to thin film growth; the other one involves the desorption and/or dissolution of the preformed Bi2S3 thin film, which leads to the decrease of film thickness.32

Nucleation and growth mechanism of Bi2S3 thin film on the functionalized APTS SAMs
The synthesis process of the Bi2S3 thin films is based on a slow release of Bi3+ and S2− ions. In the presence of EDTA, the metal Bi3+ forms the metal complex [Bi(NaEDTA)]3+, which controls the release of Bi3+ in the solution. Sulfide ions are generated in the bath from sodium thiosulfate, as shown below: 2S2O2−3 → S4O2−6 + 2e−(1) S2O2−3 + H+ → HSO−3 + S(2) S + 2e− (from reaction (1)) → S2−(3)Na2S2O3 is a reducing agent by virtue of the half cell reaction. In the acidic medium of pH = 1.8, sodium thiosulfate gradually releases sulfide ions upon hydrolytic decomposition. The newly formed S2− will react with Bi3+ released from the Bi-NaEDTA complex to produce Bi2S3 nuclei: 2[Bi(NaEDTA)n]3+ + 3S2− → Bi2S3 + 2nNaEDTA(4)
As we know there are –HS and –NH2 functional groups on the surface, which have a strong tendency to coordinate with inorganic cations and metals. In the supersaturated solution, the functionalized surface can reduce the nucleation barrier of bismuth sulfide and act a nucleation site due to its capacity to bind bismuth ions. The heterogeneous nucleation thus tends to take place at the interface between the substrate and the precursor solution. The microstructure of the Bi2S3 film depends on the film deposition process, which involves two aspects: the process of nucleus formation and the process of crystal growth. The ratio between the rates of these two processes (the process of nucleus formation and the process of crystal growth) is of fundamental importance for the microstructure of Bi2S3. Bi2S3 material has a lamellar structure composed of Bi2S3 bands elongating along the c-axis and is kept together through van der Waals interactions, which could cause anisotropic growth of this material by its strong tendency to grow along its c-axis.33 However, the supersaturation degree of the precursor solution is high for the acidic conditions, and thus the rate of nucleation increases exponentially. The rate of the crystal growth is expected to be significantly lower than that of the nucleation. The heterogeneous nucleation constantly takes place at the interface, and the as-formed sphere-like nanocrystals are in situ assembled into a highly compact film. The defects in the nanocrystals can be effectively stabilized by the numerous grain boundaries, which results in the good electrical conductivity (13.07 Ω □−1) of the specimen with a reaction time of 120 min.
Optical and photoelectrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the Bi2S3 thin films on the ITO with SAMs prepared with various reaction times are shown in Fig. 6. The Bi2S3 thin films show enhanced absorption in the visible range with prolonged deposition time. The absorption edge undergoes an obvious red shift with an increase in deposition time, which is similar to the previously reported increase in bandgap energy of CdS nanoparticles with decreasing particle size due to quantum size effects.34 From the plot of (αhυ)2versus hυ, the bandgaps of 1.6–1.9 eV for the Bi2S3 thin films, which were evaluated from the absorption spectrum by extrapolation of the plot of (αhυ)2versus hυ to the x-axis, were all higher than the reported value of 1.3 eV for bulk Bi2S3 (as shown in the inset of Fig. 6). The variation of the absorption edge mainly resulted from the increase of particle size, especially for Bi2S3 thin films with shorter reaction times.

The photoelectrochemical behavior of the ITO/Bi2S3 electrodes in term of stable short-circuit current (JSC) and open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) were recorded for the PEC cell (Fig. 7). Upon illumination of the Bi2S3 film with visible light, we observed a strong photocurrent response and prompt generation of anodic current (Fig. 7a), which demonstrated typical characteristics of n-type semiconductor materials. That is, the n-type semiconductor will release electrons under light illumination and increase the amount of electrons passing to the outer electric circuit, resulting in an increase in the photocurrent. The open-circuit voltage after stopping the illumination every time shows a slow decay for the Bi2S3 thin films (Fig. 7b). Under open-circuit conditions, electrons accumulate within the nanostructured semiconductor films following visible irradiation and shift the apparent Fermi level to negative potentials. Once the illumination is stopped, the accumulated electrons are slowly discharged because they are scavenged by the redox species in the electrolyte. Moreover, the slow decay indicates that excited electrons can survive longer and hence can facilitate electron transport without undergoing losses at grain boundaries. The results show the advantage of assembling semiconductor particles on the functionalized self-assembled monolayers, which is in agreement with recent studies employing 1D nanostructured architecture.35

(b) Open-circuit photovoltage response of a Bi2S3 thin film reacted for 120 min. (c) Short-circuit density and open-circuit voltage at different stages of the reaction. (d) Variation of photocurrent density as a function of different illumination wavelengths from 380 nm to 680 nm after reacting for 120 min. 
The photocurrent density and open-circuit voltage varies with deposition time (Fig. 7c). The maximum JSC and VOC were seen at a reaction time of 120 min. The two effects account for the difference in the photocurrent density and open-circuit voltage for various reaction times on the ITO/Bi2S3 electrode. To a great extent, the amount of photoexcited electrons is dependent on the thickness of the film. The increase in photo and dark conductivities with an increase in thickness (<1 μm) can arise from the enhancement of the charge carrier mobility (μ) and/or the photo carrier lifetime (τ).16 The thicker films possess an effectively larger solar photon absorbing volume. Moreover, the increasing of the Bi2S3 particle size also enhances the amount of photoexcited electrons due to an inherently larger response in the visible region. On the other hand, after reacting for 120 min the JSC and VOC slightly decreased, possibly due to the slight increase in electron–hole recombination resulting from aggregation of Bi2S3 nanoparticles on the thin film surface. The FESEM image (Fig. 4c) of the thin film with a reaction time of 180 min confirmed the phenomenon of Bi2S3 nanoparticle aggregation. The photocurrent action spectrum of the Bi2S3 thin film reacted for 120 min is shown under monochromatic excitation from 380 nm to 680 nm with an intensity of 1 mW cm−2 and a bias of 0 V. The current density was collected by an electrochemical workstation with a two-electrode system including a Pt counter electrode and the Bi2S3 thin film as the working electrode. The results show that under monochromatic excitation from 380 nm to 680 nm the Bi2S3 thin films had an obvious photocurrent response, which indicates that Bi2S3 thin films are promising materials for application in photovoltaic converters.
Selective deposition of Bi2S3 on –CH3 and –NH2-terminated SAMs

Fig. 8a–c show micrograph images of patterned Bi2S3 microarrays with different feature sizes (50, 130, and 250 μm) on the ITO glass substrates. The patterns showed high selectivity on the –NH2-terminated regions. When the hydrophobic/hydrophilic patterned –CH3/–NH2-terminated SAMs were allowed to come in contact with the CBD reaction solution, deposition occurred only on the hydrophilic regions (–NH2-terminated SAMs). Fig. 8d is the FESEM micrograph of the in-circle regions (bismuth sulfide patterns) in magnification. The crystals grown in the amino-terminated (in-circle) areas are densely packed. Most of the crystals are less than 50 nm in diameter. Meanwhile in the methyl-terminated (out-of-circle) regions, there is almost no Bi2S3. Although a few nanoparticles attached onto the OTS surface due to van der Waals interactions, the weakly bonded deposition on the hydrophobic regions (–CH3-terminated SAMs) would be peeled off by ultrasonic washing to give out a pattern with regular and high resolution. Further, using three-dimensional (3D) Surface Profiler, we observed that Bi2S3 is only present in the –NH2-terminated SAMs (Fig. 9a–c).

Optical and photoelectrochemical properties of patterned Bi2S3 thin films with different feature sizes
The patterned Bi2S3 thin films with different features on the ITO surface should have different absorbance intensities due to their different ordered arrangements of discrete Bi2S3 domains. Fig. 10a shows the UV-vis spectra of the as-patterned Bi2S3 thin films with different feature sizes (50, 130, and 250 μm) on the ITO substrates. As expected, the patterned Bi2S3 thin films with different features had different absorptions in the visible range, and the absorbance intensity increased with the density of discrete Bi2S3 domains. This improvement in performance is due in part to the increase of surface area resulting from the increase in density of the Bi2S3 domains, which leads to higher absorption. On the other hand, the light is scattered and reflected several times within the patterned thin film so the multiple scattering produces a longer optical path length within the patterned thin film, which in turn enhances the absorption.
 Fig. 10  UV-vis absorption spectra (a) and photocurrent responses (b) of patterned Bi2S3 microarray electrodes with different feature sizes under the on-off visible light illumination. 

Fig. 10b presents the photocurrent responses of the patterned thin film electrodes with various feature sizes illuminated with visible light. When the light was regularly switched on and off, a series of almost identical electric signals could be obtained. The JSC values of the 50 μm patterned electrode and 250 μm patterned electrode were 0.15 mA cm−2 and 0.012 mA cm−2, respectively. The above results indicate that the photocurrent density depends on the feature sizes of the Bi2S3 electrode. Moreover, the photocurrent density of the patterned thin film with the 50 μm-size feature exhibited an almost 9 times larger photocurrent density than a similar thin film without patterning. The enhancement is due not only to the increase of the surface area of the patterned Bi2S3 electrode, but also photonic enhancement or an increased optical path length within the patterned Bi2S3 thin film with a smaller feature size, resulting from multiple reflection of incident light, which might lead to enhanced photocurrent generation.36 We believe the higher photocurrent density and efficiency can be achieved through increasing the thickness of films and the surface area resulting from the decreasing feature size of patterns.
Conclusions
Highly crystalline Bi2S3 thin films with low electrical resistivity were prepared successfully on the APTS SAMs in an aqueous solution of bismuth nitrate and sodium thiosulfate at low temperatures. Bi2S3 nanocrystals are in situ assembled to the highly compact, homogeneous and well-adherent Bi2S3 films. Compared to other Bi2S3 CBD, this is a very promising method for forming highly crystalline Bi2S3 thin films without any post thermal treatment, resulting from heterogeneous nucleation on the functionalized SAMs. The variation of optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the Bi2S3 films is related to an increase of the film thickness. UV-vis spectra showed all Bi2S3 thin films have strong absorption in the visible range. Meanwhile, the Bi2S3 thin films have very intense photocurrent responses when the light is regularly switched “on” and “off”, and a series of almost identical electric signals can be obtained and hold the photocurrent stable. Therefore, Bi2S3 is a candidate material for solar photovoltaic converters and photodetectors due to an appropriate band gap and sensitive response for the absorption of sunlight. In addition, micropatterned Bi2S3 thin films were successfully fabricated on a –NH2/–CH3 terminated SAMs surface combined with the ultraviolet lithography process. The optical microscope and 3D surface profiler images showed that the high selectivity and sharp boundaries of the patterned Bi2S3 thin films can be obtained under optimal deposition conditions. The characteristic UV-vis spectrum and photocurrent response spectrum demonstrated that these properties were dependent on the feature sizes of the Bi2S3 patterns. Moreover, patterning the electrode offers the introduction of a large surface area and the photonic band structure into the photovoltaic device to further enhance the performance. Ultimately, the approaches described here should be applicable to the creation of thin film photovoltaic systems for large surface area systems, including microsystems devices, portable power devices and related applications.
