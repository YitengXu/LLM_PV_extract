    , Accepted 5th June 2018First published on 7th June 2018AbstractPure and Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films (Mn content: 1 to 5 mole%) were deposited on indium doped tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates by a single step electrochemical deposition method at low temperature (358 K). The as-deposited pure CuInSe2 thin films were irradiated with Au8+ ions (100 MeV) at room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperature with an ion fluency of 1 × 1014 ions per cm2. Glancing angle X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the as-deposited pure and Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films and the irradiated thin films have a tetragonal crystal structure without any trace of secondary phases. Mn2+ doping does not alter the tetragonal structure of CuInSe2 thin films except for a strong (112) plane preferred orientation in all the doped thin films. The absorption coefficient's fall is sharper for 5 mole% Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films than for pure and 1 to 4 mole% Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films due to better crystallinity. Magnetic measurements reveal that Mn2+ doping into the CuInSe2 lattice induces ferromagnetism. The electrical studies of Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films show that hole mobility and hole concentration increase with a slight decrease in resistivity. Mn2+ in CuInSe2 thin films acts as an acceptor and the original p-type conductivity is retained. The new antistructural modeling for describing the defects in the CuInSe2:Mn system shows that the dissolution of the Mn cations in the chalcopyrite matrix increases the hole concentration. Solar light irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 on Mn2+ (5 mole%) doped and LNT irradiated CuInSe2 thin film-based cells resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 6.38 and 4.57%, respectively.
1. Introduction
CuInSe2, one of the I–III–VI2 (I = Cu and Ag, III = Al, Ga and In and VI = S, Se and Te) type semiconductors, crystallizes in the chalcopyrite or sphalerite structure.1,2 The material properties of CuInSe2 can be varied by replacing part of indium by gallium and/or part of selenium by sulphur to form Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2, and solar energy conversion efficiencies higher than 19% have been achieved using these materials.3 Moreover, CuInSe2 based solar cells are very stable and thus their operational life times are long. The factorable optical properties of these materials (direct energy band gap and high absorption coefficient) allow the use of thin films (few micrometers) instead of thick slices of bulk silicon. This reduces the consumption of materials. CuInSe2 based thin films can be prepared by different methods starting from both gas and liquid phases.
One of the main challenges in solar energy research is to find a fabrication method that results in high-quality thin films at low cost and is easily scalable.3 Electrochemical deposition (ECD) is a simple and economic technique to deposit thin-film materials for large scale industrial applications.4 The structure, chemical composition and surface morphology of the films and their evolution are related to the variation in synthesis parameters such as the applied potential, deposition time, solution temperature, solution pH and composition.
The major obstacle towards commercialisation of CuInSe2 based solar cells has been the lack of a cost-effective deposition method amenable to large-scale production. ECD has been envisaged as the most promising deposition technique for CuInSe2 films for application in photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical cells. In this respect the co-deposition process for CuInSe2 from an electrolyte containing Cu, In and Se ionic species is a useful method to get large-area films at low cost. Several research groups have reported CuInSe2 film formation using this route with various degrees of success. Chaure et al. have reported the deposition of p−, i− and n type thin film layers of CuInSe2 onto fluorine doped indium oxide (FTO) substrates and the deposition of p+, p, i, n and n+ CuInGaSe2 layers onto glass/TCO/n-CdS substrates from a single electrodeposition bath.5,6 Recently, Zhong's group have incorporated Zn in CuInSe2 to obtain the absorption spectra at 1000 nm with PCE around 9%.7 Efficiency has been further enhanced to 12% by a nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon counter electrode in Zn–Cu–In–Se quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).8 However, these QDSSCs still suffer from the issues of low efficiency and poor stability under drastic conditions compared with the conventional solar cells.
During the last decade, there has been increased research interest in doped/substituted chalcopyrite semiconductors due to their wide range of device applications. Semiconductor materials containing manganese are of interest as the magnetic properties and the association of manganese can modify and complement the semiconductor properties.9,10 It has been found that adamantine compounds with tetrahedral coordination can accept a large amount of manganese in cation substitutional solid solution. By combining charges and spins into a single substance dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) give rise to a new area of spintronic applications including spin-valve transistors, spin-emitting diodes, and non-volatile storage and logic devices.11 The ferromagnetism (FM) (considering the Mn pair as the first neighbour) decreases in the order CuAlS2 → CuGaS2 → CuInS2 and CuGaS2 → CuGaSe2 → CuGaTe2, i.e. the FM stability becomes weaker when the cation or the anion becomes heavier in this chalcopyrite.12 Matsushita et al.13 have studied the Mn-substituted CuInSe2 solid solutions and found that the manganese solubility limit reached up to 10% in the Cu or In sites. Optical and charge transport properties of a CuIn1−xGaxSe2 solar cell,14 structural study of the Ge doped CuGaSe2 compound15 and magnetic properties of the Zn(1−x)MnxIn2Te4 semiconductor for concentration 0.3 < x < 1.0 have been studied.16 In the case of the ternary CuGaSe2, it was shown theoretically that the substitution of Mn2+ at the Ga3+ site produces the holes necessary for ferromagnetism.17,18 Electronic band structures of transition metal substituted chalcopyrites (Cu4MGa3S8 with M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn) have been elucidated.19
The advantage of Mn2+ doping is that it creates an additional electronic state in the CdS host material, which reduces electron–hole recombination and increases the short current density of QDSSCs. Furthermore, Mn has d orbital (4T1 → 6A1) spin and orbital forbidden states, which increase the life time of the excited electron.20 In addition, this type of engineering structure controls the interfacial charge recombination and increases the PCE of the cell. The mid-gap state originated from Mn doping induces the electrons to be trapped, preventing them from recombination with holes and with the oxidized polysulfide electrolyte. Thus, a clear picture of the structural modifications through Mn incorporation is crucial to understanding the changes in the band structure and optical properties.
Swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation offers a broad range of possibilities to modify the structure and properties of materials and is used in diverse applications21 because a very high local energy density is deposited into the solid along the path of the ions. The linear density of energy loss of SHI irradiation is on the order of keV nm−1, which results in a very short (several hundreds of picoseconds), very localized (a cylinder of approximately 10 nm in diameter) and very high (approximately 0.1 eV per atom) excitation yield of electrons.22 The changes are strongly dependent on the mass of the incident ion, the irradiation energy, fluences and temperature. The irradiation may cause ionization or excitation and possibly displacement of atoms from their sites in the lattice of the materials.23 Recently, efforts have been made by several groups to study the irradiation induced defects in chalcopyrite compounds.24–27
The main objective of the present work is to prepare good quality pure and Mn doped CuInSe2 thin films by ECD for thin film solar cells. Pure CuInSe2 thin films were irradiated with Au8+ ions at room temperature (RT) and liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT). We investigate the effect of Mn2+ doping and irradiation on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of these CuInSe2 thin films. Heterojunction solid solar cells with the structure ITO/pure CuInSe2/ZnSe/Au, ITO/(1 to 5 mole%) Mn–CuInSe2/ZnSe/Au, ITO/RT-irradiated-CuInSe2/ZnSe/Au and ITO/LNT-irradiated-CuInSe2/ZnSe/Au were fabricated and the performances of these devices were measured.
2. Experimental section
Cupric sulphate (CuSO4), indium sulphate In2(SO4)3, selenium dioxide (SeO2), manganese chloride (MnCl2) and the ITO substrate (resistance ∼10 Ω sq−1, thickness of the conducting layer 180 nm and transparency around 83% at 550 nm) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) was purchased from Spectrochem (India). All the chemicals were used without further purification. Double distilled water was used to prepare all the solutions and to rinse the electrodes.
Pure and Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films were prepared by electrochemical deposition (ECD) on indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates at a constant bath temperature (358 K) using a simple conventional three electrode system (CH Instruments 604E, USA) with an ITO coated glass substrate as the working electrode, saturated calomel [Ag, AgCl|KCl] electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and Pt wire as the counter electrode. The ITO coated glass substrate was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with ethanol to remove any adhering impurities and then washed with double distilled water. Several different deposition conditions were tried to arrive at the optimized experimental condition. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique was used for ECD and the deposition solution was prepared by mixing 15 ml of 0.1 mol dm−3 CuSO4, 15 ml of 0.1 mol dm−3 In2(SO4)3, 0 to 5 mole% of MnCl2, 30 ml of 0.3 mol dm−3 SeO2 and 20 ml of double distilled water. The ECD bath solution pH (∼2) was adjusted by adding conc. H2SO4. The linear sweep for ECD was between −900 mV and +900 mV at a scan rate of 1.5 mV s−1 and the mixture was magnetically stirred for several minutes to get a homogeneous mixture. The deposition duration was 10 minutes. The as-deposited pure and Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films were washed thoroughly with double distilled water, followed by ethanol.
Pure CuInSe2 thin films were irradiated with Au8+ ions of 100 MeV at a current density of 3 pnA per cm2 (particle nanoamperes per cm2) and an ion fluency of 1 × 1014 ions per cm2 at room temperature (RT) and liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT) using a 16 MV Tandem pelletron accelerator at the Inter University Accelerator Centre (IUAC), New Delhi, India. The duration of irradiation time was 2 hours and 30 minutes. The irradiation was carried out in a materials science beamline with a background pressure of 3 × 10−7 Torr.
The fabrication of the photovoltaic cell began with the deposition of pure and Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 onto an ITO substrate by ECD. ZnSe was deposited by ECD using SeO2 as the anion source according to our previous report28 on Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films. The total thickness of the thin films after the second deposition was approximately 2 μm. Finally, the back contact of the cells was established by radio frequency (RF) sputtering of gold dots and the total active area of the cell was 0.22 cm2.
Structural elucidation of the pure, Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films was carried out by glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) studies using a Bruker AXS Diffractometer Plus/D8 Advanced Spectrometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5405 Å) radiation with a scan speed of 1° per minute and an increment of 0.02°. The glancing angle was fixed at 2°. The surface roughness and surface morphology of the thin films were studied using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Nanoscope III – a multimode scanning probe microscope). The optical transmission spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-visible-NIR spectrometer in the range 200–2000 nm. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films were recorded at 80 K on a Varian E-112 EPR spectrometer operating at X-band frequencies having 100 kHz field modulation and phase sensitive detection to obtain the first derivative EPR signal. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) with a g value of 2.0036 was used as an internal field marker for g factor calculations. Magnetic measurements (M–H) on the Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films were carried out using a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. CH Instruments 604E was used for electrochemical studies such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electrical measurements of the pure, Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films were made in the van der Pauw configuration with gold (Au) contacts and indium soldered platinum wires to the contact plate were used. Conductivity type was measured by the hot point probe method. The photocurrent voltage (J–V) of heterojunction solar cells was measured using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under a white light irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 illumination from an AM 1.5 solar simulator.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural properties
Glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) patterns of pure and 1 to 5 mole% Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films along with those of the irradiated CuInSe2 thin films are shown in Fig. 1, and the Bragg lines are indexed. In the pure as-deposited CuInSe2 thin film (Fig. 1a) the observed peaks are due to the (112), (220) and (303) planes of the tetragonal phase. The as-deposited Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films (Fig. 1b–f) show patterns similar to those of the pure CuInSe2 thin film and no additional peaks are observed suggesting the absence of impurities such as MnSe, Cu2Se, In2Se3 or Mn alloys. Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films retain the tetragonal structure of CuInSe2 with no appreciable change in peak positions suggesting that manganese substitution at such low concentrations does not modify the chalcopyrite structure.

Irradiated CuInSe2 thin films (Fig. 1g and h) show improved crystallinity with increased GAXRD peak intensities and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM). The crystallinity of the film obtained after irradiation at the liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT) (Fig. 1h) is better than that of the film obtained after irradiation at room temperature (RT) (Fig. 1g). While the irradiated films show (112) and (200) peaks as in the case of the as-prepared film they do not show (220) and (303) peaks. Instead, two new peaks corresponding to (004) and (204) planes are observed in the patterns of the irradiated samples. The disappearance of (220) and (303) diffractions and the appearance of (004) and (204) diffractions in irradiated CuInSe2 thin films may be due to strains created by irradiation and improved crystallinity respectively. The lattice constants of pure, Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films were calculated from the powder X-ray diffraction data using CRYSFIRE software and these are listed in Table 1. These values, when substituted in the tetrahedral distortion formula (δ = 2 − c/a), resulted in negative δ values for all the samples indicating the possibility of tetrahedral distortions. The ω value, which is a measure of anion displacements calculated using the formula (c/a)2 = 2 + 32(1/2 − ω), of pure CuInSe2 thin films is little higher compared to that of Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films.

Table 1 lists the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the (112) diffraction peak of the pure, Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films. The FWHM values of the (112) peak of all the Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films are less than those of pure CuInSe2 thin films. The average crystallite size (D) was evaluated from the FWHM of the (112) diffraction peak using Scherrer's equation [D = 0.9 λ/βcosθ], where 0.9 constant is the shape factor (the dimensionless shape factor has a typical value of about 0.9) and θ is the Bragg angle, β is the FWHM of the diffraction line in radians and λ is the X-ray wavelength. The calculated average crystallite sizes were found to be in the range of 33–114 nm and are listed in Table 1. The decrease in the FWHM value of CuInSe2 with ion irradiation suggests improved crystallinity and reduced defects.
3.2. Surface morphology and elemental compositions
The thin films were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) for surface topography and morphology. Fig. 2 shows the AFM surface images of pure, Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films. The surfaces of the as-deposited pure and Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films appear adherent, compact, granular and homogeneous with agglomerated nano-crystalline particles well distributed throughout the whole surface without any void or acicular protuberance. The CuInSe2 thin film surface shows dramatic surface modifications distributed over the surface after irradiation and the formation of a hillock structure which may be formed due to the amorphization–recrystallization process.29,30 During energy loss of the incident ions, a very high hot regime is formed in the wake of incident ions, which may result in the melting of the CuInSe2 thin film. Due to melting of the CuInSe2 thin films followed by cooling, recystallization takes place to give the observed hillock topography. The film crystallinity, morphology and texture are associated with the surface roughness. The root mean square values of surface roughness values of pure, Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films were evaluated from the AFM images and the data are presented in Table 2.

The cross-sectional scanning electron micrographic (SEM) image of the substrate/ITO/pure CuInSe2/ZnSe solar cell shown in Fig. 3(a) reveals that the thicknesses of the CuInSe2 layer and the subsequent ZnSe layer are about 800 and 200 nm respectively. In order to study the elemental composition of the as-deposited pure and Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films, energy dispersive X-ray analyser (EDAX) spectral data of different regions of the films were recorded with an incident electron beam of 20 keV. Typical spectra obtained for pure CuInSe2 and Mn doped (3 and 5 mole%) thin films are presented in Fig. 3(b–d). The compositions of all the thin films are listed in Table 2. In the pure CuInSe2 thin film (Fig. 3(b)) the relative proportion expressed in atomic ratio for Cu:In:Se is 1:1:2, which is consistent with the theoretical stoichiometry of CuInSe2. The stoichiometric selenium content suggests the absence of anion vacancies, which may noticeably alter the aggregate optical and electronic properties in the film. The EDAX spectra of 3 and 5 mole% Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films shown in Fig. 3(c and d) indicated that they contained Cu, In, Mn and Se. There is a reduction in the indium (In) content when the concentration of manganese (Mn) increases in the doped CuInSe2 films. These results indicate that Mn might substitute at the In site, suggesting the formation of CuIn1−xMnxSe2 compounds.

3.3. Optical properties and EPR spectroscopy
The optical transmittance spectra of the pure, Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films were recorded between 200 and 2000 nm at room temperature. Absorption coefficients (α) were estimated from the transmittance spectra of the thin films. Fig. 4 shows the plot of (αhν)2versus photon energy (hν). The band gap increases with the increase in Mn concentration in the doped films and it is higher for irradiated CuInSe2 thin films compared to the as-prepared pure CuInSe2 thin film. It may be observed that the fall of absorption coefficient with the wavelength of incident radiation at the absorption edge gets sharper as Mn concentration in the doped films increases. The irradiated CuInSe2 thin films also show a sharper fall compared to the as-prepared pure CuInSe2 thin film. In the irradiated CuInSe2, the induced lattice ordering causes the increase in the band gap. The band gaps in pure, Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films are given in Table 2.
 Fig. 4  (αhν)2vs. photon energy of pure, Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films. 
The incorporation of manganese in CuInSe2 is probed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The EPR spectra recorded at liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT) are presented in Fig. 5. The spectra show clear hyperfine splitting at very low Mn concentration up to 3%, the g factor is 2.007–2.015 and the hyperfine constant (A) is 67.2–68.8 G. The clear hyperfine splitting in Fig. 5 indicates that Mn2+ ions are hardly influenced by In, and the Mn ions are suggested to be doped in the CuInSe2 crystal system. Also this hyperfine structure gradually disappears when the manganese content is increased, due to Mn–Mn interactions. The EPR results confirm that Mn2+ is substituted in the In sites and not just adsorbed on the surface.

3.4. Magnetic measurements
Magnetic measurements were performed on Mn doped CuInSe2 thin films (Mn = 1 to 5 mole%) using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer and the measurements were corrected for substrate effects. The plots of magnetization (M) as a function of applied filed (H) at 20 K are shown in Fig. 6. The Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films showed ferromagnetic ordering with a scarce hysteresis at 20 K and also displayed a saturation magnetization below 2500 Oe with the rapid increase in magnetisation. These data are in good agreement with the data published previously and confirm the proposed antistructural modeling, as only p-type DMSs are expected to be ferromagnetic based on the theory of hole-mediated ferromagnetism.31 The magnetic moment per Mn atom at 20 K of 1, 2, 3 4 and 5 mole% Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films is 0.00179, 0.00249, 0.00284, 0.00317 and 0.00354 emu g−1, respectively. The corresponding coercive fields (HC) for 1, 2, 3 4 and 5 mole% Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films are 74, 75, 76, 78 and 80 Oe, respectively. The width of these M versus H curves increases with an increase in Mn2+ doping concentration up to 5 mole%,

3.5. Electrical properties and antistructural modeling
The electrical measurements of pure, 1–5 mole% Mn doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films were carried out using the Hall effect apparatus with the van der Pauw configuration at room temperature (Table 3). All the thin films exhibit p-type conductivity. The resistivity of the Mn doped films decreases with the increase in Mn concentration. The hole concentration increases with the increase in Mn concentration possibly due to the fact that Mn acts as an acceptor in this material. The hole mobility also increases with the increase in Mn concentration due to reduction in defects. Hole mobility and hole concentration values are higher for irradiated CuInSe2 thin films compared to pure CuInSe2 thin films due to improved crystallinity and reduction in intrinsic defects in the former.

The nature of defects in the Mn-doped CuInSe2 lattice can be described on the basis of antistructural modeling.32–35 In our case CuInSe2 has been considered as the host matrix for Mn2+ doping. The antistructure of the chalcopyrite structure can be written as follows:  with ′ and ′′′ representing the single and triple excess negative charge respectively, ˙˙ the double excess positive charge, VCu and VIn the cationic vacancies, and VSe the anionic vacancies.
In the chalcopyrite matrix the cations Cu+ and In3+ interact with cationic vacancies  and  and selenium anions interact with anionic vacancies :      where × means an effective zero charge. The occupation of the Mn2+ ions plays a crucial role in determining the conductivity type of CuInSe2. Taking into account that Mn prefers the 4b site36 we can expected the substitution of In cations by manganese ions at 4b sites. In our case manganese acts as an aliovalent element for the chalcopyrite lattice and Mn-substitution creates defects – antistructural atoms  – according to the following equations:    
It has been found that the increase of lattice parameters (Table 1) with increasing Mn content is a result of Mn substitution at the In site, because the ionic radius of Mn cations is bigger than the ionic radius of In cations (0.066 nm and 0.062 nm, respectively37). In general, antistructural modeling for Mn doped CuInSe2 can be written as follows:  where y = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5. We can observe that the concentration of holes is twice the concentration of electrons and this confirms the role of Mn as an acceptor in the chalcopyrite matrix, which increases the hole concentration. The defects which may also be present are copper vacancies (VCu) and selenium vacancies (VSe). The selenium vacancies could act as donors to compensate the acceptor. This assumption is in good agreement with the experimental data obtained in this work from electrical measurements of pure and Mn doped CuInSe2.
3.6 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy

Fig. 7 shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the thin film electrodes. EIS is a significant technique to determine the current response in relevance to AC voltage as a function of frequency. The impedance of the electrodes was studied using Nyquist plots in order to investigate the electron transfer at the ITO/pure CuInSe2/electrolyte, ITO/Mn2+ doped CuInSe2/electrolyte, and ITO/irradiated CuInSe2/electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plots were fitted using the Z-view software. The plots consist of semicircles representing charge-transfer resistance and a straight line in the low-frequency region which may be attributed to diffusion of Mn2+ ions into the CuInSe2 crystal lattice with faster interface Mn–In charge (electron) transfer reaction with fine conductivity. EIS has been generally used for semiconducting thin films to measure the charge transfer resistance (Rct). The observed Rct values are 563, 550, 524, 495, 450, 412, 436 and 421 Ω cm2 for the pure, 1–5 mole% Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films, respectively. From these results, it can be noticed that the 5 mole% Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin film exhibits the lowest Rct. This lower Rct value indicates that this film exhibits better ion mobility and higher ionic conductivity which is beneficial for electrochemical device applications. From the results it was found that the 5 mole% Mn doped CuInSe2 thin film showed less charge transfer resistance which is favorable for the faster interfacial charge transfer reaction with fine conductivity.

3.7 Photoelectrochemical measurement and power conversion efficiency
The stability, reproducibility and photoresponses of the photovoltaic cells devised using the films were assessed by photoelectrochemical chronoamperometry and the results are shown in Fig. 8. For this purpose the systems of ITO/pure CuInSe2/ZnSe, ITO/(1 to 5 mole%) Mn–CuInSe2/ZnSe, ITO/RT-irradiated-CuInSe2/ZnSe and ITO/LNT-irradiated-CuInSe2/ZnSe were prepared. The systems were illuminated with light corresponding to the band gap of CuInSe2. The photocurrent–time (I–T) profiles observed for these systems are in agreement with their current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics (discussed later). When the light is turned off there is a sudden fall in the photocurrent and there is no current in the dark. The steady-state photocurrent maximum remains the same after several on–off cycles which reveals that the systems show good stability.

Current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated cells employing a hetero-junction type structure of ITO/pureCuInSe2/ZnSe/Au, ITO/Mn2+ (1–5 mole%) doped CuInSe2/ZnSe/Au, ITO/RT irradiated CuInSe2/ZnSe/Au and ITO/LNT irradiated CuInSe2/ZnSe/Au cells under the 1 sun illumination condition are shown in Fig. 9 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 4. The photovoltaic performance improves when Mn2+ substitutes for In3+ in tetragonal chalcopyrite due to enhancement of charge separation within the interfacial area between Mn–In and ZnSe, providing more effective transport pathways for both electrons and holes. The increased conversion efficiency of the cells made of irradiated films can be related to improved crystallinity of CuInSe2 thin films on irradiation. In the pure CuInSe2 thin film, the surface morphology observed through the AFM image is non-uniform, while on irradiation surface modification was observed, revealing an increase in the compactness of the surface along with uniform grains. These are the causes for enhancement in conversion efficiency by the phenomenon of grain boundary charge transportation.

4. Conclusion
Pure and Mn2+ (1–5 mole%) doped CuInSe2 thin films with a tetragonal structure were successfully deposited on ITO coated glass substrates from an aqueous electrolytic solution by a wet chemical process of the electrochemical deposition (ECD) technique. Mn2+ ions up to 5 mole% could be incorporated in CuInSe2 without altering the tetragonal crystal structure. Au8+ ion irradiation leads to better crystallinity, decreased surface roughness and ordering of thin films with increased band gap energy. The absorption coefficient's fall is sharper for 5 mole% Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films than for pure and 1 to 4 mole% Mn2+ doped CuInSe2 thin films due to better crystallinity. The electrical studies of Mn2+ doped and irradiated CuInSe2 thin films show that hole mobility and hole concentration increase with a slight decrease in resistivity. Mn2+ in CuInSe2 thin films acts as an acceptor and the original p-type conductivity is retained. The 5 mole% Mn2+ doped and LNT irradiated CuInSe2 thin films showed better physicochemical properties. The solar cell devices exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 6.38 and 4.57% for ITO/5 mole% Mn–CuInSe2/ZnSe/Au and ITO/LNT-irradiated-CuInSe2/ZnSe/Au, respectively.
