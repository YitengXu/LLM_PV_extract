, Accepted 20th July 2015First published on 20th July 2015AbstractAn efficient route to synthesize, for the first time, a series of small molecules based on the [A′(D′AD)2] architecture was developed using selective direct heteroarylation of the C–H bond with a Pd(AcO)2/Bu4NBr simple catalytic system. The C–H arylation of the unsymmetrical compound 4-(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole (5) showed that the (C5) in the ethyldioxythiophene moiety is more reactive towards C–H arylation than its counterpart in the thiophene unit. The new small molecules bear two different acceptors and/or donors, which led to decrease the electron band gap and improve the strength of the push–pull system as well as the amount of intramolecular charge transfer from donor to acceptor units. Lactams and imide containing acceptors are used as second electron withdrawing units due to their well conjugated structures, strong π–π interactions and high electron affinity as well as their potential as electron withdrawing units in photovoltaic conjugated materials. All small molecules showed broad absorption spectra with optical band gaps, which were estimated to be in the range of 1.72–1.29 eV. From cyclic voltammetry, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level could be tuned by changing the second acceptor, suggesting high open circuit voltage (Voc). The EHID(EDBTT)2:PC71BM-based solar cells reached a maximum PCE of 3.24%.
Introduction
The development of solution processing of organic solar cells has received considerable attention recently. Small organic molecules have unique advantages such as low cost, flexibility, light weight, and potential for large area device fabrication.1–4 Moreover, small molecules offer potential advantages over conjugated polymers such as their defined molecular structure, high purity, ease of purification, ease of large scale production and good batch-to-batch reproducibility. These advantages encouraged many scientists to design a perfect small molecule chemical structure to improve the optical and electrical properties as well as the power conversion efficiency5–8 that recently reached up to 10%. The first bulk heterojunction solar cell was realized in 1995.9 This design improved the charge extraction and enhanced both light absorption and photocurrent density. Ten years later, the first solution-processed small molecules were introduced as donor materials in the molecular bulk heterojunction (BHJ). These materials based on oligothiophenes, which were investigated as novel electron donors and blended with PCBM, showed a power conversion efficiency in the range of 0.2–0.8%.10,11
Recently, a series of conjugated donor–acceptor (push–pull) chemical structures were developed. This helps to broaden the absorption window, increase the efficiency of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)12a,b along the backbone structure, and enhance the net short circuit current (Jsc)12c–15 in device applications. Among these structures, a series of conjugated (D–A–D) and (A–D–A) small molecules based on 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,16–19 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione,20 diketopyrrolo-pyrrole,21–24 and isoindigo25–27 as electron accepting units were integrated into two low-energy gap oligothiophenes. These materials showed broad absorption bands. Insertion of a second donor into the (D–A–D) small molecule structure offered a variety of architectures such as [A(D–D′)2]28 and [D′(D–A–D)2]29–31 building blocks.
In parallel, most organic small molecules are synthesized via Stille and/or Suzuki cross-coupling reactions.32,33 Despite the high selectivity of these synthesis methodologies, they have some disadvantages such as contamination by organometallic intermediates. Recently, we succeeded in the synthesis of isoindigo-based small molecules34 via Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling methodologies, which needed organometallic monomer derivatives that contaminated several byproducts in the net product. To avoid the difficulty faced during the synthesis of some stannyl and/or boronic esters, catalyzed C–H direct heteroarylation was preferred.
In this study, a Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed C–H direct arylation methodology35–37 was used to synthesize a new series of [A′(D′AD)2] constituted small molecules. Compound (5), 4-(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (EDBTT), was the key structure of this class of materials (Scheme 1), which contains ethylene dioxythiophene (EDOT) and thiophene as electron rich cores, offering strong ICT with acceptors and extend the low energy optical transitions.36 In addition, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) afforded high electron affinity, which increased across the backbone structure through the introduction of another electron accepting core such as 2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-di(thien-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione (DTDPP) (7), N,N′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)isoindigo (EHID) (9) and/or 5-hexylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (HTPD) (11) between the two arms of EDBTT to obtain our targets A′(EDBTT)2 (Scheme 1). This shows that the CH-arylation methodology is successful in the synthesis of such complicated small molecules in a minimal number of steps.

All the previous acceptors have high electron affinities that help to lower the HOMO levels and maintain high oxidation potentials. In addition, the aliphatic chains attached to these acceptor moieties induced solubility of the obtained small molecules in most organic solvents,2 which assists in solution processable solar cells.
Experimental
Materials
3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%), thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (Frontier Scientific), 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), and 2-(tributylstannyl)-thiophene (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) were used as received. The materials 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (1),38,39 2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-di(5-bromothien-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione (7),40 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-isoindigo (9),41 2-tributylstannyl-3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene (4),42 and 1,3-dibromo-5-hexylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (HTPD) (11)43 were synthesized by literature procedures.
Characterization
1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian spectrometer (400 and/or 300 MHz). The UV/Vis absorption spectra were obtained with a Varian Cary UV/Vis/NIR-5000 spectrophotometer on the pure samples. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed with a TA instrument (DSC-TA Q-20) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed with a B-class solar simulator: potentiostat/galvanostat (SP-150 OMA company); the supporting electrolyte was tetrabutylammonium-hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile (0.1 M) and the scan rate was 50 mV s−1. A three-electrode cell was used; a Pt wire and silver/silver chloride [Ag in KCl (0.1 M)] were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO) of the materials were determined from the following relationships: EHOMO = −Eox − 4.71 and ELUMO = −Ered − 4.71 (in eV), where Eox and Ered are the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, of the material vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The small molecule thin films for electrochemical measurements were drop-coated from a material/chloroform solution on ITO glass slides. 10 mg mL−1 XRD experiments were performed with a Bruker D8 advanced model diffractometer and with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) at a generator voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA.
Fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic devices
The bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/organic material:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The ITO substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication using a detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. Surface treatment was performed by exposing ITO to UV/ozone treatment. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI4083) solution was spin coated at 5000 rpm for 20 s on an ITO substrate, serving as an anode. The coated substrate was dried at 150 °C for 10 min in air and was transferred into a glove box filled with N2. The small molecule:PC71BM (1:1, w/w), dissolved in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1, was spin cast on the PEDOT:PSS layer and dried at 100 °C for 5 min (except for the first small molecule). The cathode, Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm), was deposited in a vacuum chamber (10−6 Torr). The active area was 4.64 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination with light-source operation at 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a QE-IPCE 3000 spectral response/QE/IPCE measurement system (Titan Electro-Optics Co. Ltd).

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (1) was coupled with 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene (2) under Stille coupling conditions to afford 4-bromo-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (3) in a good yield. Compound 3 was then reacted with 2-tributylstannyl-3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene (4) to obtain co-monomer 5. To optimize the synthesis of new small molecules using direct C–H arylation, several reaction conditions were utilized, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The optimal reaction condition was achieved by using Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst, and terabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) and KOAc as a base. The temperature, solvent, and concentration were held constant for this study, based on general procedures reported in the literature.35–37 Furthermore, the Pd(OAc2)(O-Tol)33 catalyst was not sufficient for this reaction even when combined with TBAB and/or tris(2-methoxyphenyl)phosphine (L2) (Table S1, ESI†). By using a one-step, highly selective, Pd-catalyzed direct arylation coupling reaction, compound 5 coupled with a series of electron withdrawing moieties, 7, 9 and/or 11, afforded DTDPP(EDBTT)2 (8), EHID(EDBTT)2 (10) and HTPD(EDBTT)2 (12), respectively (Scheme 1).
The selectivity resulted from the difference in reactivity between (C5) in the EDOT moiety and its counterpart in the thiophene unit. The (C5) in the EDOT moiety is more active due to the effect of the cyclic ether oxygen atom, which acts as a directing group. This cyclic ether oxygen attracts the Pd catalyst by a coordination bond and makes the catalyst much nearer to position C5 in the EDOT moiety, see the proposed reaction mechanism pathway (Scheme S1, ESI†). This simple catalytic system decreases the by-products obtained and avoids the use of organometallic reagents, as well as helps to obtain a reasonable product yield.33
All the new material structures were thermally stable and were confirmed with NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR and elemental analysis. The FT-IR spectra provided evidence for the presence of the lactam and imide groups by showing two peaks assigned to the free carbonyl (–CO) stretching vibration in the range of 1682–1800 cm−1 (Fig. S1, ESI†).
Thermal stability
The DSC curve exhibited clear melting peaks and phase transitions of crystallization of the A′(D′AD)2-based small molecules, DTDPP(EDBTT)2, EHID(EDBTT)2 and HTPD(EDBTT)2 (Fig. 1b). The melting (Tm), crystallization (Tc) and decomposition (Td) temperatures are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). As it is known, the molecular weights, intermolecular interactions and alkyl chain affect the thermal properties. The melting point of DTDPP(EDBTT)2 increased from 157 to 174 °C in the case of EHID(EDBTT)2 due to the highly planar structure and the rigidity of isoindigo unit. Furthermore, DTDPP(EDBTT)2 showed a slight phase transition signal observed at around 101 °C, supposed to be a result of a twisted structure for the present molecule due to the steric hindrance at the linkage between the EDOT and benzothiadiazole units.44

HTPD(EDBTT)2 showed a low Tm at 85 °C due to the attachment of the hexyl chain to the small sized TPD unit. The thermal stability of all the small molecules was observed by TGA at a heating rate of 100 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 1a). If the threshold for thermal decomposition is defined as a mass loss of 5%, all the materials possess good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures above 350 °C.
X-ray diffraction analysis
To study the crystalline structure and the planarity of the obtained materials 8, 10 and 12, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were obtained (Fig. S2, ESI†). New small molecules exhibited two important diffraction peaks, the first one at approximately 2θ = 5.79° (DTDPP(EDBTT)2), 6.64° (EHID(EDBTT)2) and 5.45° (HTPD(EDBTT)2), which correspond to a d-spacing of 15.4, 14.0 and 17.1 Å, respectively. These spacings refer to the interchain spacing between the planes of the main conjugated backbone of these small molecules separated by the corresponding ethylhexyl- and/or hexyl-chains. The high intensities observed in the diffraction peaks of DTDPP(EDBTT)2 and EHID(EDBTT)2 proved to have a better ordering in the solid state, which would lead to a good film morphology for BHJ solar cells. The second peak assigned at 2θ = 21.46° (DTDPP(EDBTT)2) and 21.30° (HTPD(EDBTT)2) with a d-spacing of 4.1 and 4.3 Å, respectively, demonstrates the π–π stacking between the small molecule backbones and implies long range ordering and a highly organized assembled structure in the solid state. Fig. S3 (ESI†) showed the proposed packed structures in the solid state for DTDPP(EDBTT)2, EHID(EDBTT)2 and HTPD(EDBTT)2.
Optical properties
The optical properties were investigated using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 2), and the data are summarized in Table 1. Considering that the EDBTT unit is fixed, the changes in absorption maximum depend on the active conjugated length induced by the introduction of second acceptors. In general, absorption in the range of 423–468 nm is ascribed to ICT between the EDOT and thiophene donors and the acceptors. In film, in the case of DTDPP, small molecule 8 exhibited a broad absorption with onset absorption (λonset) at 962 nm. DTDPP is considered as a (D–A–D) unit due to the presence of two thiophene units around the DPP core, which extends the effective conjugation length and bathochromically shifts the wide absorption band associated with the DPP core and thiophene rings.34

EHID(EDBTT)2 showed a λmax value of 641 nm. The lowest λmax value was 524 nm in the case of HTPD(EDBTT)2, which was expected to have the lowest ICT. In contrast, DTDPP(EDBTT)2 showed two λmax peaks in solution at 630 and 704 nm, which combined into one peak at 836 nm in the film. All the small molecules have two different high energy absorption bands in the range from 300 to 450 nm, which have been attributed to a more localized π–π* transition due to the presence of two different electron accepting units along the backbone structure.
In particular, when the donor is highly electropositive, the polarizability of the acceptor unit becomes a critical factor to determine the amount of ICT.12a Therefore, using strong electron donor and strong electron acceptor units along the conjugated materials backbone decreases the electron band gap and improves the strength of the push–pull system as well as the performance of organic solar cells by controlling the photo-induced ICT from donor to acceptor units.12b Confirming the previous deduction, all the new synthesized A′(D′AD)2-based small molecules showed more narrow optical band gaps than their counterpart small molecules with the (D–A–D) building block, which have the same number of building units and also based on the same electron withdrawing units (DTDPP,21–24 ID25–27,34a and TPD20), see Table 1.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were obtained for all materials (Fig. 3a). The HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were derived from the onset of oxidation (Eox) and reduction potentials (Ered) of the CV curves of the drop-cast films, using a platinum electrode in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 versus a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. According to the equations, HOMO = −(Eox + 4.71) eV and LUMO = −(Ered + 4.71) eV. The interface barrier present between the small molecule film and the electrode surface made the estimated electronic Eg values quite higher than the optical Eg estimated in thin films. All the materials have low-lying LUMOs because of the increased electron deficiency caused by the addition of one more acceptor. DTDPP(EDBTT)2, EHID(EDBTT)2 and HTPD(EDBTT)2 showed LUMO energy levels at −3.80, −3.89 and −3.87 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b).

DTDPP(EDBTT)2 not only exhibited the highest lying LUMO (−3.80 eV) among the materials under study, but also showed the highest lying HOMO energy level at −5.49 eV because the presence of four thiophene units which increase the electron donating properties also increases the HOMO energy level. EHID(EDBTT)2 and HTPD(EDBTT)2 showed low lying HOMO energy levels at −5.52 and −5.55 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b). The EHOMO, ELUMO and electrochemical band gaps (Eelcg) are summarized in Table 1.
Photovoltaic properties
To estimate the photovoltaic performances of the new synthesized small molecules, BHJ solar cells with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/organic material:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated. The optimized results were obtained by varying the small molecule:PC71BM weight ratios, active layer thicknesses, and annealing temperature.34 The optimized active layer thickness was around 80 nm for all the small molecule:PC71BM blend layers.
All the device parameters are summarized in Table 2. The photovoltaic performances were significantly affected by changing the lactam- and/or imide-containing acceptor core in the small molecule structure and the EHID(EDBTT)2:PC71BM based solar cells reached a maximum PCE of 3.24% with a Voc of 0.83 V, Jsc of 8.13 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.48. The Voc values of each optimized device decreased gradually from 0.88 to 0.75 V as the electron withdrawing ability of the accepting units TPD, DPP and ID decreased. As confirmed by the CV results, HTPD(EDBTT)2 has the HOMO level of −5.65 eV and exhibited a high Voc value of 0.88 V. EHID(EDBTT)2 and DTDPP(EDBTT)2 showed Voc values of 0.83 and 0.75 V, respectively.

Unlike the Voc trend, EHID(EDBTT)2 exhibited a high Jsc value of 8.13 mA cm−2, while HTPD(EDBTT)2 showed low Jsc value of 3.51 mA cm−2, due to its narrow light absorption window as well as low ICT. The Jsc value of DTDPP(EDBTT)2 was 6.87 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4a). To examine the accuracy of the Jsc from the J–V measurements, the corresponding external quantum efficiencies of the fabricated solar cells were measured under the illumination of monochromatic light (Fig. 4b). All the Jsc results were calculated by integrating the EQE with an AM 1.5 G reference spectrum matched with the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurements. As shown in Fig. 4b, EHID(EDBTT)2 showed much higher EQE values of up to 45% in the broad wavelength range 400−750 nm, compared to those of HTPD(EDBTT)2 and DTDPP(EDBTT)2. Moreover, in spite of the broad absorption of DTDPP(EDBTT)2, it showed low external quantum efficiencies of around 34% (Fig. 4b) reflecting some leakage in the number of charge carriers.

Morphology analysis
In order to imply the effect of the active layer morphology on the device performance, the morphologies of all the small molecule:PC71BM blend films were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  AFM images (5 × 5 μm2) of (small molecule:PC71BM, 1:1) active layers. 
HTPD(EDBTT)2:PC71BM film showed low (rms) of around 4.16 nm compared with the other small molecule active layers, but the low melting point of HTPD(EDBTT)2 small molecule and the incompatibility with PC71BM drop the Jsc to 3.51 mA cm−2 and the net PCE to 0.80%. In spite of the high root mean-square (rms) roughness of EHID(EDBTT)2:PC71BM and DTDPP(EDBTT)2:PC71BM, determined to be 5.38 and 11.53 nm, respectively, they exhibited somewhat different AFM topology compared with the HTPD(EDBTT)2:PC71BM film. They showed a continuous network, which is good for obtaining high Jsc values of around 8.13 and 6.87 mA cm−2, respectively. Thus, the EHID(EDBTT)2:PC71BM-based solar cell exhibited the highest photovoltaic performance among the solution-processed small molecule solar cells in this study.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of new constituted small molecules based on the [A′(D′AD)2] composition were synthesized via a Pd(OAc)2/Bu4NBr catalytic system. All the new materials, DTDPP(EDBTT)2, EHID(EDBTT)2 and HTPD(EDBTT)2, included two different strong acceptors and two different strong donors to induce an efficient push–pull donor–acceptor system. This new system offered high intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and high short circuit current (Jsc) in organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications. Due to the broad absorption window, the optical band gaps of the materials were in the range of 1.29–1.72 eV; this result closely matches the ideal low band gap of small molecules, as suggested in the design criteria for organic solar cells. EHID(EDBTT)2:PC71BM-based solar cells reached a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.24% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.83 V, a large short circuit current Jsc of 8.13 mA cm−2, and exhibited a low fill factor (FF) of 0.48. New photovoltaic devices and a number of additives will be further studied to improve the FF as well as the PCE.
