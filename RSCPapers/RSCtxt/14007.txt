    , Accepted 17th August 2019First published on 22nd August 2019AbstractCsPbBr3 is widely used in solar cells and LEDs for its excellent photoelectric properties that are also attractive for CO2 photoreduction, but it is less used in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 mainly owing to its limited charge separation efficiency. To alleviate this issue, herein, all-inorganic orthorhombic CsPbBr3 was combined with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and the resultant composite (CsPbBr3@g-C3N4) showed enhanced activity in CO2 photoreduction. Under the irradiation of AM1.5 filter for 12 h, CO2 was converted into CH4 and CO with high selectivity to methane (91%) and the total amount of gaseous products up to ∼300 μmol g−1. This reactivity is 6-fold and 4-fold higher than that of pure g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3, respectively. CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 also shows excellent catalytic activity at low concentrations of CO2. Studies of energy band level and steady-state and transient photoluminescence spectroscopy indicated that the incorporation of CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 increases charge separation, which may result in sharply enhanced catalytic efficiency. This study has provided opportunities for the combination of CsPbBr3 and other semiconductor catalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.
1. Introduction
The climate warming and energy shortage all over the world caused by the increased burning of fossil fuels have attracted massive attention.1–3 Inspired by the natural photosynthesis, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to industrial chemicals and fuels using sunlight as the power source is considered to be an ideal path to solve the above-mentioned problems.4–6 Thus far, many materials such as metal oxides and sulfides have been employed as catalysts in CO2 photoreduction.7,8 Although some progress has been made based on these materials in CO2 reduction, there are still some problems that need to be solved. For example, various reported catalysts could only be active under pure CO2 atmosphere. However, actually, the concentration of CO2 in the exhaust gases released from industries is between 5% and 20%.9 In addition, most systems demand extra sacrificial agents, for example, triethanolamine (TEOA), to donate electrons.10–15 This increases the economic and environment burden. Therefore, the exploration of novel photocatalytic systems that trigger CO2 reduction under diluted CO2 condition without extra sacrificial agents is significant. In recent years, two-dimensional organic semiconductor materials have drawn much attention not only due to the special surface area but also due to excellent visible-light harvesting.16–20 Among them, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), originating from carbon and nitrogen elements, is considered to be a prospective photocatalyst for CO2 reduction with benefits of easy availability, low cost, low toxicity, high chemical stability and moderate visible-light adsorption ability.21–25 In spite of the above-mentioned advantages, the low efficiency of g-C3N4 in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 limits its practical application, largely caused by the rapid recombination of photoinduced electron hole pairs. To solve this issue, many methods have been proposed, and fabricating a heterojunction is a common and efficient route.26–28 Among various heterojunctions, type II (staggered) heterojunctions and Z-scheme band alignment have been efficient in facilitating charge separation.29,30
Halide perovskite materials due to their excellent photoelectric properties have been widely used in light-emitting diodes, photodetectors and other devices.31–33 The enhanced conversion efficiency also reflects the excellent properties of halide perovskite materials, resulting in the rapid development of solar cells. However, this material is at the beginning stage for application in photocatalysis, especially for CO2 reduction. In 2017, Su and colleagues first reported the capability of a halide perovskite material, CsPbBr3 quantum dot, for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under simulated sunlight.34 Considering these merits, herein, the halide perovskite material CsPbBr3 (orthorhombic phase) was introduced into g-C3N4 to fabricate a heterojunction material, and the composite was first used for the photoreduction of CO2 under low concentrations of CO2.
By stirring CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4, the composite material CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 was fabricated. Band alignment studies reveal that the conduction band (CB) of CsPbBr3 (−1.83 eV) was higher than that of g-C3N4, while the valence band (VB +0.69 V) was lower, indicating that the generated holes and electrons could be efficiently separated in this composite. The luminescence and photocurrent measurements proved the effective suppression of charge recombination. The CO2 reduction experiment exhibits that around 274 μmol g−1 of CH4 was yielded by CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 under simulated sunlight. This yield was an order of magnitude higher than that of bare g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3 under the same experimental conditions. When CO2 was diluted to a concentration of 11%, the yield of CH4 and CO was 85 and 20 μmol g−1, respectively.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Structure description
The composite material was synthesized by mixing g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3 in toluene with stirring. The loading amount of CsPbBr3 was identified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results indicated that 1.61 wt% (based on Pb) of CsPbBr3 was loaded, which was named CsPbBr3@g-C3N4.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 1. It was observed in Fig. 1a that g-C3N4 had laminated shape. In the CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 composite (Fig. 1b), the layer structure of g-C3N4 was maintained; however, CsPbBr3 particles were difficult to spot in Fig. 1b. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also performed to investigate the morphology of the hybrid material. In Fig. 1c and d, g-C3N4 in the composites retained the original thin sheet shape of pure g-C3N4, which matched well with the result in SEM images. The structure of CsPbBr3 with polyhedral shape attached to the g-C3N4 surface could be obviously seen in TEM images. The distribution of each element including C, N, Cs, Pb and Br in the composite could be found from the elemental mapping of a selected area (Fig. 1e) (Fig. 4).

2.2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
The phase structure of the obtained CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 was obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. For control, XRD patterns of bare g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3 were also obtained. The XRD images of CsPbBr3, g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 composite are exhibited in Fig. 2. The peaks corresponding to CsPbBr3 were matched well with those of the reported sample with an orthorhombic phase (No. JCPDF #01-072-7929).35 For g-C3N4, the peak positions were at 13.1° and 27.5°, which is consistent with those of the reported g-C3N4.36 For the CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 composite, the characteristic diffraction peaks belonging to CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 could be detected and the peak position remained unanimous, which certified the successful loading of CsPbBr3 onto g-C3N4.

2.3. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy
The chemical structure of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 could also be confirmed by Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The peak positions in the range of 1400 to 1700 cm−1 of pure g-C3N4 and the composite sample were assigned to the stretching vibration modes of heptazine-derived repeated units, which originated from the structure of g-C3N4.37 In addition, there is a strong peak at the position of 810 cm−1 in the spectrum of pure g-C3N4 and the composite sample, which is attributed to the bending vibration of the heptazine ring in g-C3N4.38 Two peaks located at 2854 and 2924 cm−1 were ascribed to CH2 and CH3 symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations, respectively, originating from ligands attached to CsPbBr3.39 The result indicated that CsPbBr3 was incorporated into g-C3N4 successfully.

2.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) could be used to illuminate changes in the composite material, and the XPS spectra of bare CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 were also studied (Fig. S1 and S2†). For pure g-C3N4, the high-resolution XPS spectrum (Fig. S1†) shows C and N elements. The peaks of C 1s at 284.5, 285.6 and 287.8 eV were recorded. The peak at 284.5 eV is due to the sp2 C–C bonds, while the one at 287.8 eV results from the sp2-bonded C in the triazine rings (N–CN). The splitting peaks of N 1s located at 398.1, 398.8, 400.4 and 403.8 eV were observed. The peaks at 398.1 and 398.8 eV are commonly attributed to CN–C and tertiary N bonded to C in N–(C)3, respectively. The peaks with high binding energies at 400.4 and 403.8 eV might originate from quaternary N-bonded three carbon atoms in aromatic cycles and the π-p excitations.40 In comparison with bare g-C3N4, the spectrum of C 1s in CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 exhibits a little shift in peak positions of the one at 284.5 eV moving to 284.3 eV and the peak at 285.6 eV shifting to 285.1 eV. For N 1s, all peaks shifted to the lower energy around 0.2–0.5 eV. For elements belonging to CsPbBr3 (Fig. S2†), Pb 4f peaks appeared at 138 and 142.9 eV.41 The peaks corresponding to Cs 3d appeared at 723.6 and 737.5 eV, and those corresponding to Br 3d appeared at 67.9 and 68.9 eV. In contrast to CsPbBr3, the peaks of Pb 4f in CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 shifted to a higher energy of 138.3 and 143.2 eV, while those of Cs 3d shifted to a lower energy of 723.5 eV and 737.4 eV. Besides these two elements, the shift of the peak positions of Br 3d is most evident, up to 0.4 eV. These shifts may indicate the strong interaction between CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4.
2.5. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy
The light absorption of CsPbBr3, g-C3N4 and composite CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 samples was estimated by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 5). Ultraviolet light and partial visible light (the absorption boundary at ∼460 nm) were absorbed by the prepared g-C3N4. Compared with g-C3N4, the absorption of CsPbBr3 in the visible light region is stronger and the absorption boundary is at ∼550 nm. CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 exhibits an absorption peak at the edge of 460 nm attributed to g-C3N4. The other three adsorption bands with two high energy bands peaking at ∼275 and 363 nm were ascribed to g-C3N4, and the low energy band located at 505 nm originated from CsPbBr3. The evidently enhanced visible-light adsorption may bring about an increased activity in CO2 photoreduction.

2.6. Valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
In composite materials, to enhance the charge separation, the matched energy level of each component is significant. Therefore, the energy band of CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 was analyzed. The valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-XPS) result of CsPbBr3 is shown in Fig. S4.† From VB-XPS, the valence band of CsPbBr3 is +0.69 eV. From Fig. S3,† the band gap (Eg) of CsPbBr3 was estimated to be 2.49 eV. Through calculation, the conduction band of CsPbBr3 was found to be −1.83 eV. Conduction band and valence band energy of g-C3N4 were −0.75 and +1.98 eV follow the references, respectively.42 The energy levels of CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 meet the staggered band alignment (Type II). Such band alignment will facilitate the transfer of photo-induced electrons in CsPbBr3 to g-C3N4 and holes in g-C3N4 to CsPbBr3. Therefore, the charge recombination in both CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 might be suppressed.
2.7. Photocurrent spectroscopy
The response of photocurrent could reflect the degree of photo-induced charge separation in materials. In order to investigate the degree of electron–hole pair separation in CsPbBr3@g-C3N4, the response of the photocurrent of CsPbBr3, g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 was measured under illumination with AM1.5 filter and the result is shown in Fig. 6. The current density of pure CsPbBr3 reached 0.63 μA cm−2, which is a little lower than that of the prepared g-C3N4, while the current density of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 is four times higher than those of CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4, up to 2.71 μA cm−2. The result demonstrated that the incorporation of CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 could enhance the separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs efficiently. Gradual increase in the intensity after irradiation also indicated the efficient suppression of charge recombination. Moreover, during five cycles, no obvious change in intensity was observed, indicating the photostability of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4.

2.8. Steady and transient-state emission
The steady and transient-state emission was also employed to illuminate the charge separation. A broad steady-state emission band of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 covering the emission region of both CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 is observed (Fig. 7a). From the broad emission, we could see that the intensity belonging to CsPbBr3 was greatly reduced, but the one originating from g-C3N4 decreased slightly. These results indicate that electron transfer may take place between g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3. Moreover, the decrease in different regions from g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3 made the emission of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 looking like a little blue shift contrast to bare CsPbBr3. The energy transfer between CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 (as the emitting light of g-C3N4 could be absorbed) may be a possible reason for the shift. The lifetime of different samples is displayed in Table S1.† The average lifetime of CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 is 243.62 and 7.65 ns, respectively. Comparing with the lifetime of CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4, the average lifetime of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 is lower than that of CsPbBr3 and higher than that of g-C3N4. These results unambiguously imply that some excited electrons undergo migration between g-C3N4 and CsPbBr3.

2.9. Photocatalytic test
Considering the merits of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4, activity of this composite material toward the photocatalytic CO2 reduction was investigated. Under the irradiation of simulated sunlight of 12 h and CO2 saturated organic reagent, the catalytic ability of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 was investigated. To clearly understand the photocatalytic ability of the composite material, control experiments with CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 as the catalyst were also carried out. Considering the effect of solvent on the catalytic activity, three kinds of solvents with moderate polarity, namely, ethyl acetate, toluene and hexane were selected as the reaction solvent. The reduction products of CO and CH4 were detected and the results are presented in Fig. 8a. CO was the main product with toluene and hexane as solvents. When ethyl acetate was used as the solvent, CH4 was obtained as the main product, and the yield was more than 10-fold that of CO. In addition, the total amount of the reductive product in the ethyl acetate system was 4-fold higher than that in toluene and hexane. The result probably originated from the larger polarity and easier proton-donating property of ethyl acetate than those of toluene and hexane. Therefore, the following reactions were performed with ethyl acetate as the solvent.
 Fig. 8  (a) Yield of the CO2 reduction products using CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 as the photocatalyst under irradiation for 12 h with different organic reagents (AM1.5); (b) yield of CO and CH4 of CO2 reduction using different samples with ethyl acetate under irradiation for 12 h (AM 1.5). 
As shown in Fig. 8b, with CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 (5 mg) as the photocatalyst and ethyl acetate (6 mL) as the solvent, the production of CO and CH4 was 25 and 274 μmol g−1, respectively. The high yield of CH4 may result from the trapping of electrons in the composite CsPbBr3@g-C3N4.43,44 The control experiment with g-C3N4 (5 mg) and CsPbBr3 (1 mg) as catalysts exhibits around 48 and 74 μmol g−1 generation of total reductive products, respectively. The activity was around 5-fold lower than that of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4, implying that the composite structure efficiently enhanced the CO2 reduction efficiency. The efficient charge separation may account for the enhanced reactivity of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4. The stability of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 was measured, and the results indicated that within three cycles (36 h) the generation of CO was slightly enhanced, but CH4 underwent a sharp decrease (Fig. 9b). The XRD patterns (Fig. S5†) of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 after catalysis indicated the poor stability of CsPbBr3 in the composite. The collapse of the structure may be the main reason for the obvious decrease in the CH4 yield.

Owing to the absorption band ranging from 480 to 510 nm (Fig. 5) in CsPbBr3@g-C3N4, the photocatalyst was also tested under the irradiation of visible light. With a 420 nm cutoff filter (Fig. 9a), the production of CO and CH4 was 28 and 79 μmol g−1, respectively. The yield of CH4 was ∼3.5-fold lower than that obtained using AM1.5 filter.
To confirm the carbon source of the reaction product, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was conducted in a 13CO2 atmosphere with CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 as the photocatalyst (Fig. S6†). The result of isotopic experiments indicates that about 85% of CO and 89% of CH4 comes from 13CO2 photoreduction. The other CO and CH4 may come from the decomposition of ethyl acetate and the surface of CsPbBr3 ligands.
When the reaction was conducted in a diluted CO2 atmosphere (11% CO2/Ar, Fig. 10), the system with CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 (5 mg) as the catalyst still maintains relatively high activity and the total amount was up to 105 μmol g−1 under 12 h irradiation (AM1.5). The reductive capability of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 under low carbon dioxide pressure made it a promising candidate for practical applications in CO2 photoreduction.45

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the fabrication of CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 by introducing orthorhombic CsPbBr3 into g-C3N4and the composite was employed as a catalyst for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. By comparing the yield of photocatalyst in three different solvents under the condition of AM1.5 simulated light irradiation for 12 hours, ethyl acetate selected as the solvent for photoreduction CO2. CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 could convert CO2 into a C1 compound including CO and CH4 with the amount of 25 and 274 μmol g−1, respectively, and the selectivity to CH4 was up to 91%. This activity is 6-fold more than that by pure g-C3N4. The CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 catalyst remained active after irradiation for 36 h. Studies of energy band level and steady-state and transient photoluminescence spectroscopy indicated that the incorporation of CsPbBr3 and g-C3N4 increases charge separation, which may result in sharply enhanced catalytic efficiency. Under visible light irradiation, CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 also shows reductive activity. When the CO2 concentration was decreased to 11%, a yield of 85 and 20 μmol g−1 of CH4 and CO were achieved, respectively, indicating that CsPbBr3@g-C3N4 could be an active CO2 reduction catalyst under low concentrations of CO2. This work may provide a feasible path for CsPbBr3 to be used in CO2 photoreduction.
