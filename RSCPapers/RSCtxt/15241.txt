    , Accepted 25th December 2021First published on 27th December 2021AbstractZr-doped In2O3 thin films are prepared on FTO substrates by a two-step method: firstly, Zr-doped In(OH)3 thin films are hydrothermally deposited, and then converted to Zr-doped In2O3 films by heat treatment. It is found that during the phase transition from Zr-doped In(OH)3 to Zr-doped In2O3, the cuboid-like crystal grains will fragment, resulting in a large number of new surfaces and cracks. Zr doping can introduce shallow impurity levels in the band gap of In2O3, which will enhance the absorption of incident light. The substitution of trivalent In3+ ions by tetravalent Zr4+ ions provides additional donors for In2O3, which reduces the charge transfer resistance of the photoelectrochemical water oxidation and thus improves the charge transfer kinetics. These factors synergistically improve the photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance of Zr-doped In2O3. For example, at a potential of 1.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, the photocurrent density of the Zr-doped In2O3 electrode during photoelectrochemical water splitting can be as high as about 3.5 times that of the undoped In2O3. Furthermore, Zr doping will also cause changes in the nucleation of some In(OH)3 grains, resulting in the formation of a small number of rod-bundle-shaped grains.
Introduction
Energy shortage and environmental pollution have become major problems that need to be solved urgently in the development of human society. Looking for green and renewable energy to replace fossil fuels is one of the solutions to the above problems. As an energy carrier, hydrogen has the characteristics of being ‘green’ and having high calorific value, so it has received widespread attention.1 At present, there are two main technologies for commercial production of hydrogen: electrolysis of water, and natural gas steam reforming.2 However, the former consumes a lot of electricity, has high cost and low efficiency, and thus is not suitable for large-scale applications,3,4 while the latter relies on non-renewable fossil fuels and causes a large amount of carbon emissions.5 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting uses solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The process is green and sustainable, so it is considered an ideal solution to energy and environmental problems.6 However, so far the efficiency of the process is still very low. The efficiency of PEC water splitting mainly depends on the semiconductor electrode material, in which the incident light is absorbed to generated electrons and holes, that is, photogenerated electrons and holes.7 Taking the half-reaction of water oxidation as an example, holes are transported to the n-type semiconductor/electrolyte interface to oxidize the water to obtain oxygen, while the electrons are collected by the substrate, and then reach the counter electrode through the external circuit to reduce water to obtain hydrogen.5,8 Therefore, exploring advanced semiconductor materials is the key to obtaining high-performance PEC water splitting.
Indium oxide (In2O3) is an n-type semiconductor material with a band gap of 2.0–3.6 eV.9–11 It has many advantages, such as high stability in alkali electrolyte, high conductivity and suitable band edge for water oxidation, and so on, which make it a very promising photoanode material for PEC water splitting.12 However, the charge carrier recombination rate of In2O3 is relatively high, resulting in its photocatalytic effect not reaching expectation.13 Therefore, great efforts have been made to improve the charge separation efficiency of In2O3. Strategies such as making In2O3–In2S3 herterojunctions, element doping and nanostructuring have been reported to improve the charge separation efficiency of In2O3. For example, Xu et al.,14 Sharma et al.15 and Li et al.16 reported the preparation of In2O3–In2S3 herterojunctions for PEC water oxidation, which, compared with the In2O3 single component, all showed enhanced charge separation efficiency. Gan and co-workers reported the N-doped In2O3 using indium-based MOF material as a precursor and found that the interstitial N doping could improve the charge separation of the In2O3.12 Sun et al. prepared Mn-doped In2O3 by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering and obtained improved PEC water oxidation performance in comparison with the undoped In2O3.17 Meng and co-workers studied the PEC water oxidation performance of In2O3 cubes and nanowires that were prepared by chemical vapor deposition method.18,19 These studies provide important scientific reference for improving the PEC performance of In2O3, but there are still some deficiencies, such as using expensive and/or non-environmentally friendly reagents and complex and harsh preparation processes. For heterojunction configurations, sometimes the interface between the junctions not only cannot promote charge separation, but can even become the recombination center of charge carriers.20 In our previous study, we had successfully grown In2O3 nanowalls and nanotowers on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and conducted the PEC water oxidation using them as photoanodes.21 Although these In2O3 nanostructures exhibit good PEC performance, they have the disadvantage of complicated and time-consuming preparation processes. In comparison, the doping strategy to improve the PEC performance of In2O3 is relatively simple and low cost. Among many In2O3 dopants, Zr4+ ion is the one that is not reported much. However, Zr4+ ions have a radius of 0.72 Å, which is smaller than that of In3+ ions (0.80 Å), so they can easily enter the In2O3 lattice and partially replace In3+ ions. The introduction of Zr4+ ions into In2O3 will not only provide more donors to increase the conductivity of In2O3, but also produce impurity energy levels in the band gap of In2O3 to reduce the recombination of photogenerated carriers, thus synergistically improving the PEC performance of In2O3.22–25
In this study, we report the Zr-doped In2O3 films that is composed of crystal grains with abundant fracture surfaces and cracks. The films are prepared by a two-step method: Zr-doped In(OH)3 films are first deposited on the FTO substrates and then converted into Zr-doped In2O3 films by heat treatment. The effects of Zr doping on the electronic structure of In2O3 are discussed. When used as photoanodes for PEC water splitting, the effects of Zr doping on the incident light absorption and interface charge transfer properties of In2O3 are also discussed. The abundant crystal grain fracture surfaces and cracks and the positive effects caused by Zr doping synergistically improve the PEC performance the In2O3 films. It is expected that such Zr-doped In2O3 films can provide a useful platform for in-depth study of the photocatalytic properties of oxide semiconductors.
Experimental
Materials
Indium(III) chloride tetrahydrate (InCl3·4H2O) was purchased from Shaoguan Jinyuan Co., Ltd. The urea (CO(NH2)2) and dichlorooxozirconium (ZrOCl2·8H2O) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) was purchased from Yantai Far East Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was purchased from Laiyang Kangde Chemical Co., Ltd. All chemicals are of analytical grade and are used as received without further purification. Glass slides coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) (Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co) are used as the substrates to prepare the target films.
Preparation of Zr-doped In2O3 films
Zr-doped In2O3 films on FTO substrates were prepared by a two-step method: a hydrothermal reaction process was firstly used to prepared the Zr-doped In(OH)3 films and then a heat treatment was employed to convert them to Zr-doped In2O3 films. Before the hydrothermal reaction, FTO substrates with a size of 2 × 2.5 cm2 were soaked in a mixed solution of H2SO4 and H2O2 (the volume ratio of H2SO4 to H2O2 is 3:1) for 8 h, and then washed with deionized water three times and ethanol three times and dried. In a typical preparation for Zr-doped In(OH)3 film, 0.22 g InCl3·4H2O, 0.14 g CO(NH2)2 and a certain amount of ZrOCl2·8H2O were dissolved in 15 mL deionized water to obtain a reaction solution. Afterward, the reaction solution was poured into a stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon liner with a capacity of 25 mL and then a piece of FTO substrate was placed into the autoclave at an angle against the wall of the Teflon liner, with the conductive side facing down. At a setting temperature, the hydrothermal reaction was carried out for a setting time. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the autoclave was opened and the sample film grown on the FTO substrates was taken out. After washing with deionized water three times and drying in air, the Zr-doped In(OH)3 film was obtained. In the second step, the Zr-doped In(OH)3 film was heat treated at 450 °C for 90 min to convert to Zr-doped In2O3 film. In order to obtain different samples, the molar percentage of Zr4+ ions in the reaction solution, x% (molar ratio of Zr4+ ions to the sum of Zr4+ ions and In3+ ions), varied from 0 to 20%. For convenience, the obtained Zr-doped In(OH)3 films and Zr-doped In2O3 films are expressed as x%-Zr–In(OH)3 and x%-Zr–In2O3, respectively. In addition, different hydrothermal reaction conditions including temperature (100 °C, 110 °C, 120 °C, 140 °C, 160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C) and time (4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h and 12 h) were also employed to obtain different samples.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation) at room temperature while the voltage and electric current were held at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses of the samples were performed using a FEI Quanta FEG 250 environmental scanning electron microscope combined with energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectroscopy. A JEM-2100 (JEOL) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV was used to analyze the fine structure of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an ESCALAB 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα X-ray radiation as the X-ray source for excitation. UV-Vis absorption spectra referenced to BaSO4 were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 plus UV-VIS-NIR Spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Due to the strong mirror reflection of the resultant films grown on FTO glass slides, powder samples prepared at the same conditions were used to test the reflective UV-Vis spectra.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
The light source is provided by a 500 W xenon arc lamp (AuLight, CEL-S500). The simulated solar illumination was obtained by passing the light through an AM1.5G filter (AuLight, PD-250 CEL-AM 1.5) and calibrating the output to one sun (100 mW cm−2) using a power meter (Thorlabs, PM100 USB) with an S302C detector. The PEC measurements were performed on a Bio-Logic SAS potentiostat (SP-150) with a typical three-electrode configuration, where the working electrode was prepared Zr–In2O3 films, the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl), and the counter electrode was a Pt wire. The electrolyte was 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. The potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation (1): ERHE = E(vs. reference) + E(reference) + 0.059 pH(1)where ERHE is the converted potential vs. RHE; E(vs. reference) is the experimentally measured potential against the reference electrode; and E(reference) is the potential of the reference electrode (Ag/AgCl, 0.1976 V in saturated KCl solution at 25 °C). Incident photon-to-charge conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in the same setup described above at a potential of 1.23 V (vs. RHE), using the monochromatic light (Zolix monochromator, Omni-λ 3005) as the light source. The intensity of the monochromatic light was calibrated using a power meter (Thorlabs, PM100USB) coupled with a Si photodiode detector (Thorlabs, S120VC).
Results and discussion
Zr-doped In2O3 films were grown on FTO substrates by a hydrothermal method. The crystal structures of the hydrothermal samples and the heat-treated samples were confirmed by XRD. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of two example hydrothermal samples: one is the undoped In(OH)3 and the other is 14.5%-Zr–In(OH)3. For comparison purposes, the XRD pattern of the FTO substrate and the standard XRD lines of cubic In(OH)3 (JCPDS 16-0161) are also provided in Fig. 1a. As can be seen, if the diffraction peaks that originated from the FTO substrate are removed, the XRD patterns of both hydrothermal products agree well with that of the standard cubic In(OH)3, confirming that the films on the FTO substrate formed during the hydrothermal reaction possess cubic-In(OH)3-related crystal phase. The reason why 14.5%-Zr–In(OH)3 sample is used as an example to illustrate the XRD result of Zr doping is that, in the later study, it was found that the 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 has the best PEC performance and, therefore, in the following discussion, 14.5%-Zr–In(OH)3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 samples are mainly used as representatives. After being heat treated at 450 °C, the crystal phases of the films were further studied by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1b, the XRD patterns of both samples which underwent heat treatment match well the cubic In2O3 (JCPDS 65-3170) shown at bottom, indicating that heat treatment can easily convert the cubic In(OH)3 phase to cubic In2O3 phase. These XRD results do confirm the crystal phases of the as-prepared films and their heat-treated products; however, they do not show any results on successfully introducing Zr into In(OH)3 or not. It is speculated that, on the one hand, Zr is indeed successfully doped into the lattice of In(OH)3 during the hydrothermal process, because later studies have proved that Zr-doped samples do have a significant improvement in PEC performance compared to the undoped samples. On the other hand, the quantity of the Zr ions that enter into the lattice of In(OH)3/In2O3 would be low, otherwise there should be perceptible changes in the XRD patterns of the latter, which will be discussed later.

The morphology and fine structures of the prepared films were studied by using SEM. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the undoped In(OH)3 and 14.5%-Zr–In(OH)3 and their heat-treated products. As can be seen from Fig. 2a, the undoped In(OH)3 film is composed of cuboids of different sizes, each of which has six smooth surfaces and is dense. After Zr doping, however, as shown in Fig. 2b, in addition to the cuboids that are similar to the undoped In(OH)3, the film also contains a certain number of rod bundles, which are composed of nanorods with a radius of ∼2.8 μm and a length of ∼7.1 μm. Repeated experiments confirmed that the rod bundle morphology only occurred when Zr was introduced. This result indicates that the introduction of Zr into the reaction solution affects the nucleation and growth of the In(OH)3, which finally results in the formation of the rod bundles that possess substructures.

After heat treatment, as shown in Fig. 2c, the cuboids of the undoped In(OH)3 have all fractured. During the conversion of In(OH)3 to In2O3, for every mole of In2O3 formation from In(OH)3, three moles of H2O are released, as shown in eqn (2). Such H2O releasing during the heat treatment actually makes it very difficult to maintain the dense cuboid morphology, and thus cracking of the cuboids results. For Zr-doped In(OH)3 films, as shown in Fig. 2d, the same fragmentation phenomenon is observed for the cuboids during the heat treatment. However, for the rod bundles, no obvious morphology change is shown. It is speculated that this substructure contributes to the morphology preservation of the rod bundles: during heat treatment, unlike the case of dense blocks, the released H2O can escape from the microspaces between the nanorods without causing cracking of the bundles, thus achieving morphology preservation. The SEM images with a larger field view of the undoped In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 samples are shown in Fig. S1.† 2In(OH)3 → In2O3 + 3H2O(2)
To confirm the true doping amounts of Zr in doped In2O3 samples, EDS analysis was performed. Fig. 3 shows the SEM image of the 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 film and its EDS mapping images. It can be seen that, in addition to In and O, Zr element is also distributed homogenously in the In2O3 matrix, which indicates that Zr element is successfully introduced into the In2O3 film. The fact that the cuboids and the rod bundles have no obvious difference in element composition means that, although they have different morphologies, they belong to the same substance, which is in good agreement with the XRD results. The EDS measurement also shows that (Table S1†), the actual content of Zr in the 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 sample is ∼2.30 atm%, which is much smaller than the Zr content in the feed, that is, 14.5 atm%, indicating that the actual doping content of Zr is relatively low. Table S1† also lists the actual Zr contents of other samples, which shows similar results to the above, that is, the actual doping amount of Zr is much smaller than the Zr content in the reactant. However, the data in the Table still reveal such a result: changing the content of Zr in the reactant can adjust the actual doping amount of Zr in the product, that is, the Zr content in the product will increase with the increase of Zr feedstock in the reactant. For convenience, in the following discussion, samples are still named according to their Zr feeding contents. The microstructure of the samples were also studied by using TEM. Fig. 4 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of the particle(s) of 14.5%-Zr–In2O3. Fig. 4a shows that the particle is irregular, which is consistent with the results shown by the SEM images. The HRTEM image shown in Fig. 4b reveals the continuous lattice fringes, indicating the single crystal nature of the particles. The shown 0.291 nm interplanar spacing corresponds to the (222) plane of cubic In2O3, which agrees with the XRD results.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further analyze the elements and their chemical states in the In2O3 films. Fig. 5a shows the XPS survey spectrum of the 14.5%-Zr–In2O3. It reveals the signals originated from In, O and Zr elements, indicating that Zr is successfully introduce into the film. Additionally, Sn and C signals are also detected, which come from the FTO substrate and contamination of the vacuum system of the XPS instrument, respectively. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of In 3d shown in Fig. 5b gives two peaks at 444.2 eV and 451.7 eV, which belong to the spin splitting of In3+ 3d electrons in In2O3, that is, In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2, respectively.26 The Zr 3d XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 5c also exhibits two peaks, which occur at 182.5 and 184.8 eV and correspond to the spin–orbit components of Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2, respectively,27 indicating the successful introduction of Zr into the In2O3 film.
 Fig. 5  XPS spectra of the 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 film: (a) survey spectrum, (b) In 3d, (c) Zr 3d, (d) O 1s. 
The O 1s XPS spectrum can be deconvolved into three peaks, as shown in Fig. 5d. The peak at ∼529.5 eV named as OI can be indexed to the In–O–In oxygen bond. The peak at ∼531.0 eV named as OII can be ascribed to oxygen vacancies, which are a common defect in In2O3 and are formed during the transition from In(OH)3 to In2O3 due to the heat treatment. The third peak named as OIII occurs at ∼532.0 eV and can be indexed to loosely bound oxygen species like O2− and –OH.28,29
The absorption properties of Zr-doped In2O3 films were also studied. Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the pure In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 films. As can be seen, the absorption of both the doped and undoped samples occurs at nearly the same region in the UV range, which agrees well with the fact that In2O3 is a wide band gap oxide. However, compared with the undoped sample, the 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 sample not only shows obvious absorption enhancement, but also shows a red shift at the maximum absorption position. The band gap data of the samples can also be extracted from the Tauc's plots that are drawn based on the absorption spectra. Fig. 6b shows the Tauc's plots of the pure In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 films, from which it can be ascertained that the band gaps of the pure In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 samples are 2.76 eV and 2.73 eV, respectively. It means that the introduction of Zr makes the absorption of In2O3 produce a small extension to the visible light region, which may be caused by the formation of a discrete shallow band of the Zr 3d orbital in the forbidden band of In2O3.30 Although the extension of the absorption of In2O3 is small, such an impurity energy level may act as a center for trapping excitons, thereby significantly increasing the absorption of incident light by In2O3, as exhibited in Fig. 6a.

The PEC water oxidation performance of the Zr-doped In2O3 films was studied by using a three-electrode system, in which Pt wire, Ag/AgCl electrode and the prepared Zr-doped In2O3 film on FTO substrate were used as counter electrode, reference electrode and work electrode, respectively. A 0.1 M NaOH solution was used as the electrolyte. The measurements were conducted either in dark conditions or under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 7 shows linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the Zr-doped In2O3 samples. For comparison, the LSV curve of the undoped In2O3 film is also shown. It can be seen that the undoped In2O3 and Zr-doped In2O3 samples both show obvious PEC water oxidation performance under the illumination of the simulated sunlight, whereas their dark current is almost zero between 0.8–1.8 V. This means that the undoped In2O3 and Zr-doped In2O3 are good semiconductor materials for PEC water oxidation and they can efficiently separate the photogenerated charges and transport the holes to the semiconductor/electrolyte interface to conduct water oxidation. It should be noted that the LSV curves of the precursor films, that is, the Zr-doped In(OH)3, were also measured at the same conditions; however, they did not show detectable photocurrent, indicating that only after the precursor films are converted into Zr–In2O3 films can they play the role of an oxide semiconductor electrode for PEC water splitting (Fig. S2†). From Fig. 7 it can also be seen that the amount of Zr in the reactant has a great influence on the PEC performance. Firstly, compared with the pure In2O3, the Zr-doped In2O3 shows significantly enhanced photocurrent density. Secondly, with the increase of Zr content in the reactant, the photocurrent density of the sample increases first and then decreases. For example, at a potential of 1.5 V, the photocurrent densities of the pure In2O3, 13.5%-Zr–In2O3, 14%-Zr–In2O3, 14.5%-Zr–In2O3, 15%-Zr–In2O3 and 15.5%-Zr–In2O3 are 0.08, 0.17, 0.27, 0.30, 0.29 and 0.28 mA cm−2, respectively. The maximum photocurrent density appears in the sample with 14.5% Zr feedstock, which is ∼3.5 times that of the undoped In2O3. Further experiments revealed that when the Zr content in the reactant was less than 10%, the photocurrent densities of the obtained Zr-doped In2O3 films were lower than that of the undoped In2O3 film, which is shown in Fig. S3.† In addition, for comparison, the data of PEC water splitting of some In2O3-based photoanodes reported in the literature are listed in Table S2.† It can be seen that the photocurrent density of our samples is basically at the average level. We also studied the film's tolerance to PEC tests. As can be seen from Fig. S4 and S5,† SEM images and optical photos show no significant changes in the samples, indicating that the PEC test has no obvious impact on the films.
 Fig. 7  LSV curves of undoped In2O3 and Zr-doped In2O3 measured under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and in dark conditions. 

Fig. 8a shows the chopped LSV curves of the pure In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 samples. It can be seen that both undoped and Zr-doped In2O3 show fast response accompanying the incident light switching, and no obvious transient photocurrent is observed. Transient photocurrent that occurs with light on represents the accumulation of holes at the electrode/electrolyte interface without injection to the electrolyte and, likewise, transient photocurrent occurred with light off, representing the back reaction of electrons from the conduction band with the accumulated holes.31 The absence of significant transient photocurrent in Fig. 8a indicates that the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface is relatively fast for both undoped and Zr-doped In2O3. Fig. 8b shows the time-dependent photocurrent densities of the pure In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 samples at 1.56 V under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. It can be seen that during the 5 h testing, the photocurrent densities of the pure In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 first have a small increase and then remain nearly constant to be 0.10 and 0.36 mA cm−2, respectively. This result indicates that the PEC water oxidation process of pure and Zr-doped In2O3 is quite stable and no obvious degradation of catalytic performance occurs.

To study the PEC efficiency of the samples, applied bias photon to current efficiency (ABPE) was calculated based on their LSV data. Assuming 100% Faraday efficiency, ABPE can be calculated according to eqn (3): (3)where Jlight and Jdark refer to the current density of the synthetic electrode under light and dark conditions, respectively; VRHE refers to the applied potential versus RHE; and Plight refers to the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 8c, the undoped In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 both exhibit the maximum ABPE at 1.07 V, which are 0.007% and 0.023%, respectively. It proves that the Zr doping significantly improves the PEC performance of In2O3. To further study the PEC efficiency of the samples toward incident light of different wavelengths, incident photon-to-charge conversion efficiency (IPCE) was also measured. IPCE is measured using monochromatic light as light source. In other words, it is independent from the light sources and filters used in different laboratories and, therefore, it is more accurate in evaluating the photon absorption and conversion efficiency.32 IPCE can be calculated using eqn (4) (4)where I (in mA cm−2) is the measured photocurrent density under the illumination of a specific wavelength of monochromatic light; λ (in nm) is the wavelength of monochromatic light; and Jlight (in mW cm−2) is the irradiance intensity of the specific wavelength of monochromatic light. Fig. 8d shows the IPCEs of the undoped In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 conducted at 1.23 V. As can be seen, to the 280–425 nm of photons the 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 shows obvious enhanced IPCE in comparison with the undoped In2O3. For example, the highest IPCEs for the undoped In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 all appear at 330 nm, which are 9.9% and 12.5%, respectively.
In order to explore the electrochemical performance of the electrodes, electrochemical impedance analysis was carried out. Fig. 9a shows the Nyquist plots of pure In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 photoanodes measured at a 0.45 V (vs. RHE). A typical Randles’ equivalent circuit model was used to fit the data. As can be seen, the arc radius of the In2O3 photoanode is larger than that of 14.5%-Zr–In2O3. The fitted data, shown in Table S3,† also reveals that the charge transfer resistances, Rct, of pure In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 are 4364 and 2885 Ω cm2, respectively. At the same time, the series resistance, Rs, of the 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 sample is 28.27 Ω cm2, which is slightly lower than that of the undoped In2O3 sample of 31.21 Ω cm2. These results indicate that Zr doping not only accelerates the charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface but also enhances the charge transport in the bulk of the semiconductor. It is believed that, on the one hand, Zr doping produces defects in In2O3 lattice, leading to enhanced light absorption, and, on the other hand, the substitution of some trivalent In3+ ions with tetravalent Zr4+ ions provides additional donors in the In2O3 lattice, which will reduce the charge transfer resistance and charge transfer resistance conductivity of In2O3. To confirm this, Mott–Schottky plots of the undoped In2O3 and Zr-doped In2O3 samples were measured. Fig. 9b shows the results of pure In2O3 and 14.5%-Zr–In2O3, from which it can be seen that the two samples both show a positive slope with increased anodic bias, agreeing with the fact that In2O3 is an n-type semiconductor. Table S4† lists the flat-band potential and donor density data of the samples calculated according to the Mott–Schottky plots. It can be seen that the flat-band potential is not changed significantly after Zr doping, but the donor density increases from 3.60 × 1021 to 10.88 × 1021 cm−3, which is about a two-fold increase.

As discussed above, in this work, Zr–In(OH)3 was first prepared and then heat treated to transform it into photocatalytically active Zr–In2O3. In this case, we also studied the effects of hydrothermal reaction conditions and heat treatment conditions on the PEC performance of the Zr–In2O3 samples. First, the hydrothermal reaction temperature was investigated. Fig. 10a shows the LSV curves of 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 samples, which were obtained by heat treatment of the 14.5%-Zr–In(OH)3 precursor films that were obtained by reacting at different temperatures for 6 h. It shows that, as the hydrothermal reaction temperature increases, the PEC performance of the obtained Zr–In2O3 first increases and then decreases, and the best PEC performance appears in the sample with a hydrothermal reaction temperature of 120 °C. For example, at 1.5 V, the photocurrent densities of the 100 °C-, 110 °C-, 120 °C-, 140 °C-, 160 °C-, 180 °C- and 200 °C-samples are 0.17, 0.24, 0.32, 0.25, 0.22, 0.23 and 0.15 mA cm−2, respectively. At the same time, it was also found that when the hydrothermal reaction temperature is lower than 90 °C, there is no obvious film formation on the FTO substrates. Secondly, keeping the hydrothermal reaction temperature constant, the effects of reaction time on the PEC performance of the final Zr–In2O3 samples was studied. Fig. 10b shows the LSV curves of the 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 samples whose precursor films, that is, Zr–In(OH)3 films, were prepared by reacting at 120 °C for different times. It shows that, similar to the effect of the reaction temperature, as the hydrothermal reaction time increases, the PEC performance also first increases and then decreases. The sample with the best PEC performance is the one with a reaction time of 6 h. Thirdly, the influence of the heating rate of heat treatment on the PEC performance of Zr–In2O3 was studied. As shown in Fig. 10c, a slow heating rate has a positive effect on the improvement of the PEC performance of the obtained Zr–In2O3.
 Fig. 10  LSV curves measured under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 of 14.5%-Zr–In2O3 samples obtained by heat treating: (a) 14.5%-Zr–In(OH)3 precursor samples prepared at different temperatures for 6 h, (b) 14.5%-Zr–In(OH)3 precursor samples prepared at 120 °C for different times, (c) 14.5%-Zr–In(OH)3 precursor samples prepared at 120 °C for 6 h with different heat treatment rate. 
The above results indicate that both the hydrothermal reaction conditions and the heat treatment conditions do affect the PEC performance of the Zr–In2O3. It is believed that the hydrothermal reaction conditions will affect the properties of the film, such as thickness, crystal size, etc. The fact that obvious film growth can only be seen when the hydrothermal reaction temperature is higher than 90 °C also illustrates this point. Of course, if the reaction temperature is high enough to cause the thin film to grow too dense, it may cause the specific surface area of the film to decrease and, as a result, the PEC performance of the final obtained Zr–In2O3 would decrease. The reason for the effect of hydrothermal reaction time on PEC performance of the Zr–In2O3 films is similar. Additionally, from the SEM images that are shown in Fig. 2 it can be seen that a large number of new fracture surfaces appear in the obtained In2O3 during the phase transition which occurred in the heat treatment. It is known that, although both In(OH)3 and In2O3 belong to the cubic crystal system, their unit cell sizes are quite different. In addition, the Zr–In(OH)3 cuboids prepared in this work are relatively large, reaching the micron level. These characteristics cause the transformation of Zr–In(OH)3 to Zr–In2O3 to fail to maintain the morphology, and grain breakage will occur. In this case, we speculate that the slow heating rate will make the stress release during the fracture process of large grains tend to be gentle, which will result in more cracks and smaller grains in the phase transition products. This trend can be roughly seen in Fig. S6,† where the fragmentation degree of the sample with a heating rate of 0.5 °C min−1 is slightly higher than that of the sample with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. In this case, the Zr–In2O3 sample obtained with a slow heating rate will have more fresh surface exposure, which is conducive to the PEC water oxidation, because the efficiency of this behavior is proportional to the area of the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.
Conclusions
In summary, Zr-doped In2O3 films were prepared by a two-step method: Zr-doped In(OH)3 films were firstly hydrothermally grown on FTO substrates and then heat treated to transform them into Zr-doped In2O3 films. The heat treatment results in the formation of a large number of fracture surfaces and cracks of Zr-doped In2O3 crystal grains, which provide a broader place for PEC water oxidation reaction that relies on the area of the semiconductor/electrolyte. When used as photoanodes for PEC water splitting, at 1.5 V versus RHE, the Zr-doped In2O3 exhibited a photocurrent density as high as ∼3.5 times that of the undoped In2O3. It was found that Zr doping not only improves the film's absorption of incident light but also reduces the interface charge transfer resistance, thereby significantly improving its PEC performance. In addition, Zr doping can also induce the nucleation of some In(OH)3 grains to be different from that of most grains, resulting in the formation of a small amount of rod-shaped particle aggregates, the subject of ongoing investigations in our laboratory.
