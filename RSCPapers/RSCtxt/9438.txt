    , Accepted 28th November 2018First published on 29th November 2018AbstractAn inorganic caesium cation was incorporated into perovskite to improve the performance and stability of solar cells with a hole-transport-material free structure in ambient air. A triple cation device with a champion power conversion efficiency of over 15% was achieved, exhibiting superior thermal, long-term and operational stabilities.
Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted enormous attention due to their great light harvesting properties, low manipulation cost and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), which presently exceeded 23%.1–7 However, challenges including thermal and illumination instability as well as moisture sensitivity still remain and in turn hinder their commercialization.8,9 Thus, many efforts have been devoted to achieving PSCs with high performance and great stability.6,10–12
Recently, use of mixed-cation perovskite materials was proved to be a feasible route to achieve high-performance PSCs with superior stabilities.12,13 Due to the inferior performance of pure methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) and formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) with poor light harvesting properties and an impure yellow δ-phase, they were mixed together to fabricate PSCs with high performance and purity of a black perovskite α-phase.14,15 The recent success of the synthesis of MAFA based PSCs demonstrates that combining different cations together can both provide advantages and avoid drawbacks. Despite MAFA based PSCs achieving a PCE of 23.2%, they are still sensitive to processing conditions owing to their intrinsic structural and thermal instability.6 In principle, alloying with larger cations, FA (2.79 Å), would enhance the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) value, affecting the instability of a cubic phase. Recently, smaller cations (caesium (Cs); rubidium (Rb) or potassium (K)) were incorporated into MAFA perovskite to improve the performance and stability of PSCs by tailoring the t value and improving the purity of the cubic phase.4,12,16,17 However, the requirements of unstable organic hole transport materials and the rigorous fabrication process in a glove box in conventional PSCs make it impossible to be commercialized. Since no work has been reported on fully air-processed caesium(Cs)MAFA PSCs without hole conductors so far, we do this research on it.
Here in this work, efficient and stable mesoporous PSCs with a simple structure of FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/carbon were fabricated in ambient air (with a humidity of about 50%).18,19 We adopted a one-step anti-solvent method of MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 with Cs incorporation to synthesize high quality perovskite films. CsMAFA based perovskite films exhibit relatively bigger grain size, greater light harvesting properties, longer carrier lifetime and slightly larger bandgaps compared to a MAFA analogue, resulting in the improvement of PCE exceeding 15% in the corresponding device. Moreover, Cs doped PSCs show superior thermal-stability with PCEs retaining 90% of their initial performance after 100 hours of thermal stress at a temperature of 80 °C and a humidity of about 50%. In addition, our PSCs also present good long-term stability with PCEs of over 14% after 10 days of storage in air.
CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 was applied as a light absorber in PSCs due to a suitable bandgap of about 1.57 eV.20,21Scheme 1 depicts the schematic diagram of the carbon-PSC configuration with triple cation CsMAFA perovskites.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the triple cation based C-PSC configuration. 
The surface morphologies of perovskite films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as shown in Fig. 1(a). A perovskite film with a homogeneous surface and larger grain size was obtained by the incorporation of Cs in MA0.7FA0.3PbI3. It could be easily inferred that the perovskite film with larger crystal grains has reduced grain boundaries, which is beneficial for the interface contact and carrier transport between the perovskite and carbon electrode. We checked the performance of devices based on CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 with different amounts of Cs, and found that the optimal concentration was 5%. Fig. 1(b) compares the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 (MAFA) and Cs0.05(MA0.7FA0.3)0.95PbI3 (CsMAFA) based devices. Their corresponding photovoltaic parameters of open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and PCE are listed in Table 1. The FF of the CsMAFA based device was enhanced to 64.5%, higher than that of the MAFA based one of 63.0%. This can be mainly ascribed to the better contact and reduced trap density at the perovskite/carbon interface caused by the improved film quality. The JSC was increased from 22.84 to 23.38 mA cm−2 by Cs incorporation due to the promoted carrier transport and suppressed recombination caused by the reduced grain boundaries. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and integrating current curves of the corresponding devices are depicted in Fig. 1(c). Both devices exhibit a wide range of photocurrent responses, while CsMAFA based PSCs show relatively higher EQE values in a long wavelength range, consistent with the higher JSC of the Cs containing device. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) was performed to investigate charge transport and recombination kinetics in our devices. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the Nyquist plots of MAFA and CsMAFA based devices show two semicircles. The results were fitted by a simplified equivalent circuit model as shown in the inset. The semicircle in the low frequency range can be attributed to the transfer resistance (Rtr), while the semicircle in the high frequency range can be attributed to the recombination resistance (Rrec).

It is obvious that the Rtr value was significantly decreased with Cs doping, resulting in a faster charge transfer of photogenerated electrons from perovskite to functional layers. Moreover, higher Rrec was obtained by the incorporation of Cs, indicating a reduced charge recombination rate. The lower Rtr and higher Rrec could be responsible for the greater performance of Cs-doped devices. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was investigated to determine the element distribution of two perovskite films with or without Cs. As depicted in Fig. 2(d), there are no obvious differences between the XPS results of survey, C 1s, N 1s, Pb 4f and I 3d core level spectra of two perovskite films with or without Cs. However, a marked Cs 3d core level spectrum appeared for CsMAFA perovskite films, indicating the successful incorporation of Cs in the perovskite lattice substituting MA/FA cations.

To further confirm the influence of Cs intercalated into the MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 perovskite lattice, devices based on CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 films with different x values were systematically investigated by photoelectronic tests. Fig. 2(a) exhibits the absorbance spectra of CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 (0 ≤ X ≤ 0.15) films. A slight blue shift of the absorption edge was observed by Cs doping, indicating the increased bandgap of the corresponding perovskite. Similarly, a minor blue shift of a photoluminescence (PL) emission peak was also found in the normalized PL spectra as shown in Fig. 2(b). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed to investigate the carrier dynamics and recombination behavior in CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 based PSCs (Fig. 2(c)). The carrier lifetimes of 345, 527, 348 and 73 ns were obtained for CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 perovskite films with X = 0, 5%, 10% and 15%, respectively. The perovskite film with 5% has the longest carrier lifetime, which can be ascribed to less grain boundaries and improved crystallinity, resulting in suppressed non-radiative recombination and improved charge transport. Fig. 2(d) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra results of CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 perovskite films. It is obvious that all scattering patterns present similar peaks, meaning that all of these materials have a similar crystalline lattice of a typical perovskite system. Nevertheless, an impure PbI2 peak (2θ = 12.7°) could be observed for the perovskite film without Cs, while indistinguishable from the Cs-doped perovskite film, confirming the higher purity of perovskite films with Cs incorporation.
Photovoltaic experiments were conducted to systematically investigate the effect of Cs on the performance of CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 based devices. Here, x varies from 0 to 0.15. The J–V curves of CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 based devices with various x values are presented in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†). The statistics of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE are shown in Fig. S2(b) and summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 based PSCs show an average VOC of 937 ± 32 mV, a JSC of 22.80 ± 0.52 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.95 ± 1.72%, yielding an average PCE of 13.45 ± 0.56%. The VOC reaches a maximum value of 956 ± 21 mV at 15% Cs doping due to the increased bandgap with Cs incorporation, which is in accordance with the slight blue-shifts of the absorption edge and PL peaks. However, the highest average PCE of 14.08 ± 0.51% was obtained by 5% incorporation owing to the highest JSC of 23.61 ± 0.46 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.00 ± 2.90%. This can be mainly attributed to the high quality of perovskite films with 5% Cs incorporation, resulting in promoted carrier transport, lower electron–hole recombination and optimized interface contact between perovskite and carbon. However, with a higher loading of Cs, about 10% and 15%, the bond length mismatch became dominant in the perovskite lattice due to the difference in the ionic radius among Cs+, FA+ and MA+, leading to impure phases and more traps in the corresponding films. Therefore the JSC and FF of PSCs decrease when the Cs content is over 5%. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the EQE curves of devices with different Cs contents. With the increase of Cs, the absorption edge exhibits a minor blue-shift, indicating an increased bandgap of the corresponding perovskite, consistent with the blue shift observed in the absorbance onset and PL peaks. Moreover, the CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 based devices with X = 0.05 and 0.10 exhibit higher absorbance in a long wavelength region, thus beneficial for current enhancement in the corresponding devices.
The photovoltaic performance of the champion device with a 5% Cs incorporation perovskite absorber is shown in Fig. 3. This cell exhibits the best PCE of 15.06% with a VOC of 986 mV, a JSC of 23.23 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.8%. Fig. 3(b) depicts the EQE spectrum and integrating current curves of 22.41 mA cm−2, in good agreement with the JSC value achieved from the J–V curve. Furthermore, the J–V curves under different scan speeds were examined (Fig. 3(c)). The performance remains almost the same irrespective of the sweep rate. The hysteresis behavior of the devices was investigated by J–V curves measured under reverse and forward voltage scans with a sweep speed of 50 mV s−1, as provided in Fig. S4 (ESI†). This PSC exhibits a VOC of 957 (943) mV, a JSC of 22.84 (22.66) mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.8 (62.8)%, yielding a PCE of 15.03 (13.43)%, when measured under reverse (forward) voltage scans. Finally, we checked the stability of Cs-doped C-PSCs against illumination, thermal stress and long-term endurance. As shown in Fig. 3(d) and Fig. S5(a) (ESI†), the unencapsulated device with Cs incorporation presents a stabilized current density of 17.5 mA cm−2 at a maximum power output point (voltage = 0.75 V) under continuous operation for 400 s, yielding a stabilized power output of 13.1%. However, an obvious decay of current density and PCE was observed in the Cs-free device with an inferior PCE of 12.3% and a current density of 16.4 mA cm−2. The temporal evolution of the normalized PCEs of unencapsulated devices under thermal stress at 80 °C is depicted in Fig. 3(e) and Fig. S5(b) (ESI†). It is observed that PCE of a CsMAFA based device still retained 90% of the initial value after 100 hours, which is better than that of the Cs-free based device of 73% of the original value, suggesting the improved thermal stability with Cs doping. Fig. 3(f) and Fig. S5(c) (ESI†) show the performance evolution of unencapsulated devices stored in an ambient environment at room temperature with a humidity of about 50% for different times. The PCE of a Cs-free based device declined significantly after 6 days. However, due to the protection of a carbon electrode, the performance decay of the Cs-free based device was very slow. The protecting function of the carbon electrode can be seen in our previous work.19 With Cs doping, PSCs show no obvious performance drop with a PCE of over 14% after 10 days demonstrating the outstanding stability.

(f) Long-term stability of the unencapsulated PSCs in ambient air (temperature ≈ 30 °C, humidity ≈ 50%). 
In summary, we fabricated highly efficient and stable HTM-free C-PSCs with CsX(MA0.7FA0.3)1−XPbI3 perovskite materials in ambient air with a humidity of about 50%. The incorporation of Cs results in high quality perovskite films with larger grain sizes, less grain boundaries and reduced trap density, consequently leading to high performance PSCs. The champion cell with 5% Cs incorporation has the best PCE of over 15%. Meanwhile, the Cs0.05(MA0.7FA0.3)0.95PbI3 based device presents superior stabilities against illumination, thermal stress and long-term endurance.
