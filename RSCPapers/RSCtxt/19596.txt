    , Accepted 15th June 2011First published on 3rd August 2011AbstractThe preparation of low energy gap carbazole based main-chain polymers having improved open circuit voltages (Voc) and solubility is described. Poly[9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl-alt-(5,6-bis(octyloxy)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)-5,5-diyl] P1 and poly[9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl-alt-(5,6-bis(octyloxy)-4,7-di(2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)-5,5-diyl] P2 were prepared in good yields using Suzuki coupling methodologies. The polymers were characterized by NMR spectroscopy; UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and their molecular weights were estimated using gel permeation chromatography. Introduction of octyloxy substituents on the benzothiadiazole acceptor repeat units on polymers P1 and P2 enhances their solubility compared to the polymer PCDTBT and alters their electronic and photophysical properties. Investigation of the photovoltaic properties of the two new polymers side by side with those of PCDTBT in bulk heterojunction cells using PC70BM as a molecular acceptor indicated that both polymers provide higher Voc values than that of PCDTBT (0.96 and 0.90 V for P1 and P2 respectively vs. 0.82 V for PCDTBT) and good power conversion efficiencies with PCE values of 4.22 and 4.12% respectively for P1 and P2 and a PCE of 4.30% for PCDTBT.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells based on blends of conjugated polymer donors and molecular acceptors often referred to as bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells are attracting a great deal of interest. These systems have potential technological value due to their ease of fabrication and their relatively low production costs. While different molecular acceptors have been used in these systems, fullerene derivatives have attracted the greatest research interest and enabled devices to be produced that have good solar PCEs.1 Low energy gap polymers with alternating donor–acceptor repeat units have attracted much interest as electron donors to fullerene derivatives in these systems. These systems are primarily designed to absorb a wider portion of the electromagnetic solar spectrum, however, if there is a mismatch between the HOMO and LUMO levels of the electron donating polymers and the fullerene acceptors, low power conversion efficiencies are obtained.2
Polymers which comprise benzothiadiazole electron accepting repeat units have attracted a particular interest.3 Good power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been achieved from a range of alternating copolymers which include the benzothiadiazole repeat unit.4–6
Carbazole based low energy gap polymers have also received much attention for use in BHJ solar cells.7 PV devices with a titanium oxide optical spacer using fullerenes and PCDTBT, a low energy gap alternating carbazole based copolymer comprising benzothiadiazole units with two neighboring thiophene rings, provided a PCE of 6.1%.8HXS-1, another polymer which comprises alternating carbazole repeat units with linear N-alkyl substituents and benzothiadiazole repeat units with octyloxy substituents and two neighboring thiophene rings, was reported recently.9 The polymer is highly planar and more crystalline than PCDTBT and while it provided devices with good PCEs, it had low solubility and could only be processed in solution at high temperatures. A number of factors could influence the efficiency of devices using PCDTBT. For example, it was shown that the variation in the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of the polymer from around 10 kDa to 22 kDa could provide PV devices with PCEs between 2.26 and 4.15% when using PCBM as an acceptor with the polymer at 19 kDa providing the best performance.10 Other studies have shown that the active layer thickness can also affect the PV PCEs of devices using PCDTBT.11 It is clear that the control of the molecular weights of these polymers and their solubility in organic solvents has a direct effect on the morphology and the thickness of the active layers they could produce.
In this work, we report the preparation of novel highly processable donor–acceptor polymers comprising alternating carbazole repeat units and benzothiadiazole with alkoxy substituents with two neighboring thiophene or bithiophene units. The electronic, photophysical and photovoltaic properties of the new materials are analyzed and contrasted to those of PCDTBT.
Results and discussion
Processability of conjugated polymers is most important for their application in devices. While we are able to produce BHJ PV devices using PCDTBT and PC70BM with PCEs up to 4.3%, the solutions used for spin-coating the active layers to generate these devices have to be heated prior to their use since polymer aggregates are formed at the concentrations required at room temperature. We have therefore sought to investigate the preparation of derivatives of this class of polymer with improved solubility in order to allow a better processability at room temperature. Introduction of alkyl or alkoxy substituents to the polymer backbone is a well recognised method to improve the solubility of conjugated polymers. However, the steric bulk of the newly introduced substituents and consequences on the planarity of polymer chains and their electronic delocalisation have to be taken into account in the design of such materials. Introduction of linear alkoxy substituents on the benzothiadiazole repeat units offered the best solution in order to avoid a large decrease in the electronic conjugation of PCDTBT. It was shown that such an approach has provided carbazole based materials with similar electronic conjugation to PCDTBT with an alternating carbazole polymer HXS-1, containing linear N-alkyl substituents and benzothiadiazole repeat units with octyloxy substituents and two neighboring thiophene rings.9 However, HXS-1 was found more crystalline and less soluble than PCDTBT as it has linear rather than branched N-alkyl substituents on its carbazole repeat units as in the case of PCDTBT. We have therefore prepared polymers P1 and P2 in addition to PCDTBT in order to compare their properties.
Polymers P1 and P2 were prepared according to Scheme 1. Reaction of 9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-2,7-bis-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole 1 with 4,7-bis-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis-octyloxy-benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole 2 or 4,7-bis-(5′-bromo-[2,2′]bithiophenyl-5-yl)-5,6-bis-octyloxy-benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole 3 using Suzuki type reaction conditions afforded respectively polymers P1 and P2 in good yields. While both monomers 1 and 2 are known, monomer 3 was obtained upon reacting 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and [2,2′]bithiopheny-5-yl-tributyl-stannane in a Stille type reaction to obtain 4,7-di(2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy) benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole in a first stage, followed by bromination of the product on reaction with NBS to afford 3 in good yields. PCDTBT was prepared according to established literature procedures.12

Gel permeation chromatography measurements from the polymerization reactions (using polystyrene standards) have shown weight average molecular weight values Mw ranging from 32600 to 57200 Da (Table 1) with polydispersity index values ranging from 1.45 to 2.37. The improved solubility of polymers P1 and P2versus that of PCDTBT was apparent in their workup and separation as they were mostly extracted in the toluene fraction upon their Soxhlet extraction, while PCDTBT could only be extracted from the chloroform fraction of the Soxhlet extraction with little polymer extracted from its toluene fraction.

Solution and solid-state electronic spectra
Absorption spectra of polymers P1 and P2 as well as that of PCDTBT both in chloroform solutions and as thin films are shown in Fig. 1. The polymers have absorption maxima between 513 and 547 nm in solution and between 536 and 570 nm in the solid state (Table 1). Comparison of the absorption maxima of polymer P1 with that of PCDTBT indicates a blue shift of its absorption by about 34 nm in both chloroform solutions and in films. The optical energy gap of polymer P1 as measured from the onset of its absorption in films also indicates a higher value than that of PCDTBT (1.98 for P1vs. 1.88 eV for PCDTBT). The octyloxy substituents on the benzothiadiazole repeat units in P1 clearly affect its electronic delocalization. This increase in the energy gap of polymer P1 is probably not due exclusively to steric effects. Indeed the electron donating properties of the octyloxy substituents attached to benzothiadiazole repeat units could also reduce their electron accepting properties and the intramolecular charge transfer along the polymer backbone on P1 increasing its energy gap. It is noteworthy that polymer HXS-1 which also has octyloxy substituents on its benzothiadiazole repeat units but n-octyl substituents rather than 9-heptadecanyl substituents on P1 has absorption maxima at about 525 nm in chloroform solutions and 579 nm in films.

The absorption maxima of polymer P2 which has bithiophene repeat units separating the carbazole and benzothiadiazole repeat units along its polymer backbone are at 542 and 548 nm in chloroform solutions and thin-films respectively. The optical energy gap of P2 is around 1.93 eV (Table 1). Electronic delocalization is clearly more pronounced on P2 compared to that on P1. This is probably due to both steric and electronic factors as the introduction of extra thiophene repeat units increases the electron donating ability of the electron donating repeat units along the polymer backbone and consequently increases the intramolecular charge transfer along the polymer backbone. Furthermore the distance separating the solubilising substituents along the polymer backbone is also further increased, reducing their mutual steric interactions. It is also interesting to note that the red shift in the absorption of P2 is less pronounced between its chloroform solutions and its films when compared to that of polymer P1 and PCDTBT (6 nm for P2 compared to 23 nm for P1 and 23 nm for PCDTBT) indicating little structural differences of the polymer in solutions and in films.
Electrochemical studies
Investigations of the electrochemical properties of polymers P1 and P2 were undertaken and the properties of the two polymers compared to those of PCDTBT. Cyclic voltammetry measurements on drop-cast polymer films were conducted in acetonitrile with tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as an electrolyte. The cyclic voltammograms of the polymers are shown in Fig. 2. The redox potentials of the various polymers as well as their respective HOMO and LUMO levels (vs. vacuum) are shown in Table 2.

All potentials were measured against the Ag/Ag+ reference couple. Polymer P1 shows a reversible oxidation wave and two reduction waves. A comparison of the oxidation potential of polymer P1 to that of PCDTBT under the same conditions indicates a higher oxidation potential for polymer P1 compared to PCDTBT (0.79 vs. 0.62 V). The reduction potentials of P1 are also to higher negative potentials than those of PCDTBT (−1.49 and −1.75 V for P1vs. −1.32 and −1.62 V for PCDTBT). The values of the HOMO and LUMO levels (vs. vacuum) of P1 as determined from the onset of its oxidation and reduction waves are at −5.40 and −3.27 eV respectively (on the basis that ferrocene/ferrocenium is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level13). The higher oxidation potential of P1 and its deeper HOMO level when compared to PCDTBT could be due to reduced electronic delocalisation along the polymer backbone. The higher LUMO value of P1 when compared to that of PCDTBT is probably explained by a weakening of the electron accepting ability of benzothiadiazole moieties on P1 upon their substitution with electron releasing octyloxy substituents. Polymer P2 shows a reversible oxidation wave at 0.78 V and two less well defined reduction waves at −1.43 and −1.73 V. The HOMO and LUMO levels (vs. vacuum) of P2 as determined from the onset of its oxidation and reduction waves are at −5.20 and −3.29 eV respectively. The shallower HOMO level of P2 relative to that of P1 and PCDTBT is again most likely explained by the presence of more electron donating thiophene repeat units along its polymer backbone. The LUMO level of polymer P2 is comparable to that of P1 but is deeper than that of PCDTBT (Table 2), a result consistent with a weakening of the electron accepting ability of benzothiadiazole moieties on P2 upon their substitution with electron releasing octyloxy substituents. The electrochemical energy gaps of the three polymers (Table 2) are in close agreement to their optical energy gap deduced from the absorption spectra.
Polymer solubility and thin-film forming properties
To explore the solubility of polymers P1, P2 and PCDTBT, each polymer was dissolved in chloroform at a range of concentrations. Relative solubility was then determined by eye by looking for macroscopic aggregates (undissolved polymer) in the solution and by assessing the clarity or turbidness of the solution. Each solution was also passed through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter to determine the extent of undissolved polymeric material. To complement these studies, the solubility of each polymer was also assessed when mixed with 95% purity PC70BM in a weight ratio of 1:4 polymer:PC70BM.
We find that polymer PCDTBT formed a turbid solution when dissolved in chloroform at a concentration of 2 mg ml−1. It also formed aggregates in solution at a concentration of 5 mg ml−1 and formed a gelatinous solution at 20 mg ml−1. Polymer P2 formed a turbid solution at all concentrations investigated, however undissolved aggregates were not observed even at a concentration of 20 mg ml−1. Polymer P1 solutions were only turbid at a concentrations in excess of 5 mg ml−1, and again did not form polymer-aggregates at concentrations even at 20 mg ml−1. From the onset of the formation of a turbid solution, we estimate that the solubility limit of PCDTBT and P2 in chloroform is ∼1 mg ml−1, whilst P1 has a significantly enhanced solubility in chloroform estimated to be ∼20 mg ml−1. When filtering solutions, PCDTBT could be passed through a 0.45 μm membrane filter at a concentration of 1 mg ml−1 without blocking filter pores. P2 tended to block the filter at similar concentrations, whilst P1 solutions could be easily filtered at concentrations in excess of 10 mg ml−1. This general behavior is illustrated in Fig. 3 where we show an optical image of solutions of PCDTBT, P1 and P2 at concentrations of 5, 10 and 20 mg ml−1 in chloroform. The relative insolubility and the aggregate forming character of PCDTBT are clearly evident.
 Fig. 3  Polymer only solutions at various concentrations. 
When each of the polymers were mixed with PC70BM, we find that their apparent solubility in chloroform increases remarkably (by up to 20 times). Using the same criteria to judge solubility limits, we assess the solubility of PCDTBT to be ∼50 mg ml−1, P2 to be ∼20 mg ml−1 and P1 to be in significant excess of 50 mg ml−1. Indeed, we were not able to fully assess the solubility limit of a P1:PC70BM blend due to limited available material. Our results suggest therefore that the addition of side-chains to the benzothiadiazole moiety in polymer P1 results in a significant increase in solubility over that of PCDTBT. This promising result suggests that this modification will be useful when fabricating thin films using processes that require more viscous or high-concentration low boiling-point solutions to be utilized. Polymer P2 had a similar solubility to that of PCDTBT, however unlike PCDTBT it did not apparently form insoluble aggregates. Here, the inclusion of the two bithiophene groups is likely to be responsible for this effect, as these groups do not have solubilising side-groups as is typically used in polymers such as poly(3-hexylthiophene). We anticipate that without the solubilising side-groups on the benzothiadiazole on polymer P2, it would most likely be insoluble in chloroform. It is clear from our studies that the presence of the PC70BM results in a large increase in the overall solubility of each of the polymers studied. This result indicates that the PC70BM is able to fill spaces around each of the polymers in solution and thereby aid their solubilization.
We have also explored the film-forming capability of the three different polymers. Here, each polymer was dissolved in a solvent (either dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene or chloroform) at a concentration of 4 mg ml−1 along with PC70BM to obtain an overall solid concentration of 20 mg ml−1. Each resultant solution was then spin-cast at 1000 rpm with the thickness of the resultant thin film being measured using a Dektak surface profiler. We find that for each material the resultant film thickness increases as the solvent-volatility is increased. In particular, when cast from dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene and chloroform, the 1:4 PCDTBT:PC70BM thin film had a thickness of 45, 85 and 125 nm respectively. When cast from the same range of solvents, a 1:4 blend of P1:PC70BM had a thickness of 50, 65 and 95 nm, whilst a P2 fullerene blend created thin films having a thickness of 65, 70 and 110 nm when cast under the same set of conditions. The relative similarity in the thicknesses of the resultant films is not particularly surprising as the majority of the material deposited in each case is PC70BM. It is clear however that in general P2:PC70BM films are slightly thicker than P1:PC70BM films. This may indicate a difference in viscosity of the two materials, perhaps related to their different solubility. More work is however required to characterize the viscosity of the different polymer–fullerene inks explored here.
Photovoltaic device characterization
Photovoltaic measurements were made on a series of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Ca/Al devices using blends of polymers:PC70BM in weight/weight ratios from 1:2 to 1:4. The results of these studies are outlined in Table 3 and the J–V characteristics of the best devices are shown in Fig. 4.

 Fig. 4  
J–V characteristics of the best ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Ca/Al PV devices of P1 (solid line), P2 (dashed dotted line) and PCDTBT (dashed line). 
Our studies reveal that the optimum devices were those in which weight/weight ratios of polymers:PC70BM of 1:4 were used. The influence of solvents used to cast the active layers was also investigated. Chloroform was found as the best solvent to use for both P2 and PCDTBT while chlorobenzene gave the best results for polymer P1. Annealing of devices is an important factor in controlling the morphology of the polymer/fullerene blends in the active layer of PV devices as a result of phase-separation and self-assembly of polymer chains and crystallization of the fullerene dopants that increases charge mobility and facilitates charge extraction. Thermal annealing a BHJ blend above its glass transition temperature can also improve device efficiency by removing residual casting solvent.14 Devices were therefore annealed at different temperatures for set periods of time and their performance was compared. PCDTBT displayed the best results when devices were annealed at 80 °C while polymers P1 and P2 provided the best power conversion efficiencies when devices were annealed at 120 and 110 °C respectively.
A comparison of the performance of the best devices from the three polymers indicates that all materials achieved good power conversion efficiencies with PCEs of 4.22, 4.12 and 4.30% respectively for polymers P1, P2 and PCDTBT. Devices using polymer P1 displayed high open circuit voltages with values of Voc up to 0.96 V (Table 3) which compare very favorably with devices using PCDTBT for which the highest Voc observed was 0.82 V. The highest Voc values obtained using polymer P1 could be explained by its deeper HOMO level when compared to that of PCDTBT. The short-circuit current densities (JSC) for devices using polymer P1 were also relatively higher than those obtained from devices using PCDTBT. However, the fill-factor (FF) values from devices using polymer P1 were lower than those from PCDTBT (46.9% for polymer P1vs. 61.8% for PCDTBT for the best devices). This suggests that charge transport and extraction from devices using polymer P1 might be less efficient than in the case of devices using PCDTBT perhaps as a result the formation of a micro/nanostructure that effects efficient exciton dissociation and extraction of photo-generated electrons and holes.
Devices using polymer P2 also displayed high open circuit voltages with values of Voc up to 0.90 V (Table 3) for the best device. This value is higher than the Voc value obtained from devices using PCDTBT for which the highest Voc observed was 0.82 V. The higher Voc value for P2 is unexpected given its shallower HOMO level when compared to that of PCDTBT (−5.20 eV for P1vs. −5.35 eV for PCDTBT).
The short-circuit current densities (JSC) for devices using polymer P2 were slightly lower than those obtained from devices using P1 and PCDTBT although fill-factors of devices using P2 were slightly higher than those from devices using P1 (54.2% for polymer P2vs. 46.9% for polymer P1) indicating slightly better charge extraction from devices using P2. However, the FF values of P2 are still lower than those obtained from the best devices using PCDTBT (61.8%) indicating better charge transport and extraction from devices using PCDTBT. It is possible that the additional solubilising groups on polymers P1 and P2 may reduce charge carrier mobility in these materials as compared to PCDTBT, as a higher fraction of the material is non-conjugated. Reduced mobility may limit the efficiency of charge-carrier extraction, resulting in reduced fill-factors. Future work will address the optimum molecular weight and processing-conditions of these materials to maximize charge-carrier mobility and the efficient formation of percolation-pathways to further increase device efficiency.

9-(Heptadecan-9-yl)-2,7-bis-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole 1,12 4,7-bis-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole 4,15PCDTBT,12 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole,16 [2,2′]bithiophenyl-5-yl-tributyl-stannane17 and 4,7-bis-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis-octyloxy-benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole 2 (ref. 9) were prepared according to literature procedures. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was distilled over sodium-benzophenone under inert nitrogen atmosphere. Toluene was dried and distilled over sodium under an inert argon atmosphere. Acetonitrile (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade) was dried and distilled over phosphorus pentoxide under an inert argon atmosphere, then stored over molecular sieves, 3 Å.
Measurements
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker 250 MHz, AMX400 400 MHz or DRX500 500 MHz NMR spectrometer at 22 °C in chloroform-d solutions with TMS as the internal standard. Polymer solutions in THF at room temperature for polymer P1 or in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 100 °C for polymers P2 and PCDTBT were used as samples for GPC analysis. The GPC curves were obtained by the RI-detection method, which was calibrated with a series of polystyrene narrow standards (Polymer Laboratories). Elemental analyses were carried out by the Perkin Elmer 2400 CHN Elemental Analyzer for CHN analysis and by the Schöniger oxygen flask combustion method for anion analysis. UV-Visible absorption spectra were measured by a Hitachi U-2010 Double Beam UV/Visible Spectrophotometer. The absorbance of polymers was measured in solution in chloroform (spectrophotometric grade) at ambient temperature using rectangular quartz cuvettes (light path length = 10 mm) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Samples of pristine polymer thin films for UV-Visible absorption spectra measurements were prepared by dip coating quartz plates into 1 mg cm−3 polymer solutions in chloroform (HPLC grade); and the measurements were carried out at ambient temperature. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using a Princeton Applied Research Model 263A Potentiostat/Galvanostat. Measurements were carried out under argon at 25 ± 2 °C. 10 ml of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate solution in acetonitrile (0.1 mol dm−3) was used as the electrolyte solution. A three electrode system was used consisting of an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode (silver wire in 0.01 mol dm−3 silver nitrate solution in the electrolyte solution), a platinum working electrode (2 mm diameter smooth platinum disc, area = 3.14 × 10−2 cm2), and a platinum counter electrode (platinum wire). Polymer thin films were formed by drop casting 1.0 mm3 of polymer solutions in chloroform (HPLC grade) (1 mg cm−3) onto the working electrode, then dried in air. Ferrocene was employed as a reference redox system according to IUPAC's recommendation.18
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated onto pre-patterned ITO glass substrates (20 Ohms per square) that were supplied by Ossila Limited. The protective resist covering the ITO was removed by being placed in a 10% sodium hydroxide solution for 5 minutes. A 20–30 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (HC Starck Clevios P AI4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates that were then transferred to a hot-plate held at a temperature of 125 °C. The coated substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen glovebox where they were given a further thermal annealing treatment at 125 °C for 5 minutes.
We have explored a range of fabrication protocols to optimise the efficiency of devices based on our polymeric materials. In particular, we have explored the role of casting solvent, film thickness, polymer–fullerene ratio and annealing temperature. To fabricate a device, the polymer of interest was dissolved with PC70BM at a relative concentration ranging between 1:2 and 1:4 polymer:PC70BM by mass. In each case, solutions were produced having a concentration of 20 mg ml−1 using the solvents dichlorobenzene (DCB), chlorobenzene (CB) or chloroform. Solutions were heated to 80 °C for 60 hours to fully solubilise both components before being filtered using a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. After the solutions were cooled, they were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO to produce a film having a thickness between 55 nm and 75 nm. To create a device, a cathode consisting of calcium (10 nm) and aluminium (100 nm) was thermally evaporated on top of the active layer in a vacuum of less than 10−6 mbar. Finally, devices were thermally annealed under nitrogen at a temperature ranging between 80 and 130 °C before encapsulation using a UV-curable epoxy and glass slide. To characterise devices, J–V characteristics were recorded when devices were illuminated using a Newport 92251A-1000 AM1.5 solar simulator with NREL certified silicon reference cell.
All reactions were carried out under inert nitrogen or argon atmosphere.

Conclusions
The preparation and characterization of new highly processable low energy gap conjugated polymers consisting of alternating 2,7-linked N-alkyl-carbazole units and 4,7-bis-(thienyl)-5,6-bis-octyloxy-benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole or 4,7-bis-(bithiophenyl)-5,6-bis-octyloxy-benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole have been undertaken. Poly[9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl-alt-(5,6-bis(octyloxy)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)-5,5-diyl] P1 and poly[9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl-alt-(5,6-bis(octyloxy)-4,7-di(2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)-5,5-diyl] P2 were prepared in good yields using Suzuki coupling methodologies. Introduction of octyloxy substituents on the benzothiadiazole repeat units in P1 leads to a slight increase of its energy gap when compared to that of PCDTBT as a result of both steric and electronic effects. The HOMO level of the polymer was found to be deeper than that of PCDTBT while its LUMO level was found to be shallower. Introduction of two additional thiophene units onto the polymer backbone of P2 provided a polymer with enhanced intramolecular charge transfer along polymer chains with a narrower energy gap than that observed for P1 and comparable to that of PCDTBT. The HOMO level of P2 is shallower than that of both P1 and PCDTBT as a result of the electron donating effect of the additional thiophene units along its polymer backbone while its LUMO level is at a comparable energy to that of P1. Relative solution studies of the polymers indicated that polymer P1 had a significantly higher solubility in chloroform than PCDTBT, allowing high concentration solutions (20 mg ml−1) to be created without the formation of insoluble aggregates. Each of the polymers studied were significantly more soluble in chloroform when co-dissolved with PC70BM, indicating that fullerenes are able to disrupt unwanted molecular aggregation in solution. Investigation of the photovoltaic properties of polymers P1, P2 and PCDTBT in bulk heterojunction cells using PC70BM as a molecular acceptor indicated that polymers P1 and P2 provide competitive power conversion efficiencies to those of PCDTBT with PCE values of 4.22 and 4.12% respectively for P1 and P2 compared with a PCE of 4.30% for PCDTBT. PV devices using polymer P1 displayed higher open circuit voltage values than those of PCDTBT as a result of the deeper HOMO level of P1. They also displayed relatively higher short-circuit current density. However, they have lower fill-factor values than those from PCDTBT. PV devices using polymer P2 also displayed higher open circuit voltage values than those of PCDTBT despite the fact that the HOMO level of P2 is shallower than that of PCDTBT. They also displayed slightly lower short-circuit current density (JSC) than those obtained from devices using P1 and PCDTBT. The fill-factor values from devices using P2 were slightly higher than those from devices using P1 but lower than those obtained from the best devices using PCDTBT. Polymers P1 and P2 thus represent an important class of highly efficient carbazole based materials for application in bulk heterojunction solar cells, with polymer P1 being particular promising due to its high open circuit voltage (0.96 V) and its high solubility in chloroform. Further studies are currently ongoing to provide a deeper understanding of the morphology of blends of these polymers with PC70BM in order to further improve their device efficiencies.
