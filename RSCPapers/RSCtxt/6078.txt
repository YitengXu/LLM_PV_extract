    , Accepted 12th January 2016First published on 20th January 2016AbstractTo achieve an overall efficient solar water splitting device, not only the efficiencies of photo-converter and catalyst are decisive, but also their appropriate coupling must be considered. In this report we explore the origin of a voltage loss occurring at the interface between a thin film amorphous silicon tandem cell and the TiO2 corrosion protection layer by means of XPS. We find that the overall device can be disassembled into its primary constituents and that they can be analyzed separately, giving insight into the device structure as a whole. Thus, a series of model experiments were conducted, each representing a part of the complete device. We finally arrive at the conclusion, that the formation of a SiO2 interfacial layer between the TiO2 protection layer and the silicon cell gives rise to the voltage loss observed for the whole device.
1 Introduction
The efficient generation of hydrogen as a an energy carrier by using solar illumination is of eminent current interest, as exemplified by the amount of published works in recent years.1–8 In general two related approaches are followed: (1) the photocatalyst approach, in which the semiconductor is directly involved in charge separation and the water splitting reaction, or (2) the so-called “buried junction” approach, where charge separation is spatially removed from the electrochemical reaction. In reality, usually hybrid approaches have to be employed, i.e. a buried photoelectrode combined with a photocatalyst, because a single electrode does not deliver a sufficient voltage to drive the water splitting reaction.9–12 The same problem is also encountered for buried junction devices, where stacks of multiple buried solar cells are employed to achieve the required voltage.13–16
In our previous work we followed a buried junction approach, by employing silicon multi-junction solar cells for photoelectrochemical water splitting.17–19 The thin-film technology enables the production of potentially cheap solar cells, based on earth-abundant silicon. In contrast to crystalline silicon the amorphous solar cell has a wider band gap, thus delivering a higher photovoltage. Consequently, successful water splitting devices can already be achieved in a tandem structure. However, these cells still suffer from stability problems that make a long-term exposition to strong acidic or basic electrolytes impossible, as can be seen in the stability measurements in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† In order to overcome this drawback we started to investigate different oxidic buffer layers, including zinc-, tin-, aluminum- and titanium oxides. So far, titanium dioxide is best suited as a buffer layer, because of its chemical stability and electronic conductance. It is stable in a broad pH range20 and is used frequently as a passivation layer for semiconductor electrodes.21–23 Besides its chemical protection, TiO2 also shows good electrical passivation properties on crystalline silicon.24 Here, we will present studies on the applicability of sputtered TiO2 layers deposited onto complete silicon tandem solar cells as well as a n-type silicon wafer passivated with a thin SiO2 layer as a model system. Substitution of the well established ZnO/Ag back contact layer of a thin film solar cell will alter the charge transfer properties of the device. Therefore, interface studies were conducted to identify possible barriers within these photoelectrodes.
Additionally to TiO2, Pt was deposited via electrochemical deposition as the co-catalyst onto the TiO2 covered silicon thin film solar cells and onto an ITO substrate. The latter enables us to separate the photoelectrochemical behavior under illumination from the electrocatalytic performance in the dark. Using this approach, the origin of voltage losses can be located and investigated separately. To identify voltage losses due to barrier formation we used a set of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy interface experiments to elucidate the band alignment between the silicon cell and the platinum catalyst with the titania buffer layer.
2 Experimental
For the model experiments n-type silicon (resistivity 6.9 Ω cm) was first cleaned for 15 minutes in Piranha solution (1/3 40% H2O2 and 2/3 concentrated H2SO4). Afterwards the silicon oxide layer was stripped by immersion for 15 minutes in 40% NH4F. The samples were rinsed with water and quickly introduced into the ultra-high vaccum (UHV) system. A defined oxide layer was grown at 800 °C and 0.1 mbar, employing a flux of 50 sccm argon and 50 sccm oxygen for 30 minutes.
The tandem solar cell is built up in a superstrate geometry of two amorphous silicon (a-Si) p–i–n diodes deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Further information can be found here.25 Previous to the titania deposition the tandem solar cell was etched for 5 minutes in 40% NH4F and no oxidation process was conducted.
The sputter deposition of titania and platinum were carried out using two MeiVac 2′′ sputter sources with pure metallic targets (Pt: 99.99%, Scotech Ltd; Ti 99.995%, Kurt J. Lesker Co.). The pressure in the deposition chamber was 3 × 10−2 mbar, while the base pressure was around 5 × 10−8 mbar. In the case of titania deposition the gas flux consisted of 98 sccm argon and 2 sccm oxygen, both with a purity of 5 N. The sputtering power was set to 100 W. On the tandem solar cell a TiO2 layer thickness of 17 nm was achieved after 10 minutes of deposition.
On the Si-wafer model system the stepwise platinum deposition was done with an argon flux of 100 sccm and a sputtering power of 3 W. To avoid environmental contamination all process steps were conducted in an UHV environment with a base pressure below 1 × 10−8 mbar.
In the case of tandem cells, the electrochemical deposition of the platinum catalyst on the TiO2 protective layer was done from a 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.5 mM K2PtCl4 solution (H2SO4: 99.999, Sigma Aldrich; K2PtCl4: MaTeck GmbH). Pt was deposited at a constant current density of −0.5 mA cm−2 under light of a white LED (10 mW cm−2) for 10 minutes. The electrochemical characterization was performed with the same light source in the same cell (PECC-2 from ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & Co. KG) with a Ag/AgCl 3 M NaCl reference electrode also in 0.5 M H2SO4.
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were conducted with monochromatic Al Kα irradiation (XR 50, SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH). A hemispherical electron analyzer (PHOIBOS 150, SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH) was employed, calibrated by core line positions of noble metals (copper, gold and silver) and all binding energies are referenced to the Fermi level. The energy resolution is judged by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Ag 3d3/2 of 0.56 eV. To construct the band diagrams valence band positions were measured by extrapolating the valence band edge and relative shifts during deposition were derived from core level shifts.26
To monitor the thickness of the titania layer we used the dampening of the substrate signal in XPS assuming the formation of a homogeneous closed layer by sputtering.27 Due to the lack of experimental data, we derived the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of the Si 2p electrons in a titania matrix (λ = 2.2 nm) with the algorithm (TPP-2M) published by Tanuma et al.,28 which is integrated within the NIST IMFP Database.29 We further assume that the dominant source of error in thickness determination is the IMFP which is estimated to be about 10% according to the paper of Tanuma et al. As the thickness is determined numerically, error propagation is not easily done and we therefore estimated the margin of error to 10%. For determining the silicon oxide layer thickness the empirical formula from Hill et al. was applied,30 which also has approximately 10% uncertainty.
3 Electrochemical characteristics of the photoelectrode
In order to separate the electrochemical characteristic of a photoelectrode from its photovoltaic performance one can model the overall characteristic as being a result of the two singular contributions connected in series.18 The two essential current–voltage characteristics of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell are depicted in Fig. 1, representing the photo-converter (light) and the catalyst (dark).
 Fig. 1  (a) Photovoltaic characteristic of an a-Si:H/a-Si:H solar cell under illumination with a white light LED. (b) Cyclic voltammogram of ITO/TiO2:Pt in 0.5 M H2SO4 in the dark. 
The photovoltaic characteristic of the studied tandem solar cell under illumination is shown in Fig. 1(a). With the LED light source (10 mW cm−2) the solar cell provides a short circuit current density of 0.9 mA cm−2 and an open circuit potential of 1.70 V, which is theoretically sufficient to start the water splitting reaction. With AM1.5 light conditions this translates to a short current density of 6.4 mA cm−2 and an open circuit potential of 1.8 V (Fig. S2, ESI†). For the solid state photovoltaic measurement this tandem cell is covered with a silver back contact directly deposited on the n-a-Si:H layer by thermal evaporation as a current collector. It is assumed, that the silver layer behaves like a good electronic back contact and preserves the optimal performance of the solar cell.
To model the dark reaction, i.e. the catalytic performance, we deposited electrochemically Pt onto a TiO2 covered ITO substrate using the same conditions as for the solar cell. The cyclic voltammogram after the Pt deposition is shown in Fig. 1(b) with and without correction of the series resistance of the electrode and the electrolyte (14 Ω cm2). The curves show a strong anodic half wave above 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) which is attributed to the hydrogen oxidation reaction on the Pt catalyst. At negative potentials the hydrogen evolution reaction is visible with a steep increase in current. At 1 mA cm−2 an overvoltage of −90 meV is encountered. Hence, the catalytic activity of the electrochemically deposited Pt catalyst should not limit the performance of the photoelectrode with the TiO2 buffer layer, as the tandem cell delivers around 1.5 V at the maximum power point.
In Fig. 2 a schematic of the measurement setup with a tandem cell is depicted. The cell is illuminated from the front through the glass substrate. The solar cell is employed as the working electrode. The photovoltage therefore acts as an additional bias voltage for the water splitting reaction, shifting the HER to more positive potentials.
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of the measurement setup. Working electrode (WE) is the tandem cell modified with TiO2 protective layer and platinum catalyst. RE denotes the reference electrode and CE the platinum wire counter electrode. 
The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the tandem cell with the TiO2 buffer layer and platinum catalyst measured in light and in dark is shown in Fig. 3. The dark measurement shows only a small anodic current onset at 1.5 V vs. RHE, due to the oxygen evolution reaction. Under illumination the photovoltage shifts the HER towards 1.6 V. The redox couple now observable at 1.6 V is due to the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction. Furthermore, a calculated CV curve is included in Fig. 3. The latter was calculated from the photovoltaic characteristic of the tandem cell EPV (Fig. 1(a)) and the CV of the TiO2:Pt cathode EC as measured (Fig. 1(b)) using eqn (1). The underlying assumption is a simple series connection of the photovoltaic converter and the cathode, both having similar current densities j. EPEC(j) = EPV(j) + EC(j)(1)

The effect of the photovoltage from the solar cell can be seen by the shift of the HER to approximately 1.6 V vs. RHE which is in good agreement with the open circuit potential of the tandem cell of 1.7 V. The photo current onset of the measured electrode has a much smaller slope as expected from the calculation. A potential shift of 0.5 V in cathodic direction is visible at a current density of −0.8 mA cm−2. From the electrochemical impedance analysis the series resistance of the ITO substrate alone and with TiO2 differs by less then 4 Ω cm2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. At a current density of −0.8 mA cm−2 a potential drop of 3 mV is calculated with a resistance of 4 Ω cm2, which is in any case too low to explain the shift in Fig. 3. Thus, the shift cannot be explained by an additional ohmic resistance due to the bulk conductivity of the sputtered TiO2. Hence, the origin of the reduced photovoltage must be located at the interfaces between the tandem cell and the TiO2 buffer layer. In order to identify this loss mechanism encountered at the n-a-Si/TiO2 interface, model interface experiments with a n-Si wafer were conducted.
4 Band alignment studies on crystalline Si
TiO2 on silicon

Fig. 4 shows the development of the measured XPS spectra of titania deposited on passivated n-type silicon. The valence band (VB) maximum in the n-Si substrate before deposition of TiO2 is at 0.9 eV. We can therefore conclude that our silicon is sufficiently passivated at the start of the experiment. From the relative intensity the thickness of the silicon oxide is calculated as 1.4 nm at the beginning of the experiment and increases slightly to 1.6 nm upon titania deposition. The low defect density in the Si/SiO2 interface enables us to monitor the energetic alignment of the TiO2 layer, while excluding Fermi level pinning. A fact, that is not necessarily true for the deposition on an amorphous silicon cell. The O1 s spectra show a transition from silicon dioxide to titanium dioxide. Additionally, the stepwise TiO2 deposition can be observed in the increasing Ti 2p and decreasing Si 2p signal, respectively. The initial binding energy of the O 1s line of SiO2 is 533.0 eV, the final value of TiO2 is 530.3 eV. The core level shifts of Si 2p of Si, Si 2p of SiO2, O 1s of SiO2 and Ti 2p are depicted in Fig. 5(a). The shift of the O 1s component assigned to TiO2 is equal to the shift of Ti 2p line. After the first deposition step only a small shift of about 230 meV is visible in the Si substrate signal that decreases to only 140 meV with the final deposition step. In contrast, the O 1s line and the Si 2p oxide component show shifts of up to more than 1 eV within the first deposition steps. The decrease in the binding energy is due to a final state effect in silicon dioxide:31 Upon titania deposition the electron density close to the oxide is greatly increased. This leads to a better shielding of the photo-generated hole in the SiO2 and to a strong decrease in the binding energy. Thus, the improved hole shielding leads to the decrease in binding energy. Therefore, for the construction of a band diagram the strong change in the SiO2 component of the O 1s level is disregarded. The Ti 2p signal shows at first a shift to lower binding energies and finally reaches the typical value for TiO2 of 458.71 eV. We assume, that the negative shift at the beginning of the deposition is due to small nanoclusters of TiO2 deposited at low coverages, that often show higher binding energies.32–34 This is a result of the changed chemical environment (surface atoms vs. bulk atoms) as well as a final state contribution due to insufficient screening of the core hole. The reversal of the binding energy trend is correlated to the formation of bulk like TiO2, which implies the formation of oxygen vacancies that lead to the typical n-doping observed for TiO2.35 The valence band spectra show a clear transition from n-Si/SiO2 to TiO2 which manifests in the emissions of the O 2p and O 2p/Ti 3d hybridization states between 4 and 8 eV binding energy.36 The valence band offset of 2.9 eV of titania was taken from the VB spectrum after the last deposition step.

 Fig. 5  (a) Change in the Si 2p, O 1s and Ti 2p core line upon TiO2 deposition on passivated n-type silicon and (b) the resulting band diagram. ΔCB and ΔVB denote the conduction and valence band offset between silicon and TiO2, respectively and eVbb the band bending in the silicon. 
Knowledge of the band gap of the deposited TiO2 layer is necessary in order to construct a band line-up of the interface. TiO2 exists in different morphologies which feature various band gap energies. In XPS a distance between the Ti 2p and the valence band maximum (VBM) of 456.0 eV for anatase and 456.4 eV for rutile have been found.37 In our spectra we find the distance to be 455.84 eV, indicating that neither phase is present. Consequently, gracing incidence XRD measurements have been conducted to clarify the crystallinity. No peaks are visible in the diffractograms (Fig. S3 in ESI†). Hence, the crystallinity of the TiO2 layer is low and its structure is expected to be mostly amorphous. A band gap of 3.2–3.8 eV is observed for amorphous TiO2.38–40 For the construction of the band line-up in Fig. 5(b) a band gap of 3.2 eV is assumed. Given the valence band offset of 2.9 eV our TiO2 layer is clearly n-type. However, as has been deduced in previous experiments also hole conducting amorphous TiO2 can be formed.41 The defect states responsible for this conduction mechanism are situated close to the Fermi level within the band gap of TiO2. In our case no such states are visible in this area, we therefore solely rely on the electron conduction mechanism, which is also necessary to drive the HER.

Fig. 5(b) shows the final band alignment between silicon and the titania layer. From the shift in the Si 2p line a small band bending of 140 mV can be deduced for silicon. This band bending is also present in the conduction band, which can be calculated from the silicon valance band by adding the band gap EG of 1.12 eV.42 The important property for electron transfer from the substrate (Si) to the buffer layer (TiO2) is the energetic difference in the conduction band, i.e. the conduction band offset ΔCB. In this case, there is only the tunneling barrier through the SiO2 layer, because ΔCB between silicon and titania is only 0.06 eV and the conduction bands are therefore well matched. Watanabe et al. also prepared a hetero-contact of TiO2 to crystalline p- and n-type silicon. In the case of n-Si they also see well matched conduction bands and no photovoltage under illumination.43 With p-Si they obtained a working solar cell, while taking care not to introduce an interfacial SiO2 layer. They attribute the photovoltaic performance to the built-in potential between p-Si and n-TiO2. We see the good photovoltaic characteristic of their hetero-contact as a proof for the fast transfer of photogenerated electrons to the TiO2 layer which proves an appropriate conduction band alignment between TiO2 and Si. Furthermore, our experiments give a similar band lineup as obtained by Fulton et al.44 They deposited TiO2via subsequent electron beam evaporation of Ti and oxidation steps, and they observe a flat band situation in the n-Si. The small band bending observed here is probably related to sputter damages in the SiO2 passivation layer on the silicon, which induces some defect states in the interface. Giudice et al. deposited metallic titanium on a cleaved silicon wafer and observed a formation of a titanium silicide phase.45 Interestingly, they determined a similar shift in the Si 2p despite the fact, that they deposited titanium in an oxide free environment.
In all our measurements we find an excess of oxygen on our sample that is most likely a result of an adsorbed O2− species. The same species is most probably also responsible for a strong increase in the work function of our sample during deposition without additional band bending effects.
Platinum on TiO2
The second important charge transfer mechanism is the one across the TiO2–Pt interface. The experimentally obtained XPS data are displayed in Fig. 6. There is no trend visible in the O1 s and the Ti 2p core level emission, except for the last O 1s scan which shows residual oxygen as the sample was stored overnight in UHV. They scatter within 100 meV, but no distinct band bending can be observed. The Pt 4f line is shifted from a high binding energy (72.4 eV) down to the bulk value of 71.2 eV.46 We attribute this trend in binding energy shift to a modified final state screening induced by the electrophilicity of the TiO2 substrate as well as to the particle size effect. The valence band reveals that within the first two depositions, platinum is not yet in its metallic state. A fact that is clearly visible as a lack of density of states around the Fermi level. Overall the interface formation resembles the contact between two metals, which is to be expected considering the typically high charge carrier density in TiO2 (≈1018 cm−3) and the high concentration of defects states of amorphous TiO2.47 However, there remains a 300 meV conduction band offset between platinum and TiO2, a clear indication that the TiO2 is not strong enough n-doped yet.

5 Band alignment studies on tandem solar cell
TiO2 on tandem solar cell
The XPS spectra of the interface formation of TiO2 on the a-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem cell is depicted in Fig. 7. All spectra exhibit a shift to lower binding energies which originates from the photovoltage of the solar cell in the range of 1–2 eV induced by the X-ray source. Therefore the exact position of the Fermi level at the interface is not known a priori. Nevertheless relative binding energy values like core level shifts and band offsets can be compared to the interface experiment on n-Si.
 Fig. 7  Raw spectra of the interface formation between a-Si:H/a-Si:H-TiO2. The TiO2 layer thickness is indicated in the O 1s spectra. 
The core level shifts shown in Fig. 8(a) are similar to the ones observed for n-Si. The band offset of a-Si:H to TiO2 differs slightly from the other interface due to the increased band gap of the a-Si:H layer which is assumed to be 1.9 eV (see Fig. 8(b)).48 The offset in the conduction band is higher, but it remains favorable for electrons crossing from the tandem solar cell to the buffer layer. Although the Fermi level position is not accessible in this experiment, in n-doped amorphous silicon it is usually located 0.2 eV below the conduction band minimum.49 Hence, only a small band bending is expected to exist in the a-Si:H layer. As observed in the model experiment on crystalline silicon, a barrier for the electron transport is not expected for the a-Si:H/TiO2 interface. However, during the TiO2 deposition the growth of the silicon oxide intermediate layer is enhanced. When the deposition is finished a 2 nm SiO2 layer is found in-between the titania and the tandem cell (obtained by the element/oxide-ratio of the Si 2p lines30). This implies that a tunneling process through the silicon dioxide is hindered and a barrier arises due to this intermediate layer.
 Fig. 8  Change in the Si 2p, O 1s and Ti 2p core line upon TiO2 deposition on a-Si:H/a-Si:H (a) and the resulting band diagram (b), including the subsequent deposited Pt co-catalyst layer. 
Pt deposition on tandem cell
The XPS measurement of the tandem cell after the electrochemical deposition of Pt is shown in Fig. 9. A SEM image of the electrodeposited platinum can be found within the ESI† in Fig. S4. In the valence band spectrum the X-ray induced photovoltage of the tandem cell is clearly visible by the signal of the Pt Fermi edge shifted by 1 eV above 0 eV binding energy. When correcting the binding energy scale by the Fermi edge, the Pt 4f line is shifted to 71.14 eV which is in accordance to the position in metallic Pt.50 The Ti 2p line is situated at 459.26 eV after this correction. From this a valence band offset of 3.2 eV is derived, meaning that the TiO2 layer is strongly n-type. Hence, the contact formation of the electrochemically deposited Pt to the TiO2 is alike to the situation in the experiment with the n-Si substrate. However, in this case the thicker TiO2 is more strongly n-doped and consequently no potential loss is present between TiO2 and platinum. For this reason the expected band energy alignment was already added to Fig. 8(b).

6 Summary and conclusion
The a-Si:H/a-Si:H photoelectrodes with TiO2 as a buffer layer and Pt catalyst show a lower photovoltage with regard to the expected electrochemical behavior as can be deduced from the photovoltaic characteristic and the electrocatalytic properties of TiO2:Pt.
Interface experiments on crystalline n-Si substrates as a model system show a favorable band alignment of the n-Si/TiO2/Pt interfaces for electron transport from the semiconductor into the electrolyte. Due to the passivation with a thermal SiO2 layer, pinning can be excluded in this model experiment.
The investigation of the interface of the TiO2 buffer layer on the a-Si:H/a-Si:H photoelectrodes exhibits the same band formation as in the model experiment on n-Si. However, a significant growth of a SiO2 intermediate layer is observed during deposition of TiO2. A layer thickness of 2 nm can be estimated from the XPS measurements. Such a thick silicon oxide layer is expected to prevent tunneling of charge carriers and gives rise to a series resistance in the semiconductor/buffer-layer interface.51,52 Hence, the reduced photovoltage of the photoelectrodes with the TiO2 is caused presumably by this SiO2 interface layer.
The minor growth of the SiO2 layer on the crystalline wafer can be explained by the excellent passivation property of the thermal oxide layer.53 The attack of molecular oxygen radicals formed during the sputter deposition of TiO2 will effect the highly defective oxide layer on the amorphous silicon more than the thermally passivated layer on the n-Si single crystal surface. Unfortunately, a thermal oxide cannot be applied on the amorphous silicon photoelectrodes due to the low temperature tolerance of the solar cell structure. In further studies other strategies to reduce the thickness of the SiO2 have to be applied to improve the properties of the photoelectrodes. This can be accomplished by an adaption of the deposition parameters, especially by adjusting the oxygen content in the sputter atmosphere at the beginning of the deposition. Seger et al. applied a thin metallic titanium layer before the TiO2 deposition on crystalline silicon electrodes and achieved reasonable contact properties.22,54 This could be one approach to suppress the formation of the thick interfacial SiO2 layer. Alternative deposition techniques as atomic layer deposition may also help to control the intermediately formed SiO2 oxide layer thickness.
