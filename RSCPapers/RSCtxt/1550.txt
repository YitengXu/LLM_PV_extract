    , Accepted 26th April 2018First published on 27th April 2018AbstractA novel conjugated terpolymer referred to as Ter-3MTTPD was successfully synthesized using 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene as a donor and methyl thiophene-3-carboxylate (3MT) and 5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD) as acceptor units to investigate the effects of the terpolymer structure on the optical and electrochemical properties. The performance of an all-polymer solar cell (all-PSC) was comprehensively examined by blending the terpolymer with 2,7-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-4-(selenophen-2-yl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone (NDI-Se). The as-cast blend film of Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.66% in the all-PSC. This was further supported by the results of time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) in Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se blend film states which yielded the highest PL quenching efficiency (90%) resulting from the shortest average lifetime, τave of ∼67 ps, much smaller than those of the two binary copolymer blend films (e.g., τave = 194 ps and 149 ps, respectively, for Co-3MT:NDI-Se and Co-TPD:NDI-Se). In addition, for an as-cast blend film of Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se in the active layer, the shelf-life (∼1000 h) of the all-PSC under ambient conditions was found to be much better compared to those of PSCs based on the other two binary copolymers, Co-3MT and Co-TPD.
Introduction
Recently, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) composed of an electron donor polymer and electron acceptor molecules such as fullerene derivatives or non-fullerene molecules have been extensively studied, and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been improved to 13%.1–4
Meanwhile, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) fabricated from π-conjugated donor and acceptor polymers are of great interest because of the tunability of their energy level, improved light absorption compared to fullerene-based PSCs, and the stability of device performance. Moreover, compared to fullerene- and non-fullerene-based devices, all-PSCs offer additional merits of high morphological stability, superior mechanical properties, and suitability as polymer-based viscous ink for fabrication techniques based on solution printing.5–8
Although all-PSCs present many advantages as mentioned above, their PCEs are still relatively lower than those of other PSCs because it is difficult to control of the miscibility and favorable molecular weight of polymers. In addition, most n-type conjugated polymers have been designed and synthesized with limited use of perylene diimide (PDI) or naphthalene diimide (NDI) acceptor units.9–12 However, these polymers exhibit low molar extinction coefficients and it is difficult to control their energy levels and absorption ranges as compared to p-type polymers. For these reasons, the external quantum efficiency of PSCs is highly dependent on the absorption properties of the p-type polymers.13–15
Among the various p-type polymers, thienopyrroledione (TPD)-based copolymers have been studied for applying in all-PSCs due to their relatively simple synthetic procedures, symmetric and planar structures, and medium electron-withdrawing properties of the TPD unit. Additionally, TPD-based conjugated copolymers have a relatively lower-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) than other p-type conjugated copolymers, which is favorable for achieving a high open circuit voltage (Voc) and better air stability in the corresponding all-PSCs. For this reason, the TPD-based PSC system has been well characterized in earlier studies.16–20
However, it has been observed that the TPD polymer has high crystallinity owing to intermolecular interactions and a relatively large surface roughness of the blend film with acceptor materials. Moreover, its absorption spectrum is mainly overlapped with that of NDI-based n-type copolymers. Ma et al. fabricated all-PSCs using three different TPD-based polymers by mixing the N2200 acceptor. For this, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added to improve the morphology of the blend film. As a result, all-PSCs produced in their study provided high power conversion efficiency (PCE ∼ 4.35%).21
Obtaining such an optimal BHJ-type blend film morphology is known to be an important factor in achieving efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in PSCs. Controlling the morphology of the BHJ-type blend film of all-PSC is a challenging task. This is because mixing two different polymers results in poor miscibility due to a small entropy gain.22,23 In particular, the miscibility of the donor and acceptor polymers in the blend film should be carefully controlled to improve the Jsc and fill factor (FF) of an all-PSC. Thus, different approaches have been attempted, including solvent treatment, thermal annealing, addition of solvent, changing the molecular weight of the polymer, and varying the chemical structure of the polymer.24
Among various approaches, specific terpolymer systems have been proposed to improve the morphology, leading to a relatively high PCE. In previous studies, solar cells fabricated with conjugated terpolymers exhibited unique properties of the BHJ, resulting in high Jsc of the PSC. They also exhibited precisely tuned optical and electrochemical properties such as HOMO/LUMO energy levels and absorption spectra.25–27 Therefore, TPD-based terpolymers with a third monomeric unit can also allow control over the complementary absorption behavior and aid in achieving a favorable morphology when mixed with the NDI-based polymer.
In this work, we synthesized a conjugated donor terpolymer, Ter-3MTTPD, by introducing TPD-based repeating units and studied its fundamental properties. By combining the 3MT moiety with a large bandgap as a repeating unit in the terpolymer backbone, the absorption range could be controlled precisely. Thus, Ter-3MTTPD exhibits a blue-shift of the absorption spectrum relative to those of conventional Co-TPD polymers and absorbs over a broader range of wavelengths compared to the individual binary copolymers. In terms of morphology, a blend film of Ter-3MTTPD and NDI-Se exhibited a relatively smooth surface and fine internal morphology. The terpolymer, Ter-3MTTPD, showed excellent film forming ability compared to the binary copolymers (e.g., Co-3MT and Co-TPD), and the BHJ-type all-PSC based on it provided a maximum efficiency of 7.66%. In addition, when the blend film of Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se was used in the active layer of the PSC, it showed an excellent shelf-life up to 1000 hours under ambient conditions.
Results and discussion
Design and synthesis of the three polymers
When designing the donor (D)–acceptor (A) conjugated random terpolymer, 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) was employed as an electron donating group and 3MT and TPD, respectively, were used as electron acceptors. The effect of a third accepting monomer on the fundamental properties of the terpolymer was investigated and the properties of the two binary copolymers were compared precisely (Fig. 1).

The 3MT group is a relatively weak accepting unit among the various electron acceptors used for designing D–A conjugated copolymers. 3MT-based copolymers with BDT have a wide bandgap energy of 2.02 eV and the absorption spectrum ranges from 400 to 600 nm. In contrast, the TPD unit possesses a compact, symmetric, and planar structure, along with a medium strength electron-withdrawing imide group. TPD-based polymers have a relatively low bandgap energy, which is due to the stabilization energy via the formation of a quinoidal thiophene-maleimide structure in their excited state.17,18,28
Co-3MT, Co-TPD, and NDI-Se were synthesized according to previously reported procedures and Ter-3MTTPD was synthesized via Stille cross-coupling polymerization.9,15,28,29 The resulting polymers were then purified by successive Soxhlet extraction with acetone, hexane, and chloroform. The molecular weights determined by GPC measurement were found to be 26.7 for Co-3MT, 32.2 for Ter-3MTTPD, 13.7 for Co-TPD, and 36.9 kDa for NDI-Se in Table 1.

Optical and electrochemical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the solutions of the three polymers in chloroform and their neat films are displayed in Fig. S1† and 1, and Table 1 details some of the relevant optical data. All the D–A-type copolymers and the terpolymer exhibited a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band from 400 to 700 nm in solution and thin films. As shown in Fig. 1, compared to the spectra of the polymer solutions, the maximum absorption peaks (e.g., λmax) in the thin films are slightly red-shifted, which indicates enhanced intermolecular interaction between the polymer backbones in the solid state.
In general, the random terpolymer with the BDT donor and two different acceptors exhibits intermediate absorption properties as those of binary D–A conjugated polymers, each with the same donor and a different acceptor. In particular, the absorption maximum wavelength of the terpolymer appears between those of the two binary copolymers, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the absorption spectrum appears similar to those of the binary copolymers.27,30,31 However, in the case of Ter-3MTTPD synthesized in this study, the absorption maximum wavelength appears between the absorption maximum wavelengths of Co-3MT and Co-TPD, but the FWHM is unusually wide, compared to that of the solution spectrum. The FWHM is 174 nm for Co-3MT, 190 nm for Ter-3MTTPD, and 115 nm for Co-TPD. According to the results, the absorption spectrum of Ter-3MTTPD was observed similar to the spectrum obtained by simply adding the absorption spectra of Co-3MT and Co-TPD. This is an advantage for improving the light harvesting properties of all-PSCs based on this terpolymer through broad complementary absorption. The optical bandgap energies of the three polymers were calculated from the cut-off edges of absorption in the film state to be 1.99, 1.91, and 1.89 eV for Co-3MT, Ter-3MTTPD, and Co-TPD, respectively.
The electrochemical properties of the three polymers were determined by CV measurements. Cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films and the energy diagram are shown in Fig. S2† and 1c, and the results of the electrochemical measurements are listed in Table 1. The HOMO energy levels of the three different polymers in thin film states were determined using the first oxidation potentials obtained from CV and the LUMO levels of the polymers were calculated using the measured HOMO levels and optical bandgaps. The estimated oxidation onset potentials were determined to be 4.8 eV based on the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) system. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.31/−3.32, −5.42/−3.51, and −5.64/−3.75 for Co-3MT, Ter-3MTTPD, and Co-TPD, respectively. Thus, the HOMO and LUMO levels of the terpolymer are found to be situated between the HOMO and LUMO levels of Co-3MT and Co-TPD.
Photovoltaic properties of all-PSCs
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the synthesized donor polymers with the NDI-Se acceptor, we fabricated inverted-type all-PSCs with the configuration of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The active layer was composed of Co-3MT, Ter-3MTTPD, and Co-TPD as donors and NDI-Se as the acceptor. Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves. The corresponding EQE spectra and integrated current densities of the well-optimized devices are displayed in Fig. 2b. The Voc, short-circuit current (Jsc), FF, and PCE values of the all-PSCs are summarized in Table 2.

The active layers based on the as-cast film with no solvent additive in all-PSC devices showed PCE values of η = 1.4–5.9% in the inverted device configuration. However, when 2 vol% DPE was used as a solvent additive, the all-PSC devices of Co-3MT:NDI-Se, Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se, and Co-TPD:NDI-Se exhibited enhanced PCEs of 1.73, 7.66, and 2.51%, respectively. It was found that a film cast from a 2:1 (w/w) ratio of the donor polymer and NDI-Se acceptor blend in chlorobenzene provided the best all-PSC performance (Fig. 2a). Detailed device performance data are summarized in Table S1.† Ter-3MTTPD showed the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 7.66%, owing to the relatively high Jsc and FF of the device. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2b, the Ter-3MTTPD-based devices showing the highest PCE due to a relatively high Voc of ∼1.01 V exhibited a considerable enhancement of EQE over the entire wavelength range of 400–600 nm, which coincides with the increasing trend of Jsc.
The photovoltaic properties of the blend films observed above are closely related to the photoinduced electron transfer phenomenon. This phenomenon can be discussed by observing the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of blend films of p-type polymers and NDI-Se. PL quenching experiments were carried out to confirm the aforementioned exciton dissociation and charge transfer behavior in the blends.32Fig. 3a–c show the PL spectra of the blend films in comparison with those of the pure polymers (e.g., Co-3MT, Ter-3MTTPD, and Co-TPD). When excited at the wavelengths of 535, 580, and 600 nm, the PL emission peak of the Co-3MT, Ter-3MTTPD, and Co-TPD films is observed in the range of 600–800 nm. Upon blending the donor polymer and NDI-Se acceptor polymer (2:1 wt ratio), the emission from the films in this region is almost quenched; Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se displayed the most effective PL quenching, with an alleviation of 98.4% of the initial emission intensity. The emission intensities of Co-3MT:NDI-Se and Co-TPD:NDI-Se films are quenched by 94.4 and 90.0%, respectively. This was clearly observed in the film state, suggesting that a highly efficient photoinduced charge transfer occurs.

In order to investigate the fast charge transfer (CT) processes occurring within the time scale of nanoseconds, we conducted time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements in the detection range of 600–700 nm.33–35 The neat films of the three polymers and blend films optimized for all-PSC device conditions were prepared. The normalized TRPL decays and the TRPL images of the films representing the uniformity and PL decay rate are shown in Fig. 3d–i. The TRPL fit parameters are summarized in Table 3 along with the PL quenching efficiency.

The decay curves for the three blend film samples showed an initial fast decay followed by a slower decay. For the Co-3MT:NDI-Se and Co-TPD:NDI-Se blend films, the TRPL showed biexponential decay behavior with a lifetime of 89 and 97 ps as fast decay lifetimes and 1.13 and 0.42 ns as slow decay lifetimes, respectively. Intriguingly, in the case of the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se blend film, a biexponential PL decay was observed where a fast decay component with a lifetime of 59 ps was followed by a slow decay component with a lifetime of 0.41 ns.
The above analysis by using a biexponential decay function does not mean the presence of two separate exciton species with different lifetimes. However, the average lifetime, τave (e.g., the average decay rate), can be calculated in the process of calculating the parameters for describing such exciton dynamics. This can be used to qualitatively compare the exciton quenching efficiencies of different blend films.36,37
The singlet excitons created in the Ter-3MTTPD-based blend exhibited the shortest calculated average exciton lifetime (τave) of 67 ps, whereas the exciton lifetime increased to 194 ps and 149 ps in the Co-3MT and Co-TPD-based blends. Clearly, the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se film shows the shortest average exciton lifetime.
From the obtained lifetimes, the PL quenching efficiencies were determined (see Table 3), which are consistent with the trend qualitatively observed in the steady-state PL spectra. In addition to the shortest lifetime in the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se film, its PL quenching efficiency of 90% is larger than those in Co-3MT:NDI-Se and Co-TPD:NDI-Se blend films. The average exciton lifetimes correlate well with the observed quantum efficiencies, that is, the high PL quenching in the terpolymer blend film would cause sufficient exciton dissociation, leading to high EQE and Jsc of the all-polymer solar cells.
To investigate the extent of carrier recombination in the active layers of the Co-3MT, Ter-3MTTPD, and Co-TPD-based all-PSCs, Jsc was measured as a function of the incident light intensity (Plight). The data were fitted to the power law equation, Jsc ∝ Plightα (Fig. 2c). The α values of the Co-3MT:NDI-Se, Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se, and Co-TPD:NDI-Se-based devices were calculated to be 0.94, 0.99, and 0.90, respectively, indicating weak bimolecular recombination leading to the generation of a large number of free charge carriers under short-circuit conditions in the active layers.38,39
We also investigated the charge mobilities of the devices to understand the efficiency of charge diffusion and collection at the electrodes. The charge mobility was measured through the space charge limited current method. As shown in Fig. S4† and Table 2, the hole and electron mobilities of the blend films of Co-3MT:NDI-Se, Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se, and Co-TPD:NDI-Se were evaluated using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method. Compared to the charge carrier properties of Co-3MT:NDI-Se (hole mobility, μh = 4.91 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1; electron mobility, μe = 2.02 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1; μh/μe = 24.3) and Co-TPD:NDI-Se (μh = 3.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe = 7.54 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1; μh/μe = 40.0), the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se blend film displayed more symmetric hole/electron mobilities (μh = 1.81 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe = 9.71 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1; μh/μe = 1.86). The highly balanced charge transport in the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se blend film might be a factor responsible for the higher FF observed in the corresponding all-PSCs.
We also studied the charge generation and extraction properties of the all-PSC devices to understand the main mechanisms related to their superior performance (Fig. S5†). We measured the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) of the device. Jph can be defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff can be defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which the photocurrent is zero and Vbias is the applied external voltage bias. At high Veff values, mobile charge carriers rapidly move toward the corresponding electrodes with minimal recombination.40 In the case of the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se-based device, Jph (∼11.23 mA cm−2) reaches a saturation value, suggesting that all photogenerated charge carriers are extracted by the electrodes. Under short-circuit conditions, an exciton dissociation probability [P(E, T) = Jph/Jsat, where Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density] of 99.1% was obtained. In contrast, the P(E, T) values of the Co-3MT:NDI-Se- and Co-TPD:NDI-Se-based devices were found to be 96.3 and 98.8%, respectively. These results indicate that the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se-based device achieves slightly better exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency.
Morphological characteristics of the blend films
Since the performance of an all-PSC is strongly related to the morphology of the blend film of the donor polymer and NDI-Se acceptor polymer, the morphological characteristics of the blend films were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
AFM images displaying the surface morphology of the three optimized blend films are shown in Fig. 4. The Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se blend films exhibit a relatively smooth surface and a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of less than 0.5 nm. In contrast, in the case of the blend films of Co-3MT:NDI-Se and Co-TPD:NDI-Se, larger surface aggregates are clearly observed, and thus, the RMS roughness increased to 2–5 nm. These results support the higher Jsc value observed in the all-PSC fabricated with the blend film of Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se compared to those of Co-3MT:NDI-Se and Co-TPD:NDI-Se.

(a, d, and g) Co-3MT:NDI-Se, (b, e, and h) Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se, and (c, f, and i) Co-TPD:NDI-Se. (a) Rq = 5.67 nm, (b) Rq = 0.44 nm, and (c) Rq = 2.86 nm. 
TEM images provide much better insight into the internal morphology of the blend films and more convincing evidence to evaluate the different performances of the fabricated all-PSCs. As shown in Fig. 4g–i, compared to those of the Co-3MT:NDI-Se and Co-TPD:NDI-Se films, the internal morphology of the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se film is much more uniform and filled with very fine domains. This structure with these unique features is known to be more advantageous for effective exciton diffusion, charge separation, and charge transport owing to the formation of effective, small charge transport channels. These results indicate that a higher Jsc value is achieved in the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se-based all-PSC than in the Co-3MT:NDI-Se and Co-TPD:NDI-Se-based devices to improve the performance of the all-PSC.
Shelf-life stability of all-PSCs
The stability of the devices was investigated without encapsulation and by storing under ambient conditions up to 1000 h. Fig. 5 shows the changes in the electrochemical parameters of the PSC (e.g., Voc, Jsc, and FF) and PCE according to storage time for all-PSCs fabricated with Co-3MT:NDI-Se, Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se, and Co-TPD:NDI-Se. The changes in representative Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE values were determined with respect to storage time under ambient conditions to clearly show the effect of aging on the photovoltaic parameters of the PSC during long-term storage (Fig. S9†). After a maximum storage time of 1000 h, 81.8% of the initial PCE was maintained for the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se-based all-PSC, whereas the Co-3MT:NDI-Se and Co-TPD:NDI-Se-based devices maintained 59.5 and 73.7% of the initial PCE, respectively.
 Fig. 5  Evaluation of the PSC performance stability measured under ambient conditions up to 1000 h. All-PSC devices based on Co-3MT:NDI-Se, Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se, and Co-TPD:NDI-Se. 2 vol% DPE was included in the active layer. 
Furthermore, to investigate the effect of changes in the surface morphology on the shelf-life, we used AFM to observe the topographical changes in the blend films under ambient conditions over a long period of time, as shown in Fig. S10.†41 The Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se film is observed to maintain a relatively fine morphology even after 1000 h under ambient conditions. However, in the case of blend films of Co-3MT:NDI-Se and Co-TPD:NDI-Se, a relatively large extent of aggregation occurs in the film, as confirmed by the AFM images. The shelf-life of the PCE, as supported by the robust morphology of the Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se film, is favorable for applications in all-PSCs.
Conclusion
We successfully synthesized a novel conjugated terpolymer based on 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene as a donor and 3MT and TPD as acceptor units, and the effects of the terpolymer structure on the optical and electrochemical properties were studied. The absorption spectrum of Ter-3MTTPD was intriguingly observed to be similar to the spectrum obtained by simply adding the absorption spectra of Co-3MT and Co-TPD. As a result, the FWHM (190 nm) of the absorption spectrum was very wide. This resulted in efficient complementary absorption properties after mixing NDI-Se with Ter-3MTTPD. Among the three polymers, the as-cast blend film of Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se with the DPE additive exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.66% with a high open circuit voltage of 1.01 V and short circuit current density of 11.47 mA cm−2 in the all-PSC. The results of TRPL support the superior photovoltaic properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the highest values achieved for an all-PSC prepared with an as-cast blend film with a small amount of solvent additive. In addition, in the case of an as-cast blend film of Ter-3MTTPD:NDI-Se in the active layer, the long-term shelf-life under ambient conditions was relatively excellent compared to those of PSCs based on the other two binary copolymers.
