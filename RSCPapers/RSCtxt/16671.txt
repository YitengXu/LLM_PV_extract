    , Accepted 1st July 2013First published on 5th July 2013AbstractLarge scale reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with sulfonic acid groups (SRGO) has been synthesized by a one-step facial method for high performance electrochemical capacitors (ECs). The as-prepared SRGO shows an enhanced specific surface from 254 to 434 m2 g−1 and bulk conductivity from 2 × 10−4 to 2.5 × 10−4 S m compared with that of pristine RGO. An asymmetric EC was assembled with SRGO as the working electrode and Pt as the counter electrode immersed in a 1 M neutral aqueous Na2SO4 solution. The results showed that a maximum specific capacitance of 130 F g−1 was achieved by the SRGO, which is much higher than that of pristine RGO. The SRGO also exhibits a high rate capability and superior cycling stability of more than 99% retention of the specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, it also exhibits excellent specific energy and power densities of 14.6 W h kg−1 and 50 W kg−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, respectively. These results suggest that our SRGO material could be a very promising and versatile building block for carbon-based materials as electrodes towards the next generation of high-performance ECs.
1 Introduction
The rapid development of the portable electronics industry has increased the demand for miniaturized energy storage devices. Recently, extensive research efforts have been devoted to the development of rechargeable supercapacitors or batteries with high energy and power densities and cycle times to fully reach the increasing needs.1–5 Due to its high power density, fast charging rate and excellent cycling stability, electrochemical capacitors (ECs) have been proposed as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation power devices.6–10 According to the energy storage mechanism, ECs can be classified into two types. An electrical double layer capacitor (EDLC) is a type of EC based on accumulating pure electrostatic charges at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Thus the power density of EDLCs strongly relies on the surface area of the electrode materials. Carbon-based materials ranging from zero dimension (i.e., fullerene) to three dimensions (i.e., mesoporous carbon) belong to the EDLC family. The other type of EC is called a pseudo-capacitor, in which fast and reversible faradic processes take place due to electro-active species resulting in a high capacity. Conducting polymers or transition metal oxides/hydroxides belong to the second type of EC.11 In addition, a new design of EC active materials with significantly high capacitance, that combines the merits of the electrical double layer capacitor and the pseudo-capacitor, can be developed by adopting suitable materials.12–20
Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) sheet of sp2 bonded carbon atoms with unique electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. In the past decade, significant progress has been made in various graphene-based applications, such as energy-storage devices,21 memory devices,22 solar cells23 and bio sensors.24 The approaches for preparing graphene include micromechanical cleavage,25 chemical vapour deposition (CVD),26 solvent thermal reaction,17 thermal desorption of Si from SiC substrates27 and chemical routes via unzipping carbon nanotubes (CNTs),28 graphite intercalation compounds (GIC) or wet chemical methods.29 Among them, the oxidation and reduction of graphite is one of the most effective methods in the mass production of graphene for industrial applications. The chemical modified graphene ECs showed a capacity of 100 F g−1 demonstrated by Ruoff et al.21 However, the low capacitance of graphene (i.e., ∼100 F g−1, corresponding to 14.1 μF cm−2) significantly limited its widespread application, especially when compared to their double layer EC counterpart with average charge densities at ∼16 to 50 μF cm−2. Graphene based ECs showed a slightly higher normalized capacitance of 22 μF cm−2.30 Major attention has been focused on the improved capacitive performance achieved by coupling with pseudo-capacitor active materials,31,32 such as graphene–nickel hydroxide,33 Ni(OH)2–CoO–reduced graphene oxide composite34 and graphene–poly(p-phenylenediamine).35 On the other hand, the reduction of GO during the chemical conversion of graphene always results in a gradual decrease of its hydrophilic character, which leads to irreversible agglomeration and precipitation. Surfactants or water-soluble polymers are often involved in the synthetic process to prevent GO layers from re-stacking. However, it is difficult to completely remove those surfactants from the graphene surface. Besides, the nitrogen doped graphene prepared by the plasma process without sacrificing other essential and useful properties, exhibits a high-performance compared to pristine graphene,36 but it is not cost effective and large scalable.
Herein, we propose a one-step facial chemical route for the large scale synthesis of well isolated reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets by covalently functionalizing the RGO surface with sulphonic groups. It has been shown that the obtained sulphonated RGO (SRGO) can be easily well dispersed in water, which implies a minimum aggregation effect and ensures an increased specific surface as well as a low interfacial resistivity. This new active material benefits the ion transportation efficiency and accommodates ions during the charging process of ECs. The scalable and cost-effective fabrication process also holds promise in mass-production ECs, which could have a significant impact on the energy storage industry.
2 Experimental
1. Synthesis of SRGO

Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the synthesis of SRGO, and the corresponding microstructural image. The GO was prepared according to the modified Hummers method which has been described in our previous work.37,38
 Fig. 1  The schematic synthesis of SRGO and corresponding SEM image. 
The synthesis of SRGO is as follows. The as-prepared GO slush was added into 200 ml 0.2 M potassium hydroxide, its pH adjusted to 9 with a sodium carbonate solution. The mixture was then maintained at 80 °C for 2 h under constant stirring. During the reaction, the dispersion turned from dark brown to black and aggregation was observed at the end of this step, indicating that partially reduced GO had been obtained. After centrifuging at 8000 rpm and rinsing with DI water for several times, the partially reduced GO was dispersed in 200 ml DI water accompanied with vigorous stirring. To prepare the aryl diazonium salt for sulphonation, 230 mg sulfanilic acid, 90 mg sodium nitrite, 50 ml DI water and 2 g 1 M HCl were reacted in an ice bath under constant stirring for 2 h, resulting in the formation of partially SRGO. Bubbles were expelled from the reaction mixture and aggregation was observed with the addition of the diazonium salt solution. After centrifuging and rinsing with DI water for several times, partially SRGO was redispersed in 200 ml DI water, followed by addition of 5 g hydrazine. Then, the reaction was kept at 100 °C under constant stirring for 24 h. After rinsing with water thoroughly, the SRGO was thus obtained by simple filtration through a vacuum filtration system. Then, the final product was placed in an oven under Ar atmosphere at a temperature of 50 °C overnight.
2. Characterization
The morphology of different graphene samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Philips XL-30). The bulk resistivity of the as-prepared samples was tested using a four point probe meter (SX 1944, Suzhou Baishen Technology Co., Ltd) by filtering the sample on a polytetrafluoroethene membrane with a pore size of 0.25 μm. The concentration after the vacuum filtration was 10 mg mL−1 for each sample. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were recorded on a FT-IR spectrometer (PerkinElmer Spectrum 100) by directly pressing the sample on the sample holder. The pore size distribution and Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) specific surface area were deduced from the N2 physical adsorption measurement data which were obtained using an ASAP 2010 Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry System (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA).
3. Electrochemical measurements
The fabrication of the working electrodes was as follows. The as-synthesized materials, carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride were mixed in a mass ratio of 80:10:10 and dispersed in ethanol with the addition of a few drops of dimethylformamide. Then, the resulting mixture was coated onto the nickel foam substrate with a spatula, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. The electrochemical measurements were performed in a typical three electrode setup composed of the nickel foam with the active material as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode (refer to ESI†). Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed at various scan rates from 1 to 200 mV s−1 on an electrochemical workstation (VMP3, Bio-logic, France). The galvanostatic charging–discharging was carried out in the voltage range of 0–0.8 V at various current densities from 200 to 2000 mA g−1 on a battery tester (Neware, Shenzhen, China).
3 Results and discussion
1. Characterization
The functional SRGO was synthesized according to the literature in an improved manner. It is worth mentioning that KOH was used in the partial reduction step instead of sodium borohydride as in ref. 39 and 40. The use of KOH has two advantages. One is that the use of KOH is a common, effective and practical way to produce activated carbon at an industrial scale. The activating role of KOH in microwave-exfoliated graphite oxide has been reported by Ruoff et al., showing that this activated graphene film has a very high specific surface and in-plane electrical conductivity.41 The sheet resistivity of various SRGO samples was therefore obtained for comparison using a four point probe meter (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Obviously, the functionalized SRGO presents a lower bulk resistivity than that of as-prepared RGO. Another advantage of using KOH is to partially reduce the GO.30 The partially RGO remains soluble in water while the recovered conjugated structure is able to react via a reductive coupling with the ary1 diazonium salt to form GO-SO3H.40 Therefore, the resulting GO-SO3H can be reduced by hydrazine without inducing aggregation. Fig. 1 shows the SEM image of SRGO. A porous, compact and continuous cavity-like structure is observed for RGO (Fig. S2(a), ESI†) which is in great contrast to the SRGO chunk (Fig. 1), illustrating the serious aggregation that took place during the reduction of the GO. Due to sulphonation, the SRGO film consists of many isolated pieces of ultra-thin SRGO flat sheets (indicated by an arrow in Fig. S2(b), ESI†) with a random distribution. Another reason that accounts for the different morphology from the SEM image between RGO and SRGO is the activation by KOH during the partial reduction step. It is thought that the activation with KOH yields a continuous 3D network of pores of extremely small size.30 Due to the low concentration of KOH used in our experiment, the impact of KOH on the morphology of the as-prepared graphene is not prominent.

Fig. 2 shows the FT-IR spectra of RGO and SRGO. It shows the presence of –SO3H groups by a broad absorption peak ranging from 2850 to 3600 cm−1, a pheny1 group absorption peak at 1621 cm−1, and an epoxy group absorption peak at 1250 cm−1. The relatively broad peak ranging from 2850 to 3600 cm−1 is observed in the sample of SRGO-50 due to the amount of hydroxy1 groups in water molecules. However, once annealed at high temperature, i.e. 700 °C, most of the residual water would be removed under an inert gas atmosphere. Thus, a significant reduction in the absorption intensity of this peak can be observed.40 In addition, it is worth mentioning that the presence of the hydroxyl groups in water molecules and the phenyl groups (indicated by the peak at 1621 cm−1) would lead to the formation of bubble-like defects in the SRGO which are responsible for enhancing the specific surface area by building up a high pressure inside the SRGO (see Fig. 3 and Table 1).

Fig. 3 depicts the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution plots of the samples. As can be seen from Fig. 3(a), these samples exhibit representative type-IV curves with obvious capillary condensation steps, suggesting mesopores. The BET surface area, total pore volume, micropore volume and average pore size of all samples are summarized in Table 1. The BET surface areas of RGO and SRGO are 254 and 434 m2 g−1 with a corresponding average pore size of 2.76 and 2.49 nm, respectively. After activation and sulphonation, the capillary condensation step of the SRGO becomes steep, suggesting a broad pore size distribution (Fig. 3(b)) which is beneficial to enhance the performance of the ECs.
2. Electrochemical performance
The electrochemical performance of RGO and SRGO was analysed by a typical three electrode approach in 1 M Na2SO4 solutions. The CV curves of SRGO at scan rates ranging from 1 to 200 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 4(a). Regardless of the scan rate, the CV curve of SRGO has a fairly rectangular shape without any redox peaks, indicating that the SRGO has an ideal capacitive behaviour. In contrast to SRGO, the CV curve of RGO is no longer close to a rectangular shape at high scan rates (see Fig. S3, ESI†), implying the poor capacitive behaviour of RGO at high scan rates. This could be explained by a simplified model, in which the equivalent circuit of the electrochemical process is analogous to the combination of the electrode resistivity (Rs) with the electrical double capacitor (Cd), where Rs is connected with Cd in series. Applying a linear sweep potential on the electrodes, the current would response with ∼e−t/RsCd. Obviously, from Fig. 4(a) and S3, ESI,† the current decay constant RsCd of SRGO is much lower than that of RGO, indicating the poor conductivity and double layer capacity of RGO and therefore, the non-rectangular shape of its CV. The rate-dependent mass normalized capacitance of RGO and SRGO is given in Fig. 4(b) for comparison. The capacitance of SRGO is much larger than that of RGO at each studied scan rate, indicating the improved electrochemical performance of SRGO. Regarding the SRGO electrode, it is believed that the high specific surface area, broad pore size distribution, low micropore volume and low bulk density are responsible for its high mass normalized capacitance compared with RGO (see discussion below). The broad pore size facilitates the ion diffusion, the low micropore volumes indicate the high fraction of the mesopore volumes which provide as many as possible vacancies for accommodating ions. In particular, the low bulk density is responsible for increasing the actual contact area and volume for holding ions per unit mass. Besides, the low bulk density also enhances the capacitance of the SRGO electrode in response to a high-frequency region. Furthermore, in terms of the SRGO electrode, the mass normalized capacitance only decreased slightly from 125 to 100 F g−1 when the scan rate was increased 200-fold from 1 to 200 mV s−1, in great contrast to RGO, indicating an efficient formation of an electrical double layer within the SRGO porous structure at higher rates.41 This high rate capability of the SRGO electrode is closely associated to its highly porous 3D structure, high BET surface area, optimized pore size distribution and thereby short diffusion pathways that favour a fast charge transportation (refer to the discussion in relation to EIS analysis). More importantly, by taking into account the BET area, we can obtain the area normalized capacitance. Taking the SRGO at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 as an example, the mass normalized capacitance is 100 F g−1, which divided by the BET area of 434 m2 g−1, gives the area normalized specific capacitance of 23.04 μF cm−2, which is much higher than that of the activated reduced graphene oxide at the same scan rate in a 1 M KOH solution (13 μF cm−2),41 suggesting that SRGO is more advanced than activated graphene as a versatile building block for carbon-based nanomaterials in the application for ECs.

(a) CV curves of SRGO at various scan rates (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mV s−1); (b) mass normalized specific capacitance of RGO and SRGO with respect to the scan rate; (c) galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of SRGO under different current densities; (d) gravimetric capacitance of RGO and SRGO with respect to the current density. Dependence of (e) C* on υ−1/2 and (f) 1/C* on υ1/2 for RGO and SRGO, respectively. 
The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of SRGO are also shown in Fig. 4(c). It can be seen that all the curves are highly linear and symmetrical at various current densities from 200 to 2000 mA g−1, implying that the electrode has excellent electrochemical reversibility and charge–discharge properties. Moreover, the iR drops, which are caused by internal resistance at the time of discharging, are not obvious, even at the highest current density, indicating little overall resistance and excellent electrical conductivity properties of SRGO. On the other hand, there is almost no decline in capacitance at current densities ranging from 100 to 2000 mA g−1, suggesting an excellent rate capability. In addition, it is worth noting that the specific capacitance of SRGO is higher than that of RGO at each scan rate and current density (Fig. 4(d)). This is again demonstrating that the sulphonation is beneficial to enhance the electrochemical performance of RGO because of the increased BET area, optimum pore size and low bulk resistivity.
To further confirm that the enhanced capacitance of the SRGO electrode is mainly due to the enhanced BET area, it is possible to compare the respective contribution of pseudo-capacitance from RGO and SRGO. According to the studies by Trasatti et al.,42 the outer electrochemical surface, estimated from the outer charge (qo*), corresponds to the region touching the electrolyte directly; the inner electrochemical surface, estimated from the inner charge (qi*), indicates the regions of pores, grain boundaries, crevices, and cracks, etc. For simplicity, the charge q (C) presented in ref. 43 has been transferred to capacity (F) in our calculation and simulation. Specifically, the Co* can be obtained from the extrapolation of C* to υ = ∞ from the plot of C* vs. υ−1/2 (see Fig. 4(e)), whereas the total charge (Ct*) can be estimated from the extrapolation of C* to υ = 0 from the plot of 1/C* vs. υ1/2 (see Fig. 4(f)). In the above calculations, C* is the voltammetric charge from the CV curve. In addition, Ci* is given from the difference between Ct* and Co*. Fig. 4(e) and (f) show the dependence of C* on the scan rate of CV (υ). The values of Ct*, Co* and Ci* are summarized in Table 2. Owing to the abundant presence of oxygen-containing functional groups, 46.7% of Ci* comes from the pseudo-capacitance for RGO. However, for SRGO, the corresponding percentage is only 25.12%, indicating that the enhanced specific capacitance of SRGO is mainly due to the enhanced specific surface.

To further understand the superior power performance of the SRGO electrode, the kinetic features of the ion diffusion inside of the porous electrode was investigated using EIS. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the Nyquist plot obtained in 1 M Na2SO4 at the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an expanded view of the high frequency region and equivalent circuit in the inset and the corresponding mass normalized specific capacitance with respect to the frequency for the different electrodes, respectively. The near-vertical slope at the low frequency region indicates a good capacitive behaviour. Meanwhile, the EIS is composed of a small semicircle in the high-frequency region which is derived from the double layer capacitance (Cdl) in parallel with the overall contact impedance generated from the electrical connection between the sample electrode and the charge transfer at the contact interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. The diameter of the semicircle is determined by the charge transfer resistance (Rct in Ω). From Fig. 5(a), the diameter of the semicircle for SRGO is approximately 0.4, which is much lower than the corresponding value for the RGO electrode, indicating the high ion diffusion rate inside of the SRGO electrode which is one of the significant parameters contributing to the high capacitance of SRGO. Besides, the impedance curve intersects the real axis at a 45° angle, which is a typical feature of porous electrodes when saturated with the electrolyte.44 On the other hand, from Fig. 5(b) it can be seen that the SRGO shows the highest mass normalized specific capacitance in the whole frequency range, implying the excellent frequency-dependent capacitance due to the highest BET surface area and lowest bulk density. The frequency-dependent capacity is calculated by the equation: Z′′ = 1/jωC, where ω is the frequency.45
 Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist plot of the EIS of the RGO and SRGO electrodes, the inset shows the high-frequency region of the plot (red line represents the SRGO while the black line indicates the RGO) and the equivalent circuit diagram of the different elements; (b) frequency response of the mass normalized capacitance of the RGO and SRGO electrodes. 
The specific energy and power densities are two key factors for evaluating the power applications of ECs. Fig. 6(a) shows the Ragone plot for the RGO and SRGO electrodes at the potential window of 1.0 V in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The specific energy (E, W h kg−1) is obtained by ε = C(ΔV)2/2 and the specific power (P, W kg−1) is calculated by P = ε/Δt, where ΔV and Δt are the potential window and the discharge time, respectively. As can be observed from the figure, the specific energy of the SRGO electrode decreases from 13.8 to 11.7 W h kg−1, while the specific power increases from 0.1 to 1 kW kg−1 as the galvanostatic charge–discharge current density increases from 100 to 2000 mA g−1. These values are almost 2-fold higher than those of the pure RGO electrode. These results are comparable to those of nitrogen doped graphene,36 metal oxide–graphene46,47 and polymer–graphene composites,48 demonstrating the possibility in the application to hybrid vehicle systems.

The cycle stability of electrodes is one of the crucial parameters for their practical applications. Cycling life tests of over 1000 cycles for the SRGO electrode at a current density of 1000 mA g−1 were carried out using constant current galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling techniques in potential windows ranging from −0.6 to 0.4 V. Fig. 6(b) shows the retention of the SRGO electrode as a function of charge–discharge cycling numbers and the inset gives the last 10 cycles of the charge–discharge curve. The SRGO electrode showed almost 100% capacity retention after 1000 charge–discharge cycles and the last 10 cycles of the charge–discharge curve remained the same shape compared to the initial one in Fig. 4(d), illustrating the excellent long-term cycle ability of the SRGO electrode.
4 Conclusions
In summary, the enhanced electrochemical performance of sulphonated reduced graphene oxide (SRGO) has been demonstrated. Such SRGO materials exhibit a porous layered structure and a high specific surface with low bulk resistivity and interfacial electron transfer resistance, offering a high electrochemical performance, such as high specific capacitance, good charge–discharge stability, excellent rate capability, long-term cycling life and high specific energy and power densities. These results suggest that such SRGO materials could be versatile building blocks for carbon-based materials as electrodes aiming at the next generation of high-performance energy storage devices.
