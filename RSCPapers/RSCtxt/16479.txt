IntroductionSince the discovery of the “Honda-Fujishima effect”,1 TiO2 photocatalysts have attracted much interest as a key material for the decomposition of harmful organic pollutants2 and the synthesis of useful compounds3 by taking advantage of its excellent redox power, and for applications in self-cleaning and anti-fogging coatings owing to its photoinduced superhydrophilicity.4 Generally, in TiO2-photocatalyzed reactions, reduction and oxidation take place concurrently at adjacent reaction sites on the surface, which causes an inherent drawback – the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. The major challenge in this area, in common with the heterogeneous photocatalysis, is therefore to improve the activity by restricting the recombination. For this purpose, the excited electrons in the conduction band (c.b.) of TiO2 must be separated spatially from the holes in the valence band (v.b.), because the characteristic time required for reduction (∼1 ms) is longer than that for oxidation (∼100 ns) by a factor of as much as 10000.5 A very promising approach is incorporation of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) with large work function (i.e., high electronegativity) on TiO2,6,7 which enhances the charge separation due to the interfacial electron transfer from semiconductors to metals.8 Particularly, in view of organic synthesis, selectivity is of great importance, in addition to activity. In order to further increase the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions, we have previously presented the concept of “reasonable delivery photocatalytic reaction systems (RDPRSs)” shown in Scheme 1, in which M denotes a noble metal NP.9 The first condition is that the oxidation sites (TiO2) and reduction sites (M) should be separated. The second condition is that reductants and oxidants should be supplied abundantly and selectively to the oxidation sites and on the reduction sites, respectively. The third condition is that the product re-adsorption on the photocatalyst surface should be inhibited. Simultaneous satisfaction of these three conditions should lead to highly efficient photocatalytic reaction systems. Scheme 1  A schematic representation of RDPRSs. This tutorial review summarizes recent developments in the RDPRS-based design of highly efficient photocatalytic systems. Section 2 presents the fundamental conditions of RDPRS, followed by the key issues of the M/TiO2 photocatalysis: the Fermi energy of M/TiO2 in the photostationary state, the metal particle size effect, and solvent effects. Section 3 describes the applications of RDPRSs in the conversion of light energy to chemical energy, environmental purification, and low-temperature cleaning of sulfur-poisoned metal catalysts.2. Design of M/TiO2-photocatalyzed reaction systems2.1 The fundamental conditionsRDPRSs are exemplified by the Au/TiO2-photocatalyzed 2e−-reduction of 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide (PySSPy) to 2-mercaptopyridine (PySH) [eqn (1)].10 (1)Photodeposition of Pt was carried out to clarify the reduction sites of Au/TiO2 by labeling and visualizing them with Pt.11Fig. 1A shows a typical transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of Au/TiO2 prepared by the deposition–precipitation (DP) method,12 indicating that Au particles with a mean size of ca. 3 nm are deposited on the TiO2 surfaces in a highly dispersed state. In Fig. 1B, the mean size of the metal particle increases with the Pt photodeposition, whereas its number density hardly changes. Fig. 1C is a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) of the Pt-photodeposited Au/TiO2 particles, demonstrating the metal NP has a core–shell form. Irradiation with an electron beam focused on the single metal particle marked by an arrow in Fig. 1C yielded the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) shown in Fig. 1D. The particle consists of Au and Pt, which was also true for the most other particles, whereas no independent Pt particle could be found by EDS analysis. These results indicate that most Pt is selectively photodeposited on Au particles to form the Au(core)–Pt(shell) structure (Au@Pt). The coverage of Au with Pt is caused by the action of the Au NPs as reduction sites in the photocatalytic reaction, where both oxidation (2H2O + 4h+→ 4H+ + O2) and reduction (Pt4+ + 4e−→ Pt0) occur simultaneously on the photocatalyst surface. Evidently, the charge separation of photogenerated carriers can be enhanced by loading Au NPs on the TiO2 surface due to the interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 to Au, i.e., in the Au/TiO2 photocatalysis, TiO2 and Au act as oxidation and reduction sites, respectively (the first condition). Fig. 1  (A) TEM image of Au/TiO2 prepared by deposition–precipitation. (B) TEM image of Au/TiO2 after Pt photodeposition. (C) HRTEM image of Pt-photodeposited Au/TiO2 particles. (D) ED spectrum of the metal particle marked by an arrow in Fig. 1C. The components of the figure are taken from ref. 11. Fig. 2A shows adsorption isotherms of PySSPy on (a) TiO2 and (b) Au(0.25 mass%)/TiO2 at 302 K; Ceq (mol dm−3) and Γ (mol m−2) express the equilibrium concentration and the adsorption amount, respectively. A drastic increase in the adsorption amount of PySSPy is seen when Au NPs are loaded onto the TiO2 surface. As shown in Fig. 2B, the adsorption behavior in each system obeys the Langmuir model. From the slopes and the intercepts of the straight lines, the saturated adsorption amount and the adsorption equilibrium constant (β) were calculated to be 1.3 × 10−7 mol m−2 and 1.3 × 105 mol−1 dm3 for TiO2, and 1.5 × 10−5 mol m−2 and 1.7 × 105 mol−1 dm3 for Au/TiO2, respectively. The adsorption selectivity, defined as ns(Au)/[ns(TiO2) + ns(Au)], can be as much as 99.1%, where ns(Au) and ns(TiO2) are the saturated adsorption amounts on the Au and TiO2 surfaces, respectively. Specific strong interactions between sulfur and Au (or Ag)13 and between H2O (or alcohols) and TiO214 would enable the selective and abundant supply of the oxidant (PySSPy) and reductant (H2O or alcohols) to the reduction sites (Au or Ag) and oxidation sites (TiO2), respectively (the second condition). (2)The strong S–Au bond is intrinsically responsible for the persistent adsorption of sulfur containing compounds to the Au surface, and thus elemental sulfur (S8) was used as an adsorbate [eqn (2)]. Fig. 3A-b shows the S2p-XPS spectrum for Au/TiO2 with saturated adsorption of S8 (S–Au/TiO2).15 The two signals at 160.0–161.3 and 161.3–162.9 eV are assignable to the S atomically adsorbed on the Au NP surface with ionic character (Auδ+–Sδ−), and the S adsorbed with an S8 structure, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A-c, irradiation (λex > 300 nm) of the S–Au/TiO2 particles in deaerated water gives rise to a significant decrease in the intensities of the two S2p-XPS signals. Fig. 3B shows the electronic absorption spectra of the supernatants separated by centrifugation from S–Au/TiO2 suspensions after irradiation.15 The spectrum of the supernatant of the S–Au/TiO2 suspension stirred in the dark for 20 min has no absorption in the wavelength range between 200 and 260 nm. Upon irradiation, an absorption peak due to the S2− ion appears at 230 nm, and its intensity increases with increasing irradiation time (tp). These results indicate that the products, i.e., S2− (and PyS−), are spontaneously liberated from the surface of Au/TiO2 under irradiation (the third condition). This arises from the photoinduced increase in the Fermi energy of Au NPs loaded on TiO2 (vide infra), and the electrostatic repulsion between the TiO2 surface having negative charge in basic solutions.5 S2− ions may also contribute to the suppression of re-adsorption. Fig. 2  (A) Adsorption isotherms of PySSPy on (a) TiO2 and (b) Au(0.25 mass%)/TiO2 at 302 K; Ceq (mol dm−3) and Γ (mol m−2) express the equilibrium concentration and the adsorption amount, respectively.

Fig. 3  (A) S2p-XPS spectra for (a) Au/TiO2, (b) Au/TiO2 with saturated adsorption of S8 (S-Au/TiO2), and (c) S-Au/TiO2 irradiated (λ > 300 nm) in deaerated water. (B) The electronic absorption spectra of the supernatants separated by centrifugation from S-Au/TiO2 suspensions after irradiation. The components of the figure are taken from ref. 15. Fig. 4A shows the electronic absorption spectral change of the reaction solutions under UV-light irradiation in the presence of Au/TiO2. With irradiation, a new absorption centered at 342 nm of PySH appears, while the absorption band with a peak at 233 nm of PySSPy weakens. Also, the presence of isosbestic points at 218, 247, and 295 nm indicates that this reaction proceeds with almost complete selectivity. Fig. 4B shows time courses for PySH formation in the presence of (a) TiO2, (b) Ag(0.25 mass%)/TiO2 and (c) Au(0.24 mass%)/TiO2 at 303 K.10 In each case, the amount of PySH increases monotonically with an increase in tp. Noticeably, the reduction is drastically enhanced by the incorporation of even a small amount of Ag, and the accelerating effect of Au is greater than that of Ag at the same loading level. Fig. 4  (A) The electronic absorption spectral change of the reaction solutions under UV-light irradiation in the presence of Au/TiO2. (B) Time courses for the PySH formation in the presence of (a) TiO2, (b) Ag(0.24 mass%)/TiO2, and (c) Au(0.25 mass%)/TiO2 at 303 K. The remarkable loading effect of Au and Ag NPs on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 can be summarized as follows. The electrons excited from the v.b. of TiO2 to the c.b. are efficiently transferred to Au or Ag NPs (charge separation effect) and accumulated therein (electron pool effect). The oxidant (PySSPy) and the reductant (H2O) are selectively and abundantly supplied to the reduction sites (Au or Ag) and oxidation sites (TiO2), respectively (reasonable delivery effect). The electron pool effect of metal NPs particularly exerts its power in the multi-electron transfer process. The inhibition of the product re-adsorption on the photocatalyst surface also contributes to the increases in activity and selectivity of the reaction (inhibition of product re-adsorption).2.2 Fermi energy of M/TiO2 in the photostationary stateIn RDPRSs, if the Fermi energy of the metal NPs loaded on TiO2 in the photostationary state (E′F) is known, it should be very useful in the design of photocatalytic organic synthesis. Since the E′F dictates the photovoltage in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), it is of great importance also in DSSCs.16 In the pioneering work on n-TiO2 electrodes covered with discontinuous Au films, Nakato et al. showed that the photopotential of n-TiO2 is not in agreement with that of Au, while both the potentials cathodically shift.17 This study provides important information about the mechanism of action of the metal loading on semiconductor photocatalysts. However, most of the photocatalytic reactions were carried out in particulate systems. Recently, the research group of Kamat has determined the Fermi energy of irradiated Au/TiO2 particles in organic solvents using a C60/C60− redox pair.18 Thus, organic synthesis using water as a green solvent will increasingly become important from the viewpoint of environmental conservation. The E′F value of Au/TiO2 in water is determinable by utilizing the photoinduced sulfur desorption [eqn (2)].19S8 as well as PySSPy is selectively adsorbed on the surface of Au NPs (adsorption selectivity >99.6%).20 As shown in Fig. 3, the sulfur adsorbed on Au/TiO2 is efficiently reduced to S2− to be desorbed into water at room temperature with irradiation. The ratio of sulfur desorbed from S-Au/TiO2 dispersed in water (X) was measured at various mean Au particle sizes (d). In every sample, the X value abruptly increased on irradiation, reaching a constant value at tp > 20 min. When the suspension containing 0.2 vol% TiO2 particles was irradiated from the upper side of the reaction vessel, light absorption by TiO2 particles was limited to approximately 1 mm of the suspension because the absorption coefficient of TiO2 in the UV region is about 104 cm−1. Since Au/TiO2 particles are continuously moving throughout the reaction vessel due to stirring and convection, part of the sulfur desorbed as S2− ions would be readsorbed on the Au surfaces of Au/TiO2 below this region. Assuming that the rates of sulfur desorption and re-adsorption are equal at the photostationary state, one can obtain eqn (3) relating X to tp.19 (3)where kd and ka express the rate constants of sulfur desorption and re-adsorption, respectively.The theoretical curves calculated by the non-linear least square method with eqn (3) fitted well with the experimental data. The saturated desorption ratio (Xs) given by kd/(ka + kd) increased with increasing d.To obtain the information on the adsorption state of S2− ions on the Au NP surface, the redox properties on Au/TiO2 films formed on F-doped SnO2 electrodes (Au/TiO2/SnO2) were studied using cyclic voltammetry. Fig. 5A shows cyclic voltammograms of TiO2/SnO2 and Au/TiO2/SnO2 in a 5.0 × 10−4 mol dm−3 Na2S solution containing 0.1 mol dm−3 NaClO4. Two pairs of redox waves are observed for Au/TiO2/SnO2 [curves (b) and (c)], whereas TiO2/SnO2 is almost inactive in the potentials (U/V vs. Ag/AgCl) ranging from −1.0 to +0.3 V [curve (a)]. Apparently, the Au NPs act as a good electrocatalyst for the redox reactions of sulfur. When the potential is scanned from the rest potential (−0.50 V) toward the anodic direction first [curve (b)], an oxidation wave appears at −0.11 V corresponding to the formation of S-multilayers. On reversing the sweep direction (curve (c)), only a reduction wave corresponding to the reduction of S to S2− ions is observed at −1.0 V with reduction peak at −0.66 V being absent due to the reduction of S-multilayers to S (see curve (b)). Thus, the present reaction at the photostationary state can be expressed by eqn (2). The application of the Nernst equation to eqn (2) yields eqn (4) relating E′F to Xs. It should be noted here that E′F provides the Fermi energy of Au NPs loaded on TiO2 because sulfur is selectively adsorbed/desorbed on/from the Au NP surface. (4)where E0 is the standard redox potential of S/S2− (−0.447 V vs. SHE). Fig. 5  (A) Cyclic voltammograms of (a) TiO2/SnO2, (b) Au/TiO2/SnO2 starting from the anodic direction, and (c) Au/TiO2/SnO2 starting from the cathodic direction in a 5 × 10−4 mol dm−3 Na2S solution containing 0.1 mol dm−3 NaClO4. (B) E′F calculated from eqn (4) (left axis) and scaled from vacuum level (right axis) as a function of d. Fig. 5B shows E′F calculated from eqn (4) (left axis) and scaled from the vacuum level (right axis) as a function of d. The rise in E′F with increasing d means that the photoinduced reduction power of Au NPs loaded on TiO2 increases as d increases in the range 3.0 ≤d≤ 13 nm.2.3 Metal particle size effectAu NPs loaded on metal-oxide supports have been revealed to exhibit high activities for important chemical reactions, whereas bulk Au is chemically inert.21 The most intriguing point in the thermally activated catalysis of Au NPs is the strong dependence of the activity on its particle size, e.g., the activity for low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide reaches a maximum at d∼ 3 nm.22 We have recently found a quite different Au particle size-dependence of the photocatalytic activity of Au/TiO2 for RDPRS when the Au loading amount (x) maintained constant.19As a first test reaction, the Au/TiO2-photocatalyzed reduction of PySSPy to PySH [eqn (1)] was carried out.10Fig. 6A shows plots of the initial rate of reaction (v0) vs.d, where the v0 value for d = 0 is that for the TiO2 system: x = 0.44 mass%. The photocatalytic activity significantly increases as a result of the Au NP loading. The v0 value increases with increasing d in spite of the decrease in the Au surface area. Au/TiO2-photocatalyzed 6e−-reduction of nitrobenzene (NB) to aniline (AN) also belonging to RDPRS was performed as a second test reaction.23 The addition of CH3OH as a hole scavenger causes for the NB reduction to proceed,14 whereas the reduction hardly occurred in water for both the TiO2 and Au/TiO2 systems. Fig. 6B shows the electronic absorption spectral change of the reaction solution containing 0.1 mol dm−3 CH3OH with UV-light irradiation in the presence of Au/TiO2 with x = 0.44 mass%. Irradiation yields a new absorption around 230 nm due to AN, accompanied by a decrease in the absorption of NB centered at 270 nm. Since isosbestic points are situated at 210, 220, and 245 nm, the 6e−-reduction of NB to AN proceeds almost selectively also in this case [eqn (5)]. (5)Fig. 6C shows the turnover frequency (TOF) for the Au/TiO2-photocatalyzed reduction of NB in the presence of 0.1 mol dm−3 CH3OH as a function of d (3.0 < d < 13 nm) with x = 0.44 mass%. On the assumption that the surface Au atom is the reduction site, the TOF was calculated from the x and d values. Au NP-loading gives rise to a drastic increase in the photocatalytic activity, whereas no reduction occurs without Au NPs (d = 0). Also, the TOF increases as the d value increases. The profiles of the d-dependences of the photocatalytic activities (Fig. 6A and C) are similar to the E′Fvs.d plots (Fig. 5B). Thus, the increase in the activity for the Au/TiO2-photocatalyzed reduction with increasing d can be attributed to the increase in E′F. Fig. 6  (A) Plots of the initial rate of the Au/TiO2-photocatalyzed reduction of PySSPy to PySH (v0) vs.d, where the v0 value for d = 0 is that for the TiO2 system. (B) Electronic absorption spectral change of the NB solution with UV-light irradiation in the presence of Au/TiO2 with [CH3OH] = 0.1 mol dm−3. (C) The TOF for the Au/TiO2-photocatalyzed reduction of NB as a function of d (3.0 < d < 13 nm) with [CH3OH] = 0.1 mol dm−3. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements provide semi-quantitative information on the photoinduced interfacial electron transfer in the metal-semiconductor coupled systems.24Fig. 7A shows electronic absorption spectra and PL spectra for TiO2, Au(d = 4.2 nm)/TiO2, and Au(d = 13 nm)/TiO2, with x = 0.44 mass%. In the absorption spectra, Au/TiO2 has a broad absorption around 550 nm due to the surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs along with a strong absorption band below 385 nm due to the TiO2 interband transition. In contrast, in the PL spectrum of TiO2, a broad emission band is present in the range from 380 to 700 nm. The main band at 424 nm (B1) can be assigned to the band–band PL. Also, a sharp band at 470 nm (B2) is attributed to the emission from vacancy levels. Further, a band at 575 nm (B3) may result from impurity levels because pure TiO2 does not have this PL band. There are two kinds of electron-trap sites in the TiO2 particles used in this study. When Au NPs are loaded on TiO2, the relative PL intensity decreases, although the spectral profile is invariant. A similar trend has recently been reported also for the Ag/TiO2 particles.25 Interestingly, the decreasing degree of the PL intensity for Au(d = 13 nm)/TiO2 is greater than that for Au(d = 4.2 nm)/TiO2. The PL intensity is thought to decrease with the Au–NP loading because of the reduction in the recombination due to the interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 to Au. Further, the efficiency of the electron transfer is suggested to increase as the d value increases in the range below 13 nm.

Fig. 7B shows PL intensity vs. time curves for TiO2, Au(d = 4.2 nm)/TiO2, and Au(d = 13 nm)/TiO2, with x = 0.44 mass%. Each set of data can be fitted by a double-exponential function [eqn (6)]; Table 1 summarizes the fitting parameters. (6)where c1 and c2 are the weights, and τ1 and τ2 the life-times, of the longer-lived and the shorter-lived components, respectively.

 TiO2Au(4.2 nm)/TiO2Au(13 nm)/TiO2c1737680664τ1/ms4.432.270.93c2199267282τ2/ms26.517.610.0As a result of Au–NP loading on TiO2, two significant changes are apparent. One is the increase in the ratio of c2 to c1, and another is the decrease in τ1 and τ2. Also, these tendencies are more pronounced in Au(d = 13 nm)/TiO2. Fig. 7C shows PL spectra of TiO2, Au(d = 4.2 nm, x = 0.44 mass%)/TiO2, and Au(d = 13 nm, x = 0.44 mass%)/TiO2 delayed by 25 ms. Each spectrum has a broad PL band at λ > 450 nm, of which peak position is close to that of B3 in Fig. 7A. The direct electron-hole recombination is an ultrafast event, occurring at 1 ps.26 Accordingly, B2 and B3 are tentatively assignable to the shorter-lived PL from shallow trap sites at ca. 0.6 eV below the c.b. and the longer-life PL from deep trap sites at ca. 1.0 eV below the c.b., respectively. A new path of the excited electron transfer from TiO2 to Au explains the decrease in the PL life time with the Au–NP loading.In this manner, the same conclusion can be drawn from the kinetic analysis of the PL spectra that the efficiency of the interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 to Au increases as the d value increases. This is further consistent with the experimental results that the E′F value increases to improve the photocatalytic activity for the Au/TiO2-photocatalzyed reduction with increasing d. Reducing the size of the metal particle at a given loading amount necessarily increases its number density. It was previously shown by solving the 2D Poisson equation for M/TiO2 that the metal NPs produce the electric field at the metal–TiO2 interface to enhance the charge separation.27 However, when too many metal particles are loaded on a single TiO2 particle, the charge separation effect is rather impaired due to the overlap of the interfacial electric field. This reasonably explains the conclusion drawn from the PL measurements that the efficiency of the interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 to Au NPs increases with increasing d in the range 3.0 ≤d≤ 13 nm.2.4 Solvent effectsIn liquid-phase heterogeneous photocatalysis, the solvent could be an important factor, as it is in the standard homogeneous organic synthesis, but it has not yet been studied. In order to obtain a general understanding of the d-dependence of E′F, the chemical potential (μ) for model Au clusters was calculated from eqn (7) by the density functional theory calculations as a function of excess electron number n.19 μ = −(Ip + EA)/2(7)where Ip and EA are ionization potential and electron affinity, respectively.The μ value can be compared to the experimentally determined E′F value. Fig. 8A and B show the structures of the model clusters (Au)10 and (Au)22 used for the calculations, which were truncated from the Au(111) plane. The Au10 cluster is frequently used for theoretical studies of adsorption of simple molecules to the fcc(111) surface, such as Ni, Cu, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au. In those cases, the Au7 hexagon represents the (111) surface, and the three Au atoms the second layer. In this study, since the reaction on the Au NP surface possibly occurs at some defect sites (kink or corner sites) on the surface rather than the flat terrace sites, a standard Au10 cluster is used upside-down to represent a defect site (Fig. 8A). To examine the size dependency, a larger Au22 cluster is made by adding twelve Au atoms as a third layer to the upside-down Au10 cluster (Fig. 8B). Fig. 8C shows the n-dependence of μ in vacuum for (Au)10 and (Au)22. In each system, the μ value steeply increases with an increase in n, and the increment of μ for (Au)10 is larger than that for (Au)22 at the same n. Recently, the research group of Kamat has prepared Au(3 < d < 8 nm)/TiO2 particles using 3-mercaptopropionic acid as a bifunctional coupling agent, measuring the Fermi energy of Au/TiO2 in a toluene–ethanol mixed solvent using C60/C60− as a redox pair.18 As a result, they observed a trend opposite to ours, namely that the E′F increases with decreasing d, and attributed this to the quantum size effect of Au NPs. Clearly, the change in μ in Fig. 8C is overestimated; however, the trend is in agreement with that reported by Kamat et al. Also, the research group of Goodman has revealed (using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy) that the Au particle formed on the surface of a TiO2 single crystal undergoes metal-to-nonmetal transformation when it has dimensions smaller than 3.5 nm (diameter) × 1.0 nm (height).22 Therefore, in low-polarity solvents such as a toluene–ethanol mixed solvent (relative dielectric constant, εr = 13.8), the μ value for the same n would increase with decreasing d because of the increase in the gap of adjacent energy levels. The μ value calculated with the polarized continuum model (PCM) taking the solvent effect by water is also shown in Fig. 8C as a function of n for (Au)10 and (Au)22. The μ value for each cluster in water is close to that in vacuum at n = 0, increasing with increasing n; however, the increment significantly decreases to be exactly comparable with the experimental data (Fig. 5B). These findings indicate that charged Au NPs are greatly stabilized in water by the solvation. Consequently, the difference in μ between (Au)10 and (Au)22 becomes small and the magnitudes of μ are even interchanged in an irregular way. Fig. 8D shows the difference in μ between in vacuum and in water [Δμ = μ(water) −μ(vacuum)] for (Au)10 and (Au)22. The fact that (Au)10n− clusters are more stabilized than (Au)22n− clusters is consistent with the higher charge density per Au atom for (Au)10n−, pointing out the important contribution of the solvation energy to the E′F in water (εr = 80.1). Thus, we conclude that a predominant factor for determining E′F is the solvation of charged metal NPs and their quantum size effect in polar media and in low polar media, respectively, and the increase in E′F with increasing d in water arises from the increase in the efficiency of the electron transfer from TiO2 to Au and the relative decrease in the stabilization energy due to water solvation.

From the viewpoint of application, the M/TiO2-photocatalyzed reductions of PySSPy and NB dealt with in section 2 may be interesting as green processes for organic synthesis. Section 3 describes other selected applications of RDPRS.3. Applications of RDPRS3.1 Conversion of light energy to chemical energySemiconductor photocatalysis is also of interest and importance in view of energy storage of light energy in a chemical form. The application of the RDPRS idea enables one to achieve a highly energy-efficient up-hill “photosynthetic reaction (ΔG > 0)” [eqn (8)].28 (8)Fig. 9A shows time profiles for the photoinduced reaction of S8 with varying initial concentrations (C0) in the presence of TiO2 and Au(0.46 mass%)/TiO2 at 298 K. The decrease in the S8 concentration with adsorption in the dark was negligible under these conditions. When a deaerated 1.72 × 10−4 mol dm−3 solution of S8 in ethanol solution containing TiO2 was irradiated, the concentration slowly decreased with increasing tp. With a low level of Au loading (a), the reaction is drastically enhanced, and the S8 completely disappears within 15 min at C0 < 1.72 × 10−4 mol dm−3 (b–d). Regardless of x and C0, the zero-order rate law holds for the reaction, of which the rate constant, k, increases with the Au loading by a factor of as much as 9.4, being very weakly dependent on C0 in the Au/TiO2 system. Both the irradiation and TiO2 (or Au/TiO2) were necessary for the reaction to occur. In the electronic absorption spectrum of aqueous NaOH solutions trapping the H2S evolved during the reaction, an absorption peak appeared at 230 nm due to S2− ions. The ratio of the number of moles of S2− ions generated to that of S8 consumed was ca. 8 irrespective of tp, indicating that S8 is stoichiometrically reduced to H2S [eqn (8)]. Also, the generation of CH3CHO was confirmed as an oxidation product in the gas phase by gas chromatography. Fig. 9B shows the TOF for the Au/TiO2 photosynthetic reduction of S8 as a function of d with C0 = 1.72 × 10−4 mol dm−3. The TOF significantly increases with increasing d for 3 < d < 12 nm, which is also ascribable to the increase in E′F with increasing d. Fig. 9  (A) Time profiles for the photoinduced reaction of S8 with varying initial concentrations (C0) in the presence of (a) TiO2and (b–d) Au(d = 4.8 nm, x = 0.62 mass%)/TiO2 at 298 K. (B) The TOF for the Au/TiO2 photosynthetic reduction of S8 as a function of d with C0 = 1.72 × 10−4 mol dm−3. The components of the figure are taken from ref. 28. This RDPRS has recently been developed to the synthesis of a CdS–Au–TiO2 three-component nanojunction system (Au@CdS/TiO2) as expressed by eqn (9).29 (9)Surprisingly, the Au@CdS/TiO2 nanojunction system exhibits a high photocatalytic activity, far exceeding those of the single- and two-component systems, as a result of vectorial electron transfer driven by the two-step excitation of TiO2 and CdS, i.e., an all-solid-state Z-scheme is achieved in this system. Recent studies have showed that an artificial photosynthetic system using semiconductor photocatalysts is a very promising approach for water splitting [eqn (10)].30,31 On the other hand, a great deal of attention has recently been focused on the visible light photocatalysts capable of effectively utilizing sunlight as an energy source.32 Thus, visible light photocatalyst-based three-component heterojunction systems have great promise as photocatalysts for hydrogen generation from water.33 H2O → H2 + 1/2O2   ΔG0 = +237.13 kJ mol−1(10)3.2 Environmental purificationMost of the azo dyes used widely in the textile industries are carcinogenic and resistant to bacterial degradation, thus requiring effective wastewater treatment. The Pt/TiO2-photocatalyzed 4e−-reduction of azobenzene (AB) to aniline (AN) via hydrazobenzene (HAB) proceeds effectively [eqn (11)].34 (11)Fig. 10A shows the variation of the concentrations of AB and products in the presence of TiO2 as a function of tp, with H2O–C2H5OH (9/1 v/v) as solvent. AB is slowly reduced to HAB with a selectivity of 97% at 0 < tp < 3 h. Since the TOF is calculated to be ca. 3 at tp = 3 h, this reaction can be regarded as photocatalytic. Fig. 10B shows time courses of the concentrations of AB and products with irradiation in the presence of Pt/TiO2. A drastic increase in the rate of reduction of AB to HAB is observed as a result of the Pt loading [conversion ca. 100%, selectivity (HAB) = 91% at tp = 1 h]. Noticeably, further reduction of HAB to AN occurs [selectivity (HAB) = 19% at tp = 3 h]. In the absorption spectra, the n→π* band of AB completely disappeared at tp = 1 h, and new absorption bands appeared at 280 and 230 nm at 3 h that are in accordance with the positions for the n→π* and π→π* bands, respectively. Product analysis by gas chromatography confirmed the generation of CH3CHO and CO2; evidently, C2H5OH acts as a reductant. The adsorption amount of AB increased with loading Pt from 4.3 × 10−7 mol g−1 for TiO2 to 2.6 × 10−6 mol g−1 at an equilibrium concentration of 4.0 × 10−5 mol dm−3, whereas the degree of C2H5OH adsorption was essentially invariant. This finding indicates that AB and C2H5OH are preferentially adsorbed on Pt and TiO2 surfaces of Pt/TiO2, respectively. The interaction between AB and Pt would involve both σ-bonding [π orbital (AB) → d orbital (Pt)] and π-backbonding [d orbitals (Pt) →π* orbital (AB)]. Fig. 10  (A) The variation of the concentrations of AB and products in the presence of TiO2 as a function of tp, with H2O–C2H5OH (9/1 v/v) as solvent. (B) Time courses of the concentrations of AB and products with irradiation in the presence of Pt/TiO2. The components of the figure are taken from ref. 37. These results clarified the two effects of Pt loading; one is to increase the rate of 2e−-reduction (AB → HAB) and the other is to progress 4e−-reduction (AB → AN). Pt loading enhances the adsorption of AB and the charge separation of electron-hole pairs. In addition, selective adsorption of the oxidant (AB) on the reduction sites (Pt) and the reductant (C2H5OH) on oxidation sites (TiO2) is confirmed. Further, the larger solubility into water of AN than that of AB would restrict re-adsorption of the product. In this manner, the remarkable increase in the reduction rate can be explained in terms of the RDPRS criteria. Also, inspection of Figs. 10A and B suggest that Pt loading leads to the absence of an induction period. The interfacial multi-electron transfer is assisted by an electron-pool effect of Pt with a large work function. At present, degradation of azo- and thiazine dyes are frequently targeted for water purification and used as a model pollutant for the activity evaluation of photocatalysts.2 Pt/WO3 has recently been found to exhibit high photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of organic compounds under visible light irradiation, whereas the activity of WO3 is very low.35 This is a good example of the semiconductor photocatalyst coupled with metal NPs acting as a promoter for multi-electron transfer.3.3 Low-temperature cleaning of S-poisoned metal catalystsThe catalytic activity of Au NPs strongly depends on not only the Au particle size but also the kinds of support, e.g., among various metal oxides tested, the anatase form of TiO2 was shown to be the best support for the Au nanoparticle catalyst in the low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide.36 On the other hand, because of the great affinity of Au to S, gold can undergo sulfur-poisoning from sulfur contained in the feed on the ppm order. Heat cleaning is usually employed to clean the surfaces of sulfur-poisoned metal NPs; however, the high-temperature heating causes a reduction in the catalytic activity due to sintering and surface oxidation. Photoinduced sulfur desorption [eqn (2)] can also be used as a low-temperature method for cleaning metal surfaces, which enables reactivation of the catalysts without deterioration.37A FE-SEM image of Au-loaded TiO2 films is shown in Fig. 11A, indicating that Au nanoparticles (d = 6.9 nm) are deposited on the TiO2 film in a highly dispersed state by the DP method under the same conditions as in the particulate system (Au/TiO2-P) (Fig. 1A). Fig. 11  (A) A FE-SEM image of Au(18 μg cm−2)/TiO2–TF. (B) The sulfur desorption ratio (X) in the Au/TiO2-TF and Au/TiO2-P systems at pH 7 as a function of tp. FE-SEM images of the (C) photocleaned and (D) heat-cleaned Au/TiO2–TF samples. The components of the figure are taken from ref. 37. Fig. 11B shows the photoinduced sulfur desorption ratio (X) for the Au/TiO2-TF (open reaction system) and Au/TiO2-P systems (closed reaction system) at pH 7 as a function of tp. The X value for the thin film system was calculated using the surface S- and Au-atomic concentrations determined by the XPS analysis. The photoinduced sulfur desorption in the thin film system proceeds much more effectively than the particulate system. In the former, the X value reaches ca. 75% at tp = 10 min, whereas 1 h is necessary for approximately half of the sulfurs to be desorbed in the latter. Also, it is noteworthy in the particulate system that the X value saturates near 50% at tp > 1 h. On the other hand, in the thin film system, subsequent to an initial abrupt rise in X, the sulfur desorption is almost completed after the prolonged irradiation. In this open reaction system, the sulfur (once desorbed from the sample surface) should be promptly removed by the flowing water. Another requisite for the cleaning method is that the Au particle size should be maintained after the treatment because it strongly affects the catalytic activity of Au NPs. Fig. 11C and D show FE-SEM images of the photocleaned and heat-cleaned Au/TiO2–TF samples, respectively. The size of the Au particles hardly changes after 10 min irradiation, whereas it increases up to as large as 37 nm as a result of the heating at 773 K. These results indicate that this phenomenon could be applied to provide to a low-temperature method for cleaning sulfur-poisoned Au/TiO2 (photo)catalysts – something that has actually been confirmed to be effective in the Au/TiO2-catalyzed oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzyl aldehyde.15 The rate of the photoinduced sulfur desorption for Pt/TiO2 is larger than that for Au/TiO2,38 and thus this method may also be applicable to the re-activation of Pt particle catalysts.ConclusionsAn idea for designing photocatalytic reaction systems called “reasonable delivery photocatalytic reaction systems (RDPRSs)” has been presented. The synergy of the charge separation and electron pool effects of noble metal NPs (M), the reasonable delivery effect, and inhibition of product re-adsorption can lead to highly active and selective M/TiO2-photocatalyzed multi-electron redox reactions. Also, the metal particle size and the polarity of the solvent are shown to be important parameters affecting the photocatalytic activity of M/TiO2 through the tuning of the Fermi energy of metal NPs in the photostationary state. Future work applying the RDPRS idea to visible light photocatalysts may enable the development of ‘green’ and highly efficient photocatalytic reaction systems using sunlight as an energy source.
