    , Accepted 29th March 2017First published on 29th March 2017AbstractA review on the chemistry of magnesium porphyrins, which have significant interest owing to the relevance to chlorophyll molecules, is presented with emphasis on bicarbonate adducts of magnesium porphyrin and chlorophyll. The chemistry of 26 unique magnesium porphyrins is described as review articles on synthetic magnesium porphyrins are limited. Interest is given to the electron transfer reactions of magnesium porphyrins in artificial photosynthetic systems. The magnesium porphyrins are described considering coordination chemistry, structural aspects, electronic and electrochemical properties.
Introduction
Chlorophyll, the tetra-pyrrolic pigment, is the most broadly occurring natural macrocycle and has a significant role in photosynthesis, one of the most important biochemical processes on earth. Metal magnesium is present in chlorophyll molecules, similar to iron in heme, the other broadly occurring natural tetrapyrrole.1 Nature's choice of different metals with similar types of macrocycle for different biological processes is interesting. Nature chooses a particular substance for a particular purpose. A specific metal is used in a particular macrocyclic ligand depending on the purpose for which the ligand was created. Nature selected the metal magnesium for chlorophyll type light harvesting molecules, so that the non-redox metal magnesium helps in the light harnessing process. On the other hand, iron, the redox active metal, is very necessary for oxygen transport and electron transport molecules. In highly acidic conditions, the presence of some zinc-containing bacteriochlorophylls is known.2 In addition to the selection of metals, some modification in the macrocyclic ligand is seen according to the reason for which it has been created. The fundamental ring of heme is a porphyrin ring (Fig. 1) but the core ring of chlorophyll macrocycle is a chlorin ring. The chlorin ring is a reduced porphyrin ring (a reduced double bond in one of the pyrrole rings) with a fused cyclopentanone ring.3 The bacteriochlorophyll has two reduced double bonds in two opposite pyrrole rings (Fig. 1) and the ring is known as bacteriochlorin. Willstätter and coworkers4 in 1915 reported the structure of chlorophyll and suggested the active participation of chlorophyll in photosynthesis. There are mainly four types of chlorophylls; these are chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll c and chlorophyll d. The structure of chlorophylls is shown in Fig. 2 with the IUPAC atom numbering system for the chlorophyll and porphyrin ring. Chlorophyll b is different from chlorophyll a by the presence of a formyl group instead of a methyl group at the C7 position (Fig. 2). Chlorophyll c does not have any reduced pyrrole ring and is therefore much closer to a porphyrin ring and is known as chlorophyllide owing to the presence of an acrylic acid side chain instead of the long phytol chain.

Chlorophyll d is different from chlorophyll a with a formyl group instead of the vinyl group at C3 position.5 The fifth chlorophyll, chlorophyll f, has been isolated recently.6 Along with chlorophylls, plant leaves contain other different pigments, such as carotenes and xanthophyll. The colour of chlorophylls is green due to their absorbance in the red and blue region (of the visible portion) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because of the presence of carotenoids, fruits and flowers are coloured yellowish.7 Chlorophyll-a/b-carotenoid complexes, known as light harvesting complexes, protect photosynthetic system from strong light.
Chlorophylls are insoluble in water due to the absence of polar groups. Therefore, the study of chlorophylls in water at physiological pH is difficult but it is easy to extract chlorophylls from thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll b is little more polar than chlorophyll a due to the presence of a carbonyl group at the C7 position (Fig. 2), which makes the separation of chlorophyll a and b using column chromatography easy. Chlorophyll molecules undergo demetallation to form pheophytins in the presence of dilute acid. Strong acid can remove the phytol chain. Treatment of chlorophyll with a base like KOH at lower concentration yields phyllins and magnesium porphyrins.8
There has been growing demand for synthetic analogues of natural pigments for their application in solar energy conversion, molecular materials, molecular electronics, molecular recognition and catalysis.9 Other synthetic tetrapyrrolic macrocycles, such as phthalocyanines, porphyrinogen, and corrole, also have different applications. Porphyrinogen is an efficient host for anion recognition.10 Corrole, the tetrapyrrolic macrocycle with only three meso-carbon atoms, has potential applications as a catalyst, sensor and medicinal drugs.11 Isoporphyrin, the tetrapyrrole derivative with a saturated meso-carbon atom, has strong absorption properties at longer wavelengths, similar to chlorophyll molecules.12 Isoporphyrin has interesting redox and electronic properties.13
Magnesium porphyrins are exciting molecules owing to their relevance with chlorophylls of photosynthesis. However, less magnesium porphyrins are known in the literature than other metalloporphyrins like zinc. A review article on magnesium porphyrins describing their importance with respect to chlorophyll molecules is not known to our knowledge. Recently, inspired by the Noble laureate Willstätter's chlorophyll-a bicarbonate adduct, we have shown the formation of a magnesium porphyrin baicarbonate adduct, [(HCO3)MgTPP]− {TPP = meso-tetraphenylporphyrin}.14 The present article describes the chemistry of most of the known magnesium porphyrins, which have significant interest due to their relevance to chlorophyll molecules.
General features
Electronic spectrum
The electronic absorption spectrum of a porphyrin molecule consists of a strong absorption peak known as the Soret or B band and some weak absorption bands, called Q bands. The number and intensity of Q bands provides information about the presence of the metal and substitution pattern of the porphyrin macrocycles. Chlorophyll and chlorins show moderately strong Q bands in the red region (500–700 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. The absorption spectra originate due to strong π to π* ligand transitions. Gouterman's four-orbital model is useful to explain the electronic spectra of porphyrins, chlorophylls and similar macrocycles.15 In this four-orbital model, the two highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) are named as a1u (HOMO) and a2u (HOMO−1), and the two lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) as eg, which are ligand π* orbitals and are nearly degenerate in symmetry.
The frontier orbital diagrams of porphyrin, chlorin and bacteriochlorin are displayed in Fig. 3. The chlorin ring has one reduced pyrrole ring and therefore the symmetry decreases from D4h to C2v of metalloporphyrins. The reduced double bond destabilizes the orbital that contains the electron density resulting, increasing the energy of these orbitals and therefore a red shift of the Q bands is observed in the electronic spectra.16 The bacteriochlorin can be seen as D2h symmetry due to two opposite reduced double pyrrolic bonds. However, conjugation along the y-axis results in very intense Q bands in the lower energy region. A theoretical study of the Q and B bands of free base porphyrin and magnesium porphyrin was carried out by Hirao and coworkers using multireference Moller–Plesset perturbation (MRMP) theory along with complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) reference functions.17 Mg-porphyrin has D4h symmetry. The two Q bands of Mg-porphyrin are degenerate with the 1E1u symmetry. Insertion of an Mg atom in the center of a porphyrin molecule makes the two LUMOs of b2g and b3g degenerate and as a result there is a smaller increase in the intensity of the Q band than in the free base porphyrin. The UV-visible data of some known magnesium porphyrins are given in Table 1 and Table 2.

Fluorescence spectra
Chlorophyll molecules show emission spectra. Emission spectra can be used to check the photosynthetic activity of green plants.18 Chlorophyll molecules absorb light energy and the absorbed light energy is transformed through different pathways. The light energy may be used to undergo photosynthesis (photochemistry) or the excess energy is transferred as heat energy or re-emitted as fluorescence.19 These different modes of consumption of absorption energy compete with each other and the increase in the efficiency of one decreases the others. Therefore, the efficiency of photosynthesis or dissipation of energy as heat can be calculated by measuring the chlorophyll fluorescence. Metalloporphyrins and related tetra-pyrroles are used in photodynamic therapy, in which the interaction of their excited electronic states of porphyrins with molecular oxygen is a key step of the medical process. Steer and coworkers studied the quenching mechanism of the lowest excited singlet states of MgTPP and ZnTPP by oxygen. They found that molecular oxygen quenched the S1 states of MgTPP and ZnTPP in solution at almost the same rate, but smaller than the diffusion limit. The key quenching process involves the radiationless electron spin-allowed S1–T2–T1 relaxation of the porphyrin in the triplet encounter complex, a process with small potential energy barrier.20 To understand the excited-state energetics and intramolecular dynamics of electronically vibrationally excited states of MgTPP molecules, Jortner and coworkers studied the fluorescence excitation spectrum of MgTPP seeded in supersonic expansions of helium. They examined the two lowest S0 → S1 and S0 → S2 spin-allowed electronic transitions of the isolated, ultracold MgTPP molecule. They believe that the universal extensive broadening reported for the Soret band of porphyrin is due to thermal inhomogeneous broadening effects rather than from lifetime broadening effect.21
Synthesis of magnesium porphyrins
The insertion of magnesium into porphyrin molecules is difficult in comparison with other common metals such as Cu, Zn, Mn, Co, and Fe. There are reports of studying the kinetics of Mg incorporation into porphyrin molecules to understand the slow metallation rate.22 Studies were performed on the overall reaction [PH2 = porphyrin dianions]:PH2 + Mg2+ → MgP + H2.
Some modifications in the synthesis methods as well as the use of some catalyst for increasing the yield are also reported.22 However, an efficient magnesium metallation method for tetra-pyrrolic molecules was not developed until the pioneering work of Lindsey's for Mg insertion. The difficulties are due to the instability of magnesium porphyrin complexes and high sensitivity towards acid.23 Magnesium porphyrin undergoes demetalation even in the presence of very dilute aqueous acid. Lindsey and coworkers developed heterogeneous and homogeneous Mg(II) insertion methods for tetrapyrrolic macrocycles.24
In the heterogeneous method, Mg-halides are used in non coordinating solvents like toluene, dichloromethane or chloroform in the presence of non-nucleophilic amine. The authors reported easier magnesium insertion at room temperature with metal halides like MgBr2, MgBr2·Et2O or MgI2. The easier magnesium insertion with such types of metal halide is due to the lability of their ligands, solubility in organic solvents and lower stability of their crystal lattices with respect to the Mg–porphyrin complexes. In the homogeneous method a stable ethereal solution of MgI2 and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) is used at room temperature (Scheme 1). The heterogeneous method is faster and can be used for a wide variety of porphyrinic complexes, such as porphyrin, chlorin and phthalocyanine, while the homogeneous method can be used for porphyrins and chlorins. In another paper, Lindsey reported the synthesis of magnesium porphines by the reaction of 1-formyldipyrromethane containing DBU and MgBr2 in the presence of air.25 Berger and coworkers recently reported a new type of magnesium metallation by ion exchange reactions between magnesium oxide nanostructures and porphyrin dianions at the solid–liquid interface.26 The adsorption of free base porphyrin on MgO nano particles is controlled by the relative abundance of low coordinated surface sites. They observed porphyrin metalation at corner and edge sites of MgO nanocubes and on larger MgO cubes. Recently, Chang and coworkers showed the synthesis of Mg-OFP (OFP, 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octafluoroporphyrin) by condensation of two molecules of tetrafluoro-dipyrrylmethane-2-carboxaldehyde in the presence of magnesium(II) salts. They characterized the compound using single crystal X-ray diffraction studies along with other spectroscopic methods. The crystal structure shows that the MgOFP is flat in structure.27

Magnesium porphyrin
Molecular structure of MgTPP, MgOEP and Mg-porphines
The first X-ray crystal structure of magnesium porphyrin, [MgTPP(H2O)] aqua-magnesium-tetraphenylporphyrin (1), was reported by Tulinsky and coworkers.28 In compound 1, the metal Mg is above the porphyrin plane by a distance of 0.40 Å. The axial Mg–O(H2O) distance is 2.072 Å and the Mg–N(pyrrole) bond distance is 2.082 Å. The space group is I4/m. The Mg atom is hydrated and possesses a square pyramidal geometry. In 1977, the structure of the Mg porphyrin of an OEP derivative, [Mg(OEP)(Py)2] (2), was reported by Bonnett and coworkers.29 Compound 2 (Fig. 4) is hexa-coordinated with four N-atoms of the porphyrin ring and two axial pyridine molecules. In compound 2, the Mg–N(pyrrole) distance was found to have two values of 2.064 and 2.072 Å. The long axial Mg–N(pyridine) distance was found to be 2.392 Å.

The structure of a hexa-coordinated magnesium porphyrin, diaqua(5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrinato-k4N)magnesium-18-crown-6, [MgTPP(H2O)2](18-C-6) (3) was reported by Nasri and coworkers.30 The metal magnesium is hexa-coordinated through the four nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin and two water molecules. The crystal packing is stabilized by O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds between axial H2O and lattice crown ether molecules. Amiri and coworkers31 reported a similar hexa-coordinated Mg-porphyrin complex, [Mg(TBrPP)(H2O)2] (4) (TBrPP = 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)porphyrin). The point group symmetry of the complex 4 is I4/m. The crystal packing is shown to be stabilized by weak intermolecular C–H⋯π, C–H⋯Br interactions, and O–H⋯Br hydrogen bonds of axial H2O molecules.
Lucas and coworkers studied the regioselective meso-functionalization of magnesium(II) porphines with controlled potential electrolysis in the presence of nucleophiles such as pyridine and triphenylphosphines and reported the formation of pyridinium and phosphonium substituted Mg-porphines, magnesium(II)[5-(N-pyridinium)-porphine]hexafluorophosphate (5a) and magnesium(II) [5-(phosphonium)-porphine]hexafluorophosphate (5b), respectively.32 The structure of 5b was determined using single crystal X-ray crystallography. Compound 5b in the solid state forms a π-stacked dimer with a slipped co-facial orientation with a mean distance between the two porphyrin planes of 3.228 Å. The magnesium atom in complex 5b is penta-coordinated by four nitrogen atoms and one axial ethanol molecule. The Mg–O distance is 2.044 Å. The metal Mg is above the porphyrin mean plane by 0.355 Å. The meso-carbon(5)-phosphorous bond distance is 1.794 Å and is slightly misaligned from the porphyrin ring mean plane.
Magnesium proto-porphyrins and pyridyl porphyrins
Rodley and coworkers showed that Mg-protoporphyrin and Mg-mesoporphyrin forms hexa-coordinate complex of type [Mg(porphyrin)(amino acid)2] with various chiral amino acids like L-histidine, D/L-proline, L-serine, and L-threonine.33
The model structure of [Mg(protoporphyrin)(L-proline)2] (6a) is shown in Fig. 5. The [Mg(porphyrin)(amino acid)2] complexes show a prominent Cotton effect in the UV-VIS region. Rodgers and coworkers reported the synthesis of a series of free base meso-2-pyridylporphyrins by condensation of 4-alkylbenzyl-2,2′-dipyrromethanes (alkyl = Me, n-Pr, or n-Bu) with 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde.34 Metallation with Mg(II) into this meso-2-pyridylporphyrins yields respective Mg-porphyrins. They characterized Mg[meso-({2-pyridyl}-tristolyl)porphyrin] (7a) and Mg[meso-({2-pyridyl}-tris-{4-butylphenyl})porphyrin] (7b) using NMR spectroscopy. The magnesium compound 7a and 7b stays as dimers in solution. The dimers show cofacial edge-over-edge structure with the porphyrin system in close poximity. On treatment with nucleophilic solvents such as acetone, DMF, and DMSO, the dimer get converted to the monomers. Arnold and coworkers35 reported the synthesis of di- and tri-porphyrin arrays consisting of 5,15-diphenylporphyrinatomagnesium(II) (MgDPP) coordinated porphyrinylphosphine oxides. Treatment of MgDPP with Ni(II) porphyrinylphosphine oxide forms dimer 8a. The self-coordination of diphenyl[10,20-diphenylporphyrinatomagnesium(II)-5-yl]phosphine oxide yields bis{diphenyl[10,20-diphenylporphyrinato-magnesium(II)-5-yl]phosphine oxide} 8b.
 Fig. 5  Structure of magnesium-porphyrins 6, 7 and 8. Compound 6a is a protoporphyrin derivative; substituents are not shown for clarity. 
The high binding constant of MgDPP to triphenylphosphine oxide and the very high self-association constant of [MgDPP(Ph2PO)] explains the strong affinity of phosphine oxides towards Mg(II) porphyrins.
Magnesium porphyrin coordination polymer and self-assembled structures
Coordination polymers that are formed due to metal ligand bonds are one of the most widely growing research areas of the last two decades. Porphyrin coordination polymers have significant demand due to their bio-mimetic model of electron transfer in photosynthesis and in catalysis.36 We first reported the coordination polymer of a Mg-porphyrin, MgTMPP (9), (TMPP = 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylporphyrin).37 Compound 9 is a one dimensional (1D) coordination polymer (Fig. 6) due to the coordination bond between magnesium and oxygen atoms of the m-methoxy group of two adjacent porphyrins.
 Fig. 6  (a) Building block for the formation of 1 D coordination polymer of 9 and (b) layered structure of 9. 
In the crystal structure, the metal Mg is hexa-coordinated with two trans-axial oxygen atoms of the m-methoxy group of two adjacent molecules (Fig. 6). The axial Mg–O bond length, 2.409(5) Å, corroborates the pure coordinate nature of the bond. There is a growing interest in porphyrin nanostructures because of their application in molecular machines, catalysis, and sensors.38 We studied the structures of complex 9 on surfaces using scanning imaging methods in different solvents. In dichloromethane-petroleum ether medium after evaporation, complex 9 was found as a spherical shape but in a coordinating solvent like ethanol, the polymer aggregation stops and it is observed as relatively large rectangles. We analyzed the structure of compound 9 and its zinc analogue on surfaces in the nano domain. Compound 9 was found to be a nano-sphere whereas the zinc analogue was nano-rods (Fig. 7).

Rath and coworkers showed the spontaneous self-association of magnesium tetranitro-octaethylporphyrins, [Mg(tn-OEP)], with several bidentate axial ligands to form well-defined supramolecular architectures (Fig. 8).39 They used six ligands of increasing chain lengths from 0.73 to 2.70 nm (ref. 39) and characterized all the supramolecular architectures using single crystal X-ray crystallography. Treatment of excess pyrazine with [Mg(tn-OEP)] yields the [Mg(tn-OEP)(pyrazine)]n (10a). Similarly, addition of 4-cyanopyridine to [Mg(tn-OEP)] yields [Mg(tn-OEP)(cyano-pyridine)]n (10b). The crystal structure shows compounds 10a and 10b as one-dimensional (1D) polymeric chains due to hexa-coordination. The polymeric chains were aligned parallel to each other in the crystal lattice. A spherical structure was found instead of a 1D polymeric structure for large bridging ligands due to the formation of five-coordinated porphyrin dimers, which undergo self-aggregation due to π–π interactions to fill space created by large bridging ligands.39 The authors also analyzed the structures of the molecules in solution and their surface patterns on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). We recently reported the crystal structure of Mg(TMPP) as [Mg(TMPP)(H2O)]·(CH3COCH3)2H2O 11, which shows a one-dimensional infinite structure due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding. We studied the luminescence properties of compound 11. At higher concentrations of porphyrin 11, in the presence of lipid, compound 11 displays increased fluorescence excited at the Soret band (Table 1) indicating, some role of lipid in tuning the photo-physical properties of chlorophylls.40

Hexa-coordinated Mg-tetraphenyl, -tetrathienyl and -tetrafuryl porphyrins
Ravikanth and coworkers reported the synthesis and structural characterization of meso-tetrasubstituted Mg(II) porphyrins containing six membered phenyl groups [MgTPP(THF)2] 12 and five membered thienyl groups, [MgTThP(THF)2], 13 and furyl groups, [MgTFP (THF)2], 14 (Fig. 9).41 They also studied the effects of meso-substituents on the electronic properties of compounds 12, 13 and 14 using NMR, absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies. They carried out the theoretical calculations to correlate experimental observations. All three compounds were observed to crystallize as hexa-coordinate with four nitrogen atoms of porphyrin ring nitrogens and two tetrahydrofuran molecules as trans-axial ligands. They observed bathochromic shifts in absorption and emission spectra when they moved from six membered phenyl groups to five membered thienyl and furyl groups (Table 2). The decrease in the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for 13 and 14 corroborates the bathochromic shifts observed in absorption and fluorescence spectra for five membered thienyl and furyl groups containing porphyrins.

Magnesium porphyrin bicarbonate adduct
The photosynthesis system comprises three well-connected domains photosystem I (PSI), photosystem II (PSII) and the Calvin cycle. Besides the substrate CO2, one activator CO2 molecule is essential for the Calvin cycle.42 The substrate CO2 binds to the enzyme, RuBisCO, and undergoes a biochemical reaction and is finally converted to carbohydrate by using the energy supplied by PSI in the presence of one “activator CO2 molecule”.43
In addition, bicarbonate, a direct derivative of CO2, is required for the efficeincy in oxygen evolving reactions (PSII).43 However, in the light absorption reaction, i.e., in PSI, the role of CO2 was not known. Before the discovery of the Calvin cycle Willstätter and coworkers44 reported the possible binding of CO2 to metal magnesium of chlorophyll in the form of bicarbonate. Warburg also reported the possiblility of binding of CO2 with chlorophyll in the photolyte theory.45 Inspired by Willstätter's chlorophyll–bicarbonate adduct, we performed a reaction with MgTPP by passing CO2 through MgTPP solution in dichloromethane (DCM) in the presence of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and were able to isolate the bicarbonate adduct of MgTPP.14 We found that under sunlight illumination the bicarbonte-coordinated MgTPP reduces Fe(III) to Fe(II) and thus proposed that CO2 in the form of bicarbonate facilitates the light harvesting reaction.14 The perspective view of the complex [Bu4N][MgTPP(HCO)3], 15, is shown in Fig. 10. In the crystal lattice (Fig. 10b), compound 15 forms dimeric species due to the hydrogen bonding between the axial bicarbonate of two porphyrins through the hydroxyl group of one bicarbonate and the keto group of another bicarbonate. IR and 13C NMR spectra of compound 15 corroborated the binding of bicarbonate with MgTPP. Compound 15 undergoes easier oxidation than magnesium porphyrin, MgTPP. We extended our studies with chl a to understand the Willstätter postulated adduct and found that under a CO2 atmosphere isolated chlorophyll a behaves similarly to bicarbnate-bound MgTPP. We showed the binding of bicarbonate to the Mg-center of chlorophyll a using 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 11). The electrochemistry of chlorophyll a was studied in the presence of bicarbonate and the first oxidation potential of chlorophyll a in the presence of bicarbonate was found to be lower by 60 mV. EPR study was found to support the electrochemical studies, which showed the easier generation of a π-cation radical in the presence of carbon dioxide. Thus, an additional role of CO2 as a promoter by binding on the magnesium center of chlorophyll in the primary light absorption stages was shown.

Anionic magnesium porphyrins
Nasri and coworkers reported the isolation and structural characterization of three anionic penta-coordinated complexes azido(meso-tetraphenylporphyrinato)magnesium(II) [MgTPP(N3)]−, 16, thiocyanato-N(meso-tetraphenylporphyrinato)magnesium(II) [MgTPP(SCN)]−, 17, and cyanato-N(meso-tetraphenylporphyrinato)magnesium(II) [MgTPP(OCN)]−, 18, using 2.2.2-cryptand (Fig. 12).46 In compound [MgTPP(SCN)]− the ligand NCS binds through nitrogen atom instead of the S atom. The molecular structure of [Mg(TPP)(N3)]− is stabilized by weak intermolecular C–H⋯N hydrogen bonds between one carbon atom of the phenyl ring and the terminal nitrogen atom of the azido ligand. The structure of [Mg(TPP)(OCN)]− shows weak intermolecular C–H⋯O H-bonds between one carbon atom of the phenyl ring and the terminal oxygen atom of the NCO ligand.

Electrochemistry of Mg-porphyrin
Magnesium porphyrins undergo one and two electron oxidation to form respective π-cation radicals and dications similar to zinc porphyrins.47 Scheidt and coworkers first reported the crystal structure of a π-cation radical of magnesium porphyrin, [Mg(OEP˙)]+ (19) (Fig. 13).48 They found single crystals from two different solvent systems and characterized them as [Mg(OEP+)(EtOH)][Mg(OEP˙)OClO3]ClO4 and [Mg(OEP˙)OClO3]2. Both structures are dimeric but inter-ring interactions are not the same. It was observed that highly polar solvents result in a tightly coupled cofacial-dimer, whereas low polarity solvents result in a weakly coupled dimer. The concentration- and solvent-dependent UV-visible spectral studies corroborates the solid state results.48 There are some reports of transport of H3O+ and/or OH− by photogenerated magnesium octaethylporphyrin cation in glycerol monooleate bilayers.49 Smalley and coworkers studied the reaction of photogenerated magnesium octaethylporphyrin cation and hydroxide ion in a mixed alcohol/water solvent to understand the possible transport of OH− and/or H+ across the lipid bilayer membrane mediated by magnesium porphyrin cation.50 In lipid bilayer, the concentration of H2O is much higher than the concentration of OH− ion, therefore the authors proposed the active participation of water molecules in the reaction pathway.

The substituent groups on the porphyrin periphery have a significant role in the redox chemistry of metalloporphyrins. Around a 0.5 V anodic shift was observed for porphyrin ring oxidation/reduction reactions of compound Mg-OFP (20) (OFP, 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octafluoroporphyrin) due to the presence of eight electron withdrawing fluoro groups.27 Devillers and coworkers performed the detailed electrochemical characterization of magnesium(II) porphine in dichloromethane solution.51 They observed two well-defined and distinct steps yielding the π-cation radical and the π-dication. Diprotonated di-isoporphine species are formed during the condensation of the reactive dication with neutral magnesium porphines. They performed the electrolysis at the potential of the π-cation radical generation and reported the generation of several oligoporphyrins, with diporphine as an important product. But during oligomerization, demetallation was observed, which can be prevented by the addition of 2,6-lutidine as a base. These magnesium porphine oligomers may have interesting applications in molecular devices, such as nonlinear optical devices, sensors or photoactive species.
Electron transfer reactions of Mg-porphyrins
Senge and coworkers discussed the electron transfer reaction of several synthesized magnesium porphyrins and phthalocyanines in relevance to photosynthesis.52 D'Souza and coworkers studied the electronic, redox and electron transfer reaction of a self-assembled donor–acceptor dyad, C60Im-MgTPP (Fig. 14), formed via axial coordination of MgTPP and imidazole appended fullerene dyad.53 They found evidence of the formation of only a 1:1 supramolecular complex C60Im:MgTPP (21) instead of a 2:1 supramolecular complex. The theoretical calculations revealed that the majority of the highest occupied frontier molecular orbital (HOMO) are on the MgTPP species, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) are on the fullerene species. The charge-separated state of the supramolecular complex 21 was proposed as C60Im˙−:MgTPP˙+.

There are reports of electron transfer from magnesium porphyrin to quinone and different viologen derivatives.54 Szulbinski and coworkers studied the photo-induced electron transfer reaction between Mg-porphyrin, MgTAP {TAP = meso-tetra-p-(N-ethyl-N,N-dimethyl)anilinoporphyrin} and viologen.55 Hochstrasse and coworkers56 reported time-dependent anisotropy measurements with [5-(1′,4′-benzoquinonyl)10,15,20-triphenylporphyrinato]magnesium (22). They found that the photoinduced electron transfer reaction with the locally excited state of porphyrin 22 (Fig. 14) is solvent-independent, but the thermal charge recombination is solvent-dependent. Photo-induced electron transfer reactions that involve the porphyrin 22 locally excited state depend on the rate of population transfer between Qx and Qy levels.56 Holten and coworkers reported perylene–porphyrin dyads that shows efficient light-harvesting and energy-utilization properties. The dyads consist of a perylenemono(imide) dye joined to a porphyrin through an ethynylphenyl link. They studied this using the Zn and Mg complexes of the dyad.57 Odobel and coworkers synthesized some magnesium porphyrins (23) appended to a platinum terpyridine–acetylide complex through a para-phenylene-bisacetylene spacer.58 They studied the ground state electronic properties and photo-physical properties of the dyads. They found that excitation of the porphyrin part results in a very fast electron transfer to the attached platinum terpyridine–acetylide part with subsequent charge recombination. Perutz and coworkers synthesized several covalently linked donor-bridge-acceptor assemblies with magnesium porphyrins and a rhenium(bipyridine)(tricarbonyl)(picoline) complex through an amide linkage (Fig. 14).59 One such type of assembly is 5-{4-[rhenium(I)tricarbonyl(3-picoline)-4-methyl-2,2′-bipyridine-4′-carboxyamidyl]phenyl}-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrinatomagnesium(II) trifluoromethanesulfonate, [Re(CO)3(Pic)Bpy-MgTPP][OTf], (24).59 The amide bond is between the bipyridine and one phenyl substituent of the porphyrin ring. Electron transfer from the porphyrin to the rhenium unit occurs when the dyad is excited at longer wavelengths related to porphyrin absorptions. Complex 24 returns to the initial state in 35 picoseconds. The observed photochemical pathway is shown in Fig. 15.

Application of magnesium porphyrins
Nguyen and coworkers reported the enhanced activity of epoxidation of styrene catalyzed by Mn(III) porphyrin on addition of magnesium porphyrins.60 This enhancement is due to the formation of a co-ordination trimer, which protects the catalyst from decomposition. Manganese porphyrin bearing bis-pyridyl groups showed the best results and Lewis acid-like magnesium or zinc porphyrin helps to regenerate the deactivated catalyst and recover the original activity of the catalyst. There is a report of detection of alcohol vapours like methanol, ethanol and isopropanol using MgTPP thin films.61 The authors prepared the MgTPP thin films by a spin coating technique, using chloroform as the solvent. The MgTPP optical gas sensors give better responses with methanol than higher alcohols like ethanol and isopropanol. Theoretical calculations at the DFT level were done to understand the mechanism of this selectivity. The use of MgTPP for capture of CO2via the formation of supramolecular amine-bound MgTPP is known.62 In this process, initially a MgTPP-amine adduct is formed, and upon CO2 introduction, the MgTPP is released. Ethylenediamine has a stronger association constant value for MgTPP and behaves as an excellent agent for CO2 capture. There are reports of the use of MgTPP with ethanolamine and pyrrolidine for the removal of sulfur dioxide.63
There is a report of the possible use of magnesium protoporphyrin IX as an antioxidant to protect cells from H2O2 stress. Magnesium protoporphyrin shows peroxidase activity by detoxifying H2O2 in the presence of an electron donor. Interestingly, peroxidase activity is observed only when magnesium is present in the protoporphyrin IX.64 Rath and coworkers recently studied the effect of stoichiometry on the chirality induction process using a supramolecular complex of Mg(II)bisporphyrin as the host and a chiral vicinal diol as the guest.65 They demonstrated the chirality induction process for the 1:2 host–guest complexes using single crystal X-ray structure analysis. Recently, Maeda and coworkers reported the synthesis of highly active bifunctional diporphyrin and triporphyrin magnesium (25) and zinc catalysts using Stille coupling reactions.66 The Mg-trimer complex (Fig. 16) efficiently catalyzes the reactions of epoxides with CO2 to form cyclic carbonates in solvent-free conditions. The maximum TON and TOF found for the Mg trimer were 220000 and 46000 h−1, respectively. The efficient catalytic power of complex 25 is due to catalytic sites formed in the molecular cleft of m-phenylene-bridged porphyrin trimer 25. A theoretical study of Mg(TPP)/TBAI (TBAI = tetrabutylammonium iodide) catalyzed cycloaddition reaction of CO2 to epoxides was carried out by Wu and coworkers using DFT calculations.67 Lintuluoto and coworkers reported the use of bis(Mg-porphyrin) for the direct determination of the absolute configuration of a monoalcohols at millimolar concentrations using the CD exciton chirality method.68 Since the probe for chirality sense is very rare, the capability of chirality sense absolute configuration of chiral alcohols by bis(Mg-porphyrin) is very promising. Rath and coworkers demonstrated the effect of stoichiometry on the chirality induction process using a supramolecular Mg(II)-bisporphyrin complex as the host and a chiral vicinal diol as the guest.65 Kerdcharoen and coworkers reported the possible use of MgTPP and ZnTPP thin films as an artificial nose in the food industry.69 By using optical absorbance spectroscopy, they tested to discriminate various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and alcoholic beverages. By using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, they showed that MgTPP interacts more strongly with the volatile organic compounds than ZnTPP. Mg mesoporphyrin-IX-dimethylester dye and their covalently linked dimers and trimers are used as sensitizers in photoelectrochemical sensitization of SnO2 electrodes. The photocurrent data along with fluorescence intensity and intersystem crossing efficiency show that the excited triplet states participate in photocurrent generation and the photocurrents have a tendency to saturate with increasing dye concentration.70 Berger's new method for magnesium metalation has provided a promising approach for the spatial organization of photoactive molecules in metal oxide hybrid structures. The work emphasizes the importance of an integrated characterization approach like complementary spectroscopy for the study of self-organization of the porphyrin–metal oxide supramolecular arrangements.27

Reaction of magnesium porphyrin with small molecules
Wei and coworkers studied the photochemical reaction of MgTPP with dioxygen in CH2Cl2 using different spectroscopic methods. They reported that MgTPP in the excited state (activated by irradiation) reacts with O2 and forms a stable 1:1 coordinated adduct71 as MgTPP–O2. The authors argued that the oxygen atoms of O2 may insert in the Mg–N bond of MgTPP to form an Mg–O–N bond. There are reports of the study of the photochemical reaction between MgTPP and carbon disulfide in dichloromethane. These reactions are important to understand the different reaction mechanisms of chlorophyll in the presence of carbon disulfide.72 Investigation of reactions between MgTPP and nitric oxide in dichloromethane solution is known.72 The reaction between MgTPP and nitric oxide in solution is a pseudo first order reaction for metalloporphyrins. Nitric oxide has a higher binding constant to MgTPP than ZnTPP. Dehghani and coworkers reported the interaction between meso-tetraarylporphyrinato magnesium(II) [MgT(4-X)PP] (X = H, CH3, and CH(CH3)2) and PCl3 molecule.73 The authors proposed the formation of a new compound [MgT(4-X)PP(PCl3)2] (26) (Fig. 16). They proposed that in 26 one PCl3 is bound to the metal magnesium through the phosphorus atom and the other PCl3 is bonded to the lone electron pairs of two nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin ring, where they acts as σ-electron donors to the phosphorous atom.
Conclusions
The magnesium porphyrin chemistry is discussed considering its relevance with chlorophyll molecules. Lindsey's synthetic methods have made the magnesium insertion easier in porphyronic dianions. We have synthesized a large number of biologically relevant magnesium porphyrins, including magnesium bicarbonate complexes, with the reaction of synthetic magnesium porphyrins with carbon dioxide (CO2). This has resulted in a new role of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. Although the number of known magnesium macrocycles is limited with respect to other metalloporphyrins, the magnesium porphyrins characterized to date show significant diversity. There is scope to expand the works with other magnesium tetrapyrroles and the reactivity of magnesium porphyrins should be determined similar to zinc porphyrins.
