1 Introduction
Sustainability is an organizing principle for meeting the human development goals and meanwhile sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depend, and therefore ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social, political, and economic challenges faced by humanity.1 Nowadays, sustainable development has been widely accepted as a core principle for the social and economic development of human beings all over the world, and it is empowering the people of the world to change the way they think and work towards a sustainable future. Economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social inclusion as three pillars of sustainable development always carry across all sectors of human development. There are several fields for sustainable development goals that one of them is concentrating on energy and environment, because these two most important issues determine the human survival and social development. However, with the global economic growth and the population explosion, the rapidly increasing demand for fossil fuels not only leads to a shortage of fossil energy sources but also brings a significant environmental impact, which has resulted in a series of global issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, climate change, mass species extinction and environmental pollution. According to the prediction by “International Energy Outlook 2017”, world energy consumption will rise by 28% between 2015 and 2040, and however energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will rise up to nearly 40 billion metric tons by 2040 if fossil fuels are used as usual,2 which threatens mankind's survival inevitably. Sustainable development recognizes that the growth must be both inclusive and environmentally sound to reduce consumption of fossil energy sources for today's human activities, and to continue to meet the requirements of future generations. Both the demanding energy requirement and ecological considerations have led to finding substitutes for fossil fuels through other resources, including renewable sources as well as effectively improving energy efficiency.
Sustainable energy is considered as an energy system or technology that serves the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs, and it is normally consumed at insignificant rates compared to its supply and with manageable collateral effects, especially environmental effects.3 The categories of sustainable energy systems involve renewable energy sources such as hydroelectricity, solar energy, wind energy, wave power, geothermal energy, bioenergy and tidal power and also technologies designed to improve energy efficiency which have proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily increasing energy consumption.4 Furthermore, energy efficiency is very essential to ensure a safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy system for the future, and therefore it is a high priority in the sustainable energy hierarchy. As a major section of sustainable energy systems, thermal energy storage and effective heat utilization play a key role in sustainable development and environmental challenges. Phase change materials (PCMs) are a family of chemical substances with high heat values of fusion and solidification and able to absorb or release large quantities of latent-heat thermal energy at a constant temperature by undergoing a phase transformation.5 PCMs not only have considerably higher thermal energy-storage densities compared to sensible heat-storage materials, but also can effectively improve the energy efficiency by bridging the gap between energy availability and energy use, thus reducing the energy waste. Therefore, the latent-heat energy-storage technology by use of PCMs is considered as a promising sustainable thermal energy-storage technology and has received increasing attention from both academic and industrial communities in recent years.6 By now, PCMs have been not only applied in renewable energy effective utilization such as solar thermal energy and low temperature waste heat utilization such as industrial waste heat and waste heat from combined cooling, heating and power systems, but also broadly used for thermal regulation and thermal management in the fields of photovoltaic-thermoelectric systems, pharmaceutical or biological products requiring cool storage, temperature-sensitive electronic parts or devices requiring cool or thermal protection, telecom shelters in tropical regions, energy-saving buildings, smart fibers and textiles with a thermoregulatory function, thermal buffering of Li-ion batteries, thermal comfort in vehicles and many more.7
PCMs are normally classified into solid–solid and solid–liquid PCMs. Solid–solid PCMs cover various organic and inorganic PCMs with form-stable phase transformations such as layered perovskites, dihydric phosphate salts, ammonium thiocyanate, polyatomic alcohols, polyethylene-based crosslinked copolymers, poly(ethylene glycol)-grafted copolymers, polyurethane-based copolymers, and so on.8 Although solid–solid PCMs have the advantage of stable shapes during phase transitions, solid–liquid PCMs are the most commonly used ones due to their relatively higher phase change enthalpies, because molecules in the liquid phase have a much larger freedom of movement than those in the solid phase and correspondingly higher energy. Solid–liquid PCMs are broadly arranged into three categories: organic materials, inorganic salts and some metals as described in Fig. 1.9 Inorganic salts used as PCMs include molten salts, salt hydrates and eutectics. Organic materials used as PCMs tend to be hydrocarbon or carbohydrate compounds and polymers with long-chain macromolecules consisting primarily of carbon and hydrogen. Most of the solid–liquid PCMs have reliable phase change performance and suitable phase change temperatures for the majority of energy-storage applications and moderate prices as commercially available products, and therefore, as attractive candidates for thermal energy storage and thermal management, they are the most widely studied and most commonly used PCMs.10 Although solid–liquid PCMs exhibit desirable properties, there are a number of disadvantages observed when they are applied in thermal energy storage and thermal management. In most cases, PCMs have to suffer from fluidity, diffusion and running off when a phase transformation takes place from solid to liquid, which inevitably results in the difficulty of handling. It is evident that pristine PCMs cannot be used in a reliable pattern for latent heat charging–discharging cycles.11 Moreover, most of the commonly used solid–liquid organic PCMs like various paraffin waxes, fatty acids and polyethers present hysteretic heat transfer and a slow thermal response due to their low thermal conductivity. On the other hand, most inorganic salt-based PCMs have a tendency to either absorb moisture from the atmosphere or lose water through evaporation. Some of the inorganic PCMs like molten salts, eutectics and salt hydrates have high supercooling and phase separation problems, which may lead to serious phase transition hysteresis, poor reversibility and a short working lifespan. Salt hydrates may also migrate when combined with other materials like building materials or textile materials and sweat out at the surface or wash out in a moist climate, and their crystal water is easily lost due to the variation of humidity.12 Therefore, pristine solid–liquid PCMs are usually not recommended for application in thermal energy storage and thermal management unless special latent heat exchange devices or heat exchange surfaces are specially designed.
 Fig. 1  Category and classification of solid–liquid PCMs. 
To avoid troubles and problems from the use of solid–liquid PCMs, there are considerable efforts devoted to developing the form stabilization of solid–liquid PCMs, in which compounding PCMs with various supporting materials and microencapsulating PCMs into suitable wall materials are considered as two of the most effective pathways. A large number of open publications indicated that there were abundant materials that could be used as form-stable supporting substrates to prevent leakage and loss throughout the phase transition process of PCMs and maintain their original shape, and these supporting materials covered carbon materials including active carbon, expanded graphite, graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc., polymers including high-density polyethylene, polyurethane, epoxy resin, etc., clay minerals, silica, metal foam, and expanded vermiculite.13 Although the basic shape or form of PCMs could be maintained during the phase transition from solid to liquid by porous microstructures or polymeric networks, liquid PCMs still tended to diffuse to the surfaces of composites and then run off gradually.14 Encapsulating PCMs into hermetically sealed tiny containers was considered as another effective pathway to obtain a stable form or shape for solid–liquid PCMs. Such a packaging technology was defined as “microencapsulation”, and the resulting product was named as ‘microcapsules’.15 Microencapsulation technology can not only allow solid–liquid PCMs to keep a permanent macroscopic solid form even if a phase transmission from solid to liquid occurs, but also provide adequate protection for PCMs against harmful interaction and interference from the surrounding materials. Moreover, the formation of a sound microcapsule shell can supply a huge specific heat transfer surface for encapsulated PCMs and thus enhance heat transfer and the thermal response significantly.16 Therefore, compared to the formation of form-stable composite PCMs, microencapsulation of PCMs has been recognized as a more reliable packaging technology for solid–liquid PCMs.
The microencapsulation technology for solid–liquid PCMs has been developed over 30 years, and it has still received a great deal of attention to give numerous publications focusing on this issue. Fig. 2 demonstrates the development history of microencapsulated PCMs, which clearly indicates a significant advancement in the field of microencapsulation of PCMs. The future development of PCM-based microcapsules will not only concentrate on the fabrication of a traditional shell around the PCM core, but also design of a functional shell to impart multifunctional properties. These innovative designs and multifunctional applications of novel microencapsulated PCMs have been reported in recent five years. One of the prospective approaches to achieve additional functionalities for microencapsulated PCMs is the use of inorganic functional shell assembly on the PCM core. This technique not only permits additional functions (photocatalysis, antibiosis, magnetism, electrical conduction, photoluminescence, etc.) for microencapsulated PCMs along with the wall materials but also allows the formation of single or multilayered shells with various designed functions. Although there have been a huge number of review articles regarding microencapsulated PCMs for thermal energy-storage systems, they seldom provide a detailed review and systematic analysis for these new trends in the research and development of microencapsulated PCMs. Due to the absence of any compiled literature on the design idea and fabrication technology of novel types of microencapsulated PCMs, there is a need to highlight these new multifunctional PCM-based microcapsules. Aiming at innovative designs and versatile applications of microencapsulated PCMs in thermal energy storage and thermal management, this article reviews the research status of microencapsulation technology for solid–liquid PCMs and especially introduces diverse designs in detail for PCM-based microcapsules with various special functions. This is the first review article that makes noteworthy contributions to introduction of the innovation and originality of microencapsulated PCMs in design ideas, synthetic technology and application on the basis of the current published work. Moreover, an intensive analysis of the trend in development and applications of microencapsulated PCMs is also presented. This article will provide a deep insight for future research directions so as to extend the applications of PCMs to a broader range.

2 Microencapsulation technologies
2.1 Microencapsulation methods for PCMs
Microencapsulation is a physical or chemical process to engulf small liquid or solid particles of 1–100 μm diameter by a solid shell to achieve the desired characteristic performances of preservation, time-dependent release of materials, delivery of the substance to the specific target, reduction of reactions to the environment, prevention of corrosion, and stability of function and to facilitate the use of toxic materials. Anyway, the main purpose of microencapsulation is to provide protection for the core material and control material and energy exchange between the core and the external environment. As an emerging technique in the modern industry, microencapsulation technology has been applied in major fields such as medicine, food preservation, thermal energy storage, self-healing, catalysis, dyes, coatings, cosmetics, textiles, and defense.17 Microencapsulation is also considered as an effective method for the solid–liquid transition without any damage, leakage and environmental interaction of PCMs, both organic and inorganic, allowing their direct thermal energy-storage application.18 The microencapsulation of PCMs is a typical packaging technique by which solid–liquid PCMs can be encapsulated into wall materials through the chemical or physical process to give some small particles named as ‘microcapsules’.19 In a microcapsule, a PCM is designated as the core material while the wall material forms the shell shielding the PCM from the surrounding environment. The microcapsule size normally ranges from one micrometer to several millimeters. By now, novel encapsulation technologies have engulfed PCMs into a solid shell to produce some core–shell structured particles with a diameter in the nanometer range that are referred as to ‘nanocapsules’.20 Nanoencapsulation is one of the most promising solutions to increase the efficiency of both organic and inorganic PCMs. Moreover, the nanoencapsulation of PCMs promotes a high specific surface area, prevents exchange of the encapsulated material with the environment, controls heat exchange across the capsule shell and initiates congruent melting/crystallization due to the small core size, and therefore has been paid particular attention by researchers.21
Microencapsulated PCMs are generally classified into three basic categories as monocored, polycored and matrix types. The external morphology and internal structure of these PCM-containing microcapsules are strongly dependent on microencapsulation methods that are adopted as well as the selected wall materials. Fig. 3 shows the major microencapsulation methods for solid–liquid PCMs. The physical processes to obtain microencapsulated PCMs generally include spray drying, melt compounding, centrifugal coating and fluidized bed coating processes, which can only produce microcapsules with a particle size larger than 100 μm.22 The chemical processes mainly involve in situ and interfacial polymerization/polycondensation to fabricate a polymeric or inorganic shell on the PCM core.23 The formed microcapsules may normally have a spherical shape with a continuous shell surrounding the core, which can facilely handle PCMs as cores and tolerate phase changes including volume changes in their cores. Moreover, complex coacervation with gelatin or Arabic gum, interfacial precipitations to get inorganic precipitants like CaCO3, ZnO and Al(OH)3 as shells, the formation of monocored microcapsules due to the suspension polymerization of polystyrene (PS) or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resins with PCMs and other special reactive packaging processes are all involved in chemical processes. In general, the in situ reaction process has the ability to yield microcapsules with the best quality in terms of diffusion-tightness of their shells.14Table 1 gives a list of encapsulation modes commonly adopted for PCMs as well as the associated wall and core materials, and their research and development progress will be described in detail in the following sections.

2.2 Structural characterization of microencapsulated PCMs
Microencapsulated PCMs usually exhibit multicomponent and multiple structural characteristics due to their formation by combination of a variety of core and shell materials. Their total compositions can be roughly determined by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful means to accurately detect the chemical structures of polymeric shells of microencapsulated PCMs. Nevertheless, the core should be well extracted from the microcapsules with a suitable organic solvent before the NMR measurement, which can avoid the interference of unnecessary resonance signals from core materials on the NMR spectrum. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can be employed to trace the surface elemental composition and chemical structural composition on the shell of microencapsulated PCMs, whereas EDS mapping is used as an auxiliary means to vividly depict the elemental distribution of the microcapsule shell and the atomic mass ratios of elements in the wall material can also be obtained from both EDS and XPS measurements. Moreover, the chemical coordination of elements on the shell can be determined especially by XPS analysis through peak fitting. As for the case of some of the microencapsulated PCMs with multilayered or hybrid shells, their multiple structures can be distinguished by Raman scatting spectroscopy in a depth-profiling mode. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) is considered as a rapid analytical technique primarily used for crystalline phase identification of microencapsulated PCMs and can provide information on crystalline structures in crystal lattices for both the core and shell. Similar to the NMR measurement, solvent extraction should be conducted to remove the core of PCM-based microcapsules before the XRD measurement so that the XRD pattern of the shell could be clearly presented without any interference from the core.
The external morphology and internal structure of microencapsulated PCMs can be well characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Some useful information about the surface morphology, particle shape, approximate size and regularity of microencapsulated PCMs can be obtained from SEM observation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is often used to investigate the surface topography of a single microcapsule, from which the surface roughness and compactness of microencapsulated PCMs are identified. TEM characterization generally provides evidence of the core–shell structure for microencapsulated PCMs due to a distinct contrast in density between the core and shell. Furthermore, the shell thickness of microencapsulated PCMs can be determined from the TEM micrograph, whereas high-resolution TEM is able to identify the structural tightness of the shell. The core–shell structure can also be distinguished from the damaged microcapsules by SEM, and however a compression treatment toward microcapsules should be conducted to make them broken. Fig. 4 shows the typical micrographs of the microcapsules containing an n-eicosane core and TiO2 shell obtained from the aforementioned microscopic characterization reported by Chai et al.,24 which well demonstrates the external morphology and internal microstructure of microencapsulated PCMs. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) as an important surface analysis technique has a capability to obtain the topological surface images of microencapsulated PCMs at a nanometric resolution and therefore is usually used to inspect their surface morphological properties like smoothness, compactness, surface imperfection and bugs. In addition, the particle size distribution and mean diameter of microencapsulated PCMs can be facilely obtained either by measurement with a laser particle size analyzer or through image analysis of SEM micrographs using the relevant image analysis software.

2.3 Performance evaluation of microencapsulated PCMs
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is considered as a powerful tool for characterization of the comprehensive thermal performance of microencapsulated PCMs as well as pristine PCMs. DSC can constantly monitor and record the change of heat flux with time when a phase transition occurs in PCMs, and therefore the phase change temperatures for solidification and fusion and the associated phase change enthalpies can be accurately measured by DSC scans, in which the crystallization temperature (Tc) and melting temperature (Tm) are directly read from DSC thermograms and the crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc) and melting temperature (ΔHm) are obtained by a definite integral toward DSC thermograms. These data are the most important parameters reflecting the latent heat-storage capability and serving temperatures of microencapsulated PCMs. The encapsulation ratio (R) and encapsulation efficiency (E) of microencapsulated PCMs as two other important technical parameters describe the effective encapsulation of the PCM core by a wall material and their latent heat-storage/release efficiency, respectively, and can also be derived from DSC data using eqn (1) and (2).14 (1) (2)where ΔHc,PCM and ΔHm,PCM are the crystallization and melting enthalpies of pure PCMs, respectively, and ΔHc,MicroPCM and ΔHm,MicroPCM are the crystallization and melting enthalpies of microencapsulated PCMs, respectively. Furthermore, the thermal energy-storage capability (Ces) of microencapsulated PCMs can be calculated using eqn (3).14 (3)
The isothermal and nonisothermal solidification/fusion characteristics of microencapsulated PCMs are evaluated by programmed DSC scans at different temperatures and different scanning rates, respectively. The development of a relative degree of solidification/fusion as a function of time can be derived from isothermal DSC scans at the given temperature using eqn (4), whereas the one as a function of temperature can be obtained from nonisothermal DSC scans at the given scanning rate using eqn (5).25 (4) (5)where t and T are the arbitrary solidification/fusion time and temperature, respectively, and dH/dt is the heat flow resulting from crystallization/melting phase transitions. The obtained analysis results not only give lots of useful information about the heat-charging and discharging performance of microencapsulated PCMs under the isothermal and nonisothermal conditions, but also provide optimum operating parameters for thermal energy storage and thermal management. In addition, the phase change reversibility and resilience of microencapsulated PCMs are characterized by multicycle DSC scans, and their operational reliability and stability could be clearly determined by analyzing the fluctuations of phase change temperatures and phase change enthalpies for each heating–cooling loop after 200–500 cycle scans as reported by Shukla et al.26
The infrared thermographic technique commonly detects infrared radiation in the wavenumber range of 800–1400 nm and produces the images of radiation by using an infrared thermal imaging camera. Therefore, it is usually used to visibly identify the variation in temperature caused by thermal energy adsorption/release of microencapsulated PCMs when a phase change occurs. Moreover, the surface temperatures of microcapsules can be obtained from the analysis of infrared thermal images, which clearly demonstrate the thermal regulation effect of microencapsulated PCMs during the heating or cooling process. The infrared thermographic technique has been widely adopted to characterize the thermal energy-storage/release and thermal management performance of microencapsulated PCMs as reported by Wang et al.27 Some custom-designed experimental setups were also used to identify the practical latent heat-storage/release effectiveness of microencapsulated PCMs in the isothermal heating and cooling processes as described by Korti and Tlemsani.28 Two typical experimental setups are schematically illustrated in Fig. 5, in which a thermostatic water bath is usually employed as a heat source while an infrared or xenon lamp can also be used to simulate natural lighting to generate infrared heat radiation.29 The temperature evolution as a function of time can be obtained from the detection by a K-type thermocouple and recording by a temperature recorder. As reported by Zhang et al.,30 there was a temperature lag observed in the plot of temperature evolution during the isothermal heating and cooling processes due to the latent heat absorption and release by phase transitions, indicating an effective thermal regulation capability of microencapsulated PCMs. In addition, Huang et al.31 also reported a new temperature history to characterize the thermal performance of medium-temperature PCMs for solar thermal energy storage. In this methodology, the phase change temperatures, latent heat, supercooling degree and specific heat capacity of PCMs could be measured with an improved accuracy. Other unconventional experimental technologies available for thermal performance characterization of PCMs were introduced by Cabeza et al.,32 which included various experimental setups and methods developed by different research centers and universities to analyze thermophysical properties such as specific heat, latent heat, fusion and solidification temperatures, thermal conductivity, and heat transfer and diffusivity performance of PCMs and their microcapsules.

Besides the experimental evaluations of thermal performance, some mathematical modeling and simulation methods were also applied to analyze the heat conduction, transfer and diffusion performance of PCM-based microcapsule systems. Soni et al.34 reported a comprehensive investigation on the constrained melting process of PCMs within the microcapsules and analyzed in detail a very interesting phenomenon of the formation of thermal plumes and multiple counter-rotating vortices in the lower part of the microcapsule during the initial melting stage as depicted in Fig. 6. Kumarasamy et al.35 reported a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis of microencapsulated PCMs on the basis of conduction dominant numerical schemes, and they developed a novel CFD-based model to predict the heat-temperature responses and liquid volume fraction of an in-house fabricated PCM-microcapsule system as illustrated in Fig. 7, which was validated by the experimental DSC results of the in-house prepared PCM-based microcapsules. Moreover, Yu et al.36 established a thermo-mechanical model to analyze the heat transfer behavior and mechanical stability of microencapsulated PCMs for cryogenic-temperature cold storage by taking into account energy conservation, pressure-dependent solid–liquid equilibria, Lamé's equations and buckling theory.

The thermal stability of microencapsulated PCMs is normally characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and their thermal degradation behaviors could be clearly shown in the resulting TGA thermograms. In general, the shell could prevent the evaporation of the PCM core successfully, thus leading to an improvement in thermal degradation temperature of microencapsulated PCMs. Additionally, the char yield obtained from the TGA result is directly associated with the weight fraction of PCMs encapsulated in microcapsules, and therefore TGA is also used to evaluate the encapsulation ratio of microencapsulated PCMs. The methodologies for the chemical stability related to the fire test and the chemical compatibility between the PCM core and shell were also described in detail by Fernández et al.37 Anti-osmosis performance is a very important property for microencapsulated PCMs, which reflects the tightness of wall materials to prevent the permeation of the PCM core out of microcapsules. Anti-osmosis performance is usually characterized by the weight loss rate of the microcapsule specimen after the extraction of the PCM core with petroleum ether or ester as an extraction solvent. The weight loss rate can be measured by the difference of transmittance of the microcapsule suspension before and after solvent extraction using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The low weight loss rate represents high anti-permeability for microencapsulated PCMs to gain long-term working durability.38 The mechanical properties of microencapsulated PCMs could be evaluated by AFM in a force-spectroscopic mode using the AFM probe as a nanoindenter. Giro-Paloma et al.39 reported this methodology and clearly presented the test mechanism and force evolution with probe penetration into a microcapsule specimen as shown in Fig. 8. The mean hardness and Young’s modulus for individual microcapsules could be obtained from this method with a statistic approach at a nanometric scale. Neubauer et al.40 reported a micromanipulation technique for mechanical measurement of a single microcapsule with a diameter in the range of 1–800 μm as described in Fig. 9. This technique not only achieved an enhanced force sensitivity but also allowed for observation of the deformation of a single microcapsule with an optical microscope. Moreover, Su et al.41 also developed a custom-designed sandwich compression setup to measure the mechanical response of microcapsules with a high-resolution pressure sensor under a fixed pressure, and a typical stress–strain curve was achieved to give various mechanical data of microencapsulated PCMs.

3 Microencapsulation of PCMs with polymeric shells
The wall materials play a key role in determining the sealing effectiveness and thermal energy-storage/release performance of PCM-based microcapsules, because they can not only provide a barrier and protection for the PCM core without getting adversely affected by the environment through which the core passes, but also supply a huge heat transfer area for the encapsulated PCM due to their much larger specific surface areas compared to bulk PCMs. An ideal wall material should meet several criteria as follows: (1) an inertial nature to support a stable phase transition of the PCM core without any reaction with wall materials, (2) sufficient tightness and mechanical strength to prevent the PCM core from leakage and running off, (3) a good thermal stability to provide an enough high upper operating temperature for the encapsulated PCMs, (4) good anti-osmosis properties to ensure a long-term working lifespan for microencapsulated PCMs, (5) a high thermal conductivity to keep a prompt thermal response for the PCM core. A diverse range of materials, including organic polymers, bio-based materials, inorganic materials, composite/hybrid materials and metals, have been employed as wall materials for microencapsulation of PCMs to form microcapsules with a well-defined core–shell structure. Table 1 gives a literature survey and detailed specifications for microencapsulated PCMs with different shells. Organic polymers are considered as a type of most commonly used wall materials for the synthesis of PCM-based microcapsules. There have been a huge number of published papers since the early 1990s that report about the synthesis, characterization, and performance of microencapsulated PCMs with a variety of polymeric shells. These wall materials covered poly(melamine-formaldehyde) (PMF) resin, poly(urea-formaldehyde) (PUF), polyurea (PUA), polyurethane (PU), poly(urea-urethane), PMMA, acrylate copolymers, PS and its copolymers, polyaniline (PANi), organosilica resins and many more. These studies indicated that the encapsulation efficiency of microencapsulated PCMs was strongly related to the synthetic technology as well as the composition of core and wall materials, and the phase change enthalpies roughly increased with an improvement of encapsulation efficiency. It can be inferred that the type of polymeric shell plays a key role in determining the thermal properties of microencapsulated PCMs, whereas the characteristics of polymeric shells such as molecular weight and distribution, crosslinking degree, shell thickness and tightness, stiffness, mechanical strength and volume expansion rate influence the thermal energy-storage performance, thermal stability, phase transition recoverability, and thermal reliability and durability of the corresponding microencapsulated PCMs. Moreover, small size microcapsules with polymer shells are found to have a better structural stability.

As a cost effective and facilely available polymeric material, PMF has been broadly used for microencapsulation of various organic and inorganic PCMs due to its unique inherent properties including good sealing tightness, water resistance, sealing endurance and fire resistance, and it has attracted a great deal of attention from researchers and engineers since 2000. In general, the synthesis of microencapsulated PCMs with a PMF shell involves an in situ polymerization process, which usually contains four steps as shown in Fig. 10:42 (1) formation of oil/water (O/W) emulsion, (2) preparation of a melamine–formaldehyde prepolymer mixture, (3) addition of the prepolymer mixture into the O/W emulsion system for encapsulation of the PCM core, and (4) collection and post-processing of the target product. Choi et al.43 reported the microencapsulation of tetradecane as an organic PCM with PMF by emulsion polymerization and their work indicated that the mixing speed was one of the most important factors determining the particle size and size distribution of the resulting microcapsules. Fan et al.44 prepared a series of PCM-based microcapsules by encapsulating n-octadecane and nucleating agents with the PMF shell. This study demonstrated that the incorporation of sodium chloride, 1-octadecanol, and paraffin into a microcapsule system had different influences on the morphology, dispersibility, and melting and crystallization behaviors of microencapsulated n-octadecane, whereas the supercooling of microencapsulated n-octadecane was prevented by the addition of these three additives. To improve the mechanical performance of the PMF wall material, Su et al.45,46 conducted a series of investigations on the chemical modification of the PMF shell with hydrolyzed SMA and methanol during the synthetic process of microencapsulated paraffin-type PCMs and observed a significant enhancement in compressive properties and compactness of the shell. Su and co-workers47 also investigated the deformation of microencapsulated paraffin with the PMF shell by taking the yield point as an important parameter and found that the yield point of microcapsules decreased with an increase of temperature due to an increased internal pressure of the core. Li et al.48 employed PMF as a shell and n-octadecane as a core to synthesize a microencapsulated PCM through in situ polymerization and found that the globular surface of the microcapsules became smoother and the thermal stability increased with the decrease of dropping rate of the MF prepolymer. To improve the impact toughness of PCM-based microcapsules, Zhang et al.42 used resorcinol as an impact modifier to reduce the brittleness and rigidity of the PMF shell and enhance the performance of PCM microcapsules accordingly. They found that a sodium salt of the styrene–maleic anhydride (SMA) copolymer as an emulsifier could provide a regular spherical shape and smooth shell for the resultant microcapsules, and this microcapsule system achieved good phase change properties and high encapsulation efficiency. Cao et al.49 developed a new method for supercooling suppression of microencapsulated PCMs without adding any nucleation agent by optimizing the composition and structure of the PMF shell. They synthesized microcapsules containing n-octadecane through in situ polymerization using PMF as a wall material and sodium dodecylsulfate as an emulsifier. The as-synthesized microcapsules not only presented a well-defined core–shell structure with a diameter of 5–15 μm, but also achieved a large latent heat-storage capacity of 213 J g−1, which was significantly higher than those of microcapsule systems that used nucleating agents.

According to the literature, most of the studies on microencapsulated PCMs with a PMF shell have focused on the fabrication route, latent heat storage and microstructure control in the early research stage, but few of them involved their applications and functional diversity. Su et al.50 developed a type of microencapsulated paraffin with a methanol-modified PMF shell for application in gypsum-matrix building materials for thermal energy storage and found that the resulting gypsum composite could store time-dependent and intermittent solar energy effectively. More recently, to overcome some of the disadvantages of microencapsulated PCMs with the PMF shell, such as poor thermal response and instability of melting temperatures during long-term storage operation, Su and co-workers51 focused on the development of a novel high temperature microencapsulated paraffin wax with the PMF shell for application in a compacted water saturated fixed bed system. The experimental results reflected that, compared to conventional water storage tanks, storage units based on the microcapsules had an enhanced thermal stability, much higher thermal conductivity and energy storage density and then were expected to be more responsive to temperature during the solar thermal energy charging and discharging processes. Zhang et al.52 developed a UV-curable coating technology for flame-retardant microcapsules based on the paraffin core and PMF shell with epoxy acrylate and dimethyl methyl phosphonate, and the resulting microcapsules presented an improvement in thermal stability and flame retardancy as a result of the formation of a UV-cured protection layer. Su et al.41 also developed microencapsulated lauryl alcohol with a PMF/PUF double-layered shell and observed an enhancement in mechanical performance and thermal stability. In addition, Wei et al.53 proposed an asphalt binder modified with microcapsules containing an n-tetradecane core and PMF shell for enhancing the storage stability, temperature-adjustable performance and physical properties. They found that the addition of PCM-based microcapsules as a modifier could effectively regulate the temperature of the asphalt binder system without considerably effects on the physical properties of the modified asphalt. This proposed system presented a potential application in the field of road engineering.
3.2 Microencapsulation of PCMs with PUF and PUA
PUF and PUA resins are other types of commonly used wall materials for microencapsulation of PCMs, because they can offer a more flexible and tough shell for the PCM core. In general, microencapsulated PCMs with a PUF shell were synthesized by using urea and formaldehyde as precursors through in situ polymerization. This synthetic route was clearly described by Jin et al.54 using an easily understandable scheme shown in Fig. 11. As seen in this scheme, an emulsion containing a paraffin PCM as an oil phase was first prepared with the aid of SMA as a surfactant. When surfactant molecules were adsorbed at the interfaces of paraffin oil droplets, the charged region was exposed to the aqueous phase. This molecular arrangement could generate a relatively strong electronegative field to provide a better stability for the emulsion against coalescence. The anionic surfactant facilitated a favorable absorption of the UF prepolymer by a strong charged interaction, followed by in situ polycondensation to form a compact shell on the PCM core. The resultant microcapsules were found to be sufficiently robust to keep a powder form during the phase changes of the PCM core. Sarier and Onder55 also designed four types of PMF-based microcapsules containing different waxes for use in thermally enhanced fabrics and successfully synthesized them through in situ polycondensation using resorcinol as a binder. These microencapsulated PCMs were observed to exhibit passive insulation characteristics under the given cold weather and physical activity conditions. In most cases, nano-sized capsules were easily formed when PMF was used to encapsulate PCMs, and this issue will be discussed later. On the other hand, the PUA shell could be fabricated on the PCM core by the reaction of isocyanate with various polyamines through an interfacial polymerization route. Cho et al.56 microencapsulated octadecane within a PUA shell by the reaction of toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) with diethylenetriamine through interfacial polymerization in an emulsion system. Chen et al.57 also synthesized microencapsulated butyl stearate with the PUA shell by interfacial polymerization using TDI and ethylenediamine as monomers, and the resulting microcapsules only achieved a fusion enthalpy of 80 J g−1. Zhang and Wang58 investigated the effect of different soft segments of the PUA shell on the morphology and thermal energy-storage performance of microencapsulated n-octadecane obtained from interfacial polymerization using TDI as an oil-soluble monomer and various amines as water-soluble monomers. They found that microcapsules synthesized with Jeffamine as an amine monomer exhibited a better latent heat-storage capability and a smoother and tighter shell than those with other amines. Considering a high toxicity of TDI, Zhan et al.59 developed a new type of PUA-microencapsulated paraffin PCM by an interfacial polymerization method using isophorone diisocyanate as a raw material to replace TDI and observed a phase change enthalpy of 92.5 J g−1 for the resultant microcapsules with a core loading of 44.5 wt%.

Besides PUF and PUA resins, some of their copolymers were also reported to be used as wall materials for microencapsulation of PCMs. Konuklu et al.60 developed a type of microcapsule based on the capric acid core and poly(melamine-urea-formaldehyde) (PMUF) shell by a one-step in situ polymerization technique and found that the resulting microcapsules exhibited a higher latent heat-storage capacity than those with a PUF shell and a better thermal stability than those with a PMF shell. Konuklu and co-workers61 also compared the encapsulation efficiency and thermal performance of microencapsulated capric acid with different shells including PMF, PUF and PMUF. They observed that the microcapsules with the PUF shell presented a higher latent heat-storage capacity than the other two. Ma et al.62 performed the microencapsulation of butyl stearate and paraffin as binary cores with a PUA/PU double-layered shell via interfacial polymerization and investigated the effect of different soft segments of the wall material on the formation and phase change properties of the binary-core microcapsules. They observed a good thermal stability and long-term working durability for this type of microcapsule. Yoo et al.63 encapsulated methyl laurate into the poly(urea-urethane) matrix composite containing hydrophobized cellulose nanocrystals (hCNC) through interfacial polymerization in the in situ emulsion process. Due to the introduction of hCNC into the polymeric wall material, the microcapsules obtained a highly rigid shell, which could provide a barrier enhancement against the osmotic release of methyl laurate. Moreover, De Castro et al.64 synthesized microencapsulated n-docosane with a PU shell by the reaction of TDI with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) through miniemulsion interfacial polymerization and clearly demonstrated the effect of the confined volume on the morphology, crystallinity, heat transfer and thermal stability of the microencapsulated PCM.
3.3 Microencapsulation of PCMs with PMMA and acrylate copolymers
PMMA has also been broadly used as a wall material for the synthesis of PCM-based microcapsules due to its moderate properties, high mechanical strength, easy handling and processing, and non-toxicity. Sarı and co-workers conducted a series of significant research studies on the fabrication and performance of PCM-microcapsules using PMMA as a shell and a number of n-alkanes as cores. They investigated the microencapsulation technology with PMMA through emulsion polymerization for various paraffin-type PCMs including docosane,65n-octacosane66 and n-heptadecane.67 These microencapsulated PCMs presented a broad range of latent heats during the fusion and solidification processes and good thermal reliability after repeated 5000 thermal cycles. Furthermore, Sarı et al.68,69 also investigated the microencapsulation of a series of paraffin eutectic mixtures including heptadecane–tetracosane, nonadecane–octadecane, nonadecane–octadecane, nonadecane–tetracosane, eicosane–tetracosane and heneicosane–octacosane eutectics with PMMA for enhancement of thermal energy-storage capacity. These microencapsulated paraffin eutectics not only showed a diverse melting temperature range from 20 to 60 °C with improved latent heat-storage capacities but also exhibited a good chemical stability and thermal durability. In addition to the aforementioned research studies, there are some other reports about PCM-based microcapsules with the PMMA shell. Taguchi et al.70 developed a novel type of elasticity-tunable microcapsule based on the oil absorbable polymer/n-pentadecane core and PMMA shell through emulsion polymerization, and they observed an improvement in the mechanical properties of the resulting microcapsules with increasing the amount of MMA absorbed by the oil absorbable polymer. Ma et al.71 developed a UV irradiation-initiated polymerization technology of PMMA to prepare microencapsulated paraffin and found that the resultant microcapsules had a fairly high core loading of 61.2 wt%. To enhance the mechanical strength, Al-Shannaq et al.72 investigated the crosslinking reinforcement for the PMMA shell of microencapsulated paraffin by means of suspension polymerization using pentaerythritol tetraacrylate as a crosslinker and observed that the resulting microcapsules exhibited a comprehensive improvement in shell permeability and thermal stability as well as in surface smoothness. PMMA can also be used as a wall material for microencapsulation of inorganic PCMs in addition to the organic ones. Huang et al.73 adopted a suspension copolymerization–solvent volatile method to prepare microcapsules containing the Na2HPO4·7H2O core and PMMA shell. The resulting microcapsules presented a latent heat-storage capacity of 150 J g−1 with a reduced supercooling degree. Wang et al.74 also reported the microencapsulation of Na2HPO4·12H2O with a crosslinked PMMA shell and achieved a reasonable latent heat-storage capacity of 142.9 J g−1 for the resultant microcapsules.
It is well known that MMA is a very popular and commercially available acrylate monomer and can be copolymerized with various other acrylate monomers to create a number of acrylate copolymers with improved properties such as thermal stability, impact toughness, mechanical strength, rigidity, chemical resistance and water proof. Qiu et al.75–78 made a series of investigations on the synthesis of microencapsulated paraffin-type PCMs with a variety of MMA-based acrylate copolymers. They not only explored the microencapsulation technology of PCMs with the crosslinked MMA-based copolymer shell using different acrylate crosslinkers, but also investigated the synthesis and performance of microencapsulated PCMs with shells based on the acrylate copolymers of MMA with butyl acrylate (BA), butyl methacrylate (BMA), lauryl methacrylate (LMA), ethyl acrylate (EA), stearyl methacrylate and divinylbenzene (DVB). These studies provided important information about optimum crosslinkers and comonomers for the synthesis of microencapsulated PCMs with MMA-based copolymer shells through suspension-like polymerization. Moreover, Lashgari et al.79 developed a type of microcapsule based on the n-hexadecane core and poly(MMA-co-BA) shell through suspension polymerization, and the obtained microcapsules exhibited a flexibility in the shell due to the incorporation of the BA soft segment into the PMMA macromolecules. Ma et al.80 designed a novel type of PCM-based microcapsule with a phase change temperature-adjustable function, and they fabricated binary-core microcapsules with butyl stearate and paraffin as PCMs and poly(MMA-co-DVB) as a shell through in situ polymerization. In this microcapsule system, the phase change temperature could be tuned by adjusting the mass ratio of butyl stearate and paraffin. Li et al.81 investigated the effect of N-isopropylacrylamide as a thermosensitive monomer on the formation mechanism, morphology and thermal performance of microencapsulated n-octadecane with a crosslinked MMA-based copolymer shell. They found that the introduction of N-isopropylacrylamide greatly improved the latent heat-storage capacity of microcapsules due to the heterogeneous nucleation effect. In addition, Konuklu82 reported the synthesis of microencapsulated caprylic acid with an EA shell using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as a crosslinker through emulsion polymerization, and the resultant microcapsules showed a good thermal reliability for thermal energy storage applications.
3.4 Microencapsulation of PCMs with PS and its copolymers
Similar to PMMA, polystyrene is also a facilely available polymer widely employed as a wall material for the microencapsulation of PCMs due to its non-toxic, easy to handle and process, and cost-effective characteristics. Mochane and Luyt83 conducted the encapsulation of the paraffin core with a PS shell to prepare PCM-based microcapsules through emulsion polymerization, and the obtained microcapsules were found to exhibit good latent heat storage/release properties when embedded in the polypropylene matrix. Sánchez et al.84,85 adopted a suspension polymerization method to synthesize microencapsulated paraffin with the PS shell and investigated the effects of reaction temperature, stirring rate, and mass ratio of paraffin wax to styrene on the properties of the as-synthesized microcapsules. Sarı et al.86 reported the synthesis and performance investigation of PCM-based microcapsules with n-heptadecane as a core and PS as a shell, and they found that the resultant microcapsules achieved a high heat-storage capacity of 136.89 J g−1 as well as a reasonable thermal conductivity when the mass ratio of the core and shell was set to 1/2. Sarı and co-workers87 further investigated the microencapsulation of fatty acids with PS by an emulsion polymerization method and also observed a reasonable latent heat-storage capability and good thermal durability for the as-synthesized microcapsules. Döğüşcü et al.88 developed a new thermal energy-storage material by encapsulating the palmitic–capric acid eutectic as a PCM into the PS shell and confirmed its usability in building materials. Konuklu et al.89 also used PS to encapsulate caprylic acid as a PCM through an emulsion polymerization route and found that the PS shell could effectively reduce the volatility of the caprylic acid core. Most recently, Sami et al.90 reported the microencapsulation of lauric acid as a renewable PCM (obtained from vegetable oils) with PS through emulsion polymerization. In this work, a response surface optimization method was used to optimize the design of synthetic processes and conditions.
As the most widely used wall material, PS seems to have weak compressive strength due to its brittle nature, so microencapsulated PCMs with the PS shell are easily damaged under a slight pressure. In this case, the copolymerization of styrene (St) with other comonomers is considered as a promising route for mechanical enhancement of the PS-based shell. Sánchez-Silva et al.91 fabricated PCM-based microcapsules by encapsulating paraffin into a poly(St-co-MMA) shell through suspension-like polymerization and investigated the effect of the monomers/paraffin and MMA/St mass ratios on the encapsulation efficiency and thermal performance of the resultant microcapsules. They determined an MMA/St mass ratio of 4/1 and a monomers/paraffin ratio of 3/1 as the optimum formulation for the synthesis of this type of microcapsule. Giro-Paloma et al.92 proposed a copolymerization modification for microencapsulated paraffin or palmitic acid by fabrication of a poly(St-co-EA) shell through emulsion copolymerization, and there was a significant improvement in plastic deformation observed for the as-synthesized microcapsules due to the incorporation of an EA soft segment. Wan et al.93 designed a novel type of microencapsulated PCM with a pliable self-recovering shell by encapsulating paraffin into a poly(St-co-AA-co-BA) shell, and they successfully fabricated microcapsules through in situ polymerization combined with a hydrothermal process. The synthetic route and self-recovering mechanism are illustrated in Fig. 12. As depicted in this scheme, the flexible shell provided a larger expansion volume for the PCM core to expand and shrink inside microcapsules than traditional polymeric shells. In this case, the shell deformations caused by expansion and shrinkage could quickly recover after being soaked in water without a loss of latent heat-storage capacity. You et al.94 synthesized microencapsulated n-octadecane with poly(St-co-DVB) by means of suspension-like polymerization first and then incorporated it into PU foams for thermal regulation. They observed a latent heat capacity of 24 J g−1 for the PU foams containing 26.5 wt% of the as-synthesized microcapsules. Furthermore, they investigated the effects of stirring rate and mass ratio of monomers/n-octadecane on the particle size and phase change properties of the microcapsules and determined the optimum synthetic conditions for large-scale production.95

3.5 Microencapsulation of PCMs with other polymers
Besides the conventionally used wall materials mentioned above, there are a few other polymers that were reported for microencapsulation of PCMs. These specific polymeric wall materials can offer some characteristic properties for the resulting microencapsulated PCMs. Zhang et al.96 reported the synthesis and performance investigation of novel microcapsules with stearic acid as a core and polycarbonate (PC) as a shell by a solution casting method. Their study indicated that the incorporation of iron filings into the PCM core effectively improved the heat storage/release rates and thermal conductivity of the resulting microcapsules when the PC shell provided a thermal protection for the PCM core. Do et al.97 designed a type of microencapsulated PCM with a water-absorbable shell by encapsulating paraffin wax into poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA). They successfully fabricated the microcapsules with a high thermal energy-storage efficiency of 99% through Pickering emulsion polymerization and observed an effective enhancement in thermal conductivity due to the formation of a hydrous-flexible polymer shell. Fortuniak et al.98 synthesized microencapsulated n-eicosane with a polysiloxane shell by a co-emulsification method and also introduced a new thermo-optical method to investigate the phase change behavior of the microencapsulated PCM according to the transmittance of the microcapsule specimen. Fu et al.99 developed a novel microfluidic approach to encapsulate n-hexadecyl bromide with an elastic silicone shell, by which double oil1-in-oil2-in-water capsules with a core–shell geometry were fabricated. With an acceptable latent heat-storage capacity of around 78 J g−1, the as-prepared microcapsules showed a considerable expansion volume due to the fabrication of an elastic silicone shell. Silakhori et al.100 reported the synthesis of paraffin-based microcapsules through in situ polymerization using polyaniline (PANi) as an eco-friendly wall material and found that the thermal stability of microencapsulated paraffin was improved by fabrication of the PANi shell. Zeng et al.101 also encapsulated palmitic acid into the PANi shell and investigated the effects of polymerization temperature and time, oxidant concentration and acid dopants on the morphology and thermal performance of microcapsules. The optimum polymerization conditions were determined for this type of microencapsulated PCM by their work.
4 Microencapsulation of PCMs with organic–inorganic composite shells
Although polymeric shells can effectively prevent the PCM cores from leaking and running off during the solid–liquid phase change process and offer a high degree of structural flexibility for encapsulated solid–liquid PCMs, there are some limitations for encapsulated PCMs with polymeric wall materials due to the low thermal conductivity, poor thermal and chemical stability of polymeric shells. Generally, inorganic compounds have much better chemical, mechanical and thermal stabilities than the organic ones. Therefore, it is believed that the use of composite wall materials composed of organic polymers and inorganic compounds can improve the properties of encapsulated PCMs. There are many methods that have been explored for the introduction of inorganic materials into microcapsule systems based on polymeric shells, including the dispersion of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, utilization of modified metal oxides as surface stabilizers, incorporation of carbon-based nanomaterials and so on. There is no doubt that the selection of organic/inorganic combination is the critical factor affecting the thermal properties and latent heat-storage capability of microencapsulated PCMs, and the proportion of inorganic components should be strictly limited in wall materials to avoid deterioration in the mechanical strength and tightness of composite shells.
4.1 Microencapsulation of PCMs with polymer/inorganic particle composites
Silica nanoparticles are commonly used as an inorganic filler for polymer matrix wall materials due to their nontoxic, readily available and structurally stable properties as well as a well-defined surface. Therefore, incorporating silica into polymeric wall materials can create a fascinating class of microcapsule shells by integrating both the physical and chemical properties of organic polymeric wall materials and inorganic silica. Chang et al.102 reported the microencapsulation of n-octadecane with a PMMA network–SiO2 hybrid shell based on the suspension polymerization process of MMA and the sol–gel process of TEOS. They investigated the effect of inorganic/organic shell ratio on the latent heat-storage capability of microcapsules and found that a maximum latent heat of 180 J g−1 was achieved for the microcapsules when the shell contained 5 wt% of silica. Li et al.103 also synthesized microencapsulated n-octadecane with an organic–inorganic silica hybrid shell through emulsion co-polymerization of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (MPS) and vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS). The as-synthesized microcapsules exhibited a considerably high phase-change enthalpy of up to 169 J g−1 at an optimum MPS/VTMS mass ratio of 2/6. Yin et al.104 proposed a new encapsulation method for microencapsulated dodecanol with the covalently bonded polymer/SiO2 hybrid as a shell through Pickering emulsion polymerization, in which SiO2 nanoparticles were employed as a unique surface stabilizer via hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS, followed by copolymerization of St and DVB to form a poly(St-co-DVB)/SiO2 shell. Their investigation results demonstrated that the Pickering emulsion polymerization was a simple and feasible method for incorporation of inorganic materials into PCM-based microcapsules with polymeric shells, and the resulting organic–inorganic composite shell could achieve a much better endurance and sealing tightness for microencapsulated PCMs than the pristine polymeric one. Wang et al.27 also carried out the synthesis of organic–inorganic hybrid materials to microencapsulate PCMs. According to their synthetic route shown in Fig. 13, they chose surface-modified SiO2 and TiC nanoparticles as Pickering stabilizers and thermal conductivity additives and conducted the Pickering emulsion polymerization of MMA monomers to encapsulate n-octadecane. Their research results confirmed that the microencapsulated n-octadecane with the polymer–SiO2/TiC hybrid shell exhibited good thermal energy-storage performance with enhanced thermal conductivity and thermal stability. Similar to the work by Wang et al., Su and co-workers105 employed nanosilicon dioxide hydrosol as a surfactant for the encapsulation of n-octadecane because of its combination of good latent heat-storage performance and excellent thermal stability and successfully fabricated microcapsules with a PMF/SiO2 composite shell through in situ polymerization. Their study confirmed that the introduction of nanosilicon dioxide hydrosol enhanced the core loading and the shell integrity. Gao et al.106 developed a facile method to fabricate microencapsulated paraffin with a poly(St-co-DVB)/SiO2 composite shell by a combination of suspension emulsion polymerization and hydrolysis/condensation reactions. It was found that the incorporation of SiO2 particles into the shell could improve the thermal stability of microencapsulated paraffin, because the polymer–SiO2 hybrid shells effectively prevented the paraffin core from evaporating. Ng et al.107 performed the microencapsulation of paraffin with a PMMA/SiO2 hybrid shell through mini-suspension polymerization with MMA and triethoxyvinylsilane as comonomers, and they observed much higher latent heat-storage and release rates due to the improvement of thermal conduction in the presence of inorganic silica. Wang et al.108 further developed a photocurable Pickering emulsion polymerization method to fabricate microencapsulated n-octadecane with the PMMA/SiO2 hybrid shell. This new methodology provided a facile and low-energy synthetic strategy for the construction of microencapsulated PCMs with a wide variety of organic–inorganic hybrid shells. Moreover, aiming at the enhancement of the anti-osmosis performance of the microencapsulated PCM, Feczkó et al.109 prepared microcapsules based on silica-coated polymer beads containing paraffin and cetyl alcohol as PCMs. As shown in Fig. 14, they first synthesized PCM-loaded beads with microporous poly(ethylenedimethacrylate) (PEMDA) by a suspension polymerization technique, and then the beads were coated with a silica shell using trimethoxy(methyl)silane (TMMS) as a silicon source. There was no leakage of PCMs from the microcapsules found after 1000 heating–cooling cycles.

In addition to SiO2, other inorganic nanoparticles were also reported to meet the requirement of thermal performance enhancement for microencapsulation of PCMs with organic–inorganic hybrid shells. Daou et al.110 investigated the fabrication and performance of microencapsulated paraffin by incorporating Fe2O3, ZnO, and TiO2 nanoparticles into PUF to form an organic–inorganic hybrid shell via in situ polymerization. They observed that the presence of metal oxide nanoparticles tended to hinder the degradation of the PUF shell and enhance the thermal stability of the microcapsules accordingly. Similarly, Pethurajan and Sivan111 also synthesized microencapsulated paraffin with metal oxide nanoparticles (Al2O3, CuO and TiO2) suspended inside the PUF shell using ultrasound-assisted in situ polymerization, and they found that CuO nanoparticles could lead to a faster heat transfer for the as-synthesized microcapsules than the other two metal oxide nanoparticles. Li et al.112 developed a facile emulsion method to encapsulate n-octadecane with a PMMA/TiO2 shell by using UV-radiation to initiate polymerization, and the resultant microcapsules exhibited a high latent heat-storage capacity, reduced supercooling degree, and enhanced thermal stability and thermal conduction. Furthermore, Chen et al.113 successfully fabricated a hybrid shell based on PMF and Al2O3 nanoparticles on the paraffin core through predispersion of Al2O3 nanoparticles in the MF prepolymer solution, followed by in situ polymerization. They observed an improvement in phase change temperatures and thermal stability in the presence of Al2O3 nanoparticles. These studies explicitly suggested an effective enhancement in thermal conduction for microencapsulated PCMs due to the incorporation of highly thermally conductive inorganic nanoparticles into polymeric shells.
As a sort of highly thermally conductive inorganic powder, Si3N4 was widely used for thermal conductivity enhancement of polymers. Sun et al.114 adopted Si3N4 nanoparticles as a thermally conductive additive to fabricate microencapsulated paraffin with a poly(MMA-co-MA)/Si3N4 hybrid shell by Pickering emulsion polymerization via the synthetic route depicted in Fig. 15. A significant improvement in thermal conduction was observed in the resulting microcapsules with high encapsulation efficiency and a desirable microstructure. Yang et al.115 also reported the application of Si3N4 for enhancement in the thermal performance of microencapsulated n-octadecane with a PMMA shell and confirmed that the incorporation of Si3N4 nanoparticles into the PMMA shell could effectively improve the thermal conductivity, thermal reliability and latent heat-storage capability. Sun et al.116 further developed a type of novel microcapsule with enhanced thermal conductivity by encapsulating paraffin into the PMMA/BN/TiO2 hybrid shell and found that the resulting microcapsules present excellent thermal performance with an improvement by 115% in thermal conductivity compared to those with a net PMMA shell. A similar study was reported by Taguchi and co-workers,117 and SiC powder was introduced into the polymeric shell to enhance the thermal conduction of microencapsulated PCMs in their study. They successfully fabricated microcapsules with a paraffin core and PUA/SiC hybrid shell through interfacial polymerization in a Pickering emulsion system and also confirmed a remarkable enhancement in thermal conductivity and heat transfer. In addition, Song et al.118 also incorporated silver nanoparticles into the polymeric shell of microcapsules with bromo-hexadecane as a PCM core through in situ polymerization and observed a considerable improvement in thermal stability as a result of mechanical enhancement of wall materials by silver nanoparticles. Recently, Lu et al.119 developed a type of novel core–sheath structured thermoregulatory smart textile based on a paraffin wax core and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) sheath by a coaxial electrospinning technique. According to the operating mechanism shown in Fig. 16, hexagonal cesium tungsten bronze (Cs0.32WO3) was introduced into the sheath so as to improve the solar energy utilization efficiency of the textiles. The as-prepared textile exhibited a high latent heat-storage capacity and good phase change stability, indicating its great application potential in thermoregulatory clothes and garments.

4.2 Microencapsulation of PCMs with carbon-based polymeric composites
Micro/nano-structured carbon-based materials have an extremely high thermal conductivity as well as a relatively low density. The incorporation of carbon-based materials into the polymeric shell of microencapsulated PCMs can improve their thermal conductivity evidently and meanwhile minimize the variation of their latent heat capacity. Therefore, there have been an increasing number of studies focusing on the preparation and performance characterization of PCM-based microcapsules integrated with carbon-based materials in recent years. Li et al.120 investigated the modification of the PMMA shell with expanded graphite for microencapsulated n-octadecane by suspension-like polymerization and observed a significant enhancement in thermal conductivity and thermal energy-storage capability but a reduction in supercooling degree. Cui et al.121 also prepared graphite-modified microcapsules containing a paraffin core and PUF shell through interfacial polymerization for improvement of thermal conductivity and further investigated their thermal regulation performance in cement mortar. They clearly observed that the hydration heat of cement mortar was delayed and its thermal cracking was reduced due to the presence of the graphite-modified microencapsulated paraffin. Liu et al.29 conducted an experimental investigation on the preparation and thermal performance of microencapsulated paraffin with the PMF shell embedded with graphite nanoparticles through an emulsion-templated in situ polycondensation route as depicted in Fig. 17. The as-prepared microcapsules exhibited enhanced photo-thermal conversion properties when dispersed in an ionic liquid to form a novel latent functional thermal fluid. Besides graphite-based nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have also received increasing interest for the modification of microencapsulated PCMs due to their unique electronic properties, high thermal conductivities and good mechanical stability. Li et al.122 reported the application of CNTs in the synthesis of microencapsulated stearyl alcohol with a PUF shell by grafting CNTs into the stearyl alcohol core, and they observed a remarkable enhancement in thermal conductance and heat transfer as a result of modification of the PCM core. Huang et al.123 designed a new type of CNT-enhanced double-walled microencapsulated PCM for the improvement of thermal energy-storage capability. In their work, they also developed a facile layer-by-layer self-assembly technique to encapsulate n-octadecane into the PMF shell containing highly interconnected CNTs. Such a new technique is schematically depicted in Fig. 18. The experimental results indicated that the introduction of CNTs not only improved the thermal stability, heat transfer rate and mechanical properties of the resultant microcapsules but also reduced their supercooling degree.

Among the carbon-based nanomaterials, graphene has been recognized as an attractive candidate for the modification of microencapsulated PCMs with polymeric shells due to its prominent electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. As a major derivative of graphene, graphene oxide (GO) not only possesses most of the advantages of graphene, but also has several oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which make GO act as a Pickering stabilizer to facilitate the formation of a polymer/GO shell for PCM-based microcapsules. In recent years, many studies on performance enhancement with graphene and GO for microencapsulated PCMs have been reported. Zhang et al.124 adopted surface-modified GO as a Pickering stabilizer to fabricate microcapsules with n-hexadecane as a core and PS/GO as a double-layered shell through emulsion polymerization and observed a considerable improvement in the thermal stability and leakage resistance of the as-prepared microcapsules. Chen et al.125 also used self-prepared GO to modify the PMF shell of microencapsulated n-dodecanol by in situ polymerization and found that the thermal conductivity of the microcapsules increased by about 66% when 4 wt% of GO was incorporated into the PMF shell. Zhang et al.126 reported a similar study on the modification of the PMF shell with GO for microencapsulated paraffin and also observed an enhancement in leakage-prevention performance. Liu et al.127 further investigated the effect of oxidation degree of GO on the thermal performance of microencapsulated n-dodecanol with the PMF/GO composite shell and found that the introduction of GO with a minimum oxidation degree could generate a more significant enhancement in thermal conductivity. Moreover, Yuan et al.128 adopted a GO-modified blend of ethyl and methyl celluloses as a wall material to encapsulate paraffin by a self-assembly route according to the synthetic mechanism shown in Fig. 19. With a high encapsulation ratio of 85.4%, the resulting microcapsules exhibited a high thermal storage capacity, good thermal reliability and enhanced photo-to-thermal conversion performance when used in a phase-change slurry. Qiao et al.129 designed a type of multifunctional microcapsule with paraffin as a core and a PMUF/graphene composite as a shell for low infrared emissivity and high thermal conductance. They successfully fabricated this type of multifunctional microcapsule by an in situ polymerization method and found that these microcapsules exhibited a high thermal conductivity of 1.0540 W m−1 K−1 and infrared emissivity of 0.95 when 10 wt% of graphene was introduced. Su et al.130 also synthesized microencapsulated paraffin with a methanol-modified PMF/graphene hybrid shell through in situ polymerization and investigated the mechanical and thermal properties of the as-synthesized microcapsules. Their experimental results indicated that the incorporation of graphene improved the compression strength and thermal conductivity of the as-synthesized microcapsules, thus resulting in a sensitive response to heat. To achieve much better enhancing effectiveness for the thermal conduction of microencapsulated PCMs, Liu et al.131 investigated the modification of the PMF shell with both GO and CNTs for microencapsulated dodecanol through in situ polymerization. They verified that the combination of GO and CNTs could generate a much greater enhancement effect on the thermal conductivity of the as-prepared microcapsules than GO or CNTs used alone. On the other hand, Dao et al.132 conducted a surface modification of GO with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and then directly used PVA–GO as a wall material to fabricate core–shell structured microcapsules containing a stearic acid core through a Pickering emulsion route. The resulting microcapsules achieved an ultra-thin graphene shell that not only could endow the microencapsulated PCM with much higher thermal conduction, but also could effectively prevent the leakage of the PCM core. More recently, Chen et al.133 developed a novel type of octadecylamine-grafted GO-modified microencapsulated n-octadecane with a PMF shell through in situ polymerization, and the synthetic mechanism is clearly illustrated in Fig. 20. A sound enhancement in heat transfer rate and crystallization of the n-octadecane core was observed from the as-synthesized microcapsules. These studies have clearly indicated that graphene and its derivatives have become promising additives for the performance enhancement of microencapsulated PCMs, but there is a challenge how to improve the dispersion of graphene or GO nanosheets in polymeric shells so as to eliminate the negative influence by reducing their concentration to a much lower level. Anyway, it is anticipated that the application of graphene and its derivatives has been attracting more and more attention in the research fields of microencapsulation of PCMs.

5 Microencapsulation of PCMs with inorganic shells
Although traditional polymeric wall materials offer a processing convenience and structural flexibility for the synthesis of microencapsulated PCMs, there are still a number of drawbacks for such a group of wall materials such as low thermal conductivity, slow thermal response, poor thermal and chemical resistance and easy flammability. The poor thermal conduction is considered as one of the most important obstacles to high thermal energy-storage capacity of microencapsulated PCMs. Therefore, the enhancement of heat transfer performance of microencapsulated PCMs has become a major topic for scientists in recent years. There is no doubt that inorganic materials have a great superiority in thermal conduction compared to the polymeric ones.134 Moreover, most of the inorganic materials show higher rigidity and mechanical strength than polymers, and a high-strength inorganic wall material not only improves the heat transfer performance of a PCM system but also increases the durability and reliability of encapsulated PCMs.14 Therefore, inorganic wall materials are considered as good candidates for microencapsulation of PCMs. Nevertheless, most of the inorganic wall materials are highly rigid, so the effects of geometry, diameter, shell thickness and void fraction of the resulting microcapsules are more significant compared to those with polymeric shells. In general, a smaller diameter, thin-walled spherical microencapsulated PCM could provide a higher energy density and thermal stability, which may be considered as the important technical parameters for the design and fabrication of microencapsulated PCMs with inorganic shells.
5.1 Microencapsulation of PCMs with the SiO2 shell
The synthesis of a microencapsulated organic PCM with an inorganic shell was first reported in 2006. Wang et al.135 introduced the encapsulation technology of n-pentadecane using SiO2 as a wall material through interfacial polycondensation. The synthetic reaction was conducted by using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a silicon source in an emulsion-templating system, and the core–shell structured microcapsules were obtained with an encapsulation efficiency of the PCM core of up to 36%. They also discussed the associated synthetic mechanism in detail by presenting a clear scheme as shown in Fig. 21. As they described, a stable oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion-templating system was first formed with the aid of cationic surfactants. In this emulsion-templating system, the hydrophilic segments of the surfactant trimly cover the surfaces of n-pentadecane/TEOS oily droplets to form micelles with its hydrophobic segments alternately associated with the water molecules. TEOS is hydrolyzed at the interface of micelles to produce water-soluble silanol monomers and silica oligomers under acidic conditions. These silica precursors could be attracted onto the micelle surface through an electrostatic interaction with the hydrophilic segments and then perform polycondensation to form silica gel surrounding the micelles. As a result, an SiO2 shell is fabricated on the n-pentadecane core. On the basis of such a mechanism, Zhang et al.136 successfully fabricated microcapsules containing an n-octadecane core and SiO2 shell through in situ polycondensation in an O/W emulation-templating system using poly(ethylene oxide-b-propylene oxide-b-ethylene oxide) as a nonionic templating agent and they observed a significant improvement in the thermal conductivity of the resultant microcapsules. Moreover, Zhang et al.137 investigated the synthetic technology of microencapsulated n-octadecane with the SiO2 shell through the O/W emulsion-templated interfacial polycondensation and found that the as-synthesized microcapsules achieved a more regular core–shell structure as well as higher encapsulation efficiency by means of this method. Fang et al.138 also reported the synthesis of microencapsulated n-tetradecane with the SiO2 shell for cold energy storage by using a mixture of Tween-80 and Span-80 as a nonionic templating agent. It has been accepted by now that anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants could all be used as templating agents to establish an emulsion-templating system for conducting in situ or interfacial polycondensation of silica precursors.

Fang et al.139 reported an investigation on the microencapsulation of paraffin with the SiO2 shell by in situ polycondensation using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as an anionic templating agent, and a high encapsulation efficiency over 85% was achieved for the microcapsules in their experiments. Tang et al.140 also obtained microencapsulated n-octadecane with the SiO2 shell by emulation-templated in situ polycondensation using the SDS templating agent. Li et al.141 successfully synthesized a microencapsulated paraffin PCM with the SiO2 shell by in situ polycondensation using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a cationic templating agent. Jin et al.142 reported a new one-step methodology for the preparation of a microencapsulated n-nonadecane PCM with the SiO2 shell through interfacial polycondensation without any surfactant or dispersant, and they established an emulsion-templating system by self-stabilization using 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane as a silica co-precursor. In addition to the work for microencapsulated paraffin-type PCMs, a study on the microencapsulation technology of stearic acid with the SiO2 shell was also reported by Chen and co-workers,143 and they obtained a series of core–shell structured microcapsules with a phase change enthalpy over 160 J g−1 through in situ polycondensation in their experiments. Song et al.144 extended this technology to the microencapsulation of eutectic caprice–stearic acids with the SiO2 shell and successfully fabricated PCM-based microcapsules with improved thermal conductivity and thermal stability. Alva et al.145 also performed a sol–gel synthesis to obtain microencapsulated eutectic myristic–palmitic acids with the SiO2 shell using methyl triethoxysilane as a silicon source through in situ polycondensation, and the resultant microcapsules achieved a phase change enthalpy as high as 160 J g−1. Wu et al.146 reported a novel microencapsulation technology for a solid–solid PCM, tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl aminomethane, with the SiO2 shell. Owing to the intrinsic water solubility of tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl aminomethane, they prepared a water-in-oil (W/O) inverse emulsion system to template the in situ polycondensation of silica precursors by using a mixture of TEOS and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane as a silicon source and successfully obtained core–shell structured microcapsules with a stable phase change enthalpy of around 147 J g−1. This novel synthetic route is clearly illustrated in Fig. 22.

Nevertheless, the above-mentioned studies were unexceptionally involved in the use of TEOS as a silicon source for the synthesis of microencapsulated PCMs with an SiO2 shell. Owing to a high cost for organic silica precursors like TEOS as raw materials, these research studies had to stop in the laboratory and were hardly extended to commercial production due to poor cost effectiveness. In this case, inorganic silica precursors like sodium silicate were of expectation for use in the industrial production of microencapsulated PCMs due to their low cost and easy availability. He et al.147 made an attempt to fabricate microencapsulated PCMs with the SiO2 shell through in situ polycondensation using sodium silicate instead of TEOS as a silicon source and obtained microcapsules with a perfect core–shell structure as well as a high thermal storage capability. They also extended this successful attempt to the microencapsulation of other alkane-type PCMs and found that all of the microencapsulated n-alkanes gained a high thermal conductivity, low supercooling degree, and good shape stability and work reliability due to the protection of the SiO2 shell.148 Moreover, Qian et al.149 found that oil shale ash was an improvable silicon source for the preparation of microencapsulated PCMs, and they successfully extracted silica sols from oil shale ash with a high extraction efficiency of 60%. With these silica sols as silica precursors, they carried out a temperature-assisted sol–gel synthesis to obtain microcapsules consisting of a PEG core and SiO2 shell.
SiO2 was also considered as an ideal wall material for encapsulation of inorganic PCMs like salts and salt hydrates due to its excellent sealing tightness, high thermal conductivity and nontoxicity. However, the conventional O/W emulation templating system cannot serve for fabrication of inorganic PCMs with the SiO2 shell because of the water-soluble nature of most of the inorganic PCMs. In general, the chemical methods for encapsulation of inorganic PCMs include interfacial polycondensation through a W/O inverse emulsion-templating route using classical surfactants or a Pickering emulsion-templating pathway employing solid particles as an emulsifier.150 In most cases, the Pickering emulsion-templated polymerization method was adopted for the synthesis of microencapsulated inorganic PCMs with polymer/inorganic hybrid shells. Liu et al.151 synthesized microencapsulated Na2S2O3·5H2O with an SiO2 shell through W/O emulsion-templated in situ polycondensation and found that the comprehensive thermal performance of the as-synthesized microcapsules was improved significantly whereas their supercooling degree was reduced. Li et al.152 developed a novel microfluidic fabrication technology for the preparation of SiO2/Na2SO4·10H2O-based microcapsules as schematically illustrated in Fig. 23. They utilized an inverse emulsion system obtained from microfluidics to template the polycondensation of silica precursors, and the resultant microcapsules presented an aspect of monodisperse microspheres containing a multiporous silica matrix and dispersed Na2SO4·10H2O domains. Differing from conventional core–shell structured microcapsules, such a multiporous silica structure can effectively depress the supercooling of inorganic salt hydrates and lead to much higher thermal storage efficiency accordingly. In addition, Wu et al.153 conducted the direct encapsulation of solid Na2SO4 powder with a silica shell in the sol–gel process using TEOS as a silicon source, and the resultant microcapsules not only exhibited a well-defined core–shell structure but also presented a high latent heat-storage capacity when used for high-temperature thermal energy storage. Zhang et al.154 also reported a novel water-limited technology for the microencapsulation of solid KNO3 powder with an SiO2 shell in the sol–gel process, and the obtained microcapsules were found to demonstrate an extremely high encapsulation ratio of 95% and a good thermally stable form above the melting temperature of 344 °C.

5.2 Microencapsulation of PCMs with the CaCO3 shell
CaCO3 is considered as one of the best wall materials for microencapsulation of PCMs, because it has a more rigid and tight nature than other inorganic materials. However, there are a series of technological challenges in the synthesis of microencapsulated PCMs with a CaCO3 shell. The CaCO3 shell is normally fabricated by interfacial precipitation between the water-soluble calcium salts and carbonates on the surface of the PCM core. However, such a precipitation reaction is too rapid to follow with the deposition of CaCO3 onto the core surface, and a very elaborate technological operation should be carried out to synthesize this type of microencapsulated PCM. Yu et al.155 first reported an interfacial self-assembly precipitation method for the microencapsulation of n-octadecane with a CaCO3 shell in 2014. They established an O/W emulsion-templating system using nonionic surfactants to assemble calcium ions by complexation, followed by carbonate precipitation at the interface of micelles. The resulting CaCO3 shell presented a crystalline phase of vaterite with high rigidity and tightness and thus provided high reliability, long durability and good anti-osmosis performance for the as-synthesized microcapsules. Yu and co-workers.156 further investigated the crystalline structures of the CaCO3 shell formed under different synthetic conditions and found that a calcite shell was fabricated on the n-eicosane core at low concentrations of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) used as a surfactant, whereas a vaterite shell was formed at high concentrations of SDBS. The formation mechanism of the CaCO3 shell is depicted in Fig. 24, and such a crystalline phase transition is ascribed to the stereochemical and geometric relationship between the SDBS molecules and CaCO3 nuclei, which favors the expression of specific crystalline facets and leads to different types of crystals accordingly. Both types of resultant microcapsules were found to present a well-defined core–shell structure, though they showed different morphologies. Wang et al.157 synthesized a type of microcapsule based on a CaCO3 shell and paraffin-based binary core through a self-assembly pathway using the mixture of Tween 80 and Span 80 as a templating agent, and they observed a significant enhancement in the thermal conductivity of the as-synthesized microcapsules due to the fabrication of the highly thermally conductive CaCO3 shell. Wang et al.158 further investigated the thermal performance enhancement of the as-prepared microcapsules within a carbon network based on expanded graphite and found that the heat transfer and energy storage efficiencies were improved significantly for solar thermal applications. Jiang et al.159 also reported a self-assembly synthesis for microencapsulated paraffin with a GO-modified CaCO3 shell using the SMA copolymer as a templating agent, and they found that the combination of CaCO3 and GO could remarkably enhance the thermal stability, thermal conductivity, leakage resistance and mechanical properties of the microencapsulated PCM. Summarily, the CaCO3 shell can endow the PCM core with much better mechanical protection and tighter sealing effect compared to the SiO2 one and thus leads to a longer working lifespan for the encapsulated PCMs.

5.3 Microencapsulation of PCMs with the TiO2 shell
Although highly thermally conductive SiO2 and CaCO3 are the most broadly used inorganic materials to encapsulate various PCMs, other inorganic materials sometimes can also serve as shells for microencapsulated PCMs. Similar to the formation of the SiO2 shell, the TiO2 shell can also be fabricated on the organic PCM core through interfacial or in situ polycondensation of titania precursors with the aid of an O/W emulsion-templating system. Cao et al.160 successfully obtained microcapsules containing the palmitic acid core and TiO2 shell through O/W emulsion-templated in situ polycondensation by using tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) as a titanium source and SDS as a templating agent, and the microencapsulated palmitic acid could still act as a shape-stabilized thermal energy-storage material in spite of an encapsulation efficiency of only 34%. With the same method, Cao et al.161 further developed microencapsulated paraffin with a TiO2 shell for use in building materials, and the resulting microcapsules achieved a high encapsulation efficiency of 85% as well as a high phase change enthalpy over 140 J g−1. Zhao et al.162 also reported the fabrication and performance of microencapsulated n-octadecane with the TiO2 shell through in situ polycondensation in a nonaqueous O/W emulsion using anhydrous ethanol as a green dispersion medium, and the encapsulation process developed by them was found to be simple, feasible, highly efficient and eco-friendly.
Li et al.163 made an attempt to microencapsulate stearic acid into the TiO2 shell with a similar method. Although the resulting microcapsules showed an irregularly spherical shape, they still exhibited good latent heat-storage performance and thermal stability. Deng et al.164 designed a novel type of microcapsule composed of a PEG core and flower-like TiO2 shell. They first synthesized some TiO2 spheres with a flower-like nanostructure by a simple hydrothermal method and then impregnated PEG into these nanostructured TiO2 spheres to obtain PEG-containing microcapsules. The effect of capillary force and surface tension from the TiO2 nanostructure could well enwrap abundant PEG and resulted in an excellent thermal reliability for latent-heat storage and release. Li et al.165 reported an innovation design of microencapsulated paraffin with a TiO2/SiO2 hybrid shell for enhancement of thermal conduction and thermal energy-storage capability. They conducted the emulsion-templated in situ copolycondensation of silica and titania precursors by using a mixture of TEOS and TBT as inorganic sources, and a highly thermally conductive TiO2/SiO2 hybrid shell was successfully fabricated on the paraffin core.
5.4 Microencapsulation of PCMs with other inorganic shells
Theoretically, any inorganic material with a tight nature and high thermal conductivity can be potentially used as a wall material for microencapsulation of PCMs. However, the application range of inorganic wall materials is strongly dependent on the encapsulation technology that can lead to the formation of a core–shell structure. In addition to the SiO2, CaCO3 and TiO2 shells, the fabrication of microencapsulated PCMs with other inorganic shells has also been reported in recent years. Pan et al.166 reported a synthetic method for microencapsulated palmitic acid with an AlO(OH) shell by using AlCl3 as an alumina source through interfacial precipitation of Al3+ and OH−. During the synthetic process, they employed SDS as a surfactant and n-amyl alcohol as an assistant surfactant to establish an O/W emulsion-templating system, in which Al3+ could be captured onto the surface of the PCM core by the hydrophilic groups of SDS so as to perform the interfacial self-assembly of the AlO(OH) shell. The as-prepared microcapsules presented a well-defined core–shell structure and encapsulation efficiency as high as 69%. Latibari et al.167 also investigated the preparation and performance of microencapsulated palmitic acid with the AlO(OH) shell by directly using AlO(OH) as the alumina source according to the same methodology. Consequently, the regularly spherical microcapsules with a diameter of 1.689–3.730 μm were obtained from the interfacial self-assembly and polycondensation of alumina precursors in the sol–gel process. This work indicated that the AlO(OH) shell could provide higher thermal conduction and thermal stability for the microencapsulated PCM compared to the SiO2 one.
For the microencapsulation of high-temperature inorganic PCMs like molten salts and metals, a direct encapsulation method has been employed for solid powders of PCMs to form core–shell structured microcapsules. Li et al.168 reported the direct encapsulation of solid NaNO3 powder with perhydropolysilazane by a phase-separation method and found that the resulting microcapsules not only achieved a high encapsulation efficiency of about 85% but also presented an enhanced thermal stability due to the use of a highly thermal-resistant wall material. Nomura et al.169 developed a type of microencapsulated metal-based PCM for high-temperature thermal storage by encapsulating an Al–Si alloy into the α-Al2O3 shell. This type of microencapsulated PCM was fabricated through the formation of an AlOOH layer on the Al–Si core surface using a boehmite treatment method, followed by a heat-oxidation treatment in the O2 atmosphere to form a stable α-Al2O3 shell. The resulting microcapsules were found to have a high melting point of 573 °C and a high fusion heat of 247 J g−1 and therefore exhibited potential applications in high-temperature thermal energy storage and transportation systems as described in Fig. 25. Nomura and co-workers170 further investigated the effects of heat-oxidation temperature on the morphology and crystalline structure of the α-Al2O3 shell and the mechanical strength, heat capacity and cyclic durability of the as-prepared microcapsules and found that, when the mass ratio of Al/Si was set to 1/4, the microcapsules had an effective void inside the core to allow for the volume expansion of the PCM during the solid–liquid phase transitions. Sheng et al.171 also reported the microencapsulation of an Al–Si alloy with a Cu/Al2O3 double-layered shell via a multi-step route as schematically illustrated in Fig. 26. In their synthetic work, a boehmite (AlOOH) shell was first fabricated on the Al–Si alloy core by boiling treatment in water and then transferred to the Al2O3 shell by heating at 500 °C. The surface of the Al2O3 shell was etched with HCl solution, followed by forming a Cu layer on the Al2O3 shell by an electroless plating method to obtain multilayered microcapsules. Such a multilayered structure could effectively prevent the leakage of the Al–Si alloy core at a high temperature over 570 °C, making the microencapsulated Al–Si alloy suitable for use in high-temperature thermal energy storage in solar thermal power generation. Moreover, Li et al.172 designed a multilayered yolk/shell microcapsule system based on an Al@Al2O3 core and Fe2O3/Al2O3 shell for heat management in catalytic reactions. For the formation of such a complicated microcapsule system, they first fabricated an Al2O3 thin layer on the surface of Al microspheres by catalytic oxidation with O2 and then coated with an Fe2O3/Al2O3 outer layer to form (Fe2O3/Al2O3)/(Al@Al2O3) multilayered microcapsules. This formation process and relevant mechanisms are chemically illustrated in Fig. 27. With a high latent heat-storage capacity of 315 J g−1 and superior thermal conductivity of 1.5–2.7 W (m−1 K−1), this multilayered microcapsule system could serve as a thermal storage functional oxygen carrier for thermal management in complex chemical processes.

Recently, the application of graphene and its derivatives for microencapsulation of PCMs has attracted a great deal of attention, and there are several publications involved in this hot topic. Ye et al.173 reported the encapsulation technology of paraffin with graphene aerogels through a modified hydrothermal method. In their synthetic experiment, reduced GO was self-assembled into three-dimensional graphene aerogels consisting of numerous hollow graphene cells, and paraffin was simultaneously encapsulated into these cells in the hydrothermal process, resulting in the formation of core-shell-like structured microcapsules. Owing to the unique microencapsulation structure and continuous graphene network, the obtained microcapsules not only achieved high encapsulation efficiency over 90% and an excellent latent heat-storage capability but also gained a good shape stability and enhanced thermal conductivity. Lin et al.174 also used GO to modify the microcapsules containing a stearic acid core and SiO2 shell for enhancement of heat transfer and found that the incorporation of GO into the SiO2 shell improved the thermal conductivity of the microcapsules significantly. Dao and Jeong175 prepared microencapsulated PCMs by direct encapsulation of stearic acid with reduced GO through the electrostatic interaction provided by an anionic surfactant. The as-prepared microcapsules achieved high encapsulation efficiency due to the ultra-thin graphene shell. Graphene can also be used to modify inorganic wall materials to enhance the photo-thermal conversion capability of microencapsulated PCMs. Ma et al.176 synthesized microencapsulated paraffin with a GO-modified TiO2 shell by incorporating GO into the reaction system during the in situ polycondensation process of titania precursors. The GO-modified microcapsules achieved excellent photo-thermal conversion and thermal energy-storage capabilities and thus became a promising candidate used for solar energy storage in direct absorption solar collectors.
6 Microencapsulation of PCMs with bio-based and biodegradable polymers
Bio-based and biodegradable polymers are a special class of prominent sustainable materials that are derived from plant sources and can be naturally degraded by the action of microorganisms. They have raised great interest since sustainable development policies tend to expand with decreasing reserves of fossil fuels and the growing concern for the environment. Aiming at environmental sustainability, bio-based and biodegradable polymers are also considered as a type of promising wall material for encapsulation of PCMs due to their eco-friendly nature and superior properties such as acceptable mechanical performance, excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility, non-toxicity and good recyclability compared to transitional synthetic polymers. There have been an increasing number of studies that reported the microencapsulation of PCMs with bio-based and biodegradable polymers since the early 2000s. Hawlader et al.177 and Fang et al.178 reported the encapsulation of paraffin with a gelatin/acacia complex as a bio-based wall material by a complex coacervation method, and both of them observed that the microencapsulated paraffin not only achieved a high phase change enthalpy but also exhibited a stable energy-storage capacity and geometrical profile after multicycle thermal treatments. Hawlader et al.179 further investigated the structure and thermal performance of microencapsulated paraffin with a gelatin/acacia complex shell by different encapsulation methods including complex coacervation and spray-drying, and they found that the as-prepared microcapsules gained much higher thermal energy-storage capacity than those from a previous study.177 This work confirmed that both complex coacervation and spray-drying methods were suitable for the encapsulation of the PCM as a solar energy-storage material. Onder et al.180 also used a mixture of gelatin and gum Arabic as a wall material for microencapsulation of three types of paraffin waxes through complex coacervation for textile applications and found that n-hexadecane and n-octadecane were suitable PCMs for use in woven fabrics due to their high latent heat-storage capacities over 144 J g−1. Moreover, Bayés-García et al.181 investigated the microencapsulation of a commercialized paraffin-type PCM (Rubitherm® RT27) with sterilized gelatin/Arabic gum and agar–agar/Arabic gum complexes as two types of natural biodegradable materials by a coacervation technique. All of the resultant microcapsules presented a good thermal energy-storage capability on the basis of their experimental results.
As a derivative of cellulose, ethyl cellulose has the advantages of low cost, high mechanical strength, non-toxicity, good cold/heat resistance, and strong alkali and dilute acid resistance, and can well serve as a desirable bio-based wall material for encapsulation of PCMs. Phadungphatthanakoon et al.182 reported the use of ethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose as wall materials to encapsulate n-eicosane by an emulsion-solvent method without any additional surfactant, and they also investigated the application of the as-synthesized microcapsules in natural rubber for thermal management. Their experimental results indicated that the obtained rubber composites presented an evident thermoregulation capability with enhanced mechanical performance. Feczkó et al.183 also prepared microencapsulated n-hexadecane with an ethyl cellulose shell by an emulsion-solvent evaporation method using different surfactants and found that a higher latent heat storage capacity could be obtained when using PVA and poly(methacrylic acid) as surfactants. Similarly, the use of the emulsification-solvent evaporation method for encapsulation of myristic acid was also reported by Lin et al.184 Their work indicated that the ethyl cellulose shell could effectively prevent the leakage of melted myristic acid, while the optimal microcapsules achieved a high latent heat-storage capacity of more than 104 J g−1. Chen et al.185 developed a novel type of core–sheath structured fiber with PEG as a core and cellulose acetate as a sheath for thermal energy storage by using a coaxial electrospinning method. The resulting PCM-based fibers presented good thermal properties as well as a cylindrical and smooth morphology and therefore exhibited extensive applications as a smart material for thermal energy storage and temperature regulation.
Besides the above-mentioned biodegradable materials, there are some other natural materials that were reported as bio-based wall materials for encapsulation of PCMs. Luo et al.186 investigated the microencapsulation of n-octadecane with silk fibroin as a shell by means of a self-assembly method using different types of surfactants. They found that a mixture of nonionic and ionic surfactants could effectively promote the formation of an n-octadecane/silk fibroin emulsion and enhance the emulsion stability. As a result, the energy density and mechanical strength of the microcapsules were improved remarkably. Zhao et al.187 conducted a similar study on the microencapsulation of n-octadecane with a natural silk fibroin shell and also observed a high thermal-storage capability and thermal reliability from the resulting microcapsules, which favored their applications in thermo-regulating textiles or fibers and biological medical materials. Gondora et al.188 explored the application of rice husk char as a by-product in biofuel production for microencapsulation of hexadecane. In their work, rice husk char was fabricated on the PCM core through Pickering emulsion self-assembly and then fixed with water-soluble polymers to obtain layer-by-layer structured microcapsules with an acceptable latent heat-storage capacity of 80.9 J g−1. This work provides a new route of carbon capture for the utilization of biomass-originated carbon-based materials. Irani et al.189 developed microencapsulated n-heptadecane with a starch shell for thermal energy storage applications, and they successfully obtained the desirable microcapsules through the multi-stage adsorption of starch onto the PCM core according to the synthetic mechanism illustrated in Fig. 28. Their investigation demonstrated that the resultant microcapsules presented high fusion and solidification heat and a proper thermal reliability. Huo et al.190 also developed a type of eco-friendly microcapsule with a side-chain crystallizable comb-like polymer as a core and natural chitosan as a shell by a coacervation method described in Fig. 29. The as-prepared microcapsules achieved a phase change enthalpy of around 130 J g−1 at the encapsulation efficiency of about 69% and showed a promising application in the field of medical treatment.

7 Potential application of microencapsulated PCMs
PCMs have long been known for their thermal energy-storage capability. The application of PCMs to provide a means of thermal storage and thermal management has been practiced for many centuries. As a typical case of the thermal storage system with PCMs, the ancients understood the principle of cool storage with ice for retaining items at a constant low temperature. Icehouses were built by incorporating large blocks of ice cut from frozen rivers in the winter season and contained within sawdust insulation to provide ice for use in the summer periods. Since the first patent was filed for the thermal storage application by means of PCMs to maintain the required temperature during manufacturing tin sheets in 1901, PCMs have gained a considerable development in both fundamental research and practical applications.191 In recent years, PCMs have been designed and developed to meet the requirements around the world all the way from the international space station down to submarine cooling applications.192 In view of the superiority of microencapsulated PCMs in thermal storage stability and durability, the applications of PCM-based microcapsules have received special attention from various industrial communities. Furthermore, the commercialization of microencapsulated PCMs all over the world has paved the way for their applications in diverse areas. For example, DuPont has supplied a product of microencapsulated paraffin-type PCM (DuPont™ Energain®) for building materials with energy consumption reduction as a long-lasting thermal mass solution for environmentally sustainable buildings.193 There is growing awareness of the importance of microencapsulated PCMs and their products in our ordinary daily life.
7.1 Application of microencapsulated PCMs in energy-saving buildings
Owing to the micrometric size of microencapsulated PCMs, they can be produced in either powder form or dispersed in a liquid with additional protection from destruction, which makes it possible to directly incorporate microencapsulated PCMs into building materials like gypsums and concretes without the risk of leakage. Therefore, microencapsulated PCMs have been widely used in building materials to enhance the thermal comfort of lightweight constructions, especially to overcome overheating problems in summer, and they have provided a new effective solution for thermal management and energy saving in buildings. There are lots of researchers who have worked for the applications of microencapsulated PCMs in the building industry. As early as in 2005, Schossig et al.194 investigated the application of formaldehyde-free microencapsulated paraffins in building materials by directly integrating them into conventional construction materials and found that the use of these microencapsulated PCMs could help keep the indoor temperature up to 4 °C lower than typical conditions and could reduce the number of hours that the indoor temperature was greater than 28 °C. They also observed that the microcapsule shell well prevented any interaction between the PCM and the matrix material without any extra protection for them against destruction. Therefore, these microcapsules could be integrated into specially optimized building materials, independent of the phase of the PCM. They also found that the distribution of microencapsulated paraffins in construction materials offered a much larger heat exchange surface, leading to a significant rise in heat transfer rate. Hunger et al.195 studied the application of microencapsulated PCMs in self-compacting concrete mixtures by direct mixing and also investigated their influence on the material properties. Based on their modeling and experimental investigations involving hydration, temporary energy storage and heat emission by microencapsulated PCMs could reduce the temperature peak of hydration up to 28.1% by increasing the content of microencapsulated PCM to 5 wt%. Furthermore, their work also confirmed that the introduction of microencapsulated PCMs led to a lower thermal conductivity and an increased heat capacity, thus significantly improving the thermal performance of concrete and saving energy. Li et al.196 prepared a series of novel latent heat-storage panels based on microencapsulated paraffin as a PCM and a high-density polyethylene/wood flour composite as a supporting material by a compression molding method and investigated their potential use in energy-saving building materials. Cao et al.197 introduced a microencapsulated paraffin PCM into Portland cement concrete and geopolymeric concrete and then investigated the energy-saving effect of these two concretes on buildings. They observed that the Portland cement and geopolymeric concretes containing 3.2 and 2.7 wt% of microencapsulated PCM reduced power consumption by 11% and 15%, respectively, when the room temperature was stable at 23 °C. These results confirmed an effective improvement in the energy-saving effect of concrete buildings.
Microencapsulated PCMs are also very suitably applied for wallboards, a type of cheap and widely used building material. The incorporation of microencapsulated PCMs into wallboards can provide thermal storage distributed throughout the complete building, enabling passive solar design and off-peak cooling in traditional frame constructions with a typical low thermal mass. Cabeza et al.198 and Castellón et al.199 investigated the application of a microencapsulated PCM (Micronal®) obtained from BASF in concrete walls and sandwich panels, respectively, and both of their studies demonstrated the feasibility of this commercial product in increasing the thermal inertia of building materials and reducing the energy demand of the final buildings. Kuznik and Virgone200 carried out an experimental assessment in a full-scale test room decorated with microencapsulated paraffin-enhanced wallboards for a typical day in the summer season and found that the introduction of a microencapsulated PCM could enhance the natural convection mixing of the air and therefore effectively reduce the surface temperature on the walls and prevent the room from overheating during the daytime. Evola et al.201 conducted a simulation investigation study on an office building refurbished with wallboards containing microencapsulated paraffin during summer conditions, and they demonstrated that the utilization of total latent heat storage potential in PCM-enhanced wallboards was strongly dependent on convective heat transfer across the wall surface, the amounts of direct solar radiation and climate conditions. Konuklu et al.202 developed a novel heat-adjustable gypsum board by mixing gypsum powder with a microencapsulated paraffin PCM and glass fiber and found that this type of gypsum board exhibited a highly efficient temperature regulation capability by maintaining a temperature in the range of 22–27 °C for 1735 s. Borreguero et al.203 investigated the thermal regulation performance of gypsum boards containing a microencapsulated PCM, and they observed that the higher the loading of the microencapsulated PCM in the gypsum boards, the smoother was the temperature curve of the outer wall. Based on this result, they developed a series of intelligent gypsum composite boards with microencapsulated PCMs to improve the thermal storage capacity of building materials for increasing building comfort.204 Their study also demonstrated that a standard room covered with 1 m3 of gypsum board containing 15 wt% of microencapsulated PCM could save 4.5 kWh of electrical energy per phase transition cycle, which is equivalent to the energy consumed by three 60 watt incandescent bulbs throughout the day. In this case, the mission of carbon dioxide could be reduced by 1.395 kg. These results proved a tremendous technical support for further development of thermal regulation applications in energy-saving buildings.
7.2 Application of microencapsulated PCMs in fibers and textiles
The thermo-regulating fibers and textiles containing microencapsulated PCMs with phase change temperature in the range of 28–35 °C have shown a great development and broad application in recent years. The fibers or textiles containing these PCM-based microcapsules can absorb heat energy by the storage of latent heat in PCMs through phase changes when the ambient or body temperature rises. On the other hand, the latent heat stored by PCM-based microcapsules in the fibers or textiles can be released as soon as the ambient or body temperature drops. These two processes can create a microclimate for the covered body to keep comfortable temperatures. Such an advantage makes the thermo-regulating fibers and textiles very suitable to find application in outdoor wear such as parkas, snowsuits, vests, trousers, hunting clothing, ski wear, boots, ear warmers, gloves and in-house cloths such as blankets, mattresses, duvets and pillow cases.205 Paraffin waxes, especially n-eicosane, n-octadecane and n-hexadecane are mostly preferred for fiber and textile applications due to their high latent-heat capacity and suitable phase change temperatures for thermal comfort of the human body as well as being chemically inert, non-toxic, non-corrosive and non-hygroscopic.55 There are a number of publications regarding the development and applications of microencapsulated PCMs in these ‘smart’ fibers and textiles. As a senior expert in the application of PCMs in fabrics and textiles, Nelson G.206 summarized that there were two ways to incorporate microencapsulated PCMs into fabrics and textiles, i.e. directly embedding in the fiber matrix and coating on the surface of fabrics as seen in Fig. 30. With this exploited technology in textile fibres and fabric coatings, microencapsulated PCMs can be applied in all kinds of fabric and textile materials. The incorporation of microencapsulated PCMs into the matrix of synthetic fibers can usually be conducted either by wet spinning for polyacrylonitrile, poly(acrylonitrile-vinylidene chloride) and polyacrylic fibers, and by melt spinning for polypropylene or polyethylene fibers.207 M. Leskovšek et al.208 prepared polypropylene monofilaments incorporated with microencapsulated paraffin during the melt-spinning process and exploited the processing of this type of thermo-regulating fiber at optimum parameters. Zhang et al.209,210 also prepared different thermo-regulating composite fibers with polyethylene, polypropylene and poly(acrylonitrile-vinylidene chloride) as matrices and microencapsulated n-octadecane as a PCM through different spinning processes, and they obtained a series of important data for thermal and temperature regulation of these ‘smart’ fibers. Iqbal et al.211 developed a type of thermo-regulating fiber with a latent heat-storage capacity of 9.2 kJ kg−1 by incorporating a microencapsulated PCM into polypropylene fibers through melt spinning and this type of ‘smart’ fiber could find application in high altitude clothing, curtains, furniture and automobile interiors. Moreover, Jiang et al.212 reported an in situ microencapsulation method for the preparation of thermo-regulating fibers. In their work, the in situ microencapsulation of a paraffin-type PCM in the fiber matrix of PVA was conducted by treating the as-spun fiber to promote the hydrolysis and polycondensation of TEOS at the interface between paraffin and the PVA matrix. The resulting fiber presented a relatively high latent heat-storage capacity of 23.7 kJ kg−1 and good thermal stability, and its mechanical strength was also good enough for application in textiles. It has been widely accepted that the advantages of embedding PCM-based microcapsules into the fiber matrix can well maintain the durability of the microcapsules within the fiber structure, showing no contrary effect on the touch, drape, softness and color of the final fabrics, and no need to modify the subsequent weaving and knitting processing and the dyeing, printing and finishing post-treatments. However, the thermal heat capacity of the obtained fibers is limited to a low loading of PCM-based microcapsules (normally around 5–10 wt%). Moreover, the processing conditions may damage the microcapsule shell, resulting in a decrease in thermo-mechanical properties of the fibers. To overcome these shortages, some new methods were invented to integrate microencapsulated PCMs into textile products by mixing PCM-based with a binder and then coating the mixture on the fibers and fabrics or building polymer foam inserts with two or more layers.207 Numerous textile applications following these inventions were realized, such as thermal barriers with microencapsulated PCMs for insulative pads and shoe insoles, close fitting flexible garments for cold water diving garments, leather products impregnated with microencapsulated PCMs, fabric sheets with shaped channels filled with microencapsulated PCMs, improved fire wear, diving suits, special working clothes, military uniforms, gloves and shoes, and special textile products containing electric heating circuits printed on supports with microencapsulated PCMs.213–216 The future development and application of thermo-regulating fibers and textiles with microencapsulated PCMs will establish a system that is easy to apply, does not affect the existing textile properties and has a shelf-life on clothes that allow normal fabric-care processes to take place.

7.3 Other applications of microencapsulated PCMs
In recent years, latent functional thermal fluids have attracted great interest due to their greater apparent specific heat in the specific temperature range than conventional single-phase heat transfer fluids. Latent functional thermal fluids are generally composed of microencapsulated PCM particles and a heat transfer fluid and may exist as a microencapsulated PCM slurry or emulsion. Microencapsulated PCM slurries are able to provide considerable heat capacity in heat transfer applications due to their great latent heat-storage/release capability. Microencapsulated PCM slurries can not only absorb or dissipate latent heat in its phase change temperature range to exhibit a much greater apparent specific heat, but also significantly enhance the heat transfer rate between the fluid and the tube wall and reduce the mass flow rate and energy consumption of the pump used. Therefore, microencapsulated PCM slurries have been widely used in the fields of heating and cooling systems. Wang and Niu217 proposed a combination of a cooling ceiling system and microencapsulated PCM slurry and found that this combined cooling ceiling system had much higher energy efficiency than those with ice or without any heat-storage medium. Their investigation identified that the combination of a cooling ceiling system with the microencapsulated PCM slurry could meet the requirement for energy saving and cooling demand of office rooms in Hong Kong. By now, microencapsulated PCM slurries have exhibited potentially important applications as heat transfer fluids for micro-channel heat exchangers, solar energy collectors, thermal power plants, ventilating systems, air-conditioning systems, refrigeration, etc.218,219 Moreover, there are a number of recently published review articles focusing on the preparation, characterization, performance and application of microencapsulated PCM slurries, which provide a great deal of information about extensive research efforts in the area of latent functional thermal fluids on the basis of microencapsulation technology of PCMs.220–223
Recently, some studies have indicated that the use of PCMs for the passive thermal management of photovoltaic cell can improve the overall efficiency of the photovoltaic system, and the combination of a photovoltaic cell and PCMs coupled in a single module can effectively enhance the reliability of the photovoltaic system.224,225 The investigation by Islam et al.226 demonstrated that microencapsulated PCMs can offer more operational reliability in the case of photovoltaic thermal systems, and the power output is enhanced by 9% with 6 °C more reduction in photovoltaic module temperature. A novel photovoltaic thermal and power system making use of a microencapsulated PCM slurry as the working fluid was reported by Qiu et al.227 Their investigation indicated that the use of the microencapsulated PCM slurry at elevated flow rates reduced the module temperature of the photovoltaic system and improved electrical and thermal efficiencies as well. Ho et al.228 reported an investigation on the performance of a photovoltaic-microencapsulated PCM module, which floats on water and dumps the heat carried by the microencapsulated PCM from the photovoltaic back surface. They observed a reduction by 1.8 °C in module temperature and an increase in power generation by 2.1% compared to the photovoltaic-only system. There is no doubt that the photovoltaic thermal technology with microencapsulated PCMs will be a promising option for high-performance photovoltaic systems and play a very important role in future development of photovoltaic systems. The application of microencapsulated PCMs in passive cooling for electronic devices is also gaining special attention due to the inherent characteristics of PCMs, and the high latent heat capacity and small volume change during phase changes make microencapsulated PCMs a promising candidate for cooling systems in various commercial and industrial electronic devices.229 In most electronic systems, heat is generated from the IC chip. The main focus of the research is how to effectively remove this heat from the chip to the surrounding atmosphere. Tomizawa et al.230 investigated the application of PCM sheets in mobile phones. In their work, microencapsulated paraffin with a melting temperature of 32 °C was adopted to combine with copper sheets to form a highly thermally conductive paste used for mobile phones. Their investigation indicated that this phase change material pasting layer on the copper sheets could more effectively prevent the rise in temperature for mobile phones compared to other cooling methods. Moreover, with advancement in medical science, a variety of PCMs were reported for biomedical applications such as microencapsulated PCMs for the thermal protection of tissue surrounding tumors during cryosurgery, and transport and storage of medicines.231 In summary, the applications of microencapsulated PCMs are booming in a variety of fields with the development of encapsulation techniques for various PCMs and their commercialization. Furthermore, microencapsulated PCMs will not only be used in thermal energy storage and thermal management but also in various emerging applications such as drug delivery, bio-catalysis and biosensors, information storage, detection, military stealth.
8 Fabrication of PCM-based nanocapsules
The microencapsulation of PCMs provides a good solution for leakage and running off problems of solid–liquid PCMs and thus effectively protects the encapsulated PCM from the interference of the ambient environment. Nevertheless, considering the possible nanoscale effects such as small size, large specific surface for heat transfer, high surface energy and fast heat transfer rate, the encapsulation of PCMs into nanosized capsules (named as nanocapsules) has received great interest in recent years.20 It has been widely accepted that the smaller capsules can greatly increase the ratio of surface-area-to-volume for PCMs, thus improving their heat transfer rate. A molecular dynamics study by Rao et al.232 has confirmed that the nanoencapsulation of PCMs can increase the fluidity of the core material and enhance the heat transfer of the whole capsule, indicating a positive aspect for thermal energy storage. Therefore, there is no doubt that the nanoencapsulation of PCMs can generate a much better enhancement in latent heat capacity and thermal conduction and is considered as a good alternative for the performance improvement of PCMs accordingly.21 Moreover, nanoencapsulated PCMs not only exhibit much better performance in phase change repeatability and repetition compared to the microencapsulated ones, but also have some unique characteristics like volume effect, surface effect, and macroscopic quantum-tunneling effect, which make them steadily dispersed in a thermal fluid to ensure a suitable application in energy storage and thermal management. Therefore, the nanoencapsulation of PCMs has been recognized as a promising technology with good prospects for the development of high-performance PCMs. Nanoencapsulation is still a novel technology. However, it would be interesting to see how the nanocapsules perform in comparison with microcapsules when integrated into building materials, both with regard to energy usage and structural stability in materials such as concretes. An issue that has not been discussed in the studies is how nanocapsules will be compared with respect to overall costs.
8.1 Nanoencapsulation of PCMs with polymeric shells
MF and UF resins are the most commonly used wall materials not only for microencapsulation of PCMs but also for their nanoencapsulation. As early as in 2004, Zhang et al.233 reported the synthetic technology of nanoencapsulated n-octadecane with an MF copolymer shell via emulation-templated in situ polymerization and found that the stirring speed and surfactant content influenced the particle size significantly. Moreover, Hu et al.234 further modified the MF shell of nanoencapsulated paraffin by in situ polymerization with carboxymethyl cellulose (CSC) as a comonomer and found that the introduction of CSC into the wall material effectively reduced the damage rate of the resulting nanocapsules. Fang et al.235 adopted PUF resin as a wall material to encapsulate n-tetradecane through in situ polymerization and obtained nanocapsules with a particle size of around 100 nm under the control of stirring rate. These nanocapsules achieved a PCM loading as high as 60 wt% and a high latent heat-storage capacity of 134.16 J g−1. To investigate the heat and mass transfer of nanoencapsulated PCMs with a hyper-crosslinked PU shell, Liu and Rao236 performed a molecular dynamics simulation by establishing a series of 3D molecular structures for wall materials as illustrated in Fig. 31, and their simulation results indicated that a high crosslinking density for wall materials could favor the heat transfer of nanocapsules as well as the improvement of thermal and mechanical properties.

PMMA and its copolymers were also usually employed as wall materials for nanoencapsulation of PCMs due to their good packaging performance and thermal stability as well as a feasible and facile synthetic technology. Chen et al.237 reported the synthesis and thermal performance of nanoencapsulated n-dodecanol with a PMMA shell through miniemulsion polymerization and observed a decrease in capsule diameter with an increase of surfactant concentration. However, only a maximum phase change enthalpy of 98 J g−1 was achieved for the as-synthesized nanocapsules with a particle size varying from 100 nm to 200 nm. Shirin-Abadi et al.238 further investigated the nanoencapsulation of n-hexadecane with a PMMA shell through miniemulsion polymerization and found that PMMA was immiscible with n-hexadecane and therefore separated through polymerization to produce hollow polymer nanospheres filled with n-hexadecane. A simple sonochemical method for the nanoencapsulation of PCMs with PMMA was introduced by Wang et al.,239 and nanocapsules containing a stearic acid core were obtained by the ultrasonically initiated in situ polymerization of the MMA monomer. The resultant nanocapsules presented a high latent heat-storage capacity of 155.6 J g−1 as well as a narrow diameter distribution between 80 and 90 nm. Moreover, Wang et al.240 successfully obtained nanocapsules based on an eicosanoic–stearic acid eutectic core and PMMA shell through UV-photoinitiated emulsion polymerization and their investigation demonstrated that these nanocapsules only had a mean diameter of 46 nm but exhibited a phase change enthalpy over 126 J g−1. Zhang et al.241 also synthesized nanoencapsulated n-octadecane with a poly(MMA-co-EMA) shell by a direct miniemulsion polymerization method and found that the mean diameter of the as-synthesized nanocapsules was distributed in the range of 119–140 nm. Furthermore, these nanocapsules exhibited a high phase change enthalpy of about 197 J g−1. To suppress the supercooling of PCM-based nanocapsules, Tang et al.242 designed a nanocapsule system using a novel acrylate copolymer containing long n-alkyl side chains as a shell. They conducted miniemulsion polymerization to encapsulate n-octadecane into poly(MMA-co-octadecyl methacrylate (OMA)) and found that the comb-like OMA side chains could effectively reduce the supercooling degree of n-octadecane within the resultant nanocapsules. Alay et al.243 developed a type of nanoencapsulated PCM specially used as a fiber additive for thermal energy storage and thermal regulation, and they performed the nanoencapsulation of n-hexadecane with a poly(MMA-co-glycidyl methacrylate) shell through emulsion polymerization to obtain nanocapsules with a mean diameter of 260 nm. These nanocapsules were found to be well dispersed in the PAN fiber matrix during the electrospinning process. To predict the morphology of PCM-based nanocapsules obtained from miniemulsion polymerization, Shirin-Abadi et al.244 investigated the kinetic and thermodynamic correlation of nanoencapsulated n-hexadecane with a ternary copolymer shell of poly(MMA-co-2-ethylhexyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid), and they observed an interesting transformation from a well-defined core–shell structure to a half-moon morphology due to the change of interfacial tension caused by hydrophobic and hydrophilic comonomers. Such a transformation mechanism is schematically depicted in Fig. 32.

The miniemulsion in situ polymerization is also usually used for the synthesis of PCM-based nanocapsules with PS or its copolymer shells. Fang et al.245 developed an ultrasonic-assistant miniemulsion technology to synthesize nanoencapsulated n-octadecane with a PS shell through in situ polymerization, and the particle size of the as-synthesized nanocapsules could be controlled in the range of 100–123 nm. By means of this technology along with the PS wall material, Fang et al.246,247 successfully fabricated nanoencapsulated n-tetradecane and n-dotriacontane for cold energy storage and thermal energy storage, respectively. Li et al.248 also investigated the preparation of nanoencapsulated hexadecanol with the crosslinked PS shell through a facile one-pot emulsion polymerization route and observed a significant improvement in thermal stability of the as-prepared nanocapsules due to the formation of a crosslinking structure in the PS shell. Fuensanta et al.249 proposed the use of poly(St-co-BA) as a wall material to encapsulate paraffin within nanocapsules using the miniemulsion polymerization route, and the resulting nanocapsules achieved a high encapsulation efficiency close to 80 wt% along with a particle size distribution between 52 and 112 nm. Tumirah et al.250 investigated the nanoencapsulation of n-octadecane with a poly(St-co-MMA) shell through the same synthetic route and found that the mean diameter of the as-synthesized nanocapsules was considerably influenced by the mass ratio of St/MMA in the shell. Konuklu et al.251 reported a performance investigation on a series of nanocapsules based on an n-alkane core and poly(St-co-EA) shell through conventional emulsion polymerization, and they found that the nanocapsules achieved optimum thermal performance at a core/shell mass ratio of 3/1. Mohammadi et al.252 developed a type of PCM-based nanocapsule consisting of a butyl palmitate core and poly(St-co-MMA) shell by suspension-like polymerization for thermal energy-storage applications in building materials, and the resulting nanocapsules exhibited a high thermal energy storage capacity in gypsum walls.
There are a number of other polymers that are possibly employed as wall materials for nanoencapsulation of PCMs. Cheng et al.253 prepared nanoencapsulated 1-dodecanol with an amphiphilic PU shell by using an emulsifier-free miniemulsion technology, and the as-prepared nanocapsules were found to have a rather high encapsulation efficiency of nearly 100%. Zhu et al.254 used organosilica as a wall material to fabricate nanoencapsulated n-octadecane through interfacial polycondensation of various silane precursors in a miniemulsion system, and the as-prepared nanocapsules presented facilely tunable hydrophobicity as well as stable phase change performance due to the diverse molecular structures of the organosilica shell. Zhu et al.255 further investigated the morphology control and thermal performance of nanoencapsulated n-octadecane with an organosilica shell and established a relationship between the morphology and phase change performance. Graham et al.256 reported a novel type of inorganic PCM-based nanocapsule composed of an Mg(NO3)2·6H2O core and poly(ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate) (PECA) shell. This type of nanoencapsulated inorganic PCM was obtained through an inverse miniemulsion polymerization route and presented a high phase change stability and low supercooling degree. Graham et al.257 further developed nanoencapsulated crystallohydrate eutectics of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and Na2SO4·10H2O for advanced thermal energy storage by using the same wall material and synthetic methodology, and a low-temperature phase transition and high latent heat capacity were observed due to the synergetic effects of the two components at their eutectic point.
8.2 Nanoencapsulation of PCMs with organic–inorganic hybrid or inorganic shells
Similar to the polymeric microencapsulation of PCMs, the main disadvantage of polymeric shells used for nanoencapsulation of PCMs is still due to their low thermal conductivity, which inevitably leads to a slow heat exchange and heat transfer during the latent-heat storage and release processes. To improve thermal conductivity, several attempts were reported to fabricate nanoencapsulated PCMs with organic–inorganic composite shells. Shi et al.258 developed an integrated methodology based on interfacial polymerization, sol–gel reaction and self-assembly for the nanoencapsulation of paraffin PCMs with a PMMA/SiO2 hybrid shell on the basis of the synthetic strategy depicted in Fig. 33. A considerable improvement in encapsulation efficiency was observed for the nanocapsules obtained with this method. Fu et al.259 reported the nanoencapsulation of n-tetradecane with a PS/SiO2 hybrid shell containing SiO2 nanoparticles through in situ miniemulsion polymerization and sol–gel reaction, during which SiO2 nanoparticles were embedded into the PS matrix, and a remarkable enhancement in thermal conductivity was observed for the resultant nanocapsules. Zhu et al.260 further investigated the morphology and thermal performance of nanoencapsulated n-octadecane with a PHEMA/SiO2 hybrid shell and found that the as-prepared nanocapsules had a smaller particle size and better leakage proof than nanocapsules with other wall materials.

The investigation of nanoencapsulation technology for PCMs has already been extended to inorganic wall materials for further enhancement in thermal conduction and heat transfer. Latibari et al.261 successfully synthesized nanocapsules containing a palmitic acid core and SiO2 shell by a sol–gel method, and these nanocapsules presented a spherical morphology with a mean diameter of 183–722 nm and gained high encapsulation efficiency over 80%. Yuan et al.262 synthesized nanoencapsulated stearic acid with an SiO2 shell by using the same method and found that the as-synthesized nanocapsules achieved a wide size distribution from 62 nm to 464 nm by controlling the ammonia-to-ethanol ratio in silica sol. They also investigated the size-control technology for nanocapsules containing the lauric acid core and SiO2 shell during the sol–gel process and observed that the mean diameters of nanocapsules were determined by several factors including the volume ratios of ammonia/TEOS, ethanol/TEOS and water/TEOS when silica sol was prepared.263 Geng et al.264 developed a nanoencapsulation technology for n-dodecanol with a SiO2 wall material through emulsion-templated in situ polycondensation using sodium silicate as a silica source and successfully synthesized nanocapsules with a particle size of 16.93–51.40 nm by controlling the agitation speed, surfactant concentration and core/shell ratio. The resulting nanoencapsulated PCM was found to exhibit a low supercooling degree, high thermal stability and acceptable latent heat-storage capacity. Liang et al.265 also reported the nanoencapsulation of n-octadecane with the SiO2 shell through interfacial hydrolysis and polycondensation in a miniemulsion system. Based on this miniemulsion templating technology as depicted in Fig. 34, the as-synthesized nanocapsules achieved a diameter in the range of 169–563 nm as well as an encapsulation efficiency of 51.5%. Moreover, Belessiotis et al.266 developed a novel infiltration method for the preparation of SiO2/paraffin composite nanospheres. In their work, some nearly monodisperse porous silica nanospheres were first synthesized, and then a paraffin PCM was loaded into these nanospheres by infiltration through a chemical affinity with the porous network of silica nanospheres. The resulting composite nanospheres achieved a promising latent heat-storage capacity due to their encapsulation efficiency as high as 78%. As for the nanoencapsulation of inorganic PCMs, Zhang et al.267 reported an in situ synthesis for bowl-like nanocapsules based on the Na2SO4·10H2O core and SiO2 shell in a reverse microemulsion-templating system. They found that the heat-storage properties of the hydrate salt were greatly improved and phase separation was inhibited due to confinement by the SiO2 matrix. In addition to nanoencapsulation with the SiO2 shell, Latibari et al.268 reported a facile synthetic method for nanoencapsulated stearic acid with a TiO2 shell through a sol–gel route, and they successfully obtained a series of core–shell structured nanocapsules with mean diameters of 583–946 nm. These nanocapsules all exhibited enhanced latent heat-storage performance and good thermal reliability. Sinha-Ray et al.269 prepared a smart tunable nanoencapsulated PCM by intercalating paraffin into carbon nanotubes by means of self-sustained diffusion and found that the nanosized PCM obtained from this route could be tailored to achieve a relatively wide working temperature range and negligible thermal response time.

9 Innovative designs of microencapsulated PCMs for versatile applications
9.1 Microencapsulation of PCMs with functional inorganic shells
Traditional microencapsulated PCMs are fabricated with conventional polymeric, inorganic or composite shells, which only provide a single protective function for PCM cores by sealing them within small capsules. However, the incorporation of these inert wall materials obviously generates inefficient allocation for encapsulated PCMs and reduces their latent heat-storage capacities accordingly. Such a deadweight loss is absolutely not expected for microencapsulated PCMs for their application in thermal energy-storage and thermal management systems. Considering that many of the inorganic materials have a feature of functional diversity, it will be possible to impart a dual-function to PCM-based microcapsules when a functional inorganic shell is fabricated on the PCM core. This idea was first realized by Fei et al.,270 and a novel type of multi-functional microcapsule based on an anatase TiO2 shell and n-octadecane/titania aerosol core was successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method in their work. The as-synthesized microcapsules actually exhibited multi-functional characteristics with photocatalytic activity and UV-blocking effectiveness as well as a thermal energy-storage function. To fabricate a well-defined core–shell structured microcapsule with a PCM core and functional TiO2 shell, Chai et al.24 developed a new synthetic strategy as described in Fig. 35. It is of vital importance that a few of the fluorine ions should be introduced to induce the crystallization of amorphous TiO2 when the in situ polycondensation of titanic precursors was performed in a nonaqueous O/W emulsion-templating system. With the brookite TiO2 shell, the as-synthesized microcapsules not only achieved an excellent thermal energy-storage capability but also exhibited photocatalytic and antibacterial functions. Liu et al.271 developed a modification technology for the brookite TiO2 shell of microencapsulated n-eicosane with graphene nanosheets and found that the photocatalytic activity of the resultant microcapsules was significantly enhanced due to the promotion of charge transfer and separation by graphene. Liu et al.33 further investigated the modification of the TiO2 shell by ZnO doping and also observed a significant enhancement in latent heat-storage capacity and photocatalysis for the resultant microcapsules. An application study demonstrated that the ZnO-doped microcapsules have good thermal regulation and thermal management properties when incorporated into gypsum-matrix composites. These research studies provide the modified microcapsules with great potential for direct solar energy utilization. Moreover, Liu and co-workers272 developed a morphology-controlled synthetic technique for the preparation of microencapsulated PCMs with a crystalline TiO2 shell by using various structure-directing agents and successfully obtained microcapsules with tubular, octahedral and spherical shapes as illustrated in Fig. 36. They also investigated the effect of morphology on the thermal energy-storage performance of these PCM-based microcapsules and found that the spherical microcapsules had the highest latent heat-storage efficiency while the tubular microcapsules exhibited the fastest heat response speed. Similar to the work by Chai et al., Zhang and co-workers273 also reported the characteristic performance of bifunctional microencapsulated PCMs composed of an n-eicosane core and ZrO2 shell synthesized by the nonaqueous O/W emulsion-templated in situ polycondensation of zirconia precursors, and they observed purple and green characteristic luminescence from the as-synthesized microcapsules with UV light excitation in addition to good latent heat-storage performance. Zhang et al.274 further carried out a doping modification for the ZrO2 shell with rare earth elements and found that the photoluminescence effectiveness of this type of bifunctional microcapsule was enhanced significantly due to the formation of a rare-earth-ZrO2 solid solution, which reduced the band-gap energy of the host and enhanced the additional sub-band-gap absorptions (Table 2).

Li et al.275 adopted ZnO as a wall material to encapsulate n-eicosane and successfully achieved core–shell structured microcapsules through an in situ precipitation reaction of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and NaOH in an emulsion templating system as illustrated in Fig. 37. The resultant microencapsulated n-eicosane not only gained an excellent thermal energy-storage capability and high working reliability but also exhibited high photocatalytic and antibacterial activities. These microcapsules specially presented high antimicrobial effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus and therefore exhibited potential applications in surgical treatment and medical care. Gao et al.276 reported the design of multi-functional PCM-based microcapsules with a Cu2O shell, and they conducted the fabrication of the Cu2O shell on the n-eicosane core through emulsion templated in situ precipitation and reduction. The synthetic reaction for this type of microcapsule seems to be complicated as shown in Fig. 38. The as-synthesized microcapsules not only showed effective photothermal conversion and high latent-heat storage/release efficiency for solar photocatalysis and solar thermal energy storage, but also exhibited gas sensitivity to some harmful organics due to a p-type semiconductive feature of the Cu2O shell. Moreover, Xu et al.277 also successfully fabricated microencapsulated paraffin with a Cu–Cu2O shell by a hydrothermal method, and enhanced photothermal conversion and light absorption performance were observed from the resultant microcapsules when applied in solar collector systems.

9.2 Diverse design of microencapsulated PCMs with hierarchical shells
There are still a number of challenges in direct encapsulation for PCMs with various functional inorganic wall materials due to limitations in inorganic species and synthetic techniques. However, it is conceivable that the expected functions can be imparted to the microcapsules by formation of a hybrid, composite or double-layered shell containing relevant functional materials. In this case, diverse designs and development for microencapsulated PCMs with hierarchical shells will be a good alternative to achieve subsidiary functions in addition to thermal energy storage and management, and a few of the studies have been focused on this issue in recent years. As a type of important bifunctional microcapsules, magnetic microencapsulated PCMs have attracted a great deal of interest from industrial and academic fields due to their potential applications in stealth aircraft and other electromagnetic-infrared double shielding military systems. However, there is a great difficulty in directly fabricating a magnetic wall material like Fe3O4 on the PCM core, because magnetic Fe3O4 particles are highly susceptible to oxidation and tend to aggregate. To endow PCM-based microcapsules with a magnetic function, Jiang et al.278 designed a nonaqueous O/W Pickering emulsion system using Fe3O4 nanoparticles as a solid stabilizer to template the interfacial polycondensation of silica precursors, and as a result, an Fe3O4/SiO2 hybrid shell was fabricated on the n-eicosane core. On the basis of this smart synthetic strategy as depicted in Fig. 39, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were incorporated into the SiO2 shell, thus imparting a superparamagnetic characteristic to the resultant microcapsules. Jiang and co-workers279 further developed an inverse emulsion-templating system for the synthesis of magnetic microcapsules based on the PEG core and organosilica shell. In this microcapsule system, superparamagnetic performance was achieved by the pre-dispersion of hydrophilic Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the hydrophilic PEG core before emulsion-templated interfacial polycondensation. The resultant microencapsulated PEG exhibited a superparamagnetic nature as well as good latent heat-storage performance and showed potential for applications in microelectronic elements and electronic devices with anti-jamming and thermal regulation functions. Lashgari et al.280 also reported the design and synthesis of dual-responsive PCM-based microcapsules to temperature and magnetic field changes through the dispersion of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in an oil phase of n-hexadecane, followed by suspension polymerization to fabricate a PMMA shell on the n-hexadecane/Fe3O4 core. Park et al.281 developed magnetic nanocapsules containing a paraffin core and PUA shell with the purpose of enhancing thermal conductance and providing a magnetic response. According to the synthetic route described in Fig. 40, they fabricated the nanocapsules through interfacial polycondensation in a Pickering-emulsion system, in which Fe3O4 nanoparticles were self-assembled onto the surface of the paraffin core. The incorporation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles not only allowed the nanocapsules to respond to external magnetic fields but also improved their thermal conductivity and heat transfer rate. Chen et al.282 designed a new type of multifunctional magnetic chitosan microcapsule containing a long-chain alkane PCM and developed a novel synthetic strategy to prepare this type of microcapsule by means of a multi-emulsification and cross-linking method in the two-step emulsification process as depicted in Fig. 41. In this synthetic process, the hydrophilic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were compelled to be distributed in the chitosan shell due to the use of a hydrophilic solvent as a second dispersion medium, thus resulting in good magnetic properties for the microcapsules. To extend the application of magnetic microencapsulated PCMs to wood, Qian et al.283 developed a novel type of thermal energy storage composite wood surface adhered with an array of the microencapsulated n-eicosane core with an Fe3O4/SiO2 hybrid shell with the aid of hydrogen bonding in the sol–gel process. Such a formation mechanism is shown in Fig. 42. This innovative design makes it feasible for magnetic PCM-based microcapsules to be applied in thermal management and temperature control of wooden furniture.

Silver-encapsulated PCMs were considered as another type of important bifunctional microcapsule due to their high electrical and thermal conductivity properties and excellent sterilization effectiveness as well as an effective function for thermal energy storage and management. Similar to magnetic microcapsules, silver-microencapsulated PCMs also could not be obtained from the direct fabrication of a silver shell on the PCM core, because the metallic silver is so soft in nature that the silver shell can hardly support the core with enough high mechanical strength and rigidity. To fabricate a silver shell on the PCM core, Zhang et al.284 designed a type of double-layered microencapsulated PCM with an SiO2 inner shell and a silver outer shell for multifunctional applications. According to the synthetic strategy shown in Fig. 43, they first performed emulsion-templated interfacial polycondensation to encapsulate n-eicosane with a silica shell containing thiol groups and then fabricated a silver layer on the silica shell through the self-assembly and reduction of Ag+. The as-prepared microcapsules exhibited multifunctional characteristics including high latent-heat storage/release efficiency, good thermal management capability, high electrical and thermal conductivities and high antibacterial activity against various Gram-negative and positive bacteria. Al-Shannaq et al.285 developed a new metal coating method for microencapsulated paraffin with a PMMA shell to enhance its thermal conductivity and heat transfer, and they used polydopamine to activate the microcapsule surface and then coated with metallic silver by an electroless plating method. The enhancement in the thermal performance of the microcapsules was remarkable as a result of surface coating with silver. Zhu et al.286 prepared silver-coated nanocapsules containing an n-octadecane core and SiO2 shell by means of the same method, and they also observed a significant improvement in thermal conductivity of the nanocapsules due to the presence of high-density metallic silver.

Moreover, Zhou et al.287 reported the design and fabrication of functional microcapsules with low infrared emissivity by coating a copper layer on the surface of microencapsulated paraffin with a PUF shell by electroless plating. Their study confirmed that the combination of the electroless copper layer and PCM core could reduce the infrared emissivity of microcapsules effectively and maintain a constant temperature around the microcapsules synchronously, which is very suitable for infrared stealth applications. Apart from pure metals, some compound semiconductors could also be used to form a functional outer layer on the microcapsule surface when double-layered microencapsulated PCMs were fabricated. Liu et al.288 synthesized a type of microencapsulated n-eicosane with a double-layered CdS/SiO2 shell through in situ precipitation of CdS on the surface of the silica shell, and the as-synthesized microcapsules exhibited the anticipated dual functions of latent heat storage and solar photocatalysis from the PCM core and CdS outer layer, respectively. Zhang et al.289 reported a type of solar-driven PCM-based microcapsule obtained by encapsulation of paraffin with a SiO2-based shell containing the Ti4O7 nanoconverter using a sol–gel method. This novel type of microencapsulated PCM exhibited both highly efficient absorption of sunlight and high conversion from light to heat due to the introduction of Ti4O7 nanoparticles into the SiO2-base shell and therefore could be used for solar-to-thermal energy conversion and storage. Moreover, bifunctional microcapsules consisting of an n-octadecane core and TiO2-doped PMMA shell were developed by Zhao et al.290 through a suspension-like polymerization route. With the small amount of TiO2 nanoparticles in the polymeric shell, the resultant microcapsules not only showed good thermal storage performance but also exhibited a shielding capability against UV radiation. Almost all of the polymeric wall materials and organic PCMs are combustible, and therefore a flame-retardant modification for microencapsulated organic PCMs with polymeric shells is necessary to meet the requirements of specific application fields. Considering a flammable nature from the combination of polymeric shells and n-alkane cores, Du et al.291 fabricated nanoencapsulated n-octadecane with the PMF shell modified with an innovative reactive phosphorus–nitrogen containing diamine (PNDA), and the schematic fabrication is presented in Fig. 44. The results showed that these microcapsules with a PNDA-modified PMF shell not only exhibited a high phase change enthalpy in the range of 110.8–141.3 J g−1, but also presented excellent flame-retardant properties due to the introduction of PNDA. Du et al.292 also designed a type of flame-retardant PCM-based nanocapsule containing an n-octadecane core and PMMA shell, and they incorporated bis(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate)amino methylphosphonate (DEAMP) into PMMA as a crosslinking agent when the microcapsules were synthesized through miniemulsion polymerization. As a reactive phosphorus-containing compound, DEAMP was found to effectively enhance the nonflammability of the resulting nanoencapsulated n-octadecane when applied in thermal energy storage and thermal regulation. These two types of flame-retardant nanoencapsulated PCMs exhibited a considerable potential for thermal energy-storage applications, especially in the fields of thermoregulatory textiles and constructions.

A state of the art design indicated that the construction of a nanostructured outer layer could endow microencapsulated PCMs with some amazing functions. Xu et al.293 reported a smart design of a hierarchical microcapsule system based on the PCM core and a nanoflake-like MnO2/SiO2 double-layered shell as an in situ temperature-regulable electrode material for supercapacitors. They first synthesized core–shell structured microcapsules containing an n-docosane core and silica shell by interfacial polycondensation and then constructed a nanoflake-like nanostructured MnO2 layer on the surface of the silica shell through template-directed self-assembly. Such a smart design philosophy and relevant surface nanostructure are clearly illustrated in Fig. 45. The obtained hierarchical microcapsule system exhibited a higher specific capacitance than the traditional MnO2 electrode at the operating temperatures higher than 45 °C due to an effective thermal management by the PCM core as well as a surface mesoporous nanostructure. Hussain et al.294 developed a type of bifunctional nanoencapsulated eutectic PCM with a double-layered SnO2/SiO2 shell for thermal and electrical energy storage. This PCM-based nanocapsule system was composed of an oleic acid–PEG eutectic core and a SiO2 based shell covered with a mild-flower-like SnO2 layer and was synthesized through emulsion-templated interfacial polycondensation, followed by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction as described in Fig. 46. With good thermal energy-storage and electrochemical performance, this nanocapsule system shows an application potential in cold thermal energy storage, microelectronic chip cooling and temperature-regulable electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. Sun et al.295 reported an interesting design of superhydrophobic thermal energy-storage materials based on a microencapsulated PCM with a nanostructured ZnO/SiO2 shell. Such a superhydrophobic microcapsule system was also fabricated by constructing a nanoflower-like ZnO layer on the silica-based shell surface of microcapsules containing an n-docosane core through the structure-induced growth of ZnO crystals according to the synthetic route shown in Fig. 47a. The nanostructure ZnO layer can provide a superhydrophobic surface for the microcapsules (see Fig. 47b) while the PCM core performs thermal energy storage and thermal management. Moreover, Wu et al.296 also synthesized superhydrophobic microcapsules based on an n-octadecane core and the PUF shell deposited with PUF nanoparticles by using a low-cost one-pot method according to the formation mechanism shown in Fig. 48. They found that the as-synthesized microcapsules achieved a large static water contact angle of 164.7° and a high phase enthalpy of 176 J g−1 due to the combination of the surface nanostructure and PCM core. These innovative designs provide microencapsulated PCMs with great potential for multifunctional applications in thermal energy storage, thermal regulation and management, self-cleaning and antifouling coatings, anticorrosion, liquid transportation and many more.

9.3 Innovative design of microencapsulated PCMs for multifunctional applications
With the rapid development of microencapsulation technology for PCMs, PCM-based microcapsules with more complicated structures and more specific functions have been explored since 2010, and there were an increasing number of innovative designs and applications reported for PCM-based microcapsules in the past decade. Moreover, some functionalized or hybrid inorganic shells could also be tailored for microencapsulated PCMs so as to fabricate bi- or multi-functional thermal energy-storage systems for specific applications. Jiang et al.297 designed an applied energy microsystem based on magnetic PCM-based microcapsules as thermoregulatory enzyme carriers for bioapplications. They synthesized magnetic microencapsulated n-eicosane with a TiO2/Fe3O4 hybrid shell through Pickering emulsion-templated interfacial polycondensation and then immobilized Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) onto the resultant microcapsules by forming covalent bonds through a series of complicated surface modification and immobilization reactions as depicted in Fig. 49. Owing to the thermoregulatory effectiveness of the PCM core, the immobilized CRL on these microcapsules was observed to have a higher biocatalytic activity, longer storage stability, higher thermal stability and better reusability compared to traditional inert enzyme carriers. Similar to the methodology developed by Jiang et al., Li and co-workers298 also developed a type of thermoregulatory enzyme carrier based on magnetic microcapsules composed of an n-docosane core and SiO2/Fe3O4 hybrid shell and investigated their immobilization technology with α-amylase and the effect of ambient temperature on their biocatalytic activity. They clearly observed a significant enhancement in biocatalytic activity for the immobilized α-amylase on the developed enzyme carriers as a result of thermoregulation to the microenvironment around the microcapsules. These studies may open up a novel direction for the development and applications of microencapsulated PCMs in biotechnological and bioengineering areas.

There have also been other innovative designs and applications for multifunctional microencapsulated PCMs reported in recent years. Li et al.299 designed and fabricated a multifunctional controlled drug release system based on hollow magnetic nanoparticles loaded with a PCM, hydrophilic doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) and/or hydrophobic paclitaxel (PTX) for cancer therapy and dual modal bioimaging. This system could be triggered by an alternating current magnetic field and, therefore, presented a near “zero release” for PTX and DOX and a precise “on” or “off” drug delivery in vitro to efficiently induce cell apoptosis. Owing to a smart combination of the PCM and magnetic nanomaterials, the system exhibited both infrared thermal imaging and magnetic resonance imaging properties and thus showed a great potential for thermo–chemo combination cancer therapy in vivo when an alternating magnetic field was applied. Choi et al.300 also designed a novel temperature-sensitive drug release system based on PCMs. In their work, gelatin nanoparticles containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran as a drug were first prepared by a typical emulsification method, and then 1-tetradecanol with a melting point of 38–39 °C was used as a PCM to fabricate PCM-matrix microbeads containing these gelatin nanoparticles by using a simple fluidic device based on an O/W emulsion. The loaded drug could be precisely released in the melt-temperature range of 1-tetradecanol without any additional triggering device. In addition, Wang et al.301 reported the design and synthesis of a microencapsulated PCM with thermochromic features as additional functions. This type of microencapsulated PCM was fabricated by encapsulating n-octadecane into a PMMA shell through suspension-like polymerization, and thermochromic pigments were dispersed in both the core and shell when the polymerization was conducted. As shown in Fig. 50a, the resultant microcapsules displayed a distinct change in color with a variation of temperature, which indicated the occurrence of thermal energy storage or release at the specific temperature. Geng et al.302 also synthesized a type of reversible thermochromic PCM-based microcapsule for application in thermal protective clothing. To achieve thermochromic reversibility for microencapsulated PCMs, they designed a three-component thermochromic core consisting of leuco dye as an electron donor, a phenolic color developer as an electron donor and 1-tetradecanol as a PCM and carried out emulsion-templated copolymerization to encapsulate the three-component core with a poly(methylated melamine-formaldehyde) (PMMF) shell. The obtained microcapsules showed a reversible thermochromic characteristic associated with the phase state of the PCM (see Fig. 50b) and thus could provide visual evidence for energy storage or release. This type of microencapsulated PCM exhibited a great potential for application in the thermal protective clothing of fire fighters as well as intelligent textiles or fabrics, food and medicine package, and so on. Moreover, Wu et al.303 reported the fabrication of a reversible thermochromic microcapsule system through encapsulation of 1-hexadecanol by complex coacervation of modified gelatin and gum Arabic. In this microcapsule system, 2-phenylamino-3-methyl-6-di-n-butylamino-fluoran and 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane were incorporated into the wall material as a color former and color developer, respectively, and the thermochromic mechanism is clearly described in Fig. 51. Such a microcapsule system can act as an indicator for the states of energy saturation and consumption through color changes. In addition, some of the paraffin PCMs like heptane are volatile and hard to be kept within microcapsules. To confirm the retention of volatile cargos within microencapsulated PCMs with low freezing points, Zhang et al.304 developed a polysaccharide-assisted microencapsulation method for microencapsulated volatile PCMs with a fluorescent retention indicator, and they synthesized microcapsules based on a heptane core and polymeric shell through a one-step in situ polymerization route. Nile red as a fluorescent indicator was incorporated into the core during the synthetic process, and therefore the fluorophores in Nile red could give a clear indication of the core and shell structures of microcapsules.

10 Summary and outlooks
To meet the requirements of applications in modern energy fields, microencapsulation of solid–liquid PCMs has become a promising technology not only for the leakage proof of core materials and the enhancement of thermal energy-storage efficiency but also for the achievement of additional functions in specific applications. This review focused on the innovative design and fabrication of microencapsulated PCMs for diverse applications in recent years, and the most recent progress in the microencapsulation technology strategy, performance characterization and application strategy was introduced in detail and analyzed intensively. In the past two decades, a large number of research groups have investigated synthetic methodologies, microstructures and a variety of properties of microencapsulated PCMs with various core and shell materials to increase the encapsulation efficiency and latent heat-storage capacity and enhance the performance of PCM-based microcapsules as well as to prevent the core from leakage and flowing out of the microcapsules. The research and development of microencapsulation technique has brought about a series of PCM-based microcapsules with a high thermal energy-storage capability and long-term durability. The microencapsulation of PCMs with polymeric shells has been facilely realized through an emulsion or suspension polymerization route, and the resulting polymeric shells can not only provide an effective protection as well as a stable form/shape for the encapsulated PCMs but also increase the surface-to-volume ratio to improve heat transfer for them. The fabrication of organic–inorganic hybrid/composite shells on the PCM cores can further enhance the thermal conductance, thermal stability and leakage proof of microencapsulated PCMs. The successful application of inorganic wall materials for microencapsulation of PCMs has been considered as a revolutionary technical innovation, because inorganic shells exhibit much higher thermal conductivity and mechanical strength, better tightness, better thermal and chemical stabilities, and nonflammability compared to traditional polymeric shells, thus leading to faster heat transfer, better sealing effect, higher phase transition stability and reliability, longer durability and better anti-osmosis performance for the resulting microencapsulated PCMs. By now, a variety of inorganic materials have been successfully used to fabricate PCM-based microcapsules with high encapsulation efficiency and a well-defined core–shell structure. Many promising advancements have been achieved for these microcapsules by selecting suitable wall materials and controlling the synthetic conditions, endowing microencapsulated PCMs with a much wider range of applications in thermal energy storage and thermal management. The nanoencapsulation of PCMs still has great potential to be explored for achieving much higher thermal energy-storage efficiency and more significant thermal performance. The encapsulation of PCMs with bio-based and biodegradable materials is a promising research direction due to the double sustainability. The aspect of bio-microencapsulated PCMs is still poorly developed but has a great potential to study the materials and methodology.
With the development of new methodologies for microencapsulation of PCMs, followed by the formation of various inorganic shells, microencapsulated PCMs have received some new inorganic functional materials as shells along with additional physicochemical functions. The diverse design and fabrication of bi- or multi-functional PCM-based microcapsules have been proposed as a new design idea for future research directions, and there have been several successful cases reported as discussed in this review. These studies have provided important references for the design and preparation of novel latent heat-storage materials. These technological advancements are very beneficial for the development of microencapsulated PCMs and also promote the relevant applications of PCMs. The widespread applications of PCMs as energy storage materials have already attracted significant attention in the field of clean and renewable energy. Based on an in-depth review on research and development of microencapsulated PCMs, some major conclusions could be summarized as follows:
(1) The rapidly growing demand for thermal energy storage materials is driving the development of high-performance PCMs with a high latent heat-storage capacity and long-term working durability, whose practical applications will play important roles in solving the serious energy and environment problems.
(2) Microencapsulation technology not only effectively overcomes the drawbacks of solid–liquid PCMs such as fluidity in the liquid state, easy leakage, volatilization, handling difficulty and interaction with the surrounding environment, but also greatly enhances their thermal conductance and heat transfer. Microencapsulation of solid–liquid PCMs has been a promising means to extend the application of PCMs to a much broader applicable range.
(3) The microencapsulation of PCMs with polymeric shells is not completely in accordance with the application requirements due to the inherent limitation of organic materials. Inorganic encapsulation can provide more advantages for microencapsulated PCMs and therefore will gain much more attention from fundamental research to commercial development in the future.
(4) To obtain a well-defined core–shell structured microencapsulated PCM with a good thermal energy-storage capability, a few of the important design parameters should be carefully addressed, which include the weight ratio of raw materials for the core and shell, the selection of the dispersion medium and other additives, reaction temperature and time, agitation speed, particle size and its distribution, and shell thickness. However, it is vital to strike a proper balance between the mechanical strength and encapsulation efficiency by optimizing the weight ratio of the core and shell.
(5) Theoretical and experimental studies on microencapsulated PCMs should still be strengthened in terms of their thermophysical properties and heat transfer characteristics to find available solutions to the problems in reversibility, recoverability, reliability and durability of phase transitions as well as high supercooling.
(6) Nanoencapsulation is a promising new technology for PCMs because it can provide a more stable structure, better mechanical support, longer working durability, and faster heat transfer efficiency for PCMs than conventional microencapsulation technology. In this case, nanoencapsulated PCMs have a great potential for technological development and application exploitation.
(7) Bio-base and biodegradable microencapsulated PCMs have also an application potential for development in the fields of food industry, smart fibers and textiles, bio-catalysis, pharmaceutical industry and medical care. Owing to the lack of suitable bio-based biodegradable wall materials for the formation of microcapsule shells, there are still a great number of efforts that are required to tackle a series of technological barriers to achieve these goals.
(8) There has been a significant growth of interest in development and applications of bi- and multi-functional PCM-based microcapsules due to the requirement for versatile applications of PCMs. More new materials and new synthetic techniques are necessarily explored to offer vast possibilities for the design and fabrication of advanced bi- and multi-functional microencapsulated PCMs with far superior properties and functions to the traditional ones.
It is no doubt that traditional microencapsulated PCMs can meet the requirements for application in thermal energy storage through a bulk thermal management system. However, there have still been a series of technological challenges in microencapsulation of PCMs as well as in relevant microcapsule products. Supercooling and crystallization confinement are two major challenges derived from microencapsulated organic and inorganic PCMs, which evidently slow down the thermal response and thus reduce the heat charging/discharging efficiency. Other challenges include difficulty in the synthesis of well-defined core–shell structured microencapsulated inorganic PCMs with inorganic shells, potential corrosion of shell materials caused by inorganic PCMs, remarkably reduced heat-storage capacity due to the inert wall materials, high production cost for microencapsulation, complicated synthetic procedures for multilayered PCM-based microcapsules, etc. Furthermore, standard testing methods should be established for the measurement of some characteristic properties for microencapsulated PCMs such as heat-responsive rate, heat-charging/discharging rate, anti-osmosis properties, multicycle thermal circulating performance, mechanical strength and crack damage stress. These results and data are very important for evaluating the operational reliability and application endurance of microencapsulated PCMs with various shells. To respond to these challenges, the research and development of microencapsulated PCMs is still supposed to focus on the utilization of new wall materials and the exploitation of new synthetic techniques on the basis of a full understanding of formation and reaction mechanisms.
On the other hand, more advanced microscopic fields such as microelectronic chips, micro-sized sensors, and miniaturized electric devices have opened the door for applications of PCM-based microcapsules, in which each of the microcapsules not only has to act as an individual thermoregulatory component to fulfill in situ thermal management, but also has to provide other custom-designed physicochemical functions. These new trends are calling for innovative designs of PCM-based microcapsules with desired specific physicochemical functions as well as a more precise thermal regulation capability. The design of hierarchical microcapsules is one of the most promising solutions to meet this requirement and will be a potential area of future research for development of next generation PCM-based microcapsules. Nevertheless, there are lots of challenges in this issue, and overall efforts to construct hierarchical nanostructures on PCM-based microcapsules are highly necessary for scientists to make it clear from methodology to formation mechanisms. It is anticipated that the development of new generation bi- and multi-functional microcapsules based on hierarchical structures can greatly extend the applicable range of PCMs from traditional thermal energy fields to cutting-edge applications.
