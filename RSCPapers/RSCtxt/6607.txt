    , Accepted 5th January 2021First published on 5th January 2021AbstractNonfullerene organic solar cells have received much attention in recent years due to their low cost, high absorption coefficient and excellent synthetic flexibility. However, the microscopic photoinduced dynamics at corresponding donor–acceptor interfaces remains unclear. In this work, we have firstly employed state-of-the-art TDDFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations in combination with static electronic structure calculations to explore the ultrafast photoinduced dynamics at a typical nonfullerene donor–acceptor PTB7:PDI interface using a minimal model system (172 atoms). Upon excitation with specific wavelength of light, both PTB7 and PDI can be locally excited to generate |PTB7*〉 and |PDI*〉 excitons due to their high absorption ability and significant overlap in absorption spectrum. After that, these localized excitons gradually convert to charge transfer exciton |PTB7+PDI−〉, while another |PTB7−PDI+〉 charge transfer exciton is not involved in the whole process. Along with the exciton conversion, electron transfer from PTB7 to PDI (channel I charge generation) and the hole transfer from PDI to PTB7 (channel II charge generation) occurs simultaneously with time constants of 643 fs and 549 fs respectively. In the same time, D index that measures the centroid distance of electron and hole increases from 1.0 Å to 4.0 Å, which clearly reflects a charge transfer process at the interface. Our present work provides solid evidence that both channel I and channel II charge generation processes play important roles at PTB7:PDI interface, which could be helpful for the design of novel nonfullerene solar cells with better photovoltaic performance.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered to be one of the most promising candidates for the next generation solar cells due to their low cost, nontoxicity, flexibility and easy fabrication.1–9 As the key component of such devices, choosing proper electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials is crucial to improve their power conversion efficiency (PCE). In the past few decades, fullerene-based acceptor materials have been the most commonly used acceptor due to their excellent electron transport properties.10–16 However, these fullerene acceptors suffer from several limitations, such as weak absorption in the UV-visible region, difficulty in tuning electronic/optical properties via chemical modifications, and poor photostability, which severely prevents further performance improvements of OSCs. In order to overcome these shortcomings, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) based OSCs came into being and their performances have been greatly improved in the past ten years with a record PCE exceeding 16%.17–25
A deep understanding of the charge generation process at the D–A interface is of fundamental importance for improving the PCE of organic solar cells.23,24,26 Due to the weak absorption of fullerene-based acceptors, most of the previous works focus mainly on the photoinduced electron transfer from donor to acceptor, which is known as channel I charge generation process. However, lots of NFAs show strong absorption in the UV-visible region of solar spectrum and hole transfer from acceptor to donor, namely the channel II charge generation process, also plays a non-negligible role.26 One typical category of nonfullerene acceptor with such excellent optoelectronic properties is the perylene diimide (PDI)-based acceptors.27–37 In particular, Zhong et al. design a helical PDI dimer acceptor via ring-fusion as shown in the top panel of Fig. 1.36 In combination with the commercially available electron donor PTB7 and PBDTT-TT, they find that the resulted PCE can be as high as 6.1%. Additionally, transient absorption spectroscopy further reveals that both channel I and channel II charge generation occurs within 1 ps, which could be one of the possible reasons for their excellent efficiency. Later on, the same group synthesized a series of elongated helical PDIs and the PCE has been improved over 8%.37 Although these experiments have given valuable information on the macroscopic photoinduced dynamics, the microscopic details at atomic level of this kind of nonfullerene donor–acceptor interfaces remain unclear.

Despite the numerous experimental works concerning about the nonfullerene donor–acceptor interfaces, theoretical investigations are rather limited and most of them are mainly devoted to exploring the relationship between the structures and corresponding frontier molecular orbitals.32,34,36,38–40 The charge generation dynamics at nonfullerene acceptor based interfaces, which is in close relationship with the excited state properties and is crucial for achieving high PCE in OSCs have hardly been explored before theoretically.41–55 Until recently, calculations that focus on the excited state properties of nonfullerene donor–acceptor begin to emerge. For instance, Sui et al. systematically investigate a series hexabenzocoronene based NFAs by bridging dimers and modulating structural twists and compare their photovoltaic properties with the help of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations.56 Han et al.'s work suggests that local excitation/charge-transfer hybridization promotes the charge generation and reduces nonradiative voltage loss simultaneously in a nonfullerene DRTB-T:IT-4F OSC based on their TDDFT calculations.57 Polkehn et al. employ Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method to investigate the charge separation dynamics at the bisthiophene–perylene diimide type donor–acceptor co-oligomer aggregates.58 However, theoretical work concerning about the charge generation dynamics at nonfullerene donor–acceptor interface formed by PTB7 and PDI has never been conducted before to our best knowledge.
Inspired by these issues, we have firstly in this work employed our recently developed TDDFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and static electronic structure calculations to explore the photoinduced dynamics at the PTB7 and PDI interface with a minimal model that consists of one PDI molecule and one PTB7 molecule with two units (denoted as PTB7:PDI afterwards).59–61 Our computational results provide the first theoretical evidence that both channel I and channel II play important roles at this PTB7:PDI interface upon photoexcitation, which could be helpful for the design of novel nonfullerene donor–acceptor interfaces with excellent photovoltaic performances.
2. Simulation details
The minimum-energy structures of PTB7, PDI and PTB7:PDI interfaces studied in this work are firstly optimized using B3LYP+D3/6-31G* method.62–68 Vertical excitation energies are computed by TD-CAM-B3LYP method that has been proved to be accurate for charge transfer states.59,69
In nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, potential energies, time derivative nonadiabatic couplings, etc. are calculated at TD-CAM-B3LYP level.69 Time derivative nonadiabatic couplings between two involved electronic states are numerically computed using our recently implemented algorithm.59,60,70,71 Empirical quantum decoherence correction of Granucci et al. is added in surface hopping simulations.72 Moreover, nonadiabatic dynamics simulations are performed with classical path approximation, which has been demonstrated to work very well for describing excited-state relaxation without involving large conformational change and chemical bond-making and -breaking.46,48,59,60,71,73 The system is first heated to 300 K and equilibrated for 1 ps using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at PBE + D3 level.66,74 Time step of 1.0 fs is used for nuclear propagation and Nosé-Hoover chain thermostat technique with a chain length of five is used to control temperature around 300 K in Born-Oppenheimer based canonical molecular dynamics simulations.75,76 Then, microcanonical dynamics simulations of 2 ps are performed and 500 initial conditions are generated according to specific requirements mentioned in the main text. The 1 ps equilibration and 2 ps sampling scheme are much shorter than that used in molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations for large biology or material systems which usually contain thousands of atoms. Such large systems indeed need a much longer equilibration time (hundreds or even thousands of picoseconds) to explore processes that take place in several nanoseconds. However, considering the much smaller size of current system (172 atoms in total), the ultrafast charge generation processes (time constant less than 1 ps), and the expensive computational efforts for the DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations as well as subsequent TDDFT calculations (more than 24 h for a single TDDFT calculation with single CPU), the molecular dynamics simulations time is much reduced. In order to verify the validation of our equilibration process, we have also plot the time dependent total energy along the 1 ps NVT simulation, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We can see that after the initial increase, the total energy fluctuates around a constant value. This methodology has been used in previous nonadiabatic dynamics simulations by us and other groups and has provided valuable insights into the ultrafast electron and hole transfer dynamics in various systems.48,59
Starting from each initial condition, 300 surface hopping trajectories are propagated for 1 ps. In order to reflect detailed balance condition under classical path approximation, hop rejection and velocity rescaling are replaced by scaling transition probabilities pkj(t) with a Boltzmann factorpkj(t) = pkj(t)bkj(t)(Ej > Ek)where . This modification has been successfully employed in many ab initio based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of materials.46,48,59,60,71,73,77 All CAM-B3LYP and TD-CAM-B3LYP calculations are carried out using GAUSSIAN09.78 Molecular dynamics simulations at PBE + D3 level are conducted using QUICKSTEP module implemented in CP2K5.1 with DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH basis sets and Goedecker–Teter–Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials.79–84 In this work, all nonadiabatic dynamics simulations are conducted using GTSH package.85 Relevant electron–hole density and centroid distances are calculated using Multiwfn3.6.86,87 The relevant theoretical backgrounds can be found in ESI,† and our previous published works.59–61
3. Results and discussion
The structure of the constructed PTB7:PDI interface is firstly optimized at B3LYP+D3 level using the 6-31G* basis set,62–68 as depicted in the bottom of Fig. 1. Structurally, PTB7 molecule is located on the top of PDI molecule, and the distance between centroid of PDI and PTB7 is estimated to be 2.84 Å. Once heated to 300 K, the centroid distance increases to an averaged value of 3.64 Å, indicating that the two fragments are mainly combined via non-covalent interactions. Compared with the single molecule of PDI or PTB7, PDI fragment in PTB7:PDI remains almost its original structure, while PTB7 fragment is twisted towards PDI molecule significantly, which is in stark contrast to the more planar structure of PTB7 alone (see Fig. S2, ESI†). This twisted interface can be attributed to the strong interaction between PDI and PTB7 and the adsorption energy of this heterostructure can be as high as −63.0 kcal mol−1. In order to further clarify the origin of this strong non-covalent interaction, we have also optimized the structures without van der Waals corrections. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), PTB7 in this optimized structure of PTB7:PDI without van der Waals correction is less twisted, and the centroid distance increases from 2.84 Å to 4.36 Å, indicating a much weaker interaction between PDI and PTB7 molecule. The corresponding adsorption energy is −6.8 kcal mol−1, which is almost ten times less than the van der Waals corrected result. Such a huge difference indicates that van der Waals interaction plays an indispensable role in this heterostructure and reveals the importance of including van der Waals correction to obtain reasonable results.
Based on the optimized structure, we have calculated the vertical excited state properties of this PTB7:PDI heterostructure using the TDDFT method with range separated functional CAM-B3LYP,69 which has been proved to be useful for exploring excited-state properties, and photoinduced energy or electron transfer dynamics of similar systems.88–92 In panel (a) of Fig. 2, we present the electron and hole density of the lowest lying four singlet excited states using the method implemented in Multiwfn3.6.86,87 It is obvious that S1 and S2 states are both charge transfer states with electron mainly localized on PDI and hole localized on PTB7. In contrast, for S3 state, both electron and hole are localized on PTB7, which corresponds to the local excitation of PTB7. As to S4 state, the electron and hole are localized on PDI molecule and can therefore be regarded as local excited state of PDI. Further analysis of their excitation energy and oscillator strengths indicate that both local excitation states of PTB7 and PDI have considerable oscillator strengths, i.e. 0.77 and 0.46, which usually correspond to the bright states in absorption spectra. On the contrary, the charge transfer states have much smaller oscillator strengths (0.0095 and 0.1146) and therefore contribute little to the absorption spectra. In addition, the local excitation energies of PDI and PTB7 are close to each other (2.43 eV vs. 2.53 eV). These results are also reflected in panel (b) of Fig. 2, which shows the simulated absorption spectrum based on the optimized structure with the lowest 15 singlet excited states. There are three peaks that located in 378 nm, 439 nm and 507 nm respectively and the peak at 507 nm is the strongest one, which is mainly contributed by the local excitation of PDI and PTB7 and the local excitation of PDI is a little blue shifted in comparison with that of PTB7. The peak at 378 nm, however, is mainly composed of the local excitation of PTB7 while the 439 nm peak is contributed by the combination of PDI and PTB7 local excitation, and the charge transfer excitation from PTB7 to PDI. However, this spectrum shape changes slightly when including the nuclear dynamical effects,93,94 as shown in panel (c) of Fig. 2. The 439 and 507 nm peaks observed in previous spectrum merged into a broad band that peaked at 501 nm with a shoulder at 450 nm. This band is mainly composed of the local excitation of PDI and PTB7 while the charge transfer states PTB7 → PDI also have minor contribution. Another peak at 369 nm is still similar to previous one, which is mainly contributed by the local excitation of PTB7. From this spectrum, several important conclusions can be drawn: (1) the absorption spectrum is mainly composed of local excitation of PDI and PTB7 while the PTB7 → PDI charge transfer states also have minor contribution; (2) PDI and PTB7 absorption exhibit large overlap in the absorption band that peaked at 500 nm. These results imply that when excited with ca. 500 nm light, both PTB7 and PDI might be excited, from which subsequent electron and hole transfer dynamics start to take place; (3) due to the lower energy of the charge transfer states, the internal conversion from local excitation states to charge transfer states, which is usually followed by charge separation processes is energetically more favourable.

Also shown are the contributions of different kinds of excitations. 
Although previous static calculations have given valuable insights into the excited state properties of the PTB7:PDI surface, the electron and hole transfer dynamics remain unclear and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations are needed to quantitatively elucidating the relevant processes. In order to confirm initial populated excited states upon excitation, we found the states mainly composed of PDI or PTB7 local excitation lying around 500 nm and count their state distributions, as shown in Fig. 3. Most of the local excited states of PDI or PTB7 are distributed in the range from S2 to S4 states. For PDI, the most localized excited state is S3 while for PTB7, the most one is S2 state. The averaged local excited state energies of PDI and PTB7 are 2.49 eV and 2.48 eV respectively, which further seconds the fact that both PDI and PTB7 can be locally excited with the energy around 2.48 eV (500 nm).

In real devices, if the donor and acceptor have significant overlap in the absorption spectrum, absorption of the resulted donor–acceptor interface will usually be a combination of the separated ones, which indicates that both donor and acceptor can be lifted to excited states and contribute to the charge generation processes. In this work, both PTB7 and PDI can be locally excited with comparable probabilities due to their similar vertical excitation energies and the absorption strengths at ∼500 nm. In order to simulate the situations similar to the real world, comparable different initial excitations are selected to simulate the possible charge generation dynamics at around 500 nm. In short, we choose a set of initial excited states with a mixture of local excited states of PDI and PTB7 based on the results shown in Fig. 3. A total of 500 initial conditions are chosen and for each local excitation, 300 trajectories are then propagated for about 1 ps. These trajectories are finally averaged to obtain statistical results. The details of the simulation and analysis methods can be found in ESI,† and our previous works.59–61
In the framework of fewest-switches surface-hopping method developed by Tully et al.,95 time-dependent total electronic states is the linear combination of interested adiabatic excited states  in which cj(t) is a time dependent coefficient for the jth electronic state. In linear response TDDFT, Ψj is represented by linear combination of a series of singly excited Slater determinants Ψai with coefficients wjia96  in which the index i and a represent occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals, respectively. These singly excited Slater determinants Ψai can be regarded as excitons with hole in ith occupied and electron in ath unoccupied MOs. Importantly, mathematical transformation on these MO-based excitons Ψai with cj(t) and wjia can lead to fragment-based local excited and charge transfer excitons, e.g. |PDI*〉, |PTB7*〉, |PTB7−PDI+〉, and |PTB7+PDI−〉 in our presently studied PTB7:PDI interface, which is helpful for clarifying the relevant exciton dynamics. It is worth to notify that the ground state is not involved in our present nonadiabatic dynamics simulations since we are mainly focused on the ultrafast charge generation dynamics of PTB7:PDI heterostructure instead of the charge recombination processes.
Based on the dynamical results, we firstly analyse the exciton dynamics of the PTB7:PDI interface upon photoexcitation. As shown in panel (a) of Fig. 4. The initial excitons are mainly consist of |PDI*〉 and |PTB7*〉 with a weight of ca. 0.5 and 0.4 respectively. As time goes by, both local excitons |PDI*〉 and |PTB7*〉 decay gradually to nearly zero in subsequent 1 ps. In the same time, the weight of charge transfer exciton |PTB7+PDI−〉 increases monotonously from ca. 0.1 to 0.9. However, the |PTB7−PDI+〉 exciton is not involved in the whole process and the weight remains to be zero all the time. The exciton dynamics clearly reveals that the local excitation excitons |PDI*〉 and |PTB7*〉 converts to charge transfer exciton |PTB7+PDI−〉 upon excitation. However, the details of charge generation dynamics remain unclear.

In order to clarify the charge generation mechanism, we further calculated the time-dependent weights of electron and hole that localized on PDI and PTB7, as shown in panel (b) and panel (c) of Fig. 4. As can be seen, the weights of electron that initially localized on PDI and PTB7 are 0.6 and 0.4 respectively. We can see that although electron transfer and hole transfer share similar trends, the initial dynamics within 100 fs are different. As elaborated previously, the initial excitation at ∼500 nm mainly results in two kinds of local excitons of PDI and PTB7. Even though the initial excited two local excitons share similar excitation energy and oscillator strengths, the local exciton |PDI*〉 overall has a little higher energy than |PTB7*〉. Therefore, in the early stage of the simulation (∼100 fs), parts of the local exciton |PDI*〉 will convert to the local exciton |PTB7*〉, which subsequently convert to the charge transfer exciton |PTB7+PDI−〉. The conversion of |PDI*〉 to |PTB7*〉 will result in the decrease [increase] of both electron and hole weight of PDI [PTB7]. However, due to the conversion of |PTB7*〉 to|PTB7+PDI−〉, the increased electron will then transfer back to the PDI. As a result, the electron weight on PDI and PTB7 remains nearly unchanged in the first 100 fs while the hole weight decreases [increases] in the same timescale for PDI [PTB7]. As time goes by, the electron weight of PDI gradually increases while that of PTB7 decreases in the subsequent simulation time, indicating a clear electron transfer process from PTB7 to PDI (channel I). In contrast to the electron transfer dynamics, the hole weight of PTB7 increases gradually to 1.0 while that of PDI decreases gradually to 0.0 in the same time, which clearly reflects a PDI to PTB7 hole transfer (channel II) process. The time constants of channel I and channel II are estimated to be 643 and 549 fs respectively using a single exponential function y = A × exp(−x/t). Therefore, efficient charge generation can be achieved due to this simultaneously ultrafast channel I and channel II charge generation processes. Although previous exciton conversion and the electron and hole transfer dynamics have provide valuable insights into the charge generation processes of PTB7:PDI interface, none of these parameters directly reflect the extent of charge transfer, which is crucial for the subsequent charge separation to free carrier process. The D index which is defined as the distance between the centroid of electron and hole (see ESI,† for theoretical backgrounds) can be used to reflect the extent of the charge transfer. And this parameter might also be useful for future comparison of the charge transfer extent of different donor–acceptor interfaces. As shown in panel (d) of Fig. 4, the D index gradually increases from ca. 1.0 Å to 4.0 Å within 1 ps, which directly reveals the efficient charge transfer dynamics and might be crucial for the subsequent charge separation to free carriers.
To further verify the exact roles of PDI and PTB7 in the charge generation dynamics, we have also carried out nonadiabatic dynamics simulations that employ local excitation of PDI or PTB7 as initial excited states only and the electron and hole transfer dynamics are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). For |PDI*〉 initial states simulations, the electron that localized on PDI sharply decrease from 0.9 to 0.6 in the first 50 fs and then grows back to ca. 1.0 in 1 ps simulations while the hole on PDI sharply decrease in the first 50 fs and then decrease slowly to nearly zero in subsequent time (see panel (a) and (b) in Fig. S4, ESI†). These results indicate that local excitation of PDI mainly promotes the hole transfer dynamics from PDI to PTB7. The sharp decrease of the hole transfer in the first 50 fs can be attributed the change of adiabatic states characters due to the near degenerate energy of |PTB7*〉 and |PDI*〉. In contrast, local excitation of PTB7 mainly induces electron transfer from PTB7 to PDI while the hole transfer plays a minor role in the whole process as shown in panel (c) and panel (d) of Fig. S4 (ESI†). These results provide solid evidence that PDI and PTB7 are mainly responsible for the hole and electron transfer respectively in the charge generation dynamics of PTB7:PDI interface.
To rationalize the ultrafast electron and hole transfer dynamics, we have additionally done in-depth analysis concerning about the relevant excited states. As stated before, every adiabatic excited state can be decomposed into the linear recombination of these four fragment-based excitons, namely two local exciton |PTB7*〉, |PDI*〉 and two charge transfer exciton |PTB7+PDI−〉 and |PTB7−PDI+〉 and the weights of these four excitons represent the corresponding contributions to the adiabatic states. In present case, the S1 excited states is mainly composed by the charge transfer exciton |PTB7+PDI−〉 while both local exciton |PTB7*〉 and |PDI*〉, and charge transfer exciton |PTB7+PDI−〉 have more or less contributions to other relevant adiabatic states from S2 to S4. The nonadiabatic dynamics simulations are conducted based on the adiabatic states and the time-dependent fragment-based notations can be obtained via several mathematical calculations. As a result, the relevant exciton conversion, electron transfer and hole transfer are closely related with the nonadiabatic transitions between adiabatic excited states even though there is no one-to-one correspondence between the adiabatic states Sn and the fragment-based notation. Therefore, a deep understanding the nonadiabatic transition processes is crucial for elucidating the relevant charge generation dynamics.
It is known that the energy differences as well as nonadiabatic couplings between excited states are usually responsible for the nonadiabatic transitions of excited states. Therefore, we have counted the energy differences distributions and averaged non-adiabatic couplings of the lowest four excited states. As shown in Fig. 5, the energy differences can be classified into two classes according to their distributions. The adjacent energy difference from S2 to S4 are mainly located in the range of 0–4 kcal mol−1. In the meantime, the non-adiabatic couplings of between these adjacent states are also much larger and ranges from 40 to 60 ps−1, which is also understandable due to the close relationship between energy difference and nonadiabatic coupling vector, i.e.  in which Ψi and Ψj are two involved adiabatic electronic states, and Ej and Ei are their related energies. Therefore, nonadiabatic transitions between these states are ultrafast and higher states will decay to S2 rapidly as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). However, the decay of S2 to S1 is somewhat slower due to the larger energy gaps (∼6 kcal mol−1) and smaller NACs (∼20 ps−1) shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S5 (ESI†). In combination with previous results, we can conclude that the S2 to S1 nonadiabatic transition is the rate-determining step of the charge generation process.
 Fig. 5  Distribution of averaged energy gaps (in kcal mol−1) of the two nearest electronic states Ei+1 − Ei among the four lowest excited singlet states in the nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and averaged nonadiabatic couplings between these electronic states (in ps−1). The state i in this figure represents the ith singlet excited states since the ground state is not considered in our present work. See text for discussion. 
In addition, since nonadiabatic transitions are closely related to the energy differences of adjacent adiabatic states. We have therefore conducted Fourier transformation of the time-dependent energy differences of relevant states, i.e. E4–E3, E3–E2 and E2–E1, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The Fourier transformation results indicate that there is nearly no frequency with significant amplitude influences the E4–E3 and E3–E2 energy differences. However, due to the small energy gaps between these states, the nonadiabatic transitions can easily take place regardless of specific nuclear motions. In contrast, for E2–E1, frequencies around 1536 cm−1 have the most significant contribution, which corresponds to the stretching vibrations of both PTB7 and PDI skeletons and can thus be regarded as the relevant nuclear motions governing the nonadiabatic transitions from S2 to S1, i.e. the charge generation dynamics.
Finally, as a pioneering work that explores the photoinduced dynamics at nonfullerene D–A interface using the TDDFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, we have used one minimal model that consists of one PDI molecule and one PTB7 molecule with two units due to its large size (172 atom in this work). Such heterostructure is still very different from that used in experiments, especially the polymer PTB7 which usually consists of much more units rather than the only two units used in present work. Therefore, the absorption of PTB7 is much blue shifted than that in experiment due to the reduction of conjugation length. In addition, the PTB7 itself is a donor–acceptor polymer in experiments and exhibits a degree of charge-transfer character, which is not revealed by the simplified model in this work. Therefore, the explorations with more realistic models similar to experiments and the corresponding effects to the electron and hole transfer dynamics are currently underway. Nevertheless, the gained insights in present work remain helpful for understanding photoinduced interfacial properties of PTB7:PDI based heterostructures.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have in this work firstly explored the excited state properties, electron and hole transfer dynamics etc. at a nonfullerene donor–acceptor interfaces PTB7:PDI employing TDDFT-based static calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. Upon excitation with specific wavelength of light, both PDI and PTB7 can be locally excited due to their significant overlap in the absorption spectra. After that, these locally excited excitons gradually convert to charge transfer exciton |PTB7+PDI−〉 while another charge transfer exciton |PTB7−PDI+〉 is not involved in the whole process. Along with the exciton conversion, the electron transfer from PTB7 to PDI and the hole transfer from PDI to PTB7 occurs simultaneously with a time constant of 643 fs and 549 fs respectively, indicating that both channel I and channel II contributes significantly to the charge generation processes. In the same time, D index that measure the centroid distance of electron and hole increases from 1.0 to 4.0 Å, revealing an obvious charge transfer process. Our present work not only provides valuable insights into the charge generation dynamics at the PTB7:PDI interface, but can also be helpful for the design of novel nonfullerene donor–acceptor interfaces with better photovoltaic performance.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  The chemical structure of PDI and PTB7 (top) and the B3LYP+D3 optimized minimal PTB7:PDI interface model investigated in present work (bottom).	 
pkj(t) = pkj(t)bkj(t)(Ej > Ek)

 	Fig. 2  TD-CAM-B3LYP calculated (a) electron (electron accumulation, in iceblue) and hole (electron deletion, in orange) density of the lowest four excited states; (b) the absorption spectra simulated using the optimized structure with the lowest 15 excited states; (c) the absorption spectra simulated using the NVE ensemble with the lowest 15 excited states. Also shown are the contributions of different kinds of excitations.	 

 	Fig. 3  Distributions of excited states that correspond to local excitation of PDI (left) and PTB7 (right) respectively.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 4  Time-dependent weights of (a) different excitons; (b) electron that localized on PDI and PTB7; (c) hole that localized on PDI and PTB7; (d) centroid distance of the of hole and electron (D index) obtained from the TDDFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 5  Distribution of averaged energy gaps (in kcal mol−1) of the two nearest electronic states Ei+1 − Ei among the four lowest excited singlet states in the nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and averaged nonadiabatic couplings between these electronic states (in ps−1). The state i in this figure represents the ith singlet excited states since the ground state is not considered in our present work. See text for discussion.
