    , Accepted 31st August 2015First published on 2nd September 2015AbstractTwo D–A copolymers P1 and P2 were developed by copolymerizing a new lactam acceptor unit, [7,7′-bidithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyridine]-5,5′(4H,4′H)-dione (BDTP), with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) or selenophene. The copolymers have good solubility, thermal stability and deep HOMO levels. P2:PC71BM solar cells gave a PCE of 6.76%, with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 9.96 mA cm−2 and an outstanding FF of 74.5%.
Though the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a single polymer solar cell (PSC) has reached 10.8%,1 it still needs to be improved significantly for future commercialization. D–A copolymers have been widely used as electron donors in PSCs for achieving a high PCE because of their excellent optical absorption and high mobilities.2 Among them, lactam-containing polymers have shown promising photovoltaic performance. These reported lactam acceptor units include diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),3 isoindigo (IID),4 benzodipyrrolidone (BDP),5 thieno[2′,3′:5,6]pyrido[3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione (TPTI)6 and others.7 They possess structural advantages: first, the strong electron-withdrawing capability of lactam units enables effective tuning of material bandgaps;8 second, the carbonyl groups on lactam can improve the backbone planarity and polymer crystallinity;9 third, long alkyl chains at the N-position of the lactam ring render good solubility.10 Recently, we developed a new lactam acceptor unit, 4,4′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-[7,7′-bidithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyridine]-5,5′(4H,4′H)-dione (BDTP), which consists of two tricyclic lactam units. PThBDTP:PC71BM solar cells gave a decent PCE of 9.13%.11 Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and selenophene were selected as the donor units due to their good electron-donating properties.12 Two D–A copolymers P1 and P2 based on BDTP and BDT or selenophene were synthesized (Scheme 1). P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM inverted solar cells gave PCEs of 5.05% and 6.76%, respectively.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of P1 and P2. 

P1 and P2 were prepared by copolymerization of BDTP-Br11 with BDT or selenophene in 92% and 91% yields, respectively. The monomers and low molecular weight fractions were removed by methanol and hexane using a Soxhlet extractor. Finally, the polymers were extracted with chloroform and precipitated in methanol. The two polymers are soluble in CHCl3, toluene, chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). The structures of P1 and P2 were confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. S1 and S2†) and elemental analysis. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) experiments indicate that the number-average molecular weight (Mn) of P1 and P2 is 49.0 kDa and 62.1 kDa, with the polydispersity index (PDI) of 3.2 and 2.9, respectively. The two polymers show good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) of 339 °C and 431 °C for P1 and P2, respectively (Fig. S3†).
The absorption spectra of P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. 1 and the optical data are listed in Table 1. In solution or as films, the polymers show two absorption peaks in the visible region. For film absorption, the maxima are at 590 nm and 640 nm for P1 and P2, respectively. From solution to film, P2 showed a larger red-shift (26 nm) than that of P1 (12 nm), suggesting that P2 makes better π–π stacking in the solid state. The film absorption onsets of P1 and P2 are at 625 nm and 689 nm, corresponding to optical bandgaps of 1.98 eV and 1.80 eV, respectively. The narrower bandgap of P2 originates from better π-electron delocalization of selenophene.13 Cyclic voltammograms of P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. S4† and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. All potentials were calibrated against the Fc/Fc+ redox couple. The oxidation onset potential (Eonox) of P1 and P2 is 0.73 V and 0.71 V, while the reduction onset potential (Eonred) of P1 and P2 is −2.12 V and −2.00 V, respectively. According to the empirical formulae: HOMO = −(Eonox + 4.8) eV, LUMO = −(Eonred + 4.8) eV,14 the HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 are calculated to be −5.53 and −5.51 eV, while LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 are −2.68 and −2.80 eV, respectively. Compared with P1, P2 has a similar HOMO level but a lower LUMO level. Generally selenophene can lower the LUMO level of D–A copolymers, which correlates with the large volume of selenium atoms.15 The deep HOMO levels of P1 and P2 can lead to a high Voc for solar cells.

Solar cells with a conventional device structure, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al, were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of P1 and P2. After systematic optimization, the best P1:PC71BM solar cell gave a PCE of 3.14%, with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 8.80 mA cm−2, and a FF of 41.1% (Fig. 2, Table 2). It had a D/A ratio of 1:1 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 198 nm, and 1 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) in the mixed solvent (CB:CHCl3 = 2:1), and did not undergo thermal annealing. While P2:PC71BM solar cells, with a D/A ratio of 1:1.2 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 146 nm, and 1 vol% DIO in ODCB, gave the best PCE of 5.08%, with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 8.60 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.4%. The processing solvents were optimized to obtain a better film morphology and better device performance. The DIO additive significantly improved the solar cell performance by reducing the nano-domain size and increasing the D–A interfaces in the active layer.16 The morphology of the blend films without and with DIO was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). After addition of DIO, large PC71BM domains decomposed, more fine nano-structures can be observed, and the phase change is remarkable for the P1:PC71BM blend film (Fig. 3a and b). More D–A interfaces caused by the additive help to enhance Jsc and FF (Table S3†).

Solar cells with an inverted structure, ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag, were studied. After optimization, P1:PC71BM solar cells gave a PCE of 5.05%, with an enhanced Jsc of 10.37 mA cm−2 and a better FF of 54.7%; and P2:PC71BM solar cells gave a PCE of 6.76%, with an enhanced Jsc of 9.96 mA cm−2 and an outstanding FF of 74.5%. From the EQE spectra, the integrated current of P1 and P2 inverted cells are 10.15 mA cm−2 and 9.47 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the corresponding Jsc values from J–V measurements. Compared with the conventional cells, the inverted cells show a remarkable enhancement in EQE, which results from higher transmittance of ZnO and reduced Rs.17 Compared with P1 inverted cells, P2 cells show higher EQE at 615–732 nm but lower EQE at 300–615 nm, leading to slightly lower Jsc. The hole mobilities of P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM blend films were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 4). The hole mobilities of P1 and P2 were 3.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.69 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. P2 possesses higher mobility than P1, which might result from the Se⋯Se interaction18 and better π–π stacking. The higher hole mobility of P2 led to an excellent FF and a higher PCE (Table 2). The XRD patterns of P1 and P2 films show a distinct diffraction peak at 2θ = 24.80° (Fig. S6†), indicating a d-spacing of 3.59 Å for π–π stacking. For the P2 film, a weak peak can be observed at 2θ = 3.63°, which corresponds to an interlayer d-spacing of 24.32 Å. The XRD results suggest that the polymer backbones can stack, but just form relatively small ordered domains. The relatively clear peak at 2θ = 3.63° for the P2 film indicates the better crystallinity of P2, and also explains the higher hole mobility of P2.

Conclusions
In summary, two D–A copolymers P1 and P2 based on a novel lactam acceptor unit BDTP and the BDT or selenophene donor unit have been developed for polymer solar cells. P2 containing the selenophene unit shows broader absorption, narrower bandgap, and higher hole mobility than P1 with the BDT unit. P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM inverted solar cells gave PCEs of 5.05% and 6.76%, respectively. Further application of the BDTP unit in developing highly efficient D–A copolymers is ongoing.
