Solar cells have found use in variety of applications ranging from consumer electronics and small scale distributed power systems to centralized megawatt scale power plants.1 Direct utilization of solar radiation to produce electricity is close to an ideal way to utilize nature's renewable energy. Importantly, the solar panels themselves require very little maintenance and operate without noise and without greenhouse gas emissions.1 Despite the significant development over the past decades, the high cost of solar cells remains a limiting factor for the implementation of the solar electricity on a large scale.2 In contrast to conventional silicon semiconductor solar cells, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a photochemical solar cell, i.e. it uses a liquid electrolyte or other ion-conducting phases as a charge transport medium.2,3 Due to the high efficiencies and good long-term stability reported for the DSSCs, the scientific interest in this technology grew rapidly during the 1990s.2 Beside the high efficiency, DSSCs are economically advantageous compared to conventionally silicon solar cells in having a simple fabrication process and lower production costs.2,4 By successful combination of nanostructured electrodes and efficient dyes, Grätzel and his co-workers developed a solar cell with a solar energy to electric current conversion efficiency exceeding 7% in 1991 and subsequently exceeding 12%.2,5
DSSCs are comprised of a dye-coated semiconductor, usually TiO2, which is packed between two conducting glass plates along with the electrolyte. Electrons in the dye are photo-excited by incident light and are injected into the conduction band of the TiO2.6 The original state of the dye is restored by electron donation from the electrolyte which usually contains a redox system such as the I−/I3− couple.7 The structure of the dye can have a dramatic effect on the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the cell. The lowest energy transition is understood to display metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) which can vary depending on the nature of the ligands attached to the metal centres in the dye. The dye should have a wide range of light absorption wavelengths, ideally absorbing all light below 900 nm, be highly stable, strongly binding to titania and have a sufficiently high redox potential so that it can be rapidly regenerated by electron donation from the electrolyte.8 Different ruthenium dyes have been synthesised by varying the ligands in an attempt to extend the range of wavelengths of light that can be absorbed. However the steric hindrance of the molecule has been seen to have a detrimental effect on the cell performance.9 As the dye molecule gets larger, to improve light absorption, the stability of the dye and its ability to bind efficiently to the titania surface diminishes, resulting in less light effective dye molecules for a given surface area. cis-Dithiocyanato-bis(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine)-ruthenium(II), (cis-RuL2(NCS)2),2, Scheme 1, has been identified as a dye possessing many of the required characteristics for application in DSSC's.8
 Scheme 1 
However, a major problem with the synthesis of the dyes for DSSCs is the use of harmful organic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF). The common protocol for preparing cis-RuL2(NCS)2, as outlined by Nazeeruddin and Grätzel,10 initially involves reacting RuCl3(H2O)3 and 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine (dcbp) in DMF,10 followed by refluxing for three hours at 180 °C, whereupon the mixture is treated with 2 M HCl for four hours.10 The product is combined with KNCS, also in DMF and refluxed at 150 °C for five hours. The DMF, which has a high boiling point, is removed in vacuo, giving the process a significant energy penalty. In addition, the DMF can represent a major waste stream for the process. The use of microwave irradiation in synthesis has gained prominence over the last decade, and has advantages over the use of traditional auotoclave heating. These include improved efficiencies through enhanced rates, rapid heating and quenching of reaction mixtures, minimal temperature gradients within samples, and elimination of wall effects.11–13
Herein we report a new approach for preparing the ruthenium dye cis-RuL2(NCS)2 using microwave irradiation and water as a benign solvent. This eliminates the use of any DMF and dispenses with the need for high temperature refluxing, with shorter reaction times and higher yields.
The new procedure for the synthesis of cis-RuL2(NCS)2 involves initially microwave irradiating a mixture of the Ru(II)-p-cymene complex (49.9 mg) and 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine (dcbpy) (70.6 mg) (as presented in Scheme 1) in a 50/50 solution of HCl/H2O (1.5 mL/1.5 mL) for 60 min at 170 °C, 300 W and 10 bar. This produces the cis-RuL2Cl2 compound as a precipitate which can be collected using vacuum filtration. Combining cis-RuL2Cl2 (82.5 mg) with KNCS (84.7 mg) in H2O (2 mL) followed by microwave irradiation for 30 min, also at 170 °C, 300 W and 10 bar, produces cis-RuL2(NCS)2 also as a precipitate which can be collected in the same way.
The intermediate compound cis-RuL2Cl2 prepared from the Ru(II)-p-cymene complex, was isolated in 85% yield (1H NMR, FTIR, UV-Vis). The synthesis of cis-RuL2(NCS)2 dye from this compound involves metathetical exchange of the chloride ligands with thiocyanate while retaining the cis-arrangement of ligands around the metal centre. The 1H NMR is presented in Fig. 1(A), showing no signals attributable to the presence of the trans-isomer, with 6 peaks in the aromatic region corresponding to two different pyridine ring protons.13,14 The compound was also characterised using FT-IR, UV-Vis, Fig. 1(B) and (C) (the trans-isomer having an absorbance at 580 nm) respectively, and mass spectrometry (see supplementary information).13,15 The FTIR in Fig. 1(C) shows νNCS at 2108 cm−1, the asymmetric bands for CO2− at 1712, 1612 and 1549 cm−1, and a characteristic band for the pyridyl moieties at 1376 cm−1.16

The isolated yield of cis-RuL2(NCS)2 was 64%, and combining with the yield for the first reaction involving Ru(II)-p-cymene gives an overall yield of 54%. In our hands the conventional synthesis gave an overall yield of 34%, although a 73% yield has been reported by Grätzel.10 The use of microwave processing has inherent advantages over the Grätzel method. Exchanging the DMF solvent for aqueous HCl means that low pressure evaporation of the solvent10 is not required, with the product precipitating from solution, which can be readily collected by filtration.
We note that the microwave synthesis can produce the trans-isomer as an impurity, which is not found in the traditional synthesis. However formation of this isomer can be avoided for a reaction temperature of 170 °C or higher under microwave irradiation (see below). The use of microwave processing shows controlled selectivity for the formation of the cis-isomer over the trans-isomer. The trans isomer can be advantageous to the light harvesting ability of the dye as it has extended sensitivity into the infrared region. However, it is unstable and over time it reverts to the cis-stereoisomer anyway.17
The Grätzel method takes three days for synthesis and workup for the same two step reactions in the present study, starting from the Ru(II)-p-cymene complex.10 The new method takes approximately 2–3 h, with no requirement for (i) long refluxing times, (ii) the need for removal of the DMF at low pressure, and (iii) pH controlled precipitation. Thus the synthesis is not only less time consuming but also far less labour intensive. The reaction temperature was seen to affect selectivity of the resulting sample in regard to the isomer composition. A temperature of 150 °C resulted in exclusive formation of the trans-isomer, while elevating the temperature to 160 °C produced both cis- and trans-isomers with the cis-isomer becoming more dominant, and at 170 °C only the cis-isomer is formed.
In conclusion, the use of microwave radiation is effective both in the synthesis of cis-Ru(II)L2Cl2 from the Ru(II)-p-cymene, and its conversion to cis-Ru(II)L2(NCS)2 with retention of stereochemistry. This establishes a new benchmark in the synthesis of this important solar cell dye, as a high yielding and more benign approach. The reaction times have been substantially reduced and the use of DMF, which has high energy usage requirements and toxicity issues, has been avoided. This has potential for the synthesis of other solar dyes, even beyond Ru(II) based complexes. Overall the research has the potential for reducing costs and increasing output of an established field of solar cell technology.
