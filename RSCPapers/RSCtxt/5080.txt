Then, this bioanode was combined with a platinum cathode and a single cell compartment microbial fuel cell (MFC) was formed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has utilized P. fragi as a biocatalyst. After the optimization of the working parameters of P. fragi/graphene–Au/CFE bioanode, like the effect of benzoquinone (BQ) on bioanode performance, BQ concentration optimization, P. fragi bacteria amount and graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial amount optimization, the characteristics of the developed MFC were examined. As a result, 0.169 V OCP, 23.80 μA cm−2 polarization and 0.50 μW cm−2 power density values together with remarkable lifetime (28 days) were obtained.
Introduction
In a brief definition, a biofuel cell (BFC) can be described as a bioelectrochemical device that produces bioelectricity via biochemical conversions.1 In light of this definition, microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a type of BFC that contains bacteria or microorganisms as biological catalysts.2–4 The working principle of MFCs is usually based on the production of extracellular electrons via the oxidation of substrate by microorganisms that are placed in the bioanode. Then, these electrons travel to the cathodic part via an external circuit. As a result, this transport of electrons produces current in the system.1 It is very important to obtain an effective electron transfer rate for the efficacy of the developed MFC. In order to obtain this some aspects like anode materials including bacteria type, design of MFCs, cathode properties, nanomaterial inclusion, usage of mediators must be taken into consideration.4 Following these parameters in this study, we cultivated and used Pseudomonas fragi (P. fragi) as microorganisms and constructed a MFC that includes P. fragi, graphene–gold hybrid nanomaterial (graphene–Au)-modified carbon felt electrode (CFE) bioanode. Then, we combined this bioanode with a platinum (Pt) wire cathode, and as a result, a single compartment MFC was formed. As a type of nanomaterial, graphene has become an attractive nanomaterial because of its high surface area,5 excellent conductivity6 and high mechanical strength.7 It also has economical and practical preparation procedure.8,9 Based on the efficient electron transfer, graphene has been preferred in electrochemical applications including batteries, solar panels and supercapacitors.10 Through these studies, it has been discovered that graphene has the fastest electron mobility and based on that graphene included electrodes are expected to react much faster.9,11 On the other hand, hybrid nanomaterials can be described as nanomaterials that contain more than one nanostructure. Also, the combination of these nanostructures is expected to increase the efficiency of the systems that have these hybrid nanomaterials.12,13 For this reason, we used graphene–Au in this MFC. On the other hand, it has been known that the CFE porous structure enables us to load more biological molecules, here P. fragi, and for this reason, CFE is preferred as an electrode material for these applications.14,15
Moreover, P. fragi is a Gram-negative, psychrophile bacterium responsible for the breakdown of dairy products.16 Unlike other Pseudomonas genus members, they do not produce siderophore.17 According to the 16S rRNA analysis, they belong to the P. chlororaphis group.18 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that includes P. fragi in the MFC structure. In this manner, we believe that our study is important and could extend the vision of MFCs by adding these bacteria to the area. The working parameters of the bioanode were optimized then MFC was formed and the output values were examined.
The main text of the article should appear here with headings as appropriate.
Materials and methods
Reagents and apparatus
A carbon felt was bought from Sigra Cell. Graphite powder (diameter ≤50 μm), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ethylene glycol (EG), gold(III) chloride hydrate (HAuCl4·H2O), benzoquinone(BQ), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. In addition, D-glucose, glycerol and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were purchased from MERCK. Nutrient broth for bacteria was obtained from Thermo Scientific. All the solutions were prepared with double-distilled water.
Electrochemical performances of bioanode were examined using a μ-AUTOLAB Type III electrochemical analysis system and NOVA 1.10 software package. For the electrochemical experiments, an Ag/AgCl electrode, Pt wire and the bioanode were utilized as a reference, counter and working electrodes, successively.
All the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted in pH 7, 100 mM phosphate buffer, from 0.2 V to +1.0 V, 0.005 V step potential unless stated otherwise.
During microorganism cultivation, a BIOSAN ES-20 incubator shaker was used. A Nüve OT 012 autoclave was used for the sterilization of all the materials utilized for microorganisms. A PG instruments T-60 model UV-vis spectrometer was utilized for counting the cultivated microorganisms.
Furthermore, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were performed at HITACHI TM 3030 Plus and JSM-7600 F FEG SEM at 15.0 kV, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR) analyses were performed using a Thermo-Scientific, Nicolet iS10-ATR spectrophotometer, where potassium bromide pellets were preferred for the sample were preparation. Finally, a TGA 4000 thermogravimetric analyzer, PerkinElmer, was used for thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
Synthesis of graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial
Since graphene oxide (GO) was preferred as the first step material for the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial synthesis, first GO was obtained according to the Hummers–Offeman method, where graphite was used as the starting material.19–21 Then, 10 mL of the GO dispersion (1 GO powder mg mL−1 in double-distilled water) was sonicated for 1 h to separate GO layers from each other. Next, 20 mL of the EG solution and 0.5 mL of 0.01 M HAuCl4·H2O salt were put to this GO mixture for initiating the gold nanomaterial formation. Stirring was administered to this GO mixture for 30 min. Then, heat was applied to this solution up to 100 °C for 6 h while it was stirred. In the end, the achieved graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial was separated from the liquid synthesis medium via centrifugation. After that, the solution was rinsed with ultrapure water for five times. The solvent of the final product was evaporated in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h.
Before use in electrode modification, graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial dispersion was prepared in the ratio of 1 mg mL−1 in ultra-pure water via sonication and kept at 4 °C until used.19,21
Microorganism culturation

P. fragi (DSM 3456) was purchased from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, DSMZ, Germany. Lyophilized bacterial cells were inoculated into 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of the nutrient Broth and activated at 26 °C and 165 rpm overnight. For further use, the bacterial glycerol stocks were prepared. For this purpose, each 750 μL of the overnight culture was mixed with 250 μL of sterile 80% (v/v) glycerol solution and stored at −80 °C. The bacterial glycerol stock solution was activated as mentioned before. After cultivation, the biomass was harvested via centrifugation. The supernatant was removed and cellular paste was used in the structure of the bioanode. Before using the bacteria in MFC construction, P. fragi bacterial cells were counted according to UV-vis measurements at 600 nm. When the absorbance value was determined as 2, it means that bacteria counts is average 2 × 108 CFU per mL (1 Abs = 108 cfu per mL).22,23 Since 1.4 × 106 CFU/7 μL bacteria were positioned on the electrode surface, this bacterial count is convenient for making the bioanode.
Assemble of bioanode
The modified CFE was used as a bioanode. CFE was stacked into 2 mm Delrin body hole. For the modification, first of all, 6 μL of the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial (from 10 mg mL−1 dispersion) was dropped on to CFE surface. The solvent of the hybrid nanomaterial was evaporated for 10 min. After that, 7 μL of the P. fragi solution was immobilized on to the electrode surface by dripping. The bioanode was ready to use after the evaporation of the preparation medium of P. fragi.
Construction of a single compartment MFC
The graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial-modified P. fragi based bioanode and Pt wire cathode were used for the building of a single compartment MFC. For this purpose, P. fragi/graphene–Au/CFE bioanode and Pt cathode were dipped in the same electrolyte that included 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 3 mM BQ as a mediator. Besides these, 10 mM glucose solution was utilized as a substrate in the single compartment (Scheme 1).

Output characteristics of the developed MFC
A multimeter was used for measuring the developed P. fragi/graphene–Au/CFE bioanode and Pt cathode based the MFC's current (I) and voltage (V) values. For calculating the cell voltage (Vcell) (Vcell = I × R) and power (P) values, a range of external resistances (R) (from 1 W to 10 MW) were connected to the circuit. Moreover, obtained current and power values were divided by the surface area of the bioanode (A = 0.126 cm2), and as a result, current density (i) (I = I × A − 1) and power density (W) (W = P × A − 1) values were estimated. While measuring the open circuit potential (OCP) values, there was not any current flow in P. fragi/graphene–Au based MFC.
Results and discussion
Graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial characterization
The introduction of nanomaterials into bioelectrochemical systems provides an improvement in these systems' performances. Hence, in this study, graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterials were synthesized and utilized in the bioanode.
For characterizing the obtained hybrid nanomaterial, electron microscopy techniques together with FT-IR and TGA were used.
The SEM image of the as-prepared graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterials is demonstrated in Fig. 1A. The planar single layer structure of graphene that is decorated with Au nanoparticles can be seen from this image (Fig. 1A). From the figure, nonhomogeneous well-dispersed Au nanoparticles are seen as white spots. This nonuniform presentation of the Au nanoparticles on the graphene sheets can be attributed to the non-specific binding between these two nanostructures.24

The SEM image of the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial was supported with the results of the EDS analysis (Fig. 1B). According to the EDS analysis, the atomic dispersion percentages of the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial are 83.97%, 14.97%, 1.06%, and the mass percentages of these elements are 69.23%, 16.44% and 14.32% for C, O and Au, respectively.
For further characterizations of the produced graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial, FT-IR and TGA methods were also utilized (Fig. 1C and D, respectively). The FT-IR spectrum of the GO and graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial shows the CO carbonyl stretching vibrations at around 1700 cm−1, C–OH stretching vibration at around 1200 cm−1, C–O stretching vibration at around 1050 cm−1, CC stretching vibration at around 1600 cm−1, and –OH stretching vibration at around 3300 cm−1.
When the stretching peaks of the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial and graphene oxide are compared, it has been detected that the stretching peaks that belong to the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial decrease by the effective oxygen removal (deoxygenation) of GO by means of EG and Au salts.20 Lastly, TGA results show that the GO and graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial was thermally unstable and start to lose mass upon heating below 100 °C due to the adsorbed water in the structure. At around 200 °C, a clear drop in the mass was determined due to the destruction of CO and CO2 from the GO and graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial, respectively. As a result, during the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial synthesis from graphene oxide, it can be concluded that graphene could not be completely reduced to graphene and some reduced graphene oxide structures had been formed.
Investigation of the glucose oxidation
The catalysis of the glucose oxidation reaction was investigated, as shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen from the LSV measurements which were carried out with plain CFE and graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial-modified CFE that, in the absence of the P. fragi microorganism on the electrode surface, the oxidation peak of glucose was not observed. On the other hand, in the presence of P. fragi microorganism on the electrode surface, the peak was observed as explained in Scheme 1. Moreover, it has also clearly been observed from Fig. 2 that the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial improves the peak current.

Optimization of experimental conditions
The optimization of working parameters about bioanode is very important in terms of increment of this electrode's hence obtained MFC's efficacies. For this purpose, the effect of BQ on the bioanode performance, BQ concentration optimization, P. fragi bacterial amount and graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial amount optimization experiments were carried out via LSV or DPV. On the other hand, the optimum working temperature and optimum pH values were selected as 25 °C and as 7.0 considering the microorganism culture conditions.
The impact of the BQ mediator on the electrochemical performance of the bioanode
As demonstrated in Scheme 1, the reduction of NAD(P) to NADH+ had been followed indirectly for assessing the signal from the developed P. fragi/graphene–Au/CFE bioanode. As it is reported at previous studies, redox mediators including quinones have been coupled to NAD(P) in the enzymatic reactions.25 For this reason, BQ was tried as a mediator. In this system, the BQ mediator serves as an electron shuttle between the enzyme active center and the working electrode surface. The reduced or oxidized BQ mediator has to be reversibly rejuvenated on the electrode surface.26
As a result, for investigating the influence of BQ on the response of the bioanode, P. fragi/graphene–Au/CFE bioanode performance was observed in terms of LSV in the presence and absence of the 3 mM BQ mediator, in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) that contains 10 mM glucose (Fig. 3A). The introduction of BQ in the system enhances the current value almost 3-fold compared to the current value that was observed without BQ in the medium (Fig. 3A).

(B) DPV results belong to the optimization of the BQ mediator amount in increasing concentrations from 0 mM to 7 mM. Inset: The optimization curve of BQ amount. 
According to these facts and experiment results, it can be concluded that the BQ usage in this system would be beneficial since BQ improves the current value by enhancing the electron transfer kinetics between the enzyme active site and the electrode surface.
For determining the optimum concentration of BQ, 1 mM, 3 mM, 5 mM and 7 mM BQ solutions were introduced into the above-mentioned medium, and electrochemical signals that were produced by the P. fragi/graphene–Au/CFE bioanode were observed. As a result, the best current value was observed with 3 mM BQ (Fig. 3B).
The effect of the P. fragi bacterial amount and graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial amount on bioanode performance
For the developed MFC, the GDH enzyme on the P. fragi bacterial surface has a key role in the bioanode reaction. Therefore, the enzyme amount, hence the amount of P. fragi bacteria, is important to get the best results. For this purpose, 1 μL to 10 μL of P. fragi bacteria were introduced onto the electrode surface and the effects of the P. fragi bacterial amount were investigated with DPV in the above-mentioned medium. It can be seen from Fig. 4A and B that the highest current value was obtained with 7 μL of P. fragi. At higher amount of P. fragi, a decrease in the peak current was observed, which can be explained as the deposition of the bacteria on the electrode surface might have blocked the enzyme active sites.27

(D) The optimization graph curve for the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial amount. 
In bioelectrochemical systems, nanomaterials increase conductivity, hence increasing the electrochemical transfer and providing a higher surface area for the immobilization of more biological substances, which results with the increment in the peak current. In this system, the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial was used to improve the signals that were obtained from the bioanode. From this point of view, it is also important to examine the amount of AuNPs on the graphene structure. The electrocatalytic effect of AuNPs has been known for some time.28 Based on the AuNP amount, electron transfer rate increases up to some point. Furthermore, a decrease has been obtained based on the irregular accumulation and intense presentation of these nanomaterials.28 In our case, we obtained the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial by reducing gold onto the graphene structure via a water–EG system.20 In these systems, it has been reported that metallic salts destroy the graphene structure during the formation of the nanocomposite material.20 In order to prevent the disintegration that could happen at higher degrees, we prefer to stick to a previously established method developed by Xu et al. As a result, we used the same amount of HAuCl4 0.01 M that was recommended in that procedure.20 On the other hand, the as-prepared graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial amount effects have been determined. For this purpose, the P. fragi/graphene–Au/CFE bioanode was prepared that includes different amounts of graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterials such as 2 μL, 4 μL, 6 μL, 8 μL and 10 μL (10 mg mL−1, in distilled water), and DPVs were recorded corresponded to those amounts. According to Fig. 4C and D, the highest current value was obtained for 6 μL of the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial. The use of nanomaterials in a system increases the electrode surface area hence increases the active enzyme amount in a bioanode. On the other hand, the decrease at the peak current for 8 μL and 10 μL of the graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial, might be attributed to the accumulation of these nanomaterials on the electrode surface that might make the reachment of the enzyme active sites difficult.29
Determination of the polarization and power density values of constructed single compartment BFC
By combining the experimentally optimized bioanode with a Pt cathode, a single compartment MFC was constructed in the presence and absence of the BQ mediator. Polarization and power density measurements were carried out using a multimeter for the determination of developed MFC's performance (Fig. 5A and B). As a result, 0.169 V OCP, 23.80 μA cm−2 polarization and 0.50 μW cm−2 power density values were obtained for the P. fragi/graphene–Au/CFE bioanode-based single compartment MFC in the presence of BQ. In addition, 0. 179 OCP, 7.14 μA cm−2 polarization and 0.27 μW cm−2 power density values were obtained in the absence of BQ mediator. This results support that BQ mediator improves the MFC performance similar as it was observed for the bioanode before.

(C) Lifetime curve of constructed single compartment BFC (between times stored at 4 °C). 
The storage stability and lifetime of constructed single compartment MFC were also tested. The power output of the 100.00% (wt%) of the P. fragi-based MFC diminished gradually by 97.79% within 24 h of process and was consumed upon the trial of over a lengthened 28 days period (between times stored at 4 °C) (Fig. 5C).
We also compared our biofuel cell with similar studies (Table 1). It can be seen from Table 1 that without adding any extra cofactor, P. fragi based MFC power density values and lifetime are in acceptable limits.

Conclusion
A P. fragi/graphene–Au/CFE bioanode was prepared, optimized and combined with a Pt wire cathode to form a single compartment MFC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MFC that includes P. fragi as a biocatalyst. The output of developed MFC is comparable with similar systems. Also, it has a remarkable lifetime (for about 28 days), which demonstrates another efficacy of the developed system. Being a single cell also gives the P. fragi/graphene–Au/CFE bioanode-based MFC practicality and also decreases the cost. As a result, we believe that using the P. fragi with graphene–Au hybrid nanomaterial and BQ, we managed to produce a practical, economical and durable MFC system.
