    , Accepted 18th November 2014First published on 20th November 2014AbstractThe upconversion luminescence (UCL) of rare earth (RE) ions doped nanomaterials has attracted extensive interest because of its wide and great potential applications. However, the lower UCL efficiency is still an obstacle for real applications. Photonic modulation is a novel way to improve the efficiency of UCL. In this work, NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Tm3+ inverse opal photonic crystals (IOPCs) were fabricated through the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) template and the modification of the IOPC structure on the emission spectra and dynamics of Tm3+ ions was systemically studied. It is interesting to observe that in the IOPCs, the high-order UCL 1D2–3H6/3F4 was relatively enhanced. At the same time, the local thermal effect induced by laser irradiation was suppressed. Furthermore, the overall intensity ratio of visible UCL to near-infrared (NIR) down-conversion luminescence (DCL) was 2.8–8 times improved than that of the grinded reference (REF) and independent of the photonic stop band (PSB). The studies on UCL dynamics indicated that the nonradiative transition rate of Tm3+ was considerably suppressed. The facts above indicated that in the IOPCs the UCL efficiency of Tm3+ was largely improved due to the periodic macroporous structure.
1. Introduction
Rare-earth (RE) doped upconversion (UC) phosphors have attracted extensive attention due to their excellent advantages, including their unique photoluminescent features and a large number of potential applications such as background lighting sources, solid state lasers, infrared detection, bio-labels, and biosensors.1–5 Because the unique 4f–4f transitions are shielded by the outer orbitals, UC materials offer high photochemical stability, sharp emission bandwidths, and large anti-Stokes shifts up to 500 nm, in situ up-converted near infrared (NIR) excitation light to visible and UV regions.6,7 Among the UC phosphors, Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ co-activated fluorides (such as the NaYF4 family) have been paid more attention.8–11 Er3+ or Tm3+ offers some ideal intermediate states for two-step or multi-step UC population channels under the pump of 980 nm light, whereas Yb3+ has a relatively strong absorption around 980 nm. The fluoride host matrix has a relatively low phonon energy, which can suppress the quenching effect of the excited state of the lanthanide ions and consequently improve the efficiencies of their emission from the excited levels.12 It should be highlighted that some recent studies indicate that in some oxide compounds with relatively large phonon thresholds, Er3+/Yb3+ or Tm3+/Yb3+ co-activated phosphors also demonstrate intense UC emissions.13 Actually, in UC phosphors, the existence of large phonons may also offer some novel population channels and may sometimes favor UCL.
Our previous work has demonstrated that NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Er3+ powders have very strong upconversion emissions due to their outstanding inherent features (its intensity was about one of half of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ commercial powders). On the one hand, the NaGd(WO4)2 matrix has the more intense absorption/emission cross section of Yb3+ at around 980 nm in contrast to the other fluorides and oxides phosphors.14 On the other hand, the highly improved UCL in NaGd(WO4)2 is related to the modulation of photon energy as well as crystal symmetry on the processes of UC populating and emitting.15
The microstructure of the host material is another key factor, which influences the photoluminescence of the doping ions.16,17 Since the pioneering works by Yablonovitch and John in 1987, the dimensional periodicity materials, known as photonic crystals, have attracted considerable attention.18,19 The periodic electromagnetic modulation created by the PCs can yield a PSB, a band of frequencies for which light propagation in the PCs is forbidden, and thus drastically alter the optical properties.20 Because of their ability to confine, control, and manipulate photons, PSB materials have demonstrated a wide variety of applications, for example, in miniature lasers, light-emitting diodes, biomarkers, and enhancing light harvesting efficiency of dye sensitized solar cells.21–26 Among these applications, one which has such interesting physical issue is the modification of the spontaneous emission. Up to now, a number of works have been performed in the field, and some interesting phenomena have been observed such as the observation of the Lamb shift, inhibited long-scale energy transfer (ET) and local thermal effect, and improvement of the luminescent quantum yield in RE ions embedded IOPCs.27–31 Despite this, the work related to the modification of PCs on the UCL of embedded RE ions is still rare and further work should be performed to fabricate more UC IOPCs and deeply understand its unique physical nature.
In this study, Tm3+ and Yb3+ co-doped NaGd(WO4)2 IOPCs were prepared using the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) template method. In order to completely understand the modulation effect of IOPCs on the emissions of NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Er3+, the emission lines and dynamics of different transitions for Tm3+ ions were systemically studied in contrast to grinded REF samples. It is interesting to observe that in the IOPCs the intensity ratio of visible UCL to the NIR down conversion luminescence (DCL) was highly improved compared to that in the REF sample. Furthermore, the high order upconversion emission lines (1D2–3H6/3F4) were remarkably enhanced in the IOPC samples, implying that the IOPC is a very helpful microstructure for UCL.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Sample preparation
All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification. All the lanthanide nitrates were purchased from the National Engineering Research Centre of Rare Earth Metallurgy and Function Materials. Sodium nitrate, ammonium metatungstate, methyl methacrylate (MMA), ethanol, and citric acid were received from Beijing Chemical Plant (Beijing, P. R. China).
IOPCs, NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Tm3+, with the different PSBs and doping concentrations, were prepared by the sol–gel method with the PMMA latex sphere template technique.32,33 Firstly, monodisperse PMMA latex spheres with controllable sizes (∼315, 340, 390, 410 and 425 nm) were synthesized. Then, a thin-film template was self-assembled through the vertical deposition process. The colloid suspension (5% solid content) of PMMA microspheres was dropped onto a glass substrate and placed in a 30 °C oven for 2 days. The PMMA colloidal spheres were slowly self-organized into highly ordered colloidal arrays on the glass substrate, driven by the surface tension of the liquid in the evaporating process. Following deposition, the opals were sintered for 40 min at 120 °C to enhance their physical strength. In the preparation of the NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Tm3+ precursor sol, 0.195 mmol ammonium metatungstate, 1.165 mmol sodium nitrate and stoichiometric amounts of Gd(NO3)3·6H2O, Yb(NO3)3·6H2O, and Tm(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in a 5 ml mixture solution of deionized water and ethanol (volume ratio of 1:1). The mixed solution contained 500 mg citric acid and was used as the chelating agent. After stirring for 30 minutes, the prepared precursor solutions were used to infiltrate the voids of the opal template through capillary force. After infiltration, the resulting products were dried in air at room temperature for one day. A thermal treatment consists of a slow rising time of 450 min from room temperature to 600 °C and keeping at 600 °C for 3 hours. Samples prepared by the opal templates were constructed with PMMA microspheres of 315, 340, 390, 410 and 425 nm in diameter and were denoted as samples IOPC1 to IOPC5 respectively. For comparison, a corresponding reference sample (REF) was prepared by grinding the IOPC sample to destroy the regular 3D order structure.
2.2. Measurements
The morphology of the samples was measured with a JEOL JSM-7500 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The phase structure of the samples were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer using a monochromatized Cu target radiation resource (λ = 1.54 Å). The transmittance spectra were taken with a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. In the measurements of the UCL and infrared emission spectra, a continuous 980 nm wavelength was used to pump the samples. A visible photomultiplier (300–850 nm) and an infrared InAsGa detector (800–2200 nm) combined with a double-grating monochromator were used for spectral collection in the range of 400–2200 nm. In the measurement of luminescent dynamics, the samples were pumped by a laser-system consisting of a Nd:YAG pumping laser (1064 nm), a third-order Harmonic-Generator (355 nm), and a tunable optical parameter oscillator (OPO, Continuum Precision II 8000) with the pulse duration of 10 ns, repetition frequency of 10 Hz, and line width of 4–7 cm−1. The low-temperature emission spectra and dynamics were measured by placing the samples into a helium–gas cycling system, where the temperature was varied from 10 to 400 K.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and band gap characterization
The IOPC samples on the glass substrates (20 mm × 15 mm) can be tuned from blue to red, when observed in a vertical direction. As the direction of observation was changed, the color also gradually varied, indicating the formation of well-ordered IOPCs. The SEM and TEM images of the IOPCs were analyzed to determine the local structure and quality of the samples (Fig. 1 for IOPC3). Fig. 1(a)–(c) show the SEM images of the PMMA opal template, the magnified image and the side-view of the IOPC sample, respectively. Fig. 1a shows that a long range PMMA opal is formed, and the average diameter of the PMMA spheres is 390 nm. Fig. 1(b) displays the top-view SEM image of the IOPC sample with a center-to-center distance of 300 nm, which is about 30% smaller than the original size of the PMMA template due to the shrinkage of spheres’ diameters during calcination. It demonstrates a high degree of ordered-inverse-opal structure, following the preferred growth direction along the (111) faces of the face-centered-cubic (FCC) arrays. From the side-view image of Fig. 1(c), it displays a multilayer macroporous structure with 50–60 layers. Fig. 1(d) shows the TEM image of the IOPC sample, which indicates that the IOPCs have a regular hexagonal structure, consisting of a NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Tm3+ wall and air cavity. Note that except for the center-to-center distances, the samples IOPC1, IOPC2, IOPC4, and IOPC5 are similar to IOPC3.

Fig. 2 shows the optical transmittance spectra of the IOPC samples when the incidence is vertical to the (111) plane. Their corresponding PMMA templates show PSBs with dips of ∼25%–30% (Fig. S1†) and with the central wavelength of 740, 795, 920, 960 and 1000 nm. The IOPCs display PSBs with dips of ∼3%–5% and the central wavelength of 480, 530, 600, 630 and 660 nm. Every sample exhibits an expansion width of ∼100 nm (The decrease in the amplitude of the PSB in the IOPC samples can be attributed to the involvement of structure defects during annealing). All of the opal PCs (OPCs) and IOPCs samples present beautiful structural colors under normal indoor illumination. Due to a lower average refractive index caused by air spheres instead of polymer spheres and shrinkage of the spheres’ diameter during calcination, the PSBs of the IOPCs shift to the short wavelength side evidently, compared with the PSBs of the OPC templates. The inset of Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the location of the PSBs on the lattice constants of the NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Tm3+ IOPCs. Evidently, the location of the PSB demonstrates a linear relationship with the lattice constant and the linear slope is determined to be 1.885. Theoretically, the normal positions of the PSBs in face-centered-cubic (FCC) PCs can be estimated by Bragg's law of diffraction combined with Snell's law as follows (eqn (1)),34 (1.1) neff = xnNaGd(WO4)2 + (1 − x)nair(1.2)where, λ is the central wavelength of the PSB, m is the order of the Bragg diffraction, dhkl is the hkl plane distance, neff is the average refractive index, nNaGd(WO4)2 is the refractive index of NaGd(WO4)2 (∼1.96),35nair is the refractive index of air, x is the filling factor, θ is the angle from the incident light to the normal of the substrate surface (θ = 0°), and D is the center-to-center distances of the neighboring hollow spheres. Based on the linear slope (1.885) in the inset of Fig. 2 and eqn (1.1), the practical neff is determined to be 1.15. Furthermore, according to eqn (1.2), air takes about 84% (x = 0.16) of the space in the IOPC samples, which is less than the ideal condition (x = 0.26). This is reasonable if the shrinkage process of the lattice constants is taken into account.

The tetragonal phase NaGd(WO4)2 has the space group I41/a with the unit cell parameters a = 5.2440 Å and c = 11.3794 Å. The RE ions occupy both the sites 2b and 2d with the S4 symmetry for NaGd(WO4)2.36 The crystalline structure of the doped NaGd(WO4)2 samples was characterized by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. As shown in Fig. 3, most of the patterns can be well-indexed as the pure tetragonal-phase (JCPDS 25-0829). Fig. 3(a)–3(b) show the XRD patterns of the IOPC samples and reference samples fabricated at different Yb3+ doping concentrations, respectively. According to the JCPDS standard cards, all of the samples exist the pure phase structure, namely, tetragonal for NaGd(WO4)2. However, Fig. 3(c) shows a little difference among all the XRD patterns. Compared with the corresponding standard cards, as the doping Yb3+ concentration increase from 5% to 40% for NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/0.5%Tm3+, the main peaks shift a little to a higher degree due to the fact that the ionic radius of the replaced Gd3+ (0.938 Å) is larger than the ionic radius of Yb3+ (0.858 Å). From the analysis of the XRD patterns, it can also be concluded that the Yb3+ ions have been effectively doped into the NaGd(WO4)2 host lattices.

3.2. Concentration-dependent UCL of Tm3+ ions
The UCL properties of the doped UCPs depend strongly on the concentration of the doping ions of the activator and the sensitizer. In order to reveal the concentration-dependent UCL properties and obtain the optimum concentration of doping ions in the NaGd(WO4)2 host lattices, the Tm3+ and Yb3+ concentration-dependent UCL spectra of NaGd(WO4)2 samples are shown in Fig. 4(a)–4(f). As shown in Fig. 4a, there are two UC emission lines, located at 368 nm and 456 nm, which are assigned to the 1D2–3H6 and 1D2–3F4 transitions, respectively. The dominant emission line centers at 480 nm are assigned to the transitions of 1G4–3H6. Moreover, there are another two UC emission lines peaking at 652 and 800 nm, which come from the 1G4–3F4 and 3H4–3H6 transitions, respectively. From Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), the intensity ratio of the 1D2–3H6 + 3F4 to the strongest 1G4–3H6 transition varies greatly with doping concentration of the Tm3+ and Yb3+ ions. As the Yb3+ concentration is fixed at 20% (Fig. 4(a) and 4(b)) and Tm3+ concentration increases from 0.2% to 2% in molar ratio, the ratio of 1D2–3H6 + 3F4 to 1G4–3H6 gradually increases. A similar result was also observed by C. Jacinto et al.,37 and this phenomenon can be attributed to the improved cross relaxation process of 1G4 + 3H4→3F4 + 1D2 between nearby Tm3+ ions. Fig. 4(c) and 4(d) demonstrate that the UCL intensity of the multiple emissions can be tuned by controlling the Yb3+ concentration. It can be seen that when the Yb3+ ions concentration changes from 5% to 40%, the UCL emissions vary quickly, but the relative emission intensity ratio between the different UC emissions changes slightly. This typical experimental result is due to the efficient Yb3+ to Tm3+ ET processes. The UCL integral emission intensity plotted with different doping concentrations of Tm3+ and Yb3+ ions are shown in Fig. 4(e) and 4(f). Evidently, with the increase of the Tm3+ and Yb3+ ion concentration, the luminescent intensities of UCL in the REF and IOPC samples both increase at the beginning and approach a maximum at 0.5% Tm3+ concentration or 20% Yb3+ concentration and then decrease. However, in the IOPC samples, the UCL intensity decreases more slowly when the Tm3+ or Yb3+ concentration further increases. This suggests that in the IOPCs the concentration quenching effect was considerably suppressed. Similar results were also observed in the IOPC samples such as YVO4:Eu3+ and LaPO4:Ce3+/Tb3+.38,39 It is suggested that in the IOPCs because the IOPC layers consist of small nanoparticles with sizes of 10–20 nm, the long scale ET among the RE ions are suppressed due to the boundary effect. As is well known, the concentration effect originates from the ET from luminescent centers to defect states. In the IOPCs, this ET path is also blocked, leading to the suppressed concentration quenching.40 Based on the results mentioned above, the optimal concentrations for the IOPC and REF samples are both 20% Yb3+ and 0.5% Tm3+.

3.3. Improved intensity ratio of UCL to DCL
In order to better understand the UC processes of Yb3+, Tm3+-copded phosphors, Fig. 5 shows the possible upconversion population processes of the Yb3+, Tm3+ co-doped samples under 980 nm excitation, which is similar to our previously reported model to explain the concentration-controlled emission in LaF3:Yb3+/Tm3+ nanocrystals.40 Simply to say, the population of 3F2,3 and 3H4 comes from a two-step ET process, the population of 1G4 is from a three-step ET process, and the population of 1D2 is from a four-step ET process, as shown on the left side of Fig. 5. Moreover, some cross relaxation channels may also have great contribution to the UC population, paticularly in the case of heavy doping of Tm3+ and Yb3+ ions, as shown on the right side of Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  The energy-level diagram of Yb3+, Tm3+ co-doped crystalline and population processes under 980 nm excitation. 
In the IOPC and REF samples, the relative intensity of UCL for any transition changes largely. Fig. 6(a) displays a comparison of the normalized UCL spectra between the IOPCs and the REFs under the same conditions. It is interesting to observe that in the IOPC sample the emission from the 1D2 state (four-photon population) increases remarkably compared to the REF sample, whereas that from the 3H4 and 3F2,3 states (two-photon population) decrease evidently. This suggests that the IOPC structure is helpful for high-order UCL to occur. This could be explained by the effective suppression of temperature quenching and local thermal effect due to the thin layer structure and connected air cavity in the IOPCs. The typical feature may be significant for suppressing the non-radiation and enhancing effective UCL in oxide materials. It should be also noted that under the excitation of the 980 nm light with the same power density, the IOPC sample has a lower temperature increase, which can be deduced from the smaller intensity ratio of 2H11/2–4I15/2 to 4S3/2–4I15/2 for Er3+ and Yb3+ co-doped samples (Fig. S2†). This indicates that the IOPC structure can suppress the local thermal effect induced by laser irradiation, which is attributed to its better thermal diffusion property due to the empty cavity structure.29 This means that the phonon density of the IOPCs will decrease compared to the grinded REF. Furthermore, the corresponding integral intensity of the different transition states are listed in Fig. 6(b) and it is clear to observe the different populations in the IOPC and REF samples.
 Fig. 6  (a) The typical UCL spectra of the IOPC and REF samples with the doping concentration of 20% Yb3+/0.5% Tm3+. (b) The histograms of the integral UCL intensity with the different emission lines. 
Under the excitation of the 980 nm laser diode, the excited energy of Yb3+ can actually be transferred into three parts, the UCL in the ultraviolet and visible range, DCL in the NIR region and the thermal energy of the host lattices. According to the results of Fig. S2,† in the IOPCs the thermal energy transferred to the host lattices should decrease in comparison to the REF samples. In general, the DCL and UCL is a competitive relationship, which depends strongly on the crystal structure, phonon energy of the host material and the doping concentration of Yb3+ and Tm3+. To further reveal the competition of DCL and UCL of NaGd(WO4)2: Yb3+/Tm3+ in the IOPC and REF samples, the entire emission spectra expanding the visible to NIR region of the NaGd(WO4)2 samples with different doping concentrations of Yb3+ and Tm3+ are shown in Fig. 7. It is clearly observed that the intensity ratios of the UCL intensity to the total emission intensity (UCL + DCL) in the IOPCs increase evidently in contrast to that in the REF samples (Fig. 7(a) and 7(b)), indicating that the IOPCs structure is a very useful device. In the NIR region (1100–1700 nm), several intense emissions are observed, corresponding to the DC transitions of 3H5–3H6 (∼1215 nm), 3H4–3F4 (∼1467 nm) and 3F4–3H6 (∼1605 nm). From Fig. 7(a), it can be observed that in the IOPCs the emission intensity of 3H4–3F4 increases with the increasing Tm3+/Yb3+ concentration, whereas on the contrary the transition of 3F4–3H6 decreases. This can be attributed to the occurrence of the cross relaxation process of 3H4 + 3H6→3H5 + 3F4. It should also be noted that for the IOPCs the transition of 3H4–3F4 is the strongest in the NIR region, whereas for the REF samples the 3F4–3H6 transition is dominant (Fig. 7(b)). It is suggested that in the REFs samples the nonradiative relaxation processes of 3H4–3H5 and 3H5–3F4 increase compared to those in the IOPCs, leading to the intensity suppression of 3H4–3F4 and the increase of 3F4–3H6. The gradually improved emission lines of 3H5–3H6 in the REF samples verify further the improved nonradiative relaxation of 3H4–3H5. It should be noted that the suppression of nonradiative relaxation was also observed in other IOPC samples such as Lu2O3:Eu3+.41 The UCL + DCL emission spectra with different PSBs were also measured, as shown in Fig. S3.† It can be evidently observed that the blue UCL emission 1G4–3H6 line in IOPC1 is significantly suppressed in contrast to other IOPC samples. The inhibition of light emission near the centre of the PSB is a traditional phenomenon for luminescent species embedded in PCs.28,29 It is noteworthy that in the IOPCs the intensity ratio of UCL to DCL is almost independent of the PSB, and moreover, the emission lines of the 1D2 state (1D2–3H6, 3F4) barely change with the PSB. This shows that in the IOPC samples the improvement of the total UCL in the IOPCs as well as the high-order UCL are independent of the PSBs. It is the ordered macroporous structure which suppresses the non-radiative process and strengthens the UCL.

(c) The ratio of the UCL to the UCL + DCL with the different Tm3+ and Yb3+ concentration in the IOPCs and REFs. (d) The power-dependent ratio of the UCL to the UCL + DCL for NaGd(WO4)2:20%Yb3+, 1%Tm3+ in the IOPC and REF samples. 
To view the enhanced UCL visually, the ratio of the UCL to the UCL + DCL in the IOPCs and REFs are shown in Fig. 7(c). It is clear that for both the IOPC and REF samples, the ratio of UCL increases with the doping concentration of Yb3+, as the concentration of Tm3+ is fixed at 0.5%. This is ascribed to the more effective ET from Yb3+ to Tm3+ due to the decreased ionic distance between Yb3+ and Tm3+. On the contrary, the ratio of UCL rapidly decreases with the increased concentration of Tm3+ as the concentration of Yb3+ is fixed at 20%, which can be attributed to the improved cross relaxation process among Tm3+ ions. It should be highlighted that in the IOPC samples the ratio of UCL is considerably higher than that of the corresponding REFs. In the IOPCs the ratio of UCL varies from 38% to 66%, whereas in the REFs it changes only from 5% to 22%. Considering the decreased thermal effect in the IOPCs samples, the highly improved ratio of UCL to UCL + DCL indicates that the UCL efficiency in the IOPCs is largely improved over the REF samples, and the IOPC is a very excellent microstructure for UCL. The power-dependent ratios of the UCL to the UCL + DCL in the IOPC and REF samples are displayed in Fig. 7(d). It can be seen that in the IOPC, the UCL proportion increases steadily with the enhanced exciting power. However, in the REF, the ratio of UCL reaches the maximum with the power of 226 mW and then decreases. This is another evidence to show that the IOPC structure can inhibit the local thermal effect and thus enhance the UCL.
It should be highlighted that the inner quantum efficiency of the grinded REF of NaGd(WO4)2:20%Yb3+/0.5%Tm3+ powder was determined to be 2.2% under the excitation of ∼1 W mm−2 980 nm laser by the optics integrating sphere. However, for the corresponding IOPC sample the inner quantum efficiency was hard to measure because of its thinner layer thickness. Estimated from the ratio of UCL to UCL + DCL, the inner quantum efficiency of the corresponding IOPC sample should be more than 6.6% (The ratio of UCL to UCL + DCL for the IOPC sample is about 66%, whereas that for the REF sample is about 22%).
For any mechanism, the visible output intensity (IV) is proportional to some power (n) of the infrared excitation (IIR) power: IV ∝ InIR, where the value of n presents the number of IR photons absorbed per visible photon emitted. However, the saturation effect will induce n to deviate from the required photon number, depending on the competition between linear decay and UC processes for the depletion of the intermediate excited states.42 The power-dependence of UCL in the NaGd(WO4)2:20%Yb3+/0.5%Tm3+ IOPC and REF samples are shown in Fig. 8. Here, the emission intensity from the excited states of 1D2–3H6, 1D2–3F4, 1G4–3H6 and 3H4–3H6 was plotted as a function of excitation power. It is observed that the slopes in the REF samples are lower than the IOPC samples, and they decrease with the increase of the pump power rapidly compared to the IOPC samples. It can be mainly attributed to the improved saturation effect and local thermal effect induced by laser exposure.43

3.4. UCL dynamics
The electron transition processes could be further revealed by the luminescent dynamics of the excited states (3H4, 1G4 and 1D2). The temporal evolution of the UCL for the entire excited states exhibits the same behavior in the PC and REF samples, as shown in Fig. 9. The luminescence intensity rises quickly at the beginning until it reaches a maximum and then decays following a non-exponential process due to the ET and cross-relaxation process. The curves can be well fitted by the following luminescent dynamical equation,44 It = I1e−τdecayt − I2e−τriset(2)where τdecay and τrise represent the decay and rising rate constants, respectively, and I1 and I2 are both the positive intensity constants. τrise depends strongly on the ET rate from Yb3+ to Tm3+ and the decay time constant of Yb3+.

In Fig. 9, at a fixed concentration of NaGd(WO4)2:20%Yb3+/0.5%Tm3+, τrise is similar in the IOPC sample with the different transition state of 3H4, 1G4 and 1D2. According to the population mechanism as discussed above, the population of the 1G4 state can be dominated by the UC excitation process from the 3H4 state or the cross-relaxation process 1G4 + 3H4→3F4 + 1D2. The former process could induce the similar rise for the 1D2, 1G4 and 3H4 states. The result above suggests that the multi-step ET is a dominant mechanism for populating each energy state. We also found that the 3H4 and 1G4 states have a relatively longer τdecay compared to the 1D2 state in the IOPC and REF samples. As is well known, τdecay of one luminescent state is reciprocal to the radiative transition rates plus multi-phonon nonradiative relaxation rates. Because of the large energy gaps from 1D2, 1G4 and 3H4 to their nearest down states, the multi-phonon relaxation processes from these states hardly occur; therefore, we suggest that the states of 1G4 and 3H4 have smaller radiative transition rates compared to the other excited levels, which have been proven previously by the J–O theory.45 The typical prolonged τdecay of the 1G4–3H6 transitions monitored at 480 nm in the NaGd(WO4)2 IOPC sample was determined to be 119 μs, whereas that of the REF was 80 μs. In the NaGd(WO4)2 IOPC, the lifetime of 1G4–3H6 for Tm3+ was prolonged ∼50% in comparison to that of the REF. The modification of the effective refractive index on radiative rate in the IOPCs leads to the large variation of the lifetime.46
Moreover, the time constants of rise (τrise) and decay (τdecay) for the transition of 1G4–3H6 in the IOPC and REF samples with the different Yb3+ and Tm3+ doping concentrations are calculated and listed in Table 1 (the non-exponential decay dynamics processes are shown in Fig. S4 and S5†). It can be observed that τrise and τdecay in all of the IOPC and REF samples decrease rapidly when the Tm3+ ion and Yb3+ concentration increases. As the Yb3+ or Tm3+ concentration increases, on the one hand, the decreased average interaction distance leads to more effective ET from Yb3+ to Tm3+, resulting in a shorter τrise. On the other hand, the populations of Tm3+ on the 1G4 and the others excited states increase largely, inducing the easier occurrence of cross ET for Tm3+, which results in the shortened τdecay.

Fig. 10 shows the reciprocal of the fluorescence lifetime of Tm3+versus Tm3+ concentration in the IOPC and REF samples. It can be seen that the reciprocal of the fluorescence lifetime increased linearly with the increase in Tm3+ concentration. Therefore, the experimental points were fitted with the following function. τ−1 ∝ Rc + RET [Tm3+](3)where Rc is the total electronic transition rate of Tm3+, including the radiative and nonradiative transitions, RET is the average ET rate among Tm3+ ions, and [Tm3+] is the concentration of Tm3+. By fitting, Rc was deduced to be 4.89 ms−1 in the IOPCs and 8.37 ms−1 in the REFs. RET was deduced to be 6.7 ms−1 mol−1 in the IOPCs and 6.46 ms−1 mol−1 in the REFs. This further indicates that in the REF and IOPC samples the cross ET rate of Tm3+ on the 1G4 rarely changes, whereas the electronic transition rate of Tm3+ on 1G4 in the IOPC samples decreases largely, which can be attributed to the modulation of the effective index on the radiative transition rate from 1G4 and the evident decrease of the nonradiative transition rate in the IOPC samples, which can be proven by the temperature-dependent luminescent dynamics (see text, section 3.5).

3.5. Temperature-dependent emission spectra and dynamics
To further reveal the temperature quenching of the emission intensity, the UCL emission intensity of Tm3+ ions under 980 nm excitation as a function of temperature in the IOPCs and REF are displayed in Fig. 11. It can be seen that, following the increase of temperature (above 50 K), a rapid decrease of UCL intensity in the REF was observed, whereas the UCL changed slowly with the elevated temperature in the IOPCs. This indicates that the temperature-quenching of Tm3+ UCL can be suppressed considerably in the IOPCs. It is suggested that in traditional phosphors the quenching of UCL occurs due to the energy transfer (ET) from luminescent centers to defect states, which is randomly distributed in the lattices of the phosphors. This process is strongly dependent on temperature. In the IOPCs, the significant ET should be restrained largely because of thin thickness of each NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Tm3+ layer and the existence of long periodic and connected air cavities between the two layers. In this case, the ET among the Tm3+ and defect states can occur only within one NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Tm3+ layer and then the emitted photons are scattered into the air cavities rather than largely captured by the defect states through further long-range ET. To further reveal the analysis mentioned above, the UCL dynamics of the 1G4–3H6 transition in the IOPCs and REF samples as a function of temperature are shown in the inset of Fig. 11. Based on the multi-phonon-relaxation theory, the total spontaneous decay rate (SDR) for 1G4 (WTotal) can be written as follows: WTotal = WR + WET + WNR (0) (1 − e−ħω/kT)−ΔE/ħω(4)where, WR is the radiative transition rate of 1G4–3H6, WET the ET rate, including cross relaxation from 1G4 of Tm3+ and ET from 1G4 of Tm3+ to Yb3+, and WNR(0) the nonradiative relaxation rate from 1G4 at 0 K. By fitting, we deduced that in the IOPCs, WR + WET = 8.86 ms−1, WNR(0) = 0.30 ms−1, whereas in the REF samples, WR + WET = 9.27 ms−1, WNR(0) = 1.12 ms−1. It is evident that in the IOPCs, WNR(0) is considerably inhabited in contrast to the REF samples. This further implies that in the IOPCs, the temperature quenching was considerably restrained.

4. Conclusion
In summary, 3D NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Tm3+ IOPCs were prepared by the self-assembly method using PMMA as the template. The modification of the PC effect on the emission spectra and dynamics of Tm3+ ions was systemically studied. First, it is significant to observe that, in the IOPCs samples the ratio of UCL to UCL + DCL increases largely (2.8–8 times) compared to the corresponding REF samples. In the optimum sample the ratio of UCL to UCL + DCL is as high as 66%. Second, remarkable enhancement of the four-photon UCL of 1D2–3H6/3F4 was observed, indicating that the IOPC is a helpful microstructure to realize high-order UCL. These facts can be both attributed to the inhibition of radiative and nonradiative relaxation in the IOPCs, which was further evidenced by UCL dynamics. Third, in the IOPCs the local thermal effect induced by laser exposure is suppressed, resulting in decreased phonon density and thus increased overall photon conversion efficiency. This work indicates that the IOPC structure is an effective device for improving the efficiency of UCL in oxide hosts with large phonon energy.
