    , Accepted 11th July 2015First published on 14th July 2015AbstractDeveloping new materials for electrochemical supercapacitors with higher energy density has recently gained tremendous impetus in the context of effective utilization of renewable energy. Herein, we report a simple one-pot synthesis of bundled nanorods of Cu(OH)2 embedded in a matrix of reduced graphene oxide (Cu(OH)2@RGO) under mild hydrothermal conditions of 80 °C for 1 h. The synthesized material shows a high BET surface area of 78.7 m2 g−1 and a mesoporous nature with a broad pore-size distribution consisting of structural pores as well as inter-particle pores. Raman spectroscopy suggests an intimate interaction between Cu(OH)2 and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) creating more defects by destruction of sp2 domains which would help the defect-assisted charge transport during electrochemical processes. When investigated as an electrochemical supercapacitor, Cu(OH)2@RGO shows a high capacitance of 602 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 in 1 M KOH in a three-electrode cell configuration. Detailed electrochemical studies indicate that the Faradic processes are diffusion controlled and follow a quasi-reversible kinetics. Further, a two-electrode symmetric cell shows good energy density and power density (84.5 Wh kg−1 at 0.55 kW kg−1 and 20.5 Wh kg−1 at 5.5 kW kg−1) characteristics demonstrating superior application potential of this common low-cost transition metal hydroxide for high performance energy storage devices.
1. Introduction
Energy storage devices are increasingly becoming important for the success of renewable energy utilization by bridging the gap between supply and demand. In this respect, electrochemical supercapacitors are in the forefront due to their intrinsically high conversion efficiency and compatibility with energy generated from solar, wind, nuclear sources etc., in addition to the unique advantages that include a simple principle, high dynamics of charge propagation, pulsed power supply and a long steady cycle life.1–3 Electrical charge can be stored in a supercapacitor through two basic mechanisms, acting either separately or in combination: (i) formation of an electrical double layer (non-faradic) in the electrode–electrolyte interface and (ii) charge transfer (faradic) across the electrode–electrolyte interface. The physico-chemical properties of the electro-active material are the most important factors governing the electrochemical performance. Carbonaceous materials,3–5 such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes,6,7 carbon nanofibers,8,9 graphene10,11etc., have been utilized in electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) due to their high surface to volume ratio, outstanding electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical/electrochemical stability. Still, the presently available commercial EDLCs can offer energy densities in the range of only 5–10 Wh kg−1. On the other hand, by exploiting the pseudocapacitive properties of conducting polymers12,13 and transition metal oxides/hydroxides,14–19 energy densities several times higher than EDLC could be realized (10–200 Wh kg−1). Most of the transition metal oxides are wide band gap semiconductors or even insulators.20,21 Therefore, though they exhibit high specific capacitance, their intrinsic poor electronic conductivity limits the power density, thus compromising the most advantageous characteristic of a supercapacitor. Conducting polymers are inexpensive and flexible, but offer a relatively lower capacitance <100 F g−1 and suffer from chemical instability in electrolytes resulting in poor cycle life.20 Recently, transition metal hydroxides such as Co(OH)2, Ni(OH)2 and Cu(OH)2 have emerged as attractive alternatives to the corresponding oxide counterparts on account of their layered structure with large interlayer spacing and well-defined electrochemical redox activity.22–26 However, most of the studies so far are focused on Co(OH)222,23 and Ni(OH)224,25 whereas Cu(OH)226 is relatively less explored despite being known to have a fast Cu(II)/Cu(III) redox couple. Recently, a composite electrode, Mn:CuO/Cu(OH)2, showed a capacitance of 600 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 scan rate using 1 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte.27 Except for one report where a low capacitance of 120 F g−1 was observed,26 there is no work on the supercapacitive properties of Cu(OH)2 in the pristine form. This may be due to the fact that pristine Cu(OH)2 suffers from poor cyclability and low capacity, which are mainly caused by their low conductivity and large volume change during charge/discharge cycles.27–31 In recent years, it has been demonstrated that developing carbon–inorganic composites could be an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance.12,32 In this respect, graphene, an intriguing two-dimensional carbon material, with outstanding electrical conductivity and the ability to promote electron transfer reactions has attracted considerable attention for supercapacitor applications. It is expected that graphene or graphene-like RGO embedded Cu(OH)2 could offer much improved performance through complete utilization of the fast Cu(II)/Cu(III) redox couple by effective charge transfer through the graphene network. Additionally, such composites can promote the electrical double layer capacitance and accommodate a large amount of superficial electroactive species to participate in faradaic redox reactions. Furthermore, any associated volume change could also be mitigated by graphene/RGO serving as a buffering matrix. However, until now, to the best of our knowledge, no report is available on the performance of Cu(OH)2@RGO as an electrochemical supercapacitor. Chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) is considered to be the most economical approach for preparing graphene in situ. Being hydrophilic and containing a large number of oxygen containing groups such as OH, COOH, etc., GO is readily dispersed in water producing single layers. Therefore, in the present work, we have adopted a one-pot synthesis strategy to prepare Cu(OH)2@RGO by a simple low-temperature hydrothermal process and investigated its performance as an electrochemical supercapacitor. We show here that the synthesized composite, when studied in the three-electrode cell configuration, exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 602 F g−1 at a constant current density of 0.2 A g−1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte together with good rate performance and cycling stability. Further to demonstrate its practical applicability, following the best practice method,23,33–35 symmetric cells in the two-electrode configuration have been studied which show a high energy density of 84.5 Wh kg−1 and excellent cycling stability.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
The chemicals used were in the as-received form, without further purification. In all experiments, ultrapure water obtained from a three-stage Millipore Mill-Q (Merck, Germany) purification system was used. The following chemicals were used for synthesis: graphite powder (99.99%, Merck, Germany), copper nitrate nonahydrate [Cu(NO3)2·9H2O] (99%, Merck, Germany), KMnO4 (97%, Merck, Germany), 25% ammonia (99%, RANKEM, India), NaOH (≥98%, Merck, Germany), H2SO4, HCl, H2O2 and NaNO3 (≥99%, Merck, Germany).
2.2 Synthesis of graphene oxide
Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared following an improved modified Hummer method.36,37 In a typical experiment, graphite powder (5.0 g) was thoroughly mixed in 150 ml of concentrated H2SO4 keeping the solution in an ice bath (0–5 °C) to which 2.5 g of NaNO3 was added under vigorous stirring conditions. After ∼3 h, KMnO4 (20.0 g) was slowly added to the above mixture maintaining the solution temperature not exceeding 35 °C. After ∼1 h, warm H2O (250.0 ml) was added slowly raising the mixture temperature to ∼95 °C and maintaining it for ∼30 min. Thereafter, the temperature of the solution was lowered to ∼30 °C by placing it into an ice bath. Warm H2O (500.0 ml) and 30% H2O2 were added into it gradually till the color of the solution turned from purple-green to bright yellow. After stirring for 1 h, the reaction was ended by cooling to room temperature and the colorless supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The precipitate was then washed several times with deionized water, 30% HCl and ethanol successively. After vacuum drying at 50 °C for ∼12 h, the resulting brown solid (GO) was collected and stored for further experiments.
2.3 Synthesis of Cu(OH)2@RGO
A schematic of the synthesis strategy adopted in the present study is shown in Scheme 1. At first, 400 mg of the synthesized graphene oxide (GO) powder was mixed with 200 ml of deionized water in the ratio of 2:1 (wt:vol) of GO:H2O. Then the mixture was ultrasonicated for 1 h to disperse the GO properly in deionized water. After that, the brown dispersion was subjected to 20 min of centrifugation at 4000 rpm to remove any extra aggregates. A homogeneously dispersed graphene oxide suspension was obtained.

The synthesis of reduced graphene oxide anchored Cu(OH)2 [Cu(OH)2@RGO] was carried out as follows. In a typical procedure, 2.41 g of Cu(NO3)2·9H2O was dissolved in 200 ml of GO suspension under stirring conditions. Then 6.0 ml of 25% ammonia solution was added slowly, following which 0.1 M NaOH was added to the above solution under vigorous agitation. The solution was then transferred into a beaker and heated at 80 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the product was centrifuged and washed several times with deionized water to maintain pH of the product to 7.0 and then, with acetone. Finally, the resulting Cu(OH)2@RGO composite was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h.
For comparison of the electrochemical performance, Cu(OH)2 was also synthesized following the same procedure except for using the GO suspension.38
2.4 Material characterization
X-ray diffraction of the powder samples was carried out in the 2θ range of 10°–80° at a scanning rate of 2° min−1 by using an X-ray diffractometer (Philips X'Pert, the Netherlands) with Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Fourier transformed infra-red (FTIR) spectra were recorded by a BOMEN infrared spectrophotometer in transmission mode in the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1. Raman spectroscopy was carried out by using a Renishaw In Via Reflex micro Raman spectrometer with excitation of an argon ion laser (514 nm). A ZEISS Supra 35 (Germany) field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and a 300 kV Tecnai G2 30ST (FEI) transmission electron microscope were used for observation of the microstructure and morphology of the synthesized powders. A Quantachrome (USA) Autosorb surface analyzer was used to carry out BET surface area measurements at 77.3 K. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under argon flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer (STA449F, Netzsch, Germany).
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
For fabrication of the working electrodes, a homogeneous slurry was prepared by thoroughly mixing Cu(OH)2@RGO powder with SuperP carbon and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder in 80:10:10 weight ratio. The slurry was then cast onto nickel foams of dimension 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm to form the electrodes. The electrodes were then dried at 100 °C for ∼4 h in a vacuum oven to evaporate residual solvents. Mass loading of the active material in the electrodes was between 2.8 and 3.0 mg cm−2. Prior to the electrochemical tests, the electrodes were soaked in a 1 M KOH solution for 6 h for proper wetting. The electrochemical experiments were performed both in three-electrode and in two-electrode configurations. In a three-electrode set-up, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) and Pt mesh (2 cm × 2 cm) were used as the reference and the counter electrode respectively. Two electrode symmetric supercapacitor pouch cells were assembled using two Cu(OH)2@RGO electrodes separated by a Celgard 2300 membrane (thickness, 20 μm). 1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte in all cells. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted using a Galvanostat–Potentiostat (PGSTAT 300N, Autolab, the Netherlands). CVs were measured between 0.0 V and 0.47 V for three-electrode cells and between −0.9 and +0.9 V for two-electrode cells at different scan rates (2–100 mV s−1). Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were performed at various current densities (0.2–10 A g−1) in the same respective potential windows. EIS measurements were carried out at an open circuit potential in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–1.0 MHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The impedance data were fitted to an equivalent circuit model using NOVA 1.9 software.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology
Formation of the Cu(OH)2@RGO composite structure and the phase purity were first examined by X-ray diffraction. The observed peaks in the diffractogram, shown in Fig. 1a, correspond to the characteristic reflections of Cu(OH)2 and can be indexed to a orthorhombic phase (space group Cmc21) in agreement with JCPDS data (file number 01-080-0656) for spertiniite. Appearance of sharp peaks indicates good crystallinity of the synthesized material. However, a somewhat noisy background in the diffractogram may have originated from the nanocrystalline nature. The calculated lattice parameters are found to be a = 2.953 Å, b = 10.594 Å, and c = 5.277 Å, which are in good agreement with the literature values.39 No additional peaks could be detected in the diffractogram indicating the absence of possible impurity phases such as oxides of copper. However, it is to be noted that the diffractogram for the synthesized GO (Fig. S1, ESI†) shows two peaks at 2θ values of 25.2° and 42.1°, which can be assigned to reflections from (002) and (100) planes.40 These peaks overlap with the peaks due to reflections from the (021) and (131) planes of Cu(OH)2. Thus, though the XRD results indicate the formation of Cu(OH)2@RGO with good crystallinity, the presence of any unreacted GO cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the structural features of the synthesized Cu(OH)2@RGO were further characterized by Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy to ascertain the conversion of GO to RGO.

Fig. 1b shows the FITR spectra of Cu(OH)2, GO and Cu(OH)2@RGO. In Cu(OH)2, the presence of peaks at 3564 and 3311 cm−1 reflects stretching modes of hydroxyl groups in Cu(OH)2. Similar bands have been observed for Cu(OH)2@RGO at 3582 and 3317 cm−1. The intense nature of these bands is indicative of good crystalline quality.41 The band at 1628 cm−1 reflects the bending mode of the absorbed water in Cu(OH)2 which appears at 1600 cm−1 for Cu(OH)2@RGO. On the other hand, C–O stretching vibration at 938 cm−1 can be assigned to the corresponding metal cation (Cu2+) in Cu(OH)2@RGO which appears at 933 cm−1 for pristine Cu(OH)2.42–45 The peak at 687 cm−1 corresponds to the bending vibration of hydrogen-bound OH groups. The Cu–O stretching and Cu–O–H bending vibrations occur at lower frequencies and are observed at 595 cm−1 for Cu(OH)2@RGO and at 610 cm−1 for Cu(OH)2. In the FTIR spectrum for GO, a number of characteristic absorption bands are observed. The band at 3428 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of O–H, while the bands at 1737, and 1039 cm−l correspond to the stretching vibrations of CO, and C–O–C, respectively. On the other hand, the bands at 1621, 1421 and 1225 cm−l can be attributed to the vibration of carboxyl groups.46,47 These bands become weak or disappear completely when GO is reduced to RGO.48 In the spectrum for Cu(OH)2@RGO, complete disappearance of the peaks at 1737, 1421, 1225 and 1039 cm−1 indicates removal of oxygenated groups and the appearance of a new peak at 1385 cm−1 indicates C–N stretching vibration. Further, the presence of a strong CC stretching peak at 1600 cm−1 suggests a restoration of the graphite basal plane. Therefore, the FTIR studies clearly indicate complete reduction of GO to RGO forming a Cu(OH)2@RGO composite.
Raman spectroscopy is an important tool to characterize carbon containing materials. Fig. 1c shows Raman spectra of GO and Cu(OH)2@RGO. The Raman spectrum of GO exhibits two noticeable peaks centered at 1605 and 1361 cm−1, which are assigned to the G-band and the D-band, respectively.49 The G-band is linked to the stretching of sp2-hybridised carbon atoms (E2g phonons) while the D-band originates from the disordered graphitic carbon indicating the presence of defects.50,51 Therefore, the ID/IG ratio is a good measure of the relative concentration of disorder or defect and the average size of the p-conjugation.49,52 An ID/IG ratio of 0.89 has been found for GO. In the Raman spectrum of the Cu(OH)2@RGO composite, both the G-band and D-band are found to be shifted to a lower frequency region (centered at 1586 and 1352 cm−1 respectively) i.e. toward graphitic nature, confirming the reduction of GO to RGO.53,54 It is expected that the intensity of the D-band will gradually decrease when the GO is reduced. However, a higher ID/IG ratio (0.98) for Cu(OH)2@RGO with respect to that for GO suggests an intimate interaction between Cu(OH)2 and RGO resulting in more defects and destruction of sp2 domains.55 Viewed from another angle, such kind of interaction would lead to a better charge transfer through defect-assisted propagation during electrochemical processes.
The morphology and microstructure of the synthesized Cu(OH)2@RGO have been investigated by FESEM and TEM. Fig. 2a shows the FESEM micrograph of GO. The stacked layers of GO sheets, slightly corrugated due to partial exfoliation, are clearly visible. The low and high magnification FESEM images of Cu(OH)2@RGO (Fig. 2b & 2c) show that the morphological features consist of uniformly distributed cluster of nanorods, bundled together. TEM images (Fig. 3a and 3b) also reveal that these nanorod bundles are uniformly dispersed in a RGO matrix forming a well interconnected hybrid network and are coated with a thin RGO layer. The average diameter of these nanorods is estimated to be ∼12 nm. From the high resolution TEM image, the thickness of the RGO layer has been estimated to be ∼6 nm. Well resolved lattice fringes, observed in the HRTEM image (Fig. 3c), indicate good crystallinity of the RGO layer with an interplanar spacing of 0.21 nm which corresponds to (107) planes of RGO. For Cu(OH)2, clear lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.23 nm and 0.25 nm corresponding to (022) and (111) planes could be observed. Observation of well resolved spots arranged in circular rings further confirms the formation of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2 with good crystallinity. Formation of such bundled nanorods could be explained as follows: Cu2+ ions have a strong tendency for square planar coordination with OH− forming extended chains. Interlinking of these chains through coordination of OH to dz2 of Cu2+ would form a two-dimensional (2D) layer structure which, in turn, would stack upon one another through hydrogen bonding.56 Relative growth rates of different crystal faces determine the final morphology.

 Fig. 3  TEM images of synthesized Cu(OH)2@RGO (a) low magnification with the SADP in the inset, (b) high magnification and (c) HRTEM image (taken from the marked area in Fig. 3b). 
During the formation of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2, the growth rate being proportional to 1/dhkl, growth along [100] far outpaces the growth along other directions resulting in nanorods with a high aspect ratio. Also, as the interlayer H-bonding is weakened under the alkaline conditions, the nanorods are bundled in a self-assembled manner due to the interfacial tension.57
Dimension of the pores and their distribution are important parameters for a supercapacitor electrode material as these will regulate the access of electrolytes to the interior surfaces. N2 absorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution plots of the synthesized Cu(OH)2@RGO are shown in Fig. 4a. The convex nature till P/P0 = 1.0 indicates a type III isotherm. The hysteresis loop starts from P/P0 = 0.4 revealing a mixed H3 and H1 type and indicating the existence of both inter-particle and structural pores. From the pore size distribution plot, calculated from the adsorption part of the isotherms (inset of Fig. 3a) a mesoporous nature is revealed where, the structural pores are indicated by two narrow pore size distributions centered at ∼4 and ∼6 nm and the inter-particle pores are indicated by a broad pore-size distribution in the range of 10–85 nm. Existence of such kinds of mesopores and macropores would allow the interior surfaces to be wetted by the electrolyte and available for electrochemical reactions. A high BET surface area of 78.7 m2 g−1 has been obtained for Cu(OH)2@RGO with a pore volume of 0.0135 cm3 g−1 nm−1.

The thermal stability of the synthesized Cu(OH)2@RGO has been investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. Fig. 4b shows the TGA plot at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under constant argon flow. The observed weight losses can be assigned to three major steps: (i) a weight loss of ∼8.96% between 30 and 170 °C due to the loss of physically absorbed water, (ii) a major weight loss of ∼25.86% between 170 and 641 °C due to the decomposition of reduced graphene oxide to CO2, and (iii) a weight loss of ∼9.46% between 641 and 816 °C due to the formation of CuO from Cu(OH)2. Usually, Cu(OH)2–CuO conversion is known to occur at ∼892 °C,38 but the presence of carbon in the composite may accelerate the process. Therefore, the thermal analysis results indicate that the synthesized Cu(OH)2@RGO is thermally stable up to ∼170 °C.
3.2 Electrochemical properties

3.2.1 Three-electrode cells. 
The electrochemical properties of Cu(OH)2@RGO were first examined in a three-electrode configuration by using a Pt mesh as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode. Similar experiments were also carried out on pristine Cu(OH)2 for comparison. Fig. 5a & 5b show the CV scans in the potential range 0.0–0.47 V with scan rates of 2–100 mV s−1 for Cu(OH)2 and Cu(OH)2@RGO respectively. In both cases, the shape of the voltammograms deviates from the ideal rectangular nature indicating predominant pseudocapacitive behaviour.58 However, an increase in the CV area for Cu(OH)2@RGO with respect to Cu(OH)2 indicates that the presence of RGO strongly enhances the electrochemical activity of Cu(OH)2. A pair of symmetric redox peaks is observed at ∼0.25/0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) which can be assigned to reversible Cu(II)/Cu(III) redox reactions involving an one-electron transfer process:26 Cu(OH)2 + OH− ↔ CuO·OH + H2O + e−(1)
 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms of (a) Cu(OH)2 and (b) Cu(OH)2@RGO in a three-electrode configuration in the potential window of 0.0 to 0.47 V; (c) potential separation (i), variation of anodic and cathodic peak potentials (ii & iii), midpoint potential with the square root of the scan rate (iv), and (d) Randles–Sevcik plot. 
In the aqueous KOH electrolyte, RGO is known to show pseudo capacitance, besides EDLC, in the potential range of −0.1 to −0.3 V vs. SCE.59 Therefore, in the present case, the contribution from RGO is limited to EDLC only. Interestingly, with increasing scan rate, the shape of CV changes and tends to approach a rectangular shape, typical of capacitive behavior. Also, the anodic and cathodic peaks are shifted towards more positive and more negative side respectively indicating that the voltammetric current is diffusion controlled. Such a type of shifting of redox peaks is commonly observed for metal hydroxides such as Ni(OH)2,24,25 and Co(OH)2.22,23
The separation potential (ΔEP) of the cathodic and anodic peaks is a measure of reversibility of the redox processes. A small ΔEP of 102 mV at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 indicates good reversibility of electrochemical processes occurring in Cu(OH)2 as given in eqn (1). As seen from [Fig. 5c (i)], no significant difference in ΔEP is observed between Cu(OH)2@RGO and Cu(OH)2 at each of the scan rates ranging from 2 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 indicating that the presence of RGO does not influence the reversibility of the faradic processes of Cu(OH)2. However, as the scan rate increases, ΔEP increases suggesting a quasi-reversible kinetics which is diffusion controlled. This is further confirmed by observance of a near linear dependence of peak currents on square root of scan rates (Randles–Sevcik plot) as shown in (Fig. 5d). Also, it is observed that the anodic peak potential shifted positively and the cathodic peak potential shifted negatively following a linear dependence on v1/2 [Fig. 5c (ii) & (iii)] and the mid-point potential (formal potential) is found to be independent of the scan rate [Fig. 5c (iv)] demonstrating the typical characteristics of redox reactions.60

Fig. 6a & 6b show the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) profiles at different current densities of 0.2–10.0 A g−1 for Cu(OH)2 and Cu(OH)2@RGO respectively. For both cases, as expected, the shapes of charging and discharging curves were not ideal straight lines, confirming the pseudocapacitive behavior. However, a large increase in capacitance is observed at all current densities for Cu(OH)2@RGO compared to Cu(OH)2. This can be assigned to the increased conduction network in RGO enhancing the charge transport. Also, Raman spectroscopy results suggest an intimate interaction between Cu(OH)2 and RGO whereby the sp2 domains of RGO are partially destructed creating defects which would lead to a better charge transfer through defect-assisted propagation. With increasing current density, the plateau region in the charge curve diminishes supporting the observations in CV.

The specific capacitance (Cs) values have been calculated from GCD using the following equation: (2)where m is the total mass of the materials in the electrode excluding the weight of the PTFE binder. While in most of the reports the weight of only the active material is used for calculating Cs (leading to a higher value), it is more reasonable to consider the total mass of the electroactive materials as carbon would contribute to the EDLC component. Fig. 6c shows the variation of specific capacitance with increasing current density (0.2–10.0 A g−1) for both Cu(OH)2@RGO and Cu(OH)2. At a current density of 0.2 A g−1, a Cs value of 419 F g−1 is observed for Cu(OH)2. This value is only 42% of the theoretical capacitance (989 F g−1) of Cu(OH)2 calculated on the basis of one-electron transfer process. At the same current density, Cu(OH)2@RGO exhibits a much higher Cs value of 602 F g−1 highlighting the positive effect of RGO in enhancing the charge transport. However, in both cases, as the current density is increased, a gradual decrease in Cs is observed. Nonetheless, even at a very high current density of 10 A g−1, Cu(OH)2@RGO shows a Cs of 322 F g−1 compared to only 222 F g−1 shown by Cu(OH)2. The observed capacitance values are much higher than the value (120 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1) reported previously for Cu(OH)2.26 Further, the present results are superior to the capacitance obtained for lotus-like CuO/Cu(OH)2 (278 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−2)61 or RGO/Cu2O (98.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1).62
Prolonged cycle life and ability to deliver power within a very short time are the two essential requirements of a practical supercapacitor. Therefore, the cycling performance of Cu(OH)2@RGO has been tested at a high current density of 5 A g−1 for 5000 charge–discharge cycles and compared with that of Cu(OH)2 (Fig. 6d). Pristine Cu(OH)2 shows a rapid fading in capacitance with increasing cycle number. As a result, only 45.6% of the first cycle specific capacitance of 128 F g−1 is retained after 5000 cycles. On the other hand, dramatic improvement in the cycling performance is observed for Cu(OH)2@RGO. A much higher specific capacitance of 402 F g−1 is obtained for Cu(OH)2@RGO in the first cycle. After an initial decrease for about 1000 cycles, a steady Cs value of 357 F g−1 is observed till 5000 cycles with no further fading. Also, the Coulombic efficiency approaches unity. Such good cycling stability can be ascribed to the unique 3D nanostructures comprising of bundled nanorods and to the presence of RGO which helps in mitigating the volume expansion of Cu(OH)2 during repeated charging and discharging.

3.2.2 Symmetric cell in a two-electrode configuration
While a three-electrode cell provides valuable information about the electrochemical characteristics of a specific material, a two-electrode test cell matches more closely the physical configuration and charge transfer that occurs in a practical supercapacitor although generally with a lower value of specific capacitance.63 In order to check the practical applicability, the electrochemical properties of the synthesized Cu(OH)2@RGO have been investigated in a two-electrode configuration by assembling symmetric Cu(OH)2@RGO//1 M KOH//Cu(OH)2@RGO coin cells. Fig. 7a shows the cyclic voltammograms recorded at different scan rates of 2–100 mV s−1 in the potential window of −0.9 to 0.9 V. It is noteworthy that by constructing the full cell, the potential window could be extended to 1.8 V. A similar extended voltage of 1.8 V has been observed for a two-electrode symmetric Ru//Ru supercapacitor33 and 1.6 V for a symmetric RuO2//RuO2 supercapacitor.34 The CV curves of the full cell exhibit a quasi-rectangular shape indicating pseudocapacitive behaviour. The features of CV remain unchanged even at a high scan rate of 100 mV s−1, indicating highly reversible charge/discharge response and good rate capability of the device. The corresponding charge discharge profiles are shown in Fig. 7b at different current densities of 0.05 to 5 A g−1 in the potential window of −0.9 to +0.9 V. In accordance with the observations in CV, the charge discharge profiles show a non-linear behaviour typical of pseudocapacitors. However, as the current density is increased, the profiles tend to become linear. The observed symmetry in the charge and discharge profiles indicates good reversibility. Specific capacitance (Cs) values were calculated from the discharge profile using the equation.64 (3)where m represents the sum of the total mass of both electrodes excluding the weight of the PTFE binder. A high value of 66 F g−1 has been observed at a current density of 0.05 A g−1 (Fig. S2, ESI†). However, with increasing current density the capacitance decreases and at 5 A g−1, a value of 16 F g−1 is obtained (Fig. S2†). The cycling performance of the symmetric cell has been tested at 0.5 A g−1 for 5000 cycles and is shown in Fig. 7c. A specific capacitance value of 40 F g−1 is observed in the first cycle. Excellent cycling behavior is observed with no significant decrease in capacitance till 5000 cycles with ∼100% retention. After the few initial cycles, the Coulombic efficiency also approaches unity, which has been calculated by using the following equation: (4)
 Fig. 7  (a) Cyclic voltammograms at different scan rates (2–100 mV s−1) in the potential window of −0.9 to 0.9 V, (b) galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles, (c) cycling performance, and (d) Ragone plot of Cu(OH)2@RGO in a two-electrode symmetric cell configuration. 
For a high performance supercapacitor, sustenance of high energy density at high power densities is a key criterion. Energy density and power density values have been calculated from the GCD and the resulting Ragone plots are shown in Fig. 6d. The Cu(OH)2@RGO//Cu(OH)2@RGO symmetric cell displays reasonably good values of specific energy and specific power in the range of 84.5–20.5 Wh kg−1 at 0.55–5.5 kW kg−1 along with a relatively slow decrease in energy density with increasing power density. These values are much higher than that of the conventional 1.6 V AC//AC symmetric EDLC supercapacitor (10 Wh kg−1).65 While there is no prior report available on symmetric Cu(OH)2 cells, there are a couple of recent reports available on 3D highly ordered nanoporous CuO66 and CuO/graphene67 where energy density values of 19.7 Wh kg−1 and 79 Wh kg−1 have been obtained at power densities of 7000 W kg−1 and 565 W kg−1 respectively. In comparison, the results obtained in the present work are quite impressive, particularly in terms of power density, which eventually confirm the potential of Cu(OH)2@RGO for high performance energy storage devices.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a simple one-pot synthesis strategy through a low-temperature hydrothermal process is developed to prepare Cu(OH)2@RGO where Cu(OH)2 nanorod bundles embedded in a thin RGO matrix are produced. A high specific capacitance of 602 F g−1 and excellent cycling stability indicate that Cu(OH)2 can be an efficient supercapacitor electrode with superior performance to its oxide counterparts. Such high performance originated from the intimate interaction between RGO and Cu(OH)2 and subsequently improved charge transfer through the RGO network, which also serves as a buffering matrix to mitigate volume changes. A high BET surface area (78.7 m2 g−1) and mesoporous nature with a broad pore-size distribution, allowing every available surface to be wetted by the electrolyte, also contribute toward achieving high capacitance. The practical applicability of the developed material is demonstrated in two electrode symmetric cells where a high energy density of 84.5 Wh kg−1 could be achieved together with an excellent power density through retention of an energy density of 20.5 Wh kg−1 at 54.6 kW kg−1.
