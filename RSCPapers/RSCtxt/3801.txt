    , Accepted 11th August 2022First published on 11th August 2022AbstractTwo non-fullerene acceptors, A–D–A′–D–A systems, with an identical central 2-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (CF3-BTA) (A′) connected with 4,4-bis (2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[[2,1-b]3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) (D), to different end capped acceptor units, namely tricyanoethylene (TOCR1) and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yldene)malononitrile (TOCR2) are prepared. These two materials were used as acceptors in polymer solar cells, along with two wide band-gap conjugated polymers, P1 or P2. Following optimization of the weight ratio variation and solvent vapor annealing process, the PSCs based on P1:TOCR1, P1:TOCR2, P2:TOCR1 and P2:TOCR2 demonstrated overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.31, 15.17, 11.88, and 5.89 percent with the highest value corresponding to P1:TOCR2 (15.17%). The high value of exciton dissociation and charge collection probability in P1:TOCR2 may explain the high PCE value. The lowest value of P2:TOCR2 based PSCs, on the other hand, is due to the low HOMO offset between TOCR2 and P2, which hinders exciton dissociation and hole transfer from TOCR2 to P2, as evidenced by the fact that the photoluminescence intensity of pristine TOCR2 is not fully quenched in the P2:TOCR2 blend, whereas the PL intensity of TOCR1 or TOCR2 is completely quenched in P1:TOCR1, P1:TOCR2 and P2:TOCR1 blends.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaic technology is one of the most effective methods for converting solar energy into electrical energy.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer have received a lot of attention because of their advantages of light weight, flexibility, semitransparency, easy adjustment of energy levels and optical properties via molecular engineering, and low-cost solution processed techniques for commercialization.1–4 The BHJ active layer is a mixture of n-type (acceptor) and p-type (donor) organic semiconductors that form bi-continuous interpenetrating networks and generate ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer, allowing efficient charge generation and separation processes by increasing the D/A interfacial area.5–7 Due to their isotropic charge transfer and strong electron affinity, fullerene derivatives (PC71BM or PC61BM) were the dominant acceptors in the early stages of OSC development,8,9 achieving a PCE (Power Conversion Efficiency) of over 11%.10 However, fullerenes’ restricted tunable chemical structures and absorption profile limit diverse possibilities for further enhancement in OSC PCE, leaving room for the creation of alternative acceptor molecules. Nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (NFSMAs)11–15 have been created as an alternative to fullerene overcoming the drawbacks of fullerene analogues, and the PCE of OSC based NFSMAs in a single BHJ active layer has approached 18%,16–20 but the PCE of these devices could be enhanced to 20%,21,22 according to predictions. These impressive advancements in OSCs provide a new avenue for their commercialization.23–25
Currently, the most efficient NFSMA materials are based on A–D–A (represented by IT-4F),26 A–DA′D–A architecture (Y-series, developed by the Zou group)27,28 and A–DD′D–A,29,30 where A and D denotes an electron-withdrawing and electron-donating unit respectively. All these types are built around a large DD′D or DA′D fused core. However, the complicated synthesis of these fused-ring NFAs increased the cost of the materials and made them unsuitable for commercial purposes of OSCs.31–33
Another class of NFSMAs is known as un-fused ring acceptors (UFAs), which have an A–DA′(D′)D–A architecture34,35 and benefit from a simple structure and easy synthesis because each unit of the central core is connected by single bonds. Single bond connected structures are significantly easier to synthesize than fused counterparts.36,37 Noncovalent conformational locks must be introduced into the molecular design to ensure that UFAs maintain nearly coplanar backbones, similar to those of fused ring acceptors.38,39 By selecting appropriate building blocks, the UFAs’ absorption profile, frontier energy levels, and molecular packing can all be easily tuned.40–42 Because single bonds are used to connect adjacent units in UFAs, they are rotatable and exhibit more conformational isomers than fused ring acceptors, which is detrimental to achieve molecular packing in the solid state43 and leads to an increased reorganization energy and may obstruct charge transport.44 To overcome this issue, molecular geometry must be locked by intramolecular non-covalent interactions, such as F⋯H,35,45 O⋯S,46–48 Se⋯O,49 S⋯N,50,51 S⋯F,52,53 and C–H⋯O54 interactions, reducing the rotation of single bonds to reach rigid and coplanar structures in UFA,52,53 to improve the ordered molecular packing and the efficient charge transport. So far, PCEs greater than 15% have been achieved for PSCs based on UFAs,55 which is comparable to those obtained for Y6 fused acceptors. Furthermore, it is well known that the near-infrared (NIR) region receives approximately 51 percent of photon flux under AM1.5 G conditions, while the visible and UV regions receive only47 47% and 2% radiation, respectively.56 As a result, in order to reduce synthesis complexity and cost, new NFSMAs with broad absorption spectra and appropriate energy levels must be designed.
Benzotriazole (BTA) has been widely used as an electro-deficient unit in both polymers57–61 and very efficient small molecules (Y-series),62–64 in OSCs because it prefers quinoidal structures that give rise to deep frontier orbitals and enhance electron delocalization within the molecule, extending the absorption range to the near infrared region of the solar spectrum.65–68 Due to the additional nitrogen atom, BTA has a higher HOMO and a smaller band-gap than benzothiadiazole (BT).28,69 The effect of substitution on the N-atom has been extensively studied by introducing different branched alkyl chains;70,71 however, the effect of aromatic substituents in the N2 atom of BTA on photovoltaic properties is still unknown. It has been reported that the N-arylbenzotriazole derivatives present a wider absorption range than the N-alkyl compounds.
In this contribution, we report the synthesis and properties of two new unfused NFSMAs, TOCR1 and TOCR2 with a A–DA′D–A structure (Scheme 1). The 2-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (CF3-BTA) was used as the central core A′ to enhance the electron delocalization along the molecule and extend the absorption range toward the near infrared region of the solar spectrum. Furthermore, the CF3 groups have a strong electron withdrawing effect and can change some important material properties like solubility, thermal and chemical stability, and redox properties.72
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of TOCR1, TOCR2, P1 and P2. 
The electron-donating unit 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[[2,1-b]3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) can not only promote the intramolecular charge transfer but also introduce perpendicular side chains onto the bridged C-atom to ensure sufficient solubility and to avoid excessive crystallization.73 The conjugated system's planarity is maintained by non-covalent interactions between the BTA core and CPDT bridges. To regulate the optical and electrochemical properties, two different electron withdrawing terminals, 2-(5,6,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yldene) malononitrile and tri-cyanoethylene, were introduced. Both NFSMAs exhibited broad absorption spectra spanning the visible to near infrared wavelength range. The photovoltaic properties were investigated by using the BHJ active layer with two wide bandgap D–A conjugated polymers P1 (HOMO/LUMO = −5.46/3.53 eV) and P2 (HOMO/LUMO = −5.67/3.49 eV) (Scheme 1)61 with a complementary absorption profile to both NFSMAs. The average molecular weight/polydispersity index of P1 and P2 are 16.1 kDa/1.31 and 15.3 kDa/1.19, respectively. Using toluene as a non-halogen processing solvent and subsequent solvent vapor annealing in a THF environment, high PCEs of 10.31%, 15.17%, and 11.88% were achieved for P1:TOCR1, P1:TOCR2, and P2:TOCR1, respectively. The PSCs based on P2:TOCR2 showed a poor PCE of 5.89%, since the HOMO offset between P2 and TOCR2 is −0.08 eV, hampering the hole transfers from the HOMO of TOCR2 to P2 and leading to a low value of JSC. These findings suggest that unfused NFSMAs with an A–DA′D–A framework and a CF3-BTA as the core have a promising future in high efficiency PSCs through rational molecular design and pairing with well-matched energy levels and complementary absorption profiles.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and structural characterization

Scheme 2 depicts the synthetic route of TOCR1 and TOCR2. Stille coupling of bisbromotriazole derivative 174 and CPDT-tributyltin75 under microwave irradiation (110 °C, 20 min) yielded the key intermediate 2 in 50% yield. TOCR1 was obtained in 82% yield from the reaction of 2 with tetracyanoethylene in DMF. On the other hand, the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction of 2 with DMF and POCl3 gave bisaldehyde 3 (yield: 87%) that through a condensation reaction with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile76 afforded the target TOCR2 in 63% yield.

All new compounds and intermediate synthetic details and characterization are displayed in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S12). It should be noted that the 1H-RMN of TOCR2 was recorded at 323 K for better resolution, and due to its low solubility, a good 13C-RMN could not be obtained.
Both goal compounds, TOCR1 and TOCR2, show excellent thermal stability, higher than 350 °C according to the TGA analysis (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†).

In dichloromethane solution, the absorption spectra TOCR1 and TOCR2 revealed absorption peaks at 706 nm (logε = 5.04) and 746 nm (logε = 5.26). The charge transfer character of these bands is demonstrated by the bathochromic shift observed with increasing solvent polarity (Fig. S16 and S17, ESI†).
The thin film absorption spectra of TOCR1 and TOCR2 (Fig. 1(a)) are split into two bands, with onsets at 688 nm and 738 nm for TOCR1 and 754 nm and 836 nm for TOCR2, because of the formation of J-aggregates; the onsets at 882 nm and 962 nm correspond to optical bandgaps of about 1.41 eV and 1.29 eV, respectively (Fig. S18 and S19, ESI†).
The higher electron withdrawing capacity of the 2FIC terminal unit and more prolonged conjugation can explain TOCR2's red-shifted absorption compared to TOCR1.
In addition, the absorption spectra of TOCR1 and TOCR2 are complementary to both copolymers P1 and P2 (Fig. 1(a)), allowing for efficient photon harvesting and generation in the targeted PSCs.42
Osteryoung square wave voltammetry (OSWV) was used to evaluate the electrochemical characteristics of TOCR1 and TOCR2 (Fig. S20–S23, ESI†). TOCR1 and TOCR2's HOMO/LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.77/−4.13 eV and −5.59/−4.02 eV, respectively. These data are shown in Fig. 1(b), together with the values of the frontier orbitals of P1 and P2.
The LUMO–LUMO offset between the donor and acceptor determines photoinduced electron transfer (PET), whereas the HOMO–HOMO offsets between the acceptor and donor determine photoinduced hole transfer (PHT).
The LUMO–LUMO offsets between the donors (P1 and P2) and NFSMAs (TOCR1 and TOCR2) are more than 0.3 eV, indicating that the electron transport from polymers (P1 and P2) to acceptors at the donor/acceptor interface is efficient.77
P1/TOCR1, P1/TOCR2, P2:TOCR1, and P2/TOCR2 have HOMO–HOMO offsets of 0.31 eV, 0.13 eV, 0.10 eV, and −0.08 eV, respectively.

Fig. 1(c) and (d) show the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra obtained to investigate the PET and PHT processes in the BHJ active layers used in the PSCs. TOCR1 and TOCR2 PL, excited at 740 nm and 790 nm, respectively, are significantly quenched for P1/TOCR1, P1/TOCR2, and P2/TOCR1, implying efficient hole transfer from excited TOCR1 to P1, TOCR2 to P1, and TOCR1 to P2, even though the HOMO–HOMO offset is small for these active layers. Similar hole transfer from the HOMO of NFSMA to the HOMO of polymers for a low value of HOMO offset between acceptor and donor, and even zero, has been reported in the literature.78–80 The PL intensity of TOCR2 is only quenched by 68% in the case of the P2/TOCR2 blend, indicating that the negative value of HOMO–HOMO offset between P2/TOCR2 hampers the hole transfer from the excited acceptor to excited donor. Furthermore, the PL of both polymers is almost quenched by either TOCR1 or TOCR2, indicating efficient electron transfer from the excited P donor to either TOCR1 or TOCR2.
2.3. Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations were performed to obtain information about the molecular properties of the synthesized compounds. A conformational study was carried out using scan methodology with B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) as the theory level. The dihedral angle between the benzotriazole core and the CPDT fragment was first rotated 360 degrees. The most stable conformation was the one in which the sulfur atoms of the CPDT groups were facing upwards.
The presence of hydrogen bonds between the triazole's nitrogen atoms and the hydrogens of the CPDT groups, as well as S⋯H interactions between the CPDT groups’ sulfurs and the hydrogens of the benzotriazole, favors this conformation (Fig. 2(a) and Table S1, ESI†). The dihedral angle between the CPDT fragment and the peripheral electro-acceptor group was adjusted to scan the final compounds TOCR1 and TOCR2.
 Fig. 2  Optimized structures of the central fragment (a) and compounds TOCR1 (b) and TOCR2 (c) computed at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p). 
The most stable conformations in both cases are those with the peripheral electro-acceptor groups pointing upward, possibly due to the lower steric hindrance present in this conformation and, in the case of compound TOCR2, to the presence of highly stabilizing S⋯O interactions38,81 (Fig. 2(b), (c) and Table S2, ESI†). Both compounds have a high planarity, as shown in Fig. 2.
The topologies and energy values of the compounds’ frontier molecular orbitals and HOMO–LUMO gaps were obtained from the most stable optimized structures. The HOMO orbital is primarily spread out along the horizontal axis of the molecule in both compounds, and the LUMO orbital is also located along this axis, with a small contribution in the vertical direction (Table S5, ESI†). It is important to note that these compounds, like most of the reference organic compounds used as semiconductors in solar cells, have HOMO–LUMO gap values close to 2 eV.
The electronic spectra of compounds TOCR1 and TOCR2 were calculated, (Fig. S24, ESI†). The theoretical spectra were calculated in dichloromethane solution using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM)82 and the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).83 The M06-2X84 meta-exchange functional was chosen because it produced more accurate results in the calculation of systems with high spatial orbital overlap than the more widely used CAM-B3LYP.
In solution, the absorption spectra of TOCR1 and TOCR2 showed absorption peaks at 706 nm and 746 nm with the maximum extinction coefficient of 3.06 × 106 and 3.66 × 106 mol−1 L−1, respectively associated in both cases with the electronic transition S0 → S1, which is mainly populated by the molecular orbitals HOMO and LUMO (Table S6, ESI†).
As a result, the absorption spectra maxima follow the trend of the calculated HOMO–LUMO gap energies. As a result, compound TOCR2, which has a lower gap value than compound TOCR1, has a greater bathochromic shift of its absorption maximum. The stronger electron withdrawing ability of the two 2FIC terminal units is responsible for the red-shifted absorption. Furthermore, TOCR2 had a stronger vibronic shoulder peak than TOCR1, indicating that the former had stronger intermolecular interaction and closer π,π-stacking in the solid state. The presence of CF3 groups is known to promote the formation of supramolecular interactions.85,86
2.4. Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performances of PSCs with TOCR1 and TOCR2 as acceptors and P1 or P2 as donors were investigated using an indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al device structure. P1 and P2, wide bandgap conjugated polymers with complementary absorption profiles to both NFSMAs, are used as donors. The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was optimized in terms of donor:acceptor weight ratio and solvent vapor annealing for each donor:acceptor pair (Tables S6a, b–S9a, b, ESI†).

Fig. 3 depicts the optimized PSCs’ current–voltage characteristics under illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and EQE spectra, while Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters. PSCs based on P1:TOCR1 and P1:TOCR2 achieved PCEs of 10.31% and 15.17%, respectively. The PCE for the P2:TOCR1 and P2:TOCR2 based PSCs were 11.88% and 5.41 percent, respectively. The value of VOC of PSCs based on TOCR2 is higher than that of TOCR1, regardless of the donors, which may be due to TOCR2's higher lying LUMO as compared to TOCR1, because the VOC of the BHJ PSCs is directly related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor (Fig. 3(a)).70,71

Although the VOC of P2:TOCR2 based PSCs is higher than that of P1:TOCR2, and the FF (Fill Factor) value is also about 0.68, the lower value of PCE for P2:TOCR2 based PSCs is mainly due to the low value of JSC, which is due to the fact that the HOMO offset between the P2 and TOCR2 is −0.08 eV, which hinders photoinduced hole transfer from the excited state (Fig. 3(b)).

Fig. 3(b) shows the optimized PSCs’ external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum. The EQE spectra for TOCR2 are wider than those for TOCR1, regardless of the polymer donor (Fig. 3(b)), which can be attributed to TOCR2's wider absorption spectra than TOCR1. The EQE values for P2:TOCR2 are the lowest of all the prepared PSCs, owing to the negative HOMO offset between P2 and TOCR2, which prevents hole transfer from TOCR2's HOMO to P2 and accounts for the low JSC value.
The JSC values estimated from the integration of the EQE spectra are well matched with those obtained from J–V characteristics (Table 2).
The energy loss (Eloss) in the PSCs is an important parameter and a deciding factor of the overall PCE as well. The Eloss is expressed as Eloss = Eg − qVOC, where Eg is estimated from the onset of the EQE spectra of the devices.87,88 The values of Eloss for all the PSCs are compiled in Table 2. The trend in the values of Eloss follows the HOMO offsets between the polymer and NFSMAs.
Because there is a trade-off between JSC and VOC, the lowest values of Eloss of P2:TOCR2 may result in the highest value of VOC and the lowest value of JSC.89
The variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff), as shown in Fig. 4(a), was investigated to gain insight into exciton dissociation and charge collection in the different PCS for differences in JSC values. Fig. 4(a) shows that for all PSCs except P2:TOCR2, the Jph reaches saturation photocurrent (Jsat) at higher values of Veff and is independent of Veff. The maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) under these conditions has been calculated as Gmax = Jsat/qL, where q is the electronic charge and L is the active layer thickness.

Due to the negative HOMO offset between the P2 and TOCR2, the value of Jph for P2:TOCR2 PSC does not completely saturate even at high Veff, resulting in insufficient exciton dissociation and thus the lowest value of JSC and FF among all PSCs. The ratios of Jph/Jsat under short circuit and maximum power point conditions were used to calculate the values of exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and charge collection probability (Pcoll). Table 3 contains the values of all these parameters.

The trend in these values is in good agreement with the values observed for JSC and FF. The highest value of Gmax, Pdiss and Pcoll among these PSCs implies an enhanced charge generation, as well as extraction and collection, thus increasing the JSC.89
Although the Gmax is about 1.63 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for P2:TOCR2 it is higher than that for P1:TOCR2 which is consistent with its absorption profile and EQE spectral response of the P2:TOCR2 based PSC and the lowest value of Pdiss and Pcoll for P2:TOCR2 may be attributed to the low HOMO offset between the P2 and TOCR2 which is not sufficient for exciton dissociation and subsequently the charge collection. Fig. 4(a) also shows that the Jph does not saturate even at the highest value of Veff, indicating that the formation of space charge near the electrodes in the device based on P2:TOCR2 results in the lowest value of FF.
The charge carrier mobilities of the BHJ active layers used in PSCs are estimated using the dark J–V characteristics of hole-only (hole mobility) and electron-only (electron mobility) devices and fitting them to the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. Table 3 summarizes the values of hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe). TOCR2 devices clearly had slightly higher values of h and e when compared to the TOCR1 counterparts.
The device based on P2:TOCR2 has the highest μh/μe (1.67) value, while P1:TOCR2 has the lowest μh/μe value (1.26). Because FF is driven by charge transport in the BHJ active layer utilized in PSCs, the trend in the ratio of hole and electron mobilities follows the value of FF. The comparatively high FF can be attributed to the P1:TOCR2 blend's balanced mobilities.89,90

Fig. 4(d) and (e) depict the charge recombination kinetics in the devices by tracing the variation of JSC and VOC with illumination intensity (Pin).
The variation of JSC with Pin (Fig. 4(d)) follows the power law as JSC ∝ (Pin)α, where α is the exponent factor and its value gives the information about the extent of bimolecular recombination.
In Table 3, the values of these are compiled for various PSCs. P1:TOCR2 (0.852) and P2:TOCR2 (0.972) have the lowest and highest values, respectively, showing that bimolecular recombination is weakest for P1:TOCR2 and strongest for P2:TOCR2. The dependence of VOC with Pin (Fig. 4(e)) follows the expression VOC = (nkT/q)ln(Pin). The value of n is the slope of VOC–Pin plots. The value of n is lowest and highest for P1:TOCR2 (1.26) and P2:TOCR2 (1.48) (Table 3).
Both bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination are smallest in the P1:TOCR2, resulting in the highest values of JSC, FF, and PCE for the corresponding PSCs.
2.5. XRD and TEM data
An X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded to examine the molecular ordering and crystalline features of the pristine NFAs (Fig. S25, ESI†) and optimized blended films with P1 (Fig. 5). Two distinct diffraction peaks were observed in both pristine NFAs. The (100) diffraction peak for TOCR1 and TOCR2 is located at 2θ = 4.93° and 5.16°, respectively, and corresponds to lamellar diffraction with d-spacing of 1.787 and 1.722 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of the optimized P1:TOCR1 and P1:TOCR2. 
The second (010) diffraction peak located at 2θ = 24.68° and 25.12° for TOCR1 and TOCR2 corresponds to the π–π stacking diffraction with spacing of 0.360 and 0.354 nm, respectively. The intensity of both peaks is higher for TOCR2 than for TOCR1, indicating that TOCR2 has a better crystalline nature than TOCR1, which is beneficial for high electron mobility and consistent with the mobility data.

Fig. 5 depicts the XRD patterns of the optimized P1:TOCR1 and P2:TOCR2. The XRD patterns of both blended films showed two similar diffraction peaks, and the diffraction peaks are slightly different from the pristine NFAs, which may be due to the appropriate mixing of P1 with these NFAs. The lamellar distances for P1:TOCR1 and P1:TOCR2 are approximately 1.76 nm and 1.712, respectively.
The π–π stacking distances for P1:TOCR1 and P2:TOCR2 are about 0.365 and 0.356 nm, correspondingly.
For P1:TOCR1 and P1:TOCR2, the crystal coherence length (CCL) for the π–π stacking is about 7.40 and 8.43 nm, respectively.
The large value of CCL and small value of π–π stacking distance for P1:TOCR2 is helpful for charge transport in the active layer toward the electrodes, resulting in increased JSC and FF for P1:TOCR2 based OSCs.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to examine the morphology of the blended films, P1:TOCR1 and P1:TOCR2, as illustrated in Fig. 6. It is well established that the phase separation in the BHJ active layer should not be either too large or small. It should be in the range of the exciton diffusion length (15–20 nm) for efficient exciton dissociation as well as charge transport. The phase separation in both films, P1:TOCR1 and P1:TOCR2, is moderate (5–10 nm for P1:TOCR1), but it is increased in the P1:TOCR2 film (10–20 nm), as observed in the TEM pictures. The P1:TOCR2 film's better phase separation morphology can aid exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in increased JSC and FF for OSCs.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized two new A–D–A′–D–A non-fullerene acceptors incorporating 3,5-bis((trifluoromethyl)phenyl) as the N-substituent into the 2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole core (A′) and 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b]3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) as donor units with two different terminal units, tricyanoethylene (TOCR1) and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yldene)malononitrile (TOCR2).

TOCR1 has a greater bandgap (1.64 eV) than TOCR2 because the stronger electron-withdrawing tricyanoethylene end-capping group shifts down both the HOMO and, to a lesser extent, the LUMO levels (1.57 eV). Because of the highly effective charge transfer and intermolecular interactions, the more prolonged conjugation of TOCR2 has a bathochromic shift of the light absorption with a maximum at 836 nm and an absorption edge approaching 1000 nm in the film.
Due to a low HOMO offset between TOCR2 and P2, which hampered exciton dissociation and hole transfer from TOCR2 to P2, binary devices based on P1:TOCR2 showed a high efficiency of 15.17 percent with a good JSC = 24.22 mA cm−2 and energy loss as low as 0.42 eV. Finally, the integration of 3,5-bis((trifluoromethyl)phenyl) as an N-substituent into the 2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole core opens the door to new near-IR absorbers for efficient non-fullerene acceptors in organic solar cells, according to this research.
