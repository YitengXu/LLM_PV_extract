Broader context
Conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) have recently found great attention. Herein a wide range of synthetic strategies that have allowed for this class of materials to slowly emerge within applications that include gas separation and storage, catalysis and light harvesting, energy storage and conversion is discussed. In this perspective it is the aim to present and discuss current and potential future applications within energy related fields, including recent developments and challenges, and compare to related materials such as covalent organic frameworks and polymers with intrinsic microporosity. With a better physicochemical understanding of CPPs and control of both electronic and morphological aspects, these materials are steadily surfacing as a new class of polymers by their own merit.

1. Introduction
The tremendously growing demand for energy throughout the world has addressed great emphasis on exploring clean and renewable energy resources. One long-term solution, which has attracted enormous attention in the last few years, is harvesting energy directly from sunlight using photovoltaic technology. Since it was discovered in 1970 that polyacetylene can be rendered electrochemically conductive,1–3 polymeric photovoltaic cells (PVCs)4–7 have become a promising alternative to silica due to the easy fabrication onto large areas of flexible substrates and the possibility of solution-processing at low cost.8,9 Due to their beneficial optical and electrochemical properties, linear conjugated polymers also have attracted much attention in other application fields such as polymeric light emitting diodes (PLEDs)10 and polymeric field effect transistors (PFETs).11 Among the applications, high grade light emitting diodes with very high efficiencies and considerably long life times are already commercially available.12
Recently, conjugated porous polymers (CPPs), i.e. organic semiconductors with additional porosity in the nano-range, have attracted much attention. There are several classes of organic polymers with micro- and mesopores. Apart from classic hyper-crosslinked polymers (HCPs),13–16 there are also polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs),17–19 and covalent organic frameworks (COFs).20,21 According to morphological aspects, conjugated porous polymers can also be classified as amorphous (HCPs and PIMs) or crystalline (COFs). These materials have been widely studied in areas such as gas separation22 and gas storage,14,15,22,23 taking advantage of their high surface areas and porosity. More recently, conjugated polymer networks have also started to find application as heterogeneous catalysts.24,25
Whenever an interface reaction contributes to the performance of a material (e.g. in adsorption or heterogeneous catalysis), porosity plays a primary role. Then, not only micropore structure and the specific surface area, but also pore accessibility, pore percolation and connectivity are mandatory to control. A possibly maximal surface area is required for applications such as gas storage, whereas the pore size is rather more important for creating molecular selectivity, such as in gas separation. In heterogeneous catalysis, where the reactions are carried out on the interface between the media and the porous materials, both the large surface area of the polymeric network for reaction transfer as well as accessibility to the interfaces for sufficient kinetics are of relevance. The latter is usually accomplished by implementation of a hierarchical pore structure. For ‘soft’ materials such as porous polymer networks, the stability of the micropores is a critical issue, where a rigid structure in the dry state is preferred.
Conjugated porous polymers (CPPs), if well “bred” (designed), are expected to inherit the beneficial characteristics of both sides. They possess some advantages of “conventional” conjugated polymers, with extended π-systems where the electronic levels can be controlled rendering materials that are semiconducting. On the other hand, given the distinct morphological properties of CPPs, other applications such as gas storage and conversion, porous electrodes, catalysis, etc. can be envisaged. In this perspective article, it is our goal to introduce to the reader the concept of conjugated porous polymers along with their current and potential energy applications. For other extended reviews on related materials, we can point to the thorough reports of Cooper, Thomas and Adams et al.26–29
2. Synthetic strategy towards conjugated porous polymers
The main challenge for synthetic chemists remains in the design of a simple and high yielding synthetic route where control over defined structure and surface area in CPPs is made possible in order to maximize the performance of these networks in various applications. This includes perfected control over the molecular dimension, i.e. linkage efficiency, as well as the architectural dimension to set up the topology of the network.
To date, a large diversity of synthetic methodologies to prepare CPPs has been developed. A widely used method is the polycondensation reaction, which can be classified under non-metal-catalyzed condensation reactions such as amidation,30 benzodioxane formation,17 boronate ester formation,20,31 boroxine formation,20 imidization,30 and nitrile cyclization;32 or metal-catalyzed Friedel–Crafts alkylation,33–35 Suzuki-,36 Sonogashira–Hagihara cross-coupling,37–39 Glaser-coupling,40 Yamamoto coupling,41,42 or oxidative polymerization,43 electrochemical polymerization,44 and metal-free Friedel–Crafts polycondensation,45 Lewis acid assisted cyclotrimerization46 and thermal polycondensation.47 We summarize in Table 1 examples of these synthetic methods.

Compared to the aggressive reaction conditions of employing molten ZnCl2 for triazine networks,32,48 or using strong Lewis acids such as FeCl3 for hyper-cross-linked polymer networks,15,33 metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are carried out under relatively mild reaction conditions. These synthetic strategies offer a wide range of possibilities when designing polymer networks with specific properties.
The first example of fully π-conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) exhibiting high surface areas in the dry state was reported by Cooper and coworkers in 2007.49 The polymers synthesized via palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling consisted of poly(aryleneethynylene) and showed Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas up to 834 m2 g−1. Thomas and co-workers reported soon after microporous conjugated networks based on spirobifluorene using a Yamamoto cross-coupling reaction, exhibiting surface areas larger than 1000 m2 g−1.42Via the homo-coupling of 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene and 1,4-diethynylbenzene, several CMPs were also obtained, with BET surface areas of up to 842 m2 g−1.40 A novel dye (2,3,5,6-tetraphenylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (DPP)) has been introduced into a series of conjugated networks using palladium-catalyzed Yamamoto– and Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling.50 In another report, from the group of Skabara et al., the same tetra-functional DPP building block was incorporated into cross-linked polymer thin films via electropolymerization.44 Although the polymers are highly cross-linked, due to the low number of instrumental techniques for surface area measurements of polymeric films, it was not possible to study their porosity. However, the main advantage of electrochemically deposited materials is that a direct study of the network's energy levels, including HOMO–LUMO band-gaps, can be carried out via cyclic voltammetry.
2.1 Control of surface area and pore size distribution
Cooper and coworkers showed that surface area and pore size distribution in CMPs can be controlled synthetically by using comonomers with different strut lengths.38 It was shown that the CMP with the shortest strut length exhibited the highest BET surface area of 1018 m2 g−1. In comparison, the CMP with the longest strut length showed the lowest BET surface area of 512 m2 g−1.
Jiang et al. reported on another series of CMPs based on triarylamine, using a similar synthetic approach to the first reported CMPs.51 The polymer networks showed large BET surface areas in the range from 546 to 1108 m2 g−1. It was also shown that with increasing size of the comonomers larger pores are obtained and therefore decreasing BET surface areas. The effect of the chosen reaction solvent on surface area was also studied. Jiang et al. showed that CMPs obtained using dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent produce materials with larger surface areas than those synthesized in toluene. Kiskan and Weber also showed that the base used in Sonogashira–Hagihara reactions also leads to different BET surface areas. By using diisopropylamine instead of triethylamine, the surface area can be increased.52
2.2 Controlling other physical properties
A report from Dawson et al. showed that control over physical properties such as hydrophobicity can be achieved by selection of the monomer, which allows incorporation of functional groups on the surface of the networks.53 An additional study in the report also showed that the dye sorption behavior of this type of network can be controlled by the hydrophobicity. This can offer a very useful synthetic strategy to control the selectivity for applications such as catalysis and gas separation.
2.3 Synthetic post-modification of CMPs
Recently, Kiskan and Weber reported the first example of post-modification of CMPs via radical thiol–yne chemistry.52 They demonstrated that the degree of functionalization could be controlled by varying the reacted amount of thiol, with microporosity being preserved within a certain range. Fig. 1 displays the synthetic strategy of the post-modification of the CMPs.

It was also shown, that due to the additional material grafted onto the pores, a decrease of the pore size was observed. However, it is possible that because of the excess of the thiol reactant used in the post-modification process, the CMPs may not remain fully conjugated. The authors also demonstrated that the surface area of the polymer networks can be increased by using a freeze–dry technique. In a very recent report, the same research group presented CMPs based on a phenolphthalein building block, where the ring opening and closing are switchable upon changes in pH values.54 Under basic conditions, the lacton ring within the phenolphthalein is opened to form a more polar quinonic structure.
Jiang and coworkers reported in a recent paper on pore surface engineering in a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Their strategy required the impregnation of functional groups such as azide units onto the walls of the COF pores, which can then undergo click chemistry with alkynes on the pore surface with desired groups and preferred densities.31Fig. 2 displays the synthetic strategy of the pore surface functionalization.

A tendency of decreasing BET surface areas and pore volumes was shown for the series of Trz-COF-5 by introducing additional groups onto the wall of the pores. This strategy presents a valuable way to control pore size and functionality and can potentially be applied to CPPs.
3. Applications of conjugated porous polymers for energy
One of the most promising applications of conjugated porous polymers in perspective is energy generation, conversion and storage. Energy conversion with conjugated polymers usually works via the harvesting of photons, i.e. we use the semiconductor structure to turn light into energy rich electron–hole pairs, which are then turned either into an electric current (photovoltaics) or into chemical storage molecules (photosynthesis). For energy storage, there are two ways: one is the storage of energy molecules in the pores, such as hydrogen or methane gas and the second way is indirect, where energy is transferred into chemical bonds within the porous polymers, i.e. a battery-type storage mode. Energy can also be stored in secondary valences or structural rearrangements within the pores, e.g. a compressed double layer, as it is the base of supercapacitors.
3.1 Gas storage of conjugated porous polymers
In this section we only briefly describe and compare CPPs for gas storage. For a more comprehensive view of gas storage using CMPs we refer to the review of Dawson et al.55 The gas sorption capacity of conjugated porous materials is effectively comparable with classical porous materials such as zeolites, MOFs or active carbons. In terms of energy applications, direct storage of energy carriers such as hydrogen or methane is of great interest. Budd and McKeown et al. reported the H2 uptake properties using PIMs.56,57 The PIM with the highest BET surface area (1050 m2 g−1) achieved, as expected, the highest H2 uptake (1.62 wt%) at 1 bar at 77 K, whereas the H2 uptake (2.71 wt%) can be increased at a higher pressure of 10 bar. H2 storage capacity of CMPs based on poly(aryleneethynylene) was studied by Cooper and coworkers.58 Similar to the H2 uptake properties of PIMs, the CMP with the largest BET surface area (1018 m2 g−1) shows the largest H2 storage capacity (1.4 wt%). These researchers also successfully incorporated Pd nanoparticles via the infusion of supercritical CO2-soluble Pd precursors, leading to an increase of H2 uptake from 0.006 wt% for the non-Pd-incorporated CMP to 0.069 wt% at 293.3 K and 1.13 bar. However, at ambient temperature, all these H2 uptake capacities are still too low for practical use.
Although there seems to be some correlation between surface area and hydrogen uptake, other factors need to be considered and are material dependent. For instance, Deng and coworkers incorporated lithium onto the homo-coupled CMP based on 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene reported by Jiang et al.,40 showing an increased hydrogen adsorption of 1.6 wt% for the non-doped CMP to 6.1 wt% for the Li-doped polymer network at 77 K and 1 bar.59
The physisorption of methane gas in organic porous materials has been studied less often than hydrogen storage. The highest methane adsorption of 11.7 mmol g−1 (116 v/v) for COFs was reported by Furukawa and Yaghi,60 and 220 v/v for MOFs61 at 290 K and 35 bar. Cooper and coworkers synthesized microporous HCPs based on poly(p-dichloroxylene), which show methane uptakes up to 5.2 mmol g−1 at 20 bar and 298 K.62 Ben et al. reported on a porous aromatic framework PAF-1 with an apparent surface area of 7100 m2 g−1. PAF-1 also shows highly thermal and hydrothermal stabilities with high uptake capacities for hydrogen (10.7 wt% at 77 K, 48 bar) and carbon dioxide (1300 mg g−1 at 298 K, 40 bar).63 We assume that this represents the polymer system with the highest useful surface area, so far.
Besides improving material design for achieving a higher surface area or pore volume, the increase in the affinity of the surface of the porous polymers for gas molecules is another aspect of synthetic chemistry. Incorporation of functional groups onto the porous polymers offers a useful strategy. In a recent report, carbon dioxide uptake properties of a series of CMPs are described by Cooper and coworkers.24 The CMPs were incorporated with a range of chemical functionalities. The authors pointed out that at lower pressure (1 bar), the CO2 uptake depends more on the binding energy caused by functional groups rather than the absolute surface area. It was shown, that the isosteric heats of the functional groups range in the following order: –COOH > (OH)2 > NH2 > H > (CH3)2.
3.2 Conjugated porous polymer networks for energy storage molecule production
Another big application of CMPs (with the size of a complete research field) lies in the conversion of energy from sunlight into fuel molecules, or colloquially “artificial photosynthesis”. This complements the classical, well developed use of conjugated polymers in organic photovoltaics, with a slight twist of the underlying physicochemical problems bringing not only advantages but also new chemical problems to resolve.
Photovoltaics is of course very useful, but its broad societal use is restricted by the fact that electric current is produced at times and places when and where it is usually not needed, i.e. it has to be transported and stored on the largest scale. Nowadays, photovoltaic energy parks still need a full backup of fossil power plants, making the whole grid construction suboptimal. Nature of course had the same problem of solar light usage and “decided” for photosynthesis of energy carriers, i.e. sunlight is converted into chemical storage molecules, which can be used whenever needed. In addition, the conversion of sunlight into molecules is a very local phenomenon (with an overall system size in the 100 nm region), that is, long range perfection and homogeneity mandatory for a PV panel are not needed, electric current does not need to be collected, but is consumed on the molecular scale, and the overall device engineering problem is much less. This presumably translates into the fact that “photosynthetic panels” are also much simpler and much cheaper to fabricate, which would solve the second big problem of photovoltaics as such, namely that at the current level it usually hardly pays off.
The so-called solar fuels, in which energy is stored directly in chemical bonds using photocatalysts, represent therefore a very attractive solution for sustainable energy. Solar fuels can be simply produced in the form of hydrogen, using photo-initiated water splitting, or in carbon compounds such as formic acid, formaldehyde, or methanol, which are the direct electroreduction products of CO2. The energy in solar fuels can be stored in a dense and long-lived fashion, with all techniques turning fuels into energy being already available at all scales. In the past three decades, a vast number of inorganic semiconductors and molecular assemblies have been developed as catalysts for hydrogen production, using UV or even visible light.64 The studies mainly addressed metal oxides, sulfides, or nitrides, which are mainly based on precious metals with d0 and d10 electron configurations.65–71 In nature, metal-based complexes can be found in enzymes as active centers for photocatalyzing the decomposition of water, but the overall system is rather a biopolymer structure than an inorganic semiconductor.
To produce hydrogen from water, the endothermic character of the water-splitting reaction has to be overcome. The theoretically required energy to produce hydrogen from water is calculated in eqn (1) and (2): 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−, +0.82 V(1) 2H+ + 2e− → H2, −0.41 V(2)Eqn (1) and (2) comply with the redox potentials converted to NHE reference at pH 7.72 The energy necessary for the catalyst to overcome the band gap for hydrogen production requires 1.23 V. As some of the intermediates of the 4-electron transfer are higher in energy, a certain “inherent overpotential” has to be considered, which makes photons with around 1.8 eV energy (or higher) practically suitable for this reaction. This corresponds to a light wavelength of 690 nm and shorter.
To run photosplitting of water with a CPP, the band gap of the structure has consequently to be larger than this value. As light absorption is accompanied with a number of instantaneous molecular relaxations, as a rule of thumb the fluorescence wavelength can be taken as a measure for the energy available for the reaction. In addition, the band gap has however been placed in a way that the photo-generated hole has enough oxidation strength to oxidize water to O2, while the photo-generated electron has to be reductive enough to reduce water to H2, i.e. the HOMO–LUMO band positions have to “engulf” the redox potential of water. This is graphically illustrated in Fig. 3 with the calculated band positions of carbon nitride, a polymeric organic semiconductor, which is able to run both half reactions independently.
 Fig. 3  Density-functional-theory band structure for polymeric melon calculated along the chain (Γ–χ direction) and perpendicular to the chain (γ–Γ direction). The position of the reduction level for H+ to H2 is indicated by the dashed blue line and the oxidation potential of H2O to O2 is indicated by the red dashed line just above the valence band. Reprinted with permission from ref. 47. 
This type of engulfing is a rare case and implies for instance that the conjugated organic polymers are stable against oxygen and water, which is rare again. Nevertheless, there are often cases where the easier, “upper” hydrogen reaction is photochemically activated.
Conjugated polymers such as polyparaphenylene have been used for hydrogen production.73 However, only ultraviolet light could initiate the water splitting activity, and the performance is moderate. Under irradiation a quick decomposition of the polymer took place, which of course is due to the sensitivity of the photogenerated carbo-cation hole, which then can undergo further reactions. In terms of Fig. 3, the LUMO is very high and can of course drive the hydrogen generation, but also the HOMO is on the non-noble side, which created chemical sensitivity.
This is why experiments with traditional PV polymers in full contact with water, air, and other redox chemicals are essentially hopeless. However, organic chemistry of PV polymers has made in recent years remarkable progress, also along the stability issue, which nowadays allows to reconsider the question of an “energy photochemistry” with such structures. As photochemistry is inherently a heterogeneous reaction where an electron and a hole are transferred to an organic molecule strongly adsorbed onto the surface, it is clear that the conjugated polymers should possess in addition a high specific surface area, i.e. a valuable solution is most probably found in the class of CPPs based on modern, oxidation stable repeat units.

3.2.1 Metal-free conjugated polymer networks for photo-initiated hydrogen production. 
In the past few years, significant improvements towards organic, stable and metal-free photocatalysts have been observed. Wang and coworkers reported on a cross-linked graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) polymeric semiconductor, which has been developed as a photocatalyst for the water splitting.47 The material has been prepared using thermal bulk polycondensation of cyanamide. It was shown that the carbon nitride (Fig. 4A) based polymer network can produce hydrogen from water under visible-light. Compared to other conducting polymer semiconductors, carbon nitride is chemically and thermally stable. For this application, complicated device manufacturing is not required, as the reaction was carried out as a powder dispersion. From the UV/vis spectra (Fig. 4B) an optical band gap of 2.7 eV can be derived, which is compatible with the water-splitting reaction.

Fig. 5 displays a comparison of the energy levels of g-C3N4 and titanium dioxide (TiO2) towards water splitting energy.74 The conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 is positioned at −1.3 eV and the valence band at +1.4 eV, compared to TiO2, g-C3N4 exhibits higher HOMO and LUMO levels, and a lower bandgap of 2.7 eV (Eg(TiO2) = 3.2 eV). This encompasses the appropriate potential for oxidation and reduction of water, whereas straight titanium does not have enough reduction strength to liberate hydrogen.

Fig. 6 shows the hydrogen production rate from water driven by visible light (0.1–4 μmol h−1). The deposition of a small amount of platinum particles on the surface increases the H2 evolution activity by a factor of seven.

As melem is trifunctional, carbon nitride is inherently cross-linked, but cannot be considered porous. The surface area had to be increased via templating techniques, e.g. by adding silica nanoparticles.75 Removal of the silica template yields mesoporous carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) with surface areas up to 450 m2 g−1. Wang et al. showed in another report a significant improvement of the mesoporous mpg-C3N4 in the activity of H2 evolution by a factor of eight compared to g-C3N4.76 It is worth noting that the porous material with the largest surface area does not necessarily provide the highest H2 evolution activity. This presumably indicates a change of the semiconductor properties with increasing porosity and a shrink of wall thickness to the lower nanometer range.
Schwab et al. synthesized a series of fully conjugated poly(azomethine) networks via polycondensation between aromatic amines and aldehydes, exhibiting H2 evolution activities up to 7 μmol h−1.77
Wang and coworkers introduced another polymer tool to improve the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of carbon nitride by employing new comonomers with desired compositions and electronic structures into the conjugated polymer network of g-C3N4.78 For instance, 2-aminobenzonitrile (ABN) was incorporated into the conjugated networks in different amounts. Compared to g-C3N4, the ABN-doped networks (CN–ABNx) achieved higher H2 evolution rates up to 147 μmol h−1. Using silica nanoparticles as a template, mesoporous CN–ABNs could be synthesized, showing large H2 evolution rate improvements of up to 229 μmol h−1.
Further progress is however eagerly needed, especially concerning the fact that carbon nitrides only utilize blue photons with a wavelength below 460 nm. We strongly believe that CMPs based on other stable repeat motifs will extend the adsorption behavior over the maximum of solar radiation in the green region and allow photosynthesis also in this range of the spectrum.


3.2.2 CMPs for catalysis. 
The catalytical activity of porous materials has been known for many years such as using porous resin as catalyst supports. Bradley and Sherrington et al. discussed the applications in this field of classical porous materials in two reviews.79,80 A recent review on the new generation of porous organic polymers used for catalysis described the research activities and challenges within this field.81
Thomas and coworkers reported on the activity of mesoporous carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) as a metal-free catalyst for Friedel–Crafts acylation of benzene with hexanoyl chloride.75 The researchers found out that with increasing surface areas the catalytical activity of mpg-C3N4 also increased; the maximum of the reaction conversion (90%) was only obtained by the polymer with a surface area of 86 m2 g−1. This indicates the same defects effect in the material similar to the influence of the surface area of carbon nitride on the photocatalytical activity of H2 evolution reported by Wang et al.76 Chen et al. reported on porous Fe-loaded g-C3N4 with photocatalytical activity in the conversion of benzene into phenol via the activation of hydrogen peroxide under visible light.82 A comprehensive review on polymeric mesoporous carbon nitride was recently published.83
Schüth reported on the catalytical activity of platinum-attached porous polymer frameworks based on triazine,84 which was first reported by Thomas et al.32 As shown in Fig. 7, the network containing platinum exhibits high activity for oxidation of methane to methanol. It can be separated easily from the reaction mixture and recycled several times without significant loss of activity.

It is worth mentioning that this special CMP survived easily the harsh conditions of a Periana reaction, i.e. foaming sulfuric acid at 250 °C in the presence of oxygen. Under those conditions, not only methane but also any alternative catalyst support is oxidized, illustrating the power of “CMP band gap engineering”, making the HOMO of the scaffold so low that oxidation is thermodynamically unfavorable.
Jiang and coworkers recently reported on conjugated micro- and mesoporous metalloporphyrin-based polymer networks with large BET surface areas up to 1270 m2 g−1.85 As shown in Fig. 8, the networks consisting of an iron porphyrin complex can be used for oxidation of thioanisole to sulfoxide with high selectivities of up to 99% and high conversions of 98%.

A current report of Cooper et al. demonstrated the reductive amination catalyzed by metal–organic conjugated microporous polymers.25Fig. 9 illustrates an example of the amination of ketones catalyzed by the iridium-incorporated CMP, achieving high yields of up to 95%.
 Fig. 9  Reductive amination of ketones catalyzed by iridium-incorporated CMP.25 
Lin and coworkers described a series of highly porous cross-linked chiral polymer networks based on 1,10-binaphthyl building blocks via homo-coupling of terminal alkyne groups (Fig. 10).86 The microporous polymer networks exhibit BET surface areas up to 974 m2 g−1; after complexing with titanium they show catalytical activity for asymmetric diethylzinc addition to aldehydes. The enantioselectivity of these reactions is modest to good (55 to 81 e.e.%).
 Fig. 10  Microporous 1,10-binaphthyl-based polymer networks used as a catalyst for enantioselective addition of aldehydes.86 
The CMPs based on switchable phenolphthalein units reported by Weber et al. showed photocatalytical activities.54 In particular, the alkaline salts of these networks can be used as a photoinitiator for heterogeneous photopolymerization of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), achieving a number-average molecular weight of Mn = 138000 g mol−1. This means that the photogenerated radical cation onto this CMP is strong enough to oxidize the amine initiator, which the redox cycle closed after polymerization. For dye-sensitized photopolymerizations, the insoluble CMPs can be a better alternative as a heterogeneous initiator to be separated easily by filtration.


3.2.3 Light harvesting CMPs. 
Special properties of conjugated linear properties such as light harvesting can also be found in CMPs, combined with high surface area and microporosity. Jiang et al. reported recently on a polyphenylene-based CMP with light-harvesting properties.87 The CMP itself showed blue luminescence at 443 nm. In the presence of a dye (Coumarin 6) that can diffuse into the pores of the polymer network energy transfer from the network to the dye is observed when exciting the CMP at 363 nm resulting in the emission of Coumarin 6 at 512 nm (Fig. 11).

3.2.4 CMPs as supercapacitors. 
One of the recent highlights of conjugated porous polymers towards applications was reported by Jiang and coworkers.88 These researchers demonstrated that the aza-fused conjugated microporous networks (Aza-CMPs) exhibit an excellent life cycle during the charge and discharge tests. Furthermore, the Ragone plot (Fig. 12) reveals that Aza-CMPs exhibit the maximum energy and power density of 53 W h kg−1, which is already comparable to that of nickel–metal hydride batteries.89

4. Conclusions and outlook
The field of conjugated porous polymers has shown significant advances. Scientists are currently switching their focus from simple and effective synthetic methods of conjugated porous materials towards applications which are mostly energy related. Since CPPs possess in many ways similar properties (organic structure, conductivity and well defined energetic levels) as classical π-conjugated polymers, we envisage that due to knowledge exchange between these fields, new opportunities arise when applying these polymers in separation technologies, gas and energy storage, as catalysts, photocatalysts, and ultimately as artificial enzymes. Indeed there has been some progress in these directions as mentioned previously. However, several advances need to be made in order for these systems to be efficient and able to compete outstandingly with other well-developed materials. Among these challenges we consider the following of paramount importance:
A. Energetic control
So far, and with very few exceptions,44 there are no significant advances on how to control the energetic levels of this class of conjugated and semiconducting materials. For applications in energy storage and conversion as well as catalysis and photocatalysis, it is mandatory to fully understand the positioning of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs). Indeed, in a specific field, such as photovoltaics, the mismatch of these energetic levels within a device and in-between the several components that make up the device leads to none or, at its best, low efficiencies. Having a robust and clear method or technology that allows to pin point their HOMO and LUMO levels will come as a major progress for these materials.
B. Processability and device integration
If on one hand the porosity and high surface areas pose great advantages for these materials, on the other hand this comes as a cost in terms of solubility and ultimately processability. In general and with the exception of PIMs, these materials once made are insoluble and are therefore difficult to apply. So far only little synthetic efforts have been made in order to produce conjugated polymers in the form of nanoparticles,90,91 which could provide a valid solution to this problem. This would allow for stable dispersions to be formulated and used. Robustness: one major issue of these polymers is related to robustness under mechanical and chemical stress. Chemically, CPPs are often stable, however the presence of e.g. ethenyl groups in many of these polymer frameworks may easily drive side reactions.
C. Water and biocompatibility
Finally and when attempting to compare these systems with enzymes in terms of (photo)catalysis (with active catalytic centers within the pores) one needs to address the issue of water wettability and biocompatibility. In general, these materials possess no water acceptance or biocompatible behavior, which ultimately is detrimental for high performance in applications in many topical fields as are bioelectronics or water-splitting. Introducing water and bio-compatible groups within the polymer formulation can deny the conjugation and therefore conductivity of the polymer. Post-modification strategies (also discussed) on the other hand can be seen as a route towards achieving this goal.
Nevertheless, and as the field matures, CPPs have gained importance and are in our perspective a very promising class of materials that potentially can advance many aforementioned energy applications significantly.

Broader context
Conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) have recently found great attention. Herein a wide range of synthetic strategies that have allowed for this class of materials to slowly emerge within applications that include gas separation and storage, catalysis and light harvesting, energy storage and conversion is discussed. In this perspective it is the aim to present and discuss current and potential future applications within energy related fields, including recent developments and challenges, and compare to related materials such as covalent organic frameworks and polymers with intrinsic microporosity. With a better physicochemical understanding of CPPs and control of both electronic and morphological aspects, these materials are steadily surfacing as a new class of polymers by their own merit.
