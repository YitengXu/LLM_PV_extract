    , Accepted 5th August 2019First published on 9th August 2019AbstractRecently, tunable high absorptance from various nanophotonic structures has been demonstrated. However, most of these structures require nano-lithography, which is expensive and slow. Lithography-free tuneable absorbers are rarely explored for tuneable visible and near-infrared photonics. Herein, we demonstrate a gold (Au)/chalcogenide dual-layer that is resonantly coupled to Au nanoparticles (NPs). The structure exhibits angle and polarisation-independent high absorptance. At resonance, waveguide cavity-like modes are excited between the film and NPs whilst gap plasmon modes are excited between the NPs. Coalescence of the waveguide cavity-like modes, the gap plasmon modes, and the highly absorbing chalcogenide semiconductor not only leads to perfect absorptance but also a reconfigurable response via reversible structural phase transitions in the chalcogenide film. In the amorphous state, the design provides nearly perfect absorptance for both p- and s-polarisation states at an incident angle of 20°. However, after switching to the crystalline state, the peak absorptance spectrally broadens and redshifts from 980 to 1520 nm. This experimental observation was theoretically validated by the finite element method. Thermal-electric modeling was performed to show that the structural transition from crystalline to amorphous states is possible in just 5 ns, thus allowing high-speed reconfigurable perfect absorbers.
1. Introduction
Controlling light absorption is the cornerstone of subwavelength structures for photodetection,1 photo-thermal conversion,2,3 sensing,4,5 radiative cooling,6 and energy harvesting7,8 applications. Mainly, perfect absorbers operating across a broad frequency range are desirable for thin-film solar cells, thermal emitters, and photodetectors. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to achieve nearly ideal absorptance across the visible (VIS), infrared, and microwave spectral bands. In particular, plasmonic nanostructures and metasurfaces can provide narrowband resonances of electromagnetic (EM) waves.9–14 Note that there are numerous applications where frequency selectivity of peak absorptance is desirable. However, the optical response from the abovementioned plasmonic structures is fixed and determined at fabrication by the materials selected and their geometric profile.
In order to enable post-fabrication optical tunability, a number of different approaches have been explored over the past decade. For example, by incorporating active materials, such as liquid crystals,15 graphene,16,17 dye molecules18 and vanadium dioxide,19–21 into the plasmonic structures, the optical response of the system can be tuned using electric fields and temperature. Upon such external stimuli, the peak absorptance can be spectrally tuned. Note that in these systems the incident optical energy is converted into heat by electrical absorption in the metallic elements of the absorber. However, photovoltaics cannot exploit this same optical absorption effect as, ideally, each incident photon should be converted into an electron–hole pair—not phonons.
Recently, the prototype chalcogenide phase change semiconductor material, Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), has shown promise for tuning photonic devices.22–40 Wideband tuning of plasmon resonances has been demonstrated using a 50 nm thick GST film integrated with plasmonic nanostructures.41,42 This pronounced tuning phenomenon originates from the sensitivity of plasmon resonances to the dielectric constant of the surrounding GST. Indeed, we chose GST as the surrounding active material since its dielectric constant exhibits an enormous reversible change between its amorphous and crystalline structural phases. The phase transition can be realised via optical43 or electrical44 pulsed heating. GST is also interesting because it crystallises in just 500 ps, it is highly scalable, and structural phase transitions are non-volatile, i.e., the switched optical state is retained without constant energy supply. Energy is only used during the switching process.45,46 Thus phase transitions are a ‘greener’ choice than other tuning mechanisms.42
Fabricating nanosized resonators is time-consuming and low-throughput, and requires costly nano-lithography techniques. These problems hinder their technological application in visible and near-infrared (NIR) photonics. Very recently, broadband near-perfect absorbers have been investigated in the visible spectrum using lithography-free stacked multilayer structures.47 In these devices, the GST semiconductor layer was placed between the bottom and top SiO248 or metal34,49 thin-film reflectors. Thus a Fabry–Perot optical cavity was created where the EM wave was efficiently absorbed by the GST layer. The enhanced absorptance in the structure was due to the substantial interference effects between the multiple reflected light beams.50 However, these perfect absorbers were not spectrally tunable. Realising a tunable absorber in the NIR region has far-reaching consequences for chip-based optical devices, active modulators, sensors, and filters.
Metallic nanoparticles (NPs) can be synthesized at a low cost and self-assembled to create nanostructured surfaces.51 Extensive studies have been performed on the metallic NPs since they exhibit localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs).52 However, pure and uncoupled metallic NPs neither efficiently enhance the optical fields nor exhibit a tuneable optical response.53 When NP resonators are coupled to other plasmonic structures, the EM field shows a pronounced enhancement54,55 with a resonance that can be tuned across a wide spectral band.56 For example, distributing metallic NPs on a dielectric film, which is in turn deposited on a metal surface, creates gap plasmons. The dielectric film thickness is easily fabricated with nanometer accuracy, thus allowing exquisite control of the gap plasmon field-enhancement and other plasmonic effects.57–64 In this work, we show that clusters of chemically deposited gold (Au) NPs positioned over a GST/Au dual-layered structure generate a highly tuneable shift of the absorptance peak, which has an absorptance of 98.0%. The absorptance peak is in the NIR spectral region, and is tuned by switching the GST between its amorphous and crystalline structural phases. The strong absorptance is independent of the incident angle and the light's polarisation state. The simulated spectra agree well with the measured spectra. The simulations show that the excitation of magnetic resonances between the metal creates a strong magnetic dipolar moment thus enhancing the light absorptance. To show that the absorptance spectra can be switched in just 5 ns, we developed a coupled heat-transfer model using the finite element method (FEM).
Compared to top-down nanofabrication techniques, our conformal solution-based assembly processing approach did not use any lithographic patterns. Hence the device area can be scaled up, whilst the gap plasmon generating thin film layer provides a fine control over the plasmonic resonances. Our experimental illustration together with a theoretical framework lays the foundation for rapidly reconfigurable optical switches, thermal imaging devices, optical modulators, thermal emitters, and so on.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) illustrates the proposed reconfigurable absorber. It has a GST semiconductor interlayer placed between a cluster of Au NPs and a Au bottom mirror. A 100 nm thick Au layer is first deposited onto a silicon (Si) substrate by Radio Frequency (RF) sputtering a gold target. The planar Au layer is used to prevent light transmission through the structure, while also interacting with the top Au NPs to create loops of displacement current (JD). These JD loops lead to the strong magnetic dipolar resonances. Our early work showed that such a design efficiently couples the incident light to the absorber.42 A 35 nm thick GST film is subsequently RF sputtered onto the bottom Au layer from a GST alloy target. A Si3N4 barrier layer with a thickness of 5 nm is deposited directly onto the GST layer to prevent interlayer diffusion and interfacial reactions while protecting the GST layer from oxidation.65 Finally, a cluster of Au NPs is deposited from a colloidal solution onto the Si3N4 laminate. It is these NPs that can excite the LSPRs, which result in the strong electric dipolar moments.

The thicknesses of Si3N4, GST, and Au reflector are 5, 35, and 100 nm, respectively. The average diameter of the Au NPs is 50 nm.

(c) The ellipsometry measured the complex refractive index of the 35 nm thick GST planar film for both the amorphous (denoted as AM) and crystalline (denoted as CR) states. (d) The measured (top panel) and calculated (bottom panel) A(ω) of the structures in both the amorphous (solid lines) and crystalline (dashed lines) states for p- (left column) and s- (right column) polarisations with θ = 20°. 
Our electromagnetic wave model, which is solved using the FEM algorithm within COMSOL, was used to optimize the thickness of each layer to obtain nearly perfect absorptance in the NIR spectral band. Fig. 1(b) presents a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of self-assembled Au NPs on the Si3N4/GST/Au multilayer structure. The Au NP diameter is normally distributed with a mean of 50 nm and a standard deviation of 1 nm (see the TEM image in the inset). The details of the fabrication process are given in the Methods section. Fig. 1(c) shows the complex refractive index (n = nGST + i × kGST) of the GST film for both the amorphous (blue line) and crystalline (red line) phases. The measurements were made by infrared variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) on a 35 nm thick GST film that was deposited on a Si substrate. The measured ellipsometry data were fitted by a Tauc–Lorentz model.40 The state of the as-deposited planar GST film was amorphous. To crystallise the GST film, we annealed the as-deposited amorphous GST film at a temperature of 453 K for 30 min on a hot plate under a flowing argon atmosphere. The melting temperature of GST is known to be TM = 873 K.27 The crystallised GST can be reamorphised by melt-quenching the lattice into the amorphous state. Therefore, to amorphise GST, it is usually heated above 873 K (ref. 29) by nanosecond laser or electric current pulses.66
It is evident from Fig. 1(c) that both nGST (solid lines) and kGST (dashed lines) significantly changed across the wavelength range from 400 to 2400 nm. This vast contrast of nGST between the two structural phases was induced by a change from covalent bonding in the amorphous phase to resonant bonding in the crystalline phase.67 The large imaginary part of the refractive index (kGST) is indicative of high optical absorptance. And we see, therefore, that the GST film is more absorbing in the crystalline state than in the amorphous state.
We measured the angular reflectance of the absorber using VASE. Frequency (ω) dependent reflectance (R(ω)) spectra were obtained for incident angles (θ) between 20° and 80°. The absorptance (A(ω)) spectra were derived from A(ω) = 1 − R(ω) − T(ω). The transmittance (T(ω)) of the structures was zero and this simplified the absorptance calculation to A(ω) = 1 − R(ω). The R(ω) of the structure for p- and s-polarised light at an incident angle of θ = 20° is shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† In the top panel of the left column of Fig. 1(d), we show the measured A(ω) for both the amorphous (solid blue line) and crystalline (dashed blue line) states under the p-polarised light incidence with θ = 20°. The phase change absorber has an absorption peak of A(ω) = 0.98 at λ1 = 980 nm for the amorphous phase. After crystallising the GST, the resonant peak spectrally redshifted to λ2 = 1520 nm, while maintaining a high absorptance peak of A(ω) = 0.92. Due to the broad spectral shift, our device has a large absorptance contrast of up to ΔA(ω) = 0.80 at λ2 = 1520 nm. The FEM simulated A(ω) spectra (bottom panel of the left column of Fig. 1(d)) agree with the measured spectra. In the model, the profiles of the Au NPs were defined by those measured using the TEM images (Fig. 1(b)). A detailed description of the theoretical model is given in the Methods section. In the right column of Fig. 1(d), we measured (top panel) and simulated (bottom panel) the A(ω) of the structure for both structural states under the s-polarised light incidence with θ = 20°. The absorber exhibits a central resonant peak for both p- and s-polarisation states, where the highest absorptance occurs at λ1 = 980 nm and θ = 20° for p-polarised light. The simulations validate the essential spectral features – a redshift of the resonant wavelength and a slight broadening of the resonant peak by crystallising the GST. It illustrates that the resonant wavelengths of the measured A(ω) match with those of the simulated A(ω). Such a strong agreement shows that our simulation is trustworthy, and can be used to further explore the underlying physics of the structure, or to make predictions and designs of new structures. In the numerical model, fabrication imperfections and surface roughness were assumed to be negligible, and these simplifications account for the small differences between the calculated and measured absorptance spectra. Also note that the reflectance spectra were measured in the far-field whereas the reflectance was calculated in the near field of the absorber, which also introduces differences between the calculation and experiment. Such a design can be applied to reconfigurable photonic devices where the high-quality factor resonance is not required.68 One application of this approach could be in infrared and visible identification tags and coding.69
As mentioned previously, the top Au NPs produce electric dipolar resonances while the bottom Au layer is used to eliminate optical transmission and establish strong magnetic resonances between the Au NPs and reflector. These resonances depended on the permittivity of the GST interlayer. Therefore, the GST semiconductor placed in between the Au layers plays a crucial role in modulating the resonant conditions for tunable high absorptance. To gain insight into the LSPR and the role of the GST film phase transition in controlling the A(ω) spectra, EM-field distributions at different resonant modes were numerically explored using FEM (COMSOL software). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the normalized total electric (E-) field intensity () and magnetic (H-) field intensity () under the p-polarised incident light with θ = 20°. The color indicates the magnitude of the EM-field intensity whilst the arrows show the JD. The field intensities relate to the absorptance of A(ω) = 0.98 at λ1 = 980 nm for the amorphous phase (Fig. 2a) and A(ω) = 0.92 at λ2 = 1520 nm for the crystalline phase (Fig. 2b) along a cross-sectional plane β (shown in Fig. 1a). The charge distribution appears not only at the interface between the Au NPs and Si3N4 layer, with two regions of intense E-field at either bottom side of the NPs associated with the waveguide cavity-like mode, but also in the gaps between the Au NPs, which is a gap plasmon mode. This enables the electric dipolar resonances to enhance the localised E-field efficiently. Another important characteristic of this resonance is that the charge distribution can lead to current loops between the Au NPs and the Au reflector (white arrows), which strongly enhances the H-field (right columns of Fig. 2a and b).42 Such a strong magnetic resonance was recently employed to create a metamaterial perfect absorber since impedance matching of the metamaterial and free space is possible. This allows the reflections to be eliminated and therefore increases the efficiency of light absorptance.70 Therefore, our proposed absorber simultaneously excites electric and magnetic resonances to enhance the localised EM-fields whilst minimising reflections. Both the E- and H-field intensities were stronger for the amorphous state (Fig. 2a) than for the crystalline state (Fig. 2b). Hence the amorphous phase produces higher magnitude and narrower bandwidth of the absorption peaks (Fig. 1d). In other words, the Q-factor of the resonator is higher for the amorphous phase. The lower Q-factor resonances of the crystalline phase are caused by the crystalline state's higher electrical conductivity, which ‘short circuits’ the dielectric layer and transfers energy out of the electric field in the form of Joule heat. Fig. S2 of the ESI† presents the E-field, H-field, and JD for the absorber under the s-polarised light incidence with θ = 20° for both amorphous and crystalline states. The corresponding simulated A(ω) and EM-field intensity distributions for Au NPs possessing a fluctuant surface are shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI,† respectively. As is seen, the modified model demonstrates that both the A(ω) spectra and EM-field distributions are very similar to the spherical Au NPs.

A key advantage of the proposed absorber is its omnidirectionality. For example, the absorber can maintain high absorptance over a wide range of incident angles. This is attributed to the fact that the plasmonic absorber is made of thin films and that the internal angle of refraction is small due to the high dielectric constant of the GST. Fig. 3a and b illustrate the measured absorptance as a function of the incident angle and wavelength for the p- and s-polarisation states, respectively. The incident angle was varied from 20° to 80° in steps of 5°. The GST was in the amorphous state. As can be seen, the absorber exhibited omnidirectional high absorptance under both polarisation states. For p-polarisation, the absorptance was above 85% for all the measured angles and wavelengths. For s-polarisation, the absorptance decreased at the higher frequencies and larger angles; even so, an absorptance greater than 70% was maintained up to θ = 60°. Fig. 3c and d show the measured angular dependent absorptance for the crystalline state. For p-polarisation, the maximum absorptance was 90% at θ = 50°. For s-polarisation, the peak absorptance was 85% at θ = 50°. Both the crystalline and amorphous phases show absorptance peaks with excellent spectral overlap between the p- and s-polarized light. Thus, the proposed absorber is polarisation independent across a broad incident angle. From the photo in Fig. 3e, we observe that the hybrid device based on the amorphous GST layer appears dark to the eyes. However, the color of the device becomes grey by transiting the GST state from amorphous to crystalline, as shown in the photo in Fig. 3f. It is because the crystallisation of GST redshifts the peak absorptances. The omnidirectional and polarisation-independent high absorptance in the VIS-NIR region deems the absorber particularly suitable for photovoltaic and photodetection applications. Fig. S4† shows a picture of the calculated frequency-dependent absorptance as a function of incident angle and wavelength for both amorphous and crystalline states with p- and s-polarisation states. The agreement between the experiment and simulation is clear for each of the GST states and light polarisation states, which confirms that our theoretical model may effectively capture the physics of the NPs coupled to the film system. In order to experimentally demonstrate the effect of the variation of Au NPs on the overall optical performance, we drop-cast the NPs with different mean diameters of 30 nm, 50 nm, and 70 nm, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. S5–S7 of the ESI,† the measured absorptances of the hybrid devices are almost independent with the change of the mean diameter of the Au NPs.

The GST semiconductor possesses two critical temperatures, one is the rocksalt crystallization temperature of TC = 433 K, and the other is the melting temperature of TM = 873 K. By varying the peak temperature and cooling rate, the state of the GST can be reversibly switched.71 Theoretically, amorphous GST can crystallise below TC but since crystallisation is a stochastic Arrhenius process and the crystallisation activation is relatively high at 2.3 eV,72 spontaneous crystallisation is extremely unlikely and the amorphous state is, therefore, considered stable for years. However, heating the GST between the TC and TM allows the material to crystallise in nanoseconds. Considering the relatively high crystallisation activation energy, the enormous change in crystallisation time over a relatively small temperature range presents the famous dichotomy of GST. Recently, the short crystallisation time of GST at relatively moderate temperatures was explained by the crystallisation activation energy becoming lower as crystallisation progresses. This effect leads to an “avalanche” crystallisation effect, thus allowing the material to be stable at room temperature yet crystallise in nanoseconds at slightly elevated temperatures.73
One can re-amorphise the GST (from crystalline to amorphous) by increasing the temperature above the TM. Estimating the minimum transition time of GST is useful for understanding the practical applications of these photonic devices. Recently, a number of studies have shown how to reduce the phase-transition below 100 ns by both optical70 and electrical74 heating methods, which may bring a new twist to realise real-time reconfigurable photonic devices. In Fig. 4, we used a heat-transfer model to study the temporal variation of the GST interlayer temperature in the NP-coupled film absorber at a voltage of Vg = 42 V. The two primary phase transitions of crystallisation and reamorphisation take place at different time scales and temperatures. Herein, we focused on the reversible switching of the absorptance spectra via electrically triggered reamorphisation of the GST film. The thermal and electric properties for GST, Au, and Si substrates, which we used in the model, are summarized in Table S1 of the ESI.†
 Fig. 4  (a) A time-dependent temperature distribution of a GST layer in Au NP-coupled Si3N4/GST/Au multilayers. To switch back the state, the crystalline GST must be annealed beyond the TM = 873 K which was achieved by Vg = 42 V. Subsequent quenching led to the GST with the melt-quenched amorphous state. CR and MQ represent the crystalline and melt-quenched amorphous states of GST, respectively. (b) 3D temperature distributions of the absorber for Vg = 42 V and t = 12 ns where the color bar represents the value of the temperature. 
To reversibly tune the resonant mode, the crystalline GST film must be reamorphised. This requires the crystal lattice to be molten and subsequently quenched to TM. As is shown in Fig. 4(a), one can change the GST state from the crystalline to the molten state by applying Vg = 42 V to the absorber. In the reamorphisation process, the Vg = 42 V applied to the sample at t = 10 ns causes a current to flow, which Joule heats the GST to a temperature beyond the TM rapidly, thus causing it to melt. By turning off the Vg = 42 V the fast cooling can quench the melt into the amorphous phase. In Fig. 4b, we present a 3D temperature distribution of the system at Vg = 42 V at t = 12 ns. It shows that the whole crystalline GST film reaches the 873 K melting temperature in just 2 ns, which causes it to melt, and then the GST film temperature falls below the crystallisation temperature after another 3 ns. So the whole melt-quench amorphisation process can be completed in 5 ns. We have schematically shown a conceptual design to enable electrical tuning of our NIR absorptance in Fig. S8 of the ESI.†
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a reconfigurable near-perfect absorber composed of Au NPs coupled to a Si3N4/GST/Au multilayer. The structure was fabricated through a lithography-free method that avoids time-consuming, expensive, and sophisticated lithography procedures. We both theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the resonant mode could be tuned without reducing the peak absorptance magnitude, by transiting the GST structural phase between amorphous and crystalline states. The simple profile of the absorber leads to a tolerant fabrication procedure. The Si3N4 capping layer prevents the GST reacting with the other materials in the structure, an aspect that is generally overlooked. We constructed an electric-thermal transfer model to investigate the heat generation and temporal temperature distribution within the NP-coupled film system. A re-amorphisation time of 5 ns was observed, leading to a real-time reconfigurable light absorber. The straightforward fabrication process expands the possibility of using this structure for wavelength-tunable photo-detecting and photovoltaic devices.
4. Methods
4.1. Theoretical model
In our simulation, the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics developed from the finite element method was employed to build up the numerical model. In the model, the experimentally measured complex refractive index of GST (Fig. 1(c)) was used, and the permittivities of Au and Si3N4 were given by Johnson and Christy's data75 and Philipp's data,76 respectively. The randomly distributed spherical NPs are considered in the numerical model in which the Au NP radius was ∼50 nm determined from the TEM image (Fig. 1b). The structure was calculated by adopting the scattering boundary conditions along the x-, y-, and z-axes. It was illuminated under a plane wave source propagating along the −z direction (Fig. 1a).
4.2. Sample fabrications
We used a substrate of a 500 μm thick up-doped double side polished Si (001) wafer (resistivity >2 × 104 Ω cm). Before deposition, the Si substrate was cleaned ultrasonically in acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water. Dry nitrogen was used to dry the substrate. A Au layer with a thickness of 100 nm was first deposited onto the Si substrate by the magnetic sputtering system (AJA Orion5). The pressures of the chamber and sputtering were 4 × 10−5 Pa and 0.5 Pa, respectively. The radius of the Au target (a purity of 99.9%) was 25.4 mm. The Au was sputtered through a 100 watt power at a direct current gun and a deposition rate of 1.5 Å s−1. The GST layer was then sputter-deposited on the 100 nm thick Au film using the radiofrequency (RF) gun. The deposition rate was 1 Å s−1 from a GST sputtering target with a purity of 99.99% and a radius of 25.4 mm. Then, a 5 nm thick buffer layer of Si3N4 was deposited on the top of the GST film with 0.5 Pa pressure. The deposition rate was 0.16 Å s−1 from a Si target with a purity of 99.99%. The Si3N4 composition was attained using reactive sputtering under an Ar:N2 atmosphere of 8:2. The Au NPs were drop-cast onto the top surface of the Si3N4 film and left to dry in air from an ethanol-diluted monodisperse Au NP colloidal solution (BB International). The substrate was heated at 60 °C for fast evaporation of ethanol to avoid the aggregation of Au NPs.
4.3. Sample measurements
The measurements of angular reflections were carried out using a variable angle high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometer. Reflectance spectra as a function of wavelength were acquired for the different incident angles. The setup can collect data over the spectral region (400–2400 nm). The incident angle varies from 20° to 80°. The absorptance spectra are then obtained from the reflectance data by A = 1 − R − T, where the transmittance T was zero.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of the reconfigurable absorber composed of Au NPs coupled to the Si3N4/GST/Au trilayer structure, all of which reside on a Si substrate. The thicknesses of Si3N4, GST, and Au reflector are 5, 35, and 100 nm, respectively. The average diameter of the Au NPs is 50 nm. (b) TEM image of the fabricated device as viewed in the x–y plane perpendicular to the incident light. The inset shows a TEM image of a single Au NP. (c) The ellipsometry measured the complex refractive index of the 35 nm thick GST planar film for both the amorphous (denoted as AM) and crystalline (denoted as CR) states. (d) The measured (top panel) and calculated (bottom panel) A(ω) of the structures in both the amorphous (solid lines) and crystalline (dashed lines) states for p- (left column) and s- (right column) polarisations with θ = 20°.	 

 	Fig. 2  The normalized total E-field intensity, H-field intensity, and JD distributions along the β plane (x–z plane) at the resonant wavelengths of the absorbers with the different GST states of (a) amorphous at λ1 = 980 nm and (b) crystalline at λ2 = 1520 nm, where the linearly p-polarised plane wave illuminates the absorber with θ = 20°.	 

 	Fig. 3  Measurement of angular dispersions of the absorptance (a and b) for the amorphous GST at (a) p-polarisation and (b) s-polarisation and (c and d) for the crystalline GST at (c) p-polarisation and (d) s-polarisation. Photos of the 1 cm × 1 cm absorber for the (e) amorphous GST and (f) crystalline GST.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) A time-dependent temperature distribution of a GST layer in Au NP-coupled Si3N4/GST/Au multilayers. To switch back the state, the crystalline GST must be annealed beyond the TM = 873 K which was achieved by Vg = 42 V. Subsequent quenching led to the GST with the melt-quenched amorphous state. CR and MQ represent the crystalline and melt-quenched amorphous states of GST, respectively. (b) 3D temperature distributions of the absorber for Vg = 42 V and t = 12 ns where the color bar represents the value of the temperature.
