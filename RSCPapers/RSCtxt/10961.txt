    , Accepted 16th January 2020First published on 17th January 2020AbstractThe photoelectrochemical properties of scheelite-related MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 (MII = Ca, Sr, x = 0.1 to 0.9) solid solutions deposited on conductive glass (coated with SnO2, F-doped) have been investigated as photoanodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The variation of the final annealing temperature during the preparation of the conduction electrodes as well as the value of substitution x have been shown to affect the PEC performance. The micropowders of MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 (MII = Ca, Sr, x = 0.1 to 0.9) samples were first fabricated vi a solid-state method; they were characterised by SEM microscopy and powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction, and the band gap values were estimated using diffusive reflectance data. The value of substitution x = 0.1 in the cases of samples containing calcium and strontium affords the highest PEC performance reported for the whole range of substitution. These results demonstrate a promising approach for the beneficial utilization of BiVO4-substituted scheelite-related solid solutions in photo-electrochemical cells towards efficient and inexpensive photoanodes.
Introduction
Global demand for environmentally friendly, low-cost and renewable energy is increasing rapidly and is becoming one of the most challenging research tasks. To meet the rising requirements, solar-driven water splitting technology has been shown to play an important role in sustainable energy generation1 and water purification.2
In general, photoelectrochemical water splitting has been identified as one of the most promising solutions to energy- and environment-related issues. In this context, extensive efforts have been focused on identifying inexpensive and stable photoanode candidates.3,4 Currently, a number of semiconductors with different compositions have demonstrated sufficient efficiency for water oxidation, such as TiO2, α-Fe2O3, BiVO4, WO3, ZnO, TaON, and Ta3N5.5
Scheelite-related derivatives of a semiconductor, BiVO4, have been attracting considerable attention due to their wide environmental application as inexpensive active photocatalysts. BiVO4 has a narrow band gap (2.3 to 2.5 eV), which utilizes a significant portion of visible light, and a valence band (VB) edge that is positive enough to provide sufficient overpotential for the water oxidation reaction.6 Furthermore, BiVO4 is non-toxic and chemically stable.7 Taking into account its visible light activity, solid solutions based on BiVO4 have emerged as promising candidates for photocatalytic degradation of a diversity of organic pollutants8,9 and for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting.10 There is a set of indispensable requirements for photo-electrodes based on these oxide materials, namely strong light absorption, high efficiency for water splitting at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and fast charge transfer and separation to achieve high PEC performance.11 BiVO4 has a wide light absorption range (bandgap of ∼2.4 eV), which can effectively absorb a wide range of the solar visible light spectrum. In addition, it is expected to have a high theoretical STH conversion efficiency of ∼9.1% under AM1.5 irradiation. However, the typical efficiencies of pure BiVO4 for water oxidation are not impressive because it suffers from excessive electron–hole recombination, poor charge transport properties, and poor water oxidation kinetics.6,12,13 Mainly due to these disadvantages, the oxygen evolution reaction may show high overpotential and low reaction efficiency of surface holes, causing low conversion efficiency of solar radiation. To improve the PEC performance of BiVO4, three different approaches have been developed to overcome the difficulties mentioned above: doping, heterojunction creation, and co-catalyst deposition.1,13 Among these methods, doping with Mo6+ has been shown to produce significant effects at about 10% molar content,14,15 producing about two times higher photocurrent generation at the oxygen evolution potential. Doping is a well-known strategy to improve the conductivity and narrow the band gap of a semiconductor. Consequently, aliovalent doping has been proven to be effective in the charge separation of PEC photoanodes.1
To develop the strategy and to understand the nature of the influence of Mo6+ doping on increasing the electric conductivity and improving the PEC performance, the structural and synthetic peculiarities of Mo6+–V5+ aliovalent substitution should be studied in light of different levels of substitution by the Mo6+–V5+ aliovalent pair within the scheelite-related framework.
Considerable work in this area has been devoted to solid solutions based on BiVO4, where the cationic positions are substituted by uni-, bi- and tri-valent metals and Mo6+ and V5+ species are located in one tetrahedrally coordinated site. The background for simultaneous doping in both cationic and anionic sublattices is explained by two technical reasons. Addition of an aliovalent cation usually affects the band gap by inducing a donor level into the wide band gap of the host. Anion doping is mostly applied to shift the absorption edge from the UV to the visible region, which is also a required criterion for a commercially attractive photoanode material.
The crystallographic peculiarities of solid solution formation were studied for x(MI0.5Bi0.5MoO4) − (1 − x)BiVO4 (MI = Ag, Li, Na and K)16–19 and Bi1−x/3V1−xMoxO4 (x = 0.05 to 0.20).14 The latter has been pointed out to possess V and Mo in the same position, lowering the point group symmetry of the tetrahedral unit from 4/m to 2/m and providing monoclinic distortion for solid solutions with x = 0.05 to 0.10; it showed the best catalytic performance in water splitting in the case of x = 0.10.14 Thus, the level of cationic doping has been shown to play a key role in catalytic performance. Meanwhile, substitution with univalent metals has been studied in detail;17–19 a few data have been found concerning the influence of bivalent metals on the catalytic performance and the level of substitution to date. For the series Ca1−xBixVxMo1−xO4, which has been found to be an efficient photocatalyst in O2 production, the presence of admixtures20 requires additional structural and catalytic study. To date, a narrow range of substitution has been successfully synthesized by traditional solid-state methods; the catalytic performance has not yet been studied,21 while in the case of strontium-containing systems, there have been no data at all.
In comparison to calcium, Sr cation is much larger (rion Ca2+ = 1.12 Å and rion Sr2+ = 1.26 Å with CN = 8 (ref. 22)). Moreover, the size of bismuth cation (rion Bi3+ = 1.17 Å under CN = 8 (ref. 22)) is approximately 4% larger and 8% smaller than those of Ca2+ and Sr2+, respectively. Therefore, one can expect solid solution formation for both CaxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 and SrxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4. Although in the case of the same structural type, the increase in calcium content should lead to shrinking of the oxygen polyhedral volume (Bi/Sr)O8, in the case of strontium content increase within (Bi/Sr)O8 units, the polyhedral volume should consequently become larger. Thereby, in the case of SrxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4, the PEC performance can change in a different manner; this may shed more light on the relationship between the level of substitution and the PEC performance of the corresponding photoanodes.
To meet the challenges of the search for a suitable novel PEC photocatalyst, we have developed a series of solid solutions MII1−xBixVxMo1−xO4 (where MII = Ca, Sr), where a full range of Mo6+–V5+ aliovalent substitution of x = 0.1 to 0.9 is realized. The structural peculiarities of the pure prepared compounds have been studied by single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction and indirect band gap estimation from the diffusive reflectance spectra. To study their PEC performance, the prepared solid solutions were loaded on a glass substrate covered by fluorine-doped tin oxide film (FTO-glass) to enhance the photoelectrochemical water oxidation process. The influences of the final temperature annealing of the prepared conducting glasses and the level of substitution of the solid solutions on the values of PEC performance have been studied in detail. The effects of local polyhedral symmetry and space group changes within the same scheelite-related framework under different levels of substitution has been discussed as one of the key factors in the design and compositional optimization of photoanodes based on BiVO4-related compounds.
Experimental
Synthesis procedures
Polycrystalline solid solutions MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4, where MII = Ca (abbreviated as CBVM) and Sr (SBVM) and with values of substitution x = 0.1 (samples CBVM1 and SBVM1), 0.2 (CBVM2 and SBVM2), 0.3 (CBVM3 and SBVM3), 0.5 (CBVM5 and SBVM5), 0.7 (CBVM7 and SBVM7), 0.8 (CBVM8 and SBVM8) and 0.9 (CBVM9 and SBVM9) were fabricated by conventional solid-state reaction routes. Analytically pure CaCO3, SrCO3, Bi2O3, MoO3 and V2O5 were used without further purification as starting materials. Stoichiometric amounts of the reagents were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar with a pestle into fine powders according to the scheme:  
At the first stage, the mixtures were calcinated at 550 °C for 2 h to remove carbon dioxide. Then, the resulting powders were mixed with a drop of ethanol, thoroughly reground and sintered at 600 for 5 h, 700 °C for 8 h, and 900 °C for 8 h, with intermediate regrinding after each temperature in covered alumina crucibles.
Samples of CaMoO4 and BiVO4 were prepared by the same procedure described above.
Single crystals of Ca0.126Bi0.874V0.874Mo0.126O4 were prepared by a flux technique from a K–Bi–Ca–Mo–V–O molten system. The initial reagents, analytically pure K2CO3, Bi2O3, CaCO3, KVO3, MoO3 and K2MoO4, were mixed in ratios of 1:1:1:8:3:3. Calculated amounts of raw materials were transferred to a platinum crucible and placed in a resistive heating vertical single zone furnace attached with a Eurotherm controller. The crystal growth process was conducted according to the following scheme: (1) the temperature was increased from room temperature to 1000 °C at a rate of 200 °C h−1 to melt the mixture of the precursors; (2) the prepared melt was maintained at this temperature for 2 h in order to homogenize the mixture; (3) the melt was then cooled from 1000 °C to 650 °C at a rate of 100 °C h−1 to initiate nucleation and facilitate the crystal growth; (4) the rest of the melt was decanted out from the crystals onto a copper sheet; (5) the crystalline products were annealed at 300 °C for 2 h and cooled to room temperature; (6) at the final stage, the crystals were leached out from the rest of the solidified melt in hot distilled water.
Material characterization
For single crystal Ca0.126Bi0.874V0.874Mo0.126O4, diffraction data were collected on an Oxford Diffraction XCalibur-3 diffractometer equipped with a 4 MPixel CCD detector using monochromatized Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The structure was solved using the charge flipping method using SUPERFLIP22 and refined with the full matrix least-squares technique in the anisotropic approximation using the JANA2006 program package.23 The crystal data, experimental conditions, refinement results and atomic coordinates are reported in Tables S1 and S2 (see the ESI†). Further details of the crystal structure are available from the Cambridge Structural Database by quoting depository number CCDC 1920165.†24
The X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a Shimadzu XRD-6000 conventional powder diffractometer operating in Bragg-Brentano (θ/2θ) geometry using a graphite monochromator and Cu Kα radiation. The unit cell parameters for all the powders were indexed using the DICVOL program25 and refined using the Le Bail method using Jana2006.23 The crystal structure of Sr0.5Bi0.5V0.5Mo0.5O4 with the depository number CCDC 1920166† (Cambridge Structural Database) was refined with the Rietveld method using the FULLPROF software.26 For the structural solutions, the atomic coordinates were taken from experimental data obtained from single crystal Ca0.126Bi0.874V0.874Mo0.126O4.
The microstructures and morphologies of the samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy at a 10 kV accelerating voltage with an SEM Magellan 400 microscope (with an Oxford X-Max microanalysis EDS system) after deposition of a thin Au film. The chemical compositions of each sample taken from EDS data were found to be close to the calculated compositions (Table S3, ESI†).
Diffuse reflectance spectra were collected at room temperature using an Agilent Cary 5000 UV-Vis spectrometer equipped with a Cary 4/5/6000i deuterium UV lamp. The spectra were recorded in the range of 190 to 600 nm with 0.2 nm resolution. Absorbance spectra F(R)(hν) were calculated from the measured diffuse reflectance spectra using the Kubelka–Munk (K–M)27 relation: F(R) = (1 − R)2/2R(1)where R(hν) is the measured diffuse reflectance of a sample normalized to the standard of white PTFE (Teflon).
Electrode preparation
The photoanodes were prepared by deposition of the powdered samples CBVM1 to CBVM9, SBVM1 to SBVM9, CaMoO4 and BiVO4 on commercial glass substrates coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) while complying with the deposition steps.28 The sequence applied for the electrode preparation is illustrated in Fig. 1, including (1) forming a stable suspension of the sample in Nafion liquid; (2) covering the surface of the FTO glass with a batched volume suspension, (3) preliminary drying and (4) final annealing.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the preparation of the (C or S) BVM-FTO films (a), general view of the samples (b), saturated suspension in Nafion (c), and photoanode after annealing (d). 
At the first stage of preparation, 50 mg of a fine powder of the studied sample was dispersed in 1 ml of Nafion liquid (PFSA D520, 5%, from DuPont) under ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Afterwards, the suspension was left for a few hours to form a sediment. The saturated solution above the precipitate was used for the coating procedure.
The suspension in the amount of 145 μL was dropped on a side of FTO conducting glass pre-cleaned by ultrasonic washing with a size of 1.5 × 1.5 cm.29 Each coated glass was firstly dried at 60 °C for 2 h and then calcinated at different temperatures in order to choose the optimal annealing procedure for the PEC experiments. The coated glasses are denoted as follows: CBVM(1–9)-FTO, SBVM(1–9)-FTO, CaMoO4-FTO, and BiVO4-FTO.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC performance was measured for C (or S) BVM-FTO working photoanodes with a fixed measurement area of 1 cm2 using a CHI electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, from CH Instruments, Inc.) in a three-electrode cell with Pt foil as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 water electrolyte (purged with N2).
For sunlight simulation, a spectrally matched high pressure Xenon lamp (PLS-SXE 300C Xe, Perfect Light) with an AM1.5 cutoff filter was used. The intensity of the incident light was adjusted to a level of 100 mW cm−2 using a power meter with a thermal sensor (Thor Labs S302C). The pulsed character of the photoanode illumination was carried out using an electronic timer to provide a fixed cross section of the incident beam. Measurements were performed in a darkened room in order to prevent additional effects of natural or artificial lighting. The general scheme of the described cell of the photoelectric measurements is depicted in Fig. S1.†
The photocurrent–time curves (I–t curves) were measured under a constant bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE with chopped light every 50 seconds. The photocurrent–potential dependencies were recorded at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1 when scanning the potential in the anode direction. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the frequency range of 105 to 10−2 Hz (amplitude of 5 mV) at the open circuit potential. The EIS results were analyzed using ZSimpWin software. The RHE potential is calculated as: ERHE = ESCE + 0.0591 × pH + 0.244(2)where ESCE is the applied potential vs. SCE and 0.244 V is the standard potential of the SCE reference electrode.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure
In the first stage of investigation, several experiments on single crystal growth were carried out to choose the best structural model for the solid solutions MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 (MII = Ca, Sr). The flux containing K2Mo2O7 was chosen as an inert molten salt medium for optimal crystal growth. The products obtained are yellow-green in colour and crystallize in irregular dodecahedral shapes that tend toward axial deformation (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The results of the energy dispersive spectra taken from different EDS spots confirm the absence of potassium in the prepared crystals, and the molar ratio of Ca, Bi, Mo and V corresponds to the formulae presented above (Fig. S2b, ESI†). These data confirm the formation of a solid solution between CaMoO4 and BiVO4. Refinement of the single crystal structure was performed, taking into account the molar ratios found and the best electron density distribution.
The single crystal with the Ca0.126Bi0.874V0.874Mo0.126O4 empirical formula crystallizes tetragonally with the space group I41 (Table 1) and is related to the scheelite mineral CaWO4. In the crystal structure, one crystallographically unique position of Bi/Ca with an occupancy distribution of 0.874/0.126 is present at the Wyckoff position 4b, showing a coordination sphere of eight oxygen atoms in the shape of a trigonal dodecahedron (Fig. 2a). The (Bi/Ca)–O distances range from 2.4095(1) to 2.4822(1) Å (Table 1). These distances represent a combination of average Ca–O and Bi–O distances and are in good agreement with those of other mixed Bi/Ca oxygen polyhedra with complex oxoanions.30

The same phenomenon can be observed for mixed V/Mo unique species, which are situated at the Wyckoff position 4b with V occupancy equal to 0.126 and surrounded by four oxygen atoms forming bisphenoidally distorted tetrahedra. The (V/Mo)–O bond lengths and O–(V/Mo)–O angles agree well with other scheelite-related compounds containing mixed (V/Mo)O4 tetrahedra.14 The isolated (V/Mo)O4 tetrahedra (Fig. 2b) are exclusively vertex-connected to the polyhedra around the Bi/Ca cations; therefore, the crystallographically unique oxygen atoms aresurrounded by one V/Mo cation and two Bi/Ca cations. The crystal structure formed by chains of alternate corner-sharing (V/Mo)O4 tetrahedra and edge-sharing (Bi/Ca)O8 trigonal dodecahedra along the a axis is illustrated in Fig. 2c.
The structure of powdered Sr0.5Bi0.5V0.5Mo0.5O4 was determined by the Rietveld method (Fig. 3). Further details of its structural solution are given in Tables S1 and S2, ESI.† The XRD pattern was refined by the Rietveld method in the I41/a space group with random occupation of cationic and anionic sites by Sr/Bi and V/Mo (the so-called disordered scheelite, as observed for Ca0.126Bi0.874V0.874Mo0.126O4 single crystal). The occupation rate of the metal sites was fixed to 50% according to the EDS results (Fig. S3, ESI†). The refined cell parameters, atomic coordinates and reliability factors are reported in Tables S1 and S2, ESI.† In the framework of Sr0.5Bi0.5V0.5Mo0.5O4, in comparison to the calcium-containing structure, where a smaller ion substitutes a larger one (rion Ca2+ = 1.12 Å, while rion Bi3+ = 1.17 Å under CN = 8),22 strontium ion is much larger than bismuth ion (rion Sr2+ = 1.26 Å) and the level of substitution is much higher. Consequently, the bond distances (Bi/Sr)–O within the (Bi/Sr)O8 trigonal dodecahedra increase, and the overall structure can be described as more symmetrical.
 Fig. 3  Rietveld refinement of Sr0.5Bi0.5V0.5Mo0.5O4 (circle signs correspond to the experimental data; the black solid line is the calculated profile; the tick marks represent the positions of the allowed reflection; the difference in the blue curve on the same scale is plotted at the bottom of the pattern; the insert is a view of the unit cell). 
This phenomenon of a wider range of substitution in the case of a greater difference in radii in comparison to calcium-containing structures is found to be against known isomorphism rules. Taking into account that our results are in accordance with the data reported for CaxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 by other authors,19,20 we can assume that the reasons for the small range of Ca-substitution in the solid solutions studied are not structural problems but are features of the synthetic path. Thus, in all cases,19,20 CaCO3 was used as a source of calcium. It is known that the decomposition of SrCO3 is less reversible compared to those of the other carbonates, while CaCO3 is characterized by much higher activation energy.31 Based on the X-Ray powder diffraction data, we can assume that continuous annealing of the corresponding mixtures containing CaCO3 is followed by formation of an admixture that is more stable at elevated temperatures, and its traces interfere with pure phase preparation.
The framework Sr0.5Bi0.5V0.5Mo0.5O4 presents a unique (V/Mo)–O distance of 1.7647(7) Å, three characteristic O–(V/Mo)–O angle values of 108.323(33)° and one of 111.7(3)°; this provides an almost undistorted tetrahedron due to the merging of the two oxygen positions of 8b into one 16f, leading to a space group change. In contrast, the structure of Ca0.126Bi0.874V0.874Mo0.126O4 is refined in the less symmetrical space group I41; it shows much more (V/Mo)O4 and (Bi/Ca)O8 distortion and is closer to the monoclinic distortion of tetragonal scheelite. In this space group, there are two (V/Mo)–O distances (Table 1) and O–(V/Mo)–O angles that deviate much more from the ideal tetrahedral surroundings. Similarly, the (Bi/Ca)O8 polyhedron has four different (Bi/Ca)–O bond lengths and different O–(Bi/Ca)–O angles, while Sr0.5Bi0.5V0.5Mo0.5O4 presents two (Bi/Sr)–O distances of 2.4756(51) × 4 and 2.5811(72) × 4 Å, as reported in Table 1.
From the structural point of view, the organization of the frameworks MII1−xBixVxMo1−xO4 (where MII = Ca, Sr) is similar, where local distortions occur within metal polyhedra. Meanwhile, the tetragonal crystal structures of pure SrMoO4 and CaMoO4 possess only one oxygen position,32,33 as observed for Sr0.5Bi0.5V0.5Mo0.5O4, which is also characterized by high alkaline earth metal content. In contrast, for the Ca0.126Bi0.874V0.874Mo0.126O4 structure, the number of oxygen sites is two, as has been shown for other defective scheelite compounds; this exerts a significant influence on the photocatalytic properties.13 Thus, one can conclude that significant changes in the crystal structure and local surroundings provoke non–linear changes in the PEC performance as well.
The X-ray diffraction patterns for the solid solutions of CaxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 (x = 0.1 to 1.0) ceramics sintered at 900 °C and the cell parameters as a function of the x value are presented in Fig. 4a. As expected, a scheelite-like structure for the series of solid solutions is obtained across the narrow range of x = 0.1 to 0.7, which is consistent with earlier work on these systems.20,21 When the x value increases to 0.70, a trace of the admixture phase peaks is revealed, which indicates that the solid solubility of the single-phase tetragonal materials reached a maximum here. Increasing the annealing time and temperature did not influence the XRD patterns for x = 0.8 to 0.9. In the cell parameters for the structures x = 0.1 to 0.7, both a and c increase with the increasing x value, as does the cell volume (Fig. 4b). The cell parameters agree well with previously reported data20 and are listed in Table S4, ESI.†

Fig. 4b shows the XRD patterns of the SrxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 ceramics, presenting the full scheelite-like structures of the solid solutions; the (101) peak split into (101) and (011) peaks in the case of monoclinic BiVO4, while splitting of the (200) peak into (200) and (020) peaks was not observed. The cell parameters a and c for the structures SrxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 (x = 0.1 to 1.0) increase with increasing x value (Table S4, ESI†), as was observed for the CaxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 series (x = 0.1 to 0.7).
To calculate the band gaps of the prepared solid solutions, the K–M function and Tauc plots were used. The K–M function, (F(R)), is shown in Fig S4, ESI† (R is the reflectance), and the factors for the direct band gap used for the Tauc plots were plotted against the photon energy. The defined K–M function was plotted against the photon energy, and Eg was determined as the energy coordinate of the point on the low energy side of the F(R) curve at which the linear increase starts. The absorption spectra of the MII1−xBixVxMo1−xO4 (where MII = Ca, Sr) solid solutions red-shift monotonically as the value of x increases. The band gap values for the CaxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 series (x = 0.1 to 0.7) of solid solutions were estimated to be 2.47 to 3.08 eV, and those for SrxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 (x = 0.1 to 1.0) were in a range of 2.35 to 3.28 eV.
Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses
This research focuses on two main aims: the influence of the level of aliovalent substitution on the PEC performance of MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4-based electrodes and the technological peculiarities of the preparation of the electrodes. Earlier, for the preparation of BiVO4-related photoanodes based on micro-powders, a metal–organic decomposition method including a spin coating stage was applied for FTO substrate loading.34,35 We compared the spin-coated and drop-coated methods for the SBVM1 and CBVM1 samples (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). The dropped-coating method appeared to realize the best interface efficiency between the photocatalyst grains and the conducting FTO glass. As can be seen from the SEM images with EDX mapping (Fig. S7, ESI†), the main reason for the different PEC performance of the electrodes prepared by different methods is the different distributions of photoactive particles on the surface of the FTO glasses. Thus, in the case of the spin-coating method, one can see an irregular distribution of particles leading to island-like particle distribution (Fig. S7a ESI†), while the drop-coated method demonstrates a more dense and uniform coating (Fig. SX7b ESI†). Importantly, the annealing temperature also affects the PEC performance, which will be discussed below. It is worth noting that bare FTO glass possesses comparatively insignificant photocatalytic activity toward the water splitting reaction under the conditions described above (Fig. S8, ESI†).
In order to prepare reference electrodes based on BiVO4, CaMoO4 and SrMoO4, the same method was applied. Although a photoanode based on BiVO4 was manufactured easily according to the scheme described above, in the cases of CaMoO4 and SrMoO4, the qualitative coating preparation failed. For the CaMoO4 sample, the weak adhesion between the photoactive film and the glass was followed by edge delamination at the stage of preliminary drying (Fig. S8, ESI†). Using the same procedure for the SrMoO4-based photoanode led to the appearance of an uneven blue colour, which indicates an undesirable chemical reaction during the primary annealing at 60 °C, followed by partial reduction of molybdenum. Consequently, a successful interface between the solid solution films and the FTO glasses was realized due to the presence of bismuth or/and vanadium oxygen polyhedra.
Typical SEM images of the prepared CBVM-FTO and SBVM-FTO electrodes are given in Fig. 5a. At first glance, the powdered solid solutions consist of particles with different sizes up to 10 μm and agglomerates of smaller particles; however, under higher resolution, one can observe (Fig. 5b) a dense covering with particles in the range of 1 to 50 μm on the glass surface. This indicates a successfully coated surface of the current collector.
 Fig. 5  SEM images of a prepared electrode (SBVM1-FTO is used as an example): (a) particle agglomeration; (b) the surface of the electrode under higher resolution. 
During the investigation of the PEC performance, the final annealing temperature of the electrode has been shown to play a significant role in the photochemical reaction of water splitting. Usually, for BiVO4-FTO-related electrodes, to realize a reliable interface between the catalyst and conducting glass, the final annealing is carried out at 400 °C to 450 °C.10 Taking into consideration that FTO glass is thermally stable up to 550 °C, the final annealing temperature range was widened to 350 °C to 500 °C. The influence of this procedure on the PEC and linear sweep current–voltage (LSV) characteristics was studied in detail for the CBVM1-FTO and SBVM1-FTO samples. The results of the I–t tests for these electrodes (Fig. 6a and b) show that the electrodes annealed at 500 °C possess the highest sensitivity toward light. The decrease in the final annealing temperature for the CBVM1-FTO electrode leads to decreased photocurrent values (Fig. S10, ESI†), as was observed for a SBVM1-FTO sample after furnacing at 475 °C (Fig. 6a and b).
 Fig. 6  Comparative testing of SBVM1-FTO performance after final annealing at different temperatures: (a) photocurrent–time curves; (b) photocurrent–potential curves; (c) dependencies of photocurrent–potential, showing the change in the LSV values; (d) EIS spectroscopy results (insert: the high-frequency region of the spectra). All measurements were taken in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. 
For a more detailed evaluation of the PEC performance of the prepared electrodes, the values of the onset potential of the photocurrent (Eonset) were determined. The photocurrent–potential curves under chopped light for the photoanodes prepared at different annealing temperatures are given in Fig. 6b and Fig. S10b, ESI.† These values show the sensitivity of the photocurrent under illumination that was switched on and off. For clarity, the results of the highest peaks of the LSV curves are combined in graphical dependencies, which are illustrated in Fig. 6c and Fig. S10c.† One can observe that the increase of the final annealing temperature leads to a monotonic increase of the photocurrent. Particularly, in the case of CBVM1-FTO electrode, there is a minor change in the photocurrent density from 500 °C to 400 °C; meanwhile, after reaching only 350 °C, this value significantly decreases. In contrast, for the SBVM1-FTO photoanode, a considerable decrease of the photocurrent values is followed by a decrease in the calcination temperature from 500 °C to 450 °C. Consequently, photoanodes prepared by annealing at 500 °C have higher sensitivity toward photocurrent changes both for calcium- and strontium-containing systems, providing better productivity of these electrodes in PEC processes.
These conclusions fully conform to the results of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigation (the electrochemical scheme and its description are given in Fig. S11†), which are shown in Fig. 6d and Fig. S10d.† Usually, the low-frequency region of EIS (the inserts in Fig. 6d and Fig. S10d†) is found to be related to electron transfer on the photoanode/electrolyte interface.33 Thus, in the case of photoanodes SBVM1-FTO, after annealing in a temperature range of 350 °C to 500 °C, the resistivity of the electron transfer (Rs) changes slightly from 44.6 to 30 Ohm cm−2. In the high-frequency region, there is a semicircle, which is associated with charge transfer on a photoanode. The calculated values of the resistance of the electron transfer (Rct) decrease sharply as the final annealing temperature increases for the electrodes studied. Particularly, in the case of SBVM1-FTO photoanode (Fig. 6d), the values of Rct are 78120, 2982, 1218 and 297 Ohm cm−2 after annealing at 350 °C, 450 °C, 475 °C and 500 °C, respectively. Thus, increasing the temperature of annealing at the final stage of electrode preparation can beneficially affect the kinetics of water splitting on the photoanode surface.36,37
Moreover, the significant improvement of the PEC performance with increasing temperature is closely connected with the peculiarities of the electrode preparation. Thus, the SEM images show that at 350 °C, the photoactive phase is almost fully covered with decomposing products of Nafion material. This conclusion is supported by the EDX mapping of the elements, which shows poor presence of metals on the surface of the photoanodes for both the CBVM1-FTO and SBVM1-FTO samples (Fig. S12, ESI†). Moreover, according to the results of UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectra, a “dark” film on the surface of the electrodes significantly absorbs incident light (Fig. S13, ESI†), which decreases the productivity of the photoanodes. Increasing the annealing temperature leads to gradual burnout of the remaining Nafion material, accompanied by changes in the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. S13, ESI†), and enhances the availability of the surface containing photoactive particles to the light beam. According to the SEM images and EDX mapping, at 500 °C, the surface of the photoactive material becomes fully accessible to light (Fig. 5 and Fig. S7, ESI†), which corresponds to the maximum PEC performance achieved.
At the next stage of the study, the influence of the chemical compositions of the cation- and anion-substituted solid solutions on the characteristics of the PEC performance for the manufactured electrodes was considered for the photoanodes prepared at a final annealing temperature of 500 °C. As can be seen from the I–t curves, the value of the photocurrent is significantly higher for the composition of solid solutions of MII1−xBixVxMo1−xO4 (where MII = Ca, Sr) within the values x = 0 to 0.3 (Fig. 7a and b), while subsequent increase of the level of substitution leads to a significant photocurrent decrease (Fig. S12, ESI†). After the primary illumination, a sharp surge of photocurrent occurs, providing first photocurrent values for SBVM1-FTO and CBVM1-FTO samples of 66 and 45 μA cm−2, respectively. For BiVO4-FTO, this value reaches only 11 μA cm−2 under the same conditions. It should be pointed out that the spikes followed by slow decay (Fig. 7) observed in the photocurrent transients are more likely to be connected with the presence of intense surface electron–hole recombination processes.38 Due to the fact that substituted BiVO4-based solid solutions are characterized by wider bandgap values, a more detailed investigation should be performed to determine the reasons for the improved PEC performance of the MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 (MII – Ca, Sr) solid solutions.
 Fig. 7  Results of the I–t-tests for electrodes prepared based on solid solutions of MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 (where MII = Ca, Sr) with the values x = 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3: (a, b) first 10 min of testing (c, d) and after photocurrent stabilization for CBMV(1–3)-FTO, SBVM(1–3)-FTO and BiVO4-FTO. Changes in the photocurrent depending on the composition of MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 (e) in the first cycle of illumination and (f) after current stabilization. 
The photoelectrodes covered by MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 (x = 0.2 and 0.3) show photocurrent values in the range of 5 to 25 μA cm−2 (Fig. 7a and b), whereas upon reaching x = 0.5, in all cases, the primary photovoltaic current does not exceed 4 μA cm−2 (Fig. S14, ESI†).
During the experiments, under continuous cyclic illumination, the intensity of the photocurrent for all electrodes decreased and reached stability after about 15 minutes (Fig. 7c, d and Fig. S14c, d, ESI†). At the same time, the general pattern did not change. For the BiVO4-FTO photoanode, the photocurrent stabilized at a level of 3 μA cm−2, while the highest values were recorded for SBVM1-FTO (14 μA cm−2) and CBVM1-FTO (13.5 μA cm−2). In contrast, the photocurrent values in the cases of the SBVM2-FTO, SBVM3-FTO, CBVM2-FTO and CBVM3-FTO electrodes range from 3 to 7 μA cm−2. For the remaining Ca-substituted compounds, the stabilized photocurrent does not exceed 2.5 μA cm−2, while for the Sr-substituted compounds, it is lower than 0.5 μA cm−2 (Fig. S14, ESI†). Changes in the photocurrent density at the primary illumination and the subsequent stabilization dependencies on the type and composition of the solid solutions are shown in Fig. 7e and f.
As can be clearly seen from the data obtained, the best PEC characteristics were recorded for the compositions MII0.1Bi0.9V0.9Mo0.1O4, while upon increasing the content of alkaline earth metals up to x = 0.2 to 0.3, there was a small decrease in the photocurrent value; however, they still exceed the corresponding values of the BiVO4-FTO electrode. However, when the x value exceeds 0.5, the photocatalytic activity sharply decreases. This result is in good correlation with CaxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4.20 The nonlinear behaviour of the PEC performance for CaxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 with x = 0.7 to 0.9 is more likely to be related to the presence of photoactive phases of impurities, as has been mentioned above.
At the next stage of investigation, electrochemical studies confirmed the described correlations. Thus, the curves of the photocurrent potential (Fig. S15, ESI†) are in good agreement with the graphical dependence shown in Fig. 8a and b; the highest values of LSV correspond to the first three electrodes, providing the highest sensitivity to illumination in the cases of x = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 for MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4. In comparison to BiVO4-FTO electrode, this value is lower and continues to decrease for the remaining electrodes. The results of the EIS measurements for all photoanodes are shown in Fig. 8c, e and d, f. The smallest diameter of the semicircle of the Nyquist plots for the MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 photoanodes is observed for x = 0.3; it is smaller than that of pure BiVO4 and other known anodes,36,37 representing that the formation of the solid solution enhances the separation efficiency of the photo-induced electron–hole pairs.
 Fig. 8  Graphical dependence of the peaks of the photocurrent-potential curves for the CBVM-FTO (a) and SBVM-FTO (b) photoanodes; Nyquist plots of the EIS measured at the open circuit potential for the CBVM-FTO (c, e) and SBVM-FTO (d, f) photoanodes. All measurements were taken in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. 
Analysis of the relationships between the PEC characteristics and structural peculiarities of the prepared solid solutions reveals strong correlations. Thus, a small level of aliovalent substitution in BiVO4 leads to a phase transition from monoclinic to tetragonal with the formation of two oxygen sites at the Wyckoff position 8b, as is shown for the crystal structure of Ca0.126Bi0.874V0.874Mo0.126O4. There are 18 oxygen edges for the mixed (Ca/Bi)O8 polyhedra, including equivalent O–O distances, six pairs of equal O–O contacts, and two other types with distances of 3.68 to 2.69 Å, while the (V/Mo)O4 tetrahedra possess two pairs of equal (V/Mo)–O bonds (Table 1, Fig. 9). An increase in the level of substitution, as observed for Sr0.5Bi0.5V0.5Mo0.5O4, leads to an increase in symmetry of the space group from I41 to I41/a and the presence of only one oxygen site at the Wyckoff position 16f. The latter significantly changes the local symmetry of the coordination polyhedra. In this case, the (Sr/Bi)O8 dodecahedra already contain four equivalent distances O–O, while the (V/Mo)O4 tetrahedra become almost regular.
 Fig. 9  The local site symmetries of the main building blocks for the structures Ca0.126Bi0.874V0.874Mo0.126O4 (a) and Sr0.5Bi0.5V0.5Mo0.5O4 (b). 
This structural change for MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 is followed by a sharp decrease in the PEC performance for the anodes based on this series. This phenomenon is in agreement with the bandgap value changes.
The increase of the bandgap, which is followed by a decrease of the number of available photons with the same light source, is a possible reason for the decrease in the overall PEC activity of the solid solutions whose x values exceed 0.3. Consequently, changes in the local symmetry of the structures within the same framework have a significant influence on the PEC performance of the solid solutions. One can admit that the small level of substitution of BiVO4, which is responsible for stabilization of the tetragonal system, is also more likely to be a sufficient factor providing a maximum effect on increasing the PEC performance in the water splitting reaction.
In comparison to other well-known BiVO4-based photoanodes that play an important role in the water splitting reaction, the prepared solid solutions take a leading position based on the value of the observed photocurrent (Table 2).

From the data presented, it can be seen that the anodes based on the solid solutions MII0.1Bi0.9V0.9Mo0.1O4 show rather high values of PEC performance in the water splitting reaction, although they do not contain any Co-catalysts. Thus, we can assume that further development of more efficient electrodes for photoelectrochemical catalysis can involve a combination of two approaches: the principles of crystalline engineering in order to influence the microstructure and application of effective additives such as co-catalysts in the composites.
Conclusions
Two sets of promising photoanodes based on solid solutions of the MIIxBi1−xV1−xMoxO4 series (MII = Ca, Sr; x = 0.1 to 0.9) have been prepared by a solid state technique and fabricated by loading on FTO substrates. The influence of the final annealing temperature of the prepared combined anodes on the PEC performance has been studied for the first time. It was found that the MII0.1Bi0.9V0.9Mo0.1O4 products exhibit higher photocurrent densities, and maximum values of almost 66 μA cm−2 (for the MII = Sr-containing anodes) and 45 μA cm−2 (for the MII = Ca-containing anodes) have been achieved. The photocatalytic activity of the solid solutions was found to be strongly dependent on the composition and structural peculiarities, which thus play important roles in the PEC performance and band gap values. Furthermore, the present results demonstrate that crystal structure engineering is an efficient approach to develop novel photocatalysts with enhanced light-harvesting capability.
