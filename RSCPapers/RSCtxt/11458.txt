    , Accepted 7th June 2012First published on 13th June 2012AbstractSelective activation of saturated sp3 C–H bonds to high-value-added chemicals remains a significant but challenging task for the sustainable exploitation of available feedstocks. However, the selective oxidation of C–H bonds with environmentally benign oxygen is often very difficult to control. Research works available in thermal heterogeneous catalysis often involve the use of transition metal particles together with harsh reaction conditions, e.g., high temperature and high pressure, which results in the difficulty in controlling the selectivity. Here, we report a very simple room temperature method to prepare a cubic phase, sheet structured semiconductor CdS sample. The as-prepared CdS is able to be used as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of saturated primary C–H bonds in alkyl aromatics with high activity and selectivity using molecular oxygen as a benign oxidant and benzotrifluoride as the solvent under ambient conditions, i.e., room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The superior photocatalytic performance of CdS can be attributed to its unique assembly of sheet structure with cubic phase, high surface area and efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers. The possible reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic selective oxidation of such C–H bonds over the CdS semiconductor has also been proposed.
1. Introduction
Heterogeneous photocatalysis by semiconductor materials has been widely applied to environmental purification because photoactivated semiconductors can efficiently mineralize toxic organic pollutants to CO2 and H2O.1–20 This “nonselective” oxidation process makes the application of semiconductor photocatalysis in “selective” organic transformations relatively uncommon.21–23 However, the rational use of appropriate semiconductors and fine control of reaction conditions can promote organic reactions to occur with high selectivity.21–46 This has been witnessed by recent progress in the photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols over various semiconductor-based materials.24–41,46 For example, we reported that a TiO2–graphene nanocomposite can act as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes under ambient conditions.27 Wang et al. showed that the UV light photoactivity and reaction rate of TiO2 toward oxidation of alcohols can be dramatically accelerated without loss of selectivity by the adsorption of Brønsted acid and incorporation of SiO2 into the matrix of TiO2.46 Palmisano's group reported a home-made rutile TiO2 with bad crystallinity has the highest selective photoactivity toward oxidation of alcohols under UV light irradiation.26
In comparison with selective oxidation of –CH2OH functional groups of alcohols as mentioned above, selective activation of saturated sp3 C–H bonds to high-value-added chemicals remains a significant but challenging task for the sustainable exploitation of available feedstocks.47–54 However, selective oxidation of C–H bonds with environmentally benign oxygen is often very difficult to control because of the following reasons: (i) the abundance and inertness of C–H bonds in organic substrates present difficulties for selectivity; (ii) the activation of very inert C–H bonds is much more difficult and it typically requires harsh conditions, e.g., high pressure and high temperature; with such reaction conditions, the reactivity of molecular oxygen is difficult to control, thereby resulting in poor selectivity or overoxidation.
One class of raw materials is alkyl aromatics.55 For example, toluene, the simplest member of this class, can be selectively oxidized to benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid or benzyl benzoate, which are commercially versatile intermediates in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs, preservatives, perfumes, plasticizers, and flame retardants. Commercial processes for the selective oxidation of toluene to these valuable intermediates are based on metal catalysts and high temperature.55 Recently, Hutchings' research group has reported that Au–Pd alloy nanoparticles supported on carbon or TiO2 are active for selective oxidation of primary sp3 C–H bonds in toluene, showing high selectivity to benzyl benzoate.55 However, they typically operate at high temperature, 160 °C, with high oxygen pressure, 10 bar, with which 51% conversion of toluene and 94% selectivity of benzyl benzoate have been obtained after a long reaction time of 48 h.55 In fact, in thermal heterogeneous catalysis, the activation of saturated sp3 C–H bonds often requires transition metal nanoparticles as a catalyst and relatively harsh reaction conditions. Most recently, Antonietti's group has shown that the nanocomposites of graphene sheets and polymeric carbon nitride are able to function as a metal-free catalyst to activate O2 for the chemoselective oxidation of secondary C–H bonds of cyclohexane, and claimed that this composite material should be useful in overcoming challenges confronted by metal-mediated catalysis.56 However, the harsh reaction conditions, typically high temperature, 150 °C, and high oxygen pressure, 10 bar, are still required for this metal-free catalyst in thermal catalysis.
Semiconductor-based heterogeneous photocatalysis features the unique promising advantages of operation under room temperature and utilization of solar light as the driving source.1–20 In particular, the rapid progress in selective transformation by heterogeneous photocatalysis21–46 presents the possibility of the selective activation of saturated sp3 C–H bonds using molecular oxygen as a benign oxidant and visible light under ambient conditions. The key to realizing this extraordinary potential of such sp3 C–H bonds requires the synthesis or discovery of a visible-light-driven photocatalyst that is both active and highly selective. Furthermore, it is worth noting that, different from the ease of photocatalytic selective oxidation of –CH2OH bonds of alcohols,24–41,46 the visible-light-driven selective oxidation of saturated sp3 C–H bonds is much more difficult, which is perhaps the reason why, to date, efficient and highly selective visible light photocatalysts for the oxidation of such sp3 C–H bonds have not been available in heterogeneous photocatalysis.
Here, we report for the first time the preparation of cubic phase, sheet structured CdS semiconductor samples by a very simple room temperature method. The as-prepared CdS sample is able to be used as a highly selective visible-light-driven photocatalyst toward the activation of saturated primary sp3 C–H bonds in toluene and their substituted analogues, using molecular oxygen as oxidant in the solvent of benzotrifluoride under ambient conditions, i.e., room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The correlation of structure and photoactivity discloses that the photocatalytic performance of CdS for the selective oxidation of such primary sp3 C–H bonds is affected by an integration of assembled factors, including crystalline phase, morphology, surface area and the lifetime of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In conjunction with controlled experiments using electron spin resonance and different radical scavenger techniques, a possible reaction mechanism for the selective oxidation of such primary sp3 C–H bonds in toluene over the CdS photocatalyst has been proposed accordingly. Significantly, our findings strongly suggest that: (i) the highly efficient visible light photocatalyst for selective transformation can be achieved by a simple “chem-is-try” way, besides assembly of the multi-components by “design”. (ii) The fine tuning of the microscopic structure and composition in diverse respects, e.g., size, shape, phase, crystallinity or morphology, provides a very versatile, feasible and general strategy to adjust the photocatalytic performance of a specific semiconductor photocatalyst with tunable photoactivity, regardless of what kind of photocatalytic reaction is targeted.
2. Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation
The chemicals used herein were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). These chemicals are analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Deionized water used in the synthesis was from local sources.
Our CdS samples were prepared by a very simple room temperature method, which guarantees the easy repetition of the catalyst preparation. Typically, cadmium acetate, Cd(Ac)2·2H2O, was dissolved into 200 mL of deionized water and placed in a bath ultrasonicator for 10 min to achieve the desired Cd(Ac)2 (denoted as solution A) concentration (10.0, 5.0, 3.3, 2.5, or 2.0 mM). Sodium sulfide, Na2S·9H2O, was dissolved into 200 mL of deionized water by ultrasonication to obtain the desired Na2S (denoted as solution B) concentration (12.0, 6.0, 4.0, 3.0, or 2.4 mM). Solution B (12.0, 6.0, 4.0, 3.0, or 2.4 mM) was slowly added into solution A (10.0, 5.0, 3.3, 2.5, or 2.0 mM) in a drop-by-drop process for 4 h, and was aged for 36 h with vigorous stirring, respectively. Then, the products were separated by filtration, washed by water, and fully dried at 333 K in oven to get the final CdS products, namely CdS-S1 (Cd2+/S2− = 10.0 mM/12.0 mM), CdS-S2 (Cd2+/S2− = 5.0 mM/6.0 mM), CdS-S3 (Cd2+/S2− = 3.3 mM/4.0 mM), CdS-S4 (Cd2+/S2− = 2.5 mM/3.0 mM), and CdS-S5 (Cd2+/S2− = 2.0 mM/2.4 mM).
For comparison, another three reference CdS samples were also used. Commercial CdS powder was directly supplied from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The other two CdS samples with spherical morphology were prepared as the following.57,58 Synthesis of spherical CdS-1: Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.8 mmol) and L-cysteine (1.6 mmol) were dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water and stirred for 30 min to form the stable cysteine–Cd2+ complexes. The mixture was stirred continuously for 0.5 h to blend completely, and then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with 100 mL capacity. The hydrothermal treatment was conducted at 403 K for 6 h. After that, the products were left to cool at room temperature, separated by centrifugation and washed several times with deionized water until the ion concentration of the supernatant was less than 10 ppm. This was followed by drying at 333 K in oven to obtain the spherical CdS-1 which has a hexagonal phase.57 Synthesis of spherical CdS-2: 0.106 g of Cd(Ac)2·2H2O was dissolved in 40 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by ultrasonication to obtain the homogeneous solution. The mixture was stirred vigorously and then transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The solvothermal treatment was conducted at 453 K for 12 h. After that, the products were cooled at room temperature and separated by centrifugation and washed with absolute ethanol, followed by a dry process at 333 K in oven; the spherical CdS-2 that has a cubic phase was obtained.58
2.2 Catalyst characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The optical properties of the samples were analyzed by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Cary–500, Varian Co.), in which BaSO4 was used as the background. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of the samples was analyzed by nitrogen (N2) adsorption in a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by a field emission SEM on a FEI Nova NANOSEM 230 spectrophotometer. TEM images were obtained using a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab250 spectrometer which consists of a monochromatic Al Kα as the X-ray source, a hemispherical analyzer and sample stage with multi-axial adjustability to obtain the composition on the surface of samples. All of the binding energies were calibrated by the C 1s peak of the surface adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV.
Electron spin resonance (ESR) signal of the radicals spin-trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO, supplied from Sigma Co., Ltd.) was recorded on a Bruker EPR A300 spectrometer.27 In detail, the sample (5 mg) was dispersed in the solvent benzotrifluoride (BTF, 5 mL). Then, 25 μL DMPO/toluene solution (1:10, v/v) was added and oscillated to achieve the well-blended suspension. The visible light irradiation source was a 300W Xe arc lamp system equipped with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm), which is the same light source as for the photoactivity test. The settings for the ESR spectrometer were as follows: center field = 3507 G, microwave frequency = 9.84 GHz and power = 6.36 mW.
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a home made three electrode quartz cell with a PAR VMP3 Multi Potentiotat apparatus. Pt plate was used as counter and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as reference electrodes, while the working electrode was prepared on fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) conductor glass. The sample powder (10 mg) was ultrasonicated in 1 mL anhydrous ethanol to disperse it evenly to get slurry. The slurry was spreading onto FTO glass whose side part was previously protected using Scotch tape. The working electrode was dried overnight under ambient conditions. A copper wire was connected to the side part of the working electrode using conductive tape. Uncoated parts of the electrode were isolated with epoxy resin. The electrolyte was 0.2 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution (pH = 6.8) without additive. The visible light irradiation source was a 300W Xe arc lamp system equipped with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm).
2.3 Catalyst photoactivity
Photocatalytic selective oxidation of toluene and substituted toluenes was performed as the following. Such a standard and identical reaction condition was previously used for photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol.27,32,46,57–60 Typically, toluene (0.1 mmol) and 8 mg catalyst was dissolved in the solvent of benzotrifluoride (BTF, supplied from Alfa Aesar with a purity of >99%)(1.5 mL) saturated with pure molecular oxygen from a gas cylinder.27,32,46,57–60 The choice of BTF solvent is because of inertness to oxidation and high solubility for molecular oxygen.27,32,46,57–60 This mixture was transferred into a 10 mL Pyrex glass bottle filled with molecular oxygen at a pressure of 0.1 MPa and stirred for half an hour to make the catalyst blend evenly in the solution. The suspensions were irradiated by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd.) with a UV-CUT filter (λ > 420 nm). After the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged to completely remove the catalyst particles. The remaining solution was analyzed with an Aglient Gas Chromatograph (GC–7820, with a capillary FFAP analysis column). The assignment of products was confirmed by a Hewlett–Packard gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (HP–5973GC/MS). Controlled photoactivity experiments using different radical scavengers (ammonium oxalate as scavenger for photogenerated holes,61 AgNO3 as scavenger for electrons,62,63 and benzoquinone as scavenger for superoxide radical species64,65) were performed similar to the above photocatalytic oxidation of toluene except that the radical scavengers (0.1 mmol) were added to the reaction system. A recycled photoactivity test on the used catalyst was done as the following. Typically, after the reaction of 10 h under visible light irradiation, the liquid and catalyst were separated by centrifugation. The liquid was decanted, while the used catalyst was washed with anhydrous ethanol and deionized water carefully and then dried in an oven. The fresh liquid, namely toluene and solvent BTF, was mixed with this used catalyst subject to the 2nd run photoactivity testing. In analogy, the recycled 3rd and 4th run photoactivity testing was performed. Conversion, yield and selectivity for selective oxidation of the reactant (toluene, or substituted toluenes) to target product (benzaldehyde, or corresponding substituted benzaldehydes) were defined as follows:Conversion (%) = [(C0 − Cr)/C0] × 100Yield (%) = Cp/C0 × 100Selectivity (%) = [Cp/(C0 − Cr)] × 100Where C0 is the initial concentration of reactant, Cr and Cp are the concentrations of reactant and target product, respectively, at a certain time after the photocatalytic reaction.
3. Results and discussion
To facilitate the discussion, our as-prepared samples by such a very simple room temperature method are denoted as CdS-S1, CdS-S2, CdS-S3, CdS-S4, and CdS-S5, which are prepared by the aqueous solution of Cd(Ac)2versus Na2S corresponding to 10 mM/12 mM, 5 mM/6mM, 3.3 mM/4mM, 2.5 mM/3mM and 2.0 mM/2.4 mM, respectively (for details, see experimental section). Fig. 1a shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared CdS samples, which are widely used to measure the optical properties of semiconductor materials. It can be seen that all of the CdS samples have the visible light absorption capability, which is in agreement with their colours as shown in Fig. 1b. In addition, it should be noted that the as-prepared CdS samples show the band gap narrowing trend, i.e., red shift to higher wavelength, compared with commercial CdS powder, which is evidenced by the plot of transformed Kubelka–Munk function versus the energy of light. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1a, the band gaps of CdS-S1, CdS-S2, CdS-S3, CdS-S4 and CdS-S5 are estimated to be ca. 2.27 eV, 2.25eV, 2.28 eV, 2.31 eV and 2.39 eV, respectively. In contrast, the estimated band gap of commercial CdS powder is ca. 2.46 eV. This red shift in the optical absorption of CdS samples could probably be attributed to the morphology differences of these CdS samples. The variations in the band gap could probably cause a different degree of delocalization and mobility of photoexcited electron–hole pairs, which might then result in a different photocatalytic efficiency. In addition, the narrow band gaps of the CdS samples suggests that they are able to be photoexcited to generate electron–hole pairs by visible light irradiation, thereby triggering chemical redox reactions. Our findings that the as-prepared CdS samples are highly active and selective for the activation of primary C–H bonds in toluene are prompted by the initial photoactivity test on the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol under visible light irradiation. It is found that all of the as-prepared CdS semiconductor samples exhibit extremely high photoactivity toward the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with 100% selectivity under ambient conditions. As shown in Fig. 2, the sample of CdS-S2 particularly shows the best photocatalytic performance among the as-prepared CdS samples. It takes only 40 min to get 99% conversion of benzyl alcohol and 100% selectivity to benzaldehyde. This superior photocatalytic performance is very remarkable in terms of yield rate because, under identical reaction conditions, the photoactivity of CdS-S2 is ca. 20 and 14 times higher than the optimum TiO2–graphene and CdS–graphene photocatalyst, respectively, as reported recently by our group.27,58 This unexpected excellent result consequently prompts us to envision that the as-prepared CdS samples might also be active and highly selective toward the activation of much more inert, saturated primary C–H bonds in toluene under visible light irradiation. It should be stressed that, to date, an efficient and highly selective visible-light-driven photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of such saturated C–H bonds has not been available although the extraordinary importance of selective activation of C–H bonds has been widely recognized in the field of catalysis.47–56

 Fig. 2  Time-online photoactivity of the as-prepared CdS samples toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under visible light irradiation. For comparison, the photoactivity over commercial CdS powder is also shown. 
We have then investigated the photoactivity profile for our CdS samples for selective oxidation of primary C–H bonds in toluene under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3, these CdS photocatalysts are all active in visible light for the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. In terms of yield rate of benzaldehyde, CdS-S2 exhibits the optimum photocatalytic performance. In particular, similar to the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol as discussed above, the 100% selectivity to benzaldehyde can be maintained based on the analysis of gas chromatograph (GC) and gas chromatograph-mass spectra (Fig. S1 in supporting information†). In sharp contrast, commercial CdS and CdS with spherical morphology show very poor photoactivity. To probe the possible deep oxidation after a longer reaction time, we have tested the photocatalytic performance of the optimum CdS-S2 for selective oxidation of toluene by prolonging the visible light irradiation time to 40 h. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the yield of benzaldehyde can be improved when the reaction time is increased. The yield of 66% can still be achieved after the reaction of 40 h. Importantly, in this case, the selectivity of benzaldehyde can be maintained as high as ca. 96%, thus suggesting that CdS-S2 is a highly active and selective visible-light-driven photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of primary C–H bonds in toluene.

To demonstrate the general applicability of the as-prepared CdS photocatalysts for selective oxidation of such primary C–H bonds in alkyl aromatics, we have further tested the visible light photoactivity of CdS-S2 toward the selective oxidation of other substituted toluenes, and the results are listed in Table 1. It is clear to see that the optimum CdS-S2 is also able to be active and highly selective for the oxidation of primary C–H bonds of substituted toluenes to the corresponding aldehydes. The aforementioned photoactivity results strongly suggest that the as-prepared CdS sample, prepared by such a very simple room temperature method, can be used as an efficient, highly regioselective visible-light-driven photocatalyst toward the selective activation of primary C–H bonds in a variety of substituted toluenes. Therefore, it is natural to put forward the following questions. (i) Why does the as-prepared CdS sample show significantly much higher photoactivity than commercial CdS and spherical CdS toward selective oxidation of toluene? (ii) What reasons lead to the photoactivity difference among these CdS samples? (iii) How does the selective oxidation of such C–H bonds happen over these CdS samples? To answer these questions, we have then characterized these samples by a series of joint characterization techniques along with controlled experiments using different radical scavengers, aiming to disclose the structure–photoactivity correlation and the possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism.

Fig. 4 shows the typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-prepared CdS samples, commercial CdS and spherical CdS for comparison. It can be seen that CdS-S1, CdS-S2, CdS-S3, and CdS-S4 have similar surface morphologies and typically feature sheet structure resulting from the accumulation of small CdS nanoparticles. This can be clearly seen by the detailed SEM analysis of CdS-S2 sample, as shown in Fig. 5. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis of CdS-S2, having the optimum photoactivity, further demonstrates that it typically features a sheet structure, as shown in Fig. 6a and b. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in the inset of Fig. 6a suggests the polycrystalline structure nature of CdS-S2. The HRTEM image in Fig. 6c suggests that the sheet structured CdS-S2 sample is comprised of small crystallite particles. Notably, in distinct contrast, CdS-S5 as shown in Fig. 4E seems to be composed of large cubic tetrahedral crystals, indicating that the concentration of aqueous Cd(Ac)2 and Na2S solution plays a significant role in the as-formed morphology of CdS samples. The very low concentration (Cd2+versus S2− = 2.0 mM/2.4 mM) is beneficial for the growth of bigger crystals, which leads to the observation that the morphology of CdS-S5 is remarkably different from CdS-S1, CdS-S2, CdS-S3, and CdS-S4. This is reasonable because the higher concentration leads to increased supersaturation and in turn to an increased number of critical nuclei, which remain smaller during their simultaneous growth.66 As a result, for the samples of CdS-S1, CdS-S2, CdS-S3 and CdS-S4, we do not observe the formation of large cubic crystals as formed in the sample of CdS-S5. It is also worth noting from Fig. 4, that the morphology of as-prepared CdS samples is remarkably different from reference CdS samples, including commercial CdS, spherical CdS-1 and spherical CdS-2. Considering that the photoactivities of our as-prepared CdS samples are significantly much higher than commercial CdS and spherical CdS, it can be roughly concluded that the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene over CdS shows a strong morphology-dependent behaviour. This is understandable because such a morphology-dependent catalytic activity phenomenon has been well recognized in both thermal catalysis67–70 and heterogeneous photocatalytic catalysis including “nonselective” oxidation of pollutants, “selective” oxidation of alcohols and water splitting to H2.26,71–81 Our current results offer the other but significant example that a very simple CdS semiconductor with specific morphology is an efficient and highly visible-light-active photocatalyst for the partial oxidation of inert, primary C–H bonds in alkyl aromatics under ambient conditions. However, note that there is a photoactivity difference among CdS-S1, CdS-S2, CdS-S3, and CdS-S4 although they have similar surface morphologies, which suggests that other factors should be taken into account to explain the photoactivity in detail.

Fig. 7a shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CdS samples. The as-prepared CdS-S1, CdS-S2, CdS-S3, CdS-S4, CdS-S5 all can be ascribed to the same type of cubic phase CdS.82,83 The peaks of scattering angles 2θ values located at ca. 26.5°, 43.9°, and 52.1° are attributed to the diffractions of the (111), (220), and (311) facet crystal planes of cubic CdS, respectively. The diffraction peaks are broad because the crystallite sizes of our CdS nanoparticles are relatively small. This can be evidenced by the estimated average crystallite sizes of different CdS samples using the Scherrer formula for the (111), (220) and (311) facet diffraction peaks. As shown in Table 2, the average crystallite size of CdS particles is about 2.1, 1.9, 2.0, 1.9 and 3.1 nm, corresponding to the CdS-S1, CdS-S2, CdS-S3, CdS-S4 and CdS-S5 samples, respectively. It is clear that the sample of CdS-S5 is comprised of the accumulation of the bigger crystallites. Together with the observation of morphology by SEM analysis in Fig. 4, it can be deduced that the very low concentration of aqueous Cd(Ac)2 and Na2S solution for preparation of CdS-S5 promotes the nucleation of the CdS nanoparticles in an aqueous phase, which is beneficial for the formation of big cubic crystals.

Based on the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms in Fig. 7b, the surface area of CdS-S1, CdS-S2, CdS-S3, CdS-S4, and CdS-S5 is determined to be ca. 98 m2 g−1, 132 m2 g−1, 105 m2 g−1, 64 m2 g−1, and 39 m2 g−1, respectively. Therefore, it seems that the observed photoactivity order, i.e., CdS-S2 > CdS-S3 > CdS-S1 > CdS-S4 > CdS-S5, can be well correlated with the surface area. The highest photoactivity of CdS-S2 is consistent with its highest surface area. However, for commercial CdS featuring a hexagonal phase84,85 based on the XRD analysis in Fig. 7a, although the surface area (ca. 35 m2 g−1) is similar to that of CdS-S5 (ca. 39 m2 g−1), its photoactivity is much lower than CdS-S5. This suggests that, in addition to surface area, the crystalline phase also plays a role in influencing photoactivity. On the other hand, note that spherical CdS-2 has the same cubic phase as our as-prepared CdS samples and a surface area of 56 m2 g−1 that is even higher than that for CdS-S5. However, the photoactivity of spherical CdS-2 is significantly lower than our as-prepared CdS samples. These strongly suggest that all of the parameters, including crystalline phase, surface area and particularly morphology, play an integrative role in influencing the overall photoactivity of CdS for the photocatalytic selective oxidation of toluene under visible light irradiation. Therefore, it is impossible to explain the photoactivity as being mainly attributable to only one factor, but all of the above parameters play a role. The similar integrative influence of assembled structural factors on photoactivity has also been observed for the photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols over TiO2 semiconductors under UV light irradiation.26
In addition, the lifetime of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs is the other important factor that should be taken into account to explain the photoactivity because, according to the principle of semiconductor-based photocatalysis, it is one of the most important key factors affecting the photocatalytic performance, independent of “nonselective” or “selective” redox processes.1–20 Therefore, we have measured the photocurrent transient response of the CdS samples under visible light irradiation as shown in Fig. 8, which reflects the lifetime of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. It can be seen that, with the light switched-on and -off cycles, the optimum CdS-S2 has the highest photocurrent transient response upon visible light irradiation, suggesting the remarkably efficient separation of charge carriers, i.e., electron–hole pairs, as compared to other CdS samples. This is in good agreement with the highest photoactivity of CdS-S2. Whereas it should be noted that the photocurrent transient response over commercial CdS and spherical CdS-2 has no significant difference from the as-prepared CdS-5; however, as mentioned above, the photoactivity of CdS-5 is significantly higher than commercial CdS and spherical CdS samples. It therefore indicates that, in addition to the key factor of the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers, other factors such as crystalline phase and specific surface morphology also play a synergetic role in determining the photocatalytic performance of CdS as a whole. That is, as mentioned above, it is not reasonable to explain the photoactivity of CdS toward the selective oxidation of toluene in terms of only one factor. The observed highest photoactivity of the optimum CdS-S2 can be ascribed to its integrative assembly of specific sheet structure morphology with cubic phase crystallinity, high surface area and efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers upon visible light irradiation.

The photoactivity testing on used CdS-S2 shows this photocatalyst is stable and reusable in the reaction medium of benzotrifluoride (BTF) solvent. As shown in Fig. 9, after a 4 times recycling photoactivity test for the selective oxidation of toluene, the yield of benzaldehyde over used CdS-S2 is similar to that over fresh CdS-S2. To learn if there is change in the bulk and surface composition after the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene, we have characterized the fresh and used CdS-S2 by XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) techniques. As displayed in Fig. S2 (supporting information†), the used CdS-S2 has identical XRD patterns as compared to fresh CdS-S2, indicating no significant change occurred in the bulk phase composition. The contrast XPS results of typical S 2p and Cd 3d spectra with normalized intensity, as shown in Fig. S3 (supporting information†), further demonstrate that the used CdS-S2 has a similar surface composition to that of fresh CdS-S2. Therefore, the as-prepared CdS-S2 semiconductor is a stable visible-light-driven photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of toluene in the reaction medium of BTF solvent under ambient conditions.

To further understand the possible reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic selective oxidation of toluene over the as-prepared CdS photocatalyst, we have performed a series of blank or controlled experiments. Initial blank experiments in the absence of photocatalysts and/or visible light show that no conversion of toluene is observed, indicating that the reaction is really driven by a photocatalytic process. A controlled experiment in nitrogen (N2) atmosphere also shows no conversion of toluene, confirming that oxygen is the primary oxidant in the selective oxidation of toluene. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra, as shown in Fig. 10, prove the presence of superoxide radicals (O2˙−) in the reaction system. Whereas strong and nonselective hydroxyl radicals (·OH) are not observed in the reaction system, which has also been reported for photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols in the BTF solvent.27,32,46,57–60 In addition, the adsorption capacity of benzaldehyde is weaker than toluene over CdS-S2 (Fig. S4, supporting information†), suggesting the target product of benzaldehyde can be easily desorbed from the surface of CdS-S2. All of these factors are beneficial for achieving high selectivity to benzaldehyde for photocatalytic selective oxidation of toluene over the CdS-S2 sample.6,27,32,57–60

Control experiments using different radical scavengers help us to further understand the underlying reaction mechanism of the selective oxidation of toluene over CdS-S2 under visible light irradiation. As shown in entry b in Fig. 11, when the radical scavenger of ammonium oxalate for holes is added,61 the photocatalytic reaction is almost terminated under visible light irradiation. This clearly suggests that the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene over CdS-S2 is driven by photogenerated positive holes. When the radical scavenger, benzoquinone, for superoxide radical species is added into the reaction system,64,65 the photocatalytic reaction is significantly inhibited (entry c in Fig. 11), although a moderate yield of benzaldehyde can still be achieved. A similar and obvious inhibition phenomenon for the photocatalytic reaction is also observed when the AgNO3 scavenger for electrons is added into the reaction system (entry d in Fig. 11).62,63 These experiments indicate that both O2 and O2˙− are the oxidants for photocatalytic selective oxidation of toluene over CdS-S2 under visible light irradiation. In addition, a control experiment using tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) as the radical scavenger for hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) shows that there is almost no change for the conversion of toluene, which is in faithful agreement with the above ESR observation that no hydroxyl radicals are detected in the BTF solvent.27,32,46,57–60

Based on the above experiments, a tentative reaction mechanism for photocatalytic selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde over CdS-S2 can be proposed as the following, as schematically displayed in Fig. 12. Under visible light irradiation, the electron–hole pairs are generated from the photocatalyst of CdS-S2. The adsorbed toluene over the surface of CdS-S2 is able to be oxidized to the corresponding cationic radicals by the positive holes with strong oxidation power. Molecular oxygen (O2) is activated because of its well-known feature of acting as electron-acceptors in heterogeneous photocatalytic systems,6 by which the superoxide radical species (O2˙−) are produced as evidenced by the ESR spectra analysis. These oxygen-containing species (O2 or O2˙−) then are able to selectively oxidize the above toluene cationic radicals, giving rise to the formation of the target product, benzaldehyde. Due to the weaker adsorption capacity of benzaldehyde than toluene over CdS-S2, the target product of benzaldehyde can be easily desorbed from the surface of CdS-S2.

Finally, it should be stressed that the size, shape, phase or morphology dependent behaviour has been well recognized in both heterogeneous photocatalysis and thermal catalysis.26,67–81 The composition difference in size, shape, phase or morphology for semiconductor-based photocatalytic materials will result in different geometric and electronic structures, thus endowing them with distinctive photocatalytic efficiency.26,71–81 This basic concept has promoted increasing efforts to fabricate semiconductor materials with tunable control of size, shape, phase or morphology toward an improved photoactivity for a specific target reaction. In particular, the rapid progress of our capability in the synthesis of advanced materials can help us produce a variety of remarkable semiconductor materials as photocatalyst. However, quite often, one highly efficient photocatalyst for a given reaction can not be simply extended to be active for other specific reactions. This is probably the reason why the highly efficient and selective visible light photocatalyst for the selective activation of more inert C–H bonds has not been reported so far in the field of photocatalytic selective transformation.
Although our increasing knowledge and fundamental in-depth understanding the correlation between structure and activity at the nanoscale enable the catalyst preparation by “design” in some cases, the spelling of chemistry, “chem-is-try”, intrinsically reflects the two sides of its charm, which implies that, sometimes, a highly efficient catalyst with unexpected “routine” morphology can be obtained by a “try” way. Our current discovery of a highly active and selective visible-light-driven photocatalyst of CdS for the selective oxidation of primary C–H bonds in toluene and substituted toluenes can be regarded as an intriguing example in this respect. This work strongly suggests that tuning the microscopic structure and composition in diverse respects, e.g., size, shape, phase, crystallinity or morphology, continues to be a very versatile, feasible and general strategy to adjust the photocatalytic performance of a specific semiconductor photocatalyst with tunable photoactivity.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized a cubic phase CdS semiconductor with specific sheet structure morphology by a simple room temperature method, which is active and highly chemoselective toward the activation of saturated primary sp3 C–H bonds in toluene and its substituted analogues to corresponding aldehydes using molecular oxygen as oxidant under ambient conditions. This represents a first discovery of an efficient and highly selective visible light photocatalyst for the selective activation of sp3 C–H bonds in heterogeneous photocatalysis. The superior photocatalytic performance of CdS is attributed to its unique structure assembly of specific sheet morphology with cubic phase, high surface area, and efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers upon visible light irradiation. The ease of preparation of this CdS semiconductor and its highly active, selective visible light photoactivity for the selective oxidation of quite inert primary C–H bonds in alkyl aromatics points to its promising potential in photocatalytic selective activation of C–H bonds to fine chemicals. In particular, our findings strongly suggest that the superior visible light photocatalyst for the selective transformation can be achieved by a simple “chem-is-try” way. We hope that this work would expand the highly efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts available for selective transformations using solar light as an energy source under ambient conditions, and particularly promote ongoing efforts to synthesize or discover other new types of visible-light-driven photocatalysts for selective activation of C–H bonds.
