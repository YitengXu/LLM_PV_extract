1. Introduction
Solar evaporation has been considered a promising technology to overcome freshwater scarcity because it utilizes an abundant and renewable energy source with minimum environmental impact.1–4 However, in the traditional system, solar irradiation heats up the entire bulk of the water which causes systemic heat losses resulting in low solar vapor conversion efficiency (30–50%), hence still hindering the application of this technology.4–6 Because of the tunable chemical, physical, and mechanical properties, nanomaterials could enhance the solar evaporation performance by rational design of the solar absorber.5,7 A higher solar evaporation efficiency was obtained by dispersing nanoparticles in bulk water, so-called nanofluids or a volumetric system, due to their photothermal properties.8–11 However, volumetric evaporation using nanofluids still suffers from major heat losses during the evaporation process.5,12 To resolve the issue, an interfacial system, in which the solar absorber is placed on the bulk water surface, has been proposed (Fig. 1).3,13–15
 Fig. 1  An illustration of a typical interfacial solar evaporation system with its desired (water vapor) and undesired (radiation, conduction, and convection) heat transfer mechanisms. 
In the solar evaporation system, the solar flux is absorbed and converted into heat by the solar absorber. The generated heat in this system is confined at the interface and used to evaporate water only at the surface, unlike in a volumetric system that heats bulk water. Accordingly, the bulk liquid's temperature beneath the surface can be kept low, thus minimizing the heat loss.5 Furthermore, the generated heat should be transferred entirely to vaporize the water at the water–air interface rather than being lost to the surroundings by conduction, convection, and radiation (Fig. 1). By using this scheme, the efficiency of solar-to-vapor conversion can reach higher than 90%.16–19 Sometimes, a microporous structure with interconnected pores is placed below the solar absorber to limit heat conduction to the underlying water and mechanically support the solar absorber. Wood,20 porous filter paper,21 air-laid paper,22 carbon foam,3 and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes,23 have been applied as the backing layer because of their porous structure, low density and heat-insulating properties.
Numerous studies have been conducted to increase the solar evaporation efficiency by rational design of the solar absorber material structure to meet the requirements for being an ideal light-to-heat converter. Considering an ideal photothermal material, it should have effective solar absorption and efficient light-to-heat conversion rather than radiative re-emission, as well as appropriate thermal management.5 Moreover, photothermal materials for solar evaporation must have the ability to absorb sunlight, not only have broad-range absorption across the solar spectrum but also high absorption intensity for each wavelength. This means that the solar absorber must have high solar absorptance with low transmittance and reflectance in the range from 300 to 2500 nm. On the Earth's surface, the power distribution of solar energy consists of three parts: ∼3% of the total energy in the ultraviolet (UV) region (300–400 nm), ∼45% in the visible range (400–700 nm), and the rest (∼52%) in the near-infrared (NIR) region (700–2500 nm).5,24 To evaluate the performance of solar evaporation, researchers generally use two parameters, which are the water evaporation rate and solar thermal efficiency. The water evaporation rate (kg m−2 h−1) is calculated using eqn (1), (1)where m is the evaporated water mass, A is the surface area of the photothermal layer, and t represents the time.25 The efficiency of solar to vapor generation (η) can be defined as the ratio of enthalpy change in the generated vapor to the total incoming solar flux as presented in eqn (2).2,9 (2)
In eqn (2), hfg is the water's enthalpy of vaporization (2257 J g−1 at 1 atm), and Qi represents the solar flux per area (kW m−2).
To date, metallic and semiconductor nanostructure materials have been applied in solar evaporation systems due to their photothermal properties.20,26–29 Due to their abundant resources, relatively low cost, excellent light absorption over the whole solar spectrum, and high light-to-heat conversion, carbon-based materials have also gained more interest for this application.2,9,15,23,30 For example, Wang et al. demonstrated a conversion efficiency of 71.7% when using hydrophobic carbonized coffee grounds as a solar absorber for desalination and water purification.30
As the youngest in the carbon nanostructure family, carbon dots (CDs) have attracted considerable research attention because of their attractive characteristics.31–33 Their excellent photoluminescence and superior intrinsic catalytic properties make CDs a promising candidate for photocatalytic and dye-sensitized solar cells.31,34 Combining those unique merits with their small size, water solubility, nontoxic properties, and outstanding biocompatibility, CDs have also been utilized in biomedical fields such as biosensing, bioimaging, and drug delivery.35–37 CDs also possess excellent photothermal properties and have been applied in cancer therapy and solar-assisted thermal evaporation. However, compared to other applications, the development of CDs for solar evaporation application is still limited with wide prospects for further development.
This minireview provides a summary of the progress in solar evaporation based on CDs. A brief overview of the mechanism of solar evaporation is described first. Then, the structural design and modification of CDs that might enhance the solar evaporation efficiency will be discussed. Eventually, conclusions and perspectives of CDs employed for solar evaporation are provided. This minireview aims to provide a better understanding of carbon-based solar evaporation and guidelines in designing the nanostructure of CDs employed as solar absorber materials for solar evaporation application.
2. Mechanism of solar evaporation using carbon-based materials
The photothermal effect is a heat generation phenomenon from absorbed light energy. When sunlight is absorbed by photothermal materials, electrons undergo excitation. They produce heat through three different mechanisms, which are: (i) plasmonic localized heating, (ii) nonradiative relaxation of semiconductors, and (iii) thermal vibrations of molecules.1,38
In carbon-based materials, the electron is likely excited from the π to π* orbital since the π bonds have a lower energy gap from their weaker bond compared to the σ-bond. Many conjugated π bonds in graphene-like allotropes facilitate excitation of electrons in almost every solar light irradiation wavelength.5 When electrons absorb sunlight energy, they are excited from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Then, the excited electrons undergo nonradiative relaxation, resulting in the generation or transfer of heat due to atomic lattice vibration (Fig. 2a).39

Many strategies, such as optimizing the absorbance properties of materials or increasing the heat exchange mechanism inside devices while decreasing light reflection and heat losses, have been proposed to increase the efficiency of solar evaporation. Modifying the molecular structure with more conjugated π bonds is one approach to increase light absorption capabilities. The increasing number of π bonds (carbon in sp2 hybridization) could provide a new energy level, which decreases the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO,5 hence increased solar absorption. Besides, a series of new states could also be created due to the interactions between surface groups, such as oxygen related groups, resulting in the nonradiative recombination of photoinduced electrons that quench fluorescence and release heat.40,41
Modifying surface properties such as hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity as well as surface roughness or porosity also plays critical roles in the material engineering system for this application. It has been reported that functionalized graphene absorbers containing hydroxyl (–OH) and carboxyl (–COOH) groups show better solar evaporation efficiency than those without functionalization due to their surface morphology and hydrophilicity.42 The more hydrophilic behavior of carbon materials has an effect on the water meniscus profile at the liquid–air interface.2
Creating nanostructures with pores is another effective approach to reduce light reflection due to the lower effective refractive index of the materials and the incident light's angular dependence.20 Moreover, the pores serve as optical microcavities for confining light through multiple light reflections and scattering, and enhancing the light–material interaction.5 Utilizing biomimetic structures to simulate good capillary and good fluid transport inside the devices could be another approach to increase the overall efficiency of the solar evaporation system.43
Maximizing solar absorbance through thermal concentration and heat localization while minimizing heat loss due to convection, conduction, and radiation is another key element to increase the efficiency in solar thermal systems.14 Heat loss could be suppressed by confining the 2D water path and placing polystyrene foam as shown in Fig. 2b.44 Ni et al. used thermal insulation on both the top and bottom surfaces of the absorber to limit convective loss to the air and to reduce thermal conduction and radiation to the water underneath.14
Numerous carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or other carbon materials, both as single materials or as composites with plasmonic materials or semiconductors, have been studied for solar thermal evaporation.23,28,30,44,45 In the last years, CDs and MXenes also have been applied and have shown good solar evaporation performances.46,47
3. Synthesis, modification, and properties of carbon dots
CDs are zero-dimensional carbon nanomaterials with a diameter below 10 nm. They were found accidentally in 2004 when Xu et al. purified single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs) produced by arc discharge.48 Still, the name of carbon dots appeared in 2006 for fluorescent carbon nanoparticles.49 Along with the significant development of CD research, the terminology of these carbon nanomaterials has altered inconsistently. Cayuela et al.50 proposed the classification of these carbon-based nanoparticles into three classes, as shown in Fig. 3. They classified graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as the crystalline π-conjugated carbon having a sp2 and sp3 hybridized structure with strong quantum confinement behaviour. Despite the pristine graphene structure, GQDs could consist of several carbon layers. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are described as the crystalline carbon structure with a quantum confinement effect and a mixture of sp2 and sp3 carbon structures.

In contrast, carbon dots (CDs) or carbon nanodots (CNDs) have an amorphous carbon framework (mainly the sp3 carbon structure) with a lack of quantum confinement.50 These carbon-based quantum dots have spherical structures, absorb mainly in the UV range, and exhibit fluorescence that could be tailored by controlling their size and surface functional groups.51,52 In this review, we will use the term carbon dots (CDs) for all three types of carbon nanoparticles that have been mentioned before.
Typically, CDs not only consist of carbon atoms but also nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in various atomic ratios.50,52 Besides, CDs also have abundant surface functional groups, including hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, and epoxy groups that can be obtained through controllable chemical treatment.53 These surface functional groups play a crucial role in tailoring their optical properties, especially their absorption properties,54–56 and are of benefit for binding with organic and inorganic moieties.57 Besides, the particles’ hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity could be easily tuned by modifying the surface functional groups to meet the thermodynamic stability requirements for applications. Furthermore, as a consequence of the various atoms in the carbon structure, the hybridization degree of carbon-based nanoparticles could also tailor their optical properties.50,58 For solar conversion applications, broad absorption in the solar radiation range is preferable to enhance the conversion efficiency. Then, the synthesis method of CDs focusing on the decoration of surface functional groups would be discussed in detail.
Various synthesis methods to prepare CDs have been developed extensively. Based on the carbon-based raw materials, there are two major synthesis methods: top-down and bottom-up approaches. Top-down approaches, which comprise arc discharge, laser ablation, electrochemical synthesis, or chemical oxidation, involve breaking down the structure of higher dimensional carbon-based materials into a nanoscale carbon-based particle through a physical or chemical process.59,60 The most common raw materials for these approaches are graphite and carbon nanotubes, owing to their sp2 or sp3 hybridized C–C bonds. Regardless of their highly uniform size and excellent optical properties, this approach consumes high energy and its production cost hinders scaled-up production for commercial applications.
The bottom-up approach is a more suitable synthesis for the application of solar evaporation. It corresponds to a low-cost and environmentally friendly process and the possibility to modify the structure with relatively good optical properties. This approach utilizes low-dimensional carbon sources (e.g., citric acid, glucose, and polymers). The raw materials are converted into nanosized carbon particles through a carbonization and polymerization process. Among various bottom-up approaches (e.g., microwave-assisted, hydrothermal/solvothermal, thermal decomposition and ultrasonic treatment),61–64 the hydrothermal method is a desirable method to prepare CDs for various applications.
Since 2014, our group has been developing CDs based on the hydrothermal method using citric acid and urea extensively.54,55,62,65–68 Mostly, the hydrothermal method was selected to synthesize CDs as shown in Fig. 4a. In brief, citric acid (0.0042 mmol L−1) was reacted with urea (0.25 mol L−1) in pure water at room temperature. Then, the precursor solution was transferred into a hydrothermal reactor. Basically, the hydrothermal method utilizes the chemical reaction of raw materials in water as a solvent at high temperature (140–200 °C) and high pressure (up to 1 MPa) for 180 min. By adjusting and controlling the experimental conditions, various CDs with tunable optical properties could be obtained. The detailed experimental conditions are explained elsewhere.54,55,62,65

The formation of a carbon structure was strongly directed by the precursor concentration, and the heating rate follows the first-order kinetic reactions.62 Interestingly, a systematic evaluation of the CDs’ structural formation based on these elapsed time samples revealed that the C–N configurations on the carbon core structure play a crucial role in the optical properties instead of the surface functional groups.54 Previous work in our lab demonstrated that CDs obtained by modifying the carbon structure with pyrrolic-N exhibited near-infrared absorption.55,66 As shown in Fig. 4b, the as prepared CDs exhibited strong absorption in the near-infrared range centered at 650 nm. It is worth noting that the main absorption of common CDs is limited in the UV to near-visible light range. Surprisingly, these CDs showed a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 54.2% under irradiation with a 655 nm laser with a power density of 1.2 W cm−2.55
Furthermore, composites of CDs with organic or inorganic materials exhibited more attractive photophysical properties rather than single CDs due to their heterostructure.76 When coupled with semiconductor materials, CDs can act not only as electron donors but also as electron acceptors.77 As a response to absorbed light energy, the generated electron–hole pairs could transfer energy in the form of phonons and quench radiative recombination in CDs (Fig. 4c).70 In addition, the interaction between surface functional groups (e.g., oxygen-related groups) in the assembly of CDs always creates new energy levels at the interface state, and thus nonradiative recombination will occur (Fig. 4d).41,51 As aforementioned, the properties of CDs meet the requirement for solar evaporation applications and will be discussed in detail in the next section.
4. Recent development of carbon dots for solar evaporation
To date, CDs have been reported as photothermal materials for laser-assisted cancer therapy.35,41,61 However, the utilization of CDs in solar evaporation was not reported until mid 2017.2 This could be due to their amorphous structure and their absorbance which is mainly in the UV region. In the last years, several researchers have demonstrated the utilization of CDs for solar thermal evaporation and reported incredible performances, as summarized in Table 1. As a comparison, other carbon-based materials with different system parameters are also presented.

The crystalline structure of carbon-based materials has the advantages of electronic and phononic energy transport78,79 and could minimize exciton or phonon loss by scattering.69 Pal et al. reported that doping amorphous CDs with phosphorus could alter the crystallinity of CDs and achieve the maximum crystalline nature with a phosphoric acid concentration of 11.1% (w/w) as shown in Fig. 5a and the proposed P-doped CD structure is shown and represented as a ball-and-stick model in Fig. 5b.69 Using the volumetric system, they irradiated nanofluids of N,S,P-CDs with a laser source (2 W, 808 nm IR laser) and found that the solar evaporation efficiency of P-doped CDs was 83.6%, whereas that of N,S-CDs was only 44.2%.

CD-based materials have also been employed in interfacial solar evaporation systems, resulting in higher efficiency than when using volumetric systems.46,70,71 Hou et al.70 reported a remarkable efficiency (92.5%) and evaporation rate (2.3 kg m−2 h−1) using CDs on pre-processed balsa wood. This result showed much better photothermal conversion performance than that of CNTs on balsa wood in which their efficiency was only 65% at 1 kW cm−2.43 Besides, CDs on cellulose paper showed a flexible structure and excellent deformation tolerance that can be twisted, folded, and bent (Fig. 6a–b), recover to flatness after being screwed up into a ball (Fig. 6c), have strong wear resistance (Fig. 6d), and are mechanically stable towards sonication (Fig. 6e), which is beneficial for packing and transportation.72 Modification of the surface functional groups of CDs could alter the solar evaporation efficiency. Hou et al.70 also demonstrated that hydroxyl groups contribute to a high solar-to-vapor efficiency compared to carbonyl and carboxylic acid groups due to the stronger hydrogen bonds in hydroxyl groups than the other two groups.

Another innovative water purification approach based on carbon dots is when CDs are embedded within a CMC/chitosan hydrogel framework.71 In this composite, CDs acted as a photothermal mediator in the system, converting solar irradiation to dissipated heat, which efficiently raised the temperature of hydrogel-absorbed water. As a result, an energy conversion efficiency of 89% and a water evaporation rate of 1.4 kg m−2 h−1 were obtained under a solar illumination of 1 kW m−2. Embedded CDs within the hydrogel matrix contribute to enhancing the hydrogel's stability and mechanical strength of the hydrogel matrix through cross-linking between the surface moieties of the CDs and the hydrogel framework. It was confirmed by the high water recovery efficiency (above 85%) even after more than 50 cycles.71
Despite using single-component materials, Zheng et al.46 investigated hybrid solar absorber materials comprising plasmonic nanoparticles, semiconductors, and biomass-derived CDs to construct Au@Bi2MoO6-CD heterostructures. A hybrid material was synthesized by wrapping plasmonic Au nanobipyramids (NBPs) with 3D Bi2MoO6 spheres and decorating it with CDs to construct a coral-like structure (Fig. 7a–c). Remarkably, they found that Au@Bi2MoO6-CD composites showed a photothermal conversion efficiency of 97.1% under one sun with a water evaporation rate of 1.69 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. 7d). This outstanding efficiency was attributed to the 3D heterostructure that offered numerous active cavities supported by light's multiple internal reflections. Another biomimetic design of a carbon-based solar evaporator was reported by Tu et al. that imitated the structure of natural leaves.73

Another hybrid material based on carbon dots was also reported by Xue et al.74 that used CD decorated black titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotube array@Ti foam (CDs/black TNA@Ti). In this hybrid material, the surface functional groups in CDs interacted with the surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 resulting in Ti–O–C bonds between TiO2 and CDs,80 and these Ti–O–C bonds can create new energy levels between the conduction and valence bands of TiO2 and CDs.81 With this 3D hybrid structure, Xue et al. obtained a water evaporation rate and solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 1.8 kg m−2 h−1 and 55.3%, respectively.74
To meet the real-world demand, several researchers have demonstrated additional applications of CD-based solar absorbers for water remediation and desalination (Fig. 7e–i).46,71,73 A CD-based evaporator was reported to have the ability to produce drinkable water by removing several ions such as Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+ from seawater.46,73 Besides, great results were also reported by Singh et al. when using CD/hydrogel to remove heavy metal ions, detergents, and organic dyes, resulting in values close to pure drinkable water.71
5. Conclusions and perspectives
Carbon dots (CDs) as photothermal materials for solar evaporation have gained attention due to their unique optical properties, tunable structure, surface functionalization, and hydrophilicity, as well as easy production and modification. The intense study of CD-based solar evaporation will result in potential applications in the future. This minireview summarized recent advances and design strategies of CD-based solar evaporation, allowing us to take a closer look at the structure and surface group modification of CDs. Phosphorus doping to CDs could alter CDs’ crystallinity in promoting phonon transport and minimizing phonon scattering in the solar absorber. In addition, oxygen-related functional groups on the surface of CDs, especially hydroxyl, play a significant role in increasing the solar-to-vapor efficiency. Preparing a 3D structure of hybrid materials using CDs and plasmonic metals or semiconductors also offered new insights into minimizing light reflection by numerous active cavities. As a result, high photothermal efficiencies of more than 85% have been achieved for CD-based solar evaporation.
Even so, there are some fundamental issues related with structure and engineering design of CDs as solar absorber material for the future practical applications. For instance, oxygen related groups on the surface and doping heteroatoms or ions in CDs not only change the energy band structure and heat generation but also influence the crystallinity and wetting properties of CDs. However, the exact roles of doping and surface functional groups in photothermal mechanisms still need further understanding. Predicting some parameters such as specific heat capacity, reflectance, or solar-to-vapor efficiency through computational models or simulation could stimulate challenges to explore the potential of CDs like others did.11,82
Another concern that needs to be well understood when employing CDs in solar evaporation is about the effect and relationship between the fluorescence properties of CDs and heat generated in CDs during the photothermal mechanism. Besides, optimizing the structure through decorating CDs in 3D or 2D structures could become a research focus for the enhancement of efficiency. Moreover, several properties of materials such as (i) salt resistance,83,84 (ii) superhydrophilicity,85 and (iii) floatability86,87 are well explored in other carbon-based solar evaporation systems to increase their performances but are still not applied to CDs. Also, there is a need to study further the extended applications of CD-based solar evaporation, such as for electricity generation or water remediation and desalination like others did,88–90 in addition to clean water production.
