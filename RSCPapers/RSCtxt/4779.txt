    , Accepted 27th August 2019First published on 28th August 2019AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) photocatalysts have been widely studied due to their short charge carrier migration pathways and tunable electronic structures. Herein, a facile one-pot solvothermal process with ethylamine (ea) constructs a novel 2D nanojunction based on ZnSe. The ea molecules coordinate with Zn2+ to form 2D ZnSe(ea)x, where the consequent 2D ZnSe grows in an epitaxial way resulting in the self-assembled 2D/2D ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x nanojunctions driven by van der Waals (VDW) force, which largely extend the absorption range. The atomic thickness of the 2D structure offers a short charge migration pathway, low electric resistance and rich active sites for the surface reaction of photocatalysis. All the above favorable factors work synergistically to reach a superior hydrogen evolution of 2875 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation (≥420 nm) and a notable quantum yield of 64.5% at 450 nm, which are among the highest recorded values of non-noble metal photocatalysts.
1. Introduction
Highly efficient conversion of solar energy into hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting has received considerable attention due to the increasing demand for renewable and clean energy. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop environmentally friendly, high-efficiency and Earth-abundant photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Numerous artificial photocatalysts based on semiconductors have been developed for water splitting.1 The main obstacles of photocatalysts include weak light absorption, high possibility of photo-generated charge carrier recombination, long charge migration pathways, and insufficient active sites on the surface. Two-dimensional (2D) materials show the intrinsic advantages for photocatalysts, including a tunable absorption edge by a quantum confinement effect2–4 or chemical doping,5–10 a short carrier migration distance due to an ultrathin structure, high specific surface areas for numerous active sites and so on.11–14 Diverse semiconductors including the chalcogenide family have been developed as 2D photocatalysts.15–19
Among II–VI binary chalcogenides, ZnSe is a promising Earth-abundant semiconducting photocatalyst due to its advantages including the absence of noble or heavy metals, environment friendliness with a direct band gap of 2.7 eV,20 high absorption coefficient, low cost, etc. The 2D ZnSe materials, such as nanosheets,21 nanoplates,22 and nanoflakes,23 have been synthesized with the assistance of organic amines. The ultrathin 2D structure can supply a huge specific surface area and a large amount of low-coordinated surface atoms as active sites favourable for photocatalysis.24–28 Due to the ultra-thin thickness, the charge migration distance is reduced. However, they still exhibit low efficiency for the HER, mainly because of the high recombination rate of the photo-generated charge carriers and the enlarged bandgap due to the quantum confinement effect. These two issues are common problems for 2D materials; therefore, a novel design for 2D HER photocatalysts is urgently required.
In this study, distinguished from the traditional 2D ZnSe or ZnSe–organic amine hybrid materials, a novel van der Waals (VDW) nanojunction based on 2D ZnSe and ZnSe(amine)x materials is constructed through a one-pot solvothermal process, where ethylamine (ea) is the best organic amine for the highest HER rate. TEM/HRTEM characterization confirms the 2D/2D morphology of ZnSe and ZnSe(ea)x. Furthermore, XPS spectra demonstrate that the ea molecules strongly coordinate with ZnSe to endow ZnSe(ea)x with a distorted lattice. Consequently, the absorption spectrum and the Tauc plot of the VDW nanojunction show the red-shift absorption edge and narrower band gap. Theoretically, density functional theory (DFT) calculations also support the narrower bandgap arising from the ea coordination. Additionally, the nanojunction between ZnSe and ZnSe(ea)x is established and it synergistically improves the photocatalytic HER performance, including a longer life-time of photo-generated charge carriers, a higher possibility of charge separation, lower electrical resistance, and a shorter charge migration pathway. As a result, the optimized VDW ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x nanojunction produces hydrogen at a rate of up to 2875 μmol h−1 g−1 and a notable quantum yield of 64.5% at 450 nm, which are among the highest recorded values of non-noble metal photocatalysts. Our strategy could be universal in constructing novel 2D/2D VDW nanojunction photocatalysts for the II–VI binary chalcogenide family.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Ethylamine (ea, 70%, aqueous solution), propylamine (pa, 99%, aqueous solution), and hexylamine (ha, 99%, aqueous solution) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Se (99.999%), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (97%), sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O) and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China. All the above chemicals were used as received.
2.2. Preparation of a 2D/2D ZnSe/ZnSe(amine)x (amine: ea, pa and ha, respectively) VDW nanojunction
The synthesis was carried out by a one-pot solvothermal reaction. In the typical procedure, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol) and Se powder (0.5 mmol) were weighed and transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL of capacity) and mixed with the amines (ea, pa and ha). The autoclave was then sealed in an oven for solvothermal reaction at 120 °C for six days. The as-prepared products were washed with 95% ethanol, 30% ethanol, and distilled water, respectively, and annealed at 100 °C for 1 hour in a tubular furnace under a N2 atmosphere. Finally, the resulting powder was used as a VDW nanojunction for characterization and photocatalytic activity tests.
2.3. Preparation of 2D ZnSe nanosheets
After annealing the as-prepared 2D/2D ZnSe/ZnSe(amine)x VDW nanojunction at 550 °C for 1 hour under a N2 atmosphere, the products of 2D ZnSe nanosheets were attained for further characterization.
2.4. Materials characterization
The morphology, composition and structure of the as-prepared 2D ZnSe and 2D/2D ZnSe/ZnSe(amine)x VDW nanojunction were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, TECNAI), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI Nova 450 Nano), atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Dimension FastScan), X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert Pro, PAN analytical), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALab250). Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer Diamond TG/DTA6300 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. Room temperature UV-visible diffuse spectra were collected using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating-sphere accessory. Room temperature time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a 340 nm laser (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd EPL-340). For AFM measurements, the samples were dropped on a 300 nm-SiO2/Si substrate and dried at room temperature.
2.5. Photocatalytic measurement
The photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments were carried out in a 200 ml Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed glass gas circulation system with a vacuum pump (Labsolar-III (AG), Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd, China). In a photocatalytic reaction, 50 mg of the as-prepared photocatalyst powder was suspended in 100 ml aqueous solution containing 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M Na2SO3, and then sonicated for a few hours (0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 h). The photocatalytic reaction was performed using a 300 W Xe-lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter. Before irradiation, the whole system maintains vacuum to avoid contact with air. The amount of H2 produced during the photocatalytic reaction was determined by gas chromatography (Techcomp, GC7900) (TCD detector, 5 Å molecular sieve column) for every hour.
2.6. Photo-electrochemical test
The photocurrent measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (Zennium E, Zahner, Germany) equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp providing simulated solar light irradiation under a bias voltage of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode. Electrochemical Impedance Spectra (EIS) were also recorded on the same workstation and measured in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV in darkness. The photocurrent and EIS measurements were carried out on a conventional three-electrode cell in 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution. The working electrode was prepared by spin-coating (1500 rpm, 30 s) the ethanol dispersion of the prepared catalysts onto a cleaned FTO glass substrate and then drying at 140 °C for 1 h in a vacuum drying oven. The reference electrode and the counter electrode were a Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl) and Pt flake, respectively.
2.7. The apparent quantum efficiency test
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was detected using three light emitting diodes at centered wavelengths of 450, 500 and 550 nm, respectively. The light intensity was confirmed using an optical power meter (CEL-NP 2000, China). The irradiation area and the photocatalytic reaction time were limited to 153.86 cm2 and 1 hour, respectively. The calculation of the AQE was according to the formulation: AQE = (100% × Ne)/Np = (2 × M × NA × h × c)/(S × P × t × λ), where Ne, Np, M, NA, h, c, S, P, t and λ stand for the amount of reaction electrons, the incident photons, the amount of H2 molecules, the Avogadro constant, the Planck constant, the speed of light, the irradiation area, the intensity of the irradiation, the photoreaction time, and the wavelength of the monochromatic light, respectively.
3. Discussion
3.1. Preparation and structural characterization of the ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x nanojunction
The synthesis process is illustrated in Fig. 1A. Considering previous reports of similar work,29–31 first, the ea molecules self-assemble into 2D aggregates, which behave as templates for 2D [Zn(ea)x]2+ due to the coordination between Zn2+ and ea molecules (reaction (1)). Simultaneously, ea molecules dissolve the element Se with reduction of Se into Se2− (reaction (2)). Considering the richness of ea in the 2D templates and their strong coordination to Zn2+, the 2D ea templates show priority to 2D ZnSe(ea)x, and then the Zn2+ ions are available to form ZnSe. Considering a similar chemical composition and crystalline lattice between ZnSe and ZnSe(ea)x, 2D ZnSe(ea)x behaves as a new template for the sequent in situ ZnSe growth. Therefore, the 2D/2D ZnSe(ea)x/ZnSe VDW nanojunction was constructed (reaction (3)). The hydrothermal reactions are shown below: Zn2+ + xea + Se2− → ZnSe(ea)x(1) (2) ZnSe(ea)x + Zn2+ + Se2− → ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x(3)

(B–D and E–G) TEM, HRTEM, and FFT images of the ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x VDW nanojunction and pure 2D ZnSe nanosheets (blue circle: ZnSe; yellow circle: ZnSe(ea)x in D and G). 
Being different from the earlier reported 2D ZnSe–organic amine hybrids,32 our Se source has a hexagonal structure and is in pure gray form (Fig. S1†) with a solvothermal temperature of 120 °C. We believe that the Se source and solvothermal temperature may be the subtle factors causing an impact on the final product.
The TEM image displays a typical 2D structure of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x (Fig. 1B), and two sets of lattice spacing which are attributed to ZnSe and ZnSe(ea)x, respectively. The overlapping of two lattice fringes results in a clear Moiré fringe pattern (Fig. 1C). In Fig. S2,† compared with pure ZnSe, the (001) peak of ZnSe(ea)x obviously shifts toward a lower angle, indicating the expansion of the lattice along the c-axis. In Fig. 1D, the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) clearly exhibits the characteristic lattice structures of ZnSe and ZnSe(ea)x.33 The above results support the structure of the 2D/2D ZnSe(ea)x/ZnSe VDW nanojunction. By annealing the nanojunction powder at 550 °C for 1 hour under a N2 atmosphere, ea in ZnSe(ea)x was removed and the remaining compound was proven to be pure 2D ZnSe (Fig. S3†), where TEM shows the 2D morphology (Fig. 1E) and HRTEM confirms the typical ZnSe lattice (Fig. 1F and G).
XPS measurement was carried out to analyze the chemical composition and chemical state of the ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x nanojunction powder. As shown in Fig. 2A, the XPS survey spectrum confirms the presence of Zn, Se, and N elements. In Fig. 2B, the N 1s XPS spectrum is deconvoluted into 4 peaks: a major peak at 401.2 eV attributed to –N+– (partially positive charge on N, oxidation state), a smaller peak at 399.3 eV attributed to the typical N 1s binding energy of the amine (–NH2), a peak at 398.5 eV within the region of the zinc nitride complex indicating the chemical shift from N atom coordination, and the smallest peak at 400.2 eV attributed to the –NH– group.34–36 From the peak area ratio in XPS spectra, the large peak area of –N+– indicates the important role of the reduction of ea, proving the reduction of Se to Se2− in the reaction (2). All the above XPS N 1s information indicates that the ea behaves as a reducer and the final product contains original ea molecules and the corresponding oxidized species. The Se 2s peak (Fig. 2C) could be well fitted with Se in pure ZnSe at a single chemical state. The complete absence of the O 1s peak further excludes the presence of ZnO. The Zn 2p3/2 peak is deconvoluted into two peaks at 1022.5 and 1020.9 eV corresponding to typical Zn2+ in ZnSe and ZnSe(ea)x, respectively. It is reasonable that the N atoms of ea strongly coordinate to Zn2+, featuring a chemical shift from the typical Zn 2p peak in the XPS spectrum.37 From the deconvoluted peak area, the molar ratio between coordinated and non-coordinated Zn is calculated as 0.205 (Fig. 2D, Table S1†).

Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) further characterizes the composition of the ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x VDW nanojunction as shown in Fig. 3. A 11.20% weight loss of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x occurred during the annealing step from 100 to 550 °C under a N2 atmosphere, which is attributed to the loss of ea molecules. The composition of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x was determined as ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34. Besides, when the propylamine (pa) replaced ea, the product was determined as ZnSe/ZnSe(pa)2.17, as shown in Table S1, Fig. S4 and S5.† All the molar ratios of coordinated amines to Zn are higher than an earlier reported value (0.5 or 1), indicating that the strong coordination and multiple ligands in our study could be the factors causing an impact on the electronic structure and therefore narrowing the corresponding band gap.

3.2. Optical and electronic properties of the ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x nanojunction
As a result of the quantum confinement effect, the 2D materials usually possess a wider band gap than the bulk materials, leading to a light absorption edge blue shift and being unfavorable for light harvest. In Fig. 4A, our VDW nanojunctions of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34 exhibit an obvious red-shifted absorption edge compared with the 2D pure ZnSe, which extends the light absorption range and favors the photocatalytic efficiency. This could be attributed to organic molecules connected with the surface of ZnSe by covalent bonding.38 Using the Tauc plot (Fig. 4B), the absorption edge of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34 VDW nanojunctions and 2D ZnSe are estimated at 2.35 and 2.88 eV, respectively. The energy levels of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34 VDW nanojunctions match well with the theoretical photocatalytic potentials for the HER.

(C) UPS spectra of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34. (D) Band structure diagram for the as-obtained ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34 nanojunction. 
Using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) with He I (21.22 eV) gas, the Ev (the valence band energy) of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34 was calculated as 4.83 eV by subtracting the width of the He I UPS spectra (Fig. 4C) from the excitation energy (21.22 eV). The conduction band energy (Ec) was estimated as 2.46 eV from Ev − Eg (Eg = 2.37 eV vs. vacuum, i.e. −2.13 eV vs. RHE). In the HER photocatalytic process, the conduction band-edge position of the semiconducting catalyst should be higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2. Fig. 4D further shows that the reduction potential of H+/H2 (0 V vs. RHE) is located below the conduction band of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34, which meets the matching energy levels and permits electron transfer from ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34 to H+ for the HER.
Density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 5, Fig. S6†) were carried out to simulate the influence of coordination of ea molecules on the band gap of ZnSe. The optimized unit cells for bulk ZnSe and ZnSe(ea)x are shown in Fig. 5A and B, respectively. The electronic structure of ZnSe(ea)x was calculated from density of states (DOS). The theoretical results show that, with coordination to ea, the band gap of ZnSe is decreased from 2.87 to 2.54 eV (Fig. 5C), leading to a red-shift of the onset absorption edge. Thus the consequent 2D/2D ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x nanojunction can exhibit a red-shift absorption edge. Thereby, we conclude that the optical absorption can be changed by introducing strong coordination.

From the time-resolved photoluminescence spectrum, the fluorescence lifetime of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34 VDW nanojunctions was measured as 138.5 ns, which is about two times longer than that of 2D pure ZnSe (36.2 ns), shown in Fig. 6A. The photogenerated electrons with long lifetime can facilitate surface reaction and thus give rise to enhanced photocatalytic activity. EIS was carried out to characterize the electrical resistance.39,40 As shown in Fig. 6B, the EIS Nyquist plot of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34 VDW nanojunctions shows a significantly smaller arc radius than that of 2D ZnSe, indicating the lower electric resistance. We suppose that there is a ballistic pathway along some direction of VDW nanojunctions to enable faster charge migration than that in 2D materials.

3.3. Photocatalytic activities of the ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x nanojunction
The HER experiments were carried out under visible light irradiation (≥420 nm) from the 300 W Xe lamp with an AM1.5 filter with a Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial agent. ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x VDW nanojunctions exhibit a remarkable H2 evolution of 3219 μmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 6C), which is ∼71 times higher than that of 2D ZnSe, mainly due to a narrower band gap and more efficient charge separation/migration. Different alkyl amines, including ea, propylamine (pa), and hexylamine (ha), were employed to investigate the impact of the alkyl chains on the HER activity. In Fig. 6D, the HER photocatalytic activities with different amines are arranged in the order of ea > pa > ha. The ea molecules exhibit the best HER performance. The polarity and length of the amine molecules are supposed to play important roles in the photocatalytic HER with the ZnSe/ZnSe(amine)x VDW nanojunctions.
During the solvothermal synthesis process of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x VDW nanojunctions, the reaction time greatly affects the ratio of ZnSe(ea)x to ZnSe in the final VDW nanojunctions and their HER performance. Varying the solvothermal reaction times as 3, 6 and 10 days, the molar ratios of ZnSe(ea)x to ZnSe are 0.60, 0.56 and 1.1, and the corresponding H2 production rates are 1161, 3219 and 382 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively (Fig. 6E). Decreasing the thickness greatly increases the number of active sites and shortens the migration pathway, which will enhance the photocatalytic activity. We applied ultrasonication treatment to further exfoliate the obtained ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34 VDW nanojunctions for a thinner 2D morphology. As shown in Fig. 6F, a longer ultrasonication time leads to a higher H2 evolution rate (453, 1150, 1200, 1275, 1573, and 3219 μmol g−1 h−1 corresponding to 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h, respectively). It is reasonable for the thinner thickness and shorter charge migration pathway.
With the transient photocurrent responses, VDW nanojunctions synthesized solvothermally over 6 days demonstrate the highest photocurrents (Fig. 7A), consistent with the above speculation of the lowest electrical resistance (Fig. 7B). The atomic force microscopy images (Fig. 8) further reveal that the thickness decreases from 37 to 8 nm when the ultrasonic post-treatment time is increased from 0.5 to 8 h.

The cycling stability and wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)2.34 catalyst with a H2 evolution rate of 2875 μmol g−1 h−1 were determined. The four cycles for 12 h did not obviously diminish the HER activity level (3 h per cycle, Fig. 9A), indicating its high stability against light-corrosion. We calculated the AQE as 64.5% at λ = 450 nm, 22.0% at λ = 500 nm and 11.2% at λ = 550 nm, respectively. The wavelength for the highest AQE value is 450 nm, matching the absorption band edge of 2D ZnSe (Fig. 9B). Here, both ZnSe and ZnSe(ea)x could be excited and the VDW nanojunction works as a S-scheme junction to offer this superior efficiency. Moreover, the AQE of 64.5% at λ = 450 nm is among the highest values of non-noble metal catalysts reported so far (Table S2†).41–48

In the transient photocurrent spectra (Fig. 9C), the ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x VDW nanojunctions exhibit a higher light/dark current ratio than that in 2D pure ZnSe, indicating more efficient charge separation. These photo/electrochemical studies confirm the enhancement of the photocharge separation and migration in ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x, resulting in significant performance of photocatalytic H2 evolution. As shown in Fig. 9D, the ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x nanojunction can be a S-scheme heterojunction (the potential values were obtained from Fig. 4D and Fig. S7†) with the corresponding electronic structure.49–51 Under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) illumination, the electrons in both ZnSe and ZnSe(ea)x parts are excited to their conduction band (CB). Owing to the CB position of ZnSe and ZnSe(ea)x shown in Fig. 9D, the electrons in the ZnSe(ea)x CB band migrate to the ZnSe CB band, resulting in the internal electric field (the electric field pointing from ZnSe(ea)x to ZnSe), with regard to the S-scheme mechanism. This internal electric field facilitates the charge separation significantly: electrons in the CB of ZnSe can transfer to the VB of ZnSe(ea)x and the holes remain at the VB of ZnSe. The electrons at the VB of ZnSe(ea)x continue to be excited and accumulate at the CB of ZnSe(ea)x, which eventually captures H+ to produce H2.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully constructed a 2D/2D VDW nanojunction of ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x with high HER activity and stability by a one-pot solvothermal method. The mechanism of VDW nanojunction formation is based on the ZnSe(ea)x nanosheet growth on the self-assembled template of ea and the sequent in situ epitaxial growth of ZnSe on readily synthesized ZnSe(ea)x nanosheets through van der Waals force. The N atom of ea strongly coordinates in the ZnSe(ea)x lattice and reduces the bandgap of 2D ZnSe(ea)x and the ZnSe/ZnSe(ea)x VDW nanojunction. This VDW nanojunction exhibits a superior photocatalytic H2 evolution of 2875 μmol g−1 h−1, comparable with noble-metal loaded C3N4 catalysts under the same test conditions. This significantly high photocatalytic activity originates from the wide light harvesting range, longer photo-carrier lifetime, more efficient charge separation, lower electronic resistance and shorter charge transfer pathway based on the 2D/2D VDW nanojunction structure. This non-noble metal 2D/2D VDW nanojunction is a promising candidate among the environmentally friendly, low-cost, highly efficient photocatalysts and this one-pot solvothermal method may be suitable for diverse raw materials.
