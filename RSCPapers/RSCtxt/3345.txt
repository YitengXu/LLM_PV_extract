    , Accepted 3rd November 2016First published on 3rd November 2016AbstractOrganic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have led to remarkable advancements in emerging photovoltaics. The rapid increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been mainly achieved by improving perovskite morphology and crystallinity. Herein, we report a simple and effective means to improve perovskite grain sizes using a porous hole transport layer (i.e., PEDOT:PSS in this work). We used polystyrene nanospheres as a sacrificial template to fabricate the porous-PEDOT:PSS. The growth of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film on the porous-PEDOT:PSS substrate yields a dramatic improvement in crystallinity and an enhancement in perovskite grain sizes. When the porous structure was applied as a hole transport layer in PSCs with planar heterojunction structures, the efficiency was significantly enhanced from 15.33% for the planar device to 17.32%. This simple method for enhancing perovskite morphology and crystallinity paves the way for its application to other device architectures for enhanced photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising candidates for future photovoltaic systems because of their rapidly promoted power conversion efficiency (PCE), comparable to the level of Si-based solar cells, which is available from inexpensive and high-throughput solution processes.1–8 Since perovskite photovoltaics were introduced in 2009 by Kojima et al.,9 within a short period of time, the certified PCE of PSCs has exceeded 22%.10
For the present PSCs, two representative schemes have been generally accepted, i.e., mesoscopic and planar heterojunction architectures. For the former structure, its structural features seem to derive from the architecture of conventional dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), where a layer based on mesoscopic metal oxide (e.g. TiO2) is universally preferred. Many studies with mesoscopic PSCs also contributed to high PCEs.1–3,9 However, applying and popularizing the technique is limited due to the high temperature treatment (typically T > 450 °C) in the process of the formation of the mesoporous structure. Instead, because of employing a more cost-effective full-solution route without any high-temperature treatment, the latter structure can provide an effective route to fabricate flexible PSCs.5,6,10 To obtain better characteristics of planar PSCs, different groups have shown that the fabrication of perovskite films with good morphologies, excellent surface coverage and minimal pinholes is the most efficient way.11,12 Many important factors about the charge behaviour in a PSC device, e.g., transport, dissociation, and diffusion length, have been shown to be closely related to the process of perovskite crystallinity.13,14 However, the crystallization process in turn highly depends on some influencing factors, e.g., film-forming methods, components, interface engineering (surface chemistry, hydrophilic degree, surface texture and so on), solvents and additives.15–17
Several groups have reported high performance perovskite films with large grain sizes that have been shown to increase the efficiency of PSCs. Cheng et al. reported the growth of perovskite grains with a high average aspect ratio of 2.3–7.9 on a wide range of non-wetting hole transport layers (HTLs), which increases nucleus spacing by suppressing heterogeneous nucleation and facilitates grain boundary migration in grain growth by imposing less drag force. The reduced grain boundary area and improved crystallinity dramatically reduce charge recombination in perovskite thin films to the level observed in perovskite single crystals.18 Independently, Hyung et al. reported that dense CH3NH3PbI3 layers with large grain sizes can be obtained by controlling the stock solution concentration. With increasing perovskite grain size, high quality devices were obtained.19 Subsequently, Xiao et al. reported that solvent annealing effectively increases the crystallinity and grain size of CH3NH3PbI3 films. The average grain size can be increased up to 1 μm using this method.20 All of this research has shown that there is a large influence of grain boundaries in perovskite films on charge recombination, which is closely related to the densities of charge traps. The trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall recombination is one primary loss mechanism in CH3NH3PbI3 halide PSCs.
Herein, we used polystyrene (PS) nanospheres as a sacrificial template to fabricate porous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The growth of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film on the porous-PEDOT:PSS yields a dramatic improvement in crystallinity and an enhancement in perovskite grain sizes. By controlling the PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratio, we obtained high performance planar heterojunction PSCs with the highest efficiency of 17.32% under AM 1.5G illumination, exhibiting over 10% enhancement compared with the planar-PEDOT:PSS-PSCs.
Experimental
Material synthesis and purification
First, the CH3NH3I (MAI) crystal was synthesized upon reaction of a concentrated solution of hydroiodic acid (15.0 mL, 57 wt% in water, Aldrich) and methylamine (CH3NH2) (13.5 mL, 40 wt% in water solution, Aldrich) at 0 °C for 2 hours with isothermal stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere. The precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 70 °C for 1 hour. MAI was dissolved in ethanol at 80 °C, recrystallized from the supersaturated solution at room temperature, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum furnace for 12 hours. PbI2 was bought from Alfa Aesar (99.999%). Clevios PVP AI 4083 PEDOT:PSS was bought from Heraeus (Germany). Polystyrene spheres (PSs) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Aladdin, diameter 50–100 nm, 2.5% w v−1). [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen) were bought from Nichem Fine Technology Co. Ltd (Taiwan). Dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), chlorobenzene (CB) and sec-butyl alcohol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (99.5%).
Solar cell fabrication
After cleaning the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, the PEDOT:PSS layer under various conditions was spun on ITO at 2500 rpm, and then annealed at 125 °C for 15 min. For comparison, planar-PEDOT:PSS, chloroform-washing-PEDOT:PSS and porous-PEDOT:PSS were all prepared.
We mixed PbI2 (922 mg, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar) and CH3NH3I (349.8 mg), with a molar ratio of 1:1.1, in DMF (0.9 mL, Sigma-Aldrich) and DMSO (0.1 mL, Sigma-Aldrich) as a perovskite precursor solution. Then, we spin-coated (at 6000 rpm) the mixture solution (70 °C) on the PEDOT:PSS layer. After a 7 s time-delay, the wet film was washed with 200 μL of sec-butyl alcohol (washing step). After uniformly dropping sec-butyl alcohol in the central substrate, the perovskite film quickly became dark-brown. After spin-coating, the films were annealed at 100 °C on a hot-plate for ∼30 s (N2 atmosphere), quickly becoming black and displaying a higher smooth and uniform surface. Furthermore, we soaked the films with sec-butyl alcohol (200 μL) for 12 s, and subsequently dried them by a spin-coating process (6000 rpm for 30 s). The spin-coating process was typically conducted in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere and with a real-time humidity of ∼1 ppm. Finally, a post-annealing step was carried out on the films. In the process, the perovskite films were transferred on a hot plate, first annealed in ambient air (at 100 °C, for 15 min, with a real-time humidity of 55–65%), and then annealed in a DMF atmosphere with the same temperature and time. For the DMF atmosphere, a sufficient amount of DMF solvent was dropped into a small ceramic crucible, and then a glass Petri dish was used to cover the samples and crucibles.
Subsequently, PCBM was dissolved in chlorobenzene at a 20 mg mL−1 concentration and spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 2500 rpm. The devices were completed by evaporating a 100-nm-thick aluminium film as the electrode (active area of 0.12 cm2).
Results and discussion
We demonstrate a solution-based fabrication method, as shown schematically in Fig. 1, for the formation of porous-PEDOT:PSS layers. First, the solution was prepared by mixing colloidal PS (Aladdin, diameter 50–100 nm, 2.5% w v−1) and PEDOT:PSS solution (Clevios PVP AI 4083) with a 1:7 volume ratio of PS/PEDOT:PSS. The resulting solution was spun on indium tin oxide (ITO) at 2500 rpm and then annealing was done at 60 °C for 5 minutes. The film was then washed in chloroform to wash off the PS template and form the porous HTL. Subsequently, the film was dried under nitrogen and annealed at 120 °C for 10 minutes. In order to prevent deterioration of PEDOT:PSS, the storage time before chloroform washing should be as short as possible.

To investigate the influence of the porous structure, we used the porous-PEDOT:PSS as HTL in the PSCs. The top-view images of both porous-PEDOT:PSS and planar-PEDOT:PSS by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are compared in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Fig. 2c shows the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Bphen/AL. For comparison, normal PSCs were also prepared using planar-PEDOT:PSS, and chloroform PSCs were also prepared using chloroform-washed PEDOT:PSS. As previously reported, the solvent-engineering procedure can contribute to dense and uniform CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films.21,22

Fig. 2d shows the average performance comparison of three representative devices based on their own conditions. Their respective main characteristics were summarized in the inset table. From the figure, one sees that the normal PSCs with planar-PEDOT:PSS exhibit low comprehensive performances with a PCE of 15.33%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.979 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.13 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.741. When the porous structure is in use, the PSCs show significantly enhanced performances. JSC was increased to 22.14 mA cm−2 and VOC increased to 1.007 V, leading to a significant improvement in the PCE of 16.5%.
In order to investigate the cause of high performance in the porous PSCs, we must first rule out the results from chloroform washing. It is evident that solvent additives (such as DMSO and ethylene glycol) in the PEDOT:PSS dispersion solution or solvent-washing on the PEDOT:PSS surface cause a rearrangement in the film morphology upon drying, which increases PEDOT grains or phase separation between PEDOT and PSS. It is generally accepted that the effects are conducive to increasing the film work-function.23,24 In this work, the PSCs with the chloroform-washed PEDOT:PSS had also similar properties of the normal devices, with quite close VOC, JSC and FF values, and a similar efficiency of 15.39%. This means that chloroform washing has almost no influence on the PEDOT:PSS characteristics. In addition, the comparisons of surface characterization and spectral properties for the perovskite films deposited on the two kinds of PEDOT:PSS substrates, as shown in Fig. 3, were in accordance with device performance. The similar surface morphology, the indistinctive X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak and coincident UV-Vis absorption spectra indicated that chloroform washing has little influence on the perovskite crystallinity. In fact, we tested several solvents, such as ethanol, ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and chloroform, in the film fabrication, but chloroform was eventually found to be superior to other solvents in terms of low influence.

Based on the aforementioned research, it is the porous structure rather than chloroform washing that results in the high device efficiency. We also found that the device efficiency was highly dependent on the porous density. We varied the porous density by changing the PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratio in the mixing solution. The top-view SEM images of porous-PEDOT:PSS with PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratios of 1:15, 1:9, 1:5 and 1:3 are shown in Fig. 4a–d, respectively. The nano-bowl (NB) lies at random arrangement in various depths and sizes. The irregular arrangement seemed to derive from the random distribution of PS nanospheres (see Fig. S1†). According to statistics, the NB densities are 9.6, 16.6, 31.6 and 41.3 per square microns for PS/PEDOT:PSS with volume ratios changing from 1:15 to 1:9, 1:5 and 1:3, respectively.
 Fig. 4  Top-view SEM image for the porous-PEDOT:PSS films, the PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratio were (a) 1:15, (b) 1:9, (c) 1:5 and (d) 1:3, respectively. 

Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs with PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratios of without (w/o), 1:15, 1:9, 1:5 and 1:3. The extracted characteristic values for PCE, VOC, JSC and FF can be found in Table 1. With the porous structure in use, all the PSCs show significantly enhanced performances compared to the normal PSCs. The VOC and FF increased as the ratio increased from 1:15 to 1:5, but FF decreased to 0.725 for a higher ratio of 1:3. The JSC increases from 22.13 mA cm−2 for normal to 21.88, 22.08 and 22.49 mA cm−2 for volume ratios of 1:15, 1:9 and 1:5, then decreases slightly to 21.66 mA cm−2 for a higher ratio of 1:3. It is important to note that the JSC are significantly enhanced when porous-PEDOT:PSS is employed. To further investigate this issue, incident photon–current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements have been performed, as shown in Fig. 5b. For the normal PSCs with planar-PEDOT:PSS, a relatively lower IPCE intensity was observed, thus contributing to a lower JSC value. For the samples with porous-PEDOT:PSS layers, the IPCE curves show significant enhancements in the entire wavelength range and thus yield a high JSC value. As a result, the optimal PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratio can be determined as 1:5, where the best overall performance is as follows: the PCE of 17.32%, JSC of 22.40 mA cm−2, the FF of 76.9%, and VOC of 1.006 V (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the same device is shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†). The calculated JSC from the IPCE spectra is 21.83 mA cm−2, which is comparable to our experimental value. Besides, Fig. S2c (ESI†) gives the PCE statistical distribution by the histograms in 40 cells. The results suggest that the current process conditions can contribute to both a high average PCE (16.33%) and the low relative standard deviation (0.58).

In order to achieve an in-depth understanding of the origin of such high performances, we systemically analyzed the differences concerning surface characterization and spectral properties between two types of perovskite films. Fig. 6 shows the SEM image and the cross-view SEM image of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films, which were deposited on the planar and porous-PEDOT:PSS (PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratio of 1:5) substrates. The perovskite films based on the other PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratio are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The top-view SEM image of the perovskite film prepared on the planar-PEDOT:PSS layer (Fig. 6a and b) shows the surface with fine and non-uniform crystallites, and the average grain size was only about 580.6 nm (in Fig. 6c). When the porous-PEDOT:PSS was used, the final perovskite film had a more uniform surface morphology and a larger average grain size of 758.9 nm (Fig. 6d–f).

Here, we suggest a potential mechanism to understand the effect of the porous structure on the improved morphology and enhanced PCEs of the PSC devices. Typically, the ordering or crystallization proceeds efficiently at the interfaces between the perovskite precursors and the PEDOT:PSS layer because of the lower nucleation energy barrier at the heterogeneous interfaces.25–27 For planar devices, the nucleating sites of CH3NH3PbI3 were mostly restricted on the planar-PEDOT:PSS surface, in which available space was fairly limited at each nucleation site, resulting in small grain-sized perovskite crystals. It is noted that some small grains can be found in the perovskite cross-sectional SEM image particularly close to the planar-PEDOT:PSS side, which should provide evidence. As the porous-structures are well dispersed in the PEDOT:PSS layer, effective nucleation centres will locate across over the whole film. Therefore, the number of nucleation sites close to the porous-PEDOT:PSS surface can inevitably be suppressed, and then larger grain sizes can be obtained (Fig. 6e). Alternatively, the porous structure could significantly increase surface hydrophobicity,28,29 or in other words porous-PEDOT:PSS layers were non-wetting to the perovskite precursor solution (seen Fig. S4, ESI†). This hydrophobic surface tends to increase the perovskite thickness (comparative Fig. 6b and e), thus also increasing the perovskite grain sizes.19 As a result, the perovskite grains on the porous-PEDOT:PSS are so large that a single grain can exist through all thicknesses, which makes carrier transport and collection from a single grain possible without encountering the crystal boundary and charge trap.
To further investigate the role of porous-PEDOT:PSS in the crystallization process of the perovskite film, XRD and UV-Vis have been performed, as shown in Fig. 7. Perovskite films on porous-PEDOT:PSS show stronger and sharper XRD peaks due to the enhanced film crystallinity (Fig. 7a). Note that there is no change in the ratio among XRD diffraction peaks, which indicates that the porous-PEDOT:PSS has no effect on the crystal orientation. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the films prepared on the planar and porous-PEDOT:PSS are compared in Fig. 7b. Compared with that of the sample on the planar-PEDOT:PSS, the absorption of the film on porous-PEDOT:PSS is stronger in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm. Note that a similar device structure has previously been reported, which used a porous electron transport layer.30–32 The absorptivity of the TiO2 NB in these references is remarkably enhanced compared with the conventional planar TiO2. Although the result is similar to our own, the principal cause of the performance improvement is quite different for both works. In the previous studies, the TiO2 NB array structure with an optimum pore size and thickness can reduce the reflection losses and thus effectively enhance light absorption in the perovskite layer.30,31 However, we will show that the porous-PEDOT:PSS in the present work will effectively improve the perovskite morphology and crystallinity. The cross-sectional electric field intensity (|E|) distributions have numerically been calculated by using a finite element method (FEM) (see Fig. 8a and b), where, the NB structure with the same size and thickness as previous experimental values (see Fig. 4c), from this figure, one can see that the contribution of the NB structure to photon capturing was next to nothing. In fact, the enhanced of light absorption is most likely due to the increase of the film thickness, grain sizes and/or improved film crystallinity.

(c) Normalized PL of perovskite thin films prepared on planar- and porous-PEDOT:PSS. An excitation light of 325 nm irradiated on the film from the air side, and the PL signal was also collected from the air side. The porous-PEDOT:PSS was prepared with a PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratio of 1:5.

Consequently, the increased JSC of the porous PSCs mainly resulted from the following reasons. First, the porous structure assists in enhancing perovskite morphology and crystallinity, which makes carrier transport and collection more efficient. Second, the improved JSC is also ascribed to a thicker active layer, which is helpful to improve optical trapping properties. Besides, we fabricated planar-PEDOT:PSS PSCs with thicker perovskite thickness by using a high concentration of the precursor solution. The J–V curves (Fig. S5, ESI†) indicate that the PCE doesn't increase as the perovskite thickness increases. This is because a perovskite layer of around 300–600 nm thickness is generally enough to absorb most of the sunlight owing to the very high extinction coefficient of perovskite materials.4 Therefore, only increasing the perovskite thickness without increasing the grain size results in only slight enhancement of JSC.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were also recorded, as shown in Fig. 7c. Generally, the PL emission is related to the recombination channel concerning the bandgap and the trap state.33 The blue-shift phenomenon may imply that the film with porous-PEDOT:PSS has lower trap density around the band-edge than the other film, which is expected to reduce recombination loss and hence improve photocurrent collection. These results are in accordance with the fact that the VOC of the porous PSCs (1.020 V) was higher than that of the planar PSCs (0.979 V). The enhanced VOC and FF can be explained by the larger perovskite grain-size with fewer grain boundaries (i.e., defects), where charge recombination is effectively restrained along the grain boundaries.19 The higher VOC, JSC and FF of the PSCs fabricated from the porous structure induced better PSC efficiency.
In addition, one of main concerns on perovskite solar cells is the presence of the J–V hysteresis, which can be observed by varying the direction and the rate of voltage sweep. There are two main models accounting for hysteresis effects: i.e., ion migration34,35 and unbalanced charge collection rates.36,37 Here the J–V hysteresis characteristics for all devices have also been studied as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). When the PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratio is smaller than 1:5, the undesirable J–V hysteresis can be effectively suppressed. On the one hand, the open NB structure can effectively enhance the perovskite morphology and crystallinity. On the other hand, it can also increase the interface area between perovskites and HTL, which is favourable for improving charge-transfer from the perovskite film to the HTL and effectively reduces the occurrence of trap-assisted recombination.30,31 The PL intensity for the perovskite film on porous-PEDOT:PSS was substantially quenched (Fig. 7c), as the emission was strongly suppressed due to the additional contact area. Thus, the charge transfer from the perovskite thin film to the HTL was effectively enhanced. When the NB density is further increased, the contact between active layer and ITO electrode will inevitably be increased, and the PEDOT:PSS thickness also reduces, which will result in unbalanced charge collection rates, and then a strong J–V hysteresis will appear (see Fig S7e, ESI†).
Conclusion
In summary, we have presented a simple and effective method to fabricate highly unordered porous-PEDOT:PSS that can be used to effectively enhance the quality of the perovskite film with large grain sizes, uniform crystallites and low trap densities. These enhancements were verified using porous-PEDOT:PSS as HTLs in high performance planar heterojunction PSCs. By controlling the PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratio, we determined that the optimal PS/PEDOT:PSS volume ratio for the highest performance is 1:5 with the best PCE of 17.32%, reflecting over 10% enhancement compared to the planar-PEDOT:PSS based PSCs.
