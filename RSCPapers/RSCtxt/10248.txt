    , Accepted 11th March 2020First published on 11th March 2020AbstractThe long stagnation of the photo-conversion efficiency of kesterites below 13% is a source of frustration in the scientific community. In this study, we investigated the effects of sodium on the passivation of grain boundaries and defects in Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) grown on a soda-lime glass (SLG) and borosilicate (BS) glass. Because BS glass does not inherently contain sodium, we placed a thin layer of NaF between CZTSe and Mo. The composition of the samples is Cu-poor and Zn-rich. The distribution of sodium and its contributions to phase formation and defects were examined by cross-sectional energy-dispersive X-ray profiling, Raman scattering spectroscopy and imaging, surface potential and photoluminescence. From the experimental results, it can be strongly claimed that sodium ions segregate predominantly near the grain boundaries and reduce CuZn-related defects. These local surface imaging analyses provided the exact locations of the secondary phases. In particular, the photo-assisted scanning probe method enabled us to observe the changes in the optoelectrical properties of the thin films and the carrier behavior within the materials. Further studies with distinct alkali ions and optimal processing conditions will pave a way to improve the performance of kesterite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Kesterite Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) is a promising absorber in thin film solar cells because it is composed of highly abundant and inexpensive elements. It shows a high absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1) and has an optimal energy band gap (Eg) for thin film solar cells.1–3 To date, the best photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved for kesterite thin film solar cells is 12.6%, fabricated by a hydrazine method4 and a two-step sputtering method.5 However, Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin film solar cells have significantly lower PCEs than Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells (23.35%).6 To match the performance of CIGS solar cells, several issues of kesterite thin film solar cells must be resolved, such as open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficits,7,8 cation disordering and the associated band tailing9 and phase instability,10 and interfacial defects and energy band misalignment.11,12 In particular, Grenet et al. addressed almost all loss factors in kesterite solar cells with alternative buffer layers.8 They suggested that the main limitations of kesterite solar cells are the VOC deficit and the bulk absorber itself; thus, improving the absorber quality may be key to overcoming the stagnant efficiency of these cells.
Sodium has been utilized to achieve high PCEs of CIGS thin film solar cells because it enhances free carrier concentration and reduces active donors and compensation levels. Consequently, CIGS thin film solar cells show improved built-in voltage due to effective p-type doping.13,14 Sodium ions in CIGS thin film solar cells originate from the soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate or from additional deposition of sodium fluoride (NaF). The sodium concentration is generally located on the surface or grain boundaries (GBs) within the CIGS absorber layer;15 however, excessive sodium hinders In and Ga from intermixing in the CIGS layer.
Numerous methods have been proposed to incorporate sodium and alkali ions in kesterite thin film solar cells.16,17 Yang et al. took advantage of the intrinsic sodium concentration of SLG. They showed significant sodium concentrations in CZTS thin films by altering the annealing temperature of Mo-coated SLG.18 The concentration of sodium diffused into the thin films from the SLG increased when the annealing temperature was high. The concentration of sodium within CZTS thin film solar cells affects the performance and enhances the optoelectronic properties of devices.19–21 In addition to Na diffusion from SLG, supplying extrinsic Na by both pre- and post-deposition can enhance the electrical properties of CZTSe thin films, resulting in additional shallow defects and improved acceptor behavior.22 Lin et al. also reported that CZTS solar cells exhibited carrier dynamics with extended minority carrier lifetimes after incorporating sodium; they also achieved passivation of deep defects near the CZTS/CdS junction and enhanced device performance.23
Sodium doping is already known to be effective to increase the grain size and improve the VOC and fill factor (FF) of kesterites in addition to chalcogenides.24 Gershon et al. as well as Fella et al. reported that the presence of sodium on the surface and along GBs was closely related to suppression of non-radiative recombination on internal CZTS.25,26 Li et al. reported that the hole density increased when sodium was incorporated into the CZTSe layer, and the bulk Fermi level moved towards the valence band (VB).27 Consequently, VOC increased, whereas the short-circuit current density (JSC) decreased.27 Jiang et al. as well as Yan et al. suggested that upward surface potential bending at the GBs in chalcogenide thin film surfaces was induced by a large concentration of sodium that diffused into the thin films from sodium-containing substrates.28,29 Thus, carrier separation in the absorbers was enhanced and recombination near the GBs was suppressed. In the case of kesterites, sodium suppresses the formation of secondary phases and defects.10,30 In the regime of Cu-rich kesterites, Cu-related secondary phases readily form.31 Sodium replaces copper to create a few NaCu defects and hinders VSe, forming NaSe and/or Na–Se compounds.31 In a Zn-rich regime, Na can suppress the formation of ZnSn defects, which can be detrimental recombination centers.32 Recently, the relationship between Na and O was reported, where CZTS thin films were annealed in an O-rich atmosphere to redistribute Na atoms and control impurities in the kesterite material.33 In this study, we focused on the structural and optoelectronic properties of CZTSe thin films with different sodium addition protocols. Previous studies on the effects of sodium in kesterite thin film solar cells are summarized in Table 1.34–36 Several reports have shown that the location of sodium ions has subsequent beneficial impacts on device performance.18,21,23,25,26,37–39 We present the methods for passivation of defects and GBs with and without sodium in this paper.

2. Experimental
CZTSe thin films were grown by electron-beam evaporation of Cu, Zn, Sn metal and Se sources on Mo-coated SLG and BS substrates at 500 °C for 60 min with a base pressure of approximately 1 × 10−5 Torr. The evaporation rates for Cu, Zn, Sn and Se were 0.6, 2.6, 4.8, and 5.0 Å s−1, respectively. The CZTSe films were then annealed under Se atmosphere for 20 min while the substrate temperature was decreased to 200 °C. NaF layers were deposited onto SLG substrates to address deficient sodium concentrations in the CZTSe films, and we investigated several thicknesses of the NaF layer, from 5–200 nm. For our process conditions, 100 nm thick layers were sufficient to distinguish CZTSe uncoated and coated with NaF on BS substrates. The NaF layer was deposited by electron beam evaporation on Mo-coated SLG at ambient temperature. Compositional analyses were performed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP), and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). As summarized in Table 2, the CZTSe thin films were Cu-poor and Zn-rich, and the sodium concentration was dependent upon the substrate used.

The morphological, structural, optical, and electrical properties of the films were investigated using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), Raman scattering spectroscopy mapping, and photo-assisted Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). We used a laser excitation wavelength of 488 nm at 10 mW for Raman scattering spectroscopy, and 2D micro-Raman scattering mapping was conducted with a 532 nm, 0.6 μW laser. Cross-sectional images of the films were obtained using STEM, where we prepared the CZTSe thin films for STEM investigation by focused ion beam (FIB) milling. A commercial atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanofocus Inc., n-Tracer) with a Pt/Ir coated silicon cantilever (Nanosensor) was used for the KPFM measurements. Topography and surface potential images were obtained in non-contact mode by applying an AC voltage with 1.0 V amplitude. The image scan size was 4 × 4 μm2 at a scanning rate of 0.5 Hz to reduce topological signals. We used a green laser (532 nm) to excite the samples and measure the surface photo-voltage (SPV). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature using a He–Ne laser (633 nm) as the excitation light source with a spot size of approximately ∼1 μm. The PL signal was dispersed using a SPEX 0.55 m spectrometer (TRIAX 552, Jobin Yvon) and detected with a liquid-nitrogen cooled InGaAs array detector. The blazed wavelength of the grating was 1000 nm and the groove density of the grating was 600 grooves per millimeter.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the grains and distribution of sodium ions within the CZTSe thin films fabricated with three different protocols. The diffusion of sodium was tracked by a combination of SIMS depth profiles and TEM-EDS. The CZTSe thin films grown on a BS substrate with NaF accumulated sodium ions at the interface between the CZTSe film and the Mo layer. It is already known that sodium diffuses out of SLG, moves into the absorbers, and eventually accumulates near the GBs.15,18,19,40 The sodium ions within the CZTS thin films were located on the surface and along the GBs.19,25 Fella et al. reported that the relocation of sodium ions from SLG into the CZTSSe absorber layer is critical for device performance.26 The incorporation of sodium in the GBs within CZTSSe improves VOC and FF because it removes active defect states. However, excessive sodium in the CdS buffer layer leads to poor p–n junctions in kesterite solar cells. Thus, the distributed locations and the role of sodium ions should be clarified in the three different cases in this work.
 Fig. 1  Na diffusion mechanism within the CZTSe absorber layer deposited on (a) soda-lime glass (SLG), (b) borosilicate (BS) without NaF, and (c) BS with NaF. Na diffused through the grain boundaries (GBs) and was located in the GBs for the CZTSe thin films on SLG. Na in the CZTSe thin films on BS with NaF accumulated on the film surface and at the interface between the Mo and CZTSe layers. 

Fig. 2(a) shows micro-Raman scattering spectra for the CZTSe thin films on different substrates. All the samples exhibited A1 mode peaks of the kesterite phase at 170 and 194 cm−1 and a B mode peak at 234 cm−1. Other peaks at 132 and 246 cm−1 are assigned to SnSe and ZnSe secondary phases, respectively.21,41–45 The Raman spectra looked similar; therefore, the samples were not distinguishable with this method. It is notable that the ZnSe secondary phase was detected in all the samples due to the Zn-rich composition. The weak SnSe signals were presumably due to the small grain size of the SnSe phase within the CZTSe layers on SLG and BS without NaF. A SnSe2 phase-related peak appeared at 186 cm−1.45 The laser (λ = 532 nm) beam size during the micro-Raman scattering measurements was about 1 μm. Therefore, we obtained 2D micro-Raman scattering mapping over 8 × 8 μm2 of the thin film surfaces, as shown in Fig. 2(b). For micro-Raman mapping, we used a green laser with a smaller energy band gap than the blue laser (488 nm) used for the spectrum in Fig. 2(a). Thus, the penetration length was deeper for the green laser than for the blue laser, and the Cu2Se phase beneath the CZTSe surface was detectable. The CZTSe thin films on SLG and BS with NaF show more uniform CZTSe phase distributions than the sample on BS without NaF. The relative peak intensities of the secondary phases of the sample on BS without NaF are higher than those of the samples on SLG and BS with NaF.

CZTSe peaks were observed at 170, 194, and 234 cm−1. Peak characteristics of SnSe (132 cm−1) and ZnSe (246 cm−1) secondary phases were also present. (b)–(m) Two-dimensional micro-Raman scattering maps of the peak intensities of CZTSe (194 cm−1), SnSe (132 cm−1), ZnSe (246 cm−1), and Cu2Se (256 cm−1). Excitation laser wavelength = 532 nm and power = 0.6 μW. Zn and Sn-related secondary phases show strong peak intensities in similar areas, whereas Cu-related peaks formed separately from the former peaks. 
Briefly, we wish to discuss the formation of secondary phases related to Cu.31 SnSe (or SnSe2) and ZnSe phases were found together with Cu2Se phase. Temgoua et al. reported that SnSe2 can be formed on the CZTSe film surface after rather short annealing times of 1 to 15 min.46 However, we found no significant difference in phase formation in the films by a similar annealing process. Below is a proposed mechanism: Cu + Zn + Sn + Se → CuxSe(s) + ZnSe(s) + SnSex(s) → (T > 350 °C) Cu2ZnSnSe4(1)For the decomposition route, Redinger et al. as well as Fella et al. suggested the following mechanism (T > 600 °C):40,47 Cu2ZnSnSe4 → Cu2Se(s) + ZnSe(s) + SnSe(g) + Se(g)(2)SnSe is volatile and easily decomposes; therefore, it is hard to change SnSe to CZTSe phase. Note that we grew the CZTSe films by selenization at low temperature (<500 °C) for the volatile SnSe. Consequently, the CZTSe thin films deposited on BS with NaF did not exhibit any SnSe phase.

Fig. 3 shows the elemental distributions of Cu, Zn, Sn, and Se at the sample depth. Zn and Sn were not effectively mixed in the main body of the CZTSe thin films on SLG and BS without NaF. This provides indirect evidence that ZnSe and SnSe secondary phases were formed. However, adding the NaF layer on BS removed the SnSe. The surface and back contact regions of the CZTSe absorber layer remained Zn-rich. The CZTSe film on BS with NaF shows effective mixing of Zn and Sn during CZTSe growth. In the SIMS data, the distribution of sodium ions appears to be due to an ion yield change rather than clearly related to a real sodium concentration change. The sodium intensity at the interface between Mo and CZTSe is related to the presence of oxygen ions.
 Fig. 3  Compositional distributions of the CZTSe layers on (a)–(e) soda-lime glass (SLG) and borosilicate (BS) (f)–(j) without and (k)–(o) with NaF. Composition images were obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The Cu, Zn, Sn, and Se mapping images show that Zn and Sn were not efficiently mixed. Efficient mixing occurred for films that included the NaF layer between the Mo and CZTSe layers. The insets, combined with STEM images, are secondary-ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) depth profiles showing the elemental compositions of the CZTSe thin films. The absorber layer thickness for the SLG sample was >1 μm thicker than that for the BS samples. The Na concentration was high near the absorber layer surface and at the interfaces between Mo and BS with NaF. Cu, Zn, Sn, and Se existed uniformly in the absorber layer with Na-incorporation. 

Fig. 3(e), (j) and (o) show STEM images and SIMS depth profiles for the CZTSe thin films. The concentration of sodium is high near the surface of the absorber layer and the interface of Mo and CZTSe. Cu, Zn, Sn, and Se are distributed quite uniformly in the absorber layer on BS with NaF. Zn is not uniformly located in the film on SLG. The middle of the CZTSe film appears to be Zn-poor, and the back-contact side is Zn-rich. We believe that diffusion of sodium aids the uniform spread of Zn and Sn in the absorber layer. The location of sodium was determined by comparing the signal of sodium ion against the normalized depth (d/d0). The highest intensity of sodium was found for the CZTSe film on BS with NaF. Most of the sodium was located at the surface of the absorber layer and between the CZTSe thin film and Mo-coated SLG and BS with NaF. In the cases of the Cu-rich CZTSe thin films on SLG and BS with NaF, the concentration of sodium is high near the surface of the CZTSe film and the interface of Mo and CZTSe.

Fig. 4 shows the potential distributions within the CZTSe thin films with different sodium distributions using KPFM. The work function difference between the metal-coated tip and the thin-film surface can be read as the contact potential difference (VCPD): (3)where φ is the work function. Depending on the topography, VCPD shows fluctuation, which indicates the local band structure fluctuation as well. The line profiles (Fig. 4(e), (j) and (o)) display upward VCPD bending near the GBs. The SPV, which was measured under illumination, showed higher values than the VCPD. The SPV and VCPD have the relationship below:48 (4)Thus, for a non-uniform semiconductor, mapping local variation in VOC is possible by measuring SPV and VCPD. In the case of the thin films with Na (Fig. 4(e) and (o)), the difference between SPV and VCPD (ΔVCPD) is larger than the ΔVCPD of the sample without Na. The average ΔVCPD values of the thin films on SLG and on BS with NaF are 0.147 and 0.150 V, respectively, while that of the thin film on BS without NaF is 0.062 V.
 Fig. 4  Surface topographies, surface potential maps in the dark (VCPD,dark) and under illumination (VCPD,light), and the differences in surface potential (qΔV). CZTSe thin films on (a)–(e) soda-lime glass (SLG) and (f)–(j) borosilicate (BS) with NaF showed higher potential differences depending on the topography than the thin film on (k)–(o) BS without NaF. Upon excitation by the 532 nm wavelength laser, the thin film surface showed surface photo-voltage (SPV). By subtracting VCPD,dark from VCPD,light, indirect open-circuit voltage (VOC) properties can be obtained, indicating higher VOC with Na-incorporation. 
The effects of sodium on the electronic properties of GBs have been reported by many researchers. Persson and Zunger proposed that the GBs in CIGS contain interfacial 2VCu + InCu neutral defect complexes and that the VB edge is lowered while the CB edge does not change much in the absence of Cu atoms.49 The high positive potential value at the GBs in CZTSSe causes minority carrier attraction and hole repulsion.50 The CZTSe film on SLG exhibits higher potentials than that on BS without NaF.
We expected that the SPV results combined with the surface potential measured in the dark would show that increased VOC can arise from intrinsic and/or external sodium addition, i.e., mitigation of tunneling-induced interfacial recombination can be achieved by suppressing surface defects, causing an abrupt downward VB at the junction between the CZTSe and buffer layers.51

Fig. 5 shows the surface potential differences between the GBs and intragrains (IGs) for the films on different substrates. The potential in the film on SLG was ∼100 mV, whereas the potential for the film on BS was <60 mV. The film deposited on BS with NaF exhibited a number of upward potential distributions at the GBs (88.3%) and downward potential distributions at the IGs (75.0%). Similar results were observed for the films on SLG; however, the films on BS without NaF had lower values than the other films. Therefore, the films deposited on BS without NaF had the lowest potential difference between the GB and IG (∼60 mV).
 Fig. 5  Potential bending histograms for CZTSe thin film grain boundaries (GBs) and intragrains (IGs) in the dark and under illumination. In the dark, the thin films on soda-lime glass (SLG) and borosilicate (BS) with NaF exhibited deeper potential bending: upward bending occurred at the GBs and downward bending occurred near the IGs. Under illumination conditions, the extent of the potential bending between the grains is likely to decrease. 
Based on the results shown in Fig. 4 and 5, Fig. 6 can be drawn. The upward VCPD bending near the GBs indicates downward band bending near the GBs. With Na segregation (Fig. 6(b)), the electrostatic force at the GBs can increase because the Nai state has a positive charge. This can enable greater carrier separation, where electrons are collected at the GBs while holes are expelled into the IGs. Furthermore, the extent of band bending between the tip and the sample surface can decrease under illumination (Fig. 6(c)). Thus, the surface potential changes were detected in the results of photo-assisted KPFM.

The film on BS with NaF displays large potential differences (∼90 mV). It is known that sodium segregates through the GBs in CIS thin films and suppresses recombination near the GBs.52,53 We expect that the potential difference near the GBs in CZTSe is influenced by sodium diffusion from the substrate. CZTSSe thin films have higher positive potential at the GBs, causing holes to be repelled and electrons to be attracted. Therefore, the large upward potential bending at the GBs aids separation and transport of minority electron carriers in the absorber layer.28,50,52,53 Ghorbani et al. reported that sodium in CZTSe favors substitution at Cu or interstitial positions. Sodium can form interstitial sites, where tetrahedral sites with two Cu, one Sn and one Zn have lower energies of formation than octahedral sites.
In bulk CZTSe, sodium favors interstitial sites or the positions that Cu may occupy. However, the exact position that Na occupies within CZTSe GBs remains unclear.54 Yin et al. proposed that the intrinsic GBs in CZTSe induce localized deep states that act as recombination centers.55 However, ZnSn, OSe, and Nai prefer to remain in the GBs in CZTSe, eliminating the deep defect states. Therefore, GBs act as hole barriers and electron attracters rather than as recombination centers.55 Theoretical studies have shown that sodium ions in CIGS are located in interstitial sites at the GBs, improving the efficiency of CIGS solar cells.29,52 The current study suggests that Nai atoms reduce band edge bending of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM), which is beneficial for charge separation near the GBs. The larger potential difference will induce band bending near the GBs and hence aid carrier separation and suppress carrier recombination near the GBs (Fig. 6(a) and (b)).
The potential bending values we observed in the CZTSe thin films were lower than previously reported. Typical potential bending values at CZTSSe and CZTS thin film GBs have been reported to be between 100 and 200 mV.37,50,52,53,56 However, our CZTSe films contain no S atoms. Several research groups have recently reported inverted surface potential bending near CZTSSe thin film GBs due to various doping or oxide formations. Xin et al. reported downward potential spikes in Li-doped CZTSSe films at the GBs, creating an electric field that caused upward band bending towards the GBs.56 Downward surface potential bending has also been verified for high efficiency CZTSSe thin films, possibly due to the existence of metal oxide materials near the GBs.57,58 However, the current study shows that the sodium distributed on CZTSe affected the surface electrical properties and caused upward potential bending.
Schwarz et al. detected sodium atoms at GBs within a CZTSe absorber layer using atom probe tomography measurements.59 High alkali impurity concentrations, such as sodium or potassium, were found at the CZTSe absorber layer GBs. The sodium concentration at the GBs varies due to a number of factors, including different interfacial sodium components, GB orientation, and the thickness of the film. Accordingly, the potential near the GBs changes depending on the sodium concentration. Therefore, potential differences between GBs and IGs are strongly affected by sodium diffusion in CZTSe thin films. However, band bending near the GBs in CZTSSe has been reported in the opposite direction to that found in earlier studies.53
In Fig. 7, room-temperature PL spectra of the samples on SLG and BS without NaF and on BS with NaF are shown. All the PL spectra show three peaks: a large one at 0.94 eV, a middle one at ∼0.87 eV, and a small one at ∼0.81 eV. If we compare the relative intensities of the peaks, the change of the peak intensity of the middle peak appears to be significant. Its intensity is the largest for CZTSe on BS without NaF; however, the peak becomes smaller when Na is incorporated. This change is not clear in the small peak at ∼0.81 eV. It is very probable that the peak intensity change at ∼0.87 eV is related to sodium incorporation. We show this in Fig. 7(d), where the band-gap of the CZTSe is 0.94 eV and the two defect states are at ∼0.87 eV and ∼0.81 eV. Several groups have reported possible defect states near 0.87 eV and 0.81 eV as VCn, CuSn and CuZn, respectively.60 Also, Zn–Sn antisite defects, whose energy is known to be 0.86 eV, can be passivated by Na ions.60 Adding sodium ions to kesterites is known to considerably enhance the photo-conversion efficiency of kesterite solar cells.10,60

Fig. 8 displays a sodium-related defect structure and the ternary phase diagram of CZTSe.61 Regarding the defects in kesterite materials, it has been reported that VCu and CuZn can endow CZTSe with p-type conductivity.9 Additionally, with sodium incorporation, the formation and effects of sodium-related defects should be considered. As shown in Fig. 8(c), Nai prefers tetrahedral sites, forming NaSe (or Na–Se compounds) and suppressing VSe2+ defects.62 Because the formation energy of NaSe states is known to be high, the growth condition of high annealing temperature can cause Na to replace Se sites.62 Because the formation energies of NaCu (Fig. 8(a)) and NaZn (Fig. 8(b)) are known to be quite low, defects can develop relatively easily. According to Han et al., NaZn and CuZn defects have very shallow levels above the VBM. Because the charge transition level of VCu is slightly below the VBM between that of NaCu and CuZn, a NaZn defect can be an acceptor, contributing to p-type conductivity. On the one hand, NaSn and CuSn have relatively high formation energies. Because they each create three transition levels, NaSn and CuSn defects are deep level defects and are detrimental to solar cell performance; this explains why Cu-poor conditions can hinder the formation of detrimental electron–hole pair recombination centers. Considering Zn site replacement, SnZn has also been known to be detrimental, requiring Zn-rich conditions during the formation of the thin film. Additionally, when sodium is incorporated, sodium will create NaZn defects, suppressing SnZn formation.32 Also, the facile formation of NaCu enables the transport of Na into the bulk CZTSe thin films along the VCu.11 This mechanism enables Na to diffuse into the GBs and increase their conductivity. Therefore, due to sodium incorporation, sodium-related defects (NaCu and NaZn) can suppress the formation of deep level defects and reduce electron–hole pair recombination, enhancing the quality of CZTSe thin films.

4. Conclusion
We fabricated CZTSe thin films deposited onto SLG and BS with and without NaF. The positive role of sodium incorporation is demonstrated by the surface potentials and by phase identification in dark and illuminated conditions via KPFM and micro-Raman mapping, respectively. Sodium also enhances the local potential barrier near the GBs, enlarging the electrostatic fields. A surface potential of 100 mV is observed for sodium-passivated GBs within films on SLG and BS with NaF. A surface potential of less than 50 mV is embraced for GBs within films on BS without NaF. Sodium-related defects hinder the formation of deep level defects and secondary phases on the films. Reduced amounts of CnZn and VSe2+ defects are also anticipated for the CZTSe thin films by sodium incorporation. We expect that further studies with sodium and alkali ions will enhance the characteristics of CZTSe materials.

 	Fig. 1  Na diffusion mechanism within the CZTSe absorber layer deposited on (a) soda-lime glass (SLG), (b) borosilicate (BS) without NaF, and (c) BS with NaF. Na diffused through the grain boundaries (GBs) and was located in the GBs for the CZTSe thin films on SLG. Na in the CZTSe thin films on BS with NaF accumulated on the film surface and at the interface between the Mo and CZTSe layers.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Micro-Raman scattering spectra of the CZTSe thin films on different substrates. Excitation laser wavelength = 488 nm and power = 10 mW. CZTSe peaks were observed at 170, 194, and 234 cm−1. Peak characteristics of SnSe (132 cm−1) and ZnSe (246 cm−1) secondary phases were also present. (b)–(m) Two-dimensional micro-Raman scattering maps of the peak intensities of CZTSe (194 cm−1), SnSe (132 cm−1), ZnSe (246 cm−1), and Cu2Se (256 cm−1). Excitation laser wavelength = 532 nm and power = 0.6 μW. Zn and Sn-related secondary phases show strong peak intensities in similar areas, whereas Cu-related peaks formed separately from the former peaks.

 	Fig. 3  Compositional distributions of the CZTSe layers on (a)–(e) soda-lime glass (SLG) and borosilicate (BS) (f)–(j) without and (k)–(o) with NaF. Composition images were obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The Cu, Zn, Sn, and Se mapping images show that Zn and Sn were not efficiently mixed. Efficient mixing occurred for films that included the NaF layer between the Mo and CZTSe layers. The insets, combined with STEM images, are secondary-ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) depth profiles showing the elemental compositions of the CZTSe thin films. The absorber layer thickness for the SLG sample was >1 μm thicker than that for the BS samples. The Na concentration was high near the absorber layer surface and at the interfaces between Mo and BS with NaF. Cu, Zn, Sn, and Se existed uniformly in the absorber layer with Na-incorporation.

 	Fig. 4  Surface topographies, surface potential maps in the dark (VCPD,dark) and under illumination (VCPD,light), and the differences in surface potential (qΔV). CZTSe thin films on (a)–(e) soda-lime glass (SLG) and (f)–(j) borosilicate (BS) with NaF showed higher potential differences depending on the topography than the thin film on (k)–(o) BS without NaF. Upon excitation by the 532 nm wavelength laser, the thin film surface showed surface photo-voltage (SPV). By subtracting VCPD,dark from VCPD,light, indirect open-circuit voltage (VOC) properties can be obtained, indicating higher VOC with Na-incorporation.	 

 	Fig. 5  Potential bending histograms for CZTSe thin film grain boundaries (GBs) and intragrains (IGs) in the dark and under illumination. In the dark, the thin films on soda-lime glass (SLG) and borosilicate (BS) with NaF exhibited deeper potential bending: upward bending occurred at the GBs and downward bending occurred near the IGs. Under illumination conditions, the extent of the potential bending between the grains is likely to decrease.
