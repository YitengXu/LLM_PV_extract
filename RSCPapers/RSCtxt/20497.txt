    , Accepted 24th February 2011First published on 22nd March 2011AbstractHeterojunction electrodes were fabricated by layer-by-layer deposition of WO3 and BiVO4 on a conducting glass, and investigated for photoelectrochemical water oxidation under simulated solar light. The electrode with the optimal composition of four layers of WO3 covered by a single layer of BiVO4 showed enhanced photoactivity by 74% relative to bare WO3 and 730% relative to bare BiVO4. According to the flat band potential and optical band gap measurements, both semiconductors can absorb visible light and have band edge positions that allow the transfer of photoelectrons from BiVO4 to WO3. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed poor charge transfer characteristics of BiVO4, which accounts for the low photoactivity of bare BiVO4. The measurements of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra showed that the heterojunction electrode utilized effectively light up to 540 nm covering absorption by both WO3 and BiVO4 layers. Thus, in heterojunction electrodes, the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4 are transferred to WO3 layers with good charge transport characteristics and contribute to the high photoactivity. They combine merits of the two semiconductors, i.e. excellent charge transport characteristics of WO3 and good light absorption capability of BiVO4 for enhanced photoactivity.

Broader context
In heterojunction WO3/BiVO4 electrode, the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4 are transferred to WO3 layers for efficient production of photocurrents. Thus by combination of the merits of the two semiconductors, i.e. excellent charge transfer characteristics of WO3 and good light absorption capability of BiVO4, the heterojunction electrode shows 74% and 730% higher photoactivity relative to bare WO3 and BiVO4 electrodes, respectively, in photoelectrochemical water oxidation under simulated solar light.

1. Introduction
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell is the most advanced method to produce hydrogen by water splitting using solar light. Since the first demonstration of this concept in 1972,1 much attention has been paid to semiconductor materials which could be used as photoelectrodes.2–4 Although TiO2 is the first and the most studied anode material employed for the PEC cell,5–7 its large band gap of 3.2 eV absorbing only UV part of the solar spectrum is a significant drawback in practical application for solar hydrogen production. Thus, recent research has focused on the development of visible light-active materials.8–11
Traditional visible-light photocatalysts are either unstable in water upon illumination (e.g., CdS and CdSe)12 or have low activity (e.g., WO3 and Fe2O3).13 Recently, some UV-active oxides are modified to function as visible-light photocatalysts by substitutional doping of metals3 or anion doping with N, C, and S.8,14,15 However, these doped materials, in general, show only a little absorption in the visible-light region, leading to low activities.16 New and more efficient visible-light photocatalysts are needed to meet the requirements of future environmental and energy technologies driven by solar energy. In contrast to single-component photocatalysts, composite heterojunction of two semiconductors has been recognized as an attractive method to develop a high efficiency material under visible light. It can combine merits of each component to show synergistic effects.17,18 In addition, by forming a junction structure, it can promote efficient electron–hole separation to minimize the energy-wasteful electron–hole recombination. For example, Nozik constructed an n-TiO2/p-GaP diode electrode for a PEC cell, which was found to be much more active than either n-TiO2 or p-GaP single-component electrode for the decomposition of water.19 The CdS/TiO2 composite materials showed greater photoactivities than bare CdS or TiO2 because it could absorb visible light due to the low band gap of CdS and improve the charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes by transferring photoelectrons from CdS to TiO2.20,21
In this work, we studied the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction electrode for the enhanced photoactivity of water oxidation. WO3 is an attractive material, which can absorb the blue part of the solar spectrum up to ca. 500 nm corresponding to the band gap energy of ca. 2.7 eV.22,23 In addition, WO3 is stable in aqueous solution under irradiation. Thus, WO3 has been the most popular visible-light absorbing photoanode for PEC cells, yet its band gap energy of 2.7 eV limits the theoretical solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency to ca. 4.5%. We have modified WO3 for utilizing more sunlight by forming a heterojunction electrode with BiVO4. BiVO4 is also a well-known photocatalytic material with a band gap of 2.4 eV. However, its photoactivity is usually low because of its inferior charge transport properties. If we combine the merits of these two materials, i.e., WO3 with good charge transport properties and BiVO4 with good optical absorption properties, by forming a heterojunction, a synergistic improvement of the photoactivity is expected.
Thus, BiVO4 can be a promising candidate material as the partner of the heterojunction electrodes for enhancing the activity of WO3. In a composition-wise similar approach, Chatchai et al. studied the WO3/BiVO4 composite electrode for enhancing the activity of BiVO4 electrode by using WO3 layer.25 However, their WO3 was not a photoactive layer itself, but a buffer layer similar to SnO2.24 In the present work, we studied WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction electrodes to red-shift the absorption edge of WO3 and thereby to enhance the photoactivity of WO3 electrode for water oxidation, i.e. the half-reaction of water splitting under solar light. The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties were studied to understand the origin of the synergistic effect of the heterojunction electrodes and to evaluate the potential of the heterojunction electrodes for PEC cell application.
2. Experimental
The WO3 films were prepared by polymer-assisted direct deposition method as reported previously.26 Briefly, ammonium metatungstate (AMT) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) were dissolved in distilled water. A completely dissolved solution was used to coat F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass substrate. After coating, the films were dried at 80 °C and calcined at 550 °C for 90 min. The BiVO4 films were prepared as reported elsewhere with some modification.27 Thus, the Bi(NO3)2 and ammonium vanadate hydrate were dissolved in distilled water and a separate PEI solution in distilled water was prepared. After complete dissolution, two solutions were mixed to obtain a coating solution. Coating and calcination procedures were identical to the ones used to prepare WO3 films. For composite electrodes, each layer was coated on the top of previous layers after calcinations between coatings.
The crystalline phase of the products was determined using an X-ray diffractometer (Mac Science Co., M18XHF) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 200 mA. The morphology of samples was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7401F, HR-Field Emission Electron Microscope) instrument operated at 10 kV. The film thickness was measured by a profilometer (alpha-step 500 surface profiler, KLA Pencor).
The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a standard three-electrode cell with a Ag/AgCl (3.0 M NaCl) reference electrode, a platinum foil as a counter electrode and a potentiostat (Potentiostat/Galvanostat Model 263A EG&G Princeton Applied Research). In order to measure the photoactivity, the fabricated film was connected to a copper wire with silver paste, and then the exposed FTO surface was covered with epoxy resin. The photocurrent–potential curve was recorded under simulated solar spectrum generated by a solar simulator (Oriel 91160) with AM 1.5G filter. The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using a reference cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL), USA. To measure the performance vs. light wavelength (IPCE), we used an Hg lamp (450 W, Oriel), and a monochromator with a bandwidth of 5 nm. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a potentiostat and frequency response detector (FRD100, PAR). The Nyquist plots were measured at 0.7 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) with an AC amplitude of 20 mV, frequency of 100 kHz–100 mHz under AM 1.5G illumination (1 sun). The measured spectra were fitted by using the ZSimpWin program (from Echem software). The 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used for the all electrochemical measurements. For converting the obtained potential (vs.Ag/AgCl) to RHE (NHE at pH = 0), the following equation was used.ERHE = EAgCl + 0.059 pH + EAgCl0,EAgCl0 (3.0 M NaCl) = 0.209 V at 25 °C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Physicochemical properties
To investigate the effect of heterojunction formation between WO3 and BiVO4, we prepared six samples, i.e., bare WO3, composites 1–4, and bare BiVO4. The number denoting heterojunction electrodes indicates the number of BiVO4 layers in composite electrodes. All films consist of five layers of WO3 or BiVO4 with the same thickness. The configuration of samples is represented in Scheme 1. The upper layer was deposited on top of the lower layers that had been calcined after deposition. Each layer had the same thickness and total film thickness was the same around 3 µm.

Fig. 1 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of bare WO3, BiVO4, and composites 1–4. The high intensity peaks at 2θ of 26.6, 34.2, 37.8, and 51.6° of all samples are due to FTO used as the substrate. In the bare WO3, the peaks of 23.3, 23.8, and 24.6° are observed corresponding to (002), (020), and (200) planes for the monoclinic phase of WO3 (JCPDS 43-1035). The phase of WO3 is transformed from triclinic to monoclinic at ca. 400 °C and thus, monoclinic phase was observed in our sample that was calcined up to 550 °C.28 The monoclinic WO3 is known to show the highest photocatalytic effect than other crystal phases.29,30 In case of bare BiVO4, the main peaks at 18.5 and 29.4° represent scheelite-monoclinic structure (JCPDS 14-0688). The tetragonal-zirconia phase of BiVO4 is transformed to monoclinic at 400–500 °C.31 Thus, the calcination at 550 °C in this work formed the monoclinic phase of BiVO4. Because only monoclinic BiVO4 structure has good photocatalytic activity,32 these BiVO4 films contain proper phase as an active photoanode. In the composite 1, the small peak of BiVO4 starts to appear at 18.5° and increases with increase of BiVO4 layers. In contrast, the WO3 peaks decreased from composite 1 to 4 because of the reduced number of WO3 layers.

The optical behavior of the films was investigated by UV-Vis absorbance spectra as shown in Fig. 2. The light absorption of bare WO3 started at around 475 nm in correspondence with its band gap energy. For the bare BiVO4 film, the onset of light absorption is around 520 nm, again corresponding to its band gap energy. In the composite films, the band absorption edges shifted to longer wavelengths with increased number of BiVO4 layers. Thus, the absorption range of the WO3 electrode was enhanced by coupling of BiVO4 that has a smaller band gap energy.

Fig. 3 presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of bare WO3, BiVO4 and composite 1 electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3a, the bare WO3 film shows a porous morphology with the small grain sizes below 100 nm. The relatively small grain size and the well-developed porosity are advantageous for high photoactivity because of larger number of reaction sites on the surface and the smaller distance that the holes have to travel to reach the electrolyte/electrode interfaces to react with water.22,23 The composite 1 film, in which a layer of BiVO4 was deposited on top of four WO3 layers, also shows high porosity with particle sizes of ∼100 nm. However, the bare BiVO4 shows larger grain sizes than other films. The space between grains is developed by burning polyethyleneimine (PEI) introduced as a binder to make films. Thus, the morphology and porosity are determined during the calcination step when the polymer is burnt away and crystallization of semiconductors takes place. Thus, the final morphology is dependent on the crystallization materials and substrates. Note that the BiVO4 layer for bare films was deposited on bare FTO, yet BiVO4 for composite films was grown on the WO3 layer. The Fig. 3d is the energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) for the cross-section of composite-2 electrode. The Sn layers were observed in the bottom layers due to the FTO substrate. The V atoms originated from BiVO4 were observed at the top layers and W atoms from WO3 between BiVO4 layers and the FTO substrate. Thus, we can confirm the layer-by-layer structure of composite electrode as shown in Scheme 1. However, the interface between different layers is not sharply defined showing significant interpenetrating tails.

3.2 Photocurrent measurements
The photoactivity of each film was determined by measuring the photocurrent density generated during water oxidation as AM 1.5G simulated solar light (light intensity: 1 sun or 100 mW cm−2) was irradiated on the front (semiconductor) side of the film immersed in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (at pH = 6.6). The WO3 electrodes are stable in aqueous solution with a wide pH value (pH = 0–7), while the BiVO4 electrode is weak in acidic media. Thus, the photocurrent measurements were performed in the neutral electrolyte. Fig. 4 indicates the photocurrent density curves of bare WO3, BiVO4 and composite 1–4 films. The photocurrents increased with increasing applied anodic potential representing a typical n-type semiconductor behavior, because both WO3 and BiVO4 are n-type semiconductors. The inset of Fig. 4 is a magnified view in 0–0.5 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) of applied potentials to determine photocurrent onset potential. The photocurrent onset of WO3 was around 0.25 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) and the onset potentials of composite films were negatively shifted to ca. 0.05 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) by introducing the BiVO4 on WO3 films. The onset potential of photocurrent normally indicates the flat band potential of the electrode; however, interfacial charge transport limitation induces errors that lead us to underestimate the value.33 Thus, we measured the photocurrent–potential curves in the electrolyte with 0.05 M methanol solution, which acted as an efficient hole acceptor (Fig. 5). The methanol can reduce the kinetic barrier for charge transport by capturing the photogenerated hole efficiently.

 Fig. 5  The photocurrent–potential curves measured under chopped light (AM 1.5G) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 + 0.05 M methanol. 
In Fig. 5, the onset potential values were observed at −0.05 V for WO3, −0.65 V for BiVO4, and −0.15 V for composite 1 electrode. Namely, the flat band potential of WO3 was shifted to negative potential by coupling with BiVO4, whose flat band potential is more negative. The negative shift indicates larger accumulation of electrons in the WO3/BiVO4 composite electrode and reflects decreased charge recombination.34,35 This negative shift is also of practical importance for the photoelectrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production.
The photocurrents of WO3 were 1.0 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) and 1.65 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) as shown Fig. 4. The composite 1 exhibited the highest photocurrents of 1.74 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V and 2.78 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V by forming a composite with the BiVO4 layer. However, the photocurrent of composite films decreased with further increase of BiVO4 layers from composite 1 to composite 4. The lowest photocurrent was observed at bare BiVO4 electrode with 0.21 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V and 0.63 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V. Thus, the significant enhancement of photocurrent was observed by coupling BiVO4 on WO3 forming a heterojunction in composite 1 electrode, which has an optimized composition (BiVO4/WO3 layers) of 1/4. The photoactivity of the composite 1 electrode represents enhancement of 74% and 730% relative to bare WO3 and BiVO4 electrodes, respectively.
3.3 The origin of photoactivity enhancement in heterojunction composite films
Thus, the photocurrent of WO3 was increased by coupling with BiVO4 forming heterojunction composite electrodes of proper compositions. In order to understand the origin of photoactivity enhancement in the heterojunction system, it is useful to determine the potential energy diagram of the composite film. To determine the relative band positions of each material in this WO3/BiVO4 composite film, we measured flat band potentials and optical band gaps of WO3 and BiVO4. In Fig. 5, the flat band potential was measured by the onset potential for the photocurrent. Here, the flat band potential of electrodes was determined by the Mott–Schottky relation:361/C2 = (2/eεε0Nd)[Va − Vfb − kT/e] where C = space charge layers capacitance, e = electron charge, ε = dielectric constant, ε0 = permittivity of vacuum, Nd = electron donor density, Va = applied potential, and Vfb = flat band potential. The flat band potential (Vfb) was determined by taking the x intercept of a linear fit to the Mott–Schottky plot, 1/C2, as a function of applied potential (Va).
As shown in Fig. 6a, the flat band potentials of WO3 and BiVO4 were −0.19 V and −0.58 V (vs.Ag/AgCl), respectively. These potentials matched the obtained values in Fig. 5. Assuming the gap between flat band potential and bottom edge of conduction band is negligible for n-type semiconductors,37 the conduction band position of WO3 and BiVO4 could be estimated as indicated in Fig. 7. To calculate valence band position, the optical band gap was determined by the following Tauc equation:38(αhv)n = A(hv − Eg) where A = constant, hv = light energy, Eg = optical band gap energy, α = measured absorption coefficient, n = 0.5 for indirect band gap, and n = 2 for direct band gap materials. Because WO3 has an indirect band gap and BiVO4 a direct band gap, the y axis of the Tauc plot is (αhv)0.5 for WO3 and (αhv)2 for BiVO4. In the Fig. 6b, the extrapolation of the Tauc plot on x intercepts gives the optical band gaps of 2.77 eV and 2.51 eV for WO3 and BiVO4, respectively.

 Fig. 7  Schematics of the potential energy diagram for the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction composite electrode. 
Based on these values of flat band potentials and optical band gap energies, we constructed the potential energy diagram for the composite film in Fig. 7. The conduction band and valence band of BiVO4 are more negative than the corresponding bands of WO3. This thermodynamic condition favours the facile injection of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of BiVO4 to that of host WO3. Thus, when this composite electrode is illuminated with simulated solar light, excited electrons are generated in the conduction band of both WO3 and BiVO4. The photogenerated electrons in BiVO4 move to the conduction band of WO3 easily due to the potential difference, and then the excited and migrated electrons in WO3 are collected onto FTO. This facile electron transfer would reduce the chance of recombination with holes formed in the valence bands of the two semiconductors. The holes migrate to the semiconductor/electrolyte interface either directly or after transfer from WO3 to BiVO4. The reduced recombination would naturally induce photoactivity enhancement.
To evaluate the kinetics of charge transfer in this composite electrode system, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed. The EIS is a powerful tool to study electrochemical behaviour, especially charge transfer phenomena.39,40Fig. 8 shows EIS spectra measured under simulated solar light illumination and presented in Nyquist diagram in the frequency range of 100 kHz–100 mHz for bare WO3, BiVO4, and composite 1 and 4 electrodes. The Nyquist plot can be interpreted in terms of the equivalent circuit as displayed in the inset. In the plot, symbols indicate the experimental results and the lines represent fitting results by using an equivalent circuit. Here, the EIS data were measured using a three electrode cell system, thus the arc in Nyquist plot indicates the charge transfer kinetics on the working electrode.
 Fig. 8  Electrochemical impedance spectra of bare WO3, BiVO4 and composite 1 and 4 electrodes. The solid line was fitted by ZSimpWin software using the proposed equivalent circuit model. The EIS was measured at 0.7 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) under simulated solar illumination in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. The inset shows an equivalent circuit for the photoanodes. 
In the equivalent Randle circuit, Rs is the solution resistance, Q1 is the constant phase element (CPE) for the electrolyte/electrode interface, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance across the interface of electrode/electrolyte. Thus, the arcs in the Nyquist plot are related to charge transfer at interface of the photoelectrode/electrolyte. The fitted values of Rct were 780.4, 803.6, 1390, 8803 Ω for bare WO3, composite 1, composite 4, and bare BiVO4 electrodes, respectively. The efficient charge transfer at the interface between photoelectrode/electrolyte hinders the charge recombination and induces the facile charge transport of electrons through the films.35 Thus, the bare WO3 has a very good efficiency of charge transfer showing the lowest Rct. The largest Rct for BiVO4 indicates that the charge transfer characteristics of BiVO4 are poor. The Rct values of composites 1 and 4 lie between those of BiVO4 and WO3. The Rct of composite 1, the most efficient heterojunction electrode, was only slightly larger than bare WO3 electrode. Thus, the charge transfer rate in the bare WO3 and composite 1 are similar. Thus, we can conclude that the low activity of bare BiVO4 is due to its poor charge transfer characteristics and by forming the heterojunction with WO3, the charge transfer rate is improved to become as good as that of WO3.
Although BiVO4 absorbs a larger fraction of solar light than WO3 due to its narrower band gap as shown in Fig. 2, electrons and holes formed in BiVO4 are not fully utilized for water decomposition reaction because its poor transfer characteristics lead to the recombination. However, when a composite heterojunction electrode is formed, the relative band positions of WO3 and BiVO4 shown in Fig. 7 provide a thermodynamic driving force of charge transfer in the composite electrode. Thus, photoelectrons formed in BiVO4 would move to WO3 avoiding charge recombination. These photoelectrons could be efficiently used in WO3 for current generation due to its good transfer characteristics. This could be confirmed by measuring the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra.

Fig. 9 shows IPCE spectra of bare WO3, BiVO4, and composite 1, 4 electrodes measured at 0.7 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) in 0.5 M Na2SO4. The IPCE is defined by following equation,IPCE (at λ) = [J × 1240]/[Pmonoλ] where J = photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Pmono = light power density (mW cm−2) at λ, and λ = wavelength of incident light (nm). The bare WO3 shows rising IPCE from 480 nm and BiVO4 from 540 nm in agreement of their band gap energies. Despite the range of light absorption of BiVO4 is larger than WO3, the photoactivity was much less because of poor charge transfer characteristics as evidenced by the EIS study discussed above. The composite 1 also showed the onset of IPCE at 540 nm like BiVO4. Because WO3 cannot absorb the light with the wavelength between 500 and 540 nm, the IPCE in this range for composite 1 is originated from the absorption by the BiVO4 layers. But, unlike bare BiVO4, the composite electrode can utilize this light of 500–540 nm for water oxidation, because the good charge transfer characteristic at the interface between composite 1 electrode/electrolyte induced rapid transfer of photoelectrons formed in BiVO4 to WO3. The thermodynamic energy band structure as shown in Fig. 7 helped the generated photoelectron to migrate from the conduction band of BiVO4 to that of WO3. Thus, the composite 1 heterojunction electrode combines the advantages of two semiconductors, i.e. excellent charge transport characteristics of WO3 and good light absorption capability of BiVO4. This seems to be the origin of the synergy in enhanced photoactivity by forming composite electrodes of two semiconductors. The composite 4 behaves more like bare BiVO4 because of improper composition of the composite.

Conclusions
We investigated the heterojunction composite anode of WO3/BiVO4 to enhance the photoactivity of WO3 by coupling with BiVO4. The composite electrode with optimized composition of one top BiVO4 layer and four WO3 layers on FTO showed the highest photocurrent with 74% (at 0.7 V) increase relative to bare WO3, and 730% relative to bare BiVO4. The EIS study demonstrated poor charge transport characteristics of BiVO4, which were responsible for the low photoactivity of the bare BiVO4 film. But when it is coupled with WO3 forming heterojunction composite anode, the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4 are transferred to WO3 layers with good charge transport characteristics and contribute to the high photoactivity. Thus, the composite electrode combines merits of the two semiconductors, i.e. excellent charge transfer characteristics of WO3 and good light absorption capability of BiVO4. This seems to be the origin of the synergy in enhanced photoactivity by forming heterojunction electrodes of the two semiconductors. Thus fabrication of heterojunction WO3/BiVO4 is an efficient method to enhance the performance of WO3 electrode for water splitting in PEC cells.

Broader context
In heterojunction WO3/BiVO4 electrode, the photogenerated electrons in BiVO4 are transferred to WO3 layers for efficient production of photocurrents. Thus by combination of the merits of the two semiconductors, i.e. excellent charge transfer characteristics of WO3 and good light absorption capability of BiVO4, the heterojunction electrode shows 74% and 730% higher photoactivity relative to bare WO3 and BiVO4 electrodes, respectively, in photoelectrochemical water oxidation under simulated solar light.

ERHE = EAgCl + 0.059 pH + EAgCl0,
EAgCl0 (3.0 M NaCl) = 0.209 V at 25 °C.
