    , Accepted 25th January 2021First published on 24th February 2021AbstractCubic phase CsPbX3 nanocrystals (NCs) are promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. However, their chemical stability heavily depends on the dynamic ionic surface. In this work, based on the interdependency of the ligands and the reaction solvent, a protocol is developed for high-quality α-CsPbX3 under ambient conditions. Utilizing this method, the size and full width at half maximum of CsPbX3 NCs can be simply tuned via changing the cationic ligands or reaction solvent, such as CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, or toluene. One remarkable result is the synthesis of cubic CsPbI3 NCs, for which large-scale syntheses have not been reported in the literature except for our method, due to significant phase transition at room temperature. Another result is that we have realized ultrasmall sized CsPbCl3 NCs with emission at 385 nm for the first time. Furthermore, the elimination of reaction solvent (such as ODE, DMSO, DMF) in our protocol reduces the purification-induced surface ligand loss and the irreversible phase transition to a nonfluorescent phase. Our CsPbX3 NCs show near-perfect photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) and long-term stability in the presence of moisture. Further characterization demonstrates that all the ligands, whether the initial paired X type or the degenerated hybrid L–X type, remain perfectly passivating on the defect sites throughout.
1. Introduction
In recent years, colloidal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs with the characteristics of flexible surface modification and low-cost solution processability have attracted enormous attention in light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, low-threshold lasers, efficient solar cells, photocatalysis, and sensitive photodetectors.1 These NCs have high defect tolerance and efficient emission of triplet excitons, which covers a broad region from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared window.2 Inspiringly, the NC formation energy, ionic characteristics and optical properties of CsPbX3 can be easily tuned by the NC size, and the chemical composition can be tuned via ion exchange reactions.3
So far, hot-injection and ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) are the most widely used methods for CsPbX3 NCs.4,5 In the former, rapid nucleation is instantaneously triggered at high temperature, in which cesium oleate is injected into a hot solution containing PbX2 and surfactants. LARP was first proposed for hybrid MPbX3 (M = MA, FA, Cs, etc.), and then extended to CsPbX3 NCs. The phase transfer of dissolved halide from a polar solvent to a nonpolar medium causes recrystallization. However, it is impossible to tune the halide stoichiometry to favor the formation of halide-rich CsPbX3 NCs, which have shown excellent stability and optical properties. Manna et al. proposed an improved “three-precursors approach”, in which benzoyl halides were injected into 1-octadecene (ODE) containing Cs+ and Pb2+ in the presence of oleylamine and oleic acid at high temperature.6 The benzoyl halides with high activity were easily hydrolyzed to hydrogen halides in the air, which increased the operational requirements for laboratory researchers.
However, several representative drawbacks still impede the widespread applicability of the above methods. A non-negligible issue is the fact that a bulk precipitate of CsPbX3 NCs is inevitably produced utilizing all hot-injection methods, despite the use of an ice-bath as a precaution.7 This contrasting phenomenon compared to CdSe-based NCs is ultimately the result of rapid nucleation and growth of CsPbX3 NCs. Another thorny issue is the subsequent separation and purification of the NCs from the crude solution.7 Unescapable secondary ligand shedding during the procedure further increases the severe degradation of CsPbX3 NCs. Besides the above Gordian knots, spontaneous irreversible phase transitions, mixed phases, and alloyed-structure phase separation also seriously impact the photoelectric properties. For example, the non-fluorescent “yellow phase” of CsPbI3 NCs increases nondeterminacy in solar cells and light emitting diodes as attractive exciton generators.7–9 Small-sized CsPbBr3 NCs are a prospective alternative for fabrication of efficient blue LEDs to avoid phase separation in electrical excitation devices in contrast to optimized CsPbBr3−nCln or Cs3−nRbnPbBr3 NCs.10 Therefore, it is important to develop better strategies and investigate how ligands and reaction solvent influence the nucleation and growth processes of CsPbX3 NCs.
Here, to overcome the limitations associated with the conventional procedures, a new high-efficiency protocol based on modified three-precursors methods was proposed to directly assemble CsPbX3 NCs in a solution of the anionic precursor at room temperature. Both uniform nucleation and growth and chemical stability are simultaneously achieved with our method. We abandoned common noncoordinating solvents such as ODE to avoid laborious purification and designed ligands with different strategies for the three ions to control the precursor reactivity.11 Carboxylic acids were utilized as monovalent cationic ligands, alkylamines or carboxylic acids were used as divalent cation ligands and triphenylphosphine halogen adducts (Ph3PX2) were used as the halogen precursors. Previous studies have shown that Ph3PX2 exhibits solvent-mediated structures.12–16 In addition, Ph3PX2 is a chemically mild reagent for the formation of alloyed CsPbXnY3−n NCs (X, Y = Cl, Br, I; 0 < n < 3) at room temperature. Considering the convenience of characterization, oleic acid and oleylamine were mainly utilized as cationic ligands.
2. Results and discussion
One dose of metal precursor was dropped into the pre-designed halogen precursor solution (i.e. CH2Cl2, CH3Cl, toluene, or mixtures with variable proportions) and stirred rapidly. The reaction solution quickly becomes a bright fluorescent solution (Movies S1 and S2†). Fig. 1c shows optically transparent CsPbX3 NC solutions without visible precipitation in contrast to conventional methods, indicating mitigated nucleation and growth of CsPbX3 in a self-assembly reaction. Previous reports have indicated that CsPbI3 NCs mainly form an orthorhombic phase at low temperature owing to lower surface energies. With our method, we indeed obtained a high-quality CsPbI3 NC solution as shown in Fig. 1c. The reasons for the stability of the cubic phase at room temperature will be discussed later. We utilized the following abbreviations to describe our synthesis reactions: the layout “a/a/c” represents “ligand a/ligand b/reaction solution” to clearly distinguish the variations of ligand composition and reaction solvent. The XRD patterns closely matched cubic CsPbX3 in all three cases without impurity phases (Fig. 1a).7 It was found that the (100) crystallographic planes appear at 14.08° for CsPbI3, 15.09° for CsPbBr3, and 15.8° for CsPbCl3, as marked with a green dotted line in Fig. 1a. The solution (0.1 M crude solution) PL QYs are 60 ± 5% for CsPbCl3 NCs (violet emission at 405 nm), 90 ± 5% for CsPbBr3 NCs (blue emission at 470 nm) and 90 ± 5% for CsPbI3 NCs (red emission at 620 nm). The bright-field TEM images show that all CsPbX3 NCs had cubic shapes and monodisperse narrow size distributions (Fig. 1d–f).7 The results of our synthesis method indicated that the ligands and solvents have non-negligible effects on the growth of CsPbX3 NCs, which provides a scheme for a morphology control study. As shown in Fig. 1g–i, the CsPbI3 NCs obtained from the OA/OA/CH2Cl2 reaction scheme possessed various morphologies. They undergo a transformation from the initial tetrahedra to irregular squares, which is consistent with similar reported cases.17 The isotropic growth of CsPbX3 NCs was impeded owing to the fact that certain ligands adsorb preferentially on certain crystallographic planes. Inhibiting the growth of certain crystallographic planes or crystallographic directions results in nanowires, nanorods, quadrangles, irregular squares, etc. Remarkably, the digital fluorescence photographs show that the PL wavelength can be easily tuned (Fig. 1j–o).

It was demonstrated that the growth rates of CsPbX3 NCs are faster in strongly polar solvents than in weakly polar solvents. A series of typical results further confirmed our inferences (Fig. 1j–o). We mainly attributed this phenomenon to reactivity differences of the anionic precursors, because Ph3PX2 tends to form an ionic structure in strongly polar solvents.16 The initial PL color of CsPbI3 NCs obtained in CH3Cl is orange. However, after about 30 minutes, the original solution turned crimson, indicating that the CsPbI3 NCs have significantly grown. The TEM images of CsPbI3 NCs also show this rapid growth process in CH2Cl2 (Fig. 1g and i). In contrast, CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 NCs obtained in toluene can maintain their initial fluorescence color for one week. Similarly, the PL color of CsPbBr3 NCs obtained in CH2Cl2 changed from azure to cyan within 5 minutes. At the same time, we also found that the temperature of the reaction solvent had a non-negligible impact on the CsPbX3 growth. The CsPbBr3 obtained in CH3Cl exhibited a bigger size when the synthetic reaction was triggered at 300 K (Fig. 1c and k). Even small temperature fluctuations also affect the subsequent growth of CsPbX3 NCs (Fig. S1†). But the higher reaction temperature significantly reduced the PL QY (Fig. 1k).
Our protocols were also applied to prepare alloyed CsPbXnY3−n NCs via anion-exchange reactions (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2 and S3†).18 Purified CsPbBr3 was diluted with toluene or CH3Cl and then Ph3PCl2 or Ph3PI2 was gradually added to the CsPbBr3 solution. The alloyed NCs had tunable PL and absorption spectra spanning the entire visible spectral region. The fine spectral shift indicated that the anion-exchange reaction can be stoichiometrically controlled at room temperature. Predictably, the polarity of the reaction solvent also provided a simple approach to conveniently tune the exchange rate via changing the polarity of the reaction solvent.16 The fact that the intensity of the PL and absorption spectra was not diminished indicated that anion-exchange did not significantly increase the defect density in the alloyed NCs (Fig. S3†).

(d) Normalized Raman spectra obtained utilizing 780 nm laser light. The insert shows a partial enlargement of the Raman spectra at 700–1400 nm. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate the chemical state of the surface of the CsPbX3 NCs. The single peak at 401.8 eV was attributed to the N 1s core-level, corresponding to protonated oleylamine (R-NH3+).19 The Raman spectra of PhnPX3−n showed that our CsPbX3 NCs were halogen-rich NCs.12 The peaks at 138 eV and 143 eV indicated that phosphorus-containing molecules were capped on the CsPbX3 surface.20 As previously reported, the PL intensity of exposed CsPbCl3 NCs will gradually decrease within a few hours due to the unsustainable optical stability. The classic chlorine-containing ligands played a crucial role in passivating the surface defects of the CsPbCl3 NCs. We found that the photoluminescence intensity of our CsPbCl3 NCs still becomes weak within one day. On comparing with the XPS of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs, the weak P 2p signals further confirmed that the ligands alone cannot completely passivate the surface, especially for CsPbCl3 NCs.
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out to identify the functional groups on the CsPbX3 NC surface as shown in Fig. 2b. The peaks at 3006 cm−1 (–CH), 2928 cm−1 (CH2), and 1608 cm−1 (CC) were attributed to stretching vibrations of oleylamine (OLA). The peaks at 1467 cm−1 (NH2) and 760 cm−1 (CH2) belonged to deformation vibrations, and the peak at 997 cm−1 (–CH) was attributed to a twisting vibration. All the characteristic vibration peaks were attributed to OLA.14,21 The Raman peak at 261 cm−1 was due to a wagging vibration, and the peaks at 367 cm−1 and 667 cm−1 were due to stretching vibrations.12,21 The peak at 1215 cm−1 was attributed to the characteristic absorption band of Ph3PO.22 The whole Raman spectra were dominated by Ph3PX2, with an extremely small amount of Ph3PO. These discoveries showed that the surfaces of our fresh CsPbX3 NCs were mainly capped by Ph3PX2 and OLA.
Previous studies have demonstrated that CsPbX3 NCs possess a dynamic chemical surface capped with Lewis acids and Lewis bases as ligands.23 However, the thermodynamic instability and the XPS, NIR and Raman spectra did not allow us to investigate the coordination modes of the ligands on the occupied sites. Thus, in situ solution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was carried out to further investigate the surface chemistry of our CsPbX3 NCs. Representative 13C, 1H and 31P-NMR spectra of CsPbI3 obtained in OA/OLA/CD3Cl and purified with a physical method are shown in Fig. 3a–d. In the synthesis of CsPbX3 NCs, the identities of the surface bonding ligands became ambiguous because the carboxylic acid and alkylamine were introduced together in the synthesis reaction. The lead ion-terminated surface coordinated by carboxylic acids seriously disrupts the octahedral [PbX6]4− structure. On the contrary, the halogen-terminated surface ensured the integrity of each unit cell and reduced the ion-loss defects significantly. However, alkylamine or carboxylic acid ligands alone have been shown to be insufficient to stabilize CsPbX3 NCs in inevitably defective states.24

(d) Two-dimensional NOESY spectrum. The top-left inset is a zoomed image of the cross-peaks. The bottom-right inset is a partial enlargement of the ROESY spectrum of OLA. 
The presence of multiple ligands in our CsPbX3 was further confirmed by NMR characterization. The characteristic signals in the 13C-NMR spectra at 138 ppm and 28 ppm were attributed to Ph3PI2 and OLA, respectively (Fig. 3a and Fig. S4 and S5†).25 The enlarged detail of the olefin resonance at 5.35 pm in the 1H-NMR spectra further confirmed the presence of OLA (Fig. 3c).26 Previous studies have shown that Ph3PX2 can completely convert carboxylic acids into acyl halides.27 The vanishing of the 13C-NMR signal at 138 ppm was crucial evidence for the absence of carboxylate ligands at the Pb-sites (Fig. 3a).28 The evolution of the 31P-NMR spectra indicated the possibility of phosphorus-containing ligands on the CsPbX3 NCs (Fig. 3b).29 Obviously, the weak electrostatic interaction between Cs+ and the carboxylate ion was unable to stabilize the CsPbI3 NCs. The cross peaks in the NOESY spectra at 5.34 ppm and 7.4 ppm within small ranges were mainly attributed to OLA and Ph3PX2. The negative NOE cross-peaks (red) containing the resonances for Ph3PI2 and OLA can be clearly seen in Fig. 3d, and the signals in the intersecting region in the positive NOE cross-peaks (blue) indicated that the above ligands are in remarkably closely intertwined states and are in spatial proximity. However, the chemical shifts of the 31P-NMR signals were strongly dependent on the solvent environment of Ph3PX2, and the extra introduction of toluene or mesitylene into the initial reaction solution made the solvent properties more complicated.
Although it has been shown in the literature that the 31P-NMR chemical shift of Ph3PX2 is 30 ppm in CD3Cl, we still hold the view that this is not sufficiently reliable evidence to distinguish Ph3PX2 from Ph3PO ligands.30 The only irrefutable conclusion we can draw from Fig. 3b is that Ph3PX2 probably undergoes a chemical structure change. Combining the NMR spectra, Raman spectra and FT-NIR spectra, we confirmed that the surface of CsPbX3 was capped by ligands containing OLA and Ph3PX2, or a small amount of Ph3PO. The definitive identities of the ligands and the coordination mode at the surface bonding sites in our CsPbX3 NCs are still unclear.
The ionic structures of CsPbX3 NCs have evoked numerous controversies regarding the ligands occupying the disparate anchored sites due to complicated ligand types and bonding possibilities.31 Unlike the covalent carboxylic ligand-capped CdSe-like NCs, their surface ligands and inorganic cores have strong chemical interactions. On the surface of CsPbX3 NCs, it has been proved that no certain types of ligands predominate.32 On the contrary, Z, X and L type ligands selectively bond to Pb2+ and X− over a wide range. The most striking case is R-NH2, which can be either a neutral Z ligand or protonated to form an R-NH3+ ligand. What is more, coupled with the thermodynamic instability of CsPbX3 owing to the severe ligand loss or phase transition encountered during subsequent purification, the identification of ligands types and occupied sites became an intractable problem.7 Conventional characterization methods cannot distinguish hydrogen bonds among R-NH3+, X− and R-NH2.
Here, we utilized in situ DOESY spectra to differentiate the dissociated nonbonded ligands, free solvent, and bonded ligands more clearly.33 For the DOESY characterization, the CsPbX3 NCs were physically purified to avoid effects induced by chemical purification reagents. The detailed purification procedure will be discussed in the below section. The different dashed lines in Fig. 4 distinguish the surface ligands, solvent, reactive impurities, and free reactant. The presence of signals with the same diffusion constant at 7.6 ppm, 5.4 ppm, 2.01 ppm and 1.3 ppm strongly corroborates that the neutral alkylamine was protonated to electropositive R-NH3+ and then bonded to the anionic coordination sites through hydrogen bonds. The signals at 7.4 ppm and 7.6 ppm were attributed to bonded Ph3PX2. The signal at 7.5 ppm was attributed to Ph3PO. The CD3Cl possessed the smallest diffusion constant for all CsPbX3 NCs. The presence of Ph3P with no free X2 indicated that all X2 was converted to Ph3PX2. It is noteworthy that mesitylene was introduced with the metal precursor solution. The oleic acid diffusion curve was not observed in the DOESY spectra, which further confirmed that no OA was bonded to Pb2+, as expected.

Based on the above discussion, we propose our surface model of CsPbX3 NCs as shown in Fig. 4d. In this new model, the Ph3PX2 generates wide-spread steric hindrance and protonated alkylamine as a supplementary ligand bonds to anionic sites that are unreachable by Ph3PX2. Numerous anionic ligands yield dense spatial coverage on the bonding sites of neighboring or the same [PbX6]4− octahedrons. We also noticed that Ph3PO as an oxidized degradation product has a similar diffusion rate to Ph3PX2. Recently, numerous reports revealed that post-processing Ph3PO shows excellent passivation effects on surface defects, which usually form chemical bonds with metal cations that possess a vacant orbital to receive an electron pair.34 This indicates that even if moisture destroys the original surface coordination, the product of Ph3PX2 oxidation is still a strong L type ligand to inactivate the Pb-sites in situ. This unique dynamic ligand evolution model for CsPbX3 is shown in Fig. S7.†
Purification is an important step in the selective separation of specific size NCs from the crude mixture solution. These procedures are very efficient in separating the nonbonded ligands and solvent from the surface of the CsPbX3 NCs. However, traditional polar solvents such as alcohols or acetone cause great damage to ionic CsPbX3 NCs, in which chemical precipitation results in ligand loss and irreversible structural disruption.7 Our optimized method does not use polar solvents, which completely avoids subsequent chemical purification.
Our crude CsPbX3 NCs were optically transparent homogeneous solutions without formation of large particles as shown in Fig. 1c. On this basis, we further purified the NCs with physical methods. Fig. 5a depicts our physical purification scheme in detail. Firstly, the CsPbX3 CD3Cl solution was decanted into a plastic tube, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. After the solution had fully solidified, the tube was taken out of the liquid nitrogen and left to thaw naturally. Obviously, excess amines or by-products with high melting points thawed later than CDCl3 and remained on the plastic tube wall or bottom. The thawed NC CDCl3 solution was then decanted into another plastic tube, and frozen again in liquid nitrogen. This process was repeated until no solidified by-products were left in the tube. In this way, physically purified CsPbX3 can be used to study the carrier properties, which are closely related to the surface chemistry.

A comparison of the decay curves of CsPbX3 NCs purified with methyl acetate (MeOAc) and liquid nitrogen indicated that a mass of nonradiative traps were generated with long lifetime.7 The latter mainly monoexponentially attenuated the PL intensity. The calculated lifetimes were 5 ns for CsPbCl3, 8 ns for CsPbBr3 and 15 ns for CsPbI3 NCs purified with MeOAc (Table 1). The PL decay shows that our physically purified CsPbX3 NCs (X = Br, I) had quasi-single-exponential lifetimes, close to those of single NCs (Table 2).2 The results of our new purification method suggest that it is possible to prepare standard CsPbX3 NCs with single-channel PL decay like CdSe-based NCs.35

The decay lifetimes of CsPbX3 were fitted by the following relation:I(t) = A1et/τ1 + A2et/τ2 + bτave were calculated by:  in which A1 and A2 are the amplitudes of the two components and τ1 and τ2 are the related time constants.
As an unusual case, CsPbCl3 NCs showed little obvious size tuning compared to CsPbX3 NCs (X = Br, I) in the commonly used synthetic protocols. Here, we have obtained smaller CsPbCl3 NCs, which have never been reported, via tuning the activity of the precursor anions to control the nucleation rate. The metal precursor was added to a CD3Cl solution, in which X2 was replaced with C2Cl6. The chemically mild C2Cl6 first reacted with Ph3P to form Ph3PCl2, and then slowly assembled into CsPbCl3 NCs within a controlled time as determined by the C2Cl6 dissolved in the solvent.36 TEM confirmed this observable growth process, in which agminated high concentration areas first formed small punctate NCs, and were then converted into small quadrate CsPbCl3 NCs (Fig. S6†).37 The PL and absorption spectra of CsPbCl3 NCs obtained using a solar-blind ultraviolet photodetector are shown in Fig. 5b. The exciton emission peak was at 385 nm, and the Stokes shift of 20 nm confirmed the presence of a strong quantum confinement effect in the ultrasmall sized CsPbCl3 NCs. As exhibited in Fig. 5c, the lifetime of CsPbCl3 went beyond the instrument IRF, indicating radiative recombination faster than the ns time scale. We will show this in the TA analysis (Table 3).

However, there was also uncertainty as to whether these ultrasmall sized CsPbCl3 NCs with 385 nm emission were quantum dots, or whether they could be clusters, although no positive proof of CsPbX3 clusters has been reported to date. These doubts will be confirmed in the following TA discussion. The dramatic PL decay difference further indicated that chemical purification methods have severe effects on the photoelectric properties of CsPbX3 NCs.
Pump–probe femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) was carried out to investigate the detailed photo-generated carrier dynamics of CsPbX3 NCs. To avoid the adverse impact of multi-exciton effects and strong laser fields, the power of the pump laser was as low as possible to ensure linear absorption.38 The wavelength of the pump laser was also far away from the peaks of exciton absorption. Therefore, for the TA measurements, the excitation wavelength for CsPbCl3 was 330 nm, and 365 nm was used for CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs. All GSB peaks are considerably blue shifted by more than 10 nm compared to the 1st exciton transition peak, confirming the strong quantum confinement effect in small-sized CsPbX3 NCs.38 The 2d pseudo-color maps clearly showed that the TA spectra exhibited ground state bleaching (GSB) that contributed to charge carrier filling upon excitation, photoinduced absorption (PIA) and stimulated emission (SE), which was further confirmed by the global fittings.39
The fitted kinetics indicated that the GSB mainly consisted of three photophysical processes, in which the hot electrons relaxed from the excited states to the bottom of the conduction band on the femtosecond time scale.40 The slightly longer component was attributed to auger recombination induced by shallow traps.41 The nanosecond components were obviously derived from intrinsic edge exciton radiative recombination (Fig. 6c), and were consistent with the steady-state PL lifetimes.42 As shown in Fig. 6a, d and g, the CsPbCl3 NCs possessed similar kinetics to CsPbX3 NCs (X = Br, I), which further indicated that our CsPbCl3 NCs with 385 nm emission were actually quantum dots. As far as we know, this is the first report of such small-sized CsPbCl3 NCs. We concluded that the excellent protection from the multi-source ligands was the primary reason for the stability of the ultrasmall-sized CsPbCl3 NCs.

3. Conclusion
To conclude, we have presented a facile protocol to self-assemble high-quality α-CsPbX3 NCs (X = Cl, Br, I) in CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, or toluene under ambient conditions, in which the NC size or FWHM were tuned via polarity differences of the reaction solutions and cationic ligands. In contrast to the limited solubility of PbX2 in DMSO or DMF, the extremely high solubility of X2 in the above reaction solutions increases the feasibility of forming unstable CsPbI3 and CsPbCl3 NCs at any concentration. We have shown that the stable evolution of the bonding ligands is a key factor in the stability of CsPbX3 NCs. The multi-source ligands not only ensured short-range rigid spatial resistance and long-range flexibility but also maintained a high coverage of bonding ligands on the occupied sites. A comparison of the results of chemical and physical purification methods indicated that the surface ligands had a serious effect on the carrier dynamics of CsPbX3 NCs. Our synthetic strategy provides new inspiration to realize cooperativity between nucleation, growth, and the ligands involved in the reaction for other QDs.

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without purification unless otherwise noted.

4.1.1 Preparation of metal precursor. 
Briefly, 0.1 mmol Cs2CO3, 0.1 mmol PbO, 0.2 mmol Ph3P, 0.2 mmol OA, 0.2 mmol OLA, and 10 mL mesitylene were added to a 50 mL 3-necked round bottom flask and stirred under vacuum for 30 min at 150 °C. Then, the flask was purged with N2 for 30 min and this process was repeated at least 3 times to remove moisture and O2. The reaction was considered complete when the solution was clear. The metal precursor was stored under N2 until it was needed for the CsPbX3 NC synthesis.


4.1.2 Preparation of halogen precursors. 
4.1.2.1 Cl2 chloroform solution. 
0.1 mol MnO2 and 10 mol concentrated hydrochloric acid were added to a round bottom flask and heated to 170 °C. The generated Cl2 was dried with concentrated sulfuric acid, then a N2 flow was used to transfer it into a chloroform solution.

4.2 Preparation of CsPbX3 nanocrystals
In a typical synthesis, one dose of the metal precursor was dropped into a halogen solution of the designed polarity at room temperature. The stirred solution immediately showed bright fluorescence. CsPbX3 NCs with desired peak positions and FWHM could be easily tuned by the hydrocarbon chain length of the metal ion precursor, the reaction temperature or the reaction solvent. Alloyed CsPbX3 was obtained by adding the Ph3PX2 solution to the CsPbX3 solution. The synthesis of CsPbCl3 with molecular Cl2 was only carried out to verify the feasibility of the method. In fact, the CsPbCl3 nanocrystals could be safely synthesized utilizing in situ generated Ph3PCl2 as the halogen precursor. The metal precursor solution was added into a CH3Cl solution of hexachloroethane (Ph3PCl2 was easily generated from excess Ph3P and hexachloroethane) and reacted for 20–30 minutes until ultraviolet fluorescence was observed.
4.3 Purification of the CsPbX3 NCs

4.3.1 Chemical purification method. 
The synthesized CsPbX3 was precipitated by adding MeOAc solution and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 30 min to remove excess unreacted precursor, then kept in the dark at 4 °C for 24 h to precipitate the excess ligands, and this procedure was repeated at least 3 times. However, it is not recommended to use MeOAc to precipitate the CsPbI3 nanocrystals. The stoichiometry of MeOAc is difficult to control; a small account of excess will remove the surface ligands and result in conversion of the cubic phase to an orthogonal, non-fluorescent precipitate.


4.3.2 Physical purification method (recommended). 
The crude CsPbX3 solution was stored in a plastic centrifuge tube and then frozen in liquid nitrogen and left to thaw, and then the solidified insoluble ligands and by-products were filtered. The freeze–thaw–filter cycle was repeated at least 3 times until no solidified by-products were observed during the thawing process.
The CsPbX3 samples utilized in the TA and solution NMR measurements were synthesized in OA/OLA/CD3Cl. The metal precursors were obtained in OA/OLA/Ph3P/mesitylene. The reagents used in both measurements required rigorous drying. We used physical methods to purify crude CsPbX3 to reduce the impact on the NMR and TA signals, because compared with the polar precipitation agent-dominated precipitation–centrifugation–washing strategy, the freeze–thaw–filtration procedure in liquid nitrogen could minimize ligand loss and nanocrystal damage.

4.4 Structure characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded using a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer with a Hi-star 2D area detector using Cu Kα radiation (1.54 Å). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG ESCALAB MK II electron spectrometer by using an Mg Kα (1200 eV) X-ray source. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on an FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin microscope at 200 kV, and a low electron dose was applied to minimize the electron beam damage.
4.5 Optical spectroscopy
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS-980 spectrometer equipped with a xenon lamp (450 W) as the excitation source. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed using a Lecroy Wave Runner 6100 Digital Oscilloscope (1 GHZ), which was equipped with a Delta Diode (dD-405) pulse laser diode with wavelength of 374 nm.
4.6 NIR infrared absorption and Raman spectroscopy
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements were conducted with a Nicolet IS5 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) housed in an argon-filled glove box and operated in transmission mode. Raman spectra were recorded with a customized LabRAM HR800 confocal Raman microscope (Horiba Jobin Yvon). The spectrometer was equipped with an 18 mW He:Ne 780 nm laser source for excitation, a 1800 or 600 lines per mm grating to disperse the scattered light with different resolutions, and an objective lens with a long working distance (Nikon 50 × 0.45 NA) to focus the laser beam and collect the scattered light from the electrode surface.
4.7 Solution nuclear magnetic resonance
Solution NMR characterization was carried out using a 600 MHz Bruker AVANCE III HD FT-NMR spectrometer, featuring a 1H, 13C and 31P TXI-Z probe. The spectra were calibrated using residual CD3Cl solvent as an internal reference: 7.26 ppm for 1H NMR, 63.25 ppm for 13C NMR; tipple: 6.8 ppm for 1H NMR, which is also the in situ reaction solvent. The sample temperature was set to 298 K. 1D 1H, 13C and 31P spectra, and 2D NOESY, ROESY and DOSY spectra were acquired using standard pulse sequences from the Bruker library. The mixing time for NOESY and ROESY was set at 300 ms, and 4096 data points of direct dimension and 512 data points of indirect dimension were sampled. DOSY spectra were obtained using convection compensated double stimulated echo sequences and monopolar gradient pulses. The gradient pulse duration and diffusion delay were optimized so that the gradient intensity varied linearly from 2 to 95% of the probe maximum within 64 steps.
4.8 Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy
The transient absorption (TA) measurements were performed using a 1 kHz, 35 fs Ti: sapphire ultrafast laser amplifier and a pump–probe transient absorption spectrometer (Helios, Ultrafast System). The fundamental beam (800 nm) output pulse was split into two beams. One beam was sent to a TOPAS Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) to generate the pump pulse with tunable wavelength from 250 nm to 2500 nm, and its intensity was attenuated by two neutral density filter wheels. The other 800 nm beam was focused into a GaF2 crystal to generate a white light continuum (WLC). All samples were examined under vigorous stirring under ambient conditions. The pump energy density was maintained at a sufficiently low level so that the average exciton number per NC was ≪1 to avoid multiexciton effects. The test samples needed to be continuously stirred to prevent the formation of Xn+ or Xn− by laser excitation. The pump pulse was 365 nm for CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, and 330 nm for CsPbCl3 NCs.
