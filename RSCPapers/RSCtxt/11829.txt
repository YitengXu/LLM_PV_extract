    , Accepted 20th March 2017First published on 21st March 2017AbstractA copolymer with A–A structure is rationally designed and synthesized by using difluorobenzo[c]-cinnoline (DFBC) as weak electron-withdrawing (A) moieties and 1,4-diketo-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) as strong A moieties. Polymer solar cells based on PDFBC-DPP and PC71BM showed a promising power conversion efficiency of 7.92%, which is one of the highest values in polymer solar cells based on A–A structure.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable interest because of their facile solution processability, low cost, and flexibility.1–5 Although power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of fullerene-based and fullerene-free singer junction PSCs both have exceeded 10% recently,6–8 it is necessary that new high-performance photovoltaic materials should be continually developed to realize the commercial purpose in the future. To exploit high-performance polymer photovoltaic materials, several design strategies have been carried out, such as exploiting new building blocks,9–19 designing the structure of polymer backbones,20–28 and optimizing side chains.29–37 Many efforts have been devoted to designing polymer backbones. Copolymers based on weak electron-donating (D) moieties and strong electron-withdrawing (A) moieties have been widely studied because of their low bandgap and appropriate energy levels. Moreover, terpolymers with A–D1–A–D238,39 or D–A1–D1–A240,41 structures have been proposed in order to broaden the absorption spectra of D–A polymers. Recently, a few conjugated polymers with A–A structure were reported and used as the donor materials of PSCs.42,43 The A–A type polymer has not been paid enough attention because it currently shows a poor photovoltaic performance (PCE < 5%). The polymer PDPP2TPCL with pentacyclic lactam (PCL) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the A units showed a PCE value of 4.7%.43
Benzo[c]cinnoline (BC) and its derivatives possess rigid and planar conjugated structure, and it has been used as weak A units in materials for n-channel organic field-effect transistors and photoluminescence.44,45 In the manuscript, 2,9-difluoro-benzo[c]cinnoline (DFBC) was designed as a new weak A unit in A–A copolymers for the first time (Fig. 1) in order to lower the low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and enhance the molecular aggregation because of fluorination.46–49 Simultaneously, the DPP units were introduced as strong A units to reduce the bandgap and broaden the absorption spectra of the polymer. Additionally, two long alkyl-substituted thiophene derivatives were introduced between DFBC and DPP units in order to improve the solubility of the polymer. As a result, a novel copolymer PDFBC-DPP with DFBC as weak A units and DPP as strong A units was synthesized as a polymer photovoltaic material. As expected, the synthesized copolymer shows a low bandgap of 1.53 eV and a low HOMO energy level (−5.35 eV), which is lower than most DDP-based polymers with typical value above −5.25 eV. Consequently, the PSCs fabricated with PDFBC-DPP and fullerene derivatives could achieve high open circuit voltages (Voc) (0.78–0.80 V), which are higher than those of most DDP-based polymer PSCs (<0.70 V).50,51 Moreover, the PSC device fabricated with PDFBC-DPP and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the photoactive layer shows a promising PCE of 7.92%, which is one of the highest PCE values for copolymers with A–A structure.
 Fig. 1  The design strategy of DFBC and the structure of the conjugated polymer PDFBC-DPP. 
The synthesis process of the monomer and the copolymer PDFBC-DPP is shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed experimental procedures are described in the ESI† (S1, Experimental section). The polymer PDFBC-DPP was synthesized by a typical Suzuki coupling reaction with monomers M1 and M2 in toluene with Pd2(dba)3 as the catalyst. The polymer was purified through sequential Soxhlet extractions with methanol, acetone, hexane, dichloromethane and chloroform. The polymer exhibits good solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at room temperature, which provides convenience for device processing. The average molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the copolymer, determined by using Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with CHCl3 as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard, are 73.2 kDa and 1.7, respectively. The polymer PDFBC-DPP exhibits a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 415 °C (Fig. S1†) and no glass transition (Fig. 3), which indicates that its thermal stability is sufficiently good for application in photovoltaic devices.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of the polymer PDFBC-DPP. 
The optimized molecular geometry of PDFBC-DPP was calculated using the Gaussian 09 program suite at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. As shown in Fig. S2,† the dihedral angle between DFBC and alkylthiophene is 8.2°, and the dihedral angle between alkylthiophene and DPP is 7.7°. These results indicate that PDFBC-DPP possesses good molecular coplanarity, which would be beneficial to molecular aggregation and hole transport.
Temperature-dependent absorption spectra of PDFBC-DPP in o-DCB solution are shown in Fig. 2a, indicating an obvious temperature-dependent aggregation property.22 At 95 °C, the polymer is almost disaggregated, showing an absorption peak at 619 nm. With the decrease of the temperature, a new peak around 713 nm emerges, which reveals a strong aggregation in solution. At 25 °C, the polymer shows two distinct absorption peaks in the longer wavelength region. The maximum absorption peak at 664 nm can be identified with the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and the shoulder peak at 713 nm is attributed to the intermolecular charge transfer. The absorption spectra of PDFBC-DPP in chloroform solution and thin film on a quartz plate are shown in Fig. 2b, and the corresponding data are collected in Table S1.† Obviously, the maximum absorption peak of the polymer film is 725 nm, which is red-shifted compared with that in o-DCB solution (664 nm) and chloroform solution (664 nm). In other words, the polymer film possesses stronger molecular aggregation than that in solution. According to the absorption edge (793 nm), the optical bandgap is calculated to be 1.56 eV.
 Fig. 2  Temperature-dependent absorption spectra of PDFBC-DPP in o-DCB solution (a) and absorption spectra of PDFBC-DPP in chloroform solution and thin film (b). 
The electrochemical properties of PDFBC-DPP were investigated using cyclic voltammetry. As shown in Fig. S3,† the onset oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymer were measured to be about 0.58 V and −0.95 V (vs. Ag/Ag+), respectively. Since the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured and calculated to be 0.03 V, the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PDFBC-DPP can be calculated to be −5.35 eV and −3.82 eV, respectively. It is well accepted that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of a D–A copolymer depend on the HOMO energy level of the D units and the LUMO energy level of the A units.52 Therefore, PDFBC-DPP possesses a low LUMO energy level of −3.82 eV because of the strong electron-deficient property of DPP units. The LUMO energy level (−3.82 eV) is higher 0.48 eV than that of PC71BM (−4.3 eV),51 which ensures a downhill driving force for efficient exciton dissociation. Simultaneously, the HOMO energy level of PDFBC-DPP is mainly decided by weak electron-deficient DFBC units, since the polymer does not contain any typical D units. Therefore, PDFBC-DPP presents a low HOMO energy level of −5.35 eV. It is obviously lower than most DDP-based polymers with typical value above −5.20 eV,50 which would lead to better air stability53 and higher Voc in PSCs.
The molecular aggregation and crystallinity property of the polymer PDFBT-DPP are investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD). As shown in Fig. 3, there is a sharp exothermic peak at 286 °C during cooling, which indicates that PDFBT-DPP is a crystalline polymer. The WAXRD of the polymer film gives a similar result (Fig. 3). It presents a sharp 100 peak at 2.46° and a 010 peak at 25.01°, corresponding to a lamellar distance of 35.88 Å and a π–π stacking distance of 3.56 Å, respectively. All these results indicate that PDFBT-DPP possesses a strong molecular aggregation and crystallinity property.

The photovoltaic properties of PDFBC-DPP were investigated in PSCs with the conventional configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PDFBC-DPP:PCBM/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active layers were spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution. At the beginning, the preliminary device optimization was carried out by optimizing the weight ratios of PDFBC-DPP and PC61BM from 1:1 to 1:3 (w/w), and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. S4.† As shown in Table S2,† the optimized PDFBC-DPP:PC61BM devices, prepared with a blend weight ratio of 1:1 (w/w), exhibited the best PCE value of 7.33%, with a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 13.15 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.80 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.68. It is noted that the PSC device shows a higher Voc value than most DPP-based PSC devices.50 Subsequently, PC71BM was used as the acceptor material to substitute PC61BM. Obviously, the PC71BM-based PSC device shows higher Jsc, FF and PCE values than those of the PC61BM-based PSC devices (Table S2†). A similar phenomenon has been reported because PC71BM possesses stronger absorption than PC61BM in the visible region.54 Finally, the optimized additive content of the blend solution was investigated in the PSC devices with PDFBC-DPP and PC71BM. As shown in Fig. S5,† the PC71BM-based PSC device prepared without 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) shows inferior PCE values, it only shows the Jsc value of 11.87 mA cm−2 and the PCE value of 6.11%. With the increase of the DIO content (vol%), the PSC devices exhibit better photovoltaic properties. The PSC device shows the best photovoltaic parameters when the DIO content is 2%. It presents the highest Jsc value of 14.58 mA cm−2 and the best PCE value of 7.92% (Table S2† and Fig. 4). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves are shown in Fig. 5. The PSC device prepared with 2% DIO exhibits a high IPCE response over 300–780 nm with a maximum IPCE value 61.62% at 450 nm. The corresponding J′sc value obtained from the IPCE curve is 13.88 mA cm−2 for the PSC device (2% DIO), which agrees within experimental error with the measured Jsc. All the PC71BM-based PSC devices prepared with DIO show the same Voc value of 0.78 V, which indicates that these PSC devices present a low photon energy loss of 0.75 eV (Eloss)55 due to the appropriate energy levels and optical bandgap.

To better understand the effect of the morphology on the device performance of PDFBC-DPP:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) based PSCs, the morphologies of PSCs prepared without DIO or with 2% DIO are characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). According to the AFM phase and height images (Fig. 6), the blend film obtained without DIO shows a large domain size and RMS (surface root mean square roughness) value of 4.70 nm. However, the blend film obtained with 2% DIO exhibits a small domain size and RMS (surface root mean square roughness) value of 1.88 nm. Smaller domain size and RMS value would lead to more effective charge separation and higher charge transport capacity.

The hole mobility was measured by the SCLC method with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PDFBC-DPP:PC71BM/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The mobility was determined by fitting the dark current, which is described by:10  where J is the current density, μ is the zero-field mobility of holes (μh), ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, d is the thickness of the blend film, and V is the effective voltage, V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage and Vbi is the built-in potential determined by the work function difference of the electrodes. Fig. 7 shows J–V curves for the hole-only devices. The mobilities are calculated from the slope of the curves. As mentioned before, the blend film with 2% DIO possesses smaller domain size and smaller RMS value than those without DIO, so the former exhibits higher hole mobility (1.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than the latter (1.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table S2†). As a result, the corresponding PSC device prepared with 2% DIO shows a higher Jsc value (14.58 mA cm−2) and PCE value (7.92%) compared with that fabricated without DIO (Table S2†).

In summary, a novel alternate copolymer PDFBC-DPP with DFBC as weak A units and DPP as strong A units was rationally designed and synthesized. The copolymer shows a low bandgap of 1.53 eV, a low HOMO energy level of −5.35 eV, and a wide absorption spectrum. The PSCs fabricated with PDFBC-DPP and PC71BM achieve a promising PCE of 7.92%, which is one of the highest values in PSCs based on the polymer with A–A structure. This work not only brings a novel electron-withdrawing building block for PSCs, but also provides a novel strategy for designing effective polymer photovoltaic materials by combining weak A units and strong A units.
