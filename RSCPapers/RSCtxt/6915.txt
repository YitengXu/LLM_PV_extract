Semiconductor-based photocatalytic hydrogen production technology is one of the ideal processes for direct solar energy conversion and storage that has been widely studied. The development of highly efficient photocatalysts is essential for the cost-effective and large-scale production of hydrogen. CdS-based semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted significant attention due to their unique advantages, including strong visible light absorption capacity, suitable band edge levels and excellent electronic charge transfer.

1. Introduction
Growing energy demands, excessive consumption of traditional fossil fuels and ever-increasing environmental pollution have spurred the search for clean, carbon-neutral alternative, abundant and inexhaustible energy resources.1–5 Hydrogen (H2), with its relative abundance of sources, a high energy density of 143 MJ kg−1 and environment-friendly non-polluting water as the sole combustion product, is proposed as a potential candidate for the future energy supply.6–8 H2 evolution from water can be achieved by the direct splitting of water molecules. However, this requires a pyrolysis temperature above 1800 K, which means that this process requires more energy and is of high cost.9 At present, the large-scale production of H2 used in industry is mainly carried out using fossil fuels by steam reforming of natural gas or similar high-energy consumption processes. Compared with these methods, solar-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution from water is a simple, low cost and environmentally benign route, which provides a promising solution to the worldwide ever-increasing energy demands and environmental issues.10–14 The approaches for solar driven water splitting mainly include thermochemical water splitting, photobiological water splitting, photocatalytic water splitting and photoelectrochemical water splitting.15 Among the numerous proposed technologies, semiconductor photocatalytic technology represents a promising alternative to convert and store solar energy into chemical H2 fuel.
In general, the main processes for photocatalytic water splitting over semiconductor catalysts involve the following steps,16 as shown in Fig. 1A, (i) absorption of solar energy by the semiconductor and generation of photogenerated charge carriers; (ii) photogenerated charge separation and diffusion from the photogenerated center to the semiconductor's surface; meanwhile, the recombination of charge carriers would occur in the bulk or on the surface with the energy dissipated as heat; (iii) charge carrier utilization for water reduction or oxidation on the photocatalyst surface producing H2 and O2, respectively. In these processes, the intrinsic properties of the semiconductor materials fundamentally determine the overall efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction.17 To achieve a high efficiency and efficiently utilize solar energy in photocatalytic performance, a suitable photocatalyst is crucial.

The semiconductor material should meet several requirements for realizing photocatalytic overall water splitting: (1) an appropriate bandgap for solar energy absorption. The band gap energy (Eg) of the photocatalyst should be >1.23 eV, covering most of or the whole visible light region is preferred. (2) a suitable conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) position, the CB should be more negative than the energy level of H2 evolution (at least 0 V vs. (NHE), pH = 0), while the VB should be more positive than the O2/H2O oxidation potential (1.23 eV vs. NHE, pH = 0) to trigger overall water splitting (Fig. 1B). (3) effective charge separation and (4) good chemical stability, low cost and environmentally benign characteristics.
Since the pioneering discovery of photoelectrochemical water splitting cell over a Pt/TiO2 electrode for H2 production by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,18 significant interest and considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of photocatalytic water splitting; numerous active semiconductor-based photocatalysts have been widely studied and extensively developed in photocatalytic water splitting.19–31 Although great progress has been made in the past four decades, there still remain several challenges in photocatalytic overall water splitting which are as follows: (1) most photocatalysts do not have a suitable band structure for overall water splitting, (2) the O2-evolution half reaction is considered as the greatest challenging step in the photocatalytic water splitting because of the four-electron transfer process coupled to the removal of four protons from H2O to form an O–O bond, thus, which causes the unmatched stoichiometric rates, (3) the produced H2 and O2 over the photocatalyst rapidly react back forming water especially on noble metal co-catalysts, resulting in the low overall energy conversion efficiency; at present, the maximum solar-to-hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency of CdS-based catalysts is 1.63%,32 which is far from the practical application requirement, and (4) application of catalysts like CdS and CdSe with suitable band positions for overall water splitting was limited by serious photocorrosion under visible light irradiation conditions.
To address these challenges, achieve high efficiency and utilize solar energy efficiently in photocatalytic overall water splitting for H2 evolution, a suitable photocatalyst is crucial. It is well known that metal sulfides especially cadmium sulfide is regarded as an excellent photocatalyst candidate for photocatalytic H2 production because of its versatile and fundamental properties. The CdS photocatalyst has two main crystal structures, wurtzite and zinc blende structures,33 as displayed in Fig. 2. Generally, bulk CdS has a hexagonal wurtzite-type crystal, and Cd and S atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated in the zinc blende phase with a cubic structure. Besides, CdS is a vital and classical II–VI semiconductor with a direct band gap of ca. 2.4 eV, which corresponds well with the visible spectral range of sunlight; it has suitable conduction band positions, which largely determine the reduction power of photogenerated carriers. As for CdS, the band positions perfectly satisfy the thermodynamic requirements for water splitting. Furthermore, the band structure and positions of CdS can be finely tuned by modifying its crystal structure and composition, resulting in significant enhancement of the light-harvesting capacity and the redox power.34–36 For a practical system, apart from a high efficiency, the chemical stability is a critical issue for realizing large-scale implementation of solar energy conversion. Unlike TiO2 with good photostability, metal sulfide photocatalysts are susceptible to corrosion under light illumination, and exhibit relatively low chemical stability due to the light induced photocorrosion. Photocorrosion is a severe concern associated with the practical applications of CdS semiconductor.

Considering that the long-term chemical stability of photocatalysts is a vital factor for technological applications, it is therefore highly required to surmount the photocorrosion of CdS-based composites in order to achieve stable performance for long-time photocatalytic water splitting. Particularly, various strategies have been implemented to tackle problems associated with photodecomposition, including the modification of the CdS crystal structure or morphology;37,38 for instance, Jing and Guo reported a novel method for the synthesis of CdS catalysts with different crystalline phases.39 The hexagonal-phase of CdS showed enhanced stability against photocorrosion and extremely high photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen production compared with the cubic CdS sample, which is attributed to the high crystallinity of hexagonal CdS with fewer surface oxygen atoms, leading to effective separation of the photogenerated charges resulting in hampering the photocorrosion process of CdS; heteroatom-doping.40,41 Shi et al. constructed interstitial P-doped CdS which was used for photocatalytic pure water splitting without any electron sacrificial agents.42 By interstitial P doping, the impurity level of S vacancies is near the Fermi level and becomes the electron trap level, which prolonged the lifetimes of photogenerated electrons. Effective evolution of H2 and O2 for overall water splitting over heterojunctions and Z-scheme catalysts was reported.43–45 Ai et al. reported a Ti3C2(TiO2)@CdS/MoS2 composite photocatalyst,46 with a H2 evolution rate of 344.74 μmol h−1 g−1. The Z-scheme between CdS and TiO2 offered a route for multi-step separation of electron–hole pairs. However, no comprehensive review has focused on the recent progress of CdS-based anti-photocorrosion photocatalysts for photocatalytic overall water splitting. This paper is focused on the recent advances in the anti-photocorrosion development of highly efficient CdS-based composites in photocatalytic overall water splitting.
2. Photocorrosion mechanisms of CdS
It is thought that the accumulation of excess photoinduced holes on the sulfide surface is the main reason for photocorrosion, which makes sulfides highly unstable as a photocatalyst. Electrons and holes will be generated if the metal sulfide is illuminated under suitable light irradiation, where photo-excited electrons will transfer to the surface smoothly, while the photo-generated holes will enrich on the outer surface of the sulfide before being consumed by the electron donors in the reaction systems.47 Under such circumstances, the oxidation of sulfide ions to sulphur and/or sulfate might take place, resulting in the oxidation of the photocatalyst and restricting its working properties in the photocatalytic reaction. In fact, the photocorrosion is not only relevant to the oxidation of the holes photo-induced by the semiconductor itself, but also related to the nascent formed oxygen in the water more significantly. Considering the factor of the higher solubility of oxygen in water than hydrogen, oxygen would cause more serious photocorrosion of CdS in the photocatalytic overall water splitting dispersion system. In addition, the oxygen would possibly combine with a light-induced electron forming an O2− radical, which could also accelerate the photocorrosion of CdS. Thus, two main pathways for the photocorrosion of metal sulfides are as follows (CdS as an example).48–50 The photocorrosion is caused by two holes leading to oxidation by reaction (2). (1) CdS + 2h+ → Cd2+ + S(2)
Meanwhile, the photocorrosion of CdS would take place in the presence of oxygen by reactions (3)–(5). CdS + 4h++2H2O + O2 → Cd2+ + SO42− + 4H+(3) O2 + 4e− + 2H+ → 2OH−(4) CdS + 2O2 → Cd2+ + SO42−(5)
3 Strategies for improving the photocatalytic stability of CdS-based catalysts
3.1 Removing the oxygen from the photocatalytic system
Although most CdS-based H2-evolution photocatalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity in the water reduction half-reaction system in the presence of sacrificial electron donors51–53 (such as methanol, ethanol, triethanolamine, lactic acid and Na2S/Na2SO3), from the practical application point of view, this half-reaction system for H2-evolution is less valuable because it consumes high-cost sacrificial reagents. Therefore, it is highly desirable to construct CdS-based catalysts for photocatalytic overall water splitting systems. Generally, the photogenerated holes have been taken into account as the main factor causing the photocorrosion of CdS semiconductor-based catalysts. However, as for the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction, the effect of nascent oxygen on the stability of semiconductors is often ignored. Besides, the solubility of oxygen in water is higher than that of hydrogen. It is known that the dissolved oxygen concentration can be 9.0 mg L−1 in pure water at 25 °C, while only very limited hydrogen can be dissolved under the same conditions. This high solubility of oxygen exhibits a detrimental impact on the CdS photocatalyst, which will lead to more serious photocorrosion of CdS. In addition, such a high concentration of oxygen in water also enhances the reverse recombination reaction of hydrogen and oxygen, because of the low activation energy (16.5 kJ mol−1) of the H2 and O2 recombination reaction whether under light irradiation or not over a cocatalyst, which further impedes the efficiency of water splitting in semiconductor dispersion.54 Therefore, it is necessary to remove O2 from the photocatalytic water splitting system by using an oxygen transfer reagent to enhance the photocatalytic stability and hydrogen evolution efficiency over CdS-based catalysts.

3.1.1 Perfluorodecalin. 
Perfluorodecalin, (PFDL, for the chemical structure see Fig. 3A) a completely fluorinated organic substance, is a superior artificial oxygen carrier with high oxygen combination capacity. In fact, PFDL, as an oxygen carrier, is already used as a substitute in artificial blood in medical operation. Besides, PFDL is both stable and chemically inert owing to the presence of very strong carbon-fluorine bonds in PFDL molecules.55 The oxygen solubility approaches 41.8 mL/100 mL (597 mg L−1) in PFDL at 25 °C, which is much higher than that of pure water.56,57 Based on the strong oxygen-carrying capacity of PFDL, the nascent formed oxygen would be captured by PFDL and transferred away from the CdS photocatalyst surface, thus the photocorrosion caused by oxygen would be inhibited, and the backward reaction of water splitting also might be successfully restrained. Hemin chloride (HC) also has the oxygen capture capacity. The chemical structure of HC is shown in Fig. 3B. PFDL exhibits about 20 times higher solubility with oxygen than HC.

3.1.2 Artificial gill. 
It is known that fish can extract the dissolved oxygen from the water through the gill in the water. The gill structure is shown in Fig. 4A. Gill is a typical respiratory organ of fish, which consists of gill arch, gill rake, gill filament, gill lamella, etc. Fish exchange the gas by gill lamella in the water. The gill wall is very thin, and contains a lot of capillaries. In the gills, the dissolved oxygen in the water is first absorbed by the capillaries, and the carbon dioxide is exchanged into the water in the meantime. One can achieve a similar function just using a gas diffusion polymer film, one side is water with dissolved oxygen and another side is bubbled with highly pure argon gas. In this way, the oxygen concentration difference accelerates oxygen diffusion from the water side to the gas side, and then the dissolved oxygen in water could be transferred from the reaction mixture to the gas phase. Actually this technique has been used to obtain oxygen from water, and the equipment is called artificial gill. We apply artificial gill to the photocatalytic overall water splitting system. The continuous argon gas was injected to decrease oxygen concentration in the gas side of the separation membrane; thus the dissolved oxygen would penetrate the separation membrane and move out of the reaction system.58Fig. 4B displays the schematic diagram of our artificial gill used in the photocatalytic reaction.

3.2 Isolation of holes from sulfide catalysts
In the metal sulfide suspension, such as CdS, a major factor that influences the stability of catalysts is the photogenerated holes. Thus an effective strategy to inhibit photocorrosion is to isolate the holes from the sulfide catalyst surface. Assembling a protection layer over the surface of sulfide catalysts is an efficient method to improve their resistance for photocorrosion. The layer over sulfides can facilitate charge transfer from the surface of the sulfide semiconductor to the protection layer, which impedes photogenerated hole oxidation of the sulfide catalyst. Such a protection layer can also inhibit chemical oxidation of sulfide in metal sulfides due to oxygen and oxygen radicals.58,59,63–65,69,72

3.2.1 TiO2 anti-photocorrosion layer. 
Coating wide band gap semiconductors has been proved to be a promising strategy for enhancing sulfide photocatalytic stability. Our group has fabricated a TiO2 layer over CdS (Pt-TiO2/CdS photocatalysts, as shown in Fig. 5A) and used this catalyst for photocatalytic overall water splitting with the aid of artificial gill.59 By modification of the TiO2 thin film over the CdS surface, the Pt-TiO2/CdS photocatalyst exhibited an obviously enhanced photocatalytic stability and excellent activity under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) (shown in Fig. 5B). With the help of artificial gill, the H2 evolution rate (3.074 μmol h−1 g−1) of modified Pt-TiO2/CdS was almost 6 times higher than that of the CdS sample (0.534 μmol h−1 g−1) under visible light for overall water splitting. In the meantime, that catalyst exhibited a higher stability. In this case, the photogenerated holes on the VB of CdS would first transfer to the TiO2 thin film, instead of oxidation of S2− in CdS, following the mechanism shown in Fig. 5C. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the used catalyst (shown in Fig. 5D) and the ICP analysis (shown in Fig. 5E) further confirmed the enhanced stability of Pt-TiO2/CdS. Both the ratio of S0/S(total) in XPS spectra and the concentration of Cd2+ of Pt-TiO2/CdS in dispersion after the reaction were much lower than those of pure CdS, revealing the protection effect of TiO2 layer on inhibition CdS photocorrosion. The artificial gill could remove nascent formed O2 from water; otherwise, the Pt-TiO2/CdS photocatalyst showed comparatively lower activity and stability in the absence of artificial gill in Fig. 5B (blue line). The removal of O2 in the photocatalytic system, on the one hand, could inhibit the oxygen leading CdS photocorrosion. On the other hand, it could prevent the hydrogen and oxygen back recombination to water, resulting in both high photocatalytic activity and stability toward overall water splitting.

3.2.2 Al2O3 anti-photocorrosion layer. 
Al2O3, as an Earth-abundant and stable metal oxide, has been widely applied as a supporter in catalysis with excellent chemical inertness.60–62 We fabricated a thin shell of chemically inert Al2O3 layer on the CdS surface. Loading the Al2O3 shell onto CdS surface is capable of remarkably improving the rate of H2 evolution (shown in Fig. 6).58 The average H2 production rate reaches 62.1 μmol h−1g−1 over Pt/CdS@Al2O3, the activity is approximately 126 times higher than that of CdS NPs, and its stability was maintained in several cycles as long as 30 h of reaction without any decrease. In contrast, the activity of Pt/CdS gradually decreased with sustained irradiation. This indicates that loading Pt does not effectively avoid CdS photocorrosion in a sacrificial agent-free solution. Pt even catalyzes a backward reaction, leading to the production of H2 and O2 forming H2O again. The Al2O3 shell served as a stable oxide matrix to protect the embedded CdS from photocorrosion by rapidly transferring the interfacial photogenerated holes. Instead, the oxygen produced on the Al2O3 surface improves both the photocatalytic activity and stability of the CdS catalyst toward overall water splitting.

3.2.3 Cr2O3 anti-photocorrosion layer. 
A CdS-Cr2O3 core/shell-structured catalyst was also identified as an excellent catalyst for photocatalytic overall water splitting. A one-dimensional CdS@Cr2O3 core/shell nanorod catalyst was developed by a one-step photodeposition process.63 The Cr2O3 shell was homogeneously coated on the surface of the CdS core as shown in Fig. 7A, with a good interfacial contact. Characterization indicated that one-dimensional CdS@Cr2O3 core/shell hetero-structures facilitated the highly efficient photogenerated charge separation and transfer from CdS to Cr2O3 under visible light illumination; in return, the photocorrosion of CdS was suppressed, following the route depicted in Fig. 7B. This speculation is further proved by the transient photocurrent response. As displayed in Fig. 7C, CdS@Cr2O3/Pt shows a higher transient photocurrent, suggesting that Cr2O3 could effectively suppress charge carrier recombination. As a result, a significant enhancement of the H2 evolution activity has been achieved, about 126.6 μmol g−1 in 2 h without any sacrificial reagent addition under visible light irradiation; the corresponding apparent AQE is 0.22% at 430 nm. Meanwhile, the photocatalyst exhibited an excellent stability; no significant decay of activity was observed after the multi-cycle runs in photocatalytic water splitting (Fig. 7D).

3.2.4 WO3. 
Apart from the fabrication of a layer of anti-photocorrosion layer on CdS, loading an oxygen evolution co-catalyst, such as WO3, is a good way to enhance charge separation, transfer and reaction performance, typically for the hole-related anodic reaction. The Ce-doped WO3-CdS heterostructure photocatalyst was a good example.64 As shown in Fig. 8A, the Ce-doped WO3 combined with CdS particles doped with Pt (CPWC) exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance and photostability for water splitting to hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of PFDL, the corresponding amount of produced H2 achieved 186.2 μmol in 4 h under visible light irradiation, and no significant decrease of activity has been observed after more than 24 h reaction. In order to ensure that no photocorrosion takes place, BaCl2 titration and ICP detection methods were used, the former is very sensitive for sulfite ions formed in a water splitting reaction, and the latter is quite effective for the detection of Cd2+ ions from photocorrosion. There was no precipitate in BaCl2 titration experiments in the catalyst dispersion after illumination of 24 h reaction, only a trace amount of Cd2+ was detected, confirming the inhibition of the photoinduced CdS photocorrosion role of WO3 loading. The improved stability might be attributed to the hole isolation role of WO3. In fact, the CPWC photocatalysts exhibited much faster charge transfer and low charge recombination properties, as shown in time-resolved photoluminescence spectra in Fig. 8B, i.e., a significant quenching after the Ce doped WO3 decoration. The results of fluorescence quench experiments imply the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in that catalyst, which leads to significantly improved photocatalytic stability of the CdS catalyst.

3.2.5 Ni2P. 
Noble metals are excellent co-catalyst for photocatalytic H2 production, but they can also catalyze the recombination of H2 and O2, which is harmful for highly efficient hydrogen evolution in photocatalytic water splitting. To avoid the backward reaction, transition-metal phosphide was applied to replace noble metals. A recent study indicated that Ni2P can reduce the recombination probability of hydrogen and oxygen, enhancing the photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting over CdS.65 Zhen et al. found that the core-shelled Ni2P@CdS photocatalyst synthesized by the solvothermal method was active for water splitting as shown in Fig. 9. The highest photocatalytic activity was achieved with 10 wt% Ni2P loading, and the corresponding H2 evolution rate was 837.94 μmol h−1 g−1, which exceeded that of Pt@CdS by a factor of 28.7 according to the results shown in Fig. 9C. In addition, the Ni2P@CdS catalyst exhibited satisfactory stability and photoactivity for 12 h (Fig. 9D). The apparent quantum efficiency was 3.89% for hydrogen evolution under 430 nm irradiation. The detected concentration of S2− in the solutions after the long term reaction was very low (see Fig. 9E), indicating the efficient inhibition of photocorrosion of CdS over Ni2P@CdS.

3.2.6 NiO. 
Construction of Zn1−xCdxS solid solutions has been identified to be an effective strategy to improve photocatalytic performance, because the bandgap and band edge position of Zn1−xCdxS solid solutions can be flexibly tuned by adjusting the value of x to improve the photocatalytic activity,66–68 however, the Zn1−xCdxS solid solution catalysts have to face serious photocorrosion during the water splitting reaction. To restrain the photocorrosion of Zn1−xCdxS solid solution photocatalysts, introducing a protection layer has been found to be an efficient strategy. An ultrathin NiO layer has been assembled onto Zn0.8Cd0.2S through an in situ photodeposition method for overall water splitting.69 The optimized NiO/Zn0.8Cd0.2S nanocomposite exhibited a remarkable H2-production rate of 99.9 μmol h−1 g−1 with 10 wt% of NiO (Fig. 10A), which is even better than that of 2 wt% Pt loaded Zn0.8Cd0.2S. The good stability of the NiO/Zn0.8Cd0.2S photocatalyst is evidenced by multi-cycle runs for photocatalytic H2 evolution as illustrated in Fig. 10B. The NiO/Zn0.8Cd0.2S catalyst achieved a high AQE of 0.66% at a wavelength of 430 nm as shown in Fig. 10C. The photocatalytic activity and stability of Zn0.8Cd0.2S were significantly improved by loading an ultrathin catalytically active NiO layer. The NiO layer also promoted the highly efficient charge separation and migration from Zn0.8Cd0.2S to NiO and the prolonged lifetime of the photogenerated electrons, which is evidenced by the Nyquist plots displayed in Fig. 10D. The NiO/Zn0.8Cd0.2S exhibits a depressed semicircle at high frequencies as compared to the pure Zn0.8Cd0.2S, the charge-transfer resistance Rct of NiO/Zn0.8Cd0.2S is 137.9 Ω, which is smaller than that of Zn0.8Cd0.2S (150.7 Ω). Comparatively, Zn0.8Cd0.2S itself showed serious photocorrosion and activity decrease.

3.2.7 MnO2. 
For CdS catalysts, another fatal weakness is H2O2 related oxidation. CdS is easily subjected to being seriously poisoned by H2O2, ultimately causing rapid inactivation.70,71 Unfortunately, the kinetically competing two-electron reaction from water into H2O2 is somehow easier to occur during the photocatalytic overall water splitting process. Our group tried a novel strategy to overcome this kind of CdS photocorrosion by fabricating a H2O2 decomposing active MnO2 thin-layer over CdS nanowires (displayed in Fig. 11A) while assembling oxygen separation artificial gill to remove nascent formed oxygen in the dispersion.72 The NiSe/MnO2-CdS photocatalyst exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution amount among different catalysts as shown in Fig. 11C. The H2 and O2 evolution proceeds continuously in a close molar ratio of 2:1 over NiSe/MnO2-CdS in ultrapure water (Fig. 11D). The H2O2 accumulation in the reaction solution was detected by UV–vis absorption spectra (as shown in Fig. 11E) via monitoring the typical absorption peak at 437 nm. After introducing MnO2 into NiSe/CdS, the peak at 437 nm disappeared, revealing that the produced H2O2 during the reaction was decomposed by MnO2. In this case, MnO2 protects CdS from being poisoned through the decomposition of H2O2 into water and O2. No obvious activity decay during four successive cycles over NiSe/MnO2-CdS suggests its relatively stable photochemical stability (in Fig. 11F).

4. Summary and future outlook
In this review, we attempt to provide a panorama of basic principle and mechanisms with regard to improving the photostability and durability of CdS-based catalysts for photocatalytic overall water splitting. Engineering the interface by coating a protection layer onto the CdS surface can inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and facilitate charge separation, which will effectively hamper the photoinduced corrosion of semiconductor-based photocatalysts. In addition, we apply oxygen transfer reagents (AG or PFDL) to remove nascent O2 from water to prevent the oxygen leading CdS photocorrosion and to inhibit the hydrogen and oxygen recombination back to water. By these strategies, the CdS-based semiconductor achieved satisfactory stability for photocatalytic overall water splitting under visible light irradiation.
There are still challenges to realize a highly efficient H2 production from solar driven water splitting catalyzed by semiconductor photocatalysts. The current CdS based photocatalysts for overall water splitting are still far from being optimized for sustainable H2 production from water both on economic and environmental points of view. Further work in this field should be focused on the following aspects: (1) development of a more efficient protection and anti-photocorrosion layer over the CdS catalyst; (2) development of more efficient oxygen separation technology to remove the nascent formed oxygen, and decrease the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the catalyst dispersion as low as possible and inhibition of the oxygen related photocorrosion; (3) constructing novel and more effective co-catalysts over the CdS catalyst to enhance the photocatalytic activity and stability; (4) scale-up identification of the catalyst and reaction system is urgently expected. Only if those obstacles are overcome, photocatalytic overall water splitting from pure water to obtain hydrogen can be applied in solar fuel conversion.
