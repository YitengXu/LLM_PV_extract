    , Accepted 5th May 2017First published on 8th May 2017AbstractThe sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction has severely hindered the energetic convenience of electrolytic water splitting. Herein, we demonstrate that a CoS2 nanoarray on Ti mesh (CoS2/TiM) behaves as an efficient and durable catalyst for the hydrazine oxidation reaction in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine, which requires the potential of 125 mV to achieve 100 mA cm−2. The high hydrogen-evolving activity of CoS2/TiM makes it a bifunctional catalyst for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen generation by replacing water oxidation with hydrazine oxidation. To drive 100 mA cm−2, its two-electrode electrolyzer demands a low cell voltage of only 0.81 V and it exhibits remarkable long-term electrochemical durability and nearly 100% Faradic efficiency for hydrogen evolution.
The exploitation of hydrogen, which is a clean, reliable and sustainable energy carrier, has been widely advocated to meet the increasing threat of global climate change and energy crisis.1,2 Among the different methods for hydrogen production, electrochemical water splitting has drawn increasing attention due to its clean and highly efficient energy conversion to produce hydrogen.3–6 However, as a half reaction, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) significantly hinders the overall efficiency of water splitting due to the high activation energy barrier for O–O bond formation.7–9 Encouragingly, this issue can be solved by replacing the electrooxidation of water at the anode with the oxidation of more readily oxidizable species, such as alcohols, urea, and ammonia;4,10–15 however, this strategy suffers from the involvement of noble metal catalysts or limited catalytic currents. On the other hand, the use of bifunctional catalysts for the anodic reaction and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has additional advantages of simplifying the system and lowering the fabrication cost. Thus, it is highly attractive but still remains a key challenge to develop energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production systems based on earth-abundant bifunctional catalysts that are efficient for both reactions.
The standard potential for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is −0.38 V which is much lower than that of the OER (+1.23 V).16 In addition, the HzOR only releases nitrogen and water without the generation of catalyst-poisoning species.17–19 Since hydrazine is widely used in industry,20 it is significant to replace the OER with the HzOR for more energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen production. Efficient electrocatalysts are required to lower the reaction potential. Co has emerged as an interesting transition metal with catalytic power toward the HzOR. The Co-based catalyst materials reported include Co complexes21,22 and metallic Co.23,24 CoS2 possesses remarkable electrical conductivity,25 which is of great benefit for enhanced electrochemical performances. Indeed, considerable recent research has focused on its utilization as an electrode material for lithium ion batteries25,26 and supercapacitors27 as well as a catalyst material for sensitized solar cells,28,29 oxygen reduction reaction30 and HER.31,32 To the best of our knowledge, however, no attention has been paid on its use for HzOR electrocatalysis and as a bifunctional catalyst for less energy-intensive electrochemical hydrogen production.
Herein, we describe our recent effort to develop a CoS2 nanoarray on Ti mesh (CoS2/TiM) as a durable non-noble-metal catalyst for the HzOR which requires the potential of 125 mV to achieve 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine. The high HER activity of CoS2/TiM makes it an attractive bifunctional catalyst for hydrogen generation by replacing the OER with HzOR. The corresponding two-electrode electrolyzer employing CoS2/TiM for simultaneous H2 and N2 production only requires a cell voltage of 0.81 V to drive 100 mA cm−2, which is 1.07 V less than that for pure water splitting, with remarkable long-term electrochemical durability and nearly 100% Faradic efficiency (FE) for hydrogen evolution.
The CoS2 nanoarray was developed on TiM via topotactic conversion from its Co(OH)F precursor33 on TiM (Co(OH)F/TiM). After hydrothermal reaction, the color of the TiM substrate changed from dark grey to pink and black after sulfidation (Fig. S1, ESI†). Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the substrate, precursor and catalyst. The hydrothermal product exhibits peaks corresponding to Co(OH)F (JCPDS 50-0827) and Ti mesh (JCPDS 44-1294), in accordance with previous reports.33 After the sulfidation process, it shows diffraction peaks at 32.5°, 36.5°, 38.6°, 46.6° and 55.2° which are indexed to the (200), (210), (211), (220) and (311) planes of CoS2, respectively (JCPDS No. 41-1471), and the other peaks originate from the Ti substrate. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicates that TiM (Fig. 1b) was completely covered with the Co(OH)F nanowire array (Fig. 1c and d) after hydrothermal treatment. After sulfidation, the product still maintained its integrated feature and morphology but with rougher surface (Fig. 1e). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a single CoS2 nanowire in Fig. 1f suggests that it is about 60 nm in diameter. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image taken from the CoS2 nanowire reveals well-resolved lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.226 nm corresponding to the (211) plane of the CoS2 phase (inset of Fig. 1f). Fig. 1g presents the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image, where several bright rings are made up of discrete spots, which can be indexed to the planes of CoS2 perfectly. Fig. 1h shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum in the Co 2p region. The peaks at the binding energies (BEs) of 800.0 and 783.5 eV are assigned to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, which are accompanied by two satellite peaks (identified as “Sat.”) at 803.0 and 787.0 eV, respectively.34 With regards to the S region (Fig. 1i), the peaks at 164.2 and 163.1 eV reflect the BEs of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively, which are typical to metal–sulphur bonds.35,36 Also, the peak at 169.7 eV can be assigned to S–O species arising from surface oxidation.37

We studied the HzOR activity of CoS2/TiM using a typical three-electrode setup at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in alkaline media. The ohmic potential drop loss from the solution resistance was applied to all initial data38 and all potentials were reported on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale unless otherwise stated. Fig. 2a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of CoS2/TiM toward different concentrations of hydrazine. As observed, there is no anodic current response within the investigated potential window in 1.0 M KOH. In sharp contrast, the addition of 20 mM hydrazine leads to a sharp rise in anodic current and an increase in hydrazine concentration gives a higher current density. These observations suggest that CoS2/TiM is an efficient catalyst electrode for the HzOR. Fig. 2b compares the HzOR performances of CoS2/TiM, Co(OH)F/TiM, bare TiM and platinum foil (Pt), which suggests that TiM is not active for the HzOR and Co(OH)F/TiM has poor HzOR activity. Remarkably, the CoS2/TiM electrode is highly active for the HzOR and only demands a low potential of 125 mV to drive 100 mA cm−2, which is even lower than that of Pt (η100mAcm−2 = 229 mV) and other catalysts (Table S1, ESI,† and implies that CoS2/TiM is superior for electrochemical HzOR catalysis). The HzOR kinetics was also studied by comparing the Tafel plots of CoS2/TiM and Pt (Fig. 2c). The Tafel slope of 48 mV dec−1 for CoS2/TiM is much lower than that of Pt (63 mV dec−1), which suggests its more favorable catalytic kinetics for the HzOR. Fig. 2d shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, which reveals that CoS2/TiM has a lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and thus a higher reaction rate and more rapid catalytic kinetics than Co(OH)F/TiM.39 Moreover, its lower series resistance (Rs) indicates that CoS2/TiM (4.43 Ω) has better electrical conductivity than Co(OH)F/TiM (14.05 Ω).32Fig. 2e presents the LSV curves of CoS2/TiM at different scan rates. This CoS2/TiM electrode only shows slight changes with an increase in the scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1, which also suggests efficient charge and mass transport for the HzOR catalytic process.9,13 The 10 h long-term electrolysis at a constant current density of 50 mA cm−2 further manifests the superior durability of CoS2/TiM towards the HzOR (Fig. 2f). The XRD analysis indicates that this catalyst is still CoS2 in nature (Fig. S2, ESI†). These results reveal the prominent durability and stability of the CoS2/TiM electrode.

(d) Nyquist plots for Co(OH)F/TiM and CoS2/TiM in the frequency range of 1–105 Hz with the equivalent circuit (inset). (e) LSV curves of the CoS2/TiM electrode at different scan rates (inset: the corresponding data re-plotted as the current density at 0.2 V for different scan rates). (f) Chronopotentiometric curve of CoS2/TiM with a constant current density of 50 mA cm−2. All experiments were carried out in 1.0 M KOH. 
We further evaluated the HzOR and OER performances of the CoS2/TiM electrode. As shown in Fig. 3a, this electrode demands 1.67 V to 150 mAcm−2 for OER electrocatalysis, which is 1.5 V more than that needed for the HzOR, thus suggesting that the HzOR is much more energy-efficient than OER. To successfully couple the HER and HzOR for energy-efficient H2 production, the CoS2/TiM electrode should maintain an excellent HER performance in the presence of hydrazine. In Fig. 3b, the HER LSV curves of CoS2/TiM in 1.0 M KOH before and after the addition of 100 mM hydrazine overlay almost exactly with each other, which implies that the presence of 100 mM hydrazine has a negligible influence on the HER performance of CoS2/TiM. It needs an overpotential of 178 mV to drive 10 mA cm−2, which compares favorably to the behaviors of other HER catalyst such as cattierite-type CoS2 (η10mAcm−2 = ∼244 mV)40 and CoS2 nanopyramids (η10mAcm−2 = ∼250 mV).31 A detailed comparison is shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The time-dependent current density curve under a static overpotential of 270 mV (Fig. 3c) suggests that CoS2/TiM maintains its HER catalytic activity for at least 20 h and the XRD pattern of the catalyst after the HER is also consist with that of the pristine catalyst shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which also shows the robustness of the CoS2 nanoarray.

(b) LSV curves of CoS2/TiM for the HER at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH with and without 100 mM hydrazine. (c) Time-dependent current density curve of CoS2/TiM for the HER under the static overpotential of 270 mV for 20 h. 
These results show the potential of using CoS2/TiM as an efficient and durable bifunctional catalyst for the HzOR and HER toward energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production. To this end, we fabricated a two-electrode electrolyzer using CoS2/TiM as both the cathode for the HER and anode for the HzOR. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the CoS2/TiM‖CoS2/TiM couple needs cell voltages of 0.49, 0.63 and 0.81 V to achieve 20, 50 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, in 1.0 m KOH with 100 mM hydrazine. To drive the corresponding current densities, however, required much larger voltages of 1.55, 1.73 and 1.89, respectively, without the presence of hydrazine. This observation demonstrates that replacing the OER with the HzOR in the anode offers quite an effective way to lower the potential needed and attain a higher current density. Fig. 4c shows the chronopotentiometric curve of the CoS2/TiM‖CoS2/TiM couple. As observed, a cell voltage of 0.52 V is required to maintain 25 mA cm−2 for 20000 s. At a cell voltage of 0.8 V, vigorous gas evolution occurs on both electrodes (Movie S1, ESI†). The amount of generated H2 was further measured quantitatively using a calibrated pressure sensor to monitor the pressure changes in the cathode compartments of an H-type electrolytic cell.33 As shown in Fig. 4d, the generated H2 roughly matches the calculated result based on the passed charge which suggests a nearly 100% FE.

(d) Amount of hydrogen theoretically calculated and experimentally measured vs. time for the CoS2/TiM‖CoS2/TiM electrolyzer. All experiments were carried out in 1.0 M KOH. 
In summary, the CoS2 nanoarray has been proven as an efficient and stable non-noble-metal catalyst for the HzOR in alkaline media. Its high HER activity enables it as a bifunctional catalyst for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen generation by replacing the OER with HzOR. The corresponding two-electrode system only needs a cell voltage of 0.81 V to drive 100 mA cm−2 with strong long-term electrochemical durability and nearly 100% FE for hydrogen evolution. The superior catalytic activity and stability of this CoS2 nanoarray, along with its scalable and low-cost fabrication process, promise its future use as an attractive earth-abundant 3D catalyst electrode toward economical and large-scale hydrazine-assisted hydrogen generation for applications.39,41–43
