    , Accepted 14th May 2018First published on 18th May 2018AbstractSolar steam generation is a promising application for utilizing exhaustless solar energy for steam generation, desalination, sterilization, and water treatment. Over the past several decades, scientists have made many attempts to design rational structures to promote evaporation efficiency including optimizing optical absorption, photothermal conversion, heat localization, and water transportation. Here, an efficient solar steam generation device was fabricated through decorating a nonstoichiometric W18O49 mesocrystal, as a solar light-to-heat material, onto a hydrophilic PTFE membrane. Nonstoichiometric W18O49 mesocrystals were incorporated into the membrane, and confirmed by the XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS characterizations, which can transfer light to heat after absorbing sunlight and lead to water evaporation on a local area of a membrane. The structure of the solar steam generation device was confirmed by the results of SEM and contact angle measurements, which insured the solar steam generation device self-floated on top of water, thereby providing a continuous water supply to the local area heated by the W18O49 mesocrystals from bulk water. Under one sun illumination, the evaporated water mass loss reached 1.13 kg m−2 for a membrane thickness of M/A = 9.83 g m−2 after 1 h irradiation, and the membrane showed a high efficiency of 80.7%. Limit of water evaporation rate for the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane was further calculated to be 1.15 kg m−2 after 1 h one-sun irradiation, with a limit of efficiency of 82.0%. The salinities of simulated seawater reduced to levels far below the World Health Organization's (WHO) standard after desalination. The rational design enhancing evaporation performance also provides enlightenment for further practical applications of solar steam generation technology.
Introduction
Solar steam generation is a prospective strategy to mitigate freshwater shortages in some parts of the world, by utilizing exhaustless and renewable solar energy.1–4 Although solar steam generation, a highly promising method for water purification, has been proven to be technically available, low evaporation efficiency has hindered further practical applications.5–7 To achieve higher evaporation efficiency, much effort has been made by employing novel materials as light-to-heat conversion materials, such as carbon materials,8–11 noble metal materials,12–17 and polymer materials.18 Transition metal oxides, which have higher chemical stability and availability, have received little attention. However, recent research indicates that transition metal oxides with oxygen-deficient defects, such as nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide or molybdenum oxide, have tunable localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs).19–21 Among them, nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide nanocrystals are of great interest because of strong LSPRs, which give rise to strong photoabsorption in the visible and near infrared region.22 An example is tungsten oxide with defect engineering to efficiently couple solar energy causing oxygen activation.23 Due to its unusual defect structure and intense visible and near infrared absorption, nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide has been examined for various applications such as photocatalysts,24,25 photothermal therapy,26,27 and electrochromism.28,29
Rational structure designs are also important for solar steam generation devices to realize highly efficient evaporation.30,31 Over the past decades, many efforts have been made to promote evaporation efficiency by optimizing the structures of devices including light absorption,15,32–34 water transportation,35–38 self-floating,8,36 heat localization37,39–42 and so on. For example, a floating solar receiver, which employed foam and a fabric wick in the center to insure floating of the entire structure and water supply, was reported to generate high-temperature vapor.36 Porous carbon from mushrooms, placed in polystyrene foam, has excellent properties of light absorption due to their natural structures that is favorable for water supply and vapor escape.33 For ideal solar steam generation devices, their compatibility with water needs to be artfully controlled. A hydrophobic surface can help to make the device self-float on the water surface, which is beneficial to interfacial heating and decreasing heat loss. Hydrophilic and porous features of solar absorbers were underlined for solar steam generation devices in order to imbibe water passively,43,44 which might affect the water–solid interface to influence a steam generation procedure and guarantee water supply for continuous evaporation.35,37
In this paper, a nonstoichiometric W18O49 mesocrystal modified PTFE membrane was employed to fabricate solar steam generation devices, with an efficiency of as high as 80.7%. A nonstoichiometric W18O49 mesocrystal was chosen as a photothermal material that possesses a broad light band and efficiently converts solar light to heat for water evaporation due to its defect structure. A W18O49 mesocrystal was wrapped with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which ensured an evaporation device self-floating on the water's surface. A hydrophilic porous PTFE membrane as the bottom layer ensured sustained water transportation. Their applications as solar steam generation devices were demonstrated and improved efficiency was observed versus cases with control experiments, with evaporated water mass reaching 1.13 kg m−2 after 1 h one-sun irradiation. Moreover, the ion concentrations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) of the resulting water decreased to levels far below the drinking-water standards of the World Health Organization (WHO).
Experimental
Reagents and materials
All of the reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Tungsten chloride (WCl6, 99%) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. n-Butanol was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. PDMS was purchased from Dow Corning Limited (Sylgard 184). Deionized water (18.25 MΩ cm) was used with the experiments.
Synthesis of W18O49 mesocrystal
Materials were synthesized using a facile one-pot solution strategy. In a typical procedure, WCl6 (100 mg) was dissolved in n-butanol (30 mL) with and without 0.40 g PDMS. After that, the obtained solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. The dark blue product was collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol, and dried in vacuum at 60 °C.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 advanced X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) characterizations were performed with a JEM-2100 operated at 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were obtained using a ZEISS Gemini 300 field-emission scanning electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained with a ThermoFisher SCIENTIFIC ESCALAB 250 spectrophotometer. Absorbance spectra were collected using a U-4100 Hitachi spectrometer. The temperature change of a WO NBLs thin membrane under one sun illumination was monitored by an infrared thermal imaging camera (S6-a, IRS, China). The wetting properties were recorded with an Attension TL101 (Biolin Scientific). The salt water contained four ions to simulate sea water for desalination. The contents of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were measured by atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-AES, Atomscan Advantage).
Fabrication of W18O49@PDMS thin membrane
A flow-through method was used to fabricate a W18O49@PDMS thin membrane. Briefly, a W18O49@PDMS suspension was drawn into the injector, and then passed through a commercial hydrophilic PTFE membrane (25 mm diameter, 0.22 mm pore size) which was placed into a suitable filter paper holder. A thin tungsten oxide layer was formed on top of the PTFE substrate.
Evaporation performance measurement under one sun
The evaporation performance measurement was performed with a xenon lamp (LSH-X500, Zolix, power = 500 W, spectral region = 200–2500 nm, input voltage = 220 V, and output current = 26 A). The optical power on the sample surface was measured by a radiometer (Beijing Normal University Photoelectric Instrument Factory, FZ-A). Water was held in a beaker (3.2 cm diameter), and the W18O49 mesocrystal thin membrane was self-floated on top of the water. The temperature was captured by an infrared thermal imaging camera (S6-a, IRS, China). The weight of water evaporated was recorded by an electronic mass balance (0.1 mg in accuracy). The evaporation efficiency (η) was calculated based on the following equation:8,35η = mhLV/Iwhere η is evaporation efficiency, m is the evaporation rate, hLV is the total enthalpy of sensible heat (315 J g−1, from 25 to 100 °C with specific heat of 4.2 J g K−1), and phase change of liquid to water (2256 J g−1), and I is the solar illumination energy.
Results and discussion
Solar-driven interfacial evaporation device design
There are two main factors for achieving high evaporation performance among the solar steam generation devices: water transportation and broadband light absorption.13,38 As depicted in Fig. 1, membrane fabrication involves a hydrophobic W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal stacked on a hydrophilic PTFE substrate, which has all these factors. First, the upper layer of a W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal exhibits a broad absorption band due to their unique oxygen vacancies, appreciably overlapping with the solar spectrum, thus they result in effectively converting solar light to heat. The PDMS, encapsulated onto the W18O49 mesocrystal, plays a role in making the W18O49 mesocrystal membrane self-float on top of water without extra float support. Second, the bottom layer of a hydrophilic PTFE membrane is hydrophilic and porous, which guarantees continuous water transportation through capillarity when a W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane floats on the interface of water. On the other hand, a PTFE membrane is anti-acid–base, flexible, high temperature resistant, and possesses mechanical strength and stability. Therefore, a PTFE membrane becomes an ideal support material to enhance the mechanical strength and stability of a W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals membrane. The ability of light-to-heat W18O49 mesocrystals stays stable even over multiple cycles. The membrane fabrication involves a hydrophobic W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal stacked on a hydrophilic PTFE substrate. Due to hydrophobicity of W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal, a bi-layered membrane was built. Two functions of solar steam generation, solar absorption and water pumping, are decoupled into different layers, with an upper hydrophobic W18O49 mesocrystals layer for light absorption and water evaporation, and a bottom hydrophilic PTFE membrane for pumping water. The steam generation process is summarized as follows: under solar illumination, a W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal will absorb solar light and convert it to thermal heat to heat interfacial water. Then, water turns to steam and escapes to the atmosphere. Along with the upper water evaporating sustainably, bulk water is transported constantly to the photothermal layer through capillarity of the hydrophilic PTFE membrane, which guarantees a sustained water supply.

Characterization of the evaporation device
The physicochemical characteristics of as-obtained products were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). The W18O49 mesocrystals were prepared by a one-pot solvothermal method using WCl6 as the tungsten source and n-butanol as the solvent. Fig. S1† displays the XRD patterns of as-synthesized W18O49 mesocrystals with and without PDMS at 180 °C for 24 h. W18O49 and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals have the same diffraction peak position. All the peaks are consistent with a monoclinic W18O49 phase (JCPDS no. 71–2450). The lattice parameters (structure type P2/m) are a = 18.334, b = 3.786, and c = 14.044. The (010) diffraction peak becomes stronger and sharper upon the addition of PDMS, whereas other peaks remain similar in shape and intensity. It is suggested that PDMS increases crystallinity of the W18O49 mesocrystals. The TEM images, as shown in Fig. 2a and c, indicate that W18O49 and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals all possess uniformly bamboo leaves morphology, a length of ≈600–800 nm, and a diameter of ≈50 nm. As shown in Fig. S2,† the magnified TEM images show that the hierarchical W18O49 bundle is a crystal with uniform morphology and structure assembled by ordered 3–5 nm nanowires. Further details of W18O49 and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals were analyzed using HRTEM and SAED. As shown in the inset in Fig. 2a and c, the HRTEM images of a W18O49 mesocrystal with and without PDMS show clear lattice fringes and an interplanar distance of 0.38 nm, which are well matched with the (010) lattice of W18O49. As depicted in Fig. 2b and d, SAED shows that all the nanowires are structurally uniform and the particle behavior has an oriented crystallographic direction due to single-crystalline-like diffraction spots and strong diffraction of (010). The spots on the pattern can be attributed to an overlay along [401] zone axes of the W18O49 mesocrystal and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal. The TEM and SAED images indicate that the synthesized W18O49 mesocrystal and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal grow along the [010] direction. This is similar to findings reported in other papers.45 The results suggest that PDMS makes no difference on morphology and nanostructure of W18O49 mesocrystals.

Chemical components of the W18O49 and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals were further examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The full-range XPS spectra of the W18O49 and the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal are shown in Fig. S3.† It is clear that peaks at binding energies are relational with oxygen and tungsten, and no impurities were found except carbon. As shown in Fig. 2e and g, the W 4f core-level spectrum of the W18O49 and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal could be attributable to two doublets, which corresponds to two different oxidation states of tungsten atoms. For the W18O49 mesocrystal, the main peaks of the W 4f spectrum were assigned to W6+ 4f5/2, and W6+ 4f7/2, which are located at 37.8 eV and 35.7 eV. The other doublets are derived from emission of W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 core levels from W5+, which are observed at 34.6 eV and 36.7 eV. For the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal, the main peaks are located at 38.2 eV and 36.0 eV and assigned to W6+ 4f5/2 and W6+ 4f7/2 and 34.6 eV and 36.8 eV assigned to W5+ 4f5/2 and W5+ 4f7/2. On the basis of former research, the characteristic states of W18O49 nanomaterials are these two oxidation states.42 The results reveal that PDMS does not destroy oxide defects of the W18O49 mesocrystal. As depicted in Fig. 2f, the O 1s spectrum of the W18O49 mesocrystal shows that the peak at binding energy 530.5 eV is confirmed to be from the oxygen bond with tungsten atoms. The other peak at 532.2 eV may corresponded to the C–O bond which derives from the residual adsorbed molecules. Similarly, the peaks of the O 1s spectrum, as shown in Fig. 2h, located at 530.8 eV and 532.1 eV are attributable to the W–O–W bond and the C–O bond resulting from the remnant adsorbed molecules from the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal.46 There is an extra peak at 533.6 eV appearing in the spectrum, which is assigned to Si–O–Si.47,48 These results show that PDMS is coated on the surface of the W18O49 mesocrystal and has no influence on the oxidation states of tungsten atoms.
The morphologies of the PTFE membrane and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane were characterized by SEM, as shown in Fig. 3. The PTFE membrane possesses a porous property, as shown in Fig. 3a, which favours water transportation from bulk water to the W18O49 heating layer though wicking ability. To improve the photothermal effect, a nonstoichiometric W18O49 mesocrystal was incorporated into the PTFE membrane. As depicted in Fig. 3b, the SEM image of that W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane was shown to have interwoven W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals making up the upper photothermal layer. The porosity property of the unordered W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals membrane offers effective vapor channels. As shown in Fig. 3c, the cross-sectional SEM image of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane reveals that W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals were retained and stacked directly on the PTFE substrate. The digital images, as shown in Fig. 3d, exhibit excellent flexibility and self-floating ability of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane.

Dynamic wetting of water droplets on the PTFE membrane and water dispersion on W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membranes were further tested by contact angle measurements. Fig. S4† reveals that a water droplet sucks into the PTFE membrane quickly; that means a PTFE membrane can provide efficient water transportation. As shown in Fig. 4a, the top layer of the native W18O49 mesocrystal shows a hydrophilic property, which does not favor the W18O49 mesocrystal stacking on the PTFE membrane and self-floating of a solar steam generation device. Hydrophobic PDMS49 was selected as encapsulation for the W18O49 mesocrystal to realize self-floating of the steam generation device. As shown in Fig. 4e, the top layer of the W18O49@PDMS membrane displays an obvious hydrophobic behavior. As shown in Fig. 4b–d and f–h, compared with the bottom layer of the W18O49 mesocrystal membrane, the wetting properties of the bottom layer of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane show a subtle change, which proves PDMS has negligible influence on water transportation in the PTFE membrane. The ability of self-floating of the membrane and wetting properties of the W18O49 mesocrystal are changed by PDMS, while the hydrophilicity of the PTFE membrane was maintained. The results show that the W18O49 mesocrystal membrane, which satisfied the self-floating of a membrane and water transportation simultaneously, was fabricated for next evaporation tests.

Evaporation performance under one sun
Non-stoichiometric tungsten oxides exhibit strong photoabsorption in the visible and near infrared region due to their unique defect structure. Fig. 5a shows the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption spectroscopy results. The W18O49 mesocrystal presents a dark blue color and these UV-vis-NIR spectra display a broad absorption band of 550–2500 nm, appreciably overlapping with the solar spectrum. The assembled three-dimensional structure of the W18O49 mesocrystal exhibits the intensive LSPR absorption in visible and near infrared regions, which proves the mesocrystal consists of a large number of oxygen vacancies. Absorption coefficients were obtained from absorption spectra. Band gaps were calculated by the following equation:αhν = A(hν − Eg)1/2where A is a constant, α is the absorption coefficient, hν the incident photon energy, and Eg is the band gap. Eg could be obtained by extrapolating the linear region of plots of (αhν)1/2vs. hν. As shown in Fig. S4,† the value was determined to be about 2.7 eV for the W18O49 mesocrystal and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals. The absorption coefficients of W18O49 and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals were calculated. Band gap was calculated by the Beer–Lambert law, A = εbc, where A is absorbance, ε is absorption coefficient, b is optical length of absorption cell, and c is concentration. The absorption coefficients of W18O49 and W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals are shown in Fig. S5.† Because PDMS possesses superior optical transparency, there is no obvious difference between W18O49 and W18O49@PDMS, which indicates that PDMS almost has an ignorable effect on sunlight harvesting. W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals are able to highly convert solar energy to heat for water generation.

(d) Evaporation mass loss vapor vs. different thickness of W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane after 1 h one-sun irradiation. 
The photothermal ability of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane was investigated under one sun illumination using an infrared thermal imaging camera. Fig. 5b presents the temperature change of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane and PTFE blank under one sun irradiation (1 kW m−2). It is obvious that the temperature of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane reached 42 °C from ambient temperature while the temperature of the PTFE blank only reached 25 °C. The inset in Fig. 5b shows infrared photos of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane and PDMS modified PTFE membrane under one sun irradiation for 1600 s. The results prove that the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane can promote interfacial water heating. The water steam generation efficiency of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane was investigated under simulated solar illumination with a power density 1 kW m−2. To optimize the thickness impact of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal layer on evaporation performance, W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membranes with different thicknesses were prepared by filtrating varying volumes of W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal solution. Thicknesses were characterized by deposited mass per unit area, M/A. Fig. 5c shows the evaporated water mass loss as a function of irradiation time with varying W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane thickness. The results suggest that the water evaporation speed improved with increasing W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal thickness (M/A increasing from 0 to 9.83 g m−2). The evaporated water mass loss in the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane achieved 1.13 kg m−2 for M/A = 9.83 g m−2after 1 h irradiation, which is much higher than the PTFE membrane (0.46 kg m−2), thus exhibiting superior evaporation performance by rationally designing an interfacial evaporation device. As shown in Fig. 5d, the limit of water evaporation rate for the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane was further calculated to be 1.15 kg m−2 after 1 h one-sun irradiation, and the limit of energy conversion efficiency was 82.0%. As shown in Fig. S5,† the stability and reusability of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal solar steam generation device were further researched for multiple cycles. This showed that evaporation rate stayed stable even over 10 cycles. The results show the high stability and reutilization of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal solar steam generation device in the atmosphere. As depicted in Fig. S6,† the energy conversion efficiency was calculated to be 80.7% for the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane which achieved a high efficiency versus without the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal (which only achieved 33.1%), and both under one sun irradiation. W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal solar steam generation device with smart design can enhance evaporation performance under one sun. As shown in Table 1, the energy conversion efficiency reached 82% under only one sun, superior to most of the previous reports without the assistance of capillarity of hydrophilic layer. Hydrophilic PTFE membrane played an important role in solar steam generation and was selected as a substrate for filtration. The W18O49@PDMS mesocrystals were retained and stacked to form a stacked W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane on a PTFE membrane. A W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal solar steam generation device with smart design can enhance evaporation performance under one sun.

To assess the desalination performance of the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane in real water, steam generation efficiency and desalination capability were investigated, as shown in Fig. 6. Saline water with four ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) was used for simulated seawater.10,52 The energy conversion efficiency of seawater with the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane (M/A = 9.83 g m−2) was up to 80.0% under one sun illumination, suggesting that the salt ions have little influence on the steam generation of a W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane. As shown in Fig. 6b, the salinities of the simulated seawater were reduced to levels far below the World Health Organization's (WHO) standard after desalination under one sun. It is clear that desalination was successfully realized by the designed W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a solar steam generation device based on W18O49 mesocrystal loading on a PTFE membrane was fabricated. The W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal exhibited a broad absorption band of 550–2500 nm and converted sunlight to heat effectively. PDMS acted as a hydrophobic modification and had negligible influence on the crystal structure and light absorption of the W18O49 mesocrystal and hydrophilicity of PTFE membrane. The W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane with its hydrophobic top and hydrophilic bottom possesses the properties of self-floating and water transportation simultaneously for efficient solar-driven evaporation. The evaporated water mass loss achieved 1.13 kg m−2 for M/A = 9.83 g m−2 after 1 h irradiation under one sun illumination. The device possesses efficient evaporation performance (80.7%) versus a control sample with only 33.1%. Limit of water evaporation rate for the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane was further calculated to be 1.15 kg m−2 after 1 h one-sun irradiation, with an efficiency as high as 82.0%. The energy conversion efficiency with simulated seawater was up to 80.0% under one sun. It also is shown that desalinated water using the W18O49@PDMS mesocrystal membrane meets drinking-water standards. It is believed that low-cost materials combined with a reasonable design would be promising to apply to desalination, water treatment, and other applications.
