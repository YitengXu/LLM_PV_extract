, Accepted 5th February 2014First published on 28th March 2014AbstractOne-electron fast redox mediators like cobalt complexes are a new important class of mediator system in dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) that have some special features such as fast regeneration reactions, low absorption in the visible light range without the occurrence of destructive reactions with the materials of the DSCs. In this research, for the first time, a new Schiff base cobalt complex has been synthesized and used as an efficient redox mediator system in dye sensitized solar cells which are fabricated using D35 organic dye as a sensitizer and mesoporous nanostructured titania as a photoanode. J–V measurements of the prepared DSC were carried out under AM1.5G irradiation and photoelectrochemical parameters like the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), voltage decay and the overall efficiency were measured and compared to the conventional symmetric cobalt polypyridine complexes. The J–V curve results show enhancement of the open-circuit voltage in the DSC with the new Schiff base cobalt complex mediator compared with classic polypyridine cobalt complexes. Comparison between the dark currents of the investigated cells provides qualitative information about the electron recombination process. Lower dark currents were observed in DSCs with a titania blocking layer. Voltage decay measurements, the calculated electron lifetime and the effective recombination order (β) show lower average β values for the DSC with the Schiff base cobalt complex as a redox mediator.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are a promising alternative to conventional inorganic semiconductor-based solar cells because of their favorable environmental and inexpensive features.1–3 In typical DSCs, a mesoporous film of titania nanocrystals is sensitized with organic or metal organic dyes which in most applications are surrounded by a redox mediator in an organic solvent, typically acetonitrile.4–6
The classic redox mediator in DSCs is the I3−/I− redox couple, which in conjunction with Ru(II) dyes delivers certified efficiencies of 11.4%.7
In a DSC, hole (h+) transport is accomplished by the use of a solution phase redox mediator which permeates the pores of the titania and serves to electrically connect the anode and cathode. Electron/hole recombination is minimized by the use of a redox mediator which displays selective heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics, such that reduction of the oxidized mediator occurs rapidly only at the cathode.
Fully organic dyes can also perform with I3−/I− electrolytes, with efficiencies of about 10%.8 The I3−/I− redox couple, however, is also known to have disadvantages due to its complex redox chemistry and its corrosive nature, which complicates large-scale DSC production.9–11 Due to an excessive loss of voltage during the dye-regeneration reaction, the use of the iodide/triiodide electrolyte as a redox shuttle limits the attainable open-circuit potential, Voc, from 0.7 to 0.8 V and is thus a drawback of current DSC devices.12
Another drawback of relying on I3−/I− is the complicated, potentially multielectron, kinetics of the I3−/I− redox processes, which hinders the understanding of several key steps in the operation of DSCs.13,14 Additionally, strict reliance on I3−/I− prevents molecular control of the redox shuttle, thwarting systematic studies on the electrolyte. In general, however, one-electron, outer-sphere redox reagents such as ferrocenes have not proved to be useful mediators in DSCs.15–17 In a particularly interesting report, DSCs using easy-to-prepare cobalt(III/II) tris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridyl), [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+, as a redox shuttle exhibited excellent efficiencies, with incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCEs) ∼80% of that of a comparable cell employing I3−/I−.18 Surprisingly, similar redox couples such as cobalt(III/II) tris(4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridyl), [Co(Me2bpy)3]3+/2+, exhibited relatively poor performance.18
Several promising results have been obtained using Co(II)/Co(III) redox mediators with organic dyes and different semiconductor systems as the photoanode.19–21 A Zn(II)–porphyrin/organic dye cocktail in conjunction with [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ provided the new record efficiency for liquid-based DSCs of ∼12.3% under AM1.5 irradiation.22
Hetero atoms such N, O, S and in some cases Se and P are capable of forming coordinate-covalent bonds with metals owing to their free electron pairs.23 Compounds with π-bonds also generally exhibit good inhibitive properties due to the interaction of the π-orbital with the metal surface.24 Schiff base compounds with a –CHN– linkage (azomethine) have both the above features combined with their structure which make them effective potential corrosion inhibitors.25,26 Due to their good linkage properties and higher electrochemical potentials, Schiff base metal complexes could be used as an electron transfer redox mediator in electrochemical systems.
Yang et al., have reported the first electrolytes containing Schiff base cations in DSCs.27 In their study a Schiff base iodide complex (N,N′-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine zinc(II) iodide) was synthesized and applied as a DSC electrolyte. This Schiff base metal complex has showed high reductive activity and conductivity, resulting in a larger IPCE and photoelectric conversion efficiency in the DSCs. The Schiff base zinc complexes adsorb on the titania surface and generate an increase in the electrical potential in the Helmholtz layer but in this electrolyte system I−/I3− still acts as a mediator system for the regeneration of the oxidized dye.
In this research, we synthesized a new cobalt complex (Scheme 1a and Fig. 1) with two tridentate Schiff base ligands, and investigated its application as a redox mediator for dye-sensitized solar cells. For comparison, two DSCs with a cobalt–tris–bipyridine (Scheme 1c) redox couple (prevalent cobalt redox system) and a cobalt–salen redox mediator (Scheme 1b) in acetonitrile solution were also fabricated. All of the DSCs have been fabricated using just one screen-printed layer of mesoporous titania (about 4 μm thickness) and a thin layer of spin-coated platinum as the working and counter electrodes, respectively. For the first time we used a Schiff base based cobalt complex as a redox mediator system in a DSC. The current density–voltage, electron lifetime and electron recombination properties of the DSC with the Schiff base cobalt complex (SBCC) as a redox mediator and organic triaryl amine dye (D35) as a sensitizer, are reported and compared with the DSC containing the prevalent Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl)-based redox electrolyte (redox mediator system which has been used in the recently published efficiency record22). The exciting finding to emerge from this study is the improved open-circuit voltage of DSCs constructed with the Schiff base cobalt complex in comparison to the Voc obtained when using the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ complex as a redox mediator.

2. Experimental details
2.1 Synthesis and characterization of the cobalt complexes
The cobalt complexes [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2 and [Co(6-methoxy-salen)] were synthesized as described elsewhere.18,28
The Schiff base cobalt complex (SBCC) was synthesized by reacting the precursor compound N-(2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethyl)-5-methoxysalicylideneimine (L) with CoCl2·6H2O. The precursor compound L was synthesized by reacting equimolar salicylaldehyde (1 mmol, 152 mg) and 2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethanol (1.5 mmol, 158 mg) in anhydrous ethanol (5 ml). CoCl2·6H2O (1 mmol, 238 mg) in anhydrous ethanol (5 ml) was added to the previous solution. After leaving the solution in air to evaporate about half of the solvent, dark red prisms of the complex compound were formed. The crystals were isolated, washed with ethanol three times and dried in a vacuum desiccator using silica gel (yield 35% on the basis of cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate used). Elemental analysis: found: C, 50.70; H, 6.02; N, 9.81%; calc. for C24H34ClCoN4O6: C, 50.67; H, 5.98; N, 9.85%. All of the chemicals chosen for our study were of analytical grade and double distilled water was used throughout the experiment.
A dark red crystal of the SBCC was mounted on a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer, and used for data collection. The ω-2θ scan mode was employed for the entire data collection. Two standard reflections were monitored every 126 reflections to check for crystal deterioration, if any, during beam exposure to the sample. The unit cell parameters were determined using SMART29 and refined based on the positions of all strong reflections using SAINT.29 Absorption correction was done by SADABS30 based on symmetry-equivalent and repeated reflections.
The structure was solved by direct methods using SIR97 (ref. 31) and refined by full matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXTL.32
2.2 Cyclic voltammetry measurement and electro-oxidation of cobalt(II) complexes
Cyclic voltammetry measurements of complex solutions in acetonitrile were performed by using platinum, Ag/AgCl and glassy carbon as the counter, reference and working electrodes respectively (the voltage scan rate was 50 mV s−1 and the concentrations of the complex solutions were 3 mM). Also, tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was used as a supporting electrolyte.
Oxidation of the cobalt(II) complexes was performed by potentiostatic amperometry of an acetonitrile solution of the complex at the constant potential of the Co(II) to Co(III) oxidation reaction (1.0 V) and then by removing the acetonitrile solution by rotary evaporation. The complexes were then redissolved in acetonitrile, and a large amount of NH4PF6 was added to the solution. The final products were precipitated with diethyl ether, filtered, dried under vacuum, and used without further purification.
2.3 Dye sensitized solar cell fabrication and characterization
A mesoporous titania working electrode with a thin titania blocking layer was fabricated. The titania sol was prepared using a previously reported procedure.33,34 For preparation of the working electrode, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (Pilkington, TEC15) were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath overnight using (in the following order) detergent, water, and ethanol. The conducting glass substrates were coated using a dipping–withdrawing method (withdrawing speed: 0.1 mm s−1) (one layer) with titanium sol and preheated at 105 °C for 10 min. Mesoporous TiO2 films were prepared with an area of 0.25 cm2 by screen printing colloidal TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 30 NRD-T) and sintering. The temperature gradient program had four levels at 180 (10 min), 320 (10 min), 390 (10 min), and 500 °C (60 min). After sintering, when the temperature had cooled to about 90 °C, the electrode was immersed in a dye bath containing 0.2 mM D35 in ethanol and heated at 50 °C for 1 h. Then the film was rinsed in ethanol to remove excess dye. Solar cells were assembled, using a 30 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame, with a platinized counter electrode (TEC8), which was prepared by spin-coating 10 μL cm−2, 4.8 mM H2PtCl6 solution in ethanol onto the glass substrate followed by heating in air at 400 °C for 30 min. An electrolyte solution consisting of 0.22 M [SBCC], 0.033 M [SBCC](PF6), 0.1 M LiClO4, and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile was then introduced through two holes predrilled in the counter electrode, and the cell was sealed with thermoplastic Surlyn covers and a glass coverslip.
Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using an Autolab potentiostat and a home-made solar simulator emitting light with AM1.5G spectral distribution, which was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) to an intensity of 1000 W m−2. A black mask with an aperture slightly larger (0.6 × 0.6 cm2) than the active area of the solar cell (0.5 × 0.5 cm2) was applied on top of the cell to avoid significant additional contribution from light falling on the device outside the active area.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure of the Schiff base cobalt(III) complex
The crystal structure of the Schiff base cobalt complex (SBCC) consists of a [CoL2]+ cation and a chloride anion, in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1). The cobalt(III) atom in the cation is in a distorted octahedral geometry, being coordinated with four nitrogen and two phenoxo oxygen atoms from two chelate Schiff base ligands. The average Co(III)–N(imine) bond length of 1.904(3) Å is slightly shorter than the mean Co(III)–N(amine) distance (2.017(3) Å), however, all of the Co–N bond contacts are in a normal range when comparing to those in similar compounds. Four atoms, O(1), O(4), N(3) and N(4) constitute the equatorial plane of the Co octahedron with a mean deviation of 0.071 Å. The three diagonal angles of the Co polyhedron are 178.22(1)°, 178.71(1)° and 178.80(12)° which indicate a slightly distorted octahedron around the cobalt. This may arise from a large crystal field stabilization energy, which is due to the low-spin d6 electron configuration of the Co(III) centre.
3.2 Cyclic voltammograms of cobalt complexes
By using the cyclic voltammetry technique, the electrochemical behavior of the cobalt(II) complex was investigated in acetonitrile solution. Platinum, Ag/AgCl and glassy carbon were used as the counter, reference and working electrodes respectively (the voltage scan rate was 50 mV s−1 and the concentrations of the complex solutions were 3 mM). Fig. 2 shows cyclic voltammograms of the SBCC, [Co(6-methoxy-salen)] and [Co(bpy)3]2+ in acetonitrile. At the anodic half-cycle, the oxidation reaction of cobalt occurs on the working electrode. Oxidation potentials of this electrochemical reaction are +0.40 V, +0.40 V and +1.0 V for cobalt–tris–bipyridine, cobalt–salen and the SBCC, respectively. At the cathodic half-cycle, the potentials of the reduction reaction of the cobalt center are +0.27 V and +0.90 V for cobalt polypyridine and the SBCC, respectively and there is no reduction potential peak for the cobalt–salen complex. This may be attributed to the flat structure of the cobalt–salen complex. The redox potential of the SBCC in acetonitrile is more positive than cobalt–tris–bipyridine. The more positive redox potential is a good advantage of the SBCC for its use in DSC electrolytes and this can lead to an enhancement of the Voc.

3.3 Photovoltaic results
Due to the non-reversible reaction of the cobalt–salen complex, the DSC which was prepared with this mediator system didn't show any photo-voltage or photo-current. Fig. 3 shows the photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSC with D35 dye in conjunction with the SBCC-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolytes under 1 sun simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) and dark conditions (curves with negative values of current density). The power conversion efficiency (η) was derived from the equation η = JscVocFF/I0, where JSC is the short circuit current density, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor, and I0 is the photon flux illuminating the solar cells. The DSC parameters are calculated and listed in Table 1. Using the SBCC electrolyte system, the Voc is improved by about 0.1 V in comparison with the classic cobalt polypyridine complex but the JSC, FF and overall efficiency are still below those of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple. This may be attributed to the lower electron transfer rate at the platinum counter electrode and the lower symmetry in these kinds of complexes compared to the prevalent cobalt polypyridine complexes with D3 symmetry.

A comparison of dark currents for the investigated cells provides qualitative information about the electron recombination process.35 In DSCs, preventing the recapture of photoinjected electrons by redox species is vital to obtain a high open circuit photovoltage. By inserting the blocking layer between the FTO substrate and the TiO2 mesoporous layer, the reaction possibilities of the Co(II)-complex species with the photoinjected electrons on the FTO substrate are significantly hindered, as demonstrated by the reduced dark current.35 Here, the dark current voltage curves of the DSCs using a titania blocking layer are presented in Fig. 3. The low dark current results may be attributed to the better electrical contact between the blocking layer and the FTO substrate, and the compact nature of the titania blocking layer as well.
Three-dimensional J–V measurement plots of the DSCs with the SBCC and classic cobalt–tris–bipyridine redox mediators under AM1.5G are shown in Fig. 4. A lower fill factor and JSC are the reasons for the lower overall efficiency of the SBCC-DSC compared with the prevalent cobalt polypyridine systems.

The voltage, V, is the difference between the Nernstian potential of the solution, E(R+/R), and the quasi-Fermi level, EF/q, (i.e. potential of the semiconductor) at the contacting electrode. At open circuit, the photocurrent density is exactly offset by recombination, Urec, such that Jsc − qUrec = 0. Recombination is generally used to refer to electron transfer from the semiconductor to the oxidized dye and the oxidized form of the redox shuttle. A familiar expression for the open circuit photovoltage is then given by:36 
(1)where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, n0 is the electron concentration in the conduction band in the dark, τ0 is electron lifetime and ζ is the electron concentration in the semiconductor surface. The Voc will thus increase with increasing photocurrent density and increasing lifetime (decreasing recombination). The largest increase in Voc can be realized by making the solution potential more positive, which is reflected in a decreasing n0. The open circuit photovoltage is thus highly sensitive to the properties of the redox couple, via Jsc, τ0 and n0.
The maximum fill factor is strictly a function of the diode quality factor, γ, and the Voc.36 There are numerous processes which can cause the apparent diode quality factor to exceed the ideal value of 1, including surface state mediated recombination. Direct electron transfer from the photoanode substrate to the electrolyte (shunting) can also impact the fill factor, especially in cases where outersphere redox shuttles are used; however this can be overcome through the use of a blocking layer.37,38 The actual fill factor is also attenuated by any uncompensated series resistance, Rs, in the cell. Including γ and Rs, the J–V characteristics can be described in terms of the diode equation written as: 
(2)
The mass-transport resistance can be significant for outersphere redox couples, however, which can decrease the fill factor and thus the efficiency. In addition, while platinum acts as a good catalyst for the reduction of I3− at the counter electrode, thereby minimizing the charge transfer resistance, it does not necessarily apply to all redox shuttles.39 For non-optimized counter electrodes, the charge transfer resistance can likewise diminish the fill factor.
On structural comparison between [Co(bpy)3]3+ and SBCC+ (oxidized moieties of the redox mediator systems), it was found that SBCC+ has a lower symmetry and that the two free hydroxyl groups on the ligands can increase the charge transfer resistance between the complex and the platinum surface at the counter electrode, which led to the decrease in the fill factor and overall efficiency of the cell. The hydroxyl groups can increase the negative charge distribution on the complex and create a resistance between the cobalt center and platinum surface by a charge repulsion phenomenon. On the other hand, free hydroxyl groups can adsorb on the uncoated titania surface by the formation of hydrogen bonding to oxygen atoms or coordinate bonding with titanium atoms. This could decrease the efficiency of the cell by increasing the recombination reactions between the uncoated titania surface and the redox mediator.
By using the voltage decay technique we can gain a deeper understanding of the dye regeneration and recombination process in DSCs. Voltage decay curves of DSCs with the SBCC and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ are shown in Fig. 5a. The voltage decay is approximately the same for both DSCs. Transients (V(t)), electron lifetimes in the DSCs are calculated and are shown in Fig. 5b. The abscission in Fig. 5b shows that the DSC with the classic cobalt redox system has an improved τe from 600 to 1100 ms in the voltage range of 0.25 to 0.20 V. The effective recombination order (β) is calculated using a model, including trapping effects (Fig. 5c). The range of the effective voltages in the DSCs are different and β values appear at higher voltages for the DSC with the SBCC. The β values increase from 0.83 to 1.82, with decreasing voltage. The average β value of the DSC with the SBCC redox mediator is smaller than the DSC with the cobalt–tris–bipyridine redox mediator. These results show that the Schiff base cobalt complex has slower recombination with the surface of uncovered titania (especially for higher voltages of the cell).

Finally, we can introduce a new efficient type of cobalt-base redox mediator system which has good potential to significantly improve the open-circuit voltage of DSCs. This kind of Schiff base cobalt complex with two three-dentate ligands could be easily synthesized and dissolved in different solvent media. Due to the chelating effect it has good chemical and physical stability under the operation conditions. To overcome the loss of fill-factor at the counter electrode we can use gold and graphite materials in the electrode and/or substitution of the hydroxyl groups by aryl groups in the Schiff base ligand.
4. Conclusions
We have reported a new application of Schiff base cobalt complexes as a redox mediator system in dye sensitized solar cells. Due to high redox potentials these kinds of complexes have great potential to increase the voltage of the solar cells. A new Schiff base cobalt complex structure was synthesized and characterized using the X-ray single crystal method. The fabricated DSC with this kind of complex as the redox mediator showed an enhancement of the Voc. Calculated average values of the effective recombination order (β) show a good decrease in recombination reactions in DSCs.
