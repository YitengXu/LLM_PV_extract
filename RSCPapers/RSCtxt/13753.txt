    , Accepted 14th April 2023First published on 14th April 2023AbstractTop cells based on mixed iodide–bromide lead perovskites (Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6) for multijunction solar cells (MJ SCs) were fabricated and characterized. Various lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) concentrations (0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%) were added into perovskite precursor solution to fabricate high quality Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films. The bandgap energy of Pb(SCN)2-added Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films was 1.87 eV determined from Tauc plots. The average grain size of the 2% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin film was 2.27 μm, more than 16 times larger than that of the perovskite thin film without Pb(SCN)2 (0.134 μm). The intensity of the two main peaks (14.38° and 28.97°) was intensified with Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films. The photoluminescence (PL) revealed higher intensity of perovskite thin films with Pb(SCN)2 due to a decrease in nonradiative recombination. The carrier lifetimes of Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films sharply increased with the presence of Pb(SCN)2, from 25.92 ns at 0% Pb(SCN)2 to 224.27 ns at 2% Pb(SCN)2. The thickness of a Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6-based absorber layer cell is 400 nm which is thin enough to obtain both high transparency and large current density. As a result, the addition of 2% of Pb(SCN)2 to the precursor of Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 perovskite solar cells resulted in a notable improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE), increasing from 9.37% to 13.66%. This improvement was accompanied by a significant increase in both open-circuit voltage (Voc), which reached 1.27 V, and current density (Jsc,JV), which reached 14.19 mA cm−2.
Introduction
Solar cells are used to convert solar energy to electric energy without any negative effect on the environment and climate.1,2 MJ SCs with multi-bandgap energies have been designed to overcome limitations of single-junction solar cells, including thermalization and transmission losses of photons with energy larger and smaller than that of the bandgap of an active layer, respectively.3–5 Currently, MJ SCs with two and four terminal configurations are commonly used.6–10 Monolithic MJ SCs with two terminals are more popular than those with four terminals because of their low cost, simplicity, and robustness. Triple- and four-junction solar cells with ultra-high PCE have been reported as well.11–13 However, to obtain maximum PCE, the subcells in MJ SCs must satisfy the current matching conditions. Therefore, the top cells in these MJ SCs usually have bandgaps larger than 1.85 eV. Such wide-bandgap cells can be fabricated using III–V compound semiconductors or lead halide perovskites, and among the known solar cell materials, III–V compound semiconductor-based SCs reportedly exhibit the highest PCE with 29.1% for GaAs single-junction solar cells14 and more than 40% for MJ SCs.13,15 Nevertheless, these III–V compound semiconductors are high-cost, and the corresponding thin film growth and device fabrication processes require lattice-matching with the host substrate, a complex buffer design to reduce dislocations between the thin film and its mother substrate, or wafer bonding and epitaxial lift-off.12,13,15–17 Thus, III–V solar cells are usually used in space applications rather than in individual markets.17,18
The chemical formula of an organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite can be expressed as APbX3, where A is a monovalent cation like FA+ ((NH2)2CH+), MA+ (CH3NH3+), or Cs+;19 and X is a monovalent anion such as chlorine (Cl−), bromine (Br−), or iodine (I−). The bandgap energy of the perovskite can be tuned by changing the A or X site composition. Therefore, perovskites exhibit several advantages over III–V semiconductors including low manufacturing cost, simple material and device fabrication processes, easily tunable bandgap energies, and the ability to combine with other materials (perovskites, III–V semiconductors, silicon, and copper–indium–gallium selenide) to form thin films to produce MJ SCs. Although mixed iodide–bromide lead perovskites are widely used to fabricate wide-bandgap solar cells, most researchers are now focusing on wide-bandgap solar cells with bandgap energies smaller than 1.85 eV to develop tandem cells.8,10,20–22
In this study, we fabricated wide-bandgap solar cells with bandgap energies greater than 1.85 eV using mixed I–Br lead perovskites (Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6). We used FA-based perovskites as absorbers in solar cell devices because their thermal stability and PCE are better than those of MA-based perovskites. Since ionic FA is large, a small amount of cesium was added into perovskite structures to stabilize the perovskite phase. Perovskite thin films with large grain size, smooth surface and free pinholes are key characteristics to achieve high device performance. However, mixed I–Br perovskites with Br-rich content easily induce phase segregation, leading to the formation of an undesired bandgap as well as other compounds in the crystal structure.23,24 Furthermore, with the presence of high-bromine content, crystallization is more rapid and difficult to control because the ionic radius of bromide (1.96 Å) is smaller than the ionic radius of iodide (2.20 Å).25 Uncontrollable and quick crystallization cause small grain sizes, surface roughness, and pinholes.26 Small-sized grains and pinholes increase the number of grain boundaries (GBs) and defects as well as the trap state density, which collectively increase the number of non-radiative recombination events, reduce the Voc, and degrade the device performance. Some methods have been reported to solve these issues, such as additive incorporation, anti-solvent treatment, Lewis acid–base adduct, and vapor-assisted deposition.27–33 Pb(SCN)2 is a popular additive and has been reportedly used in MA-based solar cells to control crystal nucleation, passivate GBs, and enhance the long-term stability of the device.34–37 In this study, to fabricate high-quality Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films, we added Pb(SCN)2 into perovskite precursor solutions and investigated the influence of the concentration of Pb(SCN)2 on the device performance ofCs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6-based solar cells. According to the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorbance spectra, the bandgap energy of the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films was ∼1.87 eV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed that the grain size of the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films (>1 μm) was more than 7 times larger than that of the film without Pb(SCN)2 (∼0.13 μm). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra show that the average carrier lifetime of the 2% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin film (224.27 ns) was more than 10 times longer than that of the perovskite thin film without Pb(SCN)2 (25.92 ns). The perovskite solar cell exhibited a PCE of 9.37% without the addition of Pb(SCN)2, which significantly improved to 13.66% upon the inclusion of 2% Pb(SCN)2.

Cesium iodide (CsI, 99.999%), lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2, 99.5%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 98%), bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt solution (Li-TFSI, 99.95%), chlorobenzene (>98%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, >99.8%), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, >99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N2, N2′, N7, N7′-tetbrakis-(2, 4-dimethoxyphenyl)-9,9′ spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased from Lumtec.
Device fabrication
Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned using Hellmanex solution, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 15 min (in each solvent). To improve the hydrophilicity, the ITO substrates were treated under UV-ozone for 30 min before SnO2 spin-coating. The SnO2 NPs (15 wt% dispersed in H2O) were diluted in deionized water with a ratio of 1:4 by volume and subsequently spin-coated on the cleaned ITO/glass substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The SnO2 coated substrates were then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. Subsequently, these substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min before the deposition of the perovskite precursor solution. The 1 M perovskite precursor solutions were prepared in a glove box by dissolving 0.1 mmol of CsI, (0.9 + 2x) mmol of FAI, 0.2 mmol of PbI2, and 0.8 mmol of PbBr2 in a 1 mL mixed solvent prepared by mixing 0.8 mL of DMF and 0.2 mL of DMSO. The 2x mmol excess of FAI was used to compensate for the lack of FA+ ions in perovskite thin films during the annealing process, according to the chemical reaction (eqn (1)). The x mol Pb(SCN)2 additive with x = 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% to PbX2 (X = Cl and Br) was added into the perovskite precursor solutions and then stirred overnight at 60 °C. Then, the perovskite precursor solutions were filtered by using 0.2 μm PTFE membranes and were transferred to ambient air (humidity < 25% and temperature < 25 °C) to fabricate perovskite thin films and a hole transporting layer. The filtered perovskite precursor solutions were then (two-step) spin-coated on the SnO2/ITO/glass substrates at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s. Chlorobenzene (antisolvent, 500 μL) was dropped on the perovskite films after 27 s of spin-coating, and the films were subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 30 min to eliminate organic solvents. Next, a solution of 80 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28 μL of tBP, and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI (500 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene was spin-coated on the perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 30 s to form the hole transporting layer. After this, the perovskite samples were placed in a dark desiccator for 1 h to enhance the doping effect. Finally, 150 nm-thick Au electrodes were thermally evaporated on the perovskite thin films using a shadow mask.
Perovskite thin film characterization
We used a UV-vis spectrometer (Lambda 750, PerkinElmer) to investigate the light absorption properties of the perovskite thin films. The PL spectra of the perovskite thin films were measured by using a fluorescence steady state and time spectrometer FuoTime 300 (PicoQuant) at 405 nm continuous-wave excitation on the front of the perovskite samples. The wavelength of the TRPL measurement relates to the position of the PL peak in each sample. The grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns were measured by using a X-ray scattering spectrometer (XEUSS2.0, Xenocs) with a wavelength of 1.54 Å, an incidence angle of 0.2°, and an exposure time of 300 s. 2D GIWAXS was recorded by using a DECTRIS hybrid pixel photon counting detector. The crystal structure of the perovskite thin films was investigated using a New D8 Advance (High Temp. XRD, manufacturer: Bruker) diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154181 nm). The morphology of the perovskite thin films was analyzed by SEM (Hitachi, SU8220, Korea Basic Science Institute) at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV and applied current of 10 mA. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) were conducted in ambient air using a commercial atomic force microscope (n-Tracer, NanoFocus Inc.) to evaluate the electrical properties of the perovskite thin films. The measurements were carried by using a Pt/Ir-coated Si cantilever. The topography and surface potential images were recorded in the non-contact mode (KPFM) by applying an AC voltage of 1.0 V and 70 kHz.
Solar cell device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under AM 1.5G and 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) conditions using a solar simulator (Newport Technologies, Oriel Sol3A, 455 W Xe lamp) and a reference Si solar cell (ORIEL SRC-1000-TC-QZ-N). The active area of the perovskite solar cell is 0.049 cm2 defined by using a shadow mask. J–V curves were measured from −0.01 to 1.3 V for forward scan and 1.3 to −0.01 V for reverse scan at a scan rate of 29 mV s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured from 300 nm to 800 nm with a step wavelength of 10 nm using a McScience system, which included a light source (Lamp Power LP-Xe300W), monochromator, Thorlabs optical chopper, Metro K102 photovoltaic signal amplifier, and reference Si photodetector. All the measurements were carried out at room temperature in ambient air.
Results and discussion
SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out to examine the surface morphology, coverage, thickness, and crystal structures of the perovskite thin films and solar cell devices. For the cross-sectional SEM measurements, we fabricated solar cell devices using Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 as the absorber layer on ITO/glass (details in the Experimental Section). For the top-view SEM and XRD measurements, the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 precursor solutions were deposited on ITO/glass (to reduce the charging effect) and glass, respectively. The cross-sectional SEM images of the solar cells prepared using Pb(SCN)2-added Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films are shown in Fig. 1(a–e). All the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 absorber layers have a similar thickness of 400 nm, which indicates that the perovskite thin film thickness is independent of the additive concentration. The absorber thickness of the top cells in the MJ SCs affects the light absorption properties of the underlying cells. Top cells with thick thicknesses reduce the fraction of light transmitted to the underlying cells, resulting in a decrease in the photocurrent. However, the photocurrent generated by the thin top cells is reduced, which also decreases the output current. With a thickness of 400 nm, the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 absorber layer is sufficiently transparent for the underlying cells and generates a large amount of photocurrent. The grain sizes of the perovskite thin films with different Pb(SCN)2 concentrations in the cross-sectional SEM images are similar to those in the top-view SEM images characterized by small grain size without Pb(SCN)2 and enhanced grain size with the presence of Pb(SCN)2. Single- and multi-layer grains are observed in the active layer with and without Pb(SCN)2, respectively. Single-layer grain reduces the GBs, which minimizes nonradiative recombination. Specifically, voids or pinholes are observed in the perovskite layer without Pb(SCN)2, whereas such defects are absent in the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films. Pinholes are undesirable structures in perovskite thin films and cause a low shunt resistance and low photocurrent, which reduce the open-circuit voltage and device performance. This result confirms that Pb(SCN)2 enhances the crystallization of the perovskite thin films and improves the quality of the thin films. In addition, the GBs in the lead-thiocyanate-added perovskite thin films are aligned vertically, whereas those in the films without Pb(SCN)2 are misaligned. Vertical GBs assist in the transportation and extraction of carriers from the absorber layer to the electrodes and thus suppress carrier recombination, leading to an increase in the Jsc,JV, fill factor (FF) and device performance.

The top-view SEM images of the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films with various Pb(SCN)2 concentrations (0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%) are indicated in Fig. 1(f–j). Evidently, the surfaces of the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films are flat, fully covered, and pinhole-free, which are conducive to achieving a high device performance. Without Pb(SCN)2, the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin film exhibits small grain sizes (average size is around 0.134 μm) and low crystallinity. However, the grain size and crystallinity increase significantly with the presence of Pb(SCN)2. In particular, the average grain sizes are 1.05, 2.27, 1.61 and 1.63 μm at 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% Pb(SCN)2, respectively, and some super-large grains, with a size of 4 μm, are also observed. A grain boundary (GB) is the interface between two grains, where the structure is disordered and distorted so the GB contains numerous defects/traps. These defects/traps act as nonradiative recombination centers, and thus, reducing the number of GBs by increasing the grain size in the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films limits the carrier loss via nonradiative recombination; consequently, the photocurrent is enhanced. Notably, several randomly located bright particles appear on the top of the perovskite thin films, and the number of these bright particles increases with increasing the Pb(SCN)2 concentration. These bright particles might be PbX2 which are formed as indicated in eqn (1).
A Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 crystallite is formed by the reaction of PbI2 and PbBr2 with FAI and CsI. Reportedly, SCN− ions are more tendentious to bonding with MA+ ions than I− because the electronegativity of SCN is larger than the electronegativity of I.38 Therefore, in this study, when we add Pb(SCN)2 into perovskite precursor solution, Pb(SCN)2 reacts with FAI before PbI2 reacts with FAI. The chemical reaction between Pb(SCN)2 and FAI is similar to that in a previous report,39 as shown in the following equations: 2(NH2)2CHI + Pb(SCN)2 → PbI2 + 2(NH2)2CHSCN(1) (NH2)2CHSCN → (NH2)2C↑ + HSCN↑ (annealing)(2)
The intermediate (NH2)2CHSCN was formed. However, this compound is unstable and it is easily decomposed into formamidine ((NH2)2C) and HSCN gas by the annealing process (in eqn (2)). ((NH2)2C) and HSCN vaporized rapidly and Pb2+ (in the form of PbI2) remained in the final perovskite thin film. The ((NH2)2C) gas might contribute to an increase in the grain size and improvement of quality of perovskite thin films by recrystallizing the perovskite structure. The gas caused quick nucleation and crystal growth resulting in a smooth and compact thin film, similar to the role of the methylamine (CH3NH2) gas in MA-based perovskite films.40,41
To explain further the role of Pb(SCN)2 in nucleation and crystal growth, we schematize the grain formation process from perovskite nucleation seeds to a perovskite thin film device (Fig. 2). The perovskite crystallization can be explained by Gibbs free energy analysis. Fig. S1† shows a schematic diagram of perovskite nucleation and growth mechanisms according to Pb(SCN)2 through variation of the critical size (r*) and corresponding critical Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG*). The ΔG* is an energy barrier that a nucleation process must overcome and r* represents the minimum size of a stable spherical nucleus in a supersaturated solution.42 The nucleation and growth rate can be controlled by Pb(SCN)2 concentrations (Fig. S1(b)†). In precursor solutions with Pb(SCN)2, the r* and ΔG* are higher than those in the solution without Pb(SCN)2 because of raised chemical heterogeneity by SCN− which acts as an inhibitor to obstruct nucleation.43 The perovskite thin films were fabricated by the anti-solvent method which forces reaching into a supersaturation state using chlorobenzene (CB) to promote fast crystallization.44 All nucleation processes occur during the antisolvent step and the grain size evolution is determined at the precursor solution step as mentioned above.44 The  and  correspond to critical nucleus sizes without and with Pb(SCN)2 in the perovskite precursor, and the respective critical free energies are denoted by  and , respectively (Fig. 2 and S1(c)†). The number of initial nuclei generated at the same time is different depending on the value of the energy size of ΔG*. In the case of , more energy is required to nucleate due to , resulting in multiple initial nucleations in . After the antisolvent process, numerous nuclei form during the nucleation stage in the case of the non-additive precursor, which has lower Gibbs free energy than additive ones and the small grains grow in an annealing step with supersaturation.

The XRD patterns of the perovskite thin films are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). Two main peaks at 14.38° and 28.97° corresponding to plane crystal diffraction of (100) and (200) were observed, matching with the existing literature45 and GIWAXS results for (100) as shown in Fig. 1. The intensity of these main peaks is intensified sharply with the Pb(SCN)2 concentration, from 1% to 2% and remains unchanged even if the Pb(SCN)2 concentration increases further up to 4%. The peak intensity illustrates crystallinity quality. The higher peak intensity reveals better crystallinity. In other words, Pb(SCN)2 assisted crystallization of the perovskite thin films. The XRD results are in good agreement with the SEM image results shown in Fig. 1. It is noted that there are two minor peaks with very low intensity at 12.7° and 25.72° in XRD patterns. These peaks are related to small amounts of PbI2 and PbBr2 existing in the perovskite crystal structure, as indicated in the top-view SEM images. These products might come from the reaction between Pb(SCN)2 and FAI as indicated in eqn (1) or incomplete conversion of PbX2 into a perovskite crystal structure. In addition, some papers reported that a small excess of PbI2 passivates the trap states, increases the grain sizes, which suppress nonradiative recombination, and increases the carrier lifetime and PCE.46 Nevertheless, a large excess of PbI2 can decrease the light absorbance of the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films, leading to a reduced photocurrent. There are no peaks revealing the remaining Pb(SCN)2 in XRD patterns, or Pb(SCN) reacted completely with FAI. The radii of the SCN− and I− ions are 2.15 and 2.20 Å, respectively, indicating that the ionic radius of SCN− is smaller than that of I−.25,47 Thus, if the SCN− ions are present in the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 crystal structure, then the main XRD peak will be shifted toward lower angles. However, no peak shifts are observed in the XRD patterns. This result indicates that SCN− ions are not present in the perovskite crystallites or all of them evaporated during the annealing process (in eqn (1)). FAPbI3 has two phases: a black perovskite phase (α-FAPbI3) and a yellow non-perovskite phase (δ-FAPbI3). Since our perovskite contains FAPbI3, we evaluated its phase transition, and the presence of δ-FAPbI3 was confirmed by the peak signals at 11.8° (110) and 16.3° (011).48 However, there are no peaks in the vicinity of these signals observed, indicating the successful fabrication of α-phase perovskite thin films.

To further analyze the degree of orientation, evolution of crystallinity, and structural changes from the aligned peak position and corresponding intensity of the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films, we measured GIWAXS. GIWAXS is a powerful tool for studying the morphology, orientation, and distribution of perovskite thin films and it is widely used to characterize thin polymer and perovskite films for photovoltaic applications.49,50 The morphologies are systemically changed by adding Pb(SCN)2 into the perovskite precursor solutions, and the GIWAXS patterns of the perovskite films with and without Pb(SCN)2 are displayed in Fig. 1(k–o). The Debye–Scherrer ring obtained from two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS provides information on certain crystallographic planes, which reveal the structural orientation of the perovskite crystals. The 2D GIWAXS Debye–Scherrer rings of perovskite thin films with 0%, 1%, and 4% Pb(SCN)2 show sphere patterns, which indicate that the nanocrystals are randomly oriented at the (100) lattice sites.51 In contrast, the 2D GIWAXS Debye–Scherrer rings of perovskite thin films with 2% and 3% Pb(SCN)2 indicate highly oriented nanocrystals at the (100) lattice sites. Specifically, among the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films, the crystal lattice of the optimized 2% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin film is highly oriented on (110) and (111). The peak density of the perovskite thin films with Pb(SCN)2 is higher than that of the thin film without Pb(SCN)2. In addition, we analyzed qz as a component of the scattering vector perpendicular to the sample surface by peak fitting using Gaussian functions to identify the peak position. Four types of peaks can be assigned to the graph shown in Fig. 1(p–t), corresponding to the fitted peak line as indicated by the PbI2-(100), α phase (100), (110), and (111) crystal planes. The PbI2-(100) peak near ∼0.9 Å−1 on the qz axis is exhibited by the 0% and 1% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films. However, the PbI2-(100) peak disappears when the Pb(SCN)2 concentration increases from 2% to 4%, which is consistent with the XRD results shown in Fig. 3(a). The intensity of the peak corresponding to the (100) plane gradually increases with an increasing Pb(SCN)2 concentration and gets a maximum value at 2% Pb(SCN)2. The disappearance of the PbI2 peak and appearance of the (111) peak indicate the complete conversion of FAPbI3 into a photoactive black phase.52
The Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 precursor solutions containing Pb(SCN)2 were spin-coated on glass to measure the UV-vis absorption, PL, and TRPL spectra to evaluate the optical properties. The UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). The absorption intensity of the Pb(SCN)2-added Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films are slightly enhanced compared to that of the perovskite thin film without Pb(SCN)2, indicating a good crystallinity and a smooth surface. These results are in good agreement with those obtained from the SEM and XRD analyses. Furthermore, these results suggest that the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films with Pb(SCN)2 generate more photocurrent, which might contribute to their higher photocurrent compared to the perovskite film without Pb(SCN)2. Based on the Tauc plots shown in Fig. 3(d), we were able to calculate the bandgap energies of the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films. The bandgap energies of all the perovskite thin films, both with and without Pb(SCN)2, were found to be in the range of 1.865–1.875 eV. These values are similar to the bandgap energies of the top cells used in the aforementioned multi-junction solar cells. Therefore, the perovskite thin films with the calculated bandgap energies could be suitable for use as top cells in MJ SCs.
The PL and TRPL spectra of the perovskite thin films are shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f). The PL peak positions of all five perovskite thin films were both located at around 666 nm (∼1.86 eV) which is in good agreement with the bandgap energies (1.865–1.875 eV) extracted from UV-vis absorption spectra. Without Pb(SCN)2, the PL intensity of perovskite thin films was small, but evidently enhanced with the presence of Pb(SCN)2 and gets a maximum value at 2% Pb(SCN)2. The recombination between electrons and holes can be radiative (band-to-band recombination) or nonradiative (trap-assisted recombination). Since PL intensity is sensitive to radiative recombination, the enhanced PL intensity of the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films indicates that nonradiative recombination was reduced or trap state density was decreased. These results are consistent with the SEM images, which show a large number of GBs in the Pb(SCN)2-free perovskite thin film owing to its small grain sizes compared to those of the other thin films.
Carrier lifetime (τ) is an important parameter that significantly influences the solar cell device performance. The τ should be long to avoid carrier recombination before they are collected by the electrodes. The TRPL spectra are fitted by using the following equation:53,54 (3)where τ1 is the fast decay component and A1 is its relative amplitude; τ2 is the slow decay component and A2 is its relative amplitude. The average carrier lifetime (τave) is calculated using the following equation:53  
The fast decay component (τ1) relates to the nonradiative recombination, caused by defects or traps. The slow decay component (τ2) exhibits radiative recombination (band to band or free carrier recombination). From Table 1, we can see that the nonradiative recombination in the perovskite thin film without Pb(SCN)2 is the largest related to low τ1 and reduces when increasing the Pb(SCN)2 concentration up to 2% (highest τ1). However, when Pb(SCN)2 further increases, the nonradiative recombination increases (τ1 is reduced). The τaver of the perovskite thin films with 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% Pb(SCN)2 is 25.92, 114.97, 224.27, 210.74, and 119.55 ns, respectively. The average carrier lifetime is longer with the presence of Pb(SCN)2, and the maximum lifetime is observed at 2% Pb(SCN)2 due to the high crystallinity and passivation at the GBs which are shown in SEM, XRD, and AFM analyses. However, the average carrier lifetime is reduced when the concentration of Pb(SCN)2 is further increased from 3% to 4%. These results demonstrate that a large amount of Pb(SCN)2 in the perovskite thin film increases the density of traps or defects in the crystal structure, resulting in an increase in the number of nonradiative recombination events and a decreased carrier lifetime. A longer carrier lifetime indicates that the nonradiative recombination is suppressed because of the enhanced crystallinity and increased grain sizes in the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films. This observation is consistent with the SEM and XRD results. A longer carrier lifetime is conducive to the carrier collection ability of the electrodes and thus improves the device performance, including the Jsc,JV and Voc.

We performed c-AFM and KPFM analyses to investigate the morphological, electrical, and physical properties of the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films deposited on ITO substrates. As seen in Fig. S2(a–e),† the average surface roughness of the perovskite thin films is 18.34 nm, 20.37 nm, 24.12 nm, 28.22 nm, and 30.59 nm for the 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% Pb(SCN)2, respectively. Due to the increased Pb(SCN)2 concentration, the grain size grows so that the roughness is increased. The electrical properties and surface states of the Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films were investigated by c-AFM measurement at the +1 V bias voltage. Fig. 4(a-1), (d-1) and S2(a-1–e-1)† indicate the local current maps for the perovskite thin film surface and the corresponding line profiles are extracted and marked with bluish arrows on the current maps shown in Fig. S2(f–j).† The representative c-AFM and KPFM results for the 0% and 2% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films are shown in Fig. 4. The current flows at the GBs and IGs shown in Fig. S2(a-1–e-1)† were analyzed by using line profiles (Fig. S2(f–j)†) marked with bluish arrows on that topography and local current map images. We can see that the current mainly flows at the IGs instead of the GBs for the 0%, 1%, 3% and 4% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films. For 2% Pb(SCN)2, the current flows at the both GBs and IGs or GBs are passivated (Fig. 4(d–f)). The average local current of the 2% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin film has the highest values calculated using histograms from local current maps (as shown in Fig. S4(c and f) and S2(k–o)†) where that of the IGs is 37.78 pA and GBs is 33.55 pA.
 Fig. 4  Comparison of 3-dimensional (3D) images with (a–f) c-AFM and (g–l) KPFM analysis for 0% and 2% Pb(SCN)2 (optimized concentration), respectively. In the c-AFM results, the line profiles (bluish-arrows) for 0% ((a)-topo and (a-1)-current map) and 2% Pb(SCN)2 ((d)-topo and (d-1)-current map) on the topography images and current maps indicate (b, c, e and f) that current flows at the intragrains (IGs) and GBs. In the KPFM results, the surface potential distributions are described with (h and k) histograms and (i and l) calculated work functions from KPFM images for 0% ((g)-topo and (g–1)-surface potential map) and 2% Pb(SCN)2 ((j)-topo and (j–1)-surface potential map). (All results of 0% to 4% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films are shown in the ESI†). 
To demonstrate the GB passivation by Pb(SCN)2 additives from the observed current flows at the GBs for 2% Pb(SCN)2 in the c-AFM results, the surface potential was measured and the carrier transport was analyzed with calculated work functions by KPFM characterization for the perovskite thin films. KPFM is a tool that enables nanometer and micrometer-scale imaging of the surface potential of a broad range of materials under an electrostatic force between the sample and the AFM tip.55,56 In Fig. 4(g) and (j) and S3(a–e),† the 3D and 2D topography map images are shown, respectively, and the transition of grain size in the perovskite thin films with various Pb(SCN)2 concentrations is confirmed identically by SEM and c-AFM topography images. The representative surface potential maps (Fig. S3†(a-1–e-1)) of the perovskite thin films with and without Pb(SCN)2 are marked by yellowish and bluish regions corresponding to the positive and negative contact potential differences (VCPD), respectively. To explore the mechanism underlying the difference between VCPD () of the IGs and GBs, the role of Pb(SCN)2 passivation was investigated by analyzing the surface potential distributions at the IGs and GBs as a carrier transportation and work function tuning by Fermi energy level change.55 Fig. S3(f–j)† show the statistical results by characterized histogram distribution of ΔVCPD between the IGs and GBs. Each histogram indicates potential values at the IGs and GBs with line profiling at a number of scanning regions. The average value of surface potential as  and  at the IGs and GBs, respectively, is calculated from the histogram results, and the surface potential difference between IGs and GBs is marked by . The  values are indicated by 20.36 mV, 87.25 mV, 158.77 mV, 108.77 mV, and 109.75 mV for 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% Pb(SCN)2, respectively. As the grain size of perovskite increases (in the 2–4% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films), the ΔVCPD between IGs and GBs exhibits higher surface potential than perovskite films with smaller grain size (in the perovskite thin films with 0% and 1% Pb(SCN)2). The higher ΔVCPD indicates that the photogenerated carriers are more effectively separated. Furthermore, the larger grain size absorbs more light energy and thus generates more carriers under light irradiation.57 The difference between the work function of the metal-coated tip and the thin film surface represents the contact potential difference (VCPD): (5)where Φ is the work function58 and e is the elementary electron charge.57 These results can be analyzed by work function distribution. The work functions of the tip and sample are calculated by using eqn (5), and the representative values are indicated on the distribution graphs in Fig. S3(k–o).† We calculated the work function of the Pt/Ir-coated tip to be 4.89 eV from the measured surface potential (VCPD,HOPG) of the reference sample, which was a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with a work function of 4.60 eV. The perovskite thin film without Pb(SCN)2 has a higher work function than a Pt–Ir coated KPFM tip so needing higher energy to transport an electron from the perovskite to the metal compares to the lower work function materials. After adding Pb(SCN)2 additives, the work function of perovskite thin films is lower than that of the perovskite thin film without Pb(SCN)2, which is related to the enhanced charge extraction from the perovskite to the electrodes leading to an increase in VOC as shown in Fig. 6.
We suggest the band bending diagram at the GBs and IGs for without (0%), optimized (2%), and over (3–4%) Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin films to analyze the charge separation ability as shown in Fig. 5. The surface potential of GBs (VP,GB) is higher than that of IGs (VP,IG) that is the suggested positive surface potential of GBs leads to upward band bending for fixed electrons at the GBs. The upward band bending repels electrons and accumulates the holes from electron barriers at the GBs.59 GBs degrade device performance of solar cells so formation of a number of GBs is the most important process on the perovskite thin films.60 The charges are easily trapped at GBs, and non-uniform electric fields are generated by these trapped charges. The perovskite thin film without Pb(SCN)2 shows an inferior performance because of the frequent and large number of electron–hole recombination events at the GBs. With Pb(SCN)2 passivation, larger grains are formed, which reduces the number of trap states at the GBs. Specifically, the 2% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin film exhibits the highest value of ΔVCPD ∼160 mV between the IGs and GBs. The higher electron barriers created by ΔVCPD prevent electron–hole recombination.55 The large ΔVCPD of ∼160 mV and ∼110 mV obtained from perovskite thin films with optimized and over-added Pb(SCN)2, respectively, facilitate a more efficient charge extraction and suppress charge recombination at the GBs and IGs compared to the perovskite thin film without Pb(SCN)2.

The J–V characteristics and corresponding parameters of the best perovskite solar cells are displayed in Fig. 6(e) and Table 2. The 0% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite solar cell exhibits the lowest device performance with a Voc of 1.210 V, Jsc,JV of 11.60 mA cm−2, FF of 66.77%, and PCE of 9.37%. As discussed earlier, the 0% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin film exhibits small-sized grains and a high rate of nonradiative recombination at the GBs leading to low Jsc,JV, Voc and FF. The increase in Voc (1.230 V), Jsc,JV (12.49 mA cm−2), FF (69.71%), and PCE (10.71%) of the 1% Pb(SCN)2-added solar cell device is related to its better crystallinity. The maximum PCE of 13.66% is obtained at 2% Pb(SCN)2 with a large Voc of 1.270 V, Jsc,JV of 14.19 mA cm−2, and FF of 76.00%. However, with a further increase in the Pb(SCN)2 concentration to 3% and 4%, the PCE drops to 12.72% and 11.53%, respectively. The average parameters of the ten solar cell devices are shown in Table 2. Similarly, the average 0% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite solar cell is characterized by the lowest device performance (PCE = 9.12%, Jsc,JV = 11.47 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.205 V, and FF = 66.07%), and the average 2% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite solar cell shows the highest device performance with PCE = 13.17%, Jsc,JV = 13.68 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.270 eV, and FF = 75.86%. These results were in good agreement with the aforementioned SEM image, PL, TR-PL, and AFM results. It is noted that most of the good perovskite mid-cells (under wide-bandgap cells) generate Jsc,JV in the range of 23–26 mA cm−2.64–66 Therefore, the Jsc,JV of 14.19 mA cm−2 is well-matched to those of the other cells with MJ SC configurations. The Jsc,JV depends on the thickness of the absorber layer. Normally, a thick absorber generates higher Jsc,JV than a thin absorber layer. From the cross-sectional SEM images (in Fig. 1(a–e)), it was found that the thickness of the absorber layers is around 400 nm. Thus, the Jsc,JV can be increased by increasing the thickness of the absorber layer. On the other hand, we can further increase PCE of Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6-based solar cell devices. However, as mentioned above, for the wide-bandgap cell in MJ SCs, the thick absorber layer causes a loss of Jsc,JV in lower-bandgap cells. Obviously, a too thin absorber layer influences both Jsc,JV and Voc. The statistics of Voc, Jsc,JV, FF, and PCE of the ten solar cells with the Pb(SCN)2-added Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films as absorber layers are shown in Fig. 6(a–d). The statistics exhibit good reproducibility for various Pb(SCN)2 concentrations. At optimized 2% Pb(SCN)2, the Voc is the largest where the minimum value is 1.265 eV and maximum value is 1.30 eV. These open-circuit voltages are large for a bandgap energy of 1.87 eV. Since the Voc in a monolithic MJ SC is the sum of Voc of element cells, the Voc of subcells should be as large as possible to obtain high PCE. The large Voc is a good condition contributing to high PCE for MJ SCs. Table 3 shows PCEs of some mixed I–Br perovskite solar cells with Br content ≥50%. These Br-rich perovskite solar cells were applied as top cells for triple-junction solar cells. As mentioned earlier, it is not easy to achieve high quality Br-rich perovskite thin films because these absorber based cells have PCE below 13%.

Fig. 7(a) shows the steady-state current density and PCE of solar cell devices prepared using 0% and 2% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite films at the maximum power point under continuous 1 sun illumination. The maximum power points are located at 0.98 V and 1.06 V for the 0% and 2% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite thin film based solar cells, respectively. The steady-state device performance, including current density and PCE, of the 2% Pb(SCN)2-added perovskite film based solar cell remains unchanged after 15 minutes (PCE from 13.65% to 13.65% and current density from 12.88 mA cm−2 to 12.87 mA cm−2). However, for the cell without Pb(SCN)2, its device performance is slightly degraded (PCE from 9.37% to 9.25% and current density from 9.55 mA cm−2 to 9.44 mA cm−2). Fig. 7(b) demonstrates the thermal stability of representative solar cell devices with 2% Pb(SCN)2 and 0% Pb(SCN)2 at 65 °C without encapsulation. The solar cells were heated on a hotplate in a nitrogen-filled glove box. After 168 hours, the cell with 2% Pb(SCN)2 maintained 90% of its initial PCE, while the cell with 0% Pb(SCN)2 retained only 70%. Long-term stability of unencapsulated solar cells exposed to ambient air conditions (30% relative humidity, in the dark at room temperature) and in a nitrogen-filled glove box (H2O < 0, room temperature) is indicated in Fig. 7(c and d), respectively. The cell device with 2% Pb(SCN)2 retained 72% of its initial PCE after 480 hours (20 days) under ambient air conditions and 80% after 2280 hours (95 days) inside a nitrogen-filled glove box, whereas these values for the cell without Pb(SCN)2 were 48% and 39%, respectively. The results indicate that the perovskite solar cell with 2% Pb(SCN)2 is better than the one without Pb(SCN)2 in terms of photostability, thermal stability, and long-term stability. These results are well-matched with the previous results.

(b) Thermal stability of unencapsulated solar cell devices aged at 65 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box. Long-term stability of unencapsulated solar cell devices exposed (c) to ambient air and (d) in a nitrogen-filled glove box. 
To investigate the influence of various Pb(SCN)2 concentrations on the current production ability of the cells, we measured the EQE. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 6(f), in which the lowest and highest EQE are more than 60% and 80% for cells with 0% and 2% Pb(SCN)2, respectively. Since the cell with a lower EQE exhibits a higher trap state density in the active layer, the EQE results again confirm that the trap state density is reduced by adding Pb(SCN)2, and 2% Pb(SCN)2 is the optimized condition to obtain the maximum device performance. From the EQE spectra, the integrated current density (Jsc,EQE) is calculated using the following equation: (6)where Jsc,EQE is the integrated current density, q is the electric charge, h is Planck's constant, and λ is the wavelength. The calculated Jsc,EQE is 10.76, 11.83, 13.79, 12.82 and 12.43 mA cm−2 for cells with 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% Pb(SCN)2, respectively. Evidently, Jsc,EQE increases with the increasing concentration of Pb(SCN)2 and exhibits the lowest and highest values at 0% and 2% Pb(SCN)2 concentrations, respectively. Similar to the Jsc,JV, Jsc,EQE also decreases as the Pb(SCN)2 concentration increases beyond 2%. The maximum Jsc,EQE is obtained at 2% Pb(SCN)2 due to the best crystallinity and lowest trap state density in the crystal structure as discussed in detail in the previous sections. These Jsc,EQE values are comparable to those of Jsc,JV.
Conclusions
In summary, we successfully developed high-performance wide bandgap solar cells with a bandgap energy of approximately 1.87 eV using mixed iodide–bromide lead perovskites. The addition of Pb(SCN)2 to the perovskite precursor solutions resulted in significant improvements in the morphology, crystallization, and optical and electrical properties of the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin films, as evidenced by a series of characterization techniques including SEM, XRD, PL, TRPL, and AFM measurements. Our optimized concentration of 2% Pb(SCN)2 achieved a remarkable PCE of 13.66%, with an impressive Voc of 1.27 V and a Jsc,JV of 14.19 mA cm−2, for a Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 thin film-based solar cell. Overall, the wide-bandgap solar cells prepared using the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI1.4Br1.6 absorber layer are characterized by large Voc and Jsc and satisfy the current matching conditions, which makes them good candidates for top cells in multijunction solar cell configurations.
