    , Accepted 16th February 2021First published on 17th February 2021AbstractRecently, various strategies have been explored during research into the use of lanthanide-doped luminescent materials to mitigate energy loss at elevated dopant concentrations. Herein we report Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped Ba6Gd2Ti4O17 (BGTO) phosphors with a laminated lattice structure, which can allow the high-concentration doping of Er3+ ions into the oxide. Detailed investigations into the luminescence properties and crystal structures of Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped BGTO reveal that an increase in the dopant concentration is associated with the dimensional limitation of energy transfer in the crystal lattice. This finding may provide a novel avenue for the construction of high-dopant-concentration UC luminescent materials.
1. Introduction
UC luminescent materials have received considerable attention for applications such as use in optical temperature sensing, cell imaging, medicine, anti-counterfeiting, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their narrow emission bands, mild toxicity, long lifetimes, and so on.1–6 However, current UC luminescent materials still retain the defect of low doping concentrations.7–9 In principle, a high concentration of doping ions can cause surface defects and also collect energy from the excitation light through providing a high density of optical centers to promote up-conversion luminescence. The high-concentration doping of nanoparticles is usually achieved via surface passivation, and the main mechanism is non-radioactive excited-state depletion. In fact, this is usually observed in fluoride particles, but the high-concentration doping of oxides/glasses has also been observed.10–12 In addition, an increase in the dopant concentration will cause the distance between dopants to decrease, which will inevitably enhance the interactions between optical centers.13,14 Undesirable interactions, including long-distance energy transfer to surface/lattice defects and local cross-relaxation/phonon-assisted energy transfer, will lead to the depopulation of excited states and a reduction in UC emission.15–18 This phenomenon is the main obstacle preventing the construction of efficient UC luminescent materials.19,20 An important way to reduce the energy loss caused by energy migration is to construct matrices with crystal structures featuring large spacing between optical centers.8,21,22 In recent years, high-quality UC luminescent materials with layer-by-layer structures have been synthesized conventionally due to remarkable progress having been made, but there have been few explorations into oxide structures.23–26 In comparison, oxide compounds usually exhibit low toxicities and excellent chemical and thermal stabilities; thus they present broader application prospects.27,28
Among rare-earth ion-doped UC luminescent materials, Er3+ ions are the most essential activators because of their abundant energy levels and ability to convert near-infrared light into visible light.29,30 Also, Er3+ is an ion with excellent properties, such as a long excited-state lifetime, low electron energy level, and high luminescence quenching concentration. It can be utilized as a luminescence center to obtain green and red UC luminescence. However, the absorption cross-section of Er3+ ions is low under direct NIR excitation, which leads to weak UC emission intensity. Moreover, high doping concentrations can lead to non-radioactive excited state depletion and weakened emission intensity. Therefore, the sensitizer Yb3+ is often used as a co-dopant due to its large absorption cross-section at about 980 nm and its matching energy levels, which can effectively transfer energy to Er3+ ions.31,32 The UC emission intensity of Er3+ ions can be greatly enhanced with the assistance of Yb3+ ions.
In this work, we explore a special Ba6Gd2Ti4O17 (BGTO) phosphor that can achieve high-concentration Er3+-ion doping due to its inherent layered structure. BaO6 and GdO6 polyhedrons are alternately arranged in the crystal structure to present a laminated structure, which greatly improves the distance between adjacent Gd3+ ions. Therefore, when a huge amount of Yb3+ and Er3+ ions replace Gd3+ sites, the large distances between Gd3+ sites will alleviate the Er3+-ion concentration quenching effect. In addition, the luminescence properties of Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped BaGd2O4 (BGO) and BaGd2ZnO5 (BGZO) oxides also validate that the optimal doping amount of Er3+ ions in BGTO is superior to those of most oxides.33,34
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemical reagents
All chemicals used, including gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) (99.99%), barium carbonate (BaCO3) (99.99%), titanium dioxide (TiO2) (99.99%), zinc oxide (ZnO) (99.99%), boric acid (H3BO3) (99.99%), ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3) (99.99%), and erbium oxide (Er2O3) (99.99%), were commercially obtained and utilized without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of the BGTO:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors
A traditional high-temperature solid-state method was utilized to synthesize a series of BGTO:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors. BaCO3, Gd2O3, TiO2, Yb2O3, and Er2O3 were weighed based on the desired stoichiometric ratio. Furthermore, 2% H3BO3 was added as a flux compound. The raw materials were then placed in an agate mortar with a small amount of alcohol as a dispersant and ground for 30 min. After that, the mixture was preheated at 1173 K for 4 h and subsequently heated at 1573 K for 10 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, the sample was ground into powder for further measurements. The synthesis process of Ba6Y2Ti4O17 is consistent with the above process.
2.3 Synthesis of the BGO:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors
In brief, several BGO:Yb3+/Er3+ samples were prepared via a solid-state reaction using BaCO3, Gd2O3, Yb2O3, and Er2O3 as the raw materials. All the raw materials were mixed and ground thoroughly in an agate mortar. 9% BaCO3 was additionally added to compensate for volatilization at high temperature. The mixture was preheated at 1173 K for 3 h and subsequently calcinated at 1573 K for 10 h in air. When the sample had cooled down to room temperature (RT), it was then ground for 30 min.
2.4 Synthesis of the BGZO:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors
A series of BGZO:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors was prepared via a solid-state reaction. The raw materials, including BaCO3, Gd2O3, ZnO, Yb2O3, and Er2O3, were mixed and ground thoroughly in an agate mortar. The mixture was moved into an alumina mortar and then heated at 1473 K for 4 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, when the furnace cooled down to RT, the sample was ground again and collected.
2.5 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the synthesized samples was carried out using a Rigaku-Dmaxan (Tokyo, Japan) 2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) in the 2θ range from 10° to 80° and at a scanning rate of 15° min−1. UC emission spectra were obtained using an Andor Shamrock SR-750 fluorescence spectrometer with a 980 nm diode. A CCD detector combined with a monochromator was used to collect the signals from the samples. Luminescence spectra were obtained using an Andor SR-500i spectrometer (Andor Technology Co, Belfast, U.K.) The morphologies and sizes of the samples were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, XL30, Philips). For fluorescence decay curve measurements, samples were pumped via a laser-system consisting of a Nd:YAG pumping laser (1064 nm), a third-order harmonic-generator (355 nm), and a tunable optical parameter oscillator (OPO, Continuum Precision II 8000) with a pulse duration of 10 ns, a repetition frequency of 10 Hz, and a line width of 4–7 cm−1. The quantum yield was measured using a 3 W power-tunable NIR laser as the excitation source; an integrating sphere, a visible spectrometer, and a photomultiplier tube for measuring the up-converted visible signal; and a NIR spectrometer and photomultiplier tube for measuring the absorbed NIR light. The details of the quantum yield measurement procedure are the same as that reported previously.35
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structures of BGTO, BGO, and BGZO
XRD patterns of BGTO:0.1Yb3+/yEr3+ phosphors with various content levels of Er3+ ions are shown in Fig. 1a along with the corresponding standard card (CODID #4002506). Considering the effective ionic radii and valence states, the typical UC luminescence couple of Yb3+ (0.87 Å for CN = 6) and Er3+ (0.89 Å for CN = 6) ions preferably substitute for Gd3+ (0.94 Å for CN = 6) sites. Obviously, all the diffraction peaks are well matched with the standard data, and no extraneous phases appear in the patterns. The crystal structure of the BGTO matrix is presented in Fig. 1b and c; the Gd3+ sites in BGTO exhibit a layered distribution and adjacent [GdO6] polyhedrons are separated by [BaO6] polyhedrons. Both Ba and Gd atoms are hexa-coordinated with oxygen atoms in the unit cell, as displayed in Fig. 1e.22 The layered characteristics of the BGTO phosphor are beneficial for obtaining a high concentration of Yb3+/Er3+ ions, which will be explained in detail later. The Raman spectrum of BGTO is shown in Fig. S1.† The peak at 103 cm−1 is related to the symmetric bending vibrations of Ba–O bonds. The peaks at 240 and 282 cm−1 are attributed to the anti-symmetric stretching vibrations of O–Ti–O bonds and the bending vibrations of Ti–O–Ti bonds. The peak at 312 cm−1 may be related to the Gd–O vibrational mode and those at 563 and 820 cm−1 are caused by the symmetric vibrations and stretching vibrations, respectively, of the oxygen octahedrons.36–38,41

Besides the BGTO matrix, we have also investigated Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped BGO and BGZO phosphors featuring diverse crystallographic structures. By using a similar synthetic method to that mentioned above, a number of BGO:0.1Yb3+/zEr3+ and BGZO:0.1Yb3+/qEr3+ samples containing different concentrations of Er3+ are synthesized. Their corresponding XRD patterns and crystal structures are shown in Fig. 2a–d. Both sets of samples conform to their standard cards, and the unit cell structures do not possess the feature of a hierarchical Gd3+ site structure. Through comparing the local environments of Gd3+ ions in three samples, as seen in Fig. 2b, d and 1e, the Gd3+ ions in the BGTO host are located in six-coordinate regular octahedrons, while those in the BGO and BGZO hosts are situated in six- and seven-coordinate octahedrons, respectively. The local crystal environments of Gd3+ ions in these samples vary from each other. Furthermore, the morphologies of the BGTO, BGO, and BGZO phosphors are demonstrated in Fig. S2,† and they are composed of micron-sized particles.

3.2 Up-conversion luminescence and its mechanism in BGTO:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors
The UC luminescent spectrum of the BGTO:0.1Yb3+,0.25Er3+ sample is shown in Fig. 3a, and it contains two components. The green emission bands located at 537 and 562 nm are ascribed to the 2H11/2/4S15/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, and the red emission centered at 660 nm is attributed to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+. Fig. 3b shows that both the green and red emission intensities of BGTO:0.1Yb3+/yEr3+ phosphors are enhanced with an increase in the Er3+ concentration, and the emission intensities are strongest when the doping concentration of Er3+ reaches 0.25. A series of Ba6Y2Ti4O17:0.1Yb3+/yEr3+ (BYTO:0.1Yb3+/yEr3+, y = 0.05–0.35) samples that are isostructural to BGTO was also synthesized. It is found that when Gd3+ ions are replaced with smaller Y3+ ions, the red/green (R/G) ratio of BYTO:0.1Yb3+/yEr3+ does not change significantly, and the optimal doping concentration of Er3+ ions is 0.25, as seen in Fig. S3,† which is the same as that of Er3+ ions in BGTO. This indicates that the high-concentration doping of Er3+ ions is related to the crystal structure of the sample. After reaching an optimal level, the UC emission intensity gradually decreases due to concentration quenching. In addition, at a high Er3+ concentration, upon comparing the UC luminescence of the BGTO:0.1Yb3+/0.25Er3+ phosphor with the ordinary Y2O3:0.1Yb3+/0.25Er3+ rare-earth sesquioxide, the intensity of the former is more than twice that of the latter, as seen in Fig. S4.†Fig. 3c exhibits the UC emission spectra of BGTO:xYb3+/0.25Er3+ with different content levels of Yb3+ (x = 0.05–0.15). It can be found that the UC luminescence intensity gradually decreases when the concentration of Yb3+ exceeds 0.1 due to concentration quenching and back energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ ions.

(e) The energy level diagram of Yb3+/Er3+ and the possible energy-transfer mechanism. 
In addition, the UC luminescent spectra of several Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped BGO and BGZO phosphors as a function of the Er3+-doping content are further explored in Fig. 4a and b. The optimal red and green UC emission intensities of the BGO:0.1Yb3+/zEr3+ and BGZO:0.1Yb3+/qEr3+ phosphors are obtained at z = 0.05 and q = 0.05, respectively. Obviously, comparing all three samples together, the optimal doping concentration of Er3+ ions in BGTO is much greater than those in the BGO and BGZO phosphors, which further proves that this phenomenon is mainly due to the characteristics of the layered structure. Interestingly, although the experimental conditions, such as the sampling position/angle/height, are the same when measuring the emission spectra of the three samples, Fig. 6a and b displays that the integrated red/green luminescence intensity ratios of the three phosphors are different, regardless of the identical Yb3+/Er3+ doping concentrations. The error bars for the emission intensities of BGO, BGTO, and BGZO with different Er3+ concentrations are given in Fig. S5.† This phenomenon arises because the R/G ratios after Er3+ doping in these samples are susceptibly affected by changes in the localized crystal structures of the host Gd3+ ions.39,40 The R/G ratios of the BGO:0.1Yb3+/0.05Er3+ and BGTO:0.1Yb3+/0.25Er3+ phosphors are also slightly affected by laser self-induced heating, as seen in Fig. S6 and 7.† The overall quantum yields of BGZO:0.1Yb3+/0.05Er3+, BGO:0.1Yb3+/0.05Er3+, and BGTO:0.1Yb3+/0.25Er3+ are measured to be 0.11%, 0.065%, and 0.0013% at an excitation power density of 0.5 W mm−2. Yang et al. measured the quantum yields of BGZO:0.09Yb3+/0.03Er3+ and BGO:0.09Yb3+/0.03Er3+ to be 4% and 0.256%, approximately 20 times higher than our results. The phonon energies of BGO and BGZO are similar, but the overall quantum yields of these samples are quite different, indicating that the influences of the crystal structure and composition on the quantum yield cannot be ignored.41,42

As shown in Fig. 5a–h, the fluorescence decay curves of the 4F9/2 and 4S3/2 levels in BGTO:0.1Yb3+/yEr3+ under 980 nm excitation can be well fitted using the following exponential function: I(t) = I0 + Aexp(−t/τ)(1)where I(t) and I0 are the emission intensities corresponding to the times t and t = 0, respectively, A represents a constant, and τ is the fluorescence lifetime.43 The fluorescence lifetimes increase first and then decrease upon increasing the Er3+ doping concentration. The variations of the luminescence lifetimes are consistent with those of the emission spectra. The decay curves of BGO:0.1Yb3+/zEr3+ and BGZO:0.1Yb3+/qEr3+ can also be fitted using eqn (1), and the lifetimes are shown in Fig. S8 and S9.† It can be found that the overall fluorescence lifetimes of BGTO are longer in comparison.

To elucidate the UC luminescence process and mechanism in Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped BGTO phosphors, UC luminescence spectra at various excitation powers are measured. Generally, a large number of photons are related to the UC process, and the photon number (n) is determined according to the mathematical relationship between the up-conversion luminescence intensity (I) and excitation power (P): I ∝ Pn(2)where the value of n represents the number of infrared photons absorbed during the UC luminescence process. Fig. 3d shows double logarithmic plots of the integrated green and red emission intensities of a BGTO:0.1Yb3+/0.25Er3+ sample at various excitation powers. The n values obtained from the slopes of the straight lines are 2.13 and 1.82, respectively, implying that the green and red emission processes are two-photon processes. Moreover, via measuring the power dependence profiles at different Yb3+/Er3+ concentrations (0.1Yb3+/0.05Er3+ and 0.1Yb3+/0.25Er3+) at the same time, it is found that the power dependence profiles under different concentrations are basically the same, as seen in Fig. S9.† The UC luminescence spectra of BGO:0.1Yb3+/0.05Er3+ and BGZO:0.1Yb3+/0.05Er3+ at various excitation powers and double logarithmic plots of the integrated green and red emission intensities are also provided in Fig. S11 and S12.†
Based on the above results, schematic diagrams of the energy levels of Yb3+/Er3+ ions during 980 nm excitation are shown in Fig. 3e and S11d, S12d.† Firstly, Er3+ ions in the ground state of 4I15/2 will be excited to the 4I11/2 state upon Yb3+/Er3+ energy transfer (ET) or ground-state absorption (GSA). Then, some excited electrons in the 4I11/2 state are pumped to the 4F7/2 level via second-step Yb3+/Er3+ ET or excited-state absorption (ESA ). Finally, these electrons will relax to the 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 levels, followed by green 4S3/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions. Furthermore, there are two probable paths for populating the 4F9/2 state for red UC emission. One is that the electrons in the 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 states will relax to the 4F9/2 level via nonradiative relaxation. The other is that electrons at the 4I11/2 level could relax to the 4I13/2 level without radiation and then be further excited to the 4F9/2 state, followed by red emission.
3.3 Mechanism of the high-concentration Er3+-doping performance
Unlike conventional oxides (i.e., BGO and BGZO), BGTO hosts present obviously laminated lattice structures with stacking along the a axis that are explicitly divided into Gd–O-enriched layers and Ba–O-enriched layers. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 6c and d, such laminated structures result in larger Gd–Gd distances both within Gd–O layers and between layers (5.93 and 7.27/7.49 Å, respectively, which are greater than the values in general oxides). When the amount of Er3+ ions occupying Gd3+ sites is low, each Er3+ ion cannot effectively receive energy from Yb3+ due to distance limitations between Yb3+ and Er3+, as shown in Fig. 7a and d. Thus, the UC luminescence intensity is weak at a low Er3+ content, as shown in Fig. 3. Interestingly, activator-induced concentration quenching in BGTO is significantly extended from y = 0.05 to y = 0.25 for Er3+ compared with BGO and BGZO, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. This high-concentration doping is because Yb3+ (x = 0.1) and Er3+ (y = 0.25) ions can be dispersed uniformly in the BGTO matrix and the greater distance between Yb3+ and Er3+ ions does not cause concentration quenching; therefore, energy transfer between ions can be performed sufficiently. In addition, a key point is that the BaO6 polyhedrons contribute to increasing the distances between activators via separating the Gd–O layers. Notably, the extended concentration quenching effect benefits from the layered structure characteristics of BGTO and the superior ionic distances between two adjacent Gd3+ ions and bond lengths of Gd–O, as listed in Table 1.

Both activator and sensitizer ions in UC luminescent materials are subject to concentration quenching. The UC luminescence intensity begins to decrease when y > 0.25, which is due to Er3+-related concentration quenching. On the other hand, Fig. 7b shows that Yb3+ ions cannot effectively transfer energy to Er3+ ions that are far away when the concentration of Er3+ is excessive. Fig. 7c reveals that when the concentration of Yb3+ is higher than the optimal doping concentration (x > 0.1), Er3+ ions will transfer energy to Yb3+ in reverse, and Yb3+ and Yb3+ ions will also transfer energy between each other, resulting in Yb3+-related concentration quenching.9,15 Moreover, when the doping concentrations of Yb3+ and Er3+ are massive, through long-distance energy migration, the excitation energy is easily captured by quenching sites such as impurities and defects and is lost non-radiatively, causing a reduction in the UC luminescence intensity.
4. Conclusions
In summary, series of Ba6Gd2−x−yTi4O17:xYb3+/yEr3+, BaGd2−zO4:0.1Yb3+/zEr3+, and BaGd2−qZnO5:0.1Yb3+/qEr3+ phosphors are synthesized via solid-phase reactions, and their up-conversion luminescence mechanisms are investigated in detail. The laminated lattice structure involving alternately arranged GdO6 and BaO6 polyhedrons is the key to achieving high-concentration doping in the BGTO matrix, and the optimal doping concentration of Er3+ ions can be as high as y = 0.25. Moreover, the overall fluorescence lifetime of BGTO is better than those of BGO and BGZO. Although progress has been made in terms of the doping concentration, future developments still involve challenges, including further improving the up-conversion efficiency and exploring novel up-conversion host materials and structures.
