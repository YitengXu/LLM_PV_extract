The dispersed α-Fe2O3 powder is subjected to a pulsed excimer laser (248 nm) irradiation at an energy density of ∼214 mJ cm−2 and pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz for 5 h under constant stirring in the presence of aqueous ammonia. It has been observed that the α-Fe2O3 particles get gradually converted into Fe3O4, which can be visualized from the change in the color of the solution from red to dark red, and then finally to a black colored solution. The phase conversion from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 has also been confirmed by various characterizations, such as Raman and Mössbauer spectra. From the Mössbauer spectra at the end of 5 h laser irradiation 87% of Fe3O4 was observed. The detailed mechanism of the formation of these particles has been investigated. The performance of these particles was verified for use as anode materials in Li ion batteries. The iron oxide particles show a capacity of 1100 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1. This capacity is highly stable up to 40 cycles without any significant capacity fading. A coulombic efficiency of 97% has been achieved with high stability and reversibility.IntroductionLithium ion batteries have been widely used for power sources for portable electronics over the past several decades.1–4 Immense research has been carried out to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of Li ion batteries by designing and manipulating the anode and cathode materials. The efficiency of Li ion batteries is limited because of the low theoretical capacity (372 mA h g−1) of the graphite anode.5,6 Hence they are unable to meet the energy demands of portable electronics having a high energy and a high power density. The current research is thus focused on the synthesis of novel anode materials with promising properties for high performance Li ion batteries.Apart from carbon materials, various nanostructured transition metal oxides, such as Fe2O3, Fe3O4, NiO, CoO, Co3O4, CuO etc., are being widely investigated as anode materials for Li ion batteries because of their high capacity.7–11 These materials can replace conventional graphite anodes because of their high theoretical capacity which ranges from 500 to 1200 mA h g−1.12–16 However most of these metal oxides usually suffer from very high volume expansion/contraction, and severe particle aggregation associated with the Li ion insertion/extraction process. This results in a large capacity fading and poor cycling stability, especially at high rates. Despite enormous research for the improvement of properties of anode materials, reversible capacity, cyclability, and high-rate capability are still unresolved major issues and remain a great challenge for this field of Li ion batteries.17–22Among the various metal oxides, hematite (α-Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) have been widely studied as the most promising electrode materials because of their high theoretical capacity (1004 mA h g−1 for α-Fe2O3 and 924 mA h g−1 for Fe3O4), eco-friendliness, and natural (earth) abundance.23–28The reactions of α-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 with lithium can be written as follows.α-Fe2O3 + 6Li+ + 6e− ↔ 2Fe0 + 3Li2OFe3O4 + 8Li+ + 8e− ↔ 3Fe0 + 4Li2OWhen coupled with their higher intrinsic densities, iron oxides offer volumetric capacities about six times higher than graphite (5.17–5.24 g cm−3vs. 2.16 g cm−3 for graphite), which is a major advantage for smaller battery packs.29–31The performance of these iron oxides is also affected by their synthesis method. Mostly these oxides are synthesized by sol–gel, hydrothermal, co-precipitation, soft and hard templating, microwave, electrodeposition and electrospinning techniques.32–39 The morphological control of these oxides materials is becoming increasingly important for high performance in Li ion battery design. Because of the Li intercalation process, the size and shape of these materials should be ideal to avoid distortion of the structure and capacity loss.Fe3O4 is one of the promising anode materials for LIB compared to its counterparts Fe2O3 and FeO.40–45 There are several reports available about the use of Fe3O4 nanostructures as electrode materials for LIB applications, but these reports failed to address various issues and limitations. The major limitations of Fe3O4 as an anode material are the fading capacity due to the lack of stability and the decrease in the coulombic efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report available on the direct conversion of α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. As known, α-Fe2O3 is the most stable phase amongst all the iron oxides, and converting α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 is a non-trivial process. On the other hand, the reduction of α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 under abnormal pressure conditions has been reported for other applications.46,47In this work we synthesized mesoscopic Fe3O4 by a novel and simple method involving the exposure of α-Fe2O3 bulk powder suspended in water to 20 ns UV (248 nm) excimer laser pulses under constant stirring. In view of the nature of the results obtained, we term this as a pulsed laser induced reactive micro-bubble synthesis (PLRMS) process. The pulsed UV laser treatment of suitably chosen chemical precursors is a very unique method for the synthesis of nanoparticles because of two reasons; first the photo-dissociation of molecules caused by direct UV laser absorption and second, high temperature local heating (few thousand degrees, plasma formation) caused by energy dissipation leading to high local pressures as well.48,49 These dynamics effects render chemical changes in the molecules and precursors, including decomposition and subsequent associations/reactions with the suspending media or immediate surroundings. The reactions can in fact be manipulated by adding some external reagents which can construct totally new compounds after the photo-thermal melting. After the short time melting either the photofusion or photo-fragmentation of particles was observed which leads to bigger and smaller particles respectively.50,51 There have been many reports on the size reduction of gold and silver nanoparticles in colloidal solutions by pulsed laser photo-fragmentation.50–52 Separately, the size growth of gold nanoparticles has also been reported using pulsed 532 nm laser light, wherein a maximum size of 100 nm was achieved due to the subsequent photo-fragmentation.53,54 Thus, laser irradiation techniques have been primarily used to control the size of particles. The tremendous promise of this technique in terms of the reactive synthesis however has remained considerably less explored.In this work the direct conversion of α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 has been observed with no intermediate product formation. We believe that the 20 ns UV (248 nm, hν = 5 eV) laser pulses melt and vaporize the bulk α-Fe2O3 particles suspended in the water/ammonia solution forming bubbles with local high pressure/superheated water and ammonia (vapour) resulting in the formation of reduced phase Fe3O4. A small percentage of α-Fe2O3 remains in the final powder synthesized under the processing conditions employed. The rounded spherical type morphology realized herein conforms to this picture very well. Various characterizations confirm the formation of the ferromagnetic magnetite phase. We tested these iron oxide particles as an anode material for Li ion batteries and found a high capacity of ∼1100 mA h g−1. Interestingly the capacity of the laser synthesized iron oxide particles is highly stable up to 40 cycles with 97% coulombic efficiency retention.Experimental sectionMaterialsBulk α-Fe2O3 was purchased from Alfa Aesar (99.99%) and aqueous 30% NH3 solution was obtained from Rankem chemicals.The synthesis of Fe3O4 particles from bulk α-Fe2O3100 mg of bulk α-Fe2O3 powder was dispersed in 25 ml of water by using ultra-sonication in a probe sonicator for 30 min. To the above solution 25 ml of 30% aqueous NH3 solution was added and the entire solution was transferred to a 100 ml quartz beaker. This solution was then subjected to pulsed excimer laser (248 nm, pulse width 20 ns) irradiation at an energy density of ∼214 mJ cm−2 and pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz for 5 h under constant stirring. This solution was then washed with D.I. water several times to remove excess ammonia and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The dried powder was then used as an anode material in Li ion batteries. To observe the phase change during the progression of the reaction samples were subjected to laser irradiation for different times and thoroughly characterized by various techniques (30 min, 1.5 h, 3 h, and 5 h).CharacterizationsThe synthesized α-Fe2O3 and the powder synthesized after 5 h laser irradiation were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction using a Philips X'Pert PRO diffractometer with nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation, Raman spectroscopy using a Lab RAM HR800 from JY Horiba, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy using an IFEI Tecnai F30 with 300 KV FEG and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4200). The surfaces of the iron oxides were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on a VG scientific ESCA-3000 spectrometer using non-mono-chromatized Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV) at a pressure of about 1 × 10−9 Torr. All the electrochemistry measurements were done with an Autolab PGSTAT30 (Eco-Chemie). The magnetism measurements were performed on a SQUIDVSM magnetometer (Quantum Design). Mössbauer analysis was performed using a 57Co(Rh) γ-ray source and α-Fe foil as the standard for calibration. Diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded in a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer.Electrochemical measurementsAll the electrochemical measurements were carried out by using two electrode CR 2016 coin cell assemblies. The working electrode was prepared by making a slurry of the laser synthesized iron oxide with conducting carbon (Super-P) and binder (teflonized acetylene black, TAB-2) using ethanol as the solvent and pressing it on a 200 mm2 stainless steel mesh (Goodfellow, UK). Pure Li metal was used for the counter electrode. A micro-porous paper (Whatman, Cat. no. 1825-047, UK) was used as a separator along with 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)–dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 wt%, Selectipur LP 30, Merck KGaA, Germany) as the electrolyte solution. All this cell assembly process was carried out in a glove box to maintain an inert atmosphere. The performance of the coin cell was then tested for several charge and discharge cycles.Results and discussionFig. 1a and b are pictures of quartz beakers containing the α-Fe2O3 solution before laser irradiation (dark red coloured solution) and the solution obtained after 5 h laser irradiation under stirring (black coloured Fe3O4). After stopping the magnetic stirring all the particles get attracted quickly towards the magnetic needles, as shown in Fig. 1c. One can also put a magnet on the side to pull all of the powder sideways. Given the non-magnetic character of α-Fe2O3 and the ferromagnetism (FM) arising only from Fe3O4, this result implies that either all the α-Fe2O3 is converted into Fe3O4, or one has a composite of the two with a strong contribution of the FM phase. Fig. 1  Conversion of bulk α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 after 5 h laser irradiation; (a) α-Fe2O3 in aqueous ammonia solution before laser irradiation; (b) After 5 h laser irradiation showing formation of the black colored Fe3O4; (c) Magnetic iron oxide particles attracted to the magnetic needle after the stirring stopped. Fig. 2 shows the XRD of bulk α-Fe2O3 and various samples obtained after pulsed laser irradiation for different times (30 min, 1.5 h, 3 h and 5 h). It can be observed from this figure that the XRD of the bulk Fe2O3 shows a pure phase of hematite, whereas after 30 min of laser irradiation the peaks begin to get modified, implying changes in the phase constitution. After about 1.5 h of laser irradiation new peaks of magnetite (Fe3O4) start appearing gradually, indicating a partial conversation of α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, whereas after 3 h the intensity of the new peaks corresponding to the Fe3O4 phase start increasing significantly with a concurrent decrease in the intensity of the α-Fe2O3 peaks. After 5 h of laser irradiation an almost complete conversion of α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 is observed as the XRD shows a magnetite phase with a tiny percentage of hematite (small peaks in the XRD). In the case of the bulk α-Fe2O3 the highest intensity peak was observed at a 2θ value of 33.1°, which corresponds to the (104) plane(s), but after 5 h irradiation the highest intensity peak observed is at 35.4 (311 plane) which belongs to the magnetite phase (Fe3O4). Fig. 2  XRD spectra of the laser synthesized powders at different time intervals: bulk α-Fe2O3, after laser irradiation for 30 min, 1.5 h, 3 h and 5 h along with a standard spectra of α-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 for comparison. Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of the initial bulk α-Fe2O3 and the iron oxide (mainly Fe3O4 with a small contribution of α-Fe2O3) powder formed after 5 h laser irradiation. It is observed that along with the Fe3O4 there are small signatures of α-Fe2O3 (shown by *) at the surface after 5 h laser irradiation. The Raman spectra of the bulk α-Fe2O3 shows a number of peaks at 228 cm−1 (A1g) (s), 244 cm−1 (Eg) (w), 292 cm−1 (Eg) (s), 412 cm−1 (Eg) (s), 499 cm−1 (A1g) (w), 612 cm−1 (Eg) (m), 660 cm−1 (longitudinal optical, Eu), 1320 cm−1 (s). These correspond to the pure hematite phase.55,56 In the case of the 5 h laser irradiated sample weak features are noted at 300 and 550 cm−1, which are assigned as the T1g mode of vibration of magnetite, whereas a strong peak is noted at 670 cm−1 which belongs to the A1g mode of magnetite (Fe3O4). These results are in good agreement with the reported literature values and confirm the formation of the Fe3O4 phase.56–60 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of the α-Fe2O3 and iron oxide powder synthesized after 5 h laser irradiation. The morphological features of the bulk α-Fe2O3 and iron oxide powder formed after 5 h of pulsed laser treatment are reflected by the SEM images in Fig. 4. These images show that in the case of bulk α-Fe2O3 a random distribution of particles is seen with agglomeration. After 5 h of laser irradiation these particles show a remarkable morphology evolution forming nearly spherical balls of 200–250 nm with defined features. The morphology of the iron oxide particles formed was also studied by HRTEM imaging, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 4  SEM images of bulk α-Fe2O3 (a and b), and the material synthesized after 5 h laser irradiation (c and d).  Fig. 5  (a–c) TEM images of the iron oxide particles formed after laser irradiation on different scales, (d) lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.48 nm corresponding to Fe3O4. In Fig. 5a–c spherical balls of iron oxide (mainly Fe3O4 with a small contribution of α-Fe2O3) with a particle size around 200–250 nm are observed and the lattice fringes shown in Fig. 5d match very well with the spinel Fe3O4 phase with a d-spacing of 0.48 nm.As stated in the discussion about the XRD, a tiny percentage of hematite (α-Fe2O3) was also noted in the sample. In order to understand its location in the nanostructure we employed a dark field imaging technique using the diffraction spots identified with this phase. Fig. 6(a) shows a typical TEM image of the 5 h processed sample along with the SAED pattern, and Fig. 6(b) shows the dark field image taken of the same area by selecting a few diffraction spots corresponding to a lattice parameter of 0.27 nm representing an identifiable contribution from α-Fe2O3 where no diffraction from Fe3O4 is present. One can clearly see that most of the hematite contribution is present towards the surface layers of the spherical features. Fig. 6  (a) TEM image of the 5 h processed sample, inset is the SAED pattern highlighting spots corresponding to a d-spacing of 0.27 nm; (b) the dark field image taken of the same area by selecting the diffraction spots shown in (a). The change of phase from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 was also studied by Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and the data is shown in Fig. 7 The dark red colour of pure Fe2O3 (hematite) can be explained by a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (CT) transition (O2− → 2t2g (Fe3+)), which leads to a strong absorption peak (565–575 nm) in the UV range and extending to the visible range. Apart from this the band related to 6A1g → 4T2g appears in the range 673–677 nm.61,62 All these bands are absent in the case of the iron oxide (mainly Fe3O4 with a small contribution from the α-Fe2O3) sample synthesized after 5 h laser irradiation, which is because of the strong absorption by the black colour of Fe3O4. Fig. 7  Diffuse reflectance spectra of bulk α-Fe2O3 and the material synthesized after 5 h laser irradiation. Mössbauer analysis is the most appropriate analysis for iron oxides. Fig. 8 depicts the Mössbauer spectra of bulk hematite and the samples obtained after pulsed laser irradiation for different times (30 min, 90 min and 180 min). These spectra show that in the case of bulk hematite powder all the peaks match well with the α-Fe2O3 phase and in the other samples irradiated for different time intervals the formation of Fe3O4 phase can be clearly seen with an increase in the Fe3O4 peak area and decrease in the Fe2O3 peak area. In the case of the 5 h laser irradiation the Mössbauer spectra shows a magnetite phase along with a small percentage of hematite (Fig. 9a). Fig. 9b represents the percentage area of hematite and magnetite calculated from the Mössbauer spectra vs. time, where it is clear that the percentage area of the hematite decreases with the time of laser irradiation, along with a concurrent increase in the percentage area of the magnetite. After 5 h laser irradiation 87% of magnetite is seen in the sample along with 13% of hematite. Fig. 8  Mössbauer spectra for α-Fe2O3 after laser irradiation for different time intervals: 30 min, 90 min, 180 min; showing the gradual formation of Fe3O4 (blue colour) from α-Fe2O3 (yellow).  Fig. 9  (a) Mössbauer spectra of the material formed after 5 h laser irradiation; (b) plot of the area percentage vs. time for α-Fe2O3, Fe3O4 for samples laser irradiated for different time durations as calculated from the Mössbauer spectra. After the laser irradiation, all of the black coloured powder was observed to be highly magnetic, hence we also performed magnetization measurements using a SQUID magnetometer. The M–H curves (Fig. 10) for all the samples show that in the case of bulk α-Fe2O3 no saturation magnetization was observed, as expected in view of its antiferromagnetic nature, whereas in the case of the 5 h laser irradiated sample a high saturation magnetization of 80 emu g−1 is observed. Given the known saturation magnetization of pure magnetite of 92 emu g−1, this is consistent with the Mössbauer result that 87% of the sample was ferromagnetic. In all the other samples irradiated from 30 min to 3 h there is a progressive increase in the saturation magnetization indicating the gradual increase in the magnetic Fe3O4 component at the expense of the antiferromagnetic α-Fe2O3 powder. The nature of these curves shows ferromagnetic behaviour with a coercive field of about 137 Oe (inset in the figure) representing the typical behaviour of Fe3O4. Clearly the particles formed are not superparamagnetic and this is consistent with the size of the particles as seen from the TEM/SEM results. Fig. 10  M–H curves for bulk α-Fe2O3, and the materials obtained after laser irradiation for 30 min, 1.5 h, 3 h and 5 h; inset is the magnified version to show coercivity. From the above characterizations it can be concluded that commercial bulk α-Fe2O3 powder gets slowly converted to magnetite (Fe3O4) with laser irradiation in the presence of NH3 solution. The chemical reaction between α-Fe2O3 and aqueous NH3 solution (NH4OH) can be written as follows.9α-Fe2O3 + 2NH4OH → 6Fe3O4 + N2 + 5H2OWhen solution suspended bulk α-Fe2O3 powder is subjected to UV laser pulses, because of the high energy density of laser pulses (20 ns, 5 eV photons) a photothermal melting and vaporization of α-Fe2O3 particle surface layers can easily occur with a very high local temperature (a few thousand degrees). During this sequence of highly non-equilibrium events aqueous ammonium hydroxide can take out oxygen and form water and nitrogen molecules. This can result in the conversion of α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, which would occur over a period of micro-milliseconds through relaxation of the excited micro-bubble zone, although the laser pulse itself ceases in 20 ns. In solution based laser irradiation, photothermal melting leads to two types of phenomena, photofission (photo fragmentation) or photofusion. If the melted state undergoes photo fission/fragmentation then the particle size will be smaller than the original, whereas if photofusion occurs then the particle size grows bigger than the original size. The size reduction takes place because of the vaporization of the particle. When the temperature of the particle rises to boiling point, atoms and/or small particles are ejected through vaporization. This results in the reduction of the particle size. The amount of the ejected atoms and/or small particles depends on the absorbed laser energy. However in the case of photofusion, the particle size grows to form bigger particles. The size growth by the photothermal melting process proceeds very slowly. There are many reports showing that particle aggregation before irradiation is an important factor for particle fusion.63,64 Because of the Brownian motion of the particles in the solution, the particles attract each other and become aggregated because of weak repulsive forces and attractive dipole–dipole interactions (hydrodynamic forces) leading to an increase in the particle size.65In this case the conversion of α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 occurs through a photofusion process as the particle size grows bigger and becomes spherical in nature because of the minimum surface energy.Based on the above discussion a possible mechanism pathway is shown in Fig. 11. When solution dispersed α-Fe2O3 particles are subjected to pulsed UV laser irradiation the photon energy gets absorbed quickly and is then transmitted quite efficiently into the internal modes of the nanoparticles causing immense heating. If we assume in the first approximation that the incident energy is fully absorbed by the particle (absorption coefficient α = 1), for the case of an average spherical particle of 80 nm diameter the estimated absorbed energy per particle per pulse turns out to be ∼1.07 × 10−11 J. Once again assuming that all of this energy is transformed into thermal energy, the temperature rise of a single particle per pulse can be estimated to be >12000 °C (the specific heat capacity of α-Fe2O3 is taken to be to be 669 J kg−1 °C−1). Even if the incident energy is partially absorbed and/or there are losses of heat energy to the immediate surroundings via latent heat of vaporization, the crude estimate implies that the matter in the particle will evaporate very quickly and could also cause some ionization. Since the particle is suspended in solution the liquid layers in proximity will also evaporate rapidly causing cavitation or micro-bubble formation. Fig. 11  Possible mechanism pathway for the synthesis of Fe3O4 from bulk α-Fe2O3. This micro-bubble would then comprise of atoms, ions and radicals of the matter forming the nanoparticles, as well as the liquid used for suspending the particles. Before the next 20 ns laser pulse strikes (for 10 Hz repetition frequency, this would be after 100 ms) rapid cooling of the hot micro-bubbles would occur by dissipation of thermal energy to the ambient liquid, and in the process the atoms, ions and radicals in the micro-bubble would react to form a compound. Continuation of the process over several hours can then transform and re-transform the whole material into another form and phase as observed. The phase would of course depend on the nature of the solution. For example, if it is simply water we get only α-Fe2O3, but with different sizes and shapes. On the other hand in the presence of ammonia solution, we can get spherical and larger Fe3O4 particles due to its reducing nature. The observed spherical shapes of the particles in the final product are a testimony to the presence of vapours in solution, which can cause micro-bubbles for surface energy minimization. The increase in the size of the particles implies fusion of the material due to repeated exposure to successive laser pulses.Since Fe3O4 is the most important transition metal oxide which has been widely studied as an anode material for Li ion batteries (theoretical capacity 924 mA h g−1), we examined the electrochemical properties of the pulsed laser synthesized iron oxide (mainly Fe3O4 with a small contribution of α-Fe2O3) as an anode material. Before presenting these battery testing results it is also useful to present the data on the surface area and pore-size distribution properties of the synthesized material. The BET surface area of the iron oxide powder synthesized after 5 h laser irradiation is found to be 100 m2 g−1. The full adsorption–desorption isotherm is shown in Fig. 12a. From the pore distribution diagram shown in Fig. 12b it can be seen that primarily only tiny pores of a mean size of 0.5 nm are present along with some pores with a size of around 2–10 nm. Fig. 12  (a) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of iron oxide synthesized after 5 h laser irradiation; (b) pore distribution diagram of the same powder showing a majority of 0.5 nm pores. Also, to verify the conductivity of bulk α-Fe2O3 and iron oxide after 5 h laser irradiation electrochemical impedance analysis was performed and the corresponding data is shown in the ESI Fig. S1.† From the impedance analysis it is clear that the iron oxide synthesized after 5 h laser irradiation is much more conducting in nature than the bulk α-Fe2O3, which is expected since the powder contains a majority amount of Fe3O4 and only a small percentage of α-Fe2O3. To study the charge–discharge behaviour Cyclic Voltametry (CV) is the most convenient tool. CV measurements for the laser-synthesized iron oxide mesoscopic spheres were performed for a Li/iron oxide half cell at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 between 0.005 and 3 V vs. Li. The results are shown in Fig. 13a in which metallic lithium acts as both the counter and reference electrode. During the first cathodic reaction one single peak appears at 0.54 V, which corresponds to the reduction of Fe3O4 to Fe0, which is due to the insertion of Li into the Fe3O4 lattice.40 Further, electrolyte decomposition and the subsequent formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) cannot be ruled out. Similarly in the first anodic process two peaks are noted at 1.68 V and 1.84 V which correspond to the gradual oxidation of Fe0 to Fe2+ and then to Fe3+ to reform the magnetite phase. The related electrochemical reactions are as given below:Fe3O4 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Li2(Fe3O4)Li2 (Fe3O4) + 6Li+ + 6e− → 3Fe0 + 4Li2O3Fe0 + 4Li2O ↔ Fe3O4 + 8Li+ + 8e− Fig. 13  (a) Cyclic voltammogram of Li/iron oxide half cell recorded between 0.005 and 3 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1; (b) typical galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of Li/iron oxide half-cell cycled between 0.005 and 3 V vs. Li at a constant current density of 100 mA g−1 in ambient temperature conditions; (c) plot of capacity vs. cycle number for Li/iron oxide half-cells cycled between 0.005 and 3 V vs. Li at different current densities from 0.1 to 2 A g−1; (d) cycling profiles of Li/iron oxide half-cells cycled between 0.005 and 3 V vs. Li at constant current density of 100 mA g−1 with coulombic efficiency. The intensity of the subsequent cathodic peaks decreases substantially because of the initial irreversible capacity loss. In the further cathodic and anodic cycles, there is not much change in the peak positions and peak intensities, which represents the low polarization and high level reversible lithiation and delithiation process.66,67Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were also performed in a half-cell assembly (Li/iron oxide) between 0.005 and 3 V vs. Li at a constant current density of 100 mA g−1 and this data is shown in Fig. 13b. The initial specific discharge capacity was found to be 1723 mA h g−1, whereas during the second cycle the discharge capacity decreased to 1100 mA h g−1. Such a capacity loss (irreversible capacity loss) is common for most of the transition metal oxides, which is due to electrolyte decomposition and the formation of a solid electrolyte inter-phase layer (SEI).68 For the initial half cycle the discharge voltage drops down to 1.5 V and then gradually drops further to 0.9 V, then forming a small plateau between 0.8 V and 0.7 V. This plateau is clearly visible in the second cycle which is a typical characteristic of Fe3O4. The capacity contribution from the small amount of hematite phase present along with Fe3O4 cannot be ruled out, since Fe2O3 is one of the high capacity electro-active materials and undergoes a similar kind of metallic reduction i.e. conversion reaction.24The rate performance of the laser-synthesized iron oxide mesoscopic spheres is shown in Fig. 13c, which was investigated for different current densities (100 mA g−1, 250 mA g−1, 500 mA g−1, 1 A g−1 and 2 A g−1). A usual decrease in the specific capacity was observed with an increase in the current density. The decrease in the reversible capacity is mainly due to the limited participation of active material (mainly the surface) in the reaction because of the high current rate, whereas at a low current density all the surface, as well as the bulk of the material, can easily take part in the electrochemical reaction, thereby enhancing the total specific capacity. At a current density of 100 mA g−1 the discharge capacity was found to be 1100 mA h g−1 and was maintained at 530 mA h g−1, even at a current density as high as 1 A g−1 which is greater than the theoretical capacity of graphite. After cycling at a high current density (2 A g−1) when the current was retained to 250 mA g−1 the material shows almost the same reversible capacity as before which signifies its high rate capability and reversibility. Although, the laser synthesized iron oxide delivered a good performance at high currents, it experiences significant drops from one current density to another, which suggests that the electrical conductivity profiles of Fe3O4 is not sufficient to translate the original capacity. We believe carbon coating or making composite with carbon certainly ensures its high power capability.The cyclic stability of the laser-synthesized iron oxide was investigated at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and it was observed that the specific capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 was obtained, which is stable up to 40 cycles without any capacity fading (Fig. 13d). This high stability is because of a highly stable Fe3O4 structure which allows the reversible lithiation and delithiation. After 40 cycles the capacity of the material is ∼1000 mA h g−1, which is even greater than the theoretical capacity of Fe3O4. This extra capacity is mainly due to the non-faradaic reaction called the pseudocapacitance behaviour of the electro-active material across the metal/Li2O interface i.e. interfacial storage. Furthermore, a small contribution from the conductive additive (Super P) cannot be ruled out.69 The coulombic efficiency was also found to be very promising (97%) and maintained for up to 40 cycles. Thus, the novel synthesis of iron oxide mesoscopic particles using pulsed excimer laser yields an excellent anode material for LIB with high stability and high coulombic efficiency. After the electrochemical measurements the iron oxide powder was recovered by a magnet and the morphology was studied by HR-TEM. It was found that the morphology of the iron oxide powder remains intact even after several cycles of electrochemical measurements. The HR-TEM images of iron oxide powder after electrochemical measurements are shown in the ESI Fig. S2.†We acknowledge that several interesting experiments need to be followed to pursue this initial work further. These include the dependence of the final phase and morphology on the energy density and extended duration of processing, the concentration of the powder material in the solution, possibility of engineering novel morphologies of mixed oxides etc. These studies will form a part of our ongoing studies. Our preliminary studies indicate that beyond 5 h of processing, the rate of increase of the ratio of Fe3O4/α-Fe2O3 drops down gradually but considerably, implying that some kind of kinetic equilibrium is approached between the reducing power of the ammonia and a degree of dynamic oxidation due to the presence of water. Hence the process of complete conversion into Fe3O4, although possible, needs a much longer time. Changes in the powder concentration, the concentration of ammonia solution and laser energy density may change this equilibrium, but this would need much further optimization work. Experiments related to the energy density variation need focusing (convex lens) and defocusing (concave lens) of the laser beam to maintain a uniform energy density across the length of laser beam penetration. For the UV laser one can also use n-number of thin glass slides to cut the energy density progressively. We are currently performing these experiments.ConclusionsIn conclusion highly spherical iron oxide (mainly Fe3O4 with a small contribution of α-Fe2O3) particles having a size of around ∼200 nm were synthesized from bulk commercial α-Fe2O3 powder by pulsed excimer (UV, 248 nm) laser irradiation of the suspended powder in ammonia (reducing) solution. The high energy laser pulses (hν = 5 eV) create an extremely high local temperature of ∼12000 °C by transient laser heating of particles which allows the particles to melt and evaporate forming a micro-bubble reaction zone. Dissipation of the energy occurs by micro-bubble collapse through new bond formation and phase evolution. The presence of ammonia helps in the reduction of α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. Repeated laser pulses render the growth of bigger particles. In the final product obtained after about 5 h, 87% of Fe3O4 phase was found from the Mössbauer spectra, which was also consistent with the magnetization data. Importantly, the laser synthesized iron oxide particles showed a high specific capacity of 1100 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1. The rate performance measurements showed the high rate capability with high reversibility where the specific capacity of 530 mA h g−1 was observed, even at a current density as high as 1 A g−1. This capacity value was found to be highly stable up to 40 cycles without any significant capacity fading. The columbic efficiency of 97% was achieved with high stability and reversibility.AcknowledgementsAuthors MB and VT would like to thank the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) for fellowship support.
