    , Accepted 13th November 2020First published on 13th November 2020AbstractVisible-light driven reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) is a challenge in the photocatalytic reaction system. Herein, two Fe-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) with single-trimetallic clusters but distinct organic ligands were employed to explore the structure-dependent CO2 conversion performance. Compared with MIL-101(Fe), MIL-100(Fe) exhibits superior catalytic activity and selectivity for CH4 generation under visible-light irradiation via a solvent-free route. This is the first report that MIL-100(Fe) finishes the photoreduction of CO2 into CH4. Importantly, the plausible conversion pathways of the reaction were given by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work furnishes new direction for constructing MOFs to achieve CO2-to-CH4 conversion.
Introduction
Photoreduction of CO2 to high value-added products utilizing sustainable solar energy as the reaction impetus is a pursuable way to accomplish CO2 recycling, alleviating greenhouse effect and energy crisis.1–3 However, CO2 has high CO bond energy and CO2 photoreduction has to overcome such high energy barriers to dissociate the CO bond.4 Generally, the photon-assisted CO2 reduction process can produce a series of products from two-electron to eight-electron products.5,6 The eight-electron product of CH4 is the desirable hydrocarbon fuel in the photocatalytic system, but at the same time is harder to achieve than the two-electron products of formic acid (HCOOH) and carbon oxide (CO).7
Since Lin and co-workers reported that CO2 photoreduction was realized by incorporating ReI(CO)3(5,5′-cbpy)Cl into the framework of UiO-67.8 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), consisting of metal nodes and flourishing types of organic linkers, are considered as a type of promising photocatalyst for performance regulation.9–17 Furthermore, MOFs containing high-density metal nodes provide abundant coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (CUS) that have attracted considerable attention for potential redox activity.18,19 In addition, the flourishing types of multidentate organic ligands can be rationally designed and/or modified to regulate the catalytic performance.20–22 To date, the majority of studies on MOF materials have been reported with primary focus on HCOOH/CO production.23–29 Only limited MOFs present the selectivity for CH4 generation such as MOF-525, Zn/PMOF, NENU-605/606, NNU-13/14 and PCN-601.30–34 Undeniably, it is a challenge to develop the diversity of photocatalysts, which is remarkable and attractively promising for facilitating efficiency and selectivity of CO2 conversion into CH4.
Different series of MOFs with CUS and trimetallic nodes emerge in the MOFs such as MIL-88B(Fe), MIL-100(Fe, Cr), MIL-101(Fe, Cr), PCN-250 (Fe3, Fe2Mn, Fe2Co, and Fe2Ni), NNU-31 (Fe2Co, Fe2Ni, Fe2Zn).35–42 The trimetallic clusters with CUS make these MOFs as a charming platform for redox catalysis. For instance, trimetallic cluster-based PCN-250 (Fe3, Fe2Co, and Fe2Ni) exhibit superior reactivity towards CO2-to-CO transformation.41 The mixed-metal-containing MOFs of NNU-31 (Fe2Co, Fe2Ni, Fe2Zn) display excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance to achieve high efficiency for CO2-to-HCOOH conversion.42 Moreover, single-metal-based NH2-MIL-101(Fe) and NH2-MIL-88B(Fe) with amino-functionalized organic linkers display superior selectivity for conversion of CO2 to HCOOH or CO.25,29 MOFs with mixed-trimetallic clusters have been synthesized and thoroughly studied for catalytic reactions, thus revealing the relationship of the metal node composition on the catalytic performance.42–44 However, few reports reveal the relationship of the distinct ligands with single-trimetallic clusters on the photocatalytic performance,20,45–48 especially for CO2 photoreduction.
Herein, MOFs of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) with single-trimetallic clusters but distinct ligands were employed for studies on photocatalytic performance. These characters make MOFs as the desired platform to explore the impact of ligand on the catalytic reactivity and to uncover structure–performance correlation. The results confirm the superior reactivity of MIL-100(Fe) towards CO2 photoreduction into CH4. The CH4 production yield of MIL-100(Fe) exceeds at least 16.5 times of MIL-101(Fe). This is the first report that MIL-100(Fe) finishes photoreduction of CO2 into CH4. Furthermore, the plausible reduction pathways of the optimal photocatalyst were confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Experimental
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
All spin-polarized DFT computations were performed using Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) based on projector augmented wave (PAW) method.49–51 Electron–ion interactions were described using standard PAW potentials with valence configurations of 2s22p63s23d6 for Fe, 2s22p2 for C, 2s22p4 for O, and 1s1 for H.52,53 A plane-wave basis set was employed to expand the smooth part of wave functions with a cut-off kinetic energy of 480 eV. For electron–electron exchange and correlation interactions, the function parameterized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE),54 a form of general gradient approximation (GGA), was used throughout. Due to insufficient consideration of the on-site coloumbic repulsion, DFT might fail to describe the electronic structure of the MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe). To overcome this shortcoming, the GGA+U approach was used with U − J = 6.0 eV for Fe atoms.55 Since the unit cells of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) contain more than 10000 atoms, the calculation on such big systems was beyond the computational power of current supercomputers. Considering that the building block of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) is a super tetrahedral cell, which includes Fe3O(COO)6 trimers connected by BTC or BDC ligands, the active reaction center for MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) is 5-coordinated metal ions in trimers for adsorbing CO2. A finite-size cluster model Fe3O trimer, which is cut from the periodic structure, was adopted to approximate the structure. The Brillouin zone integrations were performed using the gamma-point only grid. When the geometries were optimized, all atoms were allowed to relax. Moreover, the atomic structures were optimized until the residual forces were below 0.02 eV Å−1. Gas-phase molecules were treated using the ideal gas approximation, whereas adsorbates were treated using a harmonic approximation. The DFT-calculated energy for CO2 was corrected by +0.45 eV,56 which is a usual adjustment to correct the overestimation by DFT. H2O was calculated under 0.035 atm. The relative free energies were calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model.57
The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of each reaction step is defined as the difference between the free energy of the reaction initiation and termination states, and the general formula is described as follows:ΔG = ΔEDFT + ΔEZPE − TΔSwhere EDFT is the electronic energy obtained from DFT calculations of the catalysts, ΔEZPE is the change of zero-point energy, and TΔS is the entropy contribution. Zero-point energies and entropies of photocatalytic CO2 reduction of intermediates were computed from vibrational frequencies.
Therefore, free energy changes compared to an initial state of gaseous CO2 free above an empty surface can be displayed by:ΔG[*COOH] = G[*COOH] + 7 × G[H+ + e−] − (G[*] + G[CO2] + 8 × G[H+ + e−])ΔG[*CO] = G[*CO] + G[H2O] + 7 × G[H+ + e−] − (G[*] + G[CO2] + 8 × G[H+ + e−])ΔG[*CHO] = G[*CHO] + G[H2O] + 5 × G[H+ + e−] − (G[*] + G[CO2] + 8 × G[H+ + e−])ΔG[*CO] = G[*CO] + G[H2O] + 7 × G[H+ + e−] − (G[*] + G[CO2] + 8 × G[H+ + e−])ΔG[CH2O] = G[*] + G[CH2O] + G[H2O] + 4 × G[H+ + e−] − (G[*] + G[CO2] + 8 × G[H+ + e−])ΔG[*OCH3] = G[CH3O*] + G[H2O] + 3 × G[H+ + e−] − (G[*] + G[CO2] + 8 × G[H+ + e−])ΔG[CH3OH*] = G[CH3OH*] + G[H2O] + 2 × G[H+ + e−] − (G[*] + G[CO2] + 8 × G[H+ + e−])ΔG[*OH] = G[*OH] + G[H2O] + G[CH4] + G[H+ + e−] − (G[*] + G[CO2] + 8 × G[H+ + e−])ΔG[CH4 + 2H2O] = G[*]+ G[CH4] +2 × G[H2O] − (G[*] + G[CO2] + 8 × G[H+ + e−])
Electrochemical measurements
Photocurrent measurements were performed on a CHI 730E electrochemical work station (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China) in a standard three-electrode system with photocatalyst-coated ITO as a working electrode, Pt plate as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. CH3CN solution of 0.1 M (n-Bu)4N(PF6) was used as an electrolyte. The as-synthesized sample (5 mg) was added into 20 μL Nafion and 2.0 mL ethanol solution, and the working electrode was prepared by dropping the suspension (200 μL) onto the surface of an ITO plate. The working electrode was dried at room temperature, and the photo-responsive signals of the samples were measured under chopped light at 0.5 V.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on the Zahner electrochemical workstation in a standard three-electrode system with the photocatalyst-coated carbon paper as a working electrode, Pt plate as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. A 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution was used as an electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared by dropping the ink (200 μL) onto the surface of the carbon paper. The working electrode was dried at room temperature, and then EIS measurements were performed with a bias potential of −0.5 V in the dark with a frequency range from 10−2 to 105 Hz under nitrogen atmosphere. The Mott–Schottky test was performed on the Zahner electrochemical workstation in a standard three-electrode system with the photocatalyst-coated glassy carbon as a working electrode, Pt plate as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. A 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution was used as an electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared by dropping the ink (50 μL) onto the surface of glassy carbon and dried at room temperature. The measurements were carried out with different frequencies of 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz.
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 experiments
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 experiments were carried out in a batch-type reaction system (CEL-SPH2N-D9, CeAulight, China) equipped with a homemade gas–solid reactor (Fig. S1†). The photocatalyst (2 mg) was uniformly dispersed into a circular glass-fibre membrane (0.22 μm pore diameter) with an illuminated area of about 2.8 cm2. The membrane is activated in vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the membrane was installed in the reactor with the distance from the light source to the sample was 11 cm and TEOA (2 mL) was added into the reactor. The reaction system was completely vacuumed and pumped with CO2 gas. A 300 W Xe arc lamp (Sirius-300P, Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd., China) with a 400–780 nm filter was used as the light source. The optical power density remained at 400 mW cm−2 measured by an optical power meter (CEL-NP2000-2, CeAulight, China). The gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-9860, Luchuang Instrument, China). 13CO2 isotopic labelling was determined using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Trace GC Ultra, ThermoFisher Scientific).
Results and discussion
MOFs MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) were synthesized and characterized in a conventional way (Fig. 1). The morphologies of as-prepared samples display monodispersed nanocrystals and present a typical octahedral-shaped morphology (Fig. S2†). The as-obtained samples reveal well-distinguished diffraction peaks that matched well with the simulated ones, which demonstrates the framework structures were successfully achieved (Fig. 2a and b).36,38 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to determine the composition and chemical environment of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe). From the survey scanning spectrum (Fig. S3†), the existence of Fe, C, and O can be found in both samples. The high-resolution spectra of Fe 2p of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are exhibited in Fig. 2c. Compared with MIL-100(Fe), the peaks of MIL-101(Fe) display tiny negative shifts, which indicates that the electron density on Fe3O clusters is enhanced.45 This result further confirms that the bridging ligands influence the local electron-density of metal nodes. The porosity of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 2d) with BET surface areas of 2147.6 and 3663.5 m2 g−1, respectively. Compared with MIL-101(Fe), MIL-100(Fe) displays higher absorption capacity (97.2 cm3 g−1 at 273 K) and larger adsorption enthalpy (39.4 kJ mol−1) for CO2 (Fig. S4–S6†), which indicates the relatively more robust CO2-framework interactions in MIL-100(Fe). The results imply that MIL-100(Fe) has kinetic advantages in CO2 transformation.58

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) was employed to evaluate the optical-response, and the results display that both samples have optical absorption covering the UV-visible region owing to the presence of μ-O-Fe clusters (Fig. 3a).59 The bandgap of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are identified to be about 2.65 and 2.08 eV, respectively (Fig. S7†). Mott–Schottky (MS) measurements were performed to determine the conduct band (LUMO) of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe). The positive slopes imply typical n-type semiconductor-like characteristics. The flat-band potentials of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are determined to be −0.98 and −1.04 V vs. normalized hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively (Fig. S8†). The potentials of these samples are more negative than the redox potential of CO2 to CO (−0.53 V vs. NHE) as well as to CH4 (−0.24 V vs. NHE); accordingly, these materials have capability for CO2 photoreduction. Moreover, to assess the separation efficiency of photo-excited charge carriers, photocurrent response was measured with the illumination of visible light. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, MIL-100(Fe) possesses higher photocurrent than MIL-101(Fe), which reflects that MIL-100(Fe) has more efficient interface charge separation. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for MIL-100(Fe) implies low resistance in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 3c) and indicates the fast interface charge transfer. Furthermore, the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay spectra suggests that the average PL lifetimes of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are calculated to be 0.46 and 0.25 ns, respectively (Fig. 3d). The prolonged lifetime further proves that the free charges in MIL-100(Fe) may transfer for more extended distance until recombination. On account of the efficient charge separation and prolonged charge lifetime, MIL-100(Fe) can be considered as a desired photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

Visible-light driven photoreduction of CO2 was conducted via a solvent-free reaction route utilizing triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent. As displayed in Fig. 4, two samples exhibit distinct yields of transformation CO2 to CO and CH4 in five hours under visible-light irradiation (Fig. S9† with calibration curves and Fig. S10†). To monitor the liquid products, 1H NMR spectral measurements were conducted, and no liquid product was detected in the catalytic process (Fig. S11†), which may be due to the employment of a solvent-free reaction system.26,29,31 Moreover, no H2 production was detected by gas chromatography (GC) during the whole catalytic process (Fig. S12†). Clearly, MIL-100(Fe) exhibits superior catalytic activity with CO and CH4 generation. Importantly, the MIL-100(Fe) achieves high selectivity of ∼98% for CH4 formation (relative to the total number of reacted electrons) (Fig. S13†). Furthermore, MIL-101(Fe) displays limited catalytic activity with CO and CH4 production. Thus, MIL-100(Fe) possesses superior selectivity and activity for CO2 conversion into CH4. In addition, solar-to-methane (CH4) conversion efficiency (η%) and apparent quantum efficiency (AQY%) over MIL-100(Fe) are 0.023% and 0.943%, respectively. Note that MIL-100(Fe) gives high AQY compared with the MIL-101(Fe) and reported heterogeneous photocatalysts (Table S1†). To further illustrate the photocatalytic activity, the turnover frequencies (TOF) of these catalysts were determined by the amount of metal active sites, and corresponding TOF values of these photocatalysts are displayed in Fig. 4a.

To verify the carbon origins of the target products of CO and CH4, 13C-labeled 13CO2 was applied for the photocatalytic test. The reaction products 13CO and 13CH4 were confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. S14†), which ensured that both goal products resulted from CO2 reduction. To further explore the photocatalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe), we compared the photocatalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe) with additional catalysts (Fig. 4a) such as MIL-100(Cr, Al), MIL-88B(Fe) and MIL-53(Fe). All samples exhibit weak photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the constituents of MIL-100(Fe), which include iron net and BTC, give an insignificant photocatalytic effect (Fig. 4), and thus indicate the importance of the MIL-100(Fe) skeleton for photocatalytic reactions. According to a previous work,29 NH2-MIL-101(Fe) possesses a superior selectivity for conversion of CO2 to CO. More importantly, the order of CH4-yield is MIL-100(Fe) > MIL-101(Fe) > MIL-88B(Fe) > NH2-MIL-101(Fe). Furthermore, the order of CO-yield is NH2-MIL-101(Fe) > MIL-101(Fe) > MIL-88B(Fe) > MIL-100(Fe) (Table S2†). These results demonstrate that the photocatalytic performance of Fe-based MOFs was improved by changing organic ligand with identical Fe-oxo clusters. In addition, the different performances of these photocatalysts may be attributed to their unique framework structures. MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe)/NH2-MIL-101(Fe) possess uniform Fe-oxo clusters and four μ3-O-bridged Fe3O clusters together constitute a tetrahedron as structural unit (Fig. S15†). For MIL-101(Fe) or NH2-MIL-101(Fe), terephthalate (BDC) or amino-substituted terephthalate (NH2-BDC) ligands as the edge of the tetrahedron connect Fe3O clusters, while for MIL-100(Fe), tricarboxylate (BTC) ones as the facets of tetrahedron coordinate with the Fe3O clusters. Comparatively speaking, the structural unit of MIL-100(Fe) is more closely arranged than the one of MIL-101(Fe) or NH2-MIL-101(Fe) (Fig. S16†), in which the closely packed tetrahedron structure is conducive to the migration of electrons. Furthermore, MIL-100(Fe) has greater Fe3O cluster density than MIL-101(Fe) within the same photocatalytic area (Fig. S17†), in which the CO2 photoreduction occurs. As for MIL-88B(Fe) with the triangular bipyramidal arrangement of five Fe3O clusters (Fig. S18†), the structure unit is loosely arranged and results poor photocatalytic activity compared with MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) with tetrahedral structural unit. More significantly, the electrophilicity of coordinated organic ligands follows the order: NH2-BDC < BDC < BTC, and MIL-100(Fe) displays a more efficient inter-cluster delocalization.45,60 Hence, the excellent photocatalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe) can be attributed to the closely arranged structural units, BTC with high electrophilicity and the further reduced electron-density of the Fe3O clusters. Furthermore, a series of control tests were conducted in the vacuum or dark or without photocatalyst or TEOA. The target products were undetectable in these catalytic systems (Table S3†). Importantly, the photostability of MIL-100(Fe) was evaluated using recycling experiments. As shown in Fig. S19,† MIL-100(Fe) exhibits the long-term photocatalytic stability after multiple uninterrupted cycles. The corresponding SEM image, PXRD pattern and XPS spectra after the photocatalysis are shown in Fig. S20–S22.† The post-catalyst retained the octahedral morphology after multiple photocatalytic tests, except that its surface became rough. These results demonstrate that the morphology, crystalline-structure and oxidation state of MIL-100(Fe) have no noticeable alteration, which confirms the structural robustness.
DFT calculations were performed to get further insight into the CO2-to-CH4 reaction process.4,61–63 The computations were carried out by assuming concerted proton–electron transfer at 0 V vs. RHE. The Gibbs free energy diagrams of the reaction pathways are illustrated in Fig. 5, the formation of *COOH on MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) are endothermic processes with energy barriers of 1.906 and 2.005 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the formation of *COOH is considered as the rate-determining step for both catalysts. The *COOH intermediate can react with a proton–electron to form *CO, which is connected with the Fe–O clusters. Subsequently, the protonation reaction of *CO can produce two potential intermediates: *CHO or *COH. The relative potentials between *CO and *COH are too high to be realized. This fact indicates that the *CHO intermediate is preponderant in this step. From Fig. 5, the reaction processes of *CHO to CH4 are thermodynamically favorable, except that the reduction process of CH2O(g) to *OCH3 is required to meet energy demands. Therefore, the optimal reaction path for CO2-to-CH4 on MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) follows CO2 → *COOH → *CO → *CHO → CH2O(g) → *OCH3 → *CH3OH → *OH → CH4(g). The stable structures, which correspond to the optimal reaction path, are displayed in Fig. S23 and S24.† Between these samples, the ΔV of the corresponding endothermic processes on MIL-100(Fe) is lower than that on MIL-101(Fe) (Table S4†), which demonstrated that the MIL-100(Fe) would be a more efficient photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. Moreover, the CO temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurement was employed to reveal the CO desorption process on the photocatalyst surface (Fig. S25†). The results suggest that the strong interaction between CO and MIL-100(Fe) can efficiently prevent CO to escape from the Fe–O clusters, which benefits for further hydrogenation of CO to generate CH4. This result is in agreement with the photocatalytic experiment, in which MIL-100(Fe) shows superior selectivity and reactivity for CO2-to-CH4. The choice of CO, HCHO and CH3OH feeds was based on the calculational results that all of them may constitute reactive intermediates of the catalytic process.33,61,64 Therefore, taking the optimal catalyst of MIL-100(Fe), the photocatalytic experiment under CO, HCHO, and CH3OH were separately applied as feed reactants (Fig. S26†); the result proved that CO, HCHO, and CH3OH are the intermediates for CH4 formation, which is in line with the DFT predictions.

On the basis of the above results, a possible reaction pathway of visible-light-driven CO2 photoreduction over MIL-100(Fe) was proposed. Compared with MIL-101(Fe), MIL-100(Fe) not only possesses superior CO2 adsorption capacity because there are more interaction sites on the surface, but also displays acceleration of electron transfer owing to the closely packed structure units. In addition, the flat-band potentials of MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) satisfy the thermodynamic demand for CO2 transformation into CH4. Upon visible-light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons migrate to the surface of the catalysts, where the adsorbed CO2 captures electron to form *COOH. Then, adsorbed COads may form after proton–electron coupled-reactions with *COOH. The strong interaction between COads and MIL-100(Fe) can prevent CO to escape from the photocatalyst surface, confirmed by the fact that only a small amount of CO was detected in the products, which is favorable for further hydrogenation of COads to generate CH4. With the combined advantages, the COads on the surface of MIL-100(Fe) would be more efficiently converted into CH4 than those on MIL-101(Fe). As a result, MIL-100(Fe) exhibits outstanding photocatalytic performance with remarkable selectivity toward CH4.
Conclusions
In summary, the Fe-based MOF MIL-100(Fe) exhibits superior reactivity for CO2 photoreduction compared with MIL-101(Fe). More importantly, MIL-100(Fe) achieves outstanding activity and high selectivity for CH4 formation. Moreover, the ligand variations could influence the local electron-density of metal nodes, the structural unit of the frameworks, and further a high capacity density of Fe3O clusters with MIL-100(Fe) can accelerate the migration of photogenerated electron holes to improve the efficiency of the catalytic reaction. Finally, the DFT calculations give the optimal reaction pathways from CO2 to CH4 catalyzed by MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-101(Fe) and further unveil the relationship between structure (bridging ligand and metal clusters) and performance (CO2 photoreduction). Thus, this work will open windows to construct various high-activity photocatalysts by precisely modulating the composition of metal clusters and organic ligands.
