    , Accepted 19th March 2014First published on 21st March 2014AbstractAttapulgite (ATP), not only as a type of natural and low cost silicate clay mineral but also as a high quality nanosized material with large surface area, layered and lath-like structure, has been found to have a wide variety of industrial applications. The ideal composition of ATP is Mg5Si8O20(OH)2(OH2)4. However, according to previous reports from different countries in the world, it is very important for our research that the actual composition of ATP varies because of partial replacement of magnesium by aluminum, iron, titanium and other elements. Herein, we have successfully used this dye sensitized clay mineral (raw and purified) to effectively reduce water for hydrogen generation under visible light irradiation. Further chemical analysis as well as computational simulation (CS) proposed that the natural Fe-doping (two ATP crystal cells sharing one Fe atom) can promote the photocatalytic process.
1. Introduction
During the past four decades, numerous active photocatalysts for water splitting have been synthesized and investigated.1,2 Continuing breakthroughs have been made in the development of novel photocatalysts, especially during the past two decades.3–7 Photocatalytic systems for hydrogen generation typically consist of a photosensitizer (PS), an electron relay, a sacrificial electron donor, and a catalyst. When PS molecules absorb photon energy, they inject electrons into the conduction band of a semiconductor catalyst. The electrons are consumed by reduction of water at a catalytic particle to form hydrogen, while the oxidized sensitizer molecules are regenerated by accepting electrons from a donor molecule.8 However, favorable charge recombination reactions tend to be much faster than the slow multielectron processes of water reduction. Therefore, figuratively speaking, the hydrogen production is a battle between the rate of forward electron transfer and the reverses.9
Dye sensitization is a powerful strategy to enable the visible light harvesting of wide band gap semiconductors.10,11 As a highly absorbing organic PS, Eosin Y (EY) dye which sensitizes wide band gap semiconductors has been under intensive research for 30 years.12,13 Dye sensitized TiO2 was also able to generate hydrogen by photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation.14 In contrast to the numerous reported artificially synthesized active photocatalysts, the number of reports employing natural materials as photocatalysts is still very scarce. Most recently, our group15 discovered that CdS-sensitized attapulgite (ATP) (a natural silicate clay) as a photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation (the maximal quantum efficiency was 8.2% at 420 nm). Besides this ATP silicate, we also found other silicates (e.g. vermiculite with graphene-like morphology) which have a strong ability to split water due to their natural Fe-doping.16 This work focuses on photocatalytic hydrogen production via water reduction by using a natural silicate-based mineral (ATP) photocatalyst suspension with a sensitizer (EY) under visible light irradiation in the presence of an electron donor (TEOA) (10.8% apparent quantum efficiency). There have been efforts made to establish a research area of silicate-based minerals for hydrogen generation based on physical chemistry measurements as well as theoretical calculations.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of Ag-modified ATP
All the reagents used in this work were of AR grade obtained from the Shanghai Chemical Factory of China and were used without further purification. Raw (main impurity: quartz, see Fig. S1, ESI†) and purified ATP (free of impurity) were obtained from Xuyi of Jiangsu Province in China. In a typical synthesis of Ag–ATP nanocomposites, purified ATP (0.15 g) was added to the mixed solution of oleylamine (5 ml) and octadecene (2.5 ml) at 170 °C and stirred for a few minutes under N2. Then, AgNO3 (0.02 g) was injected to the above solution. After stirring for 10 minutes, ethanol was added and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation.
2.2. Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX, EDAX Genesis 2000) spectroscopy were performed on a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope operating at 200 kV, by depositing a drop of the sample dispersion onto 300 mesh Cu grids coated with a carbon layer. The purified ATP was characterized by XRD on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Ruili UV-1201 spectrophotometer. The photocurrent was measured on an electrochemical system (Chenhua CHI-660B). The visible light (λ > 450 nm) was obtained using a 300 W Xe lamp with a 450 nm cut-off filter to completely remove any radiation below 450 nm. XPS analysis were acquired on an ESCALAB MKII with Mg Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV) as the excitation source.
2.3. Photocatalytic tests
Typically, reactions were carried out in a closed gas-circulation system. A 300 W Xenon lamp (XL-300, Yirda Co. Ltd) was used as the light source, and visible light irradiation was realized by attaching a 450 nm cutoff filter. 0.1 g of catalyst was dispersed in an aqueous solution (200 ml) containing triethanolamine (TEOA) (5%, v/v) as the sacrificial electron donor and EY (8 × 10−5 mol) as the PS. The system was evacuated several times prior to irradiation. The evolved hydrogen was analyzed using online gas chromatography (GC-1690, Jiedao, TCD, Ar carrier).
The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) was measured under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions. A model 1916-R Newport power meter was used for the measurement of light intensity. The QE plotted were estimated by using several cut-off filters, and were calculated on the basis of the number of the incident photons in each wavelength region. Accordingly, each value is plotted in the middle of two cut-off wavelengths. The QE was calculated according to eqn (1): (1) The TON (turnover number) was calculated according to eqn (2): (2)
2.4. Fabrication of photoanodes of ATP
In detail, 2 mg of ATP was suspended in 1 ml ethanol under ultrasonic treatment. Then, the slurry was then coated onto a 2.0 cm × 1.0 cm indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrate by drop casting. The photoelectrochemical properties were investigated in a conventional three-electrode cell using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI-610B, Shanghai Chenhua, China) and the prepared samples as the working electrodes, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as a reference electrode. The light source was a 300 W Xe lamp. Linear sweep voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in a 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution. The scan region was 0.0–0.5 V (the surface area coated ATP is 1 × 1 cm2).
2.5. Theoretical calculation details
The electronic structure calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). In all calculations, the ion–electron interaction was described using the projected augmented wave (PAW)17,18 method and the exchange–correlation functional was PW9119 based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The convergence threshold was set to be 10−5 eV in energy and 10−3 eV Å−1 in force.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of samples
ATP clay mineral usually contains about 60–80% ATP while the impurities include quartz, montmorillonite, sepiolite, calcite and dolomite.20,21 We used ATP raw mineral powder and purified ATP (Fig. 1a and b, also see XRD measurement in Fig. S1, ESI†) sensitized by organic dyes, to reduce water for hydrogen generation under visible light irradiation. The detailed experimental and theoretical calculation processes are listed in the experimental section. Its layered structure can be found in Fig. 1c. Furthermore, ATP is usually characterized by high surface area (up to 200 m2 g−1)20,21 and shows a strong ability to adsorb nanoparticles (Fig. 1d) and molecules.

The purified ATP powder is amber-colored (Fig. 2a, inset), suggesting that it can absorb visible light. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum in Fig. 2a shows strong semiconductor-like absorption in the UV region as well as intrinsic and wide absorption in the visible region. In order to enhance the visible light photocatalytic ability, some organic dyes as visible light irradiation sensitizers have attracted great attention for water reduction as well as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC).22 We have tested four organic dyes under the same experimental conditions, and found that all of them have reduction ability (Fig. S2, ESI†), while EY (Fig. S3, ESI†) is the best. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum in Fig. 2b shows EY adsorbed to ATP. Compared with the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of purified ATP (Fig. 2a), the absorption at visible wavelengths steeply increases, in which the main absorption band of EY is at around 500 nm (ref. 23) and the band gap is estimated to be 2.4 eV.

3.2. Photocatalytic hydrogen production
For five samples sensitized by EY shown in Fig. 3a, all ATP samples have a better reduction ability than titania P25. The comparisons, as shown in samples 2, 3 and 4, imply that the photocatalytic reduction ability results from purified ATP only, while the impurities (about 40%) in the mineral have no role in this function. In addition, the hydrogen generation rate reaches the highest value of 137 μmol h−1 in noble metallic loading. This Ag-loading promotion is similar to a large number of previous investigations.24

Hydrogen evolution as a function of time during a 5-day testing period of visible light driven hydrogen production experiments using Ag-modified ATP composite and bare ATP as the photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 3b. Measurements were conducted for 5 consecutive days. Each day the sample was irradiated for 9 hours and then stored in the dark overnight before testing the next day. Continuous hydrogen evolution with no noticeable degradation of the Ag-modified ATP as well as bare ATP samples was clearly observed from the beginning of the reaction. The total evolution of hydrogen after 45 h was 6000 μmol (Ag-modified ATP) and 4500 μmol (bare ATP). The results indicate excellent stability of the present materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production.
Measurement of the photocurrent shown in Fig. 3c displays a high response from ATP, suggesting that the bare ATP with coinciding photonic and electronic band edges exhibited a large current output and high optoelectronic conversion efficiency. To perform an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction, the rate of electron transfer to the catalyst should be fast relative to back electron transfer to the sensitive dye or electron donor.9

Fig. 4 shows the apparent quantum efficiency (QE) of water reduction by the photocatalyst with EY as a function of the wavelength of the incident light. The trend of QE matches well with that of absorption in the optical spectra, and the QE reached the highest value of 10.8% at 483 nm and a turnover number of 312 was obtained. A control experiment showed that indeed no reaction took place in the dark.

By contrast, we could not get any hydrogen when replaced ATP with montmorillonoid which is another silicate with similar composition (absence of Fe) under the same conditions. XPS analysis of ATP and montmorillonoid was also carried out to examine the oxidation state of Fe (Fig. 5). Two distinct peaks at binding energies of ca. 710.7 eV and ca. 724.8 eV are observed in the high resolution spectrum of Fe 2p (Fig. 5a, inset). The two peaks can be indexed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2,25 which is characteristic of Fe3+ in ATP. However, we could not get any peak as shown in the inset of Fig. 5b (montmorillonoid).

Fig. 6 shows the effect of increased concentration of EY on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of bare ATP under visible light irradiation. The photoactivity increases upon increasing the EY concentration, and reaches a maximum at about 4.0 × 10−4 mol L−1. With further increase in EY concentration beyond 4.0 × 10−4 mol L−1, the hydrogen production rate significantly decreases. To explain this behaviour, it is thought that only the fraction of the EY sensitizer adsorbing on the photocatalyst surface is photocatalytically active, directly leading to electron injection into the photocatalyst conduction band.26

3.3. Discussion of the photocatalytic mechanism
For this dye-sensitized semiconductor photocatalytic system, the mechanism of hydrogen generation is illustrated in Fig. 7. EY with Eg = 2.4 eV (Fig. 2b) and 0.89 V (Eoxvs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE))24 is a fascinating PS for hydrogen production.13 This similar charge separation in a dye–semiconductor (e.g. TiO2, ZnO etc.) system has been investigated extensively before.24 However, there are two key scientific descriptions for Fig. 7. One is that Fe-doping results in a great lowering of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) levels of ATP and a new level (VB1) insertion, which is from computational simulation (CS)7,27 which is shown in Fig. 8 and 9. The other is fixation of EY energy levels. In Fig. 7, it can be observed that the valence band maximum (VBM) of EY is more negative than the VBM of ideal ATP potential, because the EY has a stronger electron-loss tendency than ideal ATP (σ-type electrons) due to π-type electrons in the EY molecule (Fig. S3, ESI†). According to the chemical principle, in general, the σ-type electron has a higher stability than the π-type electron. Thus, the NHE value (right line) corresponding to the energy value (left line, and from CS7,27) is also fixed, resulting from 0.89 V Eoxvs. NHE of EY. Besides, another evidence for the judgment is that the conduction band minimum (CBM) level of the Fe-doping ATP is more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (0 V vs. NHE).

The mechanism shown in Fig. 7 is obtained from explorations in Fig. 8 and 9. The ideal composition of ATP is Mg5Si8O20(OH)2(OH2)4. However, according to previous reports from different countries in the world, it plays a determining role in our research that the actual composition of ATP varies because of partial replacement of magnesium by aluminium, iron, titanium and other elements.20,21,28 Indeed, Fe-containing compounds have been used extensively in the area of photoelectrochemical water reduction;29,30 we and other researchers21,28 indicated that the purified ATP from China or overseas contains element Fe of about 3%, meaning two ATP crystal cells sharing one Fe atom. Thus, by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),31 we optimized the purified ATP structure Mg5Si8O20(OH)2(OH2)4 (Fig. 8a) according to ref. 21 and the Fe-doped structure Mg4.5Fe0.5Si8O20(OH)2(OH2)4. Since two ATP crystal cells share one Fe atom, the computational calculation extent refers to two crystal cells. By comparison of three different structures in which Fe is doped in different sites, the most stable structure with lowest total energy is determined, as shown in Fig. 8b. Based on the above optimized structures, we calculated the materials band structure, as shown in Fig. 9.
It is well known that the band gap theoretical calculations have worked well for determining band gaps.7,27 In Fig. 9, it can be seen that there is a very wide Eg of about 5 eV and a high CB level in ideal ATP, while the Eg of semiconductors being suitable for water reduction is around 3 eV.24 However, after Fe-doping the ATP levels are lowered greatly and an inserted level (VB1) is generated, leading to absorption of visible light by ATP (VB1 → CB), which is in rough agreement with the real spectrum shown in Fig. 2a. So the computational calculations shown in Fig. 8 and 9 are in good agreement with Fig. 7. The results of EDX elemental analysis for raw and purified ATP are displayed in Fig. 10. The elements C and Cu are from the sample supporter of TEM observation, and other elements including O, Si, Mg, Al and Fe are all from ATP. Remarkably, Fig. 10(b) confirms existence of Fe, and about 3% of the content is estimated within the error of EDX. In the computational calculations, we neglect Al-doping. Namely it is proposed that Al atomic function is the same as Mg atom. In addition, the contents of titanium and other elements in purified ATP are too low to be considered.

Based on the above results and our previous study,15 the mechanism of hydrogen evolution over the EY-ATP photocatalyst is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 11. In the presence of EY, a photosensitization mechanism is proposed. In aqueous solution, EY molecules absorb light to form the excited state of *EY. Electrons released from *EY are transferred to the CB of ATP for the water reduction reaction. After sensitization by EY, dramatically enhanced hydrogen evolution activity was observed due to the extended light absorption and efficient charge transfer from EY to ATP.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have found a convenient and cheap route to hydrogen generation. In this way, no (or very small) artificial treatments including chemical synthesis, doping and nanoparticle morphology control are needed at all. So this research made good use of properties of ATP, for example its nanosized, large surface area, layered, lath-like structure etc. For exploring unknown properties of ATP and other Fe-containing silicate clays, although the mechanisms for water reduction might be too complicated to be understood very clearly, it should be related to some ingredients inside ATP. Our present mechanism concerns partial replacement of magnesium by iron and has been verified by experiment and computational calculations.
