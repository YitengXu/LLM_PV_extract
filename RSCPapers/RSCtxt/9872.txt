        Eu3+-doped transparent glass ceramics containing In2O3 nano-crystals were prepared by melt quenching and subsequent heating. X-ray diffraction analysis, transmission electron microscope observation, and photoluminescence excitation spectra demonstrated that In2O3 nano-particles sized 3–6 nm homogenously distributed among the glass matrix. Under excitation of these nano-particles, Eu3+ luminescence was found greatly enhanced due to the energy transfer from the oxygen-vacancy-related defects of In2O3 to Eu3+ ions. The Eu3+ content dependent energy transfer efficiency was evaluated, and the value reached 67% for 1 mol% Eu3+ doped glass ceramics. Low temperature emission spectra demonstrated that the Eu3+ ions of the glass ceramic locate mainly in the glass matrix.
1. Introduction
Rare earth (RE) ions are visible to near-infrared ultra-narrowband emitters with long luminescence lifetimes, and thus have wide applications in many fields such as solid laser, display and optical amplification.1,2 Unfortunately, their optical cross sections are usually rather small, typically on the order of 10−21 cm−2, owing to the forbidden intra-4f transitions. Several attempts have been performed to improve the emission efficiencies of the RE ions. Among them, co-doping of the semiconductor nano-crystals is discovered to be an effective route.3–6 Due to the efficient band-to-band absorption, the excitation cross sections of semiconductors are very high, which is suitable for harvesting energy from absorption of photons and subsequently transfer this energy to the RE ions. Several authors5,7,8 reported the energy transfer between the RE ions and the ZnO, SnO2 or In2O3 nano-crystals embedded in the sol–gel SiO2 matrix, and the enhanced luminescence of RE ions benefited from such energy transfer. However, because of the ineluctable large amount of OH− residual that are effective in quenching the luminescence, the optical quality of the sol–gel silica is usually very poor.9,10 In addition, the mechanical performance of the sol–gel monolithic material is not suitable for practical applications. Other types of optical composites, e.g., the RE-doped SiO2 matrices containing Si nano-crystals prepared by co-sputtering or ion-implantation, exhibited efficient energy transfers from Si to RE ions.11–12 However, thermal quenching, a fatal drawback for optical applications, emerged in these materials due to the small indirect band gap of Si semiconductor.8,13,14
To fabricate the SiO2-based bulk composite containing semiconductor nano-crystals potentially applicable as the luminescent medium, the route based on melt quenching might be a desirable alternative. The materials thus prepared may exhibit not only large absorption cross section owing to the efficient sensitization of the wide band gap semiconductors, but also high chemical and mechanical stabilities of the oxide glass. In this paper, the Eu3+-doped glass ceramics containing the wide band gap semiconductor In2O3 nano-crystals as the sensitizer were produced by melt quenching and subsequent heating. The energy transfer between In2O3 nano-crystals and Eu3+ ions, and the related luminescence properties were investigated.
2. Experimental
The compositions of the materials are as following: 18Na2O-10CaO- 12Al2O3-57SiO2-xIn2O3 (in mol%; x = 0 and 3.0, respectively), where SiO2 acts as the glass-former, Na2O and CaO are the network-modifier and the flux, and Al2O3 takes the role of the network-intermediate. The doped Eu3+ ions, with content of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mol% respectively, were introduced by adding appropriate amount of Eu2O3. The glasses were prepared by melting a mixture of reagent grade chemicals in aluminium crucible at 1520 °C for 1 h in the ambient atmosphere. The melt was poured into a 300 °C pre-heated copper mould and then cooled to room temperature. The obtained bulk precursor glasses were then cut into 4 cm2 square coupons and heat-treated at 680 °C for 2 h to proceed crystallization of the In2O3 nano-phase and form the glass ceramics. The prepared precursor glasses and glass ceramics were fully transparent.
To identify the crystalline phase, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out with a powder diffractometer (DMAX2500) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The microstructures of the samples were studied using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010) operated at 200 kV. TEM specimens were prepared by dispersing fine power grinded from bulk sample in ethanol, followed by ultrasonic agitation, and then depositing onto a carbon enhanced copper grid. The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, under the excitation of a xenon lamp (450W) equipped with a grating monochromator, were recorded by a PMT detector (R928). For spectroscopic measurements, all the finely surface-polished samples with the same geometry of 2 × 2 × 0.5 cm3 were placed perpendicular to the excitation light.
3. Results and discussion

XRD curves of the Eu3+-free samples containing In2O3 component are displayed in Fig. 1a. The precursor glass is amorphous without any sharp peaks. After crystallization, the XRD pattern exhibits several diffraction peaks assigned to the cubic In2O3 phase (PDF 71-2195). The mean grain size was evaluated to be about 6 nm by Scherrer formula. TEM observation on the crystallized sample demonstrates that some near-spherical In2O3 particles sized 3–6 nm distribute homogeneously among the glassy matrix, as shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrograph, presented in Fig. 1b, confirms the crystalline nature of these In2O3 particles. Fig. 1d is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern taken from the HRTEM image of an individual nano-crystal shown in Fig. 1c, presenting the diffraction pattern of the cubic In2O3 along the [01] zone axis.

The PL and PLE spectra of the Eu3+-free glass ceramic containing In2O3 nnao-crytals were exhibited in Fig. 2. The PL spectrum under 310 nm excitation (the dash-dotted line in Fig. 2b) shows a unique broad green emission band centered at 525 nm. As a comparison, no emission band was detected under the same experimental conditions for the Eu3+-free sample without In2O3 nano-crystals, indicating that the green emission band is assigned to the In2O3 nano-crystals. Some authors have reported photoluminescence of the nano-scaled In2O3 originating form the oxygen deficiencies.15,16 In present work, the thermal crystallization of the In2O3 nano-crystals in the glass matrix is probably accompanied by the generation of oxygen vacancies,17 therefore, the green emission might be ascribed to the carrier recombination between the valence band (VB) and the oxygen vacancies–induced donor levels formed in the midst of the In2O3 band gap.18–20 On the PLE spectrum (the dash-dotted line in Fig. 2a) monitored at the wavelength of 525 nm, there is a broad excitation band of the In2O3 nano-crystals with a maximum at 310 nm (corresponding to 3.98 eV). The band gap of 3.98 eV is wider than that of the bulk In2O3 (3.6 eV), ascribing to the quantum confinement. Using the effective mass theory,21 the In2O3 nano-crystlas size of 4.5 nm was calculated, which is in consistent with the TEM and XRD results. The following parameters were used in the calculation:22 me (effective electron mass) = 0.3 m0 (free electron mass), mh (effective hole mass) = 0.6 m0, and ε (dielectric constant) = 9.

The PL spectra of the 0.1 mol% Eu3+-doped samples with and without In2O3 nano-crystals, under 305 nm excitation, are presented in Fig. 2b. The characteristic peaks from Eu3+ ions are clearly observed in both spectra, while an additional broad green emission band ascribing to In2O3 nano-crystals emerges in that of the sample with In2O3 nano-crystals. Significantly, under the same experimental conditions, the intensity of the Eu3+ dominant peak at 614 nm in the sample with In2O3 nano-crystals is approximately 20 times higher than that of the sample without In2O3. To study the sensitization of In2O3 nano-crystals on Eu3+ ions, the PLE spectra monitored at the Eu3+ dominant emission of 614 nm were measured and provided in Fig. 2a. The sample without In2O3 shows the typical Eu3+ direct f–f excitation peaks, while that with In2O3 nano-crystals exhibits an additional broad excitation band centered at 310 nm which is similar to the one for the In2O3 green emission. Apparently, the remarkable intensified emission of Eu3+ in the glass ceramic containing In2O3 nano-crystals is originated from the energy transfer from In2O3 nano-crystals to Eu3+ ions.
To get more information on the energy transfer between In2O3 nano-crystals and Eu3+ ions, the emission spectra of the In2O3 nano-crystals contained glass ceramics doped with various content of Eu3+ were recorded, as shown in Fig. 3. The excitation wavelength of 310 nm was adopted in order to permit merely the excitation of In2O3 nano-crystals while avoid the direct excitation of Eu3+. It is noticed that, in spite of the drastic change in the intensity, the position of the emission is almost independent of Eu3+ content, implying that the size of In2O3 nano-crystals is almost not affected by Eu3+ doping because the emission wavelength of the In2O3 nano-crystals is very sensitive to their size.16 Obviously, the emission of In2O3 weakens monotonically with increasing of Eu3+ content, while that of Eu3+ intensifies at first in the range from 0.5 to 2.0 mol%, and then turns to be weakened when Eu3+ content further extends to 4.0 mol%. Based on these results, the emissions of In2O3 nano-crystals and Eu3+ ions, and a possible mechanism for the energy transfer between In2O3 and Eu3+ are schematically illustrated by a simple diagram shown in Fig. 4. The UV excitation light is absorbed by the In2O3 nano-crystals, and promotes the electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. The electrons are then trapped by the defect states (oxygen vacancies) via the non-radiative decay. The recombination of electrons in the defect states with holes in the valence band induces the green emission centered at 525 nm. Alternatively, for the sample doped with Eu3+, a part of the recombination energy transfers to the Eu3+ ions to promote their electrons from the ground state to the excited ones, which generates the Eu3+ emission via the radiative relaxation. With increasing of Eu3+ content, the amount of energy transferred from In2O3 to Eu3+ increases, resulting naturally in the intensification of Eu3+ emission and the quenching of In2O3 emission. However, for the sample with too high Eu3+ content, the Eu3+ emission turns to be weakened due to the Eu3+ concentration quenching.

The energy transfer efficiency (ηET) is defined as the ratio of donors that are depopulated by energy transfer to the acceptors over the total number of donors being excited. By dividing the mean lifetime of the In2O3 green emission in the Eu3+-doped glass ceramic to that in the Eu3+-free one, the energy transfer efficiency can be obtained: (1)where τ denotes the mean decay lifetime, and x%Eu stands for the Eu3+ concentration. The mean lifetime τx%Eu of the emission band centered at 525 nm, ranging from 156 ns to 473 ns, depends on the Eu3+ doping concentration (the corresponding decay curves are shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). The calculated energy transfer efficiency, plotted as a function of Eu3+ content in Fig. 5, enhances from 27% to 67% as Eu3+ content increases from 0.1 mol% to 1.0 mol%. In addition, the mean lifetime of the Eu3+5D0→7F2 transition in the 1.0 mol% Eu3+ doped glass ceramic is about 2.0 ms (the corresponding decay curve is shown in the inset of Fig. S2, ESI†), which is larger than that of Eu3+ doped in the sol–gel SiO2 glassy matrix containing In2O3 nano-crystals (about 1.0 ms),8 possibly due to the absence of OH− in our sample.

In order to clarify the location of Eu3+ ions in the glass ceramics, the low temperature Eu3+ emission spectra under excitation at different wavelengths, for the 0.1 mol% Eu3+-doped samples with and without In2O3, were measured at 10 K, as exhibited in Fig. 6. The line shapes of the Eu3+ emission peaks are almost identical in two samples, indicating the similarity of the Eu3+ configuration environments in these samples, i.e., Eu3+ ions in the glass ceramic located mainly in the glass matrix. Such localization of Eu3+ ions have also been reported in the sol–gel silica matrix containing CdS or ZnS quantum dots.23,24

It is worthy to mention that, with the spectrum modification feature, i.e., absorbing UV irradiance and releasing the harvested energy by re-emitting visible light that the silicon solar cells have much higher spectral response,25 the Eu3+-doped transparent glass ceramics containing In2O3 nano-crystals may find potential application in enhancing the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the silicon solar cells, especially those used in the space.26
Conclusions
The Eu3+-doped transparent glass ceramics containing In2O3 nano-crystals were fabricated by melt quenching and subsequent heating. The energy transfer from In2O3 nano-crystals to Eu3+ ions was demonstrated by the comparative analysis on the PLE and PL spectra of the samples with and without In2O3. The energy transfer efficiency increased remarkably with Eu3+ content, and reached 67% for the 1.0 mol% Eu3+-doped glass ceramic. The Eu3+ luminescence at 614 nm in the sample with In2O3 nano-crystals was about 20 times stronger than that in the sample without In2O3. Based on the results, a possible mechanism of the energy transfer was proposed.
