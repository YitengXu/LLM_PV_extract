    , Accepted 23rd December 2015First published on 23rd December 2015AbstractMechanisms of charge transport between the interconnector and its neighboring layers in tandem organic photovoltaic cells have been systematically investigated by studying electronic properties of the involving interfaces with photoelectron spectroscopies and performance of the corresponding devices. The results show that charge recombination occurs at HATCN and its neighboring hole transport layers which can be deposited at low temperature. The hole transport layer plays an equal role to the interconnector itself. These insights provide guidance for the identification of new materials and the device architecture for high performance devices.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have attracted much interest due to their potential as a renewable and clean energy source with merits of low cost, light weight, compatibility with large area and flexible substrates and ease of fabrication.1–8 Nevertheless, before commercialization, tremendous efforts are still needed for further improving their performance and stability. For enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), different approaches including the development of new photoactive materials, morphological control of films, as well as interface engineering for effective charge collection and device fabrication processes have been used.1–13 With these efforts, the PCE of a single bulk heterojunction (BHJ) based OPV device has reached 9%.8 Meanwhile, it is still challenging to achieve a PCE of over 10% with a single P–N junction due to the intrinsic properties of materials, such as low mobilities and a narrow absorption bandwidth.3,4,14 One approach to overcome the limits from intrinsic material properties is to stack multiple subcells into a tandem OPV device.2,6,12,15,16,21,24
To fully exploit the potential of tandem OPV devices, it is important to balance charge transfer between the neighboring cells via a suitable connecting layer(s).6,17–19 So far several types of connecting layer(s) including thin metal layers of Ag nanoclusters, doped organic P–N bilayers, metal oxides etc. have been investigated.2,6,12,17,19,20,22,23 In particular, the use of transition metal oxides (TMOs), such as molybdenum trioxide (MoO3),22 tungsten trioxide (WO3),17 and vanadium oxide (V2O5), has drawn much attention because of their merits of high work functions and high optical transparencies over the visible region. However, the deposition of metal oxides often requires higher deposition temperatures and in contrast, organic materials with similar properties to metal oxides can also be suitable candidates for application as connecting layers. On the other hand, despite the recent progress in tandem solar cells with different connecting layers, their underlying physics is still not fully understood.
In this work, we employed Li-doped 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BPhen) and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HATCN) as connecting bilayers. Detailed electronic structures and the energy level alignment between the bilayer and its neighbouring layers are systematically characterized with ultraviolet and X-ray photoemission spectroscopies (UPS and XPS). Corresponding devices were also fabricated for studying the effects of the connecting layer on device performance.
Experimental
All the UPS and XPS measurements were carried out in a VG ultrahigh vacuum photoemission spectroscopy system equipped with a fast entry air lock (base pressure 1 × 10−7 Torr), a multiport carousel chamber (<5 × 10−10 Torr), an evaporation chamber (<5 × 10−10 Torr) and an analysis chamber (<2 × 10−9 Torr). Indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were thoroughly cleaned and UV ozone treated for 20 min before loading into a surface analysis system. Organic materials were in situ evaporated in steps onto the ITO substrates inside the deposition chamber at a pressure of 1–2 × 10−9 Torr. The film thickness and the deposition rate were monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance and kept at a growth rate of 1–2 Å s−1. A freshly prepared sample was transferred into the analysis chamber after each deposition step for photoelectron spectroscopy studies without vacuum break. A He-discharge lamp (21.22 eV) and a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray (1486.6 eV) sources respectively were used for the UPS and XPS measurements. For the UPS measurements, a bias of −5.0 V was applied for collecting secondary electrons. The position of the Fermi edge (EF) was determined with a freshly sputter-cleaned Au foil.
All corresponding OPV devices were prepared on patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 20 Ω sq−1. The ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned with Decon90, acetone, ethanol, deionized water and then oven-dried and finally treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. The substrates were then loaded into a vacuum deposition chamber with a base vacuum better than 2 × 10−6 Torr. Deposition rates and film thicknesses of different layers were monitored with an oscillating quartz crystal. Device architectures of the single and tandem cells are listed in Table 1. In the tandem OPV devices two individual subcells are connected serially with connecting layers of various structures. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a computer controlled programmable keithley model 2612 power source in the dark and under AM 1.5 solar illumination from a Newport 150 W solar simulator. Illumination intensity was measured using a calibrated Oriel radiant power meter.

Results and discussion
Electronic structures of the HATCN-based ICs

Fig. 1 shows the evolution of He I UPS spectra of the SubPc/HATCN interface as a function of the SubPc overlayer thickness on the HATCN substrate. The bottom spectrum was recorded from a 5 nm thick HATCN film deposited on Li:BPhen coated ITO substrates. The edge of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of HATCN, estimated by a linear extrapolation at the low binding energy (BE) side of the HOMO peak maximum, is located 3.6 eV below the EF, which is in good agreement with previous reports. Taking into account a transport gap of 3.8 eV,25,26 the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the HATCN layer was pinned slightly above the EF and exhibits a typical n-type semiconducting property.26–29 Upon deposition of SubPc the second electron cutoff rapidly shifts to a higher binding energy region. The shift of the secondary electron cutoff in the high BE region indicates a vacuum level (VL) shift of 1.1 eV. The peak position of both the HOMO and the VL shows no further shift as the thickness of SubPc further increases. This indicates the formation of an interface dipole upon initial contact of SubPc and HATCN. In addition, neither new peaks nor gap states can be observed in the spectra, suggesting that there is no chemical interaction at the interface.

For comparison, He I UPS spectra of SubPc deposited on Li:BPhen are shown in Fig. 2. The bottom spectrum corresponds to the 100 Å thick Li:BPhen layer on ITO substrates. In good agreement with previous reports,30,31 two gap states with an energy difference of 1.6 eV can be observed in the forbidden energy gap of BPhen due to the doping of Li. The HOMO and LUMO positions were determined at 3.9 and 6.1 eV respectively. As evident from Fig. 2, a progressive shift of the second electron cut off toward the low binding energy region can be observed as the thickness of SubPc increases. Gradual shifts of about 1.5 eV in VL and 0.5 eV in the HOMO position indicate that there is band bending and/or an interface dipole at the Li:BPhen/SubPc interface. Similar energy shifts were also observed in XPS measurements (not shown here).

To get a better understanding of functions of different connecting layers, the BPhen/SubPc interface was also characterized. Fig. 3 shows the He I UPS spectra obtained upon incremental deposition of SubPc on BPhen. It can be noted that spectral evolution at the SubPc/BPhen interface is similar to that of the SubPc/Li:BPhen interface. The LUMO of SubPc pins at the Fermi level due to the low work function of BPhen layers.

Fig. 4 displays the UPS spectra of a 100 Å-thick SubPc layer deposited on HATCN, BPhen, Li:BPhen substrates respectively. No new peaks can be observed in all cases indicating that chemical actions are weak or absent in these interfaces. On the other hand, two different types of interface formation are observed in these samples. The VL shifts to a low BE region upon deposition of SubPc on BPhen and Li:BPhen underlayers, indicating the formation of an interface dipole and energy level bending. In contrast, there is no evidence of energy level bending formation at the HATCN/SubPc interface.

Energy level alignment of HATCN-based Ics
Based on the results from UPS and XPS measurements, corresponding energy level diagrams are schematically illustrated in Fig. 5 for Li:BPhen/HATCN/SubPc, BPhen/HATCN/SubPc, Li:BPhen/SubPc and BPhen/SubPc interfaces on ITO substrates respectively. Here, the HOMO edges of the organic layers were extracted from the UPS spectra, and the LUMO positions were estimated by taking into account the charge transport gaps (4.2 eV for BPhen, 2.0 eV for subPc and 3.8 eV for HATCN) relative to the HOMO energy levels.28,33,34 The Fermi level of the underlying ITO substrate in a thermal dynamic equilibrium state was chosen as the energy reference. The contributions of the interface dipole and energy level bending to the VL shift at the interfaces were determined by taking into account the core level shifts extracted from XPS measurements (not shown here).

According to the energy level diagrams of the connecting layers with neighbouring HTL and ETL layers displayed in Fig. 5, the impact of the connecting layers can be understood. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the LUMO of SubPc is pinned at the Fermi level upon its deposition on BPhen and Li:BPhen substrates. These interfaces lead to large energy level offsets between the HOMO of SubPc and the LUMO of BPhen or Li:BPhen's LUMO. These built in potentials are in the opposition direction to the photogenerated potential of the two neighbouring cells. It is thus expected that tandem devices using no or a Li:BPhen connecting layer would have Voc smaller than the sum of the Voc of the two sub-cells.
In contrast, when HATCN is used as the connecting layer, the energy offsets between the HOMO of SubPc and the LUMO of HATCN is much smaller, suggesting that a p–n junction is formed at the SubPc and HATCN interface. Therefore, it is expected that the charge conduction and recombination process can easily occur at the HATCN/SubPc interface. In addition, according to the previous reports, the voltage drop here can be neglected due to the smaller energy level offset at the interface, Consequently, the Voc of the device with Li:BPhen/HATCN as an interconnector will be the total of the two single cells under operation.
Influence of interconnectors on device characteristics
To verify the above analysis, corresponding tandem OPV devices with different connecting layers were fabricated. The structures of the devices are shown in Table 1, however, the devices without interconnectors were also fabricated for comparison. Fig. 6 shows the J–V characteristics measured under simulated AM1.5G solar illumination at an incident intensity of 100 mW cm−2. It is clear that connecting layers can critically influence the device characteristics. With a Li:BPhen connecting layer, the tandem OPV shows the worst performance, indicating that a few excitons dissociated and contribute to the photocurrent. According to the energy alignment in Fig. 5c, it is easy to understand that the excitons can transport to the Li:BPhen film with no barrier and lead to lower photocurrent. If BPhen is inserted between the first cell and interconnectors, the tandem OPV shows a better performance, suggesting that excitons blocked from the first cell contribute to the performance enhancement. However, as shown in Fig. 6, the tandem OPV with BPhen/Li:BPhen/HATCN shows a similar J–V curve to single devices, indicating that only one cell works under operation. This is precisely the contradiction to our above analysis, the Voc of the device with Li:BPhen/HATCN as an interconnector should be the total of the two single cells under operation.

It should be noted that in Fig. 5a, both SubPc and HATCN have deep HOMO position due to the properties of the materials itself. The energy offset between HATCN'LUMO and SubPc'HOMO is about 1.2 eV. Although the offset between HATCN and SubPc is smaller than the interface without HATCN layers, the value here maybe still larger for charge recombination. Charge recombination becomes better upon further decreasing the offset. To prove our view, MoO3 and CoPc which have a lower HOMO level were chosen respectively and the corresponding devices and interface were studied.

Fig. 7 shows the energy level alignment of the HATCN/MoO3/SubPc and HATCN/CoPc interface. It is clear that there is about 1.2 eV shift of the vacuum level after the deposition of MoO3 on HATCN substrates, the HOMO of MoO3 is located at 2.8 eV below the EF level; it is similar to our previous work.32 It should be noted that, unlike the HATCN/SubPc interface, when there is SubPc deposition on MoO3, large band bending and an interface dipole exist at the interface, the energy level offset between MoO3 and SubPc decreases to 0.6 eV. In contrast, hole and electron recombination will be easier at the interface. As shown in Fig. 7b, the energy level offset decreases to 0.45 eV if we change SubPc to CoPc, implying that the energy level can be tuned by choosing suitable materials. In order to prove our view, the corresponding devices using MoO3 as an interlayer between HATCN and SubPc were also fabricated; the device structure and the J–V curve are shown in Table 1, 2 and Fig. 6.

As shown in Fig. 6, when MoO3 is used as the interconnector, the device shows the largest Voc, which is nearly twice that of the single device. According to previous results30 indicating that BPhen/Li:BPhen/HATCN/MoO3 can effectively electrically connect two subcells for holes and electrons which are generated from the top and bottom cells recombination. According to the energy level alignment in Fig. 5a and the MoO3/SubPc interface in Fig. 6a, the contribution of MoO3 to the largest Voc can be easily understood. The incorporation of MoO3 between HATCN and SubPc facilitates the hole transport from SubPc to HATCN due to the small barrier. It should be noted here that all the tandem devices with no optical space layers, film thicknesses and donor materials were not optimized, so the unbalanced optical absorption and mismatched photocurrent lead to a lower short circuit current.
Conclusions
In summary, the effects of charge transport for tandem OPVs have been demonstrated by systemically investigating the interfacial electronic structures and corresponding devices. Characteristics of internal interfaces were estimated by UPS and XPS measurements to get the energy level alignment. The energy level alignment and J–V characteristics of the devices clearly show that interconnectors with BPhen/Li:BPhen/HATCN/MoO3 can realize efficient electrical connection in series for tandem OPVs. The use of HATCN and MoO3 plays an important role in the efficiency enhancement, which facilitates the charge transport into neighbouring recombination layers. The present work provides a new insight into charge transport and recombination in tandem OPVs and it is beneficial to choose new materials and device structures for high efficient tandem OPVs.
