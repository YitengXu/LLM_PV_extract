    , Accepted 14th November 2018First published on 14th November 2018AbstractThe use of hot carriers generated from the decay of localized surface plasmon resonance in noble metal nanoparticles is a promising concept for photocatalysis. Here, we report the enhancement of photocatalytic activity by the flow of hot electrons on TiO2 nanotube arrays decorated with 5–30 nm Au nanoparticles as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. This enhanced photocatalytic activity is correlated to the size of the Au nanoparticles, where higher oxygen evolution was observed on the smaller nanoparticles. Conductive atomic force microscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the Schottky barrier between Au and TiO2, which reveals a reduction in the Schottky barrier with the smaller Au nanoparticles and produces an enhanced transfer of photoinduced hot carriers. This study confirms that the higher photocatalytic activity was indeed driven by the hot electron flux generated from the decay of localized surface plasmon resonance.
1. Introduction
Because of the unique optical properties associated with the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), nanostructures based on noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively studied within the field of photocatalysis over the past decade (e.g. photodegradation of organic pollutants, solar water splitting).1–5 The LSPR effect occurs when metal electrons absorb incident photons with a specific energy and resonate on the surface of the NPs. From LSPR decay, large fluxes of highly excited (hot) electrons and holes can be generated that can then transfer into the adsorbed molecules and induce chemical transformations.6,7 The following mechanisms were proposed to explain LSPR-induced photocatalytic reactions: (i) efficient scattering of light,8 (ii) near-field electromagnetic enhancement in the vicinity of metal NPs,9,10 and (iii) the creation of energetic (hot) carriers via Landau damping.11 Despite numerous studies, determining the dominant reaction mechanism caused by LSPR in a particular system is a difficult task because of the extremely fast nature of the above processes, some of which persist for only a few femtoseconds.
By incorporating metal NPs in nanoporous TiO2, Tian and Tatsuma found that the mechanism for the LSPR-induced transfer of hot carriers can be studied using metal–semiconductor (MS) contacts.12 Since then, many studies have shown that hot electrons (or holes) created from LSPR excitation influence the photocatalytic activity for water splitting.13–15 However, practical applications of MS contacts in photocatalysis are still limited because of the low excitation efficiency of hot carriers. Therefore, a detailed study of the roles of various parameters of plasmonic NPs (e.g. composition, size, and shape) is extremely important. In particular, the size of the NPs incorporated in the plasmonic MS contacts is important for determining the photocatalytic efficiency because it affects both the wavelength at which LSPR occurs16 and the efficiency of the charge separation process.14,17–20 The electrical properties of MS contacts may also change when the size of the metal NPs is varied. For example, Reineck et al. demonstrated that the quantum efficiency of photocurrent generation in plasmonic solar cells depends on the size of the Au nanoparticles.17 However, the cause of this size-dependent quantum efficiency is still poorly understood.
Thus, we focus here on photocatalytic water splitting under visible light illumination, mediated by the injection of hot carriers in TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) decorated with Au NPs. Specifically, we investigated the effect of the size of the Au NPs on the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on quantum efficiency measurements, we show that the contribution of hot carriers to photocatalytic water splitting depends strongly on the electronic properties of the Au NPs, which can be effectively tuned by selecting different sizes of NPs. We also studied the electronic structure of the MS Schottky contacts at the Au/TiO2 interface using conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The efficiency of hot carrier injection into the MS contacts is higher when the Au NPs are smaller. This effect is attributed to a reduction of the Schottky barrier. Moreover, smaller NPs will increase the total length of the perimeter (compared with larger NPs with the same coverage) and provide an enhanced flux of hot carriers over the Schottky barrier.
2. Experimental
Fabrication of Au/TiO2 nanotube arrays
Vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) were synthesized by anodization of Ti foil in a two-electrode configuration using a method described earlier.21 First, pristine Ti foil (50 μm, Nilaco) was sonicated sequentially in acetone, ethanol, and then deionized water for 15 min each. The Ti foil was then dipped into an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol (17 M, 99.8% Sigma-Aldrich), water (1.2 M), and ammonium fluoride (NH4F, 0.87 M, Junsei). The electrolyte was stirred vigorously for at least 30 min until all residues completely disappeared. Electrochemical anodization was carried out at 70 V for 30 min with 3 cm between the Ti foil and the stainless-steel electrode under ambient conditions. Since the anodization process is accompanied by the release of heat, the beaker was kept in a cold-water bath. After anodization, the freshly prepared TNAs were washed with DI water, dried with N2, and annealed at 450 °C for 2 h (ramp rate 2 °C min−2). Citrate-stabilized Au NPs were synthesized following a controlled seeded-growth strategy.22,23 Water was used as the solvent in all the reactions, while sodium citrate acted as both the capping reagent and the reducing agent. In a typical preparation for the synthesis of the 5 nm Au NPs, 100 ml of HAuCl4·3H2O (1 mM) was heated to 100 °C with vigorous stirring in a 250 ml round-bottom flask. 10 mL of sodium citrate (38.8 mM) was injected rapidly into the gold precursor solution. After 20 s, the mixture changed from yellow to bluish gray and then to burgundy and was heated for another 10 min. At the final stage, the mixture was stirred for 15 min and finally cooled until the temperature of the solution reached 90 °C. 1 ml of sodium citrate was then injected to complete the synthesis. After calcination, the TNA substrate was immersed in an aqueous suspension of monodisperse, citrate-stabilized Au nanoparticles (5, 15, or 30 nm in diameter) and the sample was kept in a 60 °C oven until dry. The samples were then washed thoroughly with deionized water and then dried with a gentle N2 stream.24,25 At the final stage, the sample was annealed in air at 200 °C for 1 h. To control the amount of deposited gold, this procedure was repeated for the required length of time. The gold-decorated TiO2 substrate was connected to a copper wire using a silver conductive paste and dried overnight. Both the substrate and the wire were then covered with an insulating epoxy resin, leaving only the desired surface area of the sample exposed. For AFM and UPS, Au NPs on TiO2 substrates were fabricated. A film of TiO2 (n-type) was deposited on a SiO2/Si substrate using e-beam evaporation. After deposition, the TiO2 film was annealed by heating at 485 °C for 2 h 30 min at ambient pressure. The ohmic contact was then fabricated by successive deposition of Ti and Au films on the TiO2 surface. Finally, freshly prepared Au NPs were dispersed on the surface of the nanodiode using drop casting.
Characterization of morphological and electronic properties
The morphology and composition of the Au NPs@TNAs samples were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (Magellan-400, Nova230) and transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai F20 and Titan cubed G2 60–300). The XPS measurements were performed under ultra-high vacuum (10−10 Torr) using a VG Scientific Sigma Probe system equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.3 eV). To characterize the optical properties of the colloidal Au nanoparticles in solution and after deposition on the TiO2 nanotube arrays, a UV–vis–near-infrared spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV3600) was used. These spectra were obtained from the transmission/reflection measurements %A = 100 − (%T + %R), where A, T, and R denote the absorbance, transmittance, and reflectance, respectively. To measure the UV-visible light, 1 μm of Ti atoms were deposited onto the quartz at a rate of 0.5 Å s−1 using an e-beam evaporator (A-TECH system). This Ti-deposited quartz was then anodized under conditions identical to the other samples. The measurements were carried out under ambient conditions (30–40% relative humidity and 23–24 °C) with a commercial AFM system (Agilent 5500). Cr/Pt-coated Si cantilevers (ContE-G model, Budget Sensors) were used with a spring constant of 0.2 N m−1 (radius < 25 nm) and a resonant frequency of 13 kHz for conductive AFM. The normal force was kept constant during the scan; the current and topography images were taken at the same time. The photoemission spectroscopy (PES) experiments were performed with a focused X-ray beam (130 eV) at the 8A2 (high-resolution X-ray PES) beamline in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). The 8A2 beamline covers the photon energy range of 100–1600 eV with a typical photon flux of 1011–1012 photons per s. The Fermi level is located at E = 0 eV, measured from the Fermi edge of the evaporated Au film. To observe the secondary electron cutoff, work function measurements were also carried out. The sample was biased by −5.0 V to acquire the distinct secondary-electron cutoff and valence band spectra.
Photoelectrochemical characterization
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a multi-channel potentiostat (VersaSTAT 3, Princeton Applied Research). The electrochemical system consisted of three electrodes. A platinum coil and Ag/AgCl/KCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A single-compartment quartz cell filled with 1 M KOH electrolyte was used as the reactor. The LSV measurements were performed using an applied potential from 0 to 2.0 V vs. RHE with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The measured potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were converted to the RHE scale according to the Nernst equation ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.197. A 150 W xenon lamp (Model 10500, ABET Technology) was used as the light source. For the photoresponse under visible light, the photoelectrodes were irradiated using a 150 W xenon lamp with a cutoff filter (optical cutoff filter wavelength >415 nm). A monochromator (Mmac 200, Dongwoo OPTRON) was used for the IPCE measurements. The light intensity was calibrated using a Si photodiode (Bunkokeiki). The faradaic efficiency was measured using a sealed three-electrode electrochemical reactor. Before the measurements, the reactor was filled with 1 M KOH solution and was then purged several times and back-filled with ultrapure argon (5 kPa). The evolved gases were analyzed using an online gas chromatography system (DS Science with a thermal conductivity detector, MS-5A column, and argon as the carrier gas) during the chronoamperometric measurements with an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE. The gas concentration was analyzed by auto-sampling every 3 minutes. The faradaic efficiency was determined using the equation  where nO2 (experimental) is the number of moles of oxygen produced during the OER, nO2 (theoretical) = Q/NF where Q is the charge passed through the electrodes, N is the number of transferred electrons (four moles of electrons per mole of O2), and F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-synthesized TNAs. The average diameter and length of the TNAs were estimated as 100 nm and 1.0 μm, respectively. The TNA length was chosen because the maximum penetration depth of light in TiO2 nanotubes is about 2.0 μm.26 Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the size distribution of the Au NPs on the top surface of the TNAs. The average diameters of the NPs are 5, 15, and 30 nm. For all the NPs, the size distribution is quite narrow. According to the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1b), a fraction of the Au NPs is deposited on the inner surface of the nanotubes and is in contact with TiO2. This may be the result of a substantial electrostatic interaction that tethers the Au NPs to the TiO2 surface, thus allowing charge transfer following the formation of a Schottky contact. The HRTEM image in Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows that the Au NPs are in close contact with the inner porous wall of the TiO2 nanotube. In particular, Fig. S2b (ESI†) shows that the Au NPs are inserted into the TiO2 surface. The HRTEM image of the 5 nm Au NP attached to the inner surface of the TiO2 nanotube (Fig. 1c) reveals that both the Au NPs and TiO2 are in the crystalline state. The plane spacing determined from the image is 0.2 nm for Au (200) and 0.32 nm for TiO2 (101). The information on the amount of Au NPS on the TNAs for the different particle sizes was obtained by atomic weight percent from energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Table S1, ESI†). The Au NP loading for each NP size is different to ensure that the illuminated area of the Au NPs is identical. To determine the composition and chemical state of the Au NPs and TiO2 samples, XPS was used. The Au 4f spectra from the Au NPs show characteristic Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 lines at 83.5 and 87.2 eV (Fig. 1d) respectively, which indicates that the as-deposited Au NPs are in a metallic state. In comparison with bulk metallic gold (84 eV), the Au 4f7/2 line is shifted down by 0.5 eV, which is explained by electron transfer between the Au NPs and TiO2.27 Electron transfer from TiO2 to the Au NPs occurs because of the difference between the positions of the Fermi levels in Au and TiO2, which results in upward band bending for TiO2.28 According to Fig. 1e, a positive shift of 0.25 eV in the Ti 2p3/2 line is observed when the TNAs are decorated with Au NPs, which provides additional evidence for the above phenomenon.29 As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal the anatase crystalline phase of the Au NPs@TNAs samples with characteristic low-intensity (111), (200), and (220) planes at 40.1, 44.6, and 64.1 degrees, respectively. To investigate the optical properties of the TNAs decorated with Au NPs, diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra were obtained. All measurements were performed on samples placed in an electrolyte solution, as used for photocatalytic studies. As shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†), the absorption spectra of isolated Au NPs have a characteristic band associated with LSPR excitation. The position of the absorption maximum is size dependent and located at 520, 524, and 528 nm for the 5, 15, and 30 nm Au NPs, respectively. It is well known that there is a red spectral shift with increasing Au nanoparticle size.30,31 The UV–vis absorption spectra of the Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes are shown in Fig. S4b (ESI†), which were obtained from both transmission/reflection, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Decorating Au NPs on TNAs can induce a red shift compared with that of Au NP colloid solutions. Such red shifts may be caused by the different dielectric constants of the surrounding environment.32,33

(f) Schematic of the Au NPs@TNAs photoanode and working principle of the photoelectrochemical cell. 
The working principle of a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell utilizing a Au NPs@TNAs photoanode is shown schematically in Fig. 1f. Incident light excites the hot electrons and holes in the Au NPs because of the LSPR effect. Hot electrons overcome the Schottky barrier at the Au/TiO2 interface and flow into the cathode (Pt wire) where they react with H+ ions to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (4H+ + 4e− → 2H2↑). Hot holes, in turn, stay in the photoanode and participate in the oxygen evolution reaction (2H2O + 4h+ → O2↑ + 4H+) if their oxidizing potential is sufficient for water oxidation.
The as-prepared Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes were tested for photoelectrochemical water splitting under simulated solar irradiation by visible light (light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with AM 1.5G filter, 415 nm cutoff filter) in a conventional three-electrode reactor using a 1 M aqueous KOH solution. Fig. 2a shows a set of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for pristine TNAs and Au NP-decorated TNAs, measured within the applied potential window of 0–2 V vs. RHE. These results show that the maximum photocurrent density achieved with the 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs photoanode (Au loading is 1.29 wt%) under visible light (λ > 415 nm) is 0.14 mA cm−2 at an applied potential 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is almost 2 times higher than that for the 30 nm Au NPs@TNAs photoanode under similar conditions. The photocurrent density measured from the 15 nm Au NPs@TNAs photoanode is quite close to that of the 30 nm Au NPs@TNAs photoanode. In turn, the photocurrent density measured from the bare TNAs is negligible. To investigate the instant photoresponse for the Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes, chronoamperometric (I–t) curves were recorded at 1.23 V vs. RHE under chopped light illumination (λ > 415 nm). As shown in Fig. 2b, all the photoanodes exhibit excellent sensitivity to illumination without any signs of photoinduced charging effects.

(b) Chronoamperometric measurements at 1.23 V vs. RHE under chopped light illumination (λ > 415 nm). (c) Photoconversion efficiency as a function of the applied potential. (d) A comparison of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of the Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes with different sizes of NPs. 
The measured photocurrent densities are consistent with the values obtained from the LSV measurements. The photoconversion efficiency (η) of water splitting when an external bias is applied can be calculated as η = I(1.23 − Vapp)/Plight where Vapp is the applied external bias vs. RHE, I is the externally measured current density, and Plight is the power density of the incident light. As shown in Fig. 2c, the maximum photoconversion efficiency for the 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs photoanode shows a 46-fold increase in comparison with bare TNAs under visible light (λ > 415 nm). Fig. 2d shows the photocurrent density measured under white light and visible light illumination from photoanodes decorated with different sizes of Au NPs. As expected, bare TNAs are unlikely to be active under visible light, but show a marked increase in photocurrent density when Au NPs are deposited on the TNAs. The PEC performance increases as the Au NPs decrease in size. Despite the significant increase in the photoconversion efficiency of the TNAs after decoration with Au NPs, an excessive amount of gold loading can lead to a drop in the photocurrent because the gold blocks light access to the surface of the photoanode. This also reduces the contact area between TiO2 and the electrolyte and prevents the transfer of photoinduced hot holes into the electrolyte, which is necessary for the OER.34 To find the optimal loading, 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes with 0.5, 1.3, 2.7, and 4.8 wt% loading were prepared. TEM images show that even at high loading, the Au NPs are evenly distributed over the inner surface of the TiO2 nanotube (Fig. S6, ESI†). The photocurrent of the Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes with different Au loadings recorded under white light and visible light illumination are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). As can be seen, the highest photocurrent density is achieved on the sample with 1.29 wt% Au loading.
To estimate the contribution of hot electron injection in photocatalytic water splitting, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed in a three-electrode reactor. The IPCE values at specific wavelengths were calculated using IPCE = (hc·I)/(λ·Jlight) where I is the photocurrent density, Jlight is the irradiance at a specific wavelength, λ is the wavelength of the incident light, h is the Planck constant, and c is the speed of light. As shown in Fig. 3a, the photocurrent dominates the IPCE because of light absorption in TiO2 for all the samples. However, the gold- plated TNAs exhibit a marked increase in photoactivity under UV light compared with the bare TNAs. This is particularly noticeable for the 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes for which the IPCE at λ = 390 nm is twice as high as that for the bare TNAs. Additionally, the increase in the IPCE for the Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes decreases as the size of the gold NPs increases. As recently demonstrated,26,35,36 the increase in the IPCE of plasmonic Au/TiO2 electrodes under UV light may be associated with a reduced recombination rate for the photoinduced hot electrons and holes, which is a consequence of the passivation of trap sites on the TiO2 surface. Indeed, in accordance with the mechanism for PEC water splitting described above, photoinduced hot holes should diffuse to the TNAs/electrolyte interface to participate in the OER. In this case, some of the hot holes are inevitably lost because of recombination with hot electrons in trap sites located on the TNA surface, thus reducing the efficiency of the PEC reaction. Au NPs, when deposited on the TiO2 surface, could passivate the trap sites and reduce the loss of hot holes to the recombination process.35 To investigate the presence of trap sites on the surface of the TNAs, photovoltage decay was measured. Y. Pu et al. demonstrated a photovoltage experiment showing that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2 decorated with Au NPs in the UV region could be attributed to effective surface passivation of the Au NPs.35 As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the total decay lifetimes obtained by fitting the V–t curves to a biexponential function are 0.27, 0.49, 0.63, and 0.68 s for the 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs, 15 nm Au NPs@TNAs, 30 nm Au NPs@TNAs, and bare TNAs, respectively. The procedure for calculating the lifetime is described in detail in the ESI.† The rapid decay (total half lifetime) of Au NP/TiO2 suggests that the deposition of Au NPs could possibly remove surface trap states and reduce the loss of holes via recombination.26,35

(b) APCE, IPCE, and corresponding absorption values at λ = 537 nm calculated for the bare TNAs and Au NPs@TNAs electrodes with different sizes of Au NPs. (c) H2 and O2 evolution from Au NPs@TNAs electrodes in 1 M KOH under an AM 1.5G solar simulator at 1.23 V vs. RHE. (d) Measured and calculated faradaic efficiency for the 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs electrode. 
As shown in Fig. 3a, the Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes show a significant increase in the IPCE under visible light (λ = 400–750 nm). According to the absorption spectra shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), this region matches well with the absorption peaks corresponding to LSPR on the Au NPs. Therefore, this increase in the IPCE can be attributed to the generation of hot carriers from LSPR decay. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, the greatest increase in the IPCE is observed for the smallest NPs. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. S4b (ESI†), the light absorption efficiency is higher in the larger NPs (the results are normalized with respect to surface coverage of the Au NPs). Thus, the absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE), calculated at λ = 537 nm, demonstrates a clear tendency to increase as the Au NP size decreases (Fig. 3b). The APCE value for the 5 nm Au NPs is 3.92 times greater than that for the 30 nm Au NPs.
To confirm the mechanism for PEC water splitting, the gas released from the reaction was measured directly. Fig. 3c shows that the evolution of H2 and O2 occurs in a stoichiometric ratio, which coincides with the overall reaction equation, and is approximately the same for all the Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes when irradiated with visible light. As expected, the rate of O2 evolution on the as-prepared electrodes decreases in the following order: 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs (11.4 μmol h−1 cm−2) > 15 nm Au NPs@TNAs (8.0 μmol h−1 cm−2) > 30 nm Au NPs@TNAs (6.2 μmol h−1 cm−2). As shown in Fig. 3d, the faradaic efficiency for both gases is higher than 95%, indicating that the charge generated on the 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs photoanode is almost fully consumed by the water oxidation reaction. A slight deviation from 100% faradaic efficiency might be caused by dissolved oxygen participating in the reverse reaction and inevitable gas leaks from the experimental apparatus. Detailed information on the calculation of the faradaic efficiency is given in the Experimental section.
The rapid separation of photoinduced electrons and holes by the electric field of a Schottky barrier is a decisive process that affects the overall efficiency of PEC reactions.28,37 Therefore, studying the properties of the MS contact between Au NPs of different sizes and TNAs is an important part of this work. Kraya et al. demonstrated that the transfer of an electron between Au and SrTiO3 undergoes a transition from being controlled predominantly by thermionic emission to being largely controlled by tunneling electron transfer when the Au/SrTiO3 contact is smaller.38 Also, Lee et al. recently reported that the Schottky barrier height in Au islands/TiO2 diodes with a nanoscale interface is somewhat lower than that of macroscopic Au film/TiO2 diodes because of image-force and tunneling effects.39 To characterize the Schottky barrier at the interface between different sizes of Au NPs and TiO2, we used C-AFM. A schematic diagram of the C-AFM measurements is shown in Fig. 4a. For the measurements, the Au NPs@TiO2 structure formed a Schottky nanodiode (see the Experimental section). In such a structure, the Schottky barrier acts as a hot carrier filter, which allows the separation of ground-state and excited electrons such that only a hot carrier with sufficiently high energy can be injected into the conduction band of TiO2. Current–voltage (I–V) spectroscopy was carried out on the Au NPs (marked by a cross in the topographic image, see Fig. 4b) while I–V curves were measured for biases from −1 to 2 V (see Fig. 4c). To determine the Schottky barrier height, the I–V curves were fitted to the thermionic emission equation40 (1)where A is the area, A** is the effective Richardson constant, T is the temperature, q is the elementary charge, kb is the Boltzmann constant, φb is the Schottky barrier height, η is the ideality factor, and Rs is the series resistance. Typical results for fitting the experimentally measured I–V curves to the thermionic emission equation are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†).

(b) Topography image showing 50 nm Au NPs on TiO2 using contact-mode AFM. (c) I–V curves measured from the Au NPs/TiO2 nanodiodes with different sizes of NPs. (d) Schottky barrier height as a function of Au NP diameter. 

Fig. 4d shows the Schottky barrier height as a function of Au NP size, measured on the Au NPs@TiO2 nanodiodes. The lowest value of the Schottky barrier (φb = 0.52 eV) was measured on the nanodiode decorated with 23 nm Au NPs. As the size of the Au NPs grows, the height of the Schottky barrier increases (Table S2, ESI†). As discussed in ref. 41, such variation in the Schottky barrier with NP size might be the result of an increase in the local electric field at the interface between the NPs and the semiconductor, which can improve the tunneling properties of the MS contact. Therefore, as the Au NP size decreases, the electric field and following band bending would be higher at the edge of the interface, resulting in an increased charge flow through the interface between Au and TiO2.
To further study changes to the Schottky barrier at the Au/TiO2 interface as a function of Au NP size, UPS measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. S10a (ESI†), the energy level of the valence band in the 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs is slightly shifted to a lower binding energy compared with the sample decorated with 30 nm Au NPs. This energy level can be characterized by a larger number of mobile electrons around the Fermi level, which leads to a significant reduction in the barrier height.42 Similar results were also recently obtained by Cheng et al. for Au clusters on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4).43 As shown in Fig. S10b (ESI†), the cutoff of the secondary electron emission from the 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs is also negatively shifted by 0.12 eV relative to the 30 nm Au NPs@TNAs. Thus, together with the above-described data for the C-AFM measurements, these results indicate that the properties of the Schottky barrier at the Au/TiO2 interface can be controlled by changing the size of the Au NPs. Smaller NPs can facilitate the transfer of hot carriers through the MS contact and, thus, increase the efficiency of the PEC water oxidation reaction.
The mechanism for the LSPR-induced OER on Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes is shown in Fig. 5. When the photoanode is illuminated with light, hot electron–hole pairs are created. According to recent studies using gold,44–48 these hot carriers can be induced by interband and intraband transitions. The IPCE peak at a photon energy of 2.3 eV (λ = 546 nm) is attributed to the generation of hot carriers by intraband transitions. Hot electrons responsible for this peak come from the decay of LSPR and have sufficient energy to overcome a Schottky barrier of about 0.85 eV at the Au/TiO2 interface. Thus, hot holes located below the Fermi level can migrate to the Au/electrolyte interface and participate in water oxidation. However, since the electron population near the Fermi level in gold is rather small, the contribution of intraband carriers in the total photocurrent is minor.47,49 Because of the high density of states (DOS) of the d-band in gold, a much larger photocurrent can be generated in Au/TiO2 nanostructures as a result of interband transitions.46,47,49,50 Therefore, this process is most often indicated in the literature as the main source of hot charges in plasmonic nanostructures based on gold NPs.48,51 The upper edge of the d-band in gold lies about 2.3 eV below the Fermi level.49,52 Thus, it can be expected that hot electrons excited from the d-band can reach energy levels up to 0.7 eV above the Fermi level, provided that the photon energy is in the range of 1.65–3.0 eV (λ = 415–750 nm). Based on the data presented in Fig. 4d for Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes formed by the deposition of large NPs (60–80 nm), this amount of excess energy is insufficient for hot electrons to overcome the Schottky barrier. Therefore, the contribution of interband transitions into photocurrent in such photoanodes is minimal, which is confirmed by the IPCE measurements shown in Fig. 3a. However, this contribution increases as the Au NPs decrease in size because the Schottky barrier height is lower. As can be seen in Fig. 4d, the Schottky barrier decreases from 0.85 to 0.52 eV when the size of the Au NPs is reduced from 80 to 20 nm. It can be expected that a similar trend will be observed for NPs smaller than 20 nm. Thus, hot electrons excited from the d-band in the gold are able to overcome the Schottky barrier at the Au NPs/TiO2 interface, which leads to a significant increase in the photocurrent and efficiency of the OER. This last statement is confirmed by the data in Fig. 3a where there is an increase in the IPCE when the photons have an energy of 2.6–3.0 eV (λ = 415–480 nm). It should be noted that some of the hot electrons can also traverse the Schottky barrier through the tunneling process.47 An important point when considering the dependence of photocurrent on the size of the NPs is the lifetime of the hot charges in the metal. The lifetime of hot electrons in metals is very short (on the order of tens of fs), and, consequently, their mean free path does not exceed tens of nm.53–56 For hot electrons moving through a metal NP, the flux decreases exponentially as the NP size increases (i.e. j = j0 exp(−dAu/λ), where λ is the ballistic mean free path of the electron). Under these conditions, it is reasonable to assume that the dependence of the distance the hot carriers travel on the size of the Au NPs, along with the factors listed above, should also be taken into account when considering variations in the efficiency of the LSPR-induced OER on Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes.
 Fig. 5  Mechanism for the hot carrier mediated OER on Au NPs@TNAs electrodes under visible light illumination. 
To further understand hot carrier injection at the interface between Au and TiO2 upon SPR excitation, finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations for Au NPs@TNAs were performed that show the spatial distribution of the electric-field intensity at the interface between Au and TiO2, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The electric field intensity appears prominently along the edges of the gold NPs; augmentation of the Au NPs at a wavelength of 537 nm is observed on all three samples. The hot spots generated through electric-field enhancements via direct Au/TiO2 contact play an important role in hot electron generation. Considering that strong electric enhancement occurs at the edges of the NPs, smaller NPs will increase the total perimeter length compared with larger NPs with the same coverage; thus, more hot carriers can travel over the interface. Interesting future studies involve the direct probing of hot electron transfer using ultrafast studies or metal–semiconductor diodes during photocatalytic processes.15,20,56 Nevertheless, our results can also be evidence showing enhanced hot carrier transport caused by the longer perimeter and the resulting enhanced quantum efficiency.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we studied photocatalytic water splitting mediated by the injection of hot carriers using TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) decorated with plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs) of various sizes. The rate of oxygen evolution from the 5 nm Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes is 11.4 μmol h−1 cm−2 and the faradaic efficiency is around 95%, which indicates that the charges generated are almost fully involved in the water oxidation reaction. We showed that the internal quantum efficiency of Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes for the oxygen evolution reaction under visible light increases from 1.96 to 7.68%, when the size of the Au NPs decreases from 30 to 5 nm. Moreover, the smaller NP-decorated TNAs show about a 9-fold lower Au loading compared with the larger NPs with the same coverage. To determine the origin of this increase in quantum efficiency, we investigated variations in the Schottky barrier at the interface between the Au NPs and the TNAs as a function of NP size using conductive atomic force microscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. We showed that the height of the Schottky barrier in Au NPs@TNAs photoanodes decorated with 5 nm Au NPs is significantly lower compared with photoanodes using larger NPs. Thus, the increased quantum efficiency of the photoanodes decorated with smaller NPs is attributed to the enhanced transfer of hot carriers generated from interband transitions in gold across the Au/TiO2 interface.
