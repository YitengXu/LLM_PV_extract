    , Accepted 24th May 2023First published on 25th May 2023AbstractEnhanced radiative efficiency, long carrier lifetimes, and high carrier mobilities are hallmarks of perovskite solar cells. Considering this, complete cells experience large nonradiative recombination losses that restrict their VOC considerably below the Shockley–Queisser limit. Auger recombination, which involves two free photo-induced carriers and a trapped charge carrier, is one potential mechanism. Herein, the effects of Auger capture coefficients in mixed-cation perovskites are analyzed employing SCAPS-1D computations. It is demonstrated that VOC and FF are severely decreased with an increase in the acceptor concentration and Auger capture coefficients of perovskites, thus reducing the device performance. When the Auger capture coefficient is increased to 10−20 cm6 s−1 under the acceptor concentration of 1016 cm−3, the performance is drastically lowered from 21.5% (without taking Auger recombination into account) to 9.9%. The findings suggest that in order to increase the efficiency of perovskite solar cells and prevent the effects of Auger recombination, the Auger recombination coefficients should be less than 10−24 cm6 s−1.
1. Introduction
One of the biggest difficulties facing humanity in the 21st century is finding ways to produce energy that are both renewable and cost-effective. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer a highly effective and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels.1–6 They also have the huge potential to kick-start a breakthrough in the production of electricity for the generations that will follow us. This is because of the exceptional optoelectronic and material properties that they possess. Metal halide perovskite solar cells have achieved verified efficiencies of more than 25% after just a few years of study, outperforming other well-established solar cell technologies such as CIGS or CdTe in small-area devices.7–11 Despite this, the current record efficiencies of solar cells based on perovskites are below the radiative limit set by the Shockley–Queissier (SQ) hypothesis. All electron–hole pair recombination processes inside a perovskite solar cell are assumed to be radiative and all emitted photons are allowed to escape in the radiative limit. To put it another way, the performance of the device is not constrained by non-radiative recombination losses in this scenario. However, perovskite solar cells will always have non-radiative recombination losses because of things like Auger recombination, defect-assisted recombination, band-tail recombination, etc.12–16 For solar materials to be effective, they must have low recombination coefficients for direct radiative band-to-band transitions and a high nonradiative lifespan for recombination through defects. It is widely known that non-radiative recombination losses are the main cause of the underutilization of the thermodynamic potential of perovskite-based solar systems.17,18 The open-circuit voltage of the cells is not the only thing that is limited by nonradiative recombination losses; the fill factor is also limited because of an ideality factor that is greater than one.18,19 Since it is expected that only radiative recombination would occur in order to determine the detailed balance limit for efficiency calculation, it is important to take other recombination modes into account. Therefore, some published research has revealed some intriguing findings about the efficiency limit of PSCs when the photon recycling effect, interfacial modifications, and the application of the drift-diffusion model are taken into consideration.20–23 In addition, it was noted that the Auger recombination mechanism, a different recombination pathway, has the strongest inherent limits on the conversion efficiency and VOC of solar cells.24,25 Therefore, it is thought that the Auger recombination process must be considered while calculating the performance of the PSCs since the Auger coefficients of perovskite-based materials are almost two times higher in magnitude than those of other solar materials with comparable band gaps.
In order to investigate the impact of trap-assisted Auger recombination on bimolecular recombination in lead-halide perovskites, Thomas Kirchartz and colleagues devised a statistical model analogous to the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination model.26 This team calculated defect levels in occupations by combining estimations of transition rates with a comprehensive balance-compatible technique. Based on their analysis, this team determined that nonradiative bimolecular recombination in MAPbI3 and comparable materials is most likely not due to Auger recombination through traps. When calculating the balancing limit for PSCs, Takashi Minemoto's group took into account both radiative and Auger recombinations.27 The results of the Auger recombination experiment show that the open circuit voltage is mostly impacted by this procedure. To reduce the effect of the Auger recombination process on the improved solar performance of PSCs, the Auger recombination coefficient of the hole of the perovskites should be less than 10−31 cm6 s−1. In the case of MAPbI3 perovskite, the anticipated efficiency after accounting for Auger recombination was 28.92%. Utilizing first-principles calculations, Van de Walle and colleagues determined Auger recombination coefficients for MAPbI3 halide perovskites.24 This group showed that the very high third-order recombination coefficient results from Auger recombination. A coincidence of resonance between the energy band gap and the interband transition to a series of higher-lying conduction bands may explain the strong Auger coefficient. In addition, it was discovered that the deformities in PbI6 octahedra are a substantial contributor to the high Auger coefficient, which suggests that there may be opportunities for the design of materials.
In this work, a typical (n–i–p) architecture (FTO/TiO2/CsMAFAPb(BrI)3/CuSCN/Au) without Spiro-OMeTAD is analyzed and replicated. Utilizing SCAPS-1D software, the photovoltaic parameters were simulated and optimized based on Auger capture recombination coefficients, the acceptor concentration of perovskite, perovskite thickness, and total defect density. This research will be useful for both expert and general laboratories in identifying the primary problems with their devices and being inspired to work toward solutions, such as the development of more efficient photovoltaics. In the parts that follow, the device's assembly and computation are described in depth.
2. Simulation details
This study was computationally modeled by a Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) created by a team from the University of Gent in Belgium.28 This program is derived from three fundamental semiconducting equations: Poisson's formula and the continuity equations for free carriers, which provide charge generation and recombination mechanisms in perovskites.29–31 SCAPS-1D's main attraction is its capacity to model electrical properties under different lighting situations, including quantum efficiency (QE), J–V properties, recombination profiles of electrons and holes, and band structure diagrams. Physical factors, such as electron affinity, mobility, band gap, dielectric constants, interface defects, doping, and so on, can be adjusted for various layers in order to achieve the appropriate architecture.
By transferring the energy to a third carrier, Auger recombination allows it to be stimulated to a higher energy level without changing the energy bands. The third carrier often loses its extra energy due to thermal vibrations after the interaction. Due to the three-particle interaction nature of this mechanism, it often only becomes noticeable under non-equilibrium circumstances with a high carrier density.32
Under thermal equilibrium, the Auger recombination (RA) and thermal generation rate (Go) equal each other32: RAo = Go = Cnno2p0 + Cppo2n0(1)
The non-equilibrium Auger recombination rate (rA) and resulting net recombination rate under steady-state conditions are32: rA = Cnn2p + Cpp2n(2)
In the three-particle process known as Auger recombination, an electron (e) in the conduction band that was created as a result of photon absorption transfers its energy to either a hole (h) in the valence band (ehh) or to another e in the conduction band (eeh process). It is possible to express the Auger recombination rate (RAuger) as33: RA = rA − Go = Cn(n2p − no2po) + Cp(np2 − nopo2),(3)where n and p, respectively, represent electron and hole densities under irradiation, with the subscript o denoting values under the dark equilibrium condition. Cn and Cp are the Auger coefficients for the eeh and ehh operations, respectively. Because RAuger develops as the cube of carrier's concentration, it should restrict performance at high carrier injection rates, such as in high-current density light-emitting diodes and photovoltaics under high irradiation.

Fig. 1a depicts the vertical cross-sectional area of a triple-cation PSC simulation. Fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) was selected as the front contact material, followed by a TiO2 layer as the electron transport material (ETM), triple-cation CsMAFAPb(BrI)3 perovskite as the photoactive material, inorganic CuSCN as the hole transport material (HTM), and metallic gold as the back contact on the HTL film. The cells were deemed to be irradiated with AM 1.5 spectrum (100 mW cm−2) emanating from the FTO side. Fig. 1b and c display the graphical band structure diagrams of a developed model. The formation of the heterojunction resulted in the alignment of the Fermi level of all films and the alignment of all bands at equilibrium with the vacuum level. The Fermi level separates into the quasi-Fermi levels and an excess of free photocarriers is created when the material is exposed to light. The device's open-circuit voltage is generated from the gap between the quasi-Fermi levels.34,35Fig. 1d shows the absorption coefficients of all materials employed in this computational research. This design of photovoltaics benefits from perovskite's strong absorption pattern in the visible region of incident light.36

Tables 1 and 2 reveal the PSC and material variables utilized in the numerical model, all of which were chosen based on the literature data, theory, or acceptable estimation. Based on the previously reported experimental work, the PSC device structure used as a template for modeling is FTO/TiO2/CsFAMAPb(IBr)3/CuSCN/Au.37 Determining the solar cell's changing physical characteristics is the main and most important task of a simulation. In order to achieve this, the performance of the PSCs has been systematically evaluated by adjusting several factors, such as acceptor concentration, the Auger recombination mechanism, light intensity, perovskite layer thickness, and the total defect density. All simulations were run at 300 K under global AM 1.5 spectral light.

3. Results and discussion
Because active layer thickness is a key component in controlling the performance of perovskite photovoltaics, its influence on the solar cell output characteristics has been simulated. Fig. 2a shows how the J–V characteristics vary as the active layer thickness is varied from 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm in 0.2 μm increments. As can be seen in Table 3, VOC reaches its highest value of 1.072 V at 0.4 μm thickness and decreases to 1.047 V at 1.2 μm thickness of the photoactive perovskite. The value of JSC rises considerably with the thickness, reaching its highest value of 25.483 mA.cm−2 at a thickness of 1.2 μm. As the thickness of the perovskite film is increased from 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm, the FF is observed to decrease constantly, from 83.84% to 77.83%. Recombination of charge carriers within the perovskite is responsible for the decreasing FF as the film thickness increases. Lifetime limitations prevent charge carriers from entering the conduction band of the perovskites.41,42 Furthermore, the efficiency rises from 15.05% at a thickness of 0.2 μm in the perovskite layer to 21.00% at a thickness of 0.8 μm. After that, as shown in Table 3, it begins to drop until it reaches 20.22% at a thickness of 1.2 μm of the perovskite. The reason for this is that the perovskite layer's thickness (0.8 μm) allows for more energy absorption, leading to greater performance. However, the efficiency of the PSC drops at a thickness of 0.8 μm because the recombination rate in the photovoltaic increases.

QE is a variable that represents the spectroscopic response of the photovoltaics as a function of the wavelength of the light source. Fig. 2b displays the computed QE spectra for several triple-cation PSC devices. Take into account that the QE graphs shown in the simulations are created from the optimal devices, so things like optical reflection from individual layers, interfaces, and both resistances (Rshunt and Rseries) are ignored. We discover that the PSCs have a high QE in the visible spectrum. Consequently, the devices have high JSC values. Evidently, a thinner perovskite results in less photon absorption at longer wavelengths. This is because there are fewer photo-generated carriers in the perovskite layer. Also, there is no light absorption below the band gaps for wavelengths longer than 800 nm, so the QE decreases to zero. Additionally, at wavelengths higher than 800 nm, QE drops to zero since light cannot be collected below the band gaps. All simulated PSCs exhibit a decrease in QE at wavelengths of less than 385 nm. This is because the majority of photons are collected by the substrate and ETM.43 A comparison of the best-performing device so produced with the previous experimental investigation of FTO/TiO2/CsFAMAPb(IBr)3/CuSCN/Au is presented in Fig. 2c. The inset table demonstrates that the computed performance parameters correlate closely with the previously reported experimental study by Arora et al..37
According to published studies, defects in perovskite cause charge carriers to recombine through trap states.44–46 The trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination type is denoted by the following relations, where Et and Nt represent the defect energy level and total density, respectively. Here, σ denotes the carrier capture cross section, while Vth denotes the thermal velocity. (4) (5)
Therefore, by applying the following equations, we can get the carrier diffusion length (L), or the distance that charge carriers travel before recombining in the perovskite material.21,47 (6) (7)where D, μ, τ, q, KB, and T are the diffusion coefficient, carrier mobility, carrier lifetime, elementary charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10−23 J K−1), and temperature (300 K). By changing the Nt value of the perovskite, as shown in Table 4, we were able to determine the various diffusion lengths and lifetimes of the carriers. By reducing the number of defects, the carriers’ lifetimes can be increased, leading to greater diffusion lengths and reduced recombination, both of which contribute to better PSC performance. The Nt value of the perovskite was changed from 1 × 1012 cm−3 to 1 × 1016 cm−3 while other parameters were held constant according to Tables 1 and 2. The effects of the Nt variation of the perovskite on the PSC performance (PCE, FF, JSC, and VOC) are demonstrated in Fig. 3a and b. It is shown that all the photovoltaic parameters have revealed a minor increase in their values upon reducing the Nt below 1 × 1013 cm−3 with a VOC of 1.1 V, JSC of 25.59 mA cm−2, FF of 76.54%, and PCE of 21.55%. Accordingly, the optimal value of defect density was determined to be 1.3 × 1014 cm−3. Another reason for choosing this value is that it gives us a 890 nm diffusion length and a 150 ns carrier lifetime, which are comparable with the experimental results of the triple-cation CsMAFAPb(IBr)3 perovskite.37

The SCAPS-1D program takes into account the radiative recombination coefficient, the Auger electron capture coefficient, and the Auger hole capture coefficient when analyzing the properties of a device. In our study, the magnitude of the radiative recombination coefficient was kept fixed at a low value of 10−20 cm3 s−1 for the perovskite devices, and we focused on the Auger recombination effects on PSC performance. The performance of photovoltaics is reduced by a phenomenon known as Auger recombination, which occurs when energy from the recombination of holes and electrons is transmitted to either electrons or holes to excite them to higher energy levels.48Fig. 4a shows variation of the Auger electron/hole capture coefficient with J–V plots and Fig. 4b displays the variations of photovoltaic parameters of PSCs. It is found that all parameters slightly improve with decreasing the Auger coefficients from 10−20 to 10−22 cm6 s−1; after that, all these parameters remain almost constant throughout the range of 10−23–10−25 cm6 s−1. The recombination coefficients have a significant impact on the charge recombination process. The VOC drops as the recombination rate rises because the charge collection efficiency diminishes. The PSC performance reduced as the recombination coefficients increased, which was associated with a drop in carrier transport features.49 Therefore, these coefficients should not be exceeded unless the photovoltaic's performance is drastically reduced.

The acceptor concentration plays a crucial role in the perovskite photovoltaics’ operating mechanism. The perovskite film acceptor concentration was varied from 5 × 1014 cm−3 to 1 × 1016 cm−3. Fig. 5a exhibits the effect of the acceptor density (NA) on the J–V plots. The VOC improves slightly from 1.064 V to 1.091 V as NA increases from 5 × 1014 cm−3 to 1 × 1016 cm−3. Meanwhile, the JSC decreased from 24.88 mA cm−2 to 24.73 mA cm−2 as NA increases, resulting from the increasing number of hole traps, leading to recombination of induced electrons due to coulomb attraction.48 As shown in Fig. 5c, the value of FF enhances initially but reduces with further increase of the NA value. The PCE is about 21.5%, corresponding to an NA of 5 × 1014 cm−3. The moderate improvement in VOC, slight reduction in JSC, and decreased FF damaged the performance of the PSC, which corresponds to an acceptor concentration of 1 × 1016 cm−3.

The Auger recombination coefficients were varied from 10−30 cm6 s−1 to 10−20 cm6 s−1 to study the impact on photovoltaic parameters with respect to NA variation. When the energy of the recombination process is released, rather than creating a photon, a third carrier is energized as a result of the Auger effect, which happens when the hole is driven deeper into the valence band and the electron is raised in the conduction band. The influence of the Auger recombination coefficient on the characteristics of photovoltaics for various acceptor concentrations is depicted in Fig. 5b. Since the rate of Auger recombination rises with the number of carriers, computations performed with lower NA values result in more stable PSC parameters than those performed with higher NA values. In the case of a lower acceptor concentration, both the VOC and the JSC exhibit a slight decrease at the 10−20 cm6 s−1 value of the Auger coefficient. Conversely, it has a damaging impact when the density of acceptors is high. The PCE and FF decline dramatically because of the dire changes in the VOC and JSC in cases of higher NA values. As shown in eqn (3), the effect of Auger recombination is expected to be significant when the value of NA increases, which affects the whole solar cell parameters, essentially JSC and FF. Therefore, the Auger recombination coefficients should be small with an appropriate acceptor density to achieve high device performance.26 At large carrier injection rates, RAuger will tend to limit the efficiency because it grows as the cube of carrier density.33
We continue by analyzing the PSC's performance as a function of light intensity in an effort to identify the bottleneck that is restricting its performance. There has been no extensive research conducted to date that might shed light on the impact of device characteristics. Although this approach depends on modeling findings, the overall conclusions may be readily applied to solely experimental approaches, making it useful for the PSC community to enhance photovoltaic cells. The simulated J–V curves of the PSCs in the range of light intensities from 1 sun to 4 suns are demonstrated in Fig. 6a. Because the Auger recombination coefficients are small, dominance only occurs at very high charge carrier densities (to be further discussed). As shown in Fig. 6c, the FF is reduced constantly with increasing light intensity and is very sensitive to the changes in defect states due to trap-assisted recombination at the interfaces and in the bulk.50,51 Overall, the efficiency of triple-cation PSCs slightly improved with increasing light intensity. Nevertheless, exploring the light intensity dependency in the J–V curve shows a huge difference in the PSC behavior in cases of high Auger recombination coefficients (Fig. 6b). The impacts of light intensity become perceptible only at high Auger recombination coefficients. Auger recombination limits the efficiency of photovoltaics at sufficiently high irradiance.33 The PCE of the device decreased from 18.15% to 15.77% with increasing irradiance from 1 sun to 4 suns due to the dominance of the Auger recombination process.

4. Conclusions
We have simulated and studied a solar cell based on a triple-cation perovskite absorber layer in order to identify and address the causes limiting the device's performance and to find ways to increase its efficiency. For computation analysis, we use a solar cell stacking of glass/FTO/TiO2/CsMAFAPb(BrI)3/CuSCN/Au. For triple-cation perovskite solar cells, the detailed balance limit of the photovoltaic performance is reported when Auger recombination is taken into account. The highest power conversion efficiency of 21.69% is shown by the defect density and Auger recombination coefficients of 1012 cm−3 and 10−24 cm6 s−1, respectively. Auger recombination is shown to have the strongest effect on the FF. As the Auger recombination coefficient rises, the FF and PCE decrease dramatically. Under the acceptor density of 1 × 1016 cm−3, the PCE is severely reduced from 21.5% (without the consideration of Auger recombination) to 9.9% when the Auger coefficient is increased to 10−20 cm6 s−1. The findings indicate that improved cell performance of perovskite solar cells can be achieved by adopting perovskites with Auger coefficients less than 10−24 cm6 s−1. This study can be considered for photovoltaic applications such as concentrator solar cells, where the Auger recombination effects become more significant on the efficiency of solar cells at sufficiently high irradiance.
