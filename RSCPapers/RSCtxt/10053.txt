    , Accepted 19th December 2018First published on 19th December 2018AbstractIn this work, three fast removable solvent additives o-chloroanisole (CBE), o-chlorobenzaldehyde (CBA), and o-chloroacetophenone (CBK) with low boiling points (bp.) of 195, 212, and 230 °C, respectively, were applied for morphology control of PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers. Without a vacuum drying process, CBE, CBA, and CBK could work well as fast removable solvent additives in chlorobenzene (CB) host solvent. Relative to the routine 1:1.5, a D/A ratio of 1:2 is more beneficial for device performances with thicker active layers because of increased charge extraction rates and longer carrier lifetimes. At a thickness of ∼100 nm, CBE, CBA, and CBK gave PCEs between 9.51% and 9.55% while for 230 nm thick active layers, CBE, CBA, and CBK afforded PCEs of 10.12%, 9.90%, and 9.27%, respectively, well demonstrating the advantage of low bp. solvent additives in vacuum drying-free processing of thick active layers. Relative to the ∼100 nm level, an optimal PCE at the ∼200 nm level is more useful for defining a larger processing window that can help fabrication of pin-hole free active layers during high speed printing. Therefore, the fast removable solvent additive strategy has big potential to upgrade some high efficiency active layer materials to a more roll-to-roll compatible level.
Introduction
Aiming at the sustainable development of human society, there is a growing demand for renewable energy sources. Bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) are a promising renewable energy technology because of their light weight, flexibility, and large area low-temperature solution manufacturing that can be compatible with a continuous roll-to-roll printing line.1,2 A BHJ active layer composed of electron-donor and -acceptor phases possesses great advantage in supplying large donor/acceptor interfaces for efficient charge separations as well as a bicontinuous interpenetrating network of the donor and acceptor phases for fast transports of holes and electrons to electrodes in the mean-time.3,4 Along with the great efforts in developing new donor and acceptor materials as well as good control of the BHJ morphology, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction BHJ PSCs are continuously improved up to the state-of-the-art ∼14%.5–9 Thermal annealing,10 solvent vapor annealing (SVA)11–13 and use of solvent additives14–17 are the typical methods for morphology optimizations of BHJ active layers. It should be noted that using a solvent additive is an indispensable method in achieving many record efficiencies for both fullerene and nonfullerene based BHJ PSCs.17–26 At the eve of real application of PSCs, developing promising solvent additives to meet roll-to-roll compatibility becomes quite necessary.
Large area and high speed solution printing of organic active layers toward scale-up manufacturing will encounter the thickness variation issue.27 An ideal active layer should maintain high efficiency even when its thickness is largely varied.6,28 This concern has been called as the thickness tolerance of an organic active layer, which is very important in defining a processing window for PSCs with a qualified PCE on a roll-to-roll printing line.29 During the past few years, increasing attention has been paid to the thickness tolerance issue, and development of new donors and acceptors with high carrier mobility and good control of the nanoscale morphology of BHJ films have been demonstrated to be effective.6,9,28–34 Although a 100 nm average thickness of the active layer has already shown very high efficiency and is also beneficial for saving materials cost, the thickness is only suitable for defining a very small processing window. For example, a thickness range of 100 ± 30 nm would significantly limit the operating speed of a roll-to-roll printing line. Low production capacity means high product cost. Relative to a ∼100 nm average thickness, a thicker active layer can also help suppressing of pin-holes inside the active layer.28 Thus a thicker average thickness with an enlarged processing window to meet a higher operating speed is more attractive. It is worth noting that high efficiency and a wide processing window from ∼100 to ∼600 nm based on an average thickness at 300–400 nm has been realized, based on some high mobility materials.29 A suitable average thickness should be a compromise of operating speed, yield control, and materials cost when transferred to an industrially feasible roll-to-roll line.
PTB7-Th (Fig. 1a) and PTB7 with the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene backbone unit are two well-known low band gap polymer donors because of some record efficiency performances reported in the past several years for single junction BHJ PSCs.35,36 Unlike the alkyl substitutions for PTB7, PTB7-Th comprises alkylthienyl pendants on the benzodithiophene (BDT) unit, which afford PTB7-Th with higher PCEs than PTB7 in combination with a fullerene or a nonfullerene acceptor.17,21,24,25,37–39 Recently, PTB7-Th based active layers showing high short-circuit current densities (Jsc) in binary and ternary PSCs with outstanding PCEs up to 14% have been demonstrated,40,41 from which tandem PSCs with a record high PCE of 17.29% can be achieved with the PTB7-Th based ternary blend film.42 Also, PTB7-Th based semitransparent PSCs with 9.77% PCE for an average visible transmittance of 36% have been realized, which may promote the development of power generating windows.43 These results clearly indicate the promising future of PTB7-Th based active layers. It should be noted that the high efficiency BHJ active layers of PTB7-Th and PTB7 are typically processed with chlorobenzene (CB) as the host solvent and small amount 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive.17,42,44

There are several reports involving the evaluation of the thickness tolerance of PTB7-Th and PTB7 based active layers. In the report by Marks et al., CB/DIO processed PTB7:PC71BM active layers showed very poor thickness tolerance, with PCEs of 7.98%, 6.63%, and 4.23% for 100, 195, and 300 nm active layer thicknesses, respectively.44 Relative to the device performance at 100 nm thickness, PTB7-Th also exhibited obviously decreased PCEs for thicker active layers of ∼200 nm. In the report by Jen et al., CB/DIO processed PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers with a D/A ratio of 1:1.5 displayed PCEs of 9.3%, 9.41%, and 8.01% for ∼100, 150, and 230 nm active layer thicknesses, respectively.34 For PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers processed with a D/A ratio of 1:1.1 and a much lower DIO content of 0.5%, PCEs of 9.03%, 7.45%, and 6.50% were found for thicknesses of 100, 200, and 280 nm, respectively.45 For all-polymer PSCs with PTB7-Th as the donor, the PCE showed a large decrease along with increasing active layer thickness.46 Although untraditional spin-coatings have been proposed for the modification of the thickness tolerance of PTB7-Th based active layers, the film-forming processes are more complicated than the routine one.34,47 It should be noted that DIO is still the solvent additive in modification of thickness tolerance.
DIO is a solvent additive with a very high boiling point (bp.) of 332.5.14 There is DIO residue inside the active layer when the host solvent has been removed during the solution processing.48,49 A subsequent vacuum drying process is typically applied to fully remove the DIO residue so as to maximize PCE, e.g. even for a low DIO loading of 0.5%.45 However, toward full roll-to-roll solution-processing of BHJ PSCs, the vacuum drying process to remove a solvent additive with a very high bp., e.g. the DIO, is unfavorable and should be avoided.49 Although removing DIO via a solvent washing process is an alternative consideration, the extra washing processing would increase cost.48 Very recently, we demonstrated that o-chlorobenzaldehyde (CBA in Fig. 1) with a bp. of 212 °C was a higher efficiency solvent additive for the morphology optimization of PTB7:PC71BM active layers when compared with DIO.49 Due to its much lower bp. relative to DIO, CBA can show the advantage of fast removal in the absence of vacuum drying: being almost completely removed along the evaporation process of the CB host solvent during spin-casting, and thus avoiding excessive SVA effects of DIO residue in thick BHJ films during vacuum drying. The CBA-processed PTB7:PC71BM active layers of 100, 200 and 300 nm could achieve PCEs of 9.11%, 8.24%, and 7.11%, respectively, much higher than 7.53%, 5.71%, and 4.93% for corresponding DIO control devices with vacuum drying. It should be noted that, from 100 to 300 nm, the continuously decreased PCEs are unideal in defining high efficiency processing windows. Therefore, there is a great demand to demonstrate that a fast removable solvent additive can reverse the PCE decreasing tendency with thicker blend films, particularly for some promising material systems.
In this work, o-chloroanisole (CBE) and o-chloroacetophenone (CBK), two new solvent additives with bp. values of ∼195 and ∼230 °C, respectively, were investigated in spin-coating PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers, in comparison to CBA (Fig. 1). It was found that, without a vacuum drying process, CBE, CBA, and CBK all could work well as fast removable solvent additives in the CB host solvent. At a thickness level of 100 nm and D/A ratio of 1:1.5, CBE, CBA, and CBK gave PCEs between 9.12% and 9.66% while for a D/A ratio of 1:2, very limited changing of PCE between 9.51% and 9.55% was observed. Relative to CBA, the new additives CBE and CBK further challenge the lower and the higher bp. limits when used as effective fast removable solvent additives. It should be noted that the bp. for CBE is very close to the 180 °C for o-dichlorobenzene (DCB), a common solvent that has been widely used in the fabrication of active layers. It was also found that a D/A ratio of 1:2 is beneficial for device performances of thicker active layers. For 230 nm thick active layers, CBE, CBA, and CBK afforded PCEs of 10.12%, 9.90%, and 9.27%, respectively, well demonstrating the advantage of low bp. solvent additives in vacuum drying-free processing of thick active layers. It is worth noting that several CB/DIO-processed active layers of ∼100 nm thickness have shown top PCEs over 13%.9,41 Our fast removable solvent additive strategy would be a possible choice to upgrade some high efficiency active layer materials to a more roll-to-roll compatible level.
Results and discussion
In order to evaluate the photovoltaic performances of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers fabricated with CBE, CBA, and CBK as the fast removable solvent additives in the CB host solvent, we first selected a D/A ratio of 1:1.5 for the active layers. It should be noted that the blend ratio was the best as initially shown by the PTB7:PC71BM based PSCs and then was widely utilized in many reports for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM based PSCs. The device configuration for the PTB7-Th based BHJ PSCs in this study is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al, where an alcohol-soluble polymer PFN film (5 nm)50 is the electron selective layer for the Al cathode. With a PTB7-Th concentration of 10 mg mL−1 (or total concentration of 25 mg mL−1) in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM = 1:1.5 blend solution, 100 nm thick PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers could be obtained via spin-coating at 1400 rpm for 2 min. Generally, the blend films during spin-coating in the first 30 s already displayed a slightly brownish-red color, very close to a fully dried state, and then we further rotated the films for another 1.5 min to give fully solidified films. This was confirmed by immediate IR measurements of the spin-coated blend films (Fig. S1–S3 in the ESI†), which did not contain any signals from CB and the solvent additives. It should be noted that, on a roll-to-roll line, short-time blowing to the newly developed blend film may be needed to fully remove the solvent and additive, due to lacking forced convection of the spin-coating process. Relatively, among the three additives, CBE with a bp. already close to the common solvent DCB may be the best choice. Without the additional vacuum drying of the active layers as applied for the CB/DIO case, the PFN layer was subsequently coated and then started the Al cathode deposition. The measurements of the PSCs were carried out under illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

As a comparison, PSCs based on active layers without a solvent additive were fabricated. The pure CB-processed PTB7-Th:PC71BM = 1:1.5 blend film of 100 nm thickness exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 10.08 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 53.17%, corresponding to a PCE of 4.71%. With a 3% content of CBE in CB, device performances were obviously improved. The PSC device showed an almost comparable Voc of 0.81 V, but a largely elevated Jsc of 16.23 mA cm−2 and FF of 73.48%, giving a remarkably increased PCE of 9.66%. The results suggest that a solvent additive is quite necessary to achieve a high performance PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer. PCS devices with the same 3% content for CBA and CBK as the fast removable solvent additives were also compared. The PSCs with the three additives showed similar J–V curves (Fig. 2a), also with comparable curves for external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 2b). The calculated PCEs for the CBA- and CBK-processed PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers are 9.43% and 9.12%, respectively. The integrated Jsc values based on the EQE curves are 16.14, 16.01, and 15.90 mA cm−2 for the CBE-, CBA-, and CBK-processed active layers, respectively, showing very small spectral mismatch less than 1%. The results demonstrate that using the fast removable solvent additives can supply PTB7-Th:PC71BM based PSCs with good PCEs, almost comparable to that achieved with the high bp. DIO. However, using a fast removable solvent additive can omit the vacuum drying process of the active layers, supplying more compatible processing to the roll-to-roll printing.
 Fig. 2  (a) J–V curves of PSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM = 1:1.5 blend films of 100 nm thickness fabricated without and with the fast removable solvent additives (3% content in CB) and (b) EQE curves of the PSCs with the three solvent additives. (c) TEM images of PTB7-Th:PC71BM = 1:1.5 blend films of 100 nm thickness fabricated without and with the fast removable solvent additives (3% content in CB). 
TEM images of PTB7-Th:PC71BM = 1:1.5 blend films fabricated without and with the fast removable solvent additives are shown in Fig. 2c. Without a solvent additive, large fullerene agglomerates with sizes up to the 200 nm level could be found from the blend film. The severe agglomeration will deteriorate the formation of a bicontinuous interpenetration network that can result in decreased donor/acceptor interfaces (poor charge separations) and unbalanced carrier transports (bimolecular recombinations), finally giving a low Jsc of 10.08 mA cm−2 and FF of 53.17%. Similar observations were widely reported previously.47,49 The TEM images of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM = 1:1.5 blend films fabricated with the three fast removable solvent additives are almost comparable. The fullerene agglomerations do not appear at all, corresponding to good phase separations of the donor polymer and the fullerene acceptor. Thus the PSCs can display good PCEs between 9.12% and 9.66%, due to a much higher Jsc of around 16 mA cm−2 and higher FF of more than 71%.
It should be noted that the bp. difference (ΔTbp.) between CBE and CB is as low as 63 °C, further challenging the low ΔTbp. limit of 80 °C as reported for the CB/CBA case previously49 while the corresponding ΔTbp. for CBK is 98 °C, also challenging the upper limit for a solvent additive with fast removable properties. We want to point out the advantage of challenging the lower limit: a faster drying of the active layer is helpful for more intimate equipment arrangement of a roll-to-roll line. Also, further challenging of the upper limit would provide a chance to find more candidates that may be suitable for more active layer materials. We have noticed that diphenyl ether (DPE)16 and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN),15 two often used solvent additives, possess bp. values of ∼260 °C; however, their potentials as effective fast removable solvent additives are still unknown.
A higher content of 5% of the fast removable solvent additives in CB was also investigated. The CBE-, CBA-, and CBK-processed PSCs displayed PCEs of 9.56%, 9.39%, and 9.10%, respectively. The very limited variations of the three photovoltaic parameters along the changing of the additive content indicate that the 3% content for each additive is already sufficient to modify the BHJ morphology. In the meantime, the much higher content of 5% for each additive also does not give any adverse effect. It should be noted that among the three solvent additives, the 3% and 5% contents of CBE all afford PSCs with the highest PCEs (>9.5%) and the highest FF (>73%). The results suggest that CBE with the smallest ΔTbp. of 63 °C is optimal for a 100 nm thick active layer among the three additives.
To evaluate the thickness tolerance of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers being processed with the three solvent additives, we further investigated the photovoltaic performances of thicker blend films. Also with a D/A of 1:1.5 and a PTB7-Th concentration of 10 mg mL−1, 200 nm thick PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers were spin-coated at a lower rate of 460 rpm. In the PSCs, the thicker active layers can contribute a higher Jsc of around 18.7 mA cm−2 due to more effective harvesting of solar light, but resulting in a lower FF of about 60%. For the overall effect, the CBE-, CBA-, and CBK-processed PSCs exhibit PCEs of 9.05%, 9.17%, and 8.77%, respectively. Although the efficiencies are all lower than those of PSCs with the corresponding 100 nm thick active layers, the PCE decrease extents of the devices are quite limited, only between 2.8% and 6.3%. The results suggest that using a fast removable solvent additive not only supplies the convenience for roll-to-roll processing of PSCs, but also shows potential to improve the thickness tolerance of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer.
A thicker active layer (e.g. 200 nm) showing lower efficiency is a restriction to define a large processing window as highly efficient as possible. To our delight, it was found that the fast removable solvent additive strategy demonstrated in this work could reverse the tendency between the PCE and active layer thickness when a D/A ratio of 1:2 was selected (Table 1). With a D/A ratio of 1:2 and a PTB7-Th concentration of 10 mg mL−1 (or total concentration of 30 mg mL−1), the former spin-coating conditions at 1400 and 460 rpm could afford slightly thicker PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers of 110 and 230 nm, respectively. In the absence of a solvent additive, a D/A ratio of 1:2 also gave a poor PCE of 5.15% for the 110 nm thick active layer and further reduced the efficiency to 4.02% for the thicker active layer of 230 nm. With 3% CBE as the solvent additive, the 110 nm thick active layer could show a nearly constant PCE of 9.51%, based on a Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 16.03 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.17%. Interestingly, the thicker active layer of 230 nm afforded a higher PCE of 10.12%, based on a Voc of 0.82 V, Jsc of 19.49 mA cm−2, and FF of 63.28%. Thus the higher efficiency for the 230 nm thick active layer results from the increased Jsc. The J–V curves of the two devices are shown in Fig. 3a. The Jsc increase of 21.6% can exceed the decreasing percentage of 17.2% for the FF if compared with the thin active layer, finally giving a higher efficiency for the 230 nm thick active layer. The EQE curves for PSCs based on the 110 and 230 nm active layers are shown in Fig. 3b, and the 230 nm thick active layer can generate a largely enhanced photo-response. The integrated Jsc for the two active layers is 15.68 and 18.58 mA cm−2, respectively, corresponding to spectral mismatches of 2% and 5%.
 Fig. 3  (a) J–V and (b) EQE curves of PSCs based on the CBE-processed PTB7-Th:PC71BM = 1:2 blend films of 110 and 230 nm thickness. 
With a D/A ratio of 1:2, the PCE of 10.12% achieved for the CBE-processed 230 nm thick blend film corresponds to a Jsc of 19.49 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.28%, all higher than the Jsc of 18.87 mA cm−2 and FF of 60.74% for the CBE-processed 200 nm thick blend film based on a D/A ratio of 1:1.5. The results indicate that a D/A ratio of 1:2 is better for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based thick-film PSC devices when the low bp. CBE is used as the solvent additive. However, traditional AFM and TEM observations did not find obvious morphological differences between the two blend films. Previous reports indicated that transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were useful to compare charge recombination dynamics and the charge extraction process, respectively, as alternative proof.51 Thus the charge recombination dynamics and the charge extraction process in the two devices were compared. The TPV analysis is shown in Fig. 4a. The PSC device with a D/A ratio of 1:1.5 showed a charge carrier lifetime of 4.49 μs. For a D/A ratio of 1:2, the lifetime was increased to 7.98 μs. The longer carrier lifetime was consistent with its higher FF in the PSC device, indicating a reduced recombination process. The TPC results are shown in Fig. 4b. For a D/A ratio of 1:1.5, the charge extraction time of the device was 0.377 μs. For the device with a D/A ratio of 1:2, the charge extraction time of the device was decreased to 0.316 μs, meaning a faster extraction rate. Relative to the D/A ratio of 1:1.5, the increased charge extraction rate and longer carrier lifetime caused by the active layer with a D/A ratio of 1:2 should be the major reasons that contributed to its higher FF and Jsc, leading to higher PCE in PSCs.

With a D/A ratio of 1:2, using CBE as the fast removable solvent additive successfully reverses the PCE decreasing tendency for thicker blend film. This would be quite helpful for the enlargement of a high efficiency processing window for PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers. Thicker active layers of 250 and 300 nm were also investigated, which were obtained by spin-coating at 440 rpm with a blend solution of 10 mg mL−1 polymer concentration and 420 rpm with a blend solution of 11 mg mL−1 polymer concentration, respectively. With a CBE-processed 250 nm thick active layer, the PSC device also exhibited a high PCE of 10.02%, with a Voc of 0.81 V, Jsc of 19.54 mA cm−2, and FF of 63.27%. On further increasing the active layer thickness to 300 nm, the PSC device still displayed a good PCE of 9.08%. It should be noted that the very thick active layer can still contribute a FF over 61%, a value hardly achieved by other solvent additives. Thus the CBE-processed PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers can display PCEs more than 9% in the thickness range from ∼100 to 300 nm, demonstrating a largely improved thickness tolerance (Fig. 5a).

The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the 3% CBE-processed PTB7-Th:PC71BM = 1:2 active layers with different thickness were obtained from space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements of hole-only and electron-only devices. The CBE-processed thin active layer of 110 nm shows a μh and μe of 0.93 × 10−3 and 3.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, giving a μe/μh of 3.3. Changing the thickness from 110 to 300 nm thickness alters the μh of the active layers with limited extent (Fig. 5b). For the thicker 230, 250, and 300 nm active layers, the μe values show a continuous increase up to 8.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The calculated μe/μh values are 8.6, 8.4, and 9.6, respectively, showing enlarged deviations from balanced hole and electron transports. This can be reflected by the overall tendency of decreasing FFs in PSCs based on an active layer thickness from 110 to 300 nm. In a previous report for thicker PTB7:PC71BM blend films, a larger unbalanced extent due to decreasing of μe causes monotonous decreasing of PCE.49 However, relative to the thin film (110 nm) in this study, a much higher Jsc of 19.49 and 19.54 mA cm−2 could be achieved for the CBE-processed 230 and 250 nm thick PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers, respectively. Therefore, more sufficient light harvesting with a thicker CBE-processed active layer would be valuable, which compensated FF decreasing and finally gave higher PCEs.
With a D/A ratio of 1:2, the as-cast PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers of 110 and 230 nm all display very poor photovoltaic performances. However, with CBE as a fast removable solvent additive, greatly improved efficiency and thickness tolerance have been demonstrated. The results suggest that the CBE-processed PTB7-Th:PC71BM thin and thick blend films should possess obviously improved nanoscale morphologies. AFM and TEM measurements were carried out to compare PTB7-Th:PC71BM thin and thick blend films without and with CBE as the solvent additive. As shown in Fig. 6a, the 110 nm thick blend film processed without an additive shows a large root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.48 nm. For the thicker blend film of 230 nm without an additive, the surface roughness is further increased to 4.02 nm (Fig. 6b). When using 3% CBE as the solvent additive, the 110 and 230 nm thick blend films exhibit very low RMS values of 1.04 and 1.09 nm, respectively (Fig. 6c and d). Thus largely improved surface morphology can be achieved in the mean time for the thin and thick active layers by applying CBE as the solvent additive. For the TEM analysis, the 110 nm thick blend film processed without an additive displays obvious fullerene agglomerations inside the BHJ blend film, giving very large phase separation (Fig. 6e). The poor BHJ morphology results in a very low Jsc of 10.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 58.7%. For the thicker blend film of 230 nm without an additive, some further enlarged fullerene agglomerates can be found (Fig. 6f) and the PSC device shows a decreased Jsc of 10.09 mA cm−2 and FF of 49.03%. Thus increasing the active layer thickness does not help the Jsc at all, suggesting the decreased interface area between the donor and acceptor phases. Therefore, in the absence of an additive, using a D/A ratio of 1:2 has no positive effect on the photovoltaic performance. However, applying CBE as the solvent additive significantly improves the phase separations for the both 110 and 230 nm thick active layers, and fullerene agglomerations can all be greatly suppressed (Fig. 6g and h). Therefore, CBE-processed PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers of 110 and 230 nm can show high PCEs of 9.51% and 10.12%, respectively. Notably, increasing film thickness from 110 to 230 nm gives a Jsc increase of 21.6% that can exceed the FF decreasing percentage of 17.2%. The overall effect can give a higher PCE for the thicker active layer, from which the thickness tolerance of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer can be improved.

With a D/A ratio of 1:2, PSC devices based on thin and thicker active layers processed with CBA and CBK, two fast removable solvent additives with higher bp. than CBE, were investigated for comparison. The CBA- and CBK-processed 110 nm thick blend films showed PCEs of 9.55% and 9.53%, respectively, almost identical to the 9.51% for the thin active layer with CBE. There is negligible difference among the three additives for the thin active layers. For the CBA- and CBK-processed thicker active layers of 230 nm, PSC devices exhibited PCEs of 9.90% and 9.27%, respectively. The efficiencies are obviously higher than those of DIO-processed thick active layers obtained by conventional spin-coating in previous reports,34,45 well demonstrating the advantage of low bp. solvent additives. The AFM and TEM images of the CBA- and CBK-processed 230 nm thick blend films are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films of 230 nm thickness could display fairly smooth surfaces and greatly suppressed fullerene agglomeration.
Conclusions
In summary, three fast removable solvent additives CBE, CBA, and CBK with low bp. of 195, 212, and 230 °C, respectively, were applied for BHJ morphology control of PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers. Photovoltaic performances based on D/A ratios of 1:1.5 and 1:2 were compared. It was found that without a vacuum drying process CBE, CBA, and CBK could work well as fast removable solvent additives in the CB host solvent, and thus the new additives CBE and CBK could further challenge the lower and upper bp. limits. At a thickness level of 100 nm and D/A ratio of 1:1.5, CBE, CBA, and CBK gave PCEs between 9.12% and 9.66% while for a D/A ratio of 1:2 very limited changing of PCE between 9.51% and 9.55% was observed. It was also found that a D/A ratio of 1:2 is more beneficial for the device performances of thicker active layers, and CBE-, CBA-, and CBK-processed 230 nm thick active layers afforded PCEs of 10.12%, 9.90%, and 9.27%, respectively, well demonstrating the advantage of low bp. solvent additives in vacuum drying-free processing of thick active layers. More importantly, from ∼100 to 300 nm, the CBE-processed active layers can establish a thickness window with PCE > 9%, especially with the 10.12% PCE at 230 nm thickness. Relative to the average thickness of the ∼100 nm level, an optimal PCE at the ∼200 nm level is beneficial for defining a larger processing window that can help pin-hole free active layers at high speed. Therefore the fast removable solvent additive strategy as demonstrated in this work can show big potential for vacuum drying-free fabrication of the PTB7-Th based active layers with improved thickness tolerance, thus facilitating future application.
