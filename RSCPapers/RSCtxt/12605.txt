    , Accepted 19th November 2014First published on 19th November 2014AbstractCuInSe2 (CISe) based quantum dots (QDs), are perceived to be promising alternatives to those of cadmium or lead chalcogenide based QDs in serving as light-harvesting sensitizer materials in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) due to their near-infrared (NIR) absorbing capacity and low toxicity. Herein, we have synthesized high quality CISe QDs via the organic phase high temperature route, and then alloying with ZnS to form the CISe–ZnS QDs with higher chemical stability and superior optoelectronic properties. The obtained “green” CISe and CISe–ZnS QD sensitizers were immobilized onto TiO2 film electrodes with high loading amount through the linker molecule assisted post synthesis assembly approach with the use of MPA-capped water-soluble QDs. Hindered charge recombination in the built CISe–ZnS QD based solar cells in comparison with reference CISe cells has been confirmed by impedance spectroscopy, as well as transient photovoltage decay measurements. With the combination of high QD loading and passivated trap-state defects, the resulting regenerative sandwich CISe–ZnS QD based champion solar cells exhibited an efficiency of 6.79% (Jsc = 22.61 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.583 V, FF = 0.515) under AM 1.5 G full one sun irradiation. The obtained efficiency was among the best performances for liquid-junction QDSCs and also demonstrated comparable photovoltaic performance of “green” CISe based QDs to the toxic cadmium and lead chalcogenide QDs.
1. Introduction
With the increasingly urgent need for clean energy, unremitting endeavor is being made on the direct conversion of solar energy into electricity through photovoltaic (PV) devices.1–3 Among these, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have emerged as a promising candidates in the third generation solar cells4,5 with the potential of theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) surpassing Shockley–Queisser limit of 32% due to the possibility of extraction of hot electrons and multiple exciton generation (MEG).6,7 The ongoing development of QDSCs was addressed by a series of QD sensitizers, including the conventional Cd-based (CdS, CdSe, CdSexS1−x, CdSexTe1−x) and Pd-based (PdS, PdSe) QDs, among which PCEs were improved from less than 1% to 6–7%.8–14 These Cd, Pd-containing QDs based solar cells indeed exhibit excellent photostability and chemical stability, and high PCEs, but the intrinsic high toxicity of Cd or Pd still restricts the commercial application of QDSCs. Hence, exploring high quality “green” QDs sensitizers without carcinogenic heavy metal elements is in great demand.
Pioneering work has been accomplished to explore the low-toxic I–III–VI2 alloyed QDs for application in PV devices because of their unique properties of high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) and relatively narrow band gap.15–18 These I–III–VI2 compounds were deemed to take place of II–VI QDs as better light-harvesting sensitizer materials. For example, the PCE of CuInS2 based QDSCs have been improving steadily to the level comparable to those of toxic cadmium chalcogenides based QDSC.19–24 More importantly, recently, an unprecedented new PCE record of 7.04% has been obtained from CuInS2 based QDSC by Zhong and coworkers.25 However, CuInSe2 (CISe) QDs, compared to CuInS2 (CIS), is considered as a more promising material with larger exciton Bohr radius (∼10.6 nm) and narrower band gap (1.04 vs. 1.5 eV), which can broaden the light-absorbing range to near-infrared (NIR) region.26,27 This is the reason why CuInSe1−xSx QDs were developed in Klimov's work and outstanding performances were obtained in the resultant CuInSe1−xSx QDSCs with remarkably improved stability and PCE (up to 5.5%).28,29 Furthermore, a variety of synthetic approaches for CISe QDs have been developed.30–34 This provides versatile choices for its application in PV devices as light-absorber. Korgel et al. reported a modified synthetic approach for CISe QDs with the use of secondary phosphine as capping ligand.35 These promising findings about the I–III–VI2 QDSCs have triggered considerable attention in the construction of high efficiency “green” QDSCs.
Recent progress has emphasized the importance of band gap tailoring and stability improvement in the I–III–VI2 QDs for their photovoltaic applications.29 Generally, broader light harvesting range is achieved with the use of larger sized QDs. However, large sized QD brings forward the difficulty in penetrating into mesoporous oxide film, and in electron injection from QD sensitizer into TiO2, resulting in low PCEs.29 Alloying CISe with other wider band gap materials is a favorable approach to tune the optoelectronic properties and improve the stability of the resultant QDs, as in the cases of CuInSexS1−x,29 (CIS)1−x–(ZnS)x (ref. 36) and (CISe)1−x–(ZnSe)x QDs.37 In addition, this alloying process could benefit the electron injection from the band gap tailoring, as well as protect and passivate the surface, and therefore outperforms the approach of core–shell structure in serving as light-harvesting materials in QDSCs.38,39 In this work, high-quality NIR absorption (CISe)1−x–(ZnS)x QDs were prepared via the alloying process of CISe QDs with ZnS constituent, followed by a ligand exchange process to obtain water-soluble CISe–ZnS QDs capped by a bifunctional molecule, mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). The MPA-capped QDs were tethered on TiO2 film electrode via a self-assembling process. With the combination of high loading of QD sensitizer and intrinsic superior optoelectronic properties (broad light-harvesting range and high chemical stability.) of the adopted CISe–ZnS alloyed QD sensitizer, the resulting QDSCs exhibit a best performing PCE of 6.79% under full 1 sun illumination, which is among the best performances for liquid-junction QDSCs, and also demonstrates the comparable photovoltaic performance of “green” CISe-based QDs to the toxic cadmium and lead chalcogenide QDs.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Indium acetate (In(OAc)3, 99.99%), zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)2, 99.99%), sulfur powder (99.99%), selenium powder (200 mesh, 99.99%), oleylamine (OAm, 97%) were purchased from Aldrich. Copper iodide (CuI, 99.998%) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 97%) were received from Alfa Aesar, and diphenylphosphine (DPP, 98%) was obtained from J&K. All the chemicals were used as received without further processing.
Synthesis of CISe and CISe–ZnS QDs
For a typical synthesis of CISe QDs from a modified literature approach,35 CuI (19.0 mg, 0.1 mmol) and In(OAc)3 (29.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) were mixed with 4 mL OAm in a flask. The reaction mixture was degassed, and then heated to 180 °C under argon flow. Then, a Se–DPP stock solution (obtained by dissolving 19.7 mg (0.25 mmol) selenium powder in 1 mL DPP) was injected into the reaction mixture and was maintained at this temperature for 10 min. Later, the heating was stopped and the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and dispersed in toluene. Further purification was carried out by precipitation and centrifugation procedures with the use of acetone. Similarly, CISe0.8–ZnS0.2 NCs were obtained by loading CuI (19.0 mg, 0.1 mmol), In(OAc)3 (29.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) and Zn(OAc)2 (11.0 mg, 0.05 mmol) into the flask together with 4 mL of OAm, followed by the injection of Se and S precursors mixture stock solution (obtained by dissolving 0.25 mmol selenium powder and 0.05 mmol sulfur powder in 1 mL DPP) into the reaction mixture at 180 °C. CISe0.7–ZnS0.3 NCs were prepared by increasing the amount of Zn(OAc)2 (0.1 mmol) and sulfur powder (0.1 mmol). The final element ratio is determined by the ICP analysis.
Immobilization of QDs onto TiO2 film electrodes and construction of solar cells
TiO2 mesoporous films (9.0 ± 0.5 μm transparent layer together with 6.0 ± 0.5 μm light scattering layer) were prepared according to a reported method.40,41 Ligand exchange procedure was accomplished to make the initial OAm-capped oil-soluble QDs water-soluble with the use of a bifunctional capping ligand MPA.14,42 The MPA capped water-soluble QDs were attached to the TiO2 mesoporous film by pipetting the QD aqueous solution onto the film and leaving it stationary for 2 h. A ZnS barrier layer was overcoated on the sensitized photoanodes by alternately dipping the electrode into 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solutions for 4 cycles.25 Finally, the QDs-sensitized solar cells were fabricated with a Sandwich configuration by assembling the sensitized TiO2 photoanode and brass based Cu2S counter electrode with a binder clip and separated by a 60 μm Scotch spacer. Polysulfide electrolyte solution with composition of 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S powder and 0.2 M KCl was then injected into the cell device.
Characterization
Transition electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired on a JEOL JEM-2100 instrument. The absorption and PL emission spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600, and a Cary Eclipse (Varian) spectrophotometer, respectively. Powder X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) was obtained using a Siemens D5005 X-ray powder diffractometer, equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Thermo Elemental IRIS 1000) was used to identify the composition information of the QDs. The photovoltaic properties, J–V curves of the QDSCs, were measured by Keithley 2400 source meter equipped with a 150 W AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Oriel, model no. 94022A). Calibration was taken by an NREL standard Si solar cell to set the power of the simulated solar light to 100 mW cm−2. During the measurement, the photoactive area was defined by a shading mask of 0.237 cm2. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured by a Keithley 2000 multimeter with illumination of a 300 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Product DK240 monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium). EIS was measured under dark conditions at different forward bias ranged from 0 V to −0.55 V, applying a 20 mV AC sinusoidal signal over the constant applied bias with the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. In OCVD measurements, samples were illuminated by a white LED with intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the dependence of photovoltage on time was recorded after switch-off of the light.
3. Results and discussion
Optical properties of CISe and CISe–ZnS QDs
A modified literature approach was adopted for the preparation of a high-quality CISe (3.5 ± 0.4 nm) and CISe–ZnS (3.8 ± 0.3 nm) QDs,35 in which the anion precursors with higher reactivity, Se–DPP and S–DPP, were adopted to react with the cation precursors in OAm media at high temperature. Appealing results of the absorption information were obtained, as shown in the absorption spectra (Fig. 1a), with the absorption onset extending to 900 nm, which suggest the superior light-harvesting capacity for application in PV devices. With the variation of the constituent ratio of CISe to ZnS, a series of alloyed (CISe)1−x–(ZnS)x QDs with tunable band gap were attained and the x values have been verified by ICP analysis, giving a Cu/In/Se composition of 1:1.1:2.1 (near the stoichiometric ratio 1:1:2), and CISe/ZnS composition of 0.8:0.2 and 0.7:0.3 approximately (CISe0.8–ZnS0.2 and CISe0.7–ZnS0.3), which differs a little from the nominal elemental ratio used in the synthesis due to their reactivity discrepancy. XRD results indicated that all the CISe and (CISe)1−x–(ZnS)x QDs exhibit chalcopyrite structure (JCPDS: no. 40-1487) as shown in Fig. 1c. According to the extrapolation of Tauc plot (Fig. 1a inset), bandgap value of the three typical QDs can be determined as 1.37 eV (CISe), 1.41 eV (CISe0.8–ZnS0.2), and 1.48 eV (CISe0.7–ZnS0.3).

In addition to band gap tuning, alloying CISe QDs with ZnS constituent also brings forward the reduction of surface defect state and the enhancement of the physiochemical stability of the resulting alloyed QDs. From the optical spectra, we can find that with the incorporation of ZnS constituent into the plain CISe QDs, both the absorption and PL emission spectra of the resultant (CISe)1−x–(ZnS)x QDs show a blue-shift. Based on this finding we can consider that the formed (CISe)1−x–(ZnS)x QDs are in a homogeneous alloy structure, or a gradient alloy structure, with ZnS configuration. Furthermore, as we incorporated ZnS constituent into the original CISe QDs, the PL intensity of the resultant QDs steadily increased, which can be seen from Fig. 1b. This is the indication of the reduced density of surface defect state. We also observed that the synthesized organic phase (CISe)1−x–(ZnS)x QDs could be stored for nearly two months without PL intensity quenching, which is considerably improved in comparison with CISe QDs with PL intensity quenched to half of initial value in one week. On the other hand, this is the proof of the ZnS configuration acting as chemical barrier.
Effective deposition of the QDs sensitizers on TiO2 mesoporous film
Increasing the loading amount of the QDs sensitizer on the TiO2 mesoporous film electrode plays a crucial role in boosting PCE of photovoltaic devices. This can be accomplished through an ex situ ligand exchange postsynthesis assembly approach, developed by our own group.14 Our previous work has reported that tethering QDs on TiO2 film electrode through the ex situ ligand exchange route brings forward a high surface coverage (34%), as well as good performance of the resulting QDSCs.14,25 Benefiting from the previous experience, this ex situ ligand exchange approach was employed to immobilize the CISe or CISe–ZnS QDs on the TiO2 film electrode, in which CISe–ZnS QDs simply refers to CISe0.8–ZnS0.2 QDs for convenience. Through the ligand exchange approach, initial OAm-capped oil-soluble QDs were transferred to MPA-capped water-soluble with strong affinity to TiO2 due to the coordination of carboxyl and titanium, and the deposition procedure can be accomplished in less than 2 h. In Fig. 2a, the rather deep color (nearly black) of the sensitized film electrodes indicates high surface coverage of QDs on the TiO2 film; moreover, the strong light harvesting capacity of these QDs sensitizers. Fig. 2b shows the TEM images of CISe–ZnS QD sensitized TiO2 film electrodes. It can be seen that the larger particles (TiO2, about 20–40 nm) were densely covered with smaller monodispersed spherical particles (CISe–ZnS QDs, 3–4 nm), which imparts vivid evidence of the dense and uniform distribution of the QDs onto TiO2 mesoporous film. This outstanding QDs coverage and light absorbing capacity pave the way for excellent performance of the resulting cell devices as discussed below.

Compared with other approaches to tether the QDs onto TiO2 film, for example the in situ chemical bath deposition (CBD), successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) or other routes,16,43–45 this linker-assisted ex situ ligand exchange approach, reveals the advantage of the flexibility to exploit high quality QDs sensitizers, as we successfully employed the alloy configuration of CISe–ZnS QDs to the QDSCs. Furthermore, utilizing small-sized CISe-based QDs with high affinity of short ligand (MPA) resulted in better penetration of QDs into TiO2 matrix and high coverage of the sensitizers. After this ligand-assisted ex situ assembly approach, we have achieved outstanding photovoltaic performance of the CISe-based cells with the following assembling work, as is supported by the electrochemical measurements.
Photovoltaic performance
In the following fabrication procedure, the sensitized film was further passivated by a thin layer of ZnS through the SILAR route, which was confirmed to be quite an effective method to prevent the charge recombination in QDSCs.46 After the deposition of the ZnS layers, the QD-sensitized TiO2 mesoporous film electrode was assembled with Cu2S counter electrode, at which polysulfide electrolyte was filled in between, spaced by a binder clip. To further evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the assembled cell devices, current–voltage characteristics were measured and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3a. Photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE) were obtained from the J–V curves, and the average values of 6 parallel cells together with the values for the champion cell are collected in Table 1. The champion cells of CISe and CISe–ZnS based QDSCs showed an efficiency of 6.02% and 6.79%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are of the highest PCE value in the CISe-based QDSCs and also among the best performances in the entire liquid-junction solar cells.25,28 The high efficiency was the result of the distinguished light harvesting capacity of the sensitizers and effective loading of the QDs sensitizers, which contributed to boost the Jsc to about 22 mA cm−2, as is further discussed in the IPCE result. Moreover, the design of ZnS alloy configuration QDs structure was of great importance to achieve this high PCE value, which is to reduce the charge recombination both from internal of the QDs and at the interface with the electrolyte. This was obviously reflected on the comparison of the Voc, with the averaged Voc value of CISe–ZnS based QDSCs increased to 0.584 V (0.03 V more than that of CISe cells), indicating the significance of the alloying configuration, in light of the less charge recombination and higher charge extraction efficiency. The wide band gap ZnS constituent in the CISe–ZnS QD sensitizer reduces the defects on the surface of the QDs and shields from charge recombination, resulting in higher PCE values.

The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE), which is also termed as external quantum efficiency (EQE), was investigated for these QDSCs. From Fig. 3b, a fairly wide response wavelength range of both CISe and CISe–ZnS cells were displayed, with a surprisingly large absorption onset at more than 1000 nm, which is consistent with the absorption spectra in Fig. 2a. Moreover, both the CISe and CISe–ZnS based cells produced relatively high IPCE values, in which the value of CISe–ZnS based cells peaked at ∼80% and were slightly higher compared to the CISe based ones. It can be deduced that the broad photon response range is the result of narrow bandgap of CISe or CISe–ZnS sensitizers. From the equation: IPCE = LHE × ϕinj × ηcc, in which LHE stands for light-harvesting efficiency, ϕinj for the electron-injection efficiency and ηcc for the charge collection efficiency,47,48 we can infer that the difference of the IPCE value was due to the better charge collecting or electron-injection performance of the CISe–ZnS cells because their LHE (LHE% = 1–10−Abs(λ)) was almost at the same level as indicated by the absorption profile shown in Fig. 2a. By calculating the integral of the incident photon flux density and the IPCE value, calculated Jsc values for CISe and CISe–ZnS cells (21.02 mA cm−2 and 22.55 mA cm−2, respectively) were similar to their measured Jsc listed in Table 1. As another important characteristic of a solar cell, APCE (absorbed photon-to-electron conversion efficiency) was also used to study the conversion of the absorbed photon to current in the external circuit. As is shown in Fig. 3c, in the range of 400 to 700 nm, the CISe–ZnS cells demonstrated a higher APCE value compared to CISe. This reveals that CISe–ZnS cells show better photocurrent conversion efficiency, and from the equation of APCE = IPCE/LHE = ϕinj × ηcc,47,49 the alloy of ZnS with CISe notably improves the performance of the electron collection and/or injection.
Open circuit voltage decay
Open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) analysis was implemented to investigate the different electron recombination processes of these two types of sensitized solar cells, which is a valid method to calculate the electron lifetime from the open circuit voltage decay information. The measurement procedure is referred from the previous reports.50 At the very beginning of the measurement, the cells were illuminated by a white LED with intensity of 100 mW cm−2 to a steady voltage, and then the light was switched off and the open circuit voltage decay information was recorded. From Fig. 4a, it can be observed that the transient Voc values of both cells start stable at their open circuit voltages with the illumination, and continue to decay to nearly 0 V in darkness. However, the decay time of these two cells is prominently different. Apparently, the CISe–ZnS cells exhibit considerably longer decay time than that of the CISe cells. Moreover, the Voc decay rate was a direct reflection of the electron lifetime because the excess electron undergoes recombination with the trap states and oxidative species in electrolyte when the interruption of illumination occurs. The electron lifetime, τn, can be estimated by the equation:  kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the electronic charge.50–52 From Fig. 4b, we can learn that the calculated electron lifetime (τn) of the CISe–ZnS cells was longer than that of CISe cells at the same Voc. This is consistent with the PL results that the PL intensity increased when a certain amount of more ZnS was incorporated into the CIS QDs. Because all devices were treated with a ZnS overlayer by SILAR method to reduce the recombination at the electrode/electrolyte interface,53 we can infer that the slower electron leakage might presumably result from the reduction of the trapping states at the TiO2/CISe–ZnS interface compared to the plain nanocrystals. All these data indicate that the homogeneous or gradient alloy structure of the CISe–ZnS QDs favors the photovoltaic performance of the resulting solar cells in comparison with the plain CISe based QDSCs.

Impedance spectroscopy
Charge transport and recombination dynamics in the mesoporous film electrode were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as is illustrated in the figure of the Nyquist curves (Fig. 5d). We have recorded the EIS at different forward biases, ranging from 0 V to −0.55 V (near the Voc) under dark conditions. Equivalent circuit model was built according to our previous work,12,25 and the results were presented using corrected voltage VF to subtract the effect of the series resistance on the voltage, where VF = Vapp − Vseries.54 In this equation, Vapp stands for the applied voltage during the measurement, and Vseries for voltage drop at series resistance, which was calculated from .55 From Fig. 5a, the chemical capacitances (Cμ) of the sensitized photoelectrode were found to be similar for both CISe cells and CISe–ZnS cells. As Cμ revealed the electron density change under a small potential drop,56 we can be informed that the photoelectrodes of the CISe and CISe–ZnS cells share similar electron density because the difference of the two sensitizers to influence the conduction band of TiO2 was not dominant. However, the disparity between the Rrec (recombination resistance) of CISe and CISe–ZnS cells was apparent, as shown in Fig. 5b the Rrec values of CISe–ZnS cell are higher than those of CISe cell in all VF. This is evidently indicative of the suppressed electron recombination of the CISe–ZnS cells, mainly due to the configuration of the alloying with ZnS which worked as obstructions against electron recombination in the interface of QDs with electrolyte. The result of the dark current is well in accordance with the Rrec result, as is exhibited in Fig. 5c that the value of CISe–ZnS cells was all below that of the CISe cells at the same potential. The information of less generated back electrons also indicates the blocking of the charge recombination. Further comparison of Nyquist plots for CISe and CISe–ZnS cells at the forward bias of −0.55 V are presented in Fig. 5d. The larger semiarc of the CISe–ZnS cells, compared with the one of the CISe cells, suggests that charge transfer resistance between the photoelectrode and the polysulfide electrolyte was considerably larger. The result of the calculated electron lifetime, τn, agrees with the OCVD measurement results, showing that CISe–ZnS cells have lower charge recombination rate between the photoelectrode and the surroundings (Table 2). With respect to other charge recombination hindering approaches, such as core–shell structure engineered via ion exchange route,25,28 the CISe–ZnS alloy structuring in our work, exhibited a compelling performance in reducing charge recombination and improving the power conversion efficiency; moreover, this is also a more convenient way of one pot synthesis. All these results confirm that the alloy configuration in CISe–ZnS QDs is an effective route to resist charge recombination, more importantly, with the intrinsic properties of the QDs, it eventually contributes to the achievement of excellent photovoltaic performance.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a kind of high efficiency “green” CISe-based QDSC has been successfully developed. The intrinsic NIR absorbing properties of CISe and CISe–ZnS alloyed QDs make them ideal candidates in fabricating a photovoltaic device, and more interestingly, suppressed charge recombination and concomitant better photovoltaic performance were obtained in the CISe–ZnS QD based QDSCs. This demonstrates the outstanding architecture of the obtained CISe–ZnS alloy QDs in serving as light-harvesting sensitizer material in QDSC. The retarded charge recombination process was revealed by OCVD measurement and impedance spectroscopy. Benefiting from the effective linker-assisted ex situ ligand exchange approach to achieve high loading of the QDs onto TiO2 photoanode, and the promising alloy configuration, these CISe–ZnS based QDSCs showed excellent photovoltaic properties with an efficiency of 6.79%, which is among the best performances for liquid-junction QDSCs and also demonstrates the comparable photovoltaic performance for the “green” CISe QDs sensitizing materials to the toxic cadmium and lead chalcogenide QD materials.
