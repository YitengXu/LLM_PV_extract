    , Accepted 8th May 2018First published on 8th May 2018AbstractUnlocking the potential of the hydrogen economy requires breakthroughs in production, storage, distribution, and infrastructure. Here we demonstrate an in vitro artificial enzymatic pathway that can produce hydrogen at extremely high rates by splitting water energized by carbohydrates (e.g., starch). This fifteen hyperthermophilic enzymes pathway comprises ATP-free starch phosphorylation, an NAD-based pentose phosphate pathway, and a biomimetic electron transport chain consisting of a diaphorase, an electron mediator benzyl viologen (BV), and a [NiFe]-hydrogenase, whereas fast electron transfer was facilitated by utilizing a BV-conjugated diaphorase. The highest reaction rate of 530 mmol H2 per L per h was accomplished at 80 °C. Two NAD-conjugated dehydrogenases were further applied to enable nine-day hydrogen production with a total turnover number of NAD of over 100000, along with hyperthermophilic enzymes. This biohydrogen production system characterized by the highest chemical-energy efficiency and an exceptionally-high reaction rate addresses challenges associated with cost-effective, distributed hydrogen production, off-board hydrogen storage, and infrastructure.
Introduction
Hydrogen gas (H2) is a clean energy carrier likely to replace fossil fuel-derived liquid fuels, due to higher energy conversion efficiencies, nearly zero pollutants to end users, and more energy storage density than rechargeable batteries.1,2 Current means of thermochemical H2 production from fossil fuels are cost-competitive,3 but they cannot be scaled down due to the economy of scale.4 Distributed H2 is costly when transportation costs are included. It is highly expected that green, cost-competitive, distributed H2 will be produced via water splitting powered by solar energy directly or indirectly.3,5–11 Hydrogen production via high-speed water splitting may be energized by renewable carbohydrates (e.g., starch and biomass, a point energy source) with in vitro artificial enzymatic pathways11–14 rather than energized by nonpoint energy sources (e.g., insolation with an average energy flux of ∼200 W m−2).15 This method has several benefits, such as low H2 transportation costs, easy H2 harvesting, and low capital expenditure of distributed H2 generation bioreactors.4
Microorganisms that naturally produce H2 have evolved three major electron transport chains (ETCs) to do so. Photobiological H2 production by microalgae is catalyzed by hydrogenase, which receives electrons from the NADPH that is generated from photosystem I via the reduced ferredoxin catalyzed by ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR),16,17 but it suffers from very low volumetric productivity. Microbial dark fermentation rapidly converts glucose to pyruvate with the formation of either formate (for example, Enterobacter spp.) or reduced ferredoxin (for example, Clostridium spp.) as intermediate electron carriers,18 yielding two moles of H2 per glucose. In Clostridium spp., another two moles of hydrogen per glucose can be produced from an NADH-dependent hydrogenase. This NADH-to-H2 reaction, however, is thermodynamically unfavorable under standard conditions because the midpoint potential of the H+/H2 redox couple (E0′ = −414 mV) is more negative than that of NADH (E0′ = −320 mV). This reaction occurs only under low hydrogen pressures.18 However, some fermentative anaerobes have a so-called bifurcating hydrogenase19 that couples the exergonic production of H2 using reduced ferredoxin as the electron donor to the endergonic production of H2 using NADH as the electron donor, allowing maximum H2 production from glucose oxidation (i.e., four H2 per glucose). Electron bifurcating enzymes are known to be widespread in anaerobic microbes.19 As a result, the theoretical H2 yields of dark fermentation are two or four H2 per glucose, called the Thauer limit, depending on the catabolic pathways and fermentation conditions.18,20 Although intensive efforts to develop H2-producing microorganisms by metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have been made,18,21 they cannot break this limit due to the basic bioenergetics and thermodynamics of living organisms.

In vitro enzymatic H2 production systems have been demonstrated to split water, energized by carbohydrates and catalyzed by enzymatic pathways comprising more than ten enzymes.11–14 This approach is one of the most promising means for distributed H2 production because it achieves the theoretical yield of hydrogen generation, i.e., 12 moles of H2 from one mole of hexose along with water, with potentially-high volumetric productivities.2,20 Because carbohydrates are produced through plant photosynthesis, this indirect water splitting energized by carbohydrates is nearly carbon-neutral in terms of the whole life cycle. Recent efforts have expanded the types of carbohydrates, such as, glycogen,13 starch,12 and biomass sugars.11 These efforts have also led to great increases in volumetric productivity,11 as well as decreases in biocatalyst costs through utilization of thermostable enzymes with facile heat treatment purification,22,23 enzyme immobilization,24 and replacement of costly coenzymes.25–27 However, these in vitro enzymatic pathways are based on prohibitively expensive and unstable NADPH, which is generated from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). A major breakthrough is urgently needed to replace NADP with the much more stable and less costly NAD,20,26,27 and that was one of the goals of this study.
The first NAD-dependent enzymatic pathway that splits water for ultra-rapid hydrogen gas production (Fig. 1b) was designed to replace the NADP-dependent PPP11–14 (Fig. 1a). Synergetic advances in the non-fermentative pathway, coenzyme engineering, biomimetic NAD-based ETC (Fig. 1b), and fast electron transfer between DI and BV (Fig. 1c), lead to ultra-rapid volumetric productivity of over one gram of H2 per liter per hour. Furthermore, the construction of two NAD-conjugated dehydrogenases (Fig. 1d) extended the total turn-over number (TTN) of NAD to more than 100000 at 80 °C.

NAD-based PPP
The PPP generates two moles of NADPH from one mole of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) using two dehydrogenases, glucose 6-phosphate (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate (6PGDH), respectively. The coenzyme preference of 6PGDH from Thermotoga maritima was rationally engineered to change its specificity from NADP+ to NAD+.25 To develop the first hyperthermophilic NAD-dependent PPP, we had to change the coenzyme preference of the T. maritima G6PDH from NADP+ to NAD+. An in silico homology model of T. maritima G6PDH was generated based on a G6PDH template of a mesophilic bacterium Leuconostoc mesenteroides (PDB: 1DPG, 35% identity). According to the three-dimensional structure of TmG6PDH with bound NADP+ (Fig. 2a), key amino acid residues responsible for binding the 2′-phosphate group (S33, A64, and R65T66 positions) were altered by saturation mutagenesis. Three mutant libraries containing random mutations (NNK codons) at positions of 33, 64 or 65/66 were expressed in E. coli Top10 (Fig. S1, ESI†). Three TmG6PDH mutant libraries were screened for their enhanced NAD+-dependent activities based on the tetranitroblue tetrazolium double-layer screening method28 (Fig. S2, ESI†). There are several positive mutants for Libraries S33 and R65/T66 but no positive mutant for Library A64 (Fig. 2b). Positive colonies were re-screened (Fig. 2b) and the mutants exhibiting highest activities were S33E and R65M/T66S. Finally, a combination of positive mutants resulted in the most active enzyme (mG6PDH – S33E/R65M/T66S) (Fig. 2b). mG6PDH had a 30-fold decrease in its Km for NAD+ and had a 7.7-fold increase in its Km for NADP+ but no significant change in its kcat value for NAD+ (Table S1, ESI†). The relative (NAD+vs. NADP+) catalytic efficiency ratio (kcat/Km) of mG6PDH for NAD+ and NADP+ increased approximately 250-fold compared to that of wild-type G6PDH (Table S1, ESI†). Thus, mG6PDH showed comparable coenzyme specificities for NAD+ and NADP+.

NAD-based ETC
H2 production via direct electron transfer from NADPH to H2 is catalyzed by the NADP-specific soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase (SHI) from Pyrococcus furiosus. A biomimetic ETC comprising an NADPH rubredoxin oxidoreductase (NROR) from P. furiosus, which uses NADPH to reduce the abiotic electron mediator BV, was introduced to greatly improve H2 production rates of SHI.12,29 When NAD+ was used to replace NADP+, a new transhydrogenase was needed to be discovered for rapidly catalyzing electron transfer from NADH to BV because NADP+-dependent NROR exhibits a very low activity for NAD+ (Fig. 3c). The 3D-docking structure for NROR with NADP+ bound (Fig. 3a) suggested that the electrostatically positive-charged amino acids (H165 and R166) of NROR could stabilize the binding with the 2′-phosphate of NADP+. Because diaphorase (DI) is a transhydrogenase that prefers NAD+ to NADP+ as an coenzyme,30 an NAD+-specific DI was searched from hyperthermophilic microorganisms. A new DI, which was annotated as a probable nitrite reductase subunit (KEGG) in T. maritima, showed 53% identity and 71% similarity with NROR. It has a negative-charged amino acid (E165) in the nicotinamide cofactor binding site, suggesting its NAD+ preference (Fig. 3b). The coenzyme specificity of T. maritima DI for BV reduction was reversed compared to P. furiosus NROR (Fig. 3c).
 Fig. 3  Simulated docking structure between NROR and NADP+ (a), simulated docking structure of DI with NAD+ and FAD (b), comparisons of the transhydrogenase activities of NROR and DI from NAD(P)H to the oxidized electron mediator benzyl viologen (BV2+) at 50 °C (c), and profiles of H2 evolution from 0.1 M G6P at 50 °C (d). The enzyme cocktails were (1) mG6PDH + SHI; (2) mG6PDH + SHI + DI (0.1 mM) + BV (0.6 mM); and (3) mG6PDH + SHI + BCV-DI (0.1 mM). 
An NAD+-based ETC was designed to utilize three enzymes (i.e., mG6PDH, DI, and SHI) to oxidize G6P and evolve H2 with NAD+ and BV as electron carriers (Fig. 1b). The proof-of-concept experiments were conducted on 100 mM G6P at 50 °C. In a negative control experiment with a mixture of mG6PDH and SHI, a very low volumetric hydrogen productivity was observed with a long lag period, whereas the maximum rate was 7 mmol H2 per L per h after three hours (Fig. 3d). With the addition of DI and BV, the maximum volumetric productivity increased by five-fold to 36 mmol H2 per L per h (Fig. 3d). This result suggested that the first NAD-based biomimetic ETC drastically increased the volumetric productivity of H2.
BV-conjugated DI for fast electron transfer
Inspired by natural spatially-organized complexes for facilitating rapid electron transfer among adjacent enzymes, the BV-conjugated DI (called BCV-DI) was synthesized from benzyl (4-carboxymethyl)benzyl viologen (BCV) with a cross-linking reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Fig. 4a). The BV-conjugated DI led to an approximately 2.5-times higher NAD(P)+-dependent BV reduction rate compared to that of a mixture of DI and BV (Table S2, ESI†). In the case of mG6PDH, DI, and SHI systems with 100 mM G6P, the use of BV-conjugated DI instead of DI and BV (Fig. 1c) doubled the volumetric productivity to 67 mmol H2 per L per h at 50 °C compared to the BV-based ETC case (Fig. 3d). These results suggested increased electron transfer between DI and BV in this conjugate.
 Fig. 4  Preparation steps for BCV-DI (a) and the NAD-dependent H2 evolution profiles (b) from 0.2 M G6P at 80 °C via the enzyme cocktails (i.e., mG6PDH + SHI + BCV-DI; mG6PDH + m6PGDH + SHI + BCV-DI; and mG6PDH + m6PGDH + 6PGL + SHI + BCV-DI). 25 μM BCV-DI (1 g L−1) was added for all reactions. 
The use of hyperthermophilic enzymes could have multiple benefits. These include (1) increasing specific activities of the enzymes, in particular SHI from the organism with the highest growth temperature (e.g., 100 °C for P. furiosus); (2) decreasing H2 solubility in the aqueous reactants to mitigate H2 inhibition; (3) eliminating the chances of microbial contamination; and (4) decreasing the viscosity of the aqueous solution for better mass transfer. An enzymatic hydrogen production reaction with mG6PDH, SHI and BV-conjugated DI led to the peak volumetric productivity of 220 mmol H2 per L per h at 80 °C (Fig. 4b). When NAD-preferred 6PGDH from T. maritima (m6PGDH)25 was added, the volumetric productivity increased to 370 mmol H2 per L per h. The addition of 6-phosphoglucono-lactonase (6PGL) from T. maritima31 further increased the volumetric productivity to 450 mmol H2 per L per h (Fig. 4b).
Ultra-rapid H2 production from starch
This artificial enzymatic pathway (Fig. 5a) has four modules: (1) G6P generation from starch and phosphate catalyzed by α-glucan phosphorylase followed by phosphoglucomutase (PGM); (2) the generation of two moles of NADH from one mole of G6P catalyzed by mG6PDH, 6PGL, and m6PGDH via the NAD-based oxidative PPP; (3) H2 production from NADH via the biomimetic ETC containing BCV-DI and SHI; and (4) the regeneration of five moles of G6P from six moles of ribulose 5-phosphate via the non-oxidative PPP and the partial gluconeogenesis pathway. As a result, one mole of the anhydroglucose unit in the starch plus seven moles of water can produce 12 moles of H2 and six moles of carbon dioxide (eqn (1)). In contrast to the previous starch-to-H2 pathways,12,13 three major improvements have been made. They are: (1) the demonstration of the first NAD-based PPP (Fig. 5a), (2) a biomimetic NAD-based ETC based on a BCV-DI (Fig. 1c), and (3) the first set of fifteen hyperthermophilic enzymes that were stable at 80 °C. Five hyperthermophilic enzymes (i.e., PGI,32 PGM,33 m6PGDH,25 mG6PDH (here), and DI) were used for in vitro biohydrogen generation at 80 °C (Table 1). C6H10O5(aq) + 7H2O(l) = 12H2(g) + 6CO2(g)(1)

Fig. 5b shows the profiles of H2 evolution catalyzed by the in vitro artificial enzymatic pathway with starch (i.e., 0.1 and 0.4 M glucose equivalents) at 80 °C (Table 1). The maximum volumetric productivities of H2 were 360 mmol H2 per L per h with 0.1 M maltodextrin and 530 mmol H2 per L per h with 0.4 M maltodextrin, respectively (Fig. 5b). When 0.4 M maltodextrin was used, more G6P was generated, resulting in higher volumetric productivities (Fig. 5b). Maltodextrin is a slowly-utilized substrate, resulting in a 2.5 hour plateau at the maximum volumetric productivity.
Long-term H2 production
Long-term enzymatic H2 production is important to demonstrate the feasibility of future scale-up but NAD(P) is infamously unstable, especially at evaluated temperatures.26,34 To solve this problem, NAD-conjugated mG6PDH and NAD-conjugated m6PGDH were constructed by using NAD–poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)–enzyme conjugates.35,36 Specific activities of these two dehydrogenases were not greatly changed by the formation of NAD–PEG–enzyme conjugates (Fig. S3, ESI†). These NAD–PEG–enzyme conjugates exhibited comparable or even better performances for hydrogen generation without the addition of free NAD (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†).
A long-term reaction was conducted by the repeated addition of starch (0.4 M in glucose equivalent) at 80 °C with the fifteen hyperthermophilic enzymes including NAD-conjugated mG6PDH and NAD-conjugated m6PGDH (Table S4, ESI†) (Fig. 6). The control reaction was carried out by using free NAD+ and two non-conjugated dehydrogenases. The experiment with NAD-dehydrogenase conjugates exhibited repeated hydrogen peak formation for each substrate addition and its production lasted for up to nine days, whereas the control reaction stopped producing hydrogen after two days although there were excess substrate and active enzymes (Fig. 6a). Approximately 109000 moles of H2 were produced per 1 mole of the conjugated NAD+ at 80 °C, while the total turn-over number (TTN) of free NAD+ was approximately 5700 (Fig. 6b). The use of conjugated NAD enabled a nearly 20-fold improvement in TTN and decreased enzymatic production cost greatly (Table S3, ESI†).

The experiments were carried out in 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) at 80 °C, as described in Fig. 5. 
Discussion
Three major improvements of this study in comparison to the previous study12 were (1) a biomimetic NAD-based ETC involving an abiotic electron mediator BV and a novel DI that mimic ferredoxin and FNR, respectively; (2) utilization of the first set of 15 hyperthermophilic enzymes and NAD-conjugated dehydrogenases, allowing production of hydrogen at 80 °C for up to nine days; and (3) a BCV-DI facilitating the efficient electron transfer reaction in the conjugate. These improvements were important for (1) achieving the highest production rate of biohydrogen (Fig. 5 and 6a), (2) producing hydrogen for nine days at 80 °C (Fig. 6), and (3) decreasing the estimated hydrogen production costs by nearly 20-fold by using thermostable enzymes and conjugated NAD rather than NADP as used previously (Table S3, ESI†).
Increasing the volumetric productivity of H2 is one of the most important criteria for distributed H2 production because it is closely related to the land occupied, a hidden cost for energy harvesting, plus the equipment size with accompanying capital expenditure.4 A volumetric productivity of 530 mmol of H2 per L per h is the highest biohydrogen production rate ever reported, equivalent to a glucose utilization rate of 7.95 g L−1 h−1, which is higher than that of typical ethanol yeast fermentation.37 With a volumetric productivity of >1.0 g H2 per L per h achieved, an anaerobic bioreactor of 62.5 m3 can produce 1500 kg H2 per day. Considering typical sizes for anaerobic bioreactors in beer fermentation and alcohol production, it is very feasible to construct an 80 m3 bioreactor in distributed H2-refilling stations that can make 1500 kg H2 per day. In contrast, the same solar energy-to-H2 production capacity plant requires more than 100000 m2 of land, assuming a 12% solar-energy-to-H2 efficiency and given an average insolation of 200 W m−2 for direct water spitting regardless of the photobiological and photochemical methods.17,38 Such large land use plus hidden H2-harvesting costs raise the question of whether direct solar water splitting for H2 production could be widely used.5,39 This advanced biological water splitting energized by carbohydrate requires a much larger land area than hydrogen production with photoelectrochemical water splitting5,6,8,10 when considering the land required for plant photosynthesis. Plant photosynthesis has very low solar-energy-to-biomass efficiencies of ∼1% for dedicated plants and ∼0.2% for the global average.15 However, the use of natural plant photosynthesis and the use of the available carbohydrate as the enriched chemical energy for hydrogen production has two advantages: the abundant renewable biomass (carbohydrate) resource, more than five times the global human energy consumption; and the available or less-costly infrastructure of carbohydrate processing and distribution.
After a decade of continuous efforts, more than a 1000-fold increase in the volumetric productivity of H2 from starch has been achieved from 0.48 mmol H2 per L per h.13 Such dramatic volumetric productivity enhancements are attributed to numerous aspects, including (1) the use of hyperthermophilic enzymes that allow increased reaction temperatures, thereby increasing enzyme activities and decreasing H2 solubility and H2 inhibition, (2) the introduction of biomimetic NAD-based ETC to facilitate electron transfer (Fig. 1b), (3) the construction of BV-conjugated DI for fast electron transfer (Fig. 3), (4) the optimization of enzyme ratios by mathematical modeling,11 and (5) the use of highly active enzyme BioBricks (for example, aldolase40). It is anticipated that the volumetric productivity of H2 could be enhanced by another order of magnitude in a few years by (1) developing more efficient enzyme complexes, including SHI and dehydrogenases,41 (2) the use of small and more stable biomimetic coenzymes for better mass transfer,26,27 (3) the use of enzymes with higher specific activities, for example, the replacement of [NiFe]-hydrogenase SHI with a more active [FeFe]-hydrogenase,42 and (4) the construction of thermostable multiple-cascade enzyme machines such as the Krebs cycle metabolon.43
The first thermophilic NAD-based PPP was developed by engineering the cofactor specificity of G6PDH and 6PGDH. Because NROR is not able to efficiently transfer electrons from NADH to BV,29 a new hyperthermophilic DI of T. maritima was discovered to implement the first NAD-based biomimetic ETC (Fig. 1b), although previously annotated as a putative nitrite reductase subunit. The biomimetic ETC had some notable advantages over the natural ferredoxin-based ETC, including (1) the BV-conjugated DI was thermostable (even at 80 °C); (2) both DI and (oxidized) BV are insensitive to O2, while many ferredoxins and/or FNR are O2 labile; and (3) the BV-conjugated DI may be used for numerous types of hydrogenases, while FNR and ferredoxins have higher selectivity for their interacting partners. In addition, economic analysis suggests that the replacement of NADP with conjugated NAD is the most important cost factor to decrease in vitro H2 production costs when hyperthermophilic enzymes were used (Table S3, ESI†).20 Also, this NAD-based PPP could also be very useful in in vivo synthetic biology projects by balancing coenzyme supply and consumption.44–46
There are a few carbon-neutral scenarios for generating kinetic energy in wheels from solar energy (Fig. 7). When liquid alcohols are chosen for energy storage compounds, several challenges are the low conversion efficiency from CO2/solar energy regardless of biocatalysts or photocatalysts, high product separation costs, and the low energy efficiencies of internal combustion engines.47,48 Similarly, direct solar water splitting for hydrogen production is plagued by low conversion efficiencies, high harvesting costs for hydrogen, and the low storage density of hydrogen.3,5–7 Solar cells can address the solar-to-electricity efficiency and energy harvesting, but this system suffers from the low electricity storage densities of rechargeable batteries. The use of starch, a natural energy storage compound, which can be isolated from plant seeds or even made from lignocellulosic biomass,49 is an out-of-the-box solution for green hydrogen production and a high-density H2 storage carrier (i.e., up to 14.8% H2 mass).12 However, this advanced biological water splitting approach could have its weaknesses: (1) relatively high production costs (e.g., 10.6–17.7 per GJ of hydrogen based on carbohydrate only) mainly due to the high prices of carbohydrates (e.g., $0.18 (future)–$0.30 (current) per kg of carbohydrate);2 (2) the low energy efficiency solar-energy-to-carbohydrate in plant photosynthesis (e.g., theoretical efficiencies of 4.6–6% for C3 and C4 plants, an average efficiency of ∼1% for dedicated plants),15 and (3) large amounts of water consumption and land usage for plant cultivation.15 Beyond green hydrogen production, this study implies that the use of renewable carbohydrate as a high-density hydrogen storage compound could address challenges associated with off-board hydrogen storage and costly infrastructure for the hydrogen economy.

More details of the energy efficiency analysis are available elsewhere.50 
Conclusions
This hydrogen-producing study based on advanced biological water splitting energized by starch featured an up to 1000-fold enhancement in the volumetric productivity of hydrogen, achieving a milestone of more than one gram of hydrogen per liter per hour. The use of the first set of 15 hyperthermophilic enzymes and two NAD-conjugated dehydrogenases enabled this in vitro enzyme cocktail to produce hydrogen for nine days at 80 °C without the supplementary addition of enzymes and coenzymes. This biological water splitting in darkness could be a promising solution to the distributed production of continuous green H2 by utilizing the evenly-distributed renewable carbohydrates.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Scheme of the direct NADP-based electron transfer from NADPH to H2via soluble hydrogenase I (SHI), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) (a); scheme of the NAD-based ETC from NADH to H2 comprising NAD-dependent glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (mG6PDH), NAD-dependent 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (m6PGDH), 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL), diaphorase (DI), and BV (b); scheme of an alternative NAD-based ETC from NADH to H2 comprising mG6PDH, m6PGDH, 6PGL, and BCV-DI (c); and scheme of the NAD-based ETC from NADH to H2 comprising NAD-conjugated mG6PDH, NAD-conjugated m6PGDH, 6PGL, and BCV-DI (d).	 

 	Fig. 2  Coenzyme engineering of G6PDH with a coenzyme preference from NADP+ to NAD+. Simulated docking structure between G6PDH and NADP+ (a) and redox-dye-based screening plates for three mutant libraries (i.e., S33, A64 and R65/T66) and positive clones identified on screening plates followed by their combination – the best mutant mG6PDH – S33E/R65M/T66S (b).	 

 	Fig. 3  Simulated docking structure between NROR and NADP+ (a), simulated docking structure of DI with NAD+ and FAD (b), comparisons of the transhydrogenase activities of NROR and DI from NAD(P)H to the oxidized electron mediator benzyl viologen (BV2+) at 50 °C (c), and profiles of H2 evolution from 0.1 M G6P at 50 °C (d). The enzyme cocktails were (1) mG6PDH + SHI; (2) mG6PDH + SHI + DI (0.1 mM) + BV (0.6 mM); and (3) mG6PDH + SHI + BCV-DI (0.1 mM).
