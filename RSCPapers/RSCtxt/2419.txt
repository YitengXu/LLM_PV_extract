    , Accepted 22nd August 2022First published on 24th August 2022AbstractIn this paper, the thermoelectric, spin-dependent optical and quantum transport properties of a two-dimensional (2D) Co2Se3 monolayer are investigated using first principles calculations. The stability of the Co2Se3 monolayer is confirmed by energy-cohesive calculations and phonon dispersion analysis. According to electronic and magnetic calculations, Co2Se3 is a Dirac half-metal (DHM) with several Dirac cones around the Fermi level in the spin-down channel and exhibits intrinsic ferromagnetism with a high Curie temperature. Investigation of the thermoelectric properties shows that the Co2Se3 monolayer with ZT ∼ 1 at low temperature (T < 300 K) to medium temperature (500 < T < 700 K) can be introduced as a suitable candidate for thermoelectric applications. Spin-dependent optical calculations indicate that the maximum reflection and absorption for 2D Co2Se3 are in the energy ranges of 0–1 and 12–8 eV, respectively, so this structure is a suitable wave reflector in the infrared range (IR) and a good absorbent in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) range. On the other hand, the unique feature of Co2Se3 encouraged us to study the spin-dependent transport properties. A spin-down current as large as 27(30) μA passing through in the x(y)-direction, while the spin-up current passing through the scattering region up to 1.2 (1) V is approximately zero, induces 100% spin filtering properties in the Co2Se3 monolayer, so this structure has great potential for application in spintronic nano-devices.
1 Introduction
The synthesis of two-dimensional transition metal chalcogenides (2D-TMCs) by methods such as chemical vapor deposition and exfoliation of their bulk crystals has been the main incentive to investigate the properties of 2D-TMCs in recent years.1–6 TMCs have the stoichiometric composition MyXz, where M and X represent elements of transition metals and chalcogenides, respectively, and y and z are integers. TMCs exhibit a wide range of electrical properties from insulation to superconductivity, and show practical applications in electronics, thermoelectrics, optoelectronics, and spintronics.7–10 The thermoelectric effect represents the direct conversion of the temperature difference to the electric potential difference (Seebeck effect) or, conversely, the conversion of the electric potential difference to heating or cooling (Peltier effect).11 Although the efficiency of this type of conversion is usually low, they have been considered because of their reversibility. Seebeck-based thermoelectric devices can be used for any type of heat conversion, such as heat dissipation or solar energy. The potential of a material for thermoelectric applications is expressed in terms of the figure of merit (ZT). The goal of all research in this area is to increase ZT as much as possible, and thermoelectric devices will outperform their mechanical counterparts if the value of ZT exceeds one at room temperature.12,13 With the advent of nanotechnology and the reduction of material dimensions, the value of ZT has increased dramatically due to quantum constraints and size-dependent electronic properties.14,15 In recent years, extensive studies have been performed on the thermoelectric properties of TMCs. Guangqian Ding et al. reported a ZT of about 0.94 for p-type 1T-SnSe2 at 600 K.7 Dan Qin et al. achieved a ZT of 1.1 at room temperature for p-type PdSe2.16 A ZT value of 0.8 was calculated using density functional theory and the Boltzmann equation for PtSe2 monolayer at 900 K.17 Zhang et al. studied the thermoelectric properties of TiS3 monolayer and reported a high ZT value of 3.1 at room temperature.18ZT values of 0.38 and 0.58 were observed for n-type 1H-NiSe2 and 1H-PdTe2 monolayers at 300 K, respectively.19 H. Y. Lv et al., by applying a biaxial tensile strain of about 6% on a p-type ZrS2 monolayer, obtained ZT ∼ 2.4 at 300 K, which was 4.3 times larger than that of the unstrained structure.20 Using density functional theory (DFT) and two different approximations, ZT values of 0.11 at 500 K and ∼1 at ∼1000 K were reported for monolayer MoS2.21,22
Also, due to the dependence of the optical properties of nanomaterials on the electronic structure, the study of two-dimensional nanomaterials, including TMCs, to find new applications in optical and optoelectronic industries is another field of study that has been considered in recent years. Potential applications of TMCs include ultrathin photovoltaic devices, solar-driven photocatalytic water splitting, photodetectors, phototransistors, nano-optical waveguide polarizers, and third-generation solar photovoltaics.23–29
Another application of TMCs is spintronics, which is the science of using the spin of electrons in electronics. High-speed data transfer due to the presence of up and down spins in electrons and lower energy consumption are some advantages of spintronics.30,31 Most two-dimensional nanomaterials do not exhibit magnetic properties. Although the application of defects and strains induces ferromagnetic properties in these structures, their instability is one of the challenges of their application.32 2d intrinsic ferromagnetic Dirac half-metal materials with high Curie temperature (TC), which have Dirac-like cones around the Fermi level in one of their spin channels, have unique physical properties such as Dirac massless fermions, high spin polarization, and excellent transport properties, which have made them promising candidates in spintronics. It is important to mention that Dirac half-metal materials with multiple Dirac cones around the Fermi level have higher carrier transmission efficiency, which leads to lower energy consumption and higher transfer speed in spintronic devices.33–35 Therefore, the identification of Dirac half-metals with high TC and the theoretical and experimental studies of this class of materials can be effective in the development of spintronics. Experimental studies on CrI3 monolayer (TC ∼ 45 K), Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers, and VSe2 and MnSe2 monolayers and reporting of the ferromagnetic properties in these nanomaterials have paved the way for extensive theoretical and experimental studies to find intrinsic two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials with high Curie temperatures.36–39 Using ab initio studies, the half-metal ferromagnetism properties of 2D TcS2 nanosheets (TC > 800 K), 2D Co2S2 (TC = 404 K), Cr2Se3 (TC = 480 K), Cr2S3 (TC = 420 K), and Cr2Te3 (TC = 510 K) monolayers and 2D Cr2O3 monolayer (TC = 332 K) have been reported.40–43
One of the 2D-TMCs, which has unique properties, is the Co2Se3 monolayer. In 2018, Lin et al. successfully synthesized 2D Pd2Se3 by exfoliating bulk PdSe2, and inspired by this structure, Peng et al. showed that the Co2Se3 monolayer exhibits half-metal ferromagnetism with high Curie temperature and superior mechanical flexibility.3,44 This paper investigates the thermoelectric, spin-dependent optical and quantum transport properties of 2D Co2Se3. So, first, the computational methods used to investigate the properties of Co2Se3 monolayer are presented below.
2 Computational details
The electronic properties of the Co2Se3 monolayer were computed by using density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the norm-conserving pseudopotential-based OpenMX 3.9.2 package.45–48 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and GGA+U approach (with U = 3.3 eV) for the 3d orbitals of Co atom were employed to describe the exchange–correlation functional.49,50 Co6.0-s3p2d1 and Se7.0-s3p2d2, which represented pseudo-atomic orbitals (PAOs), were used as basis wave functions to solve Kohn–Sham equations.51 It is important to mention that the numbers in the front of the chemical symbols of cobalt and selenium represent the atomic cut-off radius in Bohr units. The cut-off energy was set to be 550 Ry, and a k-point mesh of 24 × 24 × 1 based on the Monkhorst–Pack scheme was used to sample Brillouin zone integrations.52 Cell vectors and internal atomic coordinates were optimized by using a combination scheme of the rational function method (RF), the direct inversion iterative sub-space (DIIS) method, and the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method using the OpenMX package.53–58 Energy and force convergence were set to 10−7 Hartree and 10−4 Hartree Bohr−1, respectively. To avoid the interaction between neighboring layers, a vacuum of 20 Å was considered in the z direction, and spin-polarized calculations were performed to study the properties of Co2Se3.
The phonon dispersion spectrum with a supercell of 2 × 2 × 1 size was obtained using the finite displacement method as implemented in the combination of OpenMX and ALAMODE codes.59 The thermoelectric properties of monolayer Co2Se3 were calculated within semi-classical Boltzmann theory by considering the relaxation time approximation using the BoltzTraP code and a dense k-point mesh of 48 × 48 × 1 size.60,61 The frequency-dependent complex dielectric function (ε(ω)) was calculated using the Kubo–Greenwood formula to study the linear response of the material to the perturbing electric field. Furthermore, other important optical properties such as absorption and reflectivity can be derived from the dielectric function.62–66 The spin-dependent electron transport properties of the Co2Se3 monolayer, such as current–voltage curves and the transmission spectrum, were computed based on a non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) using the TranMain code in the OpenMX package.67,68
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and stability
As shown in Fig. 1, TMCs with M2X3 stoichiometry, orthorhombic space group (59), and Pmmn symmetry have ten atoms in their cells, in which a layer of transition metal (Co) is placed between two layers of chalcogen (Se), and each Co atom is bonded to four Se atoms. The optimized structural parameters, as well as the magnetic momentum using the Voronoi and Mulliken charge analyses69,70 for each cobalt atom, are given in Table 1, which is in agreement with a previous study.44 The total energies of 2D Co2Se3 in the ferromagnetic (FM), anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) (↑↑↓↓,↑↓↓↑,↑↓↑↓) and non-magnetic (NM) states are equal to −646.122, (−646.1169, −646.1179, −646.1172) and −646.1165 Hartree, respectively, so the ferromagnetic state is the most stable state (↑ and ↓ represent the up and down spins, respectively). The Curie temperature (TC) calculated using mean field theory (MFT)  is ∼800 K, which is in good agreement with the TC ∼ 770 K calculated by the same method in ref. 44. Since the TC calculated by MFT may be overestimated, Peng et al. reported TC ∼ 600 K using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. As a result, according to the TC calculated by both methods (MFT and MC), the Co2Se3 monolayer is an intrinsic ferromagnetic with a high Curie temperature.

The cohesive energy, which indicates the thermodynamic stability and the possibility of synthesizing the structure, is expressed using the following equation: (1)where EC is the cohesive energy per atom in the unit cell, ECo2Se3 is the total energy of 2D Co2Se3, and ECo and ESe represent the total energies of isolated Co and Se atoms. By substituting the values of energy in the equation, the calculated cohesive energy became −3.62 eV per atom, where a negative value indicates the stability of the Co2Se3 monolayer and is in agreement with a previous study (Table 1).
The phonon dispersion curve and phonon density of states (PDOS) of 2D Co2Se3 are shown in Fig. 2; since this structure has ten atoms in its unit cell, the numbers of acoustic and optical branches are equal to 3 and 27, respectively, and the absence of a negative frequency indicates the dynamic stability of the structure. The acoustic branches that play an important role in heat conduction are in the frequency range of 0 to 64.2 cm−1, and the highest phonon frequency is observed at 312 cm−1, and the PDOS is in complete agreement with the phonon dispersion. The vibrational thermodynamic functions, including constant volume heat capacity (CV), vibrational entropy (S), internal energy (U), and Helmholtz free energy (F), are calculated based on phonon calculations in the temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. As shown in Fig. 2(c), with increasing temperature, the Helmholtz free energy decreases from positive to negative values. In contrast, the internal energy shows an upward trend with increasing temperature and, at a temperature of 1000 K, has a value exceeding 251 kJ mol−1. According to Fig. 2(d), the entropy is zero at 0 K, which agrees with the third law of thermodynamics, and the value of S increases with increasing temperature. The CV at zero and low temperatures is in good agreement with the Debye model, and it converges to a constant value at temperatures above 300 K and follows the Dulong–Petit law.71

3.2 Electronic properties
The band structure and density of states (DOS) of the Co2Se3 monolayer in the spin-up and spin-down channels, calculated by PBE–GGA approximation, are shown in Fig. 3. It should be noted that the Fermi energy is considered as the zero point of the energy scale. As can be seen from Fig. 3(a), the band structure of the spin-down channel passes through the Fermi level and creates three Dirac-like cones along high-symmetry paths, which are marked with black circles in Fig. 3. The spin-up channel has an indirect gap around the Fermi level and shows semiconducting properties. Therefore, the Co2Se3 monolayer has a Dirac half-metallic nature. The valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) in the band structure of the spin-up channel are located at the gamma point and the S to Y path, respectively, creating an indirect band gap of 0.7 eV, so 2D Co2Se3 indicates 100% spin polarization around the Fermi level. The study of the contribution of the orbitals of atoms in electronic states shows that the Co-3d states, with the most significant contribution around the Fermi level in the spin-down channel, are the cause of the semi-metallic properties. According to Fig. 3(b), the VBM and CBM of the spin-up channel are formed by Co-3d, Se-4p, and Co-3d, respectively. According to Fig. 3(d), which shows the spin-polarized band structure of the Co2Se3 monolayer using the GGA+U approximation, the spin-down channel has metallic properties with two Dirac-like cones around the Fermi level, and the band gap of the spin-up channel increased to 0.9 eV. Since the GGA+U approximation has a small effect on the electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties of the Co2Se3 monolayer,44 GGA approximation is used to investigate the thermoelectric, optical and transport properties in this study.

3.3 Thermoelectric properties
The performance of thermoelectric materials is expressed in terms of the figure of merit (ZT), which is a dimensionless quantity and is a criterion for comparing the thermoelectric properties of different materials:72 (2)where σ, S, k, and T are the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and temperature, respectively. The applied thermoelectric materials must have high electrical conductivity, high Seebeck coefficient, and low thermal conductivity. In this subsection, we study the thermoelectric properties of the Co2Se3 monolayer at five different temperatures using Boltzmann's transport theory and constant relaxation time approximation. The Seebeck coefficient represents the voltage created by the temperature difference along the thermoelectric material and is calculated from the following equation:60,72 Sij = (σ−1)α,iVα,j(3)Here α, i, and j are the tensor indices and σ and V are the electrical conductivity and group velocity tensors, which are defined as follows: (4) (5)where Ω, μ, e, ε, and fμ are the volume of the unit cell, the chemical potential, the electron charge, the energy band, and the Fermi–Dirac distribution function, respectively.

Fig. 4(a) shows the variation of the Seebeck coefficient with chemical potential in the range of −1.5 to 1.5 eV at five different temperatures (100, 200, 300, 500 and 700 K). The negative and positive μ values indicate p- and n-type doping, respectively, and it should be noted that the Fermi energy is taken as the zero point of chemical potential. According to Fig. 4(a), S has non-zero values in the range of −0.45 to 0.45 eV and tends to zero outside this range. S has a maximum value of 2849.71 μV K−1 at 100 K and a chemical potential of −0.0539 eV. Also, the maximum values of S at 200, 300, 500 and 700 K are −1594.78, −1070.99, −646.330 and −463.354 μV K−1, respectively. The sign of S indicates the type of carriers in the electrical transport, where positive and negative values indicate that the majority of carriers are holes and electrons, respectively. The maximum negative values of S indicate that the electrons move from the hot side to the cold side throughout the Co2Se3 monolayer. The maximum positive values of S are 1519.85 μV K−1 at 200 K, 997.494 μV K−1 at 300 K, 557.221 μV K−1 at 500 K and 385.292 μV K−1 at 700 K, and these values indicate that, with increasing temperature, the value of S decreases. Since a high value of S is one of the most important thermoelectric parameters, the Co2Se3 monolayer exhibits a better thermoelectric performance at 100 K.

Fig. 4(b) displays the electrical conductivity (σ) of 2D Co2Se3 as a function of chemical potential. The electrical conductivity behaves similarly at five different temperatures and shows an increasing trend with chemical potential. Also, the electrical conductivity in the range of −0.17 to 0.16 eV has the lowest value. In comparison, its maximum value is 6.74 × 1020 Ω−1 m−1 s−1 at a chemical potential of 1.23 eV and the maximum values of electrical conductivity are observed at positive chemical potentials, which indicates that n-type carriers have higher electrical conductivity.
The electronic thermal conductivity is expressed by the following equation:60 (6)According to Fig. 4(c), the electronic thermal conductivity increases with increasing temperature and chemical potential, and the maximum values of kelec are observed at the positive chemical potential. The maximum and minimum values of kelec are 9.25 × 1015 W m−1 K−1 s−1 at 700 K and ∼ 108 W m−1 K−1 s−1 at 100 K, respectively. Since the electronic thermal conductivity is inversely correlated to ZT, 2D Co2Se3 exhibits a better thermoelectric performance at low and near room temperature.
The S2σ expression in the equation of ZT depends only on the electronic properties. It is called the power factor (PF), which is a criterion for comparing the electronic properties of a thermoelectric material. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the PF has higher values at higher temperatures, and the maximum values of PF for 2D Co2Se3 at 100, 200, 300, 500 and 700 K are 5.35 × 1011, 11.90 × 1011, 16.441 × 1011, 23.524 × 1011 and 29.362 × 1011 W m−1 s−1 K−2, respectively.

Fig. 4(e) displays the variation of the electronic figure of merit (ZT) with chemical potential at different temperatures. According to Fig. 4(e), ZT at negative chemical potentials shows values close to one, and as can be seen from Table 2, the maximum value of the electronic figure of merit at −0.074 eV and 100 K is 0.992. Although ZT decreases with increasing temperature and has very close values at all temperatures, the Co2Se3 monolayer has high thermoelectric efficiency not only at low temperature but also at other temperatures.

3.4 Optical properties
To investigate the optical properties of the Co2Se3 monolayer and study the interaction between the incident photon and the Co2Se3 structure, we use the Kubo–Greenwood formula to calculate the dielectric function ε(ω), which is defined as follows:62–66 εαβ(ω) = εReαβ(ω) + εImαβ(ω)(7)where εReαβ(ω) and εImαβ(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. Other optical properties, including the absorption coefficient α(ω) and reflectivity R(ω), are calculated using the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function: (8) (9)
Since the Co2Se3 monolayer has an orthorhombic symmetry, optical properties have been studied in the two directions of x and y. On the other hand, due to the half-metal properties of the Co2Se3 structure and the metal behavior of the spin-down channel, the interband and intraband contributions should be considered in the optical calculations of this spin channel. In Fig. 5, the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of the spin-down channel in the two directions of x and y are shown by taking into account the interband, intraband, and inter- plus intraband contributions. Both parts of the dielectric function in the energy range of 0 to 1 eV (infrared range) are significantly affected by Intraband transitions. According to Fig. 5, the large negative values in the real part indicate the metallic behavior of the spin-down channel, which is in agreement with the band structure of the Co2Se3 monolayer (Fig. 3). In Fig. 5, one of the reasons for the zero value of the real part of the dielectric function at energies of 2.67, 3.20, 4.29, 4.74, 5.54 and 5.64 eV (4.5, 3.92, 3.66, and 3.71 eV) in the x(y) direction is plasmonic oscillations. The static value of εRe(ω) in the spin-down channel for the interband and intraband contributions in the x direction is 34.74 and −1345.92 and for the y direction it is 46.25 and −1884.73, respectively. Although the εRe(ω) value in both directions turns to zero after 10 eV, in the infrared and visible ranges, the value of the real part in the y direction is more than that in the x direction.
 Fig. 5  The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of the Co2Se3 monolayer along the x and y directions for the spin-down channel. 
The imaginary part of the dielectric function εIm(ω) which is shown in Fig. 5 represents the optical transitions from filled states to empty states in the spin-down channel of the Co2Se3 monolayer. Most of these transitions occur in the infrared and visible ranges. According to Fig. 5, although εIm(ω) in both directions displays the same behavior and decreases with increasing energy of the indicated light, its value in static points and peaks in the y direction is higher than that in the x direction.
The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of the spin-up channel in the x and y directions are shown in Fig. 6(a). The static values of εRe(ω) for the spin-up channel in the x and y directions are 3.6 and 4.37, respectively, where a larger static value in the y direction indicates that the reaction of the dielectric function to the static electric field in the y direction is more than that in the x direction. In Fig. 6(a), for the indicated light with energy greater than 2.85 eV in the x direction and 3.56 eV in the y direction, the real part of the dielectric function has negative values indicating no light transmission. According to Fig. 6(b), which represents the imaginary part of the dielectric function εIm(ω) for the spin-up channel, the most remarkable transition from the occupied to unoccupied state occurs in the visible range, and the threshold value of εIm(ω) is in agreement with the band gap of the Co2Se3 monolayer in the spin-up channel.
 Fig. 6  The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of the Co2Se3 monolayer along the x and y directions for the spin-up channel. 

Fig. 7 shows the total reflectivity (R(ω)) and absorption coefficient (α(ω)) of the Co2Se3 monolayer for interband and total transitions (inter- plus intraband transitions in the x and y directions). The static values of R(ω) for the Co2Se3 structure by considering the total and interband transitions in the x direction are 92% and 50%, while in the y direction they are 94% and 55%, respectively. It should be noted that the maximum reflectivity of 2D Co2Se3 is located in the infrared range in both directions. In Fig. 7(b), the maximum value of α(ω) in both directions is in the ultraviolet range, and α(ω) peaks with and without Intraband transitions in the x(y) direction are 0.754 × 10−6 and 0.805 × 10−6 cm−1 (0.67 × 10−6 and 0.709 × 10−6 cm−1), respectively. Interband transitions have the highest contribution to the α(ω) diagrams, and although adsorption can be ignored in the infrared region (∼0.1 × 10−6 cm−1), it has significant values (∼0.5 × 10−6 cm−1) in the visible region.

3.5 Spin-dependent quantum transport properties
The non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method within DFT has been used to study the effect of spin on the transport properties of the 2D Co2Se3 monolayer. As shown in Fig. 8, the system contains a central scattering region attached to the infinite left and right leads. It should be noted that, according to the anisotropy of the structure, spin-dependent transport properties have been investigated in the x and y directions.
 Fig. 8  Configuration of a 2D transport model for the Co2Se3 monolayer, studied by the NEGF method, with infinite leads. 
The transmission spectrum of the spin-down and up channels of 2D Co2Se3 for transport in the x direction under zero-bias voltage is displayed in Fig. 9(a) and (b), respectively. The transmission gap of spin-down and spin-up channels in the x-direction is 0 and 0.78 eV, respectively, which is in agreement with the band structure gaps, and the transmission spectrum is well matched with the DOS of spin channels. Fig. 9(c) shows the current (I) as a function of bias voltage (V) for spin channels in the x direction. Due to the lack of gap in the band structure of the spin-down channel and its metallic nature, the current passing through the structure in this channel increases with increasing applied voltage so that a significant current as large as 40 μA can be seen under a bias voltage of 1.8 V. In the spin-up channel, currents are almost zero and off for voltages below 0.8 V, and when the maximum of the valence band of the left lead is placed on the same level with the minimum of the conduction band of the right lead, a scanty current (about 0.9 μA) passes through the scattering region for voltages from 0.8 to 1.2 V. Then, the current passing through the structure shows an increasing trend by increasing the applied voltage, so a considerable spin-up current of 6.67 μA is observed at a bias voltage of 1.8 V. According to Fig. 9(d), which represents the spin filter polarization parameter (SFP = (I↓ − I↑)/(I↓ + I↑)) as a function of bias voltage, the 2D half-metal Co2Se3 has a 100% spin filtration property up to an applied bias voltage of 1.2 V and the spin-up channel is off. The percentage of this filtration for transport in the x direction is reduced to 72% with increasing applied voltage.

The zero-bias transmission spectra in terms of energy, current and the spin filter polarization (SFP) parameter as a function of applied bias voltage for the spin-down and spin-up channels of the Co2Se3 monolayer in the y direction are shown in Fig. 10. As shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b), the zero-bias transmission gap in the direction of y for spin-down and spin-up channels is 0 and 0.72 eV, respectively, which indicates that the gap in this direction is similar to that in the direction of x in accordance with the gap of the band structure in Fig. 3. According to Fig. 10(c), which shows spin-down and spin-up currents under different bias voltages, the current increases with increasing voltage for the spin-down channel, so that a considerable current as large as 50 μA passes through the central area for a voltage of 1.8 V. Although the spin-up current that passes through the structure in the y direction up to a voltage of 0.8 V is close to zero and has a small value for voltages of 0.8 and 1 V, it has an upward trend for bias voltages greater than 1 V, and at voltages of 1.8 V the amount of spin-up current passing through the Co2Se3 structure reaches a considerable value of 15 μA. The SFP parameter up to a voltage of 1 V is equal to 100% for transport in the direction of y, which indicates perfect spin filtration properties and dominance of down-spin current in the transport. With increasing bias voltage and adding up-spin current, the SFP decreases to 53%. According to Fig. 9 and 10, although the down- and up-spin current in the y direction are higher than those in the x direction, the main reason is that when the transmission gap is smaller, the transport in the x direction of the 2D Co2Se3 monolayer has better spin filtration properties. According to the results of spin-transport calculations, the Co2Se3 monolayer can be introduced as an appropriate structure for spintronic applications.

4 Conclusion
In conclusion, the electronic, thermoelectric, spin-dependent optical and transport properties of the Co2Se3 monolayer were investigated using density functional theory. The negative value of cohesive energy and the absence of negative frequencies in the phonon dispersion indicate the thermodynamic and dynamic stability of the optimized 2D Co2Se3, respectively. The ferromagnetic state with the lowest total energy was identified as the most stable state with high Curie temperature. The band structure calculations using GGA-PBE showed that the spin-down and spin-up channels have 0 and 0.7 eV gaps, respectively, and the spin-down channel has Dirac cones around the Fermi level, so Co2Se3 has Dirac half-metal properties. Investigation of thermoelectric properties as a function of chemical potential and at different temperatures using Boltzmann's semi-classical theory with constant relaxation time approximation showed that, with increasing chemical potential, electrical conductivity shows an increasing trend. The higher σ values at positive chemical potentials indicate that n-type carriers have a more significant contribution to electrical conductivity. On the other hand, the Co2Se3 monolayer with ZT ∼ 1 can be introduced as a thermoelectric material with considerable performance in the temperature range of 100 to 700 K. Since the spin-down channel is metallic, the contribution of intra- and interband transitions was considered to study the optical properties of this channel. The results indicated that the most impact of intra-band transitions in the dielectric function diagram is in the range of 0 to 1 eV. Also, due to the maximum values of the absorption coefficient and reflectivity, this structure can be used in optical devices as wave reflectors in the IR range or light absorbents in the FUV range. Spin-dependent transport properties were studied using a combination of DFT and NEGF methods. According to the current–voltage curve, the spin-down current increases by increasing the applied bias voltage, while the spin-up current to a specific voltage is approximately zero, so the Co2Se3 monolayer has spin filtering properties and, due to the magnitude of the total current, can be used in spintronic nano-devices.
