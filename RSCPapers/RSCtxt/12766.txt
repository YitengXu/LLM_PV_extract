    , Accepted 25th August 2015First published on 27th August 2015AbstractWe present a facile mechanochemical route for the preparation of hybrid CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite particles with the size of several hundred nanometers for high-efficiency thin-film photovoltaic devices. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate that mechanosynthesis is a suitable strategy to produce a highly crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 material showing no detectable amounts of the starting CH3NH3I and PbI2 reagents. Thermal stability measurements based on the thermogravimetric analysis data of mechanosynthesized perovskite particles indicated that the as-ground MAPbI3 is stable up to 300 °C with no detectable material loss at lower temperatures. The optical properties of newly synthesized perovskite particles were characterized by applying steady state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, which confirmed a direct band-gap of 1.48 eV. Time resolved single photon counting measurements revealed that 70% of charges undergo recombination with a 61 ns lifetime. The solar cell devices made from mechanosynthesized perovskite particles achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.1% when applying a one step deposition method.
Introduction
Due to their rapid progress in power conversion efficiency recently topping at 20.1%,1 perovskite photovoltaic devices have become promising alternative candidates for future power generation from sunlight. The main factors determining the high efficiency of perovskite solar cells are related to their favorable physical properties such as a low band gap and a high extinction coefficient across the entire visible to near infrared region.2 For efficient charge collection, long charge carrier diffusion lengths3,4 reaching the micrometer regime and also high mobilities exceeding tens of square centimetres per voltsecond5 are very important. However, the presence of defects in perovskite materials can modify the transport and enhance the radiationless decay of mobile charge carriers. Therefore ensuring a low concentration of defects is essential for efficient device operation.6
In general, preparation methods of perovskite materials play a relevant role in their physical and chemical properties. Their composition, homogeneity, crystallinity, phase purity, morphology, grain size-dispersion, surface area, and many other parameters can be easily altered by simply changing the material synthesis route.7–9 Therefore sustained efforts have been made for the development of efficient methods for perovskite preparation. The synthesis of MAPbI3 perovskites, where MA stands for the methyl-ammonium cation can be accomplished through a variety of approaches including solvothermal processes and high-temperature solid-state reactions. Some methods have employed grinding a mixture of appropriate precursors for metal halide perovskites to achieve more efficient homogenization in the starting mixture.10,11 It was found that simple grinding of precursors in a mortar with a pestle forms a mixture of products including MAPbI3 with significant amounts of unreacted precursors.11 In such a case, the perovskite purity was increased by further annealing such “crude” products.
Following our recent reports on a mechano-synthesis as a powerful method for environmentally friendly, clean and energy-efficient synthesis,12–15 we report herein an efficient room-temperature mechano-synthesis of the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite MAPbI3 with a well-defined structure and composition. We also demonstrate that such an approach applied for the preparation of MAPbI3 perovskite material has an advantage over solution based synthetic routes in terms of device performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficient mechano-chemical synthesis of stoichiometric methylammonium lead iodide perovskite powders with its application in photovoltaic devices.
Results and discussion
Materials and device preparation
As it was reported by Kanatzidis and co-workers,11 simple grinding of MAI and PbI2 in a mortar with a pestle forms a mixture of products with significant amounts of unreacted precursors. We wondered if a more efficient grinding procedure could provide the desired perovskite in high yield and homogeneous form. Indeed, neat grinding of MAI and PbI2 (stoichiometric ratio 1:1) in an electric ball mill for 30 min resulted in the formation of polycrystalline methylammonium lead iodide perovskite particles (for experimental details see ESI†). The resulting perovskite has been fully characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), steady state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM image of a one-step perovskite film deposited on a mesoporous TiO2 film is reported earlier16,17 and we expect no difference in the film prepared by the mechanosynthesis method. In the next step, the solar cell device was fabricated by applying a one-step deposition method using the mechanochemically synthesized perovskite, and its power conversion efficiency was determined.
PXRD data analysis
The powder X-ray diffraction studies illustrating the formation mechanism of the newly synthesized perovskite particles are presented in Fig. 1. The PXRD diagrams of simulated and ground MAPbI3 perovskite particles are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. The characteristic PXRD spectra of starting precursors, lead iodide and methylammonium iodide, are also presented for comparison in Fig. 1(c) and (d), respectively. The PXRD analysis of the as-prepared perovskite particles reveals well defined patterns which can be attributed to the tetragonal perovskite structure. For comparison, PXRD peak positions of the perovskite particles prepared by mechanosynthesis are also in close agreement with MAPbI3 perovskite materials formed using different fabrication approaches: low temperature vapor-assisted solution process,18 vacuum deposition19,20 or solution processing.21 Only the relative intensities of the PXRD peaks of perovskite materials synthesized by different procedures are slightly different because of the changes in their crystal orientation. Here, one can also observe that the PXRD peaks of mechanosynthesized perovskite crystals are split into two components. This minor displacement in the peak position can be attributed to the formation of an additional crystal structure, comprising two lattice planes co-existing at a close distance, rather than to the formation of additional phases. Moreover, the measured PXRD diagram for mechanosynthesized perovskite (Fig. 1(b)) ideally matches with the simulated PXRD pattern (Fig. 1(a)), which was generated based on the lattice parameters with a space group of I4/mcm22 for the tetragonal structure. According to these PXRD measurements, mechanosynthesis allows us to produce a highly crystalline MAPbI3 material showing no detectable amounts of the starting MAI and PbI2 materials.

Thermal properties
The weight loss as a function of temperature together with its corresponding first derivative of the mechanochemically synthesized MAPbI3 particles measured by thermogravimetric analysis is presented in Fig. 2. As is seen, four derivative peaks of different intensities, corresponding to the four mass losses are obtained in the temperature range from 25 to 600 °C. The negligibly small loss of a material at 180 °C, corresponding to a few percent drop in the TGA curve, could be assigned to the loss of water. However it is slightly surprising that mechanosynthesized perovskite particles did not show any mass loss below 180 degrees, which was not the case for the solution processed perovskite films, where the first weight loss was obtained in the range between 80 and 130 °C, attributed to the dehydration of perovskite.23 Probably mechanosynthesized particles contain a small fraction of more strongly bonded water,24 which can be released at slightly higher temperatures compared to the water which is just adsorbed on the surface. Similar temperature values for the release of strongly bonded water molecules were previously reported for various compounds.25,26 Whereas, a first significant mass loss appears at around 250 °C and reaches the maximum rate at 350 °C. According to the previous data,23 the mass loss in this temperature interval can be attributed to the loss of HI, while the loss appearing from 350 to 400 degrees may be attributed to the sublimation of the amine constituent. Thus the decrease in weight, occurring in two steps in the range from 250 to 400 degrees, consists only of the loss of methylammonium iodide. In agreement with the experimentally obtained data it constitutes about 25% of the total weight of MAPbI3. Finally, the last step which starts at around 450 °C in the TGA curve is due to thermal decomposition of the lead iodide which is completed at 600 °C.

Optical properties

Fig. 3 presents the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of methylammonium lead iodide perovskite particles. The measured samples reveal an intense light absorption over the entire UV-visible spectrum (shown in green) with the extrapolated absorption edge corresponding to the 1.48 eV band-gap value assuming a direct transition between the edges of valence and conduction bands. The shape of the obtained spectrum is typical of methylammonium lead iodide perovskites, however the somewhat lower band gap, i.e. 1.48 vs. the commonly reported 1.55 eV (ref. 10 and 17), may be attributed to the presence of defects produced during the milling process. Probably the small changes in perovskite crystallinity, which were also observed as a split in PXRD spectra, could be the main parameter that contributes to the slightly lowered band gap position of the mechanosynthesized perovskite particles. The photoluminescence spectra of the as-ground MAPbI3 show a strong exciton emission at 1.57 eV (Fig. 3). To gain a better understanding of the charge recombination mechanism in newly synthesized perovskite particles we have performed excited-state photoluminescence lifetime measurements using time correlated single photon counting spectroscopy. The insert in Fig. 3 shows the photoluminescence decay of mechanosynthesized perovskite particles, measured in air at 1.57 eV upon sample excitation at 3.05 eV. The fluorescence decay kinetics were fit by the sum of two exponential width lifetimes of 4.5 ns and 61 ns. The fast decay fraction is 30% and the slower decay accounts for the remaining 70%.

SEM analysis
The low-magnification SEM images of the as-ground MAPbI3 particles show that the particles exhibit average diameters of about 250–450 nm (Fig. SI1(a) and (b)†). As shown in Fig. SI1(b),† the presence of individual particles is not dominant and the formation of larger aggregated clusters is also probable when applying this synthesis method. The shape of formed perovskite particles is rarely hexagonal but mainly irregular and also independent of their size. Probably the geometrical parameters mainly depend on grinding conditions rather than on self-assembly of perovskite crystals.
Photovoltaic performance
Having the newly synthesized perovskite in hand, designated further as MAPbI3[m], we attempted to investigate its behavior as the light-absorbing material to fabricate solution-processed solid-state photovoltaic devices. For comparison of photovoltaic performance, the reference material MAPbI3 (designated as MAPbI3[s]) was synthesized from the direct solvothermal reaction between PbI2 and MAI (for more details see the Experimental section). Current voltage characteristics of MAPbI3[s] or MAPbI3[m] based devices are shown in Fig. 4(a). The photovoltaic parameters of the best performing devices are summarized in Table 1. Photovoltaic parameter data of several identical devices are listed in Table SI2.† The short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of the best device fabricated with MAPbI3[m] particles is 1 mA cm−2 lower than that of the reference device. However, this is overcompensated by a 100 mV higher open circuit voltage (Voc) and 4% higher fill factor, resulting in a higher device performance with MAPbI3[m] perovskite particles. The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the perovskite devices is illustrated in Fig. 4(b). The IPCE of the reference device is slightly higher compared to that of the device prepared with the MAPbI3[m] sample in line with the observed 1 mA cm−2 higher current density. The onsets of IPCE spectra of both the devices are very similar.

We also measured the hysteresis of both the devices by recording current–voltage characteristics at 100 mV s−1 sweep rate, starting with a backward scan and directly continuing with a forward scan as shown in Fig. 5. It is interesting to observe that devices made from MAPbI3[m] perovskite particles show almost no hysteresis, while for the MAPbI3[s] cell it produces a 1.5% lower efficiency. Recently the origin of hysteresis in perovskite solar cells has been widely discussed and suggested that this phenomenon is due to ferroelectric, polarization or trap state filling effects.6,27,28 It is also suggested that the presence of defect states is a crucial factor in determining anomalous hysteresis in perovskite solar cells. Therefore significant improvements of crystal quality allowing for hysteresis-free perovskite solar cells have been achieved after introducing several new crystal growth methods.28,29 The favourable outcome of the mechanosynthesis undoubtedly highlights its exceptional quality in obtaining perovskite with low defect levels.
 Fig. 5  Current–voltage curves of devices prepared with standard MAPbI3[s] perovskite and MAPbI3[m] perovskite to study the hysteresis effect. Scan rate = 100 mV s−1. 
Based on this we believe that hysteresis in perovskite solar cells fabricated with mechanosynthetically prepared perovskite particles is also reduced due to the presence of the lower amount of defects in particular electron or hole traps. Moreover, mechanochemistry provides MAPbI3 perovskite particles showing an exact stoichiometric composition what can additionally result in both lower hysteresis and better PCE in comparison to that synthesized by using the one-step process. The higher purity of the material could contribute to better power conversion efficiencies for devices obtained using this new synthesis method.
It remains to be explained why the mechano-synthesized perovskite performs better than the one prepared using the one-step solution process. We note that there is an important difference between the perovskite film prepared via the mechano-chemical synthesis route and films made by the one step solution process. The mechano-chemical route produces the MAPbI3 perovskite material first in a pure crystalline form as shown by the full characterization of the material described above. The subsequent deposition of the thin film perovskite on the mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold to fabricate the photovoltaic device amounts to recrystallization of the powder from DMF as a solvent, which likely will result in further purification. In contrast to the mechano-chemically synthesized MAPbI3 perovskite it is difficult to prepare films of exact stoichiometric composition by the one step solution method. While one aims for making a starting solution containing PbI2 and CH3NH3I in 1:1 molar ratio the weighing of the precursors is not precise enough to avoid slight deviations from the desired stoichiometry. Thus in the present case a 5% molar excess of CH3NH3I was applied in order to ascertain the complete conversion of PbI2 to the perovskite. This may result in the formation of lattice defects, which often affect adversely the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite. Thus, an excess of methyl-ammonium iodide will create lead ion vacancies that can act as electron traps and accelerate the radiation-less recombination of charge carriers lowering the open circuit voltage of the device and hence its power conversion efficiency. This rationale is supported by previous investigations showing that excess halides in the perovskite induce defects.30,31
Conclusions
In conclusion, we presented mechanosynthesis as a new alternative chemical approach that allows us to obtain MAPbI3 perovskite particles showing an exact stoichiometric composition and high thermal stability. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed no detectable amounts of starting materials. In addition, the newly synthesized perovskite material gave superior device performance compared to standard solution processed synthesis which opens up a new avenue for making cheap and highly performing perovskite materials for solar cell applications without hysteresis.
Experimental
Materials synthesis
Polycrystalline methylammonium iodide perovskite particles were obtained by applying a mechanochemical processing technique. To this end, lead iodide (PbI2) (99.999% Pb) ABCR (461 mg; 1 mmol) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) (DYESOL) (159 mg; 1 mmol) were mixed together in a 10 mL agate jar with one 10 mm diameter agate ball. The mixture was ground for 30 min in a Retsch MM200 mill at 30 Hz yielding a black polycrystalline material. The synthesis was conducted in a glove box under an argon atmosphere.
Solar cell device fabrication
Devices were prepared on plasma-cleaned conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. A compact 50 nm thick titanium dioxide layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis of 9 mL ethanol solution containing 0.6 mL titanium diiso-propoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.4 mL acetylacetone at 450 °C in air. On top of this compact layer, a 300 nm-thick mesoporous titanium dioxide layer was prepared by spin-coating 30 nm sized nanoparticles (Dyesol 30NRD, Dyesol) diluted in ethanol (1:3.5 w/w) at 4800 rpm for 30 s. The films were then gradually heated to 500 °C and sintered at that temperature for 1.5 h under an oxygen atmosphere. Perovskite stock solution in N,N-dimethylformamide was prepared from lead iodide (PbI2) of 1.2 M concentration by mixing it with methylammonium iodide in a molar ratio of 1:1.05 by vigorous stirring at 130 °C. The stock solution of mechanosynthesized lead iodide perovskite particles was prepared by dissolving them in N,N-dimethylformamide (2:5 w/w) by vigorous stirring at 130 °C. The prepared stock solutions were spin coated on top of the mesoporous TiO2 layer at 6500 rpm for 20 s and dried at 70 °C for 15 min to form perovskite films. Hole transporting material (HTM) solution was prepared by dissolving 74 mg spiro-MeOTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene and additionally mixing it with 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (stock solution Li-TFSI 520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), 28.8 μL tert-butylpyridine and 29 μL of tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (stock solution FK 209, 300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile). Subsequently, the HTM was deposited on top of the perovskite layer by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 20 s. Device fabrication was completed by thermal evaporation of a 60 nm thick gold layer on top of the pure perovskite and perovskite with the HTM. The active area of the devices is approximately 0.56 cm2.
Device characterization

Current voltage characterization. 
The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured under 100 mW cm−2 conditions using a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel), as the light source, equipped with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas & Optik GmbH) to match the emission spectra to the AM1.5G standard in the region of 350–750 nm. The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the cell while recording the generated photocurrent using a Keithley (Model 2400) digital source meter. The J–V curves of all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask of area 0.16 cm2.


Internal photon to current conversion efficiency. 
The internal photon to current conversion efficiency of the devices was measured by focusing light from the 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA) through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd, UK) while chopping at 3 Hz before illuminating onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE dependence on wavelength.

Techniques

Powder X-ray diffraction. 
Powder XRD data were collected on an Empyrean diffractometer (PANalytical). Measurements employed Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation of a copper sealed tube charged with 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current and Bragg–Brentano geometry with a beam divergence of 1 degree in the scattering plane. Diffraction patterns were measured in the range of 4–50 degrees of the scattering angle by step scanning with a step of 0.02 degree.


Thermogravimetric analysis. 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA Instruments Q600 system at a heating rate of 50 °C min−1 from 25 to 600 °C under an argon atmosphere. Such a slow heating rate was used in order to accurately determine full sample decomposition at the corresponding temperature.


Structure characterization. 
The surface morphology of the perovskite was explored by using a Nova 450 NonoSEM scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy resolution of 130 eV.
Energy dispersive X-ray analysis. 
The elemental compositions of the samples were determined using an energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometer (MiniPal 4, PANalytical&Co) with a Rh tube and a silicon drift detector. The spectra were collected in air atmosphere, without using a filter, at a tube voltage of 20 kV. The time of acquisition was set to 50 s and the tube current up to 50 μA.
Optical measurements. 
Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was performed using a UV-2501PC Shimadzu spectrophotometer in the 250–900 nm spectral range. Fluorescence decay kinetics were recorded with a spectrofluorometer Fluorolog 322 working in single-photon counting mode. Picosecond pulsed diode laser head NanoLED-405LH (Horiba) emitting <200 ps duration pulses at 406 nm with a repetition rate of 1 MHz was used for sample excitation. The excitation energy was about 11 pJ per pulse. The fluorescence spectrum was corrected for the instrument response function. The maximum time resolution of about several hundred picoseconds was reached for the setup by applying apparatus function deconvolution.
