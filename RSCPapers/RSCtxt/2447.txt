    , Accepted 27th October 2012First published on 30th October 2012AbstractAn alternating donor–acceptor copolymer using dithienothiophene as the donor unit and diketopyrrolopyrrole as the acceptor unit has been synthesized and characterized. Preliminary studies of OTFT devices based on this copolymer showed a high annealing-free saturation hole mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1. Initial bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the blends of the copolymer with PC71BM had a power conversion efficiency of 3.4% under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 solar illumination.
A wide variety of organic semiconducting polymers have been synthesized over the past few years for electronic applications like organic photovoltaics (OPV) and organic thin-film transistors (OTFT).1 This growing interest in organic semiconductors is the result of a number of advantages these have over their conventional inorganic counterparts. The solution processability of organic polymers allows for large area printing which greatly lowers the cost of production. In addition, molecular engineering of the organic polymers allows for modifications to be made to the structure of the polymer such that the solubility, packing, morphology and photophysical properties of the polymers could be optimized. The properties of organic polymers also enable lightweight, flexible electronic devices to be fabricated.2
The dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (DTT) structure has been employed in numerous semiconducting small molecules for electronic applications.3 However, the poor solubility of DTT-based polymers made them less favourable to be used for these applications.4 A DTT-based copolymer, poly(2,6-bis(thiophene-2-yl)-3,5-dipentadecyl-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene) (PBTDTT-15) was earlier reported to show a good annealing-free field-effect transistor (FET) mobility of 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.2%.5 The presence of long alkyl side chains at the β-position of the DTT unit improved the solubility of the polymer. The relatively low PCE of PBTDTT-15 is possibly due to the large band-gap (1.93 eV) and insufficient light absorption in the solar spectrum. Acceptor units like 2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) and 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) have been extensively employed to reduce the band-gap of the polymers so as to improve the PCE of the OPV devices.6 These acceptor units have a highly conjugated structure that enables strong π–π interactions and possess strong electron-withdrawing functional groups which make them good acceptor units in semiconducting polymers. It was recently reported that the introduction of the DPP acceptor unit into the polymer to form a donor–acceptor type copolymer resulted in a lower band-gap, which significantly improved the PCE of the OPV device fabricated. A three component incorporated copolymer, PDPP-T-DTT which contained DTT and DPP units in random positions was shown to give a high PCE of 5.02% but a relatively low saturation hole mobility of 8.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.7 The low mobility was attributed to the random positions of DTT and DPP units along the polymer chain, thereby reducing the molecular ordering of the polymer. This implies that an alternating copolymer of PDPP-T-DTT possesses the potential to improve the molecular ordering and packing of the polymer chains, thereby increasing the saturation hole mobility.
In this Communication, an alternating copolymer based on DTT and DPP units is synthesized and characterized as a polymer semiconductor in OPV and OTFT devices. By combining the DTT donor units and DPP acceptor units in an alternating fashion, we expect to improve the charge transport ability of the polymer and make it a good OTFT material. Evaluation of the OTFT performance of the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer reveals a high saturation hole mobility of 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a current on/off ratio of 106, much higher than that of the random PDPP-T-DTT polymer.
The polymer synthesis involves a Stille coupling reaction between two monomers, 2,6-bis(5-stannylthien-2-yl)-3,5-dipentadecyldithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene and 3,6-bis(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-di-N-(2-butyloctyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (Scheme 1). The polymerisation reaction was carried out in chlorobenzene at 120 °C using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) as the catalyst. The polymer was purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction with methanol and hexane to remove small molecules and oligomers. The polymer was then washed down by Soxhlet extraction with chloroform. PDPP-T-DTT was obtained in 93% yield by concentrating and precipitating the chloroform fraction into methanol. The structure and composition of the polymer was verified by NMR and elemental analysis (see ESI†). A number-averaged molecular weight of 2.9 × 104 g mol−1 and a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of 2.6 were obtained from gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis using trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 160 °C and polystyrene as the standard.

The thermal properties of the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer were evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A high decomposition temperature of 400 °C at 5% weight loss in the TGA profile (Fig. S2 in ESI†) demonstrated the excellent thermal stability of the polymer. The DSC of PDPP-T-DTT exhibited an endothermic peak at 293 °C during heating and a corresponding exothermic peak at 256 °C when cooled (Fig. S3 in ESI†). The peaks were respectively attributed to the melting and crystallization of the polymer backbone.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer in solution and as a thin film are shown in Fig. 1. There is no difference in the absorption spectra of the annealed thin film and the non-annealed thin film, indicating that annealing does not alter the aggregation state of the polymer in the film. The shape of the absorption spectra for the polymer in solution is similar to that for the polymer in thin film, with a weak absorption peak at around 460 nm and a strong absorption peak at around 760 nm. However, there is an additional weak absorption shoulder at around 850 nm for the polymer in thin film, indicating that a slightly better packing or aggregation state is present for the polymer in the thin film. In addition, heating up the polymer solution does not affect the absorption spectra much, indicating that the polymer chains remain aggregated even at high temperatures. The comparison of the absorption spectra of the alternating polymer with the absorption spectra of PBTDTT-15 and random PDPP-T-DTT in solution is shown in Fig. 2.5,7 Compared with that of random PDPP-T-DTT, two distinct absorption bands are similarly observed, which are attributed to the π–π* transition of the DTT segments (short wavelength region of 400–600 nm) and DPP segments (long wavelength region of 600–900 nm).7 However, the absorption band at the short wavelength region for the alternating polymer is much weaker than that for the random polymer. This could be due to the presence of more DTT units in the random PDPP-T-DTT polymer, as the ratio of the monomers could be varied for the random polymer, but is fixed for the regio-regular alternating polymer.8 Besides, there is a slight spectral red shift of about 32 nm in the absorption peak of the alternating polymer relative to that of the random polymer in the long wavelength region. This red shift in the absorption peak for the alternating polymer could be due to greater molecular ordering within the regio-regular polymer chain, which improves the extent of π-conjugation among the DTT and DPP units along the polymer backbone. The optical band-gap of the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer is estimated to be 1.34 eV, based on the onset point of the absorption band in the near infra-red region of around 930 nm. As compared to the optical band-gap of the random polymer (1.37 eV), the slightly smaller optical band-gap of the alternating polymer is also due to the greater extent of π-conjugation among the ordered donor and acceptor units along the polymer chains.7,8

The FET properties of a solution-processed alternating PDPP-T-DTT semiconductor thin film were evaluated using a bottom-gate, top-contact TFT configuration built on an n-doped silicon wafer with evaporated gold source/drain electrodes and an octyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified 200 nm SiO2 gate dielectric on a silicon wafer surface. Fig. 3 shows the typical output curve and transfer characteristics of a representative as-prepared TFT device (W/L = 4000/75) without postdeposition thermal annealing. When measured under ambient conditions, the device showed a saturation hole mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 106. The saturation hole mobility of the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer is 2 times larger than that of PBTDTT-15 (0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1) which is also an alternating polymer.5 However, the hole mobility of the random PDPP-T-DTT polymer (0.0087 cm2 V−1 s−1) is about an order of magnitude lower than that of the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer.7 This is due to the random positions of the DTT donor and DPP acceptor units along the polymer chain, leading to lower molecular ordering in the random polymer as compared to the regio-regular, alternating polymer. The alternating donor and acceptor units within the polymer chain allow charges to be more efficiently transported along the polymer backbone. In addition, the alternating arrangement of the donor and acceptor units facilitates strong intermolecular interactions between the donor and acceptor units of adjacent polymer chains, leading to the spontaneous self-assembly of polymer chains in close proximity through π–π stacking, which favours intermolecular charge hopping.8 This highly ordered molecular organisation present for the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer facilitates charge carrier hopping through the π–π stacks in the OTFT device, resulting in a high saturation hole mobility. The effect of thermal annealing of the OTFT devices at 200 °C is shown in Table 1. The saturation hole mobilities in the OTFT devices without thermal annealing are quite similar to those after thermal annealing at 200 °C. Therefore, it is evident that there is no significant change in the saturation hole mobility after thermal annealing of the OTFT devices, indicating that the devices exhibit annealing-free properties. These annealing-free characteristics could be due to the high molecular organisation present between the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer chains, even before thermal annealing, as a result of strong intermolecular interactions and π–π stacking. The high FET mobility and annealing-free properties of the OTFT devices reduce the need for the time-consuming, energy-intensive postdeposition thermal annealing process, rendering the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer as an ideal semiconductor for fabricating OTFT arrays and circuits for a variety of large-area electronic applications.1

Apart from the OTFT performance of the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer, the OPV performance of the polymer as a hole transport semiconductor is comparable to that of PBTDTT-15.5 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells were fabricated using a blend of PDPP-T-DTT as an electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor. The OPV devices had a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDPP-T-DTT:PC71BM/Ca/Ag and were subjected to illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves of the devices, and Table 2 lists the corresponding Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of the devices fabricated using different PDPP-T-DTT:PC71BM ratios. The device with a 1:2 ratio by weight of PDPP-T-DTT:PC71BM gave the highest PCE. The device exhibited a Voc of 0.53 V, a Jsc of 9.91 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.65% with a PCE of 3.44%. The PCE obtained for the alternating PDPP-T-DTT polymer is lower than that of the random PDPP-T-DTT polymer (5.02%) and this might be due to the lower absorbance of the alternating polymer in the short wavelength region of 400–600 nm as compared to the random polymer. The lower Jsc of around 9.91 mA cm−2 measured for the OPV device of the alternating polymer as compared to that of the random polymer (12.8 mA cm−2) indicates that there is a greater mismatch between the absorption spectrum of the alternating polymer and the energy distribution of the solar spectrum.7

In conclusion, a new alternating donor–acceptor semiconducting copolymer PDPP-T-DTT based on DPP acceptor units and DTT donor units has been synthesized and characterized. The polymer is shown to demonstrate excellent OTFT performance by having a high saturation hole mobility of 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFT devices. The good solution processability of the polymer, coupled with the ability to be used as semiconductor thin films without the need for thermal annealing leads to a more efficient fabrication process, which would potentially enable high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing of large-area OTFT electronic arrays and circuits. Initial bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the blends of the copolymer with PC71BM had a power conversion efficiency of 3.44% under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 solar illumination.
