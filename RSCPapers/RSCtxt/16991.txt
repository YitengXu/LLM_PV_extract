    , Accepted 7th May 2014First published on 8th May 2014AbstractA single-step hydrothermal synthesis of a TiO2–Mil-125 composite was applied for the first time to produce a depleted perovskite/TiO2–MOF heterojunction solar cell with 6.4% power conversion efficiency (PCE), characterized by durable stability in air.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive class of porous solids with potential applications in gas storage, separation, energy conversion and catalysis.1–5 The use of photoactive MOFs in photocatalytic processes6–9 and photoelectric solar energy converters10–12 has recently been reported. It has also been shown12 that coating the surface of titania particles with a nanoscale-thick layer of ZIF-8 resulted in a substantial increase in open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to inhibited interfacial charge recombination (TiO2/dye and TiO2/electrolyte) while producing dye-sensitised solar cells. However, under these conditions the environment and photocell operation time greatly affected the stability parameters. From this point of view, the application of TiO2–MOF composites as photoactive filling materials (Fig. 1a) with impregnation of methylammonium triiodoplumbate(II) (NH3Me)PbI3 crystals, corresponding to three-dimensional perovskite structures, led to the formation of a depleted quasi-bulk heterojunction TiO2–MOF-based solar cell (Fig. 1b).

Three-dimensional perovskite structures in contact with highly porous TiO2–MOF coatings possess a number of major advantages such as a large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility and high stability.13 In this work we have used highly photoactive MIL-125 (Ti8O8(OH)4-(O2C-C6H4-CO2)6, quasi-cubic tetragonal structure) as an attractive material based on the synthetic procedure described previously.16 Moreover, the single-step synthesis of a TiO2–MOF composite proposed in this work substantially simplifies the procedure of obtaining the corresponding materials. In the present case, the synthesis of MIL-125@TiO2 was carried out by adding H2O as a limiting reactant with respect to Ti(OC3H7)4 (see Table S1, ESI†) which resulted in step-by-step growth of a heterophase system. At the first step, as a result of hydrolysis and condensation of titanium isopropoxide, a titanium oxyhydroxide precipitate was formed. Through hydrothermal treatment, this was converted to the crystalline anatase phase. The formation of MIL-125 was apparently due to hydrothermal interaction of the hydrolysis products of titanium isopropoxide and yet unreacted terephthalic acid. The MOF content with respect to TiO2 was changed via the initial concentrations of chemicals, but did not exceed 5%, see Table S1 (ESI†). The as-synthesized solid was washed twice with methanol and dried at 200 °C to remove the solvent. The presence of a lightweight organic phase surrounding the anatase crystallites was indicated by EXAFS spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†) appearing as an overlap of anatase and MIL-125 spectra. The peak at 1.2 Å is most probably due to anomalous adsorption caused by partial reduction to TiIII. It was impossible to trace the formation of the MOF using large-angle X-ray scattering (Fig. S2, ESI†) and Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†) due to the small amount and weak diffraction with respect to the highly crystalline anatase. Also, the presence of –CO2 absorptions for the MIL-125–TiO2 composite as compared to pure terephthalic acid and TiO2 at 1692 and 1677 cm−1 (Fig. S2, ESI†) confirms coordination.14
These vibrations should not, however, be attributed only to the formed MOF, taking into account the probability of bonding to the anatase surface or the formation of hybrid phases as reported previously.15 The evidence of the formation of the MOF–TiO2 heterophase system is provided by TEM (Fig. 2a), HRTEM (Fig. 2b and c), and SAXS (Fig. 2d) images. As seen in the images, multicomponent composition of the material can be revealed only by a detailed analysis. The high resolution images demonstrated a long-range ordered structure only of anatase (Fig. 2c). For the MOF, no long-range structure was visible: instead, a pattern of wormhole porosity was observed (Fig. 2b). However, a peak in the SAXS images (Fig. 2d) at 6.7° confirms the presence of the 3D phase, in full agreement with previously performed X-ray powder diffraction analysis16 and corresponds to MIL-125.

Another confirmation of the presence of MIL-125, in contrast to other hybrid compounds,15 can be obtained from the thermal analysis data (see Fig. S4, ESI†) shown for the 3% MIL-125–TiO2 sample. The figure reveals that the mass loss occurred in two stages: first, the release of guest molecules, methanol and H2O, between 40 °C and 150 °C (6%), and second, degradation of the framework (between 360 and 400 °C, 3%). The absence of DMF in the analysed sample is confirmed by organic elemental analysis (OEA) (Table S2, ESI†). The data obtained are in agreement with those of MIL-12516 and rule out the possibility of formation of hybrids and titanium terephthalate whose thermal stability does not exceed 310 °C.
At the same time, as shown previously,12 the MOF content with respect to TiO2 should be within a specific range and not exceed 5%. This depends on two factors. On the one hand, a high content of a secondary phase provides a substantial decrease in current short circuit (Isc),12 but on the other hand, it causes an increase in Voc. This is due to the fact that the higher conduction band edge of MOFs leads to the transfer of photo-excited electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 (decreasing Isc) through the quantum tunneling effect, thus, the suppression effect on charge recombination may be strengthened by involving the growth of a secondary MOF phase (resulting in higher Voc values). Taking this into consideration, we have used in our synthesis the component ratios leading to the content of MIL-125 with respect to TiO2 which does not exceed 5%. It should be noted that in the present case the formation of the composite occurred during hydrothermal synthesis to produce MOFs on the surface of thick titania nanoproducts (Fig. 2a). Such an approach will certainly not allow for coating all the formed anatase particles with a thick porous MOF layer. However, even such a low MOF content of on the surface of anatase crystals promotes a substantial increase in the specific surface area. Low-temperature adsorption–desorption data indicate the formation of a developed micro-mesopore system and a high BET specific surface area of the 3% MIL-125–TiO2 sample (SBET = 525 m2 g−1, SLangmuir = 1033 m2 g−1, Fig. S6, ESI†). It is noteworthy that such a broad pore distribution is due to the microporous structure of MIL-125 and ink-bottle-like mesopores17 in between titania particles, as confirmed by a characteristic hysteresis shape (I and IV types), as well as by reduced values of average sizes for micro- and mesopores separately (Fig. S6b and c, ESI†). In addition, we have observed a fast photochromic effect upon UV-visible excitation (see Fig. S7a, ESI†). Using the suspension of the synthesised 3% MIL-125–TiO2 composite in methanol a high index of optical density was reached in 5 min, while imitating sunlight effects, thus proving the assumption of high photoactivity of the composite obtained. Determination of the optimal MOF concentration in the TiO2–MIL-125 composite structure was performed by photopolarisation measurements (the evaluation procedure is outlined in the ESI†). The photocurrent response measurement was carried out under visible light irradiation to investigate the photo-induced charge separation efficiency for MOF-doped TiO2 samples containing different amounts of MOFs. As shown in Fig. 3a, the photocurrent response attains its maximum at 3% MOF–TiO2 (39 μA cm−2). An increase in concentration to 5% does not result in an increase in photocurrent; in contrast, we have observed a decrease (35 μA cm−2). Typically, the increase of Voc is ascribed to the prohibited charge recombination due to the energy barrier effect of MOFs in titania. The suppression effect on charge recombination may be strengthened by involving a quantity MOFs, resulting in a higher Voc. However, the quantity of MOFs should be strictly limited, because of a significant decrease in Jsc, as shown in Table 1 and Ref. 12. The data obtained suggest that using MOFs as surface modifiers for TiO2 anodes18,22 while producing quasi-bulk perovskite-based solar cells is a matter of interest due to increased adsorption capacity, hence the heterojunction area. Three-dimensional structures have already been used as light harvesters for mesoscopic heterojunction solar cells.19 To assess the activity of the material 3% MOF@TiO2, we have constructed a depleted quasi-bulk heterojunction TiO2–MOF-based solar cell for the first time, as described in the ESI,† with a carbon counter-electrode. Previously, work on modifying TiO2 with perovskite nanocrystals has been performed13,18,20 to produce solid photocells with high stability and efficiency. We suggest increasing the area of the perovskite junction through the micro-mesoporous structure of the synthesised composite for inhibited interfacial charge recombination at the interface. Fig. 3b shows voltamperic characteristics of an operating photocell under dark and illuminated conditions versus time. The diode behaviour of the photocell with an increase of I–V characteristics with lighting is clearly observed. To assess the degree of efficiency of the constructed solar cell, we have plotted Voc against Isc (Fig. 3c). Under 100 mW cm−2 solar light the 3% MOF@TiO2-based monolithic device produced Voc = 0.85 V and Isc = 10.9 mA cm−2, corresponding to a PCE of 6.4%. These data demonstrate a substantial increase in PCE with respect to previous results18,21 and may be compared well to full printable mesoscopic titania-based heterojunction solar cells using non-modified carbon as a counter-electrode. Moreover, the constructed solar cell is characterised by durable stability in the ambient atmosphere. A change in η did not exceed 0.3% in dry air at room temperature without encapsulation for 30 days. These impressive results indicate superior stability to that of dye-sensitised solar cells.12

In conclusion, we have applied a single-step hydrothermal synthesis for the first time to produce a MIL-125@TiO2 composite, a highly photoactive material with good prospects for constructing quasi-bulk depleted monolithic perovskite/MOF @TiO2– heterojunction solar cells. SAXS, TG, EXAFS spectra and HRTEM data confirmed the presence of MIL-125 in the composite structure. Using TGA and EDS data, the MOF/anatase mass ratios were determined, which could be intentionally varied between 2 and 5%. The results of the photopolarisation measurements were employed to determine the optimal MOF concentration promoting the greatest photocurrent response. The greatest increase (39 μA cm−2) was found for 3% MOF–TiO2. A MIL-125@TiO2-based heterojunction solar cell revealed high stability over time (up to 30 days), with a PCE of about 6.4%. Thus, we have shown the possibility of using MOF@TiO2 composites for the successful production of solid solar cells with high stability.
