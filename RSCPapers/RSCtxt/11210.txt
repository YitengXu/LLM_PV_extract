    , Accepted 9th June 2022First published on 28th June 2022AbstractGlobal warming, air pollution, and energy insecurity are three of the greatest problems facing humanity. Roadmaps are developed and grid analyses are performed here for 145 countries to address these problems. The roadmaps call for a 100% transition of all-purpose business-as-usual (BAU) energy to wind-water-solar (WWS) energy, efficiency, and storage, ideally by 2035, but by no later than 2050, with at least 80% by 2030. Grid stability analyses find that the countries, grouped into 24 regions, can exactly match demand with 100% WWS supply and storage, from 2050–2052. Worldwide, WWS reduces end-use energy by 56.4%, private annual energy costs by 62.7% (from $17.8 to $6.6 trillion per year), and social (private plus health plus climate) annual energy costs by 92.0% (from $83.2 to $6.6 trillion per year) at a present-value cost of ∼$61.5 trillion. The mean payback times of the capital cost due to energy- and social-cost savings are 5.5 and 0.8 years, respectively. WWS is estimated to create 28.4 million more long-term, full-time jobs than lost worldwide and may need only ∼0.17% and ∼0.36% of world land for new footprint and spacing, respectively. Thus, WWS requires less energy, costs less, and creates more jobs than BAU. Sensitivity test indicate the following. Increasing district heating and cooling may reduce costs by allowing flexible loads to replace inflexible loads, thereby replacing electricity storage and overgeneration with low-cost heat storage. A battery cost that is 50% higher than in the base case increases mean overall energy costs by only 3.2 (0.03–14.5)%. Almost all regions need fewer hours of load shifting than assumed in the base case, suggesting that actual load shifting may be easier than assumed. Increasing the use of electricity for hydrogen fuel-cell-electric vehicles instead of for battery-electric vehicles increases overall cost in most regions tested, due to the greater efficiency of battery-electric vehicles, but decreases overall cost in some regions by improving grid stability. Finally, shifting battery vehicle charging from day-night to mostly day charging reduces cost in the regions tested; shifting to mostly night charging increases cost. Ninety-five percent of the technologies needed to implement the plans proposed are already commercial.

Broader context
The world is undergoing a transition to clean, renewable energy to reduce air pollution, global warming, and energy insecurity. To minimize damage, all energy should ideally be transitioned by 2035. Whether this occurs will depend substantially on social and political factors. One concern is that a transition to intermittent wind and solar will cause blackouts. To analyze this issue, we examine the ability of 145 countries grouped into 24 regions to avoid blackouts under realistic weather conditions that affect both energy demand and supply, when energy for all purposes originates from 100% clean, renewable (zero air pollution and zero carbon) Wind-Water-Solar (WWS) and storage. Three-year (2050–52) grid stability analyses for all regions indicate that transitioning to WWS can keep the grid stable at low-cost, everywhere. Batteries are the main electricity storage option in most regions. No batteries with more than four hours of storage are needed. Instead, long-duration storage is obtained by concatenating batteries with 4 hour storage. The new land footprint and spacing areas required for WWS systems are small relative to the land covered by the fossil fuel industry. The transition may create millions more long-term, full-time jobs than lost and will eliminate carbon and air pollution from energy.

1. Introduction
Global warming, air pollution, and energy insecurity remain three of the greatest problems facing the world. The Earth's average global warming from 2011 to 2020 compared with 1850 to 1900 was about 1.09 °C.1 If nothing is done, and, even if CO2 emissions stay constant at 2020 levels rather than rise, enough additional CO2 (500 billion tonnes) will accumulate in the air to warm the Earth 1.5 °C (with a 50% probability) relative to 1850–1900 levels, by 2032. Enough additional CO2 (850 billion tonnes) will accumulate to warm the Earth 2 °C by 2041.1
In 2019, 55.4 million people died worldwide.2 Air pollution contributed to about 7 million (12.6%) of the deaths, making it the second leading cause of death after heart disease.3 Of the air pollution deaths, ∼4.4 million were due to outdoor pollution and ∼2.6 million were due to indoor pollution. Indoor air pollution arises because 2.6 billion people burn fuels for cooking and heating indoors.3 Air pollution also causes hundreds of millions of illnesses (morbidities) each year. The deaths and illnesses arise when air pollution particles (mostly) and gases trigger or exacerbate heart disease, stroke, chronic obstruction pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema), lower respiratory tract infection (flu, bronchitis, and pneumonia), lung cancer, and asthma.
Energy insecurity is the third major problem due to business-as-usual (BAU) fuels. Energy insecurity arises for at least four reasons: diminishing availability of fossil fuels and uranium; reliance on centralized power plants and refineries; reliance on the need for a continuous supply of fuel that is subject to disruption arising from international war, civil war, embargos, bans, and labor disputes; and environmental damage due to continuous and widespread fuel mining and pollution.4,5
It is postulated here that a transition entirely to a clean, renewable wind-water-solar (WWS) electricity, heat, storage, transmission, and equipment system (Fig. S1, ESI†) will substantially reduce or eliminate these three problems and at low cost. Given their severity and their rapid growth, these problems must be addressed quickly. Ideally, 80% of the problems will be solved by 2030 and 100%, by 2035–2050 (Section 3.1). Given the goals of addressing air pollution and energy insecurity simultaneously with global warming, the transition must also avoid emissions of air pollutants and improve energy security. For these reasons, we do not include carbon capture (CC), direct air capture (DAC), bioenergy (B), nuclear power (N), or blue hydrogen (BH). Such technologies either increase or hold constant fuel mining (CC, DAC, BH), increase or hold constant air pollution (CC, DAC, B, BH), reduce little CO2 while locking in combustion pollution (CC, DAC, B, BH), are costly (CC, DAC, N), have long time lags between planning and operation (N), or carry meltdown, weapons proliferation, waste, and mining risks (N).4 Given that eliminating 80% of all emissions by 2030 and 100% by 2035–2050 with WWS, without these technologies, avoids 1.5 °C warming (Section 3.1), such non-WWS technologies are also not needed.
Many research groups have examined 100% renewable energy (RE) systems in one or all energy sectors and have found that RE systems keep the grid stable at low cost.6–39 Most closely related to this study, are studies to transition 139 countries21 and 143 countries25,35,36 to 100% WWS across all energy sectors while keeping the grid stable. All energy sectors include electricity, transportation, building heating/cooling, industry, agriculture-forestry-fishing, and the military. This study, which examines a transition of 145 countries, improves upon the previous studies in several respects.
First, two additional countries (Lao, PDR and Equatorial Guinea) are included beyond the 143-country studies. For grid stability analysis purposes, the 145 countries are grouped into 24 regions (Table 1), as in the 143-country studies.

Second, raw end-use energy consumption data for each sector in each country originate here from 2018 (the latest update)40 rather than from 201625,35,36 or 2012.21 Similarly, new cost data for electricity generation, storage, and installed nameplate capacities are used. The new costs, in particular, are lower than were the previous costs for several WWS technologies.
Third, a significant unique feature of this study is the calculation and use of building heating and cooling loads worldwide every 30 seconds for a full three years, 2050–2052. The loads are calculated consistently with wind and solar generation in each country using a weather prediction/climate model. In the previous base studies,25,40 such loads were estimated from daily heating and cooling degree day data.
Fourth, four-hour batteries are concatenated here to provide both long-duration electricity storage and substantial instantaneous peaking power. Because battery costs have dropped dramatically and because four-hour batteries are now readily available, it is now justifiable to include a larger penetration of batteries than in the previous studies.
Fifth, five new sensitivity tests are performed. In one, the fraction of district heating and cooling is increased in the most expensive regions, which are mostly small countries and islands, to examine the impact of increasing district heating and cooling on the cost of keeping the grid stable. In the second, the percent increases in the levelized and annual costs of energy are estimated when battery costs are 50% higher than those assumed in the base case. This sensitivity test is important because future battery costs are expected to drop but are uncertain, and a large share of electricity storage here is battery storage. In the third test, the maximum number of hours needed to shift a flexible load forward in time is reduced from a baseline value of eight hours to see how many hours of load shifting are actually needed in each region. If the maximum time needed is less than eight hours, then implementing demand response should be easier than proposed here. In the fourth test, the cost of increasing the penetration of electrolytic hydrogen fuel-cell-electric vehicles at the expense of battery-electric vehicles is examined. Finally, the cost of constant day and night versus mostly day versus mostly night battery-electric vehicle charging is examined.
2. Methodology
WWS electricity-generating technologies include onshore and offshore wind turbines (Wind); tidal and wave devices, geothermal electric power plants, and hydroelectric power plants (Water); and rooftop/utility solar photovoltaics (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) plants (Solar) (Fig. S1, ESI†). WWS heat generators include solar thermal and geothermal heat generators. WWS storage technologies include electricity, heat, cold, and hydrogen storage (Fig. S1, ESI†). WWS electricity must be transported via alternating current (AC), high-voltage AC (HVAC), and/or high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines and AC distribution lines. WWS equipment includes electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, heat pumps, induction cooktops, arc furnaces, resistance furnaces, lawn mowers, leaf blowers, etc. (Fig. S1, ESI†).
The main purpose of this analysis is to quantify the costs and benefits of moving from a business-as-usual (BAU) to a WWS energy system. The main steps are as follows:
(1) Project BAU end-use energy demand from 2018 to 2050 for each of seven fuel types in each of six energy-use sectors, for each of 145 countries in a spreadsheet (Note S2, ESI†);
(2) Estimate the 2050 reduction in demand due to electrifying or providing direct heat for each fuel type in each sector in each country and providing the electricity and heat with WWS (Note S2, ESI†);
(3) Perform resource analyses, then estimate mixes of wind-water-solar (WWS) electricity and heat generators required to meet the total demand in each country in the annual average (Note S2, ESI†);
(4) Use a prognostic global weather-climate-air pollution computer model (GATOR-GCMOM), which accounts for competition among wind turbines for available kinetic energy, to estimate wind and solar radiation fields and building heat and cold loads every 30 seconds for three years in each country (Note S3, ESI†);
(5) Group the 145 countries into 24 world regions and use a computer model (LOADMATCH) to match variable energy demand with variable energy supply, storage, and demand response (DR) in each region every 30 seconds, from 2050 to 2052 (Notes S4–S6, ESI†);
(6) Evaluate energy, health, and climate costs of WWS vs. BAU (Note S7, ESI†);
(7) Calculate land area requirements due to WWS energy generators (Note S8, ESI†);
(8) Calculate changes in WWS versus BAU employment numbers (Note S9, ESI†); and.
(9) Discuss and evaluate uncertainties (Main text).
In summary, three types of models are used: a spreadsheet model (Steps 1–3, Note S2, ESI†), a 3-D global weather-climate-air pollution model (GATOR-GCMOM) (Step 4, Note S3, ESI†), and a grid integration model (LOADMATCH) (Steps 5–8, Notes S4–S6, ESI†).
With regard to the spreadsheet calculations, 2018 end-use BAU energy consumption from IEA40 is first projected to 2050 for each country. End-use energy differs from primary energy (Note S2, ESI†). IEA provides end-use energy data for each of seven fuel types (oil, natural gas, coal, electricity, heat for sale, solar and geothermal heat, and wood and waste heat) in each of six energy sectors (residential, commercial, transportation, industrial, agriculture-forestry-fishing, and military-other) in each of 145 countries. These countries represent over 99.7% of world fossil-fuel CO2 emissions. The countries without data include primarily a handful of countries in Africa and several small island countries. The projections from 2018 to 2050 (Note S2, ESI†) are by fuel type, energy sector, and region of the world. They assume moderate economic growth, policy changes by world region, population growth, energy growth, use of some renewable energy, and modest energy efficiency measures.
2050 BAU end-use demand for each fuel type in each energy sector in each country is then converted to electricity, electrolytic hydrogen (primarily for use in fuel cells for long-distance, heavy transportation), or heat. The electricity and heat are then provided by WWS, using the conversion factors by fuel type and sector given in Table S3 (ESI†) (Note S2). The factors assume the use of equipment running primarily on electricity in each energy sector (Fig. S1, ESI†).
For example, air and water heat from fossil fuel burning, wood burning, and waste heat are converted to heat from air- and ground-source heat pumps running on WWS electricity. Existing solar and geothermal direct heating are retained as they are. Natural gas dryers and stoves are converted to heat pump dryers and electric induction stoves, respectively. As such, there is no need for any energy carrier, aside from electricity, in a building. Buildings also use more efficient appliances, LED lights, and better insulation (Fig. S1, ESI†).
High- and medium-temperature industrial processes are electrified with electric arc furnaces, induction furnaces, resistance furnaces, dielectric heaters, and electron beam heaters. Low-temperature heat for industry is provided by electric heat pumps and CSP steam (Fig. S1, ESI†). All electricity for industry is provided by WWS sources.
Liquid- and natural-gas-fueled vehicles are transitioned to battery-electric (BE) vehicles and some hydrogen fuel-cell-electric (HFC) vehicles, where the hydrogen is produced by electrolysis with WWS electricity (green, or electrolytic, hydrogen) (Fig. S1, ESI†). BE vehicles dominate all-distance light-duty ground transportation, construction machines, agricultural equipment, short- and moderate-distance (<1000 km) commercial trucks, trains (aside from those powered by electric rails or overhead wires), ferries, speedboats, ships, and short-haul (<1500 km) aircraft. Hydrogen fuel-cell-electric vehicles power all long-distance transport by road, rail, water, and air. They also power long-distance air, water, and land military transport.41 Gasoline lawnmowers, leaf blowers, and chainsaws are converted to electric equivalents.
Having technologies already available is critical for ensuring a rapid transition. Overall, about 95% of the technologies needed for a transition are already commercialized. The main technologies that are not commercialized are long-distance aircraft and ships powered by hydrogen fuel cells and some industrial processes. However, technical feasibility studies of long-distance transport with fuel cells have been performed.41
Once all annual-average BAU loads in 2050 are converted to electricity and heat loads to be met by WWS generators, WWS generator nameplate capacities are estimated for each of the 145 countries to meet the loads (Note S2, ESI†). Such estimates rely on a resource analysis for each country (Note S2, ESI†). Table S7 (ESI†), for example, shows the limits of residential and commercial rooftop PV by country, that cannot be exceeded.
2050 nameplate capacities of each generator for each country are then placed in the country's geographic boundaries within the GATOR-GCMOM model (Gas, Aerosol, Transport, Radiation, General Circulation, Mesoscale, and Ocean Model).42,43 The model simulates feedbacks among meteorology, solar and thermal-infrared radiation, gases, aerosol particles, cloud particles, oceans, sea ice, snow, soil, and vegetation. Model results have been compared with data in 34 peer-reviewed studies and with results from other models in 14 intercomparisons.25 GATOR-GCMOM accounts for the reduction in the wind's kinetic energy and speed due to the competition among wind turbines for available kinetic energy,42 the temperature-dependence of PV output,43 and the reduction in sunlight to, thus cooling of, buildings and the ground due to the conversion of radiation to electricity by solar PV, among other factors (Note S3, ESI†).
GATOR-GCMOM is run here for three years (2050–2052) on the global scale at 4° × 5° horizontal resolution and with 68 vertical layers up to 60 km, with the bottom five layers each having 30 m resolution. Modeled parameters are aggregated over each country and written to a file every 30 seconds for the three years. Such parameters include instantaneous electric power from onshore and offshore wind, solar rooftop PV, utility scale PV, and CSP; direct heat from solar thermal; and building heat and cold loads. Heat and cold loads are derived from modeled outdoor air temperatures, a specified indoor temperature, and assumptions about building areas and U-values35 (Note S3, ESI†). From the wind data, time-dependent wave power output is also derived.
The time-dependent data from the file are then input into LOADMATCH16,21,25,35,36 (Notes S4–S6, ESI†), which simulates the matching of energy demand with supply and storage over time. LOADMATCH is a trial-and-error simulation model. It works by running multiple simulations for each grid region, one at a time. Each simulation advances forward one timestep at a time, just as the real world does, for any number of years that sufficient input data are available for. The main constraint is that the sum of the electricity, heat, cold, and hydrogen loads plus losses, adjusted by demand response, must equal energy supply and storage during every timestep of the simulation. If load is not met during any timestep, the simulation stops. Inputs (either the nameplate capacity of one or more generators; the peak charge rate, peak discharge rate, or peak storage capacity; or characteristics of demand response) are then adjusted one at a time based on an examination of what caused the load mismatch (hence the description “trial-and-error” model). Another simulation is then run from the beginning. New simulations (usually less than 10) are run until load is met during each time step of the entire simulation. After load is met once, another 4–20 simulations are generally performed with further-adjusted inputs based on user intuition and experience to generate a set of solutions that match load during every timestep. The lowest cost solution in this set is then selected. Because LOADMATCH does not permit load loss at any time, it is designed to exceed the utility industry standard of load loss once every 10 years.
Table S2 (ESI†) summarizes processes in LOADMATCH. Note S4 (ESI†) describes the model's time-dependent inputs. Note S6 (ESI†) describes the model's order of operation, including how the model treats excess generation over demand and excess demand over generation.
Time-dependent loads are determined as follows. Annual average end-use WWS loads in each sector of each region from Table S5 (ESI†) are separated into (1) electricity and heat loads needed for low-temperature heating, (2) electric loads needed for cooling and refrigeration, (3) electricity loads needed to produce, compress, and store hydrogen for fuel cells used in transportation, and (4) all other electricity loads (including high-temperature industrial heat loads). Each of these loads is further divided into flexible and inflexible loads (Table S6, ESI†). Flexible loads include electricity and heat loads that can be used to fill cold and low-temperature heat storage, all electricity used to produce hydrogen (since all hydrogen can be stored), and remaining electricity and heat loads subject to demand response. Inflexible loads are all loads that are not flexible. The inflexible loads must be met immediately. Demand response can be used to shift flexible loads forward in time one time step at a time, but by no more than eight hours, until the loads are met. A sensitivity test is performed here to examine whether the limit can be less than eight-hours.
The continuous profiles of heat and cold loads from GATOR-GCMOM are then used to distribute 2050 annual-average inflexible and flexible loads into continuous time-dependent (30 s resolution) loads, as described in Note S5 (ESI†). Such loads and WWS supplies from GATOR-GCMOM for each of the 145 countries are subsequently summed to obtain time-dependent loads and supplies for each of the 24 world regions (Table 1). Maximum electricity, heat, and cold storage sizes and times are then estimated (Tables S13 and S14, ESI†).
LOADMATCH is run from 2050–2052 with 30 s timesteps in an effort to match all-sector demand with supply, storage, and demand-response in each of 24 world regions encompassing the 145 countries examined (Table 1). Once LOADMATCH simulations are complete, the resulting energy costs, health costs, and climate costs between WWS and BAU are estimated. All costs are evaluated with a social discount rate of 2 (1–3)%,25 since the analysis here is a social cost analysis. Social cost analyses are from the perspective of society, not of an individual or firm in the market. Thus, social cost analyses must use a social discount rate, even for the private-market-cost portion of the total social cost.25
3. Results
3.1. Energy demand and generation results

Fig. 1 shows two possible timelines to transition to 100% WWS. In both cases, an 80% transition occurs by 2030. In one case, 100% occurs by 2035; in the other, 100% occurs by 2050. The 2050 BAU and WWS end-use energy consumptions and generator mixes are the same in both cases. If the second timeline (80% by 2030 and 100% by 2050) is met, and if 80% and 100% of 2020 non-energy emissions are also eliminated by 2030 and 2050, respectively, then about 340 billion additional tonnes of CO2 will accumulate in the air by 2050. Accordingly, such a transition timeline will avoid 1.5 °C warming because it will result in less than the 500 billion tonne accumulated-CO2 emission allowance.1 To reduce climate damage further and to reduce the enormous loss of life from air pollution and the dangers due to energy insecurity, a 2035 timeline for a complete transition is also proposed.
 Fig. 1  Timeline for transitioning 145 countries to 100% WWS by 2035 (first panel) and 2050 (second panel), with 80% by 2030 in both cases. The figures also show five types of reductions in energy requirements that occur along the way. Table S4 (ESI†) provides the energy data for the figure and for each of the 145 countries. Table S12 (ESI†) provides the 2050 percent mix of WWS resources for the figure and for each of the 24 regions. 

Fig. 1 and Table 2 (and Table S4 for each country, ESI†), indicate that transitioning from BAU to 100% WWS in 145 countries reduces 2050 annual average end-use power demand by an average of 56.4%. Of this, 38.4 percentage points are due to the efficiency of using WWS electricity over combustion; 11.3 percentage points are due to eliminating energy in the mining, transporting, and refining of fossil fuels; and 6.64 percentage points are due to end-use energy efficiency improvements and reduced energy use beyond those with BAU. Of the 38.4% reduction due to the efficiency advantage of WWS electricity, 20.5 percentage points are due to the efficiency advantage of WWS transportation, 4.3 percentage points are due to the efficiency advantage of using WWS electricity for industrial heat, and 13.6 percentage points are due to the efficiency advantage of using heat pumps instead of combustion heaters. Whereas all-purpose energy demand declines by 56.4%, the remaining energy is almost all electricity (with some direct heat), causing world-average electricity consumption to increase by 85% compared with BAU (Table 2).

Column (k) provides the percentage decreases in 2050 total BAU load due to transitioning from BAU to WWS, including the effects of lower energy use arising from (h) the higher work to energy ratio of electricity over combustion, (i) eliminating energy use for the upstream mining, transporting, and/or refining of coal, oil, gas, biofuels, bioenergy, and uranium, and (j) policy-driven increases in end-use efficiency beyond those in the BAU case. Column (l) is the ratio of the 2050 electricity load (= all energy load) with WWS to that with BAU. Although column (l) shows that WWS increases electricity consumption versus BAU, column (k) shows that WWS decreases all energy consumption

2018 BAU values are from IEA.40 Table S2 (ESI), footnote, defines the sectors. 2018 values are projected to 2050 as described in Note S2 (ESI). The transportation load includes, among other loads, energy produced in each country for aircraft and shipping. 2050 WWS values are estimated from 2050 BAU values assuming electrification of end-uses and effects of additional energy-efficiency measures beyond those in the BAU case, as described in Note S3 (ESI). Of the 38.4% reduction due to electrifying end-uses, 20.5, 4.3, and 13.6 percentage points are due to the efficiency of electric transport, industrial heat, and building heat, respectively.

From the annual average 2050 end-use load data for each country (Table S4, ESI†), generator nameplate capacities are estimated by country in a spreadsheet.44 LOADMATCH simulations are initiated with these estimates and then run. If load is not met, nameplate capacities and other parameters are adjusted until load is met for all three years, at which point the nameplate capacities are final (Table S9, ESI†). The following percentages of final nameplate capacities needed in 2050, averaged over all countries, had already been installed as of 2020: onshore wind-7.56%; offshore wind-0.8%; residential rooftop PV-4.13%; commercial/government rooftop PV-2.39%; utility PV-2.61%; CSP-1.54%; geothermal electricity-14.4%; hydropower-100%; tidal power-0.001%; and wave power-2.76%.
The ratio of the final nameplate capacity needed to meet continuous load (from LOADMATCH) to that needed to meet annually-averaged load (from the spreadsheet44) is the capacity adjustment factor (Table S10, ESI†). Table 3 shows that only 13% more generator nameplate capacity is needed, summed over all 145 countries, to meet continuous 2050 load than to meet annually-averaged 2050 load. The difference is due to oversizing generation in order to meet continuous load. Storage (Table S13, ESI†) is also needed to meet continuous load.

All values are summed over 145 countries in 24 regions, except values in column (d) are outputs by energy device, summed over all countries divided by total load plus losses among all countries. “Annual average load plus losses” is all-purpose end-use energy demand plus losses per year divided by 8760 hours per year. “Initial” nameplate capacities (meeting annual-average demand) are nameplate capacities at the start of a LOADMATCH simulation. “Final” nameplate capacities are those needed to match load plus losses after LOADMATCH simulations. Table S9 (ESI) gives final nameplate capacities by country/region. Table S8 (ESI) gives nameplate capacities already installed by country/region in 2020. Table S12 (ESI) gives values in column (d) by region.

Table S11 (ESI†) gives average capacity factor (CF) by generator and region over the three-year simulations. The mean modeled CF of wind offshore of the China region, for example, was ∼37.2%. Mean annual wind speeds offshore of China at 100 m hub height are mostly 7–8 m s−1 (giving CFs of 29–37%), but with a hotspot of >9.5 m s−1 (CF of 51%) offshore of the Fujian province.45 The three-year CF of 37.2%, determined here from GATOR-GCMOM, appears consistent with this source.

Table 3 and Table S12 (ESI†) give the 2050–2052 mix of electricity plus heat produced (including both load and losses) from each energy generator, averaged over all 145 countries and for each region, respectively. 46.0% of all energy produced among all countries is solar and 45.0% is wind. The Russia region has the highest percent of energy from wind (77.4%). Israel had the highest percent from solar (83.7%).
3.2. Storage results
The total battery storage capacity among all 145 countries is 84.51 TWh per cycle (Table S13, ESI†). For comparison, the total hydropower storage capacity in reservoirs is ∼4567 TWh per year, which is close to the 2020 world hydropower output.46 Thus, the annual storage capacity of hydropower is equivalent to the annual storage of all batteries cycling 54 times. The number of battery cycles needed per year in the simulations varied from 0 to 290, with eight regions needing less than 54 cycles per year (Table S14, ESI†). The comparison between hydropower and batteries is relevant because existing hydropower will be used for both baseload and peaking power (like a battery) in a future with high penetrations of intermittent renewables on the grid. Since all batteries store enough energy to supply power for four hours at the peak discharge rate of the batteries, the total peak discharge rate of batteries among all countries is 21.13 TW. For comparison, that of hydropower is 1.16 TW (Table S13, ESI†), which is also currently available in these countries (Table S8, ESI†). Thus, battery storage in this study meets higher peaks in electricity demand than does conventional hydropower.
The world also has up to 3200 TWh of low-cost and 23200 TWh of low and high-cost pumped hydropower storage (PHS) capacity potential.47 Both capacities are much greater than the 14.7 TWh of PHS and 84.51 TWh of batteries proposed here across 145 countries (Table S13, ESI†). As such, PHS could be substituted for batteries in many situations. In fact, the cost per storage capacity of PHS is lower than that of batteries (Table S18, ESI†), and PHS does not require mining or chemicals. Whereas more PHS is possible, batteries are often preferred because they are easier to site and face fewer objections during permitting.
All batteries here are assumed to store electricity for four hours at their peak discharge rate. To obtain longer storage, batteries are concatenated in series. In other words, if 8 h storage is needed, then one 4 h battery is depleted before a second 4 h battery is depleted. Minimizing hours of storage maximizes the flexibility of batteries to meet peaks in demand (GW) and also to store electricity for long periods (GW h). For example, suppose 100 batteries, each with 4 h storage and each with a peak discharge rate of 10 kW, are concatenated. This allows for either 400 hours of storage at a peak discharge rate of 10 kW or 4 hours of storage at a peak discharge rate of 1000 kW, or anything in between.
In sum, batteries with longer than 4 h storage are not necessary for keeping the grid stable since batteries can be concatenated in series to obtain longer-duration storage. However, storage times of greater than four hours and up to 62.1 hours, while not needed, can be advantageous for a region. Batteries with storage times longer than ∼62.1 hours are never needed nor advantageous in the present study.
The ratio of the maximum storage capacity (TWh) to the maximum battery discharge rate (TW) that actually occurs during each simulation ranges from four hours for Russia and South America to 62.1 hours for Taiwan [Table S14, Column (f), ESI†]. This ratio is the maximum number of hours of storage ever needed at the maximum discharge rate that actually occurs during a simulation. If this ratio exceeds four hours (the number of hours of storage at the peak discharge rate assumed for all simulations), then the battery peak discharge rate assumed is greater than that needed, so the peak discharge rate assumed can be decreased, without any impact on the results, if the number of hours of storage at that peak discharge rate is proportionately increased in order to maintain constant storage capacity.
For example, for Taiwan, if the battery storage time were increased from four to 62.1 hours, the peak discharge rate could be reduced from 1300 GW (Table S13, ESI†) to 1300 GW × 4 hours/62.1 hours = 84 GW while maintaining the same maximum storage capacity (5.2 TWh). If this occurs, then Taiwan's maximum storage capacity and maximum discharge rate will both be reached sometime during the simulation. With four hours of storage, only the maximum storage capacity is reached. With more than 62.1 hours of storage and a 84 GW maximum discharge rate (which is reached), the maximum storage capacity is never reached, which is why there is no need for storage longer than 62.1 hours.
Finally, models that use one-hour time steps will predict lower peak discharge rates, thus higher ratios of peak storage capacity to peak discharge (more hours of battery storage needed) than models using a 30 s time step, such as the one used here. As such, models using a one-hour time step may incorrectly conclude that long-duration batteries are needed. The reason is that one-hour time steps intrinsically result in lower peak discharge rates than 30 s time steps because the average peak discharge rate over one hour is an average over 30 s peak discharge rates that are both higher and lower than the average. A 30 s time step captures the highest of these values. A one-hour time step does not. It captures only the average among all 30 s values.
3.3. Cost results
The net present value of the capital cost to transition all 145 countries while keeping the grid stable is $61.5 trillion (USD 2020), with new electricity and heat generators comprising $45.7 trillion of this (Table 4 and Tables S19, S20, ESI†). The remaining costs are for electricity, heat, cold, and hydrogen storage; hydrogen electrolysis and compression; heat pumps for district heating; and long-distance transmission. It is assumed simplistically that the present value of the capital cost of new electric appliances and machines (e.g., heat pumps for buildings, electric vehicles, industrial equipment) equals the present value of the capital plus fuel costs of their fossil-fuel counterparts. If WWS did not replace BAU, most appliances and machines would be replaced in any case within 15 years with BAU versions, so these costs are not reported as new capital costs required. Individual regional capital costs range from $2.8 billion for Iceland to $13.3 trillion for the China region. The cost to the U.S. is ∼$6.7 trillion, and the cost for Europe is ∼$5.9 trillion. The proposed annual outlay of capital follows the same trajectory as the proposed pace of transition shown in Fig. 1, namely 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035 or 2050. Table S19 (ESI†) provides a breakdown by components of the resulting levelized cost of energy (LCOE).

Among all 145 countries, the 2050 BAU annual social cost is $83.2 trillion per year, which consists of a 2050 private energy cost ($17.8 trillion per year), health cost ($33.6 trillion per year), and climate cost ($31.8 trillion per year) (Table 4 and Table S20, ESI†). To determine BAU energy costs across all sectors, we assume that the BAU cost per unit-all-energy equals the BAU cost per unit-electricity. This assumption is needed since BAU costs in non-electricity sectors are not readily available whereas those in the electricity sector are. Because annual WWS social (and private) costs are an order of magnitude lower than are corresponding BAU costs, this assumption should make no difference in the conclusions drawn here.
Thus, switching to 100% WWS reduces both social and private energy costs to $6.6 trillion per year, or by 92.0% and 62.7%, respectively (Table 4 and Table S20, ESI†). The significant decrease in private energy cost between BAU and WWS occurs because WWS reduces energy demand by 56.4% (Tables 2 and 4) and the cost per unit energy by 14.3%. The decrease in social energy cost occurs because WWS eliminates health and climate costs as well. In summary, the WWS annual social energy cost is only 8% that of BAU, and the WWS annual private energy cost is only 37.3% that of BAU.
Because the BAU annual energy cost and annual social cost are both much greater than is the annual social (= energy) cost of WWS (Table 4), continuing to use the existing BAU fossil-fuel infrastructure for even one year costs society tremendously.
The WWS capital cost divided by the difference between the BAU and WWS annual private and social energy costs is the payback time due to the WWS private and social cost savings, respectively. The 145-country payback time due to annual private energy cost savings is a mean of 5.5 years, with a range of 0.9 to 21.9 years for different countries. That due to social cost savings is 0.8 (0.1–6.7) years. Thus, the capital cost of WWS pays for itself with energy, health, and climate cost savings rapidly. The amount paid back is through energy sales rather than subsidies.
Among all world regions, the WWS LCOE, averaged between 2020 and 2050, that results in a stable grid, is 8.54 ¢ per kWh (Table 4 and Table S19, ESI†). This cost is dominated by the costs of electricity generation (3.80 ¢ per kWh), distribution (2.38 ¢ per kWh), short-distance transmission (1.05 ¢ per kWh), battery storage (0.55 ¢ per kWh), hydrogen production (0.31 ¢ per kWh), long-distance transmission (0.17 ¢ per kWh), underground heat storage (0.09 ¢ per kWh), geothermal plus solar heat generation (0.08 ¢ per kWh), heat pumps for district heating (0.07 ¢ per kWh), CSP and pumped hydro storage (0.03 ¢ per kWh), and hot water storage (0.01 ¢ per kWh). The range of the average LCOE among all 24 regions is from 6.5 ¢ per kWh (Canada) to 12.6 ¢ per kWh (South Korea).
The 2020–2050 average WWS LCOE is relatively low for large regions (e.g., Africa, Australia, Canada, China region, Europe, India region, Middle East, Russia region, and the United States) and for small countries with good WWS resources (e.g., Iceland, New Zealand) (Table 4). Large land areas permit greater geographical dispersion of wind and solar. Connecting geographically-dispersed renewable resources via the grid reduces overall intermittency. Large land areas also have a good balance of solar and wind, which are complementary in nature. Finally, large regions often have existing hydropower that can provide peaking power. Iceland also has substantial hydropower, along with geothermal and wind.
LCOEs are highest in small countries with high population densities (e.g., Cuba, Israel, Mauritius, South Korea, and Taiwan). Nevertheless, the 2050 WWS annual private energy cost in all these regions is 39% to 55% lower than that of BAU. Thus, a move to WWS reduces annual energy costs substantially, even in the lowest-benefit cases.
Of the 5.3 million air pollution deaths per year from energy expected in 2050 in a BAU scenario, about 27.3% are expected to occur in India and 20.6% in China (Table S21, ESI†). The CO2e emissions in China alone are 26.3% of all emissions among the 145 countries and more than the sum of emissions from 128 of the 145 countries (Table S21, ESI†). The 2nd-through-16th top emitting countries emit 48% of all CO2e emissions. The 145-country average BAU health and climate costs ($591 and $558 per tonne-CO2e, respectively) are similar to each other, but both are much higher than the BAU energy cost ($313 per tonne-CO2e) (Table S21, ESI†). Combining these three numbers gives the BAU social cost ($1460 per tonne-CO2e). Transitioning to WWS, on the other hand, has only an energy cost associated with it, which is only $117 per tonne-CO2e-eliminated, thus only 8% the cost of not eliminating BAU emissions.
3.4. Land area and employment change results
Averaged over 145 countries, the new WWS infrastructure requires ∼0.17% of the 145-country land for footprint and ∼0.36% of the land for spacing (Fig. 2 and Table S23, ESI†). The maximum onshore wind spacing area required for any country is 2.56% (Germany). If this land spacing cannot be accommodated, some of the onshore wind can be shifted offshore. Similarly, utility PV that occupies more than 2% of a country's land footprint is proposed to be shifted to floating offshore PV. This occurs only in small countries/administrative regions with coastal access (e.g., Bahrain, Curacao, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Malta, Qatar, and Singapore). Alternatively, it can be shifted to more rooftop PV or offshore wind. Alternatively, these locales may import the additional WWS electricity from neighboring countries, either through a common land border or an undersea cable. Interconnecting is more cost effective, particularly in such cases where WWS resources are tight in a country.36
 Fig. 2  New land area (km2) required for footprint on the ground, which applies to utility PV + CSP + ST (solar thermal) and geothermal electricity and heat, and for spacing, which applies to onshore wind, among the 145 countries examined. Ocean spacing areas for new offshore wind, tidal, and wave power are also shown as is the area for new rooftop PV, which doesn't require new land. No new land for hydropower is needed. The values are determined by dividing the difference between the world total new plus existing nameplate capacities from Table S9 (ESI†) and the world total existing nameplate capacities from Table S8 (ESI†) by the installed power densities from Table S22 (ESI†). 
WWS may produce 55.6 million new long-term, full-time jobs. Also, 27.2 million jobs may be lost, for a net increase of 28.4 million long-term, full-time jobs produced among the 145 countries (Table S25, ESI†). Job numbers account for construction and operation jobs in energy generation, transmission, and storage. The numbers also account for direct jobs, indirect jobs, and induced jobs (Note S9, ESI†). Net jobs increase in 21 out of 24 world regions. Net losses occur in Africa, Canada, and the Russia region. These regions depend heavily on fossil fuels. However, more jobs, not accounted for here, may arise from the need to build more electrical appliances and to improve building energy efficiency.
3.5. Energy conservation and grid stability
LOADMATCH exactly conserves energy over the three-year simulations for every region. For example, “End-use load plus losses” for “All regions” in Table S15 (ESI†) equals 11719 GW averaged over the simulations, and this exactly equals “Supply plus changes in storage.” Of that total, 8880.5 GW is “annual average end-use load,” which is the exact total, within roundoff error, shown in Table S4 (ESI†) for “All Countries.” Among all regions, ∼6.5% of end-use load plus losses are transmission, distribution, and downtime losses; 2.4% are losses going in and out of storage, 15.8% are losses due to shedding; and the rest (75.3%) is load. Iceland has the lowest percentage of shedding (0%). Israel has the highest percentage (38.1%).
Further, no load loss occurred at any time in any region (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. 3, for example, shows this for China, whose CO2e emissions are greater than the combined emissions of 128 of the 145 countries examined. Two reasons that 100% WWS keeps the grid stable are (1) the positive correlation between building heat load and wind energy supply in cold regions and (2) the negative correlation between wind energy supply and solar energy supply in all world regions (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2, ESI†). Correlations between heat load and wind supply are very strong or strong in 11 regions and moderate in another five regions (Table S26, ESI†). The only regions where they are negative are in warm countries (Cuba and the Philippines). Ref. 35 found similar results for the same regions, but here, data were available for three years rather than one year, thus for more extreme and diverse weather conditions. Likely due to the longer time series, the correlations here are very strong or strong in three more regions than in ref. 35. Correlations are strongest mostly for large, cold regions (Canada, Europe, Russia, China, United States) but also for Central America. The implication of this result is that electrifying building heating with electric heat pumps and simultaneously increasing wind electricity supply in most countries improves their ability to match overall load at low cost. Similarly, since wind and solar are complementary in nature, combining wind with solar provides more hours of overall power, facilitating the matching of overall load with supply.

First row: modeled time-dependent total WWS power generation versus load plus losses plus changes in storage plus shedding for the full three-year simulation period. Second row: solar PV + CSP electricity production, onshore plus offshore wind electricity production, building total cold load, and building total heat load (as used in LOADMATCH), summed over each region for 10 days; third row: correlation plots of building heat load versus wind power output and wind power output versus solar power output, obtained from all hourly data during the simulation. Table S26 (ESI†) summarizes the correlations. The model was run at 30 s resolution. Results are shown hourly, so units are energy output (TWh) per hour increment, thus also in units of power (TW) averaged over the hour. No load loss occurred during any 30 s interval. Fig. S2 (ESI†) provides these and additional plots for all regions. 
4. Discussion
4.1. Comparison with previous global studies
The results from this study can be compared most directly with those from ref. 25, the 143-country/24 region study, which was based on energy data from 2016 rather than 2018. That study relied less on battery storage and more on CSP storage than here, because at the time, battery costs were higher than today. That study also obtained building heating and cooling loads from heating and cooling degree data by country rather than from a weather prediction model in which heating and cooling loads were calculated consistently with wind and solar generation. That study found 57.1%, 61%, and 91% reductions in annual energy need, annual private cost, and annual social cost, respectively, for WWS versus BAU, compared with 56.4%, 62.7% and ∼92% reductions, respectively, found here. The slightly lower energy benefit here reflects the slightly lesser reduction in energy requirements due to eliminating the energy needed to mine/transport/refine fuels in the present study versus in the previous study. The greater cost reduction here reflects the lower cost per unit energy of WWS versus BAU in the present study. The consistency in overall results reflects the robustness of the conclusions despite the differences in input data and some methods used.
A relevant independent previous global study of 100% renewables is that of Ram et al.27 That study similarly concludes that “a global transition to 100% renewable energy across all sectors – power, heat, transport, and desalination before 2050 is feasible.” Conclusions in that study were reached with an optimization model with an hour time step versus a trial-and-error model with a 30 s time step used here (Note S4, ESI†). That study also assumed the production of synthetic combustion fuels from renewable electricity and biofuels produced from sustainable agriculture, neither of which are included in WWS studies. It also proposed/modeled a greater fraction of end use electricity from solar PV. The present study has a more even mix of wind and PV. Despite these differences, the overall conclusion is similar, strengthening the results found in both studies. Dozens of additional papers6–39 have also affirmed the feasibility and low-cost nature of 100% renewable electricity or all energy in different parts of the world.
Another global study examining 100% renewables is described in Teske.24 In that study, a global climate model coupled with energy-related modules was used to examine the impact of electrifying all energy and providing all electricity with renewables while also reducing non-energy greenhouse gas emissions. It concludes that electrifying, then deploying available 100% renewables and efficiency while increasing reforestation and decreasing deforestation as fast as possible, can avoid 1.5 °C warming at low cost while creating jobs. Thus, the main conclusion, that a transition to 100% renewables at low cost is similar to that found here. However, that study did not examine transitions in individual countries. It also treated balancing supply with demand at the hour time scale versus the 30 second time scale here. None of the studies above examined the impact of concatenating batteries or of calculating building heating and cooling loads from the climate model.
4.2. Uncertainty about transmission system
This study has many uncertainties. One is the assumption of a perfectly-interconnected transmission system in each region. The regions simulated here (Table 1) cover different spatial scales, from 11 relatively small regions (Cuba, Haiti-Dominican Republic, Iceland, Israel, Jamaica, Japan, Mauritius, New Zealand, Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan) to the continental scale. In all cases, perfectly-interconnected transmission is assumed, but transmission and distribution costs and losses in each region are accounted for. For example, transmission plus distribution costs here comprise an average of 42.1 (27.2–55.9)% of the total LCOE, with distribution costs alone comprising 27.8 (18.9–36.4)% of the total LCOE (Table S19, ESI†). The ranges encompass the lowest and highest regional values. On average, among all regions, 6.5% of all energy produced is lost during transmission and distribution (Table S16, ESI†). Long-distance HVDC transmission is added in 16 out of 24 regions (Table S14, ESI†). Whereas the perfect-transmission assumption causes the greatest cost uncertainty with respect to the larger domains, it causes less uncertainty with respect to the 11 small domains, since they are already well-interconnected. However, since the larger regions have more land available for low-cost utility PV and onshore wind, the cost of energy in such regions is generally lower than in the smaller regions before transmission is considered. Thus, a higher cost of transmission than estimated in big regions would still mean low-cost energy in those regions. Finally, because stable solutions are found for domains of all sizes, this assumption has no impact on the ability of grids to stay stable, only on the cost of grid stability, as shown in ref. 36.
4.3. Uncertainty about future load and WWS supply
Another uncertainty is whether the time-dependent load and supply data are sufficiently representative of the real world in 2050 and whether they capture extreme weather. First, the GATOR-GCMOM simulations were run under 2050 climate, greenhouse gas, and natural and anthropogenic pollutant emission conditions after all energy was converted to WWS. Second, since GATOR-GCMOM predicts the weather continuously worldwide, the simulations account statistically for extreme weather events. Third, all wind and solar supplies in GATOR-GCMOM are calculated in the same model and simultaneously with building heat and cold loads and are at a resolution of 30 seconds.
4.4. Uncertainty about simulation duration
A related uncertainty is whether three years is a sufficient simulation period to account for variations in weather and costs of energy. For some previous analyses, LOADMATCH simulated for six years16 and five years.21 Stable grids were found in all cases while accounting for variable and extreme weather. In all cases, like here, WWS costs were substantially lower than BAU costs. As such, it seems unlikely that a longer simulation would make much difference in the main conclusions here.
4.5. Uncertainty about whether real grid will stay stable
A further uncertainty is whether the grid will stay stable in the real world even though the model indicates it will. Whereas the LOADMATCH model is designed to ensure no loss of load, which is a stricter requirement than the industry standard of a loss of load once every ten years, the model examines only a finite set of conditions. In the real world, many more conditions arise. This could give rise to grid instability. However, we assume that real grid planners will build a 100% WWS grid step by step and put sufficient safeguards in to ensure grid stability by the time 100% WWS is reached.
4.6. Sensitivity of overall LCOE to battery costs
Another uncertainty is about the cost estimates used. This uncertainty is captured by the use of low, mean, and high energy, air pollution damage, and climate damage costs. For example, Table S17 (ESI†) gives low, mean, and high estimates of capital cost, operation and maintenance cost, decommissioning cost, energy generator lifetimes, and transmission/distribution/downtime losses. Table S18 (ESI†) gives ranges in storage costs. Ref. 50 provides the resulting low and high costs in each region.
To illustrate the sensitivity of results to cost estimates, we analyze the impact of a 2035 battery system cost of $90 kW−1 h−1-electricity-storage (in 2020 USD) instead of the baseline cost of $60 kW−1 h−1 (Table S18, ESI†). This sensitivity test is relevant because, although battery system cost is declining rapidly, it is possible it may not decline to $60 kW−1 h−1 by 2035. Results (Fig. 4 and Table S19, ESI†) indicate that a 50% higher battery system cost increases both overall LCOE and total annual energy costs by 3.2 (0.03–14.5)%, with the mean being the world average and the variation being the lowest and highest increase among all regions. This result indicates that, even if battery system cost is 50% higher than estimated here, both the LCOE and annual energy cost are still much lower than in the BAU case. For example, worldwide, the new total LCOE and annual cost would be 8.84 ¢ per kWh and $6.86 trillion per year, respectively, which are still 11.4% and 61.4% lower, respectively, than in the BAU case (Table 4).
 Fig. 4  Sensitivity of the overall 2050 levelized cost of energy (LCOE) with WWS, in 2020 USD, to a 50% higher battery cost ($90 instead of $60 kW−1 h−1-electricity storage). Red is the baseline cost (Table 4). Green is the incremental cost due to higher-cost batteries. 
4.7. Sensitivity of overall LCOE to district heating penetration
A related uncertainty is the extent to which district heating and cooling will be implemented. The baseline case assumes 23 (0–92)% worldwide of building heating and cooling may be subject to district heating and cooling (Table S14, ESI†). All but four regions, Iceland (92%), Europe (50%), Russia region (50%), and China region (30%) are assumed to have 20% or less district heating. About 92% of buildings in Iceland are currently subject to district heating. The current percent district heating in some other countries are as follows: Latvia (65%), Denmark (63%), Estonia (62%), Lithuania (57%), Sweden (>50%), Finland (>50%), Poland (>50%), Northern China (>50%), and Russia (>50%).48
An important question is the impact of an increase in the fraction of district heating and cooling on the storage and overgeneration requirements, thus the cost of energy. Whereas more district heating and cooling requires more centralized thermal energy storage and electric heat pumps to provide heat and cold for that storage, more district heating/cooling also creates more flexible loads that do not need instantaneous electricity. This means that less battery storage and electricity overgeneration are needed to meet immediate demand for electric heat pumps in buildings. As such, more district heating means more-expensive electricity storage and overgeneration may be replaced with lower-cost heat/cold storage and centralized heat pumps. District heating also requires pipes and other infrastructure to bring heat and cold to buildings. However, it avoids the need for heat pumps, hot water tanks, and associated electrical wiring in individual building. Before its impact on grid stability is taken into account, district heating/cooling may be less expensive than decentralized heating/cooling, even for piping district heat and cold to areas outside of a city.49 For this reason, we assume the additional cost of pipes and other non-energy/storage infrastructure associated with large-scale district heating is offset by the non-energy infrastructure cost of a decentralized system, so don’t include either in our calculation.
Results here indicate that increasing the fraction of district heating/cooling uniformly decreases overall LCOE. This is because it decreases battery and/or offshore wind oversizing requirements, thus their costs, more than it increases thermal energy storage and additional centralized heat pump needs and their costs (Fig. 5 and Fig. S3, ESI†). The cost reduction is particularly beneficial for small countries, including island countries, where the base LCOE with 100% WWS is high. Increasing the penetration of district heating/cooling substantially is more difficult in large countries due to the long distances many buildings are from urban areas in big countries. The purpose of these sensitivities is not to suggest that the fraction of district heating/cooling will rise to near 100%, but just to show the incremental impact of an increase or decrease in the fraction.
 Fig. 5  Sensitivity of the levelized cost and some of its components to the fraction of all buildings in two countries where hot and cold air and hot water are supplied by district heating and cooling. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows results for additional countries/regions. The components included are the cost of batteries, thermal storage, and/or total electricity generation. Thermal storage costs include the costs of UTES, HW-STES, CW-STES, ICE storage, and heat pumps to provide heat and cold for thermal energy storage (Table S19, ESI†). The only component of total electricity generation that is changing is the quantity of offshore wind. The low fraction district heating and cooling is the baseline value for each country and gives the baseline LCOE given in Table 4. 
4.8. Sensitivity of results to hours of load shifting
Another uncertainty is whether the assumed maximum number of hours of load shifting for flexible loads is necessary. In the baseline case, flexible loads can be shifted forward with demand response by up to eight hours in LOADMATCH. Sensitivity simulations were run in each region to examine whether the exact same result, including LCOE, could be obtained with fewer than eight hours of maximum load shifting. The result is that eight hours was needed in only two of the 24 regions (Table S14, ESI†). Five regions needed no load shifting. Six regions needed a maximum of two hours. Nine regions needed a maximum of four hours. Two regions needed a maximum of six hours. As such, load shifting may be less necessary and easier to implement in most regions than assumed in this study.
4.9. Sensitivity of overall LCOE to hydrogen vehicle penetration
Another uncertainty is the extent of the future adoption of electrolytic hydrogen fuel-cell-electric versus battery-electric vehicles. The base case here assumes44 that 24% of oil-based fuels and 5% of natural-gas-based fuels used for transportation will be replaced with enough electricity to produce hydrogen to run equivalent fuel-cell-electric vehicles, mostly for long-distance airplanes, ships, trains, trucks, and military vehicles. The rest will be replaced with electricity for battery-electric vehicles. Sensitivity tests are run here to examine cases in some countries, where 5% and 50%, instead of 24%, of oil-based fuels are replaced with enough electrolytic hydrogen for fuel-cell-electric vehicles (with no change in the replacement of natural-gas-based fuels).
Using electricity to produce hydrogen for fuel-cell-electric vehicles instead of for battery-electric vehicles has two major opposing impacts on cost. It increases cost since the plug-to-wheel efficiency of short- and moderate-distance electrolytic hydrogen fuel-cell-electric vehicles is much less than that of same-range battery-electric vehicles. This disadvantage of hydrogen decreases then disappears in the limit for long-distance vehicles due to the wasted energy needed to carry extra batteries in long-distance battery-electric vehicles. On the other hand, increasing hydrogen decreases cost by improving grid stability. One reason is that, when too much WWS electricity is available, the excess can always be used to produce hydrogen, which is either stored or used immediately. Whereas excess electricity can also be stored in stationary batteries to provide electricity for battery-electric vehicles, stationary batteries are more expensive than is hydrogen storage. A second reason is that, when too little electricity on the grid is available for battery-electric vehicles, either more generators or more electricity storage is needed; for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, only more lower-cost hydrogen storage is needed. In sum, using electrolytic hydrogen increases cost due to the lower efficiency of most hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (efficiency effect) but decreases cost by improving grid stability (grid stability effect). This analysis, though, ignores the potential for batteries in battery-electric vehicles to provide electricity back to the grid.
Results here indicate (Fig. 6) that, in most regions tested (e.g., Cuba, South Korea, Taiwan), increasing the use of electricity for hydrogen fuel-cell-electric vehicles instead of for battery-electric vehicles increases overall cost because the efficiency effect dominated the grid stability effect. However, in Southeast Asia, the grid stability effect dominated at all penetrations tested. In Israel, the grid stability effect dominated at low penetrations of hydrogen, and the efficiency effect dominated at high penetrations. In Israel, for example, increasing the hydrogen penetration from 5% to 24% decreased overall LCOE slightly (from 12.22 to 12.13 ¢ per kWh), due to decreases in electricity and heat generation costs of 0.32 ¢ per kWh, electricity storage costs of 0.17 ¢ per kWh, and all thermal-energy storage costs of 0.01 ¢ per kWh, mostly offset by increases in hydrogen production/compression/storage costs of 0.41 ¢ per kWh. However, increasing the penetration further from 24% to 50% increased overall LCOE from 12.13 to 12.19 ¢ per kWh due to an increase in hydrogen production/compression/storage costs of 0.49 ¢ per kWh mostly offset by decreases in electricity storage costs of 0.21 ¢ per kWh, decreases in electricity plus heat generation costs of 0.21 ¢ per kWh, and decreases in thermal-energy storage costs of 0.01 ¢ per kWh.
 Fig. 6  Sensitivity of the overall 2050 WWS levelized cost of energy (LCOE), in 2020 USD, to changing the fraction of oil-based transport fuel replaced with electrolytic hydrogen for fuel-cell-electric vehicles, instead of for battery-electric vehicles. The base-case fraction is 0.24. 
4.10. Sensitivity of overall LCOE to battery-electric vehicle charging profile
One more uncertainty is the time-dependent charging profile of electric vehicles. The base-case assumption is that the profile is constant seasonally (as justified in Note S5, ESI†) and during day and night, except to the extent that demand response shifts the time of some charging. Here, sensitivity tests are run to examine the impacts on cost of assuming (a) 60% charging spread between 11 PM and 7 AM (night charging), when electricity demand is otherwise usually lowest, and 40% evenly spread during all other hours of the day, and (b) 60% charging between 8 AM and 4 PM (day charging), when most solar electricity is usually available. In all three cases tested (Fig. 7), day charging is the least expensive and night charging is the most expensive. The base case is in-between. Day charging reduces overall LCOE by 0.46 ¢ per kWh in Southeast Asia and by 0.065 ¢ per kWh in the U.S., whereas night charging increases LCOE by 0.10 ¢ per kWh in Southeast Asia and by 0.04 ¢ per kWh in the U.S., relative to the base case. In Israel, day charging also reduces LCOE, but only by ∼0.01 ¢ per kWh. Night charging also increases LCOE, but only by ∼0.01 ¢ per kWh. Thus, shifting charging to daytime helps to reduce LCOE, but more so in some locations than in others. Similarly, shifting to night charging increases LCOE, but more so in some locations than in others. The low impact in Israel was likely due to the substantial storage already needed to otherwise keep the grid stable there.
 Fig. 7  Sensitivity of the overall 2050 WWS levelized cost of energy (LCOE), in 2020 USD, to predominantly (60%) daytime (8 AM–4 PM) charging (“Day”) versus equal charging every day-night hour (“Day–Night”) versus predominantly (60%) nighttime (11 PM–7 AM) charging (“Night”), as described in the text. “Day–Night” is the base case. 
4.11. Political uncertainty
A political, rather than modeling, uncertainty is whether the timeline proposed in the study (80% transition by 2030 and 100% ideally by 2035 but no later than 2050) can be met. Worldwide, about 8.2% of the WWS infrastructure needed to power all-purpose energy had been installed as of 2020. Many countries had virtually nothing installed. Norway and Tajikistan had over 60% installed. For countries where no transition has occurred so far, a 10% transition per year is needed for eight years (2022 to 2030). For countries with 60% installed, a 5% transition per year is needed for eight years. In all cases, the scale of transition required is enormous. Whether the pace needed can be obtained depends on whether policymakers can garner sufficient political will and on whether manufacturing and deployment can be ramped up fast enough. Political will, itself, affects the speed of the buildout of generation, storage, and transmission. Political will is adversely affected by lobbyists for conventional energy, other people with vested interest in the current energy infrastructure, the difficulty in changing some people's opinions about whether we should move off of fossil-fuels, and confusion sown by those against a renewable energy transition. In addition, for countries engaged in international or civil war, political will to transition is not a top priority, and building new infrastructure may not even be feasible during the conflict. This study does not guarantee sufficient political will is available. Instead, it examines the consequences of a transition if sufficient will is obtained. It also provides confidence to those who may be on the fence that a transition is possible and will have several benefits.
5. Conclusions
The world needs a rapid transition to clean, renewable energy to address air pollution, climate, and energy security issues. Here, roadmaps to transition 145 countries to 100% clean, renewable WWS energy and storage across all energy sectors are developed. The full transition should occur no later than 2050, but ideally by 2035, with no less than 80% by 2030. Grid stability analyses are performed after the countries are divided into 24 world regions. No-load-loss solutions are found in all regions for the three-year period, 2050–2052. Costs are estimated, and sensitivity tests are performed to examine the impacts of several factors on them.
Across 145 countries, a transition to 100% WWS reduces the annual base-case private energy cost by 62.7% (from $17.8 down to $6.6 trillion per year in 2020 USD) compared with BAU. This is due to 56.4% less end-use energy consumption and a 14.3% lower private cost per unit energy. WWS reduces the annual social energy cost (private cost plus health and climate costs) by 92% (from $83.2 to $6.6 trillion per year) because WWS eliminates health ($33.6 trillion per year) and climate ($31.8 trillion per year) costs along with reducing private energy costs. These results suggest a substantial private and social cost benefit of transitioning. The results are consistent with previous studies despite the new data and the differences in approach compared with those studies. Robustness across independent studies strengthens the case that a clean, renewable energy future is possible.
The net present value of the capital cost of transitioning to WWS worldwide is ∼$61.5 trillion over all years of the transition between today and 2050. This is the estimated net present value of a worldwide Green New Deal. The 145-country payback time due to annual private energy cost savings between BAU and WWS is 5.5 (0.9–21.9) years. The payback time due to annual social energy cost savings between BAU and WWS is 0.8 (0.1–6.7) years. Thus, the capital cost of WWS pays for itself with energy, health, and climate cost savings rapidly, and the payback is through energy sales rather through subsidies. However, the speed of a transition would benefit substantially from government assistance.
Transitioning to 100% WWS in 145 countries decreases energy requirements and annual private and social costs while creating about 28.4 million more long-term, full-time jobs than lost. A 100% WWS economy uses only about 0.53% of the 145-country land area, with 0.17% for footprint and 0.36% for spacing.
Sensitivity tests indicate that (1) increasing the fraction of district heating and cooling in the most expensive countries, which are all small countries, reduces costs significantly by replacing inflexible loads with flexible loads, thereby replacing electricity storage and overgeneration with low-cost heat storage; (2) if mean battery costs are 50% higher than in the base case ($90 instead of $60 kW−1 h−1-electricity storage), overall LCOEs and annual energy costs increase by only 3.2 (0.3–14.5)%; (3) all but four regions need four or fewer hours of load shifting rather than the eight hours assumed in the base case, suggesting that actual load shifting may be easier than in the base case; (4) increasing the use of electricity for hydrogen fuel-cell-electric instead of battery-electric vehicles increases overall LCOE in most regions, due to the greater efficiency of battery-electric vehicles, but it decreases overall LCOE in some regions by improving grid stability; and (5) shifting the time of battery-electric vehicle charging from evenly-distributed day-night charging to primarily day charging reduces overall LCOE in the regions tested; shifting to primarily night charging increases LCOE.
Many additional uncertainties exist. One of the greatest is whether sufficient political will can be obtained to affect a transition at the rapid pace needed. However if political will can be obtained, then transitioning the world entirely to clean, renewable energy should substantially reduce energy needs, costs, air pollution mortality, global warming, and energy insecurity while creating jobs, compared with BAU.

Broader context
The world is undergoing a transition to clean, renewable energy to reduce air pollution, global warming, and energy insecurity. To minimize damage, all energy should ideally be transitioned by 2035. Whether this occurs will depend substantially on social and political factors. One concern is that a transition to intermittent wind and solar will cause blackouts. To analyze this issue, we examine the ability of 145 countries grouped into 24 regions to avoid blackouts under realistic weather conditions that affect both energy demand and supply, when energy for all purposes originates from 100% clean, renewable (zero air pollution and zero carbon) Wind-Water-Solar (WWS) and storage. Three-year (2050–52) grid stability analyses for all regions indicate that transitioning to WWS can keep the grid stable at low-cost, everywhere. Batteries are the main electricity storage option in most regions. No batteries with more than four hours of storage are needed. Instead, long-duration storage is obtained by concatenating batteries with 4 hour storage. The new land footprint and spacing areas required for WWS systems are small relative to the land covered by the fossil fuel industry. The transition may create millions more long-term, full-time jobs than lost and will eliminate carbon and air pollution from energy.

 	Fig. 2  New land area (km2) required for footprint on the ground, which applies to utility PV + CSP + ST (solar thermal) and geothermal electricity and heat, and for spacing, which applies to onshore wind, among the 145 countries examined. Ocean spacing areas for new offshore wind, tidal, and wave power are also shown as is the area for new rooftop PV, which doesn't require new land. No new land for hydropower is needed. The values are determined by dividing the difference between the world total new plus existing nameplate capacities from Table S9 (ESI†) and the world total existing nameplate capacities from Table S8 (ESI†) by the installed power densities from Table S22 (ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 3  2050–2052 hourly time series showing the matching of all-energy demand with supply and storage for the China region (Table 1). First row: modeled time-dependent total WWS power generation versus load plus losses plus changes in storage plus shedding for the full three-year simulation period. Second row: solar PV + CSP electricity production, onshore plus offshore wind electricity production, building total cold load, and building total heat load (as used in LOADMATCH), summed over each region for 10 days; third row: correlation plots of building heat load versus wind power output and wind power output versus solar power output, obtained from all hourly data during the simulation. Table S26 (ESI†) summarizes the correlations. The model was run at 30 s resolution. Results are shown hourly, so units are energy output (TWh) per hour increment, thus also in units of power (TW) averaged over the hour. No load loss occurred during any 30 s interval. Fig. S2 (ESI†) provides these and additional plots for all regions.	 

 	Fig. 4  Sensitivity of the overall 2050 levelized cost of energy (LCOE) with WWS, in 2020 USD, to a 50% higher battery cost ($90 instead of $60 kW−1 h−1-electricity storage). Red is the baseline cost (Table 4). Green is the incremental cost due to higher-cost batteries.	 

 	Fig. 5  Sensitivity of the levelized cost and some of its components to the fraction of all buildings in two countries where hot and cold air and hot water are supplied by district heating and cooling. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows results for additional countries/regions. The components included are the cost of batteries, thermal storage, and/or total electricity generation. Thermal storage costs include the costs of UTES, HW-STES, CW-STES, ICE storage, and heat pumps to provide heat and cold for thermal energy storage (Table S19, ESI†). The only component of total electricity generation that is changing is the quantity of offshore wind. The low fraction district heating and cooling is the baseline value for each country and gives the baseline LCOE given in Table 4.	 

 	Fig. 6  Sensitivity of the overall 2050 WWS levelized cost of energy (LCOE), in 2020 USD, to changing the fraction of oil-based transport fuel replaced with electrolytic hydrogen for fuel-cell-electric vehicles, instead of for battery-electric vehicles. The base-case fraction is 0.24.	 

 	Fig. 7  Sensitivity of the overall 2050 WWS levelized cost of energy (LCOE), in 2020 USD, to predominantly (60%) daytime (8 AM–4 PM) charging (“Day”) versus equal charging every day-night hour (“Day–Night”) versus predominantly (60%) nighttime (11 PM–7 AM) charging (“Night”), as described in the text. “Day–Night” is the base case.
