    , Accepted 25th May 2019First published on 27th May 2019AbstractIn this research, we aim to design a simple and effective photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor using the heterostructure of a mixed metal oxide (CuCo2O4) coated on the surface of vertically aligned titanium dioxide nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs) as the optoelectronic material. The suggested sensor with a remarkable UV-light photoelectrocatalytic activity, was utilized for the determination of galantamine (Gal), one of the most common Alzheimer's drugs, without any auxiliary biomolecules or labeled materials. At first, TiO2 NTAs were synthesized by electrochemical anodizing in an organic medium containing ethylene glycol, ammonium fluoride and water, followed by calcination in the furnace. Afterward, a cobalt-copper alloy was electrodeposited on the TiO2 NTAs using an electrochemical coating method for 30 s. The combination of CuCo2O4 with TiO2 NTAs exhibited a superior photocurrent (roughly 1.41 times higher) than that of the bare TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode that was attributed to the efficient separation of electron hole pairs and rapid electron transfer. The addition of Gal led to an enhancing of the photoelectrochemical response of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTA electrode due to the presence of Gal as a sacrificial electron donor to scavenge the hole and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Under the optimum conditions, the designed PEC sensor exhibited a good linear range of Gal concentrations from 10.0 nmol L−1 to 10.0 μmol L−1 with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 7.65 nmol L−1. The relative standard deviation was 0.71% (n = 10). Moreover, the as-fabricated PEC sensor exhibited an outstanding analytical performance with a high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, good stability and reproducibility, which opens up a new promising signal on the PEC sensor with enhanced sensing performances for the evaluation of Gal in pharmaceutical products with satisfactory results.
Introduction
Since the discovery of the photoelectric effect in the early 20th century, a widespread effort has been paid to developing this phenomenon plus electronic and quantum chemistry, as well as in the fields of electrochemistry. However, more and more attention has been given to the progress of promising photoelectric conversion devices. Within the last few years, the large number of photoelectrochemical cells based on various nanomaterials and analytical strategies, have been vibrantly developed for sensing applications.1
The newly emerged photoelectrochemical detection is generally classified as a current-mode of photoelectrochemistry that can be used in bioanalytical chemistry, designing solar cells and optoelectronic devices, environmental remediation and sensors.2 Regarding good selectivity, high sensitivity, low-cost, simple equipment, rapid detection, easy miniaturization and low background current, PEC technology has been intensely proven to be a promising and highly efficient process.3,4 During the PEC process for the molecule, ion or semiconductor materials, the light radiation is utilized as the excitation source and the generated photocurrent is obtained as the detection signal,5,6 which can be viewed as the reverse of electroluminescence.7,8 Its principle may be expressed in a simple way in that the PEC active species are irradiated by light and its outer layer electrons transition to the excited states from the ground state to bring electron–hole pairs. The externally applied anodic bias can withdraw the excited electrons to a counter electrode, which results in a decrease in the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes.9 Besides, the analyte, as an electron donor, can conquer the photo-induced holes and be oxidized at a relatively lower potential than that of direct electrochemical oxidation, while the excited electrons transfer to the electrode leading to the current signal. Additionally, this method has notable advantages from the electrochemical technique; the use of an electronic readout makes the instrument simple, accurate and inexpensive, easy to miniaturize, etc.,10 accompanied by a reduction of some undesired background signals due to the efficient separation of excitation sources and detection signals, thus leading to a high sensitivity.11
The photoelectric active species with a highly sensitive response and a biological recognition system with an excellent selectivity are the two vital aspects in the promotion of the desired PEC detector.12 Since the competence of the PEC sensors depends on the properties of the photoactive materials as a critical factor, a series of various active species, such as graphene nanocomposites, organic small molecules, metal complexes13 and semiconductor materials such as TiO2, Cd series quantum dots, metal oxides, g-C3N4 and so on, have been reported in PEC studies to meet the particular demand.14 Among the available photosensitive semiconductor materials, titanium dioxide (TiO2), considered as one of the most promising photocatalysts, is widely used in PEC fields, including photocatalysis, solar cells and sensors, owing to its special features, such as low cost, non-toxicity, chemical inertness, photostability15,16 and high efficiency in degrading difficult-to-remove organic pollutants.17 The synthesis of 1D TiO2 nanostructures may be accrued in different ways that may contain sol–gel methods, template-assisted methods, hydro/solvothermal approaches and electrochemical means.18 Strikingly, the tubular structure makes both the inside and outside areas of the tubes more attainable to the redox species in the electrolyte.
Recently, TiO2 nanotube-array films growing on a Ti substrate via an anodic oxidation process appeared as a progress compared to an immobilized TiO2 film. Furthermore, highly ordered nanotubular TiO2 films fabricated by an anodization method have attracted much attention for their good mechanical adhesion strength, high chemical stability,19 enhanced charge carrier transfer, greater surface area and large number of active sites20 for photoelectrochemical action. Likewise, the thickness and morphology of such TiO2 nanotubes could be easily controlled by tailoring the anodization conditions, such as applied potential, anodization duration and electrolyte composition.21
TiO2 is found mainly in three crystalline phases: anatase, rutile, and brookite. Among the different polymorphs, rutile is the thermodynamically stable phase, while anatase is considered as a stable phase at the nanoscale.18 Also, it has been found that the anatase phase of TiO2 displays a higher photocatalytic activity than the other phases.13 TiO2 NTs were utilized in a variety of applications, as photocatalysts for the purification of air and water, self-cleaning, and degradation organic pollutants22 and in non-photocatalytic applications, such as gas sensors, biomedical materials, etc.23,24 Nevertheless, the TiO2 photocatalyst has two main drawbacks which have restricted its efficiency: one is its wide band gap (3.2 eV), as well as the low quantum yield caused by the rapid recombination of photo-induced electron–hole pairs, and the other is the difficulties of the catalyst's recycling.25,26 Various approaches have been conducted toward the amendment the photoelectrochemical activities of TiO2 nanotubes, such as metal/nonmetal doping, dye sensitization and forming a heterostructure by coupling TiO2 NTs with a narrow band gap semiconductor. The coupling of two semiconductors, possessing different energy levels for their corresponding conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), can be used to promote the potential for a wide range of prospective applications.27 Recently, widespread studies have been conducted on the design and synthesis of nanocomposite mixed metal oxides for photocatalytic applications. Among the various materials under investigation, the CuCo2O4 nanocomposite opens up new possibilities for the development of charge separation and electron and hole transfer between the corresponding conduction and valence bands.28 This has meant that the integration of these metals and their oxides in nano-dimensions onto a suitably surface modified substrate, such as titanium, expresses a much higher photoelectrochemical performance than pure TiO2.29
Galantamine hydrobromide, a tertiary alkaloid, belongs to the family of cholinergic medications which act both as a reversible competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and as an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This dual mechanism can dispense additional benefits for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and various memory impairments. Gal was extracted from the bulbs of certain Narcissus species initially, but now it can be produced synthetically.30,31
Till now, a number of analytical methodologies have been developed to analyze the Gal level in biological fluids as well as in plants, including high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection or with fluorescence detection, micellar electrokinetic chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, a liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric method and spectrofluorimetry.32,33 Although these methods can be used for the sensitive determination of Gal, they showed several drawbacks, for instance, the need for tedious and complicated pretreatments, costly procedures and a long detection time. To defeat these limitations, electrochemical techniques seem to be a promising successor due to their certain decent benefits like rapid response, low-cost instrumentation, easy microminiaturization and easy compatibility for in situ analysis.34 There is still an urgent need to construct a novel sensor for the Gal assay with a high sensitivity, good selectivity and excellent reproducibility.
In the present work, we describe the synthesis, characterization and photoelectrochemical capability of a CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti hetero-nanostructure. For that purpose, the incorporation of metal oxides on the nanotubular TiO2 matrix as a high surface area support was carried out by electro-depositing a Co–Cu alloy electrocatalyst after an anodization process to fabricate the PEC sensor. The morphology and structure were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, the photoelectrochemical oxidation behavior of Gal and the stability, repeatability and reproducibility of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was investigated under UV light illumination. It is expected that this new type of PEC sensor will provide a synergistic effect with remarkably enhanced photoelectrocatalytic performances in the determination of Gal in comparison with TiO2 NTAs/Ti. To the best of our knowledge, hitherto, no study has reported the determination of Gal using CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti photoelectrochemical sensors.
Experimental
Reagents and solutions
All the commercially available chemicals were of analytical grade from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and were used without further purification. Titanium foil (thickness 0.5 mm, 99.7% purity) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was used as the substrate material. CoCl2·6H2O, CuSO4·5H2O, boric acid, KCl, NaOH, NH4F, ethylene glycol, acetone, ethanol and other reagents were purchased from Merck Company (Darmstadt, Germany). Galantamine was procured from the Aburaihan Pharmaceutical Company (Tehran, Iran). Citric acid (CA) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Aqueous solutions of analyte were prepared with a citrate buffer solution (CBS, 0.1 mol L−1) in the pH range 3.0–6.0 by mixing solutions of 0.1 mol L−1 citric acid and 0.1 mol L−1 sodium citrate. All the solutions were prepared and diluted using high quality deionized water (DI).
Apparatus
The photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted on a PalmSens electrochemical analyzer equipped with PSTrace 2.4 software (Houten, Netherlands). All the electrochemical studies were performed at 25 ± 1 °C. The photoelectrochemical experiments were performed in an electrochemical cell using a regular three-electrode system with a platinum wire counter electrode, a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti working electrode. The working electrode was illuminated with a 6 W Philips lamp (UVA BL) as the irradiation source. The reactor and the UV lamp were placed in a black box (43 L × 39 W × 53 H, cm) to avoid environmental illumination. The anodization was performed in a two-electrode electrochemical cell with a direct current power supply (Dazheng PS-305D, China). The pH of the solutions was adjusted by a model 827 pH meter (Metrohm, Swiss).
Morphological
A field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Mira-3 XMU from TESCAN Company) was employed to investigate the morphologies of TiO2 NTAs/Ti and CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti. The crystallinity of the electrode surface was established using a Rigaku powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, (λ = 0.15418 nm) and the chemical composition was obtained using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (Mira-3 XMU from TESCAN Company).
Synthesis of TiO2 NTAs
The highly ordered TiO2 NTAs were synthesized by an anodization process via a two-step process as described elsewhere.35 Before anodization, Ti foil sheets (2.0 cm × 3.0 cm) were first degreased ultrasonically in acetone, ethanol, and distilled water for 10 min. In the first step, the anodization process was accomplished in a self-designed two-electrode electrochemical cell with a Ti foil as the working electrode and a Pt slice as the counter electrode in a solution of ethylene glycol containing 0.1 mol L−1 ammonium fluoride and 2 wt% distilled water as the electrolyte. The anodic oxidation was conducted with a constant voltage of 25 V provided by a direct current power set for 2 h at room temperature. Eventually, the freshly fabricated TiO2 NTA electrode was then rinsed with distilled water and dried in air. In the second step, the amorphous TiO2 NTAs were calcinated in a furnace at 450 °C for 150 min to convert the amorphous phase into the crystalline one with a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1 to form the anatase phase.
Synthesis of CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti
Cu–Co nanoparticles were deposited onto the crystallized TiO2 NTAs/Ti by the electrochemical deposition method. In a typical synthesis process, the as-anodized TiO2 NTAs/Ti were firstly immersed in a solution containing 250 mmol L−1 of cobalt chloride, 380 mmol L−1 boric acid, 380 mmol L−1 KCl and 15 mmol L−1 copper sulphate to get Co–Cu NP/TiO2 NTAs/Ti. The pH of the electrolyte was adjusted to 4 using dilute H2SO4. The electrochemical deposition process was conditioned for 30 s under an applied potential of −1 V. After electrodeposition the electrodes were oxidized in 0.15 mol L−1 of NaOH solution by cycling the potential between −1.0 V and +1.0 V for 20 cycles at a 0.05 V s−1 scan rate to obtain the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti PEC sensor. Finally, the electrodes were rinsed with distilled water.29 The images of different electrodes synthesized in each step are shown in Fig. 1A.

Preparation of the real sample
To assess the reliability and applicability of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti sensor, the Gal concentration was determined in a tablet sample. For the determination of Gal in a tablet, five tablets of the Gal were randomly selected and powdered. A mass powder equivalent to 0.196 g was dissolved in DI water and stirred for 24 h. Finally, the solution was centrifuged and added to a 25 mL volumetric flask containing pH 4.2 CBS as the supporting electrolyte.34
Reference method
The reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method for the determination of Gal was used as the reference method. The analysis was carried out on Shimadzu HPLC system with a Phenomenex C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size) using a 1 mmol L−1 ammonium formate:acetonitrile (30:70) isocratic mode as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.4 mL min−1. The detection was carried out using a UV detector set at 289 nm.
Results and discussion
Morphology characterization of CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti
The FE-SEM images of TiO2 NTAs and CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs are illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1B shows FE-SEM images of TiO2 NTAs prepared by anodization with an inner diameter in the range of 40–60 nm and average wall thickness of 20 nm. It can be seen from this figure that the fabricated nanotube arrays are highly ordered with a circular shape. The NTs are highly compact and distributed regularly all over the surface of the Ti foil. FE-SEM images of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs (Fig. 1C) show the that electrodeposition of CuCo2O4 nanoparticles on TiO2 NTAs was performed successfully and metal oxide nanoparticles are clod like and highly non-uniform. This can be attributed to the non-uniformity of the TiO2 NTA surface at the nano regime.
In order to further confirm the formation of the resulting TiO2 NTAs and CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs on the Ti foil, the compositional studies were performed via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 1. The EDX analysis of the TiO2 NTAs/Ti and CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrodes were performed and the results are displayed in Fig. 1. The EDS pattern shown in Fig. 1D clearly confirms the existence of Ti and O elements on the TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode. Fig. 1E shows an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy pattern of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode that emphasizes the presence of the Co, Cu, O and Ti elements. Thus, the successful formation of CuCo2O4 on the TiO2 nanotube arrays was also confirmed through the EDX spectrum.
The crystalline structure of the synthesized CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was characterized by XRD. The XRD spectra of CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs are shown in Fig. 1F. The presence of the peaks at 2θ values of 25.33, 47.97, 54.00, 55.16 and 62.71 correspond to the (101), (200), (105), (211) and (204) planes, respectively. This confirms the presence of the anatase phase of TiO2 with a tetragonal phase. The presence of the peaks corresponding to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes at 2θ values of 18.88, 31.08, 36.62, 38.31, 44.52, 55.29, 58.96 and 64.79 respectively, confirms the formation of a spinel structure of CuCo2O4.36,37
PEC characterization of CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode
To deeply investigate the photoelectrochemical efficiency of the Ti electrode, TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode and CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode, transient photocurrent response measurements (current vs. time, I–t) were carried out during repeated on–off UV-light irradiation cycles using a typical three-electrode configuration coupling with a homemade optical system at room temperature. With the light turned on, immediate photocurrent responses were observed for both the TiO2 NTAs/Ti and CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrodes and the photocurrent value retracted to nearly zero once the illumination was switched off. Fig. 2 shows the photocurrent response generated by the Ti, TiO2 NTAs/Ti and CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrodes measured under UV illumination in 0.1 mol L−1 citrate buffer electrolyte solution at a constant potential bias of 2.0 V.
 Fig. 2  Photocurrent response of Ti foil (blue line), TiO2 NTAs/Ti (red line) and CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti (sea green line) electrodes in CBS (pH = 4.2). 
It can be found that the Ti foil had no photoelectrochemical activity during the on–off UV-light irradiation and the photocurrent of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was observably enhanced compared with that of the pure TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode under, repeated UV illumination. The maximum photocurrent produced by the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode (149.55 μA) was roughly 1.41 times higher than that of the bare TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode (106.02 μA). This demonstrated the presence of a larger number of free photogenerated carriers in the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode (Fig. 2) than that in the TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode under UV illumination. The obtained results can imply that the promoted photocurrent observed for this system was mainly due to the existence of the photocatalyst (CuCo2O4 nanohybrid) providing a large active surface area and the very fast charge transfer within the composite electrode and between the electrode surface and analyte. Moreover, the composite electrode exhibits excellent reproducibility of the I–t curves. This trend is repeated with every on–off cycle. Under UV light irradiation, the CuCo2O4 nanoparticles are excited by the electron transfer to the conduction band and the holes remained in the valence band. Then, the electrons were injected into the TiO2 NTA conduction band, leading to a quick electron–hole separation in CuCo2O4 and the subsequent transfer of electrons into the TiO2 NTAs.38,39 Based on the above outcomes, we can intuitively find that the modification of the TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode using the CuCo2O4 nanohybrid results in an enhancement of the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation and further enhances the life time of electron–hole pairs so as to intensify the photocurrent and photoconversion efficiency in the UV region.
Electrochemical behavior of Gal
The oxidation behavior of Gal at the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was characterized by a hydrodynamic amperometry method in citrate buffer solution (pH = 4.2) that containing 10.0 μmol L−1 Gal. Fig. 3 compares the photoelectrochemical response of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 CBS (pH = 4.2) in the presence and absence of Gal. It was found that in the presence of 10.0 μmol L−1 Gal (Fig. 3, curve b), the photocurrent intensity of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was substantially higher than that in the CBS without Gal (Fig. 3, curve a). Thus, the PEC signal enhancement in the presence of Gal is assigned to the direct oxidation of the analyte by the generated holes in the valence band of CuCo2O4. Meanwhile, when Gal was added, it provided a more facile pathway for the transfer of holes across the electrode/electrolyte boundary and the holes oxidized the Gal molecules, which led to a suppression of the electron–hole recombination and thus a substantial increase in the photocurrent intensity can be noticed. In addition, the scavenging of the holes can prevent the photo corrosion of the semiconductor modified photoelectrodes. The enhancement of photocurrent signal can be used to detect Gal, quantitatively.

Effective parameters on the PEC oxidation of Gal
The amount of generated photocurrent and oxidation of Gal at the surface of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was affected by the electrodeposition time, applied potential, type of supporting electrolyte and pH. Therefore, the effects of these experimental factors were studied in order to achieve the uppermost PEC efficiency and a much greater effective surface area of the electrode plus an increasing sensitivity.
Effect of deposition time
To better perform the photocurrent, the influence of the electrodeposition time of CuCo2O4 on the TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was investigated in 0.1 mol L−1 CBS (pH = 4.2). As shown in Fig. 4A, the photocurrent response of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was increased significantly with a growing deposition time of CuCo2O4 from 0 to 30 s. Nevertheless, when the deposition time of CuCo2O4 exceeded 30 s, the photocurrent response declined. The reason for this phenomenon may be ascribed to the fact that with an increasing electrodeposition time of CuCo2O4, the film formed by the excessive CuCo2O4 covered on the TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was much too heavy for the charge transmission between the electrolyte and the PEC platform. In other words, the thicker metal oxide film acts as a strong hindrance which makes the diffusion and charge transfer of electron donors difficult, and thus results in a decrease in the photoelectric response. Therefore, 30 s was chosen as the optimal electrodeposition time for subsequent experiments.

(B) The effect of different applied bias potentials from 0.1 to 2.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) on the PEC oxidation of Gal on the surface of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 CBS (pH = 4.2) containing 10.0 μmol L−1 Gal. (C) Photocurrent response of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode in various buffer solutions (0.1 mol L−1 of ABS, PBS, PBS-CBS and CBS) in the presence of 10.0 μmol L−1 Gal (pH = 3.6). (D) Photocurrent response of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 CBS containing 0.01 mmol L−1 Gal at different pHs over the range of 3.0–6.0. 
Effect of applied potential
The applied potential is one of the influential parameters that affects the PEC analysis crucially. Thus, finding a suitable applied potential is very substantial for a sensitive and selective PEC detection. To deeply investigate the effect of applied potential on the photoelectrochemical performance, transient photocurrent response measurements were carried out for the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode during repeated on–off UV-light irradiation cycles. Fig. 4B shows the I–t curves obtained on the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode at different applied potentials over the range of 0.1 V to 2.0 V vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. As shown in this figure, the photocurrent grew with the increasing potential applied to the electrode and the maximum photocurrent was observed at a potential of 2.0 V. These results allow us to find that the bias potential has an important role in the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and the photoelectrocatalytic process. After the overall consideration, in the subsequent experiments, the applied potential was chosen as 2.0 V for the amperometric determination of Gal.
Effect of supporting electrolyte and solution pH on photoelectrode response
In order to perform the PEC experiments, choosing a proper supporting electrolyte and the pH of the buffer solution are essential steps that play a key role in the photoelectrochemical oxidation behaviors of Gal. In order to investigate the effect of the supporting electrolyte on the hydrodynamic amperometric behavior of Gal at the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode, various kinds of supporting electrolyte solutions (0.1 mol L−1), including phosphate buffer solution (PBS), acetate buffer solution (ABS), citrate-phosphate buffer solution (CBS-PBS) and citrate buffer solution, were used (Fig. 4C). The foremost and the most stable photocurrent response of Gal oxidation was observed in the citrate buffer solution. Hereby, the citrate buffer solution was selected as the supporting electrolyte for the rest of studies. Likewise, in order to obtain an excellent PEC signal response, the pH of CBS was also investigated over the pH range of 3.0 to 6.0 using an amperometry method. Fig. 4D displays the dependence of the photocurrents of the PEC sensor on the solution pH, which illustrates that by growing the pH from 3.0 to 4.2, the photoelectric signal of Gal increased and reached its maximum value at pH = 4.2. Then, further raising the pH from 4.2 to 6.0 led to a dropping of the signal. Therefore, pH = 4.2, was chosen as the optimal pH value for the determination of Gal. As a result, in this work, all of the measurements were accomplished in CBS pH = 4.2.
Photoelectrochemical study for Gal
On the basis of the optimized parameters, the constructed CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was applied to the quantitative detection of Gal. Fig. 5A shows a series of photocurrent–time curves of the proposed PEC sensor in 0.1 mol L−1 CBS (pH = 4.2) containing different concentrations of Gal ranging from 10.0 nmol L−1 to 10.0 μmol L−1. Based on the results in Fig. 5A, a calibration plot was constructed by plotting the photocurrent variation, ΔI = (I − I0), against the Gal concentrations (Fig. 5B). Thus, the photocurrent difference increased gradually with the enhancement of Gal concentration ranging from 10.0 nmol L−1 to 10.0 μmol L−1 (I and I0 represent the photocurrent intensities of the PEC sensor in the presence and absence of Gal, respectively). The regression equation is described by ΔI (I − I0) = 2.8928CGal + 20.46 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9973 for Gal at the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode. The detection limit (LOD) was calculated to be 7.65 nmol L−1 based on 3σb/m, in which σb is the standard deviation of a blank signal (n = 10), and m is the slope of the linear calibration plot.

Reproducibility, repeatability and stability study
In order to explore the accuracy of the proposed method, variant parameters such as reproducibility, repeatability and stability were examined by measuring the photocurrent response of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode. The reproducibility of the modified electrode was evaluated by an interassay relative standard deviation (RSD) through the parallel measurement of 10.0 μmol L−1 Gal with three independent CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrodes, which were modified in the same experimental conditions and the RSD was calculated at 2.61%. The results confirmed that the reproducibility of the designed PEC sensor was satisfactory and acceptable. Then the repeatability of the photocurrent response of the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was evaluated by the detection of 10.0 μmol L−1 Gal in CBS (pH = 4.2) for ten consecutive measurements. As can be seen in Fig. 6A, there were negligible differences between photocurrents and the peak currents were nearly constant with only a small relative standard deviation of 0.71%, which confirms that the proposed PEC sensor could exhibit repeatable results.

(C) Hydrodynamic amperograms obtained for the tablet sample in CBS (pH = 4.2) before and after spiking with different concentrations of Gal. 
One of the other criteria of a photoelectrochemical sensor is its stability. The stability of the photocurrent response was investigated based on 18 measurements while periodically turning the light on/off for 800 s, shown in Fig. 6B. It is clearly observed, over time, that no obvious variation exists in the photoexcitation process, demonstrating the proposed PEC sensor possessed very stable properties. In addition, the long-term stability of the proposed sensor was also investigated by the amperometric method after storing the PEC sensor in the dark at room temperature over three months, under the same conditions. No noticeable change was observed in the photoelectric responses, such that 98.5% of the initial photocurrent for Gal oxidation was maintained after three months. The obtained results suggest that the stability of the fabricated photoelectrode is good enough for long-term storage.
Analytical application
In order to confirm the suitability and accuracy of the present PEC sensor in a real-world analysis of Gal, it was used to analyze commercially available tablet samples of Gal. The measurements were performed by the standard addition method via an amperometric technique. In this regard, the samples were prepared using the sample preparation method mentioned in the section “Preparation of the real sample”. The amperometric diagram in Fig. 6C shows the photocurrent of Gal oxidation in the tablet sample using the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode. The results for the determination of the Gal tablet sample obtained by this sensor were compared with the reference values obtained by an RP-HPLC method using the student's t-test and variance ratio F-test (Table 1). It can be seen that no significant difference exists between the performances of the two methods at the 95% confidence level and the results from this sensor and RP-HPLC are in good agreement, indicative of a good accuracy. Thus, these results confirm that the proposed sensor could be efficiently used for a practical sample analysis and precise determination of Gal in actual samples.

The effect of disturbing species
To reveal the specificity and selectivity of the as-prepared PEC sensor towards Gal, the present system was investigated by challenging it with representative intrusive species including memantine, alanine, glycine, uric acid, ascorbic acid, cysteine, leucine, methionine, arginine and tryptophan. The concentration of the interfering substances was 500-fold that of Gal, and then the PEC signal of the mixture of interfering substances and Gal was tested. In the presence of foreign species, a photocurrent difference of less than ±5%, indicates that there is less interference. As can be seen from Table 2, it can be concluded that no obvious photocurrent change was caused by interfering substances in the presence of 1.0 μmol L−1 Gal, and all of the deviations were less than 5%. From Table 2, the percentage of the photocurrent change in the presence of memantine is slightly higher than that of other compounds. Therefore, it was considered as a disturbing species. All the evidence manifested that the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode offers a high specificity and is particularly suitable for the determination of Gal. Therefore, the proposed PEC sensor has a great significant potential to detect Gal in real samples.

Mechanism of PEC analysis of Gal
Under UV illumination, the electrons (e−) were excited from the valence band of CuCo2O4 to the conduction band (CB) of CuCo2O4 and the holes remained in the valence band. Then the photogenerated electrons were transferred to the TiO2 conduction band because the CB level of TiO2 is lower than that of CuCo2O4, while the holes transfer in the opposite direction from TiO2 to CuCo2O4. This phenomenon leads to a quick electron–hole separation in CuCo2O4 and the subsequent transfer of electrons into TiO2 so the probability of the electron–hole recombination will be hindered. The photogenerated electrons can directly react with the dissolved oxygen molecules or can transfer along the electrode surface to react with the dissolved oxygen molecules to yield weaker oxidants such as superoxide radical anions (O2˙−). Then the O2˙− combines with hydrogen to produce hydroperoxy (HO2˙) radicals and these radicals react with H2O to produce an active oxidant hydroxide radical (˙OH) that can react with the organic compounds and oxidize them. Besides, the photogenerated holes in CuCo2O4 can react with H2O and OH to further produce ˙OH and OH− species.40–42 When Gal exists in the solution, the photoexcited holes in the valence band of CuCo2O4 are eliminated by oxidation of Gal because Gal acts as a sacrificial electron donor to deplete the photogenerated holes and these occupied holes are then ready for the next excitation. As a result, the recombination of electron–hole pairs reduces and the photocurrent is enhanced by electron–hole charge separation, which is caused by the synergism and coupling effect between the two semiconductors. The corresponding reaction processes are summarized in Scheme 1.

Conclusions
To sum up, a novel and simple photoelectrochemical sensor based on the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode was successfully developed for the determination of Gal. The results reveal that the CuCo2O4/TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode showed the highest photocurrent density and best PEC response compared with the strip TiO2 NTAs/Ti electrode under UV light irradiation. The increased photocurrent of the sensor is attributed to the synergistic effect of Co and Cu nanoparticles due to the special properties of each of them that lead to the quick separation of the photogenerated electron–hole and reduce recombination. Meanwhile, a key point of this paper, which makes this sensor outstanding from others, is its significant benefits, such as long-term stability, high selectivity, fast response, excellent repeatability and good reproducibility as well as low LOD (7.65 nmol L−1) and broad linear range (10.0 nmol L−1 to 10.0 μmol L−1) for the electrochemical measurement of Gal. In addition, the practicability of the proposed PEC sensor for evaluating the level of Gal in actual samples was also evaluated and was proved to be effective and promising with few interference effects. Therefore, this sensitive PEC sensor can be successfully used for the determination of Gal in other real samples in the future.
