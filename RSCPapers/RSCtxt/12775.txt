    , Accepted 17th July 2022First published on 21st July 2022AbstractStar-shaped 3,6-bis(5-(4,4′-bis(3-azidopropyl)-[1,1′:3′,1′-terphenyl]-5′-yl)-thien-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (DPPTPTA) is combined with electrospun bimetallic copper–cobalt phosphide decorated on carbon nanofibers (CuCoP/CNF) and used as a modified layer (DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF) on the platinum (Pt) coated counter electrode (CE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). DPPTPTA possesses ladder-like energy levels for efficient charge separation while CuCoP/CNF exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and sufficient electrical conductivity. Overall, the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF heterostructure exhibits attractive performance needed for CE of DSSCs. From electrochemical analysis, it is observed that the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer ensures efficient charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface with low charge transfer resistance. Moreover, the CE/electrolyte interface possesses a small electron recombination rate, since the modified layer has good charge separation ability. Under 1 sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) conditions, the proposed DSSC achieved a photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) of 9.50%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 827 mV, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.25 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71. Under indoor conditions, the η value at 6000 lux (1.89 mW cm−2) reached 25.44%. Finally, the porous three-dimensional nanofiber structure of modified layer can ensure the long-term stability (90% retention after 3000 h). Thus, the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer-based DSSC can be considered as a promising device for possible renewable energy applications.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are third-generation photovoltaic devices, which are highly praised for their cost-effectiveness and ease of manufacturing.1,2 In general, DSSCs are made up of a photoanode, a dye, an electrolyte, and a counter electrode, which contribute to the overall performance of DSSCs. Over the past few decades, researchers have synthesized many new materials/chemicals to improve the performance of DSSCs and ensure their long-term operation. The DSSCs based on liquid electrolytes are still the most researched device due to the higher efficiency that exceeds 14%.3,4 The combination of a titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor with a ruthenium-based sensitizer (N719) has been regarded as an effective photoanode for a DSSC.1,2 At present, the platinum counter electrode (PtCE) is generally regarded as an ideal material for a CE due to its high electrocatalytic ability and conductivity.5 However, the corrosion resistance of Pt against the iodide/triiodide electrolyte (I−/I3−) is not sufficient and some difficulties in material stability occur due to the irreversible adsorption of iodide/triiodide on Pt.6,7 Therefore, the finding of new materials to modify or replace the Pt electrode is essential to improve the performance of CE with high conversion efficiency (η). For an efficient DSSC, the CE must meet the following requirements such as optimal thickness of catalytic material deposited on the substrate, high electrocatalytic ability, good electrical conductivity, sufficient specific surface area, porous structure, and good corrosion resistance to the electrolyte.5,8–11
For decades, carbon-based nanomaterials have been widely used for surface modification or substitution of PtCE in counter electrode,12–14 as well as the surface modification of TiO2 photoanodes.15–18 Carbon-based modified electrodes have multiple interfacial electron transfer pathways for enhanced charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface and fast triiodide reduction kinetics.12–14 Many reports in the literature point out that the use of carbon-based materials for surface modification of PtCE, or their chemically modified transition metal compounds can be used as effective substitutes for PtCE. Carbon and its composites can meet the requirements such as high abundance, low cost and long-term stability as well as excellent catalytic functionality and high electrical conductivity for a wide range of applications.12–14 For example, some reports present in the literature on carbon-based materials as modified PtCE surfaces including graphene (GN),19–24 reduced graphene oxide (rGO),25 graphene oxide (GO),26 carbon black (CB),27 and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT).28 However, only a very few studies based on functional composite materials, such as magnetic beads (MBs)29 and polyoxometalate-based (POM-based),30 have been proposed for the modification of PtCE. Over the past few decades, researchers have been motivated to synthesize various types of carbon-based nanocomposites with enhanced physical and electrochemical properties. Recently, cobalt-based bimetallic phosphides (MCoP, where M = Ni, Cu, Fe, and Mn) have been researched for various electrochemical applications.31–35 Since the first-row transition metals consist of identical atomic radii and different valence electrons with dissimilar spin configurations, the doping of one transition metal into transition metal phosphides (TMPs) would cause a fluctuation in the spin state, energy level, and its intrinsic electronic behavior. Moreover, each transition metal in bimetallic compounds mutually shares their individual electronic properties and electrocatalytic activities. Therefore, bimetallic phosphide can offer higher electronic conductivity and electrochemical properties as compared to monometallic phosphide. For example, Ma et al. reported NiCoP with lower charge transfer resistance and higher electrocatalytic activity as compared to CoP and NiP.36 They concluded that NiCoP exhibited 0.628 and 0.871-fold lower charge transfer resistance than CoP and NiP, respectively. Among the aforementioned cobalt-based bimetallic phosphides (MCoP), a few research reports are available on NiCoP-based counter electrodes for DSSCs.31,32 However, there are no research studies related to other cobalt-based bimetallic phosphides for DSSCs. Thus, there is a need to do research on cobalt-based bimetallic phosphides towards DSSC application. As per previous studies on water splitting, Co and Cu have a positively charged center and P consists of a negatively charged center.37 Both Cu and Co centers behave as hybrid-acceptors, whereas P centers act as a proton acceptor, and facilitate the charge transfer and provide good electrocatalytic activity among Cu, Co, and P.37 According to the density of state theory, CuCoP has a larger P 3p orbital of the P-site at the Fermi energy level, which is comparatively larger than that of pristine cobalt phosphide. This implies that CuCoP can show a higher electron mobility than pristine cobalt phosphide.38 Moreover, the Cu doping into CoP induces the lattice expansion with defects and the new electronic states within the bandgap, which modulate the surface electronic structure, thus increasing the charge transfer kinetics, electrical conduction, and electrocatalytic active sites.39
In this research, we proposed a small molecule 3,6-bis(5-(4,4′-bis(3-azidopropyl)-[1,1′:3′,1′-terphenyl] -5′-yl)-thien-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (DPPTPTA) for combining with a three dimensional bimetallic CuCoP decorated electrospun carbon nanofiber (CNF) to form a multifunctional composite film as the modified layer (DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF) on the PtCE of a DSSC. In this heterogeneous structure, DPPTPTA is a star-shaped conjugated small molecule, which was derived from the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) core. DPPTPTA has highly reactive end-capping azido groups and is prone to cross-linking reactions.40–42 In addition, DPPTPTA is based on a terphenyl conjugated π-bridge, which has high charge mobility to affect the charge separation and inhibit the molecular aggregation. Meanwhile, the CNF is considered as the superior supportive carbon nanomaterial for various electrochemical applications owing to its high surface area to volume ratio, electronic conductivity, long-term stability, and electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, both TMPs and CNF were put together through electrospinning technology to prepare a composite material with high conductivity and high catalytic activity. The electrospinning technology is an effective method for structural engineering to increase the surface area and conductivity, thereby reducing the electron transmission path. Finally, the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF heterostructure was used as the modified layer of the PtCE in a DSSC for the first time. The proposed DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modifier layer has some advantages such as it (1) protects the PtCE from corrosion in the iodide/triiodide electrolyte (I−/I3−), (2) improves the conductivity, shortens the electron transmission path, and suppresses the charge recombination, (3) provides more specific surface area and electrocatalytic active sites, and (4) offers a porous three-dimensional nanofiber structure which holds the electrolyte in the heterostructure to prevent volatilization, thus improving long-term stability. Table 1 compares the performance of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF carbonaceous and nanocomposite materials as modifiers. The proposed working mechanism of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer in DSSC is shown in Scheme 1.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of DPPTPTA conjugated small molecules
The synthesis process of DPPTPTA conjugated small molecules consists of six steps, and the details of each step are shown as the following, (1) 3-(4-bromophenyl)propionic acid (8.00 g) was mixed with anhydrous diethyl ether (100 mL at 0 °C under a N2 atmosphere and stirred for 20 min). Subsequently, lithium aluminum hydride (2.00 g) was slowly added to the above solution for further reaction (R.T., stirred for 12 h, under a N2 atmosphere). Then, a mixed solution of deionized water and hydrochloric acid (160 mL) was added for quenching, and the obtained Compound 1 was purified (yield: 7.29 g, 97%). (2) Compound 1 (2.06 g), bis(pinacolato)diboron (3.80 g) and sodium acetate (3.30 g) in anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (60 mL) were reacted (50 °C, stirred for 20 min, under a N2 atmosphere). Then PdCl2(PPh3)2 (0.18 g) was added to the above solution and subjected to a reflux process (50 °C, stirring for 16 h, under a N2 atmosphere). As a result, Compound 2 (yield: 1.08 g, 43%) was obtained after concentration and purification under vacuum. (3) Compound 2 (3.06 g) and 1,3,5-tribromobenzene (1.84 g) in a mixed solution of anhydrous toluene (90 mL) and anhydrous ethanol (45 mL) were reacted (50 °C, 30 min, under a N2 atmosphere). Then Pd(PPh3)4 (0.10 g) and potassium carbonate aqueous solution (24 mL) were added to the above solution for further reaction (90 °C, stirred for 24 h, under a N2 atmosphere), and Compound 3 (yield: 1.06 g, 42%) was obtained after purification by vacuum distillation. (4) Compound 3 (0.710 g), bis(pinacolato)diboron (0.510 g) and sodium acetate (0.55 g) in anhydrous 1,4-dioxane were reacted (30 mL, 50 °C, stirred for 20 min, under a N2 atmosphere). Then PdCl2(PPh3)2 (0.06 g) was added to the above solution for a further reflux process (50 °C, stirred for 16 h, under a N2 atmosphere), and then the resulting mixture was concentrated under vacuum to obtain Compound 4 (yield: 0.44 g, 56%). (5) 3,6-Bis(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (0.460 g) and Compound 4 (0.800 g) were added in a mixed solution of anhydrous toluene (60 mL) and anhydrous ethanol (30 mL, 50 °C, stirred for 20 min, under a N2 atmosphere). Then, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (0.04 g) and K2CO3 (12.5 mL) were added to the above solution for initiating the activation process (activation for 24 h, under microwave irradiation at 90 °C), and Compound 5 (yield: 0.45 g, 52%) was obtained after purification by vacuum distillation. (6) Compound 5 (0.400 g) was added to anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) solution (R.T., stirred for 20 min, under a N2 atmosphere). Then 2-azido-1,3-dimethylimidazolinium hexafluorophosphate (ADMP; 0.75 g) and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU; 0.61 g) were added to the above solution for further reaction (R.T., stirred for 4 h, under a N2 atmosphere). Finally, the compound DPPTPTA (yield: 0.21 g, 48%) was obtained after purification by vacuum distillation. The whole synthetic route is shown in Scheme 2.

2.2. Synthesis of CuCoP/CNF
The CuCoP/CNF composite was synthesized by using electrospinning followed by the carbonization method. In this synthesis procedure, 1 g of polyacrylonitrile was dispersed in 25 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) at 80 °C with continuous magnetic stirring (Solution A). Then 0.04 M copper(II) chloride dehydrate (0.171 g), 0.08 M cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (0.486 g), and 0.12 M red phosphorous (0.093 g) were mixed in 25 mL of DMF with magnetic stirring (Solution B) for 2 h.33,43 Subsequently, Solution B was added into Solution A with vigorous stirring for 6 h at 80 °C to acquire a polymer mixture. The obtained polymer mixture was filled into a 5 mL plastic syringe with a 21-gauge stainless steel tip needle. The experimental conditions, including the distance between the tip of the needle and the sample collector (15 cm), applied voltage (15 kV) and flow rate (10 μL min−1) were fixed appropriately. Finally, the fiber-like sample was collected from the collector and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 6 h and further annealed at 250 °C (10 °C min−1) for 2 h. After annealing, the sample was further carbonized at 900 °C (10 °C min−1) in a N2 atmosphere for 3 h. The resultant black fibrous CuCoP/CNF was collected and used for further synthesis of composite.
2.3. Preparation of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer coated PtCE
The DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer was synthesized by blending the prepared DPPTPTA conjugated molecule with the CuCoP/CNF composite at different weight ratios (wt% = 1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 2:2, 3:1 and 3:2) in 5 mL of acetone solvent, where wt% is in milligram (mg). The above homogeneous solutions were subjected to a vigorous ultrasonic process for 3 h, and subsequent magnetic stirring process for 24 h. The obtained blended DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF (5 mL) was drop-coated on PtCE (Pt layer thickness is around 197.36 μm and area = 3.125 cm2). After coating, the obtained modified layer was kept on a hot plate at 40 °C for 6 h, and then placed in a vacuum container. The above method was also used to prepare the other two modified layers (CuCoP/CNF and DPPTPTA coated PtCE).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of DPPTPTA conjugated molecules
The DPPTPTA molecule is characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (FT-NMR), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In addition, the chemical positions of all protons in the FT-NMR spectrum of DPPTPTA are accurately assigned (Fig. S1A, ESI†), and the high purity results for DPPTPTA have also been confirmed using the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum (Fig. S1B, ESI†). All structural information can be summarized as 1H NMR (δ/ppm, 400 MHz, CDCl3): 9.01 (d, J = 4.18 Hz, 2H), 7.83–7.81 (m, 4H), 7.76–7.74 (m, 2H), 7.62 (d, J = 8.08 Hz, 8H), 7.57 (d, J = 4.01 Hz, 2H), 7.32 (d, J = 8.09 Hz, 8H), 4.17–4.05 (m, 4H), 3.35 (t, J = 6.71 Hz, 8H), 2.80 (t, J = 7.38 Hz, 4H), 2.02–1.93 (m, 10H), 1.42–1.23 (m, 16H), 0.93 (t, J = 7.46 Hz, 6H), 0.85 (t, J = 6.80 Hz, 6H). MALDI-TOF MS, calcd for C78H84N14O2S2: m/z 1312.634; found 1312.635. MALDI-TOF MS, calcd for C78H84N14O2S2: m/z 1313.72; found 1312.635. Elemental analysis, calcd for C78H84N14O2S2: C, 71.31%; H, 6.44%; N, 14.93%; O, 2.44%; S, 4.88%; found: C, 71.54%; H, 6.68%; N, 14.17%; O, 2.20%; S, 4.75%.
3.2. Characterization of the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF composite
In the beginning, the mixture of precursor solution containing polyacrylonitrile (PAN), copper(II) chloride dehydrate, cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate, and red phosphorous was electrospun as a fiber matrix. Then, the fiber matrix was subjected to the stabilization reaction by applying temperature around 250 °C for 2 h. In this stabilization process, the intramolecular cyclization, aromatization and oxidation reaction can occur. During this step, the hydrogen small gas molecules simultaneously volatilize as the by-products, which creates abundant porosity in the resultant carbon product. In the second step, the annealing condition was changed to 900 °C (10 °C min−1), while the PAN turned into carbonized carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and metal precursors (copper(II) chloride dehydrate and cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate) decomposed into Cu and Co nanocrystals. The metal nanocrystals were encapsulated at the edge of the porous PAN-derived CNF. In a hydrogen atmosphere and under high temperature (900 °C (10 °C min−1)) annealing conditions, Cu, Co nanocrystals and red phosphorous were typically involved in the phosphorization process and induced the formation of the CuCoP embedded CNF (CuCoP/CNF). In the third step, the DPPTPTA was mixed with CuCoP/CNF by using an ultrasonic and mechanical stirring process. Due to the effective mechanical process, a strong intertube van der Waals attraction can be generated between CuCoP/CNF and DPPTPTA.44,45 The successful formation of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF was further studied by using various analytical methods as follows.

Fig. 1(A) displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CuCoP/CNF, copper phosphide, cobalt phosphide, pure electrospun CNF, and graphite samples. The obtained XRD pattern of copper phosphide shows the peaks corresponding to the standard JCPDS 65-1973;46 however, cobalt phosphide exhibits diffraction peaks, in agreement with JCPDS 65-2381.47–49 The pure electrospun CNF with a graphitic structure and high surface area was synthesized by using carbonization at 900 °C.50 To understand the graphitic nature of pure electrospun CNF, the XRD pattern of electrospun CNF was compared with the XRD pattern of pure graphitic carbon. Both XRD patterns show a similar characteristic peak at 26.48° for the corresponding (002) plane and matched with JCPDS 8-415 standard data.51 The presence of (002) indicates the formation of electrospun CNF with graphitic domain and amorphous nature. The CuCoP/CNF composite exhibits combined diffraction peaks of copper phosphide, cobalt phosphide, and graphitic carbon. This preliminarily result suggests the formation of CuCoP and its integration with electrospun CNF. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was carried out to understand the electronic state of the prepared CuCoP/CNF composite. The wide scan XPS spectrum is shown in Fig. 1(B) with the characteristic peaks of Cu 2p, Co 2p, P 2p, C 1s and O 1s. This indicates the presence of Cu 2p, Co 2p, P 2p, and C 1s states in CuCoP/CNF samples, whereas the O 1s is ascribed due to the surface contaminants. Fig. 1(C) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p. Two peaks for spin–orbit doublets of Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 are present at binding energies of 952.46 and 932.65 eV, respectively. Both the doublet peaks contain the mixed electronic states of +2 and +4. Consequently, two satellite peaks are located at 942.44 and 962.37 eV. Meanwhile, the XPS spectra of Co 2p are deconvoluted into two characteristics peaks of Co 2p1/2 (796.93 eV) and Co 2p3/2 (780.84 eV) including the two satellites peaks at binding energies of 786.05 and 802.57 eV, respectively (Fig. 1(D)). The high-resolution XPS spectra of P 2p peak at 129.3 eV and 128.8 eV seen in Fig. 1(E) are associated with P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2, respectively, whereas the peak at 132.97 eV is associated with P–O due to the exposure of atmosphere air. Besides, the characteristic peaks located at 287.54, 285.55, and 284.95 eV can be ascribed to the CC–O, C–O, and C–C species, respectively (Fig. 1(F)).

The CuCoP/CNF composite is analyzed using in situ Raman spectroscopy, in which the lattice defects (D-band) and the degree of graphitization (G-band) of carbon atoms are shown in Fig. S2A (ESI†). In Raman spectra, the D-band is located at about 1346 cm−1, whereas the G-band is located at around 1592 cm−1. The intensity ratio of the G to D bands (IG/ID) is 0.85, indicating that the CuCoP/CNF composite has a relatively high degree of graphite defects and has more active sites on the surface.52–54 In addition, the specific surface area and pore size distribution of CuCoP/CNF composite are further analyzed by using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. Fig. S2(B–D) (ESI†) show the mesoporous characteristics of CuCoP/CNF composite with a specific surface area of 26.16 m2 g−1, a BJH adsorption average pore diameter of 131.4 Å, and a BJH desorption average pore diameter of 105.3 Å. These results indicate that the CuCoP/CNF composite has a uniform pore size distribution, and the specific surface area.

Fig. 2(A)–(C) show the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of CuCoP/CNF. The CuCoP/CNF composite has a uniform porous three-dimensional nanofiber structure, whereas uniform distribution of CuCoP nanoparticles can be observed on the CNF structure. In addition, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was utilized to understand the internal shape and crystal atomic structure of CuCoP/CNF composite. Through different magnifications (Fig. 2(D)–(F)), it can be observed that CuCoP nanoparticles are fused into the outer surface of CNF, with a thickness of about 19.5 nm. The fusion of CuCoP nanoparticles into CNF is distinguished by using the red and yellow dotted lines as shown in Fig. 2(F). In the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(G)), the distorted lattice of carbon nanofiber can be observed (highlighted by the white ellipse). This indicates that the prepared CNF is formed with defects surface. In Fig. 2(H), the nanometer-sized CuCoP particles exhibit the clear lattice fringes associated with the plane of (111) and a d-spacing of 0.33 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows bright rings with many spots indexed to 221, 113, 111, 112, and 201 lattice planes of CoP (JCPDS No: 65-238) and CuP (JCPDS No: 65-1973) mixed-phase, which is consistent with the XRD diffraction results (Fig. 2(I)). In addition, the incorporation of DPPTPTA into CuCoP/CNF was confirmed by using the FE-SEM images (Fig. 3(A)–(C)). It also shows that the DPPTPTA molecule is uniformly covered on the surface of CuCoP/CNF, whereas the DPPTPTA molecules are connected to two or more CuCoP/CNFs in the form of a bundle. Thus, DPPTPTA can act as an interconnected path among the fibers. This would certainly facilitate the electron conduction to the electrolyte from the modified layer.40–42 The elemental distribution of the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer was also studied by using the EDX mapping analysis. The corresponding result is illustrated in Fig. 3(D)–(J), which respectively shows the uniform distribution of C, O, Co, Cu, P, N, and S elements (represented by different colors) on the surface of prepared DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF heterostructure. The signals of elements N, O, and S are associated with the DPPTPTA conjugated molecule, and meanwhile the signals of Cu, Co, and P are related to CuCoP/CNF. Herein, the C signal was observed for both DPPTPTA and the CuCoP/CNF composite.

Density functional theory (DFT) was studied with a B3LYP/6 31G* standard and the simulated result shows that the DPPTPTA molecule has large bond torsion angles (25.9° and 38.1°), with a strong steric effect originating from the terphenyl groups, which resulted in a lower degree of intermolecular accumulation. The simulated molecular structure of DPPTPTA is shown in Fig. 3(K). In fact, the experimental results also show that the introduction of the terphenyl structure into the DPP derivative can cause the molecular distortion and effectively destroy the intermolecular π–π stacking. Therefore, this also proves that DPPTPTA has a lower degree of molecular aggregation.40–42 The nano-level elemental distribution in the prepared samples of CuCoP/CNF and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF heterostructures was studied by using the elemental line mapping profile. Fig. S3(A–F) (ESI†) show the cross-sectional view of CuCoP/CNF coated on the Pt/FTO substrate and the corresponding line mapping profile for the major constituents, such as C Ka1_2, Cu La1_2, Co La1_2, and P Ka1. On the other hand, the cross-sectional view of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF coated on the Pt/FTO and the corresponding line mapping profile for C Ka1_2, Cu La1_2, Co La1_2, P Ka1, N Ka1_2, O Ka1, and S Ka1 are demonstrated respectively in Fig. S3(G–O) (ESI†). The above study confirmed that the samples of CuCoP/CNF and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF were successfully prepared and uniformly coated on the Pt/FTO substrate. In addition, Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the cross-sectional FE-SEM image of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified PtCE. It can be observed that the thickness of Pt and the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer is about 197.36 μm and 15.89 μm respectively. For better understanding, the synthesis and preparation of CuCoP/CNF and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layers are schematically illustrated in the top portion of Scheme 3. The bottom portion shows the real photos of bare PtCE as well as the modified layers of bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, and their corresponding schematics.

In order to examine the contribution of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF as a modified layer to the DSSC device, the porosity and electrolyte uptake measurements were performed. First of all, the porosity (P) of the modified layer was quantified by an absorption method with n-butanol solution by following the previous publications.55–57 In this method, the modified layer was first weighed, and then soaked in n-butanol solution for 2 h. Afterward, the wet modified layer was weighed again, and the absorbed mass of n-butanol was calculated. The P% of modified layer was calculated by using eqn (1), (1)where M0 and MBuOH represent the masses of dry and wet modified layers with butanol, respectively, ρ0 is the density of the dry modified layer, and ρBuOH is the density of modified layer following the absorption of butanol.55 Second, the modified layer was immersed in the iodide/triiodide electrolyte (I−/I3−) for 2 h, and the uptake of the electrolyte (δ) was calculated by using eqn (2), (2)where M0 and M are the masses of dry and wet modified layers, respectively. From the results of porosity and electrolyte uptake, it is clear that the device with the modified layer has a higher porosity of 91% and a higher electrolyte uptake of 637%, as compared to those of bare PtCE, which has no porosity and electrolyte uptake. These results are shown in Fig. 4(A) and summarized in Table 2. This is due to the advantages in structural engineering, as provided by the composite materials and electrospinning technology. The porous three-dimensional nanofiber structure in the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer can provide higher surface roughness and larger porosity, thereby increasing the uptake of electrolytes.

3.3. Electrochemical properties of DSSCs with the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer
In order to study the performance of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer in the DSSC, some electrochemical parameters need to be quantified, including the apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp), ionic conductivity (σ), cathodic peak current density (Jpc), and peak separation value (ΔEp, namely, the potential difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks). First, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to obtain the Dapp value of devices with modified layers. For this study, the standard measurement was done based on a symmetrical dummy cell (FTO/Pt/modified layer/electrolyte/modified layer/Pt/FTO, where the corresponding modified layer area is kept at 3.125 cm2) with the iodide/triiodide electrolyte (I−/I3−) was used. In this experiment, the standard device (without a modified layer) and the devices with different modified layers (bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF) were studied and compared. Fig. 4(B) shows the result of LSV. The limiting current density (Jlim) values of different modified layers are calculated based on the LSV result. The obtained Jlim values were used to calculate the corresponding Dapp by using eqn (3),58 Dapp = dJlim(2nFC)−1(3)where d refers to the cell gap (25 μm), F is known as the Faraday constant (96485.4 C mol−1), n represents the number of electrons transferred (n = 2 for the iodide system), and C is the concentration of I3− (0.05 M). For the symmetrical dummy cells with bare PtCE as well as the modified layers of bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, the Dapp values are calculated to be 2.94 × 10−6, 4.11 × 10−6, 3.56 × 10−6, and 5.11 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, respectively (Table 2). It is apparent that the Jlim values depend on the diffusivity of the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple in a DSSC. Moreover, the presence of modified layer shortens the path of electron transport, thus enhancing the charge transfer at the interface of counter electrode/electrolyte. In addition, due to the interaction between the nanoparticles and liquid electrolyte, a space charge layer is formed around the CuCoP nanoparticles. At the optimal concentration, the nanoparticles can pass through these space charge layers, which facilitate the electron conduction and improve the shuttle of I−/I3−. Therefore, the DSSC with DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF as the modified layer has a higher Dapp value.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to analyze the values of Jpc and ΔEp in the presence of the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer (Fig. 4(C)). These results were obtained from the devices (FTO/photoanode/electrolyte/modified layer/Pt/FTO, where the corresponding photoanode active area = 0.196 cm2 and the modified layer area = 3.125 cm2) with iodide/triiodide electrolyte (I−/I3−). Herein, the Jpc is mainly used to quantify the electrocatalytic ability, which indicates the rate of the electrochemical reduction reaction (the rate of reduction of triiodide to iodide). Based on Fig. 4(C), Jpc values were calculated to be 0.82, 1.43, 1.29, and 2.28 mA cm−2 for the standard device and the devices with different modified layers, such as bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, respectively. On the other hand, the result of ΔEp was used to express the potential required to drive the redox reaction. The values of ΔEp are 0.52, 0.46, 0.31, and 0.44 V for the standard device and the devices with different modified layers, such as bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, respectively. Among them, the ΔEp of the device with the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer is slightly increased, reflecting the slower electron transfer due to more effective adsorption on the electrode. Moreover, at the same scan potential, the rate of charge transfer to larger molecules is slower because more rearrangement is required before electron transfer.59 The results of CV are shown in Fig. 4(C), and the corresponding Jpc and ΔEp values are given in Table 2. The results conclude that the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer not only has a better electrocatalytic ability, but can drive the redox reaction at a lower potential as well. In addition, it is known that the specific surface area is not only factor to determine the electrocatalytic ability of modified layer; in fact, the directional electron transport path will greatly promote the transport of electrons to active site during electrocatalytic reactions.60 Therefore, it can be suggested that the nanoparticles in the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer and the porous three-dimensional nanofiber structure provide a larger reaction area and faster electron transmission.
Afterward, the results of σ were analyzed by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The measurement system was also based on a symmetrical dummy cell with the iodide/triiodide electrolyte (I−/I3−), where the bias voltage applied was −0.85 V against the open-circuit voltage (VOC). In this EIS analysis, bulk resistance (Rbulk) can be obtained from the first semicircle of the Nyquist plot,61,62 as shown in Fig. 5(A), and the corresponding results are given in Table 2. The value of σ was calculated by using the following eqn (4),58 σ = d(ARbulk)−1(4)where the cell constant d/A was calibrated by using a standard NaCl electrolyte (7230 ppm, σ = 12.9 mS cm−1). Accordingly, the values of σ were calculated to be 13.25, 19.24, 15.90 and 31.26 mS cm−1 for the symmetrical dummy cells with bare PtCE, bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, respectively. The DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer shows two ionic conduction paths. One is the liquid electrolyte being trapped in the pores, which acts as a highly ionic conduction path. The second one is a swollen composite fiber, which acts as a slow conduction path. This indicates that the conductivity (σ) mainly depends on the porosity, and thus the amount of electrolyte uptake. To be more specific, the formation of pores is essential for holding the electrolyte and providing proper ion conduction channels.57,63 Due to the uptake of electrolyte into the porous structure of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer, the ultrafine electrospun fiber radially swells and prohibits the electrolyte leakage.

3.4. Interfacial properties of DSSCs based on the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer
In order to discuss the interfacial properties of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF based DSSC, EIS was used to measure and further analyze the charge transfer ability of modified layer. Several interfacial parameters were measured, such as (1) bulk resistance (Rbulk) of modified layer, (2) the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, (3) the electron lifetime (τdarke) on the photoanode, (4) the charge transfer resistance at the interface/electrolyte interface (Rct1), (5) the charge transfer resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface (Rct2), and (6) the Warburg diffusion resistance (Zw). First, Rbulk was measured through a symmetrical dummy cell, and the value was calculated based on the first semicircle in the Nyquist plot. The experiment was performed under a bias voltage at −0.85 V vs. VOC, frequency (between 10 kHz and 100 Hz) and used the iodide/triiodide electrolyte (I−/I3−). The obtained values of Rbulk are 19.96, 13.75, 16.63, and 8.46 Ω for the symmetrical dummy cells with bare PtCE as well as the modified layers of bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, respectively. These results indicate that the DSSC with DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF as a modified layer possess the better ability of charge transfer. Fig. 5(A) shows the Nyquist plot of symmetrical dummy cells with bare PtCE and different modified layers and the values of Rbulk are summarized in Table 2.
The value of Rrec was measured by using a certain device type and calculated from the second semicircle in the Nyquist plot. The Rrec value is helpful to investigate the charge recombination resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. For this, the experimental conditions were fixed with a bias voltage at −0.85 V vs. VOC in a dark environment, and the electrolyte is an iodide/triiodide electrolyte (I−/I3−). The corresponding result is shown in Fig. 5(B), from which the Rrec values were calculated to be 21.06, 26.07, 28.96, and 32.85 Ω for the standard device and the devices with different modified layers, such as bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, respectively. The above results show that the use of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer is effective for inhibiting the charge recombination reaction in a DSSC. These results are tabulated in Table 2.
In addition, τdarke has a high correlation with Rrec. In a DSSC, the larger Rrec is directly proportional to the smaller the probability of charge recombination is. Thus, under dark conditions with a potential bias, the electron lifetime needs to be confirmed by investigating the ability to inhibit the charge recombination. Fig. 5(C) shows the Bode plots under dark conditions. The electron lifetime (τdarke) in the photoanode can be measured by using the frequency value at the maximum phase (fmax), as shown in eqn (5).58 τdarke = (2πfmax)−1(5)
The values of τdarke are 7.58, 12.05, 18.07, and 26.54 ms for the standard device and the devices with different modified layers, such as bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, respectively. The above results indicate that the existence of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layers can effectively inhibit the charge recombination reaction, thus leading to increase the Rrec and prolonging the electron lifetime.
Finally, the values of Rct1, Rct2, and Zw were obtained from the first, second and third semicircles observed in the high, medium, and low-frequency range of Nyquist plot, respectively (Fig. 5(D)). The values of Rct1 are 9.09, 6.89, 8.99 and 3.77 Ω; the values of Rct2 are 19.61, 19.11, 19.22 and 19.01 Ω; the values of Zw are 7.21, 6.99, 7.11 and 6.87 Ω for the standard device and the devices with different modified layers, including bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, respectively. The above-mentioned results are summarized in Table 2. It indicates that the use of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF as a modified layer in DSSC could result in a higher charge transfer ability and become an effective way to inhibit the charge recombination reaction. According to Table 2, the following correlations between electrochemical properties and interfacial properties can be summarized: (1) Rbulk and Rct1 are highly related, since Rbulk/2 ≅ Rct1. Therefore, the smaller value of Rbulk is associated to the larger value of σ. This means that the modified layer plays an important role in determining the charge transfer ability in DSSC. (2) The larger value of Rrec is related to the larger value of τdarke. This means that the greater ability to inhibit the charge recombination reaction and the longer the electron lifetime. (3) The smaller the value of Zw is related to the larger value of Dapp. All these depends on the existence of modified layer. In this case, a space charge layer is formed around the nanoparticles in the modified layer, which facilitates electron conduction and improves the I−/I3− shuttle. (4) In addition, it is particularly noteworthy that the Rct2 values have little difference between the standard device and the devices with all modified layers. In fact, Rct2 is mainly related to the charge transfer impedance between the electrolyte/photoanode, which is not much relevant to the modified layer applied on Pt.
3.5. Photovoltaic properties of DSSCs with the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer
The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layers is evaluated in this section. In general, the photovoltaic properties can be understood from (1) the photocurrent density–voltage curve (J–V curve) and the corresponding photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) produced under 1 sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) condition, (2) the J–V curve obtained under the dark conditions and the corresponding onset potential (Vonset), (3) the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) generated using different modified layers in DSSCs, and (4) η obtained under indoor light (6000 lux) through the application of different modified layers in DSSCs.
First, Fig. 6(A) shows the J–V curves for the standard device without and with modified layer under 1 sun conditions. All DSSCs contain an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte. Among the DSSCs with three different modified layers, the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF based DSSC has the highest η of 9.50%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 827 mV, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.25 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71 (Table 3). The DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer was subjected to the two-stage optimization process to achieve high-efficiency DSSCs. The first stage involved in optimizing the loading amounts of DPPTPTA (Fig. S5A, ESI†) and CuCoP/CNF (Fig. S5B, ESI†) on the modified layer, and the corresponding results are tabulated in Table S1 (ESI†). For the second stage, different loading amounts of DPPTPTA and CuCoP/CNF are brought together so as to further optimize the DSSC performance (Fig. S5C, ESI†). The corresponding results are given in Table S2 (ESI†). From these results, DPPTPTA can effectively separate the charges due to its well-designed molecular structure and good charge mobility. DPPTPTA also contributes substantially to the improvement of JSC, which is related to Rbulk and Rct1 in the interfacial properties. In addition, the CuCoP/CNF bimetallic TMPs have good electrocatalytic ability and excellent electron transfer paths with the assistance of electrospinning structural engineering, and their substantial contribution to the improvement of VOC, which can be correspond to Rrec and τdarke in the interfacial properties. Due to the special fibrous structure of bare CuCoP/CNF with excellent electron transfer paths, it can transport electrons more efficiently, as compared to that of bare DPPTPTA. This results show the slightly higher η of bare CuCoP/CNF as a modified layer, as compared to that of bare DPPTPTA. On the other hand, FF is related to the diffusion capacity of electrolyte, and thus the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF combines the above advantages, and effectively provides the charge transfer between the electrolyte/modified layer, and shortens the path of electron transfer. The obtained FF can be associated to the value of Zw and Dapp. In addition, Fig. 6(B) shows the J–V curve under dark conditions, in which the bias was fixed at −0.85 V vs. VOC, and the electrolyte was the iodide/triiodide electrolyte (I−/I3−). The value of Vonset generated under dark conditions is related to the ability of different modified layers to inhibit the charge recombination. The values of Vonset are 520, 595, 608 and 655 mV for the standard device and the devices with different modified layers, including bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, respectively (Table 3). This indicates that the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer has a better ability to inhibit the charge recombination than other modified layers. This is consistent with the trend of Rrec.

Second, Fig. 6(C) shows the IPCE spectra of all cells in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm. The IPCE value was calculated using eqn (6), where λ is the wavelength, JSC(λ) is the specific short-circuit photocurrent density obtained at a specific wavelength, and φ is the incident radiant flux.64–66 (6)
The JSC value of a DSSC can also be calculated from the IPCE spectra (denoted as JSC-IPCE) by integrating the area under the IPCE curve. The values of JSC-IPCE are 13.87, 14.04, 13.82, and 14.52 mA cm−2 for the standard device and the devices with different modified layers, such as bare DPPTPTA, CuCoP/CNF, and DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF, respectively. This result is consistent with the JSC investigation, indicating that the application of DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer as a DSSC still has a reasonable conversion efficiency at different wavelengths. As shown in Table 3, there is a 12% deviation between the values of JSC and JSC-IPCE. Generally, the monochromator only allows the working wavelengths from 400 to 800 nm and does not cover the ultraviolet (UV, 300–400 nm wavelength) spectral region. Therefore, JSC will be slightly larger than JSC-IPCE. According to the previous literature reports, the contribution of JSC-IPCE from 300 to 400 nm results with deviation of 10–20%.67,68
On the other hand, it has become particularly important to measure the value of η under lower light irradiation conditions, for example, the self-contained low-power indoor electronic devices with wireless internet connections. Therefore, a typical T5 fluorescent lamp (the current standard for indoor lighting testing with an intensity ranging from 900 to 6000 lux) was selected.69 Exciting information is revealed when the light intensity is at 6000 lux (1.89 mW cm−2); the DSSC with the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer reached an impressive η of 25.44%, a VOC of 696 mV, a JSC of 943.7 μA cm−2, and an FF of 0.75 (Fig. 7(A)). Table 4 compares the photovoltaic properties of various DSSCs made with and without the modifier layer measured under different light intensities. As a comparison between 1 sun and T5 fluorescent lamp conditions, the sunlight exposure under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) conditions is equivalent to 100000–110000 lux. Therefore, 1000 lux indoor light is approximately 1% of the standard AM 1.5G solar radiation. The light emission spectra with 1 sun and T5 fluorescent lamps are shown in Fig. 7(B), from which the emission spectrum recorded under T5 conditions mainly contains blue, green, and red light, with the maximum wavelengths of about 430, 550, and 620 nm. The reasons responsible for the high η of DSSCs under the conditions of lower light intensity are shown as follows: (1) the contribution of dye, which should be able to effectively collect sunlight and artificial dim light and (2) the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer can effectively inhibit the charge recombination reaction, the aggregation of dye molecules, and provide an effective space charge layer to accelerate the shuttle of (I−/I3−) under lower light intensity. This proves that the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer can be applied to a wide range of irradiation conditions and different environments.

3.6. Long-term stability of DSSCs with the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer

Fig. 8 shows the long-term stability of DSSCs based on the standard device (without any modified layer) and the device with a DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer. A solar simulator (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) was used to simulate the DSSC tested under 1 sun conditions up to 3000 h (approximately 4 months), and the η values of the devices were calculated every 72 h. The long-term stability results show that the DSSC with a DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer maintained 90% retention after 3000 h, while only 60% retention is obtained for the standard device. In other words, the degradation rate of the standard device is faster than that of the DSSC with DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer. It is concluded that the as-spun CuCoP/CNF membrane can effectively increase the porosity and electrolyte uptake after carbonization at 900 °C (Fig. 4(A)), and the data are summarized in Table 2. Since the carbonized CuCoP/CNF maintains a perfect porous three-dimensional structure as shown in Fig. S6A (ESI†), and the porous three-dimensional structure can retain the electrolyte in the nanospace to prevent volatilization and improve long-term stability. The visual photograph of the electrode was taken with DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer and bare PtCE before and after soaking in the iodide electrolyte for 168 h (Fig. S6(B) and (C), ESI†). The results also show that the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer indeed plays an important role in enhancing the corrosion stability. After 168 h of corrosion test, the pure PtCE surface was observed in the FE-SEM image, and the traces of unevenness and corrosion can be clearly seen (Fig. S6(D)–(F), ESI†). However, when the electrode surface is coated with a DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer, its three-dimensional structure is completely preserved (Fig. S6(G)–(I), ESI†). Finally, the PtCE under the protection of the DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer, which inhibits the corrosion traces (Fig. S6(J)–(L), ESI†); this means that its potential application in DSSC application.

4. Conclusions
The DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF layer was fabricated for the first time and used in DSSCs to enhance the device performance attributed to the factors of good electrocatalytic ability, high ionic conductivity, and effective suppression of charge recombination reactions. In addition, the electrospinning structure engineering enables strong interaction between CuCoP and CNF. Therefore, the liquid electrolyte would form a space charge layer on the surface of CuCoP/CNF. This brings about rapid electronic conduction, enhanced I−/I3− shuttles and ion diffusivity. A DSSC with a DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer shows excellent photovoltaic performance under 1 sun conditions with an η of 9.50%, and it reaches an η of 25.44% when the indoor light intensity of 6000 lux was used. The DSSC with a DPPTPTA@CuCoP/CNF modified layer maintains 90% retention after 3000 h of continuous testing, indicating the long-term stability and significantly improved performance for real-time solar cell application.
