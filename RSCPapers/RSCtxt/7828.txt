    , Accepted 20th July 2020First published on 21st July 2020AbstractTransition metal sulfides have been investigated as promising bifunctional materials for catalytic energy generation and energy storage applications. Although various strategies such as tuning the size, phase or defects and composition engineering have led to catalytic enhancement, there still remains the requirement for better performance for practical applications. In this study, we have used a potentially scalable solventless route for phase selective synthesis of α-NiS or β-NiS. Both phases were doped with different transition metals (Cu, Co and Fe) for enhanced catalytic performance. Interestingly, besides commonly observed thermal assisted phase transition, dopant (Co, Cu, and Fe) induced α- to β-phase transition or vice versa was also observed which has rarely been reported for NiS. The effect of dopants on the crystal structure and electrocatalytic activity has been investigated. The best supercapacitive behavior was observed for Co-doped α-NiS which showed a specific capacitance of 1586 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and a high rate capability. On the other hand, Fe-doped α-NiS displayed the best electrocatalytic activity for both the OER (266 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and the HER (146 mV at 10 mA cm−2), with Tafel slopes of 79 and 113 mV dec−1 respectively. The Fe-doped α-NiS catalyst was also used as both the anode and cathode in an electrolyzer, in which an overpotential of about 410 mV at 10 mA cm−2 was observed. The prepared electrodes demonstrate outstanding stability and flexibility.
1. Introduction
The current and projected future energy needs continue to inspire research on alternative energy resources and advanced technologies for renewable energy storage.1,2 Supercapacitors, which are known to possess several significant properties,1 are regarded as promising energy storage devices.3 They, however, display low energy density as compared to batteries, and the main focus of current research is elevating the energy density while upholding high power density and cycling ability.4 Another form of chemical energy storage involves the production of hydrogen, an eco-friendly and renewable energy carrier,5via the water splitting process. Among other methods, the electrochemical splitting of water presents a simple approach to produce high purity hydrogen.6 Nevertheless, a cost-effective and sustainable process requires the use of earth-abundant, eco-friendly and highly efficient catalysts for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).7 To this end, recent studies have therefore focused on the design of electroactive materials with advanced properties for further enhancement of supercapacitor performance and water splitting activity.8,9
Tuning the composition of materials by doping appropriate elements is recognized as an effective way to advance the properties of the materials.10 These new or improved properties are usually a result of change in the electronic structure,11 spin exchange,12 or structural defects13 caused by the interaction between the host material and the dopant. The incorporated species reside in the host lattice by replacing one of the host atoms or by occupying interstitial positions.14–16 Studies have shown that, among other factors, the electrochemical performance of a material can be enhanced by doping appropriate cations or anions into the crystal structure of the material.17–19 These incorporated species can boost the electrochemical performance by inducing structural defects, improving materials' conductivity, and/or creating abundant catalytically active sites in the host structure. For-instance, He et al. examined the effect of doping Na+ on the structure and performance of a Li- and Mn-rich electrode. It was observed that the introduction of Na+ induced abundant stacking faults which enhanced the performance of the electrode in lithium-ion batteries.20 Zhong et al. reported the synthesis and electrochemical investigations of pure and N-doped Ni3S2/VS2 heterostructures towards water splitting applications.21 Doping nitrogen into the Ni3S2/VS2 heterostructure greatly improved the conductivity and the number of catalytic sites for an efficient hydrogen evolution activity. Likewise, it was demonstrated by Xie et al. that doping cobalt into the NiS2 crystal lattice adjusts the electronic environment and morphology of the electrode for an enhanced supercapacitor performance.22
As a class of earth-abundant, inexpensive, and eco-friendly materials, nickel sulfides have been extensively studied.23–27 The group consists of compounds with varying Ni to S stoichiometries and phases, which result in distinct properties and applications.23 Recent investigations on nickel sulfides have focused on their efficiency for a number of energy storage and conversion technologies in which Ni3S4, Ni3S2, NiS2, and NiS have shown promising potential.24–26,28 Stoichiometric NiS occurs as a hexagonal (nickeline, α-NiS) phase or rhombohedral (millerite, β-NiS) phase.28–30 The former displays paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic as well as metallic to semiconducting transitions,31 while the latter has been shown to be metallic in nature.32 The occurrence of the two polymorphs mainly depends on the reaction temperature, where the hexagonal phase is generally obtained at high temperatures while the rhombohedral phase is obtained at low temperatures. A transition between the two phases can take place at 379 ± 3 °C.23 NiS has specifically been studied for its use in dye-sensitized solar cells,33 supercapacitors,29 lithium-ion batteries,34 and catalysis.28 In an effort to improve the electrochemical performance of the material, various modifications such as formation of hybrid-/hetero-structures,21,35 defect control, structural tuning,22 porosity control and doping30 have been made. Doping nickel sulfides with transition metal ions has been shown to improve electronic conductivity, expose the catalytically active sites and/or lower the activation energy barrier for efficient energy storage and generation activities.21,36–38
Numerous synthetic techniques for the preparation of nickel sulfides have been developed. They include hydrothermal,39 solvothermal,40 spray pyrolysis,41 hot injection,27 and microwave-assisted methods.25 The solventless approach/the melt method, in which nanomaterials are synthesized by the solid-state pyrolysis of single source precursors, has been recently described as a simple and scalable route to the preparation of nanomaterials.42,43 Compared to most colloidal routes, nanomaterials are synthesized in the absence of passivating ligands as the method is referred to as self-capping.43 Nanostructured materials with different dimensions, morphologies, properties and applications have been prepared via this route.43 Herein, we report the synthesis of transition metal (Fe, Cu, and Co) doped α- and β-NiS via the solventless, surfactant-free thermolysis of respective metal ethyl xanthate precursors. The tolerance of α- and β-phases towards different transition metal dopants has been investigated and the efficiency of the synthesized transition metal (TM) doped NiS for supercapacitance and water splitting applications has been examined.

A ceramic boat containing a homogeneous mixture of 0.3 g of complex (1) and the required amount of the dopant precursor (x = 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1 and 0.125 for complex (2); 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.1 for complex (3); and 0.025, 0.05 and 0.075 for complex (4)) was placed at the center of a quartz tube and heated in a furnace at 200 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere.

Scans were recorded in a high angle 2θ range of 10–80° at a speed of 0.2 s per step and an increment of 0.01314. The surface morphology of the particles was analyzed by using a Zeiss Ultra Plus FEG Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with an Oxford detector EDX at 20 kV which uses Aztec software for elemental analysis.
2.6. Electrochemical studies
Electrochemical characterization of the synthesized TM-doped NiS was performed using a Versastat 4-500 electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research, USA). Supercapacitive properties and electrocatalytic activities were studied in a three-electrode measurement system. A paste consisting of the nickel sulfide-based samples (80 wt%), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, 10 wt%), and acetylene black (10 wt%) was prepared using N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent. This paste was then applied to pre-cleaned and weighted nickel foam. The paste was then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 10 hours and used as a working electrode. Ni foam (EQ-BCNF-16m) from MTI Corporation, USA, was used for this study with 99.99% purity. The surface density of the nickel foam was 346 g m−2. Conducting acetylene black (EQ-Lib-AB), from MTI Corporation, USA, was used as commercial carbon having a particle size of 35–40 nm. A graphite rod/platinum wire and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All the experiments for energy storage and electrocatalysis were carried out using 3 M and 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively. Charge storage capacity was measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD) at various scan rates and current densities, respectively. The electrocatalytic properties of the synthesized nickel sulfide-based electrodes were studied using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry, and chronoamperometry (CA). LSV was performed at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 for both OER and HER measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed during all the tests in the frequency range of 0.05 Hz to 10 kHz with an applied AC amplitude of 10 mV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the precursors and the nanoparticles
The synthetic procedures for the preparation of xanthate complexes are well-documented.42,44–48 Complexes (1), (2), (3) and (4) were therefore prepared using a known synthetic protocol.46,48 Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out to study the decomposition behavior of the complexes prior to their solventless pyrolysis. The resultant thermograms are shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† The thermogram of complex (1) displays an onset temperature of 155 °C, and complete decomposition of the precursor occurs at 212 °C. A 72% weight loss is observed, leaving a 28% residue which matches with the theoretical weight calculated for NiS (29%). The initial decomposition of complex (2) occurs in the 150–350 °C temperature range to give a 26% residual weight which corresponds to that calculated for FeS2 (28.6%). Above 350 °C, a gradual mass loss ascribed to the loss of sulfur leaves 22.5% of the initial weight as the residue. This value matches closely with the theoretical weight of FeS (21%). Complex (3) displayed a lower onset temperature of 77 °C and full decomposition of the precursor occurs at 210 °C. 70% of the initial precursor weight is lost, yielding a 30% residue which corresponds to the theoretical value of CuS (31%). On the other hand, the decomposition of complex (4) occurs in the temperature range of 110–220 °C, yielding a 27% residual weight, which is in good agreement with the weight calculated for CoS (29%). The analysis generally indicates that all four complexes decompose at fairly low temperatures to give the respective metal sulfides. Moderate decomposition temperatures make xanthate precursors preferable for the synthesis of metal sulfides via the melt method. Furthermore, the high volatility of the generated by-products (alkene and carbonyl sulfide) ensures the formation of a pure metal sulfide.46
Prior to doping, complex (1) was thermalized at temperatures ranging from 200 to 400 °C in order to examine phase purity and to establish the temperatures at which doping can be carried out. The p-XRD analysis of the thermolysis products indicates the formation of both the α- (hexagonal) and β- (millerite) phases of NiS depending on the pyrolysis temperature (Fig. S2, ESI†). At 200 °C, the complex decomposed to give a pure crystalline phase of α-NiS (ICDD # 03-065-3419) (Fig. S2(a)†). Thermolysis of the precursor at 300 °C still produced the α-NiS phase, along with some additional diffraction peaks which are consistent with the standard patterns of the β-NiS phase (ICDD # 00-003-0760) (Fig. S2(b)†). An α–β-NiS composite was therefore formed at this temperature. Heating the complex at a higher reaction temperature of 400 °C affords the β-NiS phase containing only a few α-NiS peaks of extremely low intensity (Fig. S2(c)†). It can be seen that hexagonal NiS has been synthesized at low temperature, whereas the millerite, β-NiS phase has been synthesized at high temperature. These results therefore show temperature dependent phase reversibility behavior.23,49
To examine the influence of the cationic dopants on the NiS crystal structure with different atomic arrangements (i.e. α- and β-phases), doping was performed at 200 and 400 °C. The p-XRD patterns of α-NiS doped with different concentrations of Fe are presented in Fig. 1(a). It can be seen that introducing Fe (2.5–12.5%) into the α-NiS phase does not affect the structure or crystallinity of the material. All the observed diffraction peaks are still consistent with the standard patterns of hexagonal NiS (ICDD # 03-065-3419). The absence of diffraction peaks originating from iron sulfides suggests the successful incorporation of Fe3+ into the NiS lattice. Due to comparable ionic radii (Ni2+, 0.69 Å, and Fe3+, 0.55 Å), the dopant is most likely to reside in the lattice by mutual occupation of some of the Ni2+ positions. However, since Ni2+ is slightly larger in size than Fe3+, a small shift of the peak positions towards higher angles is observed (Fig. 1(b)). It should be noted that doping above 12.5% iron produces extra diffraction peaks. Therefore, it can be inferred that, by the solventless synthetic route, the saturation limit of Fe incorporation into the α-NiS phase is reached after 12.5%.
 Fig. 1  (a) p-XRD patterns of pure α-NiS and Fe-doped α-NiS synthesized at 200 °C. (b) Extended part of the diffraction patterns showing a shift in peak positions. 
Doping cobalt into the α-NiS phase displayed a very low saturation limit in which additional diffraction peaks originating mostly from the thiospinel CoNi2S4 phase were produced above 5% dopant concentration (ICDD #: 00-024-0334) (Fig. S3(a)†). In the stoichiometric thiospinel structure, Co is present at ≈14.27%; therefore an increase in the Co content to a certain degree may also allow the formation of a cubic thiospinel phase along with the α-NiS phase. This shows that Co can be doped up to 5% in α-NiS without introducing an impurity phase. The ionic size of Co2+ is smaller (0.65 Å) than that of Ni2+, and a slight movement of the peaks to higher angles is also observed in this case (Fig. S3(b)†).
Unlike cobalt and iron, doping copper into the α-NiS phase leads to the formation of β-NiS as the secondary phase (ICDD #: 00-003-0760) (Fig. 2). It was interesting to note the formation of the β-NiS phase even at just 1% concentration of the dopant precursor. The intensity of the β-NiS phase is observed to increase with increasing the dopant concentration, and above 5% dopant precursor, the β-NiS phase becomes dominant. Doping the α-NiS phase with Cu therefore induces the formation of the α–β-NiS composite.
 Fig. 2  p-XRD patterns of pure α-NiS and Cu-doped α-NiS synthesized at 200 °C. 
A different set of events was observed when the cations were doped into the β-NiS phase at 400 °C. Incorporating copper and cobalt at 5 and 10% concentrations into the β-NiS lattice forms α-NiS as the secondary phase (Fig. S4†). On the other hand, doping Fe even at just 1% concentration completely transforms the β-NiS phase into the α-NiS phase (ICDD # 03-065-3419) (Fig. 3). Though the doping performed at 200 °C suggested that cobalt can be introduced up to 5% without distorting the α-NiS phase, doping the same metal into β-NiS favoured the formation of an α–β-NiS composite phase. Similarly, it was thought that as the doping of Cu in α-NiS resulted in the formation of β-NiS and therefore doping of Cu in β-NiS might be favourable; however the doping of copper in both phases yielded a mixture of α-NiS and β-NiS phases by solventless synthesis.

All the above observations are interesting and require more explanation. The main difference between the α- and β-NiS phases arises from the way Ni and S are arranged in the respective crystal lattices, which in most cases determines the physicochemical properties of materials. In millerite NiS, sulfur atoms are arranged in infinite trigonal prisms and nickel atoms reside midway above each square face of the prisms forming a distorted square pyramid. The nickel–nickel distances in the prisms are very short (2.25 Å), suggesting a metallic character. The structural environment in the lattice is such that each nickel atom is coordinated to five sulfur atoms (Fig. S5, ESI†). Hexagonal NiS, on the other hand, assumes the NiAs-type structure in which the anions are arranged in a hexagonal close-packed array and the transition metal atoms fill the octahedral interstices. In this case, each nickel atom is therefore in a six coordination atmosphere with sulfur atoms (Fig. S5, ESI†).50 This generally means that the formation of the α-NiS phase is favored when there is an extra amount of sulfur in the system. Specifically, previous reports have shown that the proportion of Ni:S in the α-NiS phase varies in the 63:37 to 64:34 wt% range, while that of the β-NiS phase varies in the 64:36 to 67:33 wt% range.51,52 The use of xanthate precursors, which are rich in sulfur, is therefore expected to favour the formation of the α-NiS phase even at low temperatures. Initially this is also thought to be the main reason why the high temperature, α-NiS phase was formed at 200 °C, while the low temperature, β-NiS phase was formed at 400 °C. With an exception of copper (at 200 °C), all other dopants favored the formation of the α-NiS phase regardless of the reaction temperature. This can be attributed to the fact that doping with the corresponding metal xanthate precursor increases the sulfur content in the system which in turn increases the likelihood of the α-NiS phase being formed at both 200 and 400 °C. Moreover, the sulfur coordination in FeS is also 6 and resembles the sulfur environment of hexagonal NiS; consequently, the doping of iron in hexagonal NiS was successful, whereas the presence of iron in rhombohedral NiS may have created significant structural distortion resulting in structural transformation into hexagonal NiS. Phase transitions in NiS are mainly known to be temperature dependent,23,53 and only a few studies investigating the effect of doping NiS with transition metals are known.30,54–56 To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study marks the first report on the α–β-NiS phase transitions induced by doping. A comparison with previous studies, which employed solution based techniques,30,54–56 further suggests that the solventless approach employed herein plays a crucial role in the observed phase transitions.
The morphology of the synthesized materials was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. SEM images of both TM-doped and undoped NiS taken at a magnification of 10k× are shown in Fig. 4(a)–(d) and 5(a)–(d). At first glance, it can be interpreted from the images that quasi-spherical particles were synthesized at both 200 and 400 °C. However, an examination of the SEM images taken at a high magnification (100k×) reveals the synthesis of slightly elongated particles which agglomerate to form several clusters (Fig. S6, ESI†). The observed particle–particle agglomeration is attributed to the absence of a surface capping ligand.

The elemental composition of the synthesized materials was examined by EDX. The EDX spectra of Fe-, Cu-, and Co-doped NiS synthesized at both 200 and 400 °C indicate the presence of only Ni, S, and the respective metal dopant (Fe/Cu/Co) (Fig. S7†). EDX mapping of all the doped NiS samples shows a uniform distribution of the constituent elements (Fig. 4 and 5(e)–(g)). The quantitative elemental compositions of the synthesized particles are presented in Tables 1 and S1.† It can be seen that all experimental values match closely with the theoretical values. These results confirm the successful incorporation of Fe, Cu and Co into the NiS lattices.

3.2. Electrochemical investigations
The choice of the samples to be examined for both supercapacitance and water splitting applications were primarily based on the purity of the NiS phase obtained after doping. As shown in the XRD results, the samples which exhibited pure NiS phases after doping were Co-doped α-NiS, Fe-doped α-NiS, and Fe-doped β-NiS. Since both Fe-doped α-NiS and Fe-doped β-NiS adopted the same crystal phase after doping (α-NiS), only one representative sample was chosen for the analysis (Fe-doped α-NiS synthesized at 200 °C). For comparison purposes, the concentration of the dopants was taken to be 5% as this was the highest dopant concentration possible for Co-doped NiS. For the rest of the samples, which gave a mixture of the α- and β-NiS phases, we also decided to examine one representative sample (NiS doped with 5% Cu at 200 °C). Hence, the electrochemical investigations were carried out for the NiS samples doped with 5% Fe, Cu and Co at 200 °C.

3.2.1. Transition metal doped NiS for supercapacitance applications. 
The electrochemical behavior of the TM-doped NiS samples was determined using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements to understand their electrochemical nature and energy storage capacity. The cyclic voltammetry curves of the NiS samples doped with Cu, Fe, and Co at various scan rates (2–300 mV s−1) are shown in Fig. 6(a)–(c). As seen in the curves, a pair of redox peaks were observed in all the samples, indicating the presence of reversible redox reactions. The redox peaks were observed to shift towards higher potential with an increase in the scan rate suggesting a diffusion-controlled charge-transfer mechanism. The galvanostatic charge–discharge behavior of the doped NiS samples, at various charge–discharge current densities (0.5–30 A g−1), is illustrated in Fig. 6(d)–(f). The observed charge–discharge characteristics are a typical behavior of redox type materials. A longer discharge time is observed for Co-doped NiS, indicating superiority in charge storage capacity. The specific capacitance of NiS based samples using galvanostatic charge–discharge could be calculated using the following equation. (1)where I is the discharge current (A), Δt is the discharge time (s), ΔV is the potential window (V), and m is the mass (g) of NiS samples.

Fig. 7(a)–(c) show the variation of specific capacitance versus applied current density for the TM-doped NiS samples. The best performance was observed for Co-doped NiS which displayed a specific capacitance of 1586 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. NiS doped with Cu and Fe showed a specific capacitance of 1326 and 1314 F g−1 respectively. In all three cases, the specific capacitance was observed to decrease with increasing current density. However, for Co-doped NiS, a specific capacitance of about 1000 F g−1 could still be obtained even at a high current density of 30 A g−1. This implies that, while the capacity decreases with increasing current density, about 63% of the initial capacitance is retained as the current density increases from 0.5 to 30 A g−1. Among all studied samples, NiS doped with Co therefore demonstrated a higher rate capability. Co-based electrodes are known to possess high theoretical specific capacitance values as compared to Fe- and Cu-based electrodes.57–63 The high energy storage capacity of Co-doped NiS could therefore be a result of the high redox nature of cobalt.

The most common type of capacitive enhancement of NiS involves the formation of composites with other active materials such as polymers,64 graphene oxide,65 and metal chalcogenides.9,66 Compared to several other reports, the capacitive values displayed by the TM-doped NiS samples are much higher than those reported for both pristine α-/β-NiS, as well as NiS heterostructures.64,67–69 Moreover, the facile solventless minimal-step synthetic approach employed herein shows its potential in terms of time, cost, and scalability. A detailed comparison of the specific capacitances achieved in this study with those reported for several Ni-based electrodes is shown in Table S2, ESI.† It is also important to mention that, besides transition metal doping, the insulating surfactant free surface also contributes to the enhancement of the capacitive performance. Various reports have indicated that the use of surfactants has a deteriorating effect on catalytic performance. However, the xanthate precursors used in our synthetic method decompose cleanly without contaminating the surfaces of the metal sulfides as the decomposition of xanthates follows the well-known Chugaev elimination reaction.70 The by-products generated (alkene and carbonyl sulfide) are highly volatile and are removed easily leaving behind pure surface respective metal sulfides.46


3.2.2. Transition metal doped NiS for water splitting applications. 
The electrocatalytic properties of the TM-doped NiS samples were studied using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The OER polarization curves of the samples along with the Tafel slopes are shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that Fe doped NiS required the lowest overpotential of 266 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 79 mV dec−1. On the other hand, NiS doped with copper and cobalt required an overpotential of 354 and 339 mV respectively at 10 mA cm−2. The HER polarization curves shown in Fig. 9 indicate that Fe doped NiS still exhibits the lowest overpotential of 146 mV at 10 mA cm−2, with a Tafel slope of 113 mV dec−1. Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that Fe-doping increases the surface roughness, exposes the active sites, and regulates the material electronic structure for an enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting process.36,71,72 Cu-doped NiS with an overpotential of 154 mV and Co-doped NiS with an overpotential of 156 mV, both at 10 mA cm−2, were comparable to Fe-doped NiS for showing a low overpotential for the HER. It can be noted that the orders for overpotentials and Tafel slopes do not correlate. The reason for the observed deviation is not clear at this point. However, there are several other reports where researchers have found similar deviations.73,74 Following the electrocatalytic performance displaced by Fe-doped α-NiS, an electrolyzer employing Fe-doped α-NiS as both the anode and cathode was fabricated and tested. The electrolyzer required an overpotential of about 410 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 which is in good correlation with the overpotential observed for Fe-doped NiS in the OER and HER processes (Fig. S8, ESI†). A comparison of the HER and OER performance observed in this study with other reported Ni-based electrocatalysts is shown in Tables S3 and S4.†

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the electrocatalytic properties of NiS samples at various potentials. Fig. S9(a)–(c)† show the variation of impedance as a function of applied frequency at various applied potentials. As seen in the figure, the impedance of the electrocatalysts decreases with increasing applied potential. It is notable that Fe-doped NiS showed the lowest impedance among the studied samples. The lower impedance at higher potential facilitates the charge transfer, thus improving the electrocatalytic activities. The variation of Zrealvs. Zimag for various transition metal-doped NiS is shown in Fig. S9(d)–(f).† It is observed that the diameter of the semicircle at the higher potential is decreasing, which indicates lower charge-transfer resistance at a higher potential. Compared to other transition metal-doped NiS, Fe-doped NiS showed the lowest charge transfer resistance, indicating higher electro-catalytic activity due to reduced resistance at the interface.
The electrochemical stability of the electrocatalysts was determined using linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry. In Fig. 10, the nature of the polarization curves of Fe-doped NiS was compared after 1000 cycles of polarization study. As seen in the figure, there is no difference in overpotential after 1000 cycles, indicating a highly stable nature of the synthesized Fe-doped NiS electrocatalyst. In addition to stability testing, we have performed a polarization study at bending states to see the flexibility of the prepared electrode. As seen, there is no observable difference in polarization curves after bending. We have also tested the durability of these electrocatalysts using chronoamperometry testing. The variation of current density as a function of time at an overpotential of 387 mV for Cu, Fe, and Co-doped NiS is shown in Fig. 11. As seen, Fe-doped NiS showed the largest current among the studied samples at the same overpotential, which further supports our observation in OER and HER studies. The high electrocatalytic activity of Fe-doped NiS can be attributed to the high electrochemical surface area of the catalyst as shown in Fig. S10, ESI.† The electrochemical double-layer capacitance of the synthesized materials was calculated in the non-redox potential range. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance was estimated by plotting current versus scan rate. The slope of the plot is equal to electrochemical double-layer capacitance. The highest slope observed for Fe-doped NiS confirms its high electrochemical surface area. Furthermore, it is observed that the catalytic activities of Ni-based materials get enhanced after doping with iron due to tuning of the electronic structure.75 Fe atoms can activate Ni centers via partial charge transfer which improves their catalytic activities.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have examined the effect of transition metal dopants (Cu, Fe, and Co) on the crystal structure and electrochemical properties of nickel sulfide (NiS). The synthesis was carried out via an ecofriendly, solventless approach using respective metal ethyl xanthate precursors. Phase pure α-NiS and β-NiS, or a composite of the two phases were obtained by varying the pyrolysis temperature. It was observed that introducing controlled amounts of Fe and Co into the α-NiS phase does not affect the crystal structure or crystallinity of the material, while doping Cu into the same phase induces the formation of the β-NiS phase. In contrast, the inclusion of the cationic dopants in β-NiS favours the formation of the α-NiS phase. SEM analysis of both TM-doped and undoped NiS revealed the synthesis of elongated particles which agglomerate to form quasi-spherical clusters. Electrochemical characterization indicates that Co-doped α-NiS demonstrates superior supercapacitive behavior (1586 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1) and high rate capability. On the other hand, Fe-doped α-NiS exhibited the lowest overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER, and an overpotential of 146 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the HER. We further fabricated an electrolyzer which uses Fe-doped α-NiS as both the anode and cathode, in which an overpotential of 410 mV at 10 mA cm−2 was observed. The synthesized materials therefore show promising potential for supercapacitance and overall water splitting activities.
