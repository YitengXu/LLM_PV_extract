    , Accepted 13th June 2020First published on 16th June 2020AbstractCoupling the piezoelectric effect of piezoelectric semiconductors with the photocatalytic technique is considered as a promising strategy for suppressing the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. A new piezo-photocatalyst, a Rh-doped SrTiO3 inverse opal, was prepared by a hard-template method. Doping of photoactive Rh3+ played a significant role in improving the visible-light response ability and piezo-/photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3. In addition, the introduction of 3D ordered inverse opal structure was favourable for light harvesting. Co-excited by solar energy (visible light) and mechanical energy (ultrasonic vibration), the Rh-doped SrTiO3 inverse opal showed a significantly enhanced degradation rate of bisphenol A, which was 8.9 times higher than that of SrTiO3 nanoparticles under visible light only. The boosted piezo-photocatalytic efficiency was ascribed to the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs under the acceleration of the built-in piezoelectric field in the Rh-SrTiO3 inverse opal, as confirmed by piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM). Therefore, this work provided a new insight into SrTiO3-based piezo-photocatalytic materials for efficient environmental remediation.

Environmental significance
Piezo-photocatalysis is an efficient and environmentally-friendly emerging technology in environmental purification. It simultaneously utilizes solar energy and ultrasonic vibration-derived mechanical energy to remove organic pollutants in water. The built-in electric field caused by the external mechanical vibration effectively promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers. Herein, a new piezo-photocatalyst (Rh-STO IO) with inverse opal structure and rhodium doping was prepared based on the piezoelectric ceramic material, SrTiO3. Noteworthily, Rh doping is beneficial for broadening the absorption range of SrTiO3 to the visible region. In addition, the slow-photon and multiple-scattering effects of the inverse opal structure can enhance light harvesting efficiency, and thus further improve the photocatalytic activity. It was found that the Rh-STO IO had a much higher efficiency than that of SrTiO3 nanoparticles for piezo-photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A. Thus, this work provided a new insight into construction of SrTiO3-based piezo-photocatalysts for efficient and environmentally-friendly purification of water pollutants.

1. Introduction
Recently, semiconductor-based photocatalytic technology has attracted much attention due to the direct conversion of solar energy into chemical energy, so it is expected to solve current environmental problems. However, single-component photocatalysts have some drawbacks such as low efficiency of light absorption and fast recombination rate of photogenerated carriers, which usually result in low photocatalytic activity. Therefore, a series of modification measures, including metal or non-metal element doping,1–3 construction of heterojunctions4–7 and regulation of morphology,8–12 have been developed.
SrTiO3 is an ABO3 type perovskite photocatalytic material with high stability, corrosion resistance, wide distribution, and abundant sources, and is safe, non-toxic and low cost.13 Therefore, it is widely used in photocatalytic environmental purification. In addition, the unique crystal structure of perovskites is helpful in adjusting the band structure to suit different requirements of redox reactions.14 However, SrTiO3 has a low visible light absorption efficiency due to the wide band gap of about 3.2 eV,15 which greatly limits its practical application. Therefore, much effort has been made, including the construction of heterojunctions with narrow band-gap semiconductors,4,16–18 the regulation of micromorphology10,19 and the loading of noble metal cocatalysts.20–24 In order to facilely modify SrTiO3 without introducing a noble metal, a transition metal element containing d-orbital electrons, rhodium (Rh), is doped into the crystal of SrTiO3 to generate an impurity band within the band gap of SrTiO3,2,25 thereby broadening its light response to the visible region and obtaining significantly improved photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, based on our previous work,9,26 the slow photon effect of inverse opal helps to improve photon absorption capability and molecular mass transfer efficiency. Therefore, we hope the unique advantages of inverse opal can synergistically improve the photocatalytic performance of SrTiO3.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to seek for a more effective strategy to reduce the combination of photogenerated carriers and thus greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3. The excellent piezoelectricity of SrTiO3 could be utilized to solve this problem. Piezoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which an electric potential is generated when a piezoelectric material is subjected to external mechanical stress.27–30 This effect has been widely used in many fields, such as sensors, nanogenerators and photodetectors. Meanwhile, coupling the piezoelectric effect of piezoelectric semiconductors with a photocatalytic technique provides a unique strategy for promoting the separation and migration of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.31–34 During piezoelectric-assisted photocatalysis, when a piezoelectric semiconductor with a non-centrosymmetric structure is subjected to external mechanical vibration, the built-in electric field is generated by piezoelectric polarization,35,36 which can effectively accelerate the separation of photoexcited carriers and thus realize highly-efficient photocatalysis of SrTiO3. To date, there are few reports concerned with SrTiO3 for piezoelectric-assisted photocatalytic degradation of emerging pollutants.
In this work, a SrTiO3-based piezo-photocatalyst (Rh-STO IO) with Rh doping and well-ordered 3D structure was synthesized facilely. The unique structure of the inverse opal can improve the light harvesting ability and Rh doping can effectively promote the visible light response of SrTiO3. Moreover, after ultrasonic vibration was applied on Rh-STO IO, the piezoelectric potential was created and the built-in piezoelectric field effectively drove the migration and separation of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs, thus further enhancing the photocatalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 1, the Rh-STO IO was obtained by filling a SrTiO3 precursor containing the Rh element into the gap of the polystyrene opal template before calcination. The piezo-photocatalytic performance of the Rh-STO IO was assessed by piezo-photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) in water. As a raw material widely used in the polymer industry, BPA is usually found in underground water and drinking water, easily causing endocrine disorders. Notably, based on experimental results, this work also proposed a possible mechanism for the piezo-photocatalytic degradation of BPA.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Styrene, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, tetra-n-butyl titanate (TBT) and citric acid were purchased from TCI. Strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2), rhodium trichloride trihydrate (RhCl3·3H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) were obtained from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was purchased from Luoyang Gu-Luo Glass Co., Ltd.
2.2 Characterization
The structure analysis of the prepared material was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, X'Pert-Pro MPD). In order to avoid the influence of instrument errors, the internal standard method was used to correct the positioning of the sample. The standard substance (α-Al2O3 powder, 99.99%) with a weight ratio of 50% was added to the samples due to the minimal overlap between the Al2O3 with a corundum structure and sample peaks. The microscopic morphology of the samples was analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4700). The microstructure of the material was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM). The chemical state and elemental composition of the piezo-photocatalysts were measured by using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB MK II) with Al-Kα radiation. The absorption band edges of all materials were measured by UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis, Shimadzu UV-3600). Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy was performed on a FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Photocurrent spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the synthesized materials were conducted using a three-electrode system of an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, China). Piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) measurements were performed on a Dimension Icon Bruker atomic force microscope (AFM). Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were tested on JEOL JES-X320 for detecting free radicals spin-trapped by DMPO. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1260, USA) was used to analyze the concentration of BPA with the mobile phase composed of a mixture of water/methanol (30:70, V/V). The total organic carbon (TOC) analysis was carried out using a TOC analyzer (TOC-L CPHCN200, Shimadzu). The intermediate products during BPA degradation were detected by LC-MS (MicroQ-TOF, Bruker Daltonics Inc., USA).
2.3 Fabrication of the photocatalyst

2.3.1 Preparation of the SrTiO3 inverse opal (STO IO) and SrTiO3 nanoparticles (STO NPs). 
Monodisperse polystyrene (PS) microspheres with an average diameter of 280 nm were prepared by classical soap-free emulsion polymerization.37 The photonic crystal opal template was prepared by the vertical deposition method. The FTO glass was successively ultrasonicated with acetone, ethanol and deionized water before use. The lyophilized 280 nm PS microsphere powder was dispersed into deionized water to obtain 0.25 wt% monodisperse PS microsphere emulsion. Subsequently the microsphere emulsion was placed into a weighing bottle. Then the conductive side of the clean FTO glass was vertically put into the above weighing bottle. Finally, they were placed in an electrothermal incubator at 45 °C for 48 hours.
The SrTiO3 precursor was fabricated by a sol–gel method. First, 3.4 ml of TBT was added to acetic acid (10 mL), and under continuous stirring, 10 mL deionized water was mixed with the above solution. Thereafter, 10 ml of Sr(NO3)2 aqueous solution (1 M) was added dropwise, and then 2 M citric acid solution (10 mL) was transferred into the above solution with continuous stirring for 30 minutes until it was transparent. The prepared opal template was immersed in the above solution, and then dried at 60 °C. Finally, the dried precursor template was calcined in air at 650 °C for 2 h by 2 °C min−1 to remove PS, after that the SrTiO3 inverse opal (STO IO) was obtained by natural cooling.
For comparison, SrTiO3 nanoparticles (STO NPs) were synthesized through a hydrothermal method. Firstly, TBT (0.01 mol) was added in ethylene glycol (20 mL) to obtain a transparent solution, and then Sr(NO3)2 aqueous solution (20 mL, 0.5 M) and 5 mL NaOH solution (5 M) were added dropwise to the above solution. The mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave for 24 hours at 200 °C after stirring for 30 minutes. The product was washed to adjust the pH to 7 with ethanol and distilled water several times and finally dried overnight at 60 °C to obtain STO NPs.


2.3.2 Preparation of the Rh-SrTiO3 inverse opal (Rh-STO IO). 

x Rh-SrTiO3 inverse opal (Rh-STO IO) (x = 0.3%, 0.5% and 1.0%, x was defined as the molar ratio of Rh element to Sr(NO3)2) was synthesized by using the similar preparation method as above, except the Rh-doped SrTiO3 precursor was prepared by dissolving RhCl3·3H2O into the Sr(NO3)2 aqueous solution by replacing the corresponding amount of TBT.

2.4 Piezo-/photocatalytic performance
The piezo-/photocatalytic performance of the Rh-STO IO was measured based on the piezo-/photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A (BPA). A Xe lamp (300 W) and an ultrasonic cleaner (KQ3200DB, 150 W and 40 kHz) were used as the light source and mechanical energy source, respectively. Firstly, 6 mg of piezo-photocatalyst was dispersed in 10 mL BPA aqueous solution (10 ppm) and then continuously stirred for 60 minutes to achieve an adsorption–desorption equilibrium in the dark. Then the piezo-/photocatalytic experiments were performed by using the 300 W xenon lamp and/or ultrasonic cleaner, and subsequently a suspension (1 mL) was collected every 15 min. At last, the concentration of BPA was determined by HPLC after being filtered using a 0.22 μm membrane. The reaction temperature was always maintained at room temperature throughout the degradation process.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the as-synthesized STO NPs, STO IO and Rh-STO IO

Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the STO NPs, STO IO, and Rh-STO IO with different Rh doping. The characteristic diffraction peaks of the STO NPs, STO IO and Rh-STO IO at 22.77°, 32.43°, 39.99°, 46.50°, 52.29°, 57.79°, 67.82°, and 77.16° correspond to the SrTiO3 (JCPDS #35-0734) (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211), (220) and (310) planes, respectively. Moreover, compared with the pure STO IO, the obtained Rh-STO IOs all show a perfect single-phase cubic perovskite structure. And the XRD pattern reflects that no diffraction peak of Rh oxide is detected, which suggests that a small amount of Rh ions can be well incorporated into the SrTiO3 crystal lattice by substituting some Ti4+ with a similar ionic radius. As shown in Fig. 2b, the (110) crystal plane at 2θ = 32–33° shifts to lower angles as the Rh doping amount increases. According to the proportional relationship presented by the Bragg equation that the diffraction angle decreases with the increase of the lattice constant, and the shift of the diffraction peak is mainly due to the replacement of the small-sized Ti4+ (60.5 pm) in the B site of the perovskite by bigger sized Rh3+ (66.5 pm), resulting in an increase of the unit cell parameters,1,38 as listed in Table 1. Therefore, these results indicate that Rh ions are successfully incorporated into the STO IO. Nevertheless, we can also observe that the 1.0% Rh-STO IO has a smaller lattice parameter than the 0.5% Rh-STO IO. This phenomenon can be explained with the generation of oxygen vacancies. When some Ti4+ in the SrTiO3 crystal lattice is substituted by Rh3+, oxygen vacancies are formed to compensate for the charge and maintain electronic neutrality.39 Then, in order to maintain the perovskite structure, the unit cell shrinks, which leads to smaller lattice parameters.40 In addition, among all the samples, the 0.5% Rh-STO IO sample has the largest lattice parameter, which may be because the substitution of Ti4+ by Rh3+ has a greater effect on the unit cell volume than oxygen vacancy.

The morphology of the STO NPs, STO IO and Rh-STO IO was observed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 3a, STO NPs are mainly composed of irregular nanoparticles. The inset in Fig. 3b is the SEM image of the photonic crystal opal template prepared by self-assembly of 280 nm PS microspheres. It can be seen that the opal template clearly exhibits a dense arrangement and face-centered-cubic (FCC) structure. As shown in Fig. 3(b–d) and S1,† the obtained STO IO and x Rh-STO IO display a highly ordered three-dimensional macroporous structure with a uniform pore size and regular arrangement. The pore size of the STO IO appears to slightly shrink compared to the opal template in the illustration, which may be related to the removal of the PS opal template with calcination. To be sure, the doping of low-concentrated heterogeneous Rh element does not change the microstructure of the inverse opal. The skeleton structure in x Rh-STO IOs looks rougher than that of the pure STO IO, which may provide a more effective reaction site for the photocatalytic reaction. From the measured reflection spectrum of the STO IO (Fig. S2†), the Bragg reflection peak centered at 370 nm is observed, which is consistent with the photonic stop band calculated by the Bragg equation. Therefore, the 280 nm PS microspheres are selected as the template. When the material absorbs photons at the edge of the photonic band gap, the group velocity of photons will be greatly decreased, resulting in the slow photon effect and further improvement of the light absorption ability.8,41

The TEM image of the 0.5% Rh-STO IO in Fig. 4a further reveals the inverse opal structure with overlapping pores. The black part is the periodic skeleton structure of the Rh-STO IO carrier, and the white part is an air hole having an average diameter of 150 ± 10 nm. The HRTEM image (Fig. 4b) shows that the lattice spacing of 0.276 nm measured in the Rh-STO IO corresponds to the (110) plane. Moreover, the pattern shows continuous and identical streaks, indicating high crystallinity. Elemental mapping of the 0.5% Rh-STO IO (Fig. 4c) clearly demonstrates that the Rh element is homogeneously distributed over the framework of the 0.5% Rh-STO IO.

The composition and chemical state of the 0.5% Rh-STO IO were further analyzed by XPS. The XPS survey spectrum is demonstrated in Fig. S3.† As shown in Fig. 5a, the peaks at132.6 eV and 134.3 eV are assigned to Sr 3d5/2 and Sr 3d3/2 of SrTiO3, respectively. The binding energy at 458.1 eV and 463.9 eV in Ti 2p (Fig. 5b) corresponds to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of Ti4+ in the oxide. The spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 5c) shows that the asymmetric peak at 529.4 eV is attributed to O2−. The peak at 531.6 eV is ascribed to O–H bonds derived from Ti–OH and H2O species. In the Rh 3d XPS spectrum (Fig. 5d), the Rh 3d5/2 peak of the 0.3% Rh-STO IO, 0.5% Rh-STO IO, and 1.0% Rh-STO IO samples all show asymmetric peak shapes, and the binding energies are around 307.5 eV and 309.4 eV corresponding to Rh3+ and Rh4+ respectively,42,43 which further confirms that the Rh ion is successfully doped into the SrTiO3 lattice. Moreover, it is confirmed that the photoactive species Rh3+ and photo-inert species Rh4+ all appear on the surface of the Rh-STO IO. According to the peak area, we find that the ratio of Rh3+ to Rh4+ in the 0.5% Rh-STO IO sample is about 1.02, greater than that (0.68) in the 1.0% Rh-STO IO. Therefore, it can be found that as the Rh doping amount continues to increase, the proportion of photoactive species Rh3+ decreases, while the proportion of photo-inert species Rh4+ increases.

3.2 Optical properties and band structure
The light absorption characteristics were measured using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) (Fig. 6a). Compared with STO NPs, the absorption edge of the STO IO exhibits a red shift, which may be ascribed to the slow photon effect of the inverse opal increasing the intensity of light harvesting. The Rh-STO IO responds better to visible light than the STO IO, and as the Rh content increased, a red shift for the absorption edge is observed. Compared to the STO IO, the Rh-STO IO has an obvious absorption band with an onset at approximately 500 nm assigned to the electron transition from the donor level formed with Rh3+ 4d t2g orbital to the conduction band of SrTiO3. In addition, the absorption peak around 580 nm and absorption tail extending to 650 nm arise from transition of the SrTiO3 valence band to an unoccupied d state of Rh4+.44,45 This result means that Rh3+ is successfully doped into the SrTiO3 crystals, which also corresponds with the XPS characterization results of the Rh-STO IO. The band gaps were calculated using the Tauc equation according to the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra. The band gaps of the STO NPs, STO IO and 0.5% Rh-STO IO are estimated as 3.23, 3.15 and 2.30 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b), which means that Rh doping can obtain narrow band gaps. These results show that the trace amounts of Rh doping and slow photon effect can synergistically achieve suitable band gaps and high visible-light harvesting ability, thus improving the photocatalytic activity of the Rh-STO IO.
 Fig. 6  (a) UV-vis DRS, (b) Tauc plots, (c) PL emission spectra of the STO NPs, STO IO and Rh-STO IO, and (d) valence-band XPS spectra of the STO IO and Rh-STO IO. 
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the separation efficiency of photo-induced charge carriers. The lower the intensity of the fluorescence emission spectrum peak, the lower the recombination efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. All samples were measured under an excitation wavelength of λ = 250 nm. As shown in Fig. 6c, compared with STO NPs, the STO IO has a lower emission peak at the center of approximately 410 nm, indicating that the macroporous structure of the inverse opal can inhibit the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. For the Rh-STO IO samples, as the Rh content increases, the PL intensity decreases. However, compared to the 0.3% Rh-STO IO and 1.0% Rh-STO IO, the 0.5% Rh-STO IO has the lowest photoluminescence intensity, indicating that it can effectively inhibit the recombination of photoexcited charge carriers. To further study the energy band structure, we collected the XPS valence band (VB) spectra (Fig. 6d) of the STO IO and Rh-STO IO. The valence bands of the STO and Rh-STO IO are located at 2.54 and 1.69 eV, respectively. The analysis demonstrates a new impurity level, namely a new Rh 4d gap state, is inserted into the band gap of the STO IO, which indicates that the band structure of the Rh-STO IO becomes narrow due to the new Rh 4d VB.
3.3 Photoelectrochemical properties
In order to evaluate the photoelectrochemical performance of different samples, the photocurrent density measurements of the STO NPs, STO IO, and Rh-STO IO were carried out (Fig. 7a). The higher the photocurrent density, the more photogenerated electrons pass through the circuit under visible light. In comparison to STO NPs, the STO IO has a higher photocurrent density, which means that the introduction of inverse opal structure can improve the sample's ability to capture photons and thus enhance the absorption of light, resulting in an increased photocurrent. Compared with the STO IO, the Rh-STO IO has higher photocurrent density, which indicates that the synergistic effect of Rh doping and photonic crystals can significantly improve the photoelectrochemical performance of SrTiO3 samples.
 Fig. 7  (a) Photocurrent response and (b) EIS analysis of the STO NPs, STO IO and Rh-STO IO. 
In addition, different doping amounts have a significant effect on the photoelectrochemical performance of the STO IO, as shown in Fig. 7a. As the amount of Rh doping increases, the photocurrent density also increases, with the 0.5% Rh-STO IO having the highest photocurrent density. But, as the doping amount of Rh continuously increases, the photocurrent density decreases, which is due to an increase in the proportion of the photoinert species Rh4+ known from the XPS spectra.
In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to analyze the separation rate of electron–hole pairs. As shown in Fig. 7b, a smaller arc is observed in the 0.5% Rh-STO IO sample compared to the other samples. The interface charge transfer resistance is significantly decreased, suggesting the fastest migration rate of charge carriers in the 0.5% Rh-STO IO. Therefore, the above results indicate that the 0.5% Rh-STO IO has the highest photocatalytic activity. In general, the tendency of the photocurrent density and EIS over all as-prepared samples is in agreement with the PL analysis.
3.4 Piezoelectric property
As the basis of piezoelectric photocatalysis, the piezoelectricity of the Rh-STO IO was investigated by piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) and contact mode topographic analysis. The PFM topography image of Fig. 8a shows a clear ordered macropore morphology of the Rh-STO IO, consistent with the SEM image. The corresponding piezoelectric amplitude response image is obtained as shown in Fig. 8b and a significant line profile of the 0.5% Rh-STO IO skeleton is observed, indicating that the piezoelectric response is prominently located at the skeleton of the inverse opal.46 The piezoelectric response of the local point is investigated at a bias voltage. When a bias of ±10 V is applied to the 0.5% Rh-STO IO sample, a typical amplitude–voltage loop is observed in the PFM amplitude signal diagram, as shown in Fig. 8(c and d). Meanwhile, when the DC voltage is swept from −10 V to +10 V, the phase suddenly changes from −50° to 130°. The results show that the Rh-STO IO has good piezoelectric performance with the assistance of an external force.29,47 PFM of the non-piezoelectric P25 was performed for comparison (Fig. S4†). From the amplitude image, we can see that P25 has no obvious amplitude response profile, and no typical hysteresis loop and butterfly line are observed.

3.5 Piezo-/photocatalytic activity
The BPA degradation experiments of the STO NPs, STO IO and 0.5% Rh-STO IO were conducted under different catalytic conditions, such as (i) visible light irradiation, (ii) ultrasonic vibration and (iii) ultrasonic-assisted visible light irradiation. Only under visible light irradiation (Fig. 9a) for 60 min, the 0.5% Rh-STO IO shows the best BPA degradation efficiency (77%), further confirming that the synergistic effect of a small amount of photoactive species Rh3+ doping acting as a medium for interfacial charge migration48 and the slow photon effect of the inverse opal can notably improve the photocatalytic efficiency of SrTiO3. The influence of different catalytic conditions on the degradation efficiency of BPA is further explored by changing the catalytic conditions. When only the ultrasonic vibration condition is employed (Fig. 9b), the degradation efficiency of the SrTiO3 sample is much higher than that under visible light irradiation, and the 0.5% Rh-STO IO almost completely removes BPA within 30 min. Fig. 9c shows that the piezo-photocatalytic process has the best degradation activity compared to the pure piezoelectric or the pure photocatalytic process. Moreover, the 0.5% Rh-STO IO shows an optimal piezo-photodegradation rate of 98.3% within 15 min for low concentration BPA (10 mg L−1), which is 8.9 times higher than that of STO NPs under the photocatalytic process. And it is also superior to the reported SrTiO3-based photocatalysts (Table S1†). BPA solution during the piezo-photocatalytic degradation was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. S5†) over the 0.5% Rh-STO IO sample. Meanwhile, total organic carbon (TOC) was determined to investigate the mineralization efficiency of BPA (Fig. S8†). The intermediates generated from the piezo-photodegradation of BPA were detected by LC-MS. As shown in Fig. S9,† four intermediates (m/z 133, 135, 109 and 143) were identified. Consequently, the mechanical vibration caused by the ultrasonic cleaner plays a significant role in piezo-photocatalysis. External ultrasonic power causes easy deformation of the piezoelectric material, thereby inducing an extra piezoelectric potential to suppress the combination of photogenerated carriers.49 In addition, Rh3+ ions work as charge carrier (electron or hole) traps to provide more free charges for the piezoelectric field, further improving the piezoelectric catalytic activity.48,50Fig. 9d shows the comparison of the reaction rate constant k of the prepared samples against BPA degradation processes under different catalytic conditions (the slopes of the ln(C0/C) − t fitting curves derived from the pseudo-first-order kinetics, Fig. S6†). The 0.5% Rh-STO IO under the piezoelectric-assisted photocatalytic condition shows the highest k value, which is nearly 12 times higher than that under photocatalysis.

(d) Comparison of the degradation rate constant k under three kinds of catalytic conditions. 
Fig. S6(a)† shows that among all the as-synthesized samples, the 0.5% Rh-STO IO exhibits the best degradation efficiency on the piezoelectric-assisted photo-oxidation of BPA. However, excess Rh doping concentration (increased to 1.0%) results in a decrease of the piezo-photocatalytic performance, which is attributed to an increase in the amount of photo-inert species Rh4+ acting as recombination centers of photogenerated charge carries.44
3.6 Possible piezo-photocatalytic mechanism
To explore the piezo-photocatalytic mechanism more deeply, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA-2Na) as a hole (h+) trapping agent, 1 mM p-benzoquinone (BQ) as a superoxide radical (˙O2−) capture agent and 1 mM t-butanol (TBA) as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), respectively, were introduced into the reaction under the catalytic conditions of ultrasonic-assisted visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 10a, BQ has a significant inhibitory effect on the piezo-photocatalytic oxidation process and the removal efficiency of BPA is significantly reduced to 26% within 60 min. After EDTA-2Na is added, the degradation efficiency of BPA is decreased to some extent (58%), while there is only a slight inhibition by the supplementation of the hydroxyl radical scavenger (TBA). These results suggest that ˙O2− is the major active species in the piezo-photocatalysis of the Rh-STO IO for BPA degradation. ESR was carried out to detect the superoxide radical signal of the 0.5% Rh-STO IO (Fig. 10b). The characteristic quadruple peak of DMPO–˙O2− with an intensity ratio of 1:1:1:1 indicates the production of ˙O2−.

To explain the SrTiO3-based catalyst having higher catalytic performance for BPA degradation under ultrasonic vibration, the plausible mechanism of free carrier transfer is specified in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  Schematic diagram of the piezoelectric-catalytic mechanism under ultrasonic vibration: (a) free carriers (electrons and holes) within the Rh-SrTiO3 catalyst are not subject to external mechanical-vibration force; (b) due to the piezoelectric polarization, free electrons and holes are attracted to transfer in opposite directions (dotted arrows); (c) the driving force for free charge transfer is suppressed because of the new balance between polarization charges and surface charges; and (d) free carriers transfer reversely along the solid arrow direction as the decrease in the polarization electric field. 
As depicted in Fig. 11a, free electrons and holes within the semiconductor can be excited at above 0 K by thermal emission.51Fig. 11b represents that when Rh-SrTiO3 is subjected to the external pressure under ultrasound vibration, the piezoelectric polarization of Rh-SrTiO3 is introduced, leading to the formation of the built-in electric field. This polarization field drives the free carriers to migrate towards opposite directions (dotted arrows), directly reacting with dissolved O2 and BPA to yield reactive ˙O2− radicals and degradation products, respectively. As shown in Fig. 11c, when the intensity of the electric field created by the surface charges is high enough to balance the built-in electric field, the driving force for free charge transfer will be suppressed due to the potential equilibrium. However, the intensity of the polarization electric field decreases as the pressure decreases, resulting in reverse migration (solid arrows) of free carriers to react with O2 and BPA, as shown in Fig. 11d.46,51 Notably, the free carriers consumed by the catalytic process are regenerated thermally after absorbing the mechanical-vibration energy, which further contributed to the catalytic oxidation of BPA. Therefore, even in the dark, the catalytic performance for BPA degradation under ultrasonic vibration is much higher than that under visible light irradiation due to the efficient transfer of free carries.
Combined with the previous characterization data, the mechanism of the piezo-photocatalytic degradation by the 0.5% Rh-STO IO is proposed. As displayed in Fig. 6a and 12, the transition metal element Rh3+ containing d orbital electrons is doped into the crystal lattice of perovskite SrTiO3, influencing the electronic structure and optical properties. A narrow band gap is realized by using the Rh 4d orbital level as a new valence band. Rh3+ ions acting as electron (or hole) traps can provide more free charges for the piezoelectric field, therefore under ultrasonic vibration in the absence of visible light, the 0.5% Rh-STO IO also exhibited higher piezo-catalytic performance toward BPA degradation than that of the STO IO.50
 Fig. 12  Schematic diagram of the piezo-photocatalytic degradation mechanism over the 0.5% Rh STO IO. 
When the 0.5% Rh-STO IO is irradiated by visible light, the light utilization efficiency can be further enhanced because the inverse opal structure has a unique slow photon effect and the incident light produces multiple scattering effects in its 3D ordered structure. Meanwhile, when the incident photons are absorbed by the Rh-STO IO, the photoexcitation process is realized by exciting the electron of the Rh 4d orbital to the conduction band (CB) made of Ti 3d to generate photogenerated electron–hole pairs. These modifications will lead to more free carriers within the SrTiO3 nanomaterials. Then, the high-voltage field caused by ultrasonic vibration will induce the piezoelectric polarization of the Rh-STO IO and thus generate a built-in electric field. This internal electric field will bend the energy band to attract photogenerated electrons and holes to migrate in the opposite direction (dotted arrows) to the surface of the catalyst, participating in the catalytic reaction and forming active species. These polar species can be adsorbed on macro-pores of the inverse opal. Since the conduction band (CB) potential of the Rh-STO IO (−0.61 eV, vs. NHE) is more negative than the potential of O2/˙O2− (−0.33 eV, vs. NHE), the electrons can react with dissolved oxygen molecules in water, forming ˙O2− to oxidize BPA into oxidation products.52,53 Holes generated by the Rh-STO IO valence band can directly degrade BPA adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst into small molecules, further separating photogenerated carriers and ultimately achieving high efficiency of photocatalytic activity.54,55 Therefore, the internal electric field induced by the piezoelectric polarization from the Rh-STO IO is responsible for the free carrier separation for the degradation of BPA.56 The corresponding piezo-photodegradation process is as follows: Rh-STO IO + hν & ultrasonic → Rh-STO IO (e−) + Rh-STO IO (h+)(1) e− + O2 → ˙O2−(2) h+/˙O2− + BPA → degraded products(3)
4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel 3D well-ordered Rh-doped SrTiO3 inverse opal (Rh-STO IO) with boosted piezo-photocatalytic activity is fabricated and the piezo-photocatalytic degradation mechanism is proposed. Compared with pristine SrTiO3 nanoparticles (STO NPs), the 0.5% Rh-doped STO IO has the optimal degradation efficiency for low-concentration BPA, which is 8.9 times higher than that of STO NPs under light irradiation only. The slow photon effect and multiple scattering effect of the inverse opal structure benefits the light harvesting ability of SrTiO3. The doping of photoactive species Rh3+ can not only broaden the light response range to the visible light region, but also accelerate the transfer of surface charges as a medium for charge migration to promote the improvement of piezo-/photocatalytic performance. Moreover, the built-in electric field established by SrTiO3 under piezo-photocatalysis jointly promotes the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and effectively enhances the photocatalytic activity. Taking into account the advantages of high efficiency and environmental friendliness, Rh-SrTiO3 IO is expected to be further used in the field of piezo-photocatalysis for environmental remediation.

Environmental significance
Piezo-photocatalysis is an efficient and environmentally-friendly emerging technology in environmental purification. It simultaneously utilizes solar energy and ultrasonic vibration-derived mechanical energy to remove organic pollutants in water. The built-in electric field caused by the external mechanical vibration effectively promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers. Herein, a new piezo-photocatalyst (Rh-STO IO) with inverse opal structure and rhodium doping was prepared based on the piezoelectric ceramic material, SrTiO3. Noteworthily, Rh doping is beneficial for broadening the absorption range of SrTiO3 to the visible region. In addition, the slow-photon and multiple-scattering effects of the inverse opal structure can enhance light harvesting efficiency, and thus further improve the photocatalytic activity. It was found that the Rh-STO IO had a much higher efficiency than that of SrTiO3 nanoparticles for piezo-photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A. Thus, this work provided a new insight into construction of SrTiO3-based piezo-photocatalysts for efficient and environmentally-friendly purification of water pollutants.

 	Fig. 9  Piezo-/photocatalytic BPA degradation activity of the STO NPs, STO IO and 0.5% Rh-STO IO under different conditions: (a) visible light only, (b) ultrasonic vibration only, and (c) ultrasonic-assisted visible light irradiation. (d) Comparison of the degradation rate constant k under three kinds of catalytic conditions.	 

 	Fig. 10  (a) Effect of scavengers on piezo-photocatalytic BPA degradation and (b) ESR spectrum of the 0.5% Rh-STO IO over DMPO–˙O2−.	 

 	Fig. 11  Schematic diagram of the piezoelectric-catalytic mechanism under ultrasonic vibration: (a) free carriers (electrons and holes) within the Rh-SrTiO3 catalyst are not subject to external mechanical-vibration force; (b) due to the piezoelectric polarization, free electrons and holes are attracted to transfer in opposite directions (dotted arrows); (c) the driving force for free charge transfer is suppressed because of the new balance between polarization charges and surface charges; and (d) free carriers transfer reversely along the solid arrow direction as the decrease in the polarization electric field.	 

 	Fig. 12  Schematic diagram of the piezo-photocatalytic degradation mechanism over the 0.5% Rh STO IO.	 
Rh-STO IO + hν & ultrasonic → Rh-STO IO (e−) + Rh-STO IO (h+)	(1)
e− + O2 → ˙O2−	(2)
h+/˙O2− + BPA → degraded products	(3)
