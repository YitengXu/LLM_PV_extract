    , Accepted 17th June 2021First published on 17th June 2021AbstractUtilizing solar energy as a sustainable means of controlling the nitrogen pollutant is proposed. The photochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3−) to dinitrogen (N2) without using chemical reductants is an ideal solution but difficult to be realized. Here we demonstrate a successful case of solar denitrification (with 0.1–10 mM nitrate) coupled with in situ water splitting (without chemical reductants) by developing a ternary composite photocatalyst composed of TiO2, Cu–Pd bimetals, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2). Direct transformation of NO3− to N2 occurs on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2via using in situ H2 generated from water splitting in a broader pH range with achieving near 100% conversion and selectivity to N2 while it is not possible at all with rGO/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/TiO2. The unique activity is ascribed to the synergic action of Cu as a co-catalyst for nitrate-to-nitrite conversion, Pd for nitrite-to-dinitrogen conversion, and rGO for the enhanced charge separation/transfer and H2 production. The combined roles of Cu–Pd and rGO in retarding the charge recombination and accelerating the electron transfer from TiO2 to NO3− are confirmed by monitoring the time-resolved photoluminescence and slurry-type photocurrent generation, respectively. The in situ water splitting on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 was confirmed by the concurrent H2 and O2 evolution and the in situ generated H2 was immediately consumed in the presence of nitrate. The introduction of rGO enabled the denitrification even under visible light (up to 450 nm) and the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of N2 production reached a maximum of 4.9% at 320 nm. The proposed composite photocatalytic system realizes the selective solar conversion for chemical reductant-free denitrification (nitrate to N2) by coupling nitrate reduction and water oxidation.

Broader context
Nitrate is a ubiquitous aquatic pollutant that cannot be easily controlled and the imbalance between the anthropogenic discharge and the natural removal in the global nitrogen cycle causes the accumulation of nitrate in the environment. Solar photocatalytic reduction of recalcitrant nitrate has attracted interest as a potential controlling method but achieving high efficiency and selectivity to N2 without generating harmful byproducts such as nitrite and ammonium is still a challenging issue. Although cocatalyst-loaded photocatalysts for nitrate removal have been frequently reported, they need the addition of reducing reagents such as organic compounds and H2, which limits their practical applications. This work is the first successful demonstration that combines photocatalytic denitrification and water splitting in a single photocatalytic system, which utilizes in situ generated H2 as a reductant of nitrate. TiO2 modified with a bimetallic cocatalyst (Cu–Pd) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is designed as a special-purpose photocatalyst to enable the direct conversion of nitrate to N2 without requiring chemical reductants. The overall mechanism of the ternary-composite (Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2) photocatalytic denitrification system works through the synergic action of Cu as an active catalytic site for nitrate-to-nitrite conversion, Pd for nitrite-to-dinitrogen conversion and H2 production, and rGO facilitating the interfacial charge transfer and H2 production. The proposed solar denitrification system provides a model that combines “environmental photocatalysis” (denitrification) with “energy photocatalysis” (H2 production via water splitting) in a sustainable way.

Introduction
Nitrogen in the environment is cycled in the form of various chemical species via nitrogen fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. Among these, denitrification is an essential process that converts nitrate (NO3−), which is considered as one of the major aquatic pollutants causing eutrophication, to harmless dinitrogen (N2) with returning nitrogen to the atmosphere.1–3 Due to its stability and non-adsorbing properties, the efficient removal of nitrate in water has been a challenging issue.4 Among many biological and physicochemical methods (e.g., reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and (electro)catalysis) for the removal of NO3− in water,5,6 heterogeneous catalysis using bimetallic species loaded on metal oxide supports (e.g., Cu–Pd/Al2O3,7 Sn–Pd/Al2O3,8 and In–Pd/SiO29) has been extensively investigated due to its advantages such as higher selectivity to N2 with suppressed byproduct generation and facile control of catalyst active sites.10,11 The bimetal components are needed as a promoter metal (Cu, Sn, or In) and a hydrogenation metal (Pd or Pt) because Pd alone cannot fully reduce NO3− to N2.10,12 The role of the promoter metal is to initiate the reduction of NO3− to nitrite (NO2−),3,9,12 which is further converted to N2 by catalytic reactions on the surface of the hydrogenation metal under the continuous supply of H2 gas as a reducing agent.13 During the catalytic conversion process, byproducts such as NO2− and ammonium (NH4+) might be generated.12,14,15 In particular, the excessive amount of H2 can induce over-reduction of NO3− to NH4+ and handling H2 gas may cause a safety problem.13–17 Therefore, the need of continuous H2 flow limits large-scale and economical operation.18 From the engineering point of view, an ideal conversion system that reduces NO3− to N2 without requiring an external reductant and generating unwanted byproducts (e.g., NO2− and NH4+) is highly desired.
The solar photo(electro)catalytic process can be a promising alternative to the conventional catalytic system owing to its economical and ecofriendly merits.19–24 Denitrification can be also carried out by photo(electro)catalysis, but the typical photocatalytic denitrification systems also require the introduction of electron donors (e.g., formic acid, methanol, and H2 gas)25,26 like the catalytic denitrification and generate a significant amount of toxic NO2− as a final product even in the presence of electron donors,27,28 which should limit its practical applications (see Table 1).

A possible strategy that allows photocatalytic denitrification without an external reductant is to combine it with water oxidation to provide electrons and protons that are required for the reduction of nitrate (eqn (1)–(3)). Alternatively, H2 generated via in situ water splitting may serve as a reductant of nitrate (eqn (4) and (5)). 2NO3− + 12H+ + 10e− → N2 + 6H2O(1) 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−(2) 2NO3− + 2H+ → N2 + H2O + 2.5O2 (ΔG° = 14.5 kJ mol−1)(3) 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−(4) 2NO3− + 2H+ + 5H2 → N2 + 6H2O (ΔG° = −1200 kJ mol−1)(5)
In this work, we developed a hybrid photocatalyst that successfully transforms NO3− to N2 quantitatively with the generation of little byproducts in the absence of externally added electron donors, which is the first and clear demonstration of direct solar denitrification to our knowledge. The prepared photocatalyst is a modified TiO2 composite (Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2) on which a Cu–Pd bimetallic co-catalyst and rGO are loaded together. It is proposed that the synergic action of three components in Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 enables the generation of in situ H2 through water splitting, which is immediately utilized in the catalytic transformation of NO3− → N2 under irradiation. The unique mechanisms and experimental parameters affecting the overall process are discussed in detail.
Experimental
Chemicals and catalyst preparation

Preparation of rGO and rGO/TiO2. 
Graphite oxide was prepared through oxidizing natural graphite (SP-1 grade 200 mesh, Bay Carbon Inc.) to graphite oxide using a modified Hummers’ method.33,34 A specific amount of graphite oxide was exfoliated into single-layered graphene oxide (GO) in water (200 mL) by sonication (JAC 4020, 400 W, Sonic) for 1 h. Four hundred microliters of ammonia solution (Samchun chemicals, 28–30%) and 10 μL of hydrazine hydrate (Aldrich) per mg of GO were added in the GO-dispersed solution to increase the pH and to reduce GO, respectively. The solution was heated up to 95 °C with a reflux condenser and kept for 2 h under slow stirring using a glass-encased magnetic stir bar to prohibit the aggregation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) itself. The solution was cooled down to room temperature and then TiO2 powder (P25) was added. To disperse the TiO2 powder, the solution was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath, and then 4–10 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid was rapidly injected under fast agitation. The precipitated rGO/TiO2 composite was washed with water until the pH of the washed solution became neutral, dried at room temperature, and treated at 200 °C under an argon gas flow.


Metal deposited TiO2. 
M/TiO2 (M = Cu, Pd, and Cu–Pd) or Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 was prepared using an in situ photodeposition method.35 CuCl2 (Aldrich) and PdCl2 (Aldrich) were used as metal precursors. TiO2 (P25) or rGO/TiO2 was suspended in an aqueous solution containing methanol (4%, v/v) and a calculated amount of metal precursor and then was irradiated under UV light for 1 h using a 300-W mercury lamp.


Preparation of rGO/Cu–Pd/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/CNT/TiO2. 
To be compared with Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2, rGO/Cu–Pd/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/CNT/TiO2 were also prepared as control samples. As for rGO/Cu–Pd/TiO2, Cu–Pd/TiO2 was first prepared and then Cu–Pd/TiO2 powder was added to rGO solution. The precipitated rGO/Cu–Pd/TiO2 composite was washed with water until the pH of the washed solution became neutral, dried at room temperature, and treated at 200 °C under an argon gas flow.
As for Cu–Pd/CNT/TiO2, raw multiwall CNTs (9.5 nm in diameter, 1.5 μm in length, Aldrich) were dispersed in 75 mL nitric acid (65–68%) and sonicated overnight. The solution was then heated in a thermostatic water bath at 75 °C for 5 h. After the solution was cooled down to room temperature, TiO2 powder was added. To disperse the TiO2 powder, the solution was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h. The CNT/TiO2 composite was thoroughly washed with water, dried at room temperature, and treated at 200 °C under an argon gas flow. Cu and Pd metals were co-deposited by the aforementioned process.

Photoreactions
A quartz reactor (55.7 mL) was used for photocatalytic reactions. An appropriate amount of catalyst (1.5 g L−1) was dispersed in deionized water and an aliquot of nitrate stock solution was subsequently added to the suspension (total 30 mL) to give an initial nitrate concentration. The solution was then sonicated for 1 min. The reactor was sealed with a rubber septum and Ar gas was purged through the rubber septum for 30 min before irradiation. The irradiation from a 300 W xenon arc lamp (Oriel) was filtered using a long-pass filter (λ > 320 nm) and a 10 cm IR water filter, and then focused onto the reactor. Sample aliquots were withdrawn using a 1 mL syringe intermittently during the photoreaction, and the catalyst was filtered before the analysis. The analysis of NO3−, NO2−, and NH4+ was performed using an ion chromatograph (IC a Dionex DX-120) equipped with a conductivity detector and an AS-14 column for anions and a CS-14 column for cations. Total nitrogen (TN) was measured using TN reagent kits (Hach, Loveland, CA). For recycling tests of the photocatalyst, the suspension was filtered to recover the catalyst after reaction. The collected catalyst was washed and then re-dispersed in a fresh substrate solution for the following cycle. This procedure was repeated up to 20 cycles to test the durability of the photocatalyst. Photocatalytic production of H2 and N2 was also analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 5 Å molecular sieve column. Argon was used as a carrier gas. For the isotope experiment, 15NO3− (Aldrich) was added to the suspension to adjust the initial concentration of nitrate. GC-MS (Shimadzu, Nexis GC-2030) analysis was conducted to detect 15N2 photogenerated on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2. Gaseous samples were collected from the headspace (25.7 mL) of the reactor using a gas-tight syringe and then injected manually into the GC to analyze H2 and N2.
The selectivity and conversion were calculated using the following equations: Conversion (%) = ([NO3−]0 − [NO3−]t)/[NO3−]0 × 100(6) Selectivity (%) = 2[N2]/([NO3−]0 − [NO3−]t) × 100(7)
To calculate the quantum yields of the photoreactions, the experiments were performed in a quartz cuvette cell (3 mL) sealed with a rubber septum. The Xe-lamp light was filtered and adjusted at a specific wavelength using a monochromator (Newport, Oriel 77250). Because the monochromatic light intensity was much lower than the polychromatic irradiation, the photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a small quartz cuvette. The cuvette reactor was purged with Ar through the rubber septum before irradiation for 5 min. The amount of gaseous N2 produced from the 10 h photoreaction was collected using a gas-tight syringe from the headspace of the cuvette. The other procedure was similar to the aforementioned experimental process. The incident light intensity was measured using a low-power detector (Newport, 818-UV), and was determined to be 1.20 mW cm−2. The apparent quantum yields (AQY) for N2 formation are calculated through the equation: AQYN2 (%) = ((no. of produced N2 molecules) × 10)/(no. of incident photons) × 100(8)
Characterization
To estimate the amount of photodeposited Cu and Pd, the residual amounts of Cu and Pd ions after photodeposition were measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES-6300-Thermo Scientific). The residual concentration of each metal precursor ion after 1 h photodeposition was negligible, which indicated that each metal precursor was quantitatively deposited on TiO2 and rGO/TiO2. The rGO hybridized catalyst sample was characterized by high-resolution (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (HR-(S)TEM) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) on a JEM-2200FS microscope with Cs correction. The surface morphologies of bare TiO2 and rGO/TiO2 were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Veeco DI dimension 3100 with Nanoscope V) in the tapping mode. Raman measurements were carried out with a Renishaw inVia microRaman system. Samples were excited using a 520 nm He–Ne laser. The zeta potentials of the rGO colloid, TiO2, Cu–Pd/TiO2, and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 in aqueous suspensions were measured as a function of pH in the presence of NaNO3 (0.1 mM) using an electrophoretic light-scattering spectrophotometer (ELS 8000, Otsuka). Diffuse reflectance UV/visible absorption spectra (DR-UVS) were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 with an integrating sphere attachment. The static photoemission spectra were obtained using a spectrofluorometer (HORIBA FluoroMax-4). The surface chemical species were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a Theta Prove AR-XPS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.K.) using monochromated Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI) Busan center.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Two types of photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements (electrode-type and slurry-type) were carried out in a conventional three-electrode PEC reactor (a Pyrex cell with a quartz window) connected to a potentiostat (Gamry, Reference 600). For the electrode-type PEC experiments, catalyst-coated electrodes were prepared by a doctor blading method. Catalyst powder (0.15 g) was ground for 15 min with 1 mL ethanol. The mixture was annexed onto an FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC8) with an electrode area of 1.5 × 1 cm. The electrode was annealed in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for an hour with a ramping rate of 5 °C per min under an ambient atmosphere. The PEC tests were carried out using a catalyst-loaded electrode, a coiled Pt wire, and a Ag/AgCl electrode as a working, a counter, and a reference electrode, respectively, in an aqueous electrolyte of 0.1 M NaClO4 with an applied potential of +0.7 V under UV irradiation (λ > 320 nm). Ar gas was continuously purged into the reactor.
The slurry-type photocurrent collection experiments were carried out using a Pt collector electrode and electron shuttles (a reversible redox couple of Fe3+/Fe2+) in an aqueous suspension of catalysts under UV light irradiation and continuous stirring. Coiled Pt, a graphite rod, and a Ag/AgCl electrode were employed as a working, a counter, and a reference electrode, respectively. The Pt electrode was biased with an applied potential of +0.7 V during the measurements.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed at a potential of +0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, NaClO4 0.1 M) with an AC voltage of 10 mV RMS; the frequency ranged from 0.1 MHz to 0.1 Hz.
Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement
Catalyst-coated FTO glass plates were prepared by a doctor blading method by following a similar procedure to the electrode preparation. Catalyst powder (0.1 g) was ground for 15 min with 0.5 mL ethanol. The mixture was annexed onto the FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC8) with an area of 2 × 1 cm. The glasses were annealed in a muffle furnace at 180 °C for an hour with a ramping rate of 5 °C per min under an ambient atmosphere. TRPL was measured using a Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent, Chameleon) and a high-throughput TCSPC controller (Picoquant, PicoHarp300). TRPL decays were excited at 400 nm and monitored at 420–600 nm.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the composite photocatalysts
rGO/TiO2 was characterized by AFM for its surface morphology (Fig. S1, ESI†). The surface of rGO/TiO2 is much smoother than that of bare TiO2, which might be attributed to the presence of the rGO layer covering on TiO2 nanoparticles.36,37 Metal nanoparticles (Cu and Pd) were photodeposited on the surface of bare TiO2 or rGO/TiO2 (see the Experimental section for details). The Cu–Pd(1 wt%, 1 wt%)/rGO(1 wt%)/TiO2 hybridized catalyst was selected for detailed characterization because this catalyst composition showed the highest photocatalytic activity among the prepared catalysts. The preparation of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 is briefly illustrated in Fig. 1a. HRTEM (high-resolution TEM) images and the elemental mapping images obtained with EFTEM (energy-filtered TEM) of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 1b–d. The elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 1b) shows that the surface of TiO2 has even distribution of Cu, Pd and rGO and the metal nanoparticles (Cu and Pd) were well deposited on rGO/TiO2. This confirmed that the Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 ternary composite was successfully fabricated. The elemental carbon was shown to fully cover the Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 particles. The average sizes of Cu and Pd particles on rGO/TiO2 were 2.5 nm and 3.4 nm, respectively (Fig. 1e). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns of Cu and Pd deposited on TiO2 and rGO/TiO2 were obtained and further compared (Fig. 1c and d). The crystalline-plane distances in Cu and Pd nanoparticles loaded on TiO2 and rGO/TiO2 were 0.21 nm and 0.22 nm, which correspond to Cu(111) and Pd(111) lattice spacing, respectively.38–40 The characteristics of bimetallic nanoparticles loaded on TiO2 and rGO/TiO2 were the same and little affected by the presence of rGO.

(f) Raman spectra of rGO and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 in the 1200–1700 cm−1 region. 
The existence of the rGO layer on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 was confirmed by Raman analysis (Fig. 1f), which clearly shows two prominent peaks of graphene at about 1355 cm−1 (D band) and 1600 cm−1 (G band).41,42 To identify whether Cu and Pd were deposited in the alloyed or non-alloyed form, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained along the Pd [0 −1 1] direction with an interplanar distance of 0.22 nm for the (111) planes of face centered cubic (fcc) Pd (Fig. 2a and b).43 As shown in Fig. 2c, the FFT image of the Pd octahedrons exhibited the expected (111) facets as a single crystal, indicating that Cu and Pd particles were independently deposited on rGO/TiO2 as the non-alloyed form. The elemental mapping images of Pd particles demonstrated no trace of Cu in Pd particles, which indicates that the deposition of Cu and Pd did not form an alloy on the rGO matrix (Fig. 2d). In HAADF-STEM analysis, the signal intensity of the heavier atom (ZPd = 46) is dominant over that of the lighter atom (ZCu = 29), which makes it technically difficult to detect Cu in the presence of Pd. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data are consistent with HAADF-STEM images, showing no alloyed forms of Cu and Pd metals in rGO/TiO2 and no damage to crystallinity of TiO2 after the loading rGO and Cu–Pd (Fig. S2, ESI†). Note that previous studies showed that non-alloyed bimetals have higher catalytic activities than alloyed bimetallic catalysts.5,44

Selective photoconversion of nitrate to dinitrogen on the ternary composite
To evaluate the photocatalytic activities of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2, the nitrate removal was compared among bare TiO2, rGO/TiO2, Cu–Pd/TiO2, Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 and rGO/Cu–Pd/TiO2 in the absence of externally added electron donors (Fig. 3a). Bare TiO2 and rGO/TiO2 had no photoactivities during NO3− reduction but the Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 ternary composite showed an outstanding conversion efficiency among all. However, the removal efficiency was markedly reduced when the rGO layer was loaded onto Cu–Pd/TiO2 (rGO/Cu–Pd/TiO2). This result implies that the main active sites for NO3− reduction are Cu–Pd bimetals, and not the rGO layer. Since NO3− could not be removed at all by Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 in the dark, the possible contribution of the dark catalytic activity of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 should be ruled out. Dark adsorption of NO3−, NO2− and NH4+ ions on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 was also found to be negligible. It should be noted that N2 could be generated only on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2.

The time profiles of nitrate removal and N balance (%) along with the accompanying production of NO2− and N2 gas in the headspace in the suspension of (b) Cu/rGO/TiO2, (c) Pd/rGO/TiO2, (d) Cu–Pd/TiO2 and (e) Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2. The concentration of N2 dissolved in the solution should be negligibly small (<2% of the N2 gas in the headspace, smaller than the experimental uncertainty of the N2 gas amount) according to Henry's law constant of N2 and was neglected in the N balance calculation. (f) The nitrate conversion and the selectivity to N2 after the 4 h photoreaction for various composite photocatalysts. Experimental conditions: [catalyst] = 1.5 g L−1, [NO3−]0 = 100 μM, the content of rGO (or CNT), Cu, and Pd: 1 wt% each, pH = 5.3–6.0 (not adjusted), initially Ar-purged (deaerated suspension) and λ > 320 nm irradiation. 
To investigate the effects of each metal component and rGO on the photoactivity of the ternary composite, Cu/rGO/TiO2, Pd/rGO/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/TiO2 were also prepared and compared as control samples. Cu/rGO/TiO2 exhibited a markedly enhanced photoactivity for converting NO3− quantitatively to NO2− but it did not generate N2. Furthermore, produced NO2− was further oxidized back to NO3− gradually (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, Pd/rGO/TiO2 exhibited no photoactivity, which indicates that Pd alone cannot activate NO3− even in the presence of rGO (Fig. 3c and f). With Cu–Pd/TiO2, only 9.5% of NO3− could be quantitatively converted to NO2−, which confirms the essential role of rGO (Fig. 3d). In contrast, Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 was able to remove 91% of NO3− during the 4 h photoreaction with 98% selectivity to N2. Almost all NO3− ions were quantitatively converted to N2 with negligible generation of other byproducts such as NO2− or NH4+ (Fig. 3e and f). This confirms that the role of each component (Cu, Pd, and rGO) is essential for the overall photocatalytic conversion of NO3− to N2. To confirm that N2 was generated from the photocatalytic reduction of NO3− (not from the dissolved N2 in water or leaking from the ambient air), isotope experiments were carried out by using 15NO3− (Fig. S3, ESI†). The GC-MS spectra of the gas products collected from the reactor headspace 5 h after the reaction show the signal of 15N2. The signals for 15N2O and 15NO were not generated at all, which rules out the presence of any other 15N containing gaseous products. This result indicates that the sole gaseous product in the Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 system is 15N2. It is interesting to note that replacing rGO by a carbon nanotube (CNT) that is also often used as a carbonaceous charge transfer mediator showed a similar effect (Fig. 3f). With Cu–Pd/CNT/TiO2, almost 100% of NO3− could be converted to N2 without the formation of NO2−, but some NH4+ was generated unlike the case of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 (Fig. S4, ESI†). The results indicate that either rGO or CNT should facilitate the electron transfer from TiO2 to bimetal active sites in a similar way, which subsequently enhances the reductive transformation of NO3−. However, rGO seems to be more selective toward N2 production. The photocatalytic conversion efficiency and the selectivity toward N2 are compared among the different combinations of metals and rGO on TiO2 (Fig. 3f). Only when all three components of Cu, Pd and rGO are co-present on TiO2, NO3− can be efficiently and selectively converted to N2 in the absence of organic electron donors. The formation of NH4+ as a byproduct was negligible in all cases. It should be also noted that the biggest pH change (increase) before and after the photocatalytic reaction was only observed with Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 (pH 5.25 (before) → pH 7.02 (after)). This indicates that the nitrate photoconversion consumes protons in accordance with eqn (3) and (5).45,46 The nitrate conversion efficiency and selectivity to N2 on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 were maintained above 90% with [NO3−]0 ranging from 0.1 mM to 10 mM under the same experimental conditions (see Fig. S5, ESI†).
The optimum composition of the ternary composite photocatalyst for the highest conversion of NO3− and the highest selectivity to N2 was sought by varying the ratio of bimetals and the loading of rGO (Fig. S6, ESI†). The optimum ratio for bimetals (Cu:Pd) on rGO/TiO2 is 1:1 (Fig. S6a, ESI†). When the bimetals contain a lower content of Pd than Cu (Cu:Pd = 7:3), the selectivity to N2 was remarkably reduced. This indicates that Pd is the active site on which NO2− (generated on the Cu site from the reduction of NO3−) is converted to N2. Accordingly, increasing the Pd content (Cu:Pd = 3:7) increased the selectivity (90%), but the nitrate conversion efficiency was reduced in contrast because of the lack of Cu sites where NO3− is converted to NO2−.47 At a Cu:Pd mass ratio of 1:1, the highest conversion and selectivity were obtained. As for the rGO content in the ternary composite, both the conversion efficiency and the selectivity to N2 were highly enhanced as the rGO content increased from 0 wt% to 0.1 wt% (Fig. S6b, ESI†). A further increase of rGO loading had no effect on improving the selectivity but gradually increased the conversion efficiency with reaching a plateau above rGO 1 wt%. As a result, the optimal composition was determined as 1 wt% Cu, 1 wt% Pd, and 1 wt% rGO.
Mechanism of nitrate conversion on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2
The surface charge of rGO, bare TiO2, Cu–Pd/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 was estimated by measuring the zeta potentials of suspended particles as a function of initial pH (Fig. 4a). The point of zero zeta potential (PZZP) of TiO2 was approximately at pH 6.6, which is in agreement with the literature value.48 The deposition of Cu–Pd on TiO2 did not change the surface charge much. However, the surface charge of the composite catalyst was shifted towards negative upon loading rGO onto Cu–Pd/TiO2. Such a negative shift of the surface charge should not be a favorable condition for NO3− removal because of the negative–negative electrostatic repulsion. This is consistent with the observation that the NO3− removal efficiency decreased with increasing pH for both Cu–Pd/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 (Fig. 4b). However, it should be noted that Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2, which has higher negative charge than Cu–Pd/TiO2 over a wide pH range and should be more repulsive toward NO3−, is more active for NO3− removal than Cu–Pd/TiO2 in contrast (Fig. 4a and b). The surface charges of both (Cu–Pd/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2) become more negative with increasing pH. The presence of rGO should facilitate the electron transfer from TiO2 to the bimetals, which seems to compensate the negative effect of the electrostatic repulsion.

(b) Photoconversion of nitrate and (c) photoproduction of H2 on Cu–Pd/TiO2 with or without rGO as a function of pH. The initial pH was adjusted by HClO4 or NaOH. Experimental conditions: [catalyst] = 2 mg L−1 for (a) and 1.5 g L−1 for (b and c), the content of rGO, Cu, and Pd content: 1 wt% each, [NO3−]0 = 100 μM for (b), initially Ar-purged (deaerated suspension) and λ > 320 nm irradiation (for (b) and (c)). 
The rGO-facilitated photocatalytic activity was also confirmed for the photocatalytic production of H2. As in the case of nitrate removal, Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 exhibited higher H2 production activity than Cu–Pd/TiO2 over a wide pH range and the activity monotonously decreased with increasing pH for both photocatalysts (Fig. 4c). Pd/rGO/TiO2 showed the H2 production activity (4.9 μmol h−1 at pH 5) similar to that of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 while Cu/rGO/TiO2 did not, which indicates Pd on rGO/TiO2 is the active site for H2 production (data not shown in Fig. 4c). It is interesting to note that both the nitrate removal and H2 production show a similar pH-dependent behavior and are similarly enhanced by the presence of rGO. This will be discussed in a later section.
As the photocatalytic removal of NO3− involves the production of NO2− as an intermediate, the photocatalytic conversion activities of NO2− are compared using Cu/rGO/TiO2, Pd/rGO/TiO2, Cu–Pd/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 to evaluate the catalytic roles of Cu and Pd in the nitrite conversion (Fig. 5a–d). The time profiles of NO3− and NO2− removal are compared among the different catalysts (Fig. 5e). Pd/rGO/TiO2 cannot remove NO3− at all whereas it shows the highest activity for NO2− removal (Fig. 5f). Pd/rGO/TiO2, however, converts NO2− to both N2 and NO3− at a nearly 1:1 ratio (Fig. 5b). On the other hand, Cu/rGO/TiO2 can convert NO2− to NO3− and NO3− to NO2− almost quantitatively without generating N2 (Fig. 3b and 5a). It is interesting to note that NO2− is converted to N2 only without generating NO3− at all on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2. Only Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 can convert both NO3− and NO2− to N2, which indicates that the co-presence of Cu and Pd on TiO2 is essentially needed for the denitrification process (Fig. 3e and Fig. 5d). The above findings suggest the following denitrification mechanism on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2: NO3− is first converted to NO2− on Cu, then NO2− is immediately converted to N2 in the co-presence of Pd as soon as it is generated.

The concentration of N2 dissolved in the solution should be negligibly small (<2% of the N2 gas in the headspace, smaller than the experimental uncertainty of the N2 gas amount) according to Henry's law constant of N2 and was neglected in the N balance calculation. (e) Time profile of photocatalytic removal of nitrate and nitrite using Cu/rGO/TiO2, Pd/rGO/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2. (f) Photocatalytic removal rates of nitrate and nitrite and the selectivity to N2 for M/rGO/TiO2 (M = Cu, Pd, or Cu–Pd). Experimental conditions: [catalyst] = 1.5 g L−1, the content of rGO, Cu, and Pd: 1 wt% each, [NO2−]0 = 100 μM for (a–f), [NO3−]0 = 100 μM for (e and f), initially Ar-purged (deaerated suspension), pH = 5.3–6.0, and λ > 320 nm irradiation. 
To investigate the possible role of in situ generated H2, the photoreduction of NO3− was conducted under different gas purging conditions (Fig. 6a). Most photocatalysis experiments in this study were conducted under anoxic conditions with 30 min Ar purging prior to irradiation. However, the photoactivity of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 totally disappeared when Ar was continuously purged under stirring during the irradiation period. Under continuous Ar purging, any in situ generated H2 should be immediately removed and cannot react with nitrate. Accordingly, when the mixed gas of Ar–H2 (95:5) was continuously purged into the reactor instead of pure Ar, NO3− was completely removed in 2 h without generating any ionic products such as NO2− and NH4+. This clearly indicates that in situ generated H2 should be involved as a reductant of nitrate and eqn (5) more properly represents the overall photocatalytic denitrification process than eqn (3). Incidentally, both NO3− and NO2− can be reduced on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 in the dark under continuous H2 purging (see Fig. S7, ESI†). The reduction rate of NO2− was much faster than that of NO3− probably because H2 can be consumed more efficiently for reducing NO2− to N2 on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2. On the other hand, the introduction of O2 (20%) completely hindered NO3− reduction (even in the presence of methanol as a reductant, data not shown in Fig. 6), which should be ascribed to the electron scavenging properties of O2 that should inhibit the production of H2 and the reduction of nitrate.49 The removal of NO3− was much faster when either methanol or H2 gas was additionally introduced into the catalyst suspension (see Fig. 6a). The addition of methanol increased the amount of in situ generated H2 from 32.4 μmol to 134.9 μmol after the 3 h photoreaction with accelerating the nitrate removal rate, which reconfirms that the in situ generated H2 should be significantly involved in the nitrate reduction pathway. Regardless of the presence of methanol, in situ generation of H2 was suppressed in the presence of NO3− (Fig. 6b), which indicates that the in situ generated H2 is consumed for reducing NO3−. On the other hand, photogenerated holes in Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 oxidize water to produce O2 while there was no O2 generation in the absence of rGO (Fig. 6c). The production of O2 on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 was slightly lower than the stoichiometric amount (H2/O2 = 2.0) in the absence of NO3− because the photogenerated O2 can be immediately reduced to generate H2O2.35 Accordingly, the production of H2O2 was significantly suppressed and the production of O2 was enhanced in the presence of nitrate that can hinder the reduction of O2 as a competing electron acceptor (see Fig. S8, ESI†).

(b) In situ generated H2 in the presence or absence of nitrate and methanol. (c) Generation of H2 and O2 on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2. Experimental conditions: [catalyst] = 1.5 g L−1, the content of rGO, Cu, and Pd: 1 wt% each, [NO3−]0 = 100 μM, pH = 5.3–6.0 (not adjusted), initially gas-purged or continuously Ar-purged, λ > 320 nm irradiation, and [MeOH] = 10 vol% (when indicated in (a) and (b)). 
To investigate the role of rGO hybridization on the photoinduced charge separation and electron transfer on TiO2, the electron shuttle (Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple)-mediated photocurrent was collected and compared with that of the irradiated suspension of bare TiO2, Cu–Pd/TiO2, and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 (Fig. 7). The process of the photocurrent measurement in the slurry phase is illustrated in Fig. 7a. Fe3+ was initially injected into the photocatalyst suspension and gradually photoreduced to Fe2+ which is subsequently oxidized back to Fe3+ on the collector electrode. As the concentration of Fe2+ gradually increases to reach the photostationary state, the time profile of photocurrent follows the same trend. The presence of metal nanoparticles and rGO reduces the electron–hole recombination through electron trapping and subsequently accelerates the interfacial electron transfer to Fe3+. The photocurrents collected in the slurry increased in the order of bare TiO2, Cu–Pd/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 in the absence of NO3− (Fig. 7b). In Fig. 7e, linear sweep voltammograms using the catalyst-coated electrodes show that the photoreductive current increased in the order of bare TiO2, Cu–Pd/TiO2, and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2, which is consistent with the result shown in Fig. 7b. The comparison among the EIS Nyquist plots of the prepared electrodes also showed that the interfacial charge transfer resistance was markedly reduced by introducing rGO (Fig. 7f). These results confirm that loading the bimetals (Cu–Pd) and rGO on TiO2 not only accelerates the photoinduced interfacial electron transfer rate but also reduces the overpotential of water reduction. How the presence of the bimetals and rGO influences the photoconversion of NO3− was investigated by monitoring the photocurrent collection in the presence of NO3− that should compete with the Fe3+ ion as an electron acceptor (eqn (9)–(11)). e− (cb) + Fe3+ → Fe2+(9) Fe2+ → Fe3+ + Pt cathode (e−)(10) e− (cb) + NO3− →→ N2(11)

Experimental conditions: [catalyst] = 1.5 g L−1, the content of rGO, Cu, and Pd: 1 wt% each, [NO3−]0 = 100 μM (for (c)), [NaClO4] = 0.1 M, [Fe3+] = 0.5 mM, pHi = 3 (adjusted by HClO4), Pt electrode held at +0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), initially Ar-purged. (e) Linear sweep voltammograms at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 (range between −0.2 and +0.2 VAg/AgCl). (f) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) Nyquist plots of the bare TiO2, Cu–Pd/TiO2, and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 electrode with +0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under UV irradiation (λ > 320 nm). 
It is interesting to note that the order of photocurrent generation was reversed in the presence of NO3− (compare Fig. 7b and c): the photocurrent production rate was the fastest in bare TiO2 suspension and the slowest in the Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 suspension. In the Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 suspension, the photocurrent generation was reduced with increasing [NO3−] (Fig. 7d). This indicates that the photoinduced electrons are more preferentially transferred to NO3− than to Fe3+ (eqn (9)vs.eqn (11)) when Cu–Pd and rGO are loaded on TiO2. That is, the co-presence of Cu–Pd and rGO makes CB electrons react more selectively with NO3−, which is consistent with the fact that NO3− reduction efficiency increased in the order of bare TiO2 < Cu–Pd/TiO2 < Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2.
The charge recombination behaviors of different photocatalysts (bare TiO2, Cu–Pd/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2) were investigated by monitoring the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay (Fig. 8). The average lifetimes were estimated by fitting the PL decay using multi-exponential curves, which are summarized in Table 2. The charge recombination was largely suppressed by the presence of both bimetals and rGO (i.e., the slowest in Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2), which is consistent with the highest photocatalytic activity of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 (Fig. 3). The average PL lifetime significantly increased from 50.0 ps for bare TiO2 to 532.9 ps for Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2. This indicates that the charge pairs generated in Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 are much longer lived due to the facilitated electron transfer to the metal and rGO phase, which subsequently increases the chance of the interfacial electron transfer (i.e., nitrate reduction).50–53

The wavelength-dependent photocatalytic activities of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 were extended up to 450 nm whereas those of Cu–Pd/TiO2 were negligible (Fig. 9a). This implies that the photons absorbed by Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 are efficiently used to induce the subsequent charge transfer and multi-electron transfer. It is noted that AQY (%) was much higher at higher concentration of nitrate (0.1 vs. 10 mM). The Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 sample demonstrated an excellent stability during 20 cycles of repeated photocatalytic tests without showing any sign of deactivation (Fig. 9b). To further test if there is any change in the catalyst property after photoreaction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The Pd 3d, Cu 2p and C 1s bands in the XPS spectra of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 for the fresh and used samples were de-convoluted as shown in Fig. S9b–d (ESI†). There was no change for the Cu band after the repeated photoreactions. rGO also remained intact after 20th cycle of photoreaction without showing any change in the C 1s band (Fig. S9d, ESI†). This suggests that rGO is photochemically stable against the photoinduced hole oxidation under the present experimental conditions. The Pd band is composed of two peaks originating from Pd at 340.6 and 335.2 eV and PdO at 341.6 and 336.2 eV.54,55 A fraction of PdO was observed even in the fresh Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 sample and moderately increased after the photoreaction, which is a typical cause that lowers the nitrate reduction activity.56–58 It is noted that some of the Pd particles were oxidized during prolonged photoreaction while the photoefficiency and selectivity of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 for nitrate conversion were maintained despite such a moderate change in Pd.

Conclusions
The conversion of nitrate to dinitrogen (denitrification) is an important step in the global nitrogen cycle, which mainly proceeds through a biological pathway in the environment. Utilizing solar energy and photocatalysts for facilitating the denitrification can be proposed as an alternative engineering solution that can control the recalcitrant pollutant. While previous studies of photocatalytic denitrification required external organic electron donors, this work demonstrates a donor-free denitrification system by designing a novel composite photocatalyst that couples photocatalytic nitrate reduction and water splitting (H2 production) together. A titania-based photocatalyst loaded with Cu–Pd bimetals and rGO was synthesized as an efficient composite that enables the direct conversion of NO3− to N2 without generation of other byproducts. A unique mechanism of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 that utilizes in situ generated H2 (via water splitting) as a reductant of nitrate was proposed. The different nitrate reduction pathways on Cu/rGO/TiO2, Pd/rGO/TiO2 and Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 are illustrated in Scheme 1. The co-presence of Cu–Pd and rGO enables the composite photocatalyst to achieve near 100% selectivity to N2. While NO3− could be converted to NO2− only in the absence of rGO (on Cu–Pd/TiO2), introducing rGO as a charge transfer mediator on Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 generated much more H2 from water splitting compared to Cu–Pd/TiO2. The generated H2 is used as an in situ reductant for NO3− (or NO2−), which is subsequently converted to N2. On Cu/rGO/TiO2, nitrate is converted to nitrite only and nitrite to nitrate only, which leads to a dynamic equilibrium between nitrate and nitrite with no further photoconversion (Fig. 3b and 5a). On Pd/rGO/TiO2, nitrate is not converted at all and only nitrite can be oxidized to nitrate along with some generation of N2 (Fig. 3c and 5b). Only Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 can convert both nitrate and nitrite quantitatively to N2 (Fig. 3e and 5d). The PL and electrochemical characteristics of Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2 reveal that the coexistence of Cu–Pd (as co-catalysts) and rGO (as a charge transfer mediator) significantly retards the charge recombination and facilitates the selective electron transfer to nitrate with the concurrent and quantitative production of N2. The present study proposes a unique solar conversion system that couples solar water splitting with denitrification as a sustainable solution for controlling nitrogen pollutants.

Broader context
Nitrate is a ubiquitous aquatic pollutant that cannot be easily controlled and the imbalance between the anthropogenic discharge and the natural removal in the global nitrogen cycle causes the accumulation of nitrate in the environment. Solar photocatalytic reduction of recalcitrant nitrate has attracted interest as a potential controlling method but achieving high efficiency and selectivity to N2 without generating harmful byproducts such as nitrite and ammonium is still a challenging issue. Although cocatalyst-loaded photocatalysts for nitrate removal have been frequently reported, they need the addition of reducing reagents such as organic compounds and H2, which limits their practical applications. This work is the first successful demonstration that combines photocatalytic denitrification and water splitting in a single photocatalytic system, which utilizes in situ generated H2 as a reductant of nitrate. TiO2 modified with a bimetallic cocatalyst (Cu–Pd) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is designed as a special-purpose photocatalyst to enable the direct conversion of nitrate to N2 without requiring chemical reductants. The overall mechanism of the ternary-composite (Cu–Pd/rGO/TiO2) photocatalytic denitrification system works through the synergic action of Cu as an active catalytic site for nitrate-to-nitrite conversion, Pd for nitrite-to-dinitrogen conversion and H2 production, and rGO facilitating the interfacial charge transfer and H2 production. The proposed solar denitrification system provides a model that combines “environmental photocatalysis” (denitrification) with “energy photocatalysis” (H2 production via water splitting) in a sustainable way.
