    , Accepted 28th November 2022First published on 6th December 2022AbstractCopper chalcogenides (CuCh) have attracted considerable attention due to their promising potential as environmental-friendly photoactive material for lightweight and flexible thin film solar cells. Further, CuCh can be fabricated from simple to complex chemical compositions and offer a remarkable charge carrier mobility and excellent absorption coefficient with a desirable bandgap (up to ∼1.0 eV). Currently, they have demonstrated maximum power conversion efficiencies of over 23% for single-junction, around 25% and 28% for monolithic 2-Terminal (2T) and mechanically-stacked 4-Terminal (4T) perovskite/CuCh tandem solar cells, respectively. This article presents an overview of CuCh-based materials, from binary- to quaternary-CuCh compounds for single- and multi-junction solar cells. Then, we discuss the development of fabrication methods and the approaches taken to improve the performance of CuCh-based thin film itself, including chemical doping, the development of complement layers, and their potential application in flexible and lightweight devices. Finally, these technologies' stability, scalability, and toxicity aspects are discussed to enhance their current marketability.

1. Introduction
To date, numerous classes of materials have been developed exponentially to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single- and multi-junction solar cells close to their theoretical limit.1 So far, the crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell has dominated ∼90% of the commercial photovoltaics (PV) market.2 However, the fabrication of c-Si solar cells requires very thick wafers (typically above a few hundred μm) and high-temperature/vacuum processes, adversely impacting the cost of production and limiting their application for flexible and lightweight solar cell applications.3 Thin-film PV technologies, on the other hand, consist of thin semiconducting films as the photo-active layer, with a typical thickness of around 1 μm. Developing thin-film technologies is critical as the market demand for portable or wearable optoelectronic for lightweight and flexible devices increases.4 Among thin film-based PV technologies, copper chalcogenide (CuCh) thin films are being considered more advantageous in terms of environmental-friendly, stable materials (owing to the lifetime of around 20–25 years in modules), and decent efficiency (PCEs above 23% in small-sized devices and around 19% in modules),5 as summarized in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Typical wafer and thin film technologies and comparison of the three-generation solar cell technologies. 
The simple to complex compositions of CuCh can be fabricated using various methods, including solution-processed and vacuum techniques with various temperature processes.6–10 This will give more flexibility to deposit CuCh thin film onto various glass substrates, such as glass, plastic, or metal substrates.4 CuCh materials have been used for many optoelectronic device applications, such as photodetectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), near-infrared plasmon resonances, biomedical imaging, and biosensors, that can operate in a wide wavelength range from visible to the near-infrared (NIR) due to tuneable bandgaps.11–15 In addition, for solar cell application, CuCh materials can be used as photoactive or charge selecting contact materials.16,17 Specifically, their application as photoactive materials in solar cell device is more dominant due to their high hole mobility (up to 200 cm2 V−1 s−1), tunable bandgap (from around 1.0 to 2 eV), high absorption coefficient (up to 105 cm−1), chemical stability, etc.16–18
For instance, ternary-CuCh (in the form of CuIn(S,Se)2 or CIS) and quaternary-CuCh (in the form of Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)4 or CIGS and kesterite Cu(Zn,Sn)(S,Se)4 or CZTS) have received increasing attention as photoactive materials due to their low bandgap (with a direct bandgap of around 1.0 to 1.2 eV) and gives a higher efficiency potential.19,20 Despite the promising PCE that has been demonstrated by CuCh-based solar cells, their performances are still behind perovskite thin film solar cells.5,21,22 Yet, this raises numerous questions about how to improve the PCE of CuCh-based solar cells close to their theoretical limit, particularly in the case of CIGS or CIS solar cells.23 Tremendous efforts have been reported to improve the efficiency of CuCh thin films through chemical doping or passivation, layer structure, and morphology modifications.10,16,20,24,25
A ternary-CIS offers the lowest bandgap up to ∼1.0 eV, comparable to the c-Si bandgap.26 Consequently, CIS has more potential to absorb a wider range of wavelengths in the solar spectrum and becomes one of the perfect materials as photoactive layers for solar cell applications.26 However, their maximum PCEs are still limited by around 19% due to the difficulty in controlling the CIS-film's phase purity.16,27–29 The detrimental impurity and high defect concentration come from Cu vacancies (VCu) or anti-sites in the off-stoichiometric composition film that deteriorate the transport properties and reduce the device performance.30 Alternatively, the better quality of single-phase quaternary-CIGS films can be obtained by adding gallium (Ga) atoms to reduce the defect density in the CIGS bulk films.31 As a result, a higher PCE > 23% can be achieved with CIGS-based solar cells.31
On the other hand, the structure of quaternary-CZTS is built from the CIGS structure, where Zn2+ and Sn4+ atoms replace In3+ and Ga3+ atoms in CIGS with a simple process.32 Nevertheless, CZTS solar cells exhibit stagnant PCE improvement during a decade (with a maximum PCE of around 13%).32,33 The stagnant PCE improvements of these devices are mainly from the large open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and inferior fill factor (FF) due to defect-assisted recombination in bulk and interface at the heterojunction.32,33 Though with lower PCE than the CIGS and CIS cases, the raw materials of CZTS (Zn and Sn) are known to be less expensive with more elemental abundance sources than raw materials used in CIGS or CIS (In or Ga atoms).20,32,34,35 In this sense, CZTS could benefit in potentially lowering the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) if their PCEs can be improved, like CIGS or c-Si solar cells.35,36
The higher PCEs can be achieved by fabricating the multi-junction CuCh-tandem devices with wide-bandgap perovskite thin film as top cells,37,38 thanks to their excellent flexibility properties and high performances of CuCh and perovskite thin films. The PCEs of mechanically stacked 4T perovskite/CIGS tandem devices have already shown promising PCEs (∼28% and ∼25% in rigid and flexible substrates, respectively) and have the potential to be increased above 30%.17,39 Overall, it is still challenging for the solar cell research community to achieve high PCEs with long-term stability and low production costs. Therefore, we overview the challenges and prospects related to the fabrication and optimization of CuCh thin film solar cells for single- and multi-junction devices and provide future design guidelines. Stability and scalability, which are the major obstacles to the commercialization of this technology, will be discussed. In addition, we give our perspectives on the potential of flexible CuCh thin film solar cells for wearable and portable solar cell applications. Finally, we present the potential to enhance the marketability of the CuCh thin film-based environmental-friendly wearable or PV modules.
2. Binary CuCh-based solar cells
The binary CuCh (Ch = S, Se) compounds have been widely explored as one of the important components in solar cell devices, mainly as inorganic charge-selecting layers or photoactive materials.6,40–44 As one of the pioneer materials in solar cells, the CuS or CuSe family has been investigated earlier as photoactive materials. The simple fabrication via the solution process of CuS/Se attracts great interest in theoretical and practical applications of thin film solar cells.45,46 The stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric compositions of CuS/Se could be formed by varying their elemental ratio. The element of S and Se in CuS/Se compound could have a significant impact on the optoelectronic property of the semiconductor material. The variation in the stoichiometric ratio depending on the fabrication methods and parameters, such as types of the chemical composition of Cu and S/Se precursor, composition ratio, synthesis time, and temperature used during synthesis, will affect the formation of different crystalline structures, carrier concentration, and bandgap.7,47–50
In general, CuS and CuSe compounds have similar crystal structures, hexagonal, cubic, etc., as shown in Fig. 2(a).7,51,52 CuS and CuSe can be found in various forms and structures depending upon their sulfidation or selenization. For example, CuS or Se can be formed from Cu2−xS or Se (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) as well as their metastable phase, such as Cu2S3.47–49 The copper vacancies in binary CuS compounds could serve as electron acceptors and make them a better p-type semiconductor.53 The general optical bandgaps of CuS (∼2.0 eV) are higher compared to CuSe (∼1.8 eV) due to decreasing the electron carrier density.53–55 Se is naturally more reactive and sensitive compared to S. Therefore, it is a bit challenging to form a stable phase of CuSe. However, CuS possesses a higher bandgap that may limit its application. As a consequence, making CuSSe alloy would benefit from maintaining the lower bandgap with better phase stability in the semiconductor crystal.
 Fig. 2  (a) Crystal structures and (b) summary of efficiencies of binary-CuCh thin films as photoactive layers or charge-selecting layers in solar cells.51,52,65–77 
At the device level, the CuS/Se was used as a photoactive material with a promising PCE of 9% in the late 1970s.44 However, this interest faded with the finding that this material is sensitive to moisture and limited PCEs.44 Overall, the PCEs of solar cells using CuS/Se as photoactive material is still relatively low, as summarized in Fig. 2(b). The wider bandgap CuS/Se is not suitable for photoactive materials in single-junction solar cells. However, several studies reported using CuS/Se as inorganic hole-transporting layers (HTLs) for other solar cell types, such as perovskite or dye sensitized solar cells.7,51 For instance, CuS layers have been used as HTLs in both regular and inverted PSCs with improved PCEs and stability of solar cells,56,57 approaching current state-of-the-art dopant-free organic HTL performances.58–62 In addition, the hole mobility of binary-CuS can reach up to ∼25 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is ideal for transporting layers in solar cell applications.63,64 These results confirm the benefits of using binary CuS/Se as inorganic selecting layers.
3. Ternary CuCh-based solar cells
As opposed to binary compounds, which were covered in the previous section, the development of ternary-CIS compounds has been proposed to narrow the bandgap to efficiently absorb the light spectrum, improving photocurrent response and cell performance. Several attempts have been made to develop various ternary-CIS compounds as photoactive materials for solar cells.9,78–82 To form a ternary system, additional transition metals or metalloids (such as Sb, Bi, Sn, In, Fe, Ag, etc.) need to be added to the binary system (CuS/Se). As a result, ternary CuInS2, Cu3BiS3, CuSbS2, CuSbSe2, Cu2SnSe3, etc., have been successfully fabricated.83
These ternary compounds’ crystal structures and bandgaps vary depending upon their atomic compositions and chemical interactions, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Different atomic compositions provide more diverse covalent bonding, ionic radii, and electronegativity properties. For instance, in CuSbS2 and CuInS2 cases, In and Sb atoms have similar covalent atomic radii (equivalent to 142 and 139 Å, respectively), but form different crystal structures. This is because of the difference in electronegativity between In2+ and Sb2+ ions, wherein the In–S bond is more ionic than the Sb–S bond. Consequently, the starting compounds of CuInS2 and CuSbS2 crystallize differently and form different crystal structures, “tetragonal and orthorhombic,” respectively.84 Ternary CuCh also has a high dark current due to high electrical conductivity. The conductivity of ternary CuCh is an intrinsic property determined by the majority carrier concentration and their mobility.85

(d) Summary of efficiency achievement of single-junction ternary-CuCh-based solar cells.8,27,30,79,93–98 
On the other hand, from the solar cell device's perspective, CIS has more advantages due to its lower bandgap (∼1.0 eV), which can potentially absorb more photons in the NIR regime. So far, the PCE of around 19.2% demonstrated the record PCE in CIS solar cells, as shown from the current-density–voltage (J–V) curve in Fig. 3(b).27 These achievements demonstrated comparable performance to other thin film technologies, such as organic and quantum-dot solar cells.86–88 Notably, most high-efficiency CIS devices still use CdS as an n-buffer layer, and hydrazine post-treatment is often needed. Therefore, it is essential to replace the CdS buffer layer and remove hydrazine post-treatment during fabrication steps that have problems in the toxicity aspects, as will be discussed in detail later.
The highest photo-generated current density (JSC) has been achieved at around 42.3 mA cm−2, which represents around 95.7% of the theoretical Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit value of ∼1.0 eV bandgap.89 Further, the limiting VOC (only ∼72.6% of SQ VOC limit) and FF values (only ∼86.1% of SQ VOC limit) of CIS solar cells limit their PCE, as theoretical SQ PCE limit should be around 30.8% for single-junction solar cells.89 Several passivations or doping with alkali metal post-deposition methods have been successfully carried out. However, the VOC limit might also come from the quality of the CIS film quality with smaller grain sizes and often with pinholes in the films. This also relates to the fabrication method used, for example, using solution processed or co-evaporation, as summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 3(d).

The morphology of CIS films could affect the performance of the solar cell. It was found that the enhancement in the flatness of CIS film in the CIS-based solar cells enhances the VOC because of a smaller p–n junction area.90 Precise control of morphology and crystal quality could improve the PCE.90 The CIS layer with uniform morphology, highly dense surface, and large grain size could improve the PCE in CIS-based solar cells.91 Recently, it was also found that the CIS layer with highly dense surface morphology exhibit enhancement in PCE up to 9%.92 The improvement of the relative surface density and microstructural development of the CIS layer could reduce the parasitic resistances and more significantly lower the recombination current, thus, resulting in the enhancement of solar cell parameters, such as VOC, FF, and PCE.92

Fig. 3(c) shows the external-quantum-efficiency (EQE) spectra of CIS solar cells using Al-doped ZnO (AZO) as a window layer. The better transparency and electrical sheet resistances of AZO offer more benefits than other transparent conducting oxide layers, as will be discussed later.28 However, a relatively lower EQE value at a lower energy wavelength is clearly observed, which might be due to the non-optimized thickness of the CIS film. Improving the quality of the films would improve the charge diffusion length and thickness. Therefore, there is still room to further improve their current density by improving the quality of CIS film with thicker films. Improving the EQE response at lower energy wavelengths could benefit tandem devices.
4. Quaternary CIGS- or CZTS-based solar cells

Fig. 4(a) shows the crystal structures of quaternary CIGS and CZTS crystals. Generally, ternary-CIS compounds have been developed as a starting material for growing quaternary-CIGS by partially substituting In atoms with Ga atoms.111 As a result, the bandgap of CIGS will be slightly higher than CIS. The bandgap of CIGS is practically around 1.10 eV by controlling the In and Ga composition ratio, making them still a perfect candidate as photoactive materials for solar cell applications. In addition, when all In atoms are replaced by Ga atoms completely, the bandgap of CGS alloy will go higher at around 1.70 eV.16 On the other hand, kesterite CZTS can be formed by solid-state reactions between ternary-Cu2Sn(S,Se)3 and ZnS or ZnSe compounds.112–114

Replotted from ref. 31. (d) Summary of PCEs of single-junction quaternary-CuCh-based solar cells with and without CdS layers.19,116,128–132 
CZTS solar cells have shown moderate PCEs of >12% at the device's level with a bandgap from 1.04 to 1.30 eV.32,83,115,116 CZTS materials intrinsically have a p-type semiconductor character with two different crystal structure phases (stannite and kesterite), wherein the kesterite phase is known to be more stable than the stannite phase.117,118 They also exhibit excellent absorption coefficient values up to 104 cm−1 and direct bandgap, similar to CIGS.20 However, the PCEs of CZTS/Se cells are still far behind CIGS cells, as summarized in Fig. 4(d) and Table 2. One possible reason could be the large VOC-loss (∼344 mV, with respect to the SQ-limit) of CZTS cells due to a relatively high defect density at the bulk and surface of films, causing the non-radiative recombination sites.115 The morphology of the CZTS layer, crystallinity, and grain size could affect the light-to-electric conversion efficiency of CZTS-based solar cells. It was found that the large grain size of the CZTS layer could reduce the boundary defects that become the recombination centers of photogenerated charge carriers. Uniform film with a large grain size reduces the grain boundary, and reducing the grain boundary is important to enhance solar cell performance.119 A highly rough surface of the CZTS layer also could cause carrier recombination at the CZTS/n-buffer interface.120,121 Better morphology and excellent crystallinity of the CZTS layer can also reduce the detrimental secondary phase formation.121,122

On the other hand, chalcopyrite CIGS-based solar cells demonstrated higher PCEs with certified PCE >23% in single-junction solar cells (lower VOC-loss of ∼100 mV).123 In contrast to CIS and CZTS solar cells, most high-efficiency CIGS-based devices are based on Cd-free layers, thanks to zinc sulfide (ZnS) that offers better optical and electronic properties as n-type buffer layers. As a result, higher JSC and FF values of cells with ZnS than CdS have been achieved.31 Cd-free CIGS solar cells could revolutionize the industrial thin film PV technology as environmental-friendly modules in the future, as discussed later. Fig. 4(b) and (c) show the typical J–V and EQE plots of champion CIGS devices with and without CdS layers, respectively.124–126 Interfaces between CIGS and n-buffer layer, both CdS and ZnS buffer, are important for cell efficiency. For instance, the surface morphology of CIGS to the n-buffer layer determines the formation of carrier recombination that should be avoided. Therefore, good crystallinity and surface morphology of the CIGS layer could enhance the performance of the solar cell because of minimum carrier recombination formation.127
5. CuCh-based tandem solar cells
The development of multi-junction tandem solar cell structures has been studied extensively. It continues to garner more attention as a potential strategy to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction devices due to thermalization energy and transmission losses.157 Fabricating the multi-junction devices with different bandgaps of materials could significantly reduce thermalization losses and substantially increase the PCE limits.157 However, to realize highly efficient multi-junction solar cells, it is important to develop efficient and low-cost wide and narrow bandgap semiconductor-based front and back cells simultaneously.158–161 Overall, the wide-bandgap perovskites (WBPs, Eg = 1.6 to 1.7 eV) have been successfully integrated with established narrow bandgap active layer solar cells such as silicon (Eg = 1.12 eV) and CuCh-based (Eg = 1.00 to 1.20 eV) or narrow bandgap mixed Pb–Sn perovskite solar cells.158,162–165 Although, the record PCE of monolithic tandem cells is based on perovskite/Si tandem cells (PCE of 31.3%).158,166,167 The development of CuCh-based thin-film tandem cells is still substantial as this thin-film technology could be prepared on flexible substrates that can give more advantages for optoelectronic applications, unlike c-Si wafers.
The progress of ternary CIS or quaternary CIGS and CZTS as narrow bandgap single-junction solar cells are discussed in the previous section. Here, the progress of WBPs development will also be critical to fabricate efficient tandem with narrow bandgap CuCh-based materials. The WBPs are typically formed through the replacement of the halide site (I with Br) or the A cation site (formamidinium or methylammonium with Cs).168,169 However, they still suffer from photo-induced phase segregation. Increasing bromide content for fabrication of WBPs destabilizes the perovskite structure, which leads to phase segregation into iodide and bromide-rich regions induced by light illumination.168–170 Iodide-rich regions act as recombination centers, and thus, their existence leads to poor optoelectronic properties and substantial VOC-deficits relative to the SQ limit.138,168,170 Phase segregation likely originates at grain boundaries and at the surfaces where a larger density of defects (mainly halide vacancies) is located.138 Hence, passivation agents employed to passivate surface dangling bonds in WBPs also have to inhibit phase segregation in these materials. Several strategies have been demonstrated successfully to overcome the issues in WBPs by compositional engineering of the A cation site using bulky organic cations.138,168–174
Typically, WBPs still exhibited a large VOC-deficit (>0.40 eV) due to their liability to form a high density of deep traps that will limit their responsibility in tandem devices.138,168–175 So far, 2D perovskite passivation on top of 3D-WBPs was reported to achieve a VOC over 1.30 V and efficiency near 20%, showing the lowest VOC-deficit (∼92.9% of SQ VOC limit) among the reported literature.174 2D perovskite passivation could effectively suppress the phase segregation of 3D-WBPs by stabilizing 3D perovskite from phase separation. As a result, a remarkable long-term operational stability cell under illumination with >80% retention for more than 1000 h without encapsulation has been demonstrated. These results well demonstrated the feasibility of the 2D perovskite passivation method to obtain high performance and improved stability of WBPs for multi-junction-tandem applications.
For instance, an improvement of the perovskite/CIGS tandem device performance is found to increase from 3.1 to 18.2 and 21.6% by changing the recombination interface from CdS/ZnO/PTAA to CdS/ZnO/NiOx and then CdS/ZnO/NiOx/PTAA, respectively.176 Several examples of recombination junctions have been developed, such as CdS/i-ZnO/BZO/ITO/PTAA and CdS/ZnO/MePACz (4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butylphosphonic acid) as the recombination layers that result in 22.4 and 24.2% of PCE, respectively.17,177 This recombination junction is essential to develop efficient 2T perovskite/CuCh tandem solar cells. In addition, the chemical robustness of the recombination junction is required to protect the underlying layers during cell processing.178 It was found that the fine-tuning of the recombination layers could improve the VOC and further enhance the efficiency of perovskite/CuCh tandem devices.176 As discussed above, the main limitation in perovskite-based tandem solar cells is due to the resulting relatively lower VOC and FF values.179 Thus, strategies to obtain the high VOC and FF of the perovskite-based tandem solar cells are via the optimization of the perovskite itself by reducing the interface recombination of the high bandgap perovskite cells, as well as finding a favorable energy alignment of the contact layers in tandem solar cell devices.179
In terms of device engineering, there are two main types of tandem solar cells, two-terminal (2T, sub-cells current matching) and four terminals (4T, mechanically stacked sub-cells), as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). In Fig. 5(c) and (d), the theoretical PCE limit of two-junction solar cells as a function of the top and bottom cell bandgap is plotted for 2T and 4T devices, respectively. For both the 4T and 2T tandems, a maximum theoretical PCE limit of above 40% can be realized through the optimal bandgap combinations. 2T tandem would give more benefits for industrial fabrication as better economic viability as the devices can be fabricated monolithically. However, the 2T tandem will be limited to only using inverted PSC architecture. The reason behind this is the difficulty of fabricating the regular structure of CuCh-bottom cells itself. In addition, the difficulties of finding proper recombination junctions for the 2T perovskite/CuCh tandem also slow down the progress. Further, the current matching limits the restriction on choosing the bandgaps of each subcell. For example, with an established narrow bandgap bottom cell (i.e., Si and CIGS), the optimal top cell wide-bandgap is limited to the range of 1.6–1.75 eV.123 Contrastingly, 4T tandem has some advantages as there is no need to take care of several aspects, such as different polarity platforms (inverted or regular configurations), recombination junction, current matching, and processing compatibility between subcells.

Solid symbols represent rigid devices, while open symbols are for flexible devices. 
The performance of 2T- and 4T-based perovskite/CuCh tandems on rigid and flexible substrates are summarized in Fig. 5(e). For instance, the perovskite/CuCh tandem development is focused more on 4T due to the flexibility of choosing top-cell with different polarities (see Fig. 5(b)). So far, CuCh-based 4T-tandems have reached the PCEs of ∼28% on the perovskite/CIGS and ∼27% on perovskite/CIS.27,180,181 In addition, the flexible 4T and 2T of perovskite/CIGS tandems have achieved PCEs of around 21% and above 13%, respectively.137,182 Recently, the PCE of above 24% of flexible 4T-stacked perovskite/CIGS tandem on devices has been achieved.123,183 This result demonstrated the highest PCE on flexible thin film solar cells, which could open new paths for flexible optoelectronic devices in the future. On the other hand, 4T perovskite/CZTS also showed promising PCE above 22% on the rigid substrates.79,184 Overall, these tandem PCEs already exceeded the PCEs of the single-junction solar cell itself, with the most promising PCE on perovskite/CIGS tandem on rigid and flexible devices. Interestingly, based on the finding strategies on perovskite/Si tandem, the practical PCE of perovskite/CIGS could realistically be achieved at around 32%.17 Finally, the finding of alternative wide-bandgap lead-free-based top-cell will also be a critical challenge to realizing environmental-friendly tandem PV modules in the future.
6. Deposition methods and development of CuCh thin-films
Deposition methods of CuCh will determine the quality of photoactive CuCh films. Nevertheless, those deposition methods should be compatible with scalable technology transfer techniques at the industrial level. Obtaining marketable CuCh-based solar cells requires easy integration of fabrication methods. Vacuum deposition methods, such as Co-evaporation, radiofrequency (RF) sputtering, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), electron beam deposition (EBD), and pulse laser deposition (PLD) are scalable techniques that have been used in current industrial PV manufacturing. However, most vacuum deposition methods are expensive and require sophisticated tools; thereby, non-vacuum by means of solution process deposition methods would potentially become a suitable technology for low-cost fabrication methods. Mainly, roll-to-roll (R2R) printing or slot-die coating is the most favorable technique to scale-up thin film technology that is highly compatible and flexible.3,16,185
Overall, most high PCEs CuCh-based solar cells were fabricated using vacuum deposition methods. The vacuum deposition allows the fabrication of better CuCh crystallinity with lower impurities and defect density of films, especially in the CIGS case.124–126 Nevertheless, the solution process methods have recently attracted various ways.10,186–188 Notably, the solution process offered comparable PCEs with the vacuum method (around 12% in CZTSSe cells,148 and 18% in ternary-CIS cells).27 These results give more confidence to further develop the solution-processable CIGS-based solar cells that so far still exhibit PCE ∼20% using the blade-coating method.189 Furthermore, the development of CuCh-based solar cells with metal doping or post-treatment using the solution process offer more advantages of this technique, as discussed below.
6.1. Vacuum deposition method
Various vacuum deposition methods such as PLD, MBE, thermal co-evaporation, CVD, and sputtering have been used to deposit CuCh thin films (see Fig. 6(a)).124,190–196 However, each method has advantages and disadvantages.16 In general, the vacuum deposition of CuCh films can be divided into two methods; (i) one-step deposition uses a single target precursor,193,196–198 and (ii) co-deposition by means of element deposition using multi-target precursors of CuCh compounds (see illustrations in Fig. 6(b)).124,191,194 One-step deposition has the benefit of time and cost efficiencies. CuCh films can be directly grown by ablating/evaporating the single-CuCh target in a constant S or Se gas environment.193,196–198 However, especially in the case of CIGS, the one-step deposition process is not suitable as it is impossible to control the atomic ratio of each element as the composition grading is necessary to fabricate highly efficient CIGS solar cells. For instance, the top surface near an n-buffer layer with Cu-deficient composition grading improves the VOC of devices.16 In contrast, bottom grading (Ga rich) can increase carrier collection and decrease interface recombination.16 So far, the co-evaporation methods are the most effective methods to produce large-area CuCh films, compatible with industrial mass production.196,197 Overall, these techniques could realize the growth of CuCh films in several deposition steps that can help to tune the different compositional ratios or grading of the films (Fig. 6(b), right-hand side).
 Fig. 6  (a) Various depositions processed in a high vacuum chamber. (b) Mechanism of direct deposition utilizing laser ablation (PLD) as well as Ar+ bombardment (Sputtering) of CuCh target and indirect deposition utilizing evaporation (MBE and co-evaporation) of each element in effusion cells (left and right-hand side panels, respectively). (c) Various depositions process in a non-vacuum environment. (d) Mechanism of electroless deposition utilizing electrochemical reactions and solution deposition process utilizing CuCh solution (ink or paste) precursor deposited via transfer media directly onto substrates (left and right-hand side panels, respectively). 
For instance, PLD is often limited with sample size due to small plume/plasma size because the laser ablation during the PLD growth process only occurs with a limited area. Nevertheless, PLD is beneficial in the simplicity of use, variable pressure environment, and the ability to preserve the stoichiometry of the target material to the deposited material with complex composition under optimum conditions; therefore, it could be used to obtain a high-purity CIGS layer.193 Previous report shows that the bandgap and other optical, as well as transport properties of the CIGS layer, could be tuned by simply changing the annealing temperature and laser frequency during the PLD growth process.193,198 A report shows that the annealing of CIGS deposition during the PLD process could improve the photoresponse of the CIGS layer.193 High-quality complex CZTS compound also could be easily fabricated using the PLD method. The first CZTS-based solar cell prepared by PLD was reported by Moriya et al. in 2007, exhibiting a PCE of 1.7%.199 The PCE of CZTS-based solar cells prepared by PLD then continues to increase, having 3.1%, 4.1%, and then 5.2%.200–203 Although some progress has been made, the device performance results using the PLD method seem not sufficient, and a better understanding of this topic is still needed, as well as the device stability.
Sputtering deposition offers a larger sample size of the thin film sample; however, damage to underlying sensitive device layers (such as the bottom electrode) may occur due to plasma emission and particle impact during the deposition process.204 Nevertheless, the sputtering method could be possibly used to obtain a complete stack of CIGS-based solar cell devices in a one-step process, thus possibly reducing the fabrication cost.205 Similar to other deposition methods, the deposition temperature is important to obtain a high-quality CuCh layer. It was found that a compact film with large grains could be obtained using a substrate temperature of lower than 400 °C; thus, a substrate temperature higher than 400 °C potentially could decrease the cell performance of the CIGS-based solar cells.206 By using the sputtering method, a CIGS-based solar cell with 14.2% of PCE having an aperture area of 51.7 cm2 using Zn(O,S,OH)x buffer layer could be obtained.205 Another report also shows CIGS solar cells with PCE of 15.8% also have been successfully fabricated using a direct sputtering process without Se alloy.207 Despite the good progress and results over a large area of devices demonstrated with the sputtering method, their performances need to be improved with a better understanding of their stability effects.
CVD-based thin film deposition methods have been used to fabricate CIGS-based solar cells, including the CIGS layer and others in multilayer stacks of CIGS-based solar cells.194,208 Interestingly, a high-quality CIGS layer with large grains could be fabricated using low pressure CVD.194 Besides the temperature, the appropriate pressure in vacuum deposition methods could support the formation of a high-quality CIGS layer; it could affect the grain size and level of impurity.194 CVD-based deposition technique is reported to be one of the best methods suitable to deposit a non-toxic buffer layer of In2S3 on top of the CIGS layer with an efficiency of about 16.4%.209 Nevertheless, we cannot find any information on the stability of CIGS growth with CVD due to the lack of information. Further study of CIGS growth with CVD is important because CVD enables the growth of large areas of thin film and is compatible with the industrial process. CVD also has disadvantages, such as the possible emission of toxic gaseous by-products such as silane and phosphine that would form during the chemical reactions.210
Overall, the highest efficiencies of CIGS-based solar cells were fabricated by the thermal co-evaporation method because it is easy to control the composition of the CIGS layer with higher purity.125,211 Co-evaporation method could be conducted through the evaporation of each Cu, In, Ga, and Se element to form the CIGS layer in a multi-stage process.134 Due to this fact, the composition could be controlled well, including easy-to-obtain grading composition of the CIGS layer and achieving the right composition of Se via direct selenization process.134,212 By using the co-evaporation method, not only direct selenization process can be achieved, but also PDT using alkali metal also could be done easily.134 Thus, by using combination method and optimizations, the PCE of CIGS based solar cells above 25% is practically achievable.
6.2. Non-vacuum deposition method
Due to the high production cost and complexity of vacuum fabrication process challenges, researchers have attempted to develop economically simple solution-based methods.187,213–217 The non-vacuum deposition methods require lower energy input and potentially lower production costs than the aforementioned vacuum methods.214–217 It would also enable decisive control of the stoichiometry of films.32 A non-vacuum deposition could be categorized into electrochemical, could be electroless and electroplating deposition (i.e., chemical bath deposition, CBD or electrochemical deposition)187,213 and solution (ink) deposition (i.e., drop/spin/spray coating, R2R printing, doctor-blade or slot-die coating) as illustrated in Fig. 6(c) and (d).48,214–217
For electrochemical deposition, a CuCh dilute solution is prepared. Then, the CuCh film deposition process was carried out using electrochemical and chemical reactions on the surface of the substrates.16,187,213 Briefly, the substrate is dipped into the solution, as illustrated in Fig. 6(d) (left-hand side), and during this process, the current is passed through the solution.218 For instance, 11.7% of CIGS-based solar cell was obtained by using an electrodeposited stacked Cu/In/Ga layer-by-layer onto the substrate.219 Electrodeposited CIGS solar cells employing a layer of elements or binary compounds also have been reported recently, exhibiting PCE of 14.17%,218 and even could reach 15.4% using one-step electrodeposition of Cu, In, Ga, and Se followed by a layer of In, Ga, and Se by evaporation.220,221 However, the lack of stability reports using this method will limit their progress.
The development of CIGS-based solar cells using electrodeposition fabrication also could be done using several ways, such as time-dependent deposition, the effect of pH, variation of applied potential during the deposition process, proper choice of complexing and buffering agents, etc.222 The fabrication of CIGS-based solar cells also could be developed more simply by using a one-step electrodeposition process of CIGS/Mo/glass at atmospheric conditions.223 We also can control the bandgap as well as the thickness of CIGS easily in the electrodeposition methods.224,225 Similar to the previous deposition method, the deposition steps to obtain grading Ga composition also could be done by controlling the current density applied during electrodeposition.218
On the other hand, the solution deposition technique using inks is done by mixing all precursor materials with the desired stoichiometry into organic or aqueous solvents. Then, the deposition process can be done using spraying, air-knife coating (blade or slot-die), or R2R printing onto substrates.187,214–217 Generally, the solution methods are carried out by a two-step process, starting with the deposition of the CuCh precursor layer at a relatively low temperature and then proceeding with the S or Se gas at high-temperature sintering.187,213–217 The sintering process in a controlled S or Se atmosphere is essential to obtain the desired bandgap of high PCE of CIGS-based solar cells.16 Various solution-based fabrication methods could successfully fabricate CIGS-based solar cells with high enough PCE, for instance, 13.6% PCE using doctor-blade coating,187 12.0% PCE using spray coating,226 11.3% PCE using inkjet printing,227 and 10.9% PCE using spray pyrolysis.228
The CuCh-based solar cells might also be produced using an R2R hybrid deposition method. Flexible substrates, such as steel or polyimide foil, enable R2R process technology, ensuring cost-effective production and PV material customization. Polyimide has a significant advantage over steel foil in terms of weight, which is particularly appealing for space applications or building-integrated photovoltaics. Direct solution processing of these semiconductor thin films on flexible substrates via R2R printing has a high potential for producing low-cost and wearable electronic devices. However, the relatively low solubility of metals and chalcogenides in common solvents, in conjunction with impurity contamination (e.g., oxygen and halides), might hinder the development of direct solution methods.229–231
6.3. Optimization strategies of CuCh thin films
Alkali or transition metal doping has been widely studied to improve the quality of CuCh films and the device's performance.10,16,136,232 The doping can be generally done via two possible mechanisms: direct or indirect doping, as illustrated in Fig. 7. By using the direct method, the amount of doping can be controlled precisely compared to indirect doping. We can also vary the type of element doping we will use in direct doping. However, indirect doping offers a simple process, such as simple annealing to incorporate the foreign element doping from the substrate (e.g., Na from SLG substrate) or other complement layers (e.g., Zn from the n-buffer layer). So far, most high PCEs CIGS-based solar cells are obtained using direct doping methods through post-deposition treatment (PDT, with heavy alkali KF, CsF, or RbF).31,134,135 In addition, proper element doping could also benefit from tuning their bandgap and stabilizing their crystal structure or phase.10,16
 Fig. 7  (a) Indirect doping originated from incorporating doping elements from the complement layer, such as Na+ from the bottom glass substrate side and Zn2+ from the upper ZnO n-buffer layer. (b) Direct doping by alloying CuCh with element doping directly on precursor or PDT. 
Alkali metals, including lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), and cesium (Cs), are typically used for doping CuCh thin films. In general, the doping of alkali metals enhanced CuCh thin films’ electrical properties.136,233 Further, the crystal structure of CuCh films could vary according to the size of atomic dopants, i.e., a distinct crystal structure of CuCh compound layer would be observed between the light element (Li+ or Na+ ions) and heavy elements such as Rb+ and Cs+. The light alkaline metal dopant prefers to occupy the Cu2+ site or stay in the grain interior, thereby causing the depletion of the Cu-rich layer that helps for better charge carrier extraction and collection.233 Meanwhile, the larger alkali metals (Rb or Cs) can induce the formation of a secondary phase with Se2+ and In+ near the surface, which then enables to help better charge collection.136,233 In contrast, the K atom, which has a medium size, could influence similarly in both cases.233,234 However, the particular roles of each alkali metal on different CuCh thin films (CIS, CIGS, and CZTS) are still unclear and need more understanding. Further, the combination of alkali metal doping is expected to have a synergetic effect in enhancing devices’ performance and stability.
Apart from alkali metals, some other metal doping, such as antimony (Sb), zinc (Zn), silver (Ag), manganese (Mn), germanium (Ge), and titanium (Ti), have also been introduced to enhance the cell efficiency and stability.10,24,149,235,236 The doping of Sb was found to induce the formation of the favored grain structure of CIGS or CIS thin films under considerably low-temperature conditions and to increase carrier concentration and the lifetime of the solar cells.235,237 The Zn dopant can also help control carrier concentration, but the device performance did not improve significantly.236 On the other hand, Ag has been used for doping in CZTSSe solar cells via solution-processed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).146 The similarity in coordination chemistry between Ag and Cu in the DMSO solution induces the same reaction path of (Ag,Cu)2ZnSn(S,Se) to CZTSSe, which results in substantial suppression of CuZn and CuSn formation that can act as defects.146 As a result, CZTSSe solar cells showed PCE of >12% with significantly reduced VOC-deficit (∼64% of Shockley–Queisser limit).146
Overall, the alkaline and transition metal doping seem to work almost universally on CuCh films (CIS, CIGS, and CZTS).234,238 Nevertheless, there is still a big gap between the lab-scale efficiency of CIGS solar cells (PCE ∼ 23.4% in 1 cm2 per cell) with module PCE of around 19%.16 Module performance is usually limited due to inhomogeneities of CIGS films, resulting in poor CIGS film quality. Further, understanding carrier loss mechanisms at microscopic regions in bulk and interfaces is essential for enhancing thin-film solar cells. Finally, the vital roles of doping on bulk and surface homogeneity over a large-scale area are critical to enhancing the CuCh film quality and reducing the VOC-loss of modules.
7. The roles and development of complement layers
The development of CuCh-based solar cells could be carried out through the heterostructure design of the device. In general, CuCh-based devices are constructed from bottom soda-lime glass/polyimide substrates with molybdenum (Mo) or transparent conducting oxides (TCO) at back contact, followed by a p-type CuCh layer, n-type buffer layer or electron selective contacts (ESLs), another front TCO (i.e., AZO or In-doped ZnO, IZO) and metal electrode as front contact, as shown in Fig. 8(a).

Replotted from ref. 240. (c) Energy level diagram of active layers, ESLs, and HSLs. For reference, the band edges of CuCh active layers are represented as a black bar. Furthermore, a number of these materials exhibit a significant dispersion in the valence and conduction bands.2,238,272–278 (d) Structure of CIGS module with P1, P2, and P3 scribing processes. 
CuCh-based solar cells must be designed rationally with efficient materials and device structure with a complete understanding of their photophysical principles in order to increase their efficiency. Given the inherent high electrical quality of active materials, non-ideal characteristics at the active layer/selective layer interfaces are responsible for a significant portion of power losses in CuCh-based solar cells. These losses can be caused by poor energy band alignment, which results in energy loss during charge extraction, or by non-radiative recombination via recombination-active interface defects, which decrease open-circuit voltage. To date, charge transport optimization has primarily focused on band alignment, with non-radiative recombination handled through defect-passivating interlayers between the active and selective layers. Therefore, several studies have been conducted to optimize and develop proper complement layers aforementioned above.10,16
As the main component to form p–n junction quality, the n-type buffer layers using n-type semiconductors (i.e., CdS, ZnS, ZnO, In2S3, etc.) play an essential role in determining the diode junction quality to improve the contact resistivity with the metal electrode and interface recombination.239 In addition, to increase internal quantum efficiency, it is essential to improve the optical properties of the transparent n-type buffer layers with high transmittance to reduce parasitic optical loss.
These n-type buffer layers can be prepared using scalable deposition methods such as CVD, ALD, or RF sputter methods.20,240 Various n-type semiconductors have been experimentally and theoretically studied as n-buffer for CuCh-based solar cells, significantly affecting the PCE.10,16Fig. 8(b) indicates several options for the n-buffer layer with theoretical simulation efficiencies.240 Thanks to the high electrical conductivity of ZnS, the theoretical simulation and experimental results showed higher PCEs than conventional CdS layers.240 The wider bandgap of ZnO or ZnS could reduce parasitic absorption losses at blue responses, enhancing the JSC of devices (see above).10 Further, several strategies have been investigated to modify the n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor layer's electrical conductivity and n-type characters (such as doping with metals, small organic and organic self-assembled molecules, or conjugated polyelectrolytes) that can potentially enhance the PCEs of CuCh-based solar cells.88,241–247
In addition, other high bandgap n-type layers such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) could give more advantages to alternative n-type layers and need further investigation.21,22 The n-buffer layer also could have a different impact on the light-soaking effect that usually occurs in CuCh-based solar cells.248,249 For instance, the increased PCE after increasing the light soaking time with the use of ZnMgO (ZMO) buffer layer was because of the increase in FF and VOC.249 During light soaking, the electron carrier concentration of the ZMO layer significantly increased, tuning the Fermi level of ZMO with the CIGS films. On the other hand, the defective vacancies at the CIGS/n-buffer interface could also be the reason for the need for light soaking of solar cells. For instance, light soaking increases the photo-generated charge carrier that can neutralize the defective vacancies at the CIGS/ZnS interface.250 In addition, the light soaking also helps to distribute the alkali ions from the doping strategy in the CIGS bulk and interfaces.251 Therefore, the reason for the enhancement of the performance of CuCh solar cells after light soaking can come from several factors.
Next, the electrical back contact layer collects the hole or blocks the electron from the p-type CuCh layer.252 So far, most champion high-efficiency CuCh solar cells are based on Mo back contact, mostly fabricated through vacuum sputtering. In addition, the Mo back contact layer can act as an anti-reflection coating to maximize light absorption in the CuCh active layer. The Mo layer often causes chemical degradation due to its oxidation at interfaces between the Mo and CuCh layer in the presence of oxygen and moisture.253 Therefore, inert or vacuum fabrication is needed. Further, robust encapsulation is critical in preventing external agents such as oxygen and moisture from entering the devices. However, the robust back contact layer may still be needed to prevent initial degradation during the encapsulation step, mostly done under ambient air.21 The commercially available TCOs such as fluorine-tin-oxide (FTO) or indium-tin-oxide (ITO) have been investigated as an alternative.252,254 These commercial TCO substrates provide excellent transparency (85% at 550 nm) and relatively low sheet resistance (10–20 Ω sq−1) to fabricate semi-transparent solar cells.252 However, their device's performance showed a relatively lower PCE of <20% in the case of CIGS solar cells.252,254 The reason is the increased resistivity of TCO's during CuCh layer deposition at a high temperature, which can be a limiting factor to using TCO as substrates. In this sense, developing a low-temperature processed CuCh layer is important to realize semi-transparent solar cells that can work as bifacial CuCh solar cells, as today's PV technology has shifted to bifacial solar module technology.252 Finally, the development of front-side TCO (AZO or IZO) and antireflection coating (MgF2) is also important to further improve the performance of CuCh-based solar cells.
Some interlayers are also important to minimize the non-radiative recombination at the interfaces. For instance, MoCh such as MoSe2 or MoS2 could appear at the interface between the Mo electrode layer and CuCh absorber layer. The formation of MoCh could have a positive impact; for instance, the formation of MoSe2 during the CIGS process should minimize the negative effect of the Schottky barrier on solar cell performances, especially with a large Schottky barrier.255 MoSe2 layer could serve as a tunneling barrier providing a quasi-ohmic back contact behavior as well as creating a back surface electric field due to its wider bandgap than that of the CIGS absorber.256 However, the MoSe2 often becomes unstable, which will deteriorate the stability of solar cells. As an alternative, Ga grading, by means of deliberately putting more Ga components at the rear side of the CIGS layer towards the CIGS/Mo interface, seems more favorable to creating a back surface field and sweeping electrons away from reaching Mo back contact and towards the front contact, thereby increasing the collection efficiency.257 As a result, the highest PCE of >23% can be obtained with better stability of devices.
In addition, for the top side interlayer, the interface structure and morphology of CIGS are significant in the formation and elemental inter-diffusion at the n-buffer layer/CIGS interfaces.10,257 For instance, somehow, the interdiffusion of the n-buffer layer on the outer interface of the CIGS layer could induce the better formation of p–n homojunction and reduce the recombination. The interface quality between the n-buffer layer/CIGS also influences the degree of contaminant at the p–n junction, as well as the presence of compositional deviations and vacancy defects.10,257 One of the advantages of doping is to improve the interfacial condition among the layers in the CuCh-based solar cells.10,257 The interface between CuCh and the n-buffer layer also should be sufficient. The referred surface defect layer that exists in between the CuCh absorber layer and n-buffer layers could increase the absorber bandgap at the interfaces by lowering the valence band maximum with respect to the Fermi level and thus reduces the interface recombination rate.256 To avoid volume and interface recombination in the CuCh/n-buffer layer, it is also essential to remove the electronic junction of the physical junction rich in detrimental defects.258 In this case, a surface inversion could be conducted by generating a Ga gradient on the surface of the absorber with an n-buffer layer.258
Not only doping but a proper choice of deposition method is also important to improve the interface condition in CuCh-based solar cells. For instance, CdS is a common n-buffer layer used in CIGS-based solar cells and is found to reduce the detrimental defects at the interfaces between CIGS and CdS layers to minimize the recombination of carriers, and the chemical bath deposition method to deposit the CdS layer on top of CIGS layer become one of the best strategies.258 When we use a more environmentally friendly n-buffer layer of ZnO instead of CdS, a special strategy to improve the interface between ZnO and CuCh layer also should be taken into account to obtain high PCE. For instance, in the CIGS/ZnO interface, a negative conduction band offset of −0.2 eV was previously obtained. Thus, by avoiding a negative discontinuity between the ZnO and CIGS layers, the buffer layer allows the optimal alignment of the conduction bands.258 In addition, the interfacial condition between CuCh and the bottom electrode is also important. Ga grading in the CuCh layer, as we explained previously, is one of the strategies to improve the interface between the CuCh layer and the bottom electrode.257
Another approach to improve the Cu-based active layer/TCO interface is to use hole-selective interlayers (HSL), which may improve charge collection. Thin layers of transition-metal oxides (TMOs) have long been used as hole-selective contacts in emerging solar cells due to their high work function and low-temperature deposition. Furthermore, they have such high optical transparency. TMOs may therefore have the necessary characteristics to improve the back interface of Cu-based solar cells fabricated on transparent SLG/FTO or SLG/ITO substrates. TMOs have already been successfully investigated as hole extractors in inorganic PV on CdTe,259 CIGS,260 kesterites, and, more recently, c-Si solar cells.261 However, so far, only the combination of Mo oxides with opaque back-contacts has been extensively documented in the case of Cu-based solar cells.
Ranjbar et al., for instance, applied a 10 nm MoO3 layer on top of Mo, which significantly improved the minority carrier lifetime and VOC of the devices.262 Furthermore, Antunez et al. improved the VOC of a high-efficiency (>11%) CZTSSe device by exfoliating it from its SLG/Mo substrate and placing a new MoO3 (20 nm)/Au (100 nm) back-contact onto it.263 Similarly, Liu et al. discovered comparable effects on Cd-doped devices and attributed them to a shift in band alignment that promoted electron back-reflection.264 Lastly, López-Marino et al. discovered a 67 mV increase in VOC by using a thin (20 nm) MoO2 interlayer within a trilayer Mo configuration as a selenization barrier in CZTSe devices.265 Nonetheless, there has been little research into TMOs’ potential as hole-selective layers in Cu-based solar cells fabricated on transparent substrates.
The main issue in CZTS or CZTSe devices based on SLG/FTO is shunting, which can be considerably reduced by stacking selenized Mo:Na nanolayers on top of the FTO. TMOs, on the other hand, have been found to be especially damaging to devices by generating various current-blocking behavior. The combination of Mo:Na with 10 nm layers of the n-type TMOs TiO2 and V2O5 has allowed for the creation of high-efficiency devices. The observed improvements appear to be associated with both shunt insulation and recombination reduction. It is clear that using TMO and/or Mo:Na nanolayers is a very efficient way to improve kesterite devices' performance when the devices are fabricated on transparent substrates.266 As an alternative to typical SLG/Mo solar cells, Hernández et al. demonstrated a 3.9% of semitransparent CZTSe-based solar cell device with V2Ox ALD films as a hole-selective layer on transparent SLG/FTO substrates. This finding opens the door for the use of ALD V2Ox films on high-efficiency bifacial and/or semitransparent solar systems incorporated into buildings.267
Finally, as previously stated, the incorporation of potential hole-selective and electron-selective materials into the device requires careful consideration of electronic band alignment. TMO, small organic molecules, and polymers are examples of these materials. The ability to overcome performance limits is driving the rapid growth of this research topic, which is essentially an extension of studies on metal/semiconductor contacts. The use of CdS as a conventional electron selective contact and hole transport layer, as shown in the electronic band alignment diagram in Fig. 8(c), allows only a limited range of band gaps and work functions, limiting the optical and electrical design of the contact. Metal oxides, on the other hand, introduce more diverse materials with a broader range of work functions, as well as potentially more suitable optical characteristics for the device's front and back sides (such as wider bandgaps for increased transparency of high energy photons, reduced parasitic free-carrier absorption at the front device, and a broader range of refractive indices for the optimal front ARC).2 Furthermore, such materials can be produced using simple, low-temperature physical vapor deposition or even solution-based processing techniques, effectively reducing fabrication costs over CdS contacts.
Lastly, a CIGS module on various substrates can be fabricated following the single-junction structure with more critical P1, P2, and P3 patterning, as shown in Fig. 8(d). P1, P2, and P3 are common steps in fabricating solar PV modules, including CIGS. P1 is a step to remove a sole Mo layer from the substrate, while the P2 step is the removal of the CIGS and CdS layers from the Mo layer, and lastly, P3 is a removal step of the TCO (mostly AZO) layer.268 P1, P2, and P3 can be executed using laser and/or mechanical scribes. Laser ablation can execute the P1 process of the Mo layer because it requires a tiny scribe edge for a Mo layer. Thus, layer removal in the P1 process can be accomplished with the lesser selective nanosecond (ns) laser pulse ablation.268 However, laser scribing has several disadvantages, such as excessive heat dissipation.269 Therefore, the mechanical scribe is suitable for avoiding layer degradation due to heat dissipation, especially for P2 and P3 scribing.270 P1 and P3 processes are conducted to obtain electrical isolation between the cells. At the same time, P2 generates an electrical contact between the Mo layer as a positive electrode and the TCO layer as a negative electrode.268,270 Several developments in P1, P2, and P3 patterning have been reported, such as using a pulse programmable industrial fiber laser,271 and picosecond laser-induced selective removal of functional layers.268
8. Flexible and wearable solar cells
Overall, CuCh thin films could be fabricated using various deposition methods that are scalable on rigid glass and flexible plastic substrates, benefiting many PV module applications.10,16,48,279 Various flexible substrates have been used to realize flexible CuCh-based devices using metal, ceramics, or plastic substrates (see Fig. 9).34,126 Flexible and lightweight CuCh-based solar cells grown on flexible substrates are a promising technology with rapidly growing market prospects. However, the relatively lower PCEs of flexible devices could be attributed to limited temperature processing compared to high PCEs of cells grown at high temperatures on rigid glass substrates. Therefore, developing low-temperature CuCh deposition is essential to realize high PCEs of lightweight and flexible CuCh-based solar cells. Further, alkaline doping was initially emphasized through indirect bottom-up Na doping from soda-lime glass, while most flexible substrates do not contain alkaline elements. Therefore, the direct PDT method should be the most effective way to improve CuCh-based flexible solar cells with the combination of alkali metals, as discussed above.
 Fig. 9  The features of metal, ceramic, and plastic substrates and several designs of flexible CIGS solar cells on various substrates. Redrawn from reference and photo source from https://www.aliexpress.com/ for stainless steel (bottom left-hand side), https://www.corning.com/ for corning willow glass (bottom middle), and https://www.koreaherald.com/ for transparent polyimide (bottom right-hand side).282 
First, the Ti, Mo, Al, Cu, or stainless steel metals have been employed to fabricate CuCh solar cells as flexible metal substrates.16,212 The advantage of using these flexible metal substrates is that they can withstand high-temperature processing with high environmental stability. However, these metal substrates generally have rough surfaces that negatively affect CuCh crystallization and usually contain metallic impurities that easily react with S or Se gas.10,16 Therefore, the deposition of intermediate barrier layers (i.e., aluminum oxide, Al2O3 or silicon oxide, SiOx) as diffusion barriers is required to solve the issues mentioned above as a required additional step.10,16,280 Further, the semi-flexible properties of these metal substrates limit their application for many portable device applications and are only possible for opaque solar cells.
Like metal substrates, the ceramic substrate could operate at higher temperatures than the glass and polymer substrates due to its higher thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability and low porosity.281 In contrast, ceramic substrates are resistant to chemical and moisture attacks, unlike metal substrates.282 Therefore, it could avoid the formation of impurities in the entire solar cell layers during the selenization/sulfurization process. The surface roughness of the ceramic substrates is also typically much smaller than metal substrates, which could support avoiding dislocation that would induce a defect through the entire layers.10,281 A flexible ceramic of zirconia substrate also has been utilized for flexible solar cells, CZTSSe, with a PCE of 11.5%.283 However, the poor ductility and brittle nature of ceramic substrates compromise their flexibility, resulting in a low maximum permissible bend radius than metal foils and polymer plastic substrates. Improving the flexibility of the ceramic substrates is a challenging task. One can be realized by further reducing the thickness and developing new ceramic material with superior flexibility.282
On the contrary, polymer plastic substrates (i.e., polyimide, polyethylene terephthalate, polytetrafluoroethylene) have smoother surfaces that can help better CuCh crystallization or growth with better transparency for semi-transparent solar cells.16,212,284 In addition, the plastic substrate can realize ultra-flexible solar cells that offer more benefits for lightweight, flexible, and wearable solar cell applications. However, due to the polymer's natural intrinsic property of having low glass transition temperatures, these polymer substrates cannot withstand processing at high temperatures (typically lower than 200 °C).16 Therefore, the low-temperature fabrication of CuCh is crucially important without being detrimental to the quality of CuCh-films concerning scalable deposition methods, as discussed above.10,16,280
The research trend of flexible solar cells has gained interest because of the increasing demand for lightweight devices with high bending durability for wearable optoelectronic applications.285Fig. 10(a) shows a flexible CIGS-based model available in the market. The technological capability to produce flexible and large-area solar cell modules with homogeneous properties is essential to improve the PCE of flexible devices further.286 Recently, the PCE of CIGS on rigid module size (670 cm2) showed a PCE of around 19% and typically around 15% on flexible modules in the market.5,287–289 Notably, the flexible CZTS-based solar cells can be realized for wearable optoelectronic applications such as in textiles, as shown in Fig. 10(b). Overall, CuCh-based flexible solar cells can be directly laminated onto textile materials via thermoplastic polyurethane foils287 and via an adhesive-bonding transfer method.290 In addition, CIGS has been integrated into backpack bags with an efficiency of around 15%, which are also ready in the market (Fig. 10(c)).289,291 Further, flexible CIGS modules could also be installed on the car roof, like a polycrystalline Si case (Fig. 10(d)).282 Placing flexible solar panels on the roof of a car park not only beautifies the parking but also provides shade for vehicles (Fig. 10(e)).292 Considering the low toxicity and flexibility aspects, along with complementing layers and substrates, these CuCh materials could enable the use of solar cells for wearable or portable devices soon.

9. Stability and toxicity aspects: possible enhanced marketability
So far, there are limited studies about the long-term stability of these CuCh thin films in lab-scale devices. The reason is the limited encapsulation technique for small-area devices on the lab scale. However, the major stability problem in CIGS or CIS solar cells mostly comes from the interfaces between active layers and charge-selecting contacts (both window and n-buffer layers).16 Therefore, revisiting new device engineering with robust charge selecting contact will be crucial for this PV technology.10,16 Meanwhile, there are several remaining issues in CuCh solar cells, such as defects induced by visible light, Cu2+ ion migration, back contact instability, encapsulation, etc., which need to be further understood.293 Nevertheless, the stability of encapsulated CIS or CIGS solar modules has been tested outdoors under extreme conditions for over two decades with a degradation rate of around 2 to 4% per year, indicating the potential high stability of these modules.294 In addition, the significant losses of those modules are mainly from FF and VOC values, which is strongly related to an increase in the series resistance that probably comes from interface failures.294 For instance, it was found that defects and degradation of CdS/ZnO layers lead to poor conductivity or damage to the CdS/CIGS interface. In contrast, the degradation of the top ZnO window layer or CdS/CIGS interface leads to an increase in series resistance and loss in FF.294 In addition, the VOC-losses could initially be degraded due to defect density and conduction band offsets between p–n junction interfaces.16,294 On the back electrical contact Mo side, the degradation mechanism will be minimized since most modules will be encapsulated.16
The CIS, CIGS, and CZTS are chemically stable under harsh conditions such as heat and humidity for the photoactive materials.295 However, in particular, there is no report yet on the long-term stability of CZTS cells in the literature under outdoor or indoor tests. This may raise some speculations if the CZTS cells are still not ready for commercialization, featuring their low PCE.295 On the other hand, the CIS and CIGS cells have passed several accelerated industrial stability tests (following International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 61215)) such as damp-heat stress, illumination, high bias voltage tests, etc. These ICE tests still become a major issue for other thin-film PV technologies, such as metal-halide perovskites and organic solar cells.294 Therefore, passing those IEC tests confirm the reliability of developing CIGS technology and their potential for enhancing commercialization products.
Not only stability aspects but the toxicity of materials used in the solar cells also becomes another homework for researchers. In most cases, highly toxic metals such as lead (Pb) or cadmium (Cd) are used to produce highly efficient thin-film solar cells, including CuCh. Notably, the prediction of solar cell installation will keep increasing, and the toxicity issue will generate human health hazards.296 Exposure will occur either during the development and production of solar cells or at the end-of-life stage, especially toxic materials can leach into landfills and subsequently into the environment and impact the ecosystem directly or indirectly through edible plants or drinking water.296 As a consequence, it will limit the commercialization and distribution of CuCh PV modules and restrict the use of CuCh cells for wearable optoelectronic devices. As noted, specific regions, such as European countries, are very strict about prohibiting the use of toxic metals (Pb and Cd), following the European Union regulations. Many attempts have been conducted to decrease the toxicity of CuCh-based solar cells, such as replacing CdS with ZnS layers, with successful results, as discussed above. On the other hand, using a green technology approach, such as avoiding hydrazine (one of the highly toxic and reactive solvents) post-treatment, has also been developed.
After proofing their stability and environmental safety aspects, the final task will be reducing the LCOE to further improve the current percentage of CIGS modules in the marketplace. Module manufacturing cost is mainly composed of material cost, depreciation, utilities, labor, and maintenance. The dominant cost is the material cost, accounting for around 60% of their total costs.297 As a result, the lower material costs will significantly reduce manufacturing costs, which will be realized with the expansion of the industrialization scale. Overall, reducing the LCOE can be done by the following: (i) lowering raw materials prices of the module, (ii) increasing module efficiency while maintaining similar module prices, and (iii) improving the lifetime of the module up to 30–50 years from only 20–25 years. Overall, the fabrication cost of CIGS modules (around 38 $ per m) is still slightly higher than the c-Si module cost (around 33 $ per m).297 It comes from the higher prices of pure raw materials used, such as In and Ga, and is predicted to increase due to the likely increased demand in the future. However, higher crustal abundance sources of these elements will help reduce their future costs.298
On the other hand, CZTS contains much cheaper elements (for all cases of Cu, Zn, Sn, and S or Se) than In, Ga, or even Si elements.298 However, the higher module cost (41 $ per m) of CZTS will limit this technology from competing with CIGS or c-Si solar cells.34 Further, we expect that it is still challenging to replace CIGS since CIGS has almost two times higher PCE than CZTS. In this sense, cost savings could be achieved by finding a way to reduce the fabrication cost by developing simple fabrication methods and equipment.34 So far, CIGS modules have been fabricated using vacuum deposition methods and require high-purity chemical precursors, making them more expensive. Therefore, the manufacturing cost of CIGS modules could be reduced by using all solution deposition methods due to the lower raw material price. Typically, the solution-processed uses metal salts obtained from ores with less purity.298 However, the work to improve the performance and stability using all-solution processed CIGS solar cells is still needed, with the module's PCE goal to be at least >20%. Therefore, it would open more possibilities to enhance the market share of CIS/CIGS technologies; and enhance the competitiveness compared to commercial c-Si or other thin film technology such as metal-halide perovskites in the future, which currently still have less than 2% of the market share.299
10. Summary and outlooks
Generally, CuCh-based thin films consist of non-toxic elements and can be synthesized from binary to ternary and quaternary mainly as photoactive materials for eco-friendly PV devices. However, both binary and ternary PCEs are still limited by less than 20% due to difficulty in controlling the impurity of films. Thus, the higher quality of single-phase quaternary-CIGS films can be obtained by adding gallium atoms in the ternary CIS system. As a result, the fabricated CIGS solar cells with a maximum PCE of over 23% have been demonstrated. These devices were developed recently without a toxic layer, such as CdS n-buffer layer, and typically use more environmentally benign n-buffer layers to support the low toxicity of CIGS. It should be noted that other types of thin films, such as metal-halide perovskite and organic solar cells, have stability and toxicity issues on elemental materials used or solvents for processing compared to CIGS solar cells.
10.1. Strategies to improve performance and stability
Overall, the following approaches can be used to further improve the PCE of modules: (i) enhancing JSC by maximizing absorption of the CIGS layer using novel doping methods and utilizing a Cd-free large bandgap window layer, and (ii) enhancing VOC by lowering defect density by using surface passivation on both sides of the CIGS layer to reduce recombination losses at interfaces. Those two important points could be achieved by finding the proper choice of doping and complement layers. Alkali doping has become the most used element additive to improve the performance of the solar cell, while Mo is the most used bottom-hole contact in high PCE CuCh-based solar cells. The flexible fabrication methods from solution and dry vacuum processes give more room to optimize the CuCh thin film quality. For instance, it influences the film quality, including the defect, purity, and uniformity of CuCh thin films to achieve pinhole-free films. In addition, with the combination of proper fabrication methods and optimizations as discussed above, the PCE of CIGS-based solar cells can be practically achieved close to c-Si (PCE > 26%) with realistic outdoor testing for up to 25 years.
10.2. Boosting potential commercialization
Promising PCEs with the more optional fabrication of CIGS thin films have been demonstrated. However, several remaining issues need to be addressed to further improve the PCE of CIGS modules. So far, the best-performing CIGS solar cells have been fabricated primarily using the vacuum method, which will adversely affect the production cost due to the requirement of high-purity starting materials and expensive film deposition equipment. The high-efficiency CIGS-based solar cells were fabricated by thermal co-evaporation due to the ease of controlling the composition of the CIGS layer with higher purity. Alternatively, fabricating CIGS with a non-vacuum method, such as a solution process that does not require high purity of starting materials and with a relatively simple process, will reduce the production cost and LCOE of modules. It should be noted that the solution process using the R2R printing method is the best approach to fabricating a low-temperature flexible CIGS module with minimal residual material waste.
To boost the PCE of devices further, combining wide-bandgap materials such as metal-halide perovskite as front cells have been demonstrated to enhance the PCE of CIGS-based tandem to above 25% on rigid and flexible devices. However, to realize eco-friendly PV tandem modules, finding some Pb-free wide-bandgap with desired bandgap and efficiency is essential for this technology in the future. It should be noted the current state-of-the-art performance of flexible solar cells might open new paths for wearable and portable devices. In fact, the product already exists in the market for wearable integrated solar cells with a cell efficiency of around 19%. For this reason, apart from high cell performance and low toxicity, lightweight and flexible devices are essential for further development.
