    , Accepted 27th April 2020First published on 27th April 2020AbstractEnvironmentally friendly energy sources such as solar and wind power as alternatives to fossil fuels are strategic for meeting the energy needs of an increasingly demanding population, but they are periodic or intermittent in nature, making energy storage devices fundamental for the realization of a sustainable society. Thus, the quest for much higher power and energy dense devices, especially hybrid supercapacitors, as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, has been scaling up since the combining of the outstanding power density of supercapacitive materials with the high energy density of battery-type materials into a single device. Despite their high resistance, transition metal oxides are promising electrode materials for use in devices, since their rich electrochemistry can be activated by three main strategies to boost the specific charge capacity, charge–discharge and ion diffusion kinetics, and cyclability of devices via: (a) the incorporation of hetero-atoms that generate trimetallic oxides, (b) nanostructuration via hierarchical core@shell furry and mesoporous systems, and (c) combination with other materials to generate nanocomposites. These strategies, especially those leading to highly porous 3D core@shell architecture nanomaterials, are very successful, where trimetallic oxides, and ternary TLDHs and multicomponent systems, realized via the combination of mono- and/or bimetallic oxides and hydroxides, have demonstrated exceptionally good performances as electrode materials, presenting bright new perspectives for the future of hybrid energy storage devices.Josué M.

1. Introduction
In recent years, population growth and economic-social development have dramatically increased energy consumption, promoting the depletion of non-renewable resources while pushing environmental pollution to alarming levels. Therefore, the development of alternative technologies to enable us to obtain energy from clean, more abundant and environmentally friendly sources such as solar and wind power is urgent.1,2 However, considering that they are not continuous energy sources, but periodic or intermittent, the progress just in such a direction is not enough, and complementary systems and devices capable of efficiently storing and releasing, or converting the energy into convenient forms of energy as required, is of utmost importance. Among the energy storage systems, the electrochemical based ones can be highlighted, especially secondary batteries, electrochemical capacitors and supercapacitors (SCs).3,4
Among them, the lithium-ion battery exhibits advantages such as unbeatable long life cycle and energy density, being the most commercialized secondary battery type in the world, but the shortage and increasing extraction costs of lithium ores are impacting negatively their production and inflating prices.5,6 For this reason, competitive alternatives to lithium-ion secondary batteries must be developed in order to increase the diversity of available energy storage systems and assure a more sustainable future, where SCs stand out as one of the most promising electrochemical devices.
Many review articles on electrode materials for supercapacitors have been reported in the literature, but, to the best of our knowledge, they are all related to electrode materials mainly based on mono- and bimetallic oxides7,8 and layered double hydroxides (LDH).9,10 For example, Low et al.7 have summarized the recent developments on mixed transition metal oxide (MTMO) and graphene/MTMO based hybrid nanostructured materials for advanced supercapacitors, but without focusing on trimetallic oxides. They discussed the current evolution of MTMOs and their composites with graphene nanosheets for electrode materials, presenting a comprehensive overview of the synthetic approaches. In addition, the critical factors that influence the electrochemical activity of MTMO-based materials were also delineated. Similarly, Patel et al.11 summarized the recent developments in transition-metal-based LDHs tailored for energy conversion and storage. This review was restricted to bimetallic nickel cobalt LDHs (NiCo-LDHs), classified according to the fabrication method for application in supercapacitors. They discussed the ex situ and in situ growth of the LDH material on the current collectors, and how the preparation method can affect the crystal structure as well as the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. Analogously, Yan and collaborators12 discussed the future development of bimetallic NiMn-LDHs for supercapacitor application. They also provided preparation methods, structural design and chemical modification strategies, in addition to methods for the preparation of composites and films of NiMn-LDH materials. Although all of these reviews mentioned the applications of oxide and LDH-based materials in supercapacitors, the field of trimetallic oxides and LDHs as positive electrodes has evolved rapidly in the last few years.
In fact, the number of works in that direction have grown fast and a systematization is required when it comes to the emerging trimetallic oxides and trimetallic LDHs, as well as multi-component ternary systems based on metal oxides/LDHs as positive electrode materials of hybrid supercapacitors (Scheme 1). Therefore, this review is intended to offer readers a comprehensive overview on the most recent advances in the field, especially on how strategies such as the replacement and insertion of heteroatoms in electrode materials, nanostructuration, active site engineering based on the control of crystalline phase and morphology, and their incorporation in conducting materials to realize composites, can influence the electrochemical performance of hybrid SC electrode materials, more specifically cathode materials. Finally, the most relevant electrochemical data of those electrode materials are summarized as tables, where an additional column has been inserted to list their specific capacitances (F g−1) as specific charge capacity (C g−1) for comparison purposes, while keeping the metric originally used by the authors throughout the text. We consider such unit conversion relevant since almost all electrode materials cited in this review are battery-type and do not show capacitive electrochemical behavior.

1.1 Supercapacitive vs. battery-type materials; symmetric/asymmetric vs. hybrid devices
Supercapacitors can be classified as (1) electric double layer capacitor (EDLC), (2) pseudocapacitor and (3) supercapacitor devices.13 These definitions can be better understood when the electrochemical profile of the respective electrode material (Fig. 1) is analyzed in more depth. The main differences between EDLCs and pseudocapacitors are the charge storage mechanism, the electrode material and its electrochemical behavior. EDLCs are generally based on carbon materials that exhibit purely non-faradaic (only capacitive) behavior, where energy is stored as electric charge accumulated at the electrode–electrolyte interface. In contrast, pseudocapacitive materials strongly depend on faradaic processes and are based on redox materials such as transition metal oxides (RuO2 and MnO2),14,15 carbides,16 nitrides,17 and conducting polymers,18 but presenting capacitor-like charge–discharge electrochemical behavior. The pseudocapacitance originates from the interplay of both (i) faradaic processes related to the metallic center and (ii) non-faradaic processes related to the electric double layer at the electrode material interface.19

In fact, it is possible to observe that they have a rectangular CV profile within a potential range (Fig. 1A and B), and that the potential decays linearly (at a constant current) as a function of time during a galvanostatic charge–discharge process (Fig. 1C). In contrast to such typical capacitive or pseudocapacitive behavior, battery-type materials exhibit a completely different electrochemical behavior and the cyclic voltammograms show a pair of waves related to oxidation and reduction processes (Fig. 1D and E), whereas the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves are characterized by a plateau where the potential remains almost constant while the faradaic process takes place (Fig. 1F).
Despite the clear definition presented above, many electrode materials based on nickel hydroxide and other metal oxides/hydroxides that exhibit purely faradaic behavior that should be classified as battery-type materials are being classified as pseudocapacitive materials in the literature. Accordingly, the concept of capacitance is not appropriate for such materials, the metrics of which should be described based on the concept of charge capacity (C, Coulomb or mA h) instead of capacitance (F).20
Furthermore, supercapacitive materials tend to have low energy density but much higher power density compared to battery-type materials. This behavior is a consequence of their high electrical conductivity and low charge density in contrast with electron and ion diffusion controlled faradaic processes. Pseudocapacitive materials have enhanced energy densities but at the expense of much slower kinetics. In addition, since the usability of these energy storage devices is strongly dependent on the output voltage, the potential profiles during the discharge of battery-type materials are much more interesting than those of supercapacitive materials, especially when associated with the very fast charge–discharge processes of supercapacitive materials. In short, the focus is on the development of electrode materials that could merge the desired characteristics of both, supercapacitive and battery-type materials, in order to realize high performance energy storage devices built on flexible and lightweight electrodes with enhanced energy and power densities.
Shifting to devices, SCs can be classified according to the anode and cathode materials as (i) symmetric, (ii) asymmetric and (iii) hybrid.21 In symmetric SCs, the anode (negative electrode) and the cathode (positive electrode) are made from the same supercapacitive material, which can be either EDLC or pseudocapacitive type21 such as graphene//graphene22 and RuO2//RuO2,23 whilst asymmetric and hybrid SCs are built on different electrode materials.
Indeed, asymmetric SCs are made of two distinct electrode materials, where the anode and cathode can be respectively an EDLC and a pseudocapacitive material,24 such as in activated carbon//MnO2 devices. Likewise to asymmetric SCs, hybrid supercapacitors use different types of electrode materials, but a supercapacitive material (EDLC or pseudocapacitive) such as activated carbon is combined with a battery-type material instead,21 for instance NiO or Ni(OH)2,25 PbO2,26 and LiMn2O4.27 Consequently, hybrid SCs can easily merge the best of both worlds into one device, with the high energy density typical of battery-type materials with the long life cycle and power density characteristics of supercapacitors.
2. Why trimetallic oxides?
Most recent works have been focused on battery-type positive electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitors, made from non-noble transition metal oxides. Specifically, there has been great interest concentrated on those that have multivalence, as well as fast charge diffusion and reversible faradaic reactions associated with high theoretical energy capacity, since they can provide substantially greater specific capacitances than electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC).28–30
Hydrated IrO2 and RuO2 noble-metal oxides are pseudocapacitive materials that provide specific capacitances, respectively, of 550 and 720 F g−1, thus being ideally suited to be the positive electrode materials of symmetric and asymmetric devices.31 However, their high cost and scarcity have restricted practical application,28,30,32 such that, more recently, they have been replaced by cheaper, more abundant and environmentally friendly materials based on first and second row transition metal oxides, such as NiO, Co3O4, MnO2, Fe2O3, MoO3, V2O5, CuO and ZnO, and spinel oxides (with the composition M3O4, where M = metal ions).28,30,33–35 Those based on Co, Ni and Mn ions have been the most studied, due to their superior cost-effectiveness and controllable morphology and composition. Such characteristics allow the development of materials with improved electrochemical properties compared to their EDLC-type and noble-metal oxide-based counterparts.
Even though transition metal oxides are one of the most promising materials for application in SCs, the use of monometallic oxides is quite limited. For example, Co3O4 and NiO as battery-type, and MnO2 as pseudocapacitive electrode materials, have attracted much attention because of their high theoretical energy capacities of 892 mA h g−1 (ref. 36) and 718 mA h g−1,37 respectively, and specific capacitance of 1370 F g−1.38–40 However, they show high intrinsic resistances, preventing energy storage and charge–discharge performances from reaching acceptable values under operating conditions. Nevertheless, mixed transition metal oxide materials with several advantages, and truly enhanced properties in comparison with the respective monometallic transition metal oxides, can be prepared by combining two or three metal ions in a synergistic way through morphologic and composition control. The most evident ones are enhanced electronic conductivity, ion-diffusion rate, mechanical and chemical stability, electrochemical activity, and relatively low activation energy for electron transfer between the metal centers. These are mainly as a consequence of the several possible redox sites and oxidation states available in multimetallic systems, as well as larger concentrations of active sites that contributing to an increase in charge diffusion rates.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review focusing on homogeneous trimetallic oxide-based materials for application as positive battery electrodes in the literature. The objective of this review is to fill such a gap, thus providing a thorough overview on the strategies to realize more efficient anode materials for the assembly of hybrid supercapacitors with the highest possible performance. To facilitate our discussion, we summarized all significant results in the literature on this theme in Table 1, and this account is divided in three-main sub-topics to explore the strategies that have been used to impart materials with what is loosely called “synergistic effects” and improve the electrochemical performance of trimetallic oxide-based materials compared to their mono- and bimetallic counterparts, more specifically by hetero-atom incorporation (2.1), formation of nanocomposites (2.2), and hierarchical core@shell nanostructuration (2.3).

2.1. Improvement in electrochemical performance via the incorporation of hetero-atoms
Bi and trimetallic oxide materials can be roughly divided in two types: heterogeneous and homogeneous. The homogeneous ones are those prepared by isomorphic substitution with no evidence of segregation or the presence of a second phase, and can be considered as pure materials, whereas the heterogeneous ones are those better characterized as mixtures. Homogeneous trimetallic transition metal oxides are generally based on spinel structure oxides (M3O4, where M = transition metal ion), especially Co3O4,28,33–35,39–46,54,56–58,61–67 and a few on Fe3O4.38,49,55,68 Most of the former derivatives were prepared via isomorphic substitution of Co ions by Ni ions in the lamellar structure, producing bimetallic NixCo3−xO4 and trimetallic MxNiyCo3−x−yO4 oxides, where M is a third transition metal ion, most commonly Zn and Mn ions.28,31,34,35,39,41–43,50–52,54,56–58,61,64,66,69–72 Interestingly, the substitution of Co and Fe ions in Co3O4 and Fe3O4 by transition metal ions such as Ni, Mn, Zn and Cu does not seem to change the spinel crystalline structure and provides many synergistic effects depending on the element and its proportion. At this point, it is important to mention that the lamellar structure enhances the concentration of electrochemically active sites, since the electrolyte solution can diffuse more easily into the interlamellar space, avoiding charge build up and thus activating the redox sites.
In this context, Kumar et al. (2019)52 synthesized a Zn/Ni-doped Co3O4 trimetallic transition metal oxide (ZnxNiyCo3−x−yO4, or in short Co–Ni–Zn–O), and its mono- and bimetallic counterparts, directly on nickel foam (NF) using a simple hydrothermal method, and studied their electrochemical behavior using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) techniques. The trimetallic oxide was produced by dissolving Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, urea (CO(NH2)2) and NH4F, in a 6:3:3:12:4 atomic ratio in deionized (DI) water, and transferring the mixture, alongside a cleaned NF, into an 80 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave that was maintained at 130 °C for 5 h. Then, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool down naturally, and the solid was filtered and washed several times, and dried and annealed at 350 °C in air for 4 h, after increasing the temperature using a heating rate of 2 °C min−1.28,41,42,52 The mono- and bimetallic counterparts (Co–O, Ni–O, Zn–O, Co–Ni–O, Co–Zn–O) and Co–Ni–Zn–O were prepared according to the same method, using the appropriate transition metal ion(s) and proportions suitable to each case.
Interestingly, the crystalline structure of Co–Ni–Zn–O and Co3O4 spinel were found to be very similar, with a minimal shift in the X-ray peaks in the diffractograms, as expected for isomorphic substitutions. The respective CV curves are shown in Fig. 2A, and the plots of real capacitance vs. current density curves for all materials are shown in Fig. 2B. It is possible to note that among the monometallic oxides, Co–O shows the highest charge capacity and rate capability, followed by Ni–O and Zn–O, whilst Co–Ni–O presents improved areal capacitance and rate capability than Co–Zn–O among the bimetallic oxides. Considering such a tendency, Co–Ni–Zn–O is expected to be the best among the trimetallic oxides, but demonstrates surprisingly much better performance than the corresponding mono- and bimetallic oxide counterparts.

Similar results were reported by Hu et al.28 (Fig. 2C), Wu et al.41 (Fig. 2D), and Wu et al.42 (Fig. 2E and F), who studied materials with the formula ZnxNiyCo3−x−yO4 and crystalline structure similar to the Co3O4 spinel, confirming that trimetallic oxides can have much better performance for application in hybrid SC devices than their mono- and bimetallic counterparts. This result was attributed to the fact that Co and Ni-based oxides have fast redox reactions, and high specific charge capacities are predicted theoretically, providing an increased density of electrochemically active sites, while Zn was found to be responsible for further enhancing the electric conductivity of such trimetallic materials.28,41,42,52
In fact, analyzing the results reported by Kumar et al.52 (Fig. 2A and B) it is possible to note that Co–O is the best battery-type monometallic material, being superior to Ni–O, in agreement with theoretical predictions, whereas Zn–O shows intrinsically poor electrochemical performance but superior electrical conductivity. For these reasons, Co–Zn–O shows the best energy storage performance among bimetallic oxides at low current densities, since, under these conditions, the density of active sites and the ion diffusion rate play more minor roles than under higher current density conditions, when these properties limit the electrode performance. Therefore, Co–Ni–O presents a higher rate capability than Co–Zn–O, due to its increased density of active sites and enhanced ion-diffusion rate provided by the presence of Ni ions in the crystalline structure, thus outperforming it at higher current densities. The superior charge capacity of Co–Ni–Zn–O compared with Co–O and Co–Zn–O was demonstrated by Wu et al.41 also, as clearly shown in the CVs of Fig. 2E, where the monometallic oxide presents a lower electric conductivity than the bimetallic ones, while the trimetallic oxide presents a higher density of active sites and ion diffusion rates provided by the Ni centers, which improves the electrode performance and cyclability. Thus, the combination of the Co–O, Ni–O and Zn–O properties in suitable proportions provided the best battery-like trimetallic oxide electrode material, Co–Ni–Zn–O, for application in hybrid SCs. In fact, it delivered a high energy capacity, rate capability, and stability under charge–discharge cycling conditions, as well as a low internal resistance (Rs) and interfacial charge-transfer resistance (Rct) due to synergistic effects.
The significant differences in performance observed for electrode materials based on ZnxNiyCo3−x−yO4 nanowire and nanosheet arrays supported on nickel foam (NF) substrates were assigned to minimal variations in composition and morphology,28,41,42,52 despite the fact that they were all prepared under similar hydrothermal conditions. This is a relevant problem that must be solved, since more robust synthetic methods are necessary for the production of devices with reproducible performance. In fact, nanostructured positive electrode materials have been prepared and their electrochemical properties carefully characterized. Hu et al.28 presented an oxide material with the formula Zn0.46Ni0.53Co2.01O4 that has a flower-like morphology (Fig. 3A and B) (776 F g−1 and 1.16 F cm−2, respectively, at 2 A g−1), while Wu et al.42 (Fig. 3C and D) and Kumar et al.52 (Fig. 3E and F) synthesized mesoporous oxides on NF, Zn0.49Ni0.79Co1.72O4 (2481.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and Zn1Ni1Co2O4 (1347.2 F g−1 and 2.42 F cm−2 at 2.5 mA cm−2), respectively. Meanwhile, Wu et al.41 (Fig. 3G–I) realized a nanosheet-structured mesoporous electrode (1172.2 C g−1 at 1 A g−1) that exhibits remarkable differences in charge capacity at more or less similar charge–discharge rates. To the best of our knowledge, the mesoporous electrode material produced by Wu et al.42 showed the highest energy capacity among the trimetallic oxide-based electrodes reported in the literature, in addition to good cyclability with 94% charge retention after 3000 charge–discharge cycles, and a rate capability of 91.9% at 5 A g−1.

As shown above, even considering supposedly the same oxide material, there are noteworthy differences in the experimental procedures and reported electrochemical results, as well as contrasting unities being used, making comparative analyses more difficult. At this point, we would like to emphasize that the charge capacity of battery-like materials must be expressed in specific gravimetric or areal charge capacity units (either C g−1 or C cm−2, or mA h g−1 or mA h cm−2) rather than in capacitance units (F g−1 or F cm−2). Such variability makes it difficult to compare materials performance. However, it is evident that minimal changes in composition and morphology can greatly impact on the electrode material performance, thus it is of the utmost relevance to fully understand the reasons behind such variability. In fact, the reports mentioned above on ZnxNiyCo3−x−yO4 and their mono- and bimetallic counterparts also presented a comprehensive analysis of the possible reasons.
Similar comparisons are possible in the case of MnxNiyCo3−x−yO4 trimetallic oxide materials31,35,39,43,45,50,54,56 based on MnO2, a pseudocapacitive material with a capacitance of as high as 1370 F g−1,38 low cost, low toxicity, ease of preparation and good electrochemical performance, with the perspective of further increasing the already good performance of NixCo3−xO4 bimetallic oxides. The capacitive performance of these bimetallic oxides is limited by their extremely poor electrical conductivity, ion-diffusion rates and structural stability that could be significantly improved by the incorporation of Mn2+ ions.39,61,67,73,74 Nevertheless, most MnxNiyCo3−x−yO4 trimetallic oxides realized up to now have shown relatively low specific capacitance and/or poor cyclability that hindered their practical application.54
Li et al.43 synthesized Mn0.36Ni1.46Co1.18O4 nanowires arrays with a spinel structure directly on NF (Fig. 4A), using a simple hydrothermal method. The material presented a relatively low capacitance of 638 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, despite a fairly good rate capability of 63.3% at 20 A g−1 and capacitance retention of 95.9% after 4000 cycles. Their experimental methods were quite similar to those presented by Kumar and coworkers (2019).52 Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, urea (CO(NH2)2) and NH4F were mixed in a 1:1:1:15:6 molar ratio, dissolved in 70 mL of DI water, transferred alongside cleaned NF into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 120 °C for 4 h. Then, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature, the sample was washed several times, and it was final thermally treated at 350 °C in air for 4 h, at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 for 4 h.28,41,42,52 The mono- and bimetallic counterparts were prepared in a similar way, but using appropriate proportions of the respective transition metal ions.

A similar capacitance was obtained by Yuan et al.50 who also synthesized Co–Ni–Mn spinel oxide nanowire arrays directly on NF. These authors introduced small changes in the preparation method that lead to the formation of Mn1Ni1Co1O4 (Fig. 4B), a material that delivers 612 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, along with a good rate capability of 78% at 10 A g−1 and capacitance retention of 86% after 5000 cycles. On the other hand, Saray et al.39 produced Mn0.79Ni1.10Co1.11O4 nanowires arrays on carbon cloth (CC) (Fig. 4C) with a much elevated specific capacitance (1601 F g−1 at 0.8 A g−1), using the same method adopted by Li et al.43 However, the CC substrate provided a much stronger adhesion and better electrical contact, resulting in enhanced conductivity and stability, associated with shorter ion diffusion and electron transport path, thus upgrading the performance of the respective electrode.39
Saray and Hadi39 also compared the capacitance of a trimetallic oxide with its mono- and bimetallic counterparts, obtaining specific capacitances of 167, 488, 1201 and 1601 F g−1 respectively for Co3O4/CC, MnCo2O4/CC, NiCo2O4/CC and MnNiCoO4/CC.39 Clearly, the bimetallic oxides provided higher capacitances than the monometallic Co3O4/CC, but MnCo2O4/CC showed a much poorer performance in comparison to NiCo2O4/CC. This result clearly indicated that despite the increase in non-faradaic contributions upon Mn-doping, there is no similar increase in the electrochemical activity to compensate for the enhancement achieved by Ni doping. In fact, both mechanisms seem to be operating synergistically in trimetallic MnNiCoO4/CC to provide a superior performance.
Interestingly, most of the best MnxNiyCo3−x−yO4-based homogeneous electrodes found in the literature have been produced by Xiong et al.,35 who prepared porous Ni–Co–Mn oxide nanoneedle arrays directly on NF (Fig. 4D) based on a slightly different method than those proposed by other authors. They increased the temperature of the hydrothermal process from 120 to 135 °C, doubled the reaction time (from 4 to 8 h), and decreased the temperature of the annealing process under a N2 atmosphere from 350 to 300 °C, to produce a Mn0.27Ni1.36Co1.36O4 material that exhibits a very high specific capacitance of 2023 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, a high rate capability of 61.8% at 40 mA cm−2 and good capacitance retention of 93% even after up to 3000 charge/discharge cycles.
At this point, you certainly realize that materials morphology, the choice of a suitable conducting substrate and good electrical contact can significantly influence the performance of the electrode. Thus, it is important to compare similar materials, such as the nanowires shown in Fig. 4A,434B,504C,39 and 4D,35 deposited with high surface areas and conducting NF, CC and rGO nanoflakes. However, although those materials exhibit a very similar nanowire morphology, small changes in their composition and how the metal cations are distributed in the host lamellar material seem to play extremely relevant roles in the electrochemical properties, where a tendency can be observed. The specific capacitance increases according to the atomic ratio of Co ≥ Ni ≫ Mn, indicating that Mn should be present in lower amounts while equal or larger amounts of Co relative to Ni tend to be beneficial. This suggests that Mn probably has a more structural and/or charge-transfer effect rather than a significant role in faradaic processes.
Furthermore, other homogeneous Co3O4-based spinel-structure trimetallic oxides such as CuxZnyCo3−x−yO4 nanoflakes on NF (178 C g−1 at 1 A g−1)60 (Fig. 5A) and MxNiyCo3−x−yO4 trimetallic oxide materials (where M = Cu, Mo and Fe) have also been studied. To the best of our knowledge, two groups have developed and reported on trimetallic oxides containing Cu57 and Mo.59 Samanta et al.57 synthesized Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4 flower-like nanorods on NF, which presented a capacitance of 367.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a rate capability of 44% at 20 A g−1, and a capacitance retention of 89% after 5000 charge–discharge cycles, whereas its bimetallic counterparts NiCo2O4 and CuCo2O4 showed much lower capacitances, 280.3 and 133.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. Sun et al.59 produced dandelion-like MoxNiyCo3−x−yO4 nanowires deposited on carbon nanotube fibers with a specific capacitance of 1.84 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2, capacitance retention of 89.7% after 3000 cycles and rate capability of 72.3% at 10 mA cm−2. Both benefited from the improved electrical conductivity provided by the incorporation of Cu and Mo, but the latter also contributed to an increase in the pseudocapacitance of the respective nanomaterial.

Similarly, there have been few (four) scientific articles that have reported the synthesis of FexNiyCo3−x−yO4-based spinel materials for application in hybrid SCs, all with different compositions and morphologies: NiCoFeO/PANI nanocomposite on a glassy carbon electrode (843 F g−1 at 2 A g−1)33 which will be discussed later on in the subtopic 2.2; Fe–Ni–Co oxide nanoflakes on NF (867 F g−1 at 1 A g−1)51 (Fig. 5B); NiCoFeO4 nanorods on NF (1263 F g−1 at 1 A g−1)34 (Fig. 5C); and Fe–Co–Ni oxide nanowires on graphene foam (GF) (627.7 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1) (Fig. 5D).58
Interestingly, although FexNiyCo3−x−yO4-based electrodes provide good cyclability, they show poor rate capabilities. The oxide materials supported on NF synthesized by Faid and Ismail34 and Sahoo et al.,51 demonstrated high capacitances of 1263 and 867 F g−1, respectively, both at 1 A g−1. The first one exhibited a capacitance retention of 97.2% after 2000 cycles and a rate capability of 36.6% at 11 A g−1, and the second one a capacitance retention of 92.3% after 10000 cycles and a rate capability of only 18% at 10 A g−1. These results demonstrate that these materials have good performances only under low current densities, probably as a consequence of the lower density of active sites and ion-diffusion rates in comparison to Mn- and Zn-doped MxNiyCo3−x−yO4 materials. Similar behavior was also observed for the Fe–Co–Ni oxide nanowires supported on GF realized by Zhao et al.,58 which presented a capacitance retention of 97.8% after more than 4000 charge–discharge cycles and a rate capability of 55.2% at 2 A g−1.
On the other hand, Ghadimi et al.49 demonstrated that CoMnFeO4 ferrite nanoparticles on graphite plate (Fig. 5E) exhibit lower capacitances (770 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) but a rate capability of as high as 80% at 40 A g−1, in addition to a charge retention capacity of 88% after 8000 cycles. This performance was achieved by focusing on cobalt-doped ferrite nanostructures and replacing Ni ions by Mn ions thus decreasing the concentration of faradaic sites to enhance stability and cyclability as well as the ion-diffusion rates.
In addition, hybrid SCs have also been derived from non-spinel structure materials. The most studied ones have been those based on monoclinic Mo2O4,44,47,53 which have good intrinsic physico-chemical properties and electrochemical performance, but poor stability on cycling and low specific charge capacity.53 To overcome such drawbacks, bimetallic molybdates such as MxMo2−xO4 (M = Ni, Co and Mn) were recently developed.44,47,53 NiMoO4 showed a higher charge capacity than CoMoO4 and MnMoO4 but its cycling stability was found to be unsatisfactory, whereas CoMoO4 was shown to possess excellent stability on cycling but low charge capacity.47 Accordingly, the higher charge capacity of nickel was combined with the much greater stability of the cobalt derivative to realize NixCoyMo2−x−yO4 trimetallic molybdates, synergistically combining their favorable properties to generate materials with improved electrochemical performances. It is interesting to note that Ni and Co ions were responsible for most of the redox active sites, while the Mo ions improved the capacitance by making the non-faradaic intercalation/deintercalation processes reversible and much faster, although they are still classified as battery-like materials.44
Chen et al.47 presented the first efficient method for the production of trimetallic NixCoyMo2−x−yO4 oxides, as electrodes of Ni0.67Co0.33MoO4 nanorod arrays on NF (Fig. 6A), without compromising the crystalline structure of Mo2O4. The highest charge capacities (Fig. 6C) of 441 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 71% of this value at 50 A g−1, with a charge retention of 80% after 1000 cycles, were achieved when the molar ratio of Ni was greater than that of Co, demonstrating the relevance that nickel redox sites have on the electrochemical performance of the material. Sun et al.53 prepared Ni0.75Co0.25MoO4 nanosheets directly on CC (Fig. 6B) that showed an improved charge capacity of 726.6 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a charge retention of 97.2% after 3000 cycles, but with a lower rate capability of 73% at 20 A g−1. The authors53 also showed that the charge capacity of this trimetallic oxide was much greater than of its bimetallic counterparts (Fig. 6D). She et al.44 synthesized Ni–Co–Mo oxide nanosheets directly on NF with a relatively high specific capacitance of 1366 F g−1, a rate capability of 71.3% at 40 A g−1, and charge retention of 89.75% after 5000 cycles, a performance comparable with most spinel-based trimetallic oxides. These three studies demonstrated the high potential for Mo2O4-based non-spinel trimetallic oxides to be used as hybrid SC electrode materials.

Lastly, it is noteworthy to mention that Zhao et al.75 produced a distinct material by incorporating Co into NiV2O6/Ni(HCO3)2 nanoflakes and subsequently depositing them on NF, characterized by its unique electrochemical properties, mainly derived from the presence of metal sites with multiple oxidation states (V5+, V4+ and V3+). The bimetallic oxides CoV2O6 and NiV2O6/C show low long-term stability and specific capacitances of 223 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and 746 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, respectively, values below those of similar mixed transition metal oxides. However, NiV2O6/Ni(HCO3)2 was used as a substrate to grow hierarchical nano/micro-structures directly on NF, the large d spacing (d(110) = 5.92 Å) of which facilitates the insertion of cobalt ions in the crystal lattice, thus improving the electrical conductivity. In fact, the resultant trimetallic battery-like positive electrode material exhibited incredibly good electrochemical performance, with a specific capacitance of 4.48 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2, and a rate capability of 82.1% at 10 mA cm−2, in addition to an increased capacitance of 106.2% after 10000 cycles. Accordingly, Co/Ni-doped V3O6 was found to be a competitive and promising material for application in supercapacitor devices.
2.2. Improving electrochemical performance via the formation of nanocomposites
As already mentioned, the incorporation of oxide materials into other suitable materials to generate nanocomposites is an interesting alternative to overcome the limitations of transition metal oxides to improve their performance in hybrid SCs. One of the most common strategies is their incorporation in conductive materials, such as conducting polymers, nickel foam and carbon materials such as graphene. In fact, depending on the electrical contact and morphology of the final system, not only the electronic conductivity but also the ion diffusion rates and non-faradaic properties can be also improved.
Yin et al.45 proposed for the first time the synthesis of a composite based on a trimetallic oxide and a polymer, PEDOT–PSS/MnxNiyCo3−x−yO4, via a coupled hydrothermal-coprecipitation method (Fig. 7A). This composite offers superior performance in comparison to its mono- and bimetallic counterparts, with a capacitance of as high as 1234.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Nevertheless, the relatively poor capacitance retention of 83.7% after 1000 cycles was mainly a consequence of the structural changes in the polymer chain/phase after each cycle.45 Similar results were obtained by Hu et al.33 for a NiCoFeO/PANI nanocomposite on a glassy carbon electrode (843 F g−1 at 2 A g−1), which exhibited a capacitance retention of 70.46% after 5000 cycles, but unfortunately the rate capability was not evaluated (Fig. 7B). Its lower capacitance retention compared with other similar materials was assigned to the structural changes of PANI that generated instability upon charge–discharge cycling. This finding suggests that nanocomposites with conductive polymers, such as PANI and PEDOT–PSS, possibly may not be a very promising strategy for the development of high performance electrode materials, especially due to non-reversible structural changes that take place during the charge/discharge cycles that compromise their electrochemical properties.

In contrast, the structural and electrochemical stability were shown to be enhanced in the case of graphene nanocomposites. In this context, Wu et al.54 prepared a nanocomposite of MnxNiyCo3−x−yO4 spinel (MNCO) supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO), or rGO–MNCO (Fig. 7C) via a simple hydrothermal method followed by thermal treatment. The incorporation of rGO in battery-type materials, such as transition metal oxides, inhibited or mitigated one of the most prevalent problems faced by lamellar carbon materials, which is the regeneration of the graphite oxide structure induced by the strong π-stacking interactions of the nanosheets. In fact, the metal oxide nanoparticles deposited on the surface act as physical spacers, at the same time offering a high surface area and specific charge capacities that enhance the electrical conductivity and ion diffusion rates.54,56 The measured specific charge capacity of the rGO–MNCO nanocomposite electrode was 630.1 C g−1 at 1 mV s−1, a much higher value than those presented by pure “MNCO” electrodes, as can be clearly observed from comparing the respective quantities in Fig. 7D, and showed a rate capability of 89.6% at 30 A g−1 and a charge retention of 77.2% even after 10000 cycles.54
Interesting results were also observed for the Mn0.9Cu0.1Fe2O4/rGO nanocomposite on ITO (300 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1)55 (Fig. 7E), the only nanocomposite based on graphene and Fe3O4 found in the literature. On the other hand, Sanchez et al.,66 similarly to Wu et al.,54 prepared an rGO-supported Mn0.48Ni1.26Co1.26O4 nanocomposite, but also changed its crystalline structure from spinel to rock salt via thermal treatment at 500 °C. This material delivered a specific charge capacity of 115 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, with a rate capability of 43% and charge retention of 96% after 2000 cycles, a superior performance compared to that of pure Mn0.48Ni1.26Co1.26O4 (Fig. 7F). It is important to emphasize here that this was the first report on a trimetallic oxide material with a rock salt structure,66 with a systematic and more in depth study required to understand the effect of such structural changes on the properties, despite the apparently better performance of the corresponding spinel-structure materials.
2.3. Improving performances via hierarchical core@shell nanostructuring
The design of hierarchical core@shell nanostructured materials is a promising strategy to further improve the electrochemical performance of several materials, including transition metal oxides, since it can increase the porosity and surface area, the density of active sites, the ion-diffusion rate and the electrical conductivity, parameters directly related to the specific capacitance.39,52,76,77 To the best of our knowledge, only two studies based on homogeneous trimetallic oxides were found,39,52 both already partially discussed in this review. Saray et al.39 grew ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets on as-synthesized MnNiCoO4 nanowire arrays prepared on CC (Fig. 4C) to produce MnNiCoO4 nanowire@MnO2 nanosheets core@shell arrays (Fig. 8A and B), benefiting from the pseudocapacitive properties of MnO2. The resultant material exhibited a considerably greater surface area as well as faster electron transfer kinetics, as reflected in a 17% increase in its capacitance to 1931 F g−1 at 0.8 A g−1, a rate capability of 91.2% at 6 A g−1, and a capacitance retention of 91.2% after 6000 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance of trimetallic oxides compared to their mono- and bi-metallic counterparts, and the further enhancement that can be achieved by hierarchical core@shell nanostructuration,39 demonstrates the suitability of this strategy for developing electrode materials.

The other study was carried by Kumar et al. (2019),52 who used Co–Ni–Zn–O nanowire arrays prepared on NF as scaffolds for the growth of NiWO4 needles, to produce Co–Ni–Zn–O@NiWO4 core–shell nanowire arrays (Fig. 8C). NiWO4 possesses exceptionally high electrical conductivity and has been extensively studied as an electrode material for SCs, although its specific capacity is not high enough for direct practical application in energy storage devices,52 in analogy to MnO2. The new core–shell material presented lower ion diffusion resistance, higher conductivity, a nearly four times superior areal capacitance of 9.31 F cm−2 and more than double the specific capacitance (2909.9 F g−1) in comparison to bare Co–Ni–Zn–O, both at 2.5 mA cm−2, as well as a charge retention of 97.8% after 10000 cycles. Thus, it has proved to be one of the most interesting trimetallic oxide-based battery-like positive electrode materials for hybrid SCs ever reported in the literature.
There is a large number of publications reporting the synergistic effects provided by the presence of three different metallic cations in hierarchically structured metal oxides in the literature, but involving core@shell nanostructures or heterogeneous mixtures based on mono- and bimetallic oxides, instead of homogeneous trimetallic oxides. Therefore, they cannot be classified as authentic trimetallic oxide-based materials. For example, Sun et al.46 prepared nickel cobalt-based trimetallic oxides doped with molybdenum (Ni–Co–Mo), iron (Ni–Co–Fe), zinc (Ni–Co–Zn), aluminum (Ni–Co–Al) and copper (Ni–Co–Cu) using NF as the Ni source, which presented specific capacities of 0.12, 0.23, 0.24, 0.27 and 0.32 mA h cm−2 and specific capacitances of 0.85, 1.63, 1.72, 1.94, and 2.28 F cm− 2, at 1 mA cm−2, respectively. Interestingly, the authors proposed that these materials could be a random mixture of mono- and bimetallic oxides, but were classified as heterogeneous trimetallic oxides in this account. An example is the material prepared by Punde, Rajpurohit and Srivastava,48 a mesoporous composite of Bi–Co–Zn trimetallic oxide nanoparticles on SiC (841.1 C g−1 at 1 A g−1). In fact, this material was shown to be a mixture of Bi2O3, CoO, and ZnO metal oxide phases, as demonstrated by the presence of X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks associated with the crystalline structures of each of the pristine species, demonstrating pseudocapacitive behavior in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, provided by ZnO, but with the contribution of faradaic processes from redox reactions involving Bi2O3 and CoO.
For this reason, we decided to extend this topic to all studies on core@shell nanostructures and heterogeneous metal oxides, e.g. including mixtures of three different transition metal oxides, for application in supercapacitors, shown in Table 2, even though these materials cannot be strictly considered as trimetallic materials, the main focus of this account.

In fact, the best electrodes reported in the literature encompass hierarchical core@shell structures, composed of MnO2 and a bimetallic oxide,38,40,62,64,65,67,70,71,73,74,78–80 or prepared by coating a nanostructured doped bimetallic oxide with another doped bimetallic oxide.61,63,69,81,82 They benefit from the synergistic effects provided by the components, which reduces any of their downsides and improves the electrochemical performances, as a consequence of the increase in the specific surface area and concentration of active sites provided by the hierarchical nanostructures.
The top three electrode materials of the first type are honeycomb-like CoMoO4@MnO2 core@shell nanostructures on GF (2666.7 F g−1; 8.01 F cm−2 at 3 mA cm−2);80 NiCo2O4 nanowire@MnO2 core@shell nanosheets on GF (2577 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and 5.15 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2);64 and ZnCo2O4@MnO2 core@shell nanocone forests on NF (2339 F g−1 at 1 A g−1).65 The top three materials of the second type are CoMoO4 nanoplates@NiCo2O4 core@shell nanowires on NF (14.67 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2);69 MnCo2O4.5 nanoflakes decorated with NiCo2O4 nanosticks (2506 F g−1 at 1 A g−1);61 and NiMoO4@CoMoO4 nanospheres on NF (1601.6 F g−1 at 2 A g−1).63 Their much higher capacitances in comparison to the respective bimetallic oxides is noticeable (all already discussed in this review), demonstrating the occurrence of synergistic effects, even in heterogeneous structures. Therefore, we emphasize that not only the best pure trimetallic oxides or nanocomposites derivatives should be pursued but also hierarchical core@shell nanostructures and nanocomposites based on them, since they can exhibit improved electrochemical performance and stability.
For a better understanding of core@shell structures, a theoretical-experimental approach can be very helpful in providing new insights and a more in depth understanding of the possible mechanism of action of a metallic element introduced into an oxide matrix, its effects on the electronic and electrochemical properties, as well as the mechanism of eventual synergic effects. For example, Liu et al.83 conducted a thorough theoretical study employing density functional calculations (DFT) to better understand the enhanced electrochemical behavior of MnCo2O4@CoS, as well as the interfacial properties of MnCo2O4 and CoS. The band structure and total density of states (DOS) of MnCo2O4 (311) and CoS were calculated to understand the electronic conductivity and electrochemical reactivity of these materials. The conduction and valence bands of both components in MnCo2O4@CoS were found to be largely overlapped, suggesting good electronic conductivity. Moreover, by comparing the DOS of MnCo2O4 (311) and MnCo2O4@CoS, a larger density of electronic states was found around the Fermi level of MnCo2O4@CoS, suggesting an enhanced electron-donating capability at the interface for electrochemical reactions.84 Therefore, high electronic conductivity and good electrochemical activity were predicted for MnCo2O4@CoS at the interfacial region from DFT calculations, which are beneficial for improved electrochemical performance.85 Additionally, the Mulliken charge analyses by DFT calculations carried out by Hao and collaborators86 suggested strong interactions between NiSe2 and PANI via interfacial C–Ni–Se bonds, thus inducing significant electron accumulation at Ni sites. This effect can promote not only faster electron transfer within the electrode material, but enhanced faradaic capacity was also theoretically predicted for such an electrode material. Furthermore, the DFT calculations revealed that the combination of NiSe2 and PANI can facilitate both the adsorption and desorption of OH− ions, assuring a fast and efficient faradaic reaction, thus providing some insights on the energy storage mechanism in the electrode material and respective devices. Also, DFT calculations have shown that the DOS around the Fermi level of oxide/hydroxides materials increase upon the incorporation of higher valence states heteroatoms such as Co4+, Co3+, and Mn3+, among others, evidencing the improved conductivity of the electrode materials.87–89 Also, DFT studies have shown that the incorporation of Mn plays a crucial role in the desorption of surface hydrogen atoms, being closely linked to the redox processes of LDH materials.90
3. Trimetallic layered double hydroxides
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), similar to anionic clays, are a class of two-dimensional hydrotalcite-like lamellar materials. The structure of the LDHs is composed of positively charged host layers, because of the partial substitution of divalent metal ions by trivalent ones, balanced by interlayer anions and water molecules.93 Also, the reported results indicate that LDH materials incorporating electrochemically active metallic elements exhibit good performances as positive electrodes in electrochemical hybrid supercapacitors and as electrocatalysts for oxidation reactions.94 It should be noticed that although investigations have focused on bimetallic LDHs, recent studies have shown that trimetallic LDHs (Fig. 9A), TLDHs (also called layered triple hydroxides, LTHs or ternary layered double hydroxides), can exhibit higher electrochemical and electrocatalytic performances when compared with their bimetallic LDH counterparts.94–96

Many reviews have discussed the application of LDHs,10 metal oxides/hydroxides97–99 and their carbon nanocomposites7,100,101 in the energy sector. For instance, Patel et al.,11 Zhao et al.9 and Li et al.90 recently reported on the main strategies for the design, synthesis and application of LDHs in energy conversion and storage, primarily focusing on the use of bimetallic materials in supercapacitors. However, a comprehensive review on the application of TLDHs and TLDH-based nanocomposites as high-performance “hybrid supercapacitor materials” is still missing. Thus, the main objective of this subtopic of this review is to fill such a gap and provide readers with a thorough overview of the synthetic strategies and the reasons behind the enhanced performance of TLDHs and nanocomposite materials as the positive electrodes of electrochemical hybrid supercapacitors.
It is also worth noting that a large number of articles that will be discussed in this subtopic are quite recent and have been published in the last three years, as shown in Fig. 9B. The materials here classified as TLDHs are typically NiCoAl, NiCoMn and NiCoFe derivatives (Fig. 9B), corresponding respectively to 56.1, 14.0 and 8.8% of the materials discussed below, taking into account the strategies of (3.1.) conductivity optimization via the incorporation of heteroatoms and (3.2) the incorporation of conducting materials in composites, and (3.3) activation of TLDH sites via furry morphology and mesoporous structuration.
As mentioned earlier, most hybrid SC materials based on TLDHs contain different proportions of Ni2+, Co2+/3+ and Al3+ cations. For example, Gupta et al.103 reported the first ternary layered triple hydroxides, denominated CoxNiyAlz-TLDHs, where the proportion of metallic ions are x + y + z = 1. In fact, a network of CoxNiyAlz-TLDHs nanosheets was prepared using a potentiostatic deposition process at −1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) onto stainless steel electrodes, where a maximum specific capacitance of ∼1263 F g−1 was achieved for Co0.59Ni0.21Al0.20-TLDH, the high conductivity of which was demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Xue and coworkers104 reported a CoNiAl-TLDH with a dandelion-like nanofiber morphology and a specific capacitance of 2791 F g−1, at 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 10A and B), a delicate nanostructure build-up starting from rolled-up hydroxide nanosheets (Fig. 10C). The hierarchical nanostructure and optimized molar ratio of Co, Ni, and Al assured the high electrochemical performance of that material, which showed a capacitance retention of 85% after 2000 charge–discharge cycles (Fig. 10D). A careful analysis of Table 1 indicates that this material is indeed very promising as a positive electrode in hybrid SCs since, in addition to its good cyclability, it has a capacitance that outperforms most NiCoAl hydroxides, including Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05(OH)2 (244.7 F g−1),105 CoNiAl-TLDH (1124 F g−1),106 CoxNi1−xAl-TLDHs (1375 F g−1),93 NiCoAl-TLDH (2062 F g−1)107 and NiCo2Al-TLDHs (2369.4 F g−1).108

3.1. Incorporation of conducting materials in TLDH composites
It is well known that the power density of LDHs is limited by their poor electrical conductivity, especially at high charge/discharge rates, and many strategies have been proposed to overcome this drawback. Among them, the incorporation of conducting materials into TLDH composites has proven to be very effective. In fact, the growth/deposition of NiCoAl-TLDHs on highly conductive carbonaceous materials (e.g. active charcoal (AC),109 carbon cloth (CC),110 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),111 reduced graphene oxide (rGO)112–118 and CNT/rGO119) have been very successful. This strategy was employed by Su et al.116 to prepare a novel nanoflower rGO/NiCoAl-TLDH composite, fabricated using a binder-free hydrothermal process (Fig. 10E). The nanoflower structure seems to be self-assembled by binding several vertically interconnected nanosheets to each flake. The as-prepared nanoflower structured material with porous nanosheets greatly enhanced the capacitance and the rate capability of the electrode material for SC devices (Fig. 10F). When electrodes were prepared with the composite, the sample with 6.36 mg of GO revealed surprisingly optimized high performance, when compared to composites containing 4.26, 8.48 and 10.6 mg of GO. This material presented ultrahigh specific capacitance of 4732 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 4068 F g−1 at 4 A g−1, also showing good rate capability as (Fig. 8G). The results reflect the synergy and exceptional surface area of the rGO and NiCoAl-TLDH nanocomposite with nanoflower morphology deposited on nickel foam substrate, as well as the elaborate influence that graphene has on its nanostructure and conductivity.
As usual, graphene and rGO are the most widely used conductive two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, but their specific capacitance tends to be low since they are not redox active, thus decreasing the energy density of such capacitive materials. In this regard, transition metal carbide and nitride (MXenes) nanosheets are more promising candidates for the incorporation of conducting materials strategy given their excellent pseudocapacitive properties, metallic conductivity, surface hydrophilicity, and chemical stability.120 In fact, MXenes can be considered as a new type of 2D materials, described by the formula Mn+1XnTx, where Tx represents the surface functional groups such as OH, O, and/or F, M is an early transition metal element and X represents C and/or N atoms, where n = 1, 2, 3.121,122 Pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene film was reported to exhibit a high gravimetric capacitance of 245 F g−1 and a conductivity of 150000 S m−1, performing better than any commonly used carbon material.120 In fact, a singular layered Ti3C2/NiCoAl-TLDH heterostructure material, alternately stacked with molecular-level nanosheets, was for the first time realized by means of a facile liquid-phase co-feeding and electrostatic attraction hetero-assembly strategy of negatively charged Ti3C2 and positively charged NiCoAl-TLDH nanosheets.120 The negatively charged Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets (Fig. 11A) were prepared via a controlled HF etching, tetramethylammonium intercalation and delamination process in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). On the other hand, the positively charged NiCoAl-TLDH nanosheets were obtained via a facile two-step anion exchange method followed by delamination in formamide (the NiCoAl-TLDH-NO3− exfoliated in formamide was labeled as ex-NiCoAl-TLDH). The Ti3C2/NiCoAl-TLDH heterostructures were prepared via the electrostatic interaction/flocculation of oppositely charged ex-Ti3C2 with ex-NiCoAl-TLDH nanosheets, at an ideal feeding rate of 2:1.

The Ti3C2/NiCoAl-TLDH heterostructures possessing the merits of both conductive and battery-type components, can show greatly enhanced dynamic behavior in faradaic processes, contributing towards boosting the power density. Electrons travel in the Ti3C2 layers, while ions diffuse rapidly along two-dimensional galleries, resulting in the shortest diffusion pathway and highest charge-transfer efficiency possible, as shown in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 11B). Ti3C2/NiCoAl-TLDH electrodes showed the largest slope in the low-frequency region, probably as a result of the NiCoAl-TLDH nanosheets anchoring onto the Ti3C2 nanosheets, effectively preventing their stacking while making a sufficiently good electric contact between them, as well as enhancing the ion diffusion rate in the electrolyte. Furthermore, the Bode phase plots in Fig. 11C showed that the knee frequency fΦ = −45° of in-Ti3C2 is about 27 Hz, suggesting that energy storage and output is accessible at this frequency, also confirming the excellent rate performance inherent to MXene-based pseudocapacitors. The knee frequency of the Ti3C2/NiCoAl-TLDH electrode is much lower (2 Hz), but higher than that of NiCoAl-TLDH-NO3− nanosheet material, probably as a consequence of the incorporation of high electrical conductivity and charge transport efficiency into the in-Ti3C2 nanosheets. The Ti3C2/NiCoAl-TLDH heterostructure exhibited a specific capacitance of 748.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, showing enhanced rate capability. More importantly, a maximum energy density of 45.8 W h kg−1 was measured when Ti3C2/NiCoAl-TLDH was used as the positive electrode of an all-solid-state flexible hybrid SC, indicating that it is a very promising candidate for the development of future high-energy density supercapacitors.
Analogously, Wang et al.122 recently reported the preparation of NiCoAl-TLDH nanosheets uniformly grown onto micron-scale MXene sheets to form a NiCoAl-TLDH/V4C3Tx heterostructure with three-dimensional interconnected porous network microstructures via a hydrothermal method (Fig. 11D). NiCoAl-TLDH/V4C3Tx composite electrodes showed an excellent specific charge capacity of 627 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, in 1 M KOH. In particular, the NiCoAl-TLDH/V4C3Tx electrodes exhibited a charge capacity of 300 C g−1, even at a high current density of 20 A g−1 in 1 M KOH, demonstrating good rate capability. Hybrid SCs constructed with that battery-type electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the capacitive electrode, showed superior energy densities of 71.7 and 45.0 W h kg−1 at power densities of 0.830 and 20 kW kg−1 in 1 M KOH, respectively, and an excellent charge retention of 98% after 10000 cycles at 20 A g−1. In addition, as shown in Fig. 11F, two NiCoAl-TLDH/V4C3Tx//AC hybrid devices connected in series (Fig. 11E) can light up blue, green, yellow and red light-emitting diodes (LEDs), making them promising electrode materials for the production of low-cost hybrid supercapacitors.
3.2. Conductivity optimization via the incorporations of heteroatoms in TLDHs
In addition to the controlled incorporation of carbonaceous materials and MXenes discussed above, Gao et al.110 recently reported that the introduction of Al in an appropriate ratio can distinctively enhance the rate capability, thus showing it to be an excellent strategy to optimize the conductivity of TLDHs and consequently improve their energy storage properties. In fact, NiCo2Alx-TLDH with various amounts of Al were grown directly on mechanically flexible and electrically conducting carbon cloth substrates to generate CC@NiCo2Alx-TLDHs (Fig. 12A), demonstrating that Al plays a significant role in determining their structure, morphology, and electrochemical behavior (the strategy of the incorporation of conducting materials in TLDH composites was also used simultaneously). Nanowires and nanosheets were uniformly grown on carbon cloths depending on the amount of Al, where a clear transition was observed from flower-like nanostructures of 1D nanowires (NiCo2–OH, Fig. 12B and C) to mixed morphologies consisting of 1D nanowires and 2D nanosheets (Fig. 12D and E), then to 2D nanosheets as its concentration was increased. The specific capacitances of the CC@NiCo2–OH, CC@NiCo2Al0.5-TLDH, CC@NiCo2Al-TLDH, and CC@NiCo2Al2-TLDH electrodes at 0.5 A g−1, were respectively 493, 1008, 1137, and 744 F g−1. When the current density was enhanced to 20 A g−1, their capacitances decreased to 104, 510, 660, and 353 F g−1, thus reaching capacitance retentions of 21.1, 50.6, 58, and 45.6% (Fig. 12F), suggesting that Al in suitable proportions (in this case NiCoAl 1:2:1) can significantly improve the rate capability. This is due to the significant decrease in the charge transfer resistances, as indicated by the smaller diameter semicircles of the materials compared to that of CC@NiCo2–OH (Fig. 12G). The flexible hybrid SC built using CC@NiCo2Al-TLDH as a cathode material and CC@ZPC as an anode material (ZPC = ZIF-8 derived porous carbon) delivered a remarkable energy density of 44 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.462 kW kg−1, and a capacitance retention of 91.2% after 15000 charge–discharge cycles. In short, this study demonstrated a new strategy that significantly improved the rate capability and stability of transition metal TLDHs, which are otherwise structurally unstable and have poor performance in terms of both parameters as well as their charge–discharge rate and stability on cycling.

As highlighted above, high rate capability is mandatory, since for practical applications high energy density at high power densities is generally required. In this context, Pourfarzad et al.123 prepared ternary NiCoFe-TLDHs on nickel foam as novel positive electrodes (Fig. 12H) and Fe2O3/graphene as a novel negative electrode for hybrid energy storage devices. The electrochemical efficiencies of NiCoFe-TLDHs were explored and the conductivities of the TLDHs were optimized by adjusting the amounts of Ni, Co and Fe via an electrochemical method, as shown in the CVs of Fig. 12I, where the ternary NiCoFe-TLDH samples with a Ni:Co:Fe ratio of 2:1:1 exhibited the highest specific charge capacity. Such a high performance was assigned to the synergistic effect of Co, Ni and Fe in the TLDH structure, increasing the conductivity and the charge-transfer rate for the oxidation rate of Ni(OH)2 and formation of CoIV active sites, while facilitating the penetration of OH− and therefore accelerating those processes. In fact, the NiCoFe-TLDH showed an exceptionally high specific capacitance of 3130 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 12J). Furthermore, the hybrid SC assembled with a NiCoFe-TLDH as a cathode and Fe2O3/graphene as an anode exhibited a maximum energy density of 101 W h kg−1 and a power density of 91.5 kW kg−1, as well as long-term cycling stability (82.5% charge retention after 5000 cycles).
A thorough analysis of Table 3 indicates that the power density of the NiCoFe-TLDH//Fe2O3/graphene hybrid SC is the highest among TLDH-based hybrid devices. At this point, it is interesting to emphasize that the overall ohmic drops declined as the current density was increased, the opposite behavior to what is generally observed, thus confirming the high rate capability of the device. This behavior was found to be related to the Ni:Co:Fe ratio, but especially to the proportion of cobalt in the structure, since, in addition to participating in electrochemical reactions, it increases the conductivity of the electrode material.124–126 In fact, the rate capability of the electrodes decreased as a function of the percentage of cobalt in the structure, but the charge capacity was found to be strongly correlated with the relative amount of nickel, with the best performance being achieved for a 2:1 Ni:Co ratio. Accordingly, the high energy density (7.62 W h kg−1) at a power density of as high as 91.5 kW kg−1 is mainly dependent on faradaic processes, in contrast with most negative electrodes used in hybrid supercapacitors. In other words, the Ni2Co1Fe1-TLDH electrode has typical battery-type behavior rather than SC behavior, thus explaining the exceptionally high charge capacity, as well as energy and power densities of the assembled device.

3.3. Activation of TLDH sites via furry morphology and mesoporous structuration
The realization of high power density devices such as hybrid SCs widens their perspectives for use as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, in a rush that has been accelerated by the limited availability of the raw materials for their production. To this end, Chandrasekaran et al.127 employed an interesting active site engineering strategy in the design of a nanocomposite TLDH prepared using a microwave assisted technique. A hollow trimetallic MnCuAl-TLDH nanocomposite with a furry morphology and mesoporous nature (Fig. 13A–C) was realized, presenting an electrochemical performance that indicates the relevance of the highly mesoporous fibrillar architecture in achieving a high power density and rate capability, with superior life cycling stability. Such type of structure not only has a high density of reaction sites, but also facilitates the charge and electrolyte diffusion to the reaction sites. The MnCuAl-TLDH retains 93.46% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles and has an exceptionally low series resistance of 0.701 Ω. Prominently, the assembled symmetric solid-state SC device delivered as high an energy density as 101.75 W h kg−1 and a power density of 0.900 kW kg−1, demonstrating its immense potential as a high-performance electrode material for the forthcoming generation of energy warehouses.

A similar hollow NiAlMn-TLDH (Fig. 13D) exhibiting an even higher energy density and capacitance was subsequently realized by the same group.128 First, Ni2+ ions were attached to the SiO2 nanoparticle surface, and this was followed by the deposition of a Ni(OH)2 shell via the slow hydrolysis of urea to NH3 and HCO3− in the presence of Ni2+ to generate core@shell nanoparticles (CLSH). A similar process was carried out upon the addition of Al3+ and urea, resulting in the formation of a bimetallic NiAl layered double hydroxide named YLDH (Fig. 13E). Interestingly, the size of the silica core decreased, forming what was denominated “yolk”, indicating a leaching process in the alkaline conditions at 120 °C. Finally, the same procedure was repeated using NiAl-LDH in the presence of Mn2+ to form hollow ternary NiAlMn-TLDH (Fig. 13F), where the nucleation and growth occurred via an aggregation-based mechanism to produce a crystalline material with a large surface area and fast electron and ion diffusion properties. Such characteristics conferred a high capacitance of 1756 F g−1 at 4 A g−1 and a capacitance retention of up to 89.5% after 4000 cycles. Additionally, it provided a higher energy density of 239 W h kg−1, at a power density of 1.980 kW kg−1. Thus, the hollow NiAlMn-TLDH nanocomposite provided a general approach for the design of high-performance SC materials with a tunable nanostructure and high perspectives for application in energy storage devices.
4. Trimetallic system based on transition metal oxides/LDHs
In the previous two sections, it was discussed how the electrochemical properties of trimetallic oxide (TMO) and TLDH electrode materials can be improved by the incorporation of heteroatoms in the electrode materials, the preparation of composites with conducting materials, and the development of 3D nano-architectures through active site engineering. In this section, we discuss how electrode materials based on TMO/LDH composites, where the total number of transition metal elements is equal to three, can be influenced by those strategies.
TMO and LDH have been used as electrode materials for energy storage devices, due to their high theoretical specific charge capacities.160,161 However, such interesting properties are almost impossible to be reach in a practical application because of their slow charge-transfer rates and poor electrical conductivity. Thus, many efforts have been carried out in order to overcome these drawbacks, for example, by developing nanostructured and multi-component materials, exhibiting synergistic effects, as reported in several works.
Multi-component materials based on TMO/LDH nanocomposites have been demonstrated to be very promising as the electrode materials of hybrid SC devices. The most reported TMOs are Co3O4, Mn3O4, and MnO2 combined with NiAl-, NiCo-, and NiMn-LDHs. Considering the type of TMOs used in the multi-component materials combined with LDHs, this section will be divided into three subtopics according to the transition metal oxide (Co-oxide/LDH, Mn-oxide/LDH and other TMO/LDHs) to improve the clarity, and the work (from 2014 to 2019) is summarized in Table 4.

4.1. Co-oxide/LDHs
Before beginning the discussion about electrode materials based on Co-oxide/LDH and its hybrid SC devices, it is very important to have in mind the electrochemical behavior of Co3O4. Many authors have misclassified Co3O4 as a pseudocapacitive material, when it presents battery-type behavior. In fact, only a few electrode materials such as RuO2 and MnO2 exhibit a truly capacitive electrochemical signature, where the current remains more or less constant over a broad potential range.
A high theoretical specific charge capacity of 890 mA h g−1 and excellent redox activity162 was estimated for cobalt oxide (Co3O4), which has been incorporated in several types of nanostructured materials (nanowires, nanosheets, nanocages, nanorods and so on), leading to very significant improvements in their electrochemical properties.163–168 Although the nanostructured morphology can improve the electrochemical properties of electrode materials, the specific charge capacity can still be low, since only a small fraction of the sites are exposed to the electrolyte and are active, in addition to limitations associated with slow interfacial charge-transfer kinetics.12
Similarly to Co3O4, LDHs have faradaic reactions that are limited by slow electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion rates.12 Currently, many authors have noticed that the key to the development of high specific capacity LDHs lies in the systematic study of the morphology and metallic composition of these materials. Indeed, Martins et al.125 reported that the isomorphic substitution of 40% of Ni2+ by Co3+ ions in the nickel hydroxide structure improved the specific charge capacity by up to 485% when compared to pure alpha-Ni(OH)2, and stabilized the material in the electrochemically more active alpha phase.
The development of core@shell materials such as Co3O4@MnO2,169 Co3O4@Ni(OH)2,170 and Co3O4@NiCo2O4,171 with high porosity and surface area, via hydrothermal methods168,172–175 has been a very interesting strategy to boost the density of available active sites and improve the specific capacitance of Co3O4. One of the first core@shell architectures, based on Co3O4@NiAl-LDH was realized by Ning et al.168 using such a hydrothermal method, as illustrated in Fig. 14A. Co3O4 nanowires arrays were prepared on a nickel foam substrate using the hydrothermal method and were immersed into an AlOOH sol, self-assembling a aluminum oxide/hydroxide layer on the Co3O4 nanowire substrate. Then, the resultant Co3O4@AlOOH nanowires were reacted with Ni2+, urea and water in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 100 °C for 24 h to realize a core@shell type nanostructured material. As shown in Fig. 14B, the Co3O4 core is composed of 10–20 nm large nanocrystals and the NiAl-LDH nanosheets are anchored onto the surface of the nanowires. The resultant Co3O4@NiAl-LDH electrode material presented a superior electrochemical behavior compared to that of pristine Co3O4 nanowires (Fig. 14C), presenting a good rate capability of 62% of the specific capacitance at 20 A g−1 (1088 F g−1 as compared to 1772 F g−1 at 2 A g−1), whereas the pristine Co3O4 nanowire electrode retained only 48% (216 F g−1 compared to 444 F g−1).

In addition to the morphology, another factor that can affect the specific charge capacity is the molar ratio of TMO and LDH, as demonstrated by Li et al.173 using Co3O4 and NiAl-LDH. Four Co3O4@LDH materials were prepared via a hydrothermal method using 2:0.5; 2:1, 2:1.5 and 2:3 Co3O4 to LDH molar ratios. Notably, the specific capacitance increased from 468 to 1104 F g−1 when the molar ratio was changed from 2:0.5 to 2:1.5, but diminished to 684 F g−1 when the relative amount of LDH was further increased to a ratio of 2:3. However, BET measurements indicated that the surface areas of Co3O4@LDHs with molar ratios of 2:0.5; 2:1; 2:1.5 and 2:3 were respectively 71.5, 77.4, 95.3 and 82.1 m2 g−1. In addition, the SEM images of the Co3O4@LDH materials with molar ratios of 2:0.5, 2:1 and 2:1.5 suggested that the LDH nanosheets grew in different directions on the surface of the Co3O4 nanowires, but when the molar ratio was increased to 2:3 they connected together to form larger flakes, indicating that the trend in the capacitance values can be related to changes in morphology and surface area.
Similarly, Quan et al.174 reported a 3D core/shell system based on Co3O4@NiMn-LDH (named CNMnL-m), a highly porous nanostructured material with superior electrochemical behavior due to glucose intercalation in between the NiMn-LDH layers. The intercalated glucose molecules play a significant role by increasing the interlamellar distance, thus improving the ionic diffusion in the interlamellar space and consequently the electrochemical behavior. The hierarchical 3D structure of Co3O4@NiMn-LDH is shown in the TEM image of Fig. 14D, where it is possible to observe that the Co3O4 nanowires are homogeneously coated by NiMn-LDH, since Co is concentrated in the nanowires and Ni, Mn, O, and C are distributed along the nanowire structure, evidencing the formation of a core@shell nanomaterial (Fig. 14E). The Co3O4@NiMn-LDH presented a good specific capacitance of 1644 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and the hybrid supercapacitor assembled with the material as the positive electrode (Fig. 14F) exhibited a high energy density of 38.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1, as well as an excellent capacitance retention of 89.1% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH solution (Fig. 14G), being able to light up a LED (Fig. 14H) when in tandem. The energy density and power density values were similar to devices built with LDH composites and core@shell oxide-hydroxides with a conducting material such as rGO and a negative carbonaceous material electrode (AC) such as in NiMn-LDH/rGO//AC (21.20 W h kg−1 at 850 W kg−1),176 CoAl-LDH/rGO//AC (25.1 W h kg−1 at 875 W kg−1)177 and Co3O4@Ni(OH)2//rGO (18.4 W h kg−1 at 1661 W kg−1).178
These results demonstrated that the combination of Co-oxide and LDHs in integrated 3D architectures enhanced the electrochemical properties due to the enhanced surface area and synergic effects in the 3D nanostructured materials.
4.2. Mn-oxide/LDHs
Manganese oxides (Mn-oxide) such as MnO2 and Mn2O3 have been widely used as electroactive materials in SCs, due to their low cost, environmentally friendly nature and high theoretical pseudocapacitance (∼1370 F g−1).179 However, Mn-oxides have a poor electric conductivity (10−5 to 10−6 S cm−1) that seriously impairs their eventual real applications.180 Carbon materials, such as graphene, have been used as an alternative to enhance the electrical conductivity of Mn oxides. However, the results were not as expected, since their pseudocapacitances did not greatly increase, even at low current densities during galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements.181,182 Indeed, a rGO/Mn3O4 material prepared by Rosaiah et al.183 showed a specific capacitance of 207.2 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, only about 25% higher than that of pure Mn3O4 (166.0 F g−1). Clearly other materials are required to boost the pseudocapacitance of manganese oxides, making them more competitive. Also, three-dimensional (3D) nanostructuration has emerged as an alternative to enhance the pseudocapacitance of Mn oxides in multi-component systems because that architecture tends to increase the density of electrochemically active sites while providing pathways for efficient ionic and electronic diffusion. From this perspective, 3D-LDH compounds have emerged as excellent materials to be combined with Mn oxides in multi-component systems to realize high performance electrode materials.
Zhao et al.184 reported a nanocomposite based on MnO2 nanowire/CoAl-LDH on carbon fibers (named MnO2/LDH/CFs) with a specific capacitance (944 F g−1) eight times that of MnO2/CFs (118 F g−1) at 1 A g−1, whereas Diao et al.185 realized CoAl-LDH/MnO2 with an even higher capacitance of 1088 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. On the other hand, Wang et al.186 described a one-step electrodeposition process for the preparation of MnO2@NiAl-LDH porous flower-like nanostructures directly on nickel foam. This strategy was proven to be very interesting since it does not involve any laborious steps, and its deposition on the substrate can be properly controlled by the choice of suitable electrochemical parameters. The resultant multi-component system showed a specific capacitance of 1154 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, much larger than of pure MnO2 (439 F g−1) and NiAl-LDH (742 F g−1) when tested in a conventional three-electrode cell.
Zhao et al.187 reported a quasi-core@shell structure of NiCo-LDH/Mn3O4, where the multi-component system was obtained using a two-step electrodeposition procedure. The composite obtained after 400 s of electrodeposition, presented some Mn3O4 nanoneedles anchored on the surface of the NiCo-LDH nanosheets, but the whole surface was covered by Mn3O4 when the electrodeposition time was increased to 600 s (Fig. 15A and D). As a consequence, the specific charge capacity of this composite material (628.7 C g−1) was lower than of NiCo-LDH (776.85 C g−1) and NiCo-LDH obtained after 400 seconds of electrodeposition (1034.3 C g−1), at 1 mA cm−2. In this sense, the control of the electrodeposition time was critical to achieve multi-component systems with superior electrochemical performance. In addition, the NiCo-LDH/Mn3O4//AC hybrid SC delivered an energy density of 57.03 W h kg−1 at a power density of 765.8 W kg−1.

In recent years, the exfoliation-restacking process has emerged as an excellent methodology to develop layered multi-component systems.189,190 Indeed, Huang et al.191 used a formamide solution to exfoliate CoAl-LDH and restack it on a rGO surface via electrostatic interactions. The resultant composite material presented a specific capacitance of 1296 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good charge retention of 90.5% after 1000 charge–discharge cycles. Quan et al.188 produced a new composite based on NiMn-LDH and birnessite-MnO2 (Fig. 15E) by exfoliation in formamide and restacking via the electrostatic self-assembly of the positively-charged LDH nanosheets by dropwise addition into a solution of the negatively-charged TMO nanosheets, under stirring. The composite showed good electrochemical performance in both alkaline and neutral media (Fig. 15F–I), and the assembled composite//AC hybrid supercapacitor presented an energy density of 16 W h kg−1 at 15 kW kg−1 in alkaline medium, and 13 W h kg−1 at 9 kW kg−1 in neutral medium.
4.3. Other oxide/LDH ternary materials
Other transition metal oxides combined with LDHs have been investigated as electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitors,192–196 as listed in Table 4. Among these electrode materials, those developed by Zhenhua et al.195 and Shuxing et al.197 and used to assemble a new set of highly flexible and versatile hybrid SCs that can be used either connected to portable or wearable electronic devices deserve to be highlighted. Although flexible electrodes based on materials such as metal oxides, carbon materials, and conductive polymers have been reported since 2011,198–200 their practical application as positive electrode materials in energy storage devices has been hindered by their poor electrochemical performance. However, Zhenhua et al.195 developed a flexible core@shell material based on 205 nm diameter CuO nanowires (core) and a 146 nm thick shell of CoFe-LDH nanoplatelets supported on copper wire (Fig. 16A), as confirmed by TEM (Fig. 16B). The electrode material maintained 82.1% of its specific capacitance at 20 mA cm−2 and, interestingly, there was no change in the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves when the device was bent with different curvatures. In fact, 93% capacitance was retained even when the device was bent at 180° (Fig. 16C), demonstrating the superior electrochemical behavior even under adverse or extreme situations.

Similarly, Shuxing et al.197 reported a hierarchical CuO@CoxNi1−x(OH)2 nanowire array material that presents an ultrahigh specific charge capacity of 374.7 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, and an exceptional rate capability of 301.7 mA h g−1 at 50 A g−1, and cycling stability of 95.9% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, they built a CuO@CoxNi1−x(OH)2//AC hybrid SC that delivered an energy density of 46.5 W h kg−1 and a power density of 526.9 W kg−1.
Also, multi-component systems combining binary transition metal oxides such as NiCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4, metal oxide derivatives of Co3O4, and LDHs have been explored given their excellent electrical conductivity and superior electrochemical performance.192–194 Thus, binary transition metal oxides have been used in the preparation of hierarchical core@shell materials. In fact, Bai et al.192 developed two multi-component systems based on ZnCo2O4@CoAl-LDH and ZnCo2O4@NiAl-LDH, showing a high specific capacitance of 2041 and 1586 F g−1, respectively. In addition, the ZnCo2O4@CoAl-LDH//AC and ZnCo2O4@NiCo-LDH//AC hybrid SCs showed energy densities of 50.1 and 27.8 W h kg−1 respectively. Furthermore, they connected a commercial solar cell with an as-assembled solid state ZnCo2O4@CoAl-LDH//AC hybrid SC in order to evaluate the behavior of a system integrating the energy conversion and storage processes (Fig. 16D–F). The charging of the hybrid supercapacitor by the solar cell was carried out in the daytime, increasing the potential to 1.49 V, and the subsequent discharge at a current density of 0.3 A g−1 was recorded in the dark, as shown in Fig. 16D. Moreover, a commercial lamp was used to simulate sunlight and charge two ZnCo2O4@CoAl-LDH//AC hybrid supercapacitors connected in series to a LED (Fig. 16E and F) and to a solar cell (Fig. 16E). The charged devices were able to light the LEDs in the dark (Fig. 16F).
5. Summary and outlook
Hybrid supercapacitor devices are standing out in the field of energy storage devices due to their unique features, combining the long-life cycle and high-power density of supercapacitive materials with the high energy density of battery-type materials in a single device. Among the several positive electrode materials, those based on transition metal oxides are the most promising since they can exhibit multiple valence states for the storage of charge equivalents, even though they generally have too low a conductivity for real practical applications. In this context, state-of-the-art positive electrodes of hybrid SCs have been designed based on at least three main strategies to boost the specific charge capacity, charge–discharge rates, the rate capability and cyclability, or in other words, to enhance the energy and power density of the electrodes and the operation time of the energy storage devices via (a) hetero-atom incorporation, (b) nanostructuration by hierarchical core@shell and/or realization of furry morphology and mesoporous systems, and (c) combination with other suitable materials to produce nanocomposites. The first two strategies are aimed at improving the electrochemical properties of the oxide materials by directly modifying their structures and morphologies to achieve superior electronic and ionic diffusion characteristics, activating as large as possible fraction of the electrochemically active sites, thus maximizing their charge capacities as well as other beneficial properties. The last strategy relies on the combination of materials with complimentary properties, while maximizing their electronic interactions and the surface area in order to achieve the desired results. In fact, the design of hierarchical core@shell nanostructured materials is a promising strategy to further improve the electrochemical performance of several materials, including transition metal oxides, since it can increase the porosity and surface area, the density of active sites, the ion-diffusion rate and the electrical conductivity, parameters directly related to the specific capacitance, but a more detailed, atomic-molecular level understanding is desirable to guide this process.
Trimetallic oxides based on doped spinels, mostly MxNiyCo3−x−yO4 (M = Zn, Mn, Cu and Mo) and MxCoyFe3−x−yO4 (M = Ni and Mn), and also non-spinel materials, especially NixCoyMo2−x−yO4, have been recently investigated aimed at their application in SC devices, which demonstrated exceptional performances in comparison to their mono- and bimetallic counterparts. Such improvements have been mainly attributed to synergistic effects, such as increased electron and ion diffusion rates, enhanced mechanical and chemical stability, larger surface areas and density of available electrochemically active sites. Additionally, further improvement was achieved by the production of nanocomposites with highly conducting materials such as PANI, PEDOT–PSS, and especially rGO, the composites of which presented the best results, as well as hierarchical core@shell nanostructuration using trimetallic oxide cores and pseudocapacitive shells (mainly MnO2 and NiWO4), providing a huge increase in surface area, electron and ion diffusion rate, and chemical stability. Thus, trimetallic oxides have been demonstrated to be extremely promising materials as the positive electrodes of hybrid supercapacitors, especially when coupled with strategic components of nanocomposites and core@shell nanomaterials. Similarly, the incorporation of Al3+ and/or Co2+/3+ ions has been shown to be an excellent strategy for improving the electrical conductivity of trimetallic LDHs, significantly increasing their rate capability and power densities, which were further improved by direct growth/deposition on highly conducting carbonaceous materials (e.g. AC,109 CC,110 CNTs,111 rGO112–118 and CNT/rGO119) and MXenes (V4C3Tx (ref. 122) or Ti3C2 (ref. 120)), and the preparation of nanocomposites with a furry morphology and mesoporous structure.91,127,128
The quest for increasingly higher power and energy density devices, including hybrid SC devices as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, is scaling up. To this aim, hollow trimetallic LTH nanocomposites127 exhibit huge prospects as high-performance electrode materials for the forthcoming generation of energy warehouses. Indeed, highly porous nanomaterials with 3D core@shell architectures are emerging as the most suitable electrode materials, given their exceptionally high surface areas, specific capacitances and efficient ion and electron diffusion rates. These characteristics have also been realized in multi-component systems prepared via the synergistic combination of TLDHs with transition metal oxides such as Co3O4 and ZnCo2O4.174,192 In addition, highly flexible electrode materials based on CuO and LDH195,197 core@shell nanostructures have been realized, opening up new prospects for the development of energy storage systems, especially for wearable electronic devices. In short, strategies based on the development of nanostructured layered oxide materials and their nanocomposites, especially highly porous 3D core@shell architecture nanomaterials, have been very successful, where trimetallic oxides, ternary LDHs and multicomponent systems, realized via the combination of mono- and/or bimetallic oxides and hydroxides, are exhibiting exceptionally high performance as electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitors, opening up bright new prospects in the field of energy storage devices. Although more complex multi-component 3D-materials can be devised, probably a more fundamental understanding and systematization of the knowledge on the synergic, cooperative and/or additive interactions and effect on the oxide materials themselves, as well as composites, based on a more integrated and systematic theoretical-experimental approach, may bring more interesting rewards than simply digging deeper into electrode materials with ever increasing degrees of complexity.
