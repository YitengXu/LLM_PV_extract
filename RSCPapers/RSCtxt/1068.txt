1. Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been investigated extensively because of their advantages, such as high efficiency, low cost, environmental-friendliness, low incident-light-angle dependence, and so on.1–9 The working principles of DSSCs are based on an electrochemical junction or heterojunction that contains three media: electron conductor, sensitizer, and hole conductor.2,3,5,7 The Ru-complex dye and iodide–triiodide electrolyte are, respectively, the optimal sensitizer and hole conductor employed so far in terms of their efficient charge transport capability in DSSCs.10,11 The electron transport in a semiconductor medium, typically a nanocrystalline TiO2 film, is thus the key for device performance. The photogenerated electron in n-type TiO2 is a majority carrier and thus not subjected to depletion by holes. This is an advantage over solid-state solar cells, which are minority carrier devices. For DSSCs under low-intensity illumination, however, the concentration of photogenerated electron is low and the rate of charge transfer in TiO2 media, as well as that of charge recombination, is predominantly governed by the density of trap states in TiO2. How the multiple-trapping electron transport in the TiO2 film can be enhanced via property-tuning of TiO2, especially under low-intensity illumination, is worthy of in-depth exploration.
There are many charge trap sites located at the grain boundaries and the surface of nanocrystalline films. The injected electrons may be multiply captured by the trap states in the diffusion process, hence the trapping/detrapping event is a dominant mechanism for electron transport in DSSCs.4,7,12–15 Although the existence of a large number of bulk and surface traps is commonly accepted, their density as a function of energy in the band-gap is still under discussion. An exponential distribution of these traps was suggested.16–20 The band-gap trap states are occupied with electrons when their energy levels are lower than the quasi-Fermi level (Fig. 1). Therefore, under low-intensity illumination the electron transport is to be significantly impeded due to the presence of a larger number of unoccupied trap states. To promote electron transport, a previous study reported that dopant introduction was able to increase the n-type carrier concentration of TiO2 films and thus to reduce the film resistance.21 We thereby consider heteroatom-doping an effective way to enhance the electron mobility in DSSCs.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration showing the trap distribution and the multiple trapping/detrapping process occurring in two types of nanocrystalline TiO2 films, bare and Zn-doped. The trap states with energy levels situated between the conduction band edge (CB) and quasi-Fermi level (EFn) are empty and available for the electron trapping/detrapping event, while the trap states with their energy levels lower than EFn are occupied with electrons. 
In this study, we present our findings of enhancing electron mobility in DSSCs by doping the TiO2 films with Zn ion, which has a size similar to that of Ti ion and an oxide structure22,23 with an intrinsically high donor density. We develop a method to introduce Zn substituting for Ti, thus to effectively disperse Zn in the TiO2 films. A homogeneous distribution of Zn ions in the TiO2 films will minimize the defect states resulting from this substitution. The Zn-doping is shown to significantly alleviate the decay of the light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs at low illumination intensity. This would enormously extend the indoor application of DSSCs. The effects of Zn-doping on DSSC performance are interpreted in relation to the obtained material properties and electronic mobility.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Physical characterization of TiO2
TiO2nanoparticle specimens with varying Zn contents were prepared for fabricating the TiO2 films in DSSCs. A titanate derived from 130 °C hydrothermal treatment on commercially-available TiO2 in an NaOH solution (10 N) was used as the precursor for the TiO2nanoparticles.24,25 The titanate has a layered structure allowing Zn intercalation and can readily transform into anatase via further hydrothermal treatment at 240 °C. Table 1 lists some TiO2 specimens with their Zn contents determined with atomic absorption spectroscopy. The specimens with Zn/Ti atomic ratios of 0.2, 0.4, 0.7 and 1.2 at% are designated as TZ02, TZ04, TZ07, and TZ12, respectively. The bare-TiO2 represents the nanoparticle specimen without Zn-doping. These TiO2 specimens were mixed with polyethylene glycol and then coated on a conducting glass substrate, F-doped SnO2 (FTO) overlayer glass, with subsequent calcination to form nanocrystalline TiO2 films. By taking the TZ04 film as a representative, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 2(a) depicts that the TiO2nanoparticles in the film are randomly oriented with their diameter ranging within 10–20 nm. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum of the TZ04 film indicates that Ti and O are the major elements, with about 0.4 at% Zn/Ti contained in the film (see the ESI†). Fig. 2(b) shows the SEM-EDS Zn elemental mapping image of the same area in Fig. 2(a). The location of the Zn element indicates that the Zn element is highly dispersed in the Zn-doped TiO2 film.

Fig. 3(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the TiO2 specimens. The standard pattern of TiO2 anatase documented in the powder diffraction file of JCPDS is shown at the bottom of Fig. 3(a).26 The TiO2 specimens with Zn contents lower than 0.7 at% were phase-pure anatase without any other phases observed in their XRD patterns. The titanate-directed route has been reported to synthesize phase-pure TiO2 anatase nanoparticles.27,28 However, there is presence of rutile in the TiO2 specimens with high Zn contents (i.e. TZ07 and TZ12). The structural defects introduced by the Zn-doping may have interacted with the surrounding anatase crystal and provoked the nucleation and growth of rutile crystals.29
 Fig. 3  (a) XRD patterns of the TiO2 specimens with different degrees of Zn-doping; (b) the magnification of the anatase (101) and (200) peaks of the specimens. 
Because Zn2+ can intercalate into the layered titanate, the dissolution of Zn2+ ions into the lattice of the consequent TiO2 products would occur.24 The ionic radius of Zn2+ (74 pm) is larger than that of Ti4+ (60 pm).30,31 Thus, substituting Zn2+ for Ti4+ may lead to TiO2 lattice expansion. Fig. 3(b) shows that the 2-theta positions of two TiO2 anatase peaks, (101) and (200), have a slight shift toward a smaller value with Zn-doping. The shift corresponds to expansion of the TiO2 lattices; i.e., the spacings d101 and d200 were 3.521 and 1.894 Å, respectively, for bare-TiO2 and increased to 3.526 and 1.896 Å for TZ12, based on calculations using the Bragg’s law.32 This suggests that through the titanate-directed route the Zn2+ ions were incorporated into the TiO2 crystalline framework, leading to ZnxTi1−xO2 formation.
To understand how the Zn-doping would promote electron transport in the TiO2 films, the electronic properties of the TiO2 films have to be identified. We analyzed the donor density and Fermi level of the nanocrystalline TiO2electrodes by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy along with the Mott–Schottky equation,33–35i.e. (1)where C represents the capacitance of the space charge region, ε0 the vacuum permittivity, ε the dielectric constant of the TiO2 layer, e the electron charge, E the applied potential, EF the Fermi level potential, k the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, and ND the donor density. The temperature term is generally small and can be neglected. The impedance measurements of the TiO2 films were conducted in a solution of 1 M KNO3 to determine the values of C at different applied potentials. Fig. 4 shows the typical results of the capacitance variation. According to the Mott–Schottky equation, a linear relationship of C−2vs. E can be observed. The Zn-doping has led to changes in the slope and intercept of the linear relationship. The slope and intercept were used to calculate the donor density and Fermi level, which are summarized in Table 1 for different TiO2 films. For doping levels lower than 0.4 at%, the substitution of Zn2+ for Ti4+gave rise to an increase in the donor density, with a corresponding negative shift of the Fermi level. However, with further doping with Zn the donor density was remained unchanged while the Fermi level exhibited a substantial negative shift (see Table 1). We suspected that the high degrees of Zn-doping resulted in significant structure change of the TiO2 films.
 Fig. 4  Variation of capacitance of the bare-TiO2 and Zn-doped TiO2 films with the applied potential in 1 M KNO3 presented in the Mott–Schottky relationship. The capacitance was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The TiO2 films had a thickness of ca. 10 μm. 

Fig. 1 illustrates a schematic drawing that compares the electron transport behaviors in different TiO2 nanocrystalline films. Band bending occurs near the TiO2 surface due to depletion of the mesoporous TiO2 films upon immersion in the electrolyte. With Zn-doping, the elevated Fermi level, as shown in Table 1, can increase the slope of downward band bending within the TiO2nanoparticles. As indicated in Fig. 1, the number of empty traps (with energy levels between the bottom of conduction band and the quasi-Fermi level) is reduced as a result of the enhanced downward band bending. Because of the decrease in the number of empty trap states, the frequency of the multiple-trapping event can be minimized, leading to higher mobility for electrons in the Zn-doped TiO2 film. This influence would be especially prominent in a low-intensity illumination situation, in which the probability of a travelling electron to be localized by trap states is great.
2.2 Photocurrent–voltage characterization of DSSCs
The bare-TiO2 and Zn-doped TiO2 films were sensitized with a ruthenium complex dye (N3) and assembled into DSSCs. Fig. 5 shows some representative photocurrent–voltage curves of the cells equipped with the TiO2 films (ca. 15 μm) of varying Zn contents under AM1.5-type solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The Zn-doping did not have obvious influence on the performance of the cells for Zn contents within 0–0.7 at%. A high Zn content (e.g. 1.2 at%) devastated the electron-conducting role of the TiO2 film, thereby leading to poor performance of the consequent cell. Fig. 6 summarizes the performance indices of the cells assembled with TiO2 films of different Zn contents. The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and the light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency (η) increase with the Zn-doping to reach a maximum at a Zn/Ti ratio of 0.4 at% and then decrease, as shown in Fig. 6(a). This suggests that the electron transport in the TiO2 films can be promoted by an optimized degree of Zn-doping. On the other hand, the Zn impurities may also serve as the recombination centers for charges. This is reflected by Fig. 6(b), showing a consistent decrease in the fill factor with the increasing Zn/Ti ratio. The suppression of cell performance at high degrees of Zn-doping can be ascribed to the introduction of high-concentration impurities. A higher recombination rate generally leads to a smaller open-circuit voltage (Voc). However, Fig. 6(b) shows higher open-circuit voltages obtained with some degree of Zn-doping. The higher Voc should result from the elevated Fermi level. The results in Fig. 6 suggest that with well-controlled Zn-doping the low-Voc disadvantage due to increased recombination can be offset by the elevation of the TiO2 Fermi-level.

The TiO2 films had a thickness of ca. 15 μm. 
Because 0.4 at% of Zn-doping exhibited an optimum performance for DSSCs, we further compare the performance of the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells under illumination with reduced light intensity. The photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells at varying light intensity (I) are shown in ESI†. The ratio of Jsc/I, which is equivalent to the apparent incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), was calculated and the results are shown in Fig. 7(a). For the bare-TiO2cell, the apparent IPCE decreases with the light intensity, especially in the low intensity regime. This indicates that recombination through intermediate trapping events becomes important at low light intensity because the frequency for a travelling electron to be trapped would be high when the electron concentration in conduction band is low. On the other hand, the apparent IPCE remains constant for the TZ04 cell. The reduction of the empty trap state density via Zn-doping must have suppressed the rate of recombination from trap states. We will further discuss this aspect in this paper by using intensity-modulated spectroscopic techniques. Because of the great difference in the apparent IPCE, Fig. 7(b) shows that the η value at low illumination intensity is significantly larger for the TZ04 cell relative to that of the bare-TiO2cell. An enhancement of the η value by ca. 23% was achieved with this Zn-doping at light intensity as low as 11 mW cm−2.

2.3 Intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopic analysis of DSSCs
To explicitly understand how the Zn-doping would affect the electron transport in the TiO2 films under low-intensity illumination, we subjected the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells to analysis with intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) that gives the transit time of electrons from photogenerated injection to collection by conducting glass. Typical IMPS complex plane plots can be seen in Fig. 8(a), in which the cells were short-circuited and illuminated with a blue light-emitting diode (λmax = 455 nm) at 10 mW cm−2 (corresponding to a photon flux of 2.3 × 1016 cm−2 s−1). The photocurrent divided by the photon flux as a photocurrent conversion efficiency (Φ, uncorrected for reflection losses) is used to give the IMPS plots, which show the real and imaginary components of the conversion efficiency, Re(Φ) and Im(Φ), respectively. Some characteristic modulation frequency values are pointed out in the plots. The ultimate value of Re(Φ) at the low-frequency limit corresponds to the IPCE at λ = 455 nm. In agreement with the results obtained from the characterization in Fig. 7, this ultimate Re(Φ) is larger for the TZ04 cell relative to that of the bare-TiO2cell (0.67 vs. 0.59). The difference in photon energy conversion could be related to the transport behavior of the photogenerated electrons in the TiO2 film.
 Fig. 8  Complex plane plots of the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells obtained from (a) IMPS and (b) IMVS measurements with incident dc light (λmax = 455 nm) intensity of 10 and 15 mW cm−2, respectively. The TiO2 films had a thickness of ca. 15 μm. 
The IMPS plots in Fig. 8(a) comprise two flattened semicircles: the high- and low-frequency ones, corresponding to the trap-free and trap-limited IMPS responses, respectively.36 The two-semicircle feature occurs when there are some defect states in which the residence time of a trapped electron is longer than the trap-free transit time.36 Therefore, the trap-free semicircle is generally observed with a thick TiO2 film because the trap sites of TiO2 near the current collector are mostly filled by electrons generated over the whole film thickness.28,37Fig. 8(a) shows that the larger ultimate Re(Φ) for the TZ04 cell can primarily be attributed to its larger trap-free semicircle relative to that of the bare-TiO2cell. This indicates that in the vicinity of the current collector the TiO2 film with electron traps mostly filled is thicker for the TZ04 cell. The mean electron transit time (τd) can be calculated from the relation τd = (2πfmin)−1, where fmin is the frequency at the bottom of the semicircle observed in the IMPS plots.13,38 The τd of the trap-free and trap-limited response in the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells were determined from fmin obtained for varying photon flux intensity (I0). Fig. 9 shows the photon flux dependence of τd for the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells. The transit times for both trap-free and trap-limited processes are smaller for TZ04 than for bare-TiO2. Obviously, an optimal Zn-doping promotes electron transfer in a TiO2 film.
 Fig. 9  Mean electron transit time (τd) and mean electron life time (τn) obtained at varying photon flux (λmax = 455 nm) intensity (I0) for the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells according to IMPS and IMVS measurements. The TiO2 films had a thickness of ca. 15 μm. 
Since the trapping probability of an electron is greater at a lower electron concentration in the conduction band, the value of τd decreases with increasing photon flux. The double logarithmic representation of the data in Fig. 9 allows for expressing the trap-free transport in the form of the power law τd∝I0−0.81 in the bare-TiO2 and τd∝I0−0.71 in TZ04. Because the trapping frequency is reduced by Zn-doping, the electron transfer rate becomes less dependent on the photon flux. This is beneficial for low-intensity operation. A similar conclusion can be drawn for the trap-limited process on the basis of the photon flux dependence of τd shown in Fig. 9.
We also analyzed the electron life time by using intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) at open-circuit conditions. The typical IMVS plots of the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells illuminated at 15 mW cm−2 (λmax = 455 nm) are shown in Fig. 8(b). The mean electron life time (τn) was obtained from the IMVS plots according to the relation τn = (2πfmin′)−1, where fmin′ is the frequency at the bottom of the semicircle.13,38 The values of τn obtained from varying light intensity are shown in Fig. 9 to compare with those of τd. The value of τn for TZ04 is slightly smaller than that for bare-TiO2 due to the promoted charge recombination by Zn-doping, as was expected from the fill factor data (Fig. 6(b)). However, the ratio of life time to transit time is the appropriate index used to interpret the electron collection efficiency. Fig. 9 shows that for both the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells the life time is approximately two orders of magnitude longer than the trap-free τd, indicating a high collection efficiency for electron transfervia this process. For the trap-limited process, the bare-TiO2cell has τn values close to its τd values, especially at low light intensity. With Zn-doping, the TZ04 cells shows τn values of nearly one order of magnitude greater than its trap-limited τd for the entire light intensity range employed. This observation for the trap-limited electron transport justifies our argument that Zn-doping can minimize the trapping–detrapping event to sustain efficient charge collection over a wide range of light intensity.
Some previous studies used together the short-circuit τd measured by IMPS and open-circuit τn by IMVS to estimate the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) of DSSCs.13,39,40 However, the observed values of τd and τn are strongly dependent on the position of quasi-Fermi level.41,42 Thereby the apparent ηcc determined by using the present IMPS and IMVS results would be misleading. Alternatively, we further conduct electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis on the cells to estimate ηcc at a specified condition.
2.4 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis of DSSCs
An impedance spectroscopy, which distinguishes the resistance and capacitance of a device, was further employed to analyze the electron transport behavior in the DSSCs. Fig. 10 shows the impedance spectra of the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells measured at a forward bias of 0.72 V under AM1.5-type solar illumination of 11 and 100 mW cm−2. The spectra are composed of three arcs situated in high, intermediate, and low frequency regimes.43,44 The high and low frequency arcs correspond to the charge transfer behavior at Pt/electrolyte interface and the Nernst impedance of triiodide in electrolyte, respectively.43–45 A larger arc appearing at intermediate frequencies is due to the contribution of electron transfer in the nanocrystalline TiO2 film. This intermediate-frequency arc is the major concern here.
 Fig. 10  Nyquist impedance plots of the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells obtained under AM1.5-type solar illumination of 11 and 100 mW cm−2. The frequency ranging is from 0.2 Hz to 100 kHz at a forward bias of 0.72 V with an ac potential amplitude of 10 mV. The TiO2 films had a thickness of ca. 14 μm. 
According to the analysis with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the mean electron life time (τn,EIS) in TiO2 can be calculated from the relation τn,EIS = (2πfmax)−1, where fmax is the frequency at the top of the intermediate-frequency arc.44 The τn,EIS value of the bare-TiO2 and TZ04 cells were thus determined and the data are listed in Table 2. A smaller τn,EIS was observed at a higher illumination intensity. The observed faster recombination at higher intensity is expected because the concentrations of both injected electrons and triiodide are larger.46 Again, a faster recombination in TZ04 may result from introduction of Zn impurities.

The value of ηcc was determined from eqn (4). The TiO2 films had a thickness of ca. 14 μm

Bisquert and co-workers have analyzed the charge transport resistance at various interfaces in DSSCs.43,44,47 Accordingly, Fig. 11 shows an equivalent circuit to describe the interfaces in a DSSC. In this circuit, the electron transport and recombination characteristics of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film component is interpreted using the transmission line model.47,48 We used this equivalent circuit to simulate the impedance spectra in Fig. 10 and obtained the resistance values at different interfaces (see the ESI†). The electron transport resistance (Rt) and the interfacial charge recombination resistance (Rct) are the two critical circuit elements to determine the value of ηcc at the FTO front contact. The mean electron transit time, τd,EIS, can be obtained according to49 (2)The values of τd,EIS are listed in Table 2.
 Fig. 11  Equivalent circuit for the simulation of the impedance spectra of the DSSCs. (see the ESI†) This equivalent circuit employs the transmission line model to analyze the electron transport and recombination characteristics of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film component in DSSCs. The circuit elements relating to TiO2 film are the electron transport resistance, Rt (=rtL), the interfacial charge recombination resistance, Rct (=rct/L), and the chemical capacitance produced by the accumulation of electrons in the TiO2 film, Cμ (=cμL), with L being the TiO2 film thickness. Other elements involved in the equivalent circuit include the sheet resistance of the conducting glass, RS, the charge transfer resistance and interfacial capacitance at the Pt/electrolyte interface, RPt and CPt, respectively, and finally the Nernst impedance, ZN, with a dc resistance, RN, showing the diffusion behavior of the redox species in the electrolyte. 
A smaller τd,EIS was observed at higher illumination intensity due to a lesser degree of electron trapping. At 100 mW cm−2, τd,EIS of TZ04 is smaller than that of the bare-TiO2cell by 38%, as shown in Table 2. At low illumination intensity of 11 mW cm−2, the reduction of τd,EIS due to Zn-doping was increased to more than 50%. This analysis indicates again that the Zn-doping effectively minimizes the trapping–detrapping event to promote the electron transport at low illumination intensity.

Table 2 also shows the chemical capacitance (Cμ) produced by the accumulation of electrons in the TiO2 film. This chemical capacitance describes the change of electron density under a small variation of the Fermi level.17,48,50 Thus, the value of Cμ gives the total density of free electrons in the TiO2 conduction band and localized electrons in the trap states.41,45 The TZ04 film had a smaller capacitance value than the bare-TiO2 film. This supports the argument that due to Zn-doping less photogenerated electrons are captured by the empty trap states in the Zn-doped film.
The apparent value of ηcc can now be estimated on the basis of the τd,EIS and τn,EIS data. Because the photogenerated electrons transport forward in the TiO2 film and recombine with the triiodide ions, the charge collection rate at the FTO front contact is (3)where τcc is the time constant for charge collection. Accordingly, ηcc can be written as (4)The values of ηcc were calculated and are shown in Table 2. Under illumination of 100 mW cm−2, the ηcc value of the TZ04 cell was slightly larger than that of the bare-TiO2cell (83% vs. 74%). However, the ηcc value at low illumination intensity (11 mW cm−2) is significantly larger for the TZ04 cell relative to that of the bare-TiO2cell (76% vs. 53%). The results reveal again that TiO2 films with Zn-doping can sustain efficient electron collection over a wide range of light intensity. The enhanced electron transport rate plays the major role in preserving the overall light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency at low illumination intensity.
3. Experimental
TiO2nanoparticles derived from a titanate were used to constitute the electron conductor film for DSSCs.27,28 To prepare the titanate, 3 g of a commercially-available TiO2 powder (Degussa AG P25, Japan) was mixed with 100 mL of 10 N NaOH (J.T. Baker, Sweden) and the mixture was subjected to hydrothermal treatment in an autoclave at 130 °C for 20 h. The resulting slurry was washed with 0.1 N HNO3 (Showa, Japan) to reach a pH value of ca. 1.5. A titanate with layered structure was formed by this acid washing. 24,25,51–54 To prepare Zn-loaded titanate, an appropriate amount of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Riedel-de Haën, Germany) was added to the TiO2–NaOH mixture for hydrothermal treatment, which was also followed by the acid washing. The colloidal TiO2 suspension, either bare or Zn-loaded, was obtained by autoclaving the low-pH titanate slurries at 240 °C for 12 h.
We subjected the Zn-loaded TiO2 colloids to Zn-content analysis with atomic absorption spectroscopy (GBC Sens AA, Australia). The phase identification of the synthesized TiO2 specimens was conducted with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a diffractometer (Rigaku RINT2000, Japan) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Temperature of data collection is 25 °C. These specimens were calcined at 450 °C in air for 30 min prior to the above XRD analysis.
To prepare TiO2 films for DSSCs, each of the TiO2 suspensions from 240 °C autoclaving was mixed with polyethylene glycol (PEG, 20,000 in molecular weight; Fluka, Germany) to form a viscous TiO2 dispersion at a PEG/TiO2 ratio of 0.4. The dispersion was then spread onto a conducting glass substrate (FTO overlayer glass; Hartford Glass TEC 8, USA). The apparent area of the coating was 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm. The TiO2-coated glass was subsequently calcined at 450 °C in air for 30 min to form a mesoporous TiO2 film, which was used as the substrate for dye sensitization.
Prior to DSSC fabrication, the nanostructures of the Zn-doped TiO2 film was explored with a scanning electron microscope (Jeol JSM-6700F, Japan). Elemental mapping of the Zn-doped TiO2 film was studied by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy attached to SEM.
The Fermi level potential and donor density of the TiO2 films were analyzed by impedance spectroscopy using an impedance spectrum analyzer (Zahner IM6e, Germany) equipped with the Thales software. In the present work, the measurements were performed by applying a sinusoidal potential perturbation with a small amplitude (10 mV), superimposed on a fixed dc potential varying within an appropriate potential windows from −1 to 0 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) in 1 M KNO3 (Riedel-de Haën, Germany). The TiO2 films used for the impedance analysis had a film thickness of ca. 10 μm.
The ruthenium complex dye, N3 (cis-di(thiocyanate)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium (II); ruthenium 535, Solaronix SA, Switzerland), was used as the sensitizer for DSSCs. The dye-sensitized TiO2electrode and a Pt-coated conducting glass were assembled to form a cell by sandwiching a redox (I/I3−) electrolyte solution, which was composed of 0.1 M LiI (Aldrich, USA), 0.05 M I2 (Riedel-de Haën, Germany), 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (Solaronix SA, Switzerland), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich, Germany) in acetonitrile (J.T. Baker, USA).
In the cell performance test, an Oriel 300 W Xe lamp served as a light source in conjunction with an IR filter (Oriel 59044, USA). The AM1.5 Globle filter (Oriel 81094, USA) was placed in the light beam to simulate the AM1.5-type solar emission. The light intensity ranged between 11 and 100 mW cm−2. The Xe lamp was attenuated if necessary by UV fused silica metallic neutral density filter (Newport FSQ-ND01, 02, 03 and 10, USA).
IMPS and IMVS were carried out using a blue diode laser (λmax = 455 nm), which is driven by a frequency response analyzer (Zahner XPOT, Germany). The light intensity was modulated (±5%) by modulating the voltage that applied to the LED with sinusoidal perturbation. The modulation frequency range is from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz for IMPS and from 0.1 Hz to 102 kHz for IMVS. The light intensity range is from 0.5 to 15 mW cm−2 for IMPS and from 0.3 to 15 mW cm−2 for IMVS. The DSSCs used for the cell performance and IMPS/IMVS measurements had a TiO2-film thickness of ca. 15 μm.
The ac impedance spectrum analyzer was also employed to measure and analyze the impedance behavior of the DSSCs under illumination. In this work, the measurements were conducted at a forward bias of 0.72 V with an ac potential amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range of 0.2 Hz to 50 kHz. The spectra were obtained under AM1.5-type solar illumination of 11 and 100 mW cm−2 and the light source was same as that in the cell performance test. The TiO2 films used for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy had a film thickness of ca. 14 μm.
4. Conclusions
A Zn-doped TiO2 can be synthesized viaZn2+ introduction into a layered titanate followed by hydrothermal treatment and calcination. The density of empty trap states for electron localization is smaller for the Zn-doped TiO2 films relative to that of the bare-TiO2 film due to increased band bending resulting from the elevated electron Fermi level. Therefore, optimized Zn-doping is shown to significantly alleviate the decay of the light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs at low illumination intensity. IMPS and IMVS measurements reveal that the difference between electron life time and transit time is large enough over a wide range of light intensity for the Zn-doped cell, thereby ensuring the high performance of the cell. The electron transit time shortening due to Zn-doping plays the major role responsible for the high performance. The chemical capacitance data obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis supports the argument that the Zn-doping minimizes the localization of photogenerated electrons by trap states. As a result, the charge collection efficiency of the Zn-doped film remains at considerably high levels under low-intensity illumination, in which trapping–detrapping is the dominant mechanism.
