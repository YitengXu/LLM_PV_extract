    , Accepted 29th March 2023First published on 29th March 2023AbstractPre-designing starting materials is a sensible approach to tailor the synthetic, optoelectronic, and physicochemical properties of a photocatalyst towards higher activity without the need for additional active species. MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2, a metal–organic framework (MOF) photocatalytically active for H2 evolution, was first successfully synthesised at a relatively low temperature of 70 °C upon employing pre-designed titanium-oxo-carboxylate clusters. While rearrangement of the original cluster enabled successful MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 formation, its ligand stoichiometry favoured MOFs with abundant “defects” at the Ti centres which in turn acted as accessible active sites for H2 generation. The catalytic sites and their local geometry were studied by pyridine-adsorbed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Interestingly, the frameworks prepared using pre-designed titanium-oxo clusters can alter electronic optical properties and energy levels. In the presence of triethanolamine as an electron donor and under visible light irradiation, this led to a ∼3.5 times higher H2 evolution rate in the titanium-oxo cluster MOF compared to MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 obtained by typical hydrothermal synthesis. The obtained catalyst also exhibits a good-reusable performance for at least three consecutive runs without any loss in its reactivity. Pre-designed clusters can be simply utilised to generate accessible active sites and manipulate electrical properties for enhancing catalytic performance.
1. Introduction
Energy sources which are environment friendly, inexhaustible, and possess high energy capacity represent a promising solution for the rapid increase in energy consumption.1,2 Solar light, as the most abundant energy source on Earth,3 has inspired significant work over the past decades towards photocatalytic fuel production from water splitting.4–6 However, further improvements in activities are needed with major bottlenecks in light harvesting efficiency, kinetics of the charge transfer process, electronic structures, and stability under photocatalytic reaction conditions.6–9
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) which consist of metal ions/clusters and organic linkers organised into crystalline 2D or 3D networks are promising candidates for effective photocatalysts due to their well-defined porous structures with high surface areas and plenty of metal active sites.10–12 MOF's attributes are amenable towards enabling photocatalytic reactivity owing to several modulation strategies such as ligand functionalisation, mixed-metal and mixed-linker approaches, and defect engineering.13–15 Recent development includes immobilising auxiliary noble-metal complexes to promote visible light absorption or to create accessible active sites for H2 production from water splitting.16–18 However, these strategies often rely on effective yet costly metals such as Pt, Ru, Ir and Re and lead to low loading, leaching and performance deactivation.7,19,20 Alternative development includes defect engineering and incorporation of expensive Pt particles to increase charge transfer, separation and catalytic activity.20–24
MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 MOFs are promising H2 evolution photocatalysts due to their visible-light responsivity and abundant redox active Ti4+-to-Ti3+ centres.25 They are built from affordable, commercially available amino-functionalised linkers and Ti precursors and display high structural robustness tolerating various organic solvents, water, and acidic/basic solutions as well as good photostability.17,26,27 Ti8O8(OH)4 node clusters are based on eight Ti4+ ions, eight μ2-O, four μ2-OH, and carboxylate groups from twelve NH2-BDC (2-aminobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid) ligands (Fig. S1a†). Furthermore, the high valent Ti4+ ions and carboxylate ligands are considered matching hard acids and bases, respectively.
Even though MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 MOFs provide important features required for photocatalysis, the optical response of the pristine framework is limited to <500 nm and needs to be developed to harvest more of the solar irradiation.17,20 The photocatalytic activity is also limited (typically ∼20 μmol H2 gMOF−1 h−1) by the lack of active reaction sites since pristine Ti-MOF clusters are theoretically fully coordinated (Fig. S1a†). In addition, typical MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 synthesis requires high temperature (>100 °C) posing limitations for low cost synthesis and bio-application.27,28 Several approaches have been studied to improve the catalytic performance of the pristine MOF.17,29 Interfacing Cu2+ at the NH2 group of organic linkers was shown to significantly enhance the light harvesting efficiency resulting in improved photocatalytic performance in the proton reduction reaction.30 The immobilisation of Pt nanoparticles also led to an enhanced production of H2.20 Alternatively, by encapsulating a Co(II)-based coordination complex, [CoII(TPA)Cl][Cl], TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine, the co-catalyst also enabled high photocatalytic H2 production.29 While these advances demonstrate the possibility to develop highly efficient MOF-based photocatalysts, they rely on the incorporation of additional active species, indirectly showcasing the challenges in devising intrinsic, cost- and synthesis-effective photocatalysts.
Herein, we aimed at producing a simply- and ready-made photocatalytic MOF that would not only act as an efficient light absorber, but also provide high activity towards H2 evolution. Conventionally, Ti precursors such as titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TPOT), titanium(IV) butoxide and TiCl4 have been used for the synthesis of Ti-based MOFs.31 However, because of the low electronegativity of Ti and the high polarising power of Ti4+ in solution, concomitant parasitic hydrolysis/condensation reactions (yielding titanium oxide) compete with MOF formation rendering pure Ti MOF occurrences rare.31,32
The Ti8O8(OOCC6H5)16 (Ti8Ph) cluster was recently introduced as a suitable precursor to synthesise MIL-125-(Ti) towards high surface area MOFs.33,34 Here, we aimed at capitalising on the structural difference between Ti8Ph and the Ti clusters of MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 towards promoting photocatalysis activity. While they share a similar octahedral Ti4+ unit, the two clusters hold a differing number of linkers/ligands as the pre-formed cluster contained eight Ti4+ centres bridged with eight μ2-O and sixteen benzoic acid (BA) ligands (i.e., four more than in MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2) (Fig. 1 and S1b†). We postulated that the rearrangement of the Ti8Ph cluster necessary to ensure MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 formation and topology will thus favour defect occurrences in MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 (Fig. 1) as a key, property-altering feature.
 Fig. 1  Defect engineering in MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 by using a Ti8Ph cluster precursor. Pre-designed titanium-oxo clusters yield accessible active sites towards photocatalytic H2 reduction. 
Correspondingly, the pre-designed Ti8Ph cluster first enabled production of MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2, at relatively low temperature, i.e., 70 °C. An increase in the number of linker-free sites was evidenced by pyridine-adsorbed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses. The electronic properties such as optical behaviour and energy levels were correspondingly positively affected, as shown by UV-vis and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As a result, the photocatalytic performances of Ti8Ph-based MOFs in H2 production were around 2.5 and 3.5 times higher than that of comparable MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 directly made from TPOT under visible light irradiation and higher than those in previous reports on pristine, precious metal-free MOFs. Our investigations suggest that this may be mainly ascribed to the alteration of coordination features on Ti centres leading to the great amount of accessible active sites.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TPOT, 97.0%), benzoic acid (BA, ≥99.5%), 2-aminoterephthalic acid (NH2-BDC, 99.0%), acetonitrile (CH3CN, ≥99.9%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, ≥99.9%), methanol (MeOH, ≥99.9%), and triethanolamine (TEOA, ≥99.0%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, US. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Material preparation

2.2.1. Synthesis of the titanium–oxo–carboxylate cluster (Ti8O8(OOCC6H5)16 (Ti8Ph)). 
The cluster was synthesised following a previously reported method with some modifications.34 6.50 g (53.0 mmol) of BA were dissolved in 51.5 mL of CH3CN and the solution was slowly dropped into a solution of TPOT (1.6 mL, 5.3 mmol) in 10.3 mL of CH3CN placed in a 100 mL screw capped glass bottle. After stirring for 5 min, the bottle was closed and transferred to an oven for heating at 100 °C for 15 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the resulting product was immediately filtered out. The collected Ti8Ph needles were then washed with 70 mL of CH3CN to remove the remaining BA and dried under vacuum at room temperature.


2.2.2. Synthesis of MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 (Ti8O8(OH)4(O2C–C6H3(NH2)–CO2)6 (Ti-MOF)). 
Ti-MOF was synthesised at 150 °C by the solvothermal method following a modified previously reported method.35 0.60 g (3.3 mmol) of NH2-BDC was dissolved in a solvent mixture of DMF and MeOH (6.0 mL and 2.0 mL, respectively). 0.6 mL (2.0 mmol) of TPOT was added to the mixture which was then sonicated at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was introduced into a 20 mL autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 16 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the resulting product was collected by centrifugation and then washed with fresh DMF twice and MeOH twice to remove the remaining unreacted organic linkers. The sample was further stirred with fresh MeOH for a day. The solvent exchange process was repeated twice to extract the remaining DMF in the as-synthesised MOF and the sample was then dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight. Finally, the product was activated under vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h to produce a fine powder in 73.0% yield.


2.2.3. Synthesis of MIL-125-(Ti8Ph)-NH2 (Ti8Ph-MOF). 
Ti8Ph-MOF was produced by employing a controlled secondary building unit approach (CSA) at 70 °C under solvothermal conditions. 0.12 g (47 μmol) of Ti8Ph cluster was dissolved in 5 mL of MeOH:DMF (1:1 (v/v)). 0.14 g (753.0 μmol) NH2-BDC was dissolved in 5 mL of a MeOH:DMF (1:1 (v/v)) mixture in a 20 mL screw jar. The Ti8Ph solution was then added into the NH2-BDC solution and heated at 70 °C for 72 h. After collecting the Ti8Ph-MOF, the powders were washed and activated like the Ti-MOF.


2.2.4. Synthesis of MIL-125-(Ti8Ph)-NH2 by using a modulator (Ti8Ph-BA-MOF). 
Ti8Ph-BA-MOF was also prepared following the abovementioned procedure for Ti8Ph-MOF but 0.18 g (1.5 mmol)/32 molar equivalents of BA were added to the solvent mixture of NH2-BDC before adding the mixture of the Ti8Ph cluster. The reaction was conducted for 24, 46 and 72 h. After collecting the Ti8Ph-BA-MOF, the powders were washed and activated like the Ti-MOF affording 72.0 (±1.5), 87.6 (±0.7) and 95.5 (±1.1)% yield, respectively.

2.3. Material characterisation
Phase purity and crystallinity of the synthesised samples were examined by using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Cu X-ray radiation, Rigaku, MiniFlex 600-C, Japan). The morphologies were analysed with field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL, JSM-7500F, Japan). Thermal stability was probed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Netzsch, TGA-STA 449 F5 Jupiter, Germany). Apparent BET surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution were determined by nitrogen physisorption at 77 K (3Flex Physisorption, Micromeritics Instrument Corp., US). The samples were activated at 100 °C under a dynamic vacuum of ∼10−3 mbar (SmartVac Prep, Micromeritics Instrument Corp., US) to ensure the absence of unwanted adsorbates and identical pre-measurement states of all samples. All isotherms are accessible online free of charge as adsorption information files (see the ESI†).36 Functional groups within the resulting materials were characterised by infrared spectroscopy (IR, PerkinElmer, Frontier FT-IR, Universal-ATR, US) and Raman spectroscopy (Raman, Renishaw inVia reflex Raman microscope, 532 nm laser source, UK). The accessible active sites were probed by pyridine-adsorbed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR; Nicolet iS50 Spectrometer). Optical property investigations were carried out using an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer (UV-vis, UV/vis/NIR UV-3600 plus instrument, Shimadzu, Japan). Energy levels and lifetime of the photo-induced charge carriers were provided by ultraviolet photoelectron (UPS, RIKEN KEIKI, AC-2, US) and photoluminescence spectrometers (PL, Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 980, UK). Additionally, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses of the Ti K-edge were performed at Beamline 1.1 W: Multiple X-ray Techniques, Synchrotron Light Research Institute, Thailand. The measurements were conducted at ambient temperature and pressure by simultaneously measuring the samples together with Ti foil as a standard reference for an in-line alignment of the energy shift during the synchrotron-operating time. The obtained data were analysed using ATHENA and ARTEMIS software.
2.4. Photocatalysis
1.25 mL of TEOA, 1.00 mL of Milli-Q water (H2O), and 22.75 mL of CH3CN were homogeneously mixed in a 50 mL round-bottom-flask reactor. Then 10 mg of Ti-based MOF catalyst (Ti-MOF, Ti8Ph-MOF or Ti8Ph-BA-MOF) was added to the mixture. A stopper and paraffin were used to close the flask. The solution was degassed by purging 1 bar of Ar gas into the solution and then in headspace for 30 min in each step. After this, the prepared reactor was irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp (430–740 nm), 10 mW cm−2. The produced H2 was sampled every 30 minutes for 3 hours and quantified by gas chromatography (SRI instrument, SRI 8610C) with a reduction gas detector (RGD) and a combination of 1.83 m of a 5 Å molecular sieve column (inert gases) and 1.83 m of a silica gel column (hydrocarbon) under nitrogen gas.
Apparent quantum yields (AQYs) were determined by means of an SCIENCETECH 300 W Xe lamp fitted with a Cornerstone TM 130 1/8 m monochromator as a monochromatic light source (430 nm (3.25 mW cm−2) and 460 nm (3.15 mW cm−2)), a Newport 818-UV silicon photodiode for power density calibration and a Keithley 6485 picoammeter. The reaction conditions were mimicked from catalysis using a halved volume and amount of the catalyst.
2.5. Computational details
In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the B3LYP functional.37 The 6-31G** basis set was used for C, O and H atoms, whereas LANL2DZ was adopted for Ti atoms.38 During geometry optimization, only four Ti atoms around the defect site (Ti3–Ti8, Fig. S19†) were constrained while the remaining atoms were allowed to fully relax. Subsequently, single-point energy calculations with the larger def2-TZVP basis set39 were then performed on the optimized structures, to achieve more accurate energies. Electronic properties were calculated at the MP2/6-31G**/LANL2DZ(Ti) level of theory which was expected to give more reliable molecular orbital results due to its accuracy. Gaussian 16 revision B.01 was used in all calculations.40
3. Results and discussion
Ti8Ph clusters were first prepared following a modified previously reported procedure.34 Titanium(IV) isopropoxide and benzoic acid (BA) were mixed in CH3CN and then heated at 100 °C for 15 h. Crystalline phase formation and purity of the pre-formed precursors were probed by powder X-ray diffraction and were found to be in line with a prior report (Fig. S2†).34 Synthesis of MIL-125-NH2 was conducted using the Ti8Ph cluster as a Ti precursor and NH2-BDC linker at various temperatures and reaction times and different ratios of mixed solvents, without and with BA as the modulator.
Under optimised conditions, Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF were successfully obtained without and with BA, respectively, at 70 °C and isolated as yellow powders (Fig. S3†). BA was employed as a modulator to influence the kinetics of formation of the framework by deprotonation of organic linkers or competing with linkers to coordinate with metal ions.41,42 The yield after 24 h reached about 72% and raised to 88 and 96% upon increasing the reaction time to 48 and 72 h, respectively. In parallel, a MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 sample (so-called Ti-MOF) was produced with 73% yield following a benchmark procedure using TPOT as the Ti precursor (16 h) to compare with the properties of the designed material.35
The PXRD patterns showed that the products are highly crystalline and are in good agreement with the simulated reference pattern (Fig. 2a). This indicates the formation of an overall pure-phase MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 structure even at 70 °C, representing the lowest synthetic temperature reported for MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 synthesis.27,43 In contrast, attempting MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 synthesis using TPOT as a titanium precursor at 70 °C did not afford a crystalline Ti-MOF phase (Fig. S4†) which was only reached at 150 °C and after 16 h of reaction time. This highlights the advantage of using a controlled secondary building unit approach (CSA) for MOF synthesis at relatively low temperature. Additionally, the characteristic peaks of the Ti8Ph cluster were not detected in the Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF products even after only 24 h of reaction (Fig. S5†). This indicates that the sixteen-carboxylate-coordinating Ti8Ph clusters were cleanly converted to adopt the twelve-carboxylate-coordinating building unit of the MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 structure.
 Fig. 2  (a) PXRD patterns and (b)–(d) FE-SEM images of Ti-MOF, Ti8Ph-MOF, and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF. 
The sample morphology was investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Ti-MOF displayed a truncated octahedron morphology with a particle size of ca. 1.90 ± 0.76 μm in line with prior reports (Fig. 2b).44,45 By contrast, Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF showed different morphologies appearing as circular tablet particles with many holes (Fig. 2c and d) with correspondingly smaller sizes of 0.40 ± 0.04 and 0.30 ± 0.04 μm. The smaller size of the Ti8Ph-BA-MOF may be attributed to the use of BA which speeds up the nucleation point formation rate to produce more nuclei. BA can also block the growth of crystals to decrease the crystal size.45,46 Note that the standard deviation of particle size was calculated from 50 particles in each sample.
N2 adsorption experiments were performed at 77 K to investigate the porosity of the prepared samples (Fig. S6–10†). While Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF showed type I isotherms without hysteresis upon desorption, Ti-MOF presented a type IV isotherm with small hysteresis indicative of a mesoporous structure.47,48 Ti-MOF provides a surface area of 1001.51 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.39 cm3 g−1 (Table S1†), which are comparable with previous reports.48,49 In the case of the Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF samples, pore volumes of 0.56 and 0.50 cm3 g−1 and surface areas of 1483.53 and 1356.76 m2 g−1 were obtained, respectively. These values are significantly larger than those of Ti-MOF suggesting more abundance of defective sites for Ti8Ph-based MOFs. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under an Ar atmosphere from room temperature to 800 °C (Fig. S11†) revealed similar profiles for all samples showing decomposition at about ∼350 °C inferring good thermal stability unaltered by the variations between the porous structures.
Chemical bonding in the structures was analysed by IR and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S12†). The IR bands at around 1537 and 1385 cm−1 could be attributed to asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching of the carboxylate groups (COO−), respectively, in all MOF samples.35,43 In contrast, the characteristic vibration of the carbonyl group (CO) of the free COOH group of the linker at 1675 cm−1 was not observed. The stretching vibration of Ti–O was likely observed at 640 cm−1.43,50,51 In addition, the corresponding Raman spectra present bands at 1259 and 1423 cm−1 ascribed to the bending and symmetric stretching of Ti–O–Ti, respectively.52 These results provide further evidence of successful coordination between the Ti in the cluster and the –COOH groups of NH2-BDC linkers.
The optical properties of the synthesised MOFs were investigated by UV-vis analysis. Solid-state absorption spectra of the MOFs displayed absorption in the UV region and visible part of the solar spectrum up to ∼550 nm in line with the respective absorption of the NH2-BDC ligand and the Ti8Ph-cluster (Fig. 3a). The absorption bands of NH2-BDC at around 260 and 380 nm correspond to π → π* and n → π* electronic transitions, respectively.30,49 In the case of the frameworks, photoexcitation proceeds through ligand-to-metal charge transfer which can be found as a tail in the visible region.17,23,53 The excitation leads to an electron transfer from the linker to the metal cluster, which consequently reduces Ti4+ to Ti3+ yielding electrons localised in the metal clusters and holes on the linkers.24 Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF present slightly red-shifted onset absorption compared with Ti-MOF suggesting a narrower energy “band” gap. This was confirmed by Tauc plot analysis by extrapolating the linear fit for the plotted experimental data of (αhυ)2vs. (hυ) and affording energy gaps of 2.81, 2.63, and 2.61 eV for Ti-MOF, Ti8Ph-MOF, and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF, respectively (Fig. 3b).7,26,54
 Fig. 3  (a) Solid-state UV-vis spectrum and (b) Tauc plot for energy gap determination of Ti-MOF, Ti8Ph-MOF, and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF. 
Valence band maximum (VBM) energy levels of the samples were estimated by UV-photo electron spectroscopy (Fig. S13) while the conduction band minimum (CBM) was calculated upon addition of the energy gaps (Table S2†). Comparable VBM energies of ∼5.80 eV were obtained resulting in CBM energies of 2.99, 3.16, and 3.18 eV for Ti-MOF, Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF, respectively. With the VBM and CBM being typically located on the NH2-BDC linkers and Ti clusters, respectively, the differing CBM levels suggest key differences between the MOFs constructed from TPOT (Ti-MOF) and from Ti8Ph clusters (Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF).55 With the similar PXRD patterns recorded for these three MOFs inferring similar unit cell parameters and space groups, variation in CBM levels may be ascribed to differences in the local coordination geometry of the Ti centres in line with previous reports on defect-rich MOFs decreasing.21,56
The photocatalytic activity of Ti-MOF, Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated by placing 10 mgMOF in a solvent mixture of H2O and CH3CN, using TEOA as an electron donor at 1 bar of Ar and room temperature under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation for 3 h. Since the energy gaps of all prepared materials are in the visible region, the frameworks are expected to act as both photosensitisers and catalysts. The proposed reaction path includes light absorption and Ti cluster reduction followed by proton reduction to dihydrogen (Fig. S14†). In parallel, the sacrificial agent (TEOA) in solution permits the fast extraction of photogenerated holes.
The accumulated amount of evolved H2 was monitored by GC analysis and was found to be 2.5 to 3.5 times higher for Ti8Ph-based MOFs than for Ti-MOF with Ti8Ph-BA-MOF, Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti-MOF producing 143.77, 102.08 and 41.10 μmol gMOF−1 h−1 of H2, respectively (Fig. 4a and entry 1–3 in Table 1). Note that the 30 min-activation period observed for all catalysts may be ascribed to a slow two-electron accumulation process in H2 evolution.55,57 Control experiments carried out without a catalyst, electron sacrificial agents or light irradiation revealed no significant evidence of H2 production (Table 1, entry 4–6), supporting the anticipated electron cascade (Fig. S14†). The evolution rate obtained for Ti8Ph-based MOFs prepared with BA in water reduction under visible light compares favourably with the values reported for other precious metal-free MOFs such as MIL-100(Fe), Co-ZIF-67 and defective UiO-66(Zr)–NH2 by one order of magnitude (Table S3†).23,58,59,

The apparent quantum yield of Ti8Ph-BA-MOF under HER conditions reached 6.24 ± 0.32% and 2.44 ± 0.07% at 430 nm (3.25 mW cm−2) and 460 nm (3.15 mW cm−2), respectively. The higher conversion efficiency at shorter wavelengths is in line with a stronger light absorption ability (Fig. 3a). In addition, the values compare well with that in a previous report on MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 (i.e., 3.6% at 420 nm) supporting the beneficial impact of the defect-bearing structure.60
After 3 h, the Ti8Ph-BA-MOF catalyst was recovered, and its reusability was tested in a fresh catalytic medium. The results showed no obvious loss in activity (Fig. S15a†) even after additional consecutive runs. Note that an initiation period was also observed in the recycling runs suggesting that the photocatalyst structure is not converted during this period. In addition, the PXRD pattern of the recovered Ti8Ph-BA-MOF (Fig. S15b†) was found to be similar to that of the fresh catalyst, highlighting its structural durability upon the photocatalytic reaction.
To investigate the differing photocatalytic reactivities of Ti8Ph-based MOFs and Ti-MOF, photoluminescence spectroscopy was next employed towards exploring the charge carrier recombination, migration, and transfer in the materials. Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) was employed using a laser excitation wavelength of 370 nm. Upon photoexcitation, the samples exhibited a broad emission band with a peak at 425 nm ascribed to the excited electron returning to the ground state (Fig. S16†). Time-resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) was used to investigate the lifetimes (τ) of photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 4b). Similar decay profiles were observed for Ti-MOF, Ti8Ph-MOF, and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF with fitting of the decay profile enabling charge-separated state lifetime determination of 5.54, 6.10, and 7.66 ns for Ti-MOF, Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF, respectively. Such a difference likely originates from synthesis-related structural variations on the Ti-oxo-carboxylate clusters. The effect of the modulator in Ti8Ph-BA-MOF is in line with previous reports, potentially promoting defects in the MOF structure by decreasing the energy of the unoccupied orbitals of the cluster and promoting charge separation and transfer.22 Nevertheless, the lifetimes remain in the same order of magnitude and are unlikely to explain the catalytic activity variations.
While higher light harvesting abilities can support the superior catalytic performances of Ti8Ph-BA-MOF and Ti8Ph-MOF compared to Ti-MOF, differences in the local coordination nature of Ti-clusters in the frameworks may also account as a determining factor. The oxidation state and local structure were thus probed by X-ray absorption near edge structure and X-ray absorption fine structure analyses of Ti K-edge absorption, respectively (Fig. 5). The XANES results showed similar oxidation states of Ti in all samples (specifically, +4) from the same position of the main absorption edge at 4981.03 eV (Fig. 5a). A closer inspection of the XANES fingerprinting spectra indicates small variations around 4985–5015 eV between Ti8Ph-based MOFs and the pristine Ti-MOF, hinting at deviations in the local structure of the Ti centres of the two systems.

The local structures were further examined using Ti K-edge EXAFS spectra showing the Fourier transform of the radial function for the Ti8Ph cluster and Ti-MOF shown in Fig. 5b. Here, the identified positions of interest were found relevant to the nominal path length (Reff) of scattering paths from the centred Ti atom, which were generated from the cif files of MIL-125-NH2 (Ti-MOF) and the Ti8Ph cluster in ARTEMIS software. In the case of the Ti8Ph cluster, the 1st, 2nd, and 4th radial distributions were ascribed to Ti1–O environments with the O coming from μ2-O at the 1st shell (O1), the carboxylate group of linkers at the 1st shell (O2), and the 3rd shell (O3), respectively (Fig. S17a†). The 3rd radial distribution was attributed to Ti1–Ti at the 2nd shell (Ti2) of scattering pathways from the Ti centre. For Ti-MOF, the 1st and 2nd radial distributions were ascribed to Ti1–O environments with the O coming from μ2-O and μ2-OH at the 1st shell (O1) and the carboxylate group of linkers at the 1st shell (O2) (Fig. S17b†).68 The 4th radial distribution is attributed to Ti1–O of the linker carboxylate group at the 3rd shell (O3) whereas the 3rd and 5th radial distributions are ascribed to Ti1–Tix environments with the Ti coming from the 2nd shell (Ti2 and Ti3) (Fig. S17b†).68
Probing the Ti centers in Ti-MOF and Ti8Ph-based MOFs revealed similar multiple scattering pathways (Fig. 5b). As the Ti8Ph cluster structure holds sixteen carboxylate ligands surrounding the Ti octahedra and eight Ti-oxo octahedra connected via corner-sharing (μ2-O), a rearrangement and removal of four extra linkers must occur to fit into the twelve-linker bearing MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 framework (Fig. S1† and 6a). This is reflected in the shift of the 3rd radial distribution (Ti1–Ti2) towards shorter distances in the case of Ti8Ph-based MOFs with respect to the corresponding Ti8Ph cluster. This behaviour is in line with the expected reduction of the original cluster's size from ∼13 to ∼10 Å upon conversion into the MOF (Fig. S1 and S17†). In addition, the Ti1–Ti2 distances of Ti8Ph-based MOFs are similar to those of Ti-MOF, which indicates a similar periodic structural framework according to XRD patterns.61–63 Thus, the rearrangement of the Ti8Ph cluster leads to a MOF-Ti-oxo-carboxylate cluster which likely solely differs from the Ti-MOF ones in their type of oxygen on the octahedral Ti (i.e., only μ2-O vs. a mixture of μ2-O and μ2-OH) and the degree of coordination of the clusters (i.e., their respective averaged number of linkers).
Considering the ideal structure of MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2, Ti ions in octahedral geometry are fully coordinated with six oxygen atoms suggesting that catalysis may only occur at defects in the MOF structure which render Ti Lewis acidic sites accessible.64,65 Together, the higher photocatalytic activity of Ti8Ph-based MOFs than Ti-MOF and the expected rearrangement suggest that a higher concentration of accessible sites for binding with reactants can be achieved by using a pre-designed Ti8Ph cluster as a Ti metal source. To further investigate the active site concentration in our materials (pore window size ≈ 6 Å and pore sizes of 6 and 12 Å) the samples were investigated by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and pyridine (kinetic diameter = 5.33 Å) was chosen as an in situ titrant for its Lewis basicity.24 First, the samples were activated post-synthesis to remove coordinated species leaving Ti accessible.27 Here, MOF samples were placed in an IR cell and pyridine vapour was then purged through the cell and the pyridine-loading was monitored via IR until it reached saturation (about 60 min). A desorption step was next performed by purging argon for 90 min for removing the physisorbed pyridine before recording another IR spectrum. The IR spectra of the activated and desorbed-pyridine samples were subtracted to afford the traces shown in Fig. 6b.

The corresponding Ti8Ph-MOF and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF spectra show bands at 1626 and 1454 cm−1 ascribed to CCN stretching vibrations of pyridines attached to Ti4+ Lewis acid sites (L-Py).66,67 In addition, the bands at 1580 and 1560 cm−1 are in line with the CCN vibrations of protonated pyridine at Ti–OH (Hb-Py) and μ2-O-H (B-Py) sites highlighting interactions between the framework and pyridines.66 By contrast, these characteristic bands were not strongly observed in Ti-MOF. This suggests that Ti8Ph-based MOFs offer numerous defective Ti sites that can be functionalised by pyridines via displacing or coordinating the charge-compensating –OH (and/or –OH2) ligands from the linker-missing Ti centres (Fig. 6a).67 The relative ratio between Lewis acid sites at 1454 cm−1 and μ2-OH sites at 1560 cm−1 in Ti8Ph-BA-MOF is slightly higher than that in Ti8Ph-MOF (see the inset) potentially suggesting more contribution from –OH than μ2-OH. This may hint at a higher absolute amount of accessible active sites in Ti8Ph-BA-MOF than in Ti8Ph-MOF. These results support that employing Ti8Ph clusters for MOF synthesis creates high concentrations of accessible docking sites which in turn may improve the photocatalytic rate as reaction sites can be created from the de-coordination of –OH and/or –OH2. Post-catalysis DRIFTS experiments revealed unchanged matching features suggesting that no strong alteration of the defect occurred during photocatalysis (Fig. S18†).
DFT calculations were performed to investigate the HER mechanism considering the defect site in the (Ti8O8(OH)4(COOH)11(H2O)1(OH)1) cluster model of MIL-125(Ti)-NH2 as the catalytic site (Fig. S19 and S20†). Upon receiving an electron, the cluster is stabilised with an energy of 2.1 eV. Subsequently, an open catalytic site can be formed by the removal of a non-structural linker H2O or OH− with the former being thermodynamically favoured. This indicates that the H2O-bound Ti sites may serve as the catalytic sites for the process of the HER. Ti–H formation (through the acceptance of an electron and proton) is likely the rate-limiting step because of its high energy barrier (2.7 eV), in line with prior work.64
The electronic properties of the intermediate species along the HER pathway were calculated at the MP2/6-31G**/LANL2DZ level of theory to gain more insights into the oxidation state of Ti open metal sites. Following water departure, the HOMO of intermediate 3 is located on the free Ti centre as reflected in the charge and spin density (Table S4 and S5†). These results signifies a lowered oxidation state likely from Ti(IV) to a reduced Ti(III). A similar result is observed for Ti(OH) albeit the –OH− removal pathway (intermediate III) is thermodynamically unlikely. As expected, the charge of Ti open metal sites remained unchanged upon Ti–H formation (intermediate 4, 1.94 e) from Ti–□ (intermediate 3; 1.90 e).
According to the optical properties, the photocatalytic investigations and the computational results, as well as prior reports, the HER mechanism of Ti8Ph-BA-MOF can be proposed (Fig. 7).55,64,69,70 Upon light absorption, an electron is transferred from the linkers to TiIV–OH2 on Ti clusters while a hole is regenerated upon reaction with TEOA. A vacant TiIII site is then generated, likely from water dissociation. TiIII–H is then formed upon accepting another photoexcited electron and a proton from the media. Dihydrogen is finally produced after a reaction with another proton and TiIV–OH2 is recovered.

4. Conclusions
Employing a titanium-oxo-carboxylate cluster precursor was demonstrated to be a successful strategy to generate defect-rich MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 while lowering the temperature of synthesis. Photocatalytic production of H2 was achieved with TEOA as a sacrificial agent under visible light irradiation permitting a 3.5 times enhancement in the H2 evolution rate under optimised conditions compared to traditionally-prepared MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2. The improved performance was not only caused by tailored optoelectronic properties (higher light absorption), but also by an increase in the absolute amount of accessible reaction sites. This was shown by Py-FTIR, XANES, and EXAFS spectral fingerprint analyses and further showcased that the Ti precursor conditions the local Ti node coordination environment in the resulting MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2. The linker-depleted Ti sites were charge compensated by –OH and –OH2 groups while maintaining a MIL-125-(Ti)-NH2 topology. Notably, the characteristic of the μ2-O bridges in the Ti8Ph cluster was retained so that the local coordination of Ti-clusters in those samples could be differentiated. This study provides insight into the Ti-MOF, Ti8Ph-MOF, and Ti8Ph-BA-MOF and highlights the role of the local structure and electronic properties for improving photocatalytic H2 production. Overall, this work underscores the feasibility of preparing effective photocatalytic MOF materials without further functionalisation and with low-cost consumption. The concept further provides perspective towards readily made efficient photocatalytic MOFs since it may be transferable to other discrete, pre-designed clusters as MOF precursors.
