    , Accepted 9th November 2021First published on 9th November 2021AbstractPiezoelectric and thermoelectric materials that can directly convert mechanical and thermal energies into electricity have attracted great interest because of their practical applications in overcoming the challenges of the energy crisis. In this research, a new family of two-dimensional (2D) group-VI Janus ternary compounds with α and γ phases are predicted. After the stability testing, only the α-TeSSe monolayer has dynamic and thermal stability. The band structure and the optic, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric performances of the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer are calculated via first-principles calculations. Janus α-TeSSe is a narrow indirect bandgap semiconductor with a value of 0.953 eV at the HSE06 functional considering the spin–orbit coupling (SOC), which is beneficial to its thermoelectric performance, and its excellent absorption coefficients indicate that it may be a promising optoelectronic material. The piezoelectric calculations show that Janus α-TeSSe exhibits not only appreciable in-plane piezoelectricity (d11 = 17.17 pm V−1) but also superior vertical piezoelectricity (d31 = 0.22 pm V−1). Furthermore, a new TransOpt code is used to calculate the electrical transport coefficients with a constant electron–phonon coupling approximation, which is more accurate than the constant relaxation time approximation. The origin of ultralow lattice thermal conductivity is also discussed in detail. Finally, ultrahigh ZT values of 0.77 and 1.95 occur in n-type and p-type doping at 600 K, respectively, indicating that it is a promising thermoelectric material. Our work demonstrates that Janus α-TeSSe monolayers have potential applications in optoelectronic, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric devices, which will greatly stimulate research-related experiments.
1. Introduction
Thermoelectric materials1,2 that can directly convert waste heat into electrical energy and piezoelectric materials3–6 that can directly convert mechanical energy into electrical energy have attracted great interest, due to the possibility of overcoming the challenges of global warming and the energy crisis. Thus, it is of great significance to design and find excellent thermoelectric and piezoelectric materials. The Janus structure, which has a particular structure with inversion asymmetry and is different from traditional 2D materials, has attracted great attention because of its novel properties and potential application in electronics, optoelectronics, piezoelectrics, and thermoelectrics.3,5,7–10 In recent years, typical Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)5,8,11–16 have been widely studied after the Janus MoSSe monolayer was first successfully synthesized from MoS2 through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by Li et al. in 2017.10 Compared to MoS2, Janus TMD monolayers lack reflection symmetry for the central metal atoms, resulting in out-of-plane electric polarization. Thus, modifying the conventional 2D materials with intrinsic centrosymmetry to form Janus structures is an effective way to generate piezoelectric properties.17
It is well-known that the properties of materials strongly depend on their crystal structure. Typical 2H (γ) and 1T (α) phases are usually present in 2D graphene-like hexagonal structures.9,15,18,19 In general, the 2H-phase is more stable than the 1T-phase in group-VIB (Cr, Mo, W, Fe) TMDs/TMOs.18,19 However, the 1T-phase hexagonal structure is more stable than the 2H-phase hexagonal structure in group-VI 2D selenium and tellurium.20–22 A new family of 2D materials, group-VI elemental 2D materials, has emerged in recent years. These materials have superior properties such as high carrier mobility, high photoconductivity, and thermoelectric responses.23 Zhu et al.22 and Chen et al.24 predicted and successfully synthesized tellurene on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrates by using molecular beam epitaxy in 2017. Subsequently, based on liquid-phase exfoliation, Xie et al.25 also synthesized 2D tellurene nanosheets, which had superior electronic transport properties26 and could be used in high-performance field-effect transistors.27 Moreover, previous reports20,28 indicated that tellurene and selenene had extraordinary thermoelectric performances due to their ultralow lattice thermal conductivity kl.20,28,29 Recent studies have suggested that the compounds composed of Te and Se have excellent thermoelectric and electronic transport properties.30,31 However, no theoretical and experimental investigations focused on the piezoelectric and thermoelectric properties of 2D group-VI Janus ternary compounds have been reported to date.
Unlike traditional Janus TMDs, the central atom of the group-VI Janus ternary compounds is not a transition metal. Furthermore, tellurene20,28,29 and selenene20,28 have the lowest recorded kl among the family of 2D materials to date. Therefore, we assume that the group-VI Janus ternary compounds consisting of tellurium and selenium may possess excellent piezoelectric and thermoelectric performances. Motivated by unique Janus structures consisting of group-VI elements and potential applications in piezoelectric and thermoelectric performance devices, we systematically studied the family of group-VI Janus ternary compounds. The results of this study show that the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer has excellent optic, piezoelectric and thermoelectric properties, which will have promising applications in nanoelectronics, piezoelectrics, and thermoelectrics. The rest of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the computational methods and details. Section 3 presents the results and discussions, including the stability, electronic properties, piezoelectricity, electron transport properties, phonon transport properties, and thermoelectricity. Conclusions are drawn in Section 4.
2. Theoretical methods and computational details
In this work, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.32,33 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formulation34 for the exchange–correlation potential is employed. A plane wave cut-off of 500 eV is used. Dense 14 × 14 × 1 and 24 × 24 × 1 k-meshes are used to sample the Brillouin zone for structure optimizations and electronic property calculations, respectively. To avoid interactions between the layers, a larger than 15 Å vacuum space is set. The structures are completely relaxed until the convergence thresholds for electronic and ionic relaxations reach 10−8 eV and 10−3 eV Å−1, respectively. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) are performed at 300 K for 5 ps with a time step of 1 fs.
The relaxed ion elastic, piezoelectric stress, and piezoelectric strain tensors obtained as the sum of the ionic and electronic contributions are defined as6 (1) (2) (3)where σij, εjk, and Pi are the stress tensor, strain tensor, and polarization tensor, respectively. The subscripts i = 1, 2, and 3 for the polarization Pi represent the x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively. Using Voigt notation, Cijkl, eijk and dijk are reduced to two-rank Cij, eij, and dij, respectively. The finite-difference method6,35,36 and the density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT)6,37–39 are used to compute the elastic stiffness coefficients Cij and piezoelectric stress coefficient eij, respectively. Because of the 3D periodic boundary conditions, the 2D elastic stiffness coefficients and piezoelectric stress coefficients must be renormalized by the z lattice parameter corresponding to the spacing between 2D layers: C2Dij = zC3Dij and e2Dij = ze2Dij.6,40,41 Thus, the piezoelectric strain coefficients dij can be derived from the relationship:6eij = dikCkj, which is important for piezoelectric applications.
In the electronic transport calculations, a new TransOpt code,42 which can effectively avoid band crossing problems and is more accurate than the constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA), is used to calculate the electrical transport coefficients. TransOpt adopts the Boltzmann transport theory in the relaxation time approach with a constant electron–phonon coupling approximation (CEPCA). The Seebeck coefficient S and electrical conductivity σ are defined as43–46 (4) (5)where fμ(T,ε), kB, e, and ε are the Fermi–Dirac distribution function, Boltzmann constant, electric charge, and band energy, respectively. It is vital to evaluate the transport distribution Ξ(ε), which is derived as  where vk and τk are the group velocity and the relaxation time at state k, respectively. τk, which depends on the scattering mechanisms including phonon, impurity, and defect scatterings, is a vital parameter for accurately calculating σ with the CRTA. If only the intrinsic electron–phonon scatterings are considered, the relaxation time can be expressed as42,47,48 (6)where  is the electron–phonon coupling matrix (EPCM), δ(εmk, −εnk − ωqλ) and δ(εmk, −εnk + ωqλ) are the absorption and the emission of a phonon ωqλ, respectively, and nqλ denotes the phonon number for the Bose–Einstein distribution.
To obtain the phonon transport properties, the second-order harmonic interatomic force constants (IFCs) are obtained using the VASP code32,33 based on the DFPT with a 5 × 5 × 1 supercell and a 3 × 3 × 1 k-mesh. The Phonopy code49 is used to calculate the phonon frequencies. The third-order IFCs are calculated by using a finite displacement approach49,50 with a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell, considering the third nearest neighbors. The lattice thermal conductivity is obtained using the ShengBTE code51 with the iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. After the lattice thermal conductivity convergence test, q-meshes of 55 × 55 × 1 and scalebroad of 0.7 are used.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Stability and electronic properties
Typical 2D graphene-like hexagonal structures mainly contain two phases, 2H (γ) and 1T (α).9,15,18,19 In this paper, we focus on the group-VI ternary Janus structure with those two phases belonging to the P3m1 (No. 156) space group, in which the centrosymmetric structure is broken because the two sides are atoms of different elements. Six Janus monolayers can be obtained according to the type of atoms at the central location, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Fig. 1. We first evaluate the stability of all these Janus structures with γ-phase and α-phase using phonon dispersion, as shown in Fig. S2 and S3(a) (ESI†). The calculated results imply that only Janus α-TeSSe is dynamically stable due to the absence of an imaginary frequency.52 Thus, only Janus α-TeSSe is taken into account in the rest of this work.
As shown in Fig. 1, Janus α-TeSSe possesses a 1T-MoS2-like structure and belongs to C3v point group symmetry. For the α-TeSSe monolayer, a central Te atom is located at the Mo site, while an S and a Se atom in the lower or upper layer are located at the S sites. The optimized lattice parameters are a = b = 3.905 Å and the out-of-plane thickness is 3.195 Å. Considering the van der Waals (vdW) radius of elements the effective thickness is 6.895 Å.29

To further study whether the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer is stable, the formation energy (Ef) of the α-TeSSe monolayer is calculated by using the formula:53,54 where ETeSSe denotes the total energy of the pure monolayer, ETe, ES, and ESe represent the energies of isolated Te, S, and Se atoms, respectively, and n is the number of atoms per unit cell. The Ef of the α-TeSSe monolayer is negative with the value of −0.214 eV per atom, which implies that it has thermodynamic stability. We then estimate the thermal stability of the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer by the AIMD simulations. Fig. S3(b) (ESI†) shows that no broken bond or structural reconfiguration emerges, and the total-energy fluctuation is small during the 5 ps AIMD simulation at 300 K, illustrating the good thermal stability of the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer at room temperature.

Fig. 2(a) represents the band structure of the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer for different functionals, such as PBE, PBE + SOC, HSE06, and HSE06 + SOC. It is revealed that the PBE calculations underestimate the bandgap by about 0.5 eV compared with HSE06, which is common in other reports.8,55,56 As a common rule, the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) that splits the energy level plays a vital role in the electronic band structure when heavy atoms are present in the materials. Thus, to obtain an accurate calculation for the electronic band structures, the effect of the SOC is taken into account in our calculations based on PBE and HSE06 functionals. It is conspicuous that the inclusion of the SOC removes the spin degeneracy, and the conduction band maximum (CBM) experiences obvious band splitting. The bandgaps of Janus TeSSe are 0.476 eV and 0.953 eV based on the PBE + SOC and HSE06 + SOC levels, respectively, and this feature of the narrow bandgap of semiconductors benefits the thermoelectric performance.57,58 Since the calculated result based on the scheme of the HSE06 + SOC functional is closer to the experimental value, the following calculations of the related properties adopt this method. From Fig. 2(b), it is notable that the total density of states (DOS) near the valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly contributed by S and Se atoms, while the DOS near the CBM is mainly contributed by Te and Se atoms, suggesting that relatively light atoms dominate the DOS near the VBM while relatively heavy atoms dominate the DOS near the CBM. This phenomenon has also occurred in previous calculations.59

(d) The ELF profile from Te to the nearest neighbor S (blue line) atom and Se (red line) atom as indicated by the red line in (c). The rectangular dashed frame is the center area of two atoms. 
To gain further insights into the bonding characteristics, we calculated the electron localization function (ELF)60 and Bader charge.61,62 It is well known that the ELF can be used to determine the interaction type between two atoms, such as the chemical bonding type (covalent bonds, metallic bonds) and the physical binding type (ionic binding, vdW binding), by measuring the electron localization in the atomic and molecular systems.60,63 Generally, the ELF represents the probability density of finding another electron near the reference electron with the same spin, and the ELF can be expressed as63,64 (7)where χ(r) corresponds to the formula  which is the electron localization D(r) over the uniform electron gas Dh(r), in which D(r) and Dh(r) are defined as (8) (9)where the electron localization density, the von-Weisäcker term, is represented as the difference between the kinetic energy density and the bosonic kinetic energy density, ψi(r) is the ith Kohn–Sham orbital in an N-electron system, and p(r) is the electron charge density:.
The ELF is powerful in interpreting chemical bonding patterns, and it takes values between 0 and 1,65 where 1 corresponds to perfect localization, 0.5 indicates electron-gas-like pair probability, and 0 represents the absence of electrons. From Fig. 2(c and d), it is found that the electron is located at the locations of the atoms, the values of ELF between Te and S (Se) are larger than 0.5, indicating the covalent bond nature of Te–S and Ti–Se, and the electrons are localized. Furthermore, combined with our previous work,30 it is found that the ELF is positively correlated with Young's modulus as shown in Table 1, in good agreement with the previous report,66 resulting in the 1T-SeTe2 exhibiting the softest nature and α-TeSSe exhibiting the hardest nature. On the other hand, the Bader charge analysis shows that every Te atom loses 1 e and transfers 0.59 e and 0.41 e to its surrounding S and Se atoms, respectively. Furthermore, the charge density difference and the planar averaged charge density difference along the z-direction, as plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†), are calculated. This calculation implies that the charge transfer from the Te atoms to the S and Se atoms is in agreement with the Bader analysis. Combined with the ELF, Bader analysis, and charge density difference, it can be deduced that Janus α-TeSSe is a typical covalent crystal.

To gain further insights into the band character, the atom-projected and orbital-projected band structures with the SOC effect based on the HSE06 functional for the independent element are plotted, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It is found from the atom-projected band structures (see Fig. S5(a–c), ESI†) that the VBM is contributed by S and Se atoms, while the CBM is contributed by Te atoms. This is consistent with the physical mechanism reflected by the DOS as plotted in Fig. 2(b). Furthermore, from the orbital-projected band structures, as plotted in Fig. S5(d–f) (ESI†), one can observe that the VBM presents a predominant weight of the in-plane px + py orbitals of the S and Se atoms from the orbital character distributions, and the S atoms contribute more than the Se atoms. However, the CBM shows the strong weight of the out-of-plane pz orbitals of the Te atoms.
3.2 Optical property
The optical properties are the basis of many important applications of semiconductors, such as optoelectronics and nanoelectronics. In particular, it is essential to explore the optical absorption property in the region of visible light (VL), because about 43% of the solar energy is from VL.68Fig. 3 shows the optical absorption coefficients of Janus α-TeSSe as a function of energy, and three energy ranges are separated by vertical lines, namely, the infra-red (IR), visible light (VL), and ultraviolet (UV) regions according to the photon energy. Notably, the in-plane optical absorption coefficient is isotropic since the optical absorption coefficient along the x and y direction is equal. In the VL region, the in-plane optical absorption coefficient is larger than the out-of-plane absorption coefficient, while the opposite situation occurs in the UV region. In addition, α-TeSSe exhibits outstanding absorption coefficients (ranging from 3.3 × 105 cm−1 to 7.0 × 105 cm−1) in a broad range of VL frequencies, and these coefficients are superior to those of halide perovskites,69 Janus 1T-SnSSe,40 and Janus 1T-MoSeTe15 and 2H-MXY (M = Mo, W; X or Y = S, Se, Te; X ≠ Y),13 indicating that α-TeSSe is promising for optoelectronics.

The black and dashed blue lines represent the absorption coefficients for the in-plane polarization of light in the x and y directions, respectively. The red line represents the absorption coefficients corresponding to the out-of-plane polarization. 
3.3 Piezoelectricity
It is essential to calculate the elastic stiffness coefficients before evaluating the piezoelectricity. The relaxed-ion elastic stiffness coefficients are calculated by the finite-difference method,6,35,36 as summarized in Table 1. The elastic stiffness coefficients fully satisfy the mechanic stability criteria,70C11 > 0 and C11 > |C12|, confirming that the α-TeSSe monolayer is mechanically stable.
Physically, piezoelectric materials can generate an electrical potential when subjected to applied mechanical stress.71 In general, piezoelectric materials that can generate or polarize an electric charge under mechanical strain have two essential features: the piezoelectric material must have non-centrosymmetric crystals,6 and the piezoelectric material must be an insulator or a semiconductor with a wide enough bandgap to avoid current leakage.72,73 The broken inversion symmetry (C3v point group) endows the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer with potential piezoelectricity. Then we estimate the piezoelectricity of the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer by calculating the piezoelectric coefficients directly. For 2D systems with C3v point-group symmetry, both piezoelectric coefficients e11/d11 and e31/d31 are independent and nonzero, and the expressions for the independent Cij, eij, and dij coefficients for this point group are derived as5,6 (10)where the independent elastic constants and the piezoelectric coefficients simplify as C11, C12, and e11, e31, respectively. Hence, d11 and d31 are derived as follows: (11) (12)
Along with the above calculated Cij and eij, the value of dij is evaluated according to eqn (11) and (12), as summarized in Table 2.
Table 2 The piezoelectric coefficients e11, e31, d11, and d31 are shown in the relaxed-ion situation. The values of e11 and e31 are expressed in units of pC m−1, and d11 and d31 are expressed in units of pm V−1

Generally, the relaxed-ion coefficients are more reliable because they are experimentally relevant.4,75 It is noticeable that the in-plane piezoelectric coefficients e11 (628.98 pC m−1) and d11 (17.17 pm V−1) are superior to those of most reported Janus monolayers, such as Te2Se,74 SnSSe,40 In2SSe,16 and MXY (M = Mo or W, X/Y = S, Se, or Te, and X ≠ Y),5 indicating that the Janus α-TeSSe is suitable for piezoelectric applications. Furthermore, it is gratifying that α-TeSSe also possesses larger out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients e31 (13.74 pC m−1) and d31 (0.22 pm V−1) than those of the above reports.5,16,40 The coexistence of such large in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric responses can remarkably improve the compatibility and flexibility of piezoelectric devices, in which the functional layers need to be vertically stacked.76
3.4 Thermoelectric properties

3.4.1 Electronic transport properties. 
In this work, we use the TransOpt code42 to calculate the transport properties, such as the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, electronic thermal conductivity, Lorenz number, power factor, and electronic fitness function. Considerable examples42,77–80 have confirmed that TransOpt is reasonable to use in the calculation of the transport properties and that it can be beneficial for high-throughput calculations. The carrier mobility μ limited by carrier scatterings in the semiconductor represents a relative measurement of the operating speed of an electronic device. Thus, a theoretical investigation of carrier mobility is essential in materials. The mobilities μ at the doped concentration as a function of the temperature have been calculated according to the formulas:77 where σ is the electrical conductivity, and n and p are the electron and hole doped concentrations, respectively. Thus, the electron and hole mobility at the best-doped concentration can be easily determined by combining with the previously calculated electrical conductivity σ, as summarized in Table 3. Furthermore, the mobilities μ at the best-doped concentration (0.596 × 1020 cm3 for electron and 0.591 × 1020 cm3 for hole) of 300 K as a function of the temperature are also calculated, as depicted in Fig. 4. The figure shows that the temperature dependent mobilities of the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer can be described by the exponential decay functions of T−2.03 and T−1.23 for electron and hole, respectively, as is common in other reported materials.77,81 Such relationships between the mobilities and the temperature are comparable to the relationship of T−3/2, due to the dominant lattice scattering mechanism.82,83 Moreover, the electron mobility is superior to the hole mobility because the n-type electrical conductivity is larger than the p-type electrical conductivity at the best-doped concentration at 300 K (see Fig. S6(c and d), ESI†).

The Electronic Fitness function (EFF), typically represented by the symbol t, can be used to measure the extent to which a general complex band structure decouples σ and S. Usually, the EFF is expressed as:42,84t = (σ/τ)S2/N2/3, where σ/τ and S are the conductivity over relaxation time and the Seebeck coefficient, respectively. The volumetric density of states N,  is proportional to the density of states’ effective mass and the Fermi energy. Good thermoelectric materials usually possess complex electronic structures with a high t function. In this work, the t function of the Janus monolayer is calculated using the TransOpt code,42 as shown in Fig. 5, which is a reasonable method for evaluating the t function compared to the BoltzTraP.

Fig. 6 shows the thermoelectric power factor PF and the electronic thermal conductivity ke of the n-type and p-type doped Janus α-TeSSe monolayer as a function of the carrier concentration at different temperatures, ranging from 300 K to 600 K. The power factor represents the electric productivity of thermoelectric materials defined as PF = S2σ, where S and σ are the Seebeck coefficient and the electronic conductivity, respectively, as summarized in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Thus, the larger power factor also induces a higher conversion efficiency from heat energy to electric energy. Notably, the PF of the α-TeSSe monolayer is larger than that of 1T-SiTe2 and SnTe2,85 SnSSe,40 In2SeO and In2SeO,56 suggesting that the α-TeSSe monolayer may be a good thermoelectric material.

For both the n-type and p-type doped cases, the PF decreases obviously with the increasing temperatures. ke is positively related to the temperature for the n-type doped case, while it has the opposite characteristics for the p-type case. Combined with the figure of merit ZT analysis, we focus on the PF and ke at the doped concentration ranging from 1 × 10−19 to 1 × 10−20 cm−3. By comparison, it is found that the PF for n-type doping is smaller than for p-type doping, and the ke has the same pattern. As shown in Fig. 6(c and d), the values of ke are in the ranges of 0.4–0.5 (W m−1 K−1) and 0.001–0.15 (W m−1 K−1) for the p-type and n-type at the best-doped concentration at temperatures of T = 300, 400, and 600 K, indicating that the α-TeSSe monolayer exhibits ultralow electronic thermal conductivity ke.


3.4.2 Phononic transport property. 
From Fig. 7(a), it is observed that the kl behavior agrees well with the T−1 behavior, indicating a dominant Umklapp process of phonon scattering that causes thermal resistivity,29,86 which is common in other 2D systems that include heavy elements.29 In addition, the α-TeSSe monolayer possesses ultralow lattice thermal conductivity kl = 1.69 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K, which is superior to most typically reported 2D materials, such as 1T-phase monolayers, as listed in Table 4, providing further indication that it may be a promising thermoelectric material. The phonon mode contributions toward the total lattice thermal conductivity kl at room temperature from the acoustic phonon branches (ZA, TA, and LA) and the optical branches (OP) are shown in Fig. 7(b). It can be noticed that the lattice thermal conductivity is mainly dominated by acoustic branches accounting for about 80.3% of the total, and the corresponding contribution follows the sequence of TA (41.16%) > LA (25.53%) > ZA (13.62%). Additionally, the total contribution rate of the optic phonon branches reaches up to 19.70%. Such high percentage results from the fact that there is a tiny gap between the ZO modes and LO/TO modes, leading to their strong coupling and a remarkable scattering channel.

To gain further insight into the origin of the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer, the phonon group velocity, Grüneisen parameter, and phonon scattering rate are calculated using the ShengBTE package.51 As shown in Fig. 8(a), it can be seen that the TeSSe monolayer exhibits a smaller average phonon group velocity (0.84 km s−1) than those of PbSSe (1.81 km s−1), PdSTe (1.61 km s−1), and PdSeTe (1.34 km s−1).90 As is generally known, kl is proportional to v2 based on the following formula:  where Cλq is the mode-specific heat capacity, vλq is the phonon velocity, and τ is the relaxation time. This small phonon group velocity of the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer may lead to a relatively low kl. Furthermore, compared with our previous work,30 we find that the order of the average phonon group velocity is Se2Te > TeSSe > SeTe2, due to the larger phonon group velocity for the lighter element mass.
 Fig. 8  The (a) phonon group velocity, (b) Grüneisen parameter, and (c) phonon scattering rates of Janus α-TeSSe monolayer at room temperature. The phonon modes are represented in different colors. 
A useful measure of anharmonicity is given by the Grüneisen parameter γ,91 where a0 is the equilibrium lattice constant, i is the phonon branch index, and q is the wave vector. We calculate γ for all acoustic and optical modes of the TeSSe monolayer, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Since a large γ implies a large anharmonicity that can severely limit the phonon transport and lead to a relatively low kl,29,92,93 we uncover a giant ZA mode anharmonicity at the long-wavelength limit, as also reported for single-layer TMDs94 and SnX2 (X = S, Se).88
To gain further insight regarding the atomic anharmonic interactions, the total phonon scattering rates as shown in Fig. 8(c) are also calculated. Compared with other Janus monolayers, such as M2XY (M = Ga; X, Y = S, Se, Te),12 one can easily see that TeSSe possesses a larger total phonon scattering rate determined by three phonon transition probabilities. The phonon scattering rate is inversely proportional to the phonon lifetimes, which have a significant impact on the anharmonicity and attenuation of the lattice thermal conductivity.29 Combined with the above discussion, we deduce that the ultralow kl originates from the fact that the Janus TeSSe monolayer has the characteristics of a small phonon group velocity, a giant Grüneisen parameter, and a large phonon scattering rate.
Then, by employing the calculated PF, ke, and kl, we determine the dimensionless figure of merit as depicted in Fig. 9 using the formula: ZT = S2σT/(ke + kl). Normally, a larger figure of merit implies a better thermoelectric performance of the materials and vice versa. Fig. 9(a and b) shows the figure of merit of the n-type and p-type doping Janus α-TeSSe at different doping levels as a function of the temperature, which ranges from 300 K to 600 K. It is worth noting that the value of ZT for n-type doping exhibits the opposite behavior with temperature compared with that of p-type doping. For the p-type case, ZT increases with the temperatures, as is common in most other reports,8,55,95 mainly due to both ke and kl decreasing with the increase in the temperature. However, the value of ZT decreases slightly for n-type doping as also reported in the SiTe2 monolayer.85 This can be attributed to the fact that when the temperatures vary from 300 K to 600 K, the PF decreases significantly, mainly due to the decrease of the electronic conductivity σ (see Fig. S6, ESI†). Additionally, kl decreases significantly with increasing temperature, which compensates for the decrease in the PF, and thus leads to the maximum value of ZT being almost unchanged. In addition, we summarize the temperature-dependent maximum in ZT in Table 4, together with those of the other 1T-phase monolayers and Janus monolayers. Furthermore, the p-type doping thermoelectric performance is superior to that of n-type doping, which is related to a larger DOS near the VBM.30,79 This shows that the Janus TeSSe exhibits excellent ZT, such as 0.79, 0.78, and 0.77 for n-type doping, as well as 0.89, 1.15, and 1.95 for p-type doping at 300 K, 400 K, and 600 K, respectively, which makes it a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, based on first-principles calculations, the band structure, and the optic, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric performances of the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer are analyzed. The phonon dispersion and AIMD simulations confirm that the α-TeSSe monolayer is dynamically and thermally stable. Janus α-TeSSe is a narrow bandgap semiconductor, which is beneficial for thermoelectric performance. The ELF is also systematically studied. With such outstanding absorption coefficients, the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer may be a promising optoelectronic device. Furthermore, the DFPT calculations confirm that Janus α-TeSSe has an excellent piezoelectric response with the coexistence of in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients d11 (17.17 pm V−1) and d31 (0.22 pm V−1), indicating its potential application in piezoelectric devices.
Finally, the electronic transport and phonon transport properties are evaluated. The hole (electron) mobility follows T−1.23 (T−2.03) behavior due to the lattice scattering mechanism being dominant. The ultralow lattice thermal conductivity occurs due to the small phonon group velocity, large phonon scattering rate, and large Grüneisen parameter. The EFF at room temperature is also calculated, and it describes the band complexity concerning thermoelectric behavior. Moreover, combined with ultralow thermal conductivity and outstanding electrical properties, ultrahigh ZT values are found for p-type doping of the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer, indicating that it is a good p-type thermoelectric material. In conclusion, our research shows that the Janus α-TeSSe monolayer has broad application prospects in the fields of photovoltaics, piezoelectrics, and thermoelectrics, which will greatly stimulate related experiments.
