    , Accepted 24th June 2019First published on 24th June 2019AbstractThe fabrication of noble-metal-free and low-cost photocatalysts with high efficiency has been under increasing demand for solar energy usage and conversion. In this work, a series of surface-modified Ni/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalysts derived from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized by the in situ pyrolysis of Ni-based benzenedicarboxylic acid Ni2(BDC)2 in the presence of graphitic carbon nitride under Ar protection. The as-prepared samples displayed highly efficient H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation, with a maximum H2 production rate of 2989.5 μmol g−1 h−1, which was about 22.1 times higher than the value of carbon nitride (135.2 μmol g−1 h−1). This exceptionally enhanced photocatalytic activity originated from the tight bonding between the Ni-based cocatalyst and g-C3N4 as well as fast and efficient electron transfer with the help of conductive carbon loaded on the surface of the Ni species during Ni2(BDC)2 pyrolysis.
1. Introduction
In recent years, people around the world have witnessed increasingly serious global environmental pollution and energy crisis.1 Great scientific efforts have been devoted to solar-driven reactions, which can convert sustainable and inexhaustible solar energy into clean, renewable H2 and other value-added fuel resources.2–7 Among the various available semiconductor catalysts, metal-free visible-light-responsive g-C3N4 has emerged as a promising candidate due to its unique features, such as earth abundance, nontoxicity, low cost, flexible layers and favourable band structure and chemical stability.8–10 Unfortunately, the photocatalytic activity of pristine g-C3N4 is still far from satisfactory since it can only absorb light of wavelengths shorter than 460 nm and suffers from rapid recombination of charge carriers.11 In past decades, various strategies, such as heterostructure design,12 metal and non-metal doping,13–15 nanostructure engineering,13,16–18 and molecular copolymer construction,19 have been developed to tackle this problem.
In fact, loading co-catalysts onto bulk g-C3N4 is also a common and effective method to promote charge carrier separation and thus enhances its catalytic activity because co-catalysts such as Pt, Pd, Au and other non-noble metals not only work as electron traps but also provide more active sites for H2 evolution during photocatalytic water splitting.2,20–22 Noble metals have been demonstrated to be highly efficient co-catalysts, but their rarity and high price limit large-scale usage. Therefore, it is necessary to find some low-cost and earth-abundant materials to replace noble metals. In recent years, Ni-based catalysts such as Ni(OH)2, Ni2P, NiS and NiO have attracted wide attention for water splitting.23,24 Particularly, metallic Ni with a high work function can play the same role as noble metals in trapping photo-irradiated electrons.25
Two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) having high porosity, well-defined and periodic structure, large specific surface area, and high aspect ratio are composed of metal nodes and organic ligands connected by coordination bonds and have received worldwide attention.26–28 Recently, 2D MOFs have been widely applied in photocatalysis,29,30 fuel cells,31,32 hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction,33–35 CO2 reduction,36 rapid detection,37 organic adsorption38 and CO2 fixation.39 On the one hand, most MOFs suffer from poor thermal and chemical stabilities, which limit their application in harsh environments. On the other hand, due to their unique structural characteristics, MOFs can also be used as sacrificial templates to construct non-precious co-catalysts with highly dispersed active sites.40 Furthermore, MOF-derived materials have some advantages: 1) to some extent, the derived samples inherit the high porosity and large surface area from MOF precursors, exposing relatively many more active sites. 2) MOF precursors with various uniformly dispersed metals can afford high dispersion of the modified metal in these derived catalysts. 3) The morphologies of derivatives can be easily tuned. 4) Abundant nitrogen species in the MOF precursors can ensure the stability of the derived metal through efficient anchors. 5) The carbon on the Ni surface resulting from the ligands in MOF can greatly improve the electrical conductivity of the final photocatalyst.41
Herein, a tight coupling interface between surface-modified Ni and g-C3N4 (Ni/CN) was designed and synthesized to enhance the charge transfer and separation for efficient photocatalytic water splitting without any noble metals. The photocatalytic activity study showed that this kind of catalyst can work efficiently for water splitting under visible-light irradiation. Notably, the optimized Ni/CN achieved a high H2 evolution rate of 2989.5 μmol g−1 h−1. This greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the tight coupling between the MOF-derived Ni species and g-C3N4 as well as the efficient electron transfer resulting from the conductive carbon on the surface of the uniformly distributed Ni species. We also discussed the mechanism of H2 evolution on this kind of surface-modified Ni/CN catalyst. This work might provide a new avenue for MOF-derived co-catalysts for H2 production from water.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
All the chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp., and Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. They were used as received without further treatment. Deionized water supplied by Millipore system (Direct-Q 3UV) was used in the whole experiment.
2.2. Catalyst synthesis
The two-dimensional Ni-based MOF was prepared via an ultrasonic-assisted method at room temperature, as reported in the literature42 with a slight modification. In detail, the solvent N,N-dimethylformamide (32 ml), deionized water (2 ml) and ethanol (2 ml) were added and mixed in a tube. Then, 0.75 mmol 1,4-benzene dicarboxylic acid (BDC) was dissolved in the above solvent. Next, 0.75 mmol NiCl2·6H2O was introduced and dissolved. Finally, 0.8 ml triethylamine was injected into the salt solution, producing a colloidal suspension. After being vibrated uniformly, the colloidal suspension was ultra-sonicated for 8 h. The final product was obtained via centrifugation, washed with ethanol at least 3 times, and dried in a vacuum oven overnight. The Co-based 2D MOF was synthesized by the same procedure except that NiCl2·6H2O was replaced by CoCl2·6H2O. g-C3N4 (labelled as CN) was synthesized by urea thermal polymerization.43 In a typical procedure, 10 g urea was covered in an alumina crucible and calcinated at 550 °C in air for 2 h. The ramp rate was set to 5 °C min−1.

Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation process for the surface-modified Ni/g-C3N4 samples. First, 0.4196 g g-C3N4 and 0.06 g of 2D Ni2(BDC)2 were mixed in 5 mL ethanol and ground in an agate mortar. Then, after being dried at room temperature, the self-assembly mixture was calcinated under an Ar atmosphere at different temperatures for 3 h with a heating speed of 5 °C min−1. The obtained samples were denoted as Ni/CN-y, where y refers to the calcination temperature. The influence of the added Ni-MOF amount on H2 evolution was also studied in this manuscript. These samples were labelled as xNi/CN, where x represents the added Ni-MOF mass in gram, and they were calcined at 525 °C.

2.3. Characterization
Power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were determined by an X-ray diffractometer (RINT-2000; Rigaku Corp., Japan) with Cu Kα radiation. The test was operated at 30 mA and 45 kV in the range of 10–80°, with a scanning rate of 4° min−1. A JEM-2100F field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM) was used to obtain a transmission electron microscopy picture as well as high-resolution TEM and selected area electron diffraction. Hitachi S-4800 was applied for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), element mapping and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area of the samples was characterized via nitrogen physisorption (using Micromeritics Tristar 2000) at 77 K. The diffuse reflectance spectra between 200 and 800 nm were recorded on a UV-2500 PC Shimadzu spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as the reference. Then, the UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained by Kubelka–Munk transformation. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these samples were recorded on a JASCO FP-6500 spectrophotometer at room temperature. A PHI Quantera SXM spectrometer with an Al Kα radiation line source was used to record X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data and analyse the samples' surface composition and chemical state. The binding energy located at 284.6 eV of the surface adventitious carbon (C 1s) was chosen as a reference to calibrate all the other binding energies for the high resolution spectra. Raman spectra were recorded on a Raman spectrometer (Horiba-Jobin-Yvon, T64000, Japan) with laser excitation at 532 nm.
2.4. Photocatalytic evaluation
Photocatalytic H2 evolution was performed with 20 mg of pre-synthesized catalyst in 80 mL solution including 60 mL H2O and 20 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) in a quartz glass reaction vessel. Ten mg Eosin Y was employed and functioned as a photosensitizer in the reaction solution. The cell was equipped with an optical entry window and connected to a closed gas circulation system. The photocatalytic reaction was triggered by visible light (λ > 420 nm) generated by a 300 W xenon arc lamp equipped with a UV cut-off filter. The generated H2 was intermittently examined by an online gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu Co., Japan) with a thermal conductor detector.
2.5. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements including photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were carried out using a CHI electrochemical workstation (ALS/CH model 650A) in a conventional standard three-electrode system. A Pt foil and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The AM 1.5 solar simulation (WXS-80C-3 AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) was employed as the light source for photocurrent measurements. The electrolyte was made up of 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. EIS was performed with the same three-electrode system in dark. The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 1 mg photocatalyst was added to 1 mL ethanol and 20 μL Nafion (5 wt%) solution. After being ultra-sonicated for 10 min, the mixture became a slurry. The slurry was then coated onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass electrode. Finally, the electrode was dried naturally in air and annealed at 200 °C for 0.5 h in an N2 atmosphere.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and physicochemical characteristics
In X-ray diffraction patterns, graphitic carbon nitride shows two distinct peaks at around 27.3° and 13.1° (Fig. 1a), originating from the characteristic (002) interlayer stacking reflection and (100) in-plane repeated tri-s-triazine units, respectively. Remarkably, the intensity of these two peaks decreased significantly after being calcined with Ni-MOF at 525 °C, which is usually caused by the decreased crystallinity and/or thickness of carbon nitride layers during thermal treatment.18,44 Compared with the peaks of original carbon nitride, the peaks at around 27° shifted to a lower 2 theta degree (Fig. 1b), demonstrating an increased distance between the nanosheet layers in the samples. Similar phenomena were also detected and reported in previous works.44,45 No Ni species patterns were detected in these samples, which was mainly attributed to their low content and high dispersion. The textural and structural properties of CN and the representative 0.06 Ni/CN were further investigated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption characterizations at 77 K (Fig. S1†). The profound N2 uptake at 0.9 relative pressure (P/P0) indicated the existence of mesoporosity in the samples. The specific area of CN showed slight decrease from 109.2 to 64.9 m2 g−1 after the loading of surface-modified Ni species.

The morphologies of CN and 0.06 Ni/CN annealed at 525 °C were further observed by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 2. The pristine CN prepared from urea exhibited layered platelets with curled edges. This platelet structure was retained well after the introduction of Ni species although the CN nanosheets increased in size. The conductivity of surface-modified Ni/CN was greatly enhanced, as demonstrated in Fig. 2b with a brighter view under the same test condition; this was mainly due to the presence of carbon on the sample's surface. Small nanoparticles can be detected in the TEM images, as circled in Fig. 2d. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was employed to investigate the crystal properties of Ni/CN (Fig. 2e). Crystal planes with lattice spacing values of 0.20, 0.34 and 0.40 nm, corresponding to the (111), (110) and (100) lattice planes of metallic Ni, carbon and g-C3N4, were observed in Ni/CN. The Ni species were uniformly dispersed on the surface of the Ni/CN catalyst, as observed by element mapping (Fig. S2†).

To precisely investigate the surface chemical composition of these photocatalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed in this work. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, typical peaks for C, N, Ni and O emerge for the Ni/CN sample prepared at 525 °C. C and N species were the main elements in surface-modified Ni/CN (Ni-MOF addition, 0.06 g; calcination temperature, 525 °C), accounting for about 93% by atom, while the Ni content was about 2.98% by atom. Except for C and N, a small amount of O could also be detected in CN, which likely originated from surface-absorbed O2, H2O and/or CO2 molecules during urea pyrolysis at a high temperature.16,46Fig. 3b demonstrates that the high-resolution C 1s spectra of CN can be fitted with four peaks with binding energies of 284.6, 286.1, 288.2 and 293.8 eV, corresponding to the C–C coordination of surface adventitious carbon, sp2-hybridized carbon, NC–N coordination, and π-excitation.47,48 Compared with the observation for pristine CN, the peak area located at 286.1 eV became much larger, indicating that more functional bonds were formed in the surface-modified Ni/CN sample. This enlarged area was mainly due to the introduction of sp2-hybridized carbon derived from Ni-MOFs, which was also observed using Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. S3.† The bands at 475 and 1100 cm−1 were attributed to the vibration of the tri-s-triazine heteroatom ring, while the band at 552 cm−1 was ascribed to the in-plane symmetrical stretching vibration of heptazine heterocycles.49 As reported by Wang et al.,50 no significant signal related to graphitic carbon can be observed for pristine CN samples. However, two bands at 1582 and 1346 cm−1 defined as graphitic G and D bands emerged for the surface-modified Ni/CN sample. The G band is associated with the degree of graphitization, while the D band is associated with the partial disorder or defects in graphitic carbon.51 The emergence of these two bands demonstrated the formation of graphite carbon with high conductivity in surface-modified Ni/CN, which will definitely facilitate electron transfer during the photocatalytic reaction. As shown in Fig. 3c, N 1s spectra can be deconvoluted into four separate peaks with binding energies of 398.7, 399.7, 401.0 and 404.2 eV. The strongest peak centred at 398.7 eV is ascribed to the sp2-hybridized nitrogen atoms in the triazine rings (C–NC), while the neighbouring peak at 399.7 eV is identified as the tertiary nitrogen in the N–(C)3 chemical groups.18 The peak at 401.0 eV is derived from the amino groups (C–NH).52 Finally, the presence of the terminal nitrate and charging effects in this sample can be demonstrated by the peak at 404.2 eV in the high-resolution N 1s spectra.53Fig. 3d shows the Ni 2p spectra of Ni/CN, which can be deconvoluted into five peaks. Typically, the two peaks at 862.2 and 880.4 eV are the satellite peaks of Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2. The Ni 2p1/2 peak at 874.5 eV represents the Ni2+ species in the form of NiO. Moreover, the Ni 2p3/2 peaks at 855.6 and 857.2 eV were also assigned to the Ni2+ species in the sample.25,54 However, no peaks related to metallic Ni could be found, which was mainly due to the easy oxidation by oxygen during sample exposure to air. This phenomenon was also detected by Yue et al.48 although they used NaBH4 as a reductant to synthesize metallic Ni. Therefore, the Ni species in this work were composed of core–shell Ni/NiO and carbon on the surface, which are similar to the Ni species derived from Ni-BTC MOFs.55 The high-resolution O 1s spectrum for the surface-modified Ni/CN sample is shown in Fig. 3e. The peak with the highest intensity located at 530.8 eV is associated with the lattice oxygen in NiO.56 The peak in the middle corresponds to the oxygen ions in the low coordination states. Additionally, the peak at around 533 eV can be ascribed to surface-adsorbed H2O.57

Fig. 4a shows the optical absorption properties of CN and surface-modified Ni/CN with varied Ni contents prepared at 525 °C under Ar protection. As expected, all the samples showed pronounced UV and visible-light absorption, signifying their visible light activity. It was seen that the CN catalyst could absorb visible light with an absorption onset at 451 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 2.75 eV. The addition of the Ni-based co-catalyst caused greatly enhanced absorption intensity in both the UV and visible-light ranges and a red shift phenomenon of the absorption edge, indicating the enhanced visible-light utilization efficiency and photocatalytic performance for the surface-modified Ni/CN samples. In the photocatalytic reactions, the photo-generated electron–hole pairs were expected to separate and move to active sites on the catalyst surface. Further insights into the charge carrier transfer behaviour were obtained by photoluminescent (PL) quenching. The introduction of Ni species led to obvious suppression of the electron–hole recombination in the Ni/CN samples, as demonstrated by the substantially weakened PL peak in Fig. 4b. Under 320 nm excitation, the PL spectrum for CN shows a strong emission peak centred at 455 nm, originating from the band–band recombination of charge carriers. The dramatic decrease in this band-to-band emission intensity implied that the electron and hole recombination in the Ni/CN samples was inhibited effectively. Furthermore, the emission peaks of the Ni/CN samples showed a red shift, which could be ascribed to their narrowed bandgap since the emission photon energy is approximately equal to the bandgap energy.58 These phenomena could also be detected in samples calcined at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. S4.† It is worth noting that 0.06 Ni/CN showed the strongest light absorption and lowest PL intensity, both of which would ensure enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from water.

In addition to the optical response efficiency of these photocatalysts, the efficiencies of charge separation and transfer affect the overall H2 evolution activity.59–61 Hence, characterization approaches including photocurrent response detection and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were adopted. As shown in Fig. 5a, photocurrent density measurements of CN and Ni/CN were obtained during ten light turn-off cycles. It was clear that the photocurrent density value of Ni/CN was about two times higher than that of CN, indicating that the samples with Ni species may achieve more effective charge dissociation and higher catalytic activity. Furthermore, EIS was carried out to evaluate the charge transfer resistance during the photocatalytic reaction. The Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 5b reveal that the charge transfer resistance decreases with the introduction of Ni species, which is in agreement with the PL and photocurrent results. All of these results suggest that the surface-modified Ni-based co-catalyst leads to efficient separation, transfer and low recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes in photocatalysts.

3.2. Photocatalytic hydrogen production
The photocatalytic H2 evolution of all samples was studied in the presence of TEOA and EY photosensitizer under visible-light irradiation. As displayed in Fig. 6, only a small amount of H2 (2.71 μmol) is produced over pure g-C3N4 (CN) in one hour. After the introduction of a small amount of the co-catalyst, the H2 production increased to 3.11 and 6.25 μmol over 0.02 Ni/CN and 0.04 Ni/CN after one hour under visible-light irradiation, respectively. Further increase in the Ni content of the photocatalyst resulted in optimized H2 production of 59.79 μmol in the first hour, which was about 22.1 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. However, continued increase in Ni2(BDC)2 MOF resulted in decrease in the H2 evolution due to the blocked light absorption and covered surface active sites, which was consistent with the UV-vis measurements. As can be seen in Fig. 6b, the calcination temperature also has an influence on the photocatalytic activity. The coupling interface between g-C3N4 and the co-catalyst derived from MOF is not very tight when the calcination temperature is relatively low,25 while higher carbonization temperatures lead to a thick carbon cover on the surface of Ni species under increased calcination temperatures. Furthermore, Ni agglomeration could occur at high temperatures. This indicates that the synergistic effect of the Ni active species and the improved conductivity induced by the MOF-derived carbon on the Ni surface can enhance the photogenerated charge carrier separation and H2 evolution. Parallel experiments demonstrated that H2 evolution could be neglected in the absence of photocatalysts (Fig. S5†). The photocatalytic stability of Ni/CN-525 was evaluated by a recycling test. As depicted in Fig. 6c, the activity slightly decreases, which probably results from EY consumption. In order to demonstrate this assumption and the reason for the reduced activity, 10 mg EY was added after the third and fourth runs. During the last three recycles, the catalyst did not show obvious activity loss, implying good photocatalytic stability of the catalyst. In order to study structural stability, Ni/CN-525 was collected after the cycling test and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction. As shown in Fig. S6,† the XRD peak intensity and position of the used sample after the photocatalytic reaction show no change compared with those of the fresh sample, indicating that the representative sample is structurally stable. The chemical state of the Ni species in the used and fresh Ni/CN-525 was also studied and analysed by XPS, as shown in Fig. S7.† No changes were observed in the spectra, implying the high chemical and photocatalytic stability of the synthesized sample.

To verify the universality of this methodology for preparing surface-modified co-catalysts from 2D MOFs, Co/CN was fabricated by the same procedure as that of Ni/CN, and the co-catalyst Co was derived from Co-based BDC. Compared with pristine CN, Co/CN showed enhanced activity for H2 evolution, as shown in Fig. S8.†
Compared with the observation for pristine CN, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of the surface-modified Ni/CN samples was greatly enhanced, as mentioned above. This enhancement was mainly due to the favourable structural characteristics. The introduction of the surface-modified Ni species could not only strengthen the UV-vis spectral response, but also enhance charge carrier separation with the surface-graphitized carbon as an electron transfer bridge. According to the above experimental results, a possible mechanism is proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 7. In this EY dye-sensitized photocatalytic system, EY molecules were transformed into excited singlets, i.e., EY* and then to long-lived triplets, i.e., EY3* via band-to-band electron transfer and intersystem crossing after absorbing photons.62 EY3* was then quenched by TEOA, producing EY−˙ and TEOA+.63 Electrons would then transfer from EY−˙ to the CB of CN and surface-modified Ni species due to the high LUMO level of EY−˙.25 Under visible-light irradiation, the electrons and holes were simultaneously excited and separated in CN. The photo-generated electrons could then be captured by the Ni species in the surface-modified Ni/CN samples. Furthermore, the carbon anchored on the Ni surface could facilitate this trend due to its excellent electronic conductivity, resulting in enhanced charge carrier separation efficiency and photocatalytic performance. This charge transfer between CN and Ni species was demonstrated by the increased transient photocurrent and decreased PL intensity discussed above. H+ could be reduced to generate H2 by the electrons on the co-catalyst as well as those on the conduction band (CB) of CN. At the same time, the sacrificial agent TEOA could be oxidized by the holes on the valence band (VB) of CN. The H2 evolution rate on the pristine CN and surface-modified Ni-based materials was quite low, indicating that the synergistic effect between Ni and CN plays a substantial role in enhancing the photocatalytic reaction.64

Conclusions
To conclude, surface-modified Ni/CN samples derived from 2D MOF pyrolysis were fabricated and used for photocatalytic water splitting to produce H2 under visible light. The surface-modified Ni species in these samples played an important role in enhancing the H2 evolution activity. First, the introduction of the surface-modified Ni species enhanced the light absorption ability. Second, active Ni-based sites could act as an electron trap, capturing the electrons from CN and photosensitizer. Furthermore, the graphitized carbon on the surface of the Ni species accelerated the charge transfer. The maximum H2 production rate over surface-modified Ni/CN reached 2989.5 μmol g−1 h−1, which was about 22.1 times higher than that of pristine carbon nitride. This enhanced activity can mainly be ascribed to the promoted charge transfer and efficient separation of the photo-generated electrons from CN and photosensitizer molecules to Ni species through the highly conductive carbon. This work may provide a strategy to utilize MOF-derived surface-modified co-catalysts as substitutes for noble metals for effective H2 production.
