    , Accepted 27th June 2014First published on 27th June 2014AbstractAn expedient approach to the synthesis of well soluble symmetrical dialkyl-substituted α-oligofurans containing up to 8 π-conjugated furan heterocycles is reported. An ultimate symmetry and high solubility of these α-oligofurans were guaranteed using the 3,3′-diheptyl-2,2′-bifuran core and its symmetrical elongation through Suzuki–Miyaura or Stille cross-couplings. 3,3′-Diheptyl-2,2′-bifuran was prepared from 2,2′-bifuran-3,3′-dicarbaldehyde by the Wittig olefination and subsequent Pd/C-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation. The most appropriate access to 2,2′-bifuran-3,3′-dicarbaldehyde was achieved through a regioselective lithiation of 3-furanaldehyde acetal followed by CuCl2-induced homocoupling and deprotection. Single crystal X-ray analysis of 2,2′-bifuran-3,3′-dicarbaldehyde revealed anti-arrangement of the furan rings in planar molecules and an unexpected tight herringbone-type packing in crystals.
Introduction
Since the discovery of highly conducting polyacetylene in 1977,1 π-conjugated organic polymers and oligomers featured with electron delocalization along the conjugated backbone have attracted immense attention due to their important applications in numerous types of organic electronic devices.2,3 Advantageous electronic properties and good synthetic availability of variously substituted α-oligothiophenes and α-polythiophenes led these compounds to be the most popular π-conjugated materials.3 However, unsubstituted α-poly- and α-oligothiophenes starting from α-sexithiophene are practically insoluble and hardly processable.3,4 Attachment of solubilizing substituents at positions 3 and/or 4 results in twisting of the thiophene–thiophene chain from a coplanar conformation that is ideal for π-conjugation.5 Thus, an inherent low planar rigidity hampers significant optimization of the thiophene-based electronic materials.
Despite chemical dissimilarity between aromatic thiophene and more cyclic diene-type furan heterocycles, theoretical analysis predicted an essential similarity in the structural and electronic properties of the long α-oligothiophenes and α-oligofurans.6 In 2001 Curtis et al. reported that head-to-tail regioregular α-poly(3-octylfuran) exhibited a conductivity comparable to that of the corresponding polythiophenes.7 However, a presumption of the intrinsic instability of α-oligofurans comprising more than four furan rings8 survived until the year 2010 when Bendikov et al. disclosed synthesis of unsubstituted α-oligofurans in up to nine furan units length.9,10 Computational studies predicted elevated planar rigidity of the α-oligofuran chain compared to α-oligothiophenes.9,11 Indeed, unsubstituted α-oligofurans are highly fluorescent and have structured absorption and emission spectra, suggesting the coplanar-type conformation in solution.9,10 Raman spectroscopy evidenced that π-conjugation in α-oligofurans does not reach saturation up to α-octifuran.12 In the planar ferrocene-capped α-oligofurans an excellent charge delocalization was observed.13 The first experimental organic field-effect transistors with the active layer fabricated from unsubstituted α-octifuran, hexyl-capped α-sexi- and α-septifurans as well as from styryl-capped α-quaterfurans demonstrated high hole mobilities and on/off ratios akin to the observed in the corresponding oligothiophene-based devices.14,15
One of the major practical benefits of π-conjugated furan-based materials consists of enhanced solubility in comparison with the thiophene-based materials. For example, unsubstituted α-sexifuran is 20 times more soluble in chloroform than α-sexithiophene, but the solubility of α-septifuran and the higher analogs is still transient.9 Taking advantage of comparable electronic properties of the thiophene- and furan-based polymers with better solubilization of the latter's, Fréchet's16 and Janssen's groups recently applied oligofuran-diketopyrrole copolymers for fabrication of remarkably efficient bulk heterojunction solar cells with 3–5% power conversion performance.17
The valuable optoelectronic properties and a reasonable processability of α-oligo- and α-polyfurans prompted to consider this type of compounds as an emerging alternative to the thiophene-based π-conjugated materials.9–17 Yet, an assortment of the suitable furan-based π-conjugated compounds for organic electronic applications and convenient methods for their preparation is very limited and should be essentially extended. To address this quest, a study on the synthesis of the well soluble symmetrical disubstituted long α-oligofurans was initiated. This year, the first variant of the synthesis of dihexyl-substituted long α-oligofurans A, which was based on the Ni(II)-catalyzed Kumada–Corriu cross-coupling of 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bifuran (1) with hexylmagnesium bromide followed by bromination and the subsequent Stille cross-coupling, has been published (Scheme 1).18 Herein, we disclose the details of an expedient complementary approach to the synthesis of similar symmetrical dialkyl-substituted α-oligofurans A, for example di-n-heptyl-derivatives, starting from furan-3-aldehyde (2). We demonstrate the possibility to synthesize these promising well-soluble π-conjugated oligomers by avoiding highly toxic Ni(II)-complexes and organic tin reagents without essentially affecting the overall synthetic efficiency. A direct comparison of a scarcely exploited Pd(II)-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling17,19 for formation of the α,α′-furan–furan junction and the only applied Stille cross-coupling8,9,12–16,18,20 for assembling of the α-oligofuran chain revealed a comparable usefulness of both processes with a superior simplicity of the product purification in the first case.

Results and discussion
Our study was directed toward elaboration of a general approach to synthesis of symmetrical disubstituted α-oligofurans from simple commercially available furan reagents. In this paper, we describe preparation of the representative di-n-heptyl-substituted derivatives, which contain linear alkyl substituents suitable for efficient solubilization of the molecules. From the very beginning, we considered previously unknown 3,3′-dialkyl-2,2′-bifurans of type B (Scheme 1) as valuable central entities, which could be symmetrically elongated to give the soluble long α-oligofurans A. However, no reliable methods for preparation of the bifurans B have been reported in the beginning of this work. Thus, though dibromide 1 was reported in the year 1978,21 any reactivity of this compound was unrevealed before the year 2014.18 As a model, Kumada–Corriu cross-coupling of the parent 3-bromofuran (5) with alkylmagnesiums to form the corresponding 3-alkylfurans was documented to be inefficient.7,22 A complementary bromine–lithium exchange in 5 followed by alkylation with alkyl halides afforded 3-alkylfurans in modest yield.23
Based on the precedent of a viable CAN-induced head-to-head dimerization of 3-(pyrrol-2-yl)furans to 3,3′-bis(pyrrol-2-yl)-2,2′-bifurans,24 at the outset of this work we considered an option of the most straightforward access to the bifuran B directly from 3-alkylfuran 3. Following the reported low-yielding procedures for 3-octyl-7 and 3-propylfurans,22 the starting 3-n-heptylfuran (3) was initially prepared by cross-coupling of 3-bromofuran (5) with a freshly generated n-heptylmagnesium bromide in the presence of (dppp)NiCl2 or (dppe)NiCl2 in 20% and 24% yield respectively (Scheme 2). Alkylation of 5 through a low-temperature bromine–lithium exchange with n-BuLi in THF–HMPA followed by alkylation with alkyl halide23 failed completely with n-heptyl bromide and gave only 27% of 3 with n-heptyl iodide. On the other hand, Wittig olefination of the aldehyde 2 with n-hexyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (6) and LDA with subsequent Pd/C-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation25,26 of the 3-alkenyl-intermediate 7 provided 3-n-heptylfuran (3) in reasonable yield (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of 3-n-heptylfuran (3). Reagents and conditions: a, n-C7H15MgBr (1.4 equiv.), LNiCl2 (5 mol%), ether, reflux, 16 h, 20% if L = dppp, 24% if L = dppe; b, (i) n-BuLi (1.05 equiv.), THF, −78 °C, 1 h; (ii) n-C7H15I (1.3 equiv.), THF–HMPA, −60 °C, 14 h, 27%; c, (i) (n-C6H13)Ph3P+ Br− (6) (1.5 equiv.), LDA (1.5 equiv.), THF, −78 °C to r.t.; (ii) r.t., 14 h; d, HCOO− NH4+ (3.2 equiv.), 5% Pd/C (1.5 mol% Pd), MeOH, reflux, 2 h, 66% of 3 in two steps. 
However, all our efforts toward preparatively suitable homocoupling of 3-heptylfuran (3) to form either the head-to-head dimer 8 = B (R = n-C7H15) or other possible dimers were unsuccessful. In contrast to the recently reported homocoupling of 3-(pyrrol-2-yl)furans to 3,3′-bis(pyrrol-2-yl)-2,2′-bifurans,24 similar treatment of 3 with CAN in aqueous acetonitrile as well as in the dry solvent at −20 °C led to complex reaction mixtures containing <5% of the desired bifuran 8. It is known that 3-alkyl-substituents do not provide a valid differentiation of C-2 and C-5 positions in furans upon direct lithiation.27 Indeed, lithiation of 3 with n-BuLi in THF followed by treatment with anhydrous NiCl228 or CuCl229 resulted in regiorandom couplings to give inseparable mixtures of all three possible bis-heptyl-bifurans in 18% and 32% total yields respectively and ca. 20% content of the head-to-head bifuran 8 in each mixture. Hence, further attempts on preparation of the bifuran 8 from 3-heptylfuran (3) were abandoned.
At this stage, we considered an alternative formation of B from 2,2′-bifuran-3,3′-dialdehyde (4) using the same olefination/hydrogenation sequence as for the preparation of 3 from aldehyde 2 (Scheme 2). The dialdehyde 4 was assumed to be derived from some acetal of the aldehyde 2 taking advantage of the heteroatom directed ortho-lithiation/coupling methodology.30,31 Indeed, lithiation of the cyclic acetal 9, which is readily available from the aldehyde 2,32 in boiling ether followed by stannylation led to the 2-tributylstannyl-derivative 10 exclusively.33 Similar to that, we prepared the supplementary 2-iodofuran-acetal 11 by lithiation of the acetal 9 in ether followed by the treatment of the corresponding 2-lithiofuran intermediate with molecular iodine. In the next step, a traditional (Ph3P)4Pd-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling8,9,12–16,18,20 of stannylfuran 10 with iodofuran 11 in boiling toluene afforded head-to-head dimer 12 in 54% yield (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of 2,2′-bifuran-3,3′-dicarbaldehyde (4). Reagents and conditions: a, (i) n-BuLi (1.1 equiv.), ether, −78 °C to r.t.; (ii) I2 (1.1 equiv.), THF, −78 °C to r.t., 57%; b, 10 (1.45 equiv.), (Ph3P)4Pd (5 mol%), toluene, reflux, 8 h, 54% of 12; c, (dppp)NiCl2 (30 mol%), KI (2 equiv.), Zn powder (4 equiv.), HMPA, 100–110 °C, 14 h; 20% of 12 and 6% of 13; d, (i) n-BuLi (1.05 equiv.), THF, −78 °C to 0 °C; (ii) CuCl2 (1.05 equiv.), −78 °C to r.t., 63% of 12 and 4% of 13; e, glyoxalic acid monohydrate (12 equiv.), p-TsOH monohydrate (6 mol%), dichloromethane, r.t., overnight, 98%. 
An access to the head-to-head dimeric acetal 12 might be additionally simplified if a single precursor could be used. So, we attempted to dimerize the iodide 11 through the conventional Ullmann biaryl synthesis.34 While all our attempts to accomplish a copper powder promoted reductive homocoupling of the iodoacetal 11 were unsuccessful, 14 h heating of 11 with excess zinc powder and KI in the presence of (dppp)NiCl2 (30 mol%) in HMPA at 100–110 °C led to the diacetal 12 (20%) along with the aldehyde–acetal dimer 13 (6%). Finally, we were delighted to find that the diacetal 12 (63%) along with the minor aldehyde–acetal 13 (4%) could be prepared directly from the acetal 9 through its lithiation in THF followed by CuCl2-promoted oxidative homocoupling (Scheme 3). Surprisingly, no head-to-tail and tail-to-tail dimers related to 12 were detected in the reaction mixture. A recently reported application of NiCl228 instead of CuCl229 almost arrested the coupling leading to poor yields of 12 (5%) and 13 (1%). When lithiation of 9 and subsequent CuCl2-induced coupling were carried out in ether, poor solubility of CuCl2 and the copper-containing intermediates in this medium affected the feasibility of the process, resulting in 16% yield of 12 and 2% yield of 13. In the next step, the diacetal 12 was mildly deprotected with excess glyoxalic acid monohydrate35 and a catalytic amount of p-TsOH monohydrate in methylene chloride to give the bis-aldehyde 4 in 98% yield (Scheme 3). A similar deprotection of the aldehyde–acetal 13 afforded the dialdehyde 4 quantitatively. The molecular structure of the head-to-head dimeric dialdehyde 5 was determined by 1H, 13C NMR, and IR-spectroscopy, HRMS, and characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis (Fig. 1).36

The O2⋯H4′ and O2′⋯H4 intermolecular bonds combine molecule 4 in infinite plane chains lying in planes (111) and (1–11). (b) Herringbone-type packing of the molecule 4 chains (view along the [10 − 1] direction). 
Unlike the only reported X-ray structure of 3,3′-bis(pyrrol-2-yl)-2,2′-bifuran, which is characterized by a highly twisted syn-conformation of the furan rings,24 molecules of the dialdehyde 4 in the solid state are C2-symmetrical with a planar anti-conformation of the furan rings (Fig. 1a). A planar anti-conformation is typical for all the previously X-ray studied α-oligofurans9,13,15 and α-bifurans unsubstituted in positions 3 and 4.20,37–39 It is noteworthy that the planarity of the oligofuran backbone is almost unaffected even by the head-to-head junction in 3′′′,4′′-dihexyl α-sexifuran.18 The inter-furan C2–C2′ bond in bifuran-dialdehyde 4 is 1.4370(11) Å. This bond length is similar to that of longer α-oligofurans (1.431–1.439 Å),9 5,5′-di(thien-2-yl)-2,2′-bifuran (1.434 Å),37a and 2,2′-bithieno[3,2-b]furan (1.432 Å),38 and slightly shorter compared to the C5′′–C2′′′ bond length in 3′′′,4′′-dihexyl α-sexifuran (1.449–1.451 Å).18 In the solid state planar structure of 4 short intramolecular contacts between hydrogen atoms of the aldehyde groups and the oxygen atoms of the neighboring furan rings (H6⋯O2′ 2.4612 Å) are observed. According to the NMR data, the planar anti-conformation of 4 is likely preserved in CDCl3 solution. Indeed, in the 1H NMR spectra of 4 the aldehyde proton is detected as a broadened singlet at δ 10.50 ppm. This proton is considerably deshielded compared to the corresponding aldehyde proton in the additional furan ring lacking 3-formyl- and in 2-methyl-3-formylfuran (δ 9.90–9.95 ppm)40 as well as in 2-phenyl-3-formylfuran (δ 10.15 ppm).41 A noticeable low field chemical shift of the aldehyde proton in 4 probably resulted from a through the space deshielding by a closely positioned electronegative oxygen atom, which could be effective at such a short distance between the atoms as shown in Fig. 1a. We earlier observed a similar strong through the space deshielding of methylene protons by proximal oxygen atoms in the 2,3-dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane series.42
Unexpectedly, the packing of 4 is more similar to the packing of unsubstituted α-sexifuran than to the less regular packing of the more structurally related α-terfuran.9 The bifuran dialdehyde molecules 4 are combined by two hydrogen O2⋯H4′ bonds 2.4061(5) Å in planar chains. The chains lie in planes (111) and (1–11), forming a herringbone structural motif (Fig. 1b) with an angle of 146.22(4)°. The herringbone angle of 33.8° is much more acute than that of α-sexifuran.9 Two adjacent chains are connected with O2⋯H5 bonds of 2.5396(4) Å. The distance between two parallel chains is 3.320(1) Å. Overall, the molecules of 2,2′-bifuran-3,3′-dicarbaldehyde (4) are surprisingly tightly packed in crystals, and such a tight packing is reflected in an unpredictably high melting point (184 °C) and density (Dc = 1.574 g cm−3).
Having an optimized access to the dialdehyde 4, we processed it further to 3,3′-di-n-heptyl-2,2′-bifuran (8) (Scheme 4). Thus, Wittig olefination of the dialdehyde 4 with an excess of the phosphorane, generated in situ from the phosphonium salt 6 and LDA, led to the corresponding 3,3′-bis-alkenyl-derivative 14 as a mixture of E- and Z-isomers almost quantitatively. Subsequent Pd/C-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of 14 with excess ammonium formate as a hydrogen source in boiling methanol afforded 90% of the desired 3,3′-di-n-heptylbifuran (8) as a colorless mobile oil. Being solidified at −25 °C, the bifuran 8 could be stored for years as a stock precursor for longer α-oligofurans. Apparently, application of other reagents to olefination of the dialdehyde 4 and the following hydrogenation would enable access to a variety of 3,3′-disubstituted-2,2′-bifurans structurally related to 8.

Following a traditional approach to the synthesis of α-oligo- and α-polyfurans through the Stille coupling of the corresponding 2-furylstannanes and 2-bromofurans,8,9,13–16,18,20 we performed a bromination of the bifuran 8 with NBS to obtain the corresponding 5,5′-dibromo-2,2′-bifuran 15 in up to 98% yield (Scheme 5). A freshly generated dibromide 15 could be purified by flash chromatography (FC) on silica gel in the dark and isolated in the NMR pure state as yellowish oil solidified at −25 °C. However, the inherent instability of the dibromide 15 required its use in the next transformations as soon as possible, without any storage.43 In the next step, (Ph3P)4Pd-catalyzed reaction of the freshly prepared dibromide 15 with 2-furylstannane 16 in boiling toluene afforded the diheptyl-substituted quaterfuran 17 in high yield. However, huge amounts of hardly removable tin-contaminants are ultimately formed in the Stille cross-coupling, and at least three sequential FC were required for isolation of 17 of ≥95% purity.44 Since both the stability and yield of α-oligofurans are essentially decreased with elongation of the π-conjugated system,8,9 it was highly desirable to identify a viable synthetic method which allowed an easier purification of these sensitive compounds. We were delighted to find that the quaterfuran 17 could be efficiently synthesized through a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling, which is almost uncharted for the preparation of α-oligofurans.17,19 Indeed, after fruitless experiments with 2-furylboronic acid and potassium 2-furyltrifluoroborate, a mild heating of the dibromide 15 with 2-(2-furyl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolane 1845,46 in dioxane–water (10:1) in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2 and XPhos afforded a pure quaterfuran 17 in 73% yield after one FC only (Scheme 5).
 Scheme 5  Synthesis of 3′,3′′-di-n-heptyl-2′,2′′-quaterfuran (17). Reagents and conditions: a, NBS (2.03 equiv.), benzene–CH2Cl2, r.t., 2 h, 98%; b, 16 (2.5 equiv.), (Ph3P)4Pd (10 mol%), toluene, reflux, 8 h, 90%; c, 18 (3 equiv.), Pd(OAc)2 (7 mol%), XPhos (14 mol%), K3PO4 (6 equiv.), 1,4-dioxane–H2O (10:1), 55–60 °C, 12 h, 73%. 
Bromination of the quaterfuran 17 with NBS afforded 5,5′′′-dibromoquaterfuran 19, which was isolated by FC as an unstable yellow solid.43 Being considerably more labile compared to dibromobifuran 15, a purified 19 spontaneously exothermically decomposed over less than an hour at r.t. Though dibromoquaterfuran 19 could be used without isolation in the Stille coupling with a large excess of 16 to give diheptylsexifuran 20 in 12% yield after tedious FC purifications,‡ for more reasonable access to 20 and to diheptyloctifuran 21 we turned to the cross-couplings of more stable dibromobifuran 15. In fact, all the previously reported syntheses of α-sexifurans and α-octifurans were achieved using Stille coupling of 5,5′-dibromo-2,2′-bifurans with 5-tributyltin-2,2′-bifuran (22) and 5-tributyltin-2,2′:5′,2′′-terfuran (23) respectively.9,18 For elongation of the α-oligofuran chain through the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction α-oligofuran pinacolboronates 24 (n = 1) and 25 (n = 2) were prepared by lithiation of bifuran 26 (n = 1) or terfuran 26 (n = 2) followed by borylation with 2-iso-propoxy-1,3,2-dioxaborolane 27 (Scheme 6).
 Scheme 6  Preparation of 2-(α-oligofur-5-yl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolanes 24 and 25. Reagents and conditions: i, n-BuLi (1.15 equiv.), THF, −78 °C to 0 °C; ii, 27 (1.4 equiv.), −78 °C to r.t., overnight at r.t.; 49% of 24 and 33% of 25. 
(Ph3P)4Pd-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling of the dibromobifuran 15 with 3 equiv. of 5-stannylbifuran 22 in boiling toluene afforded the diheptyl-substituted α-sexifuran 20, which was isolated by sequential FC in 41% yield (Scheme 7). Upon using 5-stannylated terfuran 23 in the Stille coupling with dibromide 15, diheptyl-substituted α-octifuran 21 was prepared in 23% yield. The supplementary Pd(OAc)2/XPhos-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of 15 with an excess of the bifurane-pinacolboronate 24 gave 35% yield of α-sexifuran 20. α-Octifuran 21 (19%) was also synthesized through a similar Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of 15 with 5-terfurylboronate 25 (Scheme 7).
 Scheme 7  Synthesis of long α-oligofurans 20 and 21. Reagents and conditions: a, 22 or 23 (3 equiv.), (Ph3P)4Pd (10 mol%), toluene, reflux, 12 h, 41% yield of 20 or 23% of 21; b, 24 or 25 (3 + 2 equiv.), Pd(OAc)2 (8 mol%), XPhos (16 mol%), K3PO4 (6 equiv.), 1,4-dioxane–H2O (10:1), 55–60 °C, 8 + 8 h, 34% yield of 20 or 21% of 21. 
All the cross-couplings depicted in Scheme 7 are evidently accompanied with a number of competing processes. Particularly, protodeboronation47 of the α-oligofurylboronates 24 and 25 resulting in the release of α-bifuran 26 (n = 1) or α-terfuran 26 (n = 2) was detected in the syntheses of long α-oligofurans 20 and 21 by Suzuki–Miyaura reactions. TLC monitoring revealed a premature consumption of the boronates 24 and 25 after 8 h warming at 55–60 °C, while a considerable amount of dibromide 15 still remained in the reaction mixture. So, second portions of boronates 24 and 25 were added for completion of the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-couplings, and heating of the reaction mixtures was continued for additional 8 h. In another vein, substantial amounts of α-quaterfuran and α-sexifuran resulting from the Pd-catalyzed deboronative homocoupling48,49 of α-oligofurylboronates 24 and 25 were also isolated in the studied Suzuki–Miyaura reactions. Similar destannylative homocouplings,50 albeit to a less extent, were observed in the Stille cross-couplings of the dibromide 15 with 5-stannyl-α-oligofurans 22 and 23. For the time being, we did not succeed in suppressing these competing processes without affecting the desired cross-couplings.
Both applied Stille and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-couplings provided very moderate yields of the soluble long α-oligofurans 20 and 21 (Scheme 7). On the other hand, the previously reported hardly soluble unsubstituted α-oligofurans were isolated in even lower yields using a time-consuming vacuum sublimation as a purification technique.9 The isolated yields of α-oligofurans 20 and 21 were slightly lower in the Suzuki–Miyaura couplings than the Stille alternative. From a practical point of view, faintly lower yields in the developed Suzuki–Miyaura reactions are overcompensated by avoiding the poisonous organic tin compounds as well as by the less laborious isolation of the products (only 2–3 FC were required for purification in the case of boron instead of 5–6 FC in the case of tin).
The long α-oligofurans 20 and 21 are reasonably stable, high melting point deep-yellow and yellow-orange solids respectively, soluble in most organic solvents. For example, the solubility of 20 and 21 in C6D6 is more than 10 mg mL−1. A similar solubility was observed in 1,4-dioxane and in propylene carbonate, which could also be used for a formulation of relatively stable solutions.
Diheptyl-substituted sexifuran 20 and octifuran 21 were characterized by 1D and 2D (COSY, HSQC and HMBC) NMR, and by the field desorption (FD) HRMS, which gave intensive [M]+-peaks. The UV/Vis and fluorescence spectra of diheptyl-substituted α-sexifuran 20 and α-octifuran 21, which are essential for characterization of π-conjugated compounds, were found to be very similar to the thoroughly discussed data for dihexyl-substituted analogues.18 Evaluation of the synthesized α-oligofurans 20 and 21 as potential organic electronic materials will be reported in due course of the study.
Conclusions
In summary, we elaborated a convenient 7-step synthesis of symmetrical and well soluble dialkyl-substituted long α-oligofurans from the commercially available furan-3-aldehyde. In the key step of the synthesis, acetal of furan-3-aldehyde was subjected to regioselective heteroatom-directed lithiation followed by CuCl2-induced homocoupling to give the head-to-head dimer. A mild deprotection of the latter afforded 2,2′-bifuran-3,3′-carbaldehyde. High yielding attachment of the n-heptyl substituents to give 3,3′-diheptyl-2,2′-bifuran was accomplished through a Wittig olefination followed by Pd/C-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation. Subsequent bromination led to the corresponding 5,5′-dibromo-2,2′-bifuran. It was converted to the final diheptyl-substituted long α-oligofurans using either rarely applied, for assembly of the α-oligofuran junction, Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling or conventional Stille cross-coupling. Both processes resulted in similar yields of α-oligofurans, but much less laborious purifications of the products were required in the case of Suzuki–Miyaura reactions.

To a solution of 9 (2.170 g, 15.485 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL) at −78 °C a solution of n-BuLi (6.5 mL of 2.5 M in hexane, 16.25 mmol, 1.05 equiv.) was added. The heterogeneous reaction mixture was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to −78 °C, and solid CuCl2 (2.189 g, 16.28 mmol, 1.05 equiv.) was added in 3 portions (with 10 min interval between additions) under overpressure of argon and intensive stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at −78 °C, for 2 h at −35 °C, for 1 h at 0 °C and for 2 h at r.t. After cooling to 0 °C, the reaction mixture was quenched by addition of solid NH4Cl (883 mg, 16.5 mmol), stirred for 30 min at 0 °C and for 30 min at r.t. The mixture was diluted with ether (100 mL) and stirred for 1 h for better sedimentation of the inorganic black precipitate. A supernatant solution was filtered via a plug of anhydrous Na2SO4, and the remaining black precipitate was thoroughly extracted with ether–EtOAc (3:7). All the extracts were filtered; the combined organic solution was washed with 10% aq. solution of glycine (2 × 75 mL), water, satd NaHCO3 and brine, and dried over MgSO4. The solution was filtered, evaporated, and then the residue was subjected to flash chromatography (FC) on silica gel (gradient elution, from 5% to 40% EtOAc–hexane) to give the acetal-dimer 12 (1.362 g, 63%) and the aldehyde–acetal dimer 13 (78 mg, 4%).

CAUTION! In our first experiments with 5,5′-dibromo-3,3′-di-n-heptyl-2,2′-bifuran (15) we attempted storage of this NMR pure compound. However, the initially yellowish solid 15 after one day storage at −25 °C with protection from light turned its colour to greenish one even being cold. Upon warming to r.t., it spontaneously exothermically decomposed to give an insoluble in CDCl3 and C6D6 dark green stuff. An intensive white acidic fuming was observed during decomposition. Therefore, we suggest using the dibromide 15 in the next step as soon as possible after its isolation by flash chromatography (FC). Although no accidents occurred in our laboratory, it is obligatory to observe appropriate precautions for working with potentially hazardous materials like dibromides 15 and 19.
Since all the α-oligofurans are acid-, light- and oxygen-sensitive, at least the final FC of the quaterfuran 17 and the longer α-oligofurans is recommended to perform on Et3N-pretreated silica gel or on Florisil. Upon protection from a direct light, anaerobic conditions are not mandatory for FC purification of α-oligofurans up to α-octifuran 21.
