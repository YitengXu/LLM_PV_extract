    , Accepted 3rd May 2023First published on 4th May 2023AbstractAlkali post deposition treatment (PDT) of the absorber material is an efficient strategy to boost the desired photovoltaic performance of kesterite-based Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells. Here, a simple and innovative solution-processed cesium PDT method was employed as an effective strategy for the CZTSSe absorber bulk and interface modification toward efficient CZTSSe-based photovoltaic devices. The material properties of the CZTSSe thin film and the photoelectric properties of the corresponding photovoltaic devices are investigated subsequently. After Cs treatment, the Cs element is mainly detected on the surface of the CZTSSe-based sample, while the phase structure itself is not affected. Systematic studies reveal that the presence of small amounts of cesium in the CZTSSe absorber bulk results in a low defect concentration, prevents the bandgap tail states, enlarges the depletion region width, and reduces the carrier recombination. Meanwhile, the majority of the Cs element detected on the surface inhibits the carrier recombination, and leads to improved carrier transport and extraction. Benefiting from the synergistic optimization effects brought by Cs treatment, a champion device with 12.83% efficiency is achieved using the 1.25 wt% CsCl hot solution with a soaking time of 30 s, which is ≈26% higher than that of its pristine counterpart (10.21%). Our work offers judicious direction to expedite design strategies for solving bottleneck problems regarding the bulk and interface recombination, showing a promising future in developing efficient kesterite-based CZTSSe photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
Endowed with incomparable cost advantages and outstanding optical–electronic properties, kesterite-based Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells have experienced impressive advancements in the photovoltaic field.1–7 Through optimization of materials and device architecture, the state-of-art kesterite-based CZTSSe photovoltaic devices have made a remarkable breakthrough with a certification efficiency of 13.6% due to unremitting efforts over the past few years.8 Although tremendous progress has been made, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the CZTSSe solar cells still lags behind that of its predecessor, that is, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS)9,10 and cadmium telluride (CdTe),11,12 primarily due to the serious open-circuit voltage (VOC) loss triggered by defect-related charge carrier recombination,13–17 directly threatening further advancements in the final device performance. In light of this, reducing the VOC deficit is imperative for achieving high-performance CZTSSe-based photovoltaic devices.
To solve that issue, strategies such as isoelectronic cation substitution methods,18–22 additive engineering approaches,23–25 and alkali post-deposition treatment (PDT) techniques26–28 have been successfully developed and widely employed to tailor the material properties of a CZTSSe absorber and suppress the VOC deficit in CZTSSe photovoltaic devices. Thereinto, alkali PDT techniques has already demonstrated several beneficial effects in reducing the VOC loss and enhancing the performance of photovoltaic devices.29–31 So far the most research attention in CZTSSe-based photovoltaic devices has been focused on the use of a post-deposition treatment with lighter alkali metal (such as Li and Na) treatment, leading to many in-depth investigations which clearly related to an increment in the grain size, a passivation of the grain boundaries (GBs), and a modification of the charge carrier concentration as the major positive effects of lighter alkali treatments.32–36 Moreover, several studies compared lighter alkali metals and heavier ones (such as Rb and Cs) to examine their effects on CZTSSe based photovoltaic devices.37–40 Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the superiority of these two types of alkali metals on kesterite-based devices is still under debate, so additional investigations will be essential. As a member of the alkali metal family, Cs treatment has shown to improve the photovoltaic performance of CZTSSe devices by increasing the potential of the GBs for the CZTSSe absorber films,37 as in the case of other alkali elements. Impressively, in its predecessor, CIGS, Cs treatment not only affects the potential of the GBs, but more importantly, it also has a significant effect on the defect characteristics and carrier–transport properties of the photovoltaic devices.9,41–43 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the Cs treatment has a similar effect on CZTSSe-based solar cells due to their similar crystal structure and device structure. Nevertheless, these effects remain rather understudied in kesterite-based devices.
Herein, we employ a solution-processed cesium chloride post-deposition treatment (PDT) method as an effective tactic to considerably reinforce the performance of CZTSSe photovoltaic devices. The elemental distribution across the CZTSSe-based absorbers is identified by the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization studies, and the phase structure of the thin films is also observed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy measurements. A series of experimental results reveal that Cs treatment inhibits the defects in the absorber bulk and simultaneously improves the electron transfer at the CdS/CZTSSe interface, thereby contributing to boosted electron extraction and transport and constrained carrier recombination. As a result of the suppressed carrier recombination in the absorber bulk and heterojunction interfaces, the CZTSSe-based photovoltaic device fabricated using the 1.25 wt% CsCl hot solution with a soaking time of 30 s has delivered the best PCE of 12.83%, together with notable improvements in the VOC and FF. The proposed solution-based Cs treatment strategy provides a simple and effective means to boost the performance of CZTSSe photovoltaic devices.
2. Results and discussion
In this work, we proposed a simple and feasible tactic to considerably enhance the performance of CZTSSe-based solar cells by the solution-processed cesium chloride PDT method. The schematic is illustrated in Fig. 1. Briefly, cesium was deposited on the CZTSSe absorber by exposure of the CZTSSe thin films in a CsCl hot solution for a short-time, and then they were dried on a hot plate at 90 °C for 2 min. The process parameters, such as the solution concentration and soaking time were successively investigated, which enables us to obtain the best device performance.

The morphology, elemental depth profiles, valence states, and phase structure of the reference and CsCl solution treated CZTSSe samples were first carefully studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TOF-SIMS, XPS, XRD, and Raman measurements. From Fig. S1,† it is evident that the change of CZTSSe film morphology was not observed by SEM measurement, and both CZTSSe-based films exhibit dense and compact crystallinity. TOF-SIMS analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 2, was performed on the reference and 1.25 wt% solution treated final CZTSSe cells to investigate the elemental depth profile inside the CZTSSe samples. It can be observed that the majority of the Cs element is detected on the surface of the Cs-treated CZTSSe sample as expected, which is the same as for LiF-PDT and NaF-PDT,26–28,32,33 while the intensity of the depth profiles for the Cs element in the reference sample is low, which may come from the soda lime glass substrate. Apparently, the Na element in the two samples exhibits a similar depth profile, indicating that the Na level originating from the soda-lime glass (SLG) does not appear to be affected by the Cs treatment. In addition, the lower Cu level toward the CZTSSe surface is significant, which may be ascribed to the migration of Cu into the absorber bulk after Cs treatment. Besides, the reference and CsCl solution treated CZTSSe samples exhibit similar depth profiles of Zn and Sn, indicating that the distribution of these major elements is not affected by Cs treatment. The XRD and Raman results presented in Fig. S2† demonstrated that Cs treatment has little impact on the phase structure of CZTSSe-based samples. Apart from the tetragonal kesterite-type phase, no other binary or ternary impurity phase characteristic diffraction peaks are detected.

In conjunction with this, the evolution of the surface elemental composition for the reference and 1.25 wt% CsCl solution treated CZTSSe samples as shown in Fig. 3 was subsequently investigated by XPS, and the result is consistent with our expectations. As observed from the Cs 3d core-level spectra in Fig. 3a, the successful introduction of the Cs element into the surface of the CZTSSe-based sample can be proved through the detection of prominent Cs 3d5/2 peaks located at a binding energy of ≈724.8 eV. This result is in good agreement with the TOF-SIMS results. In the case of a pristine absorber film, no traces of Cs were observed. As observed from Fig. 3b, in the Cu 2p core-level spectra, both the reference and 1.25 wt% CsCl solution treated CZTSSe samples exhibited two dominant Cu 2p3/2 (932.6 eV) and Cu 2p1/2 (952.2 eV) peaks. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the content of the Cu element is marginally lower in the Cs-treated samples due to the addition of Cs on the surface of the CZTSSe absorber. Other elements, such as Zn 2p and Sn 3d were also found in both samples (Fig. 3c and d), and have not shown significant changes.

To evaluate the effect of Cs treatment on the photovoltaic performance, the CZTSSe-based devices with a soda-lime glass/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag architecture were fabricated. The cell performances of the photovoltaic devices were measured under standard 1 sun illumination with an active area of 0.21 cm2. The concentration of CsCl hot solution was first optimized. All the devices were fabricated from the same batch to provide analytical consistency. Fig. 4a illustrates the representative J–V curves of the CZTSSe solar cells with the concentration of CsCl hot solution varying from 0 to 2.00 wt%. In this case, the soaking time of CZTSSe absorber films was fixed at 25 s. The detailed device performance parameters, such as the open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), short-circuit current density (JSC), and PCE are listed in Table 1. In addition, the distribution of photovoltaic performance parameters is given in Fig. S3 and Table S1.† It can be observed that the photovoltaic performance of CZTSSe-based devices increases dramatically along with increasing the CsCl hot solution concentration from 0 to 1.25 wt%, and then decreases when increasing the solution concentration further to 2.00 wt%, with the 1.25 wt% CsCl hot solution treated device yielding the best cell efficiency. The champion device exhibits a VOC of 471.64 mV, JSC of 38.15 mA cm−2, and FF of 66.94%, leading to a PCE of 12.04% (Table 1). The enhanced PCE in the Cs-treated CZTSSe-based devices compared to the pristine sample (10.06%) mainly originates from the enhanced VOC and FF (with a VOC of 442.92 mV, JSC of 36.82 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.67% for the reference device).

To further optimize the cell performance, the soaking time was successively investigated based on a concentration of CsCl hot solution of 1.25 wt%. The J–V curves and statistical distributions of different parameters for the CZTSSe solar cells with the soaking time of CZTSSe absorber films varied in the range of 0–45 s are illustrated in Fig. 4b and S4,† and the detailed device performance parameters are given in Tables 2 and S2.† The results indicate that the CZTSSe-based absorber was immersed in the 1.25 wt% CsCl hot solution for 30 s, which gives an exceptional PCE of 12.83%, with a VOC of 490.16 mV, JSC of 38.32 mA cm−2, and FF of 68.30%. In contrast, the pristine device yields a poor PCE of 10.21%, with a VOC of 439.90 mV, JSC of 35.97 mA cm−2, and FF of 64.57%. To confirm the repeatability of the cell performance, 18 individual solar cells for each group are fabricated and statistical analysis was performed, as illustrated in Fig. S4 and Table S2.† As anticipated, all the CZTSSe-based devices give a steady photovoltaic performance, confirming that the process of this experiment is reliable and repeatable.

As discussed before, in this work, the 1.25 wt% CsCl solution with a soaking time of 30 s delivers the champion efficiency. The champion device with 12.83% PCE was realized due to the dramatically increased VOC and FF. Hereinafter, further photoelectric property characterization will be taken on the reference and optimized CsCl hot solution treated CZTSSe absorber films and devices to better analyse the origin of the improvement in photovoltaic performance. For convenience, the corresponding CZTSSe absorber films and devices were then, respectively, denoted as “untreated” and “Cs-treated” samples in the following discussion.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, [E × ln(1 − EQE)]2vs. E curves, and ln(−ln(1 − EQE)) vs. E − Eg curves of the representative untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based devices are illustrated in Fig. 5. It can be seen from Fig. 5a that the EQE spectra for a Cs-treated CZTSSe-based device displays an overall enhancement in comparison with the untreated device in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum region. Furthermore, the absorption edges of the two samples are merely the same, which hints that the energy bandgaps (Eg) of CZTSSe-based devices have not changed. By fitting calculations, the corresponding Eg values of the untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based devices are estimated to be 1.030 and 1.033 eV (Fig. 5b), respectively. So, the difference of VOC and FF for the final cells is not affected by the band gap change. In addition, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5a, the integrated current densities derived from the EQE spectra for the untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based devices are about 33.39 and 36.44 mA cm−2, respectively. This trend is basically compatible with the JSC result in the J–V measurements, exhibiting good reliability. Besides, the Urbach energy (EU), a measure for the degree of disorder within the material, could also be deduced from the EQE curves. From Fig. 5c, it is obvious that the EU dramatically decreased from 40.44 meV (untreated sample) to 32.18 meV (Cs-treated CZTSSe sample), implying that Cs treatment prevents the bandgap tail states in a CZTSSe-based absorber, which can effectively suppress the recombination of charge carriers.

The photo-generated carrier concentration and the electron extraction ability in the photovoltaic devices have an important effect on the charge-recombination process.44,45 To investigate the effect of Cs treatment on the electrical properties of CZTSSe-based devices, the capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were further characterized, as depicted in Fig. 6a. The corresponding apparent carrier density (NC–V), depletion width (χd) and built-in voltage (Vbi) of the two samples can be determined from the C–V curves according to the following equations46–49 (1) (2) (3)where C, A, ε0, ε, and q stand for the measured capacitance, the active area of the device, the vacuum dielectric constant, the dielectric constant of CZTSSe (fixed at 8.5 × 10−12 F m−1 from previous reports), and the electron charge (∼1.602 × 10−19 C), respectively. As shown in Fig. 6b and Table 3, the apparent carrier concentration can be estimated to be 1.44 × 1016 cm−3 and 2.22 × 1016 cm−3 for the untreated sample and Cs-treated sample, respectively. The possible reason for the increased NC–V is the consumption or passivation of deep-level donor defects by Cs treatment in the bulk of the CZTSSe-based films, similar to what we are concerned about in the case of other alkalis.29,50,51 The larger NC–V contributed to the improved VOC for a Cs-treated device. Additionally, the calculated depletion width significantly increases from 236 nm (untreated sample) to 281 nm (Cs-treated sample), signifying a more efficient photon-generated carrier separation and transport in the Cs-treated device, especially in the long wavelength region close to the absorption edges. Fig. 6c shows the plot of 1/C2versus voltage, where the Vbi can be estimated by taking a linear fit of a 1/C2vs. V plot at a positive voltage. From the extrapolation of a linear fitting line, the Vbi is calculated to be 0.465 V for the untreated sample and 0.686 V for the Cs-treated sample, again manifesting enhanced carrier transfer and extraction after Cs treatment. The increased Vbi for the Cs-treated sample could be responsible for the enhanced VOC and FF owing to the inhibited carrier recombination in the photovoltaic device, which is expected to enhance the final cell performance. These results further confirm that the increased VOC is mainly attributed to the suppressed charge carrier recombination and effective carrier separation and transport, which is largely related to the reduction of interfacial defects at the interface of CZTSSe/CdS.

In order to further shed the light on the origin of the enhancement of device performance in the Cs-treated CZTSSe-based solar cells, capacitance-mode deep-level transient spectroscopy (C-DLTS) was carried out on the completely untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based devices. The detailed procedure for the C-DLTS measurements was described in detail elsewhere.52,53 The C-DLTS curves of different CZTSSe-based devices shown in Fig. 7a show that both the untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based devices exhibit an obvious peak at 330 K (named H) in the range of 210–370 K. Therewith, the corresponding activation energy (Ea) and defect concentration (NT) of the detected defect are acquired from the Arrhenius curves by fitting the C-DLTS curves to further scrutinize the density of states in the CZTSSe-based devices, as shown in Fig. 7b and Table 4. As described in previous reports,53–55 the defects with the Ea values in the range of 0.20–0.40 eV could be assigned to 2CuZn + SnZn donor defects in the kesterite-based CZTSSe solar cells. From Fig. 7b and Table 4, it can be observed that the Ea of 2CuZn + SnZn defects has a deep level at 0.363 and 0.284 eV, respectively. As anticipated, the deduced NT is 8.57 × 1014 cm−3 for the untreated device while it decreases to 1.79 × 1014 cm−3 for the Cs-treated CZTSSe-based device. The decrease of NT for a 2CuZn + SnZn defect cluster is mainly due to the phenomenon that the existence of Cs+ ions in the absorbers could elevate the Fermi level (act as donor defects in p-type CZTSSe materials), which is in good agreement with the theoretical and experimental results reported elsewhere.29,51,56 This result confirmed that the 2CuZn + SnZn defects in the CZTSSe-based devices are effectively passivated by Cs treatment, which is compatible with the J–V, EQE, and C–V measurement results discussed above. The reduction of NT manifests less carrier recombination and more efficient charge transfer and extraction, which are essential for the fabrication of high-performance CZTSSe-based devices.

Additionally, to extract more information about the interfacial carrier transfer and recombination characteristics, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also executed. As illustrated in Fig. 7c, the Nyquist plots of the untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based devices were obtained at an applied bias of −0.4 V with the frequency range of 102–106 MHz in the dark state. The inset illustrates its equivalent circuit model. The corresponding electronic parameters of the cells fitted according to the inserted equivalent circuit model (as in the inset of Fig. 7c) are listed in Table 5. It can be observed that the Cs-treated device exhibits a higher Rrec and a lower Rs compared to the untreated device, reflecting the facilitated charge transfer and impeded carrier recombination due to Cs treatment, ultimately improving the device performance. Besides, the charge carrier lifetimes derived from EIS for the untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based device are about 1.40 and 3.74 μs, respectively. The increased charge carrier lifetimes for the Cs-treated device further proves the successful suppression of charge carrier recombination caused by deep defects. Therefore, the Cs treatment suppressed charge recombination in the CZTSSe devices through reducing deep-level defect states in bulk and modifying interface carrier transport simultaneously, enabling substantial improvement in the final device performance.

To further understand the underlying mechanism of the enhanced cell performance after Cs treatment, the temperature-dependent dark J–V profiles (J–V–T) were executed in a temperature range from 300 K to 100 K on the untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based devices, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 8. Notably, the dark J–V–T curves of the Cs-treated device show good diode behavior in a temperature range of 300 to 100 K (Fig. 8b), whereas for the untreated device (Fig. 8a), the diode behavior disappears almost completely when the temperature declines from 200 K to 100 K. The enhancement of diode behavior signifies the promoted photo-generated charge carrier collection and efficient carrier transfer dynamics in the Cs-treated CZTSSe-based device. Additionally, as can be seen in Fig. 8c, the Cs-treated device demonstrates a small ideal factor (A) and a low temperature dependence compared to the untreated sample, indicating that the carrier recombination is effectively inhibited after Cs treatment, which consequently improves the junction quality and enhances the final device performance. Besides, the information of the dominant recombination path for the CZTSSe-based devices was extracted from the dark J–V–T curves based on the famous equation described in detail elsewhere.57 As shown in Fig. 8d, the interface recombination activation energy (Eia) of the CZTSSe-based devices can be deduced from the slope of Aln(J0) vs. 1/kT curves. It is observed that the Eia of the CZTSSe-based solar cells increases from 0.723 to 0.960 eV after Cs treatment. Therefore, the values of Eg − Eia (the Eg values for the untreated and Cs-treated samples are about 1.030 and 1.033 eV (Fig. 5b), respectively.) for the untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based devices are estimated to be 0.307 and 0.073 eV, respectively. This result indicates a huge difference between the interface recombination velocities, and is thus responsible for the large VOC difference between the two samples.

The temperature-dependent Voc (Voc–T) measurements were implemented to further elucidate the dominant recombination mechanism and identify the interface quality of the above two devices, as shown in Fig. 8e. The recombination activation energies (Era) of the devices can be derived from the intercept of the Voc–T curve on the Y-axis following the methods described in detail by Mitzi et al.58–60 If there is a significant difference between Era and its optical band gap (Eg), interface recombination is the main recombination mechanism.60,61 Otherwise, the Shockley–Reed–Hall (SRH) recombination in the absorber dominates.62 Apparently, the Era of the Cs-treated device is 0.955 eV, which is relatively close to its Eg of 1.033 eV, whereas the untreated device has a significantly lower Era of 0.715 eV, far away from its Eg of 1.030 eV. This further consolidates the view that Cs treatment can effectively suppress the interface recombination process, and it is one of the main reasons for the performance improvement of CZTSSe photovoltaic devices.
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurement was conducted to analyze the influence of the Cs treatment on the surface electrical characteristics of CZTSSe-based films. Fig. 9a and b illustrate the surface topography maps of the untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based samples, and the result is in good agreement with the SEM results shown in Fig. S1.† Parts (c) and (d) of Fig. 9 exhibit the surface potential images which correspond to the surface topography maps in Fig. 9a and b. Fig. 9e presents the surface contact potential difference (CPD) images of the two samples. The line scans in Fig. S5a and S5b† correspond to the white line of Fig. 9a–d. Fig. 9e presents the surface contact potential difference (CPD) images of the two samples. From Fig. S5a and b,† it is clear that both the untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based samples exhibit a higher surface potential along the grain boundaries (GBs) in contrast to the intragrains (IGs), thereby causing downward band-bending at the GBs (Fig. S5c†), and are potentially favored for carrier separation and transport in CZTSSe-based films. Besides, the CPD is significantly increased from −482.99 mV to −97.21 mV for the untreated and Cs-treated CZTSSe-based samples, respectively. This result clearly indicates that Cs treatment has an obvious influence on the surface potential change at GBs of the CZTSSe-based thin films. As stated above, it can be deduced that Cs treatment in the CZTSSe-based absorber can noticeably inhibit carrier recombination loss and ultimately enhance the VOC and FF of the final photovoltaic devices.

3. Experimental
3.1. Preparation of CZTSSe precursor solution
2.8 mmol of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, 2 mmol of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 1.7 mmol of SnCl2·2H2O, and 13.3 mmol of SC(NH2)2 were dissolved in 10 mL of 2-methoxyethanol to prepare a CZTSSe precursor solution. The CZTSSe precursor solution was stirred at 60 °C for 2 h and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min to remove the impurities.
3.2. CZTSSe absorber preparation and CsCl-PDT processes
For the preparation of the CZTSSe precursor films, the precursor solutions were spin-coated on a molybdenum-coated soda lime glass substrate at 2000 rpm for 25 s followed by a pre-sintering process on a hot plate at 280 °C for 2 min. The thickness of the CZTSSe precursor films varied in the range of 1.0–1.2 μm when the above spin-coating/sintering operations were repeated 12 times. All these processes were performed in air. Then the selenization processes of the CZTSSe precursor films were implemented at 550 °C for 10 min under a selenium atmosphere as described in our previous studies.34,47,53 Subsequently, the CZTSSe absorber films were subjected to a CsCl treatment process. To prepare a CsCl solution, a certain amount of CsCl powder (i.e. 0 wt%, 0.50 wt%, 1.00 wt%, 1.25 wt%, 1.50 wt%, and 2.00 wt%) was dissolved in 40 mL deionized water and magnetically stirred at room temperature for 1 h until all the solids had dissolved. Next, the prepared CsCl solution was heated on a 90 °C hot plate for 0.5 h. Afterward, the selenized CZTSSe absorber thin films were immersed in the above CsCl hot solution for 0 s/15 s/25 s/30 s/35 s/45 s, followed by rinsing in deionized water, and then annealed on a 90 °C hot plate for 2 min. It should be noted that the reference sample was also annealed in air without CsCl soaking in this work.
3.3. Fabrication of CZTSSe photovoltaic devices
The CZTSSe photovoltaic devices with a standard configuration of soda-lime glass/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag-grid were fabricated according to the experimental scheme of previous studies.34,47,53
3.4. Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, external quantum efficiency (EQE) analysis, capacitance-mode deep-level transient spectroscopy (C-DLTS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) were all performed, and the current density–voltage (J–V) curve, temperature-dependent dark J–V profiles (J–V–T), and capacitance–voltage (C–V) curve were recorded as described in the previous reports.34,47,53 Temperature-dependent VOC (Voc–T) measurements were carried out using a Lakeshore 325 temperature controller and the temperature was swept from 320 to 120 K. The devices were mounted inside a Janis VPF-100 cryostat and cooled with liquid nitrogen during the measurements.
4. Conclusions
In this study, a strategic and efficient approach for Cs-PDT on the CZTSSe surface was employed to reinforce the performance of CZTSSe-based photovoltaic devices. The Cs element was introduced into the CZTSSe absorber by a solution-based method. Detailed TOF-SIMS and XPS investigations indicate that the surfaces of the untreated and Cs-treated absorber films are quite different in terms of their chemical and electronic structure, which may be ascribed to the migration of Cu into the absorber bulk after Cs treatment. Furthermore, no change in the surface morphology and phase structure is observed in the samples after Cs treatment, indicating that the distribution of these major elements is not affected by Cs treatment. The CZTSSe-based device based on the 1.25 wt% CsCl hot solution with a soaking time of 30 s exhibited significantly improved performance, directly delivering a champion efficiency of 12.83%, which outperforms that of the reference device without Cs treatment (10.21%). The reason for the increasing performance of the Cs-treated device is the step-wise increase of the VOC and FF as well. Careful investigations demonstrate that, thanks to the reduction of the defect concentration in the absorber bulk and the enhancement of carrier transfer and extraction at the CdS/CZTSSe interface, the charge-carrier recombination is greatly constrained. We provide conclusive evidence that Cs treatment inhibits the bulk and interface carrier recombination simultaneously, which can be linked to the reduction of the defect concentration and the enhancement of interface carrier transfer. This strategy effectively improves the efficiency of CZTSSe-based solar cells, and accelerates the development of kesterite-based photovoltaic technology.
