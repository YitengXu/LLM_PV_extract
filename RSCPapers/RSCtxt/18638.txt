    , Accepted 4th March 2014First published on 5th March 2014AbstractWe report the use of a facile and highly scalable synthesis process to control growth products of earth-abundant Cu-based oxides and their application in relevant photoelectrochemical and electrochemical solar fuel generation systems. Characterization of the synthesized Cu(I)/Cu(II) oxides indicates that their surface morphology and chemical composition can be simply tuned by varying two synthesis parameters (time and temperature). UV-Vis spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy studies are performed to estimate the band structures and electronic properties of these p-type semiconductor materials. Photoelectrodes made of Cu oxides possess favorable energy band structures for production of hydrogen from water; the position of their conduction band is ≈1 V more negative than the water-reduction potential. High acceptor concentrations on the order of 1018–1019 cm−3 are obtained, producing large electric fields at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface and thereby enhancing charge separation. The highly crystalline pristine samples used as photocathodes in photoelectrochemical cells exhibit high photocurrents under AM 1.5G simulated illumination. When the samples are electrochemically reduced under galvanostatic conditions, the co-existence of the oxide with metallic Cu on the surface seems to function as an effective catalyst for the selective electrochemical reduction of CO2.
Introduction
The sustainable creation of fuels from solar power is a promising renewable-energy technology that harnesses sunlight for the production of hydrogen/hydrocarbons from a water/CO2 feedstock via the photocatalytic dissociation of water and the (photo)-electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, respectively.1 Growing interest in solar energy has arisen from global concern over depleting fossil-fuel reserves and irreparable damage to the environment caused by greenhouse-gas emissions. Among all forms of solar energy, water splitting has the advantage of capturing sunlight, an intermittent energy resource, and storing it in the form of a chemical bond, H2, which can be burned and utilized as electricity on demand.2,3 Moreover, the wide-scale implementation of solar and other renewable sources of energy requires an improved means of energy storage, such as the reduction of CO2 to CO or energy-rich hydrocarbons.4 CO2 must be introduced as a key component in the value chain of chemical industries.5,6 For solar fuel production to provide a clean, abundant source of renewable energy that is also competitively priced compared to the current energy resources, scalable processing methods and earth-abundant starting materials will be required.2
To this end, metal-oxide semiconductors have emerged as desirable materials for working electrodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells and as catalysts for (photo)-electrochemical CO2 reduction.4,7 Of the metal oxides, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has gained particular attention for PEC water splitting because of the earth abundance of the metal.8 Generally, Cu2O exhibits p-type semiconductivity with a reported 2.0 eV direct band gap, making this material highly attractive as a photocathode for the direct generation of hydrogen from water.9 On the basis of its band-gap energy, Cu2O has a maximum conversion efficiency of 18% and a maximum theoretical photocurrent of 14.7 mA cm−2.10 Paracchino et al. have reported a photocurrent of −7.6 mA cm−2 for Cu-oxide-based photoelectrodes at 0 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using electrodeposited Cu2O and protected the photocathode with carefully tuned oxide multi-layers of ZnO (4 nm) and Al2O3 (0.17 nm) followed by a 11 nm TiO2 film decorated with a Pt cocatalyst. Although a significant contribution to the reported photocurrents in the literature originates from the reduction of Cu2O, they and others have proved that when a protection strategy was applied, significant amounts of hydrogen were generated by the oxide photocathode.8,11 The synthesis of Cu2O photocathodes is generally achieved through electrochemical deposition methods,10,12,13 physical deposition techniques,14–16 electrochemical anodization of Cu,17,18 and solution-phase methods.19,20 However, the reliable, scalable and mass-producible synthesis of high-quality p-type semiconductors that can efficiently drive the half-reaction of hydrogen production remains an important challenge.21
In contrast, the development of efficient CO2 conversion is desired because of the growing environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions.22 It is well known that polycrystalline Cu metal catalyzes the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to higher hydrocarbons more actively than other metals. However, this activity comes at the expense of the large overpotential that is required to favor CO2 reduction over hydrogen evolution. Recently, it has been reported that copper oxides and other metal oxides exhibit higher selectivities than metal electrodes for electrochemical CO2 reduction.23,24 The selective design of the metal-oxide surface composition remains an important scientific challenge for the practical large-scale application of the electrocatalysis of CO2 reduction.
In this work, we report on the use of a facile synthesis procedure to prepare highly crystalline p-type Cu2O semiconductors by thermal oxidation of copper foils with and without CuO nanowires on their surfaces. In these composite materials, the semiconductor is in intimate ohmic contact with the Cu substrate. Here, we focus on understanding the intrinsic nature of the copper-based composites synthesized in this manner, which have attracted tremendous interest for potential scalable applications. For PEC and electrocatalytic applications, it is essential to understand the redox properties and the semiconductive nature of these Cu-oxide-based composites. Systematic studies were conducted using electrochemical characterization, PEC measurements, impedance spectroscopy and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. In the PEC measurements, the pristine, as-processed planar Cu-oxide-based semiconductor photocathodes achieved high photocurrents under simulated air-mass 1.5 global irradiation (AM 1.5G). Remarkably, the sample produced at higher temperature (773 K, 2 h) exhibited onset potentials of approximately 0.8 V vs. RHE generating ≈1 mA cm−2 photocurrent at a positive potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, the synthesis of the photocathodes was highly reproducible because of the simplicity of the synthesis procedure, fulfilling a prerequisite for the possibility of high-yield mass production in the future. In the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, CuOx reduction was found to be essential before CO2 conversion. Given that pure metallic copper does not facilitate CO2 reduction under the same conditions (i.e., H2 evolution is favored), a thorough characterization revealed that the coexistence of metal and oxidized copper appears to be beneficial for CO2 reduction.
Results and discussion
Cu-based electrodes were prepared from high-purity Cu foil with a 25 μm thickness, which was cut into samples of 1.0 cm by 3.0 cm, cleaned and subjected to different thermal-oxidation treatments. The representative electrodes are further discussed below, and they were prepared using three different time and temperature combinations during oxidation: 573 K for 0.5 h (henceforth referred to as the “red” sample for convenience), 573 K for 10 h (“deep red”) and 773 K for 2 h (“black”). The cross-sectional and top-view SEM micrographs of the red sample are shown in Fig. 1a and d (also see Fig. S1a and b†). The granular surface contains particles ranging from 100 to 300 nm in diameter. Grains with a similar diameter can be observed in the cross-section along with voids interspersed between the grains. This layer was confirmed to be Cu2O on the basis of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shown in Fig. 2. The thickness of the Cu2O layer in the red sample was estimated to be 1 μm. Increasing the oxidation time from 0.5 to 10 h expanded the diameters of the surface particles to 400 to 1000 nm and led to the formation of more crystalline and void-free Cu2O (Fig. 1b and e and ESI, Fig. S1c and d†). This treatment also led to the onset of CuO growth, as indicated by the nanowire structures on the Cu2O surface in Fig. 1b. The cupric oxide phase was also confirmed via XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, vide infra). CuO nanowire growth on the deep red samples is sparse compared to the black samples, whose top views are shown in Fig. 1f and S1e and f†. The significant increase in CuO-nanowire growth at 773 K is consistent with other reports such that growth has been observed throughout the oxidation-temperature range of 773 to 973 K.25 In the black sample, the nanowires average 8 μm in length and 50 to 150 nm in diameter. A ∼400 nm layer of CuO at the base of the nanowires can be distinguished from the darker underlying Cu2O in the cross-section of the black sample shown in Fig. 1c. The thickness of the Cu2O layer increases from 1 μm (red) to ≈5 μm (deep red) to ≈10 μm (black). The weak CuO signals in the XRD pattern of the deep red and black samples, despite the highly dense growth of CuO nanowires on the latter, are attributed to the presence of a much thicker and more space-efficient Cu2O layer. As expected, the XRD peaks display a decrease in the Cu signals and an increase in the Cu2O signals while transitioning from the red sample to the deep red to the black sample (Fig. 2). This observation is in agreement with the increased Cu consumption and conversion to Cu2O observed with increasing oxidation time and temperature. The sharp Cu2O (111) peak, the tallest of all the Cu2O signals, suggests that the Cu2O layer is highly crystalline and that this orientation was maximized. The (111) orientation has been reported to offer better hole collection efficiency, lower resistivity and higher carrier concentrations than (100)-oriented films.26

XPS was used to study the surface state of the pristine samples. Fig. 3 presents the XPS spectra recorded for the oxidized Cu electrodes. The signals were corrected using the adventitious carbon peak C 1s at 284.8 eV as the reference. There were clear similarities in the analysis of the Cu 2p region for all samples, even though the thermal-oxidation treatment clearly affected the surface morphology and the oxide phase of the Cu-based materials, as first observed via SEM and indicated by the XRD results. In Fig. 3a, the Cu 2p peaks are broad, thus making the unambiguous assignment of the oxidation states of Cu challenging. However, it is apparent that the surface contains mixed-valence higher oxidation states. The XPS signal of the red sample, in which the bulk XRD result shows no signs of CuO, exhibits broad Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks with maxima at 933.9 and 953.8 eV, respectively, along with satellite peaks at 941.7, 944.4 and 963.0 eV. In fact, all of the samples reveal similar peak-maximum positions with an uncertainty of ±0.1 eV. The peaks located at 933.9 and 953.8 eV are assigned to the binding energies of Cu 2p2/3 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, from Cu2+ on the surface.27 Nevertheless, Cu+ with a reported doublet for Cu2O located at 932.7 and 952.5 eV from Cu 2p2/3 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, could explain the broadness of the observed peaks in these energy regions.28,29 The detected satellite peaks at 941.7, 944.4 and 963.0 eV are in good agreement with the values reported in the literature, suggesting a partially filled Cu 3d9 shell, which confirms the presence of CuO on the surfaces of all electrodes.29,30 In the red sample, Cu2+ may be present as a native cupric oxide layer that forms under the atmospheric conditions in which the sample was treated and subsequently exposed to air prior to the XPS measurement. This native oxide has been commonly reported to be 2 nm in thickness.8 The subtle shoulder and the observed broadness toward higher binding energies for the Cu 2p3/2 signal of the black sample may be assigned to Cu(OH)2 on the surface, which has a reported maximum of 934.7 eV. The formation of CuO nanowires was observed via SEM and confirmed via XRD for the deep red and black samples, and this finding is in agreement with the signals obtained from the Cu 2p XPS spectrum. The O 1s core-level XPS signal is presented in Fig. 3b. Two broad peaks can be clearly identified for the samples, with apparent maxima at 529.9 and 531.5 eV. The former is assigned to CuO, and the latter, which has an extended broadness to 531.8 eV, can be attributed to ionically bonded hydroxide oxygen.29 The O 1s signal for Cu2O is generally found at 530.5 ± 0.2 eV in the literature and may explain the broadness of the peak observed for all samples in Fig. 3b.29 The black sample exhibited a relatively broader O 1s peak at higher binding energy (≈531.5 eV), most likely caused by the overlapping signals attributed to chemisorbed water, chemisorbed hydroxyl oxygen and hydroxide oxygen.27,29 Based on the bulk and surface characterization, the Cu substrates are oxidized primarily to Cu2O at temperatures below 673 K. Although a very thin native CuO layer forms at low temperatures in air, as revealed via XPS, a longer and more severe thermal-oxidation treatment (>773 K) promotes the growth of a CuO layer on the surface of the Cu2O, as indicated by the XRD, XPS and SEM observations. The growth of this layer may be kinetically limited, and the slow rate of formation of CuO ensures a low vapor pressure of this Cu(II) phase, thus creating nanowires with uniform diameters (Fig. 1f and S1f†).25 Based on the XPS and XRD results, the nanowires were confirmed to be CuO with a plausible Cu(OH)2 layer on their surfaces.

To the naked eye, the surfaces of the black samples are far less reflective than those of the red and deep red samples; the black samples exhibit a dark, velvet-like appearance. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were transformed into the Kubelka–Munk function, as shown in Fig. 4, revealing estimated band-gap energies of 2.07, 1.45 and 1.42 eV for the red, deep red and black samples, respectively (see the Tauc plots in Fig. S2†). The estimated band gaps are in agreement with the reported values for Cu2O (2.0 eV) and CuO (1.4 eV).8,10,12,31 The Tauc plots suggest the existence of an allowed direct transition near 2.08 eV for the red sample, which is assigned to Cu2O and is in good agreement with the literature (Fig. S2a†).10 The black sample exhibited a downward slope that is steeper than the slope of the deep red sample when the Tauc plot was analyzed in allowed-indirect-transition mode (Fig. S2b†), which could possibly be attributed to the dense CuO on the surface of the black sample and is consistent with reports of CuO characterized as an indirect-band-gap p-type semiconductor.14,32,33 The literature contains both allowed and forbidden direct transitions along with allowed indirect transitions near 2.0 eV for Cu2O, in reasonable agreement with our results (Fig. S2b†).3 Compared to the deep red and black samples, the red sample has a large background irrespective of the wavelength, most likely originating from a thicker underlying Cu layer as a result of the shorter oxidation time. Cu is reflective at long wavelengths, and therefore, photons are given additional opportunities to be absorbed by Cu2O upon reflection from the Cu layer. At short wavelengths, Cu is absorptive, so the large Kubelka–Munk function can be attributed to absorption by both Cu2O and Cu.

The electrochemical behavior of the Cu-based electrodes treated under different conditions was evaluated in 0.1 M sodium acetate electrolyte (pH 7.9) at 5 mV s−1, and the results of two consecutive cycles are presented in Fig. 5a–c for the red, deep red and black samples, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were used to evaluate the stability of the oxides under various applied potentials. When the potential range of the CV was limited from 0.5 to 0.8 V vs. RHE, no significant faradaic currents were detected, and only double-layer capacitance was observed for all samples (black lines in Fig. 5a–c). The CV results for the red sample are shown in Fig. 5a; when the studied potential window was sufficiently large, three faradic processes were observed (AI, RI and RIII in Fig. 5a). CV was performed beginning from the open-circuit potential of the electrode and progressing toward more reducing conditions, and a cathodic signal appeared at potentials just above 0 V vs. RHE (RIII). Based on the SEM, XPS and XRD results, we assigned this cathodic current to the reduction of the relatively thin Cu2O layer on the surface of the Cu electrode. This reduction wave is consistent with the literature.8,34 Cu2O + H2O + 2e− ⇌ 2Cu + 2OH−, E° = 0.46 V vs. SHE(1)

A potential range limited to 0.5–0.8 V (black lines), 0.0–0.8 V (blue lines) or 0.0–1.2 V vs. RHE (red lines) was applied to study the redox reactions in the samples. (0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 7.9, 5 mV s−1, Ar saturated). 
When the scanning direction was shifted toward more positive potentials, anodic processes were observed starting at 0.8 V vs. RHE. The polarization curve exhibited a broad anodic wave; this anodic current was attributed to the oxidation of metallic copper. Moreover, the broad anodic redox peak was not unambiguously resolved; thus, the simultaneous formation of cuprous oxide and cupric oxide and the possible dissolution of Cu2+ into solution were also considered.35,36 Cu2O + H2O ⇌ 2CuO + 2H+ + 2e−, E° = 0.67 V vs. SHE(2) Cu2O + 3H2O ⇌ 2Cu(OH)2 + 2H+ + 2e−, E° = 0.73 V vs. SHE(3)
In the next cycle, a new cathodic peak appeared centered at ≈0.7 V vs. RHE. The broad peak in Fig. 5a (RI) may be assigned to the simultaneous reduction of both cupric oxide and copper hydroxide to Cu2O.13,34 When the anodic scan was limited to 0.8 V vs. RHE (blue line in Fig. 5a), the broad cathodic redox peak RI observed at ≈0.7 V vs. RHE disappeared. Only the reduction process at ≈0.1 V vs. RHE was detected (RIII), indicating that neither the formation of CuO nor the dissolution of copper occurred, and only the reduction of the Cu2O layer was observed.8Fig. 5b and c represent the CV experiments performed on the deep red and black samples, respectively. Note that the surfaces of the deep red and black samples are composed of two or three phases: Cu2O and CuO/Cu(OH)2, as previously discussed and confirmed via SEM, XRD, XPS and UV-Vis. The voltammograms obtained for both samples exhibit similar features, with two main anodic and two main cathodic redox peaks (AI, AII, RI and RII). For the anodic scan, the peak positions for both samples are the same: 0.85 (AI) and 0.90 (AII) V vs. RHE. Similarly, the positions of the cathodic peaks are the same for both samples: 0.59 (RI) and 0.49 (RII) V vs. RHE. This result may be an indication that the same redox reactions are occurring in both samples. When the potential scan of the deep red and black samples was limited to between 0 and 0.8 V vs. RHE, only the reduction wave RIII was observed (blue lines in Fig. 5b and c). Nakayama et al. recently developed an electroanalytical method of elucidating the reduction mechanism of copper oxides using a strongly alkaline electrolyte.37,38 They proved that under strong and weak alkaline conditions, the reduction of both oxides followed the same trend, in which the reduction of CuO was followed by the reduction of Cu2O in one step toward the metallic state. It is therefore important to note the possibility of a one-step reduction for both Cu2O and CuO in RIII (eqn (1) and (4)). CuO + H2O + 2e− ⇌ Cu + 2OH−(4)
Large cathodic and anodic waves were detected at potentials more negative than 0.2 V vs. RHE and more positive than 1.0 V vs. RHE. As previously discussed, the former is assigned to the reduction of the copper oxides and the latter to the oxidation of Cu2O.8 Under the studied pH conditions, the third large anodic wave at high positive potentials has been attributed in the literature to the dissolution of Cu2O, the probable formation of a metastable Cu2O3 phase just before oxygen evolution, or the plausible formation of a hydrated-polymeric form of cupric oxide.35,39–41 The AI peak is assigned to the electro-oxidation of Cu metal and the formation of hydrous Cu2O (the reverse reaction of eqn (1)).40 The AII peak is associated with the formation of complex hydrous CuO, most likely resulting in a duplex structure and forming a passive layer of Cu(OH)2 on the surface of the sample (eqn (2) and (3)).40,41 The RI and RII peaks are assigned to the reduction of CuO (the reverse reaction of eqn (2)) and the electrodeposition of Cu2O from dissolved Cu2+ ions, respectively. The RI peak is in good agreement with the previously reported electrochemical characterization of Cu2O thin films obtained through electrodeposition.8,42 There is a difference in the RI and RII reduction peaks between the deep red and black samples. The RI peak from the deep red electrode is smaller than the one observed for the black electrode. The opposite is observed for the R2 peak, where the area of the peak in the deep red sample is larger than the one recorded for the black sample. This result most likely arises because the black sample contains a larger amount of CuO on the surface, whereas in the deep red sample, Cu2O may be exposed to the electrolyte (as indicated by the SEM and XPS results). Therefore, in the deep red sample, the oxidation of Cu2O generates a higher concentration of Cu(II) cations dissolved in the electrolyte, increasing the charge of RII. The CuO/(CuOH)2 in the black sample may function as a passivation layer reducing the dissolution process, and because the amount of CuO is larger, the RI redox peak for the reversible eqn (3) and (4) is more prominent, forming more Cu2O from CuO.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to characterize the flat-band potentials of the samples and to estimate their intrinsic acceptor densities. A frequency scan from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at a fixed potential of 0.55 V vs. RHE produced depressed semicircles in the Nyquist plot (Fig. S3a†). Thus, a modified Randles circuit using a constant-phase element was used to study the semiconductor–electrolyte interface.43 Mott–Schottky analysis was performed by sweeping the potential at fixed high frequencies with an amplitude of 10 mV (1–100 kHz, Fig. S4†). The space-charge capacitance of the semiconductor was obtained from the imaginary part of the impedance, and the Mott–Schottky plots are shown in Fig. 6. According to the Mott–Schottky equation, a linear fit produces a slope that can be used to approximate the majority-charge-carrier concentration, and by extrapolation, one can estimate the flat-band potential of the system.10,43 (5)where C is the interfacial capacitance and V is the applied potential. Here, the constant A is the area, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, T is the absolute temperature, e is the electronic charge, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. As shown in Fig. 6, a plot of C−2versus potential may yield a straight line from which the flat-band potential (Vfb) and the carrier concentration (NA) can be extracted. Based on the Mott–Schottky slopes, the samples demonstrated the characteristic p-type character of the oxide layers.33,44 The extrapolated flat-band potentials are 0.75, 0.94 and 1.1 V vs. RHE for the red, deep red and black electrodes, respectively. For the red and deep red samples, minor frequency dependence can be observed from the slopes of the linear fits. This negligible effect most likely originates from contributions from the double-layer capacitance at the interface.43 Nevertheless, for a dielectric constant of εr(∞) = 6.6 for Cu2O,45 the carrier concentration can be reasonably estimated to be on the order of 1018 and 1019 cm−3 at high frequencies for the red and deep red samples, respectively. Based on the above estimations, we can further compute the maximum attainable electric field (Emax) and the width of the space-charge region (W).46 (6) (7)

For the red sample, the calculations estimate a depletion width of 18 nm with an electric field of 8 × 105 V cm−1. When the oxidation temperature increases (i.e., the deep red sample) the width of the space-charge layer is reduced to 7 nm, accompanied by an increase in the electric field to 3 × 106 V cm−1. Assuming an effective hole mass of 0.58 m0,46 we can estimate the effective density of states for holes at the top of the valance band, NV.46 The computed acceptor concentration places the Fermi level at 61 and 2 meV above the valance band for the red and deep red samples, respectively. Based on the optical spectra, we can reasonably assume a 2.0 eV band gap for the Cu2O layer and place the conduction band and valence band at −1.26 and 0.81 V vs. RHE, respectively, for the red sample. The relative band positions of the deep red sample are −1.13 and 0.94 V vs. RHE for its conduction and valence bands, respectively. These results demonstrate that the position of the conduction band of the composites is more negative (relative to the water-reduction potential) than is generally reported in the literature for electrochemically deposited copper oxides.14 In the specific case of the black sample (Fig. 6c), there is a significant frequency dependence, which indicates that the rudimentary Randles circuit model may be insufficient to describe the complex interface found in this electrode.3 We speculate that this sample may contain a larger density of low-energy surface/trap states, which generate localized levels in the forbidden region of the band gap.47 Moreover, the high aspect ratio of the CuO nanowires on the black sample may introduce a significant double-layer capacitance component, making the calculation of the carrier density difficult. However, the Mott–Schottky results presented in Fig. 6 display a similar trend: the fitted lines have different slopes at different frequencies, but all of the signals converge to the same flat-band potential intercept. Hence, these results yield accurate values for the extrapolation of flat-band conditions and reasonable carrier-concentration trends for the composite materials.3 As mentioned before, the extrapolated flat-band potentials for the black samples are greater than 1 V vs. RHE (1.1 ± 0.1 V vs. RHE), most likely as a result of the top ≈400 nm thick CuO layer at the interface. The obtained Vfb is in reasonable agreement with the values reported in the literature for CuO in contact with alkaline electrolytes.44 Furthermore, this result implies the probable formation of a staggered p–P heterojunction in the black sample (see Fig. S5† for an estimated energy-band diagram based on the above results).
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization of the samples was evaluated in a three-electrode single-compartment cell with a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Fig. 7 presents the PEC current–potential characteristics of the samples under simulated AM 1.5G chopped illumination (Fig. S6†) in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under various pH conditions. The cathodic photocurrents were recorded for all samples and imply that the system exhibits band bending and a p-type nature, which is in agreement with the Mott–Schottky results and is attributed to the photo-assisted redox reactions at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. The onset potentials of the photo-response of the samples at pH 4.9 (Fig. 7a), pH 6.1 (Fig. 7c) and pH 10.1 (Fig. 7e) were estimated via extrapolation to be approximately 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8 V vs. RHE, respectively. Based on the impedance measurements, this trend is consistent with the observed increase in the flat-band potential position with increasing thermal-oxidation treatment. For a p-type photocathode, there is charge depletion at the interface that produces band bending and transports photoexcited electrons to the surface and holes into the bulk, toward the external circuit through the back contact and, finally, to the counter electrode, which drives the oxidation reaction.10 Therefore, the extracted cathodic photocurrents originate from photoexcited electron–hole pairs which are separated by the electric field at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. At pH 10.1 and 6.1, the red and deep red samples exhibited similar responses at potentials close to 0 V vs. RHE (Fig. 7c and e), whereas the black sample outperformed the other samples under all pH conditions. The largest photocurrents at pH 4.9 were recorded for the black and deep red samples, with average values of 1.8 and 1.4 mA cm−2, respectively, under simulated solar illumination at 0 V vs. RHE. It is interesting to note that at pH 10.1, cathodic photocurrents of ≈1 mA cm−2 were observed from the black sample at positive potentials as high as 0.5 V vs. RHE. Based on our electrochemical characterization, negligible Cu redox reactions were detected at this potential (Fig. 5). It is remarkable that in the absence of a cocatalyst (e.g., Pt), the reported photocurrents in the literature were generally found to be only several microamperes per square centimeter at 0.5 V vs. RHE.11–13,41–45 The high crystallinity and intimate ohmic contact with the Cu substrate of Cu2O may play a significant role in the reproducible large photocurrents observed for the deep red and black samples. Although the samples have different thicknesses which may produce higher resistance affecting charge transport, this effect was completely outweighed by other factors as measured photocurrents increase in the order of black > deep red > red sample. We can further attribute this high activity to a highly efficient charge separation induced by the large electric fields generated near the interface, which arise from the high carrier concentrations, as confirmed by the Mott–Schottky calculations.
 Fig. 7  Photoelectrochemical characterizations of red, deep red and black samples under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at pH 4.9 (a and b), pH 6.1 (c and d) and pH 10.1 (e and f). The top row shows the linear-sweep voltammetry under chopped illumination for the monitoring of the dark currents and photocurrents recorded for the Cu-based electrodes (a, c and e in 0.5 M Na2SO4, 10 mV s−1, Ar saturated). The bottom part represents the photoelectrochemical stability tests for the electrodes under 20 s illumination and dark periods at a constant potential of 0.25 V vs. RHE (b, d and f in 0.5 M Na2SO4, Ar saturated). 
The stability of the electrodes was studied in chronoamperometry experiments at a fixed potential of 0.25 V vs. RHE under chopped illumination periods of 20 s, and the results are presented in Fig. 7 for various pH conditions. The initially high photocurrents were lost in less than 1 minute, as previously reported by other groups.8,10,11,46 After 20 minutes of illumination, the samples exhibited stable photocurrents of 0.2, 0.08 and 0.05 mA cm−2 for the black, deep red and red samples, respectively, at both pH 4.9 and 6.1. Although increasing the pH appears to improve the stability of the materials, persistent dark currents were observed for the black electrode at 0.25 V vs. RHE under alkaline conditions (Fig. 7e and f). Based on the photoelectrochemical characterization, it is probable that the photocathodes lost their activity because a significant percentage of the recorded photocurrents originate from the reduction of the Cu oxides on the surface, which are in contact with the electrolyte, as has been suggested in the literature (see Fig. S7†).48 Indeed, in our study we used an airtight single-compartment cell in a three-electrode configuration with online gas chromatography. We were unable to detect hydrogen although the corresponding photocurrents were within our detection limits of H2 (0.1 mA cm−2-equivalent), in agreement with other reports in the literature.8,14,46 It has already been demonstrated in the literature that once Cu2O is protected from the electrolyte interface, the generated photoelectrons are efficiently collected in an energetically well aligned oxide-catalyst layer and hydrogen is produced inhibiting the reduction of the Cu2O (i.e.eqn (1)).8,11 If a large number of the excited carriers generated under illumination are efficiently collected at the interface and selectively react with protons/water, the efficient production of hydrogen using our composite photocathode seems feasible. Surface protection becomes a common strategy for Cu2O and other semiconductor materials that are sensitive for photo-corrosion (i.e. multilayer oxide protection using SiO2, Al2O3, ZnO, NiO, TiO2, etc.).8,11,49–53 A stabilization strategy with a proper water-reduction catalyst similar to the multi-layer protection used recently by Paracchino et al. must be employed to obtain quantitative amounts of hydrogen from the system.8,54
The Cu-based composite materials presented in this work could become versatile energy materials with a wide range of applications. Chronopotentiometry experiments with the samples at −1.67 mA cm−2 using online gas chromatography (μGC) measurements are shown in Fig. 8. In the literature, when a Cu plate was used as the catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2, a large overpotential (i.e., > 1 V vs. RHE) was required for the production of hydrocarbons.55 The red sample is a representative example that exhibits some similarities with the metallic case. When a constant current was applied to a red electrode in a two-compartment three-electrode electrolysis cell (0.1 M KHCO3, CO2 saturated, pH 6.8), a noticeable potential shift was observed during the first three minutes of the experiment (Fig. 8a). During this transition time, the potential changed from 0.2 to −0.85 V vs. RHE. We attributed this change to the reduction of most of the oxide layer. Once the reduction was completed and the potential stabilized, we were able to detect steady rates of hydrogen gas evolution with selectivity greater than 90%. A similar trend was observed for all samples; the steady-state rates of gas generation were detected once the potential reached a stable value. Moreover, it was confirmed via high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) that no liquid products were produced before the potential stabilized (Fig. S8†). The stabilization was achieved after 3, 9 and 120 minutes of galvanostatic experiments for the red, deep red and black samples, respectively, directly correlated with the different oxide thicknesses found in the samples (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the potential reached a relatively stable value of −0.85 V vs. RHE for the red samples (Fig. 8a), −0.7 V vs. RHE for the deep red (Fig. 8b) and −0.6 V vs. RHE for the black (Fig. 8c); the latter exhibited a considerable 250 mV shift in the overpotential required for the more selective reduction of CO2 with respect to the red electrode (i.e., metallic-Cu behavior). A significant generation of CO was detected for the deep red and black samples. As the oxidizing thermal treatment increased, the selectivity for CO2 reduction over H2 production increased. The deep red sample exhibited 75% selectivity for generating H2 while forming CO with 10% selectivity. The black sample exhibited 60% selectivity for CO2 reduction under constant-current conditions (−1.67 mA cm−2) with a recorded potential of −0.6 V vs. RHE. We further confirmed that when the temperature of the thermal treatment was held constant at 773 K and the treatment time was varied, no impact on the selectivity for carbon monoxide or formic acid was observed at a constant potential of −0.6 V vs. RHE (Table S1†). Based on the above observations, when the thermally oxidized samples are further treated under galvanostatic conditions for different periods of time, the oxide layers are largely reduced, creating new and selective active sites for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 that are stable.

The reduced Cu-based electrodes were characterized after the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. The surfaces of the electrodes were studied via XPS, and the results are presented in Fig. 9a and b. The Cu 2p region clearly indicates a significant difference in comparison with the pristine samples (Fig. 3avs.Fig. 9a). In all samples, the peaks in the XPS Cu 2p spectrum are shifted toward lower binding-energy values, indicating a more reduced state of the Cu species on the surface. The peak maxima are located at 933.0 and 952.9 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. These results indicate the presence of Cu+ and Cu0 on the surfaces of the electrodes. An unambiguous assignment is not possible, therefore, there is a possibility of the existence of Cu2O or some metastable oxide surface species.23 No Cu 2p3/2 signals attributed to CuO were detected; nevertheless, there is a small broad signal in the black sample that appears in the characteristic satellite position assigned to Cu2+ in CuO (i.e., Cu 2p3/2, sat. at 944.6 eV). The O 1s spectrum is presented in Fig. 9b. The peaks are significantly broader than those of the pristine samples because of the clear shift of the peak maxima toward 530.5 eV for the lower-binding-energy O 1s peak. As previously discussed, the second peak located at higher binding energies can be attributed to chemisorbed water or hydroxyl oxygen. Most importantly, it has been reported that the differentiation of copper species may involve the use of the O 1s line position.27 In this case, the shift from 529.9 eV (Fig. 3b) to 530.7 eV (Fig. 9b) can be attributed to the presence of Cu+ in the form of Cu2O and the absence of CuO on the surface.27,29 This result is most likely an indication of the existence of cuprous oxide in the vicinity of metallic copper on the surface after the electrocatalytic reaction under highly reducing conditions.

To clarify the extent of the reduction, bulk XRD diffractograms were obtained from the reduced samples, and the results are presented in Fig. 9c. In contrast to the pristine samples, only Cu-metal diffractions were detected for the red and deep red samples, which is a possible indication of the consumption of the Cu2O layer to produce Cu0. Interestingly, the (111) and (220) Cu2O diffractions remained in the black sample after the galvanostatic experiment. The Cu2O diffractions in the black sample became smaller and broader after the electrochemical-reduction step, but the signals were not completely lost as in the case of the red and deep red samples, most likely because of the thicker and passivated Cu2O/CuO/Cu(OH)2 structure.
The morphology of the reduced Cu-based electrodes was studied via SEM, and the micrographs are shown in Fig. 10. The formation of nanoparticles (<10 nm) on the surfaces of the composite materials is observed for the red, deep red and black samples. The original texture and morphology of the pristine samples are mostly intact, but it is possible to observe increased surface roughness. The aggregates observed in the red sample decreased in size (compare Fig. 1d with 10a and S1a with S9a†), and smaller nanoparticles are homogenously distributed on the surface (see Fig. S9b†). A similar observation can be made for the deep red sample, where nanoparticles are clearly observed on the surfaces of the grains (Fig. 9b) and the surface area seems to be higher because of the decrease in the secondary-particle size (compare Fig. S1c with S9c and examine the details in S1d and S9d†). The nanowires on the surfaces of the black samples are mostly covered by nanoparticles of various sizes (Fig. 10c). The nanoparticles aggregated on the surfaces of the wires into larger particles while preserving the morphology, although with a small increase in the diameter of the nanowires (compare Fig. S1f and S9f†). It follows that after the electrochemical reduction of CO2, the surfaces of the oxides in contact with the electrolytes were gradually reduced and formed Cu nanoparticles homogeneously distributed on the surfaces of the electrodes, as confirmed by the XPS, XRD and SEM results. Impedance spectroscopy revealed a significant decrease in the charge-transfer resistance of the samples after the galvanostatic step, most likely an indication of the metallic state at the interface (compare Fig. S3a and S3b†).

Based on these observations, different Cu2O thicknesses were obtained depending on the thermal-oxidation treatment. As the oxidizing treatment increased, a CuO layer and nanowires formed on the outer layer of the electrode and most likely functioned as a passivation layer. During the galvanostatic experiment, when the surface was activated for CO2 reduction, CuO may have first reduced to Cu2O,37 while Cu nanoparticles simultaneously formed on the surface, changing the solid–liquid interface. Moreover, once the metallic nanoparticles homogeneously covered most of the surface, the Cu2O-electrolyte interface required for the reduction reaction was lost (eqn (1)). It has been reported that an overpotential as high as −1.3 V relative to the Cu/Cu2O reversible potential is required to completely reduce the oxide to metallic Cu in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3.56 After the electrocatalytic test, bulk and surface characterization of the black sample indicated the incomplete reduction of the underlying Cu2O layer. Recent DFT calculations have shown the beneficial effect of oxygen impurities at the subsurface of Cu(111) improving the binding ability of CO2 to the altered copper surfaces.57 Based on the results, a certain threshold oxide thickness along with the CuO passivation layer may be required for the stabilization of such sites that are selectively active for CO2 reduction. The coexistence of the metallic Cu state with Cu+ cannot be ruled out for the reason of improved CO2 reduction as demonstrated in this work.
Conclusions
We presented the use of a facile, versatile and scalable synthesis process to obtain copper oxide materials along with two different applications for solar fuel generation. First, we confirmed, using electrochemical methods, XRD, XPS, UV-Vis and SEM, the controlled formation of Cu2O of various thicknesses via the careful variation of time and temperature conditions for the thermal oxidation of Cu foils. CuO nanowires can be formed on the surface of the Cu2O under high oxidation temperature. The electrochemical stability and redox properties of the samples were evaluated at pH 7.9. We utilized impedance spectroscopy to estimate the energy-band diagrams and elucidate the semiconductive nature of each sample in contact with the electrolyte. As the treatment temperature increased, the carrier concentration in each sample increased (1018–1019 cm−3). Hence, a large electric field (≈106 V cm−1) was formed at the interface. This electric field was significantly larger than the values previously reported in the literature. With extended thermal-oxidation treatments, a large positive shift in the flat-band potential was observed. The PEC evaluations of the pristine Cu-oxide-based photocathodes resulted in large photocurrents. The black samples produced photocurrents of 1 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V vs. RHE (pH 10.1). Furthermore, the photocurrent onset potential for the black sample was recorded at 0.8 V vs. RHE under alkaline conditions. The outstanding photoactivity of the as-obtained electrodes was attributed to the high crystallinity of the Cu2O layer and the high carrier concentration, which generated a large electric field that provided efficient charge separation at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. It is considered, however, that the photocurrents originate from the reduction of the oxide species at the electrolyte interface, requiring further protection of the surface for effective utilization to photo-induced catalysis. Second, we demonstrated that when the Cu-based-oxide materials were galvanostatically reduced, they can be used as effective electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 at low overpotential with good selectivity. Based on systematic characterization and the electrolysis results, we demonstrated that longer thermal-oxidation treatments lead to thicker Cu2O/CuO layers, which are required to stabilize the active sites for selective CO2 reduction. XRD and XPS spectroscopy provided evidence of the beneficial coexistence of Cu(I) and metallic copper for the selective reduction of CO2.
Experimental
Cu-based electrodes
Cu foils (25 μm in thickness, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were first cut to the desired electrode size (1 × 3 cm) and cleaned for several minutes in 1 M HCl. The electrodes were then rinsed with Milli-Q water and dried. The Cu electrodes were tightly wrapped around glass microscope slides and inserted into a muffle furnace under ambient air conditions for thermal oxidation. This procedure was recently reported to produce non-flaking highly crystalline oxide samples in intimate contact with the Cu substrate.58 The temperature and time of the electrode treatment were varied from 573 to 773 K and from 0.5 to 10 h, respectively. Electrical wires were attached to the backsides of the copper oxide samples, which were abraded to remove the surface oxide and to ensure ohmic, low-resistance contacts. Epoxy was applied to mask all but the active area of the copper oxide surface for further testing. An electrochemical-reduction step was further implemented for the experiments concerning the electrochemical reduction of CO2.
Electrochemistry
All electrochemical and PEC procedures were performed using Milli-Q water (18 MΩ). Sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, ≥99.99%, Aldrich), sodium acetate (CH3COONa, NaOAc, ≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 99.999%, Aldrich) and potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3, ≥99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received to prepare the required electrolytes. All experiments were performed using a research-grade, multi-channel potentiostat (VMP3, BioLogic Science Instruments). A Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All experiments were recorded against this reference electrode, which was calibrated against the RHE. The results were then reported on the RHE scale using E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 V + 0.0591 V*pH.
Cyclic voltammetry
The CV experiments were performed using a regular one-compartment electrochemical cell with a three-electrode configuration. Each Cu-oxide-based sample was used as the working electrode without further modification. During the experiments, it was ensured that only the desired active area was in contact with the electrolyte. The electrical contact was established by polishing one side of the electrode until a clean connection with the Cu underlayer was obtained. The CV results were recorded at 5 mV s−1 (except when noted) using a 0.1 M NaOAc solution (pH 7.9).
Impedance spectroscopy
EIS was performed in the dark using a three-electrode cell and 0.1 M NaOAc (pH 7.9). The pH of the electrolyte was selected based on the Pourbaix diagram of Cu to increase the stability of the system. Moreover, the experimental potential range was selected based on the results obtained from the CV characterization (black lines in Fig. 3) and considering the pH-potential thermodynamics. The samples generated Nyquist plots with characteristic depressed semicircles at fixed potentials, where no faradaic processes were detected over a wide frequency range (0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, Fig. S2†). Thus, a modified Randles equivalent circuit with a constant-phase element was used to electrically approximate the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. The amplitude of the AC signal applied to the system was 10 mV, and the probed frequency range for the Mott–Schottky calculations was 1–100 kHz. Based on the frequency response (Fig. S3†), high frequency values were selected for the Mott–Schottky analysis (1–10 kHz).
Photoelectrochemistry
The characterization of the samples was performed in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 4.9, adjusted with 2 M H2SO4) under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation calibrated to 60 mW cm−2 over the range of 300–800 nm. The CV results were recorded at 10 mV s−1 under defined periods of dark and illuminated conditions. The PEC stability tests were carried out under the same electrolyte conditions (0.5 M Na2SO4, pH 4.9) and at a fixed potential (0.25 V vs. RHE) for 20 minutes with an illumination time of 20 s.
All electrolytes were purged for 30 minutes with Ar (99.9999%) before and during the experiments (i.e., CV, EIS and PEC).
Electrochemical CO2 reduction
The Cu-based electrodes were galvanostatically reduced with a constant current of −5 mA (exposed geometric area: 3 cm2) in a 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte saturated with CO2 (pH 6.8). Chronopotentiometric signals were recorded during the galvanostatic reduction of the electrode. The CO2 electro-reduction experiments were performed in an airtight, two-compartment electrochemical cell. The Pt-wire counter electrode was isolated from the main cell using a ceramic frit, and the same electrolyte was used in both compartments. The cathodic compartment was saturated with CO2 (99.995%) at 5 sccm for 30 minutes before and during the electrolysis runs. The gas mixture was delivered directly to the sampling loop of a gas chromatograph (μGC, T-3000 SRI instruments). Sampling points were collected every 3 minutes, and the gaseous products were analyzed using packed MolSieve 5A and packed HaySep Q columns coupled to thermal conductivity detectors (TCD). Ar (99.9999%) and He (99.9999%) were used as the carrier gases for the analysis. The liquid products (HCOOH and CH3COOH) were analyzed using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent technologies) system equipped with Agilent 1200, 1260 and 1290 Infinity liquid chromatography technology. All experiments were performed at room temperature (298 K) and under atmospheric conditions (101.3 kPa).
