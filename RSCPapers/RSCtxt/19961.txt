    AbstractCharge-transfer processes in single QDs with p-type NiO nanoparticles result in fluorescence intensity and lifetime quenching, suppression of blinking behavior and enhancement of the dot's survival time.
The colloidal semiconductor quantum dot (QD) has been hailed as an important component in the development of next generation solar cells due to its superior photostability and broad absorption band with high extinction coefficients.1 Charge-separation occurring in QD based solar cells can be judiciously controlled and optimized by varying the size of QD and its corresponding bandgap energy. Several studies have been dedicated to understand the dynamics of electron transfer from QDs to n-type semiconductors (e.g., TiO2) at both the ensemble1 and single-molecule2 levels. However, the use of a QD-sensitized p-type metal oxide semiconductor (e.g., NiO) in devices is still lacking. Recently, NiO has been shown to be an efficient hole transporting layer and hole collector in QD based light-emitting devices3 and organic dye-sensitized solar cells.4 In order to design efficient QD/NiO based devices for energy conservation and conversion, it is necessary to have a clearer understanding of the charge-transfer processes occurring between QD and NiO.
Fluorescence blinking, commonly seen in QDs, occurs when an excited dot undergoes a transition to a temporary dark state.5 Blinking leads to abrupt disruptions in light emitting processes and decreases the efficiency of QDs. Several methods including energy transfer to an acceptor (e.g., Ag nanoparticles)6a and addition of chemicals (e.g., β-mercaptoethanol,6b propyl gallate6c) into QD sample solutions have been designed to reduce this behavior. The interplay between radiative relaxation of exciton, ionization that leads to blinking and charge-transfer between dot and NiO is examined here. In this work, a CdSe/ZnS QD with a CdSe core of ∼1.5 nm radius overcoated with ∼4 monoloayers of ZnS shell is used. Experimental details are provided in the Supplementary Information.†
A typical fluorescence intensity trajectory of a single CdSe/ZnS QD on a glass substrate measured in air is shown in Fig. 1a. Rapid intensity fluctuations with long ‘off’ events of duration ≥ the bin-time used (i.e., 20 ms) are observed. The off-time distribution for a collection of blinking QDs, obtained using the threshold method,7 follows a power-law distribution with a power-law exponent of 1.7 (see Supporting Information†). The QD temporarily stops emitting photons when a charge carrier (hole or electron) tunnels from the core to a trap state on the surface or surrounding environment of the QD.5,8 A photo-generated electron–hole pair (exciton) formed in the charged QD can subsequently recombine by a radiationless Auger process and the dot remains dark until fluorescence is restored when the ejected charge tunnels back to the core.
 Fig. 1  Fluorescence intensity time traces of single QDs on (a) a glass substrate and (b and c) a NiO film. The same excitation intensity of I = 280 W cm−2 is used for both the glass and NiO substrates and the bin-time used is 20 ms. 
A positive correlation exists between the fluctuations in the fluorescence intensity and emission lifetime (τ) of the QD in Fig. 1a. The fluorescence decay profile constructed from photons in the maximum intensity range is described using a mono-exponential decay function with τ = 24 ns (Fig. 2a), corresponding to the radiative lifetime of the dot and in agreement with previously reported lifetimes of CdSe/ZnS QDs.9,10 The fluorescence lifetime decreases when a smaller intensity range is used to generate the lifetime decay. Bawendi et al.9 and Mews et al.10 have attributed this behavior to fluctuations in the non-radiative decay pathways of the excited QD to charge traps.
 Fig. 2  (a) Fluorescence decay curves for the QD in Fig. 1a (on glass) and Fig. 1b (on NiO). The former is constructed by using photons found in the maximum-intensity range R. (b) Bleaching time histograms for 130 QDs on a glass substrate (black) and 129 QDs on a NiO film (gray). Only QDs on NiO show survival times >260 s (inset of Fig. 2b). The same excitation intensity of I = 280 W cm−2 is used for both the glass and NiO substrates. 
The effects of NiO on the photophysical properties of CdSe/ZnS QD, measured in air, are investigated by studying single dots deposited onto a NiO nanoparticle film. Fig. 1b and c show typical fluorescence trajectories of single QDs on NiO. The QD displays reduced fluorescence intermittency behavior for a long period of time before undergoing relatively more blinking at the later stage of the intensity trajectory (at ∼70 s and ∼120 s for the QD in Fig. 1b and c, respectively) followed by irreversible bleaching (at 72 s and 140 s for the QD in Fig. 1b and c, respectively). Furthermore, the survival time of QD on NiO is greatly enhanced. The bleaching histograms presented in Fig. 2b show that 81% of the QDs on a glass substrate (or 105 out of 130 dots studied) bleached within 20 s after the start of the experiment, whereas only 30% of the QDs on NiO (or 38 out of 129 dots) did not survive beyond 20 s.
The emission intensity of QDs on NiO (< 5 counts/ms for QDs in Fig. 1b and c) is significantly smaller than the maximum intensity of QD on glass substrates (e.g., ∼60 counts/ms for QD in Fig. 1a). This observation complements the fluorescence lifetime quenching of the QD when in contact with NiO. As shown in Fig. 2a, the lifetime decay of the QD in Fig. 1b is best fitted by a slow decay of 0.9 ns and a fast decay that is shorter than the resolution of the experimental set-up (∼150 ps). The averaged lifetime and maximum emission intensity of single QDs on glass are 15.0 ns and 63.6 counts/ms, respectively, and on NiO are 0.8 ns and 3.3 counts/ms, respectively (see Supporting Information†). Both the averaged lifetime and quantum yield of QDs are reduced by a factor of ∼19 when deposited on NiO.
When a QD is excited, an exciton is created (step 1 in Fig. 3). Since the VB of the QD is located at a lower energy than the VB of the p-type NiO (see Supporting Information†), the hole formed is transferred from the VB of the QD to the VB of NiO (step 2 in Fig. 3). An averaged hole transfer rate of 1.2 × 109 s−1 is calculated using the averaged lifetimes. Clearly, the non-radiative hole injection process (step 2) is faster than the radiative relaxation of the exciton (averaged value of 6.7 × 107 s−1) and results in significant quenching of the QD's fluorescence intensity and emission lifetime. Subsequently, the excited electron in the CB of the QD can either facilitate non-radiative Auger relaxation or recombines with the injected hole in the VB of NiO via a fast electron transfer process (step 3 in Fig. 3). The former gives rise to blinking which is not observed experimentally. We therefore propose that the charged dot is efficiently returned to a neutral state by step 3 resulting in the absence of long-lived ‘off’ states as observed in Fig. 1b and c. This indicates that the rapid electron transfer step 3 occurs in a time scale shorter than the Auger process which typically takes place within a few hundred ps.11 Hole injection from organic dye molecules (e.g., Coumarin 343) to NiO followed by rapid recombination between an excited electron in the dye anion with an injected hole in the semiconductor has recently been reported.4

Recently, Lian et al. observed suppressed blinking dynamics and lifetime quenching of single CdSe/CdS3MLZnCdS2MLZnS2ML core/multishell QDs on n-doped ITO.12 In their system, negatively charged QDs are created when electrons in ITO are transferred to the dots to achieve equilibrium between their Fermi levels. The quenched lifetime is attributed to a reduction in the lifetime of negatively charged T− trions by either Auger relaxation13 or hole transfer to the additional electron in the charged dot or ITO. The authors proposed that blinking is suppressed by removing the VB hole so that dark positively charged CdSe/CdS3MLZnCdS2MLZnS2ML dots are not formed. Mulvaney et al.14a and Hermier et al.14b have shown that positively charged T+ trions created from CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs exhibit dim states, and the latter group has also demonstrated reduced blinking for the emission from CdSe/CdS T+ trions.14b On the other hand, charged CdSe/ZnS QDs have been shown to display negligible emission quantum yields and are considered to be non-fluorescent.5,8,14b Hermier et al. suggested that this is due to the more efficient Auger relaxation process in CdSe/ZnS QD as compared to CdSe/CdS QD.14b Indeed, Orrit and co-workers have observed rapid intensity fluctuations for single CdSe/ZnS QDs on ITO.15 Therefore, in our system, the charged CdSe/ZnS dots (created from steps 1 and 2) are probably non-fluorescent and cannot completely describe the suppressed blinking behavior. The rapid electron injection step 3 is necessary to achieve the non-blinking behavior observed experimentally.
The effects of NiO on the blueing and bleaching behavior of single QDs are investigated next. The time-dependent fluorescence spectra and intensity trajectories of single QDs on a glass substrate were simultaneously recorded as given in Fig. 4a. It is now generally accepted that the observed unidirectional blue shift of the spectra (i.e., blueing effect) is attributable to photo-oxidation of the CdSe core by oxygen in air.16 Upon light excitation, the excited electron of the QD is ejected to traps found in the shell or core–shell interface. O2 diffuses through the shell and reacts with the trapped electron to create reactive O2−. In addition, the remaining hole that is trapped at the core surface facilitates the oxidation of the CdSe surface to CdSeOx (x = 2 or 3) or SeO2. The erosion of the core leads to a reduction in the core size and an eventual blue shift of the QD emission spectrum.16 The blueing effect is also observed as illustrated in Fig. 4b for a single QD on NiO whose blue shift rate (0.1 nm s−1) is slower than that of the QD on glass substrate (0.6 nm s−1 for QD in Fig. 4a, see Supporting Information†). The fast transfer of charge carriers from QD to NiO lowers the probability for charges to be ejected to the QD surface. This leads to a retardation in the photo-oxidation process and a reduction in the blue shift rate for QD on NiO.
 Fig. 4  Time-dependent fluorescence spectra of single QDs on (a) a glass substrate (I = 280 W cm−2) and (b) a NiO film (I = 560 W cm−2). The corresponding fluorescence intensity trajectories of each QD are provided in the top panels (bin-time = 20 ms). 
The late onset of fluctuations in the intensity trajectories of QDs on NiO (Fig. 1b and c and 4b) can be rationalized by considering deep traps located at the CdSe/CdSeOx interface.16a Since the number of these traps increases only after a long period of time due to slow photo-oxidation,17 there is a greater chance for a charge to be ejected from the core and localized at the CdSe/CdSeOx interface during the later stage of photo-excitation. The trapped charge is temporarily confined until it transfers itself back to the core or to NiO. An alternative explanation used to understand the increased blinking behavior involves the redistribution of charges around the dot after several cycles of ionization which leads to a lowering of the tunneling barrier height between a charge carrier and a deep trap found in CdSeOx or the ligand surrounding the dot.16b
A plausible mechanism based on the above model is used to understand the enhanced survival time of QD on NiO. In ambient conditions, deep traps located at the CdSe/CdSeOx interface can act as potential quenching states that permanently trap a charge ejected from the QD (i.e., bleaching).16a Due to slow photo-oxidation of QD on NiO, these trap states become accessible to QD only after several photo-excitation cycles (i.e., enhanced survival time). It is important to note that the exact nature of the quenching states responsible for bleaching remains unclear.
We have demonstrated that an additional efficient relaxation pathway for QD (i.e., charge-transfer to NiO) reduces the probability of fluorescence inactivity, suppresses blinking and prolongs the survival time of the nanocrystal. Further studies are in the process to investigate the photophysical behavior of single QDs on other p-type substrates.
