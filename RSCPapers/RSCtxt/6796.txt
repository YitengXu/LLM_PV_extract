A bulk heterojunction solar cell containing PBDT–CT and PC61BM was found to exhibit a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V and an efficiency of 3.36%.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have the potential advantages of low cost and large-area fabrication on lightweight flexible substrates by solution processing.1 Considerable research efforts have been applied to the development of donor materials for PSCs. Among these donor materials, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been extensively studied, and bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices containing P3HT as an electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron acceptor have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as ∼5%.2 However, the limited light absorption (300–650 nm) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (−5.0 eV) of P3HT undermine its photovoltaic performance. Therefore, conjugated polymer materials with low band-gaps and deep HOMO energy levels are needed to achieve high open circuit voltages (Voc) and to harvest photons over a wide range of wavelengths. A powerful concept for the design of low band-gap polymers is the donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating copolymer. This alternation enables the facile tuning of the band-gap, absorption spectrum and HOMO–LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels of copolymers by varying the donor and acceptor units.3
Numerous donor units and acceptor units have been used in the synthesis of efficient D–A copolymer materials.4 Of these D–A copolymers, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (BDT)-based copolymers have received much interest because of their exceptional performance, PCEs which are among the highest reported.5
In this study, we sought to synthesize the 3-alkoxy-4-cyanothiophene (CT) dimer as a new acceptor unit for D–A copolymers. The combination of the electron-donating alkoxy (OR) and electron-withdrawing cyano (CN) groups in the same thiophene unit has been reported to be an effective chemical approach to narrowing the band-gap of conjugated polymers.6 Moreover, the electron-withdrawing CN group lowers both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels with respect to those of analogues without CN groups.7 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of conjugated polymers are important factors regarding their use in PSCs, because Voc is strongly related to the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor. However, despite the promise of the CT dimer as an acceptor unit, its use in D–A copolymers has not previously been studied.
A novel low band-gap D–A copolymer (PBDT–CT) containing the BDT donor unit and 3-alkoxy-4-cyanothiophene (CT) dimer acceptor unit was synthesized by using the Stille coupling reaction. PBDT–CT has a low band-gap (1.73 eV) and a deep HOMO energy level (−5.5 eV), which are two important prerequisites for high photovoltaic performance. The CT dimer was found to act as a strong acceptor. The synthesis, characterization and photovoltaic properties of PBDT–CT were investigated.
The synthetic route for PBDT–CT is shown in Scheme 1. The commercially available 4-cyano-3-oxotetrahydrothiophene was treated with dodecylmethanesulfonate in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of Cs2CO3, acting as the base, and then this mixture was irradiated for 5 min in a microwave oven to give the O-alkylated compound 2 at a yield of 75%. The aromatization of compound 2 with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) afforded compound 3 at a yield of 76%. The ring bromination of compound 3 with one equiv. of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) selectively occurs at the 2-position rather than the 5-position to yield compound 4.8 The palladium-catalyzed homocoupling of compound 4 in the presence of silver(I) fluoride at 60 °C in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) gave a 57% yield of compound 5. The donor monomer 6 was synthesized according to an established procedure.4b Finally, the Stille coupling reaction of monomer 6 and compound 5 was carried out using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in anhydrous toluene–DMF to afford a blue-black solid. The resulting solid was carefully purified through sequential Soxhlet extractions using methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was concentrated and poured into methanol to afford PBDT–CT at a yield of 89%. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds and the polymer were confirmed with NMR spectroscopy. The detailed synthetic procedure and characterization of the intermediates and products can be found in the ESI.† PBDT–CT exhibits good solubility in chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The number average molecular weight (Mn) and weight average molecular weight (Mw) of PBDT–CT were found to be 54 kg mol−1 and 152 kg mol−1 respectively, and its polydispersity index (PDI) was found to be 2.81 by using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene standards in chloroform at 40 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that PBDT–CT has excellent thermal stability with a thermal decomposition temperature (Td, at 5% weight loss) of 332 °C under nitrogen. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed no endothermic or exothermic behavior between 30 °C and 250 °C.

Fig. 1 shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the diluted PBDT–CT solution in chloroform and as a film on a glass substrate. The PBDT–CT solution has a broad absorption spectrum in the wavelength range 300–700 nm, with an absorption maximum at 633 nm. The absorption spectrum of the thin film is similar to that of the solution. The optical band-gap calculated from the absorption edge of the polymer film is 1.73 eV. This low band-gap arises because the CT dimer acts as a strong acceptor.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDT–CT are crucial to its application as a photovoltaic material, and can be determined from the onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials obtained by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode). The onset oxidation potential (Eox) is 0.70 V and the onset reduction potential (Ered) is −1.25 V, with ferrocene as the reference (Fig. S4, ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDT–CT are −5.5 eV and −3.55 eV respectively, as calculated from Eox and Ered, according to the reported equations.9 The HOMO energy level of PBDT–CT is significantly deeper than those of most conjugated polymer donor materials. This deeper HOMO level implies that PBDT–CT is more stable with respect to oxidation, which enhances the device stability. Moreover, the deeper HOMO energy level results in PSCs with a higher Voc.
We investigated the photovoltaic properties of various PBDT–CT/PC61BM combinations under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated with two types of structures: a conventional structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al and an inverted structure of glass/ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. Firstly, CB and DCB were used to prepare solutions of the active layer for spin-coating, and it was found that the device fabricated from the CB solution exhibited better performance than the device fabricated from the DCB solution. Subsequently, devices containing various D/A (PBDT–CT/PC61BM) ratios, from 1:0.5 to 1:4, were investigated, and the device with a ratio of 1:2 was found to exhibit the highest performance. The device with a D/A ratio of 1:2 was further optimized by using 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) as an additive and with thermal annealing at 70 °C for 20 min. We expected that the addition of a small amount of DIO could enhance the interpenetrating nanoscale morphology and crystallization of PBDT–CT, and thereby improve the photovoltaic performance.15
The molecular ordering of PBDT–CT was characterized by performing grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) (Fig. S5, ESI†). The XRD patterns of PBDT–CT show that it has a (100) crystal plane orientation. The pristine PBDT–CT film and the PBDT–CT/PC61BM blend film cast from CB with the DIO additive, produce distinct (100) diffraction peaks at around 2θ = 2.7°. The d-spacing of the (100) plane is approximately 22.7 Å.
Charge carrier mobility is another important parameter for conjugated polymers. The hole mobility of the PBDT–CT/PC61BM blend (w/w, 1:2) was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method based on the field-dependent Poole–Frenkel Law10 for an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDT–CT:PC61BM/Pd device structure, and a hole mobility of 1.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained. Moreover, the field effect hole mobility of the pristine PBDT–CT film with thermal annealing was investigated, and a hole mobility of 2.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained under optimum conditions (Fig. S6, ESI†).
The J–V curves and the corresponding photovoltaic data are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The Voc of the inverted device was found to be 0.90 V, which is higher than that of the conventional device (0.77 V). This difference could be attributed to the improved energy level alignment at the interface between the PBDT–CT/PC61BM blend layer and the anode in the inverted device. Although the Voc of PSCs is strongly affected by the difference between the HOMO level of the donor material and the LUMO level of the acceptor material, it can be also affected by the energy barrier at the interface between the active layer and the electrode.11 The MoO3 anode buffer layer in the inverted device has a higher work function (−5.4 eV) than the PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer in the conventional device (−5.0 eV). PBDT–CT has a deep HOMO level of −5.5 eV, so the valence band edge of MoO3 can form a nearly ohmic contact with the HOMO level of PBDT–CT, which minimizes the energy loss during hole-collection from PBDT–CT to the anode.

The inverted device exhibits a higher fill factor (FF) (0.67) than the conventional device (0.42). In principle, the FF can be influenced by non-zero series resistance and finite parallel resistance.12 The inverted device has a lower series resistance (11.3 Ω cm2) and a higher parallel resistance (1644 Ω cm2) than the conventional device, which leads to its higher FF. This difference is probably due to the efficient hole-blocking properties of MoO3 and the nearly ohmic contact at the interface between PBDT–CT and MoO3.16 It is also possible that the difference between the FF values of the conventional and inverted devices is a result of vertical phase separation.13 The vertical phase separation of spin-coated polymer:PC61BM blends can occur due to differences between the surface energies of the components and between their interactions with the substrates. The enrichment of the concentrations of PBDT–CT (the electron donor) adjacent to the anode and of PC61BM (the electron acceptor) near the cathode can be expected to improve the FF.13
On the other hand, the Jsc value of the inverted device is slightly lower than that of the conventional device. This difference could be due to the higher dark current of the conventional device (Fig. S9, ESI†). A higher dark current can increase the Jsc but reduce the Voc and FF. A Schottky barrier could have formed at the interface between PEDOT:PSS and PBDT–CT due to the non-ohmic contact, which reduces the internal field across the device.14Fig. 2b shows external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots for the two photovoltaic devices under monochromatic light illumination. The shapes of the EQE curves of these devices are similar, but the conventional device exhibits higher EQE values than the inverted device. The difference between the EQE values is consistent with the difference in the Jsc values. The inverted device exhibits a lower Jsc than the conventional device, but a much higher Voc and FF. As a result, the PCE of the inverted device is 3.36%, which is higher than that of the conventional device (2.32%).
In conclusion, a new acceptor unit, the 3-alkoxy-4-cyanothiophene (CT) dimer-based low band-gap polymer (PBDT–CT) was successfully synthesized. The polymer has a low band-gap (1.73 eV) and a deep HOMO energy level (−5.5 eV). The photovoltaic properties of the PBDT–CT/PC61BM blends were investigated by comparing conventional and inverted devices. As a result, a high Voc of 0.90 V, a FF of 0.67 and a PCE of 3.36% were achieved in the inverted photovoltaic device. We conclude that the synthesized CT dimer is a promising acceptor unit for PSCs.
