    , Accepted 22nd December 2017First published on 22nd December 2017AbstractThe complexes (R = Me, Et, Bu; X = H, SMe) exhibit well-defined multi-exponential emissions (2–4 components) in the solid state at 77 and 298 K and in 2MeTHF glasses at 77 K due to multiple frozen conformers exhibiting variable dihedral angles formed by the PtP2C2 and C6H4 planes. The demonstration was made using X-ray crystallography at various temperatures where different sites are present in the samples, and using geometry optimization (DFT computations) where various stable conformers are noted.
The trans-bis(phenylacetylenyl)bis(trialkylphosphine)platinum(II) complexes ([Pt], alkyl = Me, Et, Bu) and their derivatives were first reported in late 1950's.1 Their properties were reviewed in detail2 and their applications in liquid crystals,3 non-linear optics (including up conversion, two-photon absorption, and optical power limiting),4 light emitting diodes5 and solar cells6 were reported. For the latter two applications, excited state dynamics play a determining role in the resulting performance of the devices. In this respect, the role of C–H and C–C stretching modes in the intrinsic non-radiative decay of triplet states was recently pointed out by Khöler et al.7 and yet, multiple emission lifetimes, τe's, are occasionally reported. For instance, Cooper et al. prepared two complexes with R = n-C8H17 and XH and CCC6H5 (referring to Fig. 1) as viscous liquids at 298 K.8 The latter complex exhibits two triplet lifetimes, 12 ns and 1.2 μs. The shorter component was attributed to the presence of residual oxygen in the sample. At first glance, this interpretation is somewhat odd since O2-quenching is usually diffusion-controlled. Similarly, our group found that the emission decay of Me-SMe (Fig. 1) in 2MeTHF at 77 K, where no O2-quenching is possible, is biphasic and unexplained.9 Moreover, the use of bulky pentiptycene groups led to [Pt] species showing two τe's, which were interpreted by the presence of two conformers where the dihedral angles were formed by the PtP2C2 and C6H4 planes (θ1 and θ2 are ∼90 or 180°).10 The reported τe's for these Pt-chromophores in rigid media are scarce compared to those for fluid solutions, and when they are measured, they are mainly reported as mono-exponential decays.11 We now report that multiexponential decays are, in fact, entirely expected, particularly in viscous and rigid media. Up to four components are often noted in the decays for samples in the solid state and glasses at 77 K. This feature stems from the presence of multiple quasi-iso-energetic conformers of various θ1 and θ2's deduced from a literature survey of X-ray data and geometry optimizations (DFT; B3LYP).
 Fig. 1  Structures of the studied complexes and their dihedral angles. 
This feature has an impact on the overall excited state dynamics since a large fraction of these trapped conformers exhibit their own photophysical properties including significantly shorter τe values.
The X-ray data for Me-H (θ1 = 31.6, θ2 = 38.4°; ESI†) and Bu-H (θ1 = 40.6, θ2 = 67.5°; Fig. 2) were obtained for the first time and unveils two independent molecules per unit cell at 100 and 172 K (note that θ1 and θ2 are quasi-temperature independent). Although the bond distances are normal, they differ by θ1 and θ2. The solid state electronic spectra and emission decays for Bu-H are shown in Fig. 3, as a representative example (see the ESI† for all the solid state and solution data at 298 and 77 K). This weak emission is reminiscent of that in solution.12 The optimized geometry (DFT) of Me-H in its T1 state (vide infra) exhibits a planar geometry (ESI†) and the predicted peak position of the triplet emission is found to be at 443 nm using the difference between the S0 and T1 total energies. This value compares favourably with the experimental data (Fig. 3). The presence of a biphasic decay for Me-H (single crystal) corroborates with that reported for 1 by Cooper et al.,8 and Me-SMe reported by Juvenal et al.9 and its crystal structure gives the first clue as what causes the well-defined biexponential T1 emission decays (no efficient T1–T1 annihilation was noted as the τe's are independent of excitation source intensity). However, a tri-exponential decay is noted for Bu-H (single crystal). Similarly, the X-ray structures of Me-SMe9 and Et-SMe13 show respectively ½ and 1 asymmetric molecule per unit cell, and yet the decays are clearly multi-exponential. In fact, all 5 species exhibit between 2 and 3 components for the emission decays for single crystals (Table 1). A literature search on the X-ray data for [Pt] species and analogues (R = Me, Et, Bu) indicates multiple conformers with very different θ1 and θ2 values (ESI†). Out of 37 entries, 4 examples exhibit drastically different dihedral angles (θ1 ≠ θ2), 6 show angles that are a bit different (|θ1 − θ2| < 13°), and the remaining present nearly identical or identical ones (θ1 = θ2). For these last 27 entries, θ1 and θ2 vary randomly from 6 to 89°. One concludes that the barrier to rotation about the Pt–C bonds must be very small in order to have the resulting angles strongly dictated by crystal packing. This conclusion is consistent with the recent findings reporting DFT calculations revealing facile Pt–C rotations between the two CCC6H4X units.14 Indeed, quasi-free rotations (<2 kJ mol−1, vide infra) were reported.10 Clearly, solid state packing influences the θ1vs. θ2 values, and occasionally, θ3, and importantly for this work traps these conformers.

Again multi-exponential decays are observed even for cases where the single crystal structures exhibit only one species (θ1 = θ2, Et-H,15Me-SMe9 and Et-SMe13). A part of the explanation stems from the comparison of the longest τe values (Table 1, powder data; Me-H, Me-SMe > Et-H, Et-SMe > Bu-H). This trend is due to nonradiative processes that the aromatic groups undergo in their specific crystal sites. As the alkyl chains get longer, the probability of molecular motions, mainly PR3 groups colliding with neighbours, increases meaning that the excited state deactivation increases as well and consequently τe decreases. This is obvious for Bu-H where the butyl groups are in contact with its own complex and its neighbour (Fig. 1). These intermolecular interaction effects on τe are further shown when comparing the relative amplitude of the shortest-lived τe (f%; see definition in Table 2) for Me-H and Et-H with those for Me-SMe and Et-SMe, respectively, as the presence of SMe groups induces additional non-radiative processes.

The τe's are concentration independent, thus excluding the possibility of T1–T1 annihilation.

Based on the fact that each species (or site) has its own τe value, Me-H (θ1 = θ2 = 31.7° and θ1 = θ2 = 38.5°), Bu-H (θ1 = θ2 = 40.7° and θ1 = θ2 = 67.5°) and Et-SMe (θ1 = 72.9° and θ2 = 74.4°)13 are bound to exhibit at least two τe's as the CCC6H4X's chemical environments differ (note that Me-H, Bu-H, and Et-SMe exhibit 2, 2 × ½, and 1 asymmetric molecules per unit cell, respectively). However, this feature does not explain the unexpected additional components in the emission decays. A comparison of the X-ray powder diffraction patterns with the calculated ones from the single crystal X-ray data shows broader diffraction peaks (ESI†). Although the thickness of the calculated diffraction peaks can be adjusted manually, the experimental widths still indicate disorder.
The concept of disorder contributing to the increase in the width of the diffraction peaks in these systems is well demonstrated with Bu-H. Indeed, its X-ray structure reveals static disorder in some of the butyl chains. This situation would first explain the larger width of the diffraction peaks, and also the presence of weak components in the emission decays as other sites exist in the crystals. This disorder may be undetected by crystallography as the residual of the X-ray structure can often reach 5%, generally speaking. Again, the latter situation would explain the presence of weaker components in the decays. This point is demonstrated by measuring τe directly for the crystals. For Me-H, the τe's (single crystals) are 1.6 (16.2) and 7.2 μs (83.8%) (χ2 = 1.022) meaning that the longer-lived component is absent. Moreover, one significant difference between the powder and single crystals is the surface/bulk ratio. The sites at the surface and in the bulk are different and so the emission decays are also prone to be different from each other, and are detected with a different signature decay. One concludes that the powder obtained directly from the reaction contains more species than what the X-ray structure indicates, and segregation occurs upon crystallization. Again, the conformers are “frozen” in the solid state and the molecular reorganisation is precluded. This situation leads to well-defined non-planar conformers independently emitting with their own photophysical traits. Table 1 reflects this behaviour well.
One question arises: can one observe a large number of conformers in glasses at 77 K where the crystal packing effect is absent? The answer is no as all the complexes exhibit well-defined exponential decays as well (see Fig. 3, bottom, for a typical example and the ESI† for the remaining data). In all cases, one (see Fig. 3; right) or two dominant components are noted, and the ESM analysis does not show any significant population distribution of the τe's. In conclusion, θ1 and θ2 change upon slow cooling towards the deepest wells of their energy map and the increase in viscosity upon cooling reduces and eventually precludes the hopping from one site to another. Similarly, Lindgren and collaborators observed a bi-exponential decay for a [Pt] species placed in a PMMA matrix.16 A similar process is suspected to take place when the polymer is drying. An attempt to unveil the possible conformers in the ground state (S0) geometry optimizations was made. Four quasi-iso-energetic conformers were identified (vide infra, Table 3). It is not possible to assign one species to a given lifetime, but these computations confirm their existence, and can explain the dual lifetime observed even in the PMMA matrix. The atomic contributions of the frontier MOs are similar to each other, which is consistent with the quasi-iso-energetic situation of these four conformers. TDDFT computations place the 0–0 fluorescence peaks at two positions: 319 nm for the 90° and 90°-twisted conformers, and 334 nm for the 45° and 45°-twisted conformers. No singlet emission was detected in these rigid media but the outcome from these calculations is that the peak position may reveal the nature of a possible conformer. Indeed, time-resolved spectroscopy (TRES) permitted to observe emissions with a constant triplet 0–0 peak position (Fig. 4). The X-ray structure for Me-H reveals two different molecules (θ1 = θ2 = 31.7° and θ1 = θ2 = 38.5°), which can be attributed to the 45°-conformer, the most stable conformer. As powder, another minor component appears in the Me-H decays (14–16 μs) compared to the crystal data and yet, the position of the 0–0 peak remains the same. This suggests that a conformer belonging to the category 45°-twisted is present.

 Fig. 4  TRES of Me-H and Et-H (delay time in μs). 
Interestingly, the fact that the τe values, on average, are larger in 2MeTHF glasses (Table 2) vs. powder at 77 K (ESI†), strongly support the idea that specific sites exist in the solid state where the closely packed neighbours contribute more efficiently to the non-radiative deactivation processes (i.e. though knockings), in comparison with the 2MeTHF amorphous glasses.
In conclusion, the [Pt] chromophore, known as a “workhorse” of luminescent organometallic materials, exhibits multi-exponential decays in rigid media and its triplet excited state dynamics have been confidently addressed for the first time. This behaviour is due to well-defined trapped conformers defined by the crystal sites (if inside a crystal) or by one of the quasi-iso-energetic conformers in the ground state trapped in a glassy medium. This brings about questions on reports stating the presence of only one component.
Based on the relative intensity of some of the components, see for example Me-H and Bu-H in Table 2, it is likely that only the largest component was reported. Moreover, in the situations where the [Pt] unit is part of a polymer,11 it is also possible that the reduced chain flexibility in the amorphous solid state makes the dihedral angles adopt many values and the emission decay is essentially an average.
In relevance with this work, the trans-Pt(PBu3)2 synthons have also been used for the design of solar cells (all types),6 but the power conversion efficiency (PCE) turns out to be highly variable (5.78,17a 2.37,17b 1.46,17c 0.88%;17d list not exhaustive).18 Besides the morphology parameter, excited state lifetimes, here dictated by the conformation and the chain length of the soluble groups, may also play a role if the charge separation stems from this [Pt]-synthon in its T1 state. This work reveals that the triplet state lifetimes may be one to two orders of magnitude shorter than that what may be expected (see Tables 1 and 2, and ESI†), thus reducing the probability of electron transfer, and consequently PCE.
