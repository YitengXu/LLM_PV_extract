    , Accepted 20th January 2016First published on 22nd January 2016AbstractA pure inorganic donor–acceptor (D–A) type polyoxometalate K6H4[α-SiW9O37Co3(H2O)3]·17H2O (SiW9Co3)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposite was employed to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for the first time, building up a wide spectrum for the photoanode of a DSSC. Raman, XRD, TEM, and EDS have proved that SiW9Co3 was loaded on RGO, and then the SiW9Co3/RGO doped nanocomposite in P25 was applied to be the photoanode of the DSSCs. In this paper the performance of SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25 is the best. The Jsc of pure P25 is 13.74 mA cm−2, Voc is 0.679 V, FF is 0.598 and η is 5.37%, while the Jsc of SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25 is 17.5 mA cm−2, Voc is 0.705 V, FF is 0.558 and η is enhanced to 6.88%, which is 28.05% higher than for a pure P25-based cell in a DSSC. OCVD indicates that SiW9Co3/RGO can delay the electron–hole recombination. In a Bode plot the electron lifetimes of SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25 and P25 are 4.86 ms and 3.81 ms respectively, which also further clarifies that the SiW9Co3/RGO doped nanocomposite can extend the lifetime of electrons and also plays an important role in the photoanode of the DSSCs. This result is beneficial to the application of DSSCs in future industry.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have always drawn a great deal of interest owing to their low cost, environmentally friendly properties and high power conversion efficiency.1 The main components of a DSSC are the dye-sensitized semiconductor photoanode, an electrolyte with a redox couple, and a counter electrode. The photoanode is one of the main factors affecting the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs owing to its influence on the adsorption quantity of dye and the electron transport. Electrons can be injected into the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor when light excites the sensitizer,2,3 but not all of the electrons are transferred to the external circuit, some are returned to the dye or electrolyte. So accelerating electron transfer and retarding electron recombination is a very urgent problem in the field of DSSCs.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), as anionic metal-oxygen clusters, have attracted intensive attention because of their chemical, structural, and electronic versatility, and also have a large range of applications in many fields, such as catalysis, medicine, magnetism and so on.4–9 POMs can accept a limited number of electrons, representing a reversible redox process without any structural changes.10 Recently, POMs have been widely used in DSSCs owing to their electronic versatility.11–13 Nevertheless, transition-metal-trisubstituted POMs have been proposed with D–A structures in theory, which could be used for electronic transmission.14 In addition, the absorption spectra of D–A type POMs can cover the whole of the UV and visible regions,15 which are more conducive to improving the utilization of sunlight.
Graphene, a two-dimensional material with sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, has gained extensive attention due to its high surface area, and thermal, optical, and electronic properties.16,17 More importantly, graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor.18 All of these properties make it an ideal candidate in many fields, such as fuel cells, solar cells and so on.19–21 Therefore, on the basis of the above unique properties of POMs and graphene, POM/graphene nanocomposites may be applied in DSSCs, and may be an effective material for accelerating electron transfer and retarding electron recombination in the cell.
SiW11V has been used to make a SiW11V/graphene nanocomposite, which was used for photocurrent responses. It is obvious that the photocurrent responses of the nanocomposite are higher than for pure P25.22 So we have tried to further study the influence of a nanocomposite in the photoanode of DSSCs. The trisubstituted POM SiW9Co3 has been confirmed to have a D–A type structure, which has a smaller band gap and a lower LUMO level compared to TiO2.23,24 Furthermore, SiW9Co3 has a wide spectrum to absorb visible light (Fig. S1†). The UV/vis reflection spectrum of P25 in the solid state is shown in Fig. S2,† which also shows that P25 plays a major role in the ultraviolet region. Here, we prepared reduced graphene oxide (RGO) by using L-ascorbic acid to reduce SiW9Co3 to obtain heteropoly blue, which was used to reduce GO, and we finally got the product SiW9Co3/RGO nanocomposite. This SiW9Co3/RGO nanocomposite was used in the photoanode of DSSCs and the performance of the cells was improved by 28.05% compared to the P25 photoanode. However, this work is different from prior work. Firstly, the SiW11V/graphene nanocomposite was used to investigate the photocurrent responses of the film in the prior work, but in this work the SiW9Co3/RGO nanocomposite was used in the photoanode of DSSCs, which is a deep extension of prior work into photovoltaic devices. Secondly, the energy levels of SiW11V and SiW9Co3 are different compared to TiO2. The LUMO of SiW11V is higher than in graphene, but lower than in TiO2, which is between graphene and TiO2. SiW11V can act as both an electron acceptor and donor to transfer electrons from TiO2. While the LUMO of SiW9Co3 is higher than in TiO2, which is between TiO2 and N719. SiW9Co3 can serve as an electron acceptor and donor to transfer electrons from N719.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and methods
SiW9Co3 and GO were prepared according to the literature method and characterized using FTIR spectroscopy.25,26 The IR spectra were recorded using KBr pellets on a Bruker AXS TENSOR-27 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed using a Perkin-Elmer TGA instrument under N2 flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed using a FEI Quanta 200F microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were carried out on a JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. XPS was performed on F-doped SnO2 glass using an ESCALAB-MKΠ photoelectronic spectrometer with a Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) achromatic X-ray source. X-ray powder diffraction data was collected using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in a 2θ range of 5–90° with a step size of 0.02°. A 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500 W, Global xenon lamp power) and a double-prism monochromator (Hilger and Watts, D300) provided monochromatic light. The construction of the photovoltaic cell was a sandwich-like structure of ITO–sample–ITO.
2.2 Synthesis of RGO
RGO was synthesized following a modified version of the method in the literature.27 In short, as-prepared GO (2 mg) was dispersed in water (15 mL) under stirring and was put under sonication for 1 h at room temperature. Then 13 mg of L-ascorbic acid was added to the aqueous dispersion, and the mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. The resulting material was filtered off, washed with water and ethanol and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h. The resultant material was labeled RGO.
2.3 Synthesis of polyoxometalate/graphene hybrid material
As-prepared GO (2 mg) was dispersed in water (15 mL) under stirring and put under sonication for 1 h at room temperature. 10 mg of SiW9Co3 was dissolved in 4 mL of water by stirring to form a light red solution. At room temperature, 13 mg of L-ascorbic acid and 5 mg of zinc powder were simultaneously added to the SiW9Co3 solution under stirring, and the solution colour changed from light red to dark blue. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 3 min, and the heteropoly blue solution was dropped into the GO aqueous dispersion under stirring. The obtained suspension was further stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Then the mixture was filtered off, washed with water and ethanol and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h. The resultant material was labeled SiW9Co3/RGO-1. The synthesis processes for SiW9Co3/RGO-2, SiW9Co3/RGO-3 and SiW9Co3/RGO-4 were similar to SiW9Co3/RGO-1, except that 20 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg of SiW9Co3 were used, respectively.
2.4 Preparation of SiW9Co3/RGO-n@P25 films
Firstly, the SiW9Co3/RGO-n was re-dispersed in 10 mL of acetone and sonicated for 1 h. 0.05 g of pristine Degussa P25 was slowly added to the suspension while stirring and sonicated for 5 min, producing a blue precipitate. The blue precipitate was dried at room temperature, and the obtained powder was mixed with 0.25 g of pure P25. Then a SiW9Co3/RGO-n@P25 paste was prepared according to the literature.
2.5 Solar cell fabrication
FTO conductive glass was ultrasonically cleaned with a detergent solution, isopropanol, and ethanol successively. Firstly, the clean substrate was coated with TiO2 paste, SiW9Co3/RGO-n@P25 and pure P25 by screen printing28 and then sintered at 400 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the resulting films were immersed post-treatment in 40 mM TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 70 °C and calcined in air at 400 °C for a further 30 min. When cooled to 80 °C, the calcined film was immersed in N719 ethanol solution for 24 h at room temperature. The excess unanchored dyes were rinsed off with absolute ethanol and dried with N2. Then the dye-adsorbed electrodes were covered with platinum mirrors as counter electrodes. The electrolyte, composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile, was introduced between the electrodes by capillary action.
3. Results and discussion
Graphene oxide (GO), SiW9Co3 and SiW9Co3/RGO nanocomposites were prepared and were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 1 and S3†). Fig. 1 shows the FTIR spectra of SiW9Co3 and the SiW9Co3/RGO nanocomposite. The characteristic vibrations of ν(W–Ot), ν(W–Ob–W), ν(Si–Oa) and ν(W–Oc–W) in SiW9Co3 appear at 989, 940, 891 and 768 cm−1, respectively. The FTIR spectrum of the SiW9Co3/RGO nanocomposite indicates that the SiW9Co3 has been loaded onto the RGO and that the SiW9Co3 retains its structure in the nanocomposite.

The Raman spectra (Fig. 2a) indicate that the structural changes to the carbon framework occur during the chemical process from GO to RGO. There are two characteristic peaks in the Raman spectrum of raw graphite, which are the D band at 1352 cm−1 and the G band at 1576 cm−1. The D band is ascribed to edges, other defects and disordered carbon, whereas the G band results from the zone center E2g mode, corresponding to ordered sp2-bonded carbon atoms.29 In the Raman spectrum of GO, the G band is broadened and shifted slightly, while the intensity of the D band increases obviously, which may be ascribed to the significant decrease in size of the in-plane sp2 domains due to oxidation. It can be seen from the Raman spectrum of RGO that the intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG ratio) is higher than the ID/IG ratio in the GO spectrum, which indicates that the average size of the sp2 domains is decreased owing to the reduction of the exfoliated GO. All of the results illuminate that GO and RGO were successfully obtained.
 Fig. 2  Raman spectra of raw graphite, GO and RGO (a) and XRD patterns of raw graphite, GO and RGO (b). 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of raw graphite, GO and RGO are shown in Fig. 2b. The raw graphite showed a very strong peak at 2θ = 26.4°, which corresponds to a d-spacing of 3.4 Å. The differences between the raw graphite and GO are the intensity and the broadness of the peak, and a new peak is observed at 2θ = 10.6°, corresponding to an average interlayer spacing of 8.4 Å. The GO sheets are thicker than raw graphite due to the oxygen-containing functional group attached on both sides of the GO.30,31 As for RGO, a broad peak is observed at 2θ = 23.2° with a smaller interlayer spacing of 3.8 Å, indicating that the number of surface oxygen-containing functional groups has decreased greatly. The XRD patterns of SiW9Co3 and SiW9Co3/RGO are shown in Fig. S4,† which indicate that SiW9Co3 clusters are loaded on the RGO.32,33
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also confirms that GO and RGO have been obtained. It could be observed that four types of carbon bonds appeared at 284.6 eV (sp2 C), 286.7 eV (C–O), 287.7 eV (CO) and 288.9 eV (O–CO) in the C 1s XPS spectrum of GO (Fig. 3a). After the reduction of GO, the content of C–O groups decreased, which implied that the reduction can eliminate the oxygen containing groups on GO (Fig. 3b).

Moreover, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) results also indicate that the SiW9Co3 clusters can be found in a dispersed state on the graphene. The RGO shows a crumpled and paper-like nanosheet morphology in Fig. 4a. The SiW9Co3 clusters can be seen clearly as small, dark spots in Fig. 4b, no agglomerates can be detected, and the size of the clusters is around 1–3 nm. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shown in Fig. S5† also proves that the morphology of the RGO looks folded and that the structure is sheet-like. Additionally, the EDS analysis of SiW9Co3/RGO clearly shows C, Si, W and Co, shown in Fig. 4c.

Furthermore, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out to detect the thermal stability of the samples. As shown in Fig. S6,† there is no obvious mass loss in SiW9Co3 from 200 °C to 600 °C, which means that it has good thermal stability. Three weight loss stages can be observed in the TGA curves of GO (Fig. S7a†). The first stage is below 100 °C, corresponding to adsorbed and crystallization water. The second stage is at ca. 200 °C, which is caused by the loss of the labile oxygen groups of GO, such as the carboxyl, anhydride and lactone groups. The final weight loss happened between 500 °C and 600 °C, which is due to the combustion of the carbon skeleton.34 The TGA curve of RGO shows the structural change after reduction, but some oxygen functional groups are still in existence. The total mass loss of SiW9Co3/RGO is lower than that of RGO, which may be caused by the SiW9Co3 assemblies on the RGO.
It has been confirmed that 0.6 wt% GO doped in the photoanode of a DSSC could get a good efficiency.35 So 2 mg of GO was used to prepared the SiW9Co3/RGO nanocomposite, and then the nanocomposite was doped in P25 to make a photoanode film. The performance of the DSSC in Fig. 5 was investigated under a simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 5a, the SiW9Co3/RGO-n nanocomposites which contained different masses of SiW9Co3 doped into the photoanodes, where n represents 1 to 4 corresponding to the masses 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg of SiW9Co3, respectively, exhibited different photoelectric conversion efficiencies. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The average performance of P25 is 5.37%, RGO is 5.73%, and SiW9Co3/RGO-n@P25 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) is 6.36%, 6.21%, 6.88% and 5.4%, respectively.

Cao et al. have demonstrated that the superior electrical conductivity of graphene is often incorporated to improve the total conductivity of anodes, therefore graphene could provide a conductive network in TiO2 anodes for efficient electron transfer kinetics.36,37 Therefore it can be easily explained that the RGO has a great influence on the photoanode, as RGO can improve the electron transfer and the performance of the cell. In addition, because of the above excellent electrical conduction of graphene and because the CB of graphene is between that of FTO and TiO2, graphene bridges were introduced into the photoanode, meaning that the photoinduced electrons can not only transfer quickly but also are suppressed in TiO2 to recombine with the dye and redox species. This result can explain the reason why the performance of the photoanode doped with RGO is higher than the photoanode of pure P25.
Different masses of SiW9Co3 were used to reduce GO, for which the η of the SiW9Co3/RGO-n was diverse. SiW9Co3 was firstly reduced to heteropoly blue and then the GO was reduced by the heteropoly blue to become SiW9Co3/RGO. The performance of the DSSCs containing SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25 is the highest, which may be due to the amount of SiW9Co3 loaded onto the RGO having achieved its optimal value, meaning the performance is the best. The amount of SiW9Co3 in SiW9Co3/RGO-1 and SiW9Co3/RGO-2 does not achieve the optimum, so the performance is lower than for SiW9Co3/RGO-3. The amount of SiW9Co3 in SiW9Co3/RGO-4 exceeds SiW9Co3/RGO-3, but the performance of the cell is lower, which is likely to be due to an excess of POM loaded onto the RGO, resulting in the agglomeration of the POM.13 The other performances of the DSSCs are inferior to the one containing SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25; this may be ascribed to the amount of POM loaded on the RGO. This result can also prove that RGO and D–A type POMs contribute to the improvement of the performance of the cells. SiW9Co3 is inclined to facilitate the charge transfer from N719 to TiO2 and to enhance the electronic injection ability, owing to the LUMO of SiW9Co3 being between the CB of TiO2 and the excited state of N719.
From the above Table 1, the performance of SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25 is the best, but if only SiW9Co3-3 is used in the photoanode of the DSSCs the performance of the cell is not better than with SiW9Co3/RGO-3. Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs containing SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25, P25, and SiW9Co3-3@P25. The η of SiW9Co3-3@P25 is 5.67%, which is higher than for pure P25 and lower than for SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25. This result shows that SiW9Co3 doped in the photoanode of the DSSCs has a promoting effect, while the nanocomposite of SiW9Co3/RGO has a better impact. This also illustrates that RGO doping in the photoanode of the DSSCs can accelerate the performance of the cell. This is consistent with the performance of RGO@P25.

Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was used to monitor the decay of Voc when suddenly turning off the illumination. POMs have been used as electron acceptors in TiO2 photocatalytic systems to enhance the rate of CB electron transfer and to defer fast charge-pair recombination.38 So, SiW9Co3/RGO can also restrain the electron recombination and decay the charge slowly. As shown in Fig. 7, the Voc of SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25 decayed more slowly than that of RGO@P25 and P25, indicating that the carrier recombination rate is the lowest. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the electron lifetime calculated using the equation τ = (kT/e)/(dV/dt)−1, which illustrates that the DSSC containing SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25 has the longest electron lifetime.39

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to illustrate the internal resistances in the DSSCs, which can prove the transfer and suppression of electrons in nanomaterials better. The EIS results were tested under an AM 1.5 solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 at a forward bias of the open-circuit voltage with an ac potential amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. In the Nyquist curve, there are mainly two semicircles from high to low frequency, which are assigned to the charge-transfer resistance at the interface of the counter electrode–electrolyte (Rpt) and the charge-transfer resistance occurring at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface (Rct). It can be seen in Fig. 8a that the Rct of SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25 is the largest compared to those of RGO@P25 and P25, which means that it is beneficial for suppressing charge recombination and improving the efficiency of the charge transfer. This result leads to an efficient transfer in the photoanode. Fig. 8b is a Bode plot. It can be seen that the characteristic frequency peak in the middle frequency area for the SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25 electrode is shifted to a slightly lower frequency compared to those of RGO@P25 and pure P25, the corresponding values are 32.75 Hz, 37.47 Hz and 41.75 Hz respectively. Any shift in the peak from high to low frequency indicates a process of rapid electron transport. Additionally, the electron lifetime can be estimated from the Bode plot according to the formula: τe = (2πfmax)−1, where fmax is the frequency at the top of the intermediate-frequency arc.40,41 The electron lifetimes of SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25, RGO@P25 and pure P25 are 4.86 ms, 4.25 ms and 3.81 ms, respectively. Consequently, SiW9Co3/RGO-3 retards the recombination of electrons better. So the smaller frequency of SiW9Co3/RGO-3@P25 in Fig. 8b corresponds to a longer electron lifetime, which further confirms the result of the OCVD.

Scheme 1 shows the energy levels and electron-transfer processes of the DSSCs. The energy level of graphene is between the CBs of FTO and TiO2. The HOMO and LUMO of SiW9Co3 have already been calculated and confirmed.23 When the light was turned on, the electrons of N719 and SiW9Co3 were excited and transferred to TiO2; then the graphene in the SiW9Co3/RGO@TiO2 film could transport the photoinduced electrons quickly and suppress the electron recombination, because SiW9Co3 has an appropriate band gap and a wide UV spectrum, which make SiW9Co3 not only act as the electron donor, but also serve as the electron acceptor. So the performance of the cell is largely dependent on the SiW9Co3 clusters on the graphene, which also means that the wide spectrum of the D–A type POM can improve the performance of the DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
In summary, an inorganic D–A type POM compound has been, for the first time, used to prepare a SiW9Co3/RGO nanocomposite, which was introduced into the photoanodes of DSSCs and resulted in the improvement of the photovoltaic performance. This increase in the photovoltaic performance may be ascribed to SiW9Co3 being excitable by nearly the full spectrum and the quick and effective transformation of the photoinduced electrons of SiW9Co3 on the graphene sheets. This work opens new opportunities to develop abundant and potential materials for solar energy, and this method is also fit for other kinds of POMs. Future work will continue to pay attention to fabricating other types of POM nanomaterials and exploring their applications.
