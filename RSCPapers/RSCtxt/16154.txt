    , Accepted 18th August 2017First published on 18th August 2017AbstractPoly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a widely utilized hole-transporting material (HTM) in planar photovoltaic devices, such as organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersions may restrict their future application. Therefore, it is necessary to develop other effective and stable HTMs to achieve high-performance photovoltaic devices. Herein, we demonstrate a facile route to deposit solution-processed MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 thin films as hole-transporting layers by directly dissolving their commercial powders in deionized water. Among these, the solution-processed V2O5 (sV2O5) film exhibited the highest work function of 5.2 eV, and the best hydrophobicity, with a contact angle of 77.2°. The sV2O5-based OSCs and PSCs presented power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8.36% and 14.13%, respectively. Notably, the PEDOT:PSS V2O5 composite HTM based device obtained a maximum PCE of 18.03% with a Voc exceeding 1.0 V. These aqueous-solution-processed HTMs have potential applications in green and low-cost photovoltaic devices by virtue of their simple and ecofriendly preparations.
Introduction
Low-cost and high-performance photovoltaic cells are currently studied to solve the global energy issues.1,2 As representative, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on π-conjugated organic semiconductors have attracted more and more attention because of their advantages, such as light weight, low cost, easy manufacturing process and flexibility.3–5 A revolutionary development in OSCs is the introduction of bulk heterojunctions (BHJ) in the cell, where the donor and acceptor material are blended together.6,7 Since there are continuous pathways from the interface to the respective electrodes through the interfacial layers, the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency is dramatically increased with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 10%.8,9 Recently, organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a lot of attention in the photovoltaic community due to their continuous rise in PCE.10–21 For example, the certified PCE of a single-junction perovskite solar cell reached over 20% recently.19–21
Whether organic solar cells or perovskite solar cells, a planar device structure is always adopted due to its simple fabrication process and availability of low temperature technology.22–26 In a planar structure solar cell, hole- and electron-interfacial layers are always introduced to manipulate the carrier transport and extraction.14,22 Clearly, the film properties of interfacial materials, such as the film conductivity and the energy levels, could significantly affect the device performance of planar structure solar cells. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely employed as a hole-transporting layer (HTL) in planar structure solar cells due to its good film conductivity and solution processibility. However, the acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS may restrict its application in the future.27–29 As a matter of fact, efficient and stable hole interfacial layers are still scarce. Some transition metal oxides (TMOs) could act as HTLs because the hole extraction could be realized efficiently via electron transfer from the conduction band of the TMO to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the active layer.30–32 Recently, solution-processable transition metal oxides (TMOs) such as molybdenum oxide (MoO3),33–35 vanadium oxide (V2O5),36–44 germanium dioxide (GeO2)45 and nickel oxide (NiO)46–48 have been developed to replace PEDOT:PSS in organic electronic devices. Nevertheless, these TMO solutions are prepared by the hydration method using oxide precursors and/or sol–gel based colloidal suspensions with the aid of different organic solvents. This means that the preparation processes for these TMOs are relatively complicated and a high annealing temperature is required along with the use of organic solvents (unfriendly to the environment) during the precursor preparing process.
Herein, we developed a facile route to deposite aqueous-solution-processed TMOs (MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3) interfacial layers by dissolving the commercial TMO powders in deionized water. The sTMOs interfacial layers were fabricated at room temperature and utilized as HTLs in poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl] (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) based organic solar cells and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x based perovskite solar cells. The sTMOs-based devices demonstrated comparable performance with the PEDOT:PSS-based devices. In particular, the sV2O5 film exhibited the highest work function of 5.2 eV and the best hydrophobicity, with a contact angle of 77.2° among the four TMO materials. As a result, the sV2O5 based organic solar cell and perovskite solar cell presented a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.36% and 13.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the composite HTL (by mixing PEDOT:PSS and TMOs) based perovskite solar cells demonstrated a significantly improved PCE and cell stability compared with those pristine PEDOT:PSS based ones. Devices using the optimized composite film (PEDOT:PSS + V2O5) obtained a maximum PCE of 18.03%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.02 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.38 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 79%. The preparation process of MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 aqueous solutions is quite simple and ecofriendly. The developed TMO interfacial materials provide a diversification of hole-transporting materials in planar perovskite solar cells.
Experimental
TMO solution and perovskite solution preparations
MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Industry Co., and the corresponding aqueous solutions were prepared by dissolving their powders (∼50 nm in size) directly in deionized water with stirring for over 24 h in air at room temperature with an optimized concentration of 1 mg ml−1. When preparing the PEDOT:PSS–TMO composite precursors with varied mixing ratios, the concentration of TMO aqueous solution was maintained at 1 mg ml−1. The PTB7:PC71BM (19 mg mL−1, 1:1 by volume) solution was prepared in dichlorobenzene. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing CH3NH3I and lead chloride (PbCl2) powder in anhydrous DMF with a molar ratio of 3:1. The resultant solution was then stirred at 60 °C overnight in a glovebox and then filtered with a 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter before device fabrication.
Device fabrication
Patterned ITO glass substrates were thoroughly cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water, in sequence, in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. Organic solar cells with a structure of ITO/HTL/PTB7:PC71BM/LiF/Al and perovskite solar cells with a structure of ITO/HTL/CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x/PC61BM/Bphen/Ag were fabricated to investigate the functions of the aqueous-solution-processed MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 HTLs. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) based devices were also fabricated for comparison. After HTL deposition, the substrates were transferred into a glovebox for active layer coating. In the case of perovskite solar cell fabrication, PC61BM (20 mg ml−1 in chloroform) and Bphen (0.5 mg ml−1 in absolute ethanol) were sequentially deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 40 s and 4000 rpm for 40 s to act as the electron transporting layer and the cathode interfacial layer, respectively. Finally, the samples were transferred to a vacuum chamber for Al or Ag (100 nm) deposition. The active surface area of each device was 7.25 mm2.
Characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the organic solar cells and perovskite solar cells under 1 sun illumination were performed using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a system comprising a xenon lamp, a monochromator, a chopper and a lock-in amplifier attached with a calibrated silicon photodetector. The absorbance spectra were measured with a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Veeco Multimode V instrument to evaluate the surface morphology of the sTMO films. The stabilities of the organic solar cells and perovskite solar cells without encapsulation were evaluated under continuous irradiation by an incandescent lamp (at an intensity of 50 mW cm−2) in air under ambient conditions. The optical field (|E|2) calculations in the whole bulk heterojunciton solar cells were carried out by a classic transfer matrix method.
Results and discussion
In general, the interfacial layer in the planar structure solar cells is very thin (a few tens of nanometers). Water is easily accessible and ecofriendly, and thus its known as a green solvent. Most TMOs have a certain solubility in water, which provides an opportunity for MoO3, GeO2, V2O5, and CrO3 to form a thin film via aqueous-solution-processing. Uniform and transparent MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 aqueous solutions were prepared easily by dissolving these commercial TMO powders into deionized water with continuous stirring over 24 h. The sTMO thin films could be deposited by spin-coating the aqueous solutions onto ITO glass substrates with annealing (120 °C, 10 min). Then, the sTMO thin films were utilized as HTLs for fabricating PTB7:PC71BM-based organic solar cells and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x based perovskite solar cells. Fig. 1 presents a flow diagram of the sTMO preparation and device fabrication process, including the molecule structures and the device structures.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were first carried out to clarify the components in the aqueous solution processed MoO3, GeO2, V2O5, and CrO3 films. The peak positions of all the elements’ core levels were calibrated with respect to the C 1s peak located at 284.5 eV. As representatives, Fig. 2(a)–(d) show the Mo 3d, Ge 2p, V 2p and Cr 2p core levels, respectively. The Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 located at 233.2 eV and 236.1 eV, the Ge 3d located at 33.7 eV, the V 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 located at 517.8 eV and 523.1 eV, and the Cr 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 located at 579.4 eV and 587.9 eV coincide with the characteristic peaks in those reported in literature.38,45,49–51 This suggests that the MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 films could be easily deposited from their aqueous solutions.

Inset of (f) represents the calculated work functions of the PEDOT:PSS, sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5, and sCrO3 films from the UPS spectra. 
In photovoltaic devices, an interfacial layer between the electrodes and active layer are determinant for the efficiency improvement. The energy level alignment at the electrode/active layer by the interfacial layer is one of the main factors affecting the Voc of the photovoltaic devices. These TMO layers could act as interfacial layers to modify the ITO substrates. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) technique is a reliable technique for measuring the work function of thin films.52–54Fig. 2(e) and (f) present the UPS spectra of spin-coated PEDOT:PSS, MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 films on ITO substrates. The work functions estimated from the UPS spectra are summarized in the inset of Fig. 2(f). Herein, sCrO3 exhibited a relatively low work function of 4.5 eV, while sMoO3 and sGeO2 exhibited a comparable work function of 5.0 eV and 4.9 eV, respectively, compared with 5.0 eV for the PEDOT:PSS film. Among them, sV2O5 presented the highest work function, with a value of 5.2 eV. This is important as a higher work function not only increases the hole extraction due to the lowered hole extraction barrier with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the active layer but also improves the Voc of the device because Voc is also associated with the contact condition between the active layer and the electrode via the interfacial layer.55,56
The film surface properties, including the roughness and the hydrophobicity, in these aqueous-solution-processed TMO films were further evaluated. Fig. 3(a)–(e) show the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the PEDOT:PSS, sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5, and sCrO3 films that were obtained from their corresponding aquesous soluton with a concentration of 1 mg ml−1. The PEDOT:PSS film showed a smooth surface morphology with a roughness (in terms of root-mean-square (RMS)) of 2.2 nm, while the sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5, and sCrO3 films presented relatively high roughness values of 3.4 nm, 2.5 nm, 3.6 nm, and 2.4 nm, respectively. Nevertheless, these films are still smoother than the bare ITO substrate (3.8 nm). In particular, the sV2O5 film demonstrated a comparable surface morphology to the PEDOT:PSS film. Clearly, a smooth surface morphology is a prerequisite for acting as an interfacial layer in photovoltaic devices to avoid local short circuits and current leakage. Interface modification, including the surface treatment, is usually adopted for device performance optimization in photovoltaic devices.29,57–60 Particularly, in perovskite solar cells, the interfacial underlayer also strongly affects the morphology and the crystallization of the perovskite films.18,61–63 Therefore, these sTMO films with smooth morphology are expected to achieve high performance in solar cells by forming ideal interface with an active layer. In addition, the interface properties, such as dewetting and delamination, are significantly associated with the device stability. Fig. 3(f) and (g) display images of the water droplet contact angles on PEDOT:PSS, sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5, and sCrO3 films. Four TMO layers demonstrated large contact angles (over 50°) compared with PEDOT:PSS (50°). Among these, the sV2O5 film presented the best hydrophobicity with a contact angle of 77.2°. The better hydrophobicity in these TMO films suggests that the interface dewetting and delamination could be suppressed on depositing an active layer over them. Combined with the intrinsic stability of the inorganic materials, these aqueous-solution-processed HTLs could serve as protective layers to inhibit possible physical and chemical reactions between electrodes and active layers.

In general, transparent TMO thin films, with high refractive indexes, could serve as optical spacers to modulate the optical distribution in solar cells. As an example, Fig. 4(a) shows the sV2O5 thickness-dependent optical field (|E|2) distribution of the active layer, calculated by a transfer matrix method (TMM)64–68 in PTB7:PC71BM-based bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. The color gradient scale at the right of Fig. 4(a) indicates the intensity of the local optical field. The devices based on sV2O5 with a thickness of approximately 5 nm clearly demonstrated a very strong optical field over almost the entire visible light region. Therefore, we maintained the thicknesses of the sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5 and sCrO3 films at 5 nm, corresponding to their aqueous solutions at a concentration of 1 mg ml−1. The UV-Vis light absorption and transmission spectra of the sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5 and sCrO3 films (5 nm) are shown in Fig. 4(b). For comparison, the related optical characteristics of PEDOT:PSS (40 nm) are also presented. The sMoO3, sGeO2, and sV2O5 films were very transparent with similar absorption and transmission properties as PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, there was an obvious increase in transmittance in the range of 400–800 nm in the sMoO3, sGeO2, and sV2O5 films compared to PEDOT:PSS. This means that there would be an enhanced light absorption by the active layer in practical devices. Unfortunately, the sCrO3 film presented a poor transmittance, as shown by its brown color. Therefore, the optical spacer effect of the sCrO3 thin layer would be restricted by its poor transmittance. Before the fabrication of the PTB7:PC71BM based bulk heterojunction organic solar cells with the 5 nm sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5 and sCrO3 films as the HTMs, the optical field distribution in the entire device was calculated by the transfer matrix method. Fig. 4(c) gives a typical optical field plot for a single light wavelength of 500 nm in the PEDOT:PSS, sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5 and sCrO3 based organic solar cells. Enhanced optical fields in the PTB7:PC71BM active layer were clearly observed in the sMoO3, sGeO2, and sV2O5 based devices. In particular, the sV2O5 thin layer played the best role in enhancing the optical field of the PTB7:PC71BM active layer. The optical distribution considering the entire visible light range region (300–800 nm) exhibited a similar light modulating behavior (ESI, Fig. S1†). The enhanced optical field indicates that the PTB7:PC71BM active layer would enhance the photon harvesting and thus result in an improved Jsc.

Fig. 4(d) shows the J–V characteristics of PEDOT:PSS, sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5 and sCrO3 based organic solar cells under AM 1.5 G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The key cell parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, in these devices are summarized in Table 1. The sMoO3, sGeO2, and sV2O5 based devices demonstrated improved performance with simultaneous increases in Voc, Jsc, and FF compared with the PEDOT:PSS based device. Even in the case of sCrO3, the corresponding device also showed a PCE of 6.38%. Among them, the sV2O5 based device exhibited the best performance. As a direct comparison, Fig. 4(e) provides the J–V characteristics of the PEDOT:PSS and sV2O5 based devices under illumination. The detailed cell parameters are shown in the inset of Fig. 4(e). The reference device using PEDOT:PSS as an HTL showed a PCE of 7.46% with a Voc of 0.71 V, a Jsc of 16.93 mA cm−2, and an FF of 61%. By employing sV2O5 instead of PEDOT:PSS, Voc, Jsc, and FF increased to 0.73 V, 17.35 mA cm−2 and 66%, respectively. Consequently, sV2O5 based device presented an excellent performance with a PCE as high as 8.36%. Fig. 4(f) shows the stability evaluation by plotting the normalized PCE as a function of time under continuous white-light soaking with an intensity of 50 mW cm−2 in air without encapsulation. The PEDOT:PSS based device presented the worst stability, as after only 300 h illumination, the PCE rapidly dropped to 22% of the initial value. In contrast, the sV2O5-based device exhibited the best reliability, where the PCE maintained at 60% of the initial value after 300 h continuous light soaking. Further evaluations of the impedance responses (ESI, Fig. S2†) and the reactance–frequency relations (ESI, Fig. S3†) by impedance spectroscopy (IS) suggested that these aqueous-solution-processed TMO thin films could form better contact with the active layer compared with PEDOT:PSS.

Although aqueous-solution-processed MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 have been used as the anode interfacial layer in organic solar cells, few studies have been reported on their application in perovskite solar cells since the critical growth of the crystal perovskite films. The quality of the perovskite crystal films, including homogeneity, grain size, and crystal orientation, strongly depends on the underlayer condition. Therefore, further effort into the technological process and the consideration of the surface, interface, and energy levels are necessary for the layer-by-layer deposition of the perovskite layer on these TMOs films based on solution processing.
As mentioned, only thin (<10 nm) aqueous-solution-processed sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5 and sCrO3 films could be prepared since these TMO materials have limited solubility in water. These TMO layers are discontinuous and exhibit poor film coverage, which makes it difficult to grow high quality perovskite films on them. The film thickness and coverage could be improved by repetitive coating (more than twice). Under the optimized coating process (three times), uniform sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5 and sCrO3 films could be obtained on the ITO substrates. The corresponding perovskite solar cells approached PCE over 12% (ESI, Fig. S4 and Table S1†), which is comparable to the PEDOT:PSS-based device. Fig. 5(a) shows the optimized device performances of the perovskite solar cells incorporating the sMoO3, sGeO2, sV2O5 and sCrO3 HTLs. The main cell parameters are listed in Table 2.

The sV2O5 based device exhibited the best performance with a PCE of 13.26%, which is slightly lower than the PEDOT:PSS based device (14.13%). Furthermore, we combined the advantages of PEDOT:PSS and sTMO to develop composite films as the HTLs in perovskite solar cells. When preparing PEDOT:PSS–TMO composite precursors, the concentration of the TMO aqueous solution was kept as 1 mg ml−1. Then, the as-prepared TMO aqueous solutions were blended into the PEDOT:PSS solution with different volume ratios. With the optimized mixing ratios (ESI, Fig. S5 and Table S2†), the devices demonstrated clearly improved performance, with a PCE over 14.5%, as shown in Fig. 5(b) and Table 2. Fig. 5(c) gives a direct comparison of the J–V characteristics of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS–V2O5 (2:1) based perovskite solar cells. A PCE as high as 18.03% was approached when using the PEDOT:PSS–V2O5 (2:1) composite film as the HTL. Compared with the PEDOT:PSS based device, three key parameters were increased simultaneously with respect to Voc from 0.93 to 1.02 V, Jsc from 20.54 to 22.38 mA cm−2 and FF from 74% to 79%. The histograms of the PCE parameters verified the reproducibility of the high efficiency in the PEDOT:PSS–V2O5 based PSCs (ESI, Fig. S6†). In addition, Jsc values rose in all the PEDOT:PSS–TMO composite films based devices.
The improvement of Jsc is attributed to the enhanced incident light conversion efficiency. Fig. 5(d) shows the absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x perovskite layer on different PEDOT:PSS–TMO composite HTLs. Compared to the case of pristine PEDOT:PSS, an absorption enhancement was observed in all composite HTLs based CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x films. The corresponding incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra are shown in Fig. 5(e). There was a significant increment of IPCE in almost the entire visible-light region for all the composite HTLs based devices. We ascribed this to the better growth of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x polycrystalline films on these PEDOT:PSS–TMO composite HTLs. The improved polycrystalline film quality of the perovskite films grown on the V2O5-modified PEDOT:PSS under layer was verified by the XRD patterns (ESI, Fig. S7†). The increase in Voc was associated with the modified interface contact between the ITO electrode and perovskite active layer. Besides the active layer, Voc is also associated with the difference in the work functions of the two electrodes when the interface contact between the electrode and active layer is non-ohmic. Herein, sV2O5 demonstrated a work function as high as 5.2 eV, as shown in Fig. 2(f). The PEDOT:PSS–V2O5 modified ITO gave a large difference of the work function between the ITO anode and Ag cathode, resulting in a large Voc exceeding 1.0 V in the PEDOT:PSS–V2O5-based perovskite solar cells.
Similarly, PEDOT:PSS–TMO based perovskite solar cells presented a stable performance compared with the pristine PEDOT:PSS based perovskite solar cell. As shown in Fig. 5(f), the PEDOT:PSS based device exhibited a rapid degradation in performance, where the PCE decayed to 20.6% of the initial value after illumination for 360 h in air. In contrast, the PCE retained over 50% (62.6% for the PEDOT:PSS–V2O5 based device) of their initial values in all the PEDOT:PSS–TMO based devices. In general as the PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersions are acidic with a pH value of about 2, they would corrode the ITO electrode and accelerate the interface degradation. The aqueous solutions of the MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 materials are almost neutral due to their weak hydrolysis reactions in water. Therefore, the acidity of PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersions could be neutralized partly after introducing these TMO aqueous solutions. The improved stability in the PEDOT:PSS + V2O5 based device could be reflected from the cross-sectional SEM images of aged (150 h, exposure to air) devices (Fig. S8, ESI†). The PEDOT:PSS + V2O5 based device still maintained good interface contact at the anode side. In contrast, the anode interface in the PEDOT:PSS based device was adversely deteriorated with many large voids. The content analysis based on the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) technique further confirmed the improved cell stability in the PEDOT:PSS + V2O5 based device since it still kept a very low oxygen content even on long time exposure to air.
EDX analysis before and after long time exposure to air is important to understand the better stability of V2O5 based PS cell.
In addition, the good hydrophobicity with high contact angles of these sTMO films (Fig. 3) could restrict the interface dewetting and delamination partly. Consequently, PEDOT:PSS–TMO based devices demonstrated long stabilities due to suppressed interface degradation.
Conclusion
We demonstrated a facile route to deposite aqueous-solution-processed MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 interfacial layers by directly dissolving their commercial powders in deionized water. Due to their higher work functions and stabilities, these sTMO thin films have great potential application as a hole-transporting layer in photovoltaic devices, such as organic solar cells and perovskite solar cells. Among these, the sV2O5 film exhibited the highest work function of 5.2 eV and the best hydrophobicity with a contact angle of 77.2°. A higher work function is beneficial not only for enhancing the hole extraction, which could improve the cell parameter, Jsc but also for modifying the anode, which could increase the cell parameter, Voc. As a result, the sV2O5-based organic solar cell and perovskite solar cell presented PCEs of 8.36% and 13.26%, respectively. Furthermore, composite films consisting of PEDOT:PSS and TMO materials could serve as more efficient HTLs in perovskite solar cells. In particular, the PEDOT:PSS–V2O5 interfacial layer based device obtained a maximum PCE of 18.03% with a Voc exceeding 1.0 V. Overall, the preparation of aqueous-solution-processed MoO3, GeO2, V2O5 and CrO3 films is very simple and is carried out without any vacuum processing by avoiding their high melting temperature. The use of an inexpensive and green solvent (water) that is easily accessible and ecofriendly, is a great advantage in this preparation. These developed sTMO hole-transporting layers have potential applications in green and low-cost photovoltaic devices in the future.
