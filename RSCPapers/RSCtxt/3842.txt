    , Accepted 6th July 2021First published on 22nd September 2021AbstractQuantum dots (QDs), owing to their single atom-like electronic structure due to quantum confinement, are often referred to as artificial atoms. This unique physical property results in the diverse functions exhibited by QDs. A wide array of applications have been achieved by the surface functionalization of QDs, resulting in exceptional optical, antimicrobial, catalytic, cytotoxic and enzyme inhibition properties. Ordinarily, traditionally prepared QDs are subjected to post synthesis functionalization via a variety of methods, such as ligand exchange or covalent and non-covalent conjugation. Nevertheless, solvent toxicity, combined with the high temperature and pressure conditions during the preparation of QDs and the low product yield due to multiple steps in the functionalization, limit their overall use. This has driven scientists to investigate the development of greener, environmental friendly and cost-effective methods that can circumvent the complexity and strenuousness associated with traditional processes of bio-functionalization. In this review, a detailed analysis of the methods to bio-prepare pre-functionalized QDs, with elucidated mechanisms, and their application in the areas of catalysis and biomedical applications has been conducted. The environmental and health and safety aspects of the bio-derived QDs have been briefly discussed to unveil the future of nano-commercialization.Reddhy MahleReddhy Mahle obtained her BTech from Banasthali University and her MTech from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur.

1. Introduction
Living organisms, with a huge and comparatively unexploited genetic pool, hold immense potential to express highly complex metabolic systems.1 These systems, in conjugation with bio-templates, have been proven to systematically carry out the fabrication of nano-scale materials.2 Nature's synthetic machinery is equipped with intrinsic tools to create highly functional nano-structures with tunable qualities. This has lead to interdisciplinary collaboration among material scientists, biologists, physicists and chemists to comprehend the underlying mechanisms behind bio-derived nanomaterials. These bio-systems demonstrate self-assembly behaviour at the microscale using biomolecules, which is defined as a bottom up approach towards nanofabrication.3 Accordingly, some living cells are reported to take up inorganic materials from their surroundings and form complex inorganic–organic hybrids with exemplary nanoscale characteristics; sea shells, teeth and bone are the most common examples of CaCO3 exploitation by living cells.4–7
A better comprehension of bio-mechanisms for nanostructure synthesis is anticipated to develop a wide gamut of value added materials with applications ranging from biomedicine to bioelectronics. Biomolecules, proteins, polysaccharides, peptides and amino acids have been identified as the crucial parameters for crystal nucleation and growth with their role as capping agents.8 Since proteins are postulated to mediate the crystallization of biological structures, Gaskin et al. has attempted to engineer viral genetic libraries to modify coat proteins for crystal binding. Peptides and proteins were genetically amplified to bind specific crystals.9 These organic molecules have significant control over the nucleation and structural/functional properties of the produced materials, which provides motivation to create a biomimetic assembly system that deals with the inorganic–biomolecule interactions found in biosystems.10 Glutathione, a tripeptide made up of cysteine, glutamic acid and glycine, has been widely reported as a capping agent for QDs’ nucleation and growth.11,12 These biomimetic approaches involve the bio-physicochemical qualities of the bioderived molecules including their water affinity, reducing property, chelating capability and 3D conformation, which assist the QDs’ growth and direct their nucleation. The underlying chemistry of bio-extracted molecule assisted QD formation can be studied, and the single step synthesis of QDs in living cells promises better yield and easier fabrication of the QDs’ intrinsic and surface properties upon comprehensive study of the biomechanism. Among other bioreactors, microorganisms offer a scalable and tunable approach to fabricating nano-materials owing to their high metal recognition and highly efficient biomineralization, where microbes accrue toxic metals via biosorption, entrapment, enzyme derived mechanisms and/or precipitation.13–15 Naturally engineered nanomaterials and their applications have already paved the way for using the bio-assembly approach to develop new functional materials with exciting properties: (i) unique size-based qualities, forming intermediates between bulk and atomic materials, (ii) the scope to incorporate a controlled composition of inorganic, organic and hybrid constituents and (iii) designed surface functionality.4 Currently, the most discussed and investigated nano-scale materials which have been crystallized through bio-derived components or inside living organisms are QDs, which show intricate structure–function relationships.16
The term ‘quantum dot’ was given by Mark Reed, a Yale physicist, to define the disposition of these ultra-small semiconductor crystals as an intermediate between the bulk material and an atom.17 This is referred to as the phenomenon of quantum confinement, where the reduction in the size of the crystal up to the dimensions of the quantum limit, the exciton Bohr radius, leads to the discretion of the electrons’ continuous energy levels.18 QDs are also referred to as artificial atoms, owing to the distinct energy spectra of their electrons or holes, phonons and polaritons. Materials created using QDs as their constituents are considered to be amenable to their functionality being controlled physically and chemically at the nanometer scale.19 Quantum confinement results in the QDs’ emission at discrete wavelengths, which is known as their energy signature.20 QDs exhibit a wide band of absorption with easy optical excitation, which renders them an effective tool for bio-imaging and bio-labelling. The targeting of cells using toxic dyes and their monitoring using laser light has been in practice for ages and is now being replaced by biocompatible QDs, given that they can be excited by a common light source. Bio-compatible QDs promise to be good candidates for biomedical and photocatalytic research areas. The cytotoxic activity manifested by the QDs renders them effective for antimicrobial action against pathogenic strains. The detection of biomolecules using QDs is considered to be an efficient approach in the healthcare and diagnosis sector. The bio-prepared QDs are pre-functionalized with the organic groups which are released by the living cells. The functional groups assist in the biological binding and effective sensing. Bio-functionalized QDs are also being used for drug delivery and bioimaging applications. The biological applications of QDs are considerably influenced by their surface states, which is why physicochemically manufactured bare coated QDs are often required to be surface passivated or bio-conjugated. Phase transfer and particle functionalization are the processes which are usually followed to bio-functionalize QDs and involve ligating biomolecules to the QDs.21 Similarly, biomolecules can be loaded on QDs based on non-covalent binding such as high affinity secondary interactions or dative chemistry whereas covalent binding uses cross linkers.22 These commonly followed methods include several functionalization steps to design bio-conjugated QDs, resulting in limited purity and overall product yield. With multiple steps, such processes have proven to be expensive for commercial use and hence require further exploration.21
Such disadvantages, associated with the conventional means of the fabrication and post-synthesis functionalization of QDs (as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1), have resulted in the quest for greener, ecologically safer and sustainable methods.

The bio-mediated preparation of QDs has been deployed as a cost-effective and non-hazardous strategy to circumvent arduous and complex physicochemical protocols.23 This review attempts to study and comprehend the green routes for nanoscience which could be utilized to develop production level materials by providing advanced research and development strategies with a brief discussion about the impact of bio-produced materials on health and environmental safety. The bio-prepared QDs are also discussed for their role in biomedical and catalytic applications.
2. Bio-based methods for QD preparation
2.1 Bacteria mediated extracellular and intracellular QD synthesis
Bacteria, the most ubiquitously and prodigiously studied microorganisms, are persistently exemplified for their typical self-defense against toxic metals. The usual bacterial defence action involves the entrapment of metal ions and their fixation into an innocuous form. The bacterial preparation of nanoparticles occurs following the same scheme, where metal challenged bacteria release biomolecules to precipitate the modified metal forms either extracellularly (outside the cell) or intracellularly (inside the cell). Metal chalcogenides (S, Te and Se) and oxides are the most common optically active QDs which are precipitated by bacteria.
The chalcogenide QDs which are synthesized by bacteria and their mechanism of fabrication, with observed superiority over traditional methods, are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2. sulphides are among the most common bacterially synthesized metal chalcogenides, especially by facultative anaerobes. Zinc, a non-toxic metal for bacteria, was observed to be modified into nanoscale zinc sulphide (ZnS) by anaerobic photosynthetic and sulphate-reducing bacteria. The mechanism of ZnS formation slightly differs in both cases, where ZnS QDs are prepared inside the cells and later transported outside for the Gram-negative Rhodobacter spheroids, while in the case of the Desulphobacteriaceae, sulphate reduction into sulphide occurs on the cell surface where ZnS precipitates.24 When Gram-negative Escherichia strains were challenged with a heavy metal, Cd, it led to the deposition of CdTe and CdS QDs when supplied with Na2TeO3 and Na2S, respectively. Both of these studies were carried out separately. Surprisingly, CdTe QDs deposited around the cells were assisted by the bacterially secreted proteins, while for the second experiment, Cd and S2− were transported inside the cells where CdS QD synthesis occurred in the cytoplasm. The intracellular CdS synthesis is shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Bacteria mediated extracellular (enzymatic) and intracellular synthesis of QDs (intracellular CdS deposition is mediated by conjugating Cd ions with the phytochelatin complex, which is later transported into the vacuole for sulphide attachment) (ref. 25–29 and 37).

CdS QDs are usually precipitated outside the cell and rarely transported inside the cell. The extracellular deposition of QDs has been proven to be more beneficial than intracellular synthesis owing to the less complicated down streaming. Also, with the intracellular confinement of metal ions into the corresponding QDs, there is a distinct change in the physical and thus the optical properties of the produced QDs due to the modified cell environment. Genetic engineering of bacterial species has also been carried out to overexpress biomolecules such as glutathione (GSH) reducing enzymes or capping agents (phytochelatins) which assist QD nucleation and growth. With the exploitation of the similar bacterial cell behaviour with metal ions, molybdenum ions were bio-modified into functional group conjugated MoS2 QDs utilizing the facultative anaerobe Pseudomonas aeruginosa.29
Apart from sulphides, bacteria also manage to oxidize the metals in their environment and produce nano metal oxides. However, there are fewer examples regarding the synthesis of metal oxide QDs using bacteria.38 Electronegative functional groups on the bacterial cell surface attract the metal ions for adsorption which later get modified according to the cell's redox potential.38 Redox potential mediated biomineralization has also been manifested by a unique group of bacteria, classified as magnetotactic bacteria. Magnetotactic bacteria have the ability of magnetic orientation, owing to the presence of magnetosomes, which are nano-sized intracellular organelles containing iron mineral crystals. The biomineralization process for magnetite formation is hugely susceptible to the redox conditions which are prevalent in the cellular environment and influenced by the oxygen levels or oxidized carbon sources.39
2.2 Yeast cell assisted QD fabrication
Dameron et al. demonstrated the first-ever yeast-assisted intracellular fabrication of QDs (CdS) in 1989, exploiting Candida glabrata and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.40 The excellent results showed that this method of fabrication produced more monodispersive QDs as compared to other chemical methods prevalent at that time. Ordinarily, yeast cells perform the intracellular synthesis of sulphide QDs, primarily CdS (Table 3). The intracellular synthesis of semiconductor crystallites involves the membranous uptake of toxic metal ions, causing a rise in cellular sulphide production. The prepared QDs are capped by peptides or phytochelatins, ensuring their long-term stability. There are limited reports of metal chalcogenide formation via yeast biological systems.

2.3 Fungi mediated extracellular synthesis of QDs
Eukaryotes have been explored for their potential to synthesize QDs and fungal cells were found to extracellularly fabricate nanoparticles. Fusarium oxysporum was reported to be the first ever fungal culture to produce QDs via extracellularly released sulphate reductase enzymes to entrap Cd ions, eventually leading to the formation of CdS QDs.50 The extracellular synthesis of QDs is reinforced by the surface groups or enzymes released by the eukaryotic cells in response to the metals supplied in the media. Metal oxide QD preparation via fungal cultures occurs through metal hydrolysis by the proteins released by the cells and their further modification into small-sized oxide QDs. The as-prepared QDs have the cells’ secreted proteins deposited on their surface which improve their stability but often interfere with their functionalities, which is why they are ordinarily removed by calcination.51,52 Dead fungal biomass has been reported to allow the modification of metals into their oxide QDs owing to organic macromolecules such as chitosan, saccharides, lipid, proteins, etc. on their surfaces.53
The metal sulphide and oxide QDs fabricated using fungal cell cultures are listed in Table 4 and proposed mechanisms are given in Fig. 3.

2.4 Plant extracts as QD precursors
Among eukaryotes, the plants have well developed and widely explored multifarious defence systems against toxic metal ions which is exploited for phytoremediation. Plant extracts, including secondary metabolites such as tannins, alkaloids and lipids, have been studied for their potential to synthesise optically active QDs and plant extract-based QDs and are listed in Table 5. However, the plant extract assisted methods are mostly combined with high-temperature methods to prepare the QDs, which limits their overall applicability.

2.5 Physicochemical mediated green methods
Environmentally sustainable eco-friendly approaches, reinforced by high-temperature treatments, are also practised widely to fabricate value-added QDs. Plant extracts, obtained through microwave or ultrasound treatment, contain polyphenols, amino acids, vitamins or antioxidants which confer a stabilization effect on the prepared QDs.57,62 Monosaccharides, such as glucose, have also been used as capping agents in a chemical precipitation reaction for producing ZnS QDs.63 Fluorescent carbon QDs, with their wide application as bioimaging probes, have been reported to be fabricated using plant-based precursors. The organic substrates are subjected to high temperatures for optimal extraction to produce highly functional carbon dots (CDs).64,65 The green-based methods to synthesize QDs and their real-time applications have been listed in Table 6 and Fig. 4.

The basis for the selection of plants to achieve high carbon QD yields lies in the presence of a significant amount of hydrocarbons in their extracts. The as-produced dots are rendered with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on their surfaces, which makes them effective towards bio labelling, bioimaging or as detection probes.
2.6 Animal cell based QD preparation and other biomimetic methods
In addition to the microbial and plant cell based fabrication of value added QDs, there are reports of animal and viral protein assisted QD formation. The glutathione reducing pathway in earthworms has been applied in cadmium detoxification via tellurite reduction by GSH reducing enzymes. Lumbricu rubellus earthworms were supplied with the precursors Cd2+ and tellurite and produced luminescent CdTe QDs with an average size of ∼2 nm and emission in the green region of the spectrum.90 Virus protein subunits display a multitude of charged amino acids which significantly nucleate and support the growth of sulphide QDs. These surface peptides were over-expressed in the genetically engineered M13 bacteriophage as capsid proteins and templated the formation of ZnS and CdS nanocrystallites.91 The application of biological molecules in supporting the nucleation and crystallite growth of QDs provides insights into using cell-derived molecules for biomimetic QD synthesis. Biomolecules, nucleic acids, peptides and enzymes with exceptional biochemical properties such as water solubility, reducing ability and charged 3D structures have been reported to template QD growth and can also be used as capping agents.92
3. Biomedical and catalytic applications of bio-synthesized QDs
3.1 Bio-medicinal activity exhibited by green synthesized QDs
Green synthesized QDs, owing to their bio-based fabrication, have significant potential in medical applications. Such ultra-small sized bio-conjugated particles allow the low-level detection of biomolecules29 along with their exploitation as antimicrobial and apoptotic agents.

3.1.1 Biomolecules sensing. 
Basic bio-medicinal diagnosis is hugely dependent on the development of extremely sensitive and highly selective biosensors. QDs manifest high luminescence quantum yield with symmetric photoluminescence, resulting in their efficient utilization as bio-probes. Their low photochemical bleaching, long fluorescence lifetime, size-tunable emission, exclusive luminescence and photoelectrochemical behaviour further offer the potential to achieve better detection efficacy for biomolecules. QD based biosensors are classified into four primary categories which are fluorescent, bioluminescent, chemiluminescent and photoelectrochemical biosensors. Fluorescence-based biosensors exploit fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to detect the molecules. In FRET, energy transfer occurs from a high-energy donor fluorophore to a lower energy acceptor fluorophore via a dipole–dipole interaction.93 Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), on the other hand, utilizes a bioluminescent molecule such as luciferase as an energy donor to carry out the substrate oxidation for light emission, which is further transferred to the acceptor. Owing to their large Stokes shifts, QDs are considered to be outstanding BRET acceptors. Chemiluminescence (CL) biosensing is a chemical reaction mediated light emission which requires oxidation or luminescence quenching agents for detection. It offers the advantages of being selective, having a wider range and less background noise, although CL intensity is comparatively weaker as compared to other traditional methods. Photoelectrochemical reaction-based biosensing is a step further where photoexcitation energy is converted into an electrical signal. QD based photoelectrochemical sensors have QDs on the electrode surface and illumination of the electrode produces current signals.94 However, FRET-based detection is the most preferred QD biosensing phenomenon given its high sensitivity.95,96 Ordinarily, biomolecule detection via QDs is carried out through their surface functionalization to induce dangling bond formation.97 The surface groups pair with the biomolecules and their binding is translated into a change in the optical or physical properties of the QDs.
The biological assisted fabrication of QDs leads to surface group attachment during the synthesis of QDs and avoids post-synthesis surface modification. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediated formation of MoS2 QDs was examined using FTIR study, which confirmed the presence of O–H, C–S, SO42− and CO2 groups which are assigned to the media components and metabolites released during bacterial growth and augment the binding of QDs with glucose and H2O2.29 DNA templated QDs have also been studied for their applications in nucleic acid and small molecule detection.98Fig. 5 demonstrates the sensing of enzyme activity and biomolecules such as nucleic acids, glucose and H2O2 using QDs. Table 7 proves a comparative analysis of different QDs for their application in biological sensing.

In addition to other semiconductor QDs, carbon dots also have huge potential for metal sensing, which is presented in Fig. 6. Metal detection in industrial and polluted water remains the biggest challenge and C dots have been established to be efficient in sensing a wide range of metals, which has been shown in Table 8.

3.1.2 Bio-labelling and imaging. 
QDs with optimum signal brightness, high photostability and the ability to be excited by a range of fluorescence colors are beneficial in cellular labeling and imaging as compared to organic dyes or fluorescent proteins.117 However, in order to serve their medicinal purposes, QDs are required to be effectively surface functionalized to allow biocompatibility, water solubility and specific target detection ability. Carbon dots, synthesized using algal or plant-based extracts, exhibit superior biocompatibility, low toxicity and chemical inertness118,119 and provide significant advantages for being used in bio-imaging and bio-labeling (presented in Fig. 7 and 8).

Microbially produced CdTe QDs were studied by Bao et al. to check their cell toxicity and HeLa cell imaging.25 The results confirmed that the bacterial protein capped CdTe QDs showed 92.9% cell viability at 2 μM concentration. The biocompatible bio-produced CdTe QDs were found to effectively image HeLa cells via folate receptors on the cell membrane. Ag2Se and Ag2S QDs, prepared by genetically engineered yeast cells and cultured wheat endosperm cells respectively, have also been found to effectively image living cells60,121 as shown in Fig. 9.

3.1.3 Antimicrobial activity. 
The QD assisted destruction of microbial cells is ordinarily carried out via three biochemical mechanisms: (1) cell wall/membrane disruption,122 (2) reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for cell damage123 and (3) QDs binding with genetic material to cease cell growth.124 To augment their antimicrobial efficiency, QDs are ordinarily surface modified with polymers and sensitizers to induce ROS production and promote their attachment to the cell membrane. However, the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell membrane attachment hugely depend on the surface functionalization of QDs, including the ligand, charge distribution, zeta potential, size, shape, etc. The primary mechanisms of cell destruction are have been depicted in Fig. 10.
 Fig. 10  Suggested cytotoxic actions exhibited by QDs: (A) cell wall disruption by the action of QDs on the phospholipid bilayer, (B) ROS generation inside the cell, (C) ROS mediated protein denaturation, (D) nucleic acid damage by QDs and ROS and (E) mitochondrial membrane damage (ref. 23). 
The antibacterial activity of the algal synthesized copper oxide quantum dots was tested using the agar disc diffusion method against Enterobacter aerogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.125 The diameters of the inhibition zones for S. aureus and E. aerogenes were 16 and 14 mm, respectively. The results confirmed the significant antimicrobial action of copper oxide QDs on both Gram-negative, i.e. E. aerogenes, and Gram-positive, i.e. S. aureus, bacteria, owing to the presence of carboxyl and amine active groups which prefer the attachment of Cu2+ ions. Gram-negative bacteria appeared to be more resistant than Gram-positive bacteria, which can be attributed to the differences in the cell membrane, such as the abundance of lipids, lipopolysaccharides and proteins in the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria and the lack thereof in the Gram-positive bacteria. The binding of Cu2+ with nucleic acid strands and the eventual disruption of the native structure has been suggested as the reason for cell growth cessation. The ROS mediated antimicrobial activity of the biosynthesized ZnS QDs was examined by regulating E. coli cell viability and zone inhibition for a wide concentration range.126 In this study, Zn ion assisted ROS release is considered to be the major route towards bacterial cell destruction. Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis is the primary mechanism of cell death by QDs, which causes dysfunctional mitochondrial pathways. ROS profusion leads to damage in the membrane phospholipids, disturbing the mitochondrial membrane polarization. It causes the escape of electrons from the pathway chain and their reaction with molecular oxygen to form toxic H2O2 or OH˙ radicals. In a similar way, sulphide QDs, produced microbially using sulphate reducing bacteria, showed effective antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Klebsiella pneumoniae synthesized CdS and ZnS QDs have been found to exhibit antibacterial action against Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus sp. and Candida albicans.127 Also, CdTe QDs produced using a Fusarium oxysporum culture manifested antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Filter paper assays were used to test the action of the protein capped CdTe QDs against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Significant inhibition zones were obtained for all of the tested strains.128 Antibacterial activity is generally defined in the form of the inhibition zone diameter. The microbial inhibition exhibited by the different QDs is shown in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  Bacterial inhibition zone achieved by QDs (ref. 125, 127 and 129–132). 


3.1.4 Therapeutic effects of bio-prepared QDs against cancerous cells. 
Biosynthesised QDs conjugated with particular ligands or biological entities have been proven to be more accurate as compared to conventional probes. As mentioned in section 3.1.3, there is a wide range of cell destruction mechanisms exhibited by the semiconductor nanoparticles. The cytotoxicity of the green synthesized CdS QDs prepared from radish root extract was tested for their cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 and AGS cancerous cell lines. The MTT assay confirmed the damaging effect of CdS QDs on both of the cell lines, where the cell viability of MCF-7 cells was inhibited at 12.5 mg ml−1 and viability inhibition for the AGS line was observed at a 25 mg ml−1 concentration of CdS QDs.133 ZnO QDs produced via the sol–gel hydrothermal method with green soy fatty acids as precursors were examined for their potential as an antitumor agent against human nasopharynx carcinoma, human breast cancer, human colon adenocarcinoma, human foreskin fibroblast and HeLa cell lines. Apoptosis and necrosis analysis of the cell lines was carried out using flow cytometry and reported the antiproliferative effect of the QDs on the cells.134

3.2 Catalytic activity
Bio-prepared QDs have been studied for their exploitation in catalysis and they have largely displayed efficacy for typical redox reactions. Their effective function in catalysis has been utilized in a plethora of real-life applications, such as water purification, chemical degradation and in sun based energy production via hydrogen evolution or water splitting.
Nano TiO2, fabricated using Bacillus subtilis, were checked for their photocatalytic activity by suspending them in pond water and irradiating them for 20 min at a 15 cm distance. 10 mg of TiO2 powder was found to produce 12 ppm of H2O2 and hence they were claimed to show effective photocatalysis. Also, the H2O2 concentration increased significantly for the monodispersive TiO2 QDs.38 Co3O4 QDs, prepared from Azadirachta indica leaf extract treated with the hot plate combustion method, were examined for their photocatalytic degradation of industrial dye waste and the catalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol and 4-nitroaniline with NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The results demonstrated the photocatalytic degradation of dye waste, with an optimum catalyst dosage of 40 mg resulting in up to 73% removal of waste COD. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the green fabricated Co3O4 was confirmed through a controlled chemical reaction where nitro groups were converted into amine groups. The hydrogenation of the toxic chemicals was achieved under mild conditions with no release of hazardous nitro byproducts of NaBH4. The method was established as an eco-friendly cost-effective alternative for textile waste remediation.58
SnO2 QDs were fabricated using bean pod extract and exhibited excellent optical properties, which confirmed their application in photocatalysis. Acidic Yellow 23 (AY 23) was photo-degraded using the as-prepared SnO2 QDs and the results confirmed up to 98% dye degradation for the optimized concentrations of the catalyst (SnO2) and substrate (AY 23) i.e. 20 mg and 5 mg L−1, respectively, when illuminated under UV light (λ = 254 nm) for 24 min.135 The detailed mechanism for the photodegradation is schematically represented in Fig. 12.
 Fig. 12  Proposed photocatalysis or photodegradation shown by SnO2, TiO2 and Co3O4 QDs (ref. 38, 58 and 135). 
Carbon dots (C dots), with the potential to absorb in the entire solar spectrum i.e. from UV to NIR, are considered to be exceptional materials in the photocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis and optoelectronics research areas. For photocatalysis, C dots conjugate with other photocatalysts or QDs in order to augment their activity, which is ordinarily done through two ways. C dots mediate photon transfer to the conjugated semiconductor materials and also, with an optimum bandgap, C dots promote electron channelling for proper charge separation and consequently enhance the charge carriers available for photocatalysis.136 The photocatalysis mechanism exhibited by C dots is shown in Fig. 13, which includes C dots acting as electron reservoirs, mediators and sensitizers when conjugated with metal oxides. TiO2 nanofibre conjugated C dots were synthesized using lemon peel waste and their photocatalytic activity was analyzed via methylene blue degradation. C dots, with a high quantum yield, increased the photocatalytic activity to 2.5 times higher than that of the TiO2 nanofibres alone. This increment in the photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enhanced charge separation at the C dots–TiO2 interface. The excitons, generated upon UV illumination, are well separated with electrons transferred to the C dots and holes staying in the valence band of TiO2. The electrons react with oxygen to produce O2− ions, while H2O molecules react with holes to produce OH˙ radicals. The hydroxyl radicals further degrade the methylene blue into innocuous forms.
 Fig. 13  Suggested mechanism for C dots as electron reservoirs and sensitizers and in the upconversion method of catalysis (ref. 137). 
Nitrogen-doped C dots were manufactured utilizing fruit extracts and their photocatalytic activity was studied via dye degradation with sodium borohydride as the reducing agent. N doped C dots were produced using Hylocereus undatus (H. undatus) extract as the carbon source and aqueous ammonia as the nitrogen precursor. The prepared dots exhibited excellent catalytic activity for methylene blue degradation. Owing to the high electron-accepting capability of the C dots, N–C dots channel the electrons from the reducing agent, NaBH4, to methylene blue, thereby reducing the energy barrier for the overall reaction.138 Similarly, Actinidia deliciosa extract was used as a carbon precursor to fabricate N doped C dots with ammonia as the N dopant. The photocatalytic activity was checked using rhodamine B dye degradation with NaBH4 as a reducing agent. With the same mechanism as mentioned before, the prepared dots proved to be an exceptional photocatalyst for dye conversion into harmless compounds via smooth electron transfer.139 The C dot mediated photodegradation of toxic chemicals, such as methylene blue and rhodamine B dyes, has been found to be an effective approach towards industrial waste treatment. The photocatalytic degradation has been compared for different QDs and comparative analysis is given in Fig. 14.

4. Process scaling up bottlenecks and current technology readiness
The principal strategies for the bio-inspired fabrication of value-added QDs have been thoroughly discussed in the previous sections. However, the individual processes need to be evaluated separately in order to achieve their commercial applications. The primary scaling up of the microbial process involves microbe mass cultivation in bio-reactors and eventual product recovery and purification. Commercially available bio-ethanol, -gas, and -diesel can be considered as examples of scaled-up microbial processes which largely require bulk scale microbial cultivation. Microbial cultivation is limited by a plethora of factors which, to a certain extent, have been controlled by research and development. However, there is believed to be a major bottleneck in scaling up QD synthesis by the product recovery and purification. As mentioned in the green QD production methods, green synthesized QDs are either released into the extracellular environment or are confined inside the microbial cells. Downstream processing involves the QDs’ extraction from the cell media solution and their purification to eliminate redundantly attached organic entities. The bulk scale synthesis of QDs falls under the coalition of the microbiology and chemical engineering sections of the methods, which decide the conclusive process parameters, reactor selection and operation robustness. Continuous reactors offer better control of the process parameters and reaction conditions in comparison to regular batch reactors. Microchannel devices and rotating packed bed reactors have been suggested for the continuous bio-manufacturing of QDs.147 However, the development of the large scale biosynthesis of QDs is still in its nascent stage, with researchers assiduously working to promote large scale commercial purposes. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) of the whole process takes the product quality and cost into account and determines the overall efficacy of the scaled-up method.
Another factor that depicts the acceptance of any method at the operational level and estimates its maturity for large scale acquisition is the technology readiness level. For QD bio-synthesis, there is no distinct scale adopted to classify it in terms of its technical development. However, deriving the analogy from the NASA defined TRLs, the living cell mediated or biologically assisted technology of QD preparation can be considered as being in the method/process development level, where efforts are being made to optimize the process parameters and reactions conditions for commercial-scale purposes.
For the other synthetic methods of QD fabrication, there are reports of their commercial-scale production but these methods involve toxic chemicals and ecologically dangerous treatments, which requires the development of safer and economically viable bio-based methods.
5. Biobased “greener” routes for environmental health and safety (EHS)
Nanotechnology has been past its discovery phase for a long time and successfully offers a potential solution to traditional environmental and technology predicaments i.e. solar energy, catalysis, pollution, health care etc. Governments and private industries have invested hugely in nano R&D, which has been actively impeded by the powerful voices concerned with the threats to environmental and health safety due to nanotechnology.148 At the early stages of nanoscience research, owing to the smaller scale of production, there were relatively less pressing issues regarding the hazards and/or product yield due to the smaller amounts of waste generation. After the discovery and research stage of nanotechnology, there has been an enormous emergence in the number of companies, a myriad of consumer products and eventually public attention. Thus, this demands an urgent addressing of the real or assumed threats before they hinder future applications. Multiple levels of regulation and control have been set up by multidisciplinary teams, i.e. environmental and nanomaterials researchers, to define the standard approaches for dealing with complex nanomaterial hazards. Apart from the control measures which are to be applied to the materials which are on the verge of commercialization, green science based material design methods strive to eliminate human health and environment hazards and to carry out the production of nanomaterials with customized structures, purities and compositions. Green approaches using biobased techniques enhance the manufacturing of materials with lower costs and better throughput.149 The water solubility of the nanomaterials produced via bio-techniques enable rapid and effective product purification using continuous flow nanoporous membrane filtration, known as diafiltration, which is a scalable method to purify huge quantity of materials.150 Such properties illustrate the wide application of biobased green routes in addressing the EHS concerns and production of high quality nanoscale materials.
6. Biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles
Metallic nanoparticles (NPs) also have huge potential in several applications ranging from the optoelectronic to biomedical fields. To fulfil the requirements of the faster ever growing market of metal NPs, there is a dire need for low-cost, nontoxic and environmentally safe approaches for the synthesis of Au, Ag, Pt NPs etc. There is a plethora of reports about the employment of biological resources like bacteria, fungi, yeast, plants, or their extracts for the fabrication of metallic NPs. Biomimetic systems or the biomolecule mediated synthesis of Au nanomaterials have been used for the past two decades with well comprehended mechanisms, allowing their use for metal surface functionalization or improved intrinsic qualities.151 Similarly, plant based extracts, such as the primary and secondary metabolite mediated preparation of metallic NPs, have been widely reported with the underlying mechanisms elaborated, including photosynthesis.152 Extracted and purified microbial enzymes have also been explored for their utilization in metallic nanomaterial synthesis, which provides an alternative to biomimetic and biomolecule assisted NP production.153 These strategies are gaining popularity and are being hugely explored further for their commercialization.
7. Challenges and perspectives
Biosynthesised QDs are quintessentially biocompatible and ubiquitously appealing biomedicinal nanomaterials. Biocompatible materials are commonly prepared via three common routes: (1) living organisms as biosystems, (2) functional biological molecules as templates (biomimetic approach) and (3) the surface functionalization of chemically produced QDs. Among these, the green preparation of QDs using living cells circumvents the hazardous impact of harsh chemicals and presents a viable choice for QD synthesis. Although plenty of biological reactors have been exercised to harvest QDs, these methods are still challenged by a number of issues. The common predicaments faced by current bioreactors are: (i) the biomolecular mechanisms to precipitate QDs extracellularly or to encapsulate QDs intracellularly are still to be determined, (ii) owing to the limited comprehension of metabolic pathways, the physicochemical properties shown by QDs could hardly be controlled, leading to the mediocre quality of the bioprepared QDs and (iii) the application of toxic chemicals to living cells impedes the cells’ viability, restraining the pilot scale production. Presently, the most pressing job is to improve the functional and structural qualities of bio-fabricated QDs. Hence, the principle directions to improve the production and efficiency of QDs are listed: (a) optimization of the reaction parameters (i.e. temperature, pH, precursors’ concentrations) to improve the yields and properties,28 (b) living system genetic engineering to over-synthesize the crucial biomolecules154 and (c) integrated biosynthetic and biomimetic approaches.
Apart from the problems associated with the improvement of QD bio-synthesis and efficiency, in vivo toxicology invariably remains the primary concern which hinders their clinical application. A systematic and comprehensive investigation needs to be carried out to evaluate the toxicity, preparatory pathways and in vivo action of biologically prepared QDs. In particular, in the case of the bacteria/fungi mediated growth and nucleation of QDs, toxicity remains the principal concern when the pathogenic strains are being employed, which further impedes their application in health and medical conditions. Such limits could be addressed by utilizing the extracellular approach of QD preparation, which leads to their feasible and effective extraction and purification with no pathogenic cells’ extract attached to their surface. There are still unexplored/under-developed strategies which can be used to produce pathogen free QDs via efficient fabrication, extraction and purification methods. Up to 2021, we have managed to create history by utilizing highly functional QDs for drug delivery and live imaging to tackle terminal medical conditions.155,156 There might still be a long journey for the commercialization and clinical application of living organism produced QDs, but we strongly believe that the immense development and integration of artificial intelligence, nano and biotechnology will result in the real life applications of bio-prepared QDs in the coming years.
8. Conclusions
QDs are progressively attaining wider popularity due to their remarkable catalytic, optical and biomedical properties. In the same way, they are gathering more research interest, specifically regarding their synthesis methods which involve a greener and more eco-friendly approach. Microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, have been demonstrated to be fairly simple bio-systems to precipitate surface functionalized dots and thus hold immense potential to be utilized for QD customization. Current methods principally deal with the biomineralization of toxic metals through microbial cells, leading to their precipitation; these processes can be further modified to synthesize new classes of materials. Bio-prepared QDs possess exceptional qualities in terms of their diverse catalytic and biomedical applications, owing to their functionalization during the preparatory stage. Bio-based synthesis strategies are needed to be examined to understand the mechanism involved in the QD production and the influence of bio-parameters on the extracellular and intracellular synthesis of QDs needs to be investigated further. Media engineering is another enticing prospect which can be explored to contrive multifunctional QDs by controlling the growth media constituents. Further studies on potential green bio-based synthesis should involve the laboratory-based scale to industrial production of QDs, considering the health and environmental implications.
