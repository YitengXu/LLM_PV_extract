    , Accepted 29th June 2017First published on 30th June 2017AbstractHalide perovskites have attracted increasing attention in recent years as promising materials for optoelectronic devices. Herein, we report the use of a one-step spin-coating method for the preparation of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite thin film photodetectors. For the preparation of devices, the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite thin films were applied onto the interdigitated (IDT) patterned Au electrodes, and symmetrically structured photoconductive detectors were obtained. Photoresponse analysis reveals that a high photoresponsivity of 55 A W−1, an on/off photocurrent ratio of 1.06 × 105, a specific detectivity of up to 0.9 × 1013 Jones, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16700%, and a fast response speed of 430/318 μs were achieved in the fabricated CsPbBr3 photodetectors. Such performances are much better than those of most perovskite photodetectors from CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, and comparable with the highest results reported on organic–inorganic perovskite photodetectors. This work opens up an exciting opportunity for using all-inorganic perovskites for high-performance and low-cost photodetection applications.
Introduction
In recent years, the newly emerging metal halide perovskite materials have attracted great attention due to their excellent properties such as tunable bandgap, high and well-balanced electron/hole mobilities, large carrier diffusion length, and low-temperature processing technique. This upsurge was initially driven by the perovskite solar cell, which achieved a high power conversion efficiency of above 22% in a short term.1–4 Besides, such lead halide perovskites are suitable candidates for light-emitting diodes,5–8 optical gain media for lasing,9,10 and photodetectors.11,12 Compared to the intensive efforts on solar cells and luminescent fields, the investigation of perovskites as light absorbers in photodetectors is relatively less intensive, and the previous reports focus more on the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. For example, Zhao et al. reported a simple metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) type photodetector based on the CH3NH3PbBr3−xIx thin films, which possessed a photoresponsivity of 55 mA W−1 and a relatively small response time of 20 μs.12 Xie et al. demonstrated a flexible photodetector based on CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, showing a photoresponsivity of 3.49 A W−1 and 0.0367 A W−1 to 365 nm and 780 nm light.13 Deng et al. reported a flexible and semitransparent CH3NH3PbI3 network photodetector, and the photoresponsivity and specific detectivity reached values of 0.1 A W−1 and 1.02 × 1012 Jones, respectively.14 Ma et al. fabricated a planar photodetector based on hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 and a two-dimensional WS2 material, and the response speed and photoresponsivity of the hybrid photodetector were substantially enhanced compared to that of the reference perovskite single layer.15 Lu et al. demonstrated a flexible CH3NH3PbI3 photodetector with high stability, and furthermore all-perovskite self-powered nanosystems were successfully assembled by integrating a perovskite solar cell with a perovskite photodetector.16 Jie et al. reported visible-light photodetectors based on single-crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 microwires with a high photoresponsivity of 13.5 A W−1 and a specific detectivity of 5.25 × 1012 Jones.17 However, the sensitivity of organic–inorganic halide perovskites under oxygen and moist conditions would lead to the instability of the corresponding devices, which is the main obstacle significantly hindering the reliable device operation and their potential applications. Under this circumstance, all-inorganic lead halide perovskites CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, and Cl), as a promising alternative approach, began to attract great scientific attention. However, only a handful of studies have investigated the photoresponse characteristics of the all-inorganic lead halide perovskites CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, and Cl), involving the micro-/nanostructures of CsPbX3 nanorods,18 nanowires,19 single-crystals,20 and nanosheets,21 and there are few studies on CsPbBr3 thin film based photodetectors. Although Li et al. reported the preferred-orientation perovskite thin films by using CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) for the preparation of photodetectors,22 the uniformity and compactness of such light absorption layers remain unsatisfactory and need to be improved. Therefore, the resulting photodetectors in their case demonstrate a relatively low photoresponsivity. From the device application point of view, developing dense and uniform all-inorganic perovskite thin films as light absorbers is imperative for the continued promotion of device performance of the photodetectors.
In this work, we report the prototypical CsPbBr3 thin film photodetectors that were fabricated with a coplanar MSM IDT patterned Au electrode configuration. The CsPbBr3 thin films were prepared by a one-step spin-coating method, which featured a well-compact structure and good optical property. The as-designed photodetectors exhibit an ultrahigh on/off photocurrent ratio of 1.06 × 105, a high responsivity of 55 A W−1, a high specific detectivity of up to 0.9 × 1013 Jones, an EQE of 16700%, and a fast response speed of 430/318 μs. The results obtained not only demonstrate the uniqueness and effectiveness of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite thin films for photodetector applications, but also provide a simple and low-cost method applicable for visible-light optical sensor production.
Experimental
In this work, all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 thin films were synthesized by the one-step spin-coating method, and the perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by mixing CsBr (Aladdin, ≥99.5%) with PbBr2 (Xi' a Polymer Light Technology Corp., ≥99.99%) in a 1:1 molar ratio in dimethyl sulfoxide to give a concentration of 0.33 mol L−1. Fig. 1 shows the main processing steps of the Au/CsPbBr3/Au structured photodetectors. The fabrication procedure started with a commercially available silicon substrate (Fig. 1a), which was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 5 min, respectively. Then, a SiO2 layer with a thickness of ∼200 nm was obtained by thermo-oxidizing silicon in dry oxygen at 1050 °C (Fig. 1b). Thereafter, Au electrodes were patterned by photolithography on the SiO2/Si substrates, and the fingers of Au contact electrodes were 360 μm long and 10 μm wide with a spacing of 5 μm (Fig. 1c). After the process, the CsPbBr3 perovskite thin films were prepared by spin-coating the precursor solutions under conditions involving a low-speed spinning at 500 rpm for 6 s and then a fast-speed spinning at 4000 rpm for 30 s (Fig. 1d). The subsequent drying procedure was carried out at 100 °C for 10 min under a nitrogen atmosphere to evaporate the solvent and to achieve a better coverage (Fig. 1e). The photograph of the fabricated CsPbBr3 thin film photodetector is presented in Fig. 1f.
 Fig. 1  (a–f) Processing procedures for the fabrication of CsPbBr3 thin film photodetectors. 
The microstructures of the produced CsPbBr3 thin films were measured by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Jeol-7500F, 15 keV). The crystallinity was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Panalytical X' Pert Pro). The absorption of the CsPbBr3 thin films was measured using a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrophotometer. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of the CsPbBr3 thin films were recorded using a double grating spectrofluorometer (Horiba; Fluorolog-3). The excitation wavelength was set to 467 nm with a bandpass of 3 nm. The time-resolved PL measurement was performed using a fluorescence lifetime measurement system with a pulsed LED (Horiba; NanoLED, pulse duration: 1.4 ns) as the light source operating at 371 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out with a SPECS XR50 system with Mg-Kα (1254 eV, width 0.7 eV) as the X-ray source. The electrical and optoelectrical measurements were done using a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200-SCS) with a system that combines a monochromator, light sources, an oscilloscope (Tektronix, DPO2012B), an optical chopper (SRS, SR540), and a digital SourceMeter (Keithley 2636B) in air and at room temperature (RT). In this work, a laser diode of 405 nm was employed as the light source in the measurements.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a shows a typical SEM image of the CsPbBr3 thin films, which display a somewhat rough surface but with a high coverage. Note that many isolated cubic grains with a grain size ranging from 200 to 250 nm appear on the top of the underlying thin films, as displayed in the magnified image shown in the inset. The reason for the formation of such crystals is primarily the growth of larger CsPbBr3 crystals at the expense of smaller CsPbBr3 crystals because of their reduced surface energy. Actually, the phenomenon of crystal growth is well-known as Ostwald ripening and similar observations have been reported in other studies.23 We then performed the XRD measurements to identify the crystallographic structure of the CsPbBr3 thin films, as shown in Fig. 2b. The characteristic and dominant diffraction peaks at 15.19° and 30.67° can be readily indexed to the (100) and (200) planes of the crystalline cubic CsPbBr3 structure (a = 2.95 Å), consistent with the diffraction pattern of the bulk materials obtained from the JCPDS database (no. 54-0752). To investigate the surface composition and chemical states of the elements presented in the CsPbBr3 thin films, XPS measurements were therefore performed. Fig. 2c shows the total XPS spectrum of the sample, where the signals related to C, Cs, Pb, and Br were determined. The incorporated Cs, Pb, and Br elements have a molar ratio of 1.00:0.91:2.77, which is very close to the ideal stoichiometry of CsPbBr3 To further confirm the chemical bond configuration of the elements, the bonding states of Br and Pb were fitted by a Voigt type with a Gaussian/Lorenz ratio of 0.7/0.3 using a Shirley baseline. Fig. 2d shows the Pb 4f spectrum of the product (bottom panel), and two separated peaks with binding energies of 135.3 and 140.1 eV can be fitted, corresponding to the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 levels, respectively. Because of the obvious energy differences of the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 levels with those in metallic lead and PbBr2,24,25 we therefore recognize that the contributions of two Pb 4f peaks are associated with the stoichiometry CsPbBr3. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2d, the Br 3d5/2 level has a binding energy of 65.1 eV and a splitting to the Br 3d3/2 level of 1.0 eV, corresponding to the Br−1 state in CsPbBr3.26 To evaluate the optical properties of CsPbBr3 products, both ultraviolet-visible absorption and steady-state PL spectra were characterized at RT. As shown in Fig. 2e, a steep absorption edge is located at about 540 nm, which is in agreement with the previously reported results on solution-processed CsPbBr3 thin films.27 The red line shows the corresponding PL spectrum of the CsPbBr3 sample, which features a highly symmetric emission peak centered at 530 nm with a narrow linewidth of 23 nm. Note that no sub-bandgap emission typically associated with the defects in perovskites was observed in the PL spectrum. Good emission performance with high color purity indicates that the CsPbBr3 thin films have a low defect density, making the materials suitable as effective light absorbers to be employed in photodetectors. To gain more insights into the carrier recombination dynamics of the CsPbBr3 thin films, the time-resolved PL measurement was performed (Fig. 2f). The PL decay from the CsPbBr3 thin films can be fitted with a three-exponential fitting, revealing a component of 2.93 ns (A1 = 22.35), a component of 21.35 ns (A2 = 6.13), and a component of 0.56 ns (A3 = 71.52) in the crystal, and an average PL decay lifetime (τavg.) of 12.73 ns was determined, similar to previously reported results.28

To demonstrate the potential applications of such CsPbBr3 thin films in photoelectric response, a photodetector device was fabricated with a coplanar MSM IDT patterned Au electrode configuration, in which the mixed halide perovskite precursor was spin-coated onto the readily-prepared IDT Au patterns. Fig. 3a depicts the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the device in the dark and under light illumination of 405 nm with different power intensities from 0 to 25.3 mW. It can be seen that the photocurrent of the device gradually increases upon increasing the power intensity, which is because of the number of photogenerated carriers that are proportional to the absorbed photon flux. Note that the photodetector displays a dark current as low as 2.6 × 10−4 μA at 6 V, and the photocurrent is increased by several orders of magnitude at an illumination power of 25.3 mW (27.6 μA). Therefore, the on/off photocurrent ratio of the studied photodetector is 1.06 × 105, much higher than that of other reported perovskite-based photodetectors with a similar MSM structure.12,17,22 An additional observation is that the I–V curves of the studied photodetector are characterized by an asymmetrical behavior even with the symmetry electrode structure, which is likely due to the undesired interface states at the CsPbBr3/Au interface.29 Here, it should be pointed out that the relatively low Schottky contact barrier at the CsPbBr3/Au interface strongly depends on the magnitude of the applied bias. A slightly low external bias can effectively compensate for the energy barrier, and thus the carrier transport or conduction from CsPbBr3 to the contact electrodes takes place. Specifically, the photogenerated electron and hole carriers were transferred at different applied voltages, and finally, the separate electrons and holes were collected at the contact electrodes, leading to an intense increase in the photocurrent, as illustrated by the energy band diagram of the Au/CsPbBr3/Au structure as shown in Fig. 3b. In addition, the dependence of the photocurrent on the light illumination power is plotted on a logarithmic scale in Fig. 3c, which can be expressed by the power law: I = αPβ(1)where α is a constant for a certain wavelength, and the exponent β determines the response of the photocurrent to the light intensity. The best fitting gives a sublinear behavior of β = 0.89. This fractional power dependence (0.5 < β < 1.0) is presumably a result of the complex process of electron–hole generation, recombination, and trapping within a semiconductor.30

(b) Energy band diagrams of the Au/CsPbBr3/Au structure showing the generation, transfer and collection processes of photogenerated carriers. (c) Logarithmic plot of the photocurrent versus illumination power. The curve is fitted well by the power law. (d) Photoresponsivity, specific detectivity, and EQE of the photodetectors versus the illuminated light irradiance. 
Moreover, the photoresponsivity (R) of the photodetectors was calculated as follows: R = (Ip − Id)/Popt·S, where Ip is the photocurrent, Id is the dark current, Popt is the incident light intensity, and S is the effective illuminated area. Fig. 3d shows the relationship of the photoresponsivity with the incident irradiance power, which reaches the maximum value of 55 A W−1 at the incident illumination power of 0.03 mW. Upon increasing the light illumination power to 3.5 mW and above, the photoresponsivity decays and is finally maintained at a steady value of 18 A W−1. Besides, we evaluated the specific detectivity (D*) and the EQE of the photedetector according to the following relations:31 (2) (3) where h and c are the Planck's constant and light speed, and λ is the light wavelength (405 nm). Based on eqn (2) and (3), the relationship of D* and EQE with the incident irradiance power at the bias voltage of 6 V is displayed in Fig. 3d. One can see that both D* and EQE decrease with the increase of irradiance power, and the highest values can be estimated to be 0.9 × 1013 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1) and 16700%, respectively, which are better than most perovskite photodetectors from CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, and comparable with the highest results reported on organic–inorganic perovskite photodetectors (Table 1).

Temporal photoresponse is one of the critical parameters of optoelectronic devices. To illustrate the time response of the CsPbBr3 thin film photodetectors, we measured the current–time (I–T) curves of the photodetector as a function of applied bias, in which a laser diode (405 nm) was employed as the illumination source and the laser pulse bandwidth was maintained at 10 s per cycle. As shown in Fig. 4a, as the laser was turned on, the photocurrent sharply increases with an applied bias voltage because of the increase in carrier drift velocity, and in an extremely brief period the photocurrent increases by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, the studied device was prompt in generating a photocurrent with a stable and reproducible response to on/off cycles, indicating a good light-switching behavior of the as-prepared device. Moreover, the photoresponse of the photodetector at a low bias voltage (1.0 V) at different light irradiance powers was also investigated, as shown in Fig. 4b. One can see that the curves exhibit a prompt and reproducible photocurrent response with a good cycling stability, and meanwhile, the photocurrent increases with increasing the light irradiance power from 0.3 mW to 25 mW.
 Fig. 4  (a) I–T curves of the studied photodetector at different (a) bias voltages and (b) light irradiance power. 
The response speed is another key parameter for a photodetector, which reflects its ability to follow a fast varying optical signal. To record the optical signal faithfully, the photodetector must have a speed higher than the fastest temporal variations in the signal, or equivalently. In this work, we used a mechanical chopper with high frequencies to switch the incident light (405 nm, 26 mW) illuminated on the device, and the photocurrent signals were recorded using an oscilloscope in real time, and the corresponding schematic illustration of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 5a. The characteristic response times of the perovskite photodetectors are extracted at different modulation frequencies ranging from 50 Hz to 3000 Hz. As shown in Fig. 5b–e, the obtained data are normalized according to the highest photocurrent. It can be seen that the device can operate with excellent stability and reproducibility at a wide frequency. More importantly, the relative balance [(Imax − Imin)/Imax] of the photocurrent can be kept at ∼80% at a high frequency of 3000 Hz, implying that the prepared perovskite photodetector can operate at a high frequency, and is capable of monitoring ultrafast optical signals. In addition, according to the photocurrent response profile recorded at 500 Hz, the rise time (tr) of the device (from 10% to 90% of the saturated value) is found to be 430 μs, and the fall time (tf) (from 90% to 10% of the peak value) is about 318 μs, as displayed in Fig. 5f. The asymmetric rise and decay suggest a parabolic optical conductivity detector. It should be mentioned that such device performances are much better than those of most perovskite photodetectors, and a comparison with other reported devices can be found in Table 1.

(f) Rising and falling edges of one response cycle for estimating the response time of the photodetector. 
Even so, we believe that there is still room for improvement in the device performance. Firstly, the contact behavior of electrodes on CsPbBr3 thin films can be further optimized to reduce the undesired interface states at the CsPbBr3/Au interface, where a lot of charge traps exist. Under this circumstance, the responsive photocurrent signals have to firstly compensate for this portion of current loss, and thus leading to a lower photoresponsivity and a slower response.36 Secondly, in our case, the CsPbBr3 thin films are characterized by small crystallites with a high distribution density. Such crystals lack well-defined facets and are randomly packed, and the interfacial areas between these poorly defined crystallines are likely the locations of trap states, and thus the photogenerated carriers could be trapped quickly by the undesired trap states. Therefore, improving the film quality and maintaining an integrity of the CsPbBr3 light absorber is an important pursuit and also a worthwhile subject for a further promotion of the device performance.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a solution-processed synthesis of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 thin films by using the one-step spin-coating method, and furthermore MSM type perovskite photodetectors were fabricated and investigated. The studied photodetectors exhibit a high photoresponsivity of 55 A W−1, an on/off photocurrent ratio of 1.06 × 105, a specific detectivity of up to 0.9 × 1013 Jones, an EQE of 16700%, and a fast response speed of 430/318 μs. The device performances are much better than those of most perovskite photodetectors from CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, and comparable with the highest results reported on organic–inorganic halide perovskite photodetectors. It is anticipated that our results obtained here offer a promising candidate for high-performance and low-cost photodetection applications.
