1. Introduction
Photochemical conversion of solar energy has found broad potential applications, including photocatalytic pollutant removal, photocurrent generation, water splitting, solar cells, and sensors.1–4 Recently, with the increasing attention on artificial photosynthesis and clean hydrogen energy from water and sunlight, nanomaterials with the ability to initiate or promote photochemical reactions have been extensively studied.4,5 Although remarkable progress has been achieved in both the synthetic strategy for advanced nanostructures and the basis of photochemical mechanism, it is still a big challenge to realize practical applicable efficiency for photo-electrical conversion of natural sunlight. Much more effort is still required to understand the primary interaction processes of photons and electrons in the related nanomaterials, and the basic laws for the relationships between the microstructures of materials and their photo-responsive behaviors.
Fabricating advanced nanoarchitectures is regarded as a crucial approach to obtain materials with improved efficiency and stability in photochemical reactions.4,6 In recent years, silver/silver compound (SSC) composites have been extensively researched due to their merits, including high efficiency in photochemical reactions, facile syntheses and availability of raw materials. In fact, most silver compounds possess unique properties such as light sensitivity, electrical and ionic transport behavior, and semiconductor-like features. All of these properties have enabled them to be applied for decades in fields such as electrodes, infrared spectroscopy, radiometry, and heterodyne detection. Moreover, silver halides, i.e. AgX (X = Cl, Br, I), have been utilized in photography for over a century due to the well-known photochemical transformation of AgX, which occurs on exposure of AgX to red light, named as the Herschel effect. However, the study of silver compounds in the field of photochemical water splitting was initiated very recently. In 1999, the pioneering study was conducted by Ashokkumar et al., who studied water splitting by Ag and AgCl colloid and proposed a redox reaction cycle of the AgCl–Ag–AgI system.7 In the same year, Kakuta and Calzaferri's group investigated water splitting over AgBr/SiO2 (ref. 8) and the photoelectrochemical behavior of a AgCl electrode.9 With the improvement of synthetic methods, SSC composites with diverse advanced nanostructures were fabricated. It was found that under illumination of visible light, the SSC composites display efficient activity for organic degradation,10–15 antibacterial,16–18 water splitting19–22 and CO2 reduction,23,24 which stimulated great efforts on such materials, especially on the fabrication of advanced nanostructures with improved performance in photochemical reactions. This review aims to provide a relatively complete and updated summary of the current progress on this type of SSC composites. It will start with the general strategies for the syntheses of SSC composites, and then the methods used to assemble size and morphology tunable nanostructures of two-component SSC (TSSC) and more delicate nanoarchitectures of multi-component SSC (MSSC) composites will be discussed. We will also give an overview on the latest results on the electronic structure-related mechanisms and discuss the photochemical stability of this type of nanocomposite. Finally, some challenges confronted in the application of the SSC composites in photochemical reactions are discussed in the conclusion and outlook section. With this comprehensive review, we hope to provide implications for the development of highly efficient and stable SSC materials for applications in photochemical reactions, as well as to advance further exploration on the controllable mechanisms and novel strategies for chemical conversion of light energy with new materials.
Before reading this review, two things should be specially noted. Firstly, SSC composites in this review include all kinds of contact forms, such as encapsulated core–shell (silver could be core or shell), heterojunction, embedment, isolation, and other more complicated forms for MSSC composites. For conciseness, in most cases we use silver/silver compound for all contact forms, even for the core–shell structure that is frequently reported as silver@silver compound or silver compound@silver. Secondly, although in some reports only silver compounds but not SSC composites are investigated, silver nanoparticles would be generated more or less over the surface of silver compounds upon illumination due to their light sensitivity and self-decomposition behavior. The basic information for some typical silver compounds is shown in Table 1.

2. Synthesis and assembly
Normally, there are three strategies for the synthesis of SSC composites. (1) Reduction process: partially reducing the previous synthesized silver compounds to Ag0 nanoparticles by the addition of chemical reductant (CR), photo-irradiation reduction (PIR) or polyol-assisted reduction (PAR). Among these reduction approaches, PIR is the most frequently used method because it is possible to form a core–shell nanostructure with Ag0 generated over the surface layer via a facile operation. CR is not flexible for morphology control, but has many choices for the reductants such as NaBH4,35L-arginine36,37 and beet juice.38 PAR is a general method to synthesize nanostructural Ag0, which can be applied along with the preparation of AgX in the polyol solution39 or as a separate process for the reduction of any silver compound.40,41 (2) Oxidation process: performing a chemical transformation to form silver compounds from the Ag0 precursor. In this method, the oxidation of Ag0 and the generation of silver compounds are simultaneously achieved by selecting proper oxidizing reagents based on their redox potentials.42 (3) One-pot method: simultaneously generating the composites of silver and silver compounds in a mixture with a certain reducing ability. The reducing ability could be generated by external energy inputs such as microwave43 and sonication44 or by choosing proper additives, such as pyridine45 or ionic liquids,46 which have a mild reducing ability in (hydro/solvo)thermal conditions.
2.1 Two-component SSC (TSSC) composites
Ag/AgX (X = Cl, Br and I) must be some of the most extensively investigated SSC composites due to their exceptionally high photocatalytic activities. Synthesis of AgX nanoparticles is the prerequisite step in the reduction or one pot strategies. Although AgX compounds can be directly prepared by precipitation from Ag+ and X− ions in aqueous solution because of their low solubility (AgCl: 1.9 × 10−3, AgBr: 1.4 × 10−4 and AgI: 3.1 × 10−5 g L−1 at 25 °C), it is still a big challenge to obtain size and morphology controllable AgX nanoparticles because their precipitation reaction is very fast. A few approaches have been developed to slow down the reaction and regulate the nanostructure of AgX, including the addition of surfactants, the replacement of reaction medium with a high viscosity liquid, such as EG or ionic liquid, and the selection of proper reactants.
Surfactants, such as poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA36,47 and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP),39,48 serve as dispersing agents, stabilizers or templates to inhibit agglomeration and assist the nanocrystal oriental growth. With the assistance of PVA, 20 nm AgCl nanoparticles with good dispersion have been obtained by Choi's group.47 In addition, surfactants with halogen anions can be used as both surfactant and reactant. For example, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC),49 hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)23,50–53 and tetra-octylammonium bromide (TAOB)54 have been used as Cl and Br sources for the corresponding AgX nanoparticles. Micelles formed from the aggregation of surfactant molecules are commonly employed to synthesize nanomaterials. By fabricating the micelle and regulating the ratio of oil and water, morphology controllable Ag/AgX nanocomposites can be obtained. An et al. developed a reverse micelle method to synthesize AgCl nanocubes by using NaCl and AgNO3 as the precursors and employing PVP and P-tolyl sulfonic acid to form a reverse micelle.35 The average edge length of as-prepared AgCl is 85 nm, which was partially reduced by NaBH4 to form a Ag/AgCl nanocomposite. An oil-in-water51 or a water-in-oil55 system has been realized by mixing the CTAC chloroform solution and AgNO3 aqueous solution. By tuning the ratio of the oil and water solutions and the concentration of CTAC, spherical or cubic Ag/AgCl nanostructures were produced without further treatments. In addition, Dong et al. proposed a method to synthesize well-defined cubic Ag/AgCl by adding gelatin and precisely controlling a relatively low and constant concentration of [Cl−]. In this method, gelatin serves as a capping agent to promote the orientation growth and restrain the aggregation of AgCl grains.56
Ethylene glycol (EG) has been employed as the solvent to slow down the precipitation and aid the formation of well-defined cube-like AgX nanostructures due to its high viscosity, which is about one order of magnitude higher than that of water.39,57 Moreover, at elevated temperatures the solvent has enough reducing ability to make AgCl partially transform in situ into metallic Ag0 domains or clusters and produce cube-tetrapod morphology Ag/AgX nanocomposites after an Ostwald ripening process.39,58,59 However, well defined nanostructures of Ag/AgCl can be obtained by realizing oriented attachment with the assistance of external energy inputs. Round triangular pyramid and cube-shaped Ag/AgCl hybrids have been obtained in one step treatment under the assistance of microwave irradiation60 and sonication,44 respectively. The reducing radicals generated from EG molecules contribute to the reduction of the surface fraction of AgCl. The SEM images of Ag/AgX with various morphologies are shown in Fig. 1.

Ionic liquids have been widely used as green solvents, templates, stabilizers, reactants or reaction medium for the synthesis of morphology tunable nanomaterials. Most ionic liquids have a viscosity that is 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of traditional solvents.61 Moreover, the halogen-containing ionic liquids can be involved in the reaction of AgX formation, and the reducing ability of ionic liquids makes the generation of Ag0 possible. Therefore, a hydrothermal method was developed to produce Ag/AgX (X = Cl, Br) nanocomposites in one pot by employing the ionic liquids 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Omim]Cl)46 and 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([C16mim]Br)62 as both the precursor and the reducing reagent.
Slower reaction and morphology control for AgX could also be obtained by selecting suitable precursors. With silver acetate and NaCl as the precursors, a template-free direct precipitation method was developed to synthesize cube-like Ag/AgCl nanostructures, in which silver acetate served as both the silver source and the reductant.63 On the other hand, in addition to the Cl- or Br-containing ionic liquid or cation surfactant, other chloride solvents can also be employed as a suitable source. CH2Cl2 is a chloride source in which chloride ion can be released much slower in the reaction. Based on this, Han et al. have proposed a solvothermal method with CH2Cl2 to produce micrometer cube-like AgCl, which was followed by a photoreduction to obtain Ag/AgCl.64
Due to their low solubility, AgX compounds can be easily obtained by an ion-exchange process between X− ions and other precursors of silver compounds, which have relatively higher solubility but can be prepared with more controllable size, better morphology and higher purity. Ag2MoO4 with various nanomorphologies is frequently used as the precursor for the synthesis of AgCl (ref. 15) or AgBr.65 AgCl nanowires can be obtained by ion exchange from the silver molybdate nanowires, which are synthesized by a simple precipitation between Ag+ and MoO42− with tungstosilicic acid as the soft template.66 However, the AgCl nanowires would decompose into nanoparticles when transformed into Ag/AgCl by photoreduction.66 Ion exchange can also be carried out at solid state. Hu et al. developed a one-step solid-state reaction method to convert AgCO3 into Ag/AgCl by grinding it with HONH3Cl at room temperature, in which low valence nitrogen atoms contribute to the reduction and the formation of metallic Ag.67 AgCO3, a semiconductor compound with a band gap of 2.3 eV, is unstable upon illumination;31,68 however, it is an excellent template for the syntheses of porous or hollow nanoarchitectures, because when performing ion exchange and the accompanying acidic etching, AgCO3 would transform into other silver compounds along with CO2 evolution and cavity formation. Hierarchical porous AgCl@Ag was obtained by etching AgCO3 with NH4Cl,69 and porous Ag–Ag2S nanotubes were achieved by microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment of AgCO3 nanorods with thioacetamide.70 In addition, cation exchange is another possible way to fabricate SSC materials. By treating cubic NaCl in AgNO3 solution, core–shell NaCl@AgCl cubes can be obtained by the exchange of Ag+ and Na+. Through the PR or PAR method, the precursor NaCl@AgCl cubes would transform into Ag/AgCl cubic cages.71 These hollow or porous nanoarchitectures always display better photoactivity because of the reflection-enhanced light harvesting efficiency inside the cavities.69–71
The synthesis through an oxidation process from Ag0 is another important strategy. Several in situ chemical oxidation methods have been developed to convert silver nanostructures into SSC composites with high activity in photochemical reactions. Li et al. suggested a method for synthesizing porous Ag/AgCl.72 In this method, nanoporous silver was obtained by dealloying Ag20Al80 alloy foils in NaOH solution, and then it was added into a mixed solution of H2O2 and HCl to make Ag0 partially transform into AgCl. Herein, Ag0 is a catalyst for H2O2 decomposition; however, the presence of Cl− would promote the oxidation half-reaction due to the formation of AgCl (eqn (1) and (2)). 2Ag+ + H2O2 + 2H+ → 2Ag+ + 2H2O(1) (2)
Silver nanowire can be achieved by reducing AgNO3 in polyol solution with the presence of PVP at a temperature as high as 160 °C,42 while silver microsphere can be prepared by reducing AgNO3 with ascorbic acid and citric acid.73 Based on these nanostructural silver compounds, a core–shell Ag/AgCl nanoarchitecture can be fabricated by oxidizing Ag precursors with FeCl342,73 or ionic liquid [Bmim]FeCl4.74 According to the redox potentials of E0AgCl/Ag = +0.223 V vs. SHE and , Ag0 at the surface of such nanostructures can be oxidized into AgCl by Fe3+in situ, as described in Scheme 1. Moreover, it was found that by treating Ag precursor with the solution containing X− anion and other metallic cation Mn+, Ag/AgX nanocomposites with various morphologies can be obtained. The structure depends greatly on the redox potentials of AgX/Ag and metal ions, which influence the oxidation rates of Ag.42 Furthermore, commercial Ag foil or plate can be directly used as the precursor. AgBr nanowire was synthesized by treating Ag foil in a solution of Fe(NO)3, NaBr and PVP, because the potential of the AgBr/Ag pair (+0.007 V vs. SHE) is much lower than that of Fe3+/Fe2+.75 AgCl concave cubes that preferentially grow along (111) and (110) directions can be achieved by treating an Ag plate in a mixed solution of NaClO2, NaCl and citric acid.76 With a similar method but using excess Cl− ions to decrease the surface energy of Ag (111) facets, a 3D AgCl hierarchical superstructure with more exposed high-index facets was obtained.77 In addition, silver in [Ag(NH3)]+ complex can also be oxidized by O2, because the redox potential of the O2/OH− pair (+0.401 V vs. SHE) is slightly higher than that of the [Ag(NH3)]+/Ag pair (+0.373 V vs. SHE). Based on this, by treating Ag nanowires with [Ag(NH3)]+ complex and Na2HPO4, a necklace-like nanoheterostructure with submicro-cube Ag3PO4 growth on Ag nanowires was obtained,78 and when enough capping agent (PVP) was added in the solution, core–shell coaxial Ag3PO4/Ag hetero-nanowires could be synthesized (Fig. 2).79 In addition to chemical oxidation methods, a electrochemical anodic oxidation method was developed by Huang's group.80 With the bulk Ag sheet as the anode and NaCl + Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte, by adjusting the voltage and the concentration of electrolyte, uniform AgCl nanocubes can be controllably synthesized according to an interface kinetic–diffusion reaction mechanism.80

It has been found that high energy facets possess higher activity in catalytic reactions and the synthesis of (001) facet dominant anatase TiO2 has become a popular strategy for synthesizing high performance TiO2.81 However, the synthesis of nanomaterials with dominant high energy facets is a challenge due to the instability of these facets, especially in silver compounds; moreover, there are only a few studies on this subject. Through an ionic liquid-assisted hydrothermal method, Lou et al. investigated the role of ionic liquids as the oriented growth regulators and found that the length of the [Cxmim]Cl alkyl chains has a great influence on the morphology of as-synthesized AgCl. With longer alkyl chains (C12 and C16), near-spherical AgCl nanoparticles with exposed (001) facets were formed, which showed higher activity than the traditional (100)-exposed cubic AgCl nanocrystal.82 By controlling the growth of Ag2O microcrystals with various complexing agents, Wang et al. synthesized single facet-exposed Ag2O microcrystals, including (100) cubes, (110) rhombic dodecahedra and (111) octahedral, in which (100) cubes showed the best photocatalytic activity due to the highest surface energy of the (100) facet.83 The Ag2O morphology-dependent photocatalytic activity of methyl orange degradation rate is shown in Table 2.83 Moreover, AgBr with various dominant facets can be synthesized in dimethyl sulfoxide solution at various temperature, and it was found that the completely (111)-bound AgBr octahedra showed the highest photocatalytic activities.84 In addition, AgBr nanoplates or polyhedrons possessing increased percentages of (111) facet exposure and displaying enhanced photocatalytic performances can be synthesized by precipitating AgBr in EG solution with PVP as the capping agent.85,86 Although the studies on the exposure of high energy facets and the control of crystal morphology have made great progress,82–87 the underlying mechanism still requires much more investigation. In a recent theoretical study by Ma et al., the surface energies, adsorption energy and total energy for different surfaces upon adsorption of Cl in AgCl were compared, and these provided important intrinsic information to understand the tunable growth of AgX crystal, which can be experimentally achieved by adjusting the concentration of halogen ions.88

According to above strategies, in addition to the most frequently investigated AgX, Ag2O, Ag2CO3 and Ag3PO4, other silver compounds, such as Ag3VO4,89 Ag2S,28,29,70 Ag2Mo3O10,90 Ag2MoO4,33 Ag2CrO4,91,92 Ag2SiO3 and Ag9(SiO4)2NO3,20 silver-containing polyoxometalate,92–94 and the corresponding SSC composites have been developed. According to a comparison study by Huang et al., the photocatalytic ability of SSC depends greatly on the negatively charged ions; i.e., higher stability and larger charged anions result in better photocatalytic performance.92 A comparison study between these SSC materials could offer abundant implications for the relationships in the crystal structure-dependent photochemical performance.
2.2 Multi-component SSC (MSSC) composites
To further improve the activity and stability, a large number of multi-component SSC composites with diverse structures and properties have been studied. Immobilizing SSC composites over a substrate is the most commonly used method. The substrate could be a chemically stable photo-inert material with a large surface area, such as mesoporous silica (MCM-41 (ref. 13 and 95) and SBA-15 (ref. 96)), carbon materials (carbon nanotube,24,97–99 active carbon100,101 and graphene or reduced graphene oxide (RGO)21,55,100–117), ordered mesoporous γ-Al2O3,118–123 layered double hydroxide (LDH),124,125 clay126,127 or other materials.128–131 The substrate could also be an efficient semiconductor photocatalyst with any morphology, including TiO2,11,16,17,51–53,132–150 WO3,151–155 Bi2WO6,156,157 Bi2MoO6,158 Bi20TiO32,159 BiVO4,96 ZnO,22,160–163 γ-TaON,164 layered compound K4Nb6O17,165,166 g-C3N4,167–169 BiOX,26,170–176 and W18O49.177,178 The main functions of these substrates include providing a high surface area, assisting dispersion, facilitating photogenerated charge separation or electron transportation, enwrapping or covalently binding SSC to improve their stability, or simultaneously serving as a capping reagent to regulate the growth of silver compounds.
Normally, most MSSC composites can be obtained by employing the as-prepared substrate in the growth of silver or silver compounds following the same methods as used in the synthesis of TSSC. When the substrate is characterized as a two-dimensional structure, such as the films of self-organized TiO2 nanotubes, nanopores or nanorods,133,148 or cotton fabric,131,149 the growth of silver compounds over the surface or inside the nanotubes can be achieved by a facile sequential chemical bath deposition. When the substrates are characterized as layered structures, such as LDH124,125 or K4Nb6O17,165,166 which always possess excellent ion-exchange ability, the cations in the substrates can be directly utilized for the formation of silver compounds with the addition of Ag+, or Ag+ can be inserted into the substrate by a facile ion-exchange process, followed by the deposition of silver compounds.
Furthermore, by combining various strategies such as heterojunction, solid solution and Z-scheme design, MSSC composites with more delicate nanoarchitectures and better performance can be developed. Ag/AgX/BiOX (X = Cl, Br and I) is an interesting type of MSSC composite with improved activity, which can be facilely synthesized via a one-pot coprecipitation method with the same halide as the source.26,171,176 Moreover, it was found that the composites obtained by an in situ ion exchange reaction between AgNO3 and BiOX displayed enhanced photocatalytic performance, and this was attributed to the smaller sizes of AgX.170,172 Ion exchange is also an effective approach to synthesize hetero-structures of multiple silver compounds, such as the heterojunctions of (AgX/Ag3PO4)/(Ag)179,180 and Ag@(Ag2S/Ag3PO4),181 solid solutions like Ag–AgCl1−xBrx (ref. 182) or a Z-scheme structure like AgI/Ag/AgBr.183 Ag3PO4 is slightly soluble in aqueous solution (0.02 g L−1).179 By an ion exchange reaction between the as-prepared rhombic dodecahedral Ag3PO4 crystal and sodium halide, AgX/Ag3PO4 core–shell heterocrystals can be obtained, among which AgBr/Ag3PO4 displays the best activity for photocurrent generation and methyl orange photocatalytic degradation.179 The presence of AgX nanoshells on the surface not only prevents the dissolution of Ag3PO4, but also promotes photogenerated electrons and holes to separate into the hetero components at the interface due to their matched band potential offsets.179,184 Recently, a facile phase transformation route by the calcination of Ag2CO3 was proposed to synthesize Ag2O/Ag2CO3 heterojunctions, which display enhanced activity and stability in the photocatalytic reactions.185 It could be a possible way to fabricate the composites with silver oxides and other thermo decomposable silver compounds.
The superior electron conductivity of Ag0 nanoparticles enables the MSSC composite to possibly form a Z-scheme photocatalytic nanostructure, which is similar to the two-photon process of Z-scheme in the natural photosynthesis of green plants. Fig. 3 shows a conceptual diagram of a Z-scheme photocatalytic system, which consists of two semiconductor components and a redox mediator with matched redox potential.186 In this system, both the components are excited: on one side, electrons contribute to hydrogen evolution and holes to the oxidation of the redox mediator, whereas on the other side, holes oxidize water to produce oxygen and electrons induce the reduction of the redox mediator to maintain its stability in the solution. According to this mechanism, such a Z-scheme system is especially suitable for water splitting, because the separation of oxygen and hydrogen evolution can be carried out on two visible light responsive semiconductors with relatively narrow band gaps. A MSSC composite with components having matched band potentials can be regarded as a solid state Z-scheme, in which silver nanoparticles serve as the redox mediator for electron transfer from the CB of one component to the VB of the other one, as the gold nanoparticles in the three-component nanojunction system of CdS–Au–TiO2 (Fig. 3).187 Therefore, electrons and holes can be separated efficiently, and electrons and holes maintain better reduction and oxidation power. MSSC photocatalysts, such as Ag/AgBr/BiOBr,26 AgI/Ag/AgBr,183 H2WO4·H2O/Ag/AgCl (ref. 188) and Ag–AgCl@Bi20TiO32,159 have been reported as Z-scheme systems. However, more evidence such as photonic efficiency and the potentials of conduction bands and valence bands of the corresponding components should be measured to confirm the Z-scheme-like structures in these SSC composites.

3. Electronic structure of SSC composites
There is little basic information on the semiconductor properties (such as p-type, n-type) and parameters (such as band potentials) of silver compounds, which could be attributed to the light sensitive property and impurity of silver compounds under irradiation. This is also a reason for the inconsistency in band gaps obtained from the DRS measurements by different groups. eqn (3) has been proposed to estimate the band potentials of semiconductor oxides, and the estimated data are always acceptable for comparison.189 This equation has also been generalized to estimate the band potentials for all types of silver compounds. However, it should be noted that the calculated data according to this equation can only be compared with each other, but they should not be compared with the redox potential of chemicals. According to this equation, the band potentials of several silver compounds have been calculated in Table 1. E0CB = X − EC − 1/2Eg(3)where X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor, which is expressed as the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the atoms; EC is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV); and Eg is the band gap of the semiconductor compound.
First-principle calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool to reveal the origin of the visible light responsive photocatalytic activity of SSC composites. In an earlier study by Calzaferri's group,190 a self-sensitization mechanism was proposed according to the theoretical calculation of the Ag115–(AgCl)192 aggregate, in which the sensitization was attributed to the newly generated metal-induced gap states in the energy gap of AgCl and the metal-induced d states.189 However, this mechanism is not clear enough to understand their electronic structure-dependent principle in photochemical reactions and the detailed function of silver nanoparticles. More recently, the photocatalytic performance and stability of Ag/AgCl were revealed through a study on the adsorption of Ag clusters on the AgCl surface and the energy transfer at the interface by DFT calculations, and the thermodynamically stable structure with the cluster sizes has been understood. It was found that hot holes on Ag clusters can transfer into surface Cl ions, producing high oxidative Cl atoms, and more electron–hole pairs can also generated at the interface by the interaction between the plasmonic Ag clusters and the Cl ions.191
The highly dispersive conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are always beneficial for the transportation of photoexcited electrons and holes, respectively. Theoretical studies on Ag3PO4 show that the presence of PO4 tetrahedral units weakens the covalent nature of Ag–O bonds and inhibits the hybridization of Ag d and O p orbits.30,192 Therefore, the CBM of Ag3PO4 is mainly composed of highly dispersive 5s and 5p bands.192,193 On the other hand, the mobility of carriers depends greatly on their effective masses, which can be calculated by fitting parabolic functions to the CBM and VBM along various directions. The effective mass of electrons for TiO2 is about 1.0me.194 However, most silver compounds display much smaller effective masses of electrons [∼0.6, ∼0.6, ∼0.4, ∼0.25, ∼0.18, ∼0.15 and ∼0.13me for Ag2O, Ag2SiO3, Ag3PO4, AgCl, AgBr, AgI (wurtzite) and AgI (zinc blend)], which contributes to the high mobility of photoexcited electrons in these compounds.20,192,195 On the other hand, the structural reasons for the small effective masses of electrons in silver compounds were attributed to the three-dimensional d10–d10 interaction and the relatively short Ag–Ag bonds, which are also advantageous for the reduced band gaps and the dispersion of conduction bands.20 In addition, another reason for the efficient photocatalytic performance of Ag3PO4 was ascribed to the inductive effect of PO43−; i.e., the large negative charge and electron cloud overlapping of PO43− prefers to attract holes and repel electrons.193
It is interesting that SSC composites display exceptional activity for organic degradation under visible light irradiation, even when the wide band gap silver compounds, such as AgCl, do not respond to visible light. Recently, the plasmon-enhanced photochemical reaction mechanism over the noble metal nanoparticles such as Au, Ag, and Cu, has been widely studied.196,197 Although the contribution of the plasmonic resonance effect of Ag nanoparticles to the photochemical reaction of SSC composites is still not confirmed, it was proven that the injection rate of photoinduced energetic electrons from Ag nanoparticles to AgCl is very fast; moreover, by transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy measurement the injection rate has been observed to be far less than 150 fs. Furthermore, the electric field near the interface of Ag/AgCl is significantly enhanced, as shown in Fig. 4, by an electric field distribution simulation via the 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.71 Revealing the detailed mechanism and photochemical processes of such SSC composites is still a big challenge and thus attracting significant interest.

4. Stability
Although high photocatalytic activity is the ultimate goal for these materials, stability is the priority to ensure their applicability. It is well known that most silver compounds are light sensitive and prone to decompose into metallic Ag when exposed to light. To maintain the stability of silver compounds, the reduction of Ag+ in the lattice by the photogenerated electrons must be suppressed. This could be achieved by facilitating the transfer of electrons through the introduction of an electron scavenger such as AgNO3 in the reaction solution31 or over the surface such as the Fe(III) cocatalyst.198 However, the photostability of silver compounds can also be much improved by a self-stable mechanism25,199 or by immobilization on the surface of special oxides such as TiO2.200 The self-stabilizing process of Ag2O has been revealed by Yu et al., as shown in Fig. 5.25 In the first several cycles upon irradiation, the photogenerated electrons on the CB will be captured by the lattice Ag+ to form metallic Ag, which is more efficient than the transfer process to oxygen. Then, metallic Ag rapidly formed over the Ag2O surface plays a role as an electron sink to facilitate the electron scavenging by oxygen, thus inhibiting the reduction of Ag+ in the lattice and suppressing the further decomposition of Ag2O.25 A similar self-stabilizing process can be considered for other silver compounds according to their band potentials. The photodecomposition of silver compounds can also be inhibited when they are immobilized on a semiconductor oxide such as TiO2. It was found that the surface defects of I− vacancy (Ag+–IV−–Ag+) are a deep electron trap for the production of metallic Ag and initiation of the decomposition of AgI. However, when immobilized over TiO2, the vacancies in AgI are replaced by Ag+–O2−–Ti4+ bonds on the interface, contributing to a photostable AgI/TiO2 composite.200 More efforts are still required to understand the photochemical process of SSC composites and design more stable advanced SSC composites.

5. Conclusions and outlook
SSC composites have stimulated broad interest in the assembly of novel silver compound-based composites for photochemical reactions, which has provided an opportunity to study photochemical reactions from a new perspective. In our review, we have introduced synthetic strategies that are used to tailor the sizes and shapes of SSC nanoarchitectures, and summarized the recent advancement in their electronic structure-related mechanisms in photocatalytic reactions and their stability. Although significant enhancement in efficiency has been achieved by tuning the microstructures and compositions of SSC composites, several challenges in SSC composites must be overcome before scalable applicable technology can be realized in the near future.
First, to understand the primary photochemical processes in SSC composites requires interdisciplinary knowledge from subjects such as physics, chemistry, and material science. Although major progress has been achieved on the enhanced performance of plasmon-enhanced photochemical reactions of metallic nanoparticles,195,201 the relationships between the plasmon-related processes of silver nanoparticles and the photochemical mechanism of the SSC composites are still not clear. Much more effort should be taken to build up a comprehensive theoretical scheme to bridge the gaps between photon-related physics and electron-dependent chemistry. The latest progress on the photon-related physics, such as plasmonic absorption, photon crystallization, and semiconductor excitation, combined with the current development of the theory calculation methods, should be systematically considered and applied for an in-depth investigation. Second, although a large number of SSC composites have been synthesized with enhanced efficiency, there is still an urgent need to develop industry applicable SSC composites through controllable approaches. To achieve this, not only the efficiency, but also other aspects such as cost and stability should be considered. Stability must be one of the most important factors that should be focused on, because in most cases, silver nanoparticles are susceptible to oxidation, while silver compounds are sensitive to light and decompose to Ag0. Moreover, catalysts are always slightly dissoluble in water, making them particularly unstable for applications in aqueous solution. However, this could possibly be addressed by fabricating innovative nanostructures with a different metal (Au/Ag/Cu/Al) or constructing smart photochemical systems based on the basic knowledge of SSC composites and practical situations, including the introduction of an electron scavenging center to promote electron transfer, the incorporation of a protective shell layer, or the assembly of heterojunctions and photo(electro)catalytic components to regulate the pathway of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Finally, due to the great significance of solar fuel, there is still plenty of room for studies of SSC materials toward the capture and conversion of solar energy. Theoretically, high efficiency can also be achieved for water splitting or CO2 conversion if we can properly regulate the redox potentials of photogenerated charges in the SSC materials. A breakthrough could be made if the questions regarding how to manipulate the photon–electron interaction at the interface and how to regulate the multi-photon and multi-electron processes can be answered. It is worth noting that photochemical conversion of solar energy is a complicated process, and in addition to the abovementioned tentative challenges, many more difficulties will be faced. However, it can be expected that SSC composites would be an indispensible gem in this field, and help much in better understanding of the primary processes of photochemical reactions.
