    , Accepted 28th June 2015First published on 30th June 2015AbstractIn this study, we demonstrate the template-mediated flux growth of one-dimensional LiCoO2 single crystals surrounded by {104} faces in a hot solution of LiCl–KCl. The reaction and growth processes were characterized by time-dependent X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The transformation in the crystal shape from rectangular to hexagonal cylindrical was considered to be directly related to the gradual lithiation of the starting CoO whiskers. Single particle galvanostatic tests of the single-strand LiCoO2 crystals were carried out. The LiCoO2 crystals exhibited excellent rate performance and more than 65% of the full capacity was maintained under ca. 370C. These characteristics likely resulted from the exposure of the {104} faces, since they were electrochemically active in layered LiCoO2 with an α-NaFeO2 structure and favored fast Li+ transportation. This finding will facilitate the development of new materials for advanced lithium ion rechargeable batteries.
Introduction
The shape-controlled synthesis of inorganic materials can influence many geometry-sensitive physical and chemical properties including luminescence, catalytic activity, surface energy, solubility, and conductivity of electrons and ions.1–7 For example, quantum confinement of quantum dots, shape-dependent localized surface plasmon resonance in metal nanoparticles, and plane-sensitive catalytic activities have been developed by colloid chemists in the last decade. Advanced functional devices and catalysts such as quantum dot LEDs, lasers, solar cells, probes for biological diagnostic applications, Raman spectroscopy-enhancing materials, and activity-enhanced ORR catalysts have also been proposed.8–15 Very recently, researchers investigating secondary battery applications have confronted the urgent need to improve the specific power density of rechargeable batteries. Shape-controlled electrode active materials, including nanocrystals, nanoporous materials, and nanotubes have been investigated for the improvement of battery performance in terms of their enhanced charge–discharge rates, cycle stability, relatively flat charge–discharge plateau, thermal stability, and cation ordering.16–25 Most shape-controlled crystals are synthesized via low-temperature processes such as polyol, sol–gel, hot-injection, and hydro- or solvothermal syntheses. However, as Zhou mentioned in the literature, high-temperature sintering processes are necessary to enhance crystallinity as well as to produce high-performance electrode active materials based on crystals such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiFePO4, and Li4Ti5O12.26–29 However, such high-temperature sintering processes simultaneously lead to a large grain size and aggregation, which result in poor performance due to the increased lithium ion diffusion path, decreased contact with the electrolyte, and increased interfacial resistance. Thus, the synthesis of high-quality crystalline electrode materials with distinct shapes constitutes a major challenge in obtaining high-performance materials. As such, flux growth methods have recently garnered significant attention in the preparation of high-quality crystals for lithium ion battery applications. The flux growth method is the only way to obtain idiomorphic crystals without any thermal strain or defects from the liquid phase, and thus is quite advantageous as compared to other techniques.30 For instance, the flux growth of NaCl, NaCl–KCl, and LiCl–KCl enabled the growth of layered LiCoO2, octahedral spinel LiMn2O4, and Li4Ti5O12 crystals, which showed enhanced charge–discharge rates, cycle stability, and selective tolerance towards the loss of electrolyte-soluble transition metal ions in the crystals.31–34
Among the many potential shapes, one-dimensional crystals are the most attractive because such ultra-long anisotropic crystals are expected to suppress aggregation and grain growth at high temperatures, possibly leading to decreased electronic resistance, as well as the formation of short circuits resulting from the penetration of active materials through the separator. However, the synthesis of one-dimensional single crystals with rhombohedral or cubic structures is difficult due to their crystallographic characteristics. Specifically, these crystals cannot naturally grow in a one-dimensional direction. Even though only a few papers regarding the hydrothermal synthesis of nanowires, nanorods, and branches composed of rhombohedral and cubic crystals have been reported, the relationship between the structure and electrochemical properties of crystals is not well understood because of the poor crystal quality (i.e., formation of polycrystals, agglomeration, and lack of a uniform shape).20–22,26 Here, we designed a strategic flux growth method to produce hexagonal cylindrical LiCoO2 crystals, which were dominantly surrounded by {104} faces via the conversion of CoO whiskers into self-sacrificing templates in a chloride solution at high temperatures.
In this method, we used CoO whiskers grown from LiCl and Co powder in a LiCl–KCl mixed flux. Vapor grown carbon fibers (VGCFs) played a key role in the growth of CoO whiskers. Curved imaging plate X-ray diffraction (IP-XRD) and TEM observations revealed that CoO whiskers formed one-dimensional wires, with a flat rectangular cross-section which was dominantly covered with {110} faces and was grown along the 〈111〉 direction. The details regarding the synthetic procedures and crystallographic characterization of CoO whiskers are described elsewhere.
Results and discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the successful growth of one-dimensional LiCoO2 single crystals using the flux growth method. Fig. 1 displays the XRD profiles of the as-obtained product. All diffraction lines were in agreement with the ICDD data for LiCoO2. Since the diffraction lines of CoO were not observed, single-phase LiCoO2, which belongs to the Rm space group, was formed. Notably, the relative intensities of the diffraction lines at 2θ = 18.93/45.26 assigned to 003LiCoO2 and 104LiCoO2 were less than those of the ICCD data, suggesting that the LiCoO2 crystals were dominantly covered with 104LiCoO2 faces. The lattice parameters were determined as a = 2.819 and c = 14.063 Å.

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the as-prepared LiCoO2 crystals and CoO whiskers. The LiCoO2 crystals resembled ultra-long wires, and maintained the one-dimensional structure of the CoO whiskers. Their average diameter and length were slightly larger at 2.5 μm and >550 μm, respectively, possibly due to the penetration of Li ions into the cubic CoO lattice. Their magnified and cross-sectional profiles, as evaluated by SEM, illustrated the unique nature of one-dimensional LiCoO2 crystals. Specifically, individual LiCoO2 crystals formed unusual structures in which numerous hexagonal plate-shaped crystals were stacked face-to-face one-dimensionally. Typically, LiCoO2 crystals that form hexagonal platelet-shaped crystals are seen in liquid phase growth. It is well known that the hexagonal shape surrounded by a large c-plane is the result of a thermodynamically favored state produced under an oxidative atmosphere. Therefore, the transformation of the cross-section from the flat rectangular shape of CoO whiskers into the hexagonal shape of LiCoO2 crystals in the molten LiCl–KCl mixed salt was reasonable and reflected the changes in the crystal structure from the cubic system of CoO to the rhombohedral system of LiCoO2.

We performed imaging plate XRD (IP-XRD) measurements in order to elucidate the crystallographic nature of single-strand LiCoO2 crystals. The X-ray beam was incident on the surface of the one-dimensional LiCoO2 crystal, perpendicular to its longitudinal direction. As shown in Fig. 3A, three strong diffraction lines from the 101LiCoO2, 104LiCoO2, and 107LiCoO2 faces were observed under the limited diffraction conditions. Owing to the disappearance of the diffraction line corresponding to the 003LiCoO2 face in the IP-XRD profile compared to that of the powder XRD shown in Fig. 1, the longitudinal direction of LiCoO2 crystals was assigned to the 〈001〉 direction. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns coupled with TEM images were obtained for several regions of one-dimensional LiCoO2 crystals to further elucidate their crystallographic nature. We adjusted the electron beam to graze the crystal surface. Fig. 3C represents the SAED patterns obtained for the single LiCoO2 crystal, indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3B. Periodically ordered diffraction spots were observed without any additional spots or diffuse streaks, indicating that the one-dimensional LiCoO2 crystal had high crystallinity. The diffraction spots were indexed as belonging to the [21] zone axis of single crystal LiCoO2, which confirmed that the LiCoO2 crystal was a single crystal and the surface was covered with {102} and {1–18} faces.

To gain insight into the conversion mechanism responsible for this unusual morphology, we performed in situ XRD measurements and carried out time-dependent ex situ SEM observations. The samples were heated to designated temperatures, and were rapidly quenched with cool water prior to the SEM observations. As shown in Fig. 4, the reaction was initiated at 800 °C, which was similar to the melting point of the NaCl flux. The diffraction lines were assigned to rocksalt-CoO, rocksalt-Li0.14Co0.86O, and minor rhombohedral LiCoO2. With an increased holding temperature of 900 °C, the lithiation reaction progressed sequentially. Notably, the LiCoO2 phase was the major product during the early stages of the reaction, even though the incompletely lithiated and unreacted CoO phase remained. This implied that the diffusion of Li+ in the solid CoO whisker limited the reaction rate. Thus, the phase change from rocksalt to rhombohedral proceeded from the surface and the CoO phase remained at the core of the crystal. Fig. 5 shows a schematic illustration of the cleavage face of (211)CoO and (21)LiCoO2. No significant changes in the arrangement of Co and O atoms occurred, even though the distance of the O–Co–O plane in CoO became slightly smaller and the symmetry of the unit cell was distorted due to the differences in the ionic radii of Co2+ in CoO and Co3+ in LiCoO2. This suggested that the CoO {110} faces were favorable for the conversion to LiCoO2, as they maintained the original one-dimensional shape.

Next, we carried out time-dependent SEM observations coupled with XRD measurements for further understanding the conversion mechanism and shape transformation. All samples were prepared individually prior to each SEM observation by quenching the reaction with cool water. There were many holes on the CoO whisker surface, which were not observed on the initial flat CoO whiskers (Fig. 6A and B). These holes may have originated as a result of the formation of LiCoO2 and rocksalt-Li0.14Co0.86O, which would lead to a reduction in volume and lattice distortion in CoO crystals. The roughness of the surface increased with the increase of holding time. The lattice distortion and further Li+ penetration promoted drastic morphological changes (Fig. 6C). A sharp zig-zag, step-like morphology was formed on the surface as lithiation proceeded. After CoO crystals were fully lithiated, the LiCoO2 formed an unusual structure in which numerous hexagonal plate-shaped crystals with sharp asymmetrical edges were stacked one-dimensionally (Fig. 6D and E). CoO and LiCoO2 exhibited low solubility in the LiCl–KCl flux, which we believe promoted the lithiation reaction while maintaining the original one-dimensional structure. The shape deformation possibly depended on the minimization of the surface-free energy of LiCoO2 crystals via the dissolution and precipitation reaction of minute amounts of LiCoO2, which were dissolved in the flux.

Single particle galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed to study the intrinsic electrochemical properties of one-dimensional LiCoO2 crystals.35–38 A single LiCoO2 crystal was brought into contact with a micro Pt electrode with a diameter of 20 μm in an electrolyte composed of ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 v/v), containing 1 M of LiPF6. Fig. 7A shows the first 50 charge and discharge curves, measured at 3 nA for both charging and discharging in the potential range of 2.0–4.2 V vs. Li/Li+. The 3 nA corresponds to ca. 8.6C rate, because the average specific capacity was estimated to be ca. 0.35 nA. One C rate indicates the current required to obtain a full charge in 1 h. Although some irreversible capacity was observed in the first cycle, excellent reversibility with a high coulombic efficiency was observed after the second cycle even with a relatively high C rate. This result implies that the ultra-long LiCoO2 crystal was stable during 50 cycles of the rapid LiCoO2 ⇄ Li0.50CoO2 + 0.5 Li+ + 0.5 e− reaction. The average specific capacity was estimated to be ca. 0.35 nA h. Fig. 7B shows the discharge curves measured at various currents ranging from 5 nA to 300 nA, corresponding to C rates of 1 to 429. The crystal was charged galvanostatically at 1 nA up to 4.2 V vs. Li/Li+ prior to all discharge measurements. Amazingly, the one-dimensional LiCoO2 crystal maintained more than 65% of the full capacity at 300 nA discharge (only 8 s). These electrochemical responses are significantly better than those of commercially available LiCoO2, as shown in Fig. 7C. The LiCoO2 polycrystal prepared via a solid-state reaction showed more than 50% loss of the full capacity at 300 nA, corresponding to 370C. This result suggests that the crystal orientation of the LiCoO2 crystal resulted in a better rate performance than that of the commercially available crystal. Because the electrode potential dropped as the current increased, there was a gradient in the concentration of Li in the single particle. Li+ diffusion in the solid phase is slower than that in a liquid electrolyte, suggesting that the rate performance should be influenced by the Li+ transfer process at the interface between active material crystals and liquid electrolytes, as well as the Li+ diffusion process from the surface to the center of the crystals. Fig. 7D shows the capacity retention depending on the discharge current of both one-dimensional and commercially available irregular LiCoO2. Assuming that the simple diffusion of Li+ ion occurs in the particle two-dimensionally from the surface to the center, the apparent diffusion coefficient of Li+ ions in LiCoO2 crystals can be estimated as follows: the diffusion length L is expressed as L = (4Dt)1/2, where D is the apparent diffusion coefficient and t is time for diffusion.39,40L is the radius of the one-dimensional LiCoO2 particle (2.8 μm). In the case of 30 nA discharging, no discharge capacity loss was observed, and the time required for the discharge was 84 s. Therefore, this implies that a Li+ ion can diffuse from the surface to the center of the one-dimensional LiCoO2 particle in 84 s. The apparent diffusion coefficient of Li+ in the particle is 2.3 × 10−10 cm s−1 based on those values. It is compatible with the apparent diffusion coefficient in other reports, which used the same technique for commercial LiCoO2 particles.35

Experimental
Synthetic procedures
In a typical synthesis, 0.01 g of CoO whiskers and 0.01 g of LiOH·H2O were gently mixed with 0.15 g of NaCl for 30 min using an agate mortar. The molar ratio of CoO and LiOH·H2O was 1:2. The Co concentration in the mixture was controlled to be 5 mol%. The homogeneous mixture was placed in a 30 cm3 Pt crucible. The loosely closed crucible was then placed in an electric furnace, heated to 900 °C at a rate of 900 °C min−1, and held at that temperature for 5 h. The crucible was cooled to 500 °C at a rate of 200 °C h−1. Finally, the crucible was naturally cooled to room temperature in the furnace. The crystals were separated from the remaining flux mixture using warm water. The morphology and average size of the grown LiCoO2 crystals were characterized using field-emission-type scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL, JSM-7600F); the microscope was operated at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The phases and structures of the crystals were identified using X-ray diffraction analysis performed with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The X-ray diffractometer (XRD, RIGAKU, SmartLab) and imaging plate XRD (IP-XRD, RIGAKU, RINT RAPID) were operated at 30 kV and 20 mA, with 2θ being in the range of 10–80°. The crystallographic characteristics of the LiCoO2 crystal were characterized by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010).
Single particle galvanostatic tests
A Pt micro-wire with a 20 μm diameter was sealed in a glass capillary.35 The tip of the glass-sealed Pt micro-wire was cut to yield a micro-disk, and then polished carefully to a mirror face. The single particle measurement system was operated in a dry room. The micro-electrode was manipulated by using a micromanipulator (QP-2RH, Microsupport) to contact the probe with a single-strand LiCoO2 crystal under optical microscope (BX-51, Olympus) observation. The electrolyte composed of ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 v/v), containing 1 M of LiPF6, was from Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd. The counter electrode was a Li foil supplied by Honjo Metal Co., Ltd and the electrochemical measurements were performed with a two electrode system. The galvanostatic charging (lithiation) tests were carried out with an electrochemical analyzer (ALS600D, BAS Inc.) up to 0.01 V vs. Li/Li+. The temperature was maintained at 295 K in a dry room.
Conclusions
We have shown experimentally the discovery of the previously unknown hexagonal cylindrical LiCoO2 single crystal covered with {104} faces and its unusually high electrochemical performances. The one-dimensional LiCoO2 crystal surrounded by large {104} faces can be prepared by template-mediated growth in a hot LiCl–KCl flux. The halide-flux growth approach with weak solvency power enabled the formation of LiCoO2 having an unusual structure in which numerous hexagonal plate-shaped crystals with sharp asymmetrical edges were stacked one-dimensionally. CoO and LiCoO2 exhibited low solubility in the LiCl–KCl flux, which we believe promoted the lithiation reaction while maintaining the original one-dimensional structure. The shape deformation possibly depended on the minimization of the surface-free energy of LiCoO2 crystals via the dissolution and precipitation reaction of minute amounts of LiCoO2, which were dissolved in the flux. Since the previously unknown hexagonal cylindrical LiCoO2 single crystals showed unusually high electrochemical performances, the shape-controlled synthesis of Li-ion conducting materials via flux growth may serve as a novel way to develop advanced lithium ion rechargeable batteries based on unusually shaped single crystal active materials.
