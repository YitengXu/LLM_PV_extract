    , Accepted 26th January 2022First published on 26th January 2022AbstractMetal sulfides, one kind of electrode material with very high theoretical capacity, have been widely studied for use in lithium and sodium ion batteries. However, there are some problems hindering their applications in electrodes, such as low conductivity and volume expansion. The MOF introduces metals with different coordination strengths into an existing MOF structure, which improves the performance of the electrode to a certain extent. In this paper, Fe/Zn bimetallic MOF rod-like superstructure was prepared based on Ostwald theory. Accompanied by sulfuration, the MOF was effectively combined with MoS2 and GO, and the objective materials Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO composites were successfully prepared. The MOF material provides a good frame and an efficient electron transport path, while the robust rGO wall effectively inhibits the pulverization of materials during the lithium/sodium intercalation/escalation courses. This particular material exhibited excellent cycling and rate capability performance when used in Li/Na-ion batteries. When used in Li-batteries, the electrode material delivered a specific capacity of 1598.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and remained at 1196.7 mA h g−1 even after about 100 cycles and further exhibited a specific capacity of 368.68 mA h g−1 at the current rate of 5 A g−1 even after 1000 cycles, respectively. As for sodium batteries, these electrode materials exhibited an initial reversible capacity of 1053.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and the reversible capacity was still as high as 592.2 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. It is perhaps that this composite material with its particular architecture and composition is greatly beneficial for electron transfer and Li/Na ion diffusion. In the repeated physicochemical/nutrifying process, the appropriate distance between adjacent MOFs is of great help in preventing volume changes and thus improving the electrochemical performance.
1. Introduction
With the development and progress of the times, clean and efficient sustainable energy (such as tidal power, wind power and solar energy) has become an urgent need. At the same time, the design and manufacturing of reasonable and efficient energy storage conversion devices are also essential.1,2 Since 1985, commercial Li-ion batteries have been developed for the first time and have quickly been used in a wide variety of applications.3,4 As the presence of sodium in earth is much higher than that of lithium,5–7 its price is much lower than that of lithium.8–11 Sodium ion batteries have also attracted a lot of attention and are considered to be one of the next-generation commercial storage systems. Some enlightened workers have tried to study the preparation of sodium electricity with excellent performance in various environments.12 However, the particle size of a sodium ion is larger than that of a lithium ion, and there is a more obvious electrode expansion effect aroused by a charge and discharge course.13 When Li+/Na+ batteries are used in daily life, they are usually expected to have a higher energy density, faster charge rates, and lower prices. To meet these requirements, the graphite material was first studied. But its low theoretical capacity (372 mA h g−1) limited its development on the electrode when used as the negative electrode of the battery.14,15
Recently, MOFs have been widely studied in gas adsorption, sensors, catalysis and batteries16–20 because of their special structure, porosity and large surface area. In addition, modification of a MOF electrode is one of the leading development directions of MOF electrodes.21 Bimetallic ion batteries have preferential performance22 and bimetallic MOF materials have chemically introduced other metals with different strengths into the existing MOF,23–26 thus significantly improving the performance of materials. The electrode made of bimetallic sulfide has good storage capacity18,27,28 mainly because of the abundance of active storage sites, and the synergistic effect of the interface makes abundant structural defects between different metal sulfide and further activates the inert electrode location, which altogether largely improves the electrochemical performance.29 In recent years, multivalent metal-ion batteries have attracted a wide range of attention from researchers.30 Fe–Zn–S composites have also been extensively studied.31 Particularly, Fe7S8 is one kind of ideal anode material for SIBs due to its high theoretical capacity and abundant content in the crust as well as the four-electron conversion reaction in the process of sodium/desalting.32,33 In addition, Fe7S8 is characterized by excellent electrocatalytic performance mainly owing to the widening of the ion diffusion path involved in catalysis. Similarly, Fe7S8 is capable of the greatly improved transport capacity during Li+/Na+ ion charge and discharge processes,34 which finally greatly improves its electrochemical performance. However, similar to most transition sulfide anodes, Fe7S8 also experiences large volume expansion on the one hand and is similar to limited conductivity between the two adjacent MoS2 S–Mo–S plates on the other.35–37 The resulting reduction in electrical conductivity affects the ability to transfer electrons/ions. Therefore, not only the capacity of the Fe–Zn–S composite material will be significantly reduced but also the inherent dynamics of the conversion reaction in the process of repeated charge and discharge will be attenuated greatly. The conductive carbon carrier composite material is the most used method to alleviate such problems as anode materials. Amorphous carbon plays an essential role in electrochemical performance.38 Loose and disordered amorphous carbon can greatly alleviate volume change, especially in the rapid charging and discharging process of batteries.10,39–41
In this paper, based on the Ostwald growth theory, by means of prolonging the hydrothermal reaction time,42 the basic MOF material became seed crystal after generation, and finally the ultra-long bimetallic MOF frame was successfully prepared. After heat treatment and vulcanization of the super-sized bimetal MOF, the Fe/Zn-BS-MOF frame was obtained by hydrothermal reaction again. The MoS2 and rGO sheets were successfully compounded on the framework surface, and then this particular Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2-rGO structure was reasonably designed and synthesized. In this particular composite structure, both the well-loaded MoS2 on the bimetallic MOF and the rGO coated on the periphery effectively alleviate the volume change and greatly improve the electrochemical performance of the composite material. Owing to their superiorities over traditional massive MOF materials, the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2-rGO composites exhibited excellent properties according to our electrochemical experiments and results.
2. Experimental section
Synthesis of MIL-88-Fe/Zn
The bimetallic superstructure MOF had been prepared by a hydrothermal process. First, 0.162 g of FeCl3·6H2O (XiLong Scientific AR) was carefully dissolved into 30 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF Aladdin 99.5%) solution. After stirring for ten minutes, a brown-red solution (solution A) was obtained. At the same time, after adding 0.12 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Aladdin AR) into 10 ml of DMF solution and further stirring for ten minutes, the as-prepared solution (named as solution B) was acquired. Secondly, 0.23 g of PTA (Aladdin 99%) was dissolved into solution A. After vigorous stirring for 20 minutes, solution B was poured into solution A quickly followed by stirring for another 10 minutes. The mixture solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and put into an electronic oven and kept at 150 °C for 6 h (contrast sample: 10 h, 14 h, 16 h, and 20 h). The obtained products were collected by centrifugation and dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a drying oven to obtain an orange-yellow powder.
Synthesis of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C
0.15 g of MIL-88-Fe/Zn and sulfur powder (Sigma) were put into two individual alumina boats and the boats were then placed in the center quartz tube, respectively. The MIL-88-Fe/Zn disk to sulfur powder weight ratio was 1:4. The disks were heated at 600 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of about 3 °C min−1 under argon gas.
Synthesis of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO
70 mg of the as-prepared MIL-88-Fe7S8/ZnS was weighted precisely and dissolved in 30 ml of DMF (solution A). 20 mg of graphene oxide (GO Self-made) was put into 10 ml DI of water (solution B), followed by vigorous stirring for 10 minutes and ultrasonication for 10 minutes, respectively. 0.175 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (Aladdin AR) and 0.38 g of thiourea (Sinopharm AR) were dissolved into solution A and stirred for 10 minutes. Then the solution B was poured into solution A, followed by stirring for 10 minutes. The mixture was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Then the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave was put into a high temperature oven and kept at 200 °C for 20 h. The obtained products were collected by centrifugation and dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven and a dark powder was obtained. Finally, the dark powder was put into a tubular furnace and carbonized for 2 h at 500 °C. (The comparison samples with MoS2 or GO added alone were prepared through the same process, respectively.)
Materials characterization
A dual-beam field scanning electron microscope (Helios G4 CX), TEM and HRTEM (JOEL JEM-2100) were used to evaluate the morphology characteristics of the as-prepared samples. XRD (DY5261/Xpert3, CEM, USA), ESCALAB 250 XPS and EDS were employed to analyze the composition of all samples.
Electrochemical characterization
A mixture of 70 wt% active material, 15 wt% carbon black, 15 wt% PVDF and NMP were thoroughly ground and coated on a copper foil to form the electrodes for electrochemical testing. After drying at 120 °C in a vacuum oven, it was transferred to a glove box filled with high-purity argon atmosphere and then combined with a pure lithium metal foil used as the counter electrode, a Celgard 2400 porous membrane as the separator and 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1:1 v/v/v) as the electrolyte were assembled into a lithium ion half battery. While the sodium ion half battery was assembled in the same way as a lithium half battery, except for sodium foil, GF/D glass fiber (Whatman) and 1.0 M NaClO4 in EC/DEC/fluoroethylene carbonate (1:1:0.05 v/v/v) were used as the counter electrode, separator and electrolyte, respectively. The cycle performance and rate behavior were measured using a LAND-CT2011A instrument. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were tested using a CHI650D electrochemical workstation. The frequency range for the EIS tests was 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. The cut-off voltage window of all the electrochemical tests was between 0.01–3.0 V.
3. Results and discussion
The detailed process of bimetallic superstructure-MOF (BS-MOF), namely, nanowire-assembled superstructure with MoS2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) mixture inheriting nanorod-assembled superstructure, is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. The corresponding preparation flow chart can be referred to Fig. S1.† First, the Fe/Zn-superstructure MOF was prepared by the hydrothermal method at different time periods (Fig. 1). It was easily deduced from the experimental results that those MOF structures were formed gradually by a continuous gathering and growing process. Fig. 2(a–f) discloses the detailed comparison picture information that the small particles are significantly reduced with the increase in hydrothermal process time. Second, after the vulcanizing process, the corresponding morphologies of the as-prepared Fe7S8 and ZnS samples were displayed in Fig. 3(a and d) indicating that the overall morphology of the MOF did not change much. However, high-temperature sintering caused a part of the water and oxygen to separate from the material, resulting in a rough and granular surface and interior. Then MoS2 and rGO were grown on the framework surface by a simple hydrothermal method. As indicated from the SEM images in Fig. 3(c and f) and energy-disperse spectroscopy (EDS) in Fig. S2,† the material retained its original morphology after the hydrothermal method, and MoS2 and rGO were well coated on the surface of the framework. Finally, the mixture samples were washed, dried at 60 °C and then annealed under an N2 atmosphere at 500 °C for 2 h in turns.

For the synthesis of BS-MOF, the hydrothermal reaction was adopted except for prolonging the reaction time. The SEM images of BS-MOF grown in different time periods were indicated in Fig. 1 (time range from 6 h to 20 h). First, after a 6 h reaction, the obtained sample was mainly composed of regular MOF nanorods with a length of about 300 nm or slightly smaller. Fig. 1(a) and (b) display the Fe-MOF morphology and Fe/Zn bimetallic morphology after the 6 h hydrothermal process, respectively. The MOF morphology remained nearly the same despite the addition of the Zn element. With the increase in the hydrothermal reaction time, the particle size of the aggregated amorphous MOF nanoparticles increased gradually and the larger aggregations of the MOF nanoparticles served as templates for further MOF nucleation and growth because of Ostwald ripening. Amorphous MOF assembly formed a spherical super MOF nanorod, when the reaction time was up to 16 h; it was seen clearly from the magnified SEM image (Fig. 1(e)) that the BS-MOF is composed of single MOFs and hence would be an extended version of single MOFs. The structure of the particles could be seen from both the initial MOF magnifications (Fig. S3†) and the sample's magnification after coating MoS2/rGO and post-sulfuring (show Fig. S4(a and b)†), which also in return verified the validity of the Ostwald theory. The individual MOF surface was smoother due to the thick organic layer on the surface. Then after integrating MoS2 and rGO with BS-MOF, the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO (BS-MOF@MoS2/rGO) composites (show Fig. 3(f)) seemed like a vine structure that was formed by the interlayer van der Waals force and high surface energy of MoS2. And, after being combined with rGO, the folded rGO sheets were tightly clung on BS-MOF@MoS2. As described in Fig. 3(f), the rGO sheets played a protective film. The BS-MOF@MoS2 was well covered by graphene sheets, indicating the passivation and buffer feature in preventing the collapse of MoS2. To confirm the as-prepared material as we expected, TEM tests were performed to further characterize the composite. The TEM images, as shown in Fig. 4(a–d), showed that MoS2 integrated with the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C frames. The high surface energy of MoS2 and interlayer van der Waals gravity made MoS2 well wrapped on the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C surface, resulting in the composite having a vine structure. After combining with reduced graphene oxide, chiffon-like reduced graphene oxide nanosheets with pleated texture were tightly wrapped on the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C/MoS2 vine surface, forming Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C/MoS2/rGO porous hierarchical hybrid nanostructures.

The detailed microstructure of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO sample was investigated by a typical EDS spectrum. As depicted in Fig. 4(e–l), the Fe, Zn, Mo, S, C, O, and N elements were very clearly distributed on the vine, and the relevant element proportions were listed in Table S1.† The uniform distribution of Fe and Zn elements represented the successful preparation of the bimetallic MOF, and the distribution of the Mo and S elements means that the MoS2 lamellae were uniformly coated on the frame surface. In addition, the interconnected rGO layers were helpful in providing strong electron channels and conductive networks, thus ensuring structural integrity and efficient transfer during battery charging/discharging cycles. In addition, the permeable porous hierarchy can significantly shorten the transfer length of lithium/sodium ions and electrons.
To further prove whether the formed samples were MOF materials, pure Fe-MOF (6 h) was compared with the BS-MOF material (20 h) sample via the XRD tests (Fig. S5†).43 The characteristic peak of MOF at 8.90° pointed to the (1 1 2) plane of anatase Fe-MOF with a tetragonal structure. A uniform size of ∼300 nm in length and ∼250 nm in width for this Fe-MOF was observed. After adding the Zn element, the main peaks of Fe-MOF remained. Of course, there were some new peaks for Fe/Zn BS-MOF appearing at these peaks of 18.7° and 21.8°, which were attributed to the formation of new Fe/Zn BS-MOF. And according to the SEM image (see Fig. 1(b)), it was clear that the morphological evolution of Fe/Zn BS-MOF in fact inherited that of MIL-88. To investigate the evolution of the MOF superstructure after sulfuring and covering treatment, all the composition and phases of the composite were effectively determined by XRD measurement and the XRD peaks of the composites were in well accordance with those of Fe7S8 (PDF#24-0220), ZnS (PDF#05-0566) and MoS2 (PDF#3-1492), respectively. As indicated in Fig. 5, the peaks at 30.0°, 34.0° and 44.0° obviously belonged to Fe7S8. The peaks at 28.5°, 47.6° and 56.3° were attributed to those of ZnS. As for the initial MOF structure, after sulfured, the peaks at 30.0°, 34.0°, and 44.0° were attributable to Fe7S8 while the peaks at 28.5° and 4.3° originated from ZnS. However, since the replacement reaction of Zn occurred on the surface of MOF, the peak intensity value of ZnS after vulcanization became stronger. In addition, the peaks at 14.4°, 32.6° and 44.1° belonged to the characteristic peaks of MoS2, which also was further verified by the results in the SEM and TEM images.

To confirm the chemical composition, the state of the as-obtained sample and to explore and master more information, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was employed. As shown in Fig. 6, the Fe, Zn, Mo, S, C, O and N elements were clearly disclosed from the XPS survey scan spectrum. Unfortunately, the oxygen content is high possibly owing to the explosion of the sample air for a long time. As depicted in Fig. 6(b), there were two characteristic peaks at 710.8 eV and 723.8 eV corresponding to the Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2, respectively.39 Another two peaks located at 1045.5 eV and 1022.5 eV in the Zn 2p spectrum (Fig. 6(c)) were attributed to Zn2+ 2p1/2 and Zn2+ 2p3/2, respectively. As indicated in Fig. 6(d), three prominent peaks with binding energies of 229.4 eV, 232.6 eV and 235.4 eV corresponded to the oxidation states of Mo4+ 3d5/2, Mo4+ 3d3/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2.44 In addition, there was a characteristic peak of S located at 226.3 eV,41 which was attributed to the formation of MoS2. The above result further disclosed that there were some amount of MoO2 and molybdate on the composite material surface possibly due to oxidation.41 In addition, as shown in Fig. 6(e), the S element could be described by four deconvoluted peaks at around 161.9 eV, 163.1 eV, 164.0 eV and 165.0 eV, where S 2p3/2 was fitted to 161.9 and 163.1 eV, indicating the formation of S–Fe and S–Zn bonds, and S 2p1/2 was fitted to 164.0 and 165.0 eV.45 For the C 1s core-level spectrum, relevant evidence could be found in Fig. 6(f). The CC/C–C bonds were located at 284.8 eV, which corresponded to the C 1s energy spectrum of rGO and 286.2 eV corresponds to the C–O bonds in sp2. Finally, Fig. S6† indicates the XPS map of N, where 401.5 eV indicated the N doped into graphene. The peaks at 398.1 and 394.8 eV correspond to the N in thiourea that is doped into the material during the hydrothermal process, forming C–N and CN bonds.

To explore the electrochemical performance of the final sample Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO, a Li/Na-ion half-cell battery was assembled in a CR2032 coin cell with a Li/Na metal foil. The cycling performance of electrodes for LIBs is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7(a) provides the first 5 cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves obtained at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. During the first cycling, there were three obvious cathode reduction peaks located at 1.42 V, 0.89 V and 0.25 V, which indicated that Li+ ions have been inserted into Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C and a solid electrolyte interface film (SEI) has been formed that corresponds to the conversion process of Fe7S8/ZnS to LiFeS2/Zn.46–48 Based on other previous works, the peak at 0.89 was associated with Li+ insertion into Fe7S8 interlayers (forming LiFeS2) (eqn (1) and (2)).49,50 The small cathodic peak at 1.42 V can be attributed to the conversion reaction of ZnS (eqn (3))48 and another peak at 0.25 was probably related to the generation of LixMoS2. When the peak voltage was shifted to 0.15 V,51 LixMoS2 was further transformed into Li2S and metallic Mo (eqn (4)).52,53 The basic process of anode oxidation is represented in Fig. 7(a) and the peak at 0.64 V was assigned to the reconfiguration of LixMoS2 and the formation of MoS2. A narrow peak at 1.50 V corresponds to the oxidation reaction of Mo to Mo4+/Mo6+ (eqn (5)),54 while another broad peak at 2.23 V possibly corresponded to the Li2S to amorphous S, Zn to Zn2+ (eqn (6))48,49 and Fe to Fe3+ reactions (eqn (7)).47 In summary, the charge–discharge process can be described as the following equations:
Discharge Fe7S8 + 8Li+ + 8e− → 4Li2FeS2 + 3Fe(1) LiFeS2 + 2Li+ + 2e− → 2Li2S + Fe(2) ZnS + 2Li+ + 2e− → Zn + Li2S(3) MoS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → 2Li2S + Mo(4)
Charge: Mo + 2Li2S − xLi+ − xe− → Li2−xMoS2(5) Zn + Li2S − xLi+ − xe− → Li2−xZnS2(6) Fe + 2Li2S − xLi+ − xe− → Li2−xFeS2(7)

(c) Cycle performance and coulombic efficiency for the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO, Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C, Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2 and Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@rGO electrodes at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. (d) Rate capabilities and cycle performance of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO, Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2 and Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@rGO electrodes cycled at different rates ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 A g−1. 
When comparing the first cycle with other cycle cures, there were some variations in both the reduction peaks and oxidation peaks (Fig. 7). The reduction peaks were slightly shifted to 0.20 V, 1.07 V, 1.50 and 1.90 V. The slight right shift in the peaks of oxidation demonstrated that electrode polarization was inhibited to some extent. This phenomenon could also be observed in the electrochemical performance curves of 0.1 A g−1 shown in Fig. 7(c), indicating that not only the cycling performance of the cell but also its stability were greatly improved just via coating with both MoS2 and rGO. Fig. 7(b) displayed the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of BS-MOF@MoS2/rGO at 0.1 A g−1 from the 1st to 5th cycles, indicating that these CV curves match well with the slopes. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the BS-MOF@MoS2/rGO were 1598.3 mA h g−1 and 1067 mA h g−1, respectively, with the initial coulombic efficiency of only about 66.8%. The initial capacity loss was possibly caused by the SEI layer formation, the electrolyte decomposition and the partial irreversible reactions. In the charge curve, the sloping line of 0.3–1.8 V indicated the extraction of Li+ from the electrode material.
The cycling electrochemical performance of all electrode samples was acquired under a current of 0.1 A g−1. As indicated in Fig. 7(c), the reversible capacity of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode capacity keeps a steady upward trend on the whole. The coated rGO electrode material exhibited more stable cycling performance and maintained the electrochemical performance well possibly due to the good relief of the rGO sheet coating outside of the material, alleviating the volume expansion during the discharging-charging process as well as improving the electrical conductivity. The coated MoS2 electrode material exhibited good performance in the beginning. It was the formation of a heterojunction structure between MoS2 and Fe7S8/ZnS material that was beneficial for the performance improvement. But the continuous shedding of MoS2 layers during the charging and discharging process would lead to some decrease in performance. In addition, for comparison, the electrochemical properties of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C material were tested alone. It could be clearly seen that the initial capacity was not high but with the activation of Zn, the capacity gradually increased in the following stages.55 There was a stable upward trend in the performance of the material. As indicated in Fig. 7(d), the rate capabilities of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@ MoS2/rGO, Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2 and Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@rGO electrodes were evaluated at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 A g−1, respectively. The reversible capacities of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO were 1066, 1034.89, 999.12, 936.69, 864.45, and 688.39 mA h g−1, respectively. When the current density was reset to 0.1 A g−1, the capacity quickly recovered to even higher than the previous capacity at the same current up to 1227.82 mA h g−1 and then stabilized at about 1285.71 mA h g−1 or even more. This quickly recovering phenomenon of the rate capability exhibited the great sustainability of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO composite. In contrast, the rate capabilities of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2 and Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@ rGO electrodes were much worse than that of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO. For comparison purposes, all the samples were tested at 1.0 A g−1 (Fig. S7†). The initial discharge capacity of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 was 828 mA h g−1 while the charging capacity approached 651.6 mA h g−1, with a CE of ∼78.7%. After 500 cycles, the discharge capacity of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO was still up to 866.9 mA h g−1 with a steady CE of nearly unit. As for the comparison samples, Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2 and Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@rGO, the discharge/charge capacities were only 1057.1/721 mA h g−1 and 760.6/629.9 mA h g−1, respectively. Although there was no significant difference in efficiency, it could be clearly seen that the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO composite anode was of great advantage in cycling performance over other samples. Besides, the cycling performance of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode was further studied at a higher current density (5 A g−1) (see Fig. S8†) and a peculiar phenomenon was observed. The reversible capacity of the composite undergoes three stages of rapid decay: steady growth, and long-lasting states, which correspond to the emergence (1st), disappearance (100th), re-emergence (300th) and re-disappearance (530th) of the charging and discharging platforms. The cycling performance curve decreased rapidly at large currents from 1 to 75 cycles and then it stabilized as a low reversible capacity of (∼150 mA h g−1) between 100 to 300 cycles. The possible reason is that MoS2 coated outside the MOF frame fell off quickly under high current influence, leading to the reduction of capacity. However, in the following 300–500 cycles, the capacity quickly recovered to 400 mA h g−1, still maintained a relatively stable trend, and remained at 395 mA h g−1 when cycled after 800 cycles. The excellent cycling and rate properties of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO composites indicated that the diffusive activation of lithium ions in combination with MoS2 led to the decrease in Ohmic resistance, which resulted in a fast Faraday effect.56 Such a superior Li-ion storage performance of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode was not only better than the contrast samples but also superior to the relevant anode materials reported in other literature (Table S2†).
To further explore the kinetics mechanism of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO used in Li-ion anode storage, the CV curve was obtained at different scanning rates from 0.2 to 1.0 mV s−1, as displayed in Fig. 8. As the scan rate increases in the CV test (Fig. 8(a)), the oxidation peak inevitably moves in the positive direction due to polarization, while the reduction peak moves in the negative direction, due to the non-negligible resistance between potential and current.57 Based on previous studies, the relationship between peak current (i) and scan rate (v) can be described as eqn (8) and (9),58 in which the value of b can be calculated from the slope of logi versus logv. i = avb(8) logi = loga + blogν(9)
 Fig. 8  (a) CV curves of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode for Li-battery at scan rates ranging from 0.2 to 1 mV s−1 and (b) the corresponding log(i) versus log(v) plots at peaks I and II. (c) CV curve with pseudocapacitive contribution (the red region) at a scan rate of 0.8 mV s−1. (d) Capacitive contribution (in percentage) at different scan rates. (e) EIS of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO, Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2, and Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@ rGO electrodes at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. (f) EIS of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode before and after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. 
When b ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, the Li+ ion storage kinetics were dominated by a diffusion-controlled process and pseudocapacitive behavior. The curve on the logi versus logv is displayed in Fig. 8(b), and the slopes of the two peaks were 0.60619 and 0.76606, suggesting that the response of the composite anode was related to the diffusion-dominated processes and capacitance-controlled behavior. Eqn (10) and (11) describe the capacity contribution of the diffusion-dominated reaction (k2v1/2) and the quantitative estimation of the pseudocapacitive effect (k1v) i(v) = k1v + k2v1/2(10) i(v)/v1/2 = k1v1/2 + k2(11)
In addition, as depicted in Fig. 8(e), the resultant BS-MOF and MoS2/rGO exhibited the lowest resistance values owing to the synergistic function of MoS2 and rGO in the composite. The value of Rct becomes lower (show Fig. 8(f)) when cycled after 100 cycles. Above all, it was the short paths, the porous hierarchical architecture of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO that could form more storage sites, the open structure and the large amounts of ion insertion channels that promote the rapid diffusion of lithium ions. As shown in Fig. S9,† the comparison of the individual CV curves also confirms the validity of this view. In addition, comparison samples were tested for pseudocapacitance; see Fig. S10 and S11† for details.
When used as the anode in sodium ion batteries, as indicated in Fig. 9(a), the typical CV profiles for five cycles at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 were achieved. During the first sodiation process, there was a peak located at 0.07 V corresponding to the interpolation of Na+ into the MoS2 sheet layer. This enabled the formation of NaxMoS2 and a deeper step in the reaction of Mo.59 Other peaks at 0.8 V correspond to the generation of Na2FeS2, the formation of an SEI film, and the conversion of Na2FeS2 to Fe and Na2S, respectively. According to the previous reports on iron sulfides, during the initial desodiation process, the oxidation peaks at ∼1.44 V corresponded to the reaction from elemental molybdenum to Mo4+; another peak at 1.86 V corresponded to the reaction between Fe and Na2S which formed NaxFeS. For the subsequent cycles, the CV curves overlap almost completely, indicating the excellent repeatability of the electrochemical properties. Fig. S12(a) and (b)† display the CVs of samples coated with MoS2 and rGO, respectively. For the control group, there were an obvious left shift of the oxidation peak and a right shift of the reduction peak, which also meant the different electrochemical reactions during the charge/discharge courses. The relatively poor overlap of the CV curves of the MoS2-only coated sample reflected the poor stability of the MoS2-only coated cells and mainly, due to the poor stability, the shedding and agglomeration of the MoS2 sheet layer during the charge/discharge processes. Fig. 9(b) disclosed the performance of the samples for cycles 1–5 and the tenth cycle at a current rate of 0.1 A g−1. Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1053.6 mA h g−1 with the first coulombic efficiency of 66.2%. The coulombic efficiency quickly increased to 99% after the fifth cycle. This was probably due to the capacity fading aroused by the formation of an SEI layer.50,60 As indicated in Fig. 9(c), the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode exhibited excellent cycling performance with a reversible capacity retention of 602.1 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.1 A g−1 and 592.2 mA h g−1 when cycled after 200 cycles (show Fig. S15†), meaning that the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode delivered stable capacities in SIBs.

(d) Rate capabilities and cycling performances of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO, Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2 and Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@ rGO electrodes at scan rates ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 A g−1. 
The rate capabilities of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO, Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2 and Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@rGO samples are indicated in Fig. 9(d) (current rate: from 0.1 A g−1 to 5 A g−1). The average capacity of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode for the first 10 cycles was 600 mA h g−1. When the current density changed to 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 A g−1, the average capacities converted to 520.1, 387, 296.6, 206.4, and 113 mA h g−1, respectively. When the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1, the capacity recovered to 553.6 mA h g−1, demonstrating that this electrode material was capable of excellent rate capability. In contrast, the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2 and Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@rGO electrodes delivered relatively poor electrochemical performance including reversible capacity or rate capability. At the same time, the cycling performance of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO and the contrast samples were all tested at the current rate of 1.0 A g−1 (Fig. S16†). For the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO composite electrode, the initial discharge and charge capacities were 1439.6 mA h g−1 and 734.8 mA h g−1. The MoS2-only coated electrode delivered a high initial capacity in the beginning but it deteriorated rapidly. Although the cycling performance of the rGO-only coated electrode is relatively stable, its reversible capacity is relatively low. Coating with MoS2 and rGO at the same time to a large extent overcame/alleviated the two problems mentioned above. There was a synergistic effect among the MoS2 layer, MOF framework and rGO. During Na+ insertion/de-insertion, the framework ensured stable properties by performing both passivation and buffering functions to prevent corrosion and collapse of MoS2. As compared with the results of recent studies on the sodium storage performance of FeSx-based materials,61 our result was very encouraging and the cycling performance of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode material is greatly superior to those of the relevant anode materials (show Table S3†). For the CV curves, the contribution of diffusion-dominated and capacitive behavior to the total sodium ion storage was described (show Fig. 10(a)). The CV curves at different scan rates illustrated the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode material. In the plot curve of logi versus logv, if the value of b was 0.5 or 1, the Na+ storage dynamics were dominated by diffusion-controlled processes or pseudo-capacitive behavior, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10(b), the corresponding fitted values for peaks were 0.70257 and 0.82134, indicating the presence of partial capacitive behavior during sodiation and denaturation, respectively. When the scan rate was 0.8 mV s−1, the contribution of the capacitive behavior (red region) to the total capacity composite quantification was up to 61.3% (Fig. 10(c)). The contribution of capacitive behavior increased gradually with the increase in the scan rate (Fig. 10(d)). In addition, the comparison samples were tested for pseudocapacitance as shown in Fig. S13 and S14†. Generally speaking, the pseudocapacitance-dominated process would be of great advantage in enhancing the rate capability and speeding up the process of sodiation and denaturation.

(f) EIS of the Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO electrode before and after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. 
To dig out the sodium storage mechanism of the as-obtained electrode materials, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO as well as those of the two reference samples at the open circuit potential. In Nyquist curves (show Fig. 10(e)), Re referred to the resistance of the electrolyte, electrode, and separator in the high-frequency region, whereas the semicircle part indicated the charge transfer resistance Rct in the medium-frequency region, and the diagonal part indicates the impedance in the low frequency region (Zw). Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO possessed a low charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of 315.2 Ω, which was much lower than those of Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2 (548.7 Ω) and Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@rGO (1317 Ω) electrodes. As shown in Fig. 10(f), the impedance of the battery drops significantly after 100 cycles. This indicates that the synergistic effect of the three materials, together with the interconnected porous structure, was responsible for the small Rct values of the composite electrodes.
In all, the as-prepared Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO composite exhibits excellent Li+/Na+ storage properties. There might be several reasons attributable to the excellent Li+/Na+ storage performance: (1) the assembled superstructure MOF allowed the nanoparticles to be covered with the carbon layer, effectively reducing the ion diffusion pathway and hindering agglomeration. (2) There was a synergistic effect between the superstructure MOF framework, MoS2 multilayer structure, which greatly improved the Li+/Na+ storage performance of the composite. (3) The composite rGO sheet layer effectively alleviated the diffusion effect of the material during the charge/discharge process, effectively improved the battery performances, and enhanced the cycling stability of the electrode materials.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the composite material exhibited a relatively good advantage in maintaining the characteristics of BS-MOF activation during the charge/discharge process, which greatly improved the reversible capacity of the battery. The composite was effective in combination with MoS2, which solves the problem of the poor theoretical capacity of the composite. The combination with rGO via coating rGO on the surface of the composite material relieved the volume expansion of the electrode material and the shedding of MoS2. The cycling performance of the battery during charge/discharge could be maintained. Therefore, an electrode material with excellent electrochemical performance, including highly reversible capacity and rate capability was successfully prepared. The Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO sample delivered a reversible capacity of Li-battery which was 1598.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 1196.7 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. The reversible capacity of sodium batteries at 0.1 A g−1 was up to 1053.6 mA h g−1 and 592.2 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. Constructing/designing super-structures composed of different layers of materials with an ultra-long MOF as a framework is an effective strategy to improve their electrochemical performance due to the synergistic effect between different nanocomponents.
