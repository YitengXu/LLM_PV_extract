    , Accepted 27th November 2020First published on 27th November 2020AbstractThe practical application of transition metal phosphides has been hampered by the inferior rate capability and large volume change during charging and discharging processes. To address this, the construction of metal phosphide heterostructures combined with a porous carbon skeleton is a promising strategy for providing fast charge transfer kinetics. Herein, hetero-CoP/FeP nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon nanofibers (CoP/FeP@PCNFs) are obtained by coaxial electrospinning and low-temperature phosphorization processes. By employing CoP/FeP@PCNFs as the anode for sodium-ion batteries, a large reversible specific capacity (459 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1), excellent rate performance (46.4% capacity retention rate at 10 A g−1 relative to 0.05 A g−1) and long-term cycling stability (208 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 over 1000 cycles and 73.5% capacity retention) can be obtained. By virtue of the porous structure and heterogeneous structure, the electrochemical performance of the CoP/FeP@PCNF sample was greatly improved. The porous structure can promote the ion transport and accommodate the volume expansion. Density functional theory calculation confirms that the constructed heterostructure can generate a built-in electric field and facilitate the reaction kinetics of Na+. This work provides the basic guidance for the future development of energy storage materials by designing heterostructures with a porous structure.
1. Introduction
With the increasing consumption of fossil fuels, developing a new type of renewable energy has become an urgent issue.1–4 However, most renewable energy sources, for instance tidal, offshore wind and solar, are intermittent and vulnerable to weather. Therefore, it is necessary to develop robust, reliable, and economically viable energy storage systems.5–9 At present, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are one of the most reliable commercial energy storage batteries, but their development is limited by the uneven distribution of lithium resources.10,11 In recent years, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been deemed promising alternative candidates to LIBs, owing to the low-cost and plentiful reserves of sodium.12,13 Although the mechanism of sodium ion storage is similar to that of lithium ions, the radius of sodium ions (1.02 Å) is larger than that of lithium ions (0.76 Å), which makes the rapid insertion/extraction of Na+ in the host material more difficult than that of Li+, leading to low reversible capacity and poor cycling performance.14,15 Graphite as the anode for commercial lithium-ion batteries has a layer spacing of 0.3354 nm, which is very unfavorable for the insertion of sodium ions, resulting in poor cycling stability and low reversible capacity. Although graphite can provide a capacity of 100 mA h g−1 and improved cycle performance in a diglyme-based electrolyte, the reversible capacity of graphite is still low compared with other carbon materials.16–18
Besides carbonaceous materials, a variety of anode materials, including oxides,19–21 sulfides,22–25 and selenides,26–28 have been explored for SIBs. In particular, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) (MPX, M = Co, Fe, Ni, Cu,) with high reversible capacity have been considered as the promising candidate of anode materials for sodium ion storage. Nevertheless, the low electronic conductivity of metal phosphides and the large volume expansion during the repetitive sodiation/desodiation process have severely hampered the kinetics performance.29,30 To surmount the drawbacks, the design of nanostructured metal phosphides incorporated into a carbon skeleton is a promising strategy. For example, Yin et al. reported that reduced graphene oxide interconnected core–shell structured CoP@FeP (RGO@CoP@FeP) can be synthesized via a low-temperature phosphorization process. RGO@CoP@FeP as the anode for SIBs exhibits a high reversible capacity (480.2 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) and outstanding cycling stability (285 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g−1).31 Moreover, constructing heterostructures combined with the above strategy has demonstrated to effectively achieve satisfactory electrochemical performance, since heterostructures possess fast charge transfer properties.32 For example, Guo et al. have fabricated hetero-CoO/Co3S4@N-doped carbon frameworks for sodium storage, displaying a super reversible capacity and excellent long-term cycling stability.33 Wang et al. have prepared a heterogeneous structure of SnS2/Sb2S3 anchored on rGO sheets,34 revealing an excellent long-term cycle life with 80.5% capacity retention after 400 cycles. This excellent sodium storage performance can be attributed to the strong charge transfer dynamics of heterogeneous structures, which can generate a built-in electric field at the interface to promote Na+ migration. To date, heterostructures based on metal phosphides have been seldomly investigated for SIBs.
In this paper, we report the fabrication of hetero-CoP/FeP nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon nanofibers (CoP/FeP@PCNFs) via the coaxial electrospinning technique with a low-temperature phosphatization process as the anode for SIBs. Porous carbon nanofibers with abundant open pores and a high specific surface area can not only provide three-dimensional conductive highways and unimpeded channels for the rapid transport of electrons and electrolyte ions, but also inhibit the volume expansion and aggregation of phosphides during charging and discharging. The bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon nanofibers can possess rich redox reaction sites and short Na+ diffusion paths, which are beneficial for increasing the specific capacity and accelerating the reaction kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation further proves that the CoP/FeP heterostructure can effectively improve the conductivity and the charge transfer kinetics, speeding up the migration of sodium ions at the interface. As a result, the CoP/FeP@PCNFs reveals excellent rate capability (424 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 213 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1). More importantly, the capacity retention ratio is up to 73.5% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1. As expected, this result shows that the rational design of heterostructures in the carbon matrix provides a novel strategy for constructing high-performance electrodes.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of CoP/FeP@PCNFs
CoP/FeP@PCNFs was synthesized by the electrospinning technique. Briefly, polyacrylonitrile (PAN, 0.8 g, MW = 85000) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 8 mL) for use as the inner solution. Then, a mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2 mmol), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (2 mmol) and PAN (1.5 g, MW = 150 000) in DMF (15 mL) was stirred overnight at 60 °C for use as the outer solution. The as-prepared solutions were electrospun into fibers. The typical feeding rate was set as 0.8 mL h−1 for the outer solution and 0.6 mL h−1 for the inner solution. The tip of the injection needle is applied with a high voltage of 20 kV and a direct-current power supply, and the distance from the receiver to the needle is 15 cm. The as-collected electrospun fibers were stabilized at 280 °C for 2 h under air, calcined at 800 °C for 2 h under N2, and then annealed at 300 °C for 2 h under air. After that, the oxidized fiber was put at the downstream and NaH2PO2 was put at the upstream for the phosphorization process. The phosphorization was proceeded under 400 °C for 5 h under a N2 atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, black CoP/FeP@PCNF powder was obtained. For comparison, CoP@PCNFs or FeP@PCNFs can be prepared using the same protocol by only replacing ferric/cobalt nitrate with cobalt/ferric nitrate.
2.2 Materials characterization
The phase composition of the as-prepared samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a D8 Advance with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å) operating at 40.0 kV and 40.0 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on an FEI-QUANTA250 SEM system. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were conducted by using an FEI-Tecnai G2 20 transmission electron microscope. Raman spectra of the samples were recorded using a LabRam HR-800 spectrometer with a laser wavelength of 514 nm. The chemical structure/bonding of the samples was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Thermo ESCALAB250XI. The specific surface area and porosity of all the samples were tested at 77 K by using the Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 surface characterization analyzer. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out using a NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG equipment under flowing air.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The working electrodes were prepared by spreading the slurry containing active material, acetylene black and carboxymethyl cellulose at a weight ratio of 75:15:10 in water/ethanol onto a copper foil. The copper foil coated with the active material was dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The mass loading of the active material is about 1.0 mg cm−2. The electrode was assembled into CR2032 coin type cells in a glove box by using polyethene as the separator and metal Na foil as the counter electrode. 1.0 M NaSO3CF3 dissolved in diglyme was used as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic Charge–Discharge (GCD) tests and the Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) were carried out on a LAND CT2001A battery test system (Wuhan) in the potential range of 0.001–3.0 V (vs. Na+/Na). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in the voltage range from 0.001 V to 3.0 V were obtained by CHI660E electrochemical workstation at different scanning rates, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz was conducted using a Gamry Interface 1000 workstation. All electrochemical measurements were conducted at room temperature. In the ex situ XRD test, no carbon black is added to the electrode material. A uniform slurry of active material and binder (95%:5%) is formed on the stainless steel foil as the working electrode. The batteries with different discharge/charge stages were disassembled in an argon-filled glove box, and then the disassembled electrode was washed several times with diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and naturally dried. The electrodes were stored in a sample tube in a glove box and removed quickly before XRD tests.
2.4 Theoretical calculations
In the calculation, the density functional theory (DFT) approach was applied using the CASTEP software package.10,35,36 The exchange-correction interaction energy was modelled by using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, and the interaction between atoms was simulated by the super-soft pseudopotential method.37,38 After the convergence test, the truncation energy was set at 400 eV, and the K point in the Brillouin region generated by the Gamma method was 7 × 1 × 1 to satisfy the reciprocal spatial geometric relationship. The atomic energy convergence standard is 1.0 × 10−6 eV, the atomic interaction force convergence standard is 0.03 eV, the stress convergence standard is 0.05 GPA, and the atomic maximum displacement convergence standard is 1.0 × 10−6 Å.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and physicochemical properties of CoP/FeP@PCNFs
The synthesis procedure of CoP/FeP@PCNFs is illustrated in Scheme 1. Firstly, a precursor solution containing low-molecular-weight PAN (inner) and high-molecular-weight PAN with metal nitrate (outer) was electrospun into a fiber membrane via the coaxial electrospinning technique. Then, the fibers were stabilized at 280 °C and carbonized at 800 °C, in which the low-molecular-weight PAN breaks down into CO2 gas and escapes from the carbon nanofibers, resulting in a porous structure. During this process, cobalt nitrate and ferric nitrate can be reduced into Co and Fe nuclei. After that, the Co and Fe nuclei are oxidized under air. Finally, the metal phosphide was obtained by the low-temperature phosphatization process, in which NaH2PO2 generates PH3 gas above 200 °C and PH3 reacts with cobalt iron oxide to form phosphide. As a baseline, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs were also prepared with similar procedures.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis of CoP/FeP@PCNFs and the related Na+ storage enhancement mechanism. 
The morphological structure of CoP/FeP@PCNFs was characterized by SEM and TEM. The fiber reveals a porous structure with the diameter of about 200–250 nm (Fig. 1(a–c)). Some tubular-like structures are observed on the surface of fibers in CoP@PCNFs and CoP/FeP@PCNFs (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1†), and the formation of a tubular-like morphology can be ascribed to the catalytic effect of Co.39 It can be seen that the nanoparticles are exposed on the outside of the nanofibers in FeP@PCNFs and CoP@PCNFs, while the CoP/FeP nanoparticles are completely embedded in the nanofibers in CoP/FeP@PCNFs. It is obvious that the diameter of FeP@PCNF and CoP@PCNF nanofibers is smaller than that of CoP/FeP@PCNFs, and the serious shrinkage of the carbon nanofibers in FeP@PCNFs and CoP@PCNFs during the carbonization process should be responsible for the different morphologies.39,40 The TEM images of CoP/FeP@PCNFs indicate that the CoP/FeP nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in the carbon matrix (Fig. 1d and e). In Fig. 2f, the HRTEM image of CoP/FeP@PCNFs displays obvious lattice fringes with the interplanar spacing of about 0.196 and 0.240 nm, which correspond to the (112) plane of CoP and (111) plane of FeP. It is obvious that the lattice of FeP and CoP is closely connected to form a heterogeneous structure at the interface, which can improve the electron conductivity and sodium ion transport rate, as discussed later. The EDXS elemental mapping images of CoP/FeP@PCNFs indicate that the elements C, Co, Fe, N and P are uniformly distributed throughout the carbon nanofibers (Fig. 1g).

(h) High-resolution P 2p spectra of CoP/FeP@PCNFs, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs. 
For investigating the crystal structure of the sample, the XRD test was first performed (Fig. 2a). In the XRD pattern of the CoP/FeP@PCNF composite, four weak peaks located at 33.0°, 37.1°,48.3° and 56.1° can be assigned to the (011), (111), (211) and (212) planes of FeP (PDF no. 78-1443), while the peaks centered at 31.5°, 46.3°, 48.1° and 56.8° can be indexed to the (011), (112), (211) and (301) planes of CoP (PDF 29-0497). Moreover, there is one broadened diffraction peak centered at ∼25°, corresponding to the (002) crystal planes of graphitic carbon. As shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S2,† two distinct peaks at about 1334 and 1587 cm−1 can be observed from the Raman spectra, which could correspond to the D-(disordered) band and the G-(graphite) band.41 The value of ID/IG is a significant standard to judge the degree of disorder of the carbon matrix. The value of the ID/IG ratio of CoP/FeP@PCNFs (2.28) is slightly higher than that of CoP@PCNFs (1.64) and FeP@PCNFs (1.92), further suggesting that the CoP/FeP@PCNF nanocomposite can provide additional defects and disorder in the porous carbon nanofibers. TG analysis was used to determine the mass loading of the metal phosphide in CoP/FeP@PCNFs (Fig. S3†). Below 300 °C, the weight loss of the CoP/FeP@PCNF composite was approximately 5.49 wt% due to the volatilization of crystal water and adsorbed water on the surface. However, drastic weight loss occurred between 400 °C and 650 °C, which could be ascribed to the burning of carbon and the transformation from the metal phosphide to a metal oxide (3CoP + 2FeP + 39/2 O2 → Co3O4 + Fe2O3 + 5/2 P2O5). By calculating from the TG curve, the weight fraction for the metal phosphide in CoP/FeP@PCNFs is 64.25 wt%.
The textural properties of the CoP/FeP@PCNF, FeP@PCNF and CoP@PCNF composites are further investigated by the N2 adsorption/desorption method (Fig. 2c). It is obvious that the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the three samples exhibit type IV curves, indicating the existence of an abundant mesoporous structure. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of CoP/FeP@PCNFs is 274 m2 g−1, which is much higher than that of FeP@PCNFs (121 m2 g−1) and CoP@PCNFs (37 m2 g−1). The less shrinkage of carbon nanofibers in CoP/FeP@PCNFs and the combination of Co and Fe are beneficial for the generation of pores in the sample, resulting in the highest surface area for CoP/FeP@PCNFs.42 The higher surface area indicates more defective structures in the carbon, which is consistent with the higher ID/IG value, as obtained in the Raman analysis. The corresponding pore size distribution results were obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (Fig. S4†), which indicates numerous mesopores centered at 3–4 nm. The abundant pores and large surface area not only provide sufficient space to buffer the volume expansion caused by the sodium insertion/extraction process, but also facilitate the exposure of the electrode–electrolyte interface for improving the electrochemical performance.
To further analyze the near-surface chemical states of the CoP/FeP@PCNF composite, XPS analysis is executed. Fig. 2d shows the survey spectra of three samples, showing that the C, N, O, Co, Fe and P elements are evenly distributed in the CoP/FeP@PCNFs, in accordance with the result of elemental mapping. Oxygen is derived from the surface oxidation of the sample or the oxidation process. In the high resolution C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2e), it can be deconvoluted into five peaks located at binding energies of 284.6, 285.3, 286.5, 288.2, and 291.2 eV, corresponding to the CC, C–C, C–O/C–N, CO/CN, and O–CO bonds.43,44 In addition, another peak centered at 283.7 eV is indexed to the C–P bond, suggesting that partial P atoms are implanted into the carbon lattice.45,46 The C 1s spectra of FeP@PCNFs and CoP@PCNFs are basically similar to those of CoP/FeP@PCNFs (Fig. S5†). The sp2/(sp2 + sp3) ratios for CoP/FeP@PCNFs, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs are calculated to be 56.6%, 65.6%, and 64%, respectively. This result indicates that the graphitization degree of CoP/FeP@PCNFs is lower than that of CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs, which is well consistent with the Raman results.44 In Fig. 2f, four peaks in the N 1s spectrum for CoP/FeP@PCNFs can be observed: N-6 (pyridinic-N at 398.3 eV), N-5 (pyrrolic-N at 400.2 eV), N-Q (quaternary-N at 401.5 eV) and N-X (oxidized-N at 404.1 eV). The content of N-5 and N-6 is relatively high, which is beneficial for providing active sites for sodium storage.47 The N 1s spectra of FeP@PCNFs and CoP@PCNFs are also shown in Fig. S5.† The proportions of different N-configurations for CoP/FeP@PCNFs, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs are basically the same (Table S1†), indicating that the nitrogen groups in these three samples should have similar contributions to the electrochemical performance. The Co 2p and Fe 2p spectra of CoP/FeP@PCNFs, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs are shown in Fig. 2g. The Co 2p spectrum of the CoP/FeP@PCNFs shows two main peaks located at 781.3 and 798.3 eV for Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2, along with two satellite peaks centered at 785.1 and 803.6 eV.48 In addition, the peaks located at 778.6 and 789.6 eV correspond to Co–P in the CoP/FeP@PCNFs.49,50 In the Fe 2p spectrum of the CoP/FeP@PCNFs, the peaks centered at 712.7 and 725.6 eV correspond to the Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 orbitals, along with two satellite peaks located at 716.4 and 728.7 eV. Moreover, the peaks observed at 707.5 and 720.8 eV are ascribed to Fe–P in the CoP/FeP@PCNFs.48,51 Compared with CoP@PCNFs, the main peaks and corresponding satellite peaks of Co 2p in CoP/FeP@PCNFs move towards a lower binding energy. In contrast, the peaks of Fe 2p in CoP/FeP@PCNFs shift to a higher binding energy compared with FeP@PCNFs.49–51 These results show that the electron density around Co increases and the electron density around Fe decreases in CoP/FeP@PCNFs, which is caused by the electron interaction between Fe and Co elements. As illustrated in Fig. 3h, the P 2p of CoP/FeP@PCNFs is deconvoluted into four peaks. Typically, the peaks located at 129.8 and 130.3 eV indicate the formation of a metal phosphide.39,52 Besides, the peaks at 133.6 and 134.4 eV can be assigned to P–C and oxidized P species, respectively.

3.2 Electrochemical performance of CoP/FeP@PCNFs
The Na+ insertion/extraction performance of CoP/FeP@PCNFs was first assessed using CV curves between 0.001 and 3.0 V at 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 3a). In the first scan, a large irreversible cathodic peak can be observed below 1 V due to the Na+ insertion into CoP/FeP and the irreversible solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation.53 A pair of sharp peaks is observed near 0.02/0.07 V, which can be attributed to the Na+ insertion/extraction among graphitic layers and edge defects.54 One anodic peak appears at 1.6–2.1 V, corresponding to the extraction of Na+ from FeP and CoP.31,55 In the following scans, a wide cathodic peak appears at 0.8–1.5 V, resulting from the structural changes during the initial discharge process.56,57 Note that, except for the first scan, the following scans are overlapped, suggesting the high reversibility of the electrochemical reaction in CoP/FeP@PCNFs. For the FeP@PCNF electrode (Fig. S6†), the redox peaks at 1.1/1.8 V correspond to the insertion and extraction for FeP. For the CoP@PCNF electrode (Fig. S6†), a wide cathodic peak at 0.5–1.0 V and an anodic peak at 0.5–1.5 V correspond to the sodiation and desodiation processes of CoP.

Fig. 3b and Fig. S7† show the galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles under a current density of 0.05 A g−1. The initial discharge and charge capacities of CoP/FeP@PCNFs are 736 and 459 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, respectively, showing a relatively high initial coulombic efficiency of 63%, which is much higher than that of CoP@PCNFs (56%) and FeP@PCNFs (53%). In the first cycle, the loss of irreversible capacity can be ascribed to the formation of a dense SEI film on the surface of the active material, which is common for transition metal phosphide anode materials.58Fig. 3c compares the rate performances of the CoP/FeP@PCNFs, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs at various current densities. The CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 459, 424, 356, 261 and 213 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.05, 0.1, 1, 5 and 10 A g−1, while the CoP@PCNFs/FeP@PCNF electrode shows a low specific capacity of 294/356, 265/34, 184/244, 98/129, and 72/106 mA h g−1 at 0.05, 0.1, 1, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The capacity retention ratio at 10 A g−1 relative to 0.05 A g−1 is calculated to be 46.4%, 24.5%, and 29.7% for CoP/FeP@PCNFs, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs electrodes, respectively, further indicating that the rate performance of CoP/FeP@PCNFs is greatly improved. The significantly improved rate capability for CoP/FeP@PCNFs can be ascribed to the formation of heterostructures. Moreover, when the current rolls back to 0.05 A g−1, the specific capacity of CoP/FeP@PCNFs can be restored to 470 mA h g−1. It is confirmed that the Co–P/Fe–P bond can withstand repeated Na+ insertion/extraction processes. It is noted that the average potential of metal phosphides is relatively high, which can lower the voltage of the full-cell battery. However, the CoP/FeP@PCNF anode with a high specific capacity and superior rate performance can be used to assemble hybrid sodium ion capacitors by coupling with a capacitor-type cathode, which shows great potential in achieving both high energy and high power characteristics. In addition to the excellent rate capability, the CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode shows excellent cycling stability (Fig. 3d). It should be noted that the CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 208 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The capacity retention of the CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode after 1000 cycles is 74%, superior to that of CoP@PCNFs (53%) and FeP@PCNFs (46%). The SEM and TEM images of CoP/FeP@PCNFs after cycling further reveal the outstanding structural stability (Fig. S8†). During the long-term cycling test, the overall nanofiber structure of CoP/FeP@PCNFs can be maintained, and CoP/FeP nanoparticles can be clearly observed in carbon nanofibers. Therefore, it can be concluded that porous carbon nanofibers can effectively alleviate the volume vibration of CoP/FeP nanoparticles during the sodiation/desodiation process, which is beneficial for improving the cycling stability of the electrode. Additionally, compared with other phosphides, the as-obtained bimetallic phosphide also shows higher specific capacity and better cycling stability (Table S2†). Besides, compared with one of the most advanced samples (RGO@CoP@FeP),31 the preparation of the CoP/FeP@PCNF anode by the electrospinning technique is relatively facile, avoiding the complicated procedures.
To gain more insights into the superior cycling performance of the CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode, EIS measurement was executed (Fig. 4e and S9†). The charge transfer resistance (Rct) is indexed as a distinct semicircle in the intermediate frequency region, and ohmic resistance (Rs) can be determined from the intercept on the Zre axis in the high frequency region, which is relevant to the internal resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface in SIBs. Before cycling, the charge transfer resistance of CoP/FeP@PCNFs (111.7 Ω) is lower than that of FeP@PCNFs (174.7 Ω) and CoP@PCNFs (208.4 Ω), which proves that the CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode has excellent charge transfer ability. As shown in Fig. 3e, the Rct of the CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode decreases with the increase of cycle number, being 25.1/10.7/9.4/7.4 Ω after 1/100/500/1000 cycles, and the activation of electrode materials during the repeated charging and discharging process should occur. The relatively low Rct should be responsible for the improved cycling stability of the CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode.

(f) Normalized capacitive contribution ratios at different scan rates for CoP/FeP@PCNFs, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs. 
To reveal the sodium storage mechanism of CoP/FeP@PCNFs, ex situ XRD measurements were carried out at different charging and discharging stages. As displayed in Fig. 3f, several diffraction peaks of FeP and CoP can be easily detected from the fresh anode. After being discharged to 0.3 V, the characteristic peaks of CoP and FeP become significantly lower or disappear. Meanwhile, the three notable diffraction peaks around 37.2°, 44.1° and 47.0° emerged, which can be ascribed to the (103) plane of Na3P (PDF 74-1164), the (110) plane of Fe (PDF 87-0721) and the (101) plane of Co (PDF 89-4308). When further discharged to 0.01 V, the appearance of a new peak at 20.2° corresponds to the (002) crystal face of Na3P (PDF 74-1164). The peaks at 37.2°, 44.1° and 47.0° for Na3P, Fe and Co become stronger, and the peaks for the metal phosphide completely disappeared. This observation indicates that the metal phosphide converts to Na3P and metals during the discharging process. During the charging process, Na3P and metal elemental peaks become weaker when the voltage reaches 1.9 V, and the characteristic peaks of the metal phosphide appear when charged to 3.0 V. Therefore, it is proved that the transformation mechanism of metal phosphides can be expressed as the following eqn (1): CoP/FeP + 3Na+ + 3e− ↔ Na3P + Co/Fe(1)
3.3 Kinetics analysis
The sodium-ion diffusion coefficient (DNa) was characterized by the GITT test (Fig. S10†), and GITT curves of all samples are shown in Fig. 4a. As depicted in Fig. 4b, in the process of sodiation, the DNa profile of the bare CoP@PCNF and FeP@PCNF electrodes exhibits more obvious fluctuations than that of the CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode, and the DNa of CoP/FeP@PCNFs is a factor of 2–29 higher than that of the CoP@PCNF and FeP@PCNF electrodes during sodiation, which further verifies that the diffusion of sodium ions is more easy in CoP/FeP@PCNFs. The improved DNa of CoP/FeP@PCNFs during sodiation is due to the formation of hetero-CoP/FeP, resulting in improved conductivity and fast reaction kinetics of sodium ions. As demonstrated in Fig. 4c, with the increase of desodiation depth, the CoP/FeP@PCNF, CoP@PCNF and FeP@PCNF electrodes show a downward trend, and the DNa value of CoP/FeP@PCNFs is slightly higher than that of FeP@PCNFs and CoP@PCNFs, which is also closely related to the formed heterogeneous structure.
To further investigate the kinetics behaviors of CoP/FeP@PCNFs, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs, CV curves were obtained at various scan rates from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 (Fig. 4d and Fig. S11a, b†). The b-values were calculated by using the peak current (i, mA) and the scan rate (v, mV s−1), which obeys the following eqn (2): log(i) = blog(v) + log(a)(2)
In short, if the b value approaches to 0.5, it suggests that the electrochemical process is diffusion-dominated. Nevertheless, if the b value approaches to 1.0, it indicates the capacitive-dominated process. Fig. 4e and Fig S11c, d† show the b values of the four redox peaks of the CoP/FeP@PCNFs, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs. The b-values for A1, A2, C1, and C2 peaks of the CoP/FeP@PCNFs were calculated to be 0.97, 0.83, 0.91, and 0.87, respectively. In particular, the b values of A1 and C1 peaks in the CoP/FeP@PCNFs, CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs are all close to 1, implying that the process of sodium ion insertion/extraction in the carbon matrix is fast capacitive-dominant. The pair of A2/C2 peaks corresponds to the process of sodiation/desodiation between the metal phosphide and sodium ions, and the high b value of A2/C2 peaks for CoP/FeP@PCNFs indicates the fast redox reaction process. By comparing the b values, we can conclude that CoP/FeP@PCNF has a faster reaction rate of sodiation/desodiation than CoP@PCNF and FeP@PCNF. The contribution ratios of diffusion-controlled and capacitive-controlled processes can be expressed in the following eqn (3): i(V) = iReact + iDiff = k1v + k2v1/2(3)in which k1v and k2v1/2 represent capacitive contribution and diffusion-limited contribution. Fig. 4f displays the portion of capacitive contributions at various scan rates. The capacitive contribution is increased with the increase of scan rate, and the capacitive contribution for CoP/FeP@PCNF is 87.4% at 1.0 mV s−1 (Fig. 4f). Moreover, the capacitive contribution ratio of CoP/FeP@PCNFs is higher than that of CoP@PCNFs and FeP@PCNFs, which is greatly related to the heterostructures formed in CoP/FeP@PCNFs and the highly developed porous structure of CoP/FeP@PCNFs.
3.4 DFT calculation
With the coexistence of CoP and FeP, it is inevitable to form partial heterogeneous structures in CoP/FeP@PCNFs. For investigating electronic properties at their interfaces, it is necessary to use DFT calculation to study the electrical conductivity of heterostructures. The construction of FeP, CoP homogenous junctions and CoP/FeP heterostructures is shown in Fig. 5(a–f). Fig. 5g shows the electrostatic potential drop of the CoP/FeP interface heterojunction. It can be seen that the work function of CoP/FeP is 4.29 eV, which is lower than that of the CoP (4.35 eV) and FeP (4.37 eV) homogeneous junctions (Fig. S12†). The decrease in the work function is due to the formation of an internal electric field with a potential difference of about 2.51 eV between the layers, which improves the carrier migration ability. Therefore, electrons are more likely to escape from the CoP/FeP heterostructure Fig. 5h shows the density of states of the CoP/FeP heterostructure, and FeP and CoP homojunctions. It can be seen that the CoP/FeP heterostructure enables more electron density of states to pass through the Fermi level. An interlayer deformation charge density diagram is shown in Fig. S13.† By constructing the CoP/FeP heterostructure, the overall charge distribution of the system becomes more even. The charge transfer between the layers is caused by the electric field, and the electric field between the layers drives the carrier migration. The electric field reduces the work function and increases the rate of charge transfer between layers. The Mulliken charge of electron transfer on the differential diagram is shown in Table S3,† further revealing that hetero-CoP/FeP has excellent electrical conductivity. In brief, the DFT calculation results demonstrate that the CoP/FeP heterostructure can not only improve the electrical conductivity of sodium ions, but also accelerate the migration of sodium ions, thus facilitating the electrochemical reaction kinetics.

(h) Density of states of FeP and CoP homogenous junctions and the CoP/FeP heterostructure. 
Overall, the superior electrochemical performance of the CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode can be ascribed to the following aspects (as demonstrated in Scheme 1): First, the 3D fibrous carbon structure can serve as a conductive network for facilitating the electron transport. Second, the porous structure ensures fast ion diffusion, and the large surface area can facilitate the exposure of abundant active sites for sodium ion storage. Third, voids in the porous nanofiber can effectively accommodate the volume expansion without cracking the electrode during cycling. Fourth, bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon nanofibers can avoid the agglomeration of the metal phosphide and shorten the diffusion path of ions. Last but not least, the construction of CoP/FeP heterostructures not only improves the conductivity of metal phosphides, but also accelerates the speed of ion migration.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated heterogeneous CoP/FeP nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon nanofibers via the coaxial electrospinning technique and low-temperature phosphatization process. The porous structure can accelerate smooth ion transport and buffer the volume expansion during charging/discharging processes. The hetero-CoP/FeP nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon nanofibers can possess rich redox reaction sites and a short Na+ diffusion path. Moreover, the heterostructure can induce a built-in electric field to enhance the conductivity, which facilitates rapid electron transfer and Na+ migration. As an anode for sodium ion batteries, the CoP/FeP@PCNF exhibits a high reversible specific capacity (∼459 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1) with fast kinetics characteristic. Even at a high current density of 10 A g−1, CoP/FeP@PCNF shows a high capacity of 213 mA h g−1. It is worth noting that the rate performance and cycling stability of the CoP/FeP@PCNF electrode are superior to those of the FeP@PCNFs and CoP@PCNFs electrodes. The ex situ XRD analysis confirms the conversion reaction mechanism of CoP/FeP during sodium ion insertion and extraction. The design of bimetallic phosphide with heterostructures demonstrates a potential route for constructing high-performance SIBs anodes, which can be extended to other metal oxide/sulfide/phosphide electrodes.
