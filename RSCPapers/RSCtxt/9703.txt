    , Accepted 15th February 2016First published on 15th February 2016AbstractBismuth molybdate photocatalysts with different phase structures and morphologies were controllably synthesized via a refluxing method by adjusting the pH in the reaction system. Bi2MoO6 nanosheets were easily obtained under acidic conditions, while Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 nanoparticles were formed in circumneutral and basic solutions. The mechanism for the formation and phase transition of these two bismuth molybdates is based on tuning the pH value, which can control the growth rate along different crystal axes and the formation of different hydrolysis products that act as the initial seeds of the crystallographic phases. The photocatalytic activity of the Bi2MoO6 nanosheets for MB and MO degradation was higher than that of the Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 nanoparticles under visible light irradiation, and the highest photocatalytic activity was observed for the Bi2MoO6 nanosheets prepared at pH 6.0. The high visible-light photocatalytic activity of the Bi2MoO6 nanosheets arises from the easy separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–holes in the nanosheet’s structure as well as the narrow band gap, which leads to an improvement in the visible absorption ability. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and a photogenerated carrier trapping experiment suggested that both Bi2MoO6 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 had the same photocatalytic mechanism and the main oxidative species for these samples was the hydroxyl radical.
1. Introduction
In recent decades, TiO2 has been investigated and used widely for the photodegradation of organic pollutants in water owing to its low cost, strong oxidizing power, and nontoxic nature.1,2 However, the requirement of UV light for effective photocatalysis severely hinders the overall process for use in practical applications. Therefore, many attempts have been made to prepare visible-light-driven photocatalysts such as BiVO4, Bi2Ti2O7, ZnFe2O4, Bi2WO6 and bismuth molybdates.3–7 Among these visible-light catalysts, bismuth molybdates, with the general chemical formula Bi2O3·nMoO3 (n = 1, 2, 3), have been reported as excellent photocatalysts and solar-energy-conversion materials for both water splitting and the degradation of organic compounds.8–10
Up until now, a number of different bismuth molybdate photocatalysts, including α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, γ-Bi2MoO6 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55, have has been synthesized and studied. Of these bismuth molybdates, only γ-Bi2MoO6 has been commonly reported and structurally characterized due to its unique layered structure, narrow band gap and visible-light-response properties. Some bismuth molybdates, such as cubic Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55, have seldom been reported. The construction of a heterostructured photocatalyst by combining cubic phase Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 and orthorhombic phase Bi2MoO6 has previously shown greatly improved visible-light photocatalytic activity.11,12 In general, heterostructured photocatalysts containing the same elements, but different phases such as Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55/Bi2MoO6, Bi7O9I3/Bi5O7I, BiOBr/Bi24O31Br10, etc. have been fabricated by adjusting the phase transformation through control of the synthesis conditions. However, the mechanism of the phase transition between these photocatalysts containing the same elements, but different phases has seldom been discussed. Furthermore, until now, only a few investigations have concerned the preparation and characterization of Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 as a photocatalyst.13,14 Therefore, the preparation method and formation mechanism of Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 needs to be further studied. The relationship between the morphology, structure, composition and the photocatalytic activity remain to be clarified.
It is well-known that photocatalytic properties strongly depend on the morphology and structure of the catalyst. Therefore, physical and chemical methods such as solvothermal (hydrothermal) reactions,15–17 solid-state reactions,18 co-precipitation19 and sol–gel methods20 have been used to synthesize nanostructured Bi2MoO6 with different morphologies. For example, Long et al.15 synthesized single crystalline Bi2MoO6 nanobelts (BMNBs) with dominant (010) facets via an oleyamine-mediated hydrothermal method. The experimental results demonstrated that the as-prepared BMNBs exhibited higher activity than their counterparts, which were hierarchical nanorod-based microspheres. Fu and coworkers7 fabricated novel hierarchical flower-like Bi2MoO6 hollow spheres via a solvothermal process in the presence of ethylene glycol, and showed that they exhibited excellent visible-light-driven photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of Rhodamine B, which was much higher than that of Bi2MoO6 prepared by a solid-state reaction and TiO2 (P25). Zhu et al.16 transformed the morphology of Bi2MoO6 from a 2D sheet-like structure to a 1D rod-like structure through a facile, pH-controlled, surfactant-free hydrothermal route. The Bi2MoO6 nanosheets prepared under acidic conditions exhibited a visible-light photocatalytic activity 12 times higher than Bi2MoO6 microrods prepared under basic conditions. However, the conventional methods for preparing these photocatalysts have generally been carried out at high temperature and high pressure, which limits possible industrial production. Therefore, a simple method needed to be developed for the preparation of bismuth molybdates.
In this paper, a refluxing method has been developed to controllably synthesize two different forms of bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55). This method was carried out at ambient pressure. Therefore, this method is favorable for large-scale industrial production. The morphologies of these bismuth molybdates were tailored by adjusting the pH value of the reaction system. The effect of the pH value on the morphology and structure was studied. Furthermore, the relationships between the morphologies and structures of the bismuth molybdates and their visible light photoactivities was discussed. The formation mechanism for these two bismuth molybdates has been preliminarily explained, and the phase transition mechanism between them is presented. The visible-light photodegradation mechanisms for Bi2MoO6 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 have also been investigated.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials preparation
All of the chemicals were of analytic grade and used without further purification. The photocatalyst was prepared as follows: appropriate amounts of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and Na2MoO4·2H2O were added into 120 mL of deionized water and stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The pH of the resulting suspension was adjusted from 1.0 to 11.0 by adding appropriate amounts of HNO3 and NaOH solution. After being vigorously stirred for 30 min, the resulting precursor suspension was transferred into a 250 mL three-neck flask, which was subsequently heated at reflux (100 °C) for 12 h. The resulting solid was separated by centrifugation and washed with water, then dried in air at 90 °C for 8 h.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Bruker D8-advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The morphologies and structures of the prepared samples were further examined with a JEM-2010 field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and a SU8010 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were obtained in the range of 200 to 800 nm using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer, which was equipped with an integrated sphere attachment, and BaSO4 was used as a reference sample. The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of radicals spin-trapped by a spin-trap reagent, 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pirroline-N-oxide (DMPO) (Sigma Chemical Co.), were examined using a Bruker model ESR JES-FA200 spectrometer equipped with a quanta-Ray Nd:YAG laser system as the irradiation source (λ = 420 nm). The same type of quartz capillary tube was used for all ESR measurements in order to minimize any experimental error. The ESR spectrometer was coupled to a computer for data acquisition and instrument control. Magnetic parameters of the radicals detected were obtained from direct measurements of the magnetic field and microwave frequency. Raman spectra were recorded using a HORIBA JY HR800 confocal microscope Raman spectrometer employing an Ar-ion laser (514.5 nm). All spectra were calibrated with respect to a silicon wafer at 520.7 cm−1. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at 0.0 V. A sinusoidal ac perturbation of 5 mV was applied to the electrode over a frequency range of 0.05–105 Hz. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were recorded on a FT-IR spectrometer using conventional KBr pellets within a wavenumber range of 2000–450 cm−1 with a resolution of 1 cm−1. A total organic carbon analyzer (MultiN/C 2100, Jena) was employed for the mineralization degree analysis of the dye solutions.
2.3. Photocatalytic tests
The photocatalytic activity of the materials was evaluated via the decomposition of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The radial flux was measured using a power meter from the Institute of Electric Light Sources, Beijing. The visible irradiation was obtained from a 500 W xenon lamp (Xujiang Electromechanical Plant, Nanjing, China) with a 420 nm cutoff filter. 25 mg of photocatalyst was completely dispersed in an aqueous solution of MB (50 mL, 0.01 mM). Before irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 90 min in order to reach an absorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and MB. At specific time intervals, 3 mL aliquots were sampled and centrifuged to remove the particles. The concentration of the MB was measured by recording the absorbance at the characteristic band of 663 nm using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer.
The main oxidative species responsible for the photocatalytic activity could be detected via trapping experiments of the active species. Specifically, hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), holes (h+) and superoxide radicals (O2˙−) were investigated by adding 1.0 mM tert-butanol and 1 mM ammonium oxalate ((NH4)2C2O4·H2O), then purging the MB or MO solution with N2 prior to the addition of the photocatalyst.21,22 The experimental process was similar to the photodegradation experiment.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structure control
The crystalline structures of the as-prepared samples were examined by X-ray diffraction. Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the bismuth molybdate samples obtained using the refluxing procedure at different pH values. The materials obtained under acidic conditions (pH 1.0, pH 3.0, pH 5.0 and pH 6.0) were similar in crystal structure and could be identified as having a layered orthorhombic Bi2MoO6 phase (JCPDS 76-2388).16 For these samples, the intensity ratio of the (1 3 1) to (2 0 0) peak was below 3.5, while the intensity of the (1 3 1) peak in the XRD pattern is usually about six times stronger than that of the (2 0 0) peak in the standard XRD pattern, implying that there is a special anisotropy of the crystal that grows along the (010) plane.16 This fact is the direct reason for the formation of the sheet-like structure of the Bi2MoO6 crystals, which was confirmed by the SEM and TEM images. Furthermore, the peak intensity increases with pH from 1.0 to 6.0, suggesting that a higher pH is favorable for the crystal growth. This high crystallinity might be favorable for high photocatalytic activity. When the pH is increased to 6.5, the characteristic peaks of the Bi2MoO6 phase disappear and mixed phases of Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 and Bi2O3 appear. After further increasing the pH from 7.0 to 11.0, the Bi2MoO6 and Bi2O3 phases disappear and a new phase attributed to cubic Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 (JCPDS 43-0446) appears.11 The peaks intensities for the Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 crystal phase gradually increase with increasing pH from 7.0 to 11.0, suggesting that alkaline conditions are favorable for the formation of the Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 phase.

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the as-synthesized bismuth molybdate samples at different pH values. As can be seen in the images, pH has a significant influence the morphologies of the bismuth molybdate samples. Under acidic conditions (pH ≤ 6.0), all of the Bi2MoO6 crystals possess an irregular sheet-shaped structure with a thickness of several nanometers. As the pH increases from 1.0 to 6.0, the as-obtained Bi2MoO6 nanosheets gradually grow in width from 63 nm to 234 nm and in thickness from 16 nm to 35 nm. When the pH is 6.5 (Fig. 2E), many irregular nanoparticles with diameters ranging from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers appear, in coexistence with a small amount of nanosheets. These nanoparticles agglomerate together to form large spherical aggregates. At pH 7.0 (Fig. 2F), the nanoparticles become bigger and nanowires appear. As the pH increases from 7.0 to 11.0 (Fig. 3F–H), both the size of the nanoparticles and the length of nanowires gradually increase. Furthermore, under alkaline conditions (pH 9.0 and 11.0), the bismuth molybdate nanoparticles become more irregular and exhibit diamond-like shapes.

TEM images of the bismuth molybdate samples obtained at different pH values are shown in Fig. 3A–H. Under acidic conditions (pH 1.0, pH 3.0, pH 5.0 and pH 6.0), all of the Bi2MoO6 crystals exhibit sheet-like structures with the plate size increasing from 40 nm to 200 nm as the pH value changes from pH 1.0 to pH 6.0 (Fig. 3A–D), which is in agreement with the SEM characterization. When the pH is 6.5 (Fig. 3E), it seems that many small Bi2O3 nanoparticles with sizes ranging from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers grow on the surfaces of some of the larger particles. As the pH increases from the 7.0 to 11.0, these spherical nanoparticles gradually grow into diamond-like bismuth molybdate particles, which coexist with a large number of nanowires. The average size of these spherical nanoparticles also increases from 50 nm to 200 nm.
HRTEM images of the bismuth molybdate samples prepared at different pH values are shown in Fig. 4. Interlayer spacings of 0.274 nm, 0.275 nm and 0.326 nm corresponding to the (0 0 2), (2 0 0) and (0 4 1) crystal planes of orthorhombic Bi2MoO6, respectively, can be observed in the samples prepared at pH 3.0 (Fig. 4a), pH 5.0 (Fig. 4b) and pH 6.0 (Fig. 4c). When the pH value is 6.5 (Fig. 4d), d spacings of 0.39 nm and 0.33 nm corresponding to the lattice spacings of the (1 1 0) and (1 1 1) crystal planes of Bi2O3 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55, respectively, are observed showing that new phases of Bi2O3 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 have been formed. For the samples prepared under basic conditions (Fig. 4e and f), d spacings of 0.281 nm and 0.325 nm corresponding to the (2 0 0) and (1 1 1) crystal planes of the cubic Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 phase, respectively, can be observed, revealing that the phase transformation of the bismuth molybdate appears to be controlled the pH of the reaction system. The phase transformation of the bismuth molybdate agrees well with the XRD results.

Raman spectroscopy is an effective method for probing the local structure of materials because the Raman spectrum reflects the bonding states in the coordination polyhedra of a material. Raman spectra of the bismuth molybdate samples obtained at different pH values were recorded at room temperature and are depicted in Fig. 5. Generally, the Raman modes at 841 cm−1 (w, sh), 797 cm−1 (vs), 711 cm−1 (m), 399 cm−1 (m), 346 cm−1 (s), 321 cm−1 (w), 279 cm−1 (s), 191 cm−1 (m) and 145 cm−1 (m) can be assigned to stretching vibrations and are characteristic peaks of Bi2MoO6 (Fig. 5a). The modes near 321 cm−1, 346 cm−1 and 399 cm−1 correspond to the Eu symmetry bending modes of the MoO6 octahedra, and the Raman mode near 279 cm−1 most likely originates from the Eg mode bending vibration of the MoO6 octahedra.17 All samples have a band at 145 cm−1, which can be assigned to the lattice modes of Bi3+ atoms mainly in the direction perpendicular to the layers. The bismuth molybdate samples prepared at pH 1.0, pH 3.0, pH 5.0 and pH 6.0 have similar Raman vibration modes to the Bi2MoO6 phase (Fig. 5a). However, when the pH is > 6.0, the characteristic Raman vibration modes of the MoO6 octahedra disappear and two new peaks at 875 cm−1, 298 cm−1 appear, indicating that the structure of orthorhombic Bi2MoO6 has been destroyed and a new phase of cubic Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 has formed. The changes observed in the Raman vibration modes with pH suggest that the pH value can control the phase transformation of bismuth molybdate.
 Fig. 5  (a) Raman spectra of the bismuth molybdate samples obtained at different pH values and (b) a partially enlarged section of the Raman spectra. 
It has been reported that the Raman modes that usually appear around 797 cm−1 (A1g mode) and 845 cm−1 (A2u mode) can be assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the MoO6 octahedra, which involve motions of the apical oxygen atoms perpendicular to the layers.10 Variations in the width and relative position of these two bands suggest that the stretching modes of the Mo–O bonds are different. As shown in Fig. 5b, as the pH increases from 1.0 to 6.0, the strong bands at 797 cm−1 and 837 cm−1 were found to shift to 794 cm−1 and 841 cm−1, respectively. These minute shifts in position suggest that there might be some subtle rearrangements in the structure23 and confirm that the pH of the reaction system could result in structural changes of the MoO6 octahedra related to their apical oxygen atoms. This fact agrees with the SEM and TEM results that show the thickness of the Bi2MoO6 nanosheet gradually becomes larger as the pH value increases from 1.0 to 6.0. Meanwhile, the Raman band intensity increases with pH due to the increase in crystallinity.

Fig. 6 shows the FT-IR spectra of the Bi2MoO6 samples obtained at different pH values. Two regions can be observed: one in the 950–700 cm−1 range, where the Mo–O stretching bands are recorded, and the other in the 600–450 cm−1 range, corresponding to stretching and deformation modes that involve Bi–O bonds.24–26 The bands at around 843 and 796 cm−1 can be assigned as the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of MoO6 involving vibrations of the apical oxygen atoms, respectively. The band at 731 cm−1 can be attributed to the asymmetric stretching mode of MoO6 involving vibrations of the equatorial oxygen atoms, while the bands at 603 and 573 cm−1 correspond to the bending vibrations of MoO6.10 All of the characteristic absorption bands of MoO6 disappear and a broad absorption band between 720 and 850 cm−1 appears when the pH is ≥ 6.5. This phenomenon shows that the octahedral MoO6 structure was completely destroyed and a new structure for the bismuth molybdate phase was formed. It should be noted that an obvious absorption peak at 1385 cm−1, which can be assigned to the vibration of NO3−, was observed in the samples prepared at pH 1.0, pH 3.0 and pH 5.0. Furthermore, the intensity of this peak decreases as the pH increases from 1.0 to 5.0, and it almost disappears at pH 6.0. This could mean that these samples contain small amounts of hydrolysis products such as BiONO3 and Bi2O2(OH)NO3. This fact also indicates that BiONO3 and Bi2O2(OH)NO3 do not participate in the formation reaction of Bi2MoO6 because the hydrolysis reaction was inhibited to some extent under the strongly acidic conditions. The disappearance of the absorption peak at 1385 cm−1 at pH 6.0 means that most of the BiONO3 and Bi2O2(OH)NO3 has engaged in the reaction, and suggests that an increase in pH can promote the hydrolysis reaction and the growth of the Bi2MoO6 crystal. This phenomenon is consistent with the XRD results, which showed that the crystallinity of Bi2MoO6 increased with pH.

3.2. Formation mechanism of the bismuth molybdate nanostructures
In general, the shapes of nanostructures are strongly dependent on their relative chemical potential. It has been reported that orthorhombic Bi2MoO6 is constructed from corner-sharing MoO6 octahedra layers with layers of [Bi2O2]2+ atoms sandwiched between these MoO6 octahedra. On the basis of this Bi2MoO6 structure, facets that are perpendicular to the chains of the octahedral MoO6 usually have a much higher chemical potential in comparison to other facets. Therefore, the crystal growth preferentially occurs along the layer. Under low pH conditions (pH ≤ 6.0), there should be abundant H+ in the system to adsorb onto the (0 1 0) crystal planes and even onto the (0 0 1) and (1 0 0) planes. Due to the high density of oxygen atoms on the (0 1 0) planes, this leads to a remarkable reduction in the surface energy of the (1 0 0) planes. Therefore, it is possible to form a relatively thin layer along the [0 1 0] direction.27 It can be seen that all samples prepared under acidic conditions exhibit a nanosheet-like structure. With an increase in pH from 1.0 to 6.0, both the length and the thickness of these Bi2MoO6 nanosheets become larger. However, when the pH of the solution is higher than 6.5, the H+ concentration sharply decreases, causing the surface free energies of the various crystallographic planes to change significantly. The surface energies of these planes, which are the dominant source of adsorption for OH−, decreases thus slowing down the growth of their related facets. Subsequently, enlargement in the a, b planes becomes prohibited and the growth rate of nuclei along the [0 1 0] direction increases. It is important this change in the growth rate for the various crystallographic planes promotes the formation of the new Bi2O3 and cubic Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 phases. This fact is confirmed by the XRD, TEM and Raman results. Under alkaline conditions (pH ≥ 6.5), the Bi2MoO6 nanosheets disappear. With a further increase in the pH value, Bi2O3 nanoparticles first begin to appear, which are finally completely transformed into a cubic Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 phase with spherical structures. Therefore, pH significantly influences the morphologies and phase structures of the bismuth molybdate products.
The remarkably distinct morphologies and phase structures of the bismuth molybdate products at different pH values are determined by the transformations of the Bi and Mo precursors. It is well known that Bi(NO3)3·2H2O, a strong-acid weak-base salt, ionizes into Bi3+ and NO3−1 (eqn (1)) in strongly acidic solutions or hydrolyzes in water to yield BiONO3 (eqn (2)), which can then be converted to Bi2O2(OH)NO3 (eqn (3)) and Bi2O3 (eqn (4)) in weakly acidic solution. The appearance of BiONO3 and Bi2O2(OH)NO3 hydrolysis products at pH ≤ 6.0 was confirmed by FI-IR spectroscopy. These hydrolysis products react with MoO42− to afford amorphous Bi2MoO6. Subsequently, the amorphous Bi2MoO6 gradually transforms into orthorhombic Bi2MoO6 during the refluxing reaction process (eqn (5)–(8)). When the pH value in the reaction solution is higher than 6.5, Bi2O3 nanoparticles are formed, which react with MoO42− or amorphous Bi2MoO6 to afford a cubic Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 phase during the refluxing method (eqn (9)–(11)).

3.3. Photocatalytic performance and mechanism of the visible-light photoactivity enhancement
UV-DRS spectra of the bismuth molybdate samples obtained at different pH values are shown in Fig. 7. All of the products exhibit absorption bands in the visible light region, which represent the characteristic absorption of bismuth molybdate samples. As expected, the bismuth molybdate samples prepared under acidic conditions (pH 1.0 to pH 6.0) have almost the same fundamental absorption edge as Bi2MoO6. As the pH increases from pH 1.0 to pH 6.0, the absorption edge decreases from 480 nm to 476 nm (the band gap changes from 2.58 eV to 2.60 eV), suggesting only a small blue shift of the absorption edge occurs with the change in pH. However, after the pH exceeds 6.0, the absorption edge exhibits a large blue shift. At pH 6.5, pH 7.0, pH 9.0 and pH 11.0, the absorption edge is 457 nm, 452 nm, 432 nm and 428 nm, respectively. This suggests that the Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 phase formed has a larger band gap compared to that of Bi2MoO6. The reduction of the visible-light absorption might be one of the direct reasons for the lower visible-light photoactivity of Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 compared to Bi2MoO6.

Fig. 8 displays apparent rate constants for the photocatalytic degradation of MB (Fig. 8a) and MO (Fig. 8b) over the samples obtained at different pH values under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). A blank experiment without the catalyst under same conditions was conducted to show the self-degradation of the dye. Fig. 8a shows that the self-degradation of MB is a little higher than MB degradation over the samples at pH 9 and pH 11. One reason for this is that experimental error exists among the different experimental tests. Another reason is that the catalyst in the dye solution would shade the light, resulting in a decrease in dye self-degradation. In Fig. 8a, the photocatalytic activity of Bi2MoO6 samples for MB degradation increases with the increase in pH from 1.0 to 6.0 and the sample obtained at pH 6.0 exhibited the best photocatalytic activity. A reason for this might be the increase in the crystallinity of Bi2MoO6 with the increase in the pH value of the reaction system. After the pH exceeds 6.0, the photocatalytic activity sharply decreases. Fig. 8b shows the photocatalytic performance of the different Bi2MoO6 samples for MO degradation. The trend in the photocatalytic activity of MO degradation over the Bi2MoO6 samples is the same as that for the MB degradation. The Bi2MoO6 sample obtained at pH 6.0 exhibits the best photocatalytic activity for MO degradation, and the samples prepared under acidic conditions have better photocatalytic activities than those prepared under alkaline conditions. These results confirm that the Bi2MoO6 nanosheets have superior photocatalytic activity compared with the Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 nanoparticles. The higher photocatalytic activity can be explained by two reasons: the first possible reason is that the thinness of the nanosheets results in a relatively large distortion of the unit cell due to a large amount of surface strain, and this nanosheet structure is helpful for the generation of electron–holes inside the crystal that transfer to the surface and then react with MB. The second reason is that the band gaps of the Bi2MoO6 samples are much lower than those of the Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 samples, which means they have a higher visible light absorption ability.

To further investigate the mineralization properties of the Bi2MoO6 samples, the total organic carbon (TOC) in the MB solution was determined, as shown in Fig. 9. The TOC removal efficiency is consistent with the MB photodegradation activity. After 5 h of photodegradation over the Bi2MoO6 samples at pH 6.0 and pH 9.0, the concentration decreases are 38% and 24%, while the TOC removal efficiencies are 17% and 6%, respectively. This shows that not all of the MB dye was mineralized into CO2, and parts of it were converted into intermediate products. The TOC removal efficiency of the Bi2MoO6 sample at pH 6.0 is higher that of the Bi2MoO6 sample at pH 9.0, suggesting that the Bi2MoO6 sample at pH 6.0 has a better mineralization ability.

It is necessary to evaluate the long-term stability of a photocatalyst during reaction for the practical applications. Therefore, a stability test was performed by recycling the reaction four times for the photodegradation of MB over the Bi2MoO6 sample (pH 6.0) under visible light irradiation (Fig. 10). As shown in Fig. 10, no obvious loss of photocatalytic activity of the Bi2MoO6 sample (pH 6.0) was observed for MB degradation after four cycles, suggesting that this Bi2MoO6 catalyst is stable during the reaction.

The interface charge separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes was investigated using typical EIS (presented as Nyquist plots). The radius of the arc on the EIS spectra reflects the interface layer resistance occurring at the surface of the electrode. A smaller arc radius implies a higher efficiency of charge transfer.28Fig. 11 shows the EIS Nyquist plots for the Bi2MoO6 samples obtained at different pH values in aqueous solution under visible light illumination. The arc radii of the samples obtained under acidic conditions are smaller than those of the samples obtained under alkaline conditions. When the pH is 6.0, the arc radius of the sample is the smallest, demonstrating that this sample has the best separation and transfer efficiency for photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The trend in the EIS spectra is consistent with the photocatalytic activity of the bismuth molybdate samples. The reason for high photocatalytic activity of the Bi2MoO6 samples might be that the thin nanosheet structure is helpful for the transfer of electron–hole pairs because the photogenerated electrons and holes can transfer to the surface of the catalyst through a relatively shorter distance compared with the samples with spherical structures.

The main oxidative species could be detected by trapping experiments using (NH4)2C2O4·H2O as a hole scavenger and t-BuOH as a hydroxyl radical scavenger. N2 was used in order to avoid the formation of ˙O2− radicals. As shown in Fig. 12a and 11b, the photocatalytic MB degradation efficiencies over the Bi2MoO6 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 samples significantly decrease in the presence of 1 mM of (NH4)2C2O4·H2O, while there is only a minor change in the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies when adding t-BuOH or purging the system with N2. This shows that photogenerated holes are the major oxidative species for Bi2MoO6 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55, while hydroxyl radicals and ˙O2− radicals have little effect on the photodegradation of MB. Trapping experiments of the active species were also carried out during MO degradation to further confirm that the photogenerated holes were the major oxidative species for Bi2MoO6 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55, and hydroxyl radicals and ˙O2− radicals have little effect on the photodegradation of MO (Fig. S1†). The results were in agreement with the results for the MB degradation.

ESR is a useful tool for monitoring the main oxidative species in a reaction. DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) is nitrone spin trap generally used for trapping radicals by the generation of a stable free radical, either DMPO–˙OH or DMPO–˙O2−. Fig. 13a shows signals of the DMPO–˙OH adduct for Bi2MoO6 (pH = 6.0) and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 (pH = 9.0). The DMPO–˙OH signals in both of the samples have the typical hydroxyl radical quad peaks, indicating that the hydroxyl radicals are engaged in the photocatalytic process. The overall signal intensity for Bi2MoO6 (pH = 6.0) is obviously higher than that for Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 (pH = 9.0), suggesting that more hydroxyl radicals are produced during the reaction. This is a direct reason why Bi2MoO6 (pH = 6.0) has a higher photocatalytic activity than Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 (pH = 9.0). Fig. 13b shows the DMPO–˙O2− signals that occur when dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) is used as the solvent instead of water. No ˙O2− signals can be detected, suggesting that ˙O2− has hardly any effect upon the photodegradation of MB. Therefore, the ESR results show that ˙OH is the major oxidative species for Bi2MoO6 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 in the degradation of MB, which is in agreement with the trapping experiments for the active species.

4. Conclusions
Bismuth molybdates with different phase structures and morphologies were controllably synthesized through a refluxing method by adjusting the pH in the reaction system. Bi2MoO6 nanosheets were easily obtained under acidic conditions (pH ≤ 6.0), while Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 nanoparticles were formed under circumneutral and basic conditions (pH ≥ 6.5). The transformation of the phase structure and morphology of these two bismuth molybdates occurs by tuning the pH value in the reaction system, which results in modulation of the kinetics of nucleation and growth of the crystals due to the preferential adsorption of H+ onto different crystal facets and hydrolysis products, such as BiONO3, Bi2O2(OH)NO3 and Bi2O3, which act as initial seeds. The Bi2MoO6 nanosheets have higher visible light photocatalaytic activity than the Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 nanoparticles due to their nanosheet-like structure and relatively narrow band gap. The Bi2MoO6 nanosheets prepared at pH 6.0 have the highest photocatalytic activity. Active species trapping and ESR experiments showed that both Bi2MoO6 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 have the same photocatalytic mechanism and the main active species for the MB degradation is the hydroxyl radical.
