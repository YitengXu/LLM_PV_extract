    , Accepted 29th October 2016First published on 31st October 2016AbstractSilver nanowire (AgNW) networks, which are promising alternatives to indium tin oxide (ITO) as transparent conductive electrodes, have been a recent focus in the application of flexible optoelectronic devices. For the purpose of improving the optical and electrical performance of the network, herein, a novel “capillary-assisted fluidic assembly” technique is proposed, which simply involves a one-step solution process. Using this technique, numerous individual nanowires are well aligned over a large area with controlled density. In addition, the network with aligned AgNWs is consequently constructed, possessing remarkably improved optical and electrical performance (Rs = 16.6 Ω sq−1, T@550nm = 92.7%) as compared to that with random AgNWs. Large-scale polymer solar cells are taken as an example to demonstrate the efficacy of this technique and the device based on aligned AgNWs exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 6.01%, which is much higher than that based on random AgNWs. Notably, this is the highest efficiency reported to date using AgNW electrodes with a device area of 1.0 cm2. It is further found that the aligned AgNW networks exhibit significantly better mechanical stability than the brittle ITO films. This technique, which is compatible with roll-to-roll processes, shows promising potential in the continuous fabrication of large-area flexible optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) are essential components of various optoelectronic devices, such as touch panels, flat panel displays, organic light-emitting diodes and solar cells.1–4 While indium tin oxide (ITO) has dominated the TCE industry for several decades due to its well-proven technology and excellent opto-electrical performance, the inherent brittleness and high deposition temperature restrict its application in the next-generation flexible optoelectronics.1,2 Thus, several new classes of TCEs, including graphene,5–7 carbon nanotubes,8–10 conducting polymers,11–14 and metal nanowires,15,16 have been introduced to replace ITO. Silver nanowires (AgNWs), a subclass of metal nanowires, have been regarded as one of the most appealing alternatives because of their better optical and electrical performance which can match and readily exceed that of ITO.17–20
To date, AgNW networks are usually prepared by several solution-based processes, such as spin coating, rod coating, drop coating and spray coating, and the resulting NWs are randomly distributed.4 Thus, a considerable part of NWs almost make no contribution to the charge transportation along the electrically conductive path but lower the optical transmittance. It is well recognized that if the NWs are regularly aligned, almost all of the NWs could contribute to conductivity along the electrical flow direction. Recently, the influence of nanowire orientation on conductivity of the networks has been addressed by several research groups.21–24 It is reported that conductivity along the direction of alignment can be significantly improved by restricting the nanowire orientation, providing a new way to improve the performance of nanowire networks for the electrical applications where current only need to flow in one direction. For example, it is well known that high conductivity of the TCEs in a specific direction, such as along the cell length of a module device, is crucial for the organic/inorganic solar cells, especially in a large area.25,26 Therefore, the assembly of metal nanowires may serve as an effective way to improve the device performance of large-area solar cells.
So far, various techniques, including Langmuir–Blodgett assembly,27 the blown-bubble film technique,28 electric field directed assembly,29 contact printing,30 electrospinning,31 and flow-assisted alignment,32 have been developed for the assembly of semiconducting and metal nanowires. Unfortunately, most of these techniques suffer from some limitations such as surface modification of nanomaterials, additional transfer steps to target substrates, pre-grown vertical nanowire arrays, and surface pre-patterning. Therefore, the controlled and scalable assembly of nanowires directly on various rigid and flexible substrates via facile and rapid methods remains an urgent challenge.
In this work, a novel strategy, called the “capillary-assisted fluidic assembly” (CFA) technique, is developed for aligning the nanowires. Through a one-step solution process, numerous individual nanowires are well aligned over a large area with controlled density. Using this technique, aligned AgNW networks with remarkably improved performance in terms of optical transmittance and sheet resistance are prepared and used as TCEs for large-area polymer solar cells (PSCs). The performances of devices with aligned AgNW electrodes are comparable to that with ITO but much higher than that with random AgNW electrodes. In addition, an exceptional high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.01%, which is the highest value for PSCs using AgNW electrodes with the size of 1.0 cm2, is achieved. More excitingly, this technique is further verified to be applicable for flexible substrates. The resulting flexible TCEs show excellent mechanical stability, and the device based on this electrode preserves 89% of the initial PCE even after 200 bending cycles during the compressive bending test, which is dramatically better than that based on the brittle ITO electrode.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Preparation of large-area AgNW networks
A schematic diagram of the CFA technique used to fabricate the aligned AgNW network is given in Fig. 1. The AgNW solution is injected into the capillaries by a capillary phenomenon from one side and flows out from the other side. The capillary array composed of 25 tubes are kept parallel to the surface of the substrate and printed under constant speed. After solvent evaporation, the deposited AgNWs form a uniform film (width ≈ 13 mm). The width of the film will continue to grow by increasing the number of capillary tubes.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the capillary-assisted fluidic assembly technique. 
The overall process can be divided into two stages: (i) the assembly of AgNWs in the capillary and (ii) the deposition of aligned AgNWs onto the target substrates. In the first stage, the solution of random AgNWs flows into the capillaries and then the NWs become aligned parallel to the flow direction gradually while passing through the capillary.33,34 The self-assembly process inside the capillary should be induced by the hydrodynamic force, the van der Waals force and the interactions between the sidewall of the capillary and the side chain of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coating on AgNWs. Then, in the second stage, the aligned AgNWs are printed onto the target substrate. The alignment is believed to be preserved by the shear force derived from the flow gradient along the printing direction as well as the capillary forces induced from the evaporating air–liquid–solid menisci formed around the AgNWs.18,22,35,36
The first important factor for the CFA technique is the inner diameter of the capillary, which is expected to determine the self-assembly process of the NWs in the first stage. Consequently, several commercial capillaries with different inner diameters (80 μm, 100 μm, 300 μm and 900 μm) were taken in the printing experiment. For the capillaries with inner diameters of 80 μm and 100 μm, the AgNW solution (average length 28 μm and 150 μm) was unable to flow into the capillary or the NWs were easy to be blocked at the beginning part of the capillary. For 900 μm, the solution had no difficulty to flow through but resulting in disordered AgNW networks. The capillary with an inner diameter of 300 μm was found to be suitable for the solution to flow through and highly aligned AgNWs could be acquired (Fig. 2a). The outer diameter of the 300 μm capillary was tested to be ca. 100 μm (Fig. S1, ESI†), then the distance between the adjacent holes was about 200 μm. In the printing process, the AgNW solution could spread on the region of the substrate between the adjacent holes to form a continuous film, and the resulting film thickness was homogeneous.
 Fig. 2  Optical microscopy images of AgNW networks prepared by (a) the CFA technique and (b) the spray-coating technique (scale bar, 25 μm). The mean length of the nanowires is 150 μm. The insets are SEM images of the networks (scale bar, 2 μm). 
In particular, the printing speed, which affected the shear force, was crucial for the alignment process of the NWs in the second stage. As known, higher speed produced larger shear force to preserve the alignment achieved in the first stage and hence led to a higher alignment degree; however, too high printing speed may result in non-uniform deposition of the NW solution. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), when the printing speed increased from 1 mm s−1 to 10 mm s−1, the degree of NW alignment was increased. Nevertheless, when the printing speed further increased up to 20 mm s−1, it was difficult to obtain a uniform film. Thus, in the following experiment, the optimum parameters (300 μm and 10 mm s−1) of the CFA technique were used to prepare aligned AgNW networks.
Furthermore, the concentration of the NW solution was revealed to have little effect on the alignment degree of the NWs, but was important to the NW density of the network. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), highly aligned AgNWs could be realized as the concentration varied from 5 mg ml−1 to 15 mg ml−1. However, the printed film became uneven due to the high viscosity and poor spreadability of the AgNW solution with a concentration larger than 20 mg ml−1. When the mean length of the AgNW changed from 150 μm to 28 μm, similar results were observed (Fig. S3, ESI†). With different concentrations of the AgNW solution between 5 mg ml−1 and 15 mg ml−1, well-aligned NWs were obtained under the printing speed of 10 mm s−1, whereas the degree of the alignment decreased when the printing speed was reduced to 1 mm s−1.
For comparison, the random AgNW networks were prepared by a scalable coating technique – spray coating,37 and the corresponding optical microscopy (OM) image of the AgNW network are shown in Fig. 2b. It was quite obvious that the NWs in the network were disordered, which was significantly different from the aligned NWs. On a higher microscale, the arrangement of the AgNWs was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (insets of Fig. 2) and the results were consistent with the above discussions. For the aligned AgNWs prepared by the CFA technique, almost all of the NWs were well aligned along the printing direction with few deviations, in sharp contrast with randomly oriented AgNWs formed by the spray-coating technique.
2.2. Characteristics of the AgNW networks
For the periodic nanostructures, the optical transmission efficiency is highly related to the angle (θ) of aligned NWs and the incident light polarization. Thus, the optical property was investigated through the polarization of transmission spectra. As shown in Fig. 3, the shapes of the curves with different angles (θ = 0°, parallel; θ = 90°, perpendicular) had no obvious discernable difference. However, the transmittance was 10% larger when the incident light was polarized vertical to the alignment direction, indicating that the NWs were oriented by this technique.38 This result was consistent with the morphological observations using OM and SEM.

It is well known that the optical and electrical properties are crucial for the AgNW networks as TCEs in practical applications. Thus, the sheet resistance (Rs) and the optical transmittance of the networks were measured, and the average values of Rs and transmittance at 550 nm wavelength (T@550nm) of the aligned and random AgNW networks are given in Fig. 4 and Table 1. In addition, the transmission spectra of these AgNW networks are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). To make the discussion easier to follow, two symbols ∥ and ⊥ were defined as the parallel and vertical directions to the aligned AgNW networks, respectively. Because the film was isotropic in the case of random AgNW networks, the ∥ symbol represented the arbitrary direction of the film plane, while ⊥ represented the vertical direction relative to it.

Firstly, we observed the asymmetric conductivity for the aligned AgNWs. As shown in Table 1, for the AgNW networks composed of 150 μm wires, which showed transmittance values of 95.8% and 92.7%, the Rs showed a variation of 2.8 times as the measured direction changed from parallel to vertical (119.9 Ω sq−1 to 331.2 Ω sq−1, and 16.6 Ω sq−1 to 44.8 Ω sq−1). Similarly, for the AgNW networks composed of 28 μm wires, Rs⊥ values were found to be 2.4 to 3.2 times larger than Rs∥ values (85.5%, 8.8 Ω sq−1 to 21.4 Ω sq−1, and 67.5%, 3.9 Ω sq−1 to 12.4 Ω sq−1). However, for the networks of randomly oriented AgNWs, the Rs values along the orthogonal directions were almost the same. For the 150 μm AgNW based networks with different T@550nm from 79.4% to 94.7%, Rs∥ increased from 39.4 Ω sq−1 to 442.7 Ω sq−1 and Rs⊥ increased from 40.7 Ω sq−1 to 473.2 Ω sq−1, showing a constant Rs∥ to Rs⊥ ratio of ca. 1:1. Similarly, the ratio of Rs∥ to Rs⊥ was found to be ca. 1:1 (9.3 Ω sq−1:8.9 Ω sq−1, 13.0 Ω sq−1:13.6 Ω sq−1, 34.5 Ω sq−1:34.5 Ω sq−1 and 48.9 Ω sq−1:47.5 Ω sq−1) for the 28 μm AgNW based networks as the transmittances varied from 72.3% to 84.7%. As was known, the sheet resistance of the nanowire networks mainly originates from the wire to wire junction resistance. With alignment, the number of insufficient junctions along the printing direction of the film was reduced, resulting in a decreased Rs∥ value. Therefore, due to the high conductivity of AgNWs along their length, these results supported the alignment of AgNWs by the CFA technique.
More importantly, the aligned AgNW networks exhibited improved optical and electrical performance in comparison with the random AgNW networks, i.e., the former showed a higher transmittance at similar Rs∥ or a lower Rs∥ at similar transmittance. For the aligned AgNW networks composed of 150 μm wires, the Rs∥ values were 16.6 Ω sq−1 and 119.9 Ω sq−1 at the transmittance of 92.7% and 95.8%, respectively. In contrast, the Rs∥ of the random AgNW networks increased to 158.5 Ω sq−1 and 442.7 Ω sq−1 at similar transmittance values of 92.1% and 94.5%, respectively. In addition, when the Rs∥ decreased to 39.4 Ω sq−1, the transmittance of the random AgNW networks decreased sharply to 79.4%. Similarly, the 28 μm aligned AgNW networks with the transmittance values of 67.5% and 85.5% showed the Rs∥ values of 3.9 Ω sq−1 and 8.8 Ω sq−1, whereas the Rs∥ of the random AgNW networks with similar transmittance values of 72.3% and 84.7% increased to 9.3 Ω sq−1 and 48.9 Ω sq−1, respectively. Therefore, the networks with superior Rs to T@550nm performance (16.6 Ω sq−1, 92.7%) were acquired by restricting the nanowire orientation, suggesting the efficacy of the CFA technique in the performance improvement of the AgNW networks.
In addition to the optical and electrical properties, mechanical stability, which was one of the most important criteria for the AgNW networks, was tested and the results are given in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Specifically, the aligned AgNW networks were bent perpendicular to the alignment direction in the test. The resistance of the aligned AgNW networks slightly increased (13.5 Ω sq−1 to 17.6 Ω sq−1) after 200 bending cycles with a bending radius of 7 mm during compressive bending. In resistance only after a few bending cycles with much visible contrast, the ITO film exhibited a remarkable variation in the cracks formed. The outstanding mechanical stability of aligned AgNW networks by the CFA technique made it appropriate for flexible TCEs.
2.3. Application to large-area flexible PSCs
In order to further evaluate the performance enhancement of the aligned AgNW networks, and investigate the compatibility of the CFA technique in large-area optoelectronic devices, the PSCs with an active area of 1.0 cm2 were fabricated with the device architecture of glass/AgNWs/ZnO/photoactive layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 5a). Poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-(carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th)39 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were used as materials of the photoactive layer, and the energy band diagram including all the layers of the device is presented in Fig. 5b. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices based on ITO, random AgNW (89.1%, 65.3 Ω sq−1, 150 μm and 84.7%, 48.9 Ω sq−1, 28 μm), and aligned AgNW (92.7%, 16.6 Ω sq−1, 150 μm and 85.5%, 8.8 Ω sq−1, 28 μm) electrodes are shown in Fig. 5c and d, and the corresponding photovoltaic performances are listed in Table 2.

With the TCEs based on 150 μm AgNWs, the device using an aligned AgNW electrode exhibited a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.74 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.78 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 60.52%, resulting in a PCE of 6.01%, which was higher than that of the random AgNW based device showing a Jsc of 12.16 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.78 V, a FF of 54.14%, and a PCE of 5.14%. The alignment of the NWs by the CFA technique resulted in a higher Jsc and FF, and thus a higher PCE (increased by ca. 17%) owing to the enhanced optical transmittance and the decreased Rs.40,41 Similarly, an enhanced Jsc of 11.86 mA cm−2 and a FF of 51.63% were also observed for the device based on 28 μm aligned AgNWs. Meanwhile, the device with a random AgNW electrode showed a decreased Jsc of 11.31 mA cm−2 and a FF of 46.73%.
Furthermore, the performance of the aligned AgNW based devices (PCE = 6.01% and 4.78%) was comparable to that of the ITO (PCE = 6.16% and 5.16%). In order to eliminate the influence of device configuration, spray parameters and film thicknesses of ZnO and photoactive layers for the devices based on 150 μm/28 μm AgNWs and ITO were the same, respectively. Considering the different diameter of AgNWs, the ZnO film thickness was adjusted to achieve optimum device performance. Notably, the PCE of 6.01% was the highest efficiency achieved in such a large area for PSCs with AgNW electrodes (Table S1, ESI†), indicating that the aligned AgNW TCEs were particularly expected to replace ITO in large-area photovoltaic devices.
To verify the potential use of the CFA technique in flexible electronic devices, the aligned AgNW films were applied to flexible PSCs as the anode electrodes. The characteristics of the flexible devices based on aligned AgNW and ITO electrodes are given in Fig. S6 and Table S2 (ESI†). The devices with aligned AgNW electrodes exhibited superior performance (PCE = 4.81%) compared with those using ITO electrodes (PCE = 3.48%), suggesting the great potential of aligned AgNW networks as a replacement for ITO in flexible PSCs.
Moreover, in order to evaluate the mechanical stability of the flexible devices based on aligned AgNWs, Fig. 6 shows the change in the PCE of the flexible devices with ITO and aligned AgNW electrodes as a function of the number of bending cycles at a bending radius of 7 mm. The flexible devices based on the aligned AgNWs retained 89% of the initial PCE over 200 bending cycles, whereas PCE of the ITO based flexible device sharply decreased only after 50 cycles. Based on these results, it was highly expected that the CFA technique could be applied to next-generation flexible photoelectronics.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a novel strategy, which is based on a one-step printing process from solution and named the CFA technique, is developed and demonstrated in this study for aligning the nanowires over a large area with controlled density. Well-aligned AgNW networks with dramatically improved performance in terms of optical transmittance and sheet resistance (Rs = 16.6 Ω sq−1, T@550nm = 92.7%) are achieved by this technique and used as TCEs for large-area flexible PSCs. It is found that the performances of devices based on aligned AgNWs with an active area of 1.0 cm2 are significantly enhanced as compared with that based on random AgNWs. In addition, the aligned AgNW based PSCs display a PCE of 6.01%, which is the highest efficiency reported so far for PSCs using AgNW electrodes in such a large area. Moreover, comparable performances are observed for devices with aligned AgNW and ITO electrodes, whereas the aligned AgNW electrodes exceed ITO in the performance of flexible devices. Finally, the aligned AgNW based devices are demonstrated to be mechanically robust in the compressive bending test, and 89% of the initial power conversion efficiencies can be retained even after 200 bending cycles, showing significant improvement than that based on the brittle ITO films. The CFA technique, which is simple with no additional transfer steps and compatible with roll-to-roll processes, is proved to be a promising way in the continuous fabrication of large-area flexible optoelectronic devices.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Materials
AgNWs were purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd. The length/diameter of the supplied NWs were 20–35 μm/40 nm ± 10 nm and 100–200 μm/50 nm ± 10 nm, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). The NWs were provided as a dispersion in isopropanol and stabilized by PVP coating (20 mg ml−1). Prior to use, the pristine dispersions were diluted to desired concentrations for CFA (1 mg ml−1, 5 mg ml−1, 10 mg ml−1, 15 mg ml−1) and spray coating (0.1 mg ml−1) with isopropanol. Silver paste (Uninwell BQ6778) was purchased from Uninwell International Company. PTB7-Th (Mn = 26 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.0) was prepared according to the previous literature.39 PC71BM, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and chlorobenzene (CB, anhydrous, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Zinc oxide (ZnO) (Nanograde N-10, 2.5 wt%) dispersion in isopropanol was purchased from Nanograde Company.
4.2. Fabrication of AgNW networks
The substrates (including glass and PET) were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water and isopropanol, in sequence, followed by drying with nitrogen gas. The cleaned substrates were then treated by UV-ozone for 30 min. Commercial glass capillary (diameter 80 μm, 100 μm, 300 μm and 900 μm, length 10 cm) arrays were used for the CFA technique. Dozens of glass capillary were arranged side by side with no gap to form the 1 D capillary array (printing speed 1 mm s−1, 10 mm s−1 and 20 mm s−1). The ExactaCoat W4301 spray-coater (purchased from Sono-Tek Corporation) was used for the deposition of random AgNW networks. The AgNW networks were thermal annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in a nitrogen glove box to remove the residual solvent.
4.3. Device fabrication
The organic ink was prepared by dissolving PTB7-Th:PC71BM (1:1.7, w/w) in a mixture of DIO (2 vol%) and CB (98 vol%),42 and the total solid concentration was 4 mg ml−1. The ZnO ink was prepared by diluting it with isopropanol to 0.25 wt%.
The PSCs were prepared on pre-patterned AgNW electrodes deposited on glass (T@550nm = 91%) and PET (T@550nm = 82%), ITO-coated glass (ca. 15 Ω sq−1, T@550nm = 85%), and ITO-coated PET (ca. 36 Ω sq−1, T@550nm = 74%). After UV ozone treatment for 30 min, the ZnO layer was spray deposited onto the substrates and annealed at 150 °C for 5 min in air to remove the residual solvent. For the AgNW networks composed of 150 μm wires, the thickness of the ZnO layer was ca. 100 nm, and a ca. 200 nm ZnO layer was deposited on the AgNW networks composed of 28 μm wires. Because of the high roughness of the under layer, the photoactive layer with a thickness of ca. 160 nm for the glass substrate and ca. 240 nm for the PET substrate was spray-coated onto the ZnO layer from the organic ink in air. Finally, the MoO3/Ag (30 nm/100 nm) layer was thermally evaporated on the top of the photoactive layer. The active area for all devices was defined as 1.0 cm2 (10 mm × 10 mm) by the shadow masks.
4.4. Characterization
Optical microscopy (OM) investigations were carried out using a Carl Zeiss A1m microscope equipped with an Infinity 4-11 digital camera (Lumenera Co.). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 10.0 kV. The specular transmission spectra were acquired by a Lambda 750 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA). The sheet resistances were measured using the two-probe method. For the sheet resistance measurement of the aligned AgNW networks, two contact electrodes were drawn along the direction parallel or perpendicular to the alignment direction by silver paste, separated by a square area of the network (Fig. S8, ESI†), and then the measurement was carried out with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter. The sheet resistance measurements of the random AgNW network, ITO on glass and ITO on PET were obtained using the same procedure. The device performance was measured in the nitrogen glove box with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under an AM 1.5G solar simulator (SAN-EI, XES-70S1 (AAA Class Standard)). The film thickness was measured with a KLATencorD100 stylus profilometer.
