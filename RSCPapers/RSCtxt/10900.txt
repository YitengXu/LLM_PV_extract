    , Accepted 3rd February 2022First published on 4th February 2022AbstractBased on density functional theory and following first-principles methods, this paper investigated the electronic structures, densities of states, effective masses of electrons and holes, and optical properties of CsGeX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) perovskites under triaxial strains of −4% to 4%. The calculated results show that the tuning range of the bandgaps of the CsGeI3, CsGeBr3, and CsGeCl3 perovskites are 1.16 eV, 1.64 eV, and 1.63 eV, respectively. This result shows that the bandgap of the CsGeX3 perovskite is tuned over the entire visible spectrum by applying strain. Also, it is found that the change of the bandgap is caused by the change of the Ge–X long bond. Besides, the optimal bandgaps of CsGeI3 and CsGeBr3 can be achieved by applying compressive strains, providing theoretical support for adjusting the bandgaps of CsGeX3 perovskites. The effective masses of electrons and holes of CsGeX3 perovskites decrease gradually with the strains changing from 4% to −4%, which is conducive to the transmission of electrons and holes. In addition, the optical properties of CsGeX3 perovskites change from redshifted to blueshifted under different strains.
1. Introduction
Inorganic perovskites are ideal candidates for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices because of their excellent photoelectric characteristics.1–7 They have many advantages of simple and repeatable solution/vapor-chemistry treatment and low material cost.8,9 They have already shown outstanding performance in solar cell applications.10–12 However, there are still many challenges, e.g., toxic lead limits the large-scale application of lead-based solar cells. Therefore, the lead-free Ge-based perovskites have attracted much attention13–15 owing to their widespread applications, such as in solar cells,16 LEDs,17 and photodetectors.18 Recently, many novel features of lead-free Ge-based perovskites with high stability have been studied.19 For instance, pressure-induced effects can adjust the bandgap energy in the inorganic halide perovskite CsGeI3.20 CsGeBr3 was converted from normal insulators into topological insulators via tuning the orbital levels.21 Besides, substantial electro-optic responses from Ge-based perovskites have been found.22 The CsGeX3 perovskites have competitively large second-harmonic conversion coefficients and birefringence.23 In addition, it has been predicted that the total power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the CsGeI3 solar cell devices can reach 18.3%, which is influenced by the thickness of electron affinity, temperature, electron transport layer, hole transport layer, defect density, doping concentration, absorber, and series resistance on the optimization of the lead-free device.24 These good experimental and theoretical prediction results showed that Ge-based perovskites are promising materials for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. The bandgap size, orbital information, and electronic contribution can be obtained by calculating electronic properties. The optical absorption and carrier transport can be used to measure the performance of the perovskite in solar cells. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the electronic, carrier transport and optical properties of Ge-based perovskites will help us better understand how to improve the conversion efficiency of Ge-based perovskite solar cells.
As a powerful method, strain engineering has been extensively applied to high strain piezoelectric ceramics,25 photodetector,26 and solar cells.27 It can improve the stability of the perovskite thin films and the PCE of the solar cells.7,28 In experiments, applying strain to halide perovskites has been frequently attempted, including using hydrostatic pressurization,29–31 electrostriction,32 annealing,7,33,34 van der Waals force,35 thermal expansion mismatch,36 heat-induced substrate phase transition,37 and so on. Strain provides a new approach to eliminate the losses and manage defects in halide perovskites.38 In particular, the bandgap energies of perovskites can be adjusted by using strain.39 For example, a suitable bandgap (1.36 eV) of CH3NH3GeI3 can be achieved under a strain of −3%.40 The effects of hydrostatic pressure on the absorption edge of CsGeBr3 and CsGeCl3 were studied, and it is found that the distortion caused a very large redshift in the absorption edge.41 At present, the tensile strain of CsGeX3 perovskites is less studied in the literature.
In this study, the band structures, density of states, and effective masses of the electrons and holes, as well as the optical properties of CsGeX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) perovskites under compressive strain and tensile strain were calculated based on density functional theory (DFT). Firstly, the relationship between the structural properties of the CsGeX3 perovskites and the strain was discussed. Then, the change in the effective masses of electrons and holes under the strains was investigated. Finally, the optical properties under the compressive strain and tensile strain were calculated, including the absorption coefficients and reflectivity. The theoretical calculation results obtained in this study provide a guideline for tuning the bandgap and improving the optical absorbance of the CsGeX3 perovskites under strain.
2. Computational details
In this work, the plane wave pseudo potential method based on DFT was used. The optimized CsGeX3 perovskites were obtained by using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP).42 In VASP, the projected augmented wave (PAW) potential was used to describe the electron and ion interactions.43 Meanwhile, the electron exchange correction function was described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).44 The cut-off energy of the plane wave basis was set to 500 eV. Besides, the Monkhorst–Pack scheme was adopted to sample in the Brillouin zone,45 and the meshes of 4 × 4 × 4 k-points were set to obtain the optimized structure. The convergence threshold of energy was set to 1 × 10−6 eV, and the convergence standard of force was 0.01 eV Å−1. Since DFT–PBE calculation significantly understates the bandgap compared with the experimentally measured bandgap,46 the HSE06 hybrid functional was exploited to accurately calculate the bandgap, and the exact exchange accounts for 25% of the Hartree–Fock/DFT hybrid functional type calculations. For the calculations of the densities of states (DOSs), the Gaussian broadening was set to 0.2 eV. Moreover, the dense K grids (8 × 8 × 8) on the Brillouin zone can be used to accurately calculate the optical properties. The spin–orbital interaction of the Ge atom is weaker than that of the heavy atom lead, so it is ignored in the calculation.47 The unit cell of the CsGeX3 perovskites has been used in this work, including one Cs atom, one Ge atom, and three halogen (I, Br, or Cl) atoms.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure
At room temperature, the crystal structure of CsGeX3 perovskites belongs to a triangular crystal system, and the space group is Rm (No. 163).23 In general, the ABX3 halide perovskites have a stable structure when the tolerance factor ranges from 0.8 to 1. The calculation of tolerance factor T is as follows:48 (1)where the ionic radii of Cs, Ge, Cl, Br, and I atoms are 1.67 Å, 0.73 Å, 1.81 Å, 1.96 Å, and 2.20 Å, respectively.49,50 The tolerance factors of CsGeX3 were calculated using eqn (1) as 0.97 (CsGeCl3), 0.95 (CsGeBr3), and 0.93 (CsGeI3), indicating that the CsGeX3 perovskites have a stable structure at room temperature. There are slight changes in the optimized crystal structure of the CsGeX3 perovskites, but this structure still belongs to the Rm space group.
The strain-free crystal structure of CsGeX3 perovskites is drawn by VESTA51 and shown in Fig. 1. The calculated lattice constant and cell volume is shown in Table S1 in the ESI,† which are highly consistent with those of previous reports. Compared to the framework of Pb-based halide perovskites, the GeX−3 frame is asymmetric, which is caused by the distorted framework of GeX−3 along the z-axis.52 The Ge atom size is smaller than that of the Pb atom. The larger size mismatch between the Ge2+ ion and X (X = I, Br, or Cl) ion makes the structure of CsGeX3 perovskites different with Pb-based perovskites. The geometry of CsGeX3 is a twisted octahedron with Cs+ at the vertex. The Ge2+ is surrounded by six halogen anions distributed in the face centre to balance the octahedral structure. Since both Pb-based and Sn-based perovskites belong to the Pmm space group, Pb2+ and Sn2+ are located in the centre of the octahedron, which exhibits weak polarization because of the symmetry of halogen ions. However, Ge2+ deviates from the central position in CsGeX3 perovskites, and the deviation results in a strong polarization of the highly distorted octahedral GeX−3. Along the z-axis, Ge2+ forms short covalent bonds with the near halogen ion and long covalent bonds with the far halogen ion. The length of the Ge–I, Ge–Br, and Ge–Cl bonds gradually decreases with the strain-free situation, which is mainly determined by the size of the halogen atom itself.
 Fig. 1  Crystal structure of CsGeX3 perovskites. 
The relation between the lattice constant and the triaxial strain is A = A0 (1 + s), B = B0 (1 + s), and C = C0 (1 + s), where A0, B0, and C0 are the lattice constants of the strain-free case, and s is the strain.39 The triaxial strain can be achieved experimentally by hydrostatic strains.53 The value of s in this work ranges from −4% to 4%, indicating compressive strain and tensile strain. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a–c) that, as the strain changes from −4% to 4%, the variation range of the short bond length is 0.04–0.1 Å, while that of the long bond length is 0.56–0.66 Å. The long bond changes obviously when the strain is applied, and this result is consistent with the theoretical calculation result of organic–inorganic perovskites CH3NH3GeX3.18 As shown in Fig. 2(d), the primitive cell volume of CsGeX3 perovskites increases linearly with s. The changes of primitive cell volume of CsGeI3, CsGeBr3, and CsGeCl3 perovskites are 56 Å3, 46 Å3, and 41 Å3, respectively.

3.2. Electronic properties
According to the semiconductor theory, the bandgap energy is a significant parameter for photoelectric and photovoltaic applications. Further efficiency boost of Ge-based perovskite solar cells is hampered by their wider bandgap than the optimum value according to the Shockley–Queisser limit. For the first time, the bandgap of single-junction solar cells in HC(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite was shrunk from 1.489 to 1.337 eV by modulating the valence electron wavefunction with a modest hydraulic pressure of up to 2.1 GPa.30 After that, bandgap engineering has attracted extensive attention. In this section, we calculated the bandgaps of CsGeX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) under different strains to obtain the optimized bandgap for solar cells in Ge-based perovskites. To obtain an accurate bandgap energy, the band structure of CsGeX3 perovskites was calculated by using the HSE06 hybrid functional. The calculated bandgap energies of CsGeI3, CsGeBr3, and CsGeCl3 without strain are 1.6 eV, 2.13 eV, and 2.99 eV, respectively. Some previous reported theoretical and experimental results of optical bandgaps for perovskites CsGeX3 (X = I, Br, or Cl) are listed in Table S2 in the ESI.† It can be seen that our calculation results are closer to the experimental values than those of other calculation methods. According to the semiconductor theory, the band structures near the Fermi level are important to understand the physical properties of materials. Therefore, the band structures of CsGeX3 perovskites near the Fermi level are illustrated in Fig. 3(a–c). The high symmetry points of the wave vector space in CsGeX3 perovskites are Γ (0, 0, 0), X (0.5, 0, 0), M (0.5, 0.5, 0), and R (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). Both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) of CsGeX3 perovskites are at the R point. Therefore, all CsGeX3 perovskites studied in this work have direct bandgaps and similar band structures.

Although the CsGeX3 perovskites have a similar band structure, the changes of bandgap under strain are obvious. The calculated bandgaps of CsGeX3 perovskites under strains from −4% to 4% are shown in Fig. 3(d). It can be seen that the bandgap energy of CsGeX3 perovskites gradually decreases under compressive strain, while the bandgap energy gradually increases when tensile strain is applied. When the strain changes from −4% to 4%, the tunable ranges of bandgap energy of CsGeI3, CsGeBr3, and CsGeCl3 perovskites are, respectively, 1.16 eV, 1.64 eV, and 1.63 eV, indicating that the bandgap can be adjusted effectively by strain. Tabulated bandgaps as a function of strain of CsGeX3 perovskites are shown in ESI† Table S3. According to the Shockley–Queisser theory, the bandgap energy in the range of 1.3–1.5 eV is an ideal optical absorption edge, which can improve the photoelectric performance of perovskites and enhance the conversion efficiency of solar cells.47 The calculated results show that the optimal bandgap energy (1.3–1.5 eV) of CsGeI3 and CsGeBr3 perovskites can be achieved by applying the corresponding compressive strain. In addition to changing the bandgap, the strain is also effective to improve the power conversion efficiency of CsGeI3 and CsGeBr3 perovskites.
The density of states and the density of parts of states provide us important information, such as the Fermi levels, the positions of the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band, and the orbital contributions of individual atoms. The total densities of states (TDOSs) and partial densities of states (PDOSs) without strain for the CsGeI3, CsGeBr3, and CsGeCl3 perovskites are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the VBMs of CsGeI3, CsGeBr3, and CsGeCl3 are dominated by 5p–I, 4p–Br, 3p–Cl, and 4s–Ge states, and the CBMs are dominated by the 4s–Ge state. Because of the similar structures and chemical compositions, the TDOSs and PDOSs of CsGeI3 (left), CsGeBr3 (middle), and CsGeCl3 (right) have similar shapes. The Cs atom hardly works in the shallow level near the bandgap, and its p electron orbit contributes a lot to the deep level of the valence band. The contribution of the Cs atom provides electrons to GeX−3 and forms the perovskite structure rather than determines the basic electronic structure of GeX−3. Besides, the TDOSs and PDOSs under different strains are shown in Fig. 1 in the ESI.† The valence bands move to a deep level as the strains change from tensile strain to compressive strain, while the EF remains at 0. The conduction bands gradually approach the EF under compressive strain and leave the EF under tensile strain, resulting in the change of the bandgap.

3.3. Carrier transport properties
The small effective mass (m*) of the electron (hole) is beneficial to the electron (hole) transition. In order to clarify the transportation capacity of the electrons (holes), the carrier transport properties have been investigated. The study of the electron (hole) distribution in the conduction (valence) band of CsGeX3 has much significance because it helps to reveal the power conversion mechanism of CsGeX3 perovskite solar cells. The effective mass of the electron (hole) around the bottom of the conduction band (top of the valence band) can be approximated by the following equation:54 (2)where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, k is the wave vector along with different directions, and ε(k) is the energy dispersion relation function. Generally, the larger the dispersion at the bottom of the conduction band (the top of the valence band), the smaller the effective mass of electrons (holes), and the more conducive to the diffusion of electrons (holes).55 The calculation formula for the exciton binding energy in the weak Mott–Wannier model is as follows:49 (3)where εs is the static dielectric function. Our calculated εs values of CsGeX3 are 4.83, 3.88, and 3.24 by using the HSE06 method, consistent with the previous reports.46,49,56,57 Meanwhile, the εs values of CsGeI3, CsGeBr3 and CsGeCl3 decrease gradually, and this trend is consistent with the results calculated by Huang etc.23 The reduced effective mass μ is given by the following equation: (4)me and mh are the effective masses of electrons and holes that are obtained by fitting the VBM and CBM. We know that the small effective mass of electrons (holes) is favourable for carrier transport. The effective masses of electrons and holes of CsGeI3, CsGeBr3, and CsGeCl3 under different strains along three directions are listed in ESI† Table S4. It is found that CsGeX3 has a smaller effective mass of electrons (holes) in the R → Γ direction than the R → X and R → M directions according to our calculation results. Therefore, we select the effective masses of the electrons (holes) in the R → Γ direction to study their change with the strain. The calculated effective masses of the electrons (holes) are listed in Table 1. The effective masses of the electrons and holes of CsGeX3 perovskites gradually decrease as the strain changes from tensile strain to compressive strain. As mentioned above, the smaller the effective mass of electrons and holes, the more easily the electrons and holes in the absorption layer diffuse to the transport layer, indicating that the compressive strain can be applied to promote carrier migration and improve the PCEs of CsGeX3 perovskite solar cells. In addition, the exciton binding energies of CsGeX3 are obtained by eqn (3). It is easy to find that the variation trend of exciton binding energy is consistent with that of effective mass under the strains of −4% to 4%. The exciton binding energy of CsGeX3 perovskites increases when tensile strain is applied. Therefore, the strain provides an ideal method for investigating exciton absorption, exciton luminescence, and the related mechanisms. Furthermore, the effective masses of electrons and holes of CsGeX3 gradually increase when the halogen I atom changes to a Cl atom, indicating that CsGeI3 has more advantages in carrier migration than CsGeBr3 and CsGeCl3. Previous studies have shown that inhomogeneity in polycrystalline films due to composition separation leads to local lattice mismatches and emergent residual strains consequently. By reducing the strain gradient of the perovskite film through strain engineering, Chen et al. achieved substantial improvement in hole carrier transport and extraction across the perovskite absorber/HTM interface.34 By calculating the effective masses of electrons and holes of CsGeX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) perovskites, the carrier migration characteristics under different strains can be obtained, which provide guidance for the elimination of residual strain in CsGeX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) perovskites.

3.4. Optical properties
Excellent optical properties, including absorption coefficient, reflectivity, and real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, and so on, are beneficial for the performance of the optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Therefore, it is particularly important to study the optical properties of CsGeX3 perovskites because of the potential applications. The calculated optical properties and variation tendencies under different strains provide a certain theoretical guidance for the experimental study in strain engineering. According to the Shockley–Queisser theory, a large optical absorption coefficient can enhance the conversion efficiency of solar cells. The optical properties of perovskites are usually calculated by the complex dielectric function, i.e., ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω), where ω is the frequency of incident light, ε1(ω) is the real part, and ε2(ω) is the imaginary part of the complex dielectric function. In general, ε2(ω) is used to describe the light absorption behaviour, and it can be calculated by the following equation:58  where V represents unit volume; e is electron charge; p represents the momentum transition matrix; kn and kn′ are the wave functions of the conduction band and valence band, respectively. Based on ε2(ω), ε1(ω) can be obtained through the Kramers–Kronig relationship:49 (6)where P is the principal value of the integral. The absorption coefficient can be obtained by calculating the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function as follows:59 (7)
To accurately calculate the optical properties of CsGeX3 perovskites, the HSE06 hybrid functional is exploited and the k-point meshes on the Brillouin zone are set to 8 × 8 × 8. Fig. 5(a, c and e) show the changes in the real part of the dielectric function when s = −4%, −2%, 0, 2%, and 4%. Generally, the real part of the dielectric function is used to describe the propagation behaviour of light in media. The calculations of optical properties by using the HSE06 method are nearly consistent with the previous reports,13,22,55,60 and the minor difference is caused by the calculation methods. According to Fig. 5(a, c and e), ε1 increases and then decreases after it reaches a series of peaks with the increase of energy. The compressive strains make the peak move to the low energy region, and the peak value increases. In comparison, the tensile strains make the peak move to the high energy region, and the peak value decreases. The imaginary part of the dielectric function is closely related to the band structure of the material, which explains the absorption characteristics of CsGeX3 perovskites. As shown in Fig. 5(b, d and f), due to the compressive strain and tensile strain, the imaginary part of the dielectric function of CsGeX3 shifts to the low-energy region and the high-energy region, respectively. These results are consistent with the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 6(a, c and e).

The optical absorption coefficient is an important indicator to measure the light energy absorbed by perovskites. A large optical absorption coefficient is desired for practical applications, such as solar cells. The optical absorption coefficients of CsGeX3 perovskites are calculated under different strains, and the calculation results are shown in Fig. 6. According to Fig. 6(a, c and e), the CsGeX3 perovskites have large optical absorption coefficients in the visible range, with an order of 105. The compressive strains can not only make the light absorption redshift but enhance the band edge absorption; in comparison, the tensile strains make the absorption peaks move to the high energy region and the peaks disappear gradually. Reflectivity is another important optical indicator. As shown in Fig. 6(b, d and f), CsGeX3 perovskites have small reflectivity in the visible range, and the reflectivity decreases with the tensile strain. The large absorption coefficients and small reflectivity indicate that the CsGeX3 perovskites are competitive candidate materials for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells, optically pumped lasers, detectors, and light-emitting diodes.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, the structural and optical properties of CsGeX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) perovskites were studied under strains from −4% to 4% by first principles. The calculated results indicated that the bandgap energies of CsGeX3 perovskites can be tuned, and the tuning ranges of CsGeI3, CsGeBr3, and CsGeCl3 are 1.16 eV, 1.64 eV, and 1.63 eV, respectively. By applying compressive strain, the optimal bandgaps (1.3–1.5 eV) of CsGeI3 and CsGeBr3 perovskites can be achieved for solar cells, indicating that the bandgap can be effectively adjusted by strain. The relationships between the bandgaps and the geometric structures of the CsGeX3 perovskites were also investigated, and the investigation reveals that the change of the bandgap is mainly caused by the long Ge–X bond. Besides, the effective masses of electrons and holes of CsGeX3 perovskites gradually decrease when the strain is changed from tensile strain to compressive strain. Small effective mass is more conducive to carrier migration of CsGeX3 perovskites. Moreover, the absorption coefficients and reflectivity of CsGeX3 perovskites were affected by the strains, providing a new idea for the design of photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.
