    , Accepted 19th August 2016First published on 22nd August 2016AbstractWe design and construct a new type of solid-state electrochromic batteries powered by perovskite solar cells for smart windows. In addition to optical modulation, this integrated system can exhibit multifunctionality of solar energy harvesting, electrochemical energy storage and reutilization. The solid-state electrochromic batteries are composed of a reduced graphene (rGO)-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake array cathode and a WO3 nanowire array anode. The charge storage and release are accompanied by color changes (between transparent and blue) and relatively fast (2.5–2.6 s) and large optical modulation (up to 62% at the infrared range, 1000–2000 nm). The electrochromic batteries can act as a power source and exhibit a capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good cycling life.

Conceptual insights
There is a wide interest in integrating different energy devices in tandem to realize self-powered systems and multifuctionalities. For modern green buildings, the electricity generation by photovoltaic systems, optical/thermal modulation by electrochromic smart windows, and corresponding electricity storage and reutilization are mostly separated. Combining them together in multifunctional cladding is a very interesting means to minimize the additional components necessary to add to the building. Conventional electrochromic windows based on thin-film oxides are powered by external batteries and do not electrochemically store the input charges. Herein, we combine cheap printable perovskite solar cells with a newly-designed electrochromic device and demonstrate solar energy harvest and energy storage as well as electrochromics. This new type of integrated smart windows with a large optical modulation particularly in the infrared wavelength region may be useful in future green buildings.

Introduction
Over the past decades, the innovation of solar cell materials and the progress of energy storage technologies greatly advance the field of device combination between solar cells and electrochemical energy storage devices (e.g., batteries and supercapacitors).1,2 Currently, one type is integrated device combination, and the other is discontinuous. In the former configuration, both solar cells and batteries/supercapacitors are physically connected to each other without external wires, and are fabricated in one chip or framework.3 For the latter, the two devices are usually physically far from each other.4 For example, electricity generated from solar cells on the ground may be stored by batteries/supercapacitors buried underground. While both combinations can realize high-efficiency energy cycling, the first kind is much more challenging and needs a more sophisticated fabrication of both the active materials and the device.
In the past decades, smart windows based on electrochromic glass have attracted great attention due to their large optical modulation, high coloration efficiency, low energy consumption, and good memory effect.5,6 Smart windows that are capable of modulating the transmission of light and heat are of great significance to modern buildings (e.g., skyscrapers and commercial office buildings). In conventional smart windows, electrochromic glass is powered by external batteries,7–10 and there is nearly no attention given to the reutilization of the energy stored in the smart windows. Recently, it was found that solar cells and electrochromic glass can be organically combined in one smart window, in which, for example, the solar cell acts as the window frame around the electrochromic glass. In such a configuration, the solar-cell window frame harvests electricity from the sunlight and powers the electrochromic glass. Importantly, the process of color change (optical modulation) in the electrochromic glass is accompanied by energy storage related to electrochemical redox reactions. With a smart choice of suitable material and circuit design, the electrochromic glass is also an electrochromic battery, where the energy stored in it can be released to drive other devices (such as LED lights).2 In conclusion, multi-functionality including solar energy harvesting, storage and reutilization can be realized in such integrated smart windows based on a scrupulous combination of electrochromic glass and solar cells.
Over recent years, perovskite solar cells based on methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbX3, X = I, Cl or Br) have stirred up a new revolution due to their high efficiency (up to 15–21%), low cost and facile fabrication techniques.11–13 Fully printable perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 hetero-junctions and cheap carbon counter electrodes have been developed.14–16 This type of cheap and printable perovskite solar cell is particularly suitable to combine with electrochromic glass in smart windows.
Electrochromic batteries are one of the core parts in smart windows. Liquid electrochromic batteries are not suitable for commercial application due to leakage problems.17,18 Therefore, currently solid-state electrochromic batteries are the focus of the research. Among the wide range of electrochromic active materials (such as transition metal oxides,19–22 conducting polymers,10,23 prussian blue,24 and viologen25), WO3 and NiO are the most popular active ones for solid-state electrochromic batteries because they can match each other well as the anode and cathode, respectively.19,26,27 In addition, the coupling of WO3/NiO can show a high voltage of ∼2 V,9,28 which is favorable for driving other devices. Also, this coupling exhibits a large vis-infrared (IR) optical modulation and high color efficiency. It is well accepted that the electrochromic process is an electrochemical redox one associated with electron/ion transfer.29 Therefore, strategies for enhancing the reaction kinetics are highly desirable to improve the transportation of the electron/ion in WO3 and NiO. Nanostructures (e.g. nanoflakes and nanowires)30,31 and composites with conductive additives (e.g. polymers and graphene)23,32–34 are demonstrated as effective in enhancing the electrochromic performance of WO3 and NiO active layers. Nevertheless, there is still a large area for improvement in kinetics when one wants to reutilize stored energy by discharging the electrochromic batteries.
Herein, as a proof of concept, we explore the device combination between new nanostructured electrochromic batteries and perovskite solar cells to demonstrate the feasibility for solar energy harvesting, secondary energy storage and reutilization in one module (see Fig. 1). The perovskite solar cells generate electricity from sunlight and act as a power source to drive the electrochromic glass, which exhibits color changes and optical modulation (especially in the IR wavelength range) accompanied by energy storage/release. The stored energy in the electrochromic glass will then function as a battery to power other devices such as LED lights. We constructed solid-state electrochromic batteries by employing optimized electrodes based on a WO3 nanowire array anode and an rGO-connected multilayer NiO nanoflake array cathode. This is the first clear demonstration of such a combination of various energy processes and multifunctionalities in smart windows. A better performance can be expected by further optimizing the solar cell efficiencies on a practically larger scale.

Experimental
Fabrication of WO3 nanowire arrays
The WO3 nanowire arrays were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. Clean FTO glasses (sheet resistance of ∼10 Ω) were used as the substrates. First, a WO3 seed layer of 5 nm was coated on the FTO glass by spin coating described in the previous work.19 The hydrothermal solution was first prepared by dissolving 10 mmol of Na2WO4 into 80 mL of DI water. Then the pH value of the hydrothermal solution was adjusted to 2 by adding a 3 M HCl solution. After that, 25 mmol of (NH4)2SO4 was added into the above hydrothermal solution to form the final reaction solution. Then the reaction solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The FTO glass with the WO3 seed layer was placed vertically in the autoclave, and maintained at 180 °C for 4 h. Finally, the samples were rinsed with DI water and dried in a vacuum oven. The mass of the as-grown WO3 nanowires on the FTO substrate was about 0.2 mg cm−2.
Fabrication of rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays
The rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays were fabricated by successive combined chemical bath deposition (CBD) and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) methods. The NiO nanoflake arrays were first prepared by the CBD method, then uniformly coated by a rGO film, followed by another growth of the CBD-NiO nanoflake arrays. The whole structure was like a sandwich. First, the clean FTO glasses (the back side was protected by masking polyimide tape from contamination) were positioned vertically in a 250 mL beaker. The first CBD solution was composed of 5 g of nickel sulfate and 1 g of potassium persulfate in 100 mL of DI water. Then, 5 mL of aqueous ammonia (25–28%) was added into the above solution. After immersing the FTO glass into the CBD solution for 15 min at 25 °C, the samples were taken out and rinsed with DI water, and followed by annealing at 300 °C for 1.5 h in argon.
The EPD-rGO film was coated on the surface of the above NiO nanoflakes as follows. First, GO was synthesized according to a modified Hummers method. The EP electrolyte consisted of 15 mg of GO powder in 150 mL of isopropyl alcohol to form stable GO colloids after adding Mg(NO3)2. The EPD was carried out at room temperature in a two-electrode system at 50 V for 30 s. After that, the samples were placed in a petri dish containing 1 mL of hydrazine monohydrate and sealed with tape, and kept at 50 °C for 12 h to form the NiO + rGO composite film. Finally, we used another round of CBD at the same parameters as above to deposit the NiO nanoflakes on the NiO + rGO composite film to form rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays with a mass of about 0.3 mg cm−2.
Fabrication of solid-state electrochromic batteries
The solid-state electrochromic batteries were assembled based on the self-supported WO3 nanowire arrays as the anode, the rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays as the cathode, and a LiClO4–polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polyelectrolyte. The solid-state electrochromic batteries were fabricated as follows. First, we placed a hollow square Surlyn 1702 sealing film on the FTO substrates with the WO3 nanowire array anode. Then, a polyelectrolyte of LiClO4–PVA gel was prepared by adding 1 g of LiClO4 and 1 g of PVA into 10 mL of DI water. After stirring for 1 h at 90 °C, the polyelectrolyte formed and was then cast onto the square area of the anode, followed by the covering of the FTO substrates with the rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays. The whole device was clamped and kept at 120 °C for 3 min to complete the fabrication of the solid-state electrochromic batteries.
Fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 hetero-junction based perovskite solar cells
The mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 hetero-junction based perovskite solar cells were fabricated according to our previous work.16 Clean FTO glasses were first etched with a laser to form two detached electrode patterns and then ultrasonically cleaned with ethanol. Then, the patterned FTO substrates were uniformly coated by a spray-pyrolysised compact TiO2 layer of 100 nm. Afterwards, a TiO2 nanocrystalline layer (PASOL HPW-18NR) of 1 mm was coated on the above compact TiO2 layer by screen printing and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. Then, a ZrO2 spacer layer of 1 mm and a mesoscopic carbon layer of 10 mm were successively deposited on the surface of the TiO2 nanocrystalline layer, and annealed at 400 °C for 30 min. After that, 5 mL of the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor (0.123 g of CH3NH3I and 0.3625 g of PbI2 were mixed in 1 mL of γ-butyrolactone) was dipped into the aforementioned films and dried at 50 °C on a hot plate under dark conditions to complete the fabrication of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 hetero-junction based perovskite solar cells.
Characterizations
The structure and morphology of all of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, RIGAKU D/MAX 2550/PC with Cu Kα radiation), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5700), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI SIRION), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2010F), and Raman spectroscopy (WITec-CRM200 Raman system with a laser wavelength of 532 nm). A 150 W Xe lamp (Sciencetech SS 150 Solar Simulator) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter and common desk lamps were both used as the light source.
Electrochemical and electrochromic measurements
A 150 W Xe lamp (Sciencetech SS 150 Solar Simulator) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter and common desk lamps were both used as the light source for our perovskite solar cells. The perovskite solar cells were used as the power source to drive the designed solid-state electrochromic batteries. The transmission spectra of our electrochromic batteries at different states (colored or bleached states) were measured over a wavelength range from 400 to 2100 nm with a SHIMADZU UV-3600 spectrophotometer. The discharge capacities at different current densities were observed with a CHI660E electrochemical workshop. Before the discharge process, the solid-sate electrochromic batteries were charged by the perovskite solar cells to 2 V using a current density of 1 A g−1 (based on the mass of the WO3 nanowires).
The capacity was calculated by using discharge curves according to the following equation: (1)where Cs, I, m, t represent the specific capacity (mA h g−1), discharge current (mA), mass of active materials (g) and discharge time (s), respectively.
Results and discussion
Device configuration and material design/fabrication
The structure of the perovskite solar cells has been discussed in detail in our previous works.14–16 We used a cheap mesoscopic carbon layer as the counter electrode to reduce the fabrication cost and to simplify processing. The power conversion efficiency of our perovskite solar cells is about 12% under the illumination of standard sunlight (see ESI†). In this work, the core discussion is focused on the newly-designed solid-state electrochromic batteries, including their configuration and electrochromic–electrochemical performances when combined with the perovskite solar cells. As is shown in Fig. 1, free-standing WO3 nanowire arrays on the FTO glass are used as the main electrochromic layer (anode/negative electrode), and the rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays on FTO serve as the counter electrode (cathode/positive electrode). One major new function in this work is the electrochromic battery, namely, the energy stored in the electrochromic glass can be used as a battery to power other devices such as LED lights. During the discharge process, the electrochromic batteries will return to being transparent with reversible optical modulation. Meanwhile, the energy storage and release in the electrochromic batteries can even be quantitatively monitored by optical change. Importantly, the optical modulation is particularly obvious in the near IR wavelength region which is practically relevant when adjusting the heat/light flux through the smart windows.
As a key part of this work, the rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays (cathode) and WO3 nanowire arrays (anode) are playing important roles in energy storage/release and color/optical modulation. We will illustrate their structures and morphologies in detail in the following sections. The rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays are prepared by a combined chemical bath deposition (CBD) and electrophoretic deposition method. First, a single layer of NiO nanoflakes with an overall vertical alignment and a film height of ∼250 nm was deposited onto the FTO glass substrate. The NiO nanoflakes have diameters of ∼15 nm and are connected with each other leaving nanopores ranging from 20 to 200 nm. After that, the rGO film was electrophoretically deposited on the top of the initial NiO nanoflake array. As can be clearly seen in the SEM image (Fig. 2a), the rGO film is uniformly coated, and the NiO nanoflakes underneath can be clearly distinguished. Subsequently, the second layer of CBD-NiO nanoflakes with a height of ∼250 nm was deposited above the rGO film, forming the final rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays (Fig. 2b). The morphology of the second layer of CBD-NiO nanoflakes is similar to that of the first layer. The bilayer structure is verified by the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 2b). In our case, the rGO film serves as a mechanical support for the growth of the second NiO nanoflake layer; without the rGO film, the bilayer structure will not be formed. Meanwhile, the rGO film also acts as a conductive path for efficient electron transfer. Additionally, the rGO film is thin enough and will not block the transportation of the ions during electrochemical reactions. TEM characterizations of the rGO sheets and the NiO nanoflakes are provided in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The phase and components of the rGO-covered NiO electrode are verified by XRD and Raman analysis (data are provided in Fig. S2, ESI†).

(c) SEM image of the WO3 nanowire array (fine structure in inset) and (d) TEM image of a bundle of WO3 nanowires (HRTEM image and SEAD are shown in insets). 
For the anode side, the WO3 nanowires were hydrothermally grown on the FTO substrate. As is shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S3a (ESI†), the bottom part of the WO3 nanowires is quasi-perpendicular to the FTO substrate, while their tips are prone to be toppled and interwoven with each other, as seen from the top-view SEM images (insets in Fig. S3a, ESI†). The top-side WO3 nanowires of 30–50 nm are entwined with each other forming a highly porous and mechanically robust net structure. The length of the whole WO3 nanowire array is about 500 nm. TEM results (Fig. 2d and Fig. S3b, ESI†) indicate that the as-prepared WO3 nanowires have a relatively low surface roughness and are single crystalline (SAED pattern of a single WO3 nanowire in Fig. 2d). The measured lattice fringes in the HRTEM image (Fig. 2d) are about 0.63 nm, corresponding to the (110) crystal planes of hexagonal WO3 (JCPDS 85-2459). The phase and components of the hexagonal-phase WO3 are verified by XRD and XPS analysis (data are provided in Fig. S3, ESI†).
Optical and electrochemical performance

Fig. 3a shows the photographs of the FTO substrates coated with the WO3 nanowires and rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflakes. They are assembled and sealed into the solid-state electrochromic battery (photo in Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c presents the designed perovskite solar cell and solid-state electrochromic battery. The performance of our perovskite solar cells has been discussed previously.16 Under the illumination of simulated solar light, a single perovskite solar cell can produce a voltage of ∼0.89 V with a maximum current density of ∼18 mA cm−2 (see data in Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). In our case, obviously, the serial perovskite solar cells can power the connected solid-state electrochromic batteries. Note that the electrochromic battery shows a color change from transparent to blue, indicating that this combination is successful and that electricity is stored in the electrochromic batteries (Fig. 3d). A demonstration of the reutilization of the charges stored in the electrochromic batteries to drive LED lights is provided in Fig. S6 and Videos S1 and S2 (ESI†). Accompanied by the charge release, the electrochromic battery changes back to being optical transparent. This suggests that energy storage and release can be monitored by optical transmission. To explore this further, we measured the optical modulation (ΔT, transmittance separation in bleached and colored states) at the vis-near IR region (400–2000 nm). It is seen that the solid-state electrochromic batteries exhibit a large optical modulation of ∼43% at a visible wavelength of 750 nm and 62% at a near-IR wavelength of 2000 nm. These are higher than those of Ti-doped WO3 films (∼30% at 750 nm, ∼10% at 2000 nm),35 Ni-doped WO3 films (∼28% at 2000 nm),36 WO3/liquid electrolyte/NiO device (∼32% at 750 nm),37 and polyaniline (PANI) based devices (<∼10% at 750 nm),38 and are comparable to V2O5 based electrochromic batteries (∼41% at 750 nm).39 The high optical modulation in the near IR regime is particularly meaningful for heat control through smart windows, as IR light is the major heat source in the solar spectrum. Hence, our WO3/NiO nanowire array based solid-state electrochromic batteries can be useful for energy saving in modern buildings.

(d) Transmittance spectra of the solid-state electrochromic batteries in the visible and near-IR region (400–2000 nm) at bleached and colored states (photos of the electrochromic batteries at different sates in insets). (e) Voltage–time responses of the solid-state electrochromic batteries during the charged (colored) and discharged (bleached) processes. XPS spectra in charged (colored) and discharged (bleached) states: (f) W 4f spectra of the WO3 nanowire arrays and (g) Ni 2p and O1s spectra of the bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays. 
Meanwhile, coloration efficiency (η) is also an important indicator to evaluate the performance of electrochromic batteries. η is defined as the ratio of change of optical density (ΔOD) of the film in its colored (Tc) and bleached (Tb) state at a certain wavelength to the corresponding injected (or ejected) charge density (Q) per unit area.9 (2) (3)η can be calculated from the curved slope of the ΔOD at a wavelength of 750 nm vs. the inserted charge density in the colored state (Fig. S7, ESI†). The designed solid-state electrochromic batteries exhibit an η of about 135.5 cm2 C−1, which is comparable to that of inkjet-printed all solid-state electrochromic devices based on NiO/WO3 nanoparticle complementary electrodes (136.7 cm2 C−1),28 and higher than that based on dense WO3 films (87 cm2 C−1).9
The current–time response of the solid-state electrochromic batteries powered by the perovskite solar cells is measured to check the switching speed of color changes. The measurements were conducted by continuously stepping the voltage between 2.55 V and −2.55 V of the perovskite solar cells (the intensity of incident light is about 100 mW cm−2) on the electrochromic batteries with a 5 s delay at each potential (the switching time is defined as the time to reach 90% of the full response). The voltage of the freshly assembled solid-state electrochromic battery is about 0 V (Fig. 3e). It is found that this conversion process is fast, about 2.5 s for the colored (charged) process and 2.6 s for the bleached (discharged) process (see Video S2 in the ESI†), much better than other solid-state electrochromic devices based on common dense transition metal oxides2,9,28 and prussian blue.40
During the colored/bleached processes, expect for the non-Faradaic process using reversible charge storage by an electric double layer, the WO3 anode reacts with Li+ to form LixWO3, according to the following equation: (4)

Ex situ XPS tests in different states were conducted to confirm the proposed redox reactions. For WO3 nanowires in the bleached state (discharged state) (Fig. 3f), there are spin–orbit doublets in the W 4f spectra, W 4f7/2 (35.7 eV) and W 4f5/2 (37.8 eV) peaks, which match well with the electronic sates of W6+ in WO3. While in the colored (charged) state, new characteristic peaks of W5+ at 34.1 and 36.2 eV are noticed, indicating the conversion from W6+ to W5+ (Fig. 3f).9 Meanwhile, a small peak of W6+ (35.7 eV) remains due to the self-discharge or self-bleaching process. These observations verify the above proposed reactions.
To date, the detailed reactions occurring at the NiO cathode side are still not very clear. Generally, it is believed that in addition to the non-Faradaic surface capacitive effects by the electric double layer, the Faradaic process arising from redox reactions also exists in the NiO cathode. It is speculated that the Li ion may also partly intercalate into NiO. Fig. 3g shows the Ni 2p and O 1s spectra of the rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflake arrays in the bleached (discharged) and colored (charged) states. For the bleached state, a typical peak of 854.2 is seen in the Ni 2p 3/2 spectra, which corresponds to the electronic state of Ni2+ in NiO. The corresponding O1s spectra show peaks at 529.2 eV (Ni–O bond) and 531 eV (Ni–OH bond), suggesting that NiO exists after bleaching (discharge). For the colored (charged) NiO sample, both peaks at 855.3 and 854.2 eV are observed, and accompanied by the evident increase in intensity of the 531 eV peak in the O 1s spectra. The new peak at 855.3 eV is attributed to the appearance of Ni3+, and converts back to Ni2+ in the bleached state.41 This process may be simultaneously accompanied by surface capacitive effects of the Li+ based electric double layer as well as Li+ intercalation.
To investigate the energy storage capability of the solid-sate electrochromic batteries, galvanostatic discharge tests are carried out at different current densities. Before discharge, the electrochromic batteries are fully charged by the perovskite solar cells. The discharge profiles and correspondingly calculated capacities are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The discharge curves do not show obvious plateaus because of the dominating surface capacitive effects at relatively high discharge current densities, leading to quasi-linear discharge curves. In our case, in order to achieve the best performance, the capacity of the WO3 anode is intentionally designed to be lower than that of the NiO cathode, so that the overall performance is controlled by the WO3 anode. Based on the mass of the WO3 nanowires (see Experimental section), the solid-sate electrochromic batteries can deliver a capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, 68 mA h g−1 at 2.5 A g−1, 63 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1, 58 mA h g−1 at 7.5 A g−1, and 52 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1. The good performance especially at high current densities can be ascribed to the porous nanostructured electrodes of both the WO3 nanowire and rGO-connected bilayer NiO nanoflakes, which provide rich active sites and ensure good contact between the electrolyte and active materials. The interconnected nanowire/nanoflake architecture is also beneficial in strengthening the ion/electron transfer and the structural stability. Therefore our device outperforms previous solid-state electrochromic devices with compact films.

(c) Charge/discharge profiles at 5 A g−1 with in situ optical responses measured at 2000 nm. (d) Cycling life of the solid-state electrochromic batteries at 5 A g−1. 
In order to quantify optical modulation during the charge (coloration) and discharge (bleaching) processes, we measured the transmission in situ with charge/discharge at 5 A g−1 (see result in Fig. 4c). During the test, the solid-state electrochromic battery changes from blue (colored-charged state) to transparent (bleached-discharged state) with the transmittance decreasing from 69% to 7% at 2000 nm. This process is found to be highly reversible. This clearly demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring the energy storage/release state simply by the color change and quantitatively by the optical transmission. Taking the current density of 5 A g−1 and wavelength of 2000 nm for example, in the bleached-discharged state, a transmittance of 7%, 36% and 69% corresponds to a 100%, 50% and 0% charge of the electrochromic battery, respectively. This serves as a convenient indicator for the charged status of the battery. In addition, the cycling life is an important parameter for practical applications. The designed solid-state electrochromic battery exhibits a reasonable cycling stability with a capacity of 65 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 2500 cycles with a retention of 86.7% (Fig. 4d), better than other solid-state electrochromic devices based on dense WO3 (<1600 cycles and 50% degradation)9 and V2O5 (50% degradation after 100 cycles).39,42 The corresponding average coulombic efficiency is about 97.2%. The superior performance may result mainly from the well-designed nanostructures and enhanced reaction kinetics by the rGO sandwich and nanoarray architecture.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated the combination of perovskite solar cells and solid-state electrochromic batteries in smart windows. The combination of these different energy devices together in multifunctional cladding is an effective means to reduce energy waste and minimize the additional components necessary to add to the building. Multifunctionality is validated in this integrated system including solar energy harvesting, electrochemical storage and reutilization. Solid-state electrochromic batteries were constructed based on a WO3 nanowire array anode and an rGO-connected multilayer NiO film cathode. The electrochromic charge storage/release process is indicated by the color change and can be quantitatively monitored by the optical transmittance. The large and fast optical modulation can be ascribed to the WO3 and rGO-interconnected bilayer NiO nanowire array electrodes. Our research paves a new way to construct high-performance multifunctional smart windows.

Conceptual insights
There is a wide interest in integrating different energy devices in tandem to realize self-powered systems and multifuctionalities. For modern green buildings, the electricity generation by photovoltaic systems, optical/thermal modulation by electrochromic smart windows, and corresponding electricity storage and reutilization are mostly separated. Combining them together in multifunctional cladding is a very interesting means to minimize the additional components necessary to add to the building. Conventional electrochromic windows based on thin-film oxides are powered by external batteries and do not electrochemically store the input charges. Herein, we combine cheap printable perovskite solar cells with a newly-designed electrochromic device and demonstrate solar energy harvest and energy storage as well as electrochromics. This new type of integrated smart windows with a large optical modulation particularly in the infrared wavelength region may be useful in future green buildings.
