    , Accepted 31st May 2022First published on 7th June 2022AbstractAll-inorganic halide perovskites (IHPs) hold promise in the field of optoelectronics due to their excellent thermal stability. However, the phase instability of these metastable structural polymorphs needs to be addressed. Here, a great deal of interest has been emerging to understand the phase (in)stability and report an additional stability mechanism of CsPbI2Br perovskite induced by both O2 and moisture in dry and high humid air to develop engineering strategies for making more robust IHPs. It is demonstrated that CsPbI2Br prepared in N2 experiences a sharp degradation as it is exposed to air (RH = 35%), while CsPbI2Br prepared in air shows much better long-term stability than that prepared in N2 atmosphere in both low (RH = 5–15%) and high humidity (RH = 30–55%) environments. The participation of O2 in the formation of perovskite crystals to form Pb–O bonds in the spin-coating process can prevent the transformation of CsPbI2Br from the α-phase to the δ-phase. In the presence of both oxygen and moisture, it is suggested that water can stabilize the reactive superoxide, which is formed by oxygen with excess electrons and enable them to spontaneously form additional Pb–O bonds with Pb before annealing. This can further stabilize perovskite under higher humidity conditions and improve the phase stability. This work presents a material design to develop IHPs in air with high stability.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted enormous attention and have reached an efficiency of 25.7%.1 However, the stability of PSCs is still a challenge for practical applications. They are seldom fabricated under ambient conditions because typical PSCs such as MAPbI3 are intrinsically/thermodynamically unstable and prone to decomposition, especially under external stresses of oxygen, moisture and light.2
All-inorganic halide perovskites (IHPs) exhibit an inherently more rigid crystal structure, which shows high thermal stability up to 400 °C.3 The degradation of IHPs can be induced by polymorphic transition, hydration, decomposition, and oxidation.4 The dominant degradation of IHPs is polymorphic transition.5 For example, both CsPbI3 and CsPbI2Br can easily transform from their perovskite α-phase to their non-perovskite δ-phase at room temperature.6 This perovskite to non-perovskite phase transition was facilitated under moisture conditions.5 High-performance IHPs have generally been fabricated in a gas (N2 or air) atmosphere due to their moisture sensitivity. The use of gloveboxes and inert gas is far from industrial-scale manufacturing. The sealing process is required for these glove-box-made devices, as they are not stable in ambient air. Thus, it is necessary to develop a low-cost preparation method under ambient conditions for solar cells with high stability.
Several works have focused on the effect of water and oxygen on the phase stability of CsPbI2Br. Liquid H2O could help dissolve salt and can also partially substitute DMSO to reduce the aggregated PbI2–DMSO, which benefits large perovskite crystal growth.7 The adsorbed polar water can distort [PbX6]4− octahedra, which induces a phase transition from cubic α-phase to orthorhombic δ-phase.8 Liu et al.9 obtained an efficiency of 12.5% for large-area CsPbI2Br PSCs fabricated under ambient conditions. The passivation effect of oxygen under ambient conditions was systematically studied by Hu and his colleagues.10 The dissociated oxygen atom interacts with perovskite to form Pb–O, leading to a passivation effect that significantly improves the stability and performance of air-CsPbI2Br-based solar cells. This work provides new insight into the air-stability mechanism of CsPbI2Br solar cells in low moisture ambient conditions (RH < 15%). The synergistic effect of oxygen and moisture with a wide range of humidity is still not clear. Until now, the stability of devices prepared in the presence of moisture has remained an open question. Understanding the synergistic effects of oxygen and moisture on the stability of inorganic PSCs under ambient conditions is essential for the development of IHPs for practical applications.
Herein, we systematically investigate the effects of atmospheres (air and N2) and moisture (RH = 5–55%, air) on the stability of CsPbI2Br IHPs to provide insights into the combined effects of oxygen and moisture on the stability of such devices. The results indicate that the oxygen in air can react with perovskite by forming Pb–O bonds in the spin-coating process before annealing to prevent phase transitions in humid air conditions. The air-CsPbI2Br-based IHPs prepared under higher humidity (RH = 30–45%) conditions indicate inferior photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) but much better stability than devices prepared in ambient conditions with lower humidity (<30%) and N2 atmospheres. The stability mechanism of CsPbI2Br IHPs based on different atmospheres and moisture is discussed in detail. A certain amount of moisture can initiate a synergetic process to mediate the coordination chemistry and stabilize the phase stability of CsPbI2Br. Our work thoroughly explains the passivation and degradation mechanism of oxygen and moisture for CsPbI2Br inorganic perovskites, which provides important insight into simplifying the facility requirements for the practical large-scale production of PSCs.
Results and discussion
Atmosphere (air and N2) effect on the stability of CsPbI2Br perovskites
All inorganic perovskite films prepared in an air or N2 atmosphere for SEM, XRD, UV-vis absorption and PL characterization (Fig. 1) were deposited on compact and microporous TiO2-covered FTO (noted here as FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2). The perovskite film prepared with spin-coating and annealing both in the N2 glovebox is noted as N2-CsPbI2Br, while that prepared with spin-coating and annealing both in air (RH = 35%) is noted as air-CsPbI2Br. In Fig. 1a and S1†, it is clear that the N2-CsPbI2Br film shows larger grain sizes and smooth surfaces without pinholes, while the air-CsPbI2Br film exhibits smaller grain sizes with pinholes. From the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 1a), the film thickness prepared in different atmospheres are nearly the same. The crystalline quality of N2-CsPbI2Br is greatly improved compared with air-CsPbI2Br, indicating that the atmosphere affects the crystallization process.

(e) Photoluminescence emission spectra and (f) the core-level O 1s spectra of the CsPbI2Br films prepared in different atmospheres (N2, Air and N2/Air). 

Fig. 1b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CsPbI2Br perovskite films prepared in N2 and air atmospheres. The peaks at approximately 14.6°, 20.8°, and 29.7° in both films correspond to the (100), (110), and (200) crystal planes of α-CsPbI2Br, respectively.11 The intensity of these peaks increases when changing the atmosphere from air to N2. The enhancement in the peak intensity may be attributed to the promoted crystallization of the N2-CsPbI2Br film compared to the air-CsPbI2Br film,12 which is consistent with the SEM results (Fig. 1a). Meanwhile, it is noted that the air-CsPbI2Br film shows diffraction peaks at approximately 25°–26° for δ-CsPbI2Br.13 This result demonstrates that α-CsPbI2Br was achieved under N2 atmosphere, while δ-CsPbI2Br was partially formed in air atmosphere.
From UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1c), both air-CsPbI2Br and N2-CsPbI2Br films exhibit absorption between 400 and 650 nm, and the absorption intensity of N2-CsPbI2Br is higher than that of air-CsPbI2Br. The decreased absorption intensity of air-CsPbI2Br may be attributed to the partial δ-phase formed in the air (Fig. 1b), which reduces the overall absorbance. Both films show an absorption peak at approximately 650 nm, corresponding to the characteristic peak of α-CsPbI2Br.14 This further confirms that α-CsPbI2Br was successfully formed. Consistent with the absorption spectra (Fig. 1c), the Tauc plots of (αhν)2versus energy (Fig. 1d) indicate that the optical bandgaps of N2-CsPbI2Br and air-CsPbI2Br are 1.87 eV and 1.88 eV, respectively. There is almost no change in the optical bandgap for films prepared in different atmospheres.

Fig. 1e shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CsPbI2Br films prepared in different atmospheres. The N2-CsPbI2Br film shows decreased emission intensity compared to that of the air-CsPbI2Br film, indicating that the N2-CsPbI2Br film has efficient PL quenching and effective electron charge transfer from perovskite to the TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL).15 On the other hand, the PL peak position of the N2-CsPbI2Br film is located at 653 nm, while the PL peak of the air-CsPbI2Br film is located at 649 nm. This evident blue shift of approximately 4 nm for air-CsPbI2Br compared to N2-CsPbI2Br implies that the change of band energy of perovskite after oxygen introducing into the lattice.16,17
To further understand the atmospheric effect, especially the oxygen in air, on the chemical stability of CsPbI2Br perovskite films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were applied to air-CsPbI2Br films (spinning and annealing both in air) and N2-CsPbI2Br films (spinning and annealing both in N2). To verify the time of oxygen and perovskite film reactions, a control sample that was spin-coated in N2 while annealed in air was added (denoted as N2/air-CsPbI2Br). Fig. 1f displays the O 1s peaks for the perovskite films prepared with different atmospheres. The O 1s peaks are located at 529.8 eV and 531.1 eV in the air-CsPbI2Br film, which are attributed to oxygen atoms in metal–oxide bonds18 and superoxide (O2−),19 respectively. The O 1s peaks of N2-CsPbI2Br and N2/air-CsPbI2Br films are only located at 531.3 and 531.5 eV with very weak intensity, respectively. This may be due to exposure to air during the XPS test. Therefore, the above XPS results indicate that oxygen reacts with CsPbI2Br perovskite in the process of spin-coating rather than annealing and forms Pb–O bonds under air. Both peaks of Pb 4f (approximately 138.3 eV and 143.2 eV) and I 3d (approximately 619.1 eV and 630.5 eV)20 for the N2-CsPbI2Br film show a 0.1–0.3 eV shift compared to those of the air-CsPbI2Br and N2/air-CsPbI2Br films (Table S1 and Fig. S2†). The results indicate that the binding energy intensity of Pb and I in N2-CsPbI2Br is higher. The above results suggest the progressive formation of PbOx, indicating that Pb–O bonds block the expansion of the CsPbI2Br δ-phase and stabilize the CsPbI2Br α-phase.18,19 The oxygen in the spin-coating process promotes the formation of Pb–O bonds, which has a great influence on the phase stability of perovskite.
To further understand the phase transformation of CsPbI2Br perovskite during operation, the properties of the CsPbI2Br precursor films before annealing are investigated. For the unannealed N2-CsPbI2Br film, after spin-coating on FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2, the color changes gradually with time from grey to dark (Fig. S3a†). However, for the unannealed air-CsPbI2Br film, its color is almost unchanged. These findings indicate that the compositions of the intermediate phases are possibly different. XRD diffraction patterns and UV-vis absorption spectra of the unannealed samples are shown in Fig. 2a and b. Two XRD peaks located at 10.8° and 27.6° are observed for both unannealed N2-CsPbI2Br and air-CsPbI2Br films. These peaks are ascribed to the δ-CsPbI2Br phase.13,21 The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the unannealed N2-CsPbI2Br film shows an absorption peak at approximately 650 nm and confirms the existence of the α-CsPbI2Br phase.14,21 However, for the unannealed air-CsPbI2Br film, an absorption peak is not found. According to these results, we conclude that the δ-CsPbI2Br and α-CsPbI2Br phases were partially formed for the sample prepared in N2 atmosphere, while the unannealed air-CsPbI2Br film shows a more stable phase with little δ-CsPbI2Br phase. The δ-CsPbI2Br phase in unannealed films transformed to the α-phase after annealing, as seen in XRD in Fig. 1. The CsPbI2Br perovskite film prepared in N2 after annealing forms only the α-phase, while that prepared in air forms both the α-phase and the δ-phase, which can be confirmed from Fig. 1b. The schematic of film formation in different atmospheres is exhibited in Fig. 2c.

XPS analysis of the perovskite films before annealing prepared in air and N2 was carried out, as shown in Fig. 2d and e, Table S2 and Fig. S3†. The Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 are located at 137.8 eV and 142.7 eV, respectively, and I 3d7/2 and I 3d5/2 are located at 618.6 eV and 630.1 eV, respectively, in the as-prepared N2-CsPbI2Br film. Compared with the air-CsPbI2Br film, no shift is observed for the two films. For the O 1s spectra, the peaks at 529.8 and 531.6 eV in both fresh N2 and air-CsPbI2Br films are assigned to metal oxide and superoxide (O2−).19 The O 1s peak of the N2-CsPbI2Br is due to the unavoidable exposure to air and contact with oxygen during the XPS test. For the unannealed perovskite films, oxygen can interact with the CsPbI2Br to form Pb–O during the XPS test in ambient condition. This result further proves that Pb–O bonds can be easily formed both in the unannealed air-CsPbI2Br film during spin-coating process in air and the unannealed N2-CsPbI2Br film when it is exposed to air. A proposed mechanism is shown in Fig. 2f on how oxygen and H2O interact with CsPbI2Br in different processing atmospheres.
Degradation origins of CsPbI2Br inorganic halide perovskites in different atmospheres (N2 and air)
The stability of CsPbI2Br films prepared in different atmospheres was studied by UV-vis absorption, XRD and XPS data, as shown in Fig. 3 (storage condition: RH = 35%, ambient condition). From UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3a), the CsPbI2Br film color changes from brown to yellow after being removed from the N2 glove box atmosphere. The absorption intensity of the N2-CsPbI2Br film sharply decreases as the ageing time increases, and the characteristic α-phase absorption peak at approximately 653 nm disappears after 240 min of storage in a humid environment and quickly changes from the black α-phase to the yellow δ-phase. For comparison, the absorption intensity of the air-CsPbI2Br film is almost unchanged within 120 h (Fig. 3b), and the color of the film remains unchanged yellow, indicating that no phase transition occurs in air-CsPbI2Br. Fig. 3c and d show the X-ray diffraction patterns of the CsPbI2Br films in different atmospheres. For the N2-CsPbI2Br film, the intensity of the α-phase decreases as the ageing time increases from 0 to 60 min and disappears when the ageing time reaches 240 min. The newly formed δ-phase appears when the storage time is 60 min, and the dominant δ-phase of N2-CsPbI2Br is obtained after 240 min of storage, indicating a complete phase transition from α to δ CsPbI2Br. In contrast, for the air-CsPbI2Br film, the intensity of the peaks corresponding to the α-phase decreases, and no evident phase transition occurs within 120 h (Fig. 3d), indicating better phase stability.

(e and f) XPS spectra of O 1s for CsPbI2Br films prepared in (e) N2 and (f) air atmosphere after ageing in ambient conditions (RH = 35%) for different times. 
To further verify the mechanism behind the phase transition in the CsPbI2Br film under different atmospheres, XPS was collected at different times. Fig. 3e, f and S4† show the XPS spectra of CsPbI2Br films prepared under N2 and air atmospheres, where the spectra show the peak position and intensity of Pb 4f, I 3d and O 1s with ageing time. For the N2-CsPbI2Br film, the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 orbitals of lead ions in the as-prepared N2-CsPbI2Br film are located at 138.4 eV and 143.2 eV, respectively. With increasing ageing time to 240 min, the binding energy peaks of Pb had a shift of 0.2 eV to the lower direction (Fig. S4a†). Meanwhile, the peaks of I 3d near 619.1 eV and 630.6 eV show a similar ∼0.2 eV shift of position as the storage time increases to 240 min (Fig. S4b†). The decreased binding energy of Pb and I indicates that the interaction between chemical bonds becomes weak, the density of surrounding electron clouds increases, and the crystal structure of inorganic perovskite changes from a cubic phase to an orthogonality phase.12 In Fig. 3e, N2-CsPbI2Br shows a weak peak located at 531.5 eV, which corresponds to superoxide O2− at 0 min. When the ageing time increases to 80 min, the O 1s peak located at 530.0 eV appears and shows strong intensity. It is known as an oxygen atom in a metal–oxide bond happened.18 This result suggests that there is an interaction between perovskite and oxygen when it is exposed to ambient conditions ageing with time, while no O atoms take part in the interaction during film formation annealing in N2 atmosphere. This interaction may immediately change the phase of N2-CsPbI2Br after being exposed to air and showing unstable properties. In contrast, no such obvious changes were detected for the air-CsPbI2Br film (Fig. 3f, S4c and d†), and the peak positions for Pb 4f, I 3d and O 1s of the air-CsPbI2Br film were almost unchanged within 120 h, indicating excellent stability. In particular, the air-CsPbI2Br film shows an obvious O 1s peak near ∼529.8 eV, the intensity of which is also almost unchanged as ageing time increases to 120 h, indicating a more stable phase compared to that with N2-CsPbI2Br film. According to the XPS stability results, it can be concluded that oxygen participation in CsPbI2Br film formation before annealing to form Pb–O bonds is crucial for phase stability. This is similar to the results by Yang et al.22 that chelation of the surface Pb cation of perovskite in the precursor enables enhanced efficiency and humidity stability. For N2-CsPbI2Br, oxygen participation after the posttreatment of CsPbI2Br, where crystal grains have been formed, causes corrosion of the film with an unstable crystal structure.
In summary, the effect of oxygen passivation on the phase stability of CsPbI2Br perovskites has been systematically studied. We focus on all-inorganic perovskites due to their high tolerance of oxygen induced degradation.10 The oxygen-passivated CsPbI2Br films show better phase stability than that of CsPbI2Br films prepared in N2. The phase stability benefits from the presence of Pb–O bonds formed during spin-coating before annealing which prevents the phase transition of the air-CsPbI2Br films from α- to δ-phase.
Photovoltaic performances of CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells prepared in air and N2 atmospheres
We use the conventional mesoporous heterojunction architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. 4a) to study the influence of the atmosphere (air and N2) on CsPbI2Br inorganic PSCs. Fig. 4a and b show the structure and energy level diagrams of the CsPbI2Br PSCs. Fig. 4c shows the J–V characteristics of devices prepared in air and N2 atmospheres under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The detailed photovoltaic parameters are exhibited in Table 1. The inorganic CsPbI2Br device prepared under air conditions exhibits a PCE of 5.98% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.95 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.04 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.57. For the device prepared under N2 conditions, the PCE is 6.72% with Voc of 0.89 V, Jsc of 11.11 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.68.

The long-term PCE stability of the air-CsPbI2Br device and the N2-CsPbI2Br device without encapsulation were investigated under ambient conditions with RH = 35%. The results are shown in Fig. 4d and Table 1. The PCE of the N2-CsPbI2Br device dropped from 6.72% to 0.002% after 120 h of storage. Encouragingly, the stability was dramatically improved for the air-CsPbI2Br device, which retained 64% of its initial value after 120 h under the same conditions. The air-CsPbI2Br film can stably exist for more than 100 h without any modification or additives, which indicates that the air-CsPbI2Br film shows better stability with the black α-phase.
For comparison, a planar architecture without mesoporous TiO2 is also studied (FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au). The J–V and stability properties of a planar architecture without mesoporous layer are shown in Fig. 4c and d. The IHPs prepared in N2 and air exhibit a PCE of 13.03% and 10.07%, respectively, which show much higher efficiency than devices with mesoporous ones but inferior stability. Compared with the 2.7% hysteresis of the N2-CsPbI2Br device, the hysteresis of the air-CsPbI2Br device reaches 18.2% (Table S3 and Fig. S5†).
To further demonstrate the stability of the devices prepared in different atmospheres, the steady-state power output (SPO) of the devices was carried out. The optimal steady-state PCEs of devices prepared in N2 and air based on mesoporous-TiO2 are 6.47% and 5.95% with a current density of 9.52 and 8.50 mA cm−2 over 300 s under a constant bias voltage of 0.68 V and 0.70 V, respectively (Fig. S6a†). The optimal steady-state PCEs of devices prepared in N2 and air based on dense-TiO2 are 12.94% and 10.00% with a current density of 15.41 and 11.91 mA cm−2 over 300 s under a constant bias voltage of 0.84 V, respectively (Fig. S6b†). This steady-state PCE values are very close to those obtained from the J–V curves under both forward and reverse scan modes. And these devices prepared in air are very stable for over 300 s in ambient (RH: 25–35%). In contrast, the stability of the devices prepared in N2 is slightly lower.
We adopt several characterization techniques to further confirm the effect of reduced intrinsic defect density on charge recombination behavior in devices under different operating conditions. Fig. 4f shows the dependence of Voc on various light intensities (Plight), giving the relationships Voc ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Plight).23 The N2-CsPbI2Br device shows a lower n value (n = 1.285) than the air-CsPbI2Br device (n = 1.539). A lower n value indicates that the device has less defect-mediated recombination.24 Meanwhile, the J–V on various light intensities of the device of dense TiO2 has the same trend (Fig. S7†). This result indicates that defect-mediated recombination dominates the charge loss in these devices, and defect-mediated recombination could be effectively suppressed by N2.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization was performed to demonstrate the carrier transport processes at the interface of devices with a bias of 0.9 V at frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 1 MHz under dark conditions (Fig. 4g). The equivalent circuit is illustrated in Fig. 4g, and the detailed fitting parameters are shown in Table S4†. The intercept of the semicircle on the abscissa is series resistance (Rs), the diameter of the semicircle is charge transfer resistance (Rtrans), where Rs accounts for the ohmic contribution of external contact (the ITO and top electrode) and Rtrans relates to the transport resistance of electrons within the perovskite layer.15,25,26 In Fig. 4g, the Nyquist plots indicate that Rtrans decreases for the N2-CsPbI2Br device (54.6 Ω for the N2-CsPbI2Br device and 71.7 Ω for the air-CsPbI2Br device). The pronounced decrease in Rtrans of the device in a N2 atmosphere validates the better charge transport efficiency, implying a better current density, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 4c.25
The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was carried out to calculate the trap-state densities of CsPbI2Br films with different atmospheres. The dark current–voltage (I–V) analysis for an electron-only device was used to quantify the electron trap-state density in the CsPbI2Br films. Fig. 4h and i show the I–V curves of the electron-only device with an FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/PC61BM/Au architecture in the dark. The trap-state density (ntrap) is determined using the following equation:26,27 ntrap = (2VTFLεε0)/(eL2)(1)where ε is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the electron charge, and L is the thickness of the film (400 nm). As presented in Fig. 4h–i, the trap-state densities for the N2-CsPbI2Br film and air-CsPbI2Br film are ∼2.59 × 1015 cm−3 and ∼3.59 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. These results indicate reduced trap-state density, which is beneficial to reducing the hysteresis effect and increasing the Jsc of the device.9,26,27
Synergetic effect of oxygen and moisture on the stability of air-CsPbI2Br inorganic halide perovskites
In ambient atmosphere, except for oxygen, the moisture is also an important factor that influences the fabrication of perovskite films. Usually, the adsorption of water molecules to the perovskite surface is the start of the degradation. Moisture is often considered as a factor that deteriorates the crystallization of perovskite. However, Meng et al.28 have found that moisture can activate the reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I and form final perovskite without heating. Haque et al.29 have reported that water catalyzes the reaction by stabilizing the reactive superoxide species in CH3NH3PbI3. For all-inorganic perovskite, the influence of moisture especially the synergetic effect of moisture and oxygen remains unclear. Therefore, it is valuable to understand this.
To verify the influence of moisture in air, we prepared air-CsPbI2Br films under different humidity conditions with RH from 5% to 55%. Fig. 5a shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the CsPbI2Br perovskite films prepared at different humidities. The inorganic perovskite film prepared at RH = 5% shows a uniform grain size of approximately 440 nm without pinholes. With increasing humidity, pinholes on the surface are observed, and the size of grains is irregular (Fig. S8†). Especially for the perovskite film prepared at RH = 55%, many pinholes can be observed among grains. The results also show that an increase in ambient humidity above RH = 30% is not conducive to the formation of high-quality continuous inorganic perovskite films. We observed a significant change in morphology with varying atmospheric humidity. With increasing humidity, the particle sizes of CsPbI2Br films gradually decreased (from 440 nm to 296 nm), which was caused by moisture in the air.30,31 Different from traditional organic–inorganic perovskite thin film, a smaller grain size is more likely to be the ideal morphology for all-inorganic CsPbI2Br, because it can stabilize the α-CsPbI2Br due to its higher surface energy.21,32 From Fig. 5b, the δ-phase in CsPbI2Br film increases with humidity. More δ-phase results in more strip-like patterns on the CsPbI2Br surface (as shown in Fig. S8†), which is the main reason for the decrease in particle size of CsPbI2Br films with the increasing of humidity.33,34

(b) XRD diffraction patterns. (c) Tauc plot of (αhν)2vs. the photoenergy. (d) Photoluminescence emission spectra. (e–i) XPS spectra of O 1s for CsPbI2Br films prepared at different humidity conditions (e) RH = 5%, (f) RH = 15%, (g) RH = 30%, (h) RH = 45% and (i) RH = 55%. (j) The O 1s spectrum for annealing N2-CsPbI2Br films prepared with water as additives in precursor (the volume ratio of water to perovskite precursor solution is 1:400, 1:200,1:100, 1:40 and 1:20). 

Fig. 5b shows the X-ray diffraction results of air-CsPbI2Br perovskite films prepared under different humidity conditions. The diffraction peaks at 14.6°, 20.8° and 29.5° can be assigned to the (100), (110) and (200) crystal planes of α-phase CsPbI2Br perovskite films, respectively.9,13 The crystal plane of δ-CsPbI2Br is observed in perovskite film when RH > 15%, indicating that air-CsPbI2Br film undergoes a phase transformation only when the humidity reaches a certain degree.13 With increasing humidity, the intensity of the α-phase diffraction peak decreases gradually, and the intensity of the δ-phase diffraction peak increases gradually, indicating that an increase in humidity will lead to a crystal phase transition from the α-phase to the δ-phase in the perovskite film. The α-phase is metastable at room temperature, and the absorbed polar molecules (H2O) can induce a shift in the electron cloud of Cs, leading to the migration of Cs cations followed by distortion of PbI6 octahedra and octahedral cavities, resulting in a phase transition from cubic to orthorhombic phases such as dominoes.8 The phase transition induced by water may tend to start from the grain boundaries and then spread into the grain interiors.35 Therefore, most inorganic perovskites are not stable in humid air, and the preparation process of inorganic perovskite atmosphere requirements is very strict. The Tauc plots of (αhν)2versus energy (Fig. 5c) indicate that the optical bandgaps of perovskites gradually decrease from 1.87 eV to 1.76 eV with increasing humidity from 5% to 55%. The shift in their optical absorption bandgap also implies a phase transformation. Fig. 5d shows the normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CsPbI2Br films prepared under different humidity conditions. The emission positions of perovskite films show a blue shift from 650 to 645 nm as the humidity increases from 5% to 55%, which suggests that the change of band energy of perovskite,16,17 which is consistent with the results as shown in Fig. 5c.
To determine which is the dominant factor influencing the stability of CsPbI2Br or promoting the formation of Pb–O bonds in CsPbI2Br. XPS measurements of CsPbI2Br perovskite prepared at different humidities (5–55%) were carried out, and the spectra are shown in Fig. 5e–i. Detailed information on the binding energy for the Pb 4f, O 1s and I 3d core levels is available in Table 2. Generally, for O 1s spectra, three different components must necessarily be considered, which are assigned to oxide (O2−) at 530.0 ± 0.1 eV, water (H2O) at 533.0 ± 0.1 eV and superoxide (O2−) at 531.8 ± 0.1 eV.19 In Fig. 3 and 5, the peak positions of the O 1s spectrum are located near ∼529.9 eV and ∼531.5 eV, which are assigned to oxide (O2−) and superoxide (O2−), respectively. Specifically, the O of oxide (O2−) and superoxide (O2−) comes from H2O and O2 in air, respectively.10 However, from our study on the XPS of CsPbI2Br film with water as additives (Fig. 5j and S9†), no Pb–O bond was found. This means that water as an additive in the precursor cannot induce an interaction between the O atom and perovskite to form Pb–O bonds. As observed in Fig. 5e–i, the oxygen atoms in the Pb–O bonds mainly come from O2. With increasing humidity, the peak positions of the O 1s spectrum located at 530.0 eV shift 0.4 eV to the lower binding energy direction, and the peak intensity of the O 1s spectrum located at 531.5 eV gradually decreases, indicating that Pb–O interaction is continuously happened and the superoxide (O2−) is reduced. Superoxide (O2−) is formed by the reaction of adsorbed O2 with excess photogenerated electrons.19,36 It has also been reported that water catalyzes the reaction by stabilizing the O2− species and increasing its reactivity,37 enabling them to react with Pb to form an additional Pb–O bond with surface Pb.38 The Pb 4f core level spectrum of the CsPbI2Br film exhibits two strong peaks of 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 located at 138.6 and 143.5 eV, respectively. Moreover, with increasing humidity (from 5 to 55%), the binding energies of Pb 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks in air-CsPbI2Br shift to the lower binding energy side by ∼0.5 eV, which further confirms the Pb–O bond in air-CsPbI2Br.10,13 Similarly, in Fig. S10† and Table 2, a small binding energy shift was observed in the I 3d core-level spectra in air-CsPbI2Br after the presence of Pb–O, which may be due to the weak interaction between I and Pb atoms.39 These facts indicate that moisture can initiate a synergetic process to mediate the coordination chemistry with Pb–O bonds and enhance the phase stability of CsPbI2Br under ambient conditions.

The synergetic mechanism of moisture and oxygen on CsPbI2Br is shown in Fig. 6. Moisture influences the crystallization of perovskite, where continuous film with large particle size is formed under lower humidity (<30%), while the film with more grain boundaries and small particle size is obtained under higher humidity (30–55%) due to the formation of insulated δ-phases.21 δ-phases increases with the increase of humidity which deteriorate the light absorption and charge transport of device. However, on the other side, moisture catalyzes the reaction by stabilizing the O2− species and increasing its reactivity to form Pb–O bond with uncoordinated Pb2+ to enhance the phase stability of CsPbI2Br.39

Stability origins of air-CsPbI2Br films prepared in different moisture
To verify the stability mechanism of air-CsPbI2Br films prepared under different humidity conditions, the films were stored in air (RH < 35%), and their changes with ageing time were observed. The color/optical/phase changes were recorded every period to explore the stability of the perovskite films. The color of the CsPbI2Br perovskite film changes from dark brown to light brown as the ageing time increases (Fig. 7a). The films prepared at low humidity (5–30%) show a more unstable ability and cannot maintain their main α-CsPbI2Br above 72 h. In particular, the color of the perovskite film prepared at 5% humidity almost becomes transparent after 144 h. In contrast, the color of the perovskite films prepared at high humidity (45%, 55%) is more stable. From UV-vis absorption and XRD data (Fig. 7b–e), the films prepared in high humidity show better stability than those prepared in low humidity. The absorption peak at 649 nm (α-CsPbI2Br) for the film prepared at RH = 45% remained unchanged after storage in air for 240 h, indicating a stable phase. However, the absorption peak at 649 nm of the film prepared in 15% humidity disappeared after 240 h storage, which proves that the perovskite has undergone phase transformation.

(a) Photographs of CsPbI2Br films prepared in different moisture with ageing time. (b and c) UV-vis spectra changes of (b) RH = 15% and (c) RH = 45% of CsPbI2Br films with ageing time.

(h–k) Ageing of photovoltaic performance CsPbI2Br PSCs prepared in ambient humidity, including (h) Voc, (i) Jsc, (j) FF, (k) PCE. 
From XRD studies (Fig. 7d and e), there are no α-phase (100), (110) and (200) diffraction peaks, but only δ-phase diffraction peaks are observed when placing the CsPbI2Br film prepared in RH = 15% humidity for 240 h, proving that the perovskite has completely undergone phase transformation. On the other hand, the CsPbI2Br film prepared at RH = 45% has a strong δ-phase diffraction peak at the beginning of preparation but still shows three strong diffraction peaks of the α-phase (100), (110) and (200) after 240 h, indicating that the internal perovskite is still dominated by the cubic phase. Although the quality of perovskite films prepared at high humidity is less than at low humidity and shows a δ-phase at the beginning of film formation, it shows much better air stability. This result indicates that the CsPbI2Br film can be prepared under high humidity, and its stability in air is improved compared to that prepared in low humidity.
The J–V curves of CsPbI2Br inorganic PSCs with mesoporous TiO2 structure (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) with various humidities (RH = 5–55%) were measured under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5G). The dependence of Jsc, Voc, the fill factor (FF), and the PCE on the humidity are presented in Fig. 7f and Table S5†. The Jsc decreases from 12.72 to 8.07 mA cm−2 when the humidity increases from 5 to 55%. The Voc and FF changed little. The PCE of devices decreases with increasing humidity. A maximum efficiency of 7.01% is obtained from the device fabricated at the lowest humidity with RH = 5%. Meanwhile, devices with dense TiO2 only with various humidities (FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) under various humidities are also investigated (Fig. S11 and Table S6†). The inorganic PSC prepared in air with RH = 5% exhibits the best PCE of 12.40% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.10 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.34 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.69. The PCE decreases and hysteresis increases when the humidity increases from 5 to 55%.
In Fig. 7g, Rtrans increases from 57.99 to 516.60 Ω. The increase in Rtrans illustrates inferior charge transport, indicating poor current density, which is consistent with the results shown in Table S5.† To understand the electron extraction and transport mechanism, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was carried out for CsPbI2Br films under different moisture contents. Fig. S12† shows the TRPL spectra of RH = 15% and RH = 45% samples. The dynamic TRPL data are fitted by a bi-exponential equation:26,27 (2) (3)where Ai is the decay amplitude, τi is the decay time, and B is a constant. The related parameters are summarized in Table S7†. Compared with the average electron life (τaverage) of high humidity (RH = 45%; τaverage = 0.92 ns), the τaverage of low humidity increases to 5.23 ns, which may be related to the suppression of surface defects.26,27
To assess the effect of humidity on the long-term stability of CsPbI2Br inorganic PSCs, the ageing test of unencapsulated devices under ambient conditions was carried out, as shown in Fig. 7h–k. The devices were exposed to a humid condition (RH = 35%) in ambient conditions and measured periodically. The CsPbI2Br device prepared at RH = 15% shows continuous degradation of the PCE due to the phase transition from the α-phase to the δ-phase, which is reduced by 80% over 190 h. However, the CsPbI2Br device prepared at RH = 45% shows improved stability, which can maintain 50% of the initial PCE over. The Voc and FF of devices remain almost unchanged. The loss in Jsc causes a PCE decay. This result suggests that proper moisture contributes to the stability of the device.
Conclusions
In summary, we identify a correlation between the exposure of the inorganic halide perovskite layer in air and phase stability during processing. In particular, we identify mechanisms of the structural and chemical evolution of CsPbI2Br inorganic halide perovskites in different humid air. The CsPbI2Br films prepared in air benefit from the presence of Pb–O bonds before annealing, which blocks the propagation of the δ-CsPbI2Br phase. Therefore, all-inorganic perovskite solar cells prepared in air are more stable than those prepared in N2. The PCE of CsPbI2Br inorganic PSCs prepared in air can still maintain more than 60% of the initial value, while that of inorganic PSCs with N2-CsPbI2Br has tended to 0% after 120 h. The air-CsPbI2Br based PSCs prepared in higher humidity (RH = 30–45%) conditions indicate inferior photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) but much better stability compared to the devices prepared in ambient with lower humidity (<30%) and N2 atmosphere. The water catalyzes the reaction by stabilizing the O2− species, enabling them to react with Pb to form an additional Pb–O bond with surface Pb, which promotes the stability of CsPbI2Br films in a highly humid environment.
We have demonstrated that oxygen could passivate uncoordinated Pb2+ in CsPbI2Br films prior to annealing which effectively improves phase stability of CsPbI2Br. Moisture could catalyze the reaction by stabilizing the O2− species and increasing its reactivity to form Pb–O bond with uncoordinated Pb2+ to enhance phase stability of CsPbI2Br. Based on these fundamentals, an air stable all-inorganic perovskite is expected to be fabricated in inert atmosphere or dry-air with high film quality and improved ambient phase stability by introducing Lewis bases (containing –O, –S, –N etc.) in precursor solution before annealing to help passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+.We hope this work will initiate investigations to stabilize the perovskite phase of IHPs and facilitate the development of highly stable IHPs under ambient conditions.

All salts and solvents were used without any further purification.
Device fabrication
The pre-patterned FTO substrates were cleaned sequentially in deionized water and ethyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, respectively. A compact TiO2 layer was prepared by spin-coating of 0.2 M titanium(IV) isopropoxide in 1-butanol on FTO at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then heated at 500 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 paste was diluted with ethanol (TiO2:ethanol = 1:4 by weight) and then spin-coated on the compact layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. After the spin-coating, the substrate was heated at 500 °C for 30 min. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by adding 260 mg CsI, 231 mg PbI2, 184 mg PbBr2 in 1 mL DMSO, followed by heating at 70 °C for 2 h and the precursor solution was filtered by a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. Then, precursor solution (75 μL) was dropped onto the TiO2 substrate and spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The 200 μL isopropanol as an anti-solvent was drop-casting on the perovskite layer during spin-coating of perovskite precursor in the last 10 s. The perovskite films were heated at 280 °C for 5 min on a hotplate. For devices without mesoporous TiO2 (FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag), the perovskite films were heated at 45 °C for 3 min followed by 160 °C for 5 min on a hotplate. Then 50 μL of Spiro-OMeTAD solution (72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of TBP, and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg of Li-TFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile solved in 1 mL of CB) was coated as hole transport layer (HTL) by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm of Au was thermally evaporated (pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa) as a top electrode to finish the device fabrication. For devices without mesoporous TiO2, the top electrode is Ag with 100 nm. All devices were masked with an area aperture of 0.1657 cm2 to define the active areas. For the inorganic PSCs prepared in air, the RH is controlled from 5 to 55% in an air-glovebox (Universal, Mikrouna Co., Ltd., China). For the inorganic PSCs prepared in N2, the water and oxygen contents are both below 50 ppm in a N2-filled glovebox.
Solar cell characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) and the variable light intensity J–V characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under standard AM1.5G illumination (SS-F5; Enli Technology, Taiwan), and the light intensity was calibrated using a standard SRC-2020 silicon reference cell. The J–V curves were obtained in the range from 1.2 V to −0.1 V with a scan speed of 50 mV s−1 from both reverse and forward scan directions. The ageing of devices was carried out in ambient conditions with RH = 35%.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS; AUT86802, Metrohm, Switzerland) characterization was performed to demonstrate the carrier transport processes at the interface of devices with a bias of 0.9 V at the frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 1 MHz under dark conditions. The equivalent circuit diagram is fitted by ZSimDemo software.
The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was carried out to calculate the trap-state densities of CsPbI2Br films with different atmospheres. The dark current–voltage (I–V) analysis for an electron-only device (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/PC61BM/Au) was used to quantify the electron trap-state density in the CsPbI2Br films. The trap-state density (ntrap) is determined using the equation: ntrap = (2VTFLεε0)/(eL2), where ε is the relative dielectric constant of CsPbI2Br inorganic perovskite material, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), and L is the thickness of the film (400 nm).
Material characterization
The morphology of N2/air perovskite films was characterized by field emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM; TESCAN MIRA4, Oxford ULTIM-max 40) of 20k eV. The obtained products were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Empyren, PANalytical, Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation under operating conditions of 40 kV and 40 mA (with the θ–2θ scan mode from 10 to 80° in steps of 0.01°). Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-vis; UV-1800, Hitachi, Japan) was used to collect absorption spectra of N2/air perovskite films. Photoluminescence (PL, Edinburgh Instruments, United Kingdom, 200–1700 nm full-range steady-state spectrum) spectra were measured using FLS1000 with a 466 nm pulsed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a Kratos AXIS SUPRA+ scanning XPS microprobe using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray of 1456.69 eV with a resolution of 0.1 eV. All peaks were calibrated using C 1s peak at 284.8 eV to correct charge shift of binding energies. The samples were prepared on TiO2-coated FTO glass substrates. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured by PCS-130 Becker&Hickle GmbH (Excitation wavelength: 405 nm, repetition frequency: 10 M Hz). The samples were prepared on the FTO glass substrates.
