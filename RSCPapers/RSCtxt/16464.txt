1. Introduction
Wearable electronics have offered great convenience to us and have gradually become indispensable in our daily lives. They can be directly worn on the human body as everyday accessories or clothing.1–3 Multiple electronic components and computing devices are employed to provide smart functions like sensing, responding to various environmental stimuli, and tracking health parameters.2,4 The recent booming growth of the Internet of things and artificial intelligence has further promoted the development of a new generation of wearable devices with more functions.5,6 For example, with an Apple Watch 6 on the wrist, users can answer a call, surf the internet, watch videos, remotely control home devices, and even make online payments, among other things. To facilitate their development, flexible power systems with the merits of high energy storage performance and adaptability to frequent shape deformation during use are highly desired. Recently, one-dimensional (1D) electrochemical energy storage devices (ESDs), especially 1D Zn-based ESDs (1DZESDs), have emerged as a promising candidate due to their unique features.3,7–11
Among the widely used ESDs, supercapacitors suffer from low energy density which restricts their practical applications,12,13 while the high cost and safety issues of Li-ion batteries remain to be addressed.14,15 In contrast, rechargeable Zn-based ESDs have several advantages over other ESDs stemming from the Zn anode: (1) Zn metal has a high capacity of 5855 mA h cm−3, which is much higher than those of many other metals, for example, 2061 mA h cm−3 for Li; (2) Zn has a low redox potential (−0.763 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) which allows the device to work in aqueous electrolytes; (3) Zn has a high natural abundance and can be mass-produced at a low cost; and (4) Zn is environmentally friendly and intrinsically safe.10,16–23 1DZESDs typically have cylindrical structures (fiber-/yarn-/wire-/cable-like structures) with diameter ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers and length from several millimeters to meters.7,9,24 The 1D cylindrical structures endow them with several advantages over their conventional, rigid, and bulky counterparts: (1) 1DZESDs are mechanically flexible and light in weight, which enables them to withstand long-term and frequent deformations generated by the human body, ensuring excellent wearability. (2) They can be scaled up by self-integration to meet diverse energy and power requirements. (3) 1DZESDs can be packed into small spaces with diverse shapes in wearable devices, offering great design versatility. (4) They can be integrated with other 1D devices (e.g., sensors and solar cells) to create multifunctional wearable systems.7,8,24,25
Pioneering work on 1D batteries was carried out by Peng's group in 2013. They reported a wire-shaped micro-Li-ion battery which consists of multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT)/MnO2 composite fibers and Li wire as the cathode and anode, respectively.33 This work opens the door to exploring various 1D batteries, such as Li, Na, and Zn-ion batteries.7,34,35 Due to the advantages of Zn-based ESDs mentioned above, Zn-based batteries have attracted much attention. The first reported 1DZESD was a Zn–C battery demonstrated by Zou et al. in 2013 (see Fig. 1).26 It consists of a Zn wire anode, a MnO2-coated carbon fiber (CF) cathode, and a coiled wire separator which were assembled into a plastic tube filled with ZnCl2 + NH4Cl liquid electrolyte. Nevertheless, the Zn–C battery is not rechargeable, and the utilization of liquid electrolytes may cause leakage issues, restricting its practical application potential in powering wearable electronics. In 2014, Cho's group reported the first 1D Zn–air batteries (1DZABs) with a core–sheath structure, including a Zn wire core, gelatin/KOH gel electrolyte layer, air electrode layer loaded with an oxygen reduction catalyst, and the outermost packaging layer with holes to enable air to pass through.27 The absence of an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst in the air electrode made the devices non-rechargeable, but it triggered great interest in 1DZABs. In particular, the fast development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/ORR bifunctional catalysts has made rechargeable 1DZABs gain more visibility since then.28,36–39 The successful demonstration of 1DZABs has also encouraged researchers to explore other Zn-based battery systems. In 2016, Arias et al. developed the first 1D rechargeable alkaline Zn battery (1DAZB), i.e., a Zn–Ag battery fabricated by layer-by-layer coating a polymer layer, separator, silver cathode, and the packaging layer in sequence on a Zn wire.29 The assembled device worked stably over 170 charging/discharging cycles, and even under repetitive deformation conditions. Since then, other 1DAZB systems mainly including Zn–Ni and Zn–Co batteries have emerged as two other research frontiers. Meanwhile, Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs), operated in mild aqueous electrolytes, emerged in 2011 as another important member of the Zn-based electrochemical energy storage device family. In 2018, for the first time, Zhi's group presented a 1D ZIB (1DZIB) using Zn and MnO2 deposited CNT yarn as electrodes and cross-linked polyacrylamide (PAM)/ZnSO4 + MnSO4 as gel electrolyte.40 This 1DZIB exhibited excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles. It should be emphasized that they extended the length of the 1DZIB to 1.1 m, making it significantly longer than previously reported 1DZESDs which were typically several centimeters in length. Long 1D devices are urgently required to fabricate energy storage textiles for large energy consumption applications.41,42 Meanwhile, the increasing richness of the pool of emerging electrode materials for ZIBs offers new opportunities to further enhance the electrochemical energy storage performance of 1DZIBs. For example, V-based materials with large capacity and good stability, and conductive polymers with high electrical conductivity have been applied to assemble high-performance 1DZIBs.17,18,23,43 Metal-ion capacitors are regarded as a promising candidate to bridge the gap between batteries and supercapacitors, delivering high energy density and power density simultaneously.44–47 In this regard, Chen's group demonstrated the first 1D Zn-ion capacitor (1DZIC) in 2019 by pairing a Zn deposited CF anode and graphene/CNT hybrid composite cathode separated by ZnSO4-filled polyacrylic acid (PAA) hydrogel.32 The 1DZIC exhibited excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility.

Researchers have made great progress in 1DZESDs over the last few years. In this review, we provide a critical overview of the development of 1DZESDs, including 1DZIBs, 1DAZBs, 1DZABs, and 1DZICs. We first introduce the design basis of 1DZESDs from device configurations, 1D substrates, and gel electrolytes to their diverse energy storage mechanisms. Then we present in detail the frontier research on various 1DZESD systems including electrode preparation, electrolyte, device assembly, electrochemical performance, mechanical properties, and additional functions desired for practical utilization in each section. Strategies and achievements in enhancing their electrochemical performance and mechanical properties, achieving multifunctionality, etc. are highlighted. At the same time, we have identified the existing benchmarks, pointed out the existing problems, and predicted the direction for improvement. Finally, we provide our perspectives on future efforts to further push 1DZESDs towards practical utilization. We hope that this review will encourage researchers to put more effort into the research and commercialization of 1DZESDs.
2. The design basis for 1DZESDs
2.1. General device configurations
The basic components of 1DZESDs are the same as those of their traditional counterparts, and include the Zn metal anode and cathode separated by a separator or gel electrolytes. An additional encapsulation package is sometimes applied to prevent the leakage of liquid electrolytes if used and protect the devices from environmental damage. As shown in Fig. 2a–e, 1DZIBs, 1DAZBs, and 1DZICs typically have four main configurations including (1) parallel (two 1D electrodes are placed in parallel), (2) coiled (two 1D electrodes are wound on a core 1D substrate), (3) twisted (two 1D electrodes are twisted together), and (4) coaxial (one outer 1D or film electrode is wrapped on the surface of a core 1D electrode). The electrochemical energy storage performance is correlated with the accessible active materials and the face-to-face area of the two electrodes at a certain distance.50 In general, a high utilization ratio of active materials and a small gap between the two electrodes are desired.51–53 For the parallel-type devices, the gap between the electrodes can be easily controlled and the chance of short-circuiting is low.24 But the utilization efficiency of active materials is poor because of the limited contact area between the two electrodes. In addition, it usually requires a flat substrate as the mechanical support to withstand harsh deformation conditions and maintain structural stability, limiting its usage scenarios. The coiled structure is specifically designed to make the resultant device stretchable. This structure is extremely useful in certain cases where repetitive deformation occurs along their axial direction. The twisted structure is common in the textile fabrication industry. Compared to the parallel-type devices, the face-to-face area between the two electrodes is increased, and the structure is more stable. However, the twisted configuration increases the risk of short-circuiting.50 The core–sheath structure of the coaxial-type devices enables a large contact area between the two electrodes and the high utilization ratio of active materials. A previous study demonstrates that the coaxial structure increases the volume utilization rate by 100% in contrast to the twisted structures.54 Nevertheless, the large contact area between the two electrodes also significantly increases the risk of short-circuiting. So far, parallel and twisted structures are the two most often used configurations in 1DZIBs, 1DAZBs, and 1DZICs due to their technical simplicity. In particular, a parallel structure is popular in those devices with short length.

Copyright 2020 ACS. 1DZABs generally have two device configurations including (f) the common coaxial structure with the air cathode outside and (g) hollow coaxial structure with the air cathode inside. Images of the configurations of 1DZABs: reproduced with permission.8 Copyright 2020 Elsevier. 
For 1DZABs, the Zn metal anode and air cathode are preferred to be assembled in a coaxial manner, including (1) the common coaxial configuration (the air cathode wire/strips are wrapped around a 1D Zn anode separated by gel electrolytes) and (2) the hollow coaxial configurations (the air cathode is constructed as the inner layer to access the air and the metal wire/strips serving as the anode coated with gel electrolytes are wrapped around it (Fig. 2f and g)). The common coaxial configuration can protect the inner Zn anode from corrosion by ambient moisture, and the large-diameter air cathode has a large exposed surface to access air.8 For the hollow coaxial-type device, its inner channel can function as a pure oxygen reservoir for specific cases.8 But its relatively complex structure increases the construction difficulty.
2.2. 1D substrates for 1DZESDs
In general, 1D substrates for 1DZESDs are required to have high electrical conductivity to ensure fast electron transfer and excellent mechanical flexibility to sustain daily wearing and knitting/weaving activity.11,55 So far, metal wires, modified textile yarns, and various carbon-based fibers are most widely used to fabricate 1DZESDs (Table 1).

As the bending strain of materials is in proportion to their thickness, metal becomes bendable when its size is very thin.56 Thus, various thin metal wires with diameters down to several micrometers, such as stainless steel (SS), nickel, silver, and copper wires, have been used to fabricate 1DZESDs. The overwhelming advantage of metal wires is their ultra-high electrical conductivity. For example, SS wire has an electrical conductivity of 1.45 × 106 S m−1, while that of Cu wire can reach 5.96 × 107 S m−1. Nevertheless, metal wires are heavy, and many of them are not stable in acidic or alkaline electrolytes, impeding their practical application.
Textile yarns including natural yarns (e.g., cotton yarn) and synthetic polymeric yarns (e.g., nylon yarns) have the advantages of being lightweight, low-cost, and commercially available in large quantities. To make them conductive, various conductive materials are coated on their outer surfaces, such as silver nanowires, nickel metal, CNTs, and conductive polymers. For example, a single-walled CNT (SWCNT)-coated cotton yarn exhibits a conductivity of 5 S m−1,57 and replacing SWNCTs with Ni can further increase the conductivity to 62.5 S m−1.58 However, their conductivity is still not satisfactory especially compared to that of metal wires. In addition, how to stably and uniformly anchor conductive materials on textile yarns remains challenging.
Meanwhile, carbon-based fibers including commercial carbon (graphite) fibers, CNT fibers, and graphene-based fibers have emerged as promising candidates to fabricate 1DZESDs. In contrast to textile yarns, carbon-based fibers have comparable mechanical properties but significantly higher electrical conductivity.24 For example, the electrical conductivity of commercial CF and graphene fibers exceeds 1 × 105 S m−1 which already approaches that of some metal wires.59–62 At the same time, their density is several times lower than that of metal wires. Equally importantly, carbon-based materials are chemically inert in electrolytes, ensuring that the assembled 1DZESD delivers stable electrochemical performance. However, it should be noted that, except CF, most other carbon-based fibers are still produced on a lab-scale, and thus high cost is an inevitable issue that hinders their practical applications.
2.3. Gel electrolytes for 1DZESDs
The desired electrolyte characteristics for 1DZESDs include high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical strength/flexibility, thermal/chemical stability, low interfacial resistance, low cost, and environment friendliness.19,23,63–66 Despite the fact that liquid electrolytes have higher ionic conductivity, gel electrolytes are preferred to fabricate flexible 1DZESDs because of the following advantages: (1) gel electrolytes can prevent the leakage issue in the case of using liquid electrolytes. (2) Gel electrolytes also serve as the separator which simplifies the device architecture and manufacturing process. (3) The good mechanical properties of most gel electrolytes are compatible with those of flexible 1D devices. (4) Due to the limited water content, gel electrolytes can effectively suppress side reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER), Zn dendrite growth, and the dissolution of active materials.20,67–69
Gel electrolytes typically consist of a polymer framework as a host, an organic/aqueous solution as a plasticizer, and salts as ion donors.67 Various polymer frameworks have been used to prepare gel electrolytes for 1DZESDs, including poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), PAM, gelatin, PAA, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC), etc. Among them, PVA-based electrolytes are most frequently used in Zn-based ESDs with alkaline, neutral, and mild electrolytes. This should be attributed to PVA's ease of preparation, good film-forming properties, non-toxic characteristics, low cost, and abundant hydrophilic hydroxyl groups for good water absorbency.70–72 However, PVA-based gel electrolytes often suffer from fluidity problems at high temperatures. Some of them (e.g., PVA/KOH) have a short life due to continuous dehydration. Recently, PAM has stood out as a promising polymer framework candidate to prepare gel electrolytes for multifunctional devices due to its unique properties.40,73,74 So far, PAM-based electrolytes have been mainly used to fabricate 1DZIBs.40,75 Pure PAM displays poor thermal and mechanical stability due to the lack of crosslinking points among chain segments.67,68 In this regard, chemical crosslinking has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to establish strong bonds between chain segments in PAM, resulting in highly porous frameworks with excellent mechanical properties. For example, Zhi's group prepared a cross-linked PAM-based gel electrolyte by using acrylamide as the monomer, potassium persulfate as an initiator, and N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) as the cross-linker.40 Covalent cross-links and hydrogen bonds could be formed between PAM chains with a cross-linker. The resultant ZnSO4 + MnSO4 absorbed PAM electrolyte shows an excellent tensile strength (273 kPa) and high stretchability to 3000% strain. PAM contains a large number of hydrophilic groups such as amide groups (–CONH2) which is beneficial to water absorbency. Also, it should be emphasized that the porous structure is good for the efficient diffusion of salt ions. Thus, the above PAM-based electrolyte possesses a good ionic conductivity of 17.3 mS cm−1 and retains 16.5 mS cm−1 when subjected to a strain of 300%. Gelatin-based gel electrolytes have also been used in both ZIBs and ZABs. Gelatin contains abundant hydrophilic groups, such as amidogens, hydrogen, and carbonyls, making it feasible to accommodate plenty of water molecules enabling relatively high ionic conductivity.23,68,76,77 However, its mechanical stretchability is not satisfactory.67 In addition, other polymers such as CMC and PAA have also been used.32,78,79 Their comparison across several features is summarized in Table 2. Besides the selection of polymer frameworks, electrolyte additives can also influence the properties of gel electrolytes. For example, Zhi et al. demonstrated that the introduction of borax effectively improves the ionic conductivity of a gelatin-based electrolyte from 13.9 to 20 mS cm−1.80 They proposed that the addition of borax in electrolytes increased the concentration of free ions, such as tetra-functional borate ions, and improved the water retention capability. Besides, methanesulfonic acid additive, serving as a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, forms numerous intermolecular hydrogen bonds with PVA chains.48 It enhances the water capture effect and cationic conductivity in the PVA/ZnCl2 + NH4Cl electrolytes, evidenced by an increased ionic conductivity from 8.8 to 30.6 mS cm−1. Peng's group demonstrated that the addition of polyethylene oxide (PEO) in PVA/KOH electrolytes can improve their mechanical properties with a maximum strain of 300%, which enabled the fabrication of a stretchable 1DZAB.28 The addition of ethylene glycol in PVA/ZnCl2 + NH4Cl can extend the working temperature window for the electrolyte down to −20 °C.81

3. Energy storage mechanisms
3.1. Zn-ion batteries
In general, ZIBs consist of a Zn metal anode, a cathode for hosting Zn2+, and neutral Zn2+-containing electrolytes (e.g., ZnSO4, ZnCl2, Zn(CF3SO3)2 solution). Various materials mainly including Mn-, V-, Prussian blue analog (PBA)-, and conductive polymer-based materials have been explored as cathode materials for ZIBs. The energy storage mechanisms of ZIBs vary with cathode materials and their diverse physicochemical properties. Unlike the well-established lithium/sodium ion storage mechanisms (e.g., insertion, conversion, and alloying), the energy storage mechanism in aqueous ZIBs remains controversial. In general, several mechanisms have been proposed for ZIBs, including (1) Zn2+ insertion/extraction, (2) Zn2+ and H+ co-insertion/extraction, (3) Zn2+ insertion/extraction and anion interaction/release, and (4) conversion reaction mechanisms.

3.1.1. Zn2+ insertion/extraction mechanism. 
The ionic radius of Zn2+ is around 0.75 Å, while the hydrated ion radius is 4.12–4.30 Å which is similar to that of hydrated Li+.83 The relatively small ionic size enables the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ in the cathode materials with the layered or tunnel crystal structure. To date, Zn2+ insertion/extraction has been demonstrated in various materials, including Mn- and V-based transition metal oxides and compounds, etc. For example, in 2012, Kang reported a ZIB which is composed of an α-MnO2 cathode, a zinc anode, and a mild ZnSO4 or Zn(NO3)2 aqueous electrolyte (see Fig. 3a).84 In α-MnO2, the basic building unit of MnO6 octahedron is assembled into tunnel-type structures by sharing corners. A reversible storage/release of Zn2+ into/out of crystalline α-MnO2 tunnels was confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) studies as follows:

Reproduced with permission.86 Copyright 2016 Springer Nature. 
During the discharging process, Zn2+ ions insert into α-MnO2 to form ZnMn2O4. Meanwhile, on the anode side, Zn is oxidized to Zn2+ to retain a constant concentration of Zn2+ in the electrolyte. During the charging process, reverse reactions, namely, Zn2+ extraction and Zn2+ reduction, occur on the cathode and anode, respectively. The proposed insertion/extraction mechanism was later verified by Kim et al. in 2015, who noticed the shuttling of Mn4+ and Mn3+via ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses, and found that the interplanar spacing for the (110) facet of α-MnO2 varied between 7.036 and 6.915 Å during the Zn2+ insertion/extraction process.85 Meanwhile, this group also studied the energy storage mechanism of γ-MnO2 in ZIBs.85 By combining in situ synchrotron XANES and XRD, they observed a multiphase transformation from the parent tunnel-type γ-MnO2 to spinel-type ZnMn2O4 and continuously to two new intermediary phases, i.e., tunnel-type γ-ZnxMnO2 and layered-type L-ZnyMnO2, with successive Zn2+ insertion during the discharging process (Fig. 3b). All these phases coexist after complete Zn2+ insertion. During the charging process, all the phases gradually reversed back to γ-MnO2.
Besides Mn-based transition metal oxides, other cathode materials have also demonstrated the capability to host Zn2+, of which V-based transition metal oxides are particularly popular. For example, Nazar's group pioneeringly applied Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O composed of V2O5 layers in ZIBs (Fig. 3c and d).86 These V2O5 layers are pillared by interlayer Zn2+ and water molecules, ensuring sufficient space for the further insertion/extraction of Zn2+. As shown in Fig. 3d, upon immersion in the electrolyte, the interlayer distance of Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O was found to increase from 10.8 Å to 12.9 Å owing to the intercalation of water molecules, forming Zn0.25V2O5·yH2O (y > n). During the discharging process, the ZnxV2O5·yH2O undergoes an initial Zn2+ insertion process when x < 0.55, and there is a phase transition when x ≈ 0.55. When 0.55 < x < 0.6, the water molecules trapped between the layers are expelled as indicated by the sharply decreased interlayer spacing from 12.3 Å to 11.0 Å which is similar to the 10.8 Å in the pristine material. And in the following discharging process, the Zn content (x) continuously increases to 1.4. The charging process follows the reverse evolution of the discharging process.


3.1.2. Zn2+ and H+ co-insertion/extraction mechanism. 
For ZIBs, some tunnel- and layer-type cathode materials may also be capable of accommodating additional ions from the electrolyte apart from Zn2+ to provide extra capacity. In 2017, Wang's group first demonstrated the consequent H+ and Zn2+ insertion/extraction mechanism in Zn/MnO2 cells by using electroanalytical technology combined with XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization.87 They noticed that the discharging curves have two voltage plateaus (regions I and II) which exhibited a significant difference in kinetics including the different degrees of sensitivity of capacity drop to discharging rates, contributions to the overall capacity, overvoltage, and ion diffusion rate (see Fig. 4a). These results should be ascribed to the different ion insertions in the two regions. The hypothesis is further verified by the electrochemical behaviors of MnO2 in Zn2+-absent electrolyte which only shows one sloped plateau, indicating H+-insertion (see Fig. 4b). Meanwhile, the flat plateau in region II disappears, which proves that region II is mainly attributed to Zn2+-insertion. The consecutive appearance of the MnOOH phase in region I and the ZnMn2O4 phase in region II from XRD results (see Fig. 4c) further proves the initial H+ insertion followed by Zn2+ insertion into MnO2 during the discharging process.

Besides MnO2, insertion/extraction of H+ together with Zn2+ has also been demonstrated in various V-based materials.88 For example, Chen et al. reported a Zn/NaV3O8·1.5H2O battery.89 XRD and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) characterization showed the gradual appearance/disappearance of the Zn4SO4(OH)6·4H2O phase on the cathode during the discharging/charging process (Fig. 4d–f). The OH− in Zn4SO4(OH)6·4H2O is from the decomposition of water in electrolytes. To reach a neutral charge system, the remaining H+ will move into the cathode to balance its rich electron during the discharging process. The insertion of H+ was proven by the extra peak at 2.7 ppm in the solid-state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (Fig. 4g) which should be attributed to the inserted H+ instead of H+ from OH− or H2O from Zn4SO4(OH)6·4H2O located at 1.5 ppm. This peak becomes gradually stronger during the discharging process and gradually disappears during the charging process. The additional XPS results in Fig. 4h–i demonstrate the continuous and reversible insertion/extraction of Zn2+ in the Zn/NaV3O8·1.5H2O battery system during cycling. Such one-step simultaneous H+/Zn2+ co-insertion behavior is different from the two-step H+/Zn2+ insertion chemistry described above in MnO2.


3.1.3. Zn2+ insertion/extraction and anion release/interaction mechanism. 
Besides the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ and/or H+ into/out of the cathode materials, researchers have found that anions from the Zn salts can also interact with certain cathode materials. For example, Niu's group reported a Zn/polyaniline (PANI) battery using Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte.31 PANI has conjugated chemical bonds (CN) and a long-range conjugated structure. Cations can be stored in the electronegative N sites (C–N−) during the discharging process, while the anions can interact with the positively charged N atoms (C–N+) during the charging process.90 The ex situ XPS patterns (Fig. 5a and c) at different charged states in Fig. 5b show gradually stronger Zn peaks (states c to f) during the discharging process which indicates the continuous insertion of Zn2+, and gradually weaker Zn peaks (states f to i) during the charging process which should be ascribed to the extraction of Zn2+ from the PANI cathode. Interestingly, they also noticed a reverse peak intensity variation for F element originating from CF3SO3− groups in the electrolyte throughout the discharging/charging processes. Based on the above findings, they proposed the following energy storage mechanism as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5d and e. During the discharging process, the fully oxidized PANI cathode is reduced to half-oxidized PANI, accompanied by the release of CF3SO3−. With the further reduction of half-oxidized PANI to fully reduced PANI, CF3SO3− is continuously released and Zn2+ interacts with the PANI concurrently. Meanwhile, the Zn anode is reduced to Zn2+ to compensate for the consumption of Zn2+ in the electrolyte. During the charging process, a reverse process occurs.

3.1.4. Conversion reaction mechanism. 
As mentioned above, the energy storage mechanism of ZIBs is controversial and under debate. In addition to the reversible insertion/extraction mechanism, a reversible conversion reaction chemistry has also been demonstrated in Zn/α-MnO2 cells by Liu's group.91 Based on TEM, scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) elemental mapping, and XRD results, they identified ZnSO4[Zn(OH)2]3·xH2O and MnOOH phases as discharging products on the cathode instead of ZnxMnO2 or ZnMn2O4, the typical product of Zn2+-inserted α-MnO2. Accordingly, they proposed the following reaction chemistry: upon discharging, α-MnO2 reacts with protons from water to form MnOOH nanorods and nanoparticle aggregates. Meanwhile, the remaining OH− groups react with ZnSO4 and H2O to form ZnSO4[Zn(OH)2]3·xH2O to reach a charge balance in the electrolyte. Interestingly, at the fully charged state, even though the above nanorods and nanoparticle aggregates retain their morphology, their lattice distance reverts to the same value of as that of the parent α-MnO2, indicating a reversible discharging/charging behavior between α-MnO2 and MnOOH/ZnSO4[Zn(OH)2]3·xH2O.    

3.2 Rechargeable alkaline Zn batteries
Apart from ZIBs, various rechargeable alkaline Zn batteries including Zn–Ni, Zn–Co, and Zn–Ag batteries, among others stand out as other important members of the Zn-based electrochemical energy storage device family. In general, rechargeable alkaline Zn batteries are composed of a Zn metal anode, a transition metal-based cathode (e.g., Ni(OH)2, Co3O4, or NiCoO2), and aqueous alkaline electrolytes (e.g., KOH solution). Aqueous alkaline electrolytes endow a more negative electrode potential (−1.26 V vs. SHE) compared to that of ZIBs (−0.76 V vs. SHE). Thus, rechargeable alkaline Zn batteries deliver higher operation voltage (∼1.7–1.8 V).10,92 Unlike ZIBs which have recently emerged, the energy storage mechanisms of many rechargeable alkaline Zn batteries are widely acknowledged. The anode side of all rechargeable alkaline Zn batteries has the same Zn deposition and dissolution chemistry during cycling as follows:  
During the discharging process, the Zn metal anode gradually dissolves and reacts with OH− to form Zn(OH)42−. And ZnO precipitates out when the concentration of Zn(OH)42− approaches saturation value. Upon charging, Zn(OH)42− accepts ions to be reduced to Zn which is deposited on the anode surface.92–94

3.2.1. Zn–Ni batteries. 
The rechargeable Zn–Ni battery system has been known for over 100 years.95 Zn–Ni batteries can deliver a high working voltage window of ∼1.8 V and a theoretical energy density of 340 W h Kg−1.96 For typical Zn–Ni batteries using Ni(OH)2 as a cathode material, the reaction mechanism on the cathode can be described as follows:  where Ni(OH)2 loses electrons and reacts with an OH− to generate NiOOH and H2O during the charging process, and a reverse reaction occurs during the discharging process.96,97


3.2.2. Zn–Co batteries. 
Co3O4 is regarded as another promising cathode material for rechargeable alkaline Zn batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (446 mA h g−1) and good redox reaction reversibility.98–100 For Zn–Co batteries typically using Co3O4 as a cathode material, the energy storage mechanism on the cathode side involves two steps:  where Co3O4 transforms into CoOOH and further into CoO2 during the charging process, and the reverse reactions occur upon discharging.
Even though Co3O4 delivers high capacity, its poor electrical conductivity dramatically limits its electrochemical performance, especially at a high rate. Previous studies have demonstrated that partial substitution of Ni for Co atoms in the Co3O4 lattice can significantly enhance the electrical conductivity from 3.1 × 10−5 to 0.1–0.3 S cm−1.101 Based on this, several Zn–NiCo2O4 batteries have been reported which have the following reaction mechanism on the cathode side during cycling:  
During the charging process, NiCo2O4 reacts with OH− to form NiOOH and CoOOH, in which CoOOH can subsequently combine with another OH− to produce CoO2. Upon discharging, CoO2 and NiOOH are reduced back to NiCo2O4.102,103


3.2.3. Zn–Ag batteries. 
Zn–Ag is a mature electrochemical energy storage system that delivers high operating voltage up to 1.85 V and a high power density.104,105 For Zn–Ag batteries using AgO as a cathode material, the reversible reactions involve two steps:  
During the charging process, Ag is first oxidized to Ag2O and then to AgO. During the discharging process, AgO is consecutively reduced to Ag2O and Ag upon discharging.94,106,107

3.3. Zn–air batteries
Zn–air batteries are becoming particularly attractive in both fundamental and industrial fields on account of their high specific energy density and low cost compared to other ESDs, in particular, Li-ion batteries.8,108–111 Zn–air batteries consist of a zinc metal anode and an air cathode with bifunctional oxygen evolution and reduction catalytic activity, together assembled with alkaline electrolytes. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the zinc anode has the same reaction chemistry as that in alkaline Zn batteries as described above:  
 Fig. 6  Schematic principle of a Zn–air battery. Reproduced with permission.109 Copyright 2014 Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). 
Meanwhile, on the air cathode, O2 from the air is reduced to OH− upon discharging and a reverse reaction occurs during the charging process.112,113  
3.4. Zn-ion capacitors
A common electrochemical Zn-ion capacitor is a hybrid electrochemical device that consists of a Zn metal anode and porous carbon as the cathode. The porous carbon cathode stores charge mainly by electrical double-layer capacitance, enabling ultralong cycle life and excellent power density. The Zn anode undergoes reversible Zn plating/stripping during cycling. The reaction is the same as that in ZIBs which gives rise to large capacity.44,45,114 Due to the hybrid charge storage mechanism, ZICs are regarded as electrochemical devices that can bridge the gap between supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries.

4.1.1. Zn–Mn batteries. 
Pioneering work on 1DZIBs was carried out by Zhi's group in 2018.40 They applied a roll-dip-coating and roll-electrodeposition strategy to coat MnO2 and Zn metal on double-helix CNT yarn substrates, yielding a CNT@MnO2 yarn anode and CNT@Zn cathode, respectively (Fig. 7a). Subsequently, the two yarn electrodes were wound onto an elastic fiber in parallel, followed by coating cross-linked PAM/ZnSO4 + MnSO4 quasi-solid-state electrolyte on and between the two electrodes (Fig. 2a and b). The MnO2 cathode usually suffers from significant capacity fading due to the dissolution of Mn2+via the disproportionation of Mn3+ during the cycling process. Pre-adding Mn2+ in the electrolyte is one well-accepted strategy to suppress the dissolution of Mn2+ and stabilize MnO2.86 The assembled yarn ZIB yields a high specific capacity of 302.1 mA h g−1 (Fig. 7d) and a volumetric energy density of 53.8 mW h cm−3, as well as remarkable cycling stability (98.5% capacity retention after 500 cycles, see Fig. 7e). To endow the yarn battery with waterproof function, the entire device was further encapsulated with Eco-flex silicon with water repellent properties (Fig. 7g). The helix device structure, as well as the good stretchability of both the PAM electrolyte (Fig. 7b) and Eco-flex silicon coating layer, imparts remarkable stretchability to the yarn battery (Fig. 7f). Several yarn batteries were connected in series to power wearable electronics, indicating their vast potential for practical application (Fig. 7h). Plus, sluggish Zn2+ diffusion within MnO2 is another critical issue that significantly limits the rate performance of the assembled ZIBs. Concerning this, Cao et al. reported that limitedly reducing MnO2 to mixed valent manganese oxide (MnOx) can create multiple vacancy defects which could serve as efficient migration paths to improve the ion diffusion kinetics.115 The synthesized MnOx cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 450 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and retains a decent capacity of 158.3 mA h g−1 at 5C. Based on this, they assembled a coaxial fiber ZIB by layer-by-layer integration of a PAM gel electrolyte, separator, SS current collector, and MnOx cathode on a piece of Zn wire, and finally sealing them in a heat-shrinkable tube. The fiber battery yielded a reversible capacity of 255.8 mA h g−1 and capacity retention of 80% after 1000 bending deformations. Furthermore, poor electrical conductivity and structure instability during cycling also hinder the performance of Zn/MnO2 cells. In this regard, Zhi's groups also demonstrated that coating with a conductive polymer, i.e., polypyrrole (PPy), on MnO2 increases both the conductivity and cycling stability of MnO2 by serving as the mechanical buffer layer (Fig. 7i–k).80 Interestingly, they used Nitinol wire as the core substrate, achieving a distinct shape memory function (Fig. 7l). Researchers have also endowed 1D Zn/MnO2 batteries with other functions. For example, by secondary twisting of a fiber electrode consisting of an elastomeric core fiber and an active material sheath, Choi demonstrated a supercoil battery with an excellent stretchability of 800% and a linear capacity of 0.028 mA h cm−1.116 Kong's group used polyglycolic acid fibers as a substrate and gelatin-silk protein as electrolytes which makes the entire device biodegradable.82 Mn-based cathode materials usually suffer from structural instability during cycling which leads to a short cycle life. When 1DZIBs are knitted or woven into textiles, it is difficult to replace them. Thus, a long lifespan is urgently required for 1DZIBs, and more strategies should be proposed to stabilize Mn-based cathodes.

4.1.2. Zn–V batteries. 
Compared to Mn-based materials, V-based materials have three key advantages including specific capacity, cycling stability, and diversity. Yao's group demonstrated a high-performance fiber cathode by directly growing ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets on a highly conductive 3D N-doped porous CNT fiber (CNTF) host.117 The 3D fiber host was fabricated by first growing Co-based metal–organic framework (MOF) nanowall arrays on CNTFs, which were subsequently transformed into a porous N-doped carbon skeleton (NC) via heat treatments in an inert gas (Fig. 8a). The 3D highly conductive construction is beneficial for large mass loading of active materials, efficient electron transfer, and ion diffusion. Then a quasi-solid-state 1DZIB was obtained by twisting a CNTF@NC@V2O5 cathode with a CNTF@Zn anode separated by PVA/ZnCl2 gel electrolyte (Fig. 8b). The resultant device yields a remarkable volumetric capacity of 457.5 mA h cm−3 at a current density of 0.3 A cm−3 (see Fig. 8c) and retains 47.5% of its initial capacity at an ultrahigh current density of 30.0 A cm−3, a high energy density of 40.8 mW h cm−3, and a power density of 5.6 W cm−3. Moreover, 1DZIBs with self-powering functionality are desired to extend battery life. To this end, Peng et al. presented a novel 1DZIB with additional air-recharging capability.118 The air-recharging capability of the device is achieved by using a V6O13/aligned CNT cathode, which can induce a spontaneous redox reaction with ambient air at its discharged state (Fig. 8d) for capacity recovery (Fig. 8e). The fully discharged product on the cathode, i.e., Zn3.49V6O13, could recover to its charged state (oxidized by O2 with the release of Zn2+) without any external power supply. In particular, a double-layer tubular encapsulation was customized for the air-rechargeable battery, of which the removable outer layer insulates O2 while the inner layer is O2-permeable (Fig. 8f). The removal of the outer layer will trigger spontaneous recovery reactions. The resultant 1DZIB shows a high specific capacity (371 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1) and stable cyclability (91% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1), and can be efficiently recharged to ∼60% upon exposure to air. In addition, an energy storage unit was successfully fabricated by connecting two devices in series, and the resultant unit could power a thermometer (Fig. 8g). After the energy storage unit ran out of power, it was unsealed in ambient air for several hours and then it could be recharged to repower the thermometer (see Fig. 8h). Better yet, the 1DZIB shows impressive performance stability under various shape deformation and all-weather conditions, demonstrating its great application potential in practical scenarios (Fig. 8i). However, it should be noted that the Zn anode cannot be recovered during this process, and thus the air-powering functionality could only serve as a backup power supply. Despite the high capacity and stability of V-based cathodes, their narrow voltage window dramatically decreases the output energy density of the assembled 1DZIBs.

4.1.3. Zn–PBA batteries. 
PBAs can be roughly represented as AxMAy[MB(CN)6]z·nH2O, where MA and MB are usually Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, or Zn, and A is usually Li, Na, or K. PBAs possess open-framework structures with large interstitial sites which enable fast charging/discharging and large operational voltage windows. Plus, they undergo minimal change to their geometry during ion insertion, which enables a long cycle life.119 Thus, PBAs have attracted much attention as Zn2+ hosts for ZIBs. For example, in 2019, Wei et al. demonstrated a high-voltage coaxial-fiber ZIB by adopting Zn nanosheet arrays (NSAs) on CNTFs as the core electrode and a zinc hexacyanoferrate (Zn2[Fe(CN)6], hereafter denoted as ZnHCF) composite on aligned CNT sheets (ACNTSs) as the outer electrode with CMC/ZnSO4 as the gel electrolyte (Fig. 9a–c).78 The obtained fiber battery possesses a large voltage window of 1.0–2.1 V, a large capacity of 100.2 mA h cm−3 (Fig. 9d), and a high energy density of 195.39 mW h cm−3. In addition, this device also delivers excellent flexibility with capacity retention of 93.2% after bending for 3000 cycles (Fig. 9e). Two devices were woven into a flexible textile in series which can light a blue LED, demonstrating its favorable weavability (Fig. 9f). However, it should be noted that the reported zinc hexacyanoferrate composite only delivers a capacity of 94.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, far smaller than those of Mn- and V-based cathode materials. This is a common drawback of most metal hexacyanoferrates resulting from the fact that only a single transition metal ion, that is, Fe ions in most cases, is believed to be electrochemically activated under aqueous electrolyte systems.120 Providing additional active metal ions is likely the most straightforward way to improve the capacity. In this regard, Zhi's group reported a new kind of PBA, namely, cobalt hexacyanoferrate (Co[Fe(CN)6]), for the fabrication of 1DZIBs. The cobalt hexacyanoferrate offers two active couples of Co(III)/Co(II) and Fe(III)/Fe(II) (Fig. 9g), resulting in a significantly enhanced capacity of 173.4 mA h g−1 at 0.3 A g−1 (Fig. 9h).120 Compared to Mn- and V-based cathode materials, the intrinsic capacity of PBAs is much lower, and it is urgent to explore strategies to increase the capacity of PBA-based cathode materials.

4.1.4. Zn-polymer batteries. 
For fiber-shaped devices, electrons are often required to travel a long distance along the axial direction to reach external circuits. In contrast, electrons only need to pass through the thickness direction of electrode materials on current collectors in conventional planar devices, which are usually several orders smaller, ranging from several nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. Therefore, the cathode materials for 1D devices are particularly required to have high electrical conductivity. However, the electrical conductivity of most Mn-, V- and PBA-based materials is far from satisfactory. In contrast, conductive polymers with long chains and π-conjugated structures have attracted great research interest because of their high electrical conductivity and redox reversibility. In addition, their inherent elasticity and flexibility are a good fit for flexible devices. In 2018, Niu's group firstly demonstrated the possibility of using PANI as a cathode material in 1DZIBs.31 In 2020, Yuan's group reported a similar coaxial-like integrated 1DZIB, which consists of a Zn@CF anode core, PAM hydrogel electrolyte, and an in situ grown PANI cathode layer (Fig. 10a).75 The 1DZIB achieves a high length capacity of 0.18 mA h cm−1 at 0.1 mA cm−1, and retains 0.102 mA h cm−1 at 1 mA cm−1 (Fig. 10c), suggesting its good rate performance. Better yet, the PAM-based electrolyte containing a high concentration of Zn salt has anti-freezing properties which ensure that the assembled device works at sub-zero temperatures (Fig. 10b). In addition to increasing the concentration of Zn salt, Pu's group showed that the addition of ethylene glycol in PVA/ZnCl2 + NH4Cl electrolyte can also extend the lower limit of working temperature to −20 °C.81 To further enhance the performance of the Zn/PANI battery system, Lee's group developed oxygen-containing group-rich CF substrates via oxygen plasma treatment (Fig. 10d).49 These groups can serve as stable anchoring sites bonding with electrodeposited aniline via N–O and N–H bonds and π–π stacking. The fiber substrate engineering not only increases the mass loading of PANI but also improves the adhesion between PANI and CFs. The resultant quasi-solid-state 1DZIB delivers a good capacity retention of 95.4% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and a discharging capacity of 83.96 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 2 A g−1 (Fig. 10e). Besides modification of the fiber substrates, this group also demonstrated that optimizing electrolyte recipes can also improve the performance of the Zn/PANI battery systems. They proposed that the addition of methanesulfonic acid in PVA-based gel electrolytes is beneficial to forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds to connect PVA chains and link the PANI surface with the electrolyte as well (Fig. 10f).48 These linkages not only increase the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte but also facilitate charge transfer at the PANI/electrolyte interface. Better yet, methanesulfonic acid with a relatively large size can prevent water molecules from coming into contact with PANI and Zn which inhibits PANI degradation and Zn corrosion. It results in excellent long-term cycling performance, as evidenced by the 88.1% capacity retention after 2000 cycles.

4.2. Rechargeable alkaline Zn batteries

4.2.1. Zn–Ni batteries. 
In 2018, Sun et al. demonstrated a fiber-shaped Zn/Ni(OH)2 battery. Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were grown on Ni wire as a cathode, and a Zn wire anode was wound around the fiber cathode.126 The two electrodes were sandwiched by a separator and PVA/KOH was used as the gel electrolyte (Fig. 11a). The whole device was finally sealed in heat-shrinkable tubes. The assembled 1DZAB exhibits a specific capacity of 704 μA h cm−3 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, and a good rate capability of 75% when the current density increases by 10-fold from 0.5 to 5 A g−1. Also, the capacity of the device only decreases by 7% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1, indicating its remarkable cycling stability. In addition to Ni(OH)2, NiO has also been used to fabricate fiber-shaped Zn–Ni batteries. Because of its relatively smaller molecular weight, NiO delivers a higher theoretical capacity than Ni(OH)2.92 Yet, the poor electrical conductivity still limits its performance. Lu et al. addressed this issue by introducing metallic Ni into NiO (Fig. 11c and d) which can simultaneously enhance the conductivity and reactivity.30 Based on the Ni–NiO heterostructured nanosheets, they assembled a fiber-shaped Zn–Ni battery with a similar device configuration to that of the above Zn/Ni(OH)2 battery (Fig. 11e and f). The device is ultra-stable and shows almost 100% capacity retention after 10000 cycles at 22.2 A g−1 (Fig. 11g). Ni-MOF nanosheets (Fig. 11h and i) with inherent conductivity were also applied as a cathode for fiber-shaped Zn–Ni batteries by Yao's group.127 The Ni-MOF has an electrical conductivity of 1 ± 0.2 × 10−4 S m−1, several orders of magnitude higher than that of pure Ni(OH)2 and NiO.128 The assembled fiber-shaped Zn–Ni battery yields a capacity of 0.4 mA h cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2 and preserves 79% of its initial capacity when the current density increases by 10 fold in an aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 11j).

4.2.2. Zn–Co batteries. 
In 2018, Lu et al. reported a fiber-shaped Zn/Co3O4 battery using Co3O4 nanowire arrays grown on Ni wire as a fiber cathode and 3D flake-like Zn grown on N, O-functionalized CF as the anode. The two electrodes were eventually sealed in heat-shrinkable tubes filled with liquid electrolytes (Fig. 12a).129 The nanosheet morphology of Co3O4 is beneficial to the fast electrochemical reaction kinetics, while the strong binding of Zn2+ with N and O surficial zincophilic functional sites induces uniform Zn deposition behaviors which can extend the cycle life. The fiber-shaped full battery demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a capacity of 21.3 mA h cm−3 at 0.25 A cm−3, retaining 16.6 mA h cm−3 at 2.5 A cm−3 (Fig. 12b), a high volumetric energy density of 5.63 mW h cm−3, an areal energy density of 72.5 μW h cm−2, and capacity retention of 90% after 2000 cycles. As discussed above, the existence of Ni in Co-based oxides/hydroxides can enhance the electrical conductivity which is good for rate performance. Zhi's group developed a Zn/Ni Co hydroxide (NCHO) battery, in which Zn and NCHO nanosheets were electrodeposited on scalably produced highly conductive SS yarns as an anode and cathode, respectively (Fig. 12c).130 And PVA/KOH + Zn(CH3COO)2 gel was used as the electrolyte. The yarn battery delivers a specific capacity of 5 mA h cm−3 (Fig. 12d), energy densities of 0.12 mW h cm−2 or 8 mW h cm−3, and power densities of 32.8 mW cm−2 or 2.2 W cm−3. The device also exhibits remarkable rate performance. Mai's group also adopted a 3D architecture strategy to fabricate both an anode and cathode for fiber-shaped Zn–Co batteries (Fig. 12e).131 Branch-like Co(CO3)0.5(OH)x·0.11H2O@CoMoO4 grown on carbon cloth (CC–CCH@CMO) was used as the fiber cathode. While the 3D CC-ZnO@C–Zn anode was prepared by in situ growing zeolitic-imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8)-derived ZnO@C core–shell nanorods on CC as the skeleton followed by Zn deposition. The unique 3D skeleton provides large nucleation sites for Zn deposition and also facilitates uniform Zn deposition. The fiber battery achieved a capacity of 3 mA h cm−3, an energy density of 4.6 mW h cm−3, and a power density of 0.42 W cm−3, together with good durability as indicated by the 82% capacity retention after 1600 cycles (see Fig. 12f and g).

4.2.3. Zn–Ag batteries. 
In 2016, Arias et al. reported the first flexible wire Zn–Ag battery with a coaxial architecture, which consists of a Zn deposited metal wire core, a PVA/KOH electrolyte layer, a thin cellophane film layer (reducing migration of silver ions toward the zinc electrode), and the outermost silver electrode layer fabricated by dip-coating silver on SS thread (Fig. 13a).29 The wire battery has a length capacity of 1.2–1.8 mA h cm−1 at a 0.5C discharging rate, and volumetric and gravimetric energy densities of 53.4 W h L−1 and 18.35 W h kg−1, respectively. Three wire batteries were connected in series to power a LED screen, suggesting its great practical application potential (Fig. 13b). However, the cycle life of the device is only 170 cycles. In 2019, Yao et al. also constructed a fiber-shaped Zn–Ag battery.132 For fabrication of a fiber cathode, a MOF was firstly grown on CNTFs, in which the MOF was subsequently transformed into N-doped carbon nanosheet arrays on CNTFs, yielding 3D fiber substrates (CNTF-NCA) which is beneficial to fast ion/electron transfer, and large mass loading of active materials. Afterward, Ag2O was grown on the surface of CNTF-NCA followed by coating a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layer (Fig. 13c). The PEDOT:PSS layer serves as a protective layer to suppress structural pulverization and alleviate the migration of Ag ions. While the anode was prepared by electrodeposited Zn on CNTFs, and PVA/KOH gel was used as the electrolyte. The assembled fiber-shaped Zn–Ag battery (Fig. 13d) delivers a maximum energy density of 1.57 mW h cm−2 and a peak power density of 14.4 mW cm−2, with 75.2% capacity retention from 0.5 to 5 mA cm−2, and retains 79.5% of its initial capacity after 200 cycles (Fig. 13e and f). Besides constructing 3D fiber substrates to host large amounts of active materials, Kim et al. reported a bi-scrolling strategy to increase the mass loading of Ag up to 99 wt%.133 The fiber anode and cathode were fabricated by twisting Ag nanowire loaded CNT sheets and Zn nanoparticle loaded CNT sheets into yarns. Thanks to the high mass loading, the device yields a high linear capacity of 0.276 mA h cm−1 in the gel electrolyte. However, the fiber battery can only retain 30–40% of its initial capacity after 50 cycles. The obvious performance degradation within limited cycles of fiber-shaped Zn–Ag batteries was likely caused by the migration of Ag ions, the high solubility of zinc in alkaline electrolyte, and dendritic growth of zinc oxide on the surface of the electrodes.92 Therefore, related strategies are urgently required to extend the cycle life of fiber-shaped Zn–Ag batteries for practical application. The details and performance of various 1DAZBs are summarized in Table 4.

4.3. Zn–air batteries
In 2014, Cho et al. reported the first cable Zn–air battery with a spiral Zn anode and economical Fe/N/C-based air cathode separated by PVA + PEO/KOH gel electrolyte.27 The whole device was further packed with a heat-shrinkable rubber cable with holes on the surface to allow the air to pass through (Fig. 14a). The cable Zn–air battery exhibits a stable voltage plateau of 0.92 V for 9 h discharging duration (Fig. 14b), and excellent performance stability under various shape deformation conditions (Fig. 14c). However, the air cathode only contains ORR catalysts, so the prototype cannot be recharged. Later in 2015, Peng's group demonstrated the first flexible, stretchable, fiber-shaped, rechargeable Zn–air battery, in which the air anode consists of aligned and cross-stacked CNT sheets for the ORR and a RuO2-based catalyst for the OER.28 A zinc spring serves as the anode and PVA + PEO/KOH as gel electrolyte (Fig. 14d). During the discharging process, O2 is reduced to OH− at the CNT sheets, and a reverse reaction occurs at the RuO2-based catalyst layer during the charging process. The porous CNT layer not only works as the current collector but also acts as a gas diffusion layer to allow O2 to pass through. Indeed, the author also studied several fundamental parameters of the air anode that influence the performance of the 1DZABs, including the layer number of CNT sheets, and the contact angle between adjacent CNT sheets, and the aligned structure of the CNTs. The assembled 1DZIB delivers a capacity of ∼120 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. In 2018, Lu's group presented a flexible 1DZAB employing mesoporous atomically thin Co3O4 layers in situ coupled with N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) nanosheets as an OER and ORR bifunctional catalyst, showing both high activity and superior durability.36 The device shows a steady discharging potential of 1.2 V and no obvious increase in the potential gap within 75 cycles for 25 h, indicating its excellent rechargeability and stability. Most importantly, the authors successfully knitted the 1DZABs into a textile for powering wearable electronics. This is a big step towards the practical application of 1DZABs. Since then, various bifunctional catalysts have been used to construct 1DZABs, like NiFeMn trimetallic nitride stabilized by Ti metal on titanium carbide (Ti3C2) sheets38 and hybrid cobalt/cobalt nitride nanoparticles integrated with nitrogen-doped carbon nanoarrays (NC–Co/CoNx).37

Despite the high theoretical capacity of Zn–air batteries, the low operating voltage window plagues their development. In contrast, Zn-ion/alkaline Zn batteries have higher operating potential but inferior capacity. In this regard, Deng et al. demonstrated a novel type of fiber-shaped hybrid Zn-based battery by integrating Zn–air and Zn-alkaline batteries, achieving both high potential and large capacity, power, and energy density simultaneously (Fig. 14e).39 The faradaic redox reaction of Co–O ↔ Co–O–H and reversible ORR/OER reaction take place in one cell. This is achieved by using a novel lotus root-like nanofiber cathode composed of Co3O4−x bubbles with engineered defects (oxygen vacancy) which show superior OER/ORR catalytic activity as well. Also, the electrolyte is a sodium polyacrylate hydrogel containing 6 M KOH and 0.2 M Zn(Ac)2. Even after long-term cycling at a high rate, it still retains the well-defined two sets of charging/discharging profiles and high energy efficiency. The hybrid device yields a high capacity of 805.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 3 mA cm−2, and an outstanding energy density of 961 W h kg−1. Despite the great achievements in terms of capacity and energy density, the electrochemical performance of 1DZABs is still far from their theoretical value. And the cycling performance of 1DZABs is too poor to satisfy practical applications. Plus, the complex multiple layers cause the large diameter of current 1DZABs, leading to a significant loss of flexibility.
4.4. Zn-ion capacitors
In 2019, Chen's group demonstrated the first 1DZIC by using two types of rationally designed fiber electrode and a novel hydrogel electrolyte.32 The cathode was graphene/CNT composite fibers that were assembled via a space-confined hydrothermal approach (Fig. 15a). For ZICs, the cathode materials are expected to have a large surface area and abundant actives sites to match the high capacity of Zn metal. In the graphene/CNT composite fibers, CNTs serve as spacers to prevent the re-stacking of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, which enables rGO sheets to provide a large surface (265 m2 g−1). The anode is fabricated by plating a uniform layer of Zn metal on commercial CFs (Fig. 15a), providing a uniformly distributed electric field which can smooth Zn deposition and thus inhibit Zn dendrite growth. A neutral ZnSO4-filled PAA hydrogel acts as the quasi-solid-state electrolyte, which has a high ionic conductivity of 21.7 mS cm−1, enabling better long-term cycling stability compared to PVA-based electrolytes (Fig. 15b and c). The assembled fiber ZICs deliver a high volumetric capacitance of 104.5 F cm−3 at a current density of 400 mA cm−3 and a high energy density of 48.5 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 179.9 mW cm−3. It should be emphasized that the 1DZIC exhibits remarkable cycling stability with 98% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles, outperforming most other 1DZESDs. Plus, multiple integrated 1DZIC energy storage units can light a digital LED, highlighting the enormous potential of the 1DZIC for various practical electronic applications (Fig. 15d). Huang's group also applied a graphene/CNT composite fiber as a cathode for the fabrication of 1DZICs.135 In their case, PVA/Zn(CF3SO3)2 gel electrolytes endow the device with self-healing capacity. The device can preserve 75% of its initial capacity even after 5 cutting/healing cycles, which significantly enhances its adaption to harsh environments. The details and performance of various 1DZABs and 1DZICs are summarized in Table 5. Indeed, besides carbon-based materials, other capacitive materials such as MXene, RuO2 and conductive polymers, and various pseudocapacitive materials have been demonstrated to have excellent performance when being applied in traditional ZICs.45 It is expected that with the increasing richness of the pool of materials, the electrochemical performance of 1DZICs can be further improved to meet practical requirements.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
In this review, we provide an overview of the recent development of 1DZESDs, including 1DZIBs, 1DAZBs, 1DZABs, and 1DZICs. We first present a brief history of the progress of 1DZESDs. Then we introduced the general device design basis for 1DZESDs, including general device configurations, 1D substrates, and gel electrolytes. Afterward, we discuss the fundamental chemistry of different 1DZESD systems. Finally, representative 1DZESDs are described. Their electrochemical performance, mechanical properties, and additional functions are highlighted accordingly. Despite the fast progress in the last few years, the development of 1DZESDs still faces several key challenges.
5.1. Cathode materials
In general, desired cathode materials for 1DZESDs are required to have (1) an excellent reversible energy storage capacity and a suitable operating voltage window to enable high energy storage density, (2) a high electron/ion transport mobility to deliver high power density and (3) excellent structural stability upon phase transformations during faradaic reactions over many charging/discharging cycles to enable a long battery life. However, most of the cathode materials cannot simultaneously meet these criteria. Taking the cathode materials of ZIBs as examples, Mn-based materials usually suffer from structural instability during cycling which leads to a short cycle life, while the narrow voltage window of V-based materials and low capacity of PBA-based materials cause low energy density.17,18 For alkaline Zn–Ag batteries, restricted by the OER, a cut-off voltage of ∼1.8 V is generally applied, under which Ag can only be oxidized to Ag2O, which limits further utilization of AgO.92 Therefore, more studies should be carried out to improve the performance of existing cathode materials such as hybridization with carbon-based and/or polymer-based materials, nanosizing materials, constructing hierarchical structures, creating defects, or doping ions. At the same time, new cathode materials should be further explored. Furthermore, the cost of cathode materials is also a critical factor that should be considered. For example, even though various conductive polymers (e.g., PANI and PPy) exhibit good Zn2+ accommodation properties, the high price limits their practical application.
5.2. Gel electrolytes
Gel electrolytes are preferred for fabricating flexible 1D devices to meet the flexibility and safety requirements in practical usage. However, the ionic conductivity of most gel electrolytes is still low, thus resulting in low rate performance and power density. As discussed above, adding certain additives in the electrolyte, and selection of appropriate Zn salts as well as polymer matrix can enhance the ionic conductivity of gel electrolytes by 2–3 times; however, the achieved conductivity remains much inferior to that of liquid electrolytes. In addition, excellent flexibility and stretchability are desired properties for gel electrolytes to fabricate flexible devices. The recently reported hydrogel electrolytes with physical/chemical cross-linking bonds are a potential solution, which show improved ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, and flexibility. Furthermore, most of the 1DZESDs suffer from low operating voltage, generally lower than 1.8 V, which should be ascribed to the narrow working window of aqueous electrolytes to prevent water splitting.65,67,136 Recently, increasing the Zn-salt concentration to obtain “water-in-salt” electrolyte, or adding an electrolyte additive has been demonstrated to effectively extend the operating voltage window of Zn-based electrochemical energy storage devices.137–139 Thus, increasing the concentration of Zn salt or adding an additive in the gel electrolyte may be a promising direction to extend the operating voltage window. Plus, raw materials for preparing gel electrolytes should be cost-effective, otherwise the economic benefits of Zn-based batteries will be erased. Overall, ideal gel electrolytes should simultaneously have high ionic conductivity, mechanical tolerance, wide operating voltage window, and low cost for practical application.
5.3. Zn anode protection
The side reactions and dendrite growth on the Zn anode lead to a short cycle life, low coulombic efficiency, and capacity fading, dramatically limiting the practical application of Zn-based batteries.140–142 Worse yet, the curved and complex surface structure of the 1D Zn anode leads to local enhancement of the electric field, making the dendrite growth even worse. Even though the utilization of gel electrolyte can mitigate these issues to a certain extent, there still exist many free water molecules in gel electrolytes which can decompose and participate in Zn passivation reactions.67 Several strategies have been reported to inhibit side reactions and Zn dendrite growth, such as building 3D Zn networks with abundant nucleation sites, constructing artificial solid electrolyte interfaces, and regulating the electrolyte formula using additives.141–143 Technically, modulating electrolytes is the most practical and economical approach to stabilize the 1D Zn anode. Anti-side reaction and -dendrite strategies have rarely been reported for 1D devices, probably due to the difficulty arising from their geometrical complexity. This calls for suitable Zn protection strategies to enhance the cycle life and energy storage performance of 1D devices.
5.4. Diameter of the device
The bending strain of materials is in proportion to their thickness. Materials become bendable when their thickness is small. However, some of the reported 1DZESDs especially those with a core–sheath configuration have large thickness due to the integration of multiple layers. This causes their bendability to deteriorate significantly, which limits their application in powering flexible electronics, not to mention the capability of being woven or knitted into smart textiles. Therefore, the diameter of 1DZESDs should be controlled to enable excellent mechanical flexibility and bendability.
5.5. Fundamental chemistry understanding
Cathode materials that have emerged recently have enabled 1DZESDs to deliver remarkable performance. Nevertheless, there lacks a good understanding of the charge storage mechanisms of many cathode materials. For example, following the above discussion about ZIBs, the Zn2+ storage mechanism in Mn-based materials in ZIBs is still controversial. Therefore, multiple electrochemical approaches, more advanced characterization techniques, and precise computational studies would be required to improve the fundamental chemistry understanding, which would guide us to achieve better engineering designs for cathode materials with improved performance.
5.6. Testing and reporting details and standards
So far, the reported electrochemical performance of 1DZESDs is generally normalized to several metrics, including length, area, volume, or weight. However, the details of the testing routine are often missing in many studies. For example, how to determine the volume of 1D devices with irregular shapes (e.g., twisted structure), and whether the gel electrolyte is counted in the total volume? And which weight is the reported gravimetric performance based on, only the active materials or the whole device? Without detailed information, it is challenging to make a fair comparison across different devices. Thus, it is recommended to provide testing details, including the length, area, volume and weight of both electrodes and title devices, as well as the weight of active materials, etc. Plus, there is also a lack of testing standards for mechanical characteristics. The existing measurements are sometimes too crude, and even arbitrary in evaluating relevant mechanical characteristics; thus, it is difficult to make a fair comparison between various 1DZESDs.
5.7. Safety
Despite the fact that gel electrolytes can prevent the leakage issue that existed in liquid electrolytes to a great extent, some gel electrolytes may not be stable under extreme conditions, such as in a hot, humid environment. To provide additional protection when using 1DZESDS, highly reliable packaging is essential. Most often used encapsulation materials is heat-shrinkable tubes. However, the heat-shrinkable tubes significantly increase the size and weight of 1DZESDs, sacrificing the volumetric/weight performance and thus causing deterioration of the wearing experience. This calls for thin, light but robust packaging materials for 1DZESDs. At the same time, these packing layers can prevent the water loss of gel electrolytes, enabling long device life. In particular, for 1DZABs, the desired packing layer should block the water molecules but be air permeable.
5.8. Achieving scalable manufacture of high-performance devices
The scalable manufacture of 1D devices is pivotal towards their commercialization. So far, most 1DZESDs are manually assembled in research labs. Scalable production of delicately designed devices in a cost-effective manner is complicated, which involves coating activating materials on 1D substrates, pairing the anode and cathode in different configurations, encapsulation of 1D devices, etc. At the same time, scalable production should not be achieved at the cost of electrochemical performance. For example, high mass loading and good electrical connection between active materials and 1D substrates should be enabled. Recently, Peng's group successfully produced meters of high-performance fiber-shaped Li-ion batteries via a scalable industrial process. The fiber devices were further woven into commercial textiles using an industrial rapier loom.144 This is a breakthrough towards the scalable production and commercialization of 1D ESDs. We believe that with the exploration of scalable fabrication methods for 1DZESDs, the application prospects for 1DZESDs and 1DZESD-based smart textiles are extensive.
