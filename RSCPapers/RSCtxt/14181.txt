1. Introduction
Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials possess attractive properties such as high specific surface area, low density, and high loading capacity,1–14 which endow them with potential applications in dye-sensitized solar cells,15–27 lithium ion batteries,28–33 supercapacitors,34–42 catalysis,43–52 drug delivery,53–61 sensors,62–76 water treatment,77–85 nano-reactors,86–91 and fuel cells.92–98 Among these, single- and double-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with various compositions and morphologies have been synthesized by a number of methods, such as hard-templating methods (templating silica, carbon, etc.), soft-templating methods (templating vesicles, emulsions, micelles, etc.) and template free methods (utilizing self-assembly), and are two of the most frequently studied.99–132 Multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with triple or more shells are expected to have better performances over their single- or double-shelled counterparts for applications such as drug delivery with prolonged release time, heterogeneous catalysis, lithium ion batteries, and photocatalysis, although they are not easy to be produced like those with single shell or double shell due to the increased complexity of the structure. Based on combination colloidal templating with shell-by-shell assembly, Caruso et al.133 firstly proposed the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow spheres in 1998. However, a tedious and complex multi-step coating procedure limited the availability of this method. The vesicle templating synthesis of multi-shelled hollow Cu2O spheres with tunable shell numbers of 1–4 shells was first reported by Xu et al. in 2007.134 However, this method suffered from the decrease of shell numbers when extended to other materials due to the unstable structure of vesicle templates and their high sensitivity on reaction environments. Therefore, shell compositions of multi-shelled hollow structures were restricted to a very narrow range in a long time. With the development of new synthetic strategies, such as the sequential templating approach, a rapid development in the field of multi-shelled hollow materials started. Our group firstly reported the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow spheres of metal ferrites (MFe2O4, M = Zn, Co, Ni, Cd) via the sequential templating approach by utilizing carbonaceous microspheres as templates in 2009.135 Furthermore, we have well demonstrated the generality and availability of this approach to a wide range of materials in 2011 and a number of multi-shelled hollow spheres of metal oxides, such as α-Fe2O3, Co3O4, NiO, CuO, and ZnO, has been successfully prepared.70 Following these, multi-shelled hollow materials with various compositions and diverse morphologies have been fabricated. These advances have correspondingly catalyzed investigation on their applications in various areas including dye-sensitized solar cells,26,136–138 lithium ion batteries,31,32,139–142 supercapacitors,39,40,143 sensors,70,144,145 catalysis,45,146,147 and drug delivery.148,149
Several recent articles have reviewed the research progress on hollow micro-/nanostructured materials without special focus on multi-shelled hollow structure.1,4,9 Most recently, two reviews have discussed, rather briefly, the progress in some specific aspects of multi-shelled hollow spheres and their applications in energy conversion and storage, and drug delivery.150,151 The synthetic methodologies and potential applications of multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials have not been reviewed comprehensively in the literature. Alternatively in this review, we make efforts to give a comprehensive overview of the various synthetic strategies for multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials, compositional and geometric manipulation and modification, and their potential applications mainly in the fields of energy conversion and storage, sensors, photocatalysis, and drug delivery.
2. Synthetic methodologies for multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials
Similar to those single-shelled or double-shelled counterparts, multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials could generally be created by three distinct types of synthetic methods: hard templating methods and soft templating methods, which use “rigid” materials and micelles as templates, respectively, as well as template free methods, which allow materials to self-assemble into the desired hollow structures. However, the complexity and difficulty of producing multi-shelled hollow materials are significantly more than those for single-shelled or double-shelled counterparts.
2.1 Hard template methods
Hard templating methods are simple and straightforward in concept and first used in some attempts to produce multi-shelled hollow structures. In those early attempts, the shell-by-shell assembly is usually combined with colloidal templating for creating many shells, which involve sequential coating of precursor materials onto the surface of a hard template as a target shell and another material as an interlayer, repeating the coating procedure to form a core–shell structure composed of multiple shells and the solid template and subsequently removing the interlayers and the template particle, generating a multi-shelled hollow structure (Fig. 1). Huang et al.148 have synthesized triple-shelled hollow silica nanospheres by this shell-by-shell method. Similarly, Wong et al.152 have also synthesized triple-shelled hollow Au@SiO2 nanospheres. However, there are still some great challenges for their availability in a wide range. First, the multi-step coating procedure is generally complex and tedious for low-cost and large-scale production. Second, compatibility between the target material and the template surface as well as uniformity of coating need to be improved, which will significantly affect the structure of the resultant hollow materials. Yang et al.153 reported a chemically induced self-assembly to form multi-shelled SnO2–carbon composite spheres under hydrothermal conditions and obtained triple-shelled hollow SnO2 spheres after calcination (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the mechanism of chemically induced self-assembly and the formation processes of triple-shelled hollow spheres were not well understood. No other multi-shelled hollow spheres were produced through this method in a long period since then.

Our group demonstrated that it is not absolutely necessary for multi-shelled hollow materials to create a core–shell structure composed of multiple shells and the solid template via a tedious multi-step coating procedure or self-assembly and proposed a general and widely usable sequential templating approach to prepare multi-shelled hollow spheres by utilizing carbonaceous microspheres as templates to adsorb metal ions and heating them to remove the template particle and generate hollow structures (Fig. 3).70,135 This approach has been successfully applied to prepare a number of multi-shelled hollow spheres of metal oxides (Fig. 4) such as α-Fe2O3, Co3O4, NiO, CuO, and ZnO, which is distinguished from those above-mentioned methods and does not require the formation of all the target shells before template removal; on the contrary, the formation of target shells is accompanied by the gradual removal of templates. Due to a temperature gradient along the radical direction,119,139 the exterior of carbonaceous microspheres is more easily combusted into gases and then released than the interior when they are heated in air, and their sizes gradually reduce. The concentration of metal ions within the exterior of carbonaceous microspheres correspondingly increases until achieving a certain “threshold” value, during which metal ions are gradually oxidized into metal oxide, forming a relatively rigid shell. Further heating results in the separation between the outer metal oxide shell and the inner template particle. Finally those metal ions in the inner template particle could allow for the creation of more metal oxide shells via a similar templating process. The whole procedure is demonstrated by using triple-shelled α-Fe2O3 hollow spheres as an example (Fig. 5). Apparently, the concentration of metal ions could fastly achieve the “threshold” value if the original concentration is higher. That gives us the opportunity to create multiple target shells with different sizes via a heating process by utilizing the same template and to adjust the geometric structure of multiple-shell hollow spheres through controlling the concentration and radial distribution of metal ions within the carbonaceous template, which could be realized by changing the corresponding experimental parameters, such as metal salt concentration, solvent type, pH value, heating temperature and rate, and atmosphere type. For example, we have demonstrated that the number of shells in most of the hollow metal oxide spheres could be controlled by adjusting the concentration of metal ions, the pH value of metal salt solution or solvent type and also realized the control of both the number of shells and the inter-shell spacing in the case of multi-shelled hollow ZnO spheres by a simple programmable heating process and the control of the shell thickness in the case of multi-shelled hollow α-Fe2O3 spheres by using water, ethanol or their mixed solution as solvent.26,31,32,135,137,142,143 Moreover, there are still some prospects on this sequential templating approach to be notable: (1) the absorbing metal ion step could be also carried out in the preparation of carbonaceous microspheres for simplification, although the additional introduction of metal ions would usually decrease the size uniformity of carbonaceous microspheres and resultant multi-shelled hollow structures; (2) carbonaceous microspheres are not absolutely necessary and allow for the replacement by other template, such as polymer particles with spherical and other shapes; (3) the “sequential templating” approach could be combined with other techniques (such as shell-by-shell assembly and self-assembly) for more complex hollow structures and new functionalities; (4) the “sequential templating” concept could be also extended to the solution system for creating multi-shelled hollow structures. The present “sequential templating” approach represents a milestone in design and synthesis of multi-shelled hollow spheres and their promising applications in different fields, exciting more and more researchers to modify or follow it for creating new complex multi-shelled hollow structures and investigating their unique physical/chemical properties.

Tian et al.154 reported an one-step hydrothermal synthesis of carbonaceous microspheres containing various metal ions by using the corresponding nitrate salts and gluconate acid as raw materials and then obtained a series of multi-shelled hollow spheres (Co3O4, CuO, α-Fe2O3, In2O3, PrO1.83, ZnO) after calcination. Zhou et al.139 directly prepared iron nitrate–sucrose composite microspheres by spray drying and obtained quadruple-shelled hollow α-Fe2O3 spheres after calcination. Park et al.155 also prepared multi-shelled hollow Co3O4 spheres with 4–6 shells by combining spray drying with calcination. Zeng et al.146 prepared triple-shelled hollow TiO2 spheres by using porous polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) spheres as templates. Xi et al.45 also prepared hollow WO3 spheres with up to four shells by using a binary carbonaceous sphere from the polymerization and carbonization of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and glucose. Cho et al.156 reported the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow mixed metal oxide microspheres by using coordination polymer microspheres as the template and the shell composition could be tuned by the cation exchange technique before calcination. Yang et al.40 reported new multi-shelled hollow NiO spheres with hierarchical structure by combining the sequential templating approach with the shell-in-shell assembly. Especially, Lin et al. prepared triple-shelled hollow Mn2O3 nanoboxes via a programmed annealing treatment by using MnCO3 nanocubes as both templates and precursors.140 Wang et al.157 also prepared multi-shelled hollow single-crystal CoSn(OH)6 nanoboxes via alkaline solution etching by using their cube-like particles as both templates and precursors.
2.2 Soft template methods
Soft templating methods for multi-shelled hollow structures typically involve the formation of relatively flexible multilayer structures such as supramolecular micelles and polymer vesicles. The shell growth of the targeted material then proceeds at the respective interfaces of all the layers and the multi-shelled hollow structure could be obtained after the removal of the template. However, these complex and flexible multi-layered structures are thermodynamically metastable and easily destroyed by the change in various parameters resulting from shell growth, such as the pH value, temperature, solvent, ionic strength, concentration of organic templates and inorganic additives. Therefore, there are few successful examples. Wang et al. reported the vesicle templating synthesis of multi-shelled hollow Cu2O spheres with a single-crystalline shell structure by using cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactants (Fig. 6 and 7).134 Depending on the concentration of CTAB in the range of 0.1–0.15 M, as-formed vesicles with different layer numbers could template the formation of Cu2O hollow spheres with varying structures from single-, double-, triple-, to quadruple-shelled.134 Similarly, Liu et al.149 prepared multi-shelled mesoporous silica hollow nanospheres with a tunable shell number of 1–4 shells, and Gu et al.158 prepared multi-shelled mesoporous carbon hollow nanospheres with a tunable shell number of 3–9 shells, further demonstrating the feasibility of producing multi-shelled hollow structures through a vesicle templating approach.

2.3 Template-free methods
Template-free methods for multi-shelled hollow structures are especially attractive since they usually utilize the self-assembly of target materials and do not use any templates. Zhao et al.159 successfully prepared multi-shelled hollow azithromycin microspheres by using a very simple self-assembly approach (Fig. 8). Azithromycin vesicles easily form in an ethanol–water mixed system due to their significantly different solubility in ethanol and water and a self-diffusion of azithromycin from the interior to outward of vesicles driven by the concentration gradient would induce that the azithromycin happens to precipitate to form the first shell. Furthermore, azithromycin molecules continue to diffuse outward, inducing the formation of another shell. Repeating these processes, multi-shelled hollow microspheres could be obtained by this shell-by-shell process. Recently, Zhang et al.160 reported the synthesis of multi-shelled Cu2O hollow microspheres via a hierarchical self-assembly process and Wu et al.161 also prepared multi-shelled hollow ZnO spheres by the Ostwald ripening process. Template free methods represent the simplest and most expedient approach for multi-shelled hollow structures without any extra templates, which is of great importance for the practical application.

3. Compositional and geometric manipulation of multi-shelled hollow structure materials
During the past several years, significant progresses on the design and fabrication of multi-shelled hollow structures, especially on multi-shelled hollow metal oxide spheres, have been achieved, although there is still some great challenge for their practical applications. Some typical multi-shelled hollow structures are summarized in Table 1, including their compositional, geometric and method characteristics. Special cases on the compositional and geometric manipulation of multi-shelled hollow structures will be described as follows.

3.1 Compositional manipulation of multi-shelled hollow structure materials
Multi-shelled hollow structure materials could be classified into three types in composition: inorganic, organic and inorganic–organic hybrid. Some typical multi-shelled hollow structures with special composition are presented.

3.1.1 Inorganic multi-shelled hollow structure materials. 
Multi-shelled hollow metal oxides are a class of the most important inorganic multi-shelled hollow structures. Among them, binary metal oxides with multi-shelled hollow structures have been synthesized by various methods in a wide range and well demonstrated in the above-mentioned section. Herein more attention will be focused on their ternary metal oxide and mixed metal oxide counterparts. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that not only binary metal oxides but also ternary metal oxide (MFe2O4, M = Zn, Co, Ni, Cd) and heterogeneous mixed metal oxide (ZnO@ZnO/ZnFe2O4@ZnO/ZnFe2O4) multiple-shell hollow microspheres could be also prepared via the sequential templating by the simultaneous or successive use of different metal ions.70,135 Zhang et al.174 also reported a general “penetration–solidification–annealing” strategy for the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow spheres of various ternary metal oxides, including CoMn2O4, Co1.5Mn1.5O4, MnCo2O4, ZnMn2O4, ZnCo2O4, and NiCo2O4, where the absorption of metal ions was performed at a high temperature of 120 °C for realizing the deep “penetration” of metal ions into the carbonaceous spheres. Cho et al.156 reported the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow mixed metal oxide microspheres by using coordination polymer microspheres as the template and the cation exchange technique (Fig. 9). Spherically coordinating polymer particles (CPPs) containing zinc or cobalt ions were first synthesized via a precipitation method and then second metal ions (such as copper and nickel ions) were introduced through a cation exchange reaction, and multi-shelled hollow spheres of hybrid mixed metal oxides were finally obtained.

Furthermore, Hong et al.177 report the systematically synthesis of multi-shelled hollow materials with single, binary, ternary, quaternary, and quinary systems using a one-pot spray pyrolysis process from spray solution containing sucrose and one or more metal components (Fig. 10). First, micron-sized carbon–metal oxide composite powders were produced by drying and decomposition of the droplets generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer in air and then multi-shelled hollow powders could be obtained after calcination. Multi-shelled hollow powders with single (TiO2), binary (TiO2–Al2O3), ternary (TiO2–Al2O3–ZrO2), quaternary (TiO2–Al2O3–ZrO2–CeO2), and quinary (TiO2–Al2O3–ZrO2–CeO2–Y2O3) systems could be prepared (Fig. 11), depending on the kinds of metal ions within spray solution. It is notable that in those methods that one-step obtaining template particles containing metal ions and then heating have a significant advantage over the conventional “adsorption–calcination” methods in simplicity, the intrinsical limitation of the spray drying method and thus result in nonuniform multi-shelled hollow products, although the size uniformity of those template particles are significantly affected by the introduction of additional metal ions or the intrinsical limitation of the spray drying method and thus result in nonuniform multi-shelled hollow products.

Besides multi-shelled hollow metal oxides, multi-shelled hollow metal sulfides could also be produced. Xiong et al.167 demonstrated the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow Cu2O spheres via ion exchange by using the Cu2O and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) hybrid sphere as a precursor (Fig. 12 and 13). The inorganic–organic hybrids of Cu2O and PVP spheres (Fig. 12, step 1) were fabricated by a PVP-assisted polyol method, on the surface of which the Cu2S was formed by ion exchange (step 2). The continuous supply of S2− for the exchange process led to steady growth of the Cu2S shell and a continuous mass relocation of Cu2O crystallites from the inside out because of the faster mobility of oxygen anions than that of the sulfur, during which the Ostwald ripening process of Cu2S was observed. Out-diffusion of Cu2O crystallites and conversion of mesocrystalline Cu2O to a denser crystalline Cu2S shell were major processes responsible for the creation of a vacant space between the growing Cu2S shell and depleting Cu2O, which were closely coupled upon the anionic exchange (step 3). The second, third and fourth shells of Cu2S could be formed by repeating the above process (step 4–9). Moreover, they could also prepare multi-shelled hollow Cu2O spheres via a similar procedure by eliminating the cation exchange step.168

There are also some reports on multi-shelled hollow carbon structures. Gu et al.158 first reported the synthesis of onion like mesoporous carbon and carbon–silica composite with multi-shelled structure through a facile aqueous emulsion route, where they chose a low-molecular-weight soluble resol polymer as a carbon precursor, prehydrolyzed tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica source, commercially available Pluronic F127 as a template, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) as an organic cosolvent (Fig. 14 and 15). Spherical multilayer vesicles with particle sizes of 100–250 nm were obtained. Calcination at 350 °C in N2 removes the templates and porous polymer–silica composite vesicles with lamellar mesostructures are obtained. Further carbonizing at 900 °C affords mesoporous carbon–silica nanocomposites. Etching of silica yields multi-shelled hollow mesoporous carbon with 3–9 layers and multi-shelled hollow silica can also be obtained after calcination or microwave digesting (MWD) to remove the organic components. Chen et al.178 prepared multi-shelled hollow carbon nanospheres by the similar procedure and utilized them for lithium–sulfur batteries.

3.1.2 Organic multi-shelled hollow structure materials. 
Organic hollow structures with multiple shells are a class of new hollow materials and have attracted extensive attention. However, organic multi-shelled hollow structures are still difficult in preparation and there are few successful examples.
Zhao et al.159 reported the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow azithromycin microspheres by using a very simple self-assembly approach and the shell number could be easily adjusted by changing the starting concentration of the azithromycin ethanol solution. Pang et al.175 reported the synthesis of multi-shelled poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polypyrrole (PPy) hollow microspheres with a tunable wall thickness under mild reaction conditions by using Fe3O4 hollow spheres as sacrificial templates (Fig. 18 and 19). In the formation process of multi-shelled hollow structures, the concentration of the etchant (p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA)) and the polymerization rate of conductive polymers (CPs) are the key factors to generate multi-shelled hollow structures, and directly affect the shell number.

3.1.3 Organic–inorganic hybrid multi-shelled hollow structure materials. 
Organic–inorganic hybrid multi-shelled hollow structures present a class of multi-functional materials and have also received considerable attention. Caruso et al. used polystyrene (PS) particles as templates and alternately coated polymer and silica onto the templates through an electrostatic assembly of negatively charged silica nanoparticles and a positively charged polymer, repeating the assembly cycle to form multi-shelled structures, selectively removing PS particles and polymers to generate hollow silica spheres or solely removing PS particles to generate hollow silica–polymer hybrid spheres (Fig. 20).133

3.2 Geometric manipulation of multi-shelled hollow structure materials
Structural parameters of the multi-shelled hollow structures including the shape, shell number, size and thickness, as well as the inter-shell spacing and so forth, endow them some special physical or chemical properties, thus making enormous influence on their performance in practical applications. For example, Dong et al. reported that the energy conversion efficiency of multi-shelled hollow ZnO microspheres can be remarkably improved by manipulating the inter-shell spacing.26 As a result, geometric manipulation of multi-shelled hollow structures is absolutely of great importance, and discussed in detail as below.

3.2.1 Shell number. 
Shell number is one of the most important features for multi-shelled hollow structures, which makes them distinguished from their single- or double-shelled counterparts and results in some unique chemical/physical properties. Considerable efforts have been devoted to control the shell number of multi-shelled hollow structures via various techniques. In our original work on the sequential templating approach, we demonstrated that the shell number of multi-shelled hollow metal oxide spheres is related to the concentration and penetration depth of metal ions within the carbonaceous templates and can be well adjusted by changing the concentration of metal salt solution during the adsorption process.70,135 And then proceeding with an in-depth study, other parameters, such as the solvent type and compositions, immersion period, also have a remarkable effect on the final shell number of the resulting multi-shelled hollow structures. For example, due to the larger radii of hydrated cobalt ions ([Co(H2O)6]2+) and thus poor “penetration”, only single-shelled Co3O4 microspheres were obtained when 1 M of cobalt acetate aqueous solution was solely used.31 Nevertheless, when ethanol was additionally introduced (ethanol:water = 1:1, v/v) for reducing the aquo groups (H2O) within hydrated cobalt ions and decreasing radii of hydrated cobalt ions, double-shelled Co3O4 microspheres were produced. Further increasing the volume fraction of ethanol and raising the temperatures of the mixed solution can lead to triple-shelled Co3O4 microspheres. Moreover additionally acid treatment on carbonaceous templates would result in the quadruple-shelled Co3O4 microspheres (Fig. 21 and 22).31 A similar synthetic methodology has been successfully applied to acquire multi-shelled hollow α-Fe2O3 spheres.142 In the case of TiO2 hollow spheres, the shell number could be adjusted from 1 to 3 by regulating the immersion period of Ti coordination ions with carbonaceous templates from 6, 8 to 24 h.32

3.2.2 Shell size and thickness as well as inter-shell spacing. 
Besides the shell number, shell size (diameter of the shell) and thickness as well as inter-shell spacing also play an important role in determining the interior structure and have a significant effect on their performances in practical applications.25,26,31,32,70,137,143,147,150,172 With the sequential templating approach, the size of the outer shell is mainly determined by that of templates adopted and could be well tuned to some extent,179 while the sizes of inner shells are related to the forming conditions.70 For example, we reported a modified sequential templating approach for multi-shelled hollow ZnO spheres by controlling the heating rate, wherein the size of the secondary shell could be effectively adjusted from small to large, resulting in uniform inter-shell distribution or close double-shell in the exterior (Fig. 23).26 The heating rate also has an influence on the distribution of Zn ions between the outer shell and inner core and can lead to different structures: (1) fast heating results in fewer Zn ions within the outer shell and finally a thin shell is produced; (2) slow heating gives rise to more Zn ions within the outer shell and closed double-shell in the resulting exterior; (3) medium heating tends to form a thick shell. For hollow SnO2 microspheres, such special structures with a closed double-shell in the exterior could also be produced by simply alkali-treating carbonaceous microspheres and thus increasing the absorbed quantity of Sn ions in their outer segment (Fig. 24).137 As a result, an additional shell was formed by this alkali-treatment compared with those without it.

3.2.3 Morphology. 
Until now, multi-shelled hollow structures are mostly spherical in morphology. Well-defined nonspherical multi-shelled hollow structures have been rarely reported due to the difficulty of forming uniform shells with high-curvature surfaces. However, there are still some successful examples for constructing nonspherical multi-shelled hollow structures by adopting novel precursors. Wang et al. report a facile “pumpkin-carving” strategy for the preparation of multi-shelled hollow single-crystal CoSn(OH)6 nanoboxes.157 Perovskite-type CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes were used as precursors and gradually dissolved in concentrated alkaline solution by coordinating with an excess amount of OH− to form soluble [Co(OH)4]2− and [Sn(OH)6]2− at room temperature. An insoluble boundary layer of Co(III) species from the oxidation of [Co(OH)4]2− in air can be readily formed on the surface of CoSn(OH)6 crystals, reducing the alkaline etching. With continuous evacuation of the core materials across the shell, hollow CoSn(OH)6 nanoboxes were eventually formed. More impressively, CoSn(OH)6 hollow architectures with multi-shelled nanoboxes can be finally produced by repeating the deposition of CoSn(OH)6 layers onto pre-grown CoSn(OH)6 particles (e.g., nanocubes or nanoboxes) and successive alkaline etching (Fig. 25).

Lin et al. also reported the synthesis of triple-shelled hollow Mn2O3 nanoboxes through a programmed annealing treatment with cubic MnCO3 as a precursor.140 MnCO3 nanocubes were first sintered at 300 °C and partially converted into manganese oxide, leading to the formation of the outer shell. The different contraction rate between the outer shell and inner core leads to their separation. Further heating to a much higher temperature (600 °C) and repeating this process could result in the formation of more shells and triple-shelled hollow structures were obtained finally.

4. Applications of multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials
4.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been widely regarded as one of the most promising candidates for next generation photovoltaic devices. Recent advancements in architectural and compositional design and fabrication have been made to improve the power conversion efficiency for decades since Grätzel made a great breakthrough in DSSCs in 1991.136,180–187 One of the most effective ways is to enhance light harvesting by structural and morphological design of the photoanode materials.188–190 Hollow micro-/nanostructured materials could greatly enhance light harvesting ability and adsorb more dye as well. The nano-sized shells can provide a large surface area which is necessary for dye loading and unique hollow structures can also effectively enhance light harvesting by simultaneously increasing the diffractions and the reflections on the shell structure. A large amount of single-shelled hollow materials have been used as photoanodes, such as TiO2, ZnO and SnO2.17,20,191 Multi-shelled hollow structured materials were found to be an attractive alternative due to their potential in enhancing inner light reflections by adjusting the inner structure.
Our group has successfully synthesized multi-shelled ZnO hollow microspheres with different structures through a modified sequential templating method and applied as photoanodes for DSSCs (Fig. 26).26 The structural effect of the synthesized materials on the energy conversion efficiency was investigated in detail (Fig. 27). It is proved that increasing the number of shells as well as manipulating the inter-shell spacing can greatly enhance the light harvesting ability leading to remarkable energy conversion efficiency improvement. It is worth mentioning that close double-shell in the exterior structured multi-shelled hollow microspheres show better scattering ability than that of uniform inter-shell distributed multi-shelled hollow microspheres. A high efficiency of 5.6% is achieved using quadruple-shelled hollow microspheres, which is ascribed to the large surface area and the outstanding light reflection and scattering ability. Moreover, multi-shelled SnO2 hollow microspheres have also been fabricated by templating carbonaceous microspheres, which are pre-treated by using NaOH aqueous solution and followed by adsorption of SnCl4 aqueous solution.137 With the number of shells increasing, the DSSC efficiency is improved. On the other hand, when the hollow microspheres are used as a scattering layer on top of P25 TiO2 photoanode for DSSCs, the efficiency could be further improved from 7.5% to 9.53%. Except for homogeneous material, Qian et al. have designed heterogeneous triple-shelled hollow TiO2 coated SnO2 composite microspheres for improving the efficiency.136 Recently, multi-shelled hollow TiO2 spheres with different shells have successfully been synthesized and applied in DSSCs by Jiang's group.138 The enhanced light harvesting from multiple light reflections and scattering also lead to higher efficiency.

Transmission electron microscopy images of carbonaceous microspheres after immersion in zinc nitrate solutions before heating (room temperature) and after heating at different temperatures (400 °C, 400 °C for 30 min, 420 °C, 460 °C, 480 °C or 500 °C). 3 M and 5 M zinc nitrate solutions were used in samples I, II, III and samples IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, respectively. The diameters of carbonaceous microspheres used in samples I, II, III, IV, V and VI are 3 μm, and those used in samples VII, VIII, and IX are 4 μm. The temperature in the fast and medium heating modes is directly increased to 500 °C at 2 and 1 °C min−1 respectively, while the temperature in the slow heating mode is increased to 500 °C at 1 °C min−1 with 30 min holding at 400 °C. The scale bars are 1 μm for the samples from I to VI and 1.3 μm for samples from VII to IX in the first column. All the scale bars in the second column are 0.5 μm, while the scale bars in the third and higher columns are all 0.3 μm. Reprinted with permission from ref. 26. Copyright 2012, John Wiley & Sons.

The above-mentioned studies apparently prove that the light reflection and scattering ability are improved with the increasing shell number of multi-shelled hollow spheres, leading to better light harvesting and higher power conversion efficiency. However, the light reflection in the inner shells remains much weaker and more fine manipulation on the interior structure should be combined with other techniques (including surface treatment, coupling graphene or carbon nanotube and enhancing charge transfer) to further improve the efficiency.
4.2 Lithium ion batteries
Owning to their light weight, small self-discharge, high energy density, no memory effect, and being environmentally friendly, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have become one of the dominant power sources for portable electronics and are also considered as the most promising power sources for electric and hybrid vehicles in the near future.192,193 However, with the continuous demands for power newly emerging electronics, advanced communication facilities and so forth, numerous efforts still need to be made to design next-generation LIBs with larger capacity, higher safety, longer cycle life and better charge/discharge rate capability.194
Hollow micro-/nanostructures are thought to be an attractive candidate on the basis of the following considerations: (1) the larger surface area of the hollow structures enables an increased electrode–electrolyte contact area as well as more Li-ion storage sites, resulting in a larger gravimetric capacity; (2) the nanoparticles of the hollow structures often insure a reduced effective diffusion distance for charge and ions, leading to a better rate capability; (3) the hollow interior provides additional free volume to alleviate the structural strain associated with repeated Li-ion insertion/deinsertion processes, giving rise to a better cycling performance. Especially, multi-shelled hollow structures have some obvious advantages over their single- or double-shelled counterparts, such as larger volumetric capacity and better structural and electrochemical stabilities. For example, our group first reported the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow TiO2 microspheres (MS-TiO2-HMS) with a controlled shell number, shell thickness and inter-shell spacing and demonstrated their significantly enhanced electrochemical properties (Fig. 28 and 29).32Fig. 29 shows that the obtained initial discharge capacities of 1S-, 2S-, 3S-TiO2-HMS, and 2S-, 3S-, and 4S-TiO2-HMS-CDS (with closed exterior double-shells) were determined to be 172, 204, 260, 97, 122, and 154 mA h g−1, respectively. The higher capacity than the theoretical capacity is ascribed to a part of capacity from the surface of the nano-materials besides lithiation capacity.195Fig. 29b highlights that all multi-shelled structures exhibited significantly improved cycling performance than that of the commercially available Degussa P25, with the 3S-TiO2-HMS specimen possessing the highest specific capacity and the best cycling performance. A superior capacity, up to 237 mA h g−1 with minimal irreversible capacity after 100 cycles is achieved at a current rate of 1 C (167.5 mA g−1). The superior cycling performance is ascribed to the superior structural stability of MS-TiO2-HMS and the ability to mitigate the strain during the charge and discharge processes. And 3S-TiO2-HMS shows better performance than that of 1S- and 2S-TiO2-HMS specimens because it has a higher surface area and greater quantity of 10 nm nanopores, which improves electrolyte transport and Li+ diffusion during the charge/discharge process. The cycling performance of MS-TiO2-HMS at different current densities was also investigated, showing a high rate capability, with a capacity of 119 mA h g−1 being achieved at a current rate of 10 C even after 1200 cycles, which derives from the nano-sized particles of the hierarchical structures.

Our group also showed that the LIB performance of Co3O4-based electrode materials could be further improved through accurately controlling the number of shells (1–4) and the interior structures of multi-shelled Co3O4 hollow microspheres.31 These uniform Co3O4 hollow microspheres were synthesized in high yield with high purity by a hard-template method. The initial capacities of single-, double-, triple-, and quadruple-shelled Co3O4 microspheres are 1087.2, 1450.0, 2063.7 and 1626.2 mA h g−1, respectively. Fig. 30A highlights that after 30 cycles, the specific capacities of single-, double-, triple-, and quadruple-shelled Co3O4 microspheres remain as high as 792.7, 1303, 1615.8 and 1011.5 mA h g−1, respectively, while that of commercial Co3O4 is only 287.5 mA h g−1. Even at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1, the triple-shelled Co3O4 microspheres can still deliver a capacity of at least 1117.3 mA h g−1. Remarkably, a stable high capacity of 1505 mA h g−1can be still attained when the current density is reduced back to 50 mA g−1, see Fig. 30B. This result might suggest that the elastic multi-shelled structures are indeed very “breathable”. The LIB performance of the triple-shelled Co3O4 microspheres was clearly superior to that of the commercial Co3O4 powder and the other three types of multi-shelled Co3O4 hollow microspheres. This discrepancy may be explained by the different volume-occupying rates of the different microsphere types after Li uptake. A smaller volume-occupying rate is unfavorable for a high volumetric specific capacity, whereas a larger volume-occupying rate has a negative effect on the structural stability and thus leads to electrode failure and poor cycling performance. An appropriate volume-occupying rate, such as that of the triple-shelled Co3O4 microspheres, guarantees a high volumetric specific capacity as well as good structure stability and thus leads to the highest lithium storage and excellent cycling performance.

Compared with Co3O4, α-Fe2O3 has a lower toxicity and higher theoretical capacity as the anode materials for LIBs. Multi-shelled α-Fe2O3 hollow microspheres were synthesized by Xu et al. using carbonaceous microsphere sacrificial templates and utilized for high capacity anode materials in LIBs. Structural aspects including shell thickness, number of internal multi-shells, and shell porosity were controlled by synthesis parameters to produce hollow microspheres with maximum lithium capacity and stable cycling behaviour.142 Triple-shelled hollow microspheres with thin and porous shells showed the best cycling performance, demonstrating excellent stability and reversible capacities up to 1702 mA h g−1 at current densities of 50 mA g−1. Improved lithium storage properties have also been reported in many other hollow micro-/nanostructures including NiO,196 MnO2,197 ZnMn2O4,174 and VOOH.198 All these results clearly show the high improvement of the LIB performance using multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as electrodes. However, to achieve commercial success of these multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured electrodes, continued fundamental advances in the science and engineering of materials' composition, morphology and structures are required to gain further improved performance. The integration of the hollow structure concept with electrochemical active materials arguably provides an effective way to generate high-performance electrode materials with great disadvantages over bulk and solid materials. Yet it should also be pointed out that hollow structured electrode materials have some advantages needed to be settled down in the future. While having the advantages of enhanced rate capability and cycling stability, hollow structures at the same time will inevitably accelerate the decomposition of electrolytes, aggravate the formation of solid electrolyte interphase film, resulting in a lower initial columbic efficiency, and reduce the volumetric energy density of the electrodes because of the presence of interior cavities. In this regard, finely tuning the shell size and thickness as well as inter-shell spacing of multi-shelled metal oxide hollow structures is required to take their complete advantages without compromising the volumetric energy density too much.
4.3 Supercapacitors
Though an energy density as high as 180 W h kg−1 can be achieved by LIBs, they usually suffer from a slow power delivery or uptake. Therefore, the large-scale application of LIBs is inhibited especially in energy storage systems where fast and high power storage devices are extremely required. Supercapacitors (SCs), especially pseudocapacitors, with a high power density, superior rate capability, rapid charging/discharging rate, long cycle life span (>100000 cycles), have been attracting much scientific and technical interest due to potential integration of the advantages of both lithium ion batteries (high energy density) and conventional capacitors (high power density). Among different types of electrode materials for supercapacitors, transition metal oxides, such as RuO2, CoOx, NiO, and MnOx, have been widely investigated because of their low cost, easy accessibility, remarkable storage capacity/reversibility and good environmental compatibility. However, some drawbacks still limited their potentials as supercapacitor electrodes: (1) low specific surface area, resulting in fewer faradic active sites, hence lower specific capacitance; (2) poor electron and ion conductivities, unfavorable for high rate of charge/discharge, leading to a lower power density; (3) partial dissolution in the electrolytes during cycling, giving rise to the capacitance degradation.
Multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures, with different shells supported on each other, hold great promise to overcome the above challenges due to the following advantages: (1) the unique multi-shelled hollow structure can provide more accessible faradic reactive sites in the real capacitive process as a result of the enhanced surface-to-volume ratio and/or enlarged effective surface area per unit mass, leading to a higher energy density; (2) the porous shells can dramatically enhance the accessibility of the electrolyte to the active manganese oxide surface with improved conductivity and shorten transport length for both ions and charges and thus the rate capability and power density can be improved; (3) importantly, with the multi-shelled hollow structures, the exterior shell protects the interior shells from the electrochemical dissolution to achieve better structural and electrochemical stabilities, leading to an improved cycling performance.
Wang et al.39 reported a controlled synthesis of multi-shelled cobalt oxide hollow microspheres using carbon microspheres (CSs) as templates. The Co2CO3(OH)2 are first grown on the CSs to form the core–shell composites. Then after annealing the composites in air, multi-shelled hollow interiors within the Co3O4 microspheres are unconventionally obtained. When used as the electrode materials for supercapacitors, specific capacitances as high as 394.4, 386, 360, 339, and 319 F g−1 can be achieved at the current density of 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 A g−1. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the multi-shelled hollow structures, including thin shells, empty space between shells, enlarged contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, all of which providing easy electrolyte penetration and ensuring high rate capability.
Nickel oxide (NiO) also has been suggested as a promising electrode material due to its outstanding theoretical specific capacitance of 3750 F g−1 and low environmental impact.199 Zhang et al.200 demonstrated the preparation of uniform hollow core–shell NiO microspheres using a non-hydrothermal method and a facial lamellar template model. The characteristics of surface structures, such as high specific surface area and pore volume, render them facile electrolyte penetration, lowered ion diffusion resistance and better utilization of the electroactive surface for Faradaic reactions. As a result, these NiO microspheres show a high capacitance of 455 F g−1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1 with <95% Coulombic efficiency. Besides that, a layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly method for controllable preparation of single-, double-, and triple-shelled NiO hollow nanospheres (S-NiO, D-NiO, and T-NiO) are proposed by Zhu et al., which were obtained by calcining Ni(OH)2/C precursors formed at different stages. They found that the external nano flakes of multi-shelled NiO hollow nanospheres are inherited from the Ni(OH)2 precursors, while the inner shells result from the formation of different Ni(OH)2 layers within the carbon spheres during different preparation cycles. Interestingly, the resulted specific capacitances are proportional to the specific surface areas of different NiO hollow nanospheres, with D-NiO (92.99 m2 g−1) having a higher capacitance of 612.5 F g−1 than S-NiO (432.2 F g−1) and T-NiO (292.4 F g−1) at 0.5 A g−1.
Recently, our group reported a scalable approach to fabricate multi-shelled hollow Mn2O3 microspheres as high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.143 By simply tuning the pH value of the adsorption solution and also the temperature and solvent composition, single-, double-, triple-, quadruple-shelled hollow Mn2O3 microspheres as well as Mn2O3 nanoparticles can be achieved. Impressively, a new record high capacitance of 1651 F g−1 can be achieved at a discharge current density of 0.5 A g−1 and still kept as high as 1422 F g−1 at a high discharge current density of 10 F g−1, indicating a superior rate performance (Fig. 31). Besides, the multi-shelled Mn2O3 hollow microspheres exhibited a much better cycling stability, with still 1517 F g−1 kept after 2000 consecutive cycles for triple-shelled hollow Mn2O3 microspheres (only 7.8% loss). The excellent capacitive performance can be ascribed to the unique architecture of these designed micro-/nanostructures, which allows efficient use of pseudo-capacitive Mn2O3 nanomaterials for charge storage with facilitated transport for both ions and electrons, and also with the shells supporting each other to undertake some mechanical deformation and swell in the redox processes and suppress the dissolution of Mn2O3 in an electrolyte.

4.4 Sensors
Sensors are widely used in the engineering field. To date, many efforts have been done to develop new devices and materials for different kinds of sensors, such as gas,201–203 chemicals,204 humidity,205,206 optical,207 and bio-molecule sensors. Usually, special structures of materials are well designed for a higher sensitivity. The sensing material plays an important role in manifesting the sensor characteristics. Owing to the porous structure, large specific surface areas, low density, good permeation, and less agglomerated configurations, hollow micro-/nanostructures exhibit potential for accomplishing both high response and fast responding kinetics,208 which make this kind of material successfully applied in gas-sensors. Different materials with hollow structures such as ZnO,209 SnO2,210 Cu2O(CuO)211 and WO362 have been synthesized though various processes and applied in diverse gas sensing (NH3, NO, CO, etc.) which shows an enhanced sensitivity.
Our group reported a straightforward and general strategy to prepare metal oxide hollow microspheres with a controlled number of shells.70 Multi-shelled α-Fe2O3 hollow spheres have prepared by this method and their responses to ethanol significantly increase with the shell number (Fig. 32). Similarly, Zhang's group also prepared multi-shelled hollow ZnO spheres and demonstrated their enhanced sensing properties for HCHO with the increasing shell number.171 The responses of these sensors to 100 ppm of HCHO, CO, H2S, NH3, and C2H4 at an optimal operating temperature of 240 °C are shown in Fig. 33a. The gas responses of single-, double- and triple-shelled hollow sphere (S-1, S-2 and S-3) sensors to 100 ppm HCHO are 6.2, 19.0 and 24.8, respectively. Clearly, the S-3 sensor exhibits an obvious response for HCHO and lesser effects for CO, H2S, NH3, and C2H4 at 240 °C. The sensor responses to different HCHO concentrations are compared in Fig. 33b, showing that the S-3 sensor has much higher response. These results indicate that the S-3 sensor displays about 1.5 and 3.4 fold enhancements in response compared to the S-2 and S-1 one, respectively, which in turn directly verifies the promotion effect of different shelled sensors. The improvement of the sensing performance of the triple-shelled hollow ZnO microspheres may be attributed to two main aspects. First, the hollow three-shelled structures can provide a more efficient way to enhance gas-harvesting efficiency (Fig. 34a) since such structures possess an increased active surface area, and enable multiple gases to diffuse between one outer spherical shell and the two interior shells compared with double-shelled and single-shelled hollow spheres (Fig. 34b and c). Recently, Sun et al. also reported the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow Cr2O3 spheres, which exhibited a higher response to ethanol than those for single-shelled hollow spheres.145

4.5 Photocatalysis
Multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials as photocatalysts have several distinguishing features compared with traditional single-shelled hollow catalysts: (1) a special hollow cavity structure and more lower density; (2) a tunable surface-to-volume ratio and (3) short transport lengths for both mass and charge. One of the most prominent characteristics of multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials is that the multi-shelled hollow structure allows for more multiple reflections of the incident light, and thus enhances the light-harvesting efficiency and further enhances their catalytic performance. These unique features may bring novel collective properties for some catalytic reactions and stimulate extensive interest in the field such as degradation of organic compounds, water splitting and water treatment.

4.5.1 Degradation of organic compounds. 
Along with the development of global industrialization process, environmental issues have already become the most important problem which influences human survival and development. In recent years, the degradation of organic compounds driven by solar energy at room temperature has become an ideal environment pollution control technology which is considered to be the most promising technology to solve environmental pollution problems and has become the research focus in the field of environment. The process in the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructured materials has provided opportunities for their widespread use in photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds. One of the early studies by Zeng et al. utilized multi-shelled titania hollow spheres as photocatalysts for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB).146 Multi-shelled hollow spheres exhibit the highest activity of 84% after irradiation for 40 min, while sphere-in-sphere structures and nanoparticles show a lower activity of 54% and 58%, respectively (Fig. 35). Since all the samples possess similar crystalline structures, surface areas, and nearly the same residual carbon, they think that the superior activities of multi-shelled hollow spheres may arise from their unique multi-shelled hollow structures. The increased number of shells could lead to the multiple reflections of UV light in the interior cavity, resulting in the enhancement of light absorbance and thus photocatalytic activity. However, the lower activity of single-shelled hollow spheres is due to negligible multiple reflections because of the too small size of the inner sphere compared to the outer one, and the conclusion is similar to previous reports.212

Zeng et al. have reported a simple and general method to fabricate hollow microspheres with a controlled number of shells by using carbonaceous saccharide microspheres with different diameters as templates.213 The triple-shelled ZnO hollow microsphere exhibits the best photocatalytic activity in the degradation of the methyl orange (MO) dye. They explain that (1) compared with the nanoparticles and single-shelled hollow spheres the triple-shelled hollow microsphere structures can enable multiple light reflection and scattering between the outer spherical shell and the two interior shells to provide a more efficient way to enhance light-harvesting efficiency. (2) The triple-shelled hollow structure can also supply more specific surface area for adsorbing more dye molecules which contribute to the high degradation performance. (3) The better photo-induced charge separation efficiency of triple-shelled hollow microsphere structures plays an important role in significant enhancement in conductivity. Recently, Ma and co-workers have adopted a simplified hard template method to achieve hierarchical multi-shelled ZnO porous hollow spheres by controlling the calcination conditions as well.214 They consider that the synthesis of hierarchical multi-shelled porous hollow spheres is based not only on the inside-out Ostwald ripening process but also on an unusual temperature gradient crystallization mechanism. The obtained hierarchical triple-shelled ZnO porous hollow spheres exhibit the best photocatalytic activity (98.97%) for the degradation of RhB under the same irradiation time compared with the hierarchical single-shelled porous hollow spheres (84.14%) and hierarchical double-shelled porous hollow spheres (88.33%), which are attributed to the multi-shelled hollow structure. Liu and co-workers have demonstrated a very simple but effective strategy to synthesize α-Fe2O3 hollow spheres of multiple porous shells by a facile solvothermal method using carbon spheres as templates.169 The photocatalytic activities of the as-obtained multi-shelled and single-shelled α-Fe2O3 hollow spheres are evaluated for the degradation of organic dye RhB in the presence of H2O2 under visible-light illumination. The multi-shelled α-Fe2O3 hollow spheres possess a much higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB than the single-shelled hollow spheres. The multi-shelled α-Fe2O3 hollow spheres provide much more active sites at multiple shells, allowing efficient transport of the reactant molecules and thus leading to higher photodegradation efficiency. Additionally, multiple reflection of the illumination light may occur at the multiple shells of the porous spheres, resulting in more efficient absorption of the light, and the conclusion is similar to previous reports.51,215 Multi-shelled hollow CoSn(OH)6 nanoboxes with uniform size and porous shell are synthesized by the fast growth of CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes and kinetically-controlled etching in alkaline medium, and the obtained CoSn(OH)6 hollow nanostructures can be easily converted to hollow nanostructures of tin-based ternary metal oxides (Co–Sn–O nanoboxes) with excellent photocatalytic activity in the degradation of methylene blue (MB).157 Xi and co-workers reported the synthesis of well-defined WO3 hollow spheres with multiple-shells through binary carbonaceous spheres as sacrificial templates, and the multi-shelled WO3 hollow spheres exhibit greatly enhanced activity in the visible-light photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants.45


4.5.2 Water splitting. 
Global energy and environmental crisis are important topics.216 The rate of worldwide energy consumption reached almost 15 TW in 2008 and is expected to around double by 2050 due to the dramatic increase of global production and population.217 Solar energy is widely regarded as a free, abundant and incessant renewable source of clean energy, which could meet current and future human energy demand in a long time. Forming chemical bonds to collect and store solar energy by photosynthesis is a highly desirable approach to solve the energy challenge.217
Solar water splitting directly to hydrogen and oxygen has become one of the most desirable methods for harvesting and conversion of solar energy into chemical energy.216,218 At present, a larger number of photocatalysts including metal oxide semiconductors,219 metal sulfide,220 metal nitride,221 and composite semiconductors222 have been reported. Though these catalysts exhibit improved performance for photocatalytic water splitting, low efficiency still remains, which should originate from the low incident light absorption,223 fast recombination of electron–hole pairs,224 and low photocatalytic stability.225 The design and development of efficient photocatalysts is a critical issue in photocatalytic water splitting, while multi-shelled hollow structure semiconductor microspheres can integrate a series of functions into a microsystem dealing with the subtasks involving enhancing light absorption and speeding the rate of electron transfer/separation, which can be a new structure photocatalyst for water splitting.
Qi et al.147 have developed a simple and facile “self-templating” approach construct triple-shelled hollow structure CeO2 spheres by a combination of hydrothermal and calcination treatments. Impressively, with respect to commercial CeO2 nanoparticles, single-shelled and double-shelled hollow structure CeO2 spheres and the triple-shelled CeO2 hollow spheres exhibit excellent activity and improved stability for photocatalytic water oxidation with AgNO3 as the electron scavenger (Fig. 36). The outstanding catalytic performance of the triple-shelled hollow structure CeO2 spheres results from their unique properties: (1) the triple-shelled hollow structure allows for more multiple reflections of the incident light, and thus enhances the light-harvesting efficiency; (2) the larger surface area and the more active sites of the triple-shelled hollow structure CeO2 spheres are beneficial for separation of the electron–hole pairs; (3) the more curved surfaces of the triple-shelled hollow structure CeO2 spheres make it more difficult for deposition of as-formed Ag NPs, resulting in better stability. Cui et al.226 have implemented a straightforward approach to prepare uniform and multi-shelled hollow spheres of h-(Pt–TiO2)/CdS with platinum nanoparticles selectively loaded onto the internal wall. The multi-shelled h-(Pt–TiO2)/CdS hollow spheres have three advantages: (1) the outer layer of CdS works as an antenna to receive visible light, ensuring the photogenerated carriers inject easily into the internal layer of the conduction band of TiO2 that works as a hydrogen evolution reaction active layer; (2) the shells are highly porous and thus permeable to the reactant and product; (3) the platinum loaded on the internal surface of the hollow spheres provides vectorial transfer of photogenerated electrons for fast migration. The above advantages of multi-shelled h-(Pt–TiO2)/CdS hollow spheres lead to high efficiency of visible-light driven photocatalytic H2 evolution.

4.6 Drug delivery
Multi-shelled hollow nanostructured materials are also advantageous for drug delivery in their distinct chemical/thermal stability, high drug loading capability, sustained drug release from the supports and rich surface chemical functionalities for possible molecular recognition and targeted delivery. Huang et al.148 have successfully fabricated multi-shelled hollow silica nanospheres by shell-by-shell assembly (Fig. 37), which could be used in dual-modality for imaging as well as drug co-delivery vectors. The in vitro evaluation in triple-shelled hollow silica nanospheres demonstrated that an anti-cancer doxorubicin loaded in the outer periphery space was successfully carried, released in the cytoplasm and then entered nuclei while fluorescence in fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate (primarily distributed in inner periphery space) has been effectively encapsulated inside the spheres. Liu et al.149 have also reported the synthesis of multi-shelled hollow silica spheres with mesoporous shells and further investigated their applications in drug loading and releasing, in which triple- and double-shelled hollow silica exhibit a higher capacity of loading ibuprofen (IBU) than their single-shelled counterparts.

5. Summary and outlook
Multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures attract rising interest due to their numerous unique properties and functionalities and potential applications. A large number of progresses have been made on their synthesis, compositional and geometric manipulation, and applications, especially in the last five years. In this review, the multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures are categorized by compositions into inorganic materials (including metal oxide, metal sulfide, silica, and carbon), organic materials and organic–inorganic hybrid materials, and summarized on the basis of their synthesis approaches and formation mechanisms, as well as applications. We hope that related researchers can get useful information about the synthesis, properties and potential applications of these unique materials, and thus promote them and the related research.
Multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures can be fabricated by three methods, hard templating, soft templating and template-free methods. Among them, the hard templating method, especially the sequential templating method, is the most common and effective, which has exhibited significant power for producing multi-shelled hollow metal oxide micro-/nanostructures. However, a majority of those multi-shelled hollow metal oxide micro-/nanostructures reported in the literature are synthesized by using cations or neutral molecules as the precursors, which greatly limits the diversity and complexity of the resulted structures since some metal elements usually or only exist as anions in aqueous solution. How to expand the components of multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures by exploiting the novel synthesis method or adopting anion-precursors is of great importance and will remain a big challenge in a relative long time. Furthermore, some metal carbides or nitrides with multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures, which may have substantial advantages in high-temperature catalysis due to their high melting points, low sintering tendencies, and great chemical inertness under non-oxidizing conditions, are also worthy of developing from their oxide counterparts by post-treatment techniques. More importantly, some complex multi-shelled hollow materials with the Janus structure in respective shells or heterogeneous counterparts with different compositions in different shells are also expectable since they may provide unique properties and functionalities and find new applications. For example, homogeneous or heterogeneous multi-shelled hollow structures with different compositions in respective shells are ideal candidates to offer natural separated active sites to fulfill the requirements of different kinds of reactions, simultaneously affording the high activity and selectivity, which is of great importance for some cascade reactions to effectively realize the transformation, separation and purification of target products.
The breakthrough of synthetic methodologies for multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures also provide opportunities to acquire unique physical or chemical properties and performance in specific applications by manipulating their geometric structures, such as shell numbers, shell size and thickness, inter-shell spacing as well as shell composition and morphology. Though some successful examples have been well demonstrated in the above-mentioned specific cases, it is still difficult to fabricate high-quality multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures of accurate composition and special geometry to satisfy all the requirements of a specific application. More efforts on the controlled synthesis and structural manipulation of multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures will allow us to make full utilization of their unique properties for various applications. For example, by increasing the number of shells or carefully manipulating the inner-shell spacing, excellent light-harvesting ability can be obtained by multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures due to the induced light resonant effect by the narrow space between the shells of multi-shelled microspheres, which is beneficial to improve light utilization efficiency for solar cells, photocatalysis and photodetectors. Moreover, multi-shelled hollow micro-/nanostructures with more shells, when utilized as electrode materials for LIBs or SCs, can provide additional reactive sites on the multilevel surfaces for ions or charge storage, resulting in greatly improved capacity which may even exceed the theoretical ones in spite of the unclear mechanisms. Furthermore, it is quite necessary to create thin self-supported shells with ordered and controlled porous system for facilitating the electrolyte penetration and alleviating the structural strain associated with repeated ion insertion/extraction processes and thus leads to improved rate performance and cycling stability. However, till now though there are a few reports on multi-shell hollow silica spheres with ordered mesoporous shells, other ordered porous materials, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),227,228 covalent organic frameworks (COF),229 zeolite,230 have not been fabricated into multi-shelled hollow structures. Especially, MOFs have been attracting much attention in energy storage and heterogeneous catalysis due to their intriguing features including an extraordinarily large surface area, a well-defined pore structure, easy tailorable chemistry, and high acid–base catalytic activities. Similarly, other applications of multi-shelled hollow structures, such as photocatalysis, sensors, drug delivery, can also benefit from the creation of more shells and ordered porous structure in shells. Besides these, some surface modified techniques could be combined, which would allow for additional crystalline boundaries, dangling bonds, and functional groups and further improve the performance in specific applications, for example, proving extra ion storage sites and boosting the overall capacity in energy storage devices.
Lastly, though we have summarized lots of recent studies concerning the multi-shelled hollow structure micro-/nanomaterials used in various areas, there is still a long way to go for their scale-up applications for future industrial use. We hope this review can open up a new avenue for exploiting the great potential of multi-shelled complex hollow micro-/nanostructures in energy conversion and storage, catalysis, acoustics, biomedicine and many other important fields.
