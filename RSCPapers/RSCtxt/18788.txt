    , Accepted 10th May 2021First published on 12th May 2021AbstractIt was well known that the “face-on” molecular orientation of acceptors is crucial for efficient charge transport in devices, but less is known about the role of the halogen atoms in controlling the molecular packing. In this article, a set of three acceptor materials with a benzotriazole-based unfused core, coded as BTC6-XF respectively with zero, two and four F atoms on the end groups, were designed and synthesized. Moreover, the effect of halogen atoms on the molecular alignment control was investigated. GIWAXS profiles show that BTC6-0F prefers the edge-on stacking, BTC6-2F adopts the mixed edge-on and face-on packing, and BTC6-4F tends to form the face-on molecular orientation. Additionally, it was found that BTC6-4F possessed more effective carrier transport and less charge recombination than BTC6-0F or BTC6-2F. As a result, the BTC6-4F-based OSC achieved the champion PCE of 11.23% when paired with the polymer donor PBDB-T, while the corresponding BTC6-2F and BTC6-0F based devices respectively gave 10.10% and 8.49% PCEs. This work sheds some light upon the design of small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors for efficient organic solar cells.
Introduction
In recent years, intensive attention has been paid to unfused-core non-fullerene acceptors, characteristic of the structure of acceptor–donor–core–donor–acceptor (A–D–C–D–A), for organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their simple synthetic steps, flexible unit combination, and low material costs, with a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 14%.1–13 In this type of acceptor material, the molecular backbones can be locked via multiple intramolecular noncovalent interactions including S⋯O,3–6 C–H⋯O,7 C–H⋯F,9,13 and S⋯F.10,12,13 Such noncovalent conformational locks would reinforce the coplanarity of acceptor molecules, effectively broaden their absorption spectra and significantly improve their charge transport properties.14,15 In previous work, however, small molecule acceptors of this A–D–C–D–A type have primarily been based on relatively electron-rich cores (benzene, thiophene, etc.), and the utilization of an electron-deficient heteroaromatic unit has been seldom reported. One representative example has been that Chen and co-workers, who reported acceptors named as BCDT-4X, which were constructed with the electron-deficient benzothiadiazole (BT) unit as the core, achieving an impressive PCE of 12.10%.6 In addition, the halogenation on terminal groups is an essential molecular optimization strategy, and we believe that it remains necessary to further ascertain the role of halogen atoms on the end groups in modulating the molecular packing of unfused-core non-fullerene acceptors.16
Accordingly, we designed and synthesized the A–D–C–D–A type of small molecule acceptor, coded as BTC6-XF (X = 0, 2, 4), employing a benzotriazole (BTA) derivative as an unfused core, where the 2-position of BTA was modified with a long aliphatic chain for good solubility; its 5- and 6-positions were replaced by fluorine atoms for forming the coplanar configuration via F⋯S noncovalent interactions for enhancing the charge mobility. The BTA was flanked with cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophene (DT) as the electron-donor segment (D), which subsequently conjugated with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) as the electron-acceptor segment (A). In particular, BTC6-2F and BTC6-4F were also produced for investigating the effect of end-group fluorination densities on the molecular orientation as well as the photovoltaic performance. As a result, BTC6-4F adopted the most favourable molecular packing and BTC6-4F based OSC achieved a maximum PCE of 11.23%, which is higher than the counterparts BTC6-2F (10.10%) and BTC6-0F (8.49%).
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and thermal properties
The preparation of acceptor materials BTC6-XF (X = 0, 2, and 4) was carried out via a synthetic route shown in Fig. 1a. The Stille coupling of commercially-available 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA-2Br) with (4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta [2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)trimethyl-stannane provided compound 1 in 78% yield. Then, the compound 2 was obtained in a yield of 89% from the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction of compound 1. The key intermediate DT–BTA–DT reacted with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile derivatives (IC, IC-F, and IC-2F) by Knoevenagel condensation to generate the target molecules BTC6-0F, BTC6-2F and BTC6-4F in the high yield of 92%, 90% and 90%, respectively. All total yields in the synthetic route to BTC6-XF are over 60%, which appear relatively high for the preparation of small-molecule acceptors for OSCs. This largely saves the synthetic cost and simplifies the purification process. BTC6-XF was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, and high-resolution MALDI-TOF MS spectra, as shown in Fig. S5 (the ESI†). All BTC6-XF are highly soluble in common organic solvents including dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) as they contain the sufficient number of long alkyl side-chains in the building blocks of both DT and BTA, which is convenient for the fabrication of solution-processed OSCs. To explore the thermal behaviours of BTC6-XF, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)17,18 was performed under the same heating and cooling rates of 10 K min−1 (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). With the increase in the number of F atoms on the terminal groups, the endothermic peak (Tm) of BTC6-0F to BTC6-2F and BTC6-4F gradually increases (from 218 to 226, and 235 °C, respectively) and the exothermic peak (Tc) also increases gradually (from 147 °C to 165 °C, and 186 °C, respectively). Moreover, the exothermic peaks of BTC6-2F and BTC6-4F are far sharper than that of BTC6-0F, indicating that fluorinated end groups are beneficial for enhancing the crystallinity of BTC6-XF.

Grazing-incidence wide-angle (GIWAXS) characterization
The 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization of the BTC6-XF neat and blend films revealed the distinct transition of molecular orientation from edge-on to face-on via changing the number of F atoms on the terminal groups of small-molecule acceptors.19Fig. 1b shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) intensity profiles. BTC6-0F and BTC6-2F neat films both show three obvious lamellar (100) peaks in the OOP direction, and their strongest narrow (100) peak appears at 0.33 Å−1 (d = 19.03 Å) and 0.34 Å−1 (d = 18.47 Å), respectively. It is hard to discern a (010) π–π packing peak in the OOP direction for the BTC6-0F neat film, implying that highly ordered packing with the edge-on dominant molecular orientations is formed; however, an obvious (010) peak at 1.62 Å−1 (d = 3.87 Å) of the BTC6-2F neat film in the OOP direction suggests that it prefers the mixed face-on and edge-on molecular packing. By contrast, the BTC6-4F neat film shows an apparent (010) reflection at 1.76 Å−1 (d = 3.56 Å) in the OOP direction with predominantly face-on molecular packing. The face-on packing ratio of BTC6-4F is obviously enhanced compared with that of the BTC6-0F and BTC6-2F blend films, which probably contributes to a higher PCE. All the BTC6-XF:PBDB-T blend films exhibit strong face-on packing, suggesting that the polymer PBDB-T prefers to adopt a face-on orientation when blended with BTC6-XF. The crystalline coherence lengths (CCLs) of lamellar packing of BTC6-0F:PBDB-T and BTC6-2F:PBDB-T blend films in the OOP direction are calculated (via the Scherrer equation) to be 6.84 nm and 6.08 nm, respectively. In the OOP direction, the CCLs of the (010) peaks of BTC6-2F:PBDB-T and BTC6-4F:PBDB-T blend films are 1.95 nm and 2.74 nm, respectively. In general, the fluorinated terminals provide a new pathway to tune up the molecular packing properties of acceptor materials for BTC6-XF.
DFT calculations
To explore both the molecular geometries and molecular frontier orbits of BTC6-XF, density functional theory (DFT) calculations20 were conducted at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level as shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (the ESI†). Relaxed potential surface energy scans of rotamer BTA–DT in BTC6-XF were also performed.21 From Fig. 1c, we can see that BTC6-XF prefer S⋯F noncovalent interactions to C–H⋯F ones to lock the configuration. Though BTC6-XF adopts the unfused-ring core backbone, an extraordinary planar configuration still is achieved from the side view.
Optical properties
The normalized UV–vis absorption spectra of BTC6-XF in the film and in CHCl3 solution (∼10−5 mol L−1) are shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S4 (ESI†).22BTC6-XF solution samples show similar strong absorptions in the 550–800 nm region, but a strong absorption redshift is clearly seen from BTC6-0F to BTC6-2F, and BTC6-4F in the films. The BTC6-2F film has two comparable strong peaks at 700 nm and 781 nm, while the strongest peak is shown at 685 nm for the BTC6-0F film and at 781 nm for the BTC6-4F film. This probably indicates that the molecular packing changes gradually from BTC6-0F to BTC6-2F, and BTC6-4F. The optical band gaps were calculated, respectively, to be 1.43 eV for the BTC6-4F film (λonset of 868 nm), 1.44 eV for the BTC6-2F film (λonset of 859 nm), and 1.48 eV for the BTC6-0F film (λonset of 837 nm) from their absorption onsets. These results suggest that the higher fluorination density on the end group of BTC6-XF may lead to different molecular orientation and lower energy bandgaps.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of BTC6-XF were investigated by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV),23 which can determine the oxidation and reduction potentials of electroactive analytes, and the curves are shown in Fig. 2b. Based on the onset values of the oxidation potential (0.549 V) and reduction potential (0.361 V) of Fc/Fc+ in acetonitrile with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, the LUMO/HOMO levels of BTC6-0F, BTC6-2F and BTC6-4F were calculated to be −3.71 eV/−5.47 eV, −3.80 eV/−5.52 eV and −3.86 eV/−5.56 eV, respectively; the energy bandgaps are 1.76 eV, 1.72 eV and 1.70 eV, respectively (summarized in Table 1).

Photovoltaic performance
To characterize the photovoltaic properties of BTC6-XF, devices with a traditional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:BTC6-XF/PDINO/Al were fabricated (Fig. 2c). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices are displayed in Fig. 2d, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2 and Table S1 of the ESI.† The Voc values are respectively 0.87 V for BTC6-0F:PBDB-T-based OSC, 0.81 eV for the BTC6-2F:PBDB-T-based OSC, and 0.79 eV for the BTC6-4F:PBDB-T-based OSC. Although the BTC6-0F-based device had a higher Voc, its Jsc (17.99 mA cm−2) was the lowest. The Jsc values are 19.32 mA cm−2 for BTC6-2F and 19.81 mA cm−2 for BTC6-4F, respectively. The fill factor (FF) values recorded from the three acceptors also exhibit different values, of 54.2% for BTC6-0F, 64.14% for BTC6-2F, and 71.65% for BTC6-4F. As a comprehensive result, the highest PCE is from the BTC6-4F-based OSC (11.23%), compared with the BTC6-2F-based OSC (10.10%) and the BTC6-0F-based OSC (8.49%).

External quantum efficiency (EQE)
As shown in Fig. 2e, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve of the PBDB-T:BTC6-4F-based device shows very high EQE values in the broad wavelength region of 450–800 nm and a maximal EQE of 71% at 710 nm, which indicates efficient photon harvesting. For the EQE curve of the PBDB-T:BTC6-2F-based device, a maximal EQE of 69% appears at 550 nm, and for the PBDB-T:BTC6-0F-based device, a maximal EQE of 63% is seen at 680 nm. The integrated current densities were 19.62, 19.11 and 17.11 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T:BTC6-4F, PBDB-T:BTC6-2F and PBDB-T:BTC6-0F-based OSCs, respectively, which agree well with the Jsc from the J–V measurements.
Charge transport, separation, and extraction properties
Additionally, we studied the charge generation, transport, dissociation, extraction and recombination properties for BTC6-XF-based devices. The charge-transport properties of the optimized PBDB-T:BTC6-XF blend films were investigated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method24,25 with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:BTC6-XF/MoO3/Ag for hole-transport and ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:BTC6-XF/PDINO/Al for electron-transport measurements (see Fig. 3a and b). The hole- and electron-mobility values of the PBDB-T:BTC6-0F blend film were found to be μh = 2.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 1.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 1.51; the carrier mobility values of the PBDB-T:BTC6-2F blend film were found to be μh = 3.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 2.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 1.15; and the charge mobility values of the PBDB-T:BTC6-4F blend film were found to be μh = 5.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 5.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 1.09. The enhanced and more balanced charge transport property of the PBDB-T:BTC6-4F blend film was probably due to its favourable face-on molecular packing.

(c) Dependence of light intensity on Jsc for the optimized devices. (d) Dependence of light intensity on Voc for the optimized devices. 
To investigate the charge generation, dissociation and extraction process of the PBDB-T:BTC6-XF-based devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) was characterized as presented in Fig. 2f.26,27 At a high reverse voltage (Veff > 1.5 V), the three devices reach the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat, indicating that all the photogenerated excitons dissociate efficiently into free charge carriers and are collected by electrodes with minimal charge recombination. The Jsat value of the BTC6-4F-based cell is 21.87 mA cm−2, higher than that of the BTC6-0F- (20.12 mA cm−2) or the BTC6-2F-based cell (20.24 mA cm−2), suggesting that BTC6-4F can absorb more incident photons and achieve more efficient exciton generation than BTC6-0F and BTC6-2F. In the case of the short circuit, the charge dissociation probability can be estimated from the ratio of Jph/Jsat, which is calculated to be 90%, 86%, and 77% for the BTC6-4F-, BTC6-2F-, and BTC6-0F-based devices, respectively. From BTC6-4F, and BTC6-2F to BTC6-0F, the devices show reduced Jph/Jsat values, suggesting that excitons in the BTC6-0F-based cell have a larger probability of recombining than dissociating into free charge carriers than they do in the BTC6-2F- and BTC6-4F-based cells.
Charge recombination dynamics
To study their charge recombination properties, we analysed the impact of the light intensity Plight on the photovoltaic parameters (Jsc and Voc) via varying Plight from 1 to 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3c and d).28,29 The Plight dependence of Jsc is described as Jsc ∝ (Plight)s, which reflects the bimolecular charge recombination conditions in the devices. All the devices show s values at around 0.96, suggesting that all blends have a similar degree of bimolecular recombination. The slope (n) of kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge) for Vocversus Plight is recognized as a good indication of the trap-state-assisted charge recombination. The calculated n values are 1.25, 1.16, and 1.15 for devices based on BTC6-0F, BTC6-2F, and BTC6-4F, respectively, verifying that the trap-assisted or monomolecular recombination may occur as well as bimolecular recombination in the three devices. The most serious charge recombination in the BTC6-0F-based device should be connected to its decreased optical performance and results from the unsuitable molecular orientation.
Morphology characterization
To gain insight into the detailed morphology of the PBDB-T:BTC6-XF blend films, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization were conducted as shown in Fig. 4.30,31 The domain size of the BTC6-4F neat film is larger than that of the BTC6-0F and BTC6-2F films, which is probably due to the stronger crystallinity of BTC6-4F. The RMS value for the BTC6-0F, BTC6-2F and BTC6-4F blends is 2.67 nm, 2.26 nm and 3.14 nm, respectively. Although the BTC6-XF:PBDB-T blend films all have similar rough surfaces, we can still observe clear interpenetrating networks in the three blends, as evidenced by TEM images, which are beneficial for efficient charge transfer in the devices.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a series of A–D–C–D–A type non-fullerene acceptors BTC6-XF, which were characterized by the electron-deficient benzotriazole (BTA) as an unfused core to conjugate with the end groups through cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophene. The effects of fluorine atoms on the end groups were fully studied on the molecular packing modes and the photovoltaic properties of the corresponding devices. It was suggested that the change of the halogen atom number on the terminal of the acceptors leads to different ratios of face-on to edge-on stacking, largely affecting the crystallinity and morphology characteristics, and moreover enhancing the charge transport, dissociation and recombination properties to improve the photovoltaic performances. Using polymer PBDB-T as the donor to pair with the three new acceptors, OSCs based on BTC6-0F, BTC6-2F and BTC6-4F achieved, respectively, a PCE of 8.94%, 10.10% and 11.23%, demonstrating that the tuning of molecular packing is an effective strategy to improve the device performance. This work helps in understanding the relationships between the molecular packing and the optical behaviour, and provides molecular design guidance for efficient non-fullerene acceptors in OSCs in the future.
