    , Accepted 16th June 2014First published on 16th June 2014AbstractThis review provides an overview of recent research on chemical sensors based on polymer composites with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene (G) for quantitative and qualitative analysis in diverse application fields such as biosensing (DNA, enzymes, proteins, antigens and metabolites), and chemical and gas sensing using electrochemical and optical detection methods. Both CNTs and G show outstanding electrical, chemical, electrochemical and optical properties that make them ideal candidates for use in chemical sensors. The incorporation of polymers into the development of this type of sensor not only improves the CNT and G dispersion, but also enhances some of their properties like redox behaviour and biocompatibility, and provides additional properties such as photoelectric or swelling capacity. Moreover, unique synergistic effects arising from the combination of the matrix and nanofiller contributions are described by means of several examples highlighting the most important achievements in this field. Special emphasis has been placed throughout the review on analysing the role of the polymer in different sensing platforms. The combination of polymers with carbon nanomaterials for the preparation of chemical sensors opens up exciting areas of research due to their biocompatibility, and excellent sensitivity and selectivity.Horacio J.

1. Introduction
Sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid and cost-effective detection of target molecules are the main drivers for the development of new chemical sensors and biosensors for their use in a wide range of fields from environmental, security, agriculture or food applications, to healthcare including clinic diagnosis and treatment of diseases amongst others. During the last decade the incorporation of nanomaterials into chemical sensors and biosensors has boosted the advances in this area leading to relevant enhancements in their performance.1,2
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene (G) are two of the most innovative nanomaterials with unique electronic, optical, mechanical, chemical and electrochemical properties.3–18 In recent years these novel carbon nanomaterials have been attracting an enormous amount of interest for their use in sensors and biosensors in various transduction modes from electrical and electrochemical to optical detection, and important advantages have been reported with respect to conventional ones.19–38 Among the exceptional properties of these two carbon allotropes, their large surface area, high electrical conductivity and very efficient electrocatalytic behaviour are the most relevant for electrochemical applications. Their excellent fluorescence quenching ability has been exploited in optical sensors. Both nanomaterials have the same composition with sp2-hybridized carbon atoms although with different structures changing from the flat two-dimensional sheet of graphene to the rolling up of graphene sheets in tubes in CNTs. This feature affects their properties and plays a major role in the architecture design of sensors. Differences in the synthetic routes to obtain both carbon materials may also affect the performance of the sensors with, for example, CNTs grown from metallic particles or the variety of graphene materials which are prepared by diverse methods. Moreover, functionalization and control of the surface chemistry of these nanofillers are essential for their use as building blocks in sensors. Of special interest is the biofunctionalization of these nanomaterials with the ability of specific recognition to amplify the detection signal in biosensors.
On the other hand, polymers are one of the most widely exploited classes of materials due to the incredible variety of chemical moieties available and the subsequent compendium of properties, together with their relatively low cost, easy processing, and their potential for recycling and application as sustainable materials. The development of polymeric composites based on CNTs and graphene has drawn a great deal of attention as a route to obtaining new materials with new structural and functional properties superior to those of the pure components and enhanced performance in a broad range of technological fields such as telecommunications, electronics, energy, biomedicine and transport industries.39–46 In particular, these polymer composites may play different roles in chemical sensors and biosensors besides providing mechanical stability and improving the nanofiller dispersion, leading to enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. Although there are a number of recent reviews related to the use of CNTs and graphene in chemical sensors and biosensors,19–38 to the best of our knowledge, there is no report devoted to carbon based polymer composites for this specific application (except for the just published work47 related exclusively to conducting polymer–graphene composites for electrochemical sensors). This is the framework of the present revision in which the added value of incorporating polymers into these carbon nanomaterial based sensors is discussed. Among the different types of chemical sensors and biosensors, we will only focus on electrochemical and optical sensors, and we will revise from 2006 in which the first studies related to the incorporation of graphene into polymers appeared in the literature. After introducing the exciting properties of both CNTs and graphene and the strategies used to efficiently incorporate them into polymer matrices, the synergistic effects of combining these carbon nanofillers with macromolecular systems for their application in different sensing platforms will be highlighted. Relevant examples of different roles of the polymers from coatings or immobilization supports to specific active functions will be shown. Finally, an outlook of future perspectives and challenges of polymer–CNT and polymer–graphene composites for their use in chemical sensors and biosensors will be presented.
2. Polymer composites incorporating carbon nanotubes and graphene
The combination of CNTs and graphene with polymers provides a route to the creation of materials with countless applications almost in a combinatorial manner, because it does not only refer to the combination of two compounds but in the assembly of two families of materials.
2.1. Polymer–carbon nanotube composites
Carbon nanotubes are allotropes of carbon discovered by Iijima in 1991 with a seamless tubular structure formed by curling-up graphene sheets.3 There are two main types of CNTs: single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs), which consist of a single tube of graphene, and multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) that are composed of several concentric tubes of graphene fitted one inside the other. Different techniques have been developed to synthesize CNTs, and detailed information about such methods can be found elsewhere.48,49 CNTs have unique electronic, chemical and mechanical properties that make them leading materials for a variety of potential applications. They are one of the stronger and stiffer materials in terms of strength and elastic modulus4,5 and also display very high electrical6 and thermal7 conductivity as well as thermal stability.8
It is well known that homogeneous CNT dispersion and strong interfacial adhesion with the matrix are critical issues in the development of polymer–CNT composites in order to attain improved properties. Therefore, a significant amount of effort has been directed towards developing methods to modify the surface properties of CNTs, and several review articles have described these functionalization strategies in detail.40,50,51 They can be divided into chemical functionalization and physical methods based on the interactions between the modification molecules and the CNTs. The chemical method involves the covalent bonding (grafting) of polymer chains to CNTs, and can be carried out via “grafting to” or “grafting from” routes. The first approach involves the synthesis of a polymer with reactive groups or radical precursor that is attached to the surface of pristine or functionalized nanotubes by addition reactions; its main disadvantage is that the grafted polymer content is limited because of the relatively low reactivity and high steric hindrance of macromolecules. In the grafting from strategy the polymer is grown from the CNT surface via in situ polymerization of monomers; this process is efficient and controllable, enabling the preparation of composites with a high degree of grafting, although it requires strict control of the amounts of each reactant and the polymerization conditions. Further, during the functionalization treatment a large number of defects are typically generated on the CNT sidewalls that can adversely impact their mechanical properties and even disrupt the electron system. Alternatively, CNT functionalization can be performed by plasma treatment,52 an environmentally friendly method for modifying CNTs by directly introducing a high density of functional groups. In particular, for the functionalization with amine groups, nitrogen containing gases (NH3 or NH3 mixed with N2 or N2/H2) are used, and the CNT surfaces can change from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, thus facilitating the dispersion within the matrix without altering the intrinsic mechanical properties of the tubes.
The non-covalent CNT modification consists of the physical adsorption and/or wrapping of polymers to the surface of the CNTs. The physical adsorption is achieved through van der Waals interactions while the polymer wrapping process occurs via π–π interactions between CNTs and polymer chains containing aromatic rings. This functionalization does not destroy the conjugated system of the CNT sidewalls, and therefore it does not affect the final structural properties of the material. Besides polymers, surfactants have also been employed to functionalize CNTs.53–56 The physical adsorption of the surfactant on the CNT surface lowers the surface tension, effectively preventing the formation of aggregates. Furthermore, the surfactant-treated CNTs overcome the van der Waals attraction by electrostatic/steric repulsive forces. A comprehensive review of the mechanisms behind the improved dispersibility of surfactant-modified CNTs has been reported.57 Another non-covalent method for CNT functionalization is the endohedral method.58 In this approach, guest atoms or molecules are stored in the inner cavity of CNTs through the capillary effect. Typical examples of endohedral functionalization are the insertion of inorganic nanoparticles such as Ag, Au or Pt or small biomolecules such as proteins or DNA.
Several methods have been reported for the preparation of polymer–CNT composites, including solution mixing, melt-blending and in situ polymerization. The most common method is solution mixing because it can be used to prepare small composite films. Typically, it involves three steps:59 dispersion of CNTs in a suitable solvent by mechanical stirring or tip/bath sonication, mixing with the polymer matrix at room or elevated temperatures and finally precipitation or casting of the mixture. This method enables drop casting of films with up to 60 wt% CNT content, although it can result in reagglomeration of the CNTs during the casting/evaporation process. Melt blending is a commonly used technique to fabricate thermoplastic–CNT composites. In addition, it is suitable for polymers that cannot be processed by solution techniques due to their insolubility in common solvents. It uses a high temperature and a high shear force to disperse the CNTs, and is compatible with industrial processes. The main benefit of this method is that it does not require solvents to disperse the CNTs, although it is limited to low filler concentrations. Depending on the final morphology/shape of the composites, the bulk materials can be processed by different techniques such as extrusion or melt-spinning to form a fibre, which frequently results in CNT alignment along the fibre axis. In situ polymerization is an efficient method to disperse CNTs in a thermosetting polymer. The CNTs are initially mixed with monomers, either in the presence or the absence of a solvent, and subsequently these monomers are polymerized through addition or condensation reactions with a curing agent at high temperature. One of the most important advantages of this method is the formation of covalent bonds between the functionalized CNTs and the matrix. Moreover, due to the small size of monomeric molecules, the homogeneity of the resulting composites is higher than those obtained via solution mixing or melt-blending. Likewise, it allows the preparation of composites with high CNT weight fraction.
Another recent approach to incorporate CNTs into a polymer matrix is based on the use of the latex technology.60 Latex is a colloidal dispersion of discrete polymer particles in an aqueous medium. By using this technique, it is possible to disperse CNTs in polymers that are synthesized by emulsion polymerization, or that can be produced in the form of an emulsion. The method consists of the dispersion of the CNTs in an aqueous surfactant solution, followed by mixing of the dispersion with the polymer latex. After freeze-drying and subsequent melt-processing, a composite can be obtained. This route is a safe, environmentally friendly, versatile and low-cost method, and enables incorporation of CNTs into highly viscous matrices. New approaches have been developed in the last few years to obtain composites with high CNT content, including densification,61 spinning of coagulant,62 layer-by-layer deposition63 and pulverization.64
So far, a large number of papers have been reported on the mechanical properties of polymer–nanotube composites, and the improvements attained have been summarized in several reviews.65–69 It has been found that composites incorporating chemically modified nanotubes show better results,68 since the strong interaction between the functionalized CNTs and the matrix greatly enhances the dispersion as well as the interfacial adhesion, thus strengthening the overall mechanical performance of the composite. Further, the polymer grafting strategy seems to be the most effective for improving dispersion and mechanical properties due to the strong chemical bonding between CNTs and polymers.65,70 In contrast, low reinforcement has been found for melt-processed samples incorporating pristine CNTs.67 Composite fibers produced by melt spinning/drawing techniques display better reinforcement compared to bulk samples due to CNT alignment effects. Nevertheless, the improvements attained are in general significantly below the expectations according to the rule of mixtures or the Halpin–Tsai equations, and new functionalization routes/chemical techniques are still required.
On the other hand, CNTs have clearly demonstrated their great potential for enhancing the electrical conductivity of polymers by several orders of magnitude at very low percolation thresholds (<0.1 wt%).67–69,71 The conductivity values attained strongly depend on the nanotube aspect ratio, degree of dispersion and alignment. Thus, CNTs with higher aspect ratio result in significantly lower percolation thresholds. Alignment of the CNTs within the matrix has a detrimental effect on this property, since there are fewer contacts between the tubes, leading to a reduction in electrical conductivity and a higher percolation threshold as compared to composites with randomly oriented nanotubes. Regarding the CNT functionalization, controversial results have been reported.69 While some researchers found reduced conductivity due to disruption of the π-conjugation system, others found an improvement due to better dispersion. It appears that the disadvantages of functionalization with respect to the CNT conductivity can be outweighed by the improved dispersion enabled by functionalization,71 although no general conclusion can be drawn.
With regard to the thermal conductivity, only modest improvements have been reported69,72 which generally fall well below the predictions by the rule of mixtures, attributed to the low thermal conductance of the CNT–polymer interface. The covalent grafting of polymers to CNTs is a strategy to reduce this high thermal interfacial resistance. However, such bonds decrease the intrinsic tube conductivity by acting as scattering centers for phonons propagating along the tubes, and the final results depend on the balance of both factors.69,70 On the other hand, the use of aligned CNTs has been shown to be the most effective for enhancing the polymer thermal conductivity.
A lot of studies have reported improved thermal stability of polymer–CNT composites compared to neat polymers.69,70 The nanotubes hamper the diffusion of volatile products and thereby delay the onset of degradation.73 In particular, it has been found that SWCNTs have higher capability to reduce the mass loss rate of the composite compared to MWCNTs, CNFs or carbon black particles.69
2.2. Polymer–graphene composites
Graphene is an atomically thick, two-dimensional sheet composed of sp2 carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure. It has extraordinary electronic, thermal, optical and mechanical properties9–18 with some values that exceed those obtained in any other materials. Graphene has excellent thermal conductivity (∼5000 W m−1 K−1),12 superior electron mobility (25000 cm2 V−1 s−1),15 the highest electrical conductivity known at room temperature (6000 S cm−1),16 very large surface area (∼2630 m2 g−1), and complete impermeability to any gases.17 It is a zero-gap semiconductor material, electroactive and transparent.18 Moreover, graphene, with a Young's modulus of ∼1 TPa and ultimate strength of 130 GPa, is the strongest material ever measured.13 These unique properties make graphene an ideal candidate for a variety of applications such as sensors, batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, photovoltaic devices, composites, photocatalysis, and flexible electronic devices amongst others.11,43,44,74,75
It is important to note that the term “graphene” used in the literature includes a wide range of graphene-like structures which differ in the preparation method and consequently in the chemical structure (usually the oxidation level), shape, size and number of layers. In fact, there exist several methods employed to prepare graphene, each with specific characteristics of dimensions, shape, quantity and quality.9,11,76–83 Therefore the production methods are strongly related to the final application to which the graphene is directed.11
From the standpoint of polymer composites, the excellent mechanical and electrical properties that graphene would confer to the polymer matrices are critical for obtaining lightweight materials with superior performance. Consequently, polymer–graphene composites continue to attract a considerable amount of interest due to the outstanding properties encountered with only small quantities of nanofiller incorporated into the polymer matrix.84–86 The main reason for this lies in the nano-level dispersion of large surface-to-volume ratio fillers when compared to micro- and macro-scale additives. Outstanding properties are achieved with small quantities of filler producing lightweight materials with low density. Apart from its intrinsic outstanding properties, graphene may be the best filler for lightweight polymer composites due to its highest aspect ratio in 2D sheets with lateral dimensions in the micro-scale and only one atom thick. In comparison with carbon nanotubes, graphene sheets have higher surface-to-volume ratios owing to the inaccessibility of the inside surface of the nanotubes to the polymer molecules. The graphene–polymer composites have shown the potential to rival or even surpass the performance of their carbon nanotube-based counterparts.43–46,87–92 Further, graphene is obtained from naturally occurring graphite implying that lighter composites can be produced at lower costs. Consequently this area of research has grown to represent one of the largest classes within the scope of materials science, and is rapidly becoming a key area in nanoscience and nanotechnology offering significant potential in the development of advanced materials in multiple and diverse application areas.
In order to efficiently transfer the graphene properties to the matrices in composites the key aspects are related to the molecular-level dispersion of graphene into the matrix and the strength of the graphene–polymer interface. In order to be “compatibilised” with polymers, graphene must be appropriately modified with adequate functional groups able to interact with specific chemical moieties in polymeric matrices, prior to their incorporation into the matrix. Control of the size, shape and surface chemistry of the reinforcing graphene is essential in the development of materials that can be used to produce devices, sensors and actuators based on the modulation of functional properties.
However, the low intrinsic reactivity of graphene limits the interfacial interactions with the polymer affecting the load transfer across the interface and the performance of the composites. Graphene oxide (GO) is an alternative for use in polymer composites due to the presence of specific functionalities in the graphitic sheets. However, the main limitation of using GO is the formation of structural defects and vacancies that disrupt the sp2 network and dramatically worsen the electronic properties.82 The reduction of GO restores the conductivity albeit, as some defects or vacancies are irreversible, it remains lower than that of pristine graphene. In this sense, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) brings together features of both graphene and GO and may lead to materials with reasonably good conductivity, thermal stability and processability.
Bearing all this in mind, it is clear that the possibility to functionalize graphene and graphene derivatives, covalently or through supramolecular interactions, to tailor their compatibility with the polymer matrix and get stable dispersions is an efficient route to enhance the final properties of the composites. The extensive previous work developed with other structurally similar carbon nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes and fullerenes, has paved the way for the chemical modification of graphene.
Among the strategies addressed to modify graphene, similar to CNTs the covalent linkage between graphene and polymers, either by grafting from46,93–95 or grafting to96,97 approaches, represents an interesting alternative for polymer composites.98 In this type of material the concept of interface changes from a traditional view of molecular interactions between components at a polymer–filler interface (e.g. van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, etc.) to the concept of a single compound where graphene forms an integral part of the matrix.99 Moreover, click chemistry reactions have been recently successfully used to modify graphene for its incorporation into polymer composites.100–102 Click reactions are wide in scope, general, orthogonal, and easy to perform; only readily available reagents are used, and they are insensitive to oxygen and water. Finally, an alternative approach is the non-covalent modification, which enables the attachment of molecules through π–π stacking or hydrophobic (van der Waals) interactions, preserving the intrinsic electronic properties of graphene.46
The different strategies employed for graphene dispersion and functionalization influence, to a large extent, the mechanical, thermal, and electrical performance of the polymer–graphene composites.44–46,98,99
The three main strategies used for CNT based composites have also been reported for the preparation of polymer–graphene composites: melt-blending, solution-mixing and in situ polymerization of monomers.46,99 The first approach involves the direct mixing of graphene with the polymer in the molten state and subsequent extrusion or injection moulding. It has the advantages of the absence of solvents and industrial applicability previously commented. However, the use of melt blending has been limited due to the thermal instability of most chemically modified graphenes and that the dispersion of the filler is substantially inferior to that obtained using solution methods. The solution-mixing method is the most efficient to ensure good dispersion of the filler. It involves the dispersion of graphene in an appropriate solvent, the mixing between the previous solution/dispersion with a polymer-containing solution in the same (or miscible) solvents and the precipitation of the composites by addition of a non-solvent or, alternatively, the elimination of the solvent by evaporation or distillation. In the case of using GO or modified-GO as a filler an intermediate step is applied which consists of the chemical reduction of GO to RGO in the presence of the polymer that stabilises the reduced graphitic sheets avoiding their re-aggregation. In the in situ polymerization strategy, graphene is first dispersed in the liquid monomer (or pre-polymer), the initiator (or curing agent) is then added and subsequently the polymerization (or curing) is started either by heat or radiation. This strategy generates very efficient interactions between the filler and the polymer matrix through covalent bonds.
Regarding the final performance of the composites the mechanical properties may be the most addressed.45,46 However, although electrical conductivity has also been widely studied, thermal conductivity and gas barrier effects have been analysed to a lesser extent. Here it is worth noting that these properties are not all equally sensitive to the source of graphene, in terms of the structural integrity of the sp2 network. While mechanical properties are normally improved independent of the graphene source employed, the quality of graphene is extremely important for both thermal and electrical conductivity since sp3 defects or vacancies scatter electrons and phonons.103
The high modulus of graphene, which is much higher than that for polymers, and the large surface area of the platelets allow a substantial increase in the mechanical properties of the composites.45 In general, improvements in mechanical performance are related to the graphene dispersion. Also, the mechanical properties increase with graphene loading up to a certain limit value, where platelet aggregation occurs thus leading to a decrease in the aspect ratio as well as to the creation of crack points.
The electrical conductivity is one of the most important challenges when graphene/composites are prepared. In these systems the bulk conductivity of insulating polymers increases by several orders of magnitude when an appropriate amount of graphene is added, following normally a percolation behavior. In other words, to achieve electrical conductivity, the concentration of graphene must surpass the electrical percolation threshold, where a conductive network of filler particles is formed.104
In the case of thermal conductivity, its improvement is also related to the contact between particles that reduces the thermal resistance. Although in principle the thermal conductivity in graphene–polymer composites can be rationalized with percolation theory,45 the increase in the thermal conductivity has been more modest than in the case of electrical conductivity and much higher graphene loading is needed to obtain a reasonable improvement in the thermal conductivity.105 This is believed to be due to the much smaller differences between the thermal conductivity of graphene and polymers (compared with electrical conductivity). In most of the cases reported the thermal stability of the composites is improved.
3. Chemical sensors based on polymer composites
3.1. Chemical sensors based on polymer–carbon nanotubes

3.1.1 Optical sensors. 
The discovery in 2002 of the band-gap fluorescence of SWCNTs106 has motivated the use of these nanomaterials for optical sensing, particularly for biological systems. Their fluorescence in the NIR region (between 820 and 1600 nm), where absorption of biological tissues is generally negligible, inherent photostability and tissue transparency107 are attractive characteristics for the design of in vitro and in vivo sensors. The main mechanisms by which a target molecule can selectively modify their fluorescent (or photoluminescent) spectra are changes in emission wavelength and intensity caused by solvatochromism,108 charge-transfer109 and/or doping and redox reactions.110 The dielectric environment around CNTs affects polarizability and can provoke a solvatochromic shift in the absorption and emission spectra. An analyte could change the dielectric environment directly, by replacing solvent molecules or by changing the conformation of the polymer-wrapping. The charge-transfer mechanism occurs when the analyte orbitals overlap with SWCNT/wrapping orbitals. Electron transfer leads to a change of ground states or excited states, which affects the fluorescence spectrum via altered rates of exciton quenching. In the doping and redox reactions, the analyte changes the number of defects of the carbon lattice and thus exciton decay routes. The key challenge is the modification of the nanotube surface in order to be selective for the analyte of interest. In the following section, we review the most recent advances in the development of optical sensors based on polymer–CNT composites, making special emphasis on the role of the polymer. The most representative examples reported to date on this topic are collected in Table 1.

In most of the studies summarized in Table 1, the polymer is used to non-covalently functionalize or wrap the CNTs.111–120 The non-covalent functionalization of SWCNTs with water-soluble polymers112,115,116,118,120 or polysaccharides111,114,117 is an efficient strategy for producing stable CNT-based sensing materials in aqueous media. Many of these studies are based on the change in the NIR emission spectra of the SWCNTs, as explained above. Some of them focused on the development of continuous in vivo glucose sensors, which would help to alleviate different diabetes related problems. The main goal is to maintain blood glucose levels at physiological concentrations, and current sensors lack accuracy in reporting real concentrations. For example, Barone and Strano111 developed a sensor that operated based on the competitive binding between this analyte and phenoxy-derivatized dextran, a polysaccharide that acts as a glucose analogue for a protein binding site (Fig. 1A). First, the SWCNTs were wrapped in the polymer derivative via solution mixing. The subsequent addition of concanavalin A (conA), a plant lectin with four saccharide binding sites at physiological pH, provoked aggregation of the dextran-coated SWCNTs and decrease in their NIR fluorescence proportional to the conA concentration. The introduction of glucose caused dissolution of the aggregate along with a fluorescence recovery due to competitive binding between the glucose and the polymer for conA binding sites. The lineal response of the fluorescence vs. glucose concentration was found to be between 3.8 and 11 × 10−3 M, hence it needs to be engineered to response in the physiological range of 2–30 × 10−3 M. A more recent study on polymer–nanotube-based glucose sensors utilizes allosteric changes in conformation to modulate SWCNT fluorescence emission.112 In particular, SWCNTs wrapped in carboxylated-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were grafted to glucose binding protein (GBP) by covalently linking the carboxylic groups of the polymer to amine groups of the lysine moieties of the protein (Fig. 1B). In the presence of glucose, the attached GBP undergoes a conformational change from an open to a closed structure as it absorbs a glucose molecule that results in a decrease of the SWCNT fluorescence. This fluorescence is recovered as the GBP returns to its initial open state, releasing the glucose molecule and demonstrating the sensor reversibility.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of polymer-wrapped SWCNT systems used for glucose detection: (A) introduction of concanavalin A (ConA) to phenoxy-derivatized dextran-wrapped SWCNT initiates nanotube agglomeration, resulting in a decrease in nanotube fluorescence. The addition of glucose, which binds to ConA, separates the nanotube bundles with the recovery of fluorescence. (B) PVA-wrapped SWCNT is covalently tethered to GBP. Upon addition of glucose, the GBP undergoes a conformational change, resulting in a change in the SWCNT fluorescence intensity.

Systems based on polymer-wrapped CNTs that selectively detect analytes like nitric oxide (NO) have also been developed, and the first was prepared by coating SWCNTs with 3,4-diaminophenyl-functionalized dextran via five synthetic steps in solution followed by dialysis.114 The polymer wrapping imparted rapid and selective NIR fluorescence detection of NO by the donation of lone-pair electrons from amines that conferred more electron density and mobility to the SWCNTs. The resulting sensors were capable of spatiotemporally detecting NO produced inside macrophage cells by activation of the NO synthase within the cells. The detection limit of the dextran–SWCNT hybrid was 7 × 10−8 M, about 12 times larger than that obtained with metal–fluorescein probes. Further optimization can be expected by varying the number of diamino groups per polymer chain. Zhang et al.115 tried to synthesize a PVA-wrapped SWCNT composite for the detection of NO. However, the NIR fluorescence of this compound remained unaltered in the presence of the oxide, which could be due to the direct reaction between the analyte and the polymer through its hydroxyl groups. Another plausible explanation might be pore blocking due to the formation of organo-nitrite after reaction with NO. In contrast, the PVA–SWCNT fluorescence was quenched by reducing agents such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), L-ascorbic acid and melatonin. The authors suggested that these molecules donate electrons directly to the conduction bands of PVA–SWNT, and extra electrons in the conduction bands can then quench excitons through a non-radiative Auger recombination.121 Regardless of the mechanism, the above-mentioned examples demonstrate that the type of polymer adsorbed on the CNTs strongly influences the selectivity of the complex, and this has important implications for the sensor applications of carbon nanotubes. The same authors have designed a SWCNT probe for adenotriphosphate (ATP) detection.116 In that study, luciferase enzyme was conjugated to the carboxylic acid group of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) that wrapped the SWCNTs. Upon exposure of this complex to ATP in the presence of D-luciferin, the luciferase on the SWCNTs selectively converted ATP to adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP) and simultaneously oxidized D-luciferin to oxyluciferin, which quenched the SWCNT NIR fluorescence. This sensor has high sensitivity, with a LOD of 2.4 × 10−7 M ATP. Moreover, it presents high selectivity towards ATP even in the presence of potentially interfering molecules such as AMP, adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP), cytidine 5′-triphosphate (CTP) and guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP). The capability of this sensor to spatially and temporally detect ATP in living cells was also demonstrated, making it the first CNT-based optical sensor for the recognition of ATP in vivo. Another example of biosensing polymer–SWCNT systems based on the quenching of the NIR fluorescence has been reported by Reuel et al.117 They fabricated a sensor array using recombinant lectins as glycan recognition sites tethered via histidine tags to Ni2+ complexes that acted as fluorescent quenchers for semiconducting SWCNTs wrapped in a chitosan hydrogel (Fig. 2). They used an automated printing method to develop the sensor chips. Thus, alternating layers of chitosan-wrapped SWCNTs and glutaraldehyde were printed and allowed to crosslink overnight. The crosslinked hydrogel acted as a polymer matrix and provided an immobilized support to the embedded SWCNTs. This sensor allows measurement of binding kinetics of model glycans in real time similar to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. Its detection limit was found to be 2 μg of glycosylated protein or 100 ng of free glycan to 20 μg of lectin.

(A) The chitosan wrapped SWCNT sensors are processed to include tethered NTA groups and chelated Ni2+ so that His-tagged lectins can attach to the sensors.

The formation of surfactant–polymer complexes that wrap the SWCNTs is another strategy employed for the development of pH optical nanosensors, which show promising applications for intracellular monitoring. This approach relies on combining CNTs previously suspended in cationic or neutral surfactants with a polymer that can be polymerized in situ to entrap the nanotube–surfactant micelles. The surfactant–polymer system provides an efficient and stable barrier between the SWCNTs and their local environment. Duque et al.113 wrapped SWCNTs in sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) and mixed them with biocompatible poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). NIR fluorescence spectra of the composites demonstrated their linear response in the pH range of 1–6. Further, their effectiveness as sensors in the surface of live human embryonic kidney cells was demonstrated, and a model was proposed that accounts for the photoluminescence stability of these systems based on the morphological changes of PVP at different pH values.
Other studies dealing with SWCNTs wrapped in fluorescent–polymer derivatives investigated the changes in the UV-Vis spectra of the fluorescent polymer after binding to the SWCNTs.118,120 In this regard, Nakayama-Ratchford et al.118 used non-covalently functionalized SWCNTs with fluorescein–PEG in aqueous solution. The hydrophobic aromatic moiety of fluorescein interacts with the CNT sidewalls via π–π stacking, whilst the hydrophilic groups of PEG interact with water, resulting in highly stable complexes even after heating to 70 °C for 2 days. The polymer functionalization imparts solubility to the nanotubes in physiological buffers and simultaneously affords fluorescent labels. Plots of fluorescence vs. pH revealed a linear behaviour in the range of 5.7–8.5 pH, indicative of the suitability of these systems for detection, imaging and cell sorting in biological applications. Similar sensors for saccharide recognition were developed by Mu et al.120 by wrapping SWCNTs in phenyl boronic acid (PBA) conjugated to a polyethylene glycol, eight-membered, branched polymer (PPEG8), which allows aqueous dispersion of the CNTs. Upon addition of a fluorophore, the complex became fluorescent in the UV-Vis region. Further addition of saccharide resulted in a decrease in the fluorescence intensity that was proportional to the amount of saccharide, leading to a LOD of 1 × 10−2 M. The synthesized PBA–PPEG8 polymers demonstrated strong saccharide binding selectivity. Thus, by conjugating different recognition groups to the amphiphilic polymers, sensors for specific saccharides could be developed.
Sensors based on conductive polymers like polyaniline (PANI)119 and acid-functionalized MWCNTs have been recently synthesized by in situ polymerization using sulphonic acid as a dopant. Very uniform wrapping of PANI over the CNTs was attained, resulting in highly transparent and water soluble composites. Fluorescence measurements in the UV-Vis region revealed their suitability for pH sensing in the range of 1–12. Moreover, the pH dependent change in the oxidation state of the PANI was easily reflected by the change in the colour of the composite solution, which can be efficiently used for the development of colorimetric pH sensors.
Optical sensors based on CNTs covalently functionalized by polymers have also been fabricated. Ghini et al.122 described the covalent anchoring of carboxylic-acid functionalized MWCNTs to fluorescein (Fluo)–PEG derivatives via in situ polymerization. This type of functionalization was found suitable for providing water solubility to the system while preserving the fluorescence properties of the dye. The use of polyether spacers between the dye and the nanotube surface was used to reduce fluorescence quenching effects.
Other sensors involve a polymer that acts as a matrix123,124 or immobilization support.125,126 In this regard, Barone et al.123 developed a glucose-responsive hydrogel-based sensor, since they found that hydrogel swelling is a mechanism that can reversibly induce solvatochromic shifting in the SWCNT NIR emission. The CNTs were embedded in a PVA hydrogel via solution mixing followed by addition of different amounts of glutaraldehyde that acted as a crosslinking agent in the presence of H2SO4 as a catalyst. As the cross-linking density and hydration state of the hydrogel increased, the Raman G-band shifted to higher wavenumber, indicating deformation of the nanotube lattice, while the SWCNT fluorescence decreased in energy. The data were well-described by a model that accounts for changes in dielectric screening of the 1D exciton as the osmotic pressure induces conformational distortions in PVA by rotating more polar groups to the nanotube surface. Cross-linking with apo-glucose oxidase made the hydrogel glucose responsive, showing a fast and reversible response to the repeated cycling of 1 × 10−2 M glucose. As a proof of concept, these sensors were implanted into a mouse tissue, demonstrating an excellent signal-to-noise ratio of 8.6. Similarly, Ahn et al.124 prepared a sensor for protein detection based on SWCNTs embedded within a chitosan matrix bearing an NR,NR-bis(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine (NTA) chelator (Fig. 3). With this scaffold, Ni2+ can bind and tether a hexahistidine tagged (His-tag) protein, which is directly reflected in a decrease in the SWNT NIR fluorescence intensity. This modulation results from changes in the intermolecular distance between the SWCNT and the Ni2+ ion, which acts as a proximity quencher of the fluorescence. This sensor shows a detection limit of 1 × 10−11 M and can also analyze protein–protein interactions.

(B) Optical and NIR fluorescence image of the SWCNT–CS array.

Aqueous polymeric gels are typically used in optical measurements to provide an inert immobilizing environment. This approach was used by Cognet et al.125 who developed a biosensor using sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS)-wrapped SWCNTs embedded in agarose gel. These composites exhibited reversible stepwise quenching of the SWCNT NIR fluorescence after exposure to acid, base, or diazonium reactants, providing highly efficient sensing of local chemical and physical perturbations. Therefore, they are useful for detecting local pH gradients in restricted environments, such as microfluidic channels or organelles inside biological cells. Analogously, Chen et al.126 prepared an assay for protein detection based on SWCNTs functionalized with PEGylated phospholipids (DSPE-3PEO). A carboxylated PEG was grafted onto a gold-coated surface for protein immobilization. Proteins such as anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (anti-HSA IgG) were immobilized on the assay surface and detected either by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) using the G-mode intensity or by conventional fluorescence. The detection limit using SERS was about 1 fM, a three order of magnitude improvement compared to fluorescence-based detection.


3.1.2 Electrochemical sensors. 
The unique chemical and physical properties of CNTs have paved the way for new and improved sensing devices, in general, and electrochemical sensors, in particular.19–22 CNTs have huge surface area, high mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity and efficient electrocatalytic behaviour.
Polymer–CNT composite based electrochemical transducers offer substantial improvements in the performance of amperometric methods. Selection of the working electrode material is an important step in the development of electrochemical sensors. There are several strategies for the modification of electrodes directed to improving the sensitivity and selectivity of electrochemical sensors. The presence of polymers and CNTs allows different architectures on the electrode surface, which enable a greater active surface, improved immobilization of the targets and a more efficient electron transfer. In this section, we will show different strategies to combine polymers with CNTs in order to create electrochemical sensors with enhanced performance. The most representative examples reported to date on this topic are listed in Table 2.

CNTs have been dispersed directly in several polymers such as Nafion,127 polystyrene (PS)128 or chitosan (CS),129–133via sonication to obtain a stable suspension by means of a wrapping process, or these polymers have been embedded in the network structure formed by CNTs or covalently grafted to the CNT surface. Nafion has been extensively applied as an electrode modifier due to its excellent antifouling capacity and powerful adsorption ability. In a recent study, Nigović et al.127 have identified two drugs, morphine and ondansetron, which coexist in biological fluids in patients receiving chemotherapy. The electrochemical behaviour of ondansetron was studied using a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with the MWCNT–Nafion polymer composite (MWCNT–Nafion/GCE). The oxidation peak potential was shifted from 1.32 V to 1.18 V compared to the bare electrode indicating excellent electrocatalytic activity of the immobilized film toward the drug molecule. The modified electrode exhibited noticeably enhanced voltammetric response due to the synergistic effect of the nanomaterial and polymer on the electron transfer rate. Also, the MWCNT–Nafion/GCE showed a high selectivity in the voltammetric performance of ondansetron and co-administered drug morphine with a potential difference of 430 mV. In this example the polymer was used not only as a binder to form a stable and uniform film with well dispersed CNTs at the electrode surface but also exploiting its adsorption capability. Nafion has also been used in the immobilization of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) facilitating the manufacture of an electrochemical biosensor of H2O2 with an Au electrode modified with a suspension of PS and MWCNTs.128 PS improved the enzyme stability and electrode selectivity, enabling an excellent electrocatalytic activity to the reduction of H2O2, with a linear response in the range of 5.0 × 10−7 to 8.2 × 10−4 M and a LOD of 1.6 × 10−7 M.
Chitosan (CS) is one of the most utilized biopolymers to disperse nanocarbon materials. It is a natural cationic polysaccharide that displays a number of properties including biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, non-toxicity, good mechanical stability, cost-effectiveness, and availability of reactive functional groups for chemical modifications. In this context, much research has been focused on the preparation of CNT–CS composites as platforms to develop sensors for pharmaceutical, environmental and biotechnical applications.129–133 Babaei et al.129 modified a GCE with a MWCNT–CS composite for the sensitive voltammetric detection of morphine (MO) and dopamine (DA) in human blood serum or urine. CS improved the electrode stability due to its antifouling properties, high mechanical strength and water stability as well as the electron transfer, enabling the simultaneous qualitative and quantitative determination of DA and MO under physiologically relevant conditions. A very similar approach was reported by Wu et al., who prepared a MWCNT–CS modified GCE to easily and rapidly detect Sudan I in hot chili powder samples.130 Sudan I is a synthetic azo-colorant widely used in waxes and textile colorants, shoe polishes and food additives that is a potential carcinogen and mutagen in humans. The biopolymer enhanced the adsorption of the analyte and the sensitivity of the electrode, leading to a LOD in the order of 1.0 × 10−8 M.
The use of ionic liquids (ILs) in electrochemistry to prepare modified electrodes has widely increased because of their high chemical and thermal stability, low toxicity, high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical potential window and the enhanced sensitivity response.134,135 Over the last few years, the preparation of modified electrodes with room-temperature ionic liquids and composites has attracted considerable attention in order to combine their unique advantages to develop electrochemical devices. For example, Kianipour and Asghari131 modified a glassy carbon electrode in the presence of CS, MWCNTs and 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetra-fluoroborate (EMIM-BF4) as an ionic liquid, for the simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AAC), uric acid (UA), acetaminophen (AP), and mefenamic acid (MEF), in human serum and urine samples, by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The presence of CS in the modified electrode improved the sensor repeatability due to its antifouling effect and led to more current peak separation between the analytes, enhancing the sensor selectivity.
A more complex sensor based on CS, MWCNTs and an ionic liquid has been developed by Shahdost-fard et al.132 They prepared a highly sensitive adenosine aptasensor based on the covalent attachment of an aptamer onto the MWCNT–IL–CS composite. CS improved the dispersion ability of the IL, leading to uniform CNT distribution within the composite. The developed sensor showed lower cost, improved sensitivity, linear range and stability compared with other aptamer-based sensors that require a specific label. The obtained LOD was very low, about 1.5 × 10−10 M.
The introduction in the architecture of the electrode of metal nanoparticles that interact with the polymer–CNT mixture provides new environment detection. In this regard, Li et al.133 prepared a H2O2 biosensor based on a glassy carbon electrode modified with a composite composed of CS–MWNTs, hemoglobin (Hb) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The authors reported that the presence of AgPNs and MWCNTs increased the electron transfer between Hb and the electrode surface. Chitosan was not only used as a solubilizing agent for the MWCNTs but also provided a favorable microenvironment for hemoglobin in the composite acting as an immobilization matrix. The Hb in the composite exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of H2O2, leading to a selective sensor with a LOD of 3.5 × 10−7 M.
Conducting polymers (CPs) are of great interest for sensor applications as they can be interfaced with some molecules for effective signal transduction. CPs provide an excellent platform upon which to build biorecognition and/or signal transduction for the target analyte.136,137 Different strategies have been developed for the formation of composite electrodes with these CPs like oxidative polymerization in a CNT–monomer mixture and electropolymerization onto the surface of the electrode or electrode/CNTs.
A sensitive amperometric sensor for the detection of hydroquinone (HQ) in cosmetics138 was developed based on the excellent electrocatalytic properties of MWCNTs and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT. Acid-treated MWCNTs were dispersed in deionized water, and the monomer and subsequently FeCl3·6H2O were added to the above suspension, which was drop-cast on the carbon paste electrode (CPE). The authors concluded that the polymer–MWCNT composite considerably decreased the oxidation potential of hydroquinone and increased the charge transfer rate constant compared to the bare electrode, enabling very sensitive detection of HQ, with a LOD of 3.0 × 10−7 M, significantly lower than some related reports. The same authors used the PEDOT–MWCNT/CPE in the manufacture of a sensor for determining nitrobenzene in real wastewater samples, where the role of the polymer was also to enhance the electrocatalytic activity.139
Among the conducting polymers commonly used, polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy) have been the most widely investigated. For example, a biosensor based on the inhibition of enzymes has been used for the amperometric detection of organophosphorous compounds, paraoxon, in the presence of MWCNTs coated with PPy.140 The PPy–MWCNT composite improved the enzyme adsorption and allowed very low amperometric detection without the use of a mediating redox potential, enhancing the sensor stability and reproducibility. Due to the high porosity of the polymer and the high electrical conductivity of CNTs, a detection level of 3.0 × 10−9 M could be achieved. Another amperometric biosensor based on PPy–MWCNT composites covered by Prussian blue (PB) has been developed by Jin et al.141 for enzymeless H2O2 detection. PB has been extensively studied for its attractive electrochemical properties and applications in the field of biosensors since it exhibits good performance for H2O2 electroreduction. PPy–MWCNT nanofibers were prepared by an in situ chemical oxidative polymerization process.142 TEM images of MWCNT–PPy composites reveal that PB nanoparticles (about 12–24 nm size) were randomly and homogeneously deposited on the surface of MWCNT–PPy nanofibers. Thus, the PPy enabled the control of the size and morphology of the PB nanoparticles deposited onto the electrode. The synergistic effect among MWCNTs, PPy and PB improved the performance of the modified electrode for the H2O2 detection, showing good sensitivity, wide linear range (4.0 × 10−6 to 5.2 × 10−4 M) and low LOD (8.0 × 10−8 M).
Min and Yoo143 have developed a composite, SWCNT–PPy, which acts as the electrode itself without support of an additional electrode like Pt or GCE. The composite electrode was prepared by chemical polymerization of the monomer onto carboxylic-acid functionalized-SWCNTs using LiClO4 as an oxidant. For biosensor applications, tyrosinase (Ty) was covalently attached to the functionalized SWCNTs, and the Ty–SWNT–PPy electrode was prepared in a similar way. The SWCNTs were thickly coated by the polymer and the SWNT–PPy composite exhibited many surface pores that could improve mass transfer. This electrode showed a large specific surface area and a highly reproducible current response, about 100 times larger than that of the GCE. The composite increased the amount of enzyme loading and the frequency of contacts between the electrode surface and electrons, thereby enhancing the electron transfer rate. The Ty–SWCNT–PPy composite electrode was used for amperometric detection of dopamine in the presence of ascorbic acid and showed high sensitivity and a low detection limit, 5.0 × 10−6 M.
PANI is, perhaps, the preferred polymer for electrochemical sensor applications due to its electrical conductivity, stability, facile synthesis and significant redox behaviour. Several studies have shown improvements in the performance of enzymatic sensors by depositing PANI–CNT composites onto electrodes. For example, Lee et al.144 prepared a new nanomaterial, by grafting a layer of sulfonated polyaniline network (SPANI-NW) onto the surface of amine functionalized MWCNTs, and effectively utilized for immobilization of an enzyme, glucose oxidase (GOD), and for the fabrication of a glucose biosensor. There are few limitations on the use of PANI, as the loss of electroactivity at pHs greater than 4.0. Moreover, SPANI is electroactive even at physiological pH and, in this case, the interconnected polymer network morphology would provide an adequate microenvironment for the immobilization of an enzyme. In situ polymerization of a mixture of diphenyl amine 4-sulfonic acid (DPASA), 4-vinyl aniline (VA) and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid (APASA) was performed in the presence of MWNT–NH2. GOD was immobilized onto MWNT–SPANI-NWs to fabricate the biosensor, with good performances for the electrochemical determination of glucose.
Hua et al.145 have developed a PANI–MWCNT composite by blending the emeraldine base form of polyaniline and carboxy-functionalized MWCNTs in dried dimethyl sulfoxide. The FT-IR spectra, SEM images and conductivity values confirmed the deposition of PANI on the MWCNT surface and the doping of the PANI by the weak protonic acid of the carboxylic groups and the radical cations of MWCNT fragments. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was immobilized within the composite modified Au electrode to form HRP/PANI–MWCNT/Au for use as a H2O2 sensor. The synergistic effect between protonated PANI and functionalized MWCNT causes that only a minimum amount of enzyme, 6.6 μg mL−1, is required for detection, the lowest reported to date for this type of sensor. The HRP/PANI–MWCNT/Au for H2O2 detection exhibits a broad linear detection range with a detection limit of 8.6 × 10−6 M.
Cross-linking and conjugation of biomolecules to different kinds of substrates is extensively used in biosensors. A conventional method for immobilization of NH2-containing biomolecules onto carboxyl-containing substrates via covalent amide bonds consists of the use of the N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) catalytic system.146 The EDC/NHS activation strategy has many merits: high conversion efficiency, mild reaction conditions, excellent biocompatibility with small effect on the bioactivity of target molecules, and much cleaner products than other crosslinking reagents such as glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde. Due to these advantages, EDC/NHS activation of carboxylic acids and the following amidation reaction have been commonly applied in biomolecular conjugation and immobilization of proteins, DNAs, and so forth to many kinds of substrates like polymers147–149 or carbon nanotubes.150,151 Using EDC/NHS chemistry, Dhand et al.152 have electrophoretically deposited a composite of PANI and MWCNTs onto an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass plate for covalent immobilization of cholesterol oxidase, CHOX. Results from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) revealed that the anodic peak around 0.28 V, which corresponds to the oxidation of PANI, increases with the cholesterol concentration. This behaviour suggests that CHOX gets electrically contacted by the PANI–MWCNT modified electrode. The direct acceptance of electrons by the composite is attributed to enhanced charge transport due to electron hopping through the conductive MWCNTs that mediate electron transfer via the redox polymer. The CHOX/PANI–MWCNT/ITO bioelectrode can detect cholesterol in the range of 1.29 × 10−3 to 1.29 × 10−2 M with high sensitivity and a fast response time.
A simple and versatile method to assemble dispersed CNTs into thin-films is the layer-by-layer (LBL) technique, which consists of the repeated, sequential immersion of a substrate into solutions of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. This approach can result in composites with high nanofiller weight fraction and controlled internal structure, having the potential to reach the desired properties through tailored design. Thus, it is possible to obtain a homogeneous, porous, and three-dimensional CNT multilayer film with a large surface area provided by the assembly procedure that is repeated many times.153–155 Using this approach, Gao et al.156 developed a glucose biosensor based on a composite made by LBL electrodeposition of a redox polymer, cross-linked [Os(bpy)2Cl]+/2+complexed poly(1-vinylimidazole) (PVI-Os), into a multilayer containing glucose oxidase (GOD) and SWCNTs on the surface of a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). To facilitate the adsorption of the negatively charged GOD and SWCNTs, the SPCE was functionalized with cationic PVI-Os by electrodeposition. The aim of the electrodeposition of the redox polymer was to stabilize the multilayer and to wire the GOD. Fig. 4 shows the effect of the number of layers on the current signal by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As can be seen, the optimal number of layers is five, since after the sixth layer the signal decreases. Therefore, modified SPCEs with five layers of GOD/SWCNT/PVI-Os were used as biosensors for glucose determination. The developed biosensor showed a linear range from 0.5 to 6.0 × 10−3 M and a detection limit of 1.0 × 10−4 M. To evaluate the electrode selectivity, the amperometric current responses to uric acid 0.32 mM, ascorbic acid 0.05 mM, and acetaminophen 0.20 mM were examined together with glucose. AP exhibited no response. In contrast, large current responses were observed for AAC and UA. To solve the problem, Nafion was added on the surface of the composite-modified electrode, eliminating interference due to AAC and UA.

The potential scan rate was 10 mV s−1. Inset: structure of the redox polymer PVI-Os. Reprinted from ref. 156, copyright 2011, with permission from Elsevier. 
The LBL approach has also been employed to develop a composite film incorporating SWCNTs, PPy and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that modified an Au electrode as a voltammetric sensor to sensitively detect epinephrine (EP) in the presence of AAC and UA.157 The catalytic peak currents obtained from differential pulse voltammetry increased linearly with increasing EP concentration in the range of 4.0 × 10−9 to 1.0 × 10−7 M with a LOD of 2.0 × 10−9 M. The hybrid composite displayed a synergistic effect that strongly catalyzed the electrooxidation reactions of EP and UA, enhancing their electrochemical reversibility and oxidation peak separation. Therefore, the PPy–AuNP–SWCNT-modified Au electrode can selectively determine EP in the coexistence of a large amount of UA and AAC.
Electropolymerization offers several advantages compared to other methods, in particular the absence of catalyst other than the electrode, direct grafting of the doped film onto the electrode surface, in situ characterization by different techniques and easy control of the deposit properties. Polymers can be electrogenerated at CNT electrodes or CNTs can be attached to the electrode during electropolymerization. Many examples demonstrate the use of this approach in the specific electrochemical detection of relevant molecules.158–169 For example, an electrode composed of MWCNTs and poly(3-methylthiophene), P3MT, was developed by Agüí et al.158 using this approach. MWCNTs were dispersed in Nafion and dropped on a GCE. Then, the modified electrode was immersed into 3-methylthiophene monomer solution and the electropolymerization was performed by CV. Thus the modified electrode improves the amperometric NADH detection due to the synergistic effect of the electrocatalytic properties and the high active surface area of both the conducting polymer and the MWCNTs. This P3MT–MWCNT–(Nafion)/GCE electrode provides fast responses, a linear range between 5.0 × 10−7 and 2.0 × 10−5 M and a detection limit of 1.7 × 10−7 M. The same authors developed a lactate biosensor using a similar method.159 Both designed biosensors158,159 showed good repeatability of the measurements, good reproducibility in the inter-biosensor assays and a good selectivity, especially when they were coated with a Nafion film. The synergistic effect of the composite constituents towards the electrocatalytic oxidation of NADH allowed the bioelectrodes to operate at low potential values without the need for redox mediators, improving the analytical performance in comparison to similar biosensors incorporating only CNTs or conducting polymers.
The electropolymerization of PANI on CNTs can also develop electrochemical sensors with superior performance. For instance, Yadav et al.160 developed a creatinine biosensor based on a mixture of creatinineamidohydrolase (CA), creatineamidinohydrolase (CI), and sarcosine oxidase (SO) coimmobilized covalently by EDC/NHS chemistry onto an electrodeposited carboxylated MWCNT–PANI composite film. A schematic representation of the chemical reaction of the modified electrode is shown in Fig. 5. The comparison of the cyclic voltammograms of electrodeposition of pure PANI and the MWCNT–PANI composite revealed that the composite led to higher currents than the polymer counterpart, which was ascribed to its larger effective surface area, hence more conductive pathways that allow for faster kinetics. Therefore, the MWCNTs, acting as electron transfer mediators, help to enhance the enzyme sensor response and to increase the sensitivity of the biosensor. The use of the MWCNT–PANI composite provides a large surface area for the immobilization of CA, CI and SO, leading to a creatinine biosensor with good analytical performance in terms of low working potential, short response time, sensitivity, and high storage stability. Using the same approach, these authors developed a highly sensitive and rapid oxalate biosensor by covalently immobilizing oxalate oxidase enzyme onto an electrodeposited MWCNT–PANI composite via EDC/NHS chemistry.161

Electropolymerization has also been employed by Tiwari et al.162 for the preparation of a composite electrode incorporating PANI and polyacrylic acid (PAA) deposited on a Nafion–MWCNT membrane supported over a Pt electrode. Nafion has hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions and can wrap around the hydrophobic nanotube surface, and hence it is found to be an ideal medium for MWCNT dispersion, enabling the formation of a homogeneous composite. Further, the Nafion–MWCNT membrane forced self-organization of PANI–PAA during electropolymerization with the MWCNTs acting as nucleating agents, increasing the crystallinity of the system. The sensor was applied to determination of ascorbic acid with a LOD of 2.5 × 10−7 M. The same analyte, AAC, has been determined with a sensor based on PANI doped with silicotungstic acid (SiW12) and SWCNTs.163 This modified electrode was prepared through one-step electropolymerization of the suspension of SiW12 and SWCNTs dispersed in aniline on the electrode surface. The electrochemical polymerization process of PANI, SWCNT–PANI, SiW12–PANI and SiW12–SWCNT–PANI was studied. When SWCNTs were simultaneously deposited in the SiW12–PANI film via electropolymerization, only two couples of redox peaks with increased peak currents appeared (Fig. 6), which is very useful for its electrocatalytic application. The authors proposed that SWCNTs, with exceptional electric conductivity and large π-bonded surface, not only enhanced the electron transfer of the electrode interface but also exhibited strong interaction with the conjugated structure of PANI via π–π stacking, which improved the SiW12 distribution and increased the electron delocalization in the PANI composite. Using the method of the calibration curve, two linear ranges were found with a LOD of 5.1 × 10−7 M. Compared with other studies on the electrochemical determination of AAC with PANI-based electrodes, SiW12–SWCNT–PANI showed better analytical performance in terms of stability, repeatability, wider linear range and lower detection limit.

CuNPs have been added to MWCNT–PANI modified electrodes to develop sensors for the determination of ascorbic acid164 and polyphenols.165 For the preparation of the non-enzymatic AAC sensor,164 aniline was electropolymerized onto an Au electrode through CV, and then the PANI-coated electrode was dipped into a suspension of carboxylated-MWCNTs. The functionalized MWCNTs were covalently attached to the PANI layer by forming amide bonds between their –COOH groups and the free terminal –NH2 groups of PANI. The polymer enhanced the absorption of the nanoparticles onto the carboxylated-MWCNTs, thereby improving the electrocatalytic activity for AAC oxidation. The LSV response of the modified electrode to AAC showed linear dependence in the concentration range of 5.0 × 10−6 to 6.0 × 10−4 M with a LOD of 1.0 × 10−6 M. This superior performance, combined with the ease of fabrication, good reproducibility, stability, rapid response and selectivity to ascorbic acid in the presence of common interfering substances, makes this electrode ideal for routine AAC detection.
For the determination of polyphenols via an enzymatic method,165 the preparation procedure of the carboxylated-MWCNT–PANI/Au was identical to that described above. In this case, CuNPs were electrochemically deposited on the electrode in a 0.1% chitosan solution by cyclic voltammetry. Then purified laccase enzyme was immobilized onto the CuNP–CS–MWCNT–PANI modified gold electrode surface by glutaraldehyde coupling. The fabrication scheme of this biosensor is shown in Fig. 7. When the modified CuNP–CS–MWCNT–PANI/Au electrode was treated with glutaraldehyde, its –CHO group at one end got attached to the –NH2 groups of CS, while the other –CHO group got linked to free –NH2 groups of enzyme through CN bonds, and consequently the enzyme was covalently anchored, Fig. 7. Both polymers played an important role in the biosensor: PANI enhanced the adsorption of the CuNPs, increasing the electroactive area, and CS promoted the attachment of the enzyme. A linear relationship between the current and the tested polyphenol, guaiacol, was found in the concentration range from 1.0 × 10−6 to 5.0 × 10−4 M, with a LOD of 1.56 × 10−7 M.

A stable and sensitive electrochemical sensor for the detection of dopamine, based on the electrodeposited conducting polymer, PEDOT, doped with MWCNTs, was reported by Xu et al.166 The PEDOT–CNT/CPE exhibited good catalytic properties toward the electrochemical reaction of DA, and high selectivity, since it was not affected by the presence of ascorbic acid.
Raicopol et al.167 prepared, in a one-step electropolymerization process, an amperometric glucose biosensor based on a composite of PPy with p-phenyl sulfonate-functionalized SWCNTs in the presence of GOD. The polymer facilitated the enzyme immobilization by entrapment within the electropolymerized film. Upon introduction of a thin film of PB at the substrate electrode surface, the hybrid system showed synergy between the PB and the functionalized SWCNTs, which remarkably amplifies the electrode sensitivity when operated at low potentials. The biosensor displayed good analytical performance in terms of low detection (1.0 × 10−5 M) and a wide linear range (2.0 × 10−5 to 6.0 × 10−3). Another amperometric glucose biosensor on LBL assembled SWCNTs and electropolymerized PPy layers has been reported by Shirsat et al.168 Homogeneous SWCNTs and PPy multilayer films were alternately assembled on a platinum coated polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The GOD was immobilized on the LBL assembled film via physical adsorption by cross-linking through glutaraldehyde. This glucose biosensor exhibited a linear response range from 1.0 × 10−3 to 5.0 × 10−2 M with high sensitivity. Since conducting PPy favors the increase of the amount of SWCNTs on the platinum coated PVDF membrane and imparts superior transducing ability, the LBL approach of PPy and SWCNT provides an excellent matrix for the immobilization of GOD enzyme.
An electrochemical sensor based on the AuNP–MWCNT–poly(1,5-naphthalenediamine) film modified GCE for the detection of cellobiose dehydrogenase gene was reported by Zeng et al.169 The polymer was electropolymerized onto the GCE surface with a large number of amino groups, which enhanced the stability of the modified electrode. The resulting sensor also displayed high sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility, with a detection limit of 1.2 × 10−16 M.
On the other hand, molecular imprinting is a very useful technique to incorporate specific substrate recognition sites into polymers. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are prepared by creating a three-dimensional polymeric matrix around a template molecule. After the removal of the template, the resulting imprinted cavities with complementary shape and functional groups remain.170 The analytical applications of MIPs include different techniques such as chromatography, capillary electrochromatography, extraction and sensors.171 Nevertheless, imprinted materials prepared by conventional methods suffer from some drawbacks since their performances are often limited by slow mass transfer, irregular material shape, thick polymer matrices, and relatively low recognition sites per unit volume of the polymers. To overcome these problems, many approaches have been established to develop surface molecularly imprinting techniques, particularly for systems incorporating CNTs because of their unique properties, including their remarkable electrical, chemical, mechanical, and structural properties. MIP–CNT composites have been used in several fields such as clinic assays,172–176 pharmaceutical177–181 or environmental analysis.182
A surface imprinting biosensor for bovine serum albumin (BSA) detection has been prepared using chitosan-coated magnetic nanoparticle modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MIP–CS–MWCNTs) as a signal amplifier.172 The MIPs were dispersed in CS solution and mixed with acyl-chloride-functionalized MWCNTs, and subsequently the MIP–CS–MWCNT suspension was cast onto the electrode surface. The presence of CS promoted the connection between the MIPs and MWCNTs. Then, a PPy film with the template protein was electrodeposited onto the modified electrode using cyclic voltammetry, and the BSA molecules were trapped within the polymer matrix as a result of their ability to interact with the pyrrole units. When the protein molecules were eluted, a microenvironment for recognition of BSA based on shape selection and positioning of the functional groups was created in the imprinting film. This sensor exhibited a good analytical performance with a wide detection linear range (1.0 × 10−10 to 1.0 × 10−4 g mL−1) and a LOD of 2.8 × 10−11 g mL−1.
Prasad et al.173 have fabricated an electrochemical sensor based on a MIP for the detection of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), an important inhibitory amino acid common in the human central nervous system, at ultra-trace levels by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). Since the γ-aminobutyric acid is a non-electroactive compound, its o-pthalaldehyde/sulphite derivative was used as a template for the imprinting polymer, which was made from 5-fluorouracil-N-acetylacrylamide, FUAA monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, EGDMA, as a cross-linking agent. A very thin MIP film was grown on the surface of the MWCNT–COOH-modified pyrolytic graphite electrode (PGE). Further, the functionalized MWCNTs were abrasively attached to the tip of the PGE, and remained as a stable layer between the electrode surface and the MIP film, providing channelized electron transport that enhanced the binding signal. The resulting sensor showed a linear response in the concentration range of 0.75–205.19 ng mL−1 and the lowest LOD (0.28 × 10−9 g mL−1) compared to other reported methods.
A monolithic molecular imprinting sensor based on a ceramic carbon electrode (CCE) was prepared by Tong et al.174 as a recognition element for cholesterol, one of the most frequently determined species in clinical diagnosis. The sensor was prepared by mixing the MWCNT–MIP composite, graphite powder and silicon alkoxide oxide and subsequently packing the resulting mixture into the electrode cavity of a Teflon sleeve. Since the MIP was homogeneously doped inside the CCE by simply mixing, this sensor could be easily reused by a smoothing treatment in case the surface of the sensor is fouled. The raise in the MWCNT–MIP content led to an increase in the response current due to a larger number of recognition sites on the electrode surface. The sensor exhibited excellent sensitivity with a linear range of 1.0 × 10−8 to 3.0 × 10−7 M and a LOD of 1.0 × 10−9 M.
The discrimination of enantiomers is a complex problem. In this regard, Prasad et al.175 developed a MIP–MWCNT-modified PGE for electrochemical sensing of methionine enantiomers. L-Methionine is one of the sulphur-containing amino acids that rules the main supply of sulphur in the diet, and also prevents disorders in hair and skin. Further, it helps to reduce the cholesterol level by increasing lecithin production in the liver and maintaining normal growth of cells. For this purpose, benzidine and (D- or L-) methionine were initially attached to the surface of MWCNT–PGE via formation of amide bonds and subsequent electropolymerization. During this process, methionine molecules were instantly oxidized to methionine sulfone as print molecules involving electrostatically driven hydrogen-bond linkages in the polymer–template adduct. After methionine sulfone extraction, a molecularly imprinted polymer film was coated over the electrode surface, which had several molecular cavities that selectively encapsulated D- or L-methionine in its oxidized form. The polymer increased the electrode surface area, thereby improving the electron transfer. Further, the combination of MWCNTs and the MIP film imparted high mechanical strength and excellent conductivity. The non-covalent interactions (electrostatic and H-bonding) between the analyte and MIP favoured enantio-selective discrimination between enantiomers, and it was possible to determine L-methionine in the linear range of 11.7–206.3 × 10−9 g mL−1 with a LOD of 2.9 × 10−9 g mL−1. Using a similar approach, the same authors prepared a MIP composite incorporating titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiNPs) and MWCNTs for the modification of a pyrolytic graphite electrode (PGE) as an enantioselective-sensing probe for aspartic acid isomers.176 In this case, the polymer initiator chemically adsorbed on TiNPs was covalently attached with the MWCNT-modified PGE. Analogously, Kan et al.177 prepared a biosensor for dopamine recognition by covalently grafting vinyl functionalized MWCNTs to a MIP matrix (a copolymer of methacrylic acid and trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate (copoly(MAA-co-TRIM))). The presence of MIP enhanced the adsorption dynamics and selectivity for DA. Other MIP-based sensors for the determination of allopurinol (4-hydroxypyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine),178 brucine (an anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug),179 lorazepam (a benzodiazepine that produces central depression of the central nervous system),180 tramadol (a synthetic monoamine uptake inhibitor and analgesic)181 and parathion-methyl (an organophosphate pesticide)182 have been recently developed (see Table 2), and the main role of the polymer was also to improve the adsorption kinetics and the selectivity for the analyte.
The sol–gel imprinting process is a promising way to enhance the performance of MIP films by forming a sol–gel inorganic framework around a template molecule, which leads to a uniformly porous structure. Moreover, the larger number of active sites on the imprinted sol–gel film increases the electrochemical signal compared to a mono-layer modified electrode. In this regard, a rapid, sensitive and selective molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor for quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QCA) determination was successfully constructed, by Yang et al.,183via stepwise modification of the MWNT–CS functional composite and a sol–gel MIP film on the surface of a GCE. The MWNT–CS composite was used to enhance the electron transfer rate and expand the electrode surface area, and consequently amplify QCA the reduction electrochemical response. To prepare the QCA-imprinted sol, QCA as a template and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) as a functional monomer were mixed, following the addition of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a crosslinker. Finally, the MIP modified MWNT–CS/GCE was fabricated by electrodeposition using cyclic voltammetry. The fabricated electrochemical QCA-imprinted sensor using MIP/sol–gel/MWNT–CS/GCE as a working electrode showed good performance with a low detection limit, 4.44 × 10−7 M, good reproducibility and reliability.
Zhang et al.184 proposed a molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor based on electrodepositing MIP sol–gel onto a MWCNT–Nafion modified GCE for the determination of 2-nonylphenol, a toxic xenobiotic compound classified as an environmental endocrine disrupter. In the sol–gel imprinting process, the amino groups of the functional monomer 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) and the benzene rings of the functional co-monomer (phenyltrimethoxysilane, PTMS) provide recognition sites through hydrogen bonds and π–π stacking interactions with 2-nonylphenol. The presence of Nafion was found to be essential for improving MWCNT dispersibility and preparing a homogeneous and well distributed MIP sol–gel film. Under optimal conditions, the sensor showed a linear response from 2.0 × 10−7 M to 3.6 × 10−4 M, with a LOD of 6.0 × 10−8 M.

3.2. Chemical sensors based on polymer–graphene

3.2.1 Optical sensors. 
Due to its extraordinary electrical, chemical, optical and electrochemical properties, graphene is an ideal candidate for use as a transducer in optical sensors and biosensors based on fluorescence, chemiluminescence and colorimetric detection systems.24–27 Among the different graphene forms, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) have advantageous characteristics for use in these optical sensing platforms. Although GO has been reported to be fluorescent and have tunable photoluminescence properties,185,186 it can also quench fluorescence. In fact, both GO and RGO have been reported to be highly efficient fluorescence quenchers with long-range energy-transfer.24,25,187 This property has been exploited in two types of fluorescent based sensors. In “signal-on” sensors the fluorescence intensity increases with the addition of the analyte due to a reaction with the fluorescent label which separates label and GO and can be correlated with the concentration of the analyte. “Signal-off” sensors use fluorescently labelled hybridized probes which are not fully adsorbed on GO but in the presence of the target they quench the fluorescence by adsorption by GO and they have lower sensitivity than “signal-on” sensors. Moreover, GO can also be used in other optical sensors as it has been reported to be a quencher of chemiluminescence and color.25 A detailed description of the different approaches used for the incorporation of graphene into optical sensing applications and the enhancements in performance attained in particular in selectivity, limits of detection, and dynamic ranges can be found in several very recent reviews.22,24,25,27
In this section we will discuss the effort that has been made to incorporate polymers into graphene-based optical sensors and the advantages and improvement of properties due to the macromolecular system. The main aim is to understand the role of the polymer in these sensing platforms. Table 3 summarizes the most representative published data on this subject. Although the number of papers related to optical sensors based on polymer–graphene composites is still scarce, very promising results have already been obtained.

One of the most important effects observed for the combination of a polymer with GO in an optical sensor based on fluorescence detection has been reported by Sheng et al.188 They developed a simple method to detect ochratoxin A (OTA) using graphene oxide as a quencher of the fluorescence of carboxyl fluorescein (FAM) attached to a toxin-specific aptamer. OTA is one of the most abundant food-contaminating mycotoxins which can cause severe effects on human health. The authors designed a “signal-on” type sensor using an aptamer as a recognition agent. Aptamers are selected single-strand oligonucleotides isolated from random-sequence DNA or RNA libraries by an in vitro selection process.189,190 They can bind with high affinity and specificity to target molecules changing their conformation/structure before and after binding. When they are modified with fluorophores these structural changes may affect the fluorescence.189 The strategy used for the detection of ochratoxin A is shown in Fig. 8. Meanwhile in the absence of OTA, the FAM modified aptamer was absorbed on GO via π–π stacking and quenched the fluorescence of FAM, in the presence of the target the aptamer folded to form antiparallel G-quadruplex structure which was resistant to adsorption onto the surface of GO. The fluorescence intensity could be measured as a function of OTA concentration. The sensing strategy showed excellent selectivity for OTA against other structure analogues but showed poor sensitivity due to some unspecific adsorption of the target onto GO. In order to prevent this effect, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) was used as a coating material of GO. The ratio of PVP concentration to GO was optimized to be higher enough to prevent the adsorption of OTA and increase the concentration of these molecules in the solution but not as high as to eliminate the adsorption of the aptamer as shown in Fig. 9. Using this approach the limit of detection decreased from 1.9 × 10−6 M of the non-protected GO-based biosensor to 1.87 × 10−8 M in the PVP-protected and the linear range from 2 × 10−6 M and 35 × 10−6 M to 5 × 10−8 M and 50 × 10−8 M. In this case the role of the polymer, although it was only as a coating material, proved to be crucial to lower the LOD of the sensor by two orders of magnitude.

In other strategies the polymer plays a more active function as it occurs when cationic conjugated polymers (CCPs), which are fluorophores, have been combined with GO in order to amplify the fluorescence response in the sensing platform.191,192 Xing et al. developed a DNA sensor based on poly[(9,9-bis(6′-N,N,N-trimethylammonium)hexyl)-fluorenylene phenylene dibromide] (PFP), GO and a fluorescein (FAM)-labeled single-stranded DNA (P).191 The design of simple, reliable and amplified nucleic acid sensors is of great interest because of its importance in medical diagnosis, gene expression analysis and biomedical studies. Conjugated polymers have been used to amplify the detection of DNA due to their light harvesting properties since more than a decade ago based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism which involves the transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore.193,194 However these sensors are limited by high background fluorescence which can be attributed to nonspecific electrostatic interactions between the DNA probe and CCP. These authors introduced GO in a traditional CCP based platform to reduce the background signal.191 The polymer was PFP which is suitable as a donor in FRET. They observed that in the absence of the target (DNA) the fluorescence intensity of P was quenched after the addition of GO due to the strong adsorption of P on the GO surface and the quenching effect of GO. When PFP was added to the P–GO complex the FRET from PFP to P was inefficient indicating that PFP could not release P from the GO surface. In the presence of target DNA, P hybridized with its target and upon the addition of PFP, strong FRET was observed (Fig. 10). Moreover, they found a very important effect on the fluorescent response of the P–GO–PFP system depending on the order of incorporation of P and PFP. If P was added to the PFP–GO complex, efficient FRET was obtained in contrast to the inefficient FRET observed when PFP was added to the P–GO complex as shown in Fig. 11. Based on all these findings they optimized the experimental conditions of the system and concentration of the components and reduced significantly the background signal by introducing GO but maintaining the role of the polymer amplifying the fluorescence. The LOD was as low as 4 × 10−11 M, which is more than one order of magnitude lower than those previously reported for DNA detection methods using PFP.195–197 The same authors demonstrated that this principle could be extended for the detection of other targets and they designed a low background and amplified signal platform for K+ based on the same system.192 In the presence of K+, P formed a G-quadruplex which separated P from GO and upon addition of PFP a FRET signal was observed. An enhanced sensitivity and selectivity was obtained opening up new expectations for further applications of the combination of GO with cationic conjugated polymers in biomedical analysis.

Reprinted from ref. 191, copyright 2013, with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
Very recently Zhang et al. have also combined GO with a conjugated polymer in an optical sensor but with a completely different approach.198 They developed a hybrid organic–inorganic fluorescent system to detect 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in aqueous solution by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The hybrid was prepared by introducing poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) by ion exchange and in situ polymerization (PPV–MSN). They functionalised the MSN surface with amino groups and by the reaction between the COOH groups of GO and the NH2 groups of PPV–MSN they obtained the hybrid material (GO–PPV–MSN). The GO–PPV–MSN had a good dispersion and strong fluorescence in aqueous solution which is essential for sensors to be applied in environmental applications. In this strategy the polymer was encapsulated in the channels of the mesoporous nanoparticles in order to avoid the direct interaction with GO with the corresponding fluorescence quenching and maintain the fluorescence properties in the hybrid material. They observed that in the presence of the target the amino groups of the surface of PPV–MSN bound TNT molecules from solution by forming the Meisenheimer complex and this complex strongly suppressed the fluorescence emission of the hybrid GO–PPV–MSN through the FRET mechanism. They also measured that the quenching efficiency was higher for GO–PPV–MSN than for PPV–MSN with TNT. Therefore, the incorporation of GO improved the detection sensitivity, being the LOD of TNT of 1.3 × 10−7 M in the hybrid material besides increasing the water solubility.
Another route by which polymers have been introduced in optical sensing platforms based on graphene is molecular imprinting technology.170,199–204 Liu et al. prepared an optosensing platform based on a molecularly imprinted polymer incorporating quantum dots (QDs) and graphene oxide for highly selective and sensitive specific recognition of vitamin E (VE).199 Quantum dots are nanometre scale semiconductor crystals which have unique optical and photophysical properties and have been widely applied in optical sensing and biosensing.205,206 In this system the authors combined the fluorescence characteristics of both CdSe–ZnS QDs and GO and added an ionic liquid (IL) to the surface of GO in order to improve its fluorescence stability and the binding with the QDs. The material was prepared in a one-step polymerization reaction using AA as a functional monomer, EGDMA as a crosslinker and 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator including the reaction with VE driving template molecules into the surface of the composites. When the VE was removed by solvent extraction, imprinting binding sites were left in the composites that selectively bound the target (VE). The sensor was based on the changes in fluorescence intensity due to VE binding and ascribed to fluorescence quenching between VE and MIP. The method showed high selectivity, sensitivity and fluorescence stability with a detection range and limit indicated in Table 3. In another example the MIP was incorporated into a graphene quantum dots (GQDs) sensor for determination of para-nitrophenol (4-NP).200 Graphene quantum dots are graphene sheets smaller than 100 nm with very interesting characteristics such as high fluorescent activity, low toxicity and excellent water solubility.207 The MIP was based on APTES as a functional monomer and TEOS as a crosslinker and prepared by sol–gel polymerization on GQDs to coat the nanomaterial. The fluorescence of MIP-coated GQDs was efficiently quenched when interacted with 4-NP. This novel fluorescent sensor showed stable fluorescence, rapid response, good recognition specificity, wider linear range and lower detection limit (Table 3) for environmental applications. In all these sensors the role of the polymer was to enhance selectivity by its high selective recognition and capture capabilities.
On the other hand, polymer–graphene composites have also been used in chemiluminescence-based sensors. Huamin et al. developed a flow injection chemiluminescence (FI-CL) sensor for the detection of sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) using the chitosan–graphene oxide-molecular imprinted polymer (CG-MIP) as a recognition element.201 Again the MIP was introduced in the chemiluminescence (CL) analysis to improve the selectivity and chitosan–GO was used to improve the adsorption capacity. The SMZ–CG-MIP system was prepared in acetone using AA as a functional monomer, EGDMA as a crosslinker and AIBN as an initiator. The CL sensor had improved selectivity and sensitivity. Chen et al. prepared an electrochemiluminescence biosensor for glucose based on the graphene–Nafion–glucose oxidase modified glassy carbon electrode.208 The performance of this sensor was enhanced in comparison with the Nafion–GOD modified electrode. It was determined that the incorporation of the reduced graphene oxide accelerated the charge transfer. In another example of an CL sensor, the Ru(bpy)32+–graphene–Nafion modified electrode was developed for oxalate analysis.209 In both cases the role of the polymer was to modify the electrode and the incorporation of graphene into the composites enhanced the electroluminescence.
Finally, polymers have also been combined with graphene in colorimetric-based sensors. A very interesting example has been recently reported by Wang et al. in which polydiacetylene (PDA) and graphene were prepared as stacked composite films for the detection of environmentally hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs).210 Polydiacetylenes are π-conjugated polymers which exhibit an intense chromatic change from blue to red in response to external stimuli such as temperature, solvent, mechanical stress and ligand–receptor interactions.211 Due to their properties PDAs have been employed as sensing platforms for the detection of biologically, environmentally and chemically important target molecules.211 However, these PDA sensors have some limitations such as low sensitivity and difficulties for precise quantitative information. The combination with graphene provided an efficient and transparent support for the assembly of PDA increasing the absorbing area of gaseous molecules that enhanced the colorimetric signal of PDA. The composite films were prepared by self-assembly of diacetylene onto graphene sheets (GS) and polymerized by UV. The chromatic change observed in the presence of VOCs corresponded to conformational changes in PDA due to the interactions with VOCs which were clearly observed by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM).


3.2.2 Electrochemical sensors. 
From an electrochemical point of view the potential scope of graphene electrodes is enormous since they maintain the properties of other carbonaceous materials like potential windows, inert electrochemistry, and good electrocatalytic activities for many redox reactions, while they provide new properties like high surface area and ultrafast charge mobility, which ensure high sensitivity and rapid response. The fundamental aspects of graphene electrochemistry28–31 as well as the room of graphene electrodes in sensing32–35,37,212–214 are beyond the scope of this review and the readers are directed to the aforementioned literature.
For electrochemical sensors, the utilization of graphene based polymer composites may combine the advantageous electrical, electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties of graphene with the countless functions of polymers very different in nature ranging from natural to synthetic or conventional to conducting polymers. In this section we will focus on the enhancements of graphene-based electrochemical sensors attained upon addition of different types of polymers. Table 4 represents the most representative examples on this subject reported so far.

Thus, in some cases the graphene–polymer electrodes for sensing are composed of MIPs that have been previously described. The advantages of MIPs lie in the rapid and low-cost synthesis and the possibility of tuning the selectivity by means of the appropriate selection of templates in the imprinting process.215–218 In addition, the use of a thin layer of MIP on the electrode surface as a recognition element of the sensor greatly improves the electrode selectivity.
In the case of electrochemical sensors the MIP consists principally of a conducting polymer like polypyrrole219–221 and derivatives of polyaniline,222,223 where the polymer is prepared by electropolymerization in the presence of the target (Fig. 12). For example, a trimethoprim (TMP) sensor has very recently been prepared by electropolymerization of pyrrole on a graphene oxide-modified glassy carbon electrode.219 Here the polymer plays a dual role since it acts as the template of the recognition element and also as a transducer of the signal. Moreover they also may play a dual role in both the sensor electrode preparation and the electrode performance. In the first case GO serves as a site where the analyte is immobilized during the preparation of the MIP because the high concentration of oxygen-containing groups on GO ensures strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the TMP. In addition, graphene improves the sensitivity of TMP detection as it significantly increases the peak current response measured by square wave voltammetry (SWV). A LOD of 1.3 × 10−7 M was obtained. Since trimethoprim is an antibacterial drug widely used in the prophylaxis and treatment of urinary, intestinal and respiratory infections, the authors succeeded on its quantification in urine samples.

In another very recent study, the MIP PPy was integrated with graphene and Au nanoparticles and the composite was employed for sensing of levofloxacin (LEV), another antibacterial agent.220 While the role of the MIP is again the recognition element, the incorporation of the metal nanoparticles clearly ensures higher electrode surface that significantly increases the analyte signal. The authors deeply evaluated other variables during the MIP preparation (template/monomer ratio, number of polymerization cycles), template molecule elimination (type of solvent) and sensing (supporting electrolyte and incubation time) and they established the optimal conditions for LEV determination. They used differential pulse voltammetry as the detection method, obtaining a LOD of 0.53 × 10−6 M. Moreover, the authors studied the selectivity of the PPy–RGO/AuNP modified electrode by determining the responses of LEV in the presence of some interfering substances like chlorotetracycline, oxytetracycline, prulifloxacin and norfloxacin, and found that these species do not mask the LEV response proving the selectivity conferred to the sensor by the MIP. A composite electrode similar to both examples described above has been employed to determine quercetin, a flavonoid with antioxidant power, by DPV.221
Liu et al. have reported a sensor of a tetracycline antibiotic (chlorotetracycline, CTC) based on an electrogenerated MIP, poly(o-phenylenediamine) (POPDA) and RGO that combines the response amplification of RGO and the special recognition of the MIP.222 In this sensor the [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− redox pair is used as an indirect electrochemical probe. The authors demonstrated that the oxidation of [Fe(CN)6]3− to [Fe(CN)6]4− did not take place when the template molecules were in the cavities of the polymer and it was recovered after template removal. Using DPV they found a linear correlation between the peak current variation of the [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− redox pair and the concentration of CTC in the range of 10 to 500 μM and also succeeded in the determination of CTC in tap and wastewater samples.
POPDA was also employed in an electrochemical sensor for the determination of cefotaxime (CEF), displaying a rather more complex composition.223 The bare GCE was first covered by a film of RGO having COOH groups at the edges (RGO–COOH). Then a dispersion composed of gold networks in an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazoliumtetrafluoroborate, [BMIM][BF4]) and porous platinum nanoparticles (PPNPs) was coated on the modified electrode. Finally, the OPDA was electropolymerized in the presence of CEF by cyclic voltammetry. Here, the RGO–COOH and the metal particles increase the electrode surface area leading to an increase in the current signal whilst the polymer plays again a recognition role. All variables including the concentration of each electrode component, the template/monomer ratio, the polymerization time, the incubation time and pH were optimized. Under optimal conditions the sensor displayed a linear response to CEF in the range of 3.9 × 10−9 to 8.9 × 10−6 M (Fig. 13). The performance of the MIP was evaluated in the presence of some interference that can be present in real samples like glucose, AAC, UA and glutamic acid, showing high selectivity to CEF. In addition, the interference of similar compounds such as ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone was assessed and the MIP proved to be selective to CEF.

The inset shows the calibration curve of CEF. Reprinted from ref. 223, copyright 2014, with permission from Elsevier. 
Beyond molecules of biological interest, a similar system was used to detect some pollutant like 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP).224 The electrode preparation is slightly different from the examples described above. First GO was dispersed in an ethanol solution containing APTES to produce amino-functionalized GO. Then the imprinting step was conducted by oxidative polymerization of o-phenylenediamine (OPDA) with ammonium peroxodisulfate (APS) in the presence of DNP. Then the GO–POPDA was drop-cast on the bare electrode. The authors optimized parameters such as the thickness of the GO–POPDA film, pH, accumulation time and scan rate and obtained linearity in the range 1.0 × 10−6 M to 1.5 × 10−4 M of DNP. Regarding selectivity, the MIP–GO electrode works very well in the presence of inorganic ions (Na+, K+, Fe3+), typical organic interfering compounds, such as m-dihydroxybenzene, p-aminobenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, phenol, 3- and 4-nitrophenol. However similar compounds like nitrophenols (at 10-fold concentrations) were found to affect the determination to some extent as the nitro groups can also be reduced near the reduction potential of DNP.
Moreover, there is one example where a copolymer of methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethylene glycol methacrylate, prepared by free radical polymerization, is employed as a MIP in electrochemical sensors.225 In this case, a composite of graphene sheets non-covalently functionalized with Congo red (GSCR) and poly(MMA-co-EGDMA) has been used to detect one of the most studied molecules with biological functions, the neurotransmitter dopamine. The Congo red (CR) is used to improve the solubility of graphene and the absorption of the target DA. The combination of an MIP with graphene sheets ensures outstanding recognition performance, rapid adsorption kinetics due to high ratio of surface-imprinted sites and large aspect ratio because there are a great number of effectively imprinted sites distributed along the GSCR-MIP surface. The electrode was tested in complex solution containing epinephrine and AAC, the principal interference of DA, and it showed good selectivity.
Other studies used a composite electrode of different graphene derivatives with non-molecularly imprinted conducting polymers such as PANI226–228 and its derivatives,229 PPy230,231 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).232
Luo et al. reported the preparation of a water-dispersible PANI–graphene composite by in situ polymerization of aniline on the surface of poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS) coated graphene nanosheets (PSS-GS).226 Sulphonic acid has been widely employed as a PANI dopant to achieve good electroactivity at physiological pH233,234 and recently sulphonated graphene (SG) has also been used for this purpose.235 In the present paper the PSS coated graphene plays the same role. Moreover, the PANI–graphene composite displays fast electron transfer and catalytic capability for the oxidation of AAC with a LOD of 5 × 10−6 M.
Similarly Bao et al. reported the preparation of nanostructured PANI microsheets by chemical polymerization with APS in the presence of GO, which serve as templates.227 GCE-modified PANI–GO composites were used for the simultaneous determination of AAC, DA and UA, because they displayed strong, moderate and no electrocatalytic effect for AAC, DA and UA, respectively, that permitted separation of the electrochemical response of the three analytes.
A similar system based on the electropolymerization of PANI nanowires (PANIw) on a GO-modified GCE has been successfully employed for DNA sensing.228 The polymer nanowires confer to the electrode high effective surface area, thereby increasing its sensitivity. The sensing electrode was prepared in two steps: first, the PANIw–GO–GCE was immersed in a solution of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) probes to immobilize it on the electrode. Then, the ssDNA–PANIw–GO–GCEs were immersed in the hybridization phosphate buffer solution containing the target DNA. For the sensing test the well-known electroactive hybridization indicator, daunomycin, was employed. Because the DNA assay is directly related to the surface coverage of DNA probes on the electrode, the behaviour of DNA hybridization can be affected by daunomycin. When hybridization happens, daunomycin is intercalated in the DNA duplex, which can show the electrochemical response compared with single-stranded DNA. The modified electrode displayed certain selectivity towards the specific DNA target and a linear range with the logarithmic values of the target sequence concentration from 2.12 × 10−6 to 2.12 × 10−12 M, with a LOD of 3.23 × 10−13 M.
Yang et al. reported the preparation of a composite of poly(aminobenzenesulphonic acid) (PABSA) and RGO by simultaneous polymerization of ABSA and reduction of GO via the pulse potentiostatic method.229 They used electrodes modified with this composite to detect target genes. For example, they immobilized specific probe DNA via π–π stacking interaction between the conjugated composite and DNA bases. In this case the original electrochemical response of the composites disappeared (signal-off) because of the DNA on the surface blocked the electron transfer of PABSA–RGO. However, the hybridization between the probe pDNA and target complementary cDNA induced the product hybridized DNA to be released from the conjugated composite, accompanied by the self-signal regeneration of the composite (“signal-on”) (Fig. 14). Ultimately, they used the Bode plots obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for the detection of the promyelocytic leukemia–retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML–RARA) gene sequence (Fig. 14), obtaining a very low limit of detection of 3.7 × 10−17 M.

Ye et al. prepared a sensor of nitrite composed of a composite of PPy and RGO dispersed in a 0.5 wt% CS solution.230 The natural polymer appears positively charged in acidic solutions due to the protonation of –NH2 groups in the polymer, and therefore CS attracts negatively charged nitrite ions (NO2−), in order to concentrate it on the electrode surface. On the other hand PPy promotes the electrochemical oxidation of NO2−, whilst graphene guarantees high surface area and electrical conductivity.
A PPy derivative, poly(2,5-di-(2-thienyl)-1-pyrrole-1-(p-benzoic acid)) (PDPB), has been employed in immunosensing.231 The polymer was incorporated into a complex system with RGO, AuNPs, aflatoxin B1 antibody (AntB1) and the ionic liquid, 1,3-di(isobutyl)imidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. PDPB plays a key role as it covalently binds the specific antibody, contributing to the sensor stability. Although the polymeric film reduces the electron transfer to some extent, the presence of RGO and AuNPs recovers it. The [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− redox probe was used to quantify the aflatoxin B1 by Faradaic impedance spectroscopy obtaining a LOD in the order of fmol L−1.
A composite of PEDOT with RGO has also been employed for biosensing.232 The sensor was prepared by simultaneous polymerization of EDOT and reduction of GO by cyclic voltammetry in the presence of ascorbate oxidase enzyme. The obtained graphene–PEDOT composite meets properties of graphene and the polymer like large specific area, high conductivity, good biocompatibility, and fast redox properties. As an enzyme model, ascorbate oxidase (AO) was entrapped onto the film-modified electrode and used to construct an electrochemical AAC biosensor. The modified electrode showed good electrocatalytic performance towards ascorbic acid with high selectivity, wide linear range as well as good reproducibility and stability.
Also a natural polymer CS has been used in composites with graphene for sensing purposes.236,237,238 The main role of CS is the biocompatibilization with the target analyte and has been utilized covalently linked to chemically modified graphene (CMG) for the determination of DNA236 or in a multicomponent sensor with graphene, sulphonated poly(ether–ether–ketone) (SPEEK) and AuNPs for the detection of glucose.237
On the other hand, composites of the diverse forms of graphene with non-conducting polymers (very different in nature) have been used in biosensing239–242 or sensing.243,244 The polymer families range from typical polystyrene,240 poly(acrylic acid)242 or polyethylenimine244 to more complex polymers like poly[(2-ethyldimethylammonioethyl methacrylate ethyl sulfate)-co-(1-vinylpyrrolidone)] (PQ11)243 or poly(benzyl methacrylate-r-ethylene glycol methacrylate-r-N-acryloxysuccinimide)(PBPN).239 The last case is especially interesting as the amphiphilic polymer is composed of three blocks, each with a specific function, i.e. a hydrophobic part with a benzene ring that helps to immobilize the polymer on the RGO surface by π–π interactions; a poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate segment whose function is protein repulsion and an easy-removable activated ester, N-acryloxysuccinimide (NAS) as a component for bioconjugation.245 The bare ITO electrode was modified with aminoethyl benzenediazonium salt and then covered with a layer of GO, which was afterward electrochemically reduced. The modified electrode was immersed in a solution containing PBPN and the antibody (anti-mouse IgG) and was covalently immobilized on the polymer layer by substitution of the succinimide moieties.239 The immunosensing platform for the detection of an antigen, mouse IgG, was prepared by the sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol (Fig. 15). More exactly, the target antigen (mouse IgG) was dropped on the anti-mouse IgG-immobilized surface and then horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-mouse IgG was also dropped on the resulting surface. After incubation, the immunosensor was placed in a solution containing hydroquinone (HQ) and H2O2. In the presence of H2O2, the HRP molecules catalyze the oxidation of HQ into benzoquinone (BQ), which is electrochemically reduced on the electrode surface, producing a high signal current. The authors reported a LOD of 100 fg mL−1.

3.3. Chemical sensors based on polymer–graphene–carbon nanotubes
This last section is devoted to polymeric composites where graphene and CNTs are used simultaneously. The combination of both carbon nanoforms is expected to deliver outstanding properties like superior electrochemical activity that is not achieved by any of these components alone. In fact, polymer composites based on graphene and carbon nanotube hybrids have been prepared to develop better supercapacitors,246 highly conductive transparent electrodes for energy conversion in solar cells247,248 and for thermal interface materials.249 This philosophy has been recently extended to the field of electrochemical sensors.250–256 But to the best of our knowledge, there are no examples on optical sensors combining these two carbon nanoforms with polymers.
Similar to those described in the preceding sections, several of these examples use molecularly imprinted conducting polymers.250–252 In an interesting study a complex electrode has been used for the determination of tryptamine.250 In this case the electrode is composed of three different polymers, each with a specific function. The GCE is modified by a first layer comprising PPy and ASG that improves the selectivity and the rapidness of response of the electrode. Then a second layer of a biocomposite composed of a polysaccharide, hyaluronic acid (HA) and MWCNTs is drop cast on the modified electrode. While the HA provides biocompatibility and hydrophilicity, the function of the MWCNTs is to enhance the current response. Finally the selectivity is provided by an aniline derivative polymer, poly(para-aminobenzoic acid) (PpABA) that is electropolymerized on the top of the HA/MWCNT–PPy/SG–GCE electrode in the presence of tryptamine molecules. In this study all experimental parameters including scan cycles, template/monomer ratio, carbon nanoform loading, pH and temperature were deeply studied and optimal conditions were determined. In addition the tryptamine response was evaluated in the presence of analogues like tyramine, dopamine and tryptophan demonstrating the selectivity of the modified electrode. Under optimal conditions a linear range from 9.0 × 10−8 to 7.0 × 10−5 mol L−1 and a LOD 7.4 × 10−8 mol L−1 were reported.
Another complex electrode composed of CS–silver NPs, graphene–MWCNTs and MIP PPy has been employed to determine neomycin.251 In this case CS–silver NPs and graphene–MWCNTs were prepared separately. The sensor was constructed as follows: first, a solution of CS–silver NPs was cast on the electrode surface, and then a suspension of graphene–MWCNTs was added on the top. Subsequently, a PPy film was formed in the presence of the neomycin templates and the electrode was washed with acetic acid and ethanol to remove the template. By using CV and amperometry it was reported that, under optimal conditions, the linear range of the sensor was from 9.0 × 10−9 to 7.0 × 10−6 mol L−1, with a LOD of 7.63 × 10−9 mol L−1.
In another study a carbon electrode covered with graphene was cast with a film of diazonium functionalized SWCNTs bearing aniline moieties and then a MIP PANI was electrodeposited in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA).252 DPV experiments showed a wide linear range (1.0 × 10−10 to 1.0 × 10−4 g mL−1) with a low detection limit of 6.2 × 10−11 g mL−1 for BSA.
Due to good adsorption, compatibility and excellent film-forming ability CS was used with CNT–graphene hybrids as a sensor of organophosphate pesticides253 and an immunosensor.254 In the former the electrode preparation is simple and rapid since it is based on a one-step electrodeposition procedure.253 With this electrode methyl parathion, as a model of organophosphate pesticides, was linearly detected between 7.6 × 10−9 and 1.9 × 10−6 mol L−1, with a LOD of 1.9 × 10−9 mol L−1. In the latter a layer by layer assembling approach was employed to build the immunosensor.254 This device was used to detect procalcitonin, a marker of the identification of severe bacterial infections, with a linear response range from 1 × 10−11 to 3.50 × 10−7 g mL−1 and a LOD of 5 × 10−13 g mL−1, under optimal experimental conditions.
A novel strategy based on a layer-by-layer assembly method through the electrostatic adsorption between positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and negatively charged MWCNTs and graphene has also been employed to build a sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor using human IgG as a model target.255 The detection limit of the immunosensor was 2.0 × 10−10 g mL−1 and a good linear relationship between the current signals and the concentrations of human IgG (1.0 × 10−9 to 5.0 × 10−7 g mL−1) were reported.
4. Conclusions and future perspectives
In summary, polymer–CNT and polymer–graphene based sensors have demonstrated their great potential in a wide variety of challenging chemical sensing and biosensing applications. The synergistic effect of the intrinsic properties of both carbon nanomaterials such as NIR fluorescence or fluorescence quenching, high electrical and thermal conductivity, chemical stability and mechanical strength with the tuneable properties of polymers in terms of their chemical structure and functionality, combined with their low cost, easy processability, and, in many cases, recyclability and sustainability, makes these polymer composites ideal for the development of new types of chemical sensors.
Most examples described in this review show an enhancement in sensing performance with these polymer composites compared to current sensors in the literature, although only in few publications the sensing parameters with and without the polymer in the same sensor are compared. Likewise, the data reported to date reveal the different roles that polymers play in the development of ultrasensitive and highly selective sensors and biosensors based on CNTs and graphene. Polymers can provide the immobilization support and encapsulate or coat the carbon nanomaterial or the electrode to prevent or favour adsorption. They can enhance the electrocatalytic behaviour, amplify the fluorescence and improve the selectivity. In this regard, molecularly imprinted polymers can play a dual role in these sensors providing recognition sites and, for example, also enhancing the electron transfer.
Polymers can also improve the CNT or graphene dispersion or provide biocompatibility and water dispersion ability. They can be incorporated into the sensing platforms with many different preparation methods and architectures from in situ polymerization or electropolymerization to solution mixing, molecular imprinting or layer by layer techniques, among others.
On the other hand, the combination of graphene derivatives (GO) with conjugated polymers has been very effective to amplify the fluorescence response in optical sensors for biomedical analysis. Polymer–graphene electrochemical sensors have shown enhanced detection sensitivity and selectivity and rapidness of response of the electrode depending on the nature of the polymer or combination of polymers and their synergistic effects with the graphene derivatives.
Nevertheless, there are a number of challenges to be addressed to fulfil the application of polymer–CNT and polymer–graphene composites for sensing applications. First, due to the elevated cost of high purity and quality CNTs, the synthesis process of these composites is expensive. Moreover, the processing is still not fully controlled. For instance, nanotube dispersion is difficult to be optimized, and CNT aggregates are frequently formed, which limit the composite properties. Despite the fact that covalent and non-covalent functionalization of CNTs are generally successful in overcoming this limitation, some of these approaches are tedious and hence difficult to scale up. In this sense, graphene has a cost advantage over CNTs since it can be obtained from naturally occurring graphite and catalysts are not needed for this. However, the properties of graphene and its derivatives strongly depend on their quality and, in this regard, mass-scale production of high quality graphene is still a challenge. Moreover, although significant advances have been made on the functionalization of graphene and its interactions with polymers, much research effort is still necessary to incorporate them efficiently into multicomponent advanced devices. In addition, the toxicological impact of both types of composites has not been investigated in detail and needs to be carefully analyzed prior to using them in living biological systems.
Most advances have been done mainly on polymer–CNT based sensors although the application of polymer–graphene composites in biosensors is growing very quickly parallel to the developments and achievements in graphene itself and in polymer–graphene based materials.
The straight question that arises for future perspectives in this field is which composites are better for use in chemical sensors? Those based on graphene or carbon nanotubes? The answer is not straightforward neither general for both types of sensors analysed through this review. The advantages of using CNTs or graphene–polymer composites would depend on the specific application taking into account the differences in the surface chemistry, redox behaviour, conductivity and optical properties of both carbon nanomaterials and their complex interactions with the polymeric matrix.
Regarding optical sensors, it is not possible to establish a direct comparison since there is lack of literature dealing with the same polymer reinforced with CNTs and graphene. Focusing on the same analyte (i.e. glucose) and composites prepared by the same method (i.e. solution mixing), it is found that samples with RGO (ref. 208) display a wider linear range and enhanced sensitivity compared to those incorporating SWCNTs (ref. 111 and 112). However, it should be noted that these SWCNT-based sensors are based on the change in the NIR emission spectra of the SWCNTs, while that incorporating RGO is an electrochemiluminescence biosensor in which the RGO accelerates the charge transfer. Higher potential of GO-based sensors can be envisaged considering comparative studies on the nanoquenching effects of CNTs and GO toward DNA fluorophores in the absence of a polymer, which revealed superior quenching abilities of GO in both the quenching efficiency and kinetics.257 Future applications in sensing and biosensing, especially based on the exceptional tunable optical properties of graphene derivatives combined with the multifunctionalities of polymers, are foreseen.
In the case of electrochemical sensors, both carbon nanoforms have a wide potential window, are chemically inert, and show electrocatalytic activity for several reactions. Furthermore in CNTs or graphene–polymer composites for electrochemical sensors, where the electronic transport is fundamental to ensure a fast and sensitive response, both carbon nanoforms display exceptional intrinsic electric conductivities for signal transducing. However, their geometries are noticeably different causing different effects on the effective conductivities of composites. In this case, it has been demonstrated that graphene is more effective in conductivity enhancement than CNTs.258 Strictly analysing the role of the carbon nanostructures, the differences in concentration and distribution of edges and defects must be contemplated since it is known that a high density of edge-plane-like defective sites provides many active spots and is beneficial for accelerating electron transfer between the electrode and analytes in solution.259–262 For example, in the case of DA graphene has displayed better sensing performance than both SWCNTs263 and MWCNTs,264 and effective separation of its electrochemical signal from interfering agents.
Apart from the rapidness and sensitivity, the other key factor is the selectivity or specificity of the devices. In this matter, the role of the polymer with broader chemistry than the carbon nanoform is of paramount importance and the larger the type of polymer that can be composed with the carbon nanostructures, the higher the number of sensing devices that can be prepared and the number of analytes that can be determined. In addition, sometimes the polymer function is to increase the processability of the carbon nanoforms. In this case the possibility of polymer wrapping of CNTs (not possible in the case of graphene) makes that a great variety of these materials can be used, which increases the range of electrodes that can be prepared, and thus specificity, selectivity and versatility. However, in the case of graphene this limitation can be addressed just using a graphene derivative like GO, which has a wide variety of oxygen-containing groups, each with specific chemistry that makes tailor-modification of graphene possible.
Along this revision we did not find sensors composed of the same polymeric system to detect the same target in order to compare the sensing performance of CNTs and graphene. However, the cases of determining dopamine in ref. 177 and 225 show several similarities. In both cases a GCE modified with a molecularly imprinted MMA-based copolymer was employed to detect dopamine. In this case the key factor lies in the MIP that allows for selectivity and sensitivity for the DA recognition, being the amounts of carbon nanoforms enough to ensure a good electrochemical response and a similar LOD were obtained in both cases. Therefore in this type of sensor the role of the polymer should not be ignored and to focus only on carbon nanostructures would be a mistake. We envisage that in future the scope of graphene–polymer electrochemical sensors will increase considerably and that graphene-based composites with new families of polymer, some of them already employed with CNTs, will be prepared and their sensing performance will be evaluated. Especially interesting is the case of disposable sensors where the cost of preparation is decisive, and graphene that can be prepared from naturally occurring graphite represents a better option than CNTs.
The combination of graphene and carbon nanotubes, principally in the form of 3D structures in polymers, represents a very interesting strategy, which has only begun to be investigated for sensing. Expanding this philosophy could represent a breakthrough as a great synergistic effect can be produced, where the high concentration of edge planes in graphene provides high sensitivity and fast analysis and the polymer wrapped carbon nanotubes facilitate the device preparation without losing the electron transport properties. Thus, the preparation of CNT–graphene hybrid polymer composites may constitute one of the future research lines in this field, where layer-by-layer assembling emerges as a simple approach to construct highly efficient, sensitive and selective devices. Although no examples have been reported so far about optical sensors, it is expected that hybrid graphene–CNT composites will be prepared and tested as sensing devices in the near future.
Therefore, although several milestones have been achieved, ongoing research effort is necessary to design new polymer–CNT and polymer–graphene devices with improved performance and reproducibility compared to other materials that could be employed for chemical sensing and biosensing both in vivo and in vitro applications. The scope of these polymer composites is expected to continue growing with the development of more versatile fabrication strategies to build complex architectures with the key factor being the understanding and control of the interphases of these materials. If all the aforementioned drawbacks are properly addressed, it can be expected that the merits of these polymer composite-based sensors will have an important impact on the future of sensors based on carbon nanomaterials.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic representation of polymer-wrapped SWCNT systems used for glucose detection: (A) introduction of concanavalin A (ConA) to phenoxy-derivatized dextran-wrapped SWCNT initiates nanotube agglomeration, resulting in a decrease in nanotube fluorescence. The addition of glucose, which binds to ConA, separates the nanotube bundles with the recovery of fluorescence. (B) PVA-wrapped SWCNT is covalently tethered to GBP. Upon addition of glucose, the GBP undergoes a conformational change, resulting in a change in the SWCNT fluorescence intensity.

 	Fig. 2  Schematic representation of chitosan–SWCNT sensors for glycan lectin detection. (A) The chitosan wrapped SWCNT sensors are processed to include tethered NTA groups and chelated Ni2+ so that His-tagged lectins can attach to the sensors. (B) Ensemble measurement setup: the chitosan–SWCNT gel is spotted onto glass chips which are excited by a laser, and the emission spectra are analyzed.

 	Fig. 3  (A) Sensor array fabricated using SWCNT–chitosan (CS). A SWCNT–CS suspension is spotted on glass and functionalized with Ni–NTA to bind His-tag proteins. (B) Optical and NIR fluorescence image of the SWCNT–CS array. (C) Signal transduction mechanism for detection of protein–protein interactions: a NIR fluorescence change from the SWCNT occurs when the distance between the Ni2+ quencher and the SWCNT is altered upon analyte protein binding.
