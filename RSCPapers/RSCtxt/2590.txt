    , Accepted 20th January 2011First published on 21st February 2011AbstractWe provide a proof of concept of a lithium battery configuration containing an aqueous cathode in a flow-through mode. A room-temperature, rechargeable alkali-ion battery with a commercially available Li+-ion solid–electrolyte separating a Li0 anode and an organic liquid–carbonate electrolyte on one side and, on the other, an aqueous cathode containing 0.1 M K3Fe(CN)6 has been demonstrated to give high efficiency electrical energy storage at 3.40 V; it is capable of matching the capacity of the Li0 anode if operated with the aqueous cathode in a flow-through mode. The resistance of the solid electrolyte rather than the flow rate of the cathode determined the power density of the test cell. The concept can be used with a more-abundant Na0 anode and a Na+-ion solid electrolyte. The results call for the development of an alkali-ion solid–electrolyte separator with a smaller resistance.
Introduction
Electrical energy storage (EES) is a critical component of any large-scale substitution of wind, solar, or nuclear energy for the energy stored in fossil fuels. A battery offers high energy conversion efficiency (ECE) and environmental compatibility, but the limits on its specific energy density render the cost of its use for EES a problem even where they are used as a distributed energy store in electric vehicles (EVs).
The specific energy density of a battery is (1)and the specific capacity is (2)where wt stands for the total weight, I is a constant current delivered over a time, Δt, for a complete discharge of the battery, and V(q) is the output voltage at the stage of charge q. Higher specific energies of the lithium-ion rechargeable batteries (LBs) compared to batteries using an aqueous electrolyte have ushered in the wireless revolution, but the energy densities of present-day LBs are minimal for low-cost EVs.
Conventional LBs rely on insertion-compound cathodes that have a Q/wt limited by the solid-solution range of the guest Li+ ion in the interstitial space of the host cathode material.1 This limitation is made worse if the anode potential lies above that of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the electrolyte. The LUMO of the organic liquid–carbonate electrolytes commonly used in LBs is about 1 eV below the Fermi energy of elemental lithium, the Li+/Li0 energy. On repeated recharge, a Li0 anode develops dendrites that may short-circuit the battery to give thermal runaway.2 The problem is alleviated by the use of an insertion reaction in a graphitic-carbon anode Li1−xC6.3 However, the potential of the carbon anode is only about 0.2 eV below the Li+/Li0 energy, which means that a passivating solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) layer must form on the carbon–anode surface. The SEI layer transports Li+ ions between the electrolyte and the anode, but it also consumes Li irreversibly from the cathode on the first charge, which reduces further the available capacity of the cathode. Moreover, if the charging voltage, Vch, is higher than the Li+/Li0 voltage, Li0 is plated out on the SEI layer during charge, which can limit the rate of recharge unless the anode consists of a carbon-buffered alloy having a potential enough below the Li+/Li0 potential that Vch remains below the Li+/Li0 voltage.4
This voltage limitation on the anode is forcing attempts to lower the active potential energy of the cathode without compromising Q/wt. However, the liquid–carbonate electrolytes have a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) about 4.3 eV below the Li+/Li0 energy and decompose at about 5.0 eV below Li+/Li0. Moreover, the top of the oxygen-2p band in a transition-metal oxide introduces an intrinsic voltage limit, and this limit may be as low as 4 eV below Li+/Li0 or be tailored to be more than 5 eV below Li+/Li0.1,5 Oxides containing Ni2+ and Mn4+ ions offer full access to Ni2+ to Ni4+ valence states with a negligible voltage step at about 4.75 eV below Li+/Li0,6 and present efforts are directed at stabilizing these oxides for use at temperatures up to 60 °C. But the limiting voltage for a LB capable of a fast charge would still be 4.0 eV with a cathode capacity below 250 mA h g−1.
Given these limitations on the energy density of a conventional LB using solid electrodes and a liquid electrolyte, alternative LB strategies are being considered. We are investigating use of a solid–electrolyte separator to allow use of Li0 or Na0 as the anode and a liquid or gaseous cathode. The Na/S cell represents a rechargeable battery with liquid electrodes and a solid Na+-ion electrolyte, but it operates at 300 °C. A solid alkali anode is used with a solid electrolyte in thin-film LBs,7 but use of a polymer or liquid electrolyte on the anode side of a thin solid–electrolyte separator would also allow use of a Li0 or Na0 solid anode as any dendrite would be blocked from reaching the cathode by the solid–electrolyte separator. We demonstrate here the feasibility of a room-temperature alkali-ion cell using a solid–electrolyte separator with an organic liquid–carbonate electrolyte on the anode side and, on the cathode side, an aqueous liquid cathode containing an Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple that can be separated in a flow-through mode to give a large cathode capacity.
Metallic Li0 has the highest specific capacity of any anode, 3860 mA h g−1. The highest capacity of state-of-the-art insertion-compound cathode materials in LBs is a little over 200 mA h g−1.1 In order to utilize effectively the high capacity of a Li0 anode, air and water have been proposed as the cathode. In theory, the specific energy of a Li/air battery is 5200 mA h g−1.8 Oxygen has been shown to react with Li+ ions at a catalytic oxide to form, reversibly, Li2O2,9,10 but the oxygen-reduction (ORR) occurs at 2.5–2.7 V and the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) at 4.2 V to 4.4 V versus Li+/Li0, which makes for a poor EES efficiency. The slow kinetics of the ORR and OER also limits the rates of discharge and charge.11 Although Pt-based catalysts have been tailored to reduce the overpotentials,12 these catalysts are too expensive and still inadequate. But even with acceptable catalytic activity at the cathode, a Li+-solid–electrolyte separator would be needed to allow use of a Li0 anode.
A lithium/water battery demonstrates a low voltage of near 2.0 V, and H2 evolution makes a Li/H2O battery irreversible.13–16 However, with a solid–electrolyte separator, a Li|β–NiOOH(aqueous solution) battery with the cathode of a Cd|NiOOH alkaline battery operates at 3.4 V and has exhibited a capacity of 256 mA h g−1,17 but this capacity is still far smaller than that of the Li0 anode because NiOOH is an insertion compound restricted to the solid-solution range NiOOH–Ni(OH)2 of the H+ guest ion. Therefore, we have proposed use of an aqueous cathode with a redox couple located above the potential for water decomposition.18 This strategy has several advantages: (1) a LB of 3.5 V can be realized; (2) movement of Li+ ions in aqueous solution is faster than that of Li+ ions in a solid-cathode host; (3) the absence of host structural changes during the charge/discharge process enables long cycle life of an aqueous cathode; and (4) an aqueous cathode and a solid–electrolyte separator allow operation of the cathode in a flow-through mode, which allows realization of a large cathode capacity.
To demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy, we have chosen the redox couple Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64−, which is stable in an aqueous solution. The electrochemical reactions at the electrodes can be written as: (−) Li → Li+ + e−; φ0− = −3.04 vs. SHE;(3) (+) Fe(CN)63−(aq) + e− → Fe(CN)64−(aq); φ0+ = 0.36 vs. SHE;(4)
Overall reaction: Li + Fe(CN)63−(aq) = Li+ + Fe(CN)64−(aq); E = 3.40 V(5)
In a flow-through mode, the aqueous cathode passes continuously through the cathode side so as to oxidize fully the alkali-metal anode. The flow of the aqueous solution brings heat out of the electrochemically active part of the system to keep the battery operating near ambient condition. With this strategy, the more-abundant Na0 can be used in place of Li0 with a Na+-ion solid–electrolyte separator.
Experimental
The test rechargeable alkali-ion cathode-flow (RACF) battery was assembled in a layered structure as illustrated in Fig. 1. The anode was a lithium ribbon and titanium mesh was the current collector. The aqueous cathode used was 0.1 M K3Fe(CN)6. The solid–electrolyte separator with a thickness of 166 µm was Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 from OHARA Inc., Japan, having the NASICON structure. Two layers of Celgrade® polypropylene separator were put between the lithium ribbon and the solid electrolyte to avoid reduction of the electrolyte by direct contact with the anode. Alternatively, a layer of lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) on the anode side of this electrolyte has been used by Bates.19 To facilitate Li+-ion transport between the Li0 ribbon and the solid–electrolyte separator, the organic electrolyte 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 EC/DEC (vol:vol) was used on the anode side. A single-channel serpentine flow field was fabricated on the cathode end plate as illustrated in Fig. 2. On the top of the cathode end plate, a layer of carbon paper or porous nickel was applied as the diffusion layer (DL) and the current collector. The anode side of the cell sealed to the solid electrolyte was assembled in an argon-filled glove box, and the cathode side was put together in air.

A passive design was first used for the cathode to validate the prototype of the Li|Fe(CN)63−(aq) cell. The passive design used a reservoir of the K3Fe(CN)6 solution to replace the flow field in the flow-through cathode cell. The Fe(CN)63− ions passively move to reactive sites via diffusion rather than by forced movement. A current of 0.5 mA cm−2 was applied to the passive cathode cell to evaluate its charge/discharge capability and reversibility.
Before the flow-through test, the RACF battery was aged for at least 5 hours at a high flow rate of the aqueous cathode to ensure reaching to a stable state. To evaluate the performance of the RACF battery, a current of 0.5 mA cm−2 was applied to obtain its discharge behavior at different flow rates of the aqueous cathode. A peristaltic pump (Model 3384-Ultra Low Flow, Control Company) was employed to deliver the liquid cathode to the RACF battery. The flow rates were determined by the water weight. Four flow rates, 0.41 ml min−1, 0.29 ml min−1, 0.16 ml min−1 and 0 ml min−1, were used to evaluate the battery. In order to keep the battery at stable state, the battery was aged for at least 2 hours after a flow rate of the aqueous cathode was changed before starting the next electrochemical measurement.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with a Solartron® 1260A/1287A at the open-circuit-voltage (OCV) of the battery. A sinusoidal signal with amplitude of 10 mV was applied to the battery. The frequency of the signal was scanned from 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz.
All experiments were conducted at room temperature.
Results and discussion
A stable Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− redox couple brings a theoretical voltage of 3.40 V to the lithium|aqueous-cathode battery. When the 0.1 M Fe(CN)63− aqueous solution was applied to the passive cathode cell, the battery demonstrated a reversible performance as shown in Fig. 3(a). Since there is no phase change in the discharge process, the discharge curve of the battery does not show a plateau. The change in the concentration ratio of Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− in the aqueous solution led to the gradient of the charge/discharge profile. Its effective voltage on discharge is from 3.30 V to 3.58 V and, on charge from 3.48 V to 3.67 V at a current of 0.5 mA cm−2. The gap between discharge/charge curves of the Li|Fe(CN)63− (aq) battery was far smaller than that of a Li|air battery. Fig. 3(b) illustrates the capacity retention versus the cycle number at the constant current of 0.5 mA cm−2. In 20 cycles, the capacity of the battery has no significant change. Its coulombic efficiency increased from 97% at the first cycle to 99% at the twentieth cycle. The Li|Fe(CN)63−(aq) battery demonstrates a reversibility with high coulombic efficiency.

Fig. 4 shows the discharge behavior of the RACF battery for four different flow rates of the aqueous cathode. The flow rate affected the discharge–voltage profiles of the RACF battery as well. The battery stayed at 3.52 V at the flow rate of 0.41 ml min−1. The voltage changed to 3.50 V and 3.48 V at the rates of 0.29 ml min−1 and 0.16 ml min−1, respectively. When the flow rate is zero, the small volume of the cathode solution in the diffusion layer and the flow channel could not sustain the change in the concentration ratio of Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− and showed a relatively large negative slope on the discharge–voltage profile of the battery. A higher flow rate of the cathode solution kept a high reactant concentration on the reactive sites to make the RACF battery work at a higher voltage.

The RACF battery with a relatively thick solid–electrolyte separator realized a maximum power density near 17 mW cm−2 at the flow rates of 0.41 ml min−1, 0.29 ml min−1, and 0.16 ml min−1 as shown in Fig. 5. The flow rate did not affect significantly the voltage and power density with increasing current density. Electrochemical reactions in the battery took place very rapidly, so the kinetic polarization could not be observed at low current densities. The linear polarization curve at low and medium current density ranges indicates that the performance of the battery was dominated by its resistance. At the high current–density range, the abrupt drop in potential means a mass transport loss due to the slow mobility of lithium ions in the solid electrolyte. Therefore, the solid electrolyte with a Li+-ion conductivity of 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 of the test cell determines the performance of the test cell rather than the flow rate of the aqueous cathode. When the flow rate was zero, the cell gave a maximum power density of 9.93 mW cm−2 that is only 58% of the maximum power densities of the cell with the other three flow rates. The continuous flow of the aqueous cathode kept the cell working at a high power density.

The RACF battery was also investigated with EIS. Fig. 6 demonstrates the EIS test result. Three semi-cycles are present at high, medium, and low frequency ranges. They correspond to the responses from the liquid solutions, electrochemical reactions, bulk solid electrolyte and its internal parts. According to the intersecting point between a semi-cycle and the real axis, the resistances of the solution (RS), of charge transfer (RF), of the solid electrolyte (RSE), and of the interface (RInt) can be obtained. In our lithium cathode-flow test cell, the four resistances are 7.11 Ω cm2, 31.95 Ω cm2, 166.15 Ω cm2, and 129.04 Ω cm2, respectively. Compared with the passive-cathode Li|Fe(CN)63−(aq) battery,18 the cathode-flow battery has small solution and charge-transfer resistances, which may result from the tight contact between diffusion layer/current collector and the solid electrolyte.

Conclusions
An alkali-metal|aqueous-cathode battery can provide an excellent EES efficiency at an acceptable voltage of 3.40 V. During the charge/discharge process, the aqueous cathode does not experience a phase change, which gives the battery a long cycle life. A flow-through mode of the aqueous cathode can provide a full and efficient match of the capacity of an alkali-metal anode. The flow of the aqueous solution continuously brings heat out of the battery system and keeps the battery working near a mild condition. Flow rates of the aqueous cathode in the study affected the open-circuit voltage and the working voltage of the RACF battery, but they did not influence significantly the power density of the battery. Development of a thinner solid–electrolyte separator with a higher Li+-ion or Na+-ion conductivity would provide commercially viable room-temperature EES for energy sources alternative to fossil fuels.
