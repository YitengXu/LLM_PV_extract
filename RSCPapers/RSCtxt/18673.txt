    , Accepted 12th January 2018First published on 12th January 2018AbstractNeodymium hydroxide nanorods [Nd(OH)3] are developed by a facile chemical precipitation method without any surfactants/templates at ambient temperature. The neodymium hydroxide nanorods–graphene [Nd(OH)3/G] nanohybrid is prepared by a simple solvothermal reduction process using Nd(OH)3/GO in a mass ratio of 1:0.5 in dimethylformamide for 7 h. This new Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid can be used as an electrode material for supercapacitors; it exhibits good capacitive behaviour, with a specific capacitance of 820 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The nanohybrid exhibits a capacitance retention of 96% even after 3000 continuous charge–discharge cycles. This excellent electrochemical behaviour is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of Nd(OH)3 and graphene. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is denoted as Nd(OH)3/G‖AC; a poly(vinylidene fluoride) electrospun membrane soaked in 6 M KOH was used as a separator as well as the electrolyte. The ASC device functions in an optimized potential window of 1.6 V with an energy density of 40 W h kg-1. Furthermore, the ASC device exhibits excellent capacitance retention of 85.3% with a Coulombic efficiency of 97% even after 5000 cycles. This new hybrid electrode material shows impressive performance and can be used as an electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitors.
1. Introduction
The ever-increasing energy demands worldwide and the significant utilization of clean energy have accelerated the development of sustainable energy models, which include energy conversion and storage devices such as solar cells, fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. Among these, supercapacitors have become indispensable, in part due to their high power densities, ultra fast charging/discharging rates, long lifespans, and environmental benignity; also, they can bridge the gap between batteries and conventional capacitors. Supercapacitors store energy either by an electric double layer charge storage mechanism (ion adsorption) or a pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism (faradaic redox reaction).1–3 In addition to the energy storage mechanisms of supercapacitors, their electrode materials mainly determine their performance. Pseudocapacitors have great potential due to their energy densities and higher specific capacitance availability than EDLC due to their fast and reversible redox reactions; thus, it is highly desirable to develop promising pseudocapacitive materials with high specific capacitance and conductivity.4 Transition metal oxides (TMOs)/hydroxides (TMHOs), such as RuO2, MnO2, NiO, Co3O4, Fe2O3, Ni(OH)2, and Co(OH)2, and their layered double hydroxides have been considered as potential candidates for pseudocapacitive electrode materials.5–12 The recent trend in this research is focusing on optimizing pseudocapacitive materials as nanostructures and confining them to a conductive carbonaceous matrix, which increases their surface areas. These electrodes may contribute to better specific capacitance, increased cyclic stability and increased energy density due to the additional contribution of the redox response of the metallic species.
Graphene-based nanohybrids have received increasing attention for their potential applications in batteries, supercapacitors, etc.13,14 2D graphene nanosheets consist of a unique layered structure with a large specific surface area, providing multi-dimensional ion and electron transport with facile diffusion of electrolyte ions. It can be observed in the literature that TMOs/TMHOs and graphene composites prepared by various routes have been employed as electrode materials for supercapacitors.15–17 However, the exploration of electrode materials with high specific capacitance and better long life cyclability remains a challenge and is crucial for high-performance supercapacitors. Among inorganic materials, one important family is rare earth (RE) compounds; their unique 4f electron configuration provides attractive physiochemical properties. In recent years, RE materials have attracted enormous interest due to their wide applications in the fields of magnet materials, luminescent devices, catalysts, biological detection, energy, and other functional materials based on their optical and electronic properties, which have become a very active research topic. However, very few studies can be found on rare earth based compounds for supercapacitors. Wang et al. reported the specific capacitance of CeO2 nanoparticles with graphene as 208 F g−1 in 3 M KOH.18 Yadav et al. prepared La2O3 microrods on stainless steel by a hydrothermal method and attained a specific capacitance of 250 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH.19 Recently, Zhang et al. prepared lanthanum nitride (LaN) by calcining La2O3 in NH3 and used it as an electrode material for supercapacitors; it exhibits a specific capacitance of 143.7 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 using 1 M Na2SO4.20 Because TMHOs have been reported as a potential candidate for supercapacitor materials, rare earth hydroxides are also expected to exhibit better supercapacitive behaviour and are worth exploring. Herein, we attempt to explore rare earth hydroxide-based electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this study, neodymium hydroxide, Nd(OH)3, was chosen among the various rare earth hydroxides due to its unique physiochemical properties, such as its unchanged basal spacing, higher interlaying distance of ∼8.70 Å, and less hygroscopic nature.21
Thus, we prepared a nanohybrid of Nd(OH)3/graphene nanosheets by a simple two-step process involving precipitation and a solvothermal reduction process to use as an electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitors. The physiochemical properties of the prepared pure Nd(OH)3 and its nanohybrid electrodes were characterised using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy, and their electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge studies. The synergetic effect created by the combination of Nd(OH)3 and graphene was also studied in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Graphite flakes (99.5%) were purchased from HIMEDIA, India. Black Pearl Carbon-2000 was purchased from Cabot Corporation, South Korea. Nd(NO3)3·6H2O, NH3·H2O solution (25 wt%) and dimethylformamide were purchased from Merck, India. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, USA. All other chemical reagents were analytical grade and were used as received; deionized water was used throughout the process.
2.2 Preparation of Nd(OH)3 nanorods
The 1-D Nd(OH)3 nanorods were prepared successfully by a simple chemical precipitation method without the addition of any templates/surfactants at ambient temperature. In a typical procedure, 0.018 moles of Nd(NO3)3 were first dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water. To this, 100 ml of NH3 solution (28% to 30%) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. The resulting suspension was aged at room temperature for 24 h in a sealed glass beaker. The precipitate was then collected by filtration, washed with deionized water and finally dried at 60 °C for 7 h to obtain Nd(OH)3 nanorods. This method is a facile and low-cost technique to produce 1D-Nd(OH)3 nanorods.
2.3 Preparation of Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid
A modified Hummer's method was used to prepare graphene oxide by the oxidation of graphite flakes.22 The prepared graphene oxide and the prepared Nd(OH)3 nanorods were dispersed uniformly in 150 ml DMF in a mass ratio of 0.5:1. This mixture was stirred well and sonicated for 1 h. The mixture was then refluxed at 95 °C for 16 h. During the solvothermal reduction process, the Nd(OH)3 nanorods were anchored electrostatically onto the graphene nanosheets.16 The resulting solid was then washed with deionized water and ethanol by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C to obtain the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid.
2.4 Physical characterization
The morphologies of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid and pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM, JEOL 7600F) with energy dispersive X-ray analysis for elemental analysis. Their structures and phase purities were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD Ultima Rikagu IV) using Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 0.15408 nm) in the range of 10° to 80°. The step size and scan rate were set at 0.2° and 3° min−1, respectively. To further confirm the resulting products, Raman spectra were recorded using Ar+ laser light at the wavelength of 514 nm on a confocal micro Raman spectrometer (Renishaw RW-2000).
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance of the prepared Nd(OH)3/G electrode was determined using an electrochemical workstation (Biologic Model: VSP, France). The working electrode was prepared by mixing 80 wt% of the prepared electroactive hybrid material (Nd(OH)3/G), 10 wt% black pearl carbon (activated carbon) and 10 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to obtain a homogenous slurry. This was coated on the stainless steel (SS) substrate with a geometric surface area of 1 cm2 and then dried at 70 °C for 5 h in a vacuum oven. The electroactive mass of the electrode materials was 5.0 mg. In a half cell test, Nd(OH)3/G electrode, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum electrode were used as the working electrode, reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded in the potential window of −0.2 to +0.4 V at various scan rates, including 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mV s−1. The specific capacitance (Csp) of the working electrode was calculated based on the CV curves using an equation reported elsewhere.23 Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves were recorded at various current densities, including 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 A g−1, in the potential range of −0.2 to +0.4 V. From the charge–discharge curves, the specific capacitances (Csp) of the working electrode and ASC devices were calculated using an equation reported elsewhere.24 Electrochemical impedance measurements were recorded in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at the open circuit potential with an AC amplitude of 5 mV.
2.6 Asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device studies
The ASC devices were fabricated using a Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid cathode and activated carbon anode and an electrospun PVDF polymer electrolyte membrane soaked in 6 M KOH as the separator. The optimum mass balance between the positive and negative electrodes was calculated by equations reported elsewhere.25
Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed for the assembled ASC device. From the charge–discharge curves, the energy density (Ecell) and power density (Pcell) of the ASC device were calculated using the equations (1) (2)where Ccell is the specific capacitance of the ASC device (F g−1), V is the potential window of the ASC device and Δt is the discharge time.
3. Results and discussion
FE-SEM images of the Nd(OH)3 nanorods and Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid are shown in Fig. 1(a and b). Fig. 1(a) shows the morphology of pure Nd(OH)3, which consists of rod-like structures with an average diameter of 50 nm and lengths of 100 to 140 nm. The prepared Nd(OH)3 nanorods show an aspect ratio of ∼2.5. It is reasonable to assume that the nanorods formed by nucleation of the Nd(OH)3 nanoparticles and grew anisotropically. Fig. 1(b) shows the morphology of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid, which shows that the Nd(OH)3 nanorods are distributed homogeneously on the surface of the graphene nanosheets. Unreacted functional groups, such as carboxyl, epoxy, hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, and defective sites of graphene oxide acted as anchor sites for in situ growth and ordered stacking of Nd(OH)3. The ordered stacking of Nd(OH)3 onto graphene nanosheets enhanced the crystallization of Nd(OH)3 by a facile electrostatic induced stretch growth method. The homogenous stacking of Nd(OH)3 also prevents the aggregation and restacking of individual graphene nanosheets, which may expand the interlayer layer distance between the graphene sheets.

The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of the pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods and Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrids are shown in Fig. S1(a and b) (ESI†). The EDAX spectrum of the pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods (Fig. S1a, ESI†) shows the presence of Nd and O with no other impurities in the sample. The EDAX spectrum of the Nd(OH)3/G composite confirms the presence of carbon in the form of graphene in the Nd(OH)3/graphene nanohybrid (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The mass ratio of Nd(OH)3 and graphene was found to be 1:0.5.

Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of the pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods and the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid. The main diffracted peaks are indexed as (100), (110), (101), (200), (201), (210), (002), (300), (102), (112), (131), (302), and (231) for the pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods and Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid. All the diffraction peaks perfectly match those of the hexagonal phase of Nd(OH)3 (JCPDS card no. 83-2035). No impurity peaks are present, which demonstrates that the chemical precipitation method and reduction process afforded pure hexagonal Nd(OH)3 and Nd(OH)3/G, respectively, with a space group of P63/m. The hexagonal lattice parameters were found to be a = 6.419 Å and c = 3.745 Å, which are in good agreement with literature values.26 The growth direction of the pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods is along the c-axis and is largely confined to the [100] and [001] directions. The broad diffraction peaks imply nanostructured materials. It is also observed that the intensities of the diffraction peaks of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid are stronger than those of Nd(OH)3, indicating that graphene enhances the crystallization of Nd(OH)3. It is evident from the Scherrer equation that the average crystallite size of the pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods on graphene is ∼4.49 nm, whereas it is ∼5 nm for the Nd(OH)3 nanorods. The absence of the graphene peak is due to the complete coverage of Nd(OH)3 on the surface of graphene.

Raman spectra of the Nd(OH)3 nanorods and Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid are shown in Fig. 2(b). The Raman bands of Nd(OH)3 observed at 784 cm−1, 573 cm−1, 470 cm−1, 404 cm−1, 353 cm−1 and 299 cm−1 are associated with the OH-stretching, OH-translation, OH-rotation and Nd-translation modes. The band at 137 cm−1 is assigned to the E2g mode and arises due to Nd-translation. The bands at 299, 353 and 404 cm−1 are assigned to the Ag vibration mode and the band at 470 cm−1 is assigned to the E1g mode associated with the Nd–OH stretch, which arises due to the OH-translation. The Nd–O–H deformation due to OH-rotation gives rise to bands at 470 cm−1 and 784 cm−1, which are associated with E1g vibration modes.27 In the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid, D and G bands arise at 1307 cm−1 and 1584 cm−1, respectively, due to the presence of graphene. The ID/IG ratio of Nd(OH)3/G was found to be 1.33, which indicates a high degree of defects arising due to the removal of functional groups from GO during the solvothermal reduction process. All the Raman bands of Nd(OH)3 are present, and no shift in the peaks is observed for the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid; this confirms that no phase change occurs during the formation of Nd(OH)3 nanorods on the graphene nanosheets.
Electrochemical performance studies, such as cyclic voltammogram, galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance studies, were conducted for the prepared Nd(OH)3 nanorods and Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrodes using a three-electrode system in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Fig. 3(a) shows the CV curves of the Nd(OH)3 nanorods at various scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1 in the potential range of −0.2 to 0.4 V vs. SCE. The non-rectangular shape of the CV curves exhibits pseudocapacitance behaviour, implying that the charge storage mechanism is mainly due to faradaic reactions. The CV curves consist of a pair of strong redox peaks at ∼0.26 V and ∼0.18 V, which indicates a faradaic process, and the oxidation peaks at the positive current density and reduction peaks at the negative current density are attributed to the conversion of NdOOH to NdO(OH)3+ and vice versa. The possible redox reaction mechanism of Nd(OH)3 electrode in 6 M KOH is NdOOH + 2OH− ⇌ NdO(OH)3+ + e−.19 The anodic and cathodic sweeps of the CV curves are not completely symmetric, which suggests irreversibility in the redox process due to polarization. The measure of reversibility (ΔE) in the faradaic redox reaction is very low and was found to be 87 mV. The anodic and cathodic peaks shifted towards positive and negative potential as the scan rate increased, which is due to internal resistance of the electrode. Furthermore, linear relationships between the anodic and cathodic peak currents and the square root of the scan rate (5 to 100 mV s−1) are shown in Fig. 3(b). This reveals the diffusion control process between the electrode–electrolyte interface and implies its pseudocapacitance nature.

Fig. 3(c) shows the CV curves of the Nd(OH)3/G electrode at various scan rates of 5 to 100 mV s−1 in the potential range of −0.2 to +0.4 V vs. SCE. The shape of the CV curves reveals both the electrical double layer as well as pseudocapacitance behaviours. A pair of redox peaks was found within the potential range of 0.0 to +0.4 V, indicating that the charge storage mechanism mainly arises due to pseudocapacitance behaviour by the faradaic reaction of Nd(OH)3; however, in the −0.2 to 0.0 V potential range, the curve is relatively rectangular in shape, indicating typical characteristics of electrical double layer capacitance mainly due to absorption/desorption of OH− ions on the surface of the graphene nanosheets, which favours the non-faradaic reaction. This is attributed to the synergistic effect between Nd(OH)3 and graphene. The strong redox peaks observed at ∼0.30 V and ∼0.18 V indicate the anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction processes, respectively. The symmetric characteristic of the redox peaks demonstrates that the Nd(OH)3/G electrode has outstanding reversibility. Further, the shape of the CV curves is well maintained even when the scan rate is increased from 5 to 100 mV s−1, implying electron conduction within the Nd(OH)3 nanorods, an enhanced mass transfer rate, and a small equivalent series resistance due to the presence of graphene nanosheets. However, as the scan rate increased from 5 to 100 mV s−1, the potentials of the oxidation and reduction peaks shifted towards the positive and negative directions, respectively, due to the internal resistance of the electrode.
The specific capacitances were calculated from the CV curves for the Nd(OH)3 nanorods and Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrodes and plotted as a function of scan rate, as presented in Fig. 3(d). Notably, the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrode delivered specific capacitances of 871, 822, 784, 739 and 692 F g−1 at scan rates of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mV s−1, respectively, which are higher than those of the pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods-based electrode. Even at a higher scan rate, the specific capacitance of the Nd(OH)3/G electrode is still maintained at 692 F g−1 and it retains 80% of its initial capacitance with a 20 fold increase, indicating the synergetic effect of graphene and Nd(OH)3, whereas the pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods maintained only 68% of their initial capacitance. Moreover, the specific capacitance gradually decreases with increasing scan rate, which indicates that the rate of mass transfer of the electrolyte ions within the electrode decreases due to limited diffusion and migration effects, resulting in low electrochemical utilization of the active electrode materials.
The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the Nd(OH)3 nanorods in the potential range of −0.2 to 0.4 V at various current densities (1 to 10 A g−1) are shown in Fig. 4(a). The non-linear galvanostatic charge–discharge curves confirm the pseudocapacitance nature of the Nd(OH)3 nanorods. The voltage plateaus observed from ∼0.2 to 0.4 V are attributed to the faradaic redox reaction between the electrode–electrolyte interface and are in good agreement with the CV curves. Linear variation of the potential is also observed from −0.2 to 0.2 V with respect to time, which is due to the charge separation between the electrode–electrolyte interface. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrode at different current densities in the potential range of −0.2 to +0.4 V vs. SCE are shown in Fig. 4(b). Two clear voltage stages are observed from the discharge curves of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrode, which demonstrates both the pseudocapacitance behaviour of Nd(OH)3 and the electrical double layer capacitance behaviour (EDLC) of the graphene nanosheets. The slow discharge at the initial period corresponds to pseudocapacitance behaviour, which indicates the redox reaction of Nd(OH)3; the later fast discharge period corresponds to the electrical double layer behaviour, which indicates the adsorption/desorption of OH− ions from the electrolyte on the graphene nanosheets.
 Fig. 4  (a) Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the Nd(OH)3 nanorods at various current densities (1 to 10 A g−1); (b) galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid at various current densities (1 to 10 A g−1). (c) Specific capacitances as a function of current density. 
The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves show a well-defined plateau at various current densities ranging from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1, which is in good concurrence with the CV curves. The profile is quite symmetrical, which implies better reversibility with the high Coulombic efficiency of the electrode. In addition, there are no obvious IR drops from the discharge curves, which demonstrates better contact between the substrate and electrode material with minimum internal resistance.28 The specific capacitance can be calculated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves and plotted as a function of the current density, as presented in Fig. 4(c). The specific capacitance is negatively correlated to the current density (i.e. the Csp decreases with increasing current density). This phenomenon is caused by the slow diffusion and migration of OH− ions towards the active electrode interface at high current density. The specific capacitances of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid were found to be 820, 773, 708, 664 and 616 F g−1 at various current densities of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 A g−1, respectively, with a better capacitance retention of 75%. The specific capacitance of the Nd(OH)3/G electrode (820 F g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1 are a significant factor of ∼1.7 times higher than those of the pure Nd(OH)3 electrode (475 F g−1), which implies a synergistic effect of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrode. There are several factors contributing to the excellent electrochemical performance of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrode: first, the nanorods are well grown on the surface of the graphene nanosheets and provide numerous electroactive sites for the faradaic redox reaction. Second, the nanorod-like morphology of Nd(OH)3 affords a minimal diffusion pathway for mass transportation of both ions and electrons within the electrode–electrolyte interface. Third, the graphene sheets provide more open space that acts as an ion-reservoir, which further enhances the penetration of electrolyte ions towards the electrodes.
To determine the charge transfer and ion diffusion behavior of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrids and pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods electrodes, AC-impedance measurements were performed in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 1 mHz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV in an open circuit potential. Fig. 5(a) displays the Nyquist plots of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid and pure Nd(OH)3 nanorods; both plots show an incomplete semicircle in the high-frequency region, with a straight line in the low-frequency region. The inset in Fig. 5(a) shows the equivalent circuit for the obtained impedance data, which consists of solution resistance (Rs), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), constant phase element (CPE) and Warburg impedance (Zw). The Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrode exhibits a negligible semicircle with a small real axis intercept in the high-frequency region, suggesting that the lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) and charge-transfer resistance can be attributed to the excellent electrical conductivity of the graphene nanosheets. The ESR values can be acquired from the real axis intercept in the high-frequency region; these were found to be 0.03 for Nd(OH)3/G and 0.16 Ω for Nd(OH)3. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of these two electrodes were found to be 0.97 and 2.80 Ω, respectively. Nd(OH)3/G possesses a lower ESR and Rct than the pure Nd(OH)3, which indicates that the presence of graphene greatly improves the conductivity through a synergistic effect.29 In the low-frequency region, the Nd(OH)3/G electrode exhibits a vertical line leaning to the −Z′′ axis by more than 45°, indicating ideal capacitive behavior with a lower diffusion resistance of the hybrid material and confirming its good electrochemical reversibility. The cycle stabilities of the Nd(OH)3/G and pure Nd(OH)3 electrodes were evaluated by a galvanostatic charge–discharge process at a constant current density of 5 A g−1 for 3000 continuous cycles, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrode retained 96% of its initial capacitance even after 3000 continuous charge–discharge cycles, whereas the Nd(OH)3 nanorods electrode retained only 92% of its initial capacitance. The Coulombic efficiencies of the Nd(OH)3/G and pure Nd(OH)3 electrodes were evaluated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves and were found to be 99% and 97%, respectively. The Nd(OH)3/G electrode exhibited excellent cycle stability; this is attributed to the Nd(OH)3 nanorods structure, which provides a shorter diffusion pathway for electrolyte ions. Moreover, the graphene nanosheets afford facile strain relaxation during an increasing number of cycles. Furthermore, due to its good electric conductivity, chemical stability, and increased surface area, graphene can suppress volume changes and particle agglomeration during the charge–discharge process and can also act as a conductive substrate to provide efficient electron transfer. Graphene will act as a buffering matrix to accommodate volumetric expansion/contraction upon long-term cycling by forming uniform nanohybrids with the Nd(OH)3 nanorods. Therefore, the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrode demonstrated better cycle stability rather than the pure Nd(OH)3 electrode. Moreover, the specific capacitance of the Nd(OH)3 nanorods and Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrodes were compared with those of other rare earth-based electrodes and their nanocomposite electrodes, as shown in Table 1. The results represent that both these electrodes possess higher specific capacitance due to the nanorod-like morphology of Nd(OH)3 embedded on the graphene nanosheets, which offers facile transportation of ions between the electrode–electrolyte interface, shortens the diffusion of OH− ions and improves the overall rate capability of the electrode material.

To further demonstrate the feasibility of the practical energy storage applications of the material, an ASC was assembled and denoted as Nd(OH)3/G‖AC. In order to acquire an optimum mass balance between the positive and negative electrodes and to estimate the operating potential window of the ASC device, we performed CV studies for the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid and AC electrodes in 6 M KOH electrolyte using a three-electrode system. Fig. 6(a) represents the CV curves of the positive and negative electrodes in the potential window of −1.2 V to 0.4 V vs. SCE at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The CV curve of the AC (negative) electrode exhibits an ideal rectangular shape, and no obvious redox peaks are observed; this indicates typical EDLC behaviour within the potential window of −1.2 to −0.2 V vs. SCE. On the other hand, the CV curve of the Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid (positive) electrode clearly exhibits a pair of redox peaks at one end due to the faradaic reaction of Nd(OH)3, and an ideally rectangular shape on the other end indicates the non-faradaic reaction of graphene; this demonstrates both the charge storage mechanism, i.e. pseudocapacitance, as well as EDLC. According to the mass balance theory of the capacitor, the accumulation of charge in the positive electrode is equal to the charge accumulation of the negative electrode (q+ = q−).36 The specific capacitance of Nd(OH)3/G is 822 F g−1, and for the AC, it is 142 F g−1; the optimized mass ratio between these two electrodes was found to be 0.28 (m+/m−) for the ASC device.
 Fig. 6  The Nd(OH)3/G‖AC-based asymmetric supercapacitor device: (a) CV curves of the AC and Nd(OH)3/G electrodes at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, (b) CV curves in various voltage windows at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1, (c) CV curves at various scan rates ranging from 5 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1, (d) galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles at various current densities from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1, (e) cycle stability and Coulombic efficiency of the ASC device up to 5000 cycles, (f) Ragone plots (energy density vs. power density). 

Fig. 6(b) represents the CV curves of the ASC device assembled with the required mass ratio between the two electrodes, Nd(OH)3/G‖AC, at various potential windows from 1.0 V to 1.8 V at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. The ASC device shows a quasi-rectangular shape for all the CV curves in the potential window from 1.0 V to 1.6 V, but not at 1.8 V. This reveals that the Nd(OH)3/G‖AC-based ASC device can be operated with a cell voltage of 1.6 V in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Further, when the operating voltage increases to 1.8 V, the shape of the CV curve is disturbed slightly; moreover, the evolution of hydrogen from the ASC device increases, which leads to damage of the electrodes.37 Thus, the optimum operating potential window for the Nd(OH)3/G‖AC ASC device is up to 1.6 V, which provides safe performance of the electrode material even during prolonged charge–discharge studies.
The CV curves of the Nd(OH)3/G‖AC-based ASC device at various scan rates of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mV s−1 were studied between 0.0 and 1.6 V (Fig. 6c). The shape of the CV curves shows a typical quasi-rectangular shape with no obvious distortion, which is attributed to both the pseudocapacitance and EDLC behaviour of Nd(OH)3–G and activated carbon (AC), respectively. The redox peaks of Nd(OH)3–G (positive electrode) were partially suppressed due to the presence of AC (negative electrode) and enhanced the power density of the ASC device.38 Even at higher scan rates, the CV curve shape was well maintained, which indicates better capacitive behaviour due to rapid ion transportation between the electrode–electrolyte interface. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the Nd(OH)3/G‖AC ASC device at various current densities ranging from 1 to 10 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 6(d). The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves show a typical isosceles triangular shape; the charging curves are nearly symmetric to the discharge curves, which demonstrates superior electrochemical reversibility. A linear relationship of the charge–discharge potential with time is observed due to the rapid I–V response and the lower ESR of the ASC device. The specific capacitances of the ASC device were calculated to be 112.5, 77, 61, 52 and 44 F g−1 at various current densities of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 A g−1, respectively.
The cycling stability of the ASC device was tested through a galvanostatic charge–discharge process at 5 A g−1 to 5000 continuous charge–discharge cycles, as shown in Fig. 6(e). The specific capacitance of the ASC device was well retained up to 2000 cycles; then, a slow decay was observed up to 5000 cycles. Initially, the specific capacitance of the ASC device was 112.5 F g−1, with an excellent retention of 91.6% up to 3000 cycles; also, it retained a capacitance of 85.3% at 5000 cycles. Moreover, the ASC device showed better Coulombic efficiency of 97%, which demonstrates that the ASC device possesses excellent electrochemical reversibility even after 5000 cycles.
To analyze the relationship between the power and energy densities of the Nd(OH)3/G‖AC ASC device, Ragone plots were generated, as shown in Fig. 6(f). Nd(OH)3/G‖AC exhibited an energy density of 40 W h kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1. These values are much higher than those of other previously reported rare earth-based ASCs.19,32,39,40 The ASC device exhibited a high power density of 7 kW kg−1 and still reached an energy density of 16 W h kg−1, showing better power capability. Thus, the Nd(OH)3/G‖AC ASC device represents a new approach to exploring more novel rare earth based electrode materials. This ASC is a favorable energy storage device that can be used for practical applications.
4. Conclusion
In this work, we successfully prepared Nd(OH)3 nanorods and a Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid by simple chemical precipitation and solvothermal reduction processes, respectively. The 1D-Nd(OH)3 nanorods completely covered the 2D-graphene nanosheets and provided an ideal support to the Nd(OH)3 nanorods. The Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 820 F g−1, which is ∼1.7 times higher than that of the Nd(OH)3 electrode. The Nd(OH)3/G‖AC ASC device delivered an excellent energy density of 40 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1 with a capacitance retention of 85.3% in an operating potential window of 1.6 V. This significant improvement is due to the synergetic effect between the 2D graphene nanosheets and 1D Nd(OH)3 nanorods. This study revealed that this Nd(OH)3/G nanohybrid is a promising new rare earth pseudocapacitive material for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
