The timescale of recombination for P4 (P4+˙ + (PC61BM)−˙ → 3P4* + PCBM) is found to be ∼3 ps. The photovoltaic performance of Px was investigated by fabricating the photovoltaic solar cells (PSCs) with conventional device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(P1 or P4):PC71BM/PFN/Al. After solvent vapour annealing with THF, the power conversion efficiencies, PCEs, are 7.36% (P1; Jsc = 12.94 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V, FF = 0.62) and 9.54% (P4; Jsc = 16.24 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V, FF = 0.66). The higher PCE of P4 may be related to the faster extraction and longer charge carrier lifetime for P4 based PSCs as compared to P1.
Introduction
Conjugated polymers containing the diketopyrrolopyrrole synthon 3,6-di-2-thienyl-2,5-dihydro-2,5-diethylhexylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) and its derivatives are known for application in transistors1 and photovoltaics.2 Applications in photocatalysis,3 photodynamic therapy,4 2-photon absorption,5 and electro-chromism6 have also been reported.6 In order to improve the material properties, motif modifications have also been performed. For instance, conjugated homo- and copolymers containing covalently bonded thiophene–DPP–thiophene units (T–DPP–T) were prepared using the trans-CC–PtL2–CC-residue (L = P(alkyl)3), [Pt], and DPP-containing polymers were recently reported, notably with thiophene–DPP–thiophene7 (P1′) and (thiophene)2–DPP–(thiophene)2 (P2) motifs (Chart 1).8 Their charge mobility,7 cyclic voltammograms,8 and photophysical properties9,10 were evaluated but their use in photovoltaic devices showed modest photocurrent efficiencies.9,10
 Chart 1  Structures of other related polymers reported in the literature and discussed in the text.7–10 
In a quest for new DPP-containing materials with improved electronic and optical properties, we now report the synthesis and characterization of a new narrow band gap oligomer, ([Pt]–[(thiophene–DPP–thiophene)2])n, P4 (Chart 2), and provide a detailed comparison with that of the known related oligomers P1′, with the slight exception that the solubilizing alkyl chains are different. In this study, their cyclic voltammograms are analyzed and their photophysical properties are examined with the aid of DFT (density functional theory) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) computations. We also report steady state and ultrafast time-resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy in solution (77 and 298 K) and in thin films. Moreover, the photo-induced electron transfer between P1 and P4 as donors and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PC61BM, as the acceptor is investigated in thin films. From fs-transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS), the time scale of transfer is ultrafast (≤128 fs) for P1 and P4, and the time scale of recombination (P+˙ + PCBM˙− → 3P* + PCBM) is 3.0 ps for P4 (rise time). Finally, the optimized PCEs are 7.36% (P1; Jsc = 12.94 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V, FF = 0.62) and 9.54% (P4; Jsc = 16.24 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V, FF = 0.66).

Results and discussion
Synthetic strategy and characterization

General procedure for synthesis of L1 and L4. 

L1 was synthesized in four steps from 2-thiophenecarbonitrile using a previously reported procedure (see Scheme S1 in ESI†). Indeed, similar molecules were previously prepared for OPSC applications.8,10 However the soluble chain on DPP was changed from n-C6H13(L1′)10 and C8H17(L2)8 to linear and longer n-nonyl chains to enhance solubility and self-organization in films, potentially enhancing their optoelectronic properties when aggregated.11–13L4 was synthesized according to Scheme 1. The DPP dimer 5 was prepared using a modified procedure from the literature14 using a Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction of 4 with 1.5 eq. of hexabutyldistannane. 5 was isolated as a dark purple solid in 56% yield. Then, the bromination of 5 afforded a mixture of mono- and dibrominated compounds 6′ and 6 as detected by 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF/MS. Their separation proved to be tedious, so the mixture was directly engaged in the final step. L4 was obtained by a Sonogashira coupling reaction between the dibrominated DPP 6 and trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA).15 It was isolated as a dark green solid in 43% yield from 5 with good purity after purification by flash chromatography (see Scheme S2 in ESI†).

Synthesis of P1 and P4. 
The syntheses of P1 and P4 were performed using a CuI-catalyzed dehydrohalogenation reaction between the protected bis-trimethylsilyl-ethynyl ligands L1 and L4 and freshly prepared trans-dichlorobis(tri-n-butylphosphine)platinum(II), trans-[PtCl2(PBu3)2]16–18 (Scheme 2). The bulky PBu3 groups are chosen for solubility reasons.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic scheme of the platinum(II) polyyne oligomers Pn (n = 1, 4). 
Initially, the reaction with the deprotected ligands was successfully performed using Wong's procedures10 for the synthesis of P1 from the deprotected L1 but failed for P4. In this case, the deprotection of L4 led to immediate degradation as confirmed by 1H NMR. To overcome this limited solubility and stability problem, in situ deprotection of the trimethylsilyl groups (TMS) was performed with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) using reported procedures.8,19 The formation of P1 was confirmed by 1H and 31P NMR (Fig. S9, ESI†). The difference in 1H chemical shift between L1 and P1 reveals that upon complexation the resonance of the thiophene-terminated protons H3 and H4 in the vicinity of the triple bond is shifted by 0.13 and −0.38 ppm, respectively (Fig. S11, ESI†). The upfield shift for H4 is consistent with the donor effect of Pt(II) in the trans-[Pt(PBu3)2(L1)2]n moiety. Concurrently, the 1H decoupled 31P NMR spectrum of P1 consists of one signal at 3.96 ppm. This signal is flanked by 195Pt satellites with a coupling constant J(31P–195Pt) of 2289 Hz, which is assigned to P-atoms trans to L120,21 (Fig. S9, ESI†). The GPC (gel permeation chromatography) traces exhibit a broad molar mass distribution, whose number-average molar mass (Mn) is 18200 g mol−1 for P1 with a dispersity Đ value of 2.1. These characteristics compare with those reported for similar polymers (Fig. S15, ESI†).8,10 Using in situ deprotection conditions8,19 of L4 during the synthesis of P4, a mixture of platinum(II) complexes was observed. The 31P NMR spectra display two signals, one at ∼7.5 ppm corresponding to the intermediate trans-[Cl–[Pt]–Ln–[Pt]–Cl]22 and another at ∼3.9 ppm attributed to the trans-P4 metallooligomers. The presence of these intermediates indicates a lower reactivity, which could be explained by the instability of L4 during the in situ-deprotection, hence decreasing the number of ligands during the polymerization. After adding four portions of 0.25 eq. of ligands and then of 0.5 eq. of TBAF the clean formation of P4 was confirmed by 1H and 31P NMR analyses (Fig. S10, ESI†). First, the difference in 1H chemical shift between L4 and its corresponding metallooligomer P4 reveals that upon complexation the resonance of the thiophene-terminated protons H3 and H4 in the vicinity of the ethynyl bond is shifted by 0.21 and −0.32 ppm, respectively (Fig. S12, ESI†). The 31P{1H} NMR signal at 3.88 ppm flanked by 195Pt satellites with a coupling constant J(31P–195Pt) of 2290 Hz for the metallooligomer P4 is consistent with the trans-geometry of the platinum(II)polyyne oligomers, i.e. trans-[Pt(L4)(PBu3)2]n. The GPC analysis indicates a relatively low average molar mass and a higher dispersity value for P4 (Mn = 6600 g mol−1, Đ = 11.1) (Fig. S15, ESI†). The average number of repeating units per chain is lower for P4 (3–4 units) than that for P1 (14–15 units). This lower mass for P4 is explained by the unexpected decomposition of the metallooligomer in THF with time as evidenced by the solution discoloration. However, the high dispersity value cannot be associated with the presence of free ligands L1 and L4, nor with by-products, as they are not detected by NMR (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). These new ligands and metallooligomers were characterized by IR ATR spectroscopy in the solid state. The IR spectra displayed one sharp ν(CO) band in the 1657–1662 cm−1 range and one strong ν(CC) signal in the 2135–2145 cm−1 range for L1 and L4 (Fig. S3 and S6, ESI†), and 2063–2081 cm−1 for P1 and P4 (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†). These [Pt]-containing oligomers exhibit ν(CC) bands at lower wavenumbers than their uncoordinated ligands, which is consistent with the back-bonding effect.23 Concurrently, the characterization of metallooligomers by MALDI-TOF/MS is generally rarely performed nor reported as they often form by-products under ionization conditions due to their poor UV stability. However, their detection can be improved using a suitable matrix.24 Indeed, DCTB (2-[(2E)-3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methylprop-2-enylidene]malononitrile) was used for similar metallopolymers (i.e. trans-[Pt(p-BTD-EDOT)-(PBu3)2]n)25 (BTD = 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (acceptor unit), EDOT = (ethylenedioxy)thiophene (donor unit)). In this work, the MALDI-TOF analyses demonstrated that P1 and P4 were indeed oligomers as the mass spectra exhibited several ion series from m/z 1000 to 9000 with mass gaps of 1196–1198 and 1748 Da, respectively, between series of molecular masses equal to the repeating units. Five repeating units for P1 and slightly less for P4 were observed, which is consistent with the GPC analyses (Fig. S16 and S17, ESI†). Each trans-[Pt(Ln)(PBu3)2]n ion series is composed of several peaks, which are difficult to assign as different ionization states (with Na+, K+ or other ions) and by-products under UV irradiation are generated during measurements. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) indicated that P4 exhibits higher thermal stability than P1 (Td = 221 °C) with a decomposition temperature (measured at 5 wt% loss) of 261 °C (Table 1 and Fig. S18, ESI†).

Electrochemical characterization. 
The electrochemical properties of P1 and P4 as thin films were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). P1 and P4 exhibit well-defined but generally irreversible oxidation and reduction peaks (Fig. 1). The HOMO and LUMO levels are respectively estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials using EDHOMO = −(Eonsetox + 4.73) eV and EDLUMO = −(Eonsetred + 4.73) eV.26 The difference between EDHOMO and EDLUMO provides the electrochemical band gaps (Eelec.g) (Table 1).
 Fig. 1  CVs of P1 and P4. The thin films were cast from a CH2Cl2 solution on a platinum disc working electrode (d = 5 mm), and the CVs were recorded in CH3CN solution containing TBAPF6 (10−1 mol L−1) as the supporting electrolyte (scan rate of 50 mV s−1). 
The EDHOMO (−5.38 eV) and EDLUMO (−3.76 eV) for P1 gave an Eelec.g of 1.62 eV. This value is consistent with the results reported by Wong's group10 for P1′. P2 displays similar EDHOMO and EDLUMO data, EDLUMO of P4 (−3.95 eV) is lower, whereas the HOMO energy level is barely modified. Thus P4 exhibits a smaller electrochemical band gap of 1.41 eV. These Eelec.g results are also consistent with the optical band gap values (Eopt.g) calculated from UV-vis absorption measurements (Table 1).


Geometry optimisation. 
In the absence of X-ray data for L1 and L4 and P1 (4 units) and P4 (4 units), geometry optimisation was performed (DFT; Fig. 2 and 3). After optimisation, L1 and L4 are expectedly planar, whereas the models for P1 and P4 are found to be quasi-planar (169 < ϕx < 175°). In these cases, the bond distances are found to be normal. Overall, this outcome is consistent with the X-ray structure of DPP-containing molecules27 and agrees with other DFT computations.28–30 Moreover, due to the presence of single bonds in L1 and L4, various conformations were also examined. After geometry optimisation, these conformations remained planar and no changes were observed in the resulting calculated frontier MOs and simulated absorption spectra (Fig. S21–S23, ESI†). Thus, these conformations were not studied further.

Electronic, optical, fluorescence properties and MO analysis
Prior to describing these properties, relevant comments are made. P1 and P4 belong to a category of polymers defined as “push–pull” or often called donor–acceptor, where [Pt] acts as the electron rich moiety31–36 and DPP37,38 is the electron withdrawing group. Thus both are prone to generate low-energy intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)39–41 excited states, which are known to lead to near-IR absorption bands and narrow bandgaps ([Pt],19,42–44 DPP45–52). The literature indicates that in conjugated thiophene/DPP-containing polymers, the thiophene residue is considered as the donor.53 One should also consider that in the presence of a strong withdrawing group, thiophene may adopt the role of a donor unit. Moreover, P1 is essentially identical to that reported by Wong and collaborators (P1′),10 which differs only in the nature of the soluble side chains. This difference is not suspected to affect the electronic properties of the polymer. Consequently, P1 is investigated for comparison purposes and to confirm some reported photophysical data (below).
Based on the experimental evidence and DFT/TDDFT computations below, one of the key features is that there is no strong low-energy ICT excited state in P1 and P4, but rather just ππ*. This is somewhat surprising and literature assignment for this low-energy band in the so-called push–pull thiophene-containing conjugated polymers may warrant a revisit or reconsideration.

Absorption spectra. 
The UV-visible spectroscopic properties and the molar extinction coefficient (ε) of L1 and L4 were determined in CH2Cl2 at 298 K (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†) and were compared with those of P1 and P4 in CH2Cl2 (Fig. 4 and Table 2) and as thin films (Fig. S19, ESI†). A desired and expected gradual shift of the low-energy absorption band to the near-IR region (i.e. λ > 700 nm) when going from L1 → L4 (Fig. 4a) and from P1 → P4 (Fig. 4b) is observed, which is consistent with the extension and planarity of the π-systems.54–56 This red shift upon polymerization of L1 and L4 is accompanied by a slight color change of the solutions (Fig. 4c; λabs(Ln) < λabs(Pn); x = 1 and 4). This feature is consistent with the contribution of the Pt dxy orbital to the π-conjugation,57–61 which is concluded in the DFT computations for P1 and P4 below. At higher energies, several vibronic features are also depicted, a characteristic that is often associated with π → π* electronic transition. DPP-containing molecules62,63 and conjugated organic polymers64 are prone to aggregate. This aggregation phenomenon is observed for P1 and P4 as thin films with a significant red-shift of the low-energy absorption band (λabs ≥ 800 nm;57 Fig. S19, ESI†).

MO diagrams and simulated absorption spectra. 
In order to address the nature of the low-energy excited states of P1 and P4, DFT (MO diagrams) and TDDFT (simulated spectra) computations were undertaken. The optimized geometries are the same as those presented in Fig. 2 and 3. The conclusion of the computational data on P1 and P4 is the same as that for L1 and L4. Only data on L4 and P4 are provided in text as representative examples (Fig. 5, 6 and Tables 3, 4) (the bulk of the data is presented in Fig. S21 and S22 (Ln), S25 and S26 (Pn) and Tables S1–S4 (Ln), S5–S8 (Pn) (ESI†)).

The general observations are as follows: (1) the frontier MOs are π-systems spreading all over the ligands and polymer chains, (2) no clear ICT process for HOMO → LUMO (and other low-energy transitions), so the excited state is mostly ππ*, (3) the calculated HOMO–LUMO gap decreases qualitatively with the extension of the π-system (Fig. 7), (4) the calculated positions of the low-energy bands are consistent with this trend and match reasonably with the experimental data of Table 2: for L1 and L4, calculated λ (nm): 535 and 669; exp. λonset (nm): 620 and 750, respectively; for models P1 and P4, calculated λ (nm): 675 and 779; exp. λonset (nm): 680 and 790, respectively, (5) the simulated spectra also compare favorably with the experimental one (Fig. 8), and (6) the lowest-energy transitions are “well-isolated” from any other transitions (i.e. other excited states), meaning that excited state mixing is minimal (i.e. HOMO → LUMO is the major component). All in all, the computations indicate that these materials do not exhibit strong ICT interactions and that the low-energy absorption band arises rather mainly from a ππ* transition. This conclusion is consistent with other computational investigations on other species containing only thiophene and DPP: (thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene),65,66 (thiophene)2–DPP–(thiophene)2,65 [Me(thiophene)2]2(DPP),67 [thiophene–DPP–thiophene-(thiophene–CCSiMe3)]2(CC),68 (thiophene–DPP–thiophene)4.69 However it has been reported that in the polymer {[(thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene)]–(thienothiophene)}n, the thienothiophene acts as the donor, leading to ICT excited states.70 This theoretical conclusion was also reported for other related polymers.71–75

Fluorescence properties. 
Fluorescent DPP-containing organic conjugated polymers are common.76–81 However, when a heavy atom is incorporated into the polymer chain, the heavy atom effect may exert a negative effect on the amplitude of the fluorescence quantum yield (ϕF) and lifetime (τF) in comparison with their corresponding metal-free monomeric model compounds.82 For instance, ϕF is generally in the range of 25–75% for substituted monomeric derivatives of both (thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene) and (thiophene)2–DPP–(thiophene)2,82,83 but falls, ϕF < 0.01, when a Pt-atom is introduced in the monomer and polymer chain.82 Two effects need to be considered. Generally, τF ranges from 5 to 7 ns for monomeric (thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene) species,84 but when incorporated within a conjugated polymer, either in solution or as thin film (for example [(thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene)–(naphthyl)]n), the fluorescence decay may become shorter (ps) and polyexponential.85 Moreover, recent examples of bis-DPP chromophores, such as Ph–[(thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene)]2–Ph86 and (2-pyridine–[(thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene)]2–2-pyridine),87 were also studied and their τF values proved somewhat smaller (τF = 3.1 ns;86τF = 2.1 ns, ϕF < 0.0187) than for the mono-DPP compounds. Finally, for the [(thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene)]2(CC) chromophore, only one study was reported, which stated the presence of a strong emission,88 but no photophysical parameters were provided. Concurrently, no photophysical investigation exists on the latter two bis-DPP species placed inside conjugated polymer chains. The main conclusion of this literature survey suggests that going from monomer to polymer, from mono-DPP to bis-DPP, from solution to films and adding a Pt-atom into the chain, all contribute to decrease both τF and ϕF values. An examination of the photophysical data of P1′ indicates that τF = 10.1 ns10 (i.e. greater than that of all DPP species, monoexponential decay; in CH2Cl2; 293 K), and that the ϕF value decreases modestly from 4.56 to 3.45% despite the presence of a long conjugated polymer (Mn = 22400 g mol−1) and a heavy atom (Pt). These data are curious and justify a revisit through the use of P1. Concurrently, P4 is the material that exhibits the most red-shifted absorption band and represents the first conjugated polymer containing a bis-DPP moiety to be investigated for its photophysical properties. P1 and P4 are emissive at 298 (in CH2Cl2) and 77 K (2MeTHF; Fig. 9 and Table 5).

The fluorescence bands exhibit some vibronic features and are a mirror-image of the absorption bands, which is typical of the fluorescence behaviour of DPP. Moreover, the gap between the 0–0 peaks of the absorption and emission (i.e. Stokes shift) bands is small (50–100 cm−1) and these species exhibit emission decay in the ns-time scale at 77 K (note that the larger τF values at 77 K compared to the singlet lifetimes extracted from the fs-TAS at 298 K (below) are due to the combined action of an increase in medium rigidity and lower temperature). Combining these observations permits one to assign this emission to fluorescence. The fluorescence decay is bi-exponential (Fig. 10), which is most likely due to the effect of a polymer chain85 or the presence of many terminal groups (which have a different environment from the internal units). Indeed, the emission spectra exhibit weak shoulders on the blue side of the fluorescence band. This latter outcome is a consequence of the small oligomer sizes of P1 and P4, a phenomenon well-known for trans-Pt(PR3)2(CC)2-containing oligomers.89 The τF values at 298 K are not accessible on our instrument (the FWHM of the nano-LED pulse is only ∼90 ps), so fs-transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) is used instead thus permitting one to measure these rather short singlet excited state lifetimes. This observation is consistent with the conclusion drawn from the literature described above (i.e. τ(S1) is <90 ps). As stated, the DPP-containing species are known to aggregate, and despite many examples of films exhibiting fluorescence,76–81 aggregation-induced quenching of their emission90 has been observed and thus the measurement of their luminescence in the solid state is often reported as unlikely. This is also the case here except for P1, which shows a weak fluorescence (Fig. 11). However, no emission was detected for P4. This weaker intensity compared to that for P1 is consistent with the somewhat shorter singlet lifetimes (2 to 4 fold) extracted from the fs-TAS measurements below. This significant decrease is explained by the energy gap law (which states that as the S0–S1 energy gap decreases, the S1 lifetime decreases since the non-radiative internal conversion process becomes more probable) as recently demonstrated for conjugated organic polymers, including DPP-containing polymers.91

fs-Transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS). 
In order to access the excited state lifetimes of P1 and P4 in solution and as thin films, fs-TAS was used. This technique has also been successfully used to measure the rate of formation of the charge separated state and recombination for (thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene)-containing organic conjugated polymers and various electron acceptors,91 and throughout these previously reported investigations, the S1 lifetime of the pristine polymer films has also been evaluated.92–99 The singlet exciton lifetimes in these films turn out to be highly variable (1.6,94 2.5 and 41,93 8 and 20,94 14,95 15,96 41,97 49,98 and 175 ps).97 For comparison purposes, the (thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene) monomer as a thin film exhibits a singlet exciton lifetime of 150 ± 10 ps.99 The time-evolution of the fs-TAS of P1 and P4 in CH2Cl2 solution (Fig. 12) and as pristine films (Fig. 13) is characterized by strong bleaching bands at 660 (narrow) and 700 nm (broad), along with weaker transient signals evolving in the 500–760 nm window all being formed within the laser pulse. The decay-associated spectra exhibit four species that are easily assigned. The two relatively intense species decaying with ps time constants are the singlet excitons (see details in Table 5). In addition, an intense signal with a similar spectral shape for P1 as a neat film and decaying with a lifetime of 1.5 ps is also assigned to the singlet state. The presence of two or three singlet species is not unseen. Indeed for (thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene)–(naphthyl)n, three ps-components (6.5, 65, and 185 ps) were depicted in the fluorescence decay.85 All these lifetimes associated with the most intense signals, which range from 1.5 to 145 ps, are perfectly consistent with the literature data for DPP-containing organic conjugated polymers mentioned above. The species of weaker intensity and decaying in the fs time scale (470–940 fs) are the S2 species. The excitation wavelength (635 nm) is long enough to excite both the S2 and S1 excited states (see the positions of the calculated transitions in Table 4 for example). Finally, the long-lived species (decaying with a lifetime ≥8 ns (i.e. 7.8 ns or longer) and exhibiting the weakest intensity are mostly triplet excitons). DPP-containing organic polymers are not prone to efficient triplet exciton formation, but these species are known to be occasionally efficiently formed upon charge recombination: (polymer+˙ + (electron acceptor)−˙ → (polymer)* + (electron acceptor), where (polymer)* represents singlet (25%) and triplet (75%) excitons). Indeed, triplet species of (thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene)-containing organic polymers decaying with lifetimes of 8 ns95 and 1.2 to 5.5 ns93 are known. This time scale contrasts with the triplet state lifetime of the monomolecular (thiophene)–DPP–(thiophene) species (14 and 20 ms).100 For the Pt DPP-containing polymer, Schanze and collaborators reported a triplet lifetime of 86 ns.82 Interestingly, P1 and P4 bear striking similarities in emission lifetimes with a recently reported [Pt]-containing polymer, ([Pt]-(AQI(BMPA)2))n (AQI = anthraquinone diimine; BMPA = bis(para-methoxyphenyl)amine), an extremely rare example of a [Pt]-containing polymer that is both fluorescent and phosphorescent.101 For this polymer the τF and τP values are as follow: τF = 10 ps at 298 K; τF = 0.18 (5), 0.80 (5), 3.7 (36), 10.6 ns (54%) at 77 K; τP = 1.1 (22), 4.4 (36), 17.0 ns (42%). Based on these observations, the assignment for the ns-lived species (≥8 ns) for P1 and P4 to a triplet exciton appears secured at 298 K. In the light of the current measurements on P1 (τ(S1) in the ps time scale), the 10 ns lifetime at 298 K reported by Wong and collaborators10 and more recently for polymers analogous to P1 (((thiophene)2[Pt])n)9 appears to be associated with a residual phosphorescence signal. At 77 K, P1 and P4 in 2MeTHF exhibit emission peaks at 537 and 560 nm (see Fig. S29–S32, ESI†), which are in the normal range for the triplet emission of the [Pt] unit (which ranges from 450 nm78,102 to 605 nm103). Their emission decay exhibits bi-exponential components (P1: τP = 13.2 μs (11.4), 150 μs (88.6%); P4: τP = 11.1 μs (18.9), 130 μs (81.1%)). This time scale is common for [Pt]-containing polymers in 2MeTHF at 77 K.57,61

Photoinduced electron transfers between P1, P4 and PCBM
Platinum polyynes are suitable compounds for photovoltaics.104,105 Specifically, DPP-containing conjugated polymers are known to be involved in oxidative photo-induced electron transfers with PCBMs (PC61BM (phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester) and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester)) and fullerene derivatives (polymer* + PCBM → polymer+˙ + PCBM−˙) leading to their fluorescence quenching.106–112P1 and PCBM undergo an obvious fluorescence quenching in their 1:1 blend (Fig. 14), which is consistent with the fact that both products, polymer+˙ + PCBM−˙, are non-emissive. Evidence for electron transfer is readily demonstrated by observing the common and ultrafast triplet state formation upon charge recombination (i.e. DPP-polymer+˙ + (PCBM)−˙ → (DPP-polymer)* + (PCBM), where (DPP-polymer)* represents singlet (25%) and triplet (75%) excitons).93,95 Indeed investigations of DPP-containing organic polymers in the presence of various electron acceptors, including PCBMs, are common,92,97,113–117 and the charge separation usually occurs within the laser pulse.118,119 Most of the time, this time scale turns out to be <250 fs,93–95,98–100 but in one case, a rise time of ∼500 fs for the formation of the polaron has been observed.96 The fs-TAS spectra of the P1/PCBM and P4/PCBM blends (1:1 in weight) in the 500–750 nm range are presented in Fig. 15. The key feature is that the transient signals decaying with a time constant >8 ns (i.e. triplet state) exhibit a significantly higher relative intensity than that measured for triplet species depicted in the pristine polymers (Fig. 13). Moreover, the relative intensity of triplet exciton signals (vs. the other transients) in the blends is also larger compared to that for the pure polymers. Altogether, there is a clear enhancement of the triplet species in the blends indicating the presence of charge separation followed by recombination. This is clearly seen from the decay profiles of the transient signals at various wavelengths where the baseline does not return to zero in the ns time scale (Fig. 16). The other transient species exhibit different responses in comparison with that for the pristine polymers and significantly longer decay (i.e. charge recombination; details in Fig. 15). The associated time scales of recombination, τrec, vary from 4 to 310 ps for P1 and from 1.6 to 220 ps for P4. The slower recombination processes are on a time scale that is consistent with that of other organic DPP/PCBM blends (100 < τrec < 900 ps).93,95,100 The large variability of τrec may be associated with the morphology of the polymer blend.93

The uncertainties on the lifetimes are ±10%. 
 Fig. 16  Decay traces of fs-TAS at various wavelengths for the P1/PCBM and P4/PCBM blends (1:1 in weight). Note that the baseline does not reach zero indicating the formation of triplet species upon charge recombination. 
Attempts to observe the transient (PCBM)−˙ species generally appearing around 1010 nm were also made. The absorption spectrum of (PCBM)−˙ is generally characterized by a broad absorption ranging from 800 to 1100 nm.120 This intermediate was not observed in this work most likely because of its ultrafast formation and consumption. Instead, the transient signal associated with the triplet state of P4 is unambiguously observed at 1010 nm (τ1 > 8 ns) for P4 as thin film (weak) and for P4/PCBM 1:1 blends (very strong; Fig. 17). This result is consistent with the fact that the charge-separated state is formed very rapidly and is readily converted in the triplet state as concluded above (Fig. 15). During the course of this investigation, the time scale for the formation of the T1 state by recombination (P4+˙ + (PCBM)−˙ → P4* + PCBM; P4* are theoretically S1 (25%) and T1 (75%) species) was extracted from the rise time observed on some traces during the triplet formation (Fig. 18). This rise time is ∼3.0 ps. The equivalent traces for P1 were not observed.

Photovoltaic properties
Optical properties
The absorption spectra of P1 and P4 in dilute CHCl3 solution and as thin films were compared and the optical bandgaps estimated from the onset of the thin film absorption spectra were found to be 1.69 eV and 1.41 eV, respectively (Fig. 19).

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of P1 and P4 as polymer donors was investigated by fabricating the photovoltaic solar cells (PSCs) with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1 or P4:PC71BM/PFN/Al. The P1 or P4:PC71BM blends in CHCl3 solution (14 mg mL−1) were spin coated onto the top of PEDOT:PSS to form the active layers. Since the weight ratio of donor to acceptor plays an important role in determining PSC performances, the blend ratio was tuned from 1:05 to 1:2 to obtain the optimal weight ratio of 1:1.5. Without solvent vapour annihilation (SVA) treatment, the PSC with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 showed PCEs of respectively 4.54 and 5.76% for P1 and P4 based active layers. The value of 4.54% for P1 is interesting since it is significantly superior to the PCEs reported for P1′′, P1′′′ and P3 (Chart 1)10 which ranged from 0.28 to 1.40%. With the exception of the side chains, the main differences are that the literature devices were not optimized for the donor and acceptor ratio, the acceptor was PC61BM and there was no SVA treatment.
Subsequently, the optimized active layers were subjected to SVA in THF for 40 s to further optimize the PSC performances. The current–voltage characteristics of the PCEs under illumination with SVA treated P1:PCBM and P4:PCBM active layers and the photovoltaic parameters were acquired (Fig. 20a and Table 6). The best PSC based on P1 exhibited a PCE of 7.12% (Voc = 0.92 V, Jsc = 12.96 mA cm−2) which is lower than that for P4 (PCE = 9.54%, Jsc = 16.24 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V, FF = 0.667). Noteworthily, the value of 9.54% is the highest ever observed for any devices containing the [Pt] unit whether it is contained within a conjugated polymer or a small molecule.121 Compared to the P1 based PSC, the P4 based counterpart showed slightly lower Voc, which may be due to the deeper HOMO energy level of P1, since the Voc of the PSCs based on BHJ active layers is directly proportional to the energy difference between the HOMO of donor and the LUMO of acceptor. The higher value of Jsc for P4 based PSCs compared to the P1 counterpart may stem from the broader absorption profile and low bandgap of P4 compared to P1, since the Jsc of the PSC is directly related to the light harvesting ability of the active layer.

In order to evaluate the photo-response of the PSCs, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the optimized active layer-based devices using both P1 and P4 polymer donors was measured. The IPCE spectra match the absorption profiles of the blend films (Fig. 20b) suggesting that both donor and acceptor materials contribute to the generation in the PSCs. The IPCE values for the P4 based PSC are higher than that for the P1 counterpart. Moreover, the IPCE response in the shorter wavelength region (300–500 nm) is due to the PCBM contribution, whereas the response beyond this region is due to the polymer donors. The Jsc values estimated from the IPCE spectra are respectively 12.79 and 16.08 mA cm−2 for P1 and P4 based PSCs, which are consistent with the values extracted from the J–V characteristics under illumination.
To obtain information on the exciton dissociation and charge carrier collection efficiencies of the PSCs, the variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff)122 was measured (Fig. 21). The Jph is described as Jph = JL − JD, where JD and JL are the current densities of the devices in the dark and under illumination, respectively. The Veff is given by Veff = Vo − Va, where Va is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage when Jph is zero. At low voltages, the Jph increases linearly and tends to saturate around 1.45 and 0.81 V for P1 and P4 based devices, respectively, and completely saturates at high values of Veff for both devices. Therefore, the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers which are then collected at the corresponding electrodes. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and charge collection probability (Pcoll) are defined by Jph/Jsat under short circuit conditions and maximum power point, respectively. The Pdiss/Pcoll values are 0.942/0.73 and 0.972/0.81 for P1 and P4 based devices, respectively. These values are consistent with the measured values of Jsc and FF of the corresponding PSCs. Moreover, the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) in the PSCs is estimated by Gmax = Jphsat/qL (where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer (∼90 nm)) and is 0.97 × 1028 and 1.17 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for P1 and P4, respectively. The higher value of Gmax for the P4 based PSC is consistent with the wider absorption band compared to that for P1.

The charge carrier transport was investigated using the space charge limited current method.123 Devices of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au (hole only) and ITO/Al/active layer/Al (electron only) structures were fabricated to measure the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobility in the active layers and their J–V characteristics in the dark were measured (Fig. 22 (a) hole only, (b) electron only). The μh and μe values for the P1 based active layer are ∼9.93 × 10−5 and 2.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Conversely, the P4 based active layer exhibits μh and μe of ∼2.38 × 10−4 and 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The P4 based active layer shows higher charge carrier mobility with a μe/μh ratio of 1.78 compared to that for the P1 counterpart (2.25). This result indicates that the P4 based layer exhibits a more balanced charge transport, which is favorable to reduce the undesired recombination, thus resulting in higher values of Jsc and FF for the corresponding PSCs.

The variation of Jsc for the PSCs with illumination intensity (Pin) was analyzed to obtain information on the charge carrier recombination processes in the devices using P1 and P4 blended active layers124,125 (Fig. 23). Generally, the relation between Jsc and Pin is described as Jsc ∝ (Pin)α, with α as the degree of bimolecular recombination. For an ideal device, α is about unity, which indicates negligible bimolecular recombination. The linear fitted α value for the P4 based device is ∼0.975, which is higher than that for the P1 counterpart (0.933) indicating that the bimolecular recombination is suppressed in the device based on P4, thus leading to a higher value of FF (Fig. 23). The variation of Voc with ln(Pin) is employed to study the Shockley–Read–Hall charge recombination and trap-assisted recombination. At open circuit, the recombination mechanism can be defined by Voc ∝ n(kT/q)ln(Pin),126 where k, T and q are the Boltzmann constant, the temperature (K), and the elementary charge, respectively. When n = 1, the loss in charge carrier is dominated by bimolecular recombination, whereas trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall recombination is dominant when n = 2. The estimated n values via fitting the above expression with the data are 1.41 and 1.28 for P1 and P4, respectively (Fig. 23). The smaller value of the slope for the P4:PCBM based device indicates a reduced trap-assisted recombination due to the increased crystallinity of P4, which is consistent with the value of FF.
 Fig. 23  Variation of (a) Jsc and (b) Voc for the PSCs based on optimized active layers. 
The transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) were also measured to evaluate the charge decay kinetics in the PSCs (Fig. 24). From the TPC measurements, the P4 based device exhibits a smaller value of charge extraction time (0.51 μs) than that for the P1 counterpart (0.66 μs) under short circuit conditions, which means a faster extraction of the charge carriers in the P4 device as compared to the P1 counterpart. The charge carrier lifetimes were estimated by TPV under an open circuit condition. The relatively long carrier lifetime of the P4 based device (4.12 μs) than that for the P1 counterpart (3.65 μs) implies less recombination and contributes to the higher FF.127

Conclusions
Two [Pt]/DPP-containing polymers were prepared and investigated in detail. One of them was known in the literature (P1) and was used for comparison purposes, whereas the other was new (P4). Very low band gaps were measured for P4. Based on DFT and TDDFT computations, the S1 level is better described as a ππ* excited state rather than an ICT. The photophysical properties of P1 and P4 were thoroughly studied as representative examples and they were found to exhibit fluorescence lifetimes in the ps timescale (1P1* and 1P4*), long enough for efficient photo-induced electron transfer to PCBM. Indeed, the fs-TAS data indicate that the electron transfer is ultrafast (<113–128 fs) and quickly evolved towards the formation of the triplet state (1P4* + PCBM → P4+˙ + (PCBM)−˙ → 3P4* + PCBM). In one of the two polymers investigated (P4), the timescale for recombination was established from the observation of its rise time (∼3 ps). Overall, these new organometallic materials exhibit many photophysical features associated with the presence of the DPP unit in the chain as for the numerous organic versions reported in the literature, and the presence of the [Pt] residue is shown to be clearly not detrimental. The photovoltaic performances of P1 and P4 were also investigated by fabricating the photovoltaic solar cells (PSCs) with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(P1 or P4):PC71BM/PFN/Al with SVA treatment. Under illumination, the best PCE obtained for P1 is 7.12% (Voc = 0.92 V, Jsc = 12.96 mA cm−2) which is lower than that for P4 (PCE = 9.54%, Jsc = 16.24 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V, FF = 0.667). The higher value of PCE for P4 based PSCs is associated with the improved values of Jsc and FF and is related to the larger value of exciton generation rate, more balanced charge transport, charge collection, faster extraction and longer charge carrier lifetime. The important outcome of this work is the PCE value of 9.54% for DPP dimer-containing metallooligomer P4, which is the highest ever obtained for [Pt]-containing polymers or small molecules.
Experimental
General information
All the reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. All the chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers (Fischer Scientific, Sigma-Aldrich, Strem Chemicals, VWR chemicals) and used as received. The solvents (tetrahydrofuran (THF), methylene dichloride (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), trimethylamine (Et3N), …) were dried and distillated before use. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck Silica gel 60 T254 (coated on an aluminium sheet). Column chromatography was performed using silica gel (40–63 μm). NMR 1H, 13C and 31P spectra were recorded on BRUKER Avance III400 and BRUKER Advance III500 in CDCl3 and CH2Cl2 using TMS (Si(CH3)4) as an internal standard. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million. The following notation is used to designate the NMR signals: s: singlet, d: doublet, t: triplet, m: multiplet, br: broad. Attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR IR) spectra were recorded on powders using Spectrum Two spectrometer from PerkinElmer. Samples were analyzed by ESI-MS on a high-resolution and high-accuracy mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap Elite, Thermo Scientific) in positive ion mode. Samples were dissolved in dichloromethane at a concentration between 1 and 5 pmol μL−1 according to the sample. They were infused at a flow rate of 3 μL min−1. The following experimental conditions were applied: spray high voltage, 3 kV; source temperature, 350 °C; sheath gas flow rate, 10. External calibration was carried out using the Pierce LTQ Velos ESI positive ion calibration solution. The resolution was set at 240000 at m/z 400. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) experiments were performed by MALDI-TOF/MS (Ultraflex, Bruker Daltonique) in positive ion mode and in reflectron or linear modes. The ion-accelerating voltage was 20 kV. One μL of sample was deposited on the target and was covered with the matrix (dithranol or trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB)). External calibrations were carried out using the standard protein mixture (Peptide Calibration Standard kit, Bruker Daltonique). At least 150 laser shots were summed for each spectrum. Raw data were processed using Flex Analysis. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses were carried out on the GPC prominence Shimadzu with UV-visible detector SPD-20AV (Double wavelength), a metallooligomer concentration of 1 mg mL−1 was used and the solutions were filtered through a 0.45 micron filter before injection. Average molecular weights (Mw, Mn) were determined by GPC against polystyrene standards. THF was used as an eluent with a 1 mL min−1 flow rate.
DFT and TD-DFT computation
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to validate the targets Ln and Pn by using the Gaussian09 at the Université de Sherbrooke with the Mammouth supercomputer supported by Le Réseau Québécois De Calculs Hautes Performances. The DFT geometry optimizations and Time Dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were carried out using the pbe0 method. A 6-31g* basis set was used for C, H, and N atoms. It is important to note that DFT calculations for all the molecules were made using a dichloromethane solvent field.
Physical measurements

Metallooligomer thin film preparation. 
The solution of the metallooligomers (5 mg mL−1) in CH2Cl2 was spin-coated using LabSpin6/8 from SÜSS MicroTec on glass and quartz substrates at 3000 rpm for 100 seconds at 600 rpm s−1 acceleration. The film thicknesses were determined using a KLA-Tencor D-120 stylus profilometer. UV-visible analyses in CH2Cl2 were performed using the PerkinElmer (Lambda 35) UV-vis Spectrometer (250–900 nm) in transmission mode. The UV-vis spectra (200–900 nm) of the film coated on quartz substrates were recorded using a Cary 4000 spectrophotometer (Agilent Corporation) in transmission mode using the double-beam mode.


Photoemission analysis. 
UV-visible spectroscopy was performed on a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer for solutions and films at 298 K and on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrometer for solutions at 77 K. Steady-state measurements of emission and excitation spectra were made using a Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 Phosphorimeter equipped with a single monochromator. Solutions for 298 K measurements were prepared in a glovebox to avoid excited state quenching by O2 and sealed in an airtight 1 cm cell. Low temperature measurements were made in an NMR tube using a homemade sample holder. Films were made by spin-coating the polymers on 2.5 cm quartz discs. Measurements exceeding 800 nm were performed using a Photon Technology International QuantaMaster 400 phosphorimeter coupled with a NIR PMT-7-B detector. The fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed on the FLS980 using a 378 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser. The electrochemical measurements were carried out using a BioLogic SP-300 apparatus, at room temperature, under an argon atmosphere, in a three-electrode cell containing anhydrous acetonitrile (MeCN, 10 mL) as the solvent and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, 10−1 mol L−1) as the supporting salt at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The reference electrode was a saturated Hg/Hg2Cl2 reference electrode (further noted as SCE for Saturated Calomel Electrode) from Radiometer. It was separated from the cell solution by a bridge compartment filled with the same solvent/supporting electrolyte solution as used in the cell. The counter electrode was a platinum wire. The working electrode was a disk obtained from a cross-section of a platinum wire (d = 5 mm) sealed in Teflon. Metallooligomer thin films were cast from dichloromethane solution on a platinum disc working electrode (d = 5 mm), and the cyclic voltammograms were recorded in acetonitrile solution containing TBAPF6 (10−1 mol L−1) as the supporting salt at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.


Device fabrication and characterization. 
The polymer solar cells with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of P1 and P4 as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor. PSCs were fabricated using ITO coated glass substrates (10 Ω sq−1) which were cleaned with detergent water, deionized water, acceptor and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath sequentially for 20 min, and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C. A thin layer (∼35 nm) of PEDOT:PSS was first spin coated on the pre-cleaned ITO coated glass substrates at 3500 rpm and baked at 110 °C for 15 min under ambient conditions. The blend of P1 or P4 and PC71BM with different weight ratios (constant concentration 16 mg mL−1) was prepared in chloroform solution and spin cast onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at a speed of 2500 rpm and then dried at room temperature. For the solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment, optimized blended thin films were exposed to THF vapors for 40 s. The thickness of the active layers is about 90 nm (±5 nm). The PFN as an electron transport layer was spin coated on the top of the active layer at 3000 rpm from a methanol solution. Finally, the Al electrode was thermally evaporated onto the top of the PFN layer at a pressure less than 10−5 Pa. A shadow mask was used to define the PSC active area (16 mm2). The current–voltage characteristics of the PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A 300 W xenon solar simulator with an AM1.5 filter operated at 100 mW cm−2 was used to simulate the AM1.5G solar irradiation. The charge carrier mobility (hole and electron mobility) of the active layer was determined by fitting the dark current–voltage characteristics of the hole-only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au) and the electron device (ITO/Al/active layer/Al) to the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. Transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were made under the short circuit condition to explore the time dependent extraction of photo-generated charge carriers. The 10 ns light pulse was chosen as the light source. The devices were kept in the dark between pulses in order to avoid any influence of pulse frequency on the current responses. Transient photovoltage measurements were made under open circuit conditions to explore the photovoltage decay. The photovoltage decay kinetics of devices follow a non-exponential decay: δ(v) = Aexp(−t/τ), where t is the time and τ is the charge carrier life-time, and give information about the degree of charge recombination.

Synthesis of L1. 
The procedure was inspired from the literature, Q. Liu, C-L. Ho, Y. H. Lo, H. Li, W-Y. Wong. J. Inorg. Organomet. Polym., 2015, 25, 159. The dibrominated precursor 3 (235.0 mg, 0.33 mmol) was dissolved in the mixture methylene dichloride/triethylamine: 15 mL/15 mL. CuI (6.3 mg, 33.1 μmol, 10 mol%), trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA) (81.26 mg, 0.83 mmol) and PPh3 (17.31 mg, 66.0 μmol, 20 mol%) were added. The solution was degassed with an argon stream for 30 min, and then Pd(OAc)2 (7.43 mg, 33.1 μmol, 10 mol%) was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight and monitored by TLC (Rf = 0.6, using CH2Cl2/pentane (50/50) as an eluent). The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using pentane/CH2Cl2 (60/40) as an eluent to provide L1 as a purple solid (196.41 mg, 0.264 mmol, 80% yield). 1H NMR (500 MHz CDCl3) δ (ppm): 8.87 (d, 2H, J = 4.1 Hz), 7.33 (d, 2H, J = 4.2 Hz), 4.03 (t, 4H, J = 7.7 Hz), 1.72 (m, 4H), 1.40–1.23 (m, 34H*), 0.87 (m, 9H*), 0.28 (s, 18H), *: nonyl side chains on DPP + supplementary hydrogens from aliphatic residues such as pentane; 13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 161.28, 139.32, 135.42, 133.90, 130.49, 128.57, 108.85, 104.48, 96.77, 42.47, 31.97, 30.32, 29.58, 29.36, 26.98, 22.80, 14.26, 0.15. IR (cm−1): v = 2920 and 2853 (w, v(C–H)), 2145 (w, v(CC)), 1657 (w, v(CO)); HRMS (ESI) calculated for (L1) C42H60N2O2S2Si2 (M + H)+: m/z 745.364. Found: m/z 745.365 (Fig. S2, ESI†); Tm.p. (°C) = 179.


Synthesis of L4. 
In a flame-dried schlenk flask, the crude material composed of 6 and 6′ (173.0 mg) was dissolved in methylene dichloride/triethylamine (10 mL/10 mL). Then, copper iodide (2.1 mg, 11.0 μmol), trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA) (21.60 mg, 0.22 mmol) and PPh3 (3.0 mg, 11.4 μmol) were added. The solution was degassed with an argon stream for 15 min before adding Pd(OAc)2 (1.50 mg, 6.70 μmol). The reaction mixture was heated at 60 °C overnight and monitored by TLC (Rf = 0.60, using CH2Cl2/pentane (50/50)). The solution was cooled to room temperature and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with a solvent combination of n-hexane/CH2Cl2 (60/40, v/v) as an eluent to provide L4 as a dark green solid (106.0 mg). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 8.97 (d, 2H, J = 4.2 Hz), 8.86 (d, 2H, J = 4.1 Hz), 7.44 (d, 2H, J = 4.2 Hz), 7.33 (d, 2H, J = 4.1 Hz), 4.07 (m, 8H), 1.75–1.25 (m, 136H*), 0.86–0.81 (m, 29H*), *: nonyl side chains on DPP + supplementary hydrogens from aliphatic residues such as pentane, 0.29 (s, 18H), 0.07 (TMS residue, Si(CH3)4). 13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 161.44, 161.42, 141.43, 139.35, 139.23, 136.94, 135.48, 134.00, 130.75, 130.12, 128.78, 126.67, 109.28, 104.64, 97.01, 42.64, 32.11, 30.33, 29.97, 29.77, 29.51, 27.20–27.15, 22.91, 14.31, 1.27, 0.02 (TMS residue). IR (cm−1): v = 2921 and 2850 (w, v(C–H)), 2139 (w, v(CC)), 1660 (w, v(CO)). HRMS (ESI) Calculated for (L4) C74H102N4O4S4Si2 [M + H]+: m/z 1295.632. Found: m/z 1295.634 (Fig. S5, ESI†); Tm.p. (°C) = 260.

Synthesis of metallooligomers Pn

Synthesis of P1. 
The procedure was inspired from the literature, Y. Yuan, T. Michinobu, J. Oguma, T. Kato and K. Miyake, Macromol. Chem. Phys., 2013, 214, 1465; W.-Y. Wong, X. Wang, H.-L. Zhang, K.-Y. Cheung, M.-K. Fung, A. B. Djurišic and W.-K. Chan, J. Organomet. Chem., 2008, 693, 3603. In a 10 mL flame-dried schlenk, the diethynyl ligand L1 (1 eq.), copper iodide (10 mol%) and trans-dichlorobis(tributyl-phosphine)platinum(II) (trans-[PtCl2(PBu3)2]) (1 eq.) were added. These solids were degassed with three cycles of argon/vacuum. They were dissolved in a solvent mixture of freshly distilled and degassed CH2Cl2/Et3N (4/2, v/v), and finally tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) (2 eq., 1 mol L−1 in solution in THF) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours under argon. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by precipitation in methylene dichloride/methanol (50/50, v/v). In addition, the solid was dissolved in methylene dichloride and purified by Bio Bead® gel filtration to remove the metallic residues and the remaining ligand. After evaporation, the solid was washed with warm methanol to yield the platinum(II) polyyne oligomer P1 as a dark colored solid. The characterization is in agreement with results obtained in the literature on a compound analogous to P1 (with R = n-C6H13): Q. Liu, C.-L. Ho, Y. H. Lo, H. Li and W.-Y. Wong. J. Inorg. Organomet. Polym., 2015, 25, 159, 1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ (ppm)): 8.98 (m, 2H), 6.96 (m, 2H), 4.03 (m, 4H), 2.10 (m, 12H), 1.72–1.25 (m, 42H*), 0.95–0.87 (m, 26H*) Si(CH3)4 at 0.07 ppm, *: nonyl side chains on DPP + supplementary hydrogens because of the presence of aliphatic residues such as pentane. 31P-NMR (CDCl3, δ (ppm)): 3.96 ppm, 1J(31P–195Pt) = 2289 Hz, IR (cm−1): v = 2924 and 2851 (w, v(C–H)), 2077 (w, v(CC)), 1657 (w, v(CO)) and 1548. Tdec. = 221 ± 5 °C; GPC (THF): Mn = 18200 g mol−1, Mw = 38900 g mol−1, Mw/Mn = 2.14.


Synthesis of P4. 
In a 10 mL flame-dried schlenk, the diethynyl ligand L4 (0.25 eq.), copper iodide (10 mol%) and trans-dichlorobis(tributyl-phosphine)platinum(II) (trans-[PtCl2(Pn-Bu3)2]) (1 eq.) were added. These solids were degassed with three cycles of argon/vacuum. Afterwards, they were dissolved in a solvent mixture of freshly distilled and degassed CH2Cl2/Et3N (4/2, v/v). Finally, tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) (0.5 eq.) was added. Three sequential additions of L4 (0.25 eq.) and TBAF (0.5 eq.) were performed with 2 hour intervals. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature for two additional hours under argon. The reaction was monitored by 31P NMR. The reaction was stopped and treated when the signal at 7 ppm ([Pt(Cl)(L4)(PBu3)2]) disappeared and was replaced by a signal at 3.88 ppm (trans-[Pt(L4)(PBu3)2]n, P4). The reaction workup was performed. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by precipitation in the methylene dichloride/methanol (50/50, v/v) mixture. The solid was dissolved in methylene dichloride and purified by Bio Bead® gel filtration to remove the metallic residues and the remaining ligand. After evaporation, the solid was washed with warm methanol to yield the platinum(II) polyyne oligomer P4 as a dark blue solid. The 1H NMR characterization is in agreement with the results for similar compounds from the literature: S. Stas, J.-Y. Balandier, V. Lemaur, O. Fenwick, G. Tregnago, F. Quist, F. Cacialli, J. Cornil and Y. H. Geerts, Dyes Pigm., 2013, 97, 198. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, CD2Cl2): 9.06–8.93 (m, 4H), 7.49 (m, 2H), 7.01 (m, 2H), 4.10–4.02 (m, 8H), 2.16–0.86 (m, 150H*) Si(CH3)4 at 0.07 ppm, *: nonyl side chains on DPP + supplementary hydrogens because of the presence of aliphatic residues such as pentane. 31P-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): 3.88 ppm, 1J(31P–195Pt) = 2290 Hz. IR (cm−1): v = 2922 and 2852 (w, v(C–H)), 2081 (w, v(CC)), 1661 (w, v(CO)) and 1547. Tdec. = 261 ± 5 °C; GPC (THF): Mn = 6600 g mol−1, Mw = 73000 g mol−1, Mw/Mn = 11.1. Note that the solution of P4 in THF tends to undergo discoloration with time. Instability of the metallooligomer is strongly suspected. This suspicion is corroborated by the presence of a new peak at longer retention time in the GPC traces, which does not match the ligand based on the resulting 1H NMR and High-resolution ESI-MS spectra.
