1. Introduction
As a combustible energy resource, coal is the most abundant and affordable resource for consumption in the world. Coal is widely utilized in fields such as steel smelting, power supply, and chemical production, including coking, gasification and liquefaction, which greatly affects our daily lives. Commonly, coal consists of two components: an amorphous carbon chain composed of an aliphatic structure and an abundance of crystalline carbon regions formed by a condensed aromatic ring structure.1 However, its complex compositions and structural features obstruct its wide use in mechanical, electrical and optical applications. Developing coal as high-value-added materials will contribute to fulfilling the strategic target of “Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality”.
Carbon dots (CDs) are a new category of carbon nanomaterial with some fascinating properties, which are regarded as next-generation green nanomaterials.2 CDs are zero-dimensional carbon materials of a size below 10 nm, which are impurities in the purification of single-walled carbon nanotubes, as reported by Xu et al. (2004).3 Currently, extensive attention has been paid to CDs owing to their several advantages, such as abundant carbon source, low cost, excellent biocompatibility,4,5 water solubility,6–8 and fascinating fluorescent properties.9–11 Additionally, CDs are widely applied for bioimaging,12–15 sensing,16–19 lubrication,20 solar cells,21–23 catalysis,24–27 batteries,28,29etc. Various carbon materials can be adopted to prepare CDs, such as graphite,30 graphene,31 glucose,32 carbon nanotubes and carbon fibers,33,34 and citric acid,35,36 and even biomass like the leaves37,38 and fruits of plants.39,40 Thus, the properties of CDs are diverse and intriguing, and are closely related to the corresponding precursor materials. Due to their similar structural characteristics, coal and coal-derived materials are promising precursors to synthesize CDs. What is more, their features of a relatively loose pore structure, and rich heterogeneous atoms such as sulfur and nitrogen, make them more suitable for preparing high-performances CDs.
CDs can be synthesized by “top-down” or “bottom-up” strategies.2,41 The former involves the stripping, partial etching, and modifying/smashing of bulk natural biomass or coal by acid oxidation,42 laser ablation,43,44 arc discharge45–47 and electrochemical oxidation48 to produce small-sized CDs, while the latter adopts small molecules as the carbon sources, and the CDs can be obtained by condensation reactions occurring in chemical oxidation, hydrothermal,49 solvothermal7 and microwave methods.15,50,51 CDs obtained from coal blocks and coal-derived material (coal-based CDs) usually have abundant functional groups and surface-active sites, excellent electron transfer efficiency, upconversion properties, high specific surface area, and a tunable light-trapping range. In particular, coal-based CDs also have excellent photo-induced redox properties, making them highly attractive for photocatalysis and energy storage. The applications of coal-based CDs from different rank coals and coal tar pitch are shown in Scheme 1.

Up to now, numerous works have been published on the synthesis, properties and applications of CDs. However, a focused review on CDs from different rank coals together with their derivatives is rare yet necessary. Herein, the research achievements for coal-based CDs obtained from different rank coals and derivatives in recent years are provided in terms of synthesis strategies, unique structures and properties. Notably, this minireview is intended to present the critical role and contribution of coal along with its derivatives in preparing coal-based CDs, promoting more significant breakthroughs in developing high-value-added coal-derived product engineering. Finally, the outlook for future research tendencies and challenges in constructing coal-based CDs for photocatalytic and electrochemical systems is proposed.
2. The macromolecular structural characteristics of coal
Coal is a sedimentary organic rock formed by the biochemical transformation of plant remains, after a physicochemical transformation, which also contains varying amounts of minerals. Understanding the structural characteristics of coals with different degrees of coalification at the molecular level is vital for the production of CDs from coal and its derivatives. To date, researchers have proposed hundreds of structural models for coal, including those for lignite, bituminous coal and anthracite. The structural unit models for coals with different degrees of coalification for coal tar pitch are shown in Fig. 1.

It is generally accepted that coal macromolecules are composed of condensed (hydrogenated) aromatic thick rings linked by various bridging bonds, such as –CH2–, –CH2–CH2–, –O–, –S–, and Car–Car. As can be seen from Fig. 1, as the degree of coalification increases, the structural units turn regular. Meanwhile, the number of side chains and functional groups decreases. Lignite and coal tar pitch have rich oxygenated functional groups and a lower carbon content; however, bituminous coal and anthracite have a higher carbon content and aromatic carbon fraction. The higher the coal rank, the more closely aligned the aromatic lamellae. Thus, a key to achieving the scalable and controllable preparation of coal-based CDs is using reasonable and cost-competitive preparation strategies for coals with different degrees of metamorphism and their derivatives.
3. Synthesis of coal-based CDs from diverse coal types and their properties
The dimensions, fluorescence color, optical properties, and core structure of the obtained CDs vary depending on the degree of coalification of the coal. In recent years, coal and coal derivatives, including anthracite,53,54 bituminous coal,55 lignite,56 and coal tar pitch,57 have been successively developed as carbon sources for the synthesis of CDs. A schematic illustration of forming CDs from anthracite, lignite and coal tar pitch using chemical oxidation is shown in Scheme 2.

3.1 Lignite
Lignite is easy to synthesize CDs due to its low coal rank, loose sponge structure and great reactivity, which can be disintegrated in a short time. Turning lignite into nanoscale carbon quantum dots (CQDs) occurred via J-type aggregation due to self-assembly into a specific head-to-tail molecular arrangement,61 with an increase in the CQD concentration. For example, Yu et al.59 provided a simple and green approach to efficiently produce high-yield CQDs from low-grade lignite and in situ synthesized CQDs/TiO2 heterostructure nanocomposites. In this work, they mixed H2O2 and formic acid by ultra-sonication, and added lignite from Inner Mongolia. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 3 h. Then, the products in sizes of 1.2–2.4 nm were obtained by filtration and dialysis, which could be uniformly dispersed in ethanol or water. The yield of CQDs was ca. 50%. As can be seen in Fig. 2a-b, the lignite-derived CQDs exhibited a clear concentration-dependent red-shift absorption. The excitation spectra and emission spectra of different CQD concentrations were also red-shifted with increasing concentration under excitation at a single detection wavelength of 500 nm and a single excitation wavelength of 380 nm. Moreover, as demonstrated in Fig. 2c, the maximum emission spectra and excitation spectra of the CQDs were red-shifted as the CQD concentration increased from 0.05 g L−1 to 2 g L−1. The emission spectra and excitation spectra show red-shifting due to the narrowing of the energy band as a result of the interactions and energy transmission in the aggregates. The higher the concentration, the larger the size, and the more obvious the red-shift trend. In addition, due to aggregation-induced quenching effects, non-functionalized CDs readily participate in strong π–π stacking and exhibit faint or no photoluminescence.62 Thiyagarajan and his team63 successfully synthesized carbon quantum dots (CD3) by treating lignite with laser ablation using ethylenediamine (EDA) solution as an auxiliary. The strongest emission peak of CD3 was red-shifted to ∼460 nm as the solution concentration increased, which was caused by J-type aggregation, as illustrated in Fig. 2d–f. The contours were slightly elongated due to the formation of self-assembled J-aggregates extending the excitation of the S-band into the red region. These behaviors clearly suppress the emission owing to C-band excitation, which leads to a relatively faint contour at ∼275 nm.

3.2 Bituminous coal
CDs obtained from Xinjiang bituminous coal also have remarkable unique catalytic properties such as the quantum confinement effect. Zhang et al.64 obtained dark brown carbon quantum dots (CNPs) by a chemical oxidation method using Xinjiang bituminous coal as precursor, and the particle size distribution of the products was 2–12 nm, with a spherical structure. The lattice spacing was 0.21 nm, and the structure was like graphite. In this work, the carriers were efficiently transferred to the material surface together with electrons from the CNPs during the photocatalytic reduction reaction, which was caused by the quantum confinement effect of the CNPs. The CNPs played a significant role as electron storage and transfer channels, which can obstruct the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
3.3 Anthracite
Anthracite has the highest rank and contains a large tight aromatic ring structure, which is suitable for the preparation of CQDs. Jia et al.53 invented a simple, fast and green route to produce CQDs with tunable bandgap from anthracite. The bandgap adjustment of the prepared CQDs can be accomplished by simple control over the concentration of H2O2, which can adjust the emission color from yellow to blue under visible light. To explain the PL mechanism of CQDs, the team proposed two different emission modes: intrinsic and extrinsic. The blue light might come from the former and the yellow–green light might come from the latter, because oxygen-containing functional groups within the CQD band gap generate new energy states. However, the oxidation method introduces many oxygen-containing functional groups to the carbon quantum dots, which will excite the non-radiative complexation of electron–hole pairs and thus reduce the quantum yields. Li et al.60 prepared N-CDs from Taixi coal with a high QY by a one-pot solvothermal chemistry approach. As the light components were well dispersed in the solvent and the smaller sp2-carbon structure was easily stripped from the anthracite, the N-CDs displayed QY up to 47.0% and production yield up to 25.6 wt.%.
3.4 Coal tar pitch
In addition to coal of different coal grades, the coal chemical industry annually produces a large amount of coal tar pitch (CTP) and other coal derivatives. The basic molecular structural unit of CTP consists of a polyaromatic hydrocarbon nucleus and several alkyl side chains or heteroatom functional groups bonded to the aromatic nucleus. Therefore, CTP has been noted by a wide range of researchers due to its characteristics as natural quantum dots. Our team65 fabricated GQDs by heating and refluxing a mixture of CTP and H2O2 at 100 °C for 2 h, which paved the way for the mass production of fluorescent GQDs. Numerous oxygen functional groups were possessed by the prepared GQDs with graphene-like structure, so that such GQDs were extremely soluble in aqueous solution. Furthermore, Bai et al.66 prepared CDs with a tunable size from CTP through a hydrothermal method. By increasing the amount of NaOH added, the particle size of the CDs increased, and the sp2 domain of the CDs was enlarged, resulting in a decrease in bandgap and an enhancement in the light adsorbing ability.
In summary, the properties of prepared coal-based CDs are greatly influenced by the type of coal. In general, it is observed that lower rank coals such as bituminous coal and lignite produce more oxygen functional groups on the nanomaterials, while higher rank coals such as anthracite provide more products graphitized in the carbon framework.67 Compared to raw coal, coal tar pitch has a very low ash content which reduces subsequent purification steps and facilitates the low-cost preparation of carbon dots. For the convenience of overall comprehension, coal-based CDs prepared by different methods using coal and coal tar pitch as carbon sources, and their sizes and yields are summarized in Table 1.

The following conclusions can be drawn from the comparison. Compared to other methods, chemical oxidation is a common method for the preparation of carbon dots, which are richer in oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface and have good hydrophilic properties. The preparation of CDs by H2O2 oxidation is facile and resource-saving, and the subsequent purification process is uncomplicated, which is conducive to large-scale production. But the low yield of ozone oxidation hinders the application of this approach. The microwave method takes less time to prepare CDs, but the size is too large to make it suitable for optical and energy storage applications. The physical ultrasound method does not require chemical reagents and causes less pollution, but it is highly energy-consuming and the size of the CDs is not uniform.
4. Coal-based CDs for photocatalysis
Their tunable energy bands, absorption spectra spanning the blue to near-infrared region, unique photoelectron transfer properties and fluorescence behavior make coal-based CDs potentially excellent photocatalysts. Moreover, CDs can act as great electron acceptors and donors due to their peculiar electronic structure. After light excitation, the recombination of electron–hole pairs can be well restrained due to the inherent surface defects of coal-based CDs. Therefore, coal-based CDs can be accessed as mono-photocatalysts or combined with other materials to form composite photocatalysts with greatly improved catalytic activity. Recently, many studies related to the photocatalytic applications of coal-based CDs have been published, including photodegradation,59 photoreduction,80,81 and photooxidation.82,83 Of all of these, coal-based CDs are most widely applied for photodegradation, so details of their application to photodegradation are discussed in the following section.
The incorporation of coal-based CDs into some nanomaterials for the photodegradation of large organic molecules has attracted rising interest from researchers, including rhodamine B (RhB),68 pulping black liquor,64 hydroquinone (HQ) and tertbutyl hydroquinone (TBHQ).80 For instance, Yu et al.59 fabricated a CQDs/TiO2 composite photocatalyst which could improve photocatalytic performance for the degradation of toxic RhB under light. Ti–O–C bonds were formed at the heterostructure interface between the CQDs and TiO2, which significantly accelerated the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, good energy band matching exists between the CQDs and TiO2 that can act as an electron donor in the CQD/TiO2 heterostructure nanocomposites. Thus, the CQDs can reliably transfer photoexcited electrons from themselves to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, which will provide more electrons to take part in the photocatalytic reaction and hinder the recombination of h+ and e− pairs at the same time. Fig. 3a shows the degradation rates of rhodamine B over TiO2 particles and CQDs/TiO2, respectively. After visible light irradiation for 180 min, the degradation efficiency for rhodamine B was found to be about 10% over TiO2 particles, while 95% conversion was achieved over 2 wt% CQDs/TiO2 under identical reaction conditions. What is more, it has been demonstrated that the coupling of CDs with TiO2 can increase the utilization of TiO2 in visible light, which can improve the catalytic activity of the composite catalyst. For example, Zhang et al.68 prepared effective CTP/TiO2 composite photocatalysts by a facile green one-step solvothermal approach using CTP as a feedstock. The as-prepared CTP/TiO2 composite photocatalysts degraded more pollutant RhB than pure TiO2 under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3b, the degradation efficiency progressively increased from 41.0% to 91.1% as the CTP content increased from 1% to 5%, which demonstrated that the visible light photocatalytic performance of TiO2 could be significantly improved by introducing a suitable amount of CTP. There is a 23 times higher apparent degradation rate constant for the optimal CTP/TiO2 composite photocatalyst than for pure TiO2. This was attributed to electronic coupling between the states of CTP and the conduction band states of TiO2, which resulted in a narrower band gap of the CTP/TiO2 compound than that of pure TiO2. Due to the photo-induced electron transfer property of the CTP, the photocatalyst exhibited good stability as can be seen in Fig. 3c. In addition, Bai et al.66 prepared CDs with tunable size through a hydrothermal method using CTP as precursor and NaOH as additive. As the size of the CDs increased from 1.9 to 5.8 nm, the CD-supported Pt exhibited a 70% enhancement in solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Sun et al.25 prepared composite nanoparticle Ag/CDs using a silver mirror reaction, which was applied to the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 for the preparation of methanol. The CDs were synthesized by H2O2 oxidation using inexpensive coal. Compared to individual Ag and CDs, the composite nanoparticles exhibit better photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, which is mainly caused by the broad absorption spectrum extending into the visible range and the low recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.

Uncovering the catalytic mechanisms behind those photocatalytic reactions is of great significance and necessity. Some probable reaction mechanisms have been offered by related researchers. Hu et al.84 explained the reason for the improved performance of the CDs@Ag3PO4 nanocomposites. Such an apparent enhancement can be mainly attributed to the CDs@Ag3PO4 heterostructure system: As shown in Fig. 3d, the energy band-edge position of CDs@Ag3PO4 was adjusted compared with Ag3PO4, accelerating the migration of photogenerated electrons. In addition, the heterojunction interface formed between CD and Ag3PO4 can enhance photocatalytic performance, by facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges. Zhang et al.64 proposed a composite of CDs and TiO2 that could restrain the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs of TiO2 and enhance their separation efficiency, resulting in an enhancement in its photocatalytic performance. Yan et al.85 reviewed the photoluminescence mechanisms of various photocatalytic materials compounded with CDs, which were supported by pertinent experimental data and rational analysis. However, the reaction mechanism of coal-based CDs is still being explored, and a breakthrough will be achieved in the near future.
5. Coal-based CDs for energy storage
With abundant raw materials, low cost, multiple active sites, rich functional groups, large specific surface area and good electrical conductivity, coal-based CDs have gradually become a research hotspot in recent years in the field of energy storage, including capacitors, solar cells, sodium-ion batteries, and lithium-ion battery energy storage systems. Here, we present some current research that is relevant to energy storage by coal-based CDs and an in-depth discussion is provided.
Coal-based CDs, as types of carbon nanomaterials, can theoretically be assembled in various ways as electrode materials. Zhang et al.75 developed a facile template-assisted assembly strategy to prepare hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets (HPCNs) for supercapacitor electrodes by using coal-based graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as building blocks. The capacity activated with a specific surface area (SSA) of 1450 m2 g−1 HPCNs can reach 230 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 under optimized conditions, which results from an appropriate amount of Mg(OH)2 template and KOH activator. Such an important process can produce looser two-dimensional carbon nanosheets with abundant energy storage sites and an interconnected structure with a large specific surface area, good conductivity for electrochemical processes and microporous/mesoporous structures favorable for ion migration. The types of precursor and template have an important effect on the microstructure of carbon nanosheets obtained by assembly of coal-based CDs, and ultimately influence the performance of the capacitor. As illustrated in Fig. 4, Chang et al.86 synthesized a 2D porous carbon nanosheet (PCN) using an industrial sulfonated pitch by-product as a carbon source, and triblock copolymer P123 as a soft-template, by a simple interface self-assembly, KOH activation and annealing strategy. PCN1-800 exhibited a more ordered microstructure with slightly curved surface and prominent flexibility, ultrathin thickness, and plentiful micropores and small mesopores, basically without larger mesopores or macropores. Such a special structure provides plenty of ion-adsorption sites and ion-transport channels for this PCN. Correspondingly, the EDLC showed a high volumetric capacitance of 90.1 F cm−3 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, an outstanding rate capability C20/0.05 of 71%, and a great high-voltage endurance lifetime of 88% after 5000 cycles at 1 A g−1.

In addition, coal-based CD modified electrode material is an effective method to address many problems, such as improving electronic conductivity and accelerating ion transport, increasing the active area of composites, and adjusting the size and morphology of metal/metal oxide. As shown in Fig. 5a, Zhang et al.87,88 prepared coal-based graphene quantum dots (C-GQDs) using Taixi anthracite powder as the raw material via an acid oxidation method, and successfully synthesized C-GQDs/α-Fe2O3 composites by an electrodeposition technique. The C-GQDs/α-Fe2O3 composites exhibited a specific capacitance of 1582.5 mA g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a specific capacity retention of 1320 mA h g−1 after 110 cycles, which could reach 1091 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 (Fig. 5b-c). The excellent cyclability and rate capability can be ascribed to the special antler-shaped structure of α-Fe2O3 and the ‘bridge effect’ of the interconnected C-GQDs in the antler-shaped skeleton, which enhances the conductive properties of the composites. At the same time, the protective layer and many porous spaces of the C-GQDs buffer the volume expansion so that the integrity of the electrodes is maintained.

The strategy of modifying electrode materials with coal-based CDs has been considered a promising approach to improve the performance of various functional materials,88 so that coal-based CDs can bring us unlimited possibilities. The modified electron transfer properties of coal-based CDs have been used in many other energy storage applications, as proven in several works reported recently. However, the mechanism of the regulation and modification of coal-based CDs on electrode materials has not yet been clearly worked out and it will take a lot of effort to make significant progress in the future.
6. Summary and future outlook
In this minireview, recent advances in the application of coal-based CDs for photocatalysis and energy storage are overviewed and discussed in detail, which enables us to gain a deeper understanding of coal-based CDs. Coal-based CDs have different properties, which should be a response to the different internal microcrystalline structures of the different coal grades. Since coal resources are abundant and the synthesis of coal-based CDs has the benefits of simplicity, low cost, greenness and high efficiency, the mass production of coal-based CDs has become a reality. It is clear that CD-based photocatalysts have great potential for solar energy conversion. What is more, the addition of CDs into the synthesis system of metal oxides and metal elements can not only enhance the conductivity of electrode materials, but also act as a functional inducer to adjust the morphology and structure of CDs and reduce the size of particles, which provides a new possibility for designing high-capacity electrode materials.
However, some fundamental issues have still not been resolved and are under investigation: for example, coal and its derivatives have uncertainties in the synthesis of CDs due to their complex structure; the structure and surface state of coal-based CDs have a great influence on luminescence behavior, but the mechanism of photoluminescence is still not well understood; the modification-inducing effect of different surface functional groups of CDs on electrode materials and their contribution to capacitance are not yet clear. Therefore, comparing the differences in fluorescence properties of CDs prepared from coal and its derivatives, combined with differences in the structure of the carbon source, is of great significance in deriving a universal photoluminescence mechanism. Such a situation poses both huge opportunities and challenges to chemists in designing and developing novel coal-based CDs composite materials for photocatalytic and electrochemical applications. We firmly believe that the number of studies on coal-based CDs for photocatalysis and energy storage will sharply grow in the near future.
