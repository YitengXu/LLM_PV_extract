    , Accepted 14th October 2020First published on 15th October 2020AbstractThe ability to manipulate heterostructures is of great importance to achieve high-performance electrocatalysts for direct water-splitting devices with excellent activity toward hydrogen production. Herein, a novel top-down strategy involving the in situ transformation of one-dimensional MoO3 nanorod arrays grafted with two-dimensional NiS nanosheets supported on a three-dimensional nickel foam skeleton is proposed. Namely, a heterostructured electrocatalyst on the Ni foam skeleton containing MoO3 nanorod arrays decorated with NiS nanosheets is synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method followed by one-step sulfidation treatment. Experimental analysis confirmed that this novel composite has the merits of a large quantity of accessible active sites, unique distribution of three different spatial dimensions, accelerated mass/electron transfer, and the synergistic effect of its components, resulting in impressive electrocatalytic properties toward the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, an advanced water-splitting electrolyzer was assembled with NiS/MoO3/NF as both the anodic and cathodic working electrode. This device requires a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to afford a water-splitting current density of 10 mA·cm−2 in basic electrolyte, outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts and even state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. More significantly, this work provides a way to revolutionize the design of heterostructured electrocatalysts for the large-scale commercial production of hydrogen using direct water-splitting devices.
1. Introduction
It is the common goal of all countries in the world to research and develop sustainable and renewable clean energy that can replace traditional fossil energy. Electrochemical water electrolysis through electricity provides a promising and efficient route to generate high-quality hydrogen fuel without carbon emission.1 Additionally, benefiting from the availability of intermittently reproducible energy technologies such as wind, solar, and biomass energy, electrocatalytic water splitting can provide efficient on-demand power and hydrogen production in remote areas.2 Consequently, by virtue of its high efficiency and rate, the electrolysis of water to generate clean hydrogen has sparked considerable research interest in recent years.3 The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a pivotal but bottleneck half-reaction in water-splitting devices and rechargeable metal–air batteries. This reaction is severely restricted by its sluggish kinetics, resulting in a high overpotential and deficient energy conversion efficiency.4 Therefore, cost-efficient electrocatalysts are highly desirable to decrease the activation barrier and accelerate the catalytic reaction rate of the OER. Presently, state-of-the-art Ir/Ru-based and Pt-based electrocatalysts are generally used to improve the efficiency of the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water-splitting devices due to their unique catalytic characteristics.5,6 Unfortunately, their large-scale practical applications are hampered by their demerits, which include scarcity, high cost, and inferior stability. As such, it remains imperative to pursue novel advanced electrocatalysts with low cost, high activity, and long life span as alternatives to precious platinum group metals.
To overcome the above obstacles, increasing efforts have been devoted to designing and constructing bifunctional electrocatalysts for water-splitting devices based on transition metals and their derivatives due to their low cost and abundant reserves.5 Recently, transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for the OER owing to their environmental benignity and desirable catalytic performance compared to the numerous alternatives.6 In addition, the synthetic procedures for preparing TMSs are relatively convenient and safe and require little energy compared to transition metal nitrides/phosphides, which frequently require tedious multiple steps and high-temperature treatment under the protection of inert gas.7 Based on the above advantages, Zhao and co-workers synthesized a series of Co–S@PB, Co–Fe–S@PB, and Ni–Fe–S@PB nanoboxes with two different morphologies through a simple and robust strategy. Electrochemical measurements revealed that Co–Fe–S@PB required a low overpotential (286 mV) to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER in alkaline medium.8 Additionally, Guo and co-workers prepared hollow Fe-doped Co–Mo sulfide (H–Fe–CoMoS) hybrids by applying a multiscale optimization strategy. The obtained H–Fe–CoMoS heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibited outstanding activity with two overpotentials of 137 and 282 mV ordered to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the HER and OER, respectively.9 Nevertheless, the electrocatalytic properties of TMS materials for electrochemical water splitting are still far from satisfactory and urgently need to be significantly improved.
Traditional electrodes are normally prepared by drop-casting the catalyst powder onto the surface of a current collector with a binder to stabilize the catalyst.9 Regrettably, the supported catalysts are inevitably peeled off from the current collector due to the insufficient bonding strength. In addition, the use of Nafion polymer as a binder can deteriorate the conductivity of the electrode and partially encumber the active sites exposed on the surface, resulting in a decrease in the electrocatalytic performance.10 To address these issues, the direct growth of electrocatalytic materials on three-dimensional (3D) conductive substrates such as carbon cloth (CC), titanium foam (TF), and nickel foam (NF) to form self-supported working electrodes without any organic binders is a desirable strategy.11 The formation of a 3D conductive substrate provides multiple channels for electrolyte penetration from all sides of the catalyst rather than a single channel for penetration like for flat-surfaced electrodes. Metallic NF has the advantages of large surface area, superior electrical conductivity, and spongy 3D mass/electron transport pathways and has been demonstrated to be a promising substrate in various important energy conversion and storage technologies.12
Motivated by the above considerations, in this work, we proposed an easily manipulated and well-developed hydrothermal process for the synthesis of 3D-networked heterostructured electrocatalysts consisting of one-dimensional (1D) MoO3 nanorod arrays strongly coupled with two-dimensional (2D) NiS nanosheets. The corresponding self-supporting structured electrode integrates the following merits: (i) the NiS/MoO3/NF nanosheets/nanorods possess abundant epitaxially heterogeneous interfaces;13 (ii) the 2D NiS nanosheets endow the catalyst with abundantly exposed active sites and fast transfer ability;14 (iii) the strong synergistic effect of NiS and MoO3 can optimize the adsorption/desorption energy of reaction intermediates;15 and (iv) the 3D-networked NF with regular mesopores boosts the mass/electron transfer, promoting the release of H2 and O2 during the two-electrode reaction process.16
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of NiMoO4 nanorod arrays on NF
NiMoO4/NF was fabricated by a standard hydrothermal method according to the previously reported method.17 Before the fabrication process, a piece of commercial nickel foam (2 × 2 cm2) was cleaned by ethanol, deionized water, and HCl for several minutes and then rinsed to remove surface impurities. The pre-treated substrate was placed into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave containing 20 mL aqueous solution of 40 mM nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate [Ni(NO3)26·H2O] and 10 mM ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O] maintained at a temperature of 150 °C for 6 h. After the reaction system naturally returned to room temperature, the product was collected and then rinsed with ethanol and deionized water several times. Finally, the product was dried at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum.
2.1 Preparation of NiS nanosheets on NiMoO4/NF
NiS/MoO3/NF was synthesized by a one-step sulfidation treatment. For the synthesis of NiS/MoO3/NF, a piece of as-prepared NiMoO4/NF (1 × 2 cm2) was soaked for 2 h in a thioacetamide (TAA) precursor solution, which was prepared by dissolving 100 mg TAA in 5 mL distilled water and 10 mL absolute ethanol. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at a temperature of 120 °C for 3 h. After the reaction, the reactor was permitted to cool naturally to room temperature. Finally, the product was collected and washed with ethanol and deionized water in turn. For comparison, the NiS/NF was prepared in a similar manner to NiS/MoO3/NF but in the absence of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O in the first hydrothermal step. MoO3/NF was synthesized according to the literature. The pre-treated NF was placed in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave containing 20 mL of an aqueous solution of 247 mg (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and 50 mg PVP (MW: 58000) maintained at a temperature of 100 °C for 18 h.
2.3 Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted on a Hitachi S-4700 instrument operated at 15 kV under high vacuum and integrated with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on a Hitachi HT7700 instrument at 120 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a VG scientific ESCALab 220XL electron spectrometer using 300 W Al Kα radiation. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the products were collected on a X'Pert-pro MPD diffractometer (Netherlands PANalytical) equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray source.
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
The CHI760E electrochemical workstation fabricated by Chen Hua Instrumental was employed for all electrochemical measurements. The OER and HER electrochemical tests were carried out in a standard three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution employing a graphite rod as the counter electrode, a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and freshly prepared NiS/MoO3/NF (1 cm2) as the working electrode. Reference electrode values were calculated using the following formula: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 pH + 0.197 V. For two-electrode water electrocatalysis, two pieces (1 cm2) of NiS/MoO3/NF electrodes were used as the anode and cathode. The polarization plots of the OER and HER activity were recorded by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The LSV curve of overall water electrolysis was recorded from 1.0 to 1.7 V (vs. RHE) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. The electrochemical active surface area was estimated by double-layer capacitance (Cdl) measurement with unequal scan rates (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mV s−1). The long-term durability was assessed by chronopotentiometric test at fixed current density. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted in the frequency range from 0.01 to 100 kHz. All polarization curves were corrected by current–resistance compensation within the cell (90% iR compensation). Additionally, the overpotential (η) was examined to a RHE according to the following equation: η(V) = ERHE − 1.23 V.18
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the novel top-down synthetic strategy for heterostructured NiS/MoO3/NF. The heterostructured NiS/MoO3/NF was first fabricated by growing NiMoO4 nanorod arrays on the pre-treated surface of the NF skeleton followed by sulfidation. In the first step of the hydrothermal process, the high-purity NF served as both the nickel source and conductive substrate due to its porous network and multidimensional mass/electron transport pathway. During the next sulfidation, TAA was decomposed into H2S gas at elevated temperature, which then reacted with the NiMoO4 precursor to generate NiS nanosheets on the surfaces of the nanorod arrays.19 The specific reaction process is presented in the following eqn (1)–(4).20–22 To the naked eye, the color of NF evolved from light gray to dark yellow and ultimately to black during the preparation process (Fig. S1†). From a microscale perspective, the SEM images demonstrate that the NiMoO4 nanorod arrays with smooth surfaces grew uniformly on the 3D porous NF (Fig. 4). After immersion in the TAA solution followed by sulfidation, the superstructure of the entire system was well preserved. Interestingly, the MoO3 nanorods were fully decorated with defective NiS nanosheets, which were tightly interconnected with each other. The TEM images of the NiS/MoO3/NF at different magnifications further confirmed the SEM results (Fig. 2d–f and S2†). Moreover, detailed observation revealed that the NiS/MoO3 nanorods were highly porous with many tiny internal pores, which would be favorable for boosting electrocatalytic reactions by providing richly exposed active sites.23

In the Fig. S3,† X-ray diffraction (XRD) technology was commandeered to characterize the composition and crystal structure of NiS/MoO3/NF, expect for the typical peaks of NF, there are some distinct XRD diffraction peaks can be assigned to the MoO3 (PDF#75-0912) and NiS (PDF#86-2280), respectively. The EDX mapping and HRTEM measurements was investigated to confirm the MoO3 nanorods fully decorated with defective NiS nanosheets, which are interconnected with each other (Fig. 2g and h). Besides, Ni, Mo, O, and S are not distributed uniformly throughout the NiS/MoO3, demonstrating the successful fabrication of the NiS/MoO3 heterostructure, which may thus induce the strong synergistic effect between MoO3 and NiS.24 (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O → (NH4)6Mo7O24 + 4H2O(1) 7Ni2+ + Mo7O246− + 4H2O → 7NiMoO4↓ + 8H+(2) CH3CSNH2 + H2O → H2S↑ + CH3CONH2(3) H2S + NiMoO4 → NiS + MoO3 + H2O(4)
Additionally, SEM-EDS and XPS were utilized to gain further insight into the composition of NiS/MoO3/NF. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the XPS survey spectrum and EDX patterns demonstrate the existence of Ni, Mo, O, and S elements, confirming the successful fabrication of heterostructured NiS/MoO3/NF composites. Specifically, as presented in Fig. 3c, the characteristic peaks of Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 for NiS/MoO3/NF are located at around 874.5 and 857 eV, respectively. Similarly, the deconvoluted XPS pattern of the Mo 3d peak suggests a couple of characteristic peaks at binding energies of 232.2 and 235.1 eV, which can be attributed to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 of the Mo4+ oxidation state (Fig. 3d).12 Moreover, the fine-scanned O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3e) could also be deconvoluted into two well-defined peaks at binding energies of 530.8 and 532.4 eV, which are associated with the Mo–O bonds and oxygen defects, respectively, suggesting the generation of MoO3.25 Furthermore, the peaks in the S 2p spectrum (Fig. 3d) at binding energies of 162 and 163.8 eV could be well indexed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals of divalent sulfide ions (S2−), indicating the formation of NiS.26 The XPS analyses thus further confirmed the successful fabrication of heterostructured NiS/MoO3/NF composites.

Considering that sulfidation treatment can substantially affect the surface features and electrochemical properties of catalysts, the geometric structure and chemical compositions of NiMoO4/NF were further investigated. As seen in Fig. 4a and b, the vertically aligned nanorod morphology of NiMoO4/NF remained intact, which will facilitate mass transport and electron transfer and boost the release of gaseous products.27 The TEM images in the Fig. 4c and d show that the surfaces of the NiMoO4 nanorods were highly smooth, remarkably different from the porous nature of NiS/MoO3/NF. In addition to the geometric shape and surface features, the chemical composition of NiMoO4/NF was also probed by SEM-EDS and XPS. As is illustrated in Fig. 4e and f, the presence of Ni, Mo, and O in the SEM-EDS and XPS spectra also confirmed the generation of NiMoO4/NF composites.

Electrochemical measurements were conducted to evaluate the catalytic performance of the 3D porous NF-supported NiS/MoO3 composites toward the OER. The corresponding current densities were normalized to the geometric area of the working electrode. For the sake of reflection, the intrinsic activity of anodic materials, the advantages of the optimized NiS/MoO3/NF were compared with various reference materials such as bare NF, NiS/NF, MoO3/NF, and NiMoO4/NF. Fig. 5a–c and S5† present the CV and LSV polarization plots at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Impressively, NiS/MoO3/NF exhibited an obviously improved electrocatalytic activity with overpotentials of 221 and 306 mV to deliver current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, making it superior to bare NF, NiS/NF, MoO3/NF, and NiMoO4/NF. This convincingly demonstrates the significance of the sulfidation treatment. More importantly, the OER performance of NiS/MoO3/NF is competitive with recently reported materials (Table S1†). The Tafel plots of different electrocatalytic materials derived from the polarization curves were also investigated to shed light on the kinetic mechanism of the OER process. Remarkably, the heterostructured NiS/MoO3/NF showed an apparently smaller Tafel slope of 70.9 mV dec−1 compared to bare NF (144.6 mV dec−1) and NiMoO4/NF (111.1 mV dec−1), highlighting the effective improvement in OER kinetics28 (Fig. 5d). In additions, we investigated the electron transfer capability of NiS/MoO3/NF, bare NF, and NiMoO4/NF. As shown in Fig. 5e, NiS/MoO3/NF displayed the smallest impedance arc radius among the investigated electrocatalysts, indicating that the synergistic and electronic effect can effectively boost the intrinsic electron transfer capability of NiS/MoO3/NF for OER electrocatalysis.29 Finally, chronopotentiometry was applied to assess the electrochemical durability of NiS/MoO3/NF under operating conditions. After a continuous 15 h test, the potential at a specific current density of 10 mA cm−2 was negligibly changed, as shown in Fig. 5f, demonstrating its robustness for OER electrocatalysis.

In addition to OER electrocatalysis, the as-prepared NiS/MoO3/NF also showed great promise for boosting the HER due to the strong synergistic effect coupled with the electronic effect between NiS and MoO3, which faciliated the hydrogen adsorption energies (ΔGH*).30 Taking inspiration from this, the electrocatalytic HER performance of NiS/MoO3/NF in alkaline media was studied. Fig. 6a displays the typical LSV polarization curves of NiS/MoO3/NF, NiMoO4/NF, and pure NF at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Remarkably, NiS/MoO3/NF displayed substantially better electrocatalytic performance than NiMoO4/NF and pure NF, implying that the interfacial effect is responsible for promoting the electrocatalytic HER activity.31 For ease of comparison, the overpotentials of different catalysts at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 are summarized in Fig. 6b. Clearly, an overpotential of only 150 mV is required for NiS/MoO3/NF, far below those required for NiMoO4/NF (202 mV) and pure NF (233 mV). This clearly confirms the outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance of NiS/MoO3/NF. To further to assess the electrocatalytic performance of NiS/MoO3/NF, some important evaluation indictors are shown in Fig. S6.† The smallest Tafel slope and Nyquist plots indicate that NiS/MoO3/NF has the fastest kinetics and best HER performance among the evaluated electrocatalysts. In addition, CP measurements of NiS/MoO3/NF for the HER were conducted to further evaluate the electrochemical stability. As illustrated in Fig. S6d,† no significant decrease in activity was observed for NiS/MoO3/NF after 20 h of operation, demonstrating the robust stability.

To simulate a realistic commercial application, a two-electrode configuration was assembled using NiS/MoO3/NF as both the anodic and cathodic working electrode. As seen in Fig. 6c, with increasing cell potential voltage, more bubbles were observed and released, suggesting effective water splitting to generate H2 and O2. More importantly, as shown in Fig. 6d, to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a cell voltage of only 1.56 V was provided, which is competitive with recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts and even close to the state-of-art Pt/C//RuO2 couple, further demonstrating the excellent electrocatalytic performance (Table S2†). The stability is of paramount importance for practical applications. Therefore, the long-term overall water-splitting stability was assessed at a constant current of 10 mA cm−2, and the potential response of NiS/MoO3/NF is shown in Fig. S7.† The cell voltage required to drive 10 mA cm−2 showed no obvious growth but gradually decreased. These results indicate the robust stability of NiS/MoO3/NF.
Importantly, the surface of the electrocatalytic material generally undergoes component restructuring and atomic rearrangement under realistic electrochemical working conditions. The real active sites for electrocatalytic reaction may no longer be the pristine component. To understand the precise active site in water splitting, post-catalytic PXRD, TEM, EDX, HRTEM, and EDX analyses of NiS/MoO3/NF were conducted. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the morphology of the entire system did not change significantly. According to the EDX elemental mapping images, Ni, Mo, O, and S were not distributed uniformly throughout NiS/MoO3, demonstrating that NiS and MoO3 still existed in the post-catalytic system. However, the compositions of S and Mo were slightly decreased after the CP test due to the dissolution of sulfur under electrochemical working conditions. Additionally, the XRD pattern and HRTEM image confirmed that the Ni center in the NiS nanosheets partially transformed into NiOOH in the alkaline working environment. NiOOH generally functions as an active species for electrochemical reactions such as the HER, OER, and ORR.32–34 Combined with above experimental results and previous works, the Mo center with good conductivity and high stability is the main reaction site for chemisorption and O–H bond cleavage of H2O, while the Ni center transformed into active NiOOH during the catalytic process is the site of hydrogen evolution. As a result of the above in-depth investigation and post-electrolytic analyses, the superior electrocatalytic performance of NiS/MoO3/NF for the OER, HER, and overall water splitting is ascribed to the strong synergistic effect between the 1D MoO3 nanorods and 2D NiS nanosheets. On one hand, the nanorods and nanosheets afford a large electroactive surface area, which is convenient for accelerating the transportation of intermediates and active species.35 On the other hand, the unique heterostructured nanostructure accelerates electron transfer and mass transport and facilitates the release of gas bubbles, further promoting the electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the strong synergistic effect and electronic effect between MoO3 and NiS also faciliated the electrocatalytic reaction by optimizing the surface adsorption energy.36

4. Conclusions
To summarize, novel NiS/MoO3/NF heterostructured nanorods/nanosheets were rationally constructed via a hydrothermal method followed by sulfidation treatment to serve as a bi-functional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The derived heterogeneous materials provide both oxide (MoO3) and sulfide (NiS), making the NiS/MoO3 electrode an efficient electrocatalyst for boosting the OER and HER performance. The as-prepared NiS/MoO3/NF electrocatalyst requires overpotentials of just 221 and 306 mV to deliver current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm−2 for the OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. Additionally, the resulting composites with 1D/2D/3D organization not only reduce the resistance of mass/electron transfer, but also simplify the release of the evolved H2/O2 bubbles. Significantly, we assembled an outstanding water electrolyzer for overall water splitting with the NiS/MoO3 on NF serving as both the cathode and anode electrodes. This device requires a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Significantly, our results provide guidance for the further rational design and preparation of transmission metal derivates based on a deep understanding of the synergistic effect for water-splitting applications.
