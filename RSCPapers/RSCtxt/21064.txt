    , Accepted 20th April 2022First published on 20th April 2022AbstractAll-small-molecule OSCs (ASM-OSCs) are more suitable for commercial-scale manufacturing owing to the merits of small molecules, such as well-defined chemical molecular structures, easy synthesis, and less batch-to-batch variation. With the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors, the design of small molecule donors and the optimization of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology will play a greater role in improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of ASM-OSCs. Herein, a novel small molecule donor, BTR-SCl, with alkylthio and chlorine substituents on the side-chains was designed and synthesized. BTR-SCl exhibits strong absorption in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm with a wide optical bandgap of 1.77 eV, a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.51 eV, and strong crystallization properties. Consequently, a PCE of 14.6% was obtained from BTR-SCl:Y6 solar cells with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 23.4 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.8%. Notably, with the incorporation of polymer PM7 as a morphology modulator, the BTR-SCl:Y6 matrix achieved well-formed bicontinuous interpenetrating networks and ordered molecular packing. As a result, PM7-optimized devices achieved a significantly enhanced PCE of 15.8% with a higher Jsc of 24.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 73.1%.
1. Introduction
Organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have achieved tremendous strides due to their unique merits of light weight, low cost and flexibility, revealing a bright future for their large-area commercial production.1–6 All-small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs) have attracted more attention in recent years due to the features of small molecules, such as their high purity, precise molecular weight, well-defined molecular structure and negligible batch-to-batch variation.7–10 With the advent of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), especially Y6 and its derivatives, the performance of devices based on ASM-OSCs has been greatly improved and has surpassed 15% for binary solar cells11–14 and exceeded 16% for ternary solar cells.15,16 Despite the rapid development of ASM-OSCs in recent years, their performance still lags behind that of polymer solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 19%.17–20 Unlike PSCs, the unique feature of crystalline blends in ASM-OSCs is the easy formation of a dispersed morphology rather than bicontinuous interpenetrating networks, and a short conjugation length is unfavorable for exciton dissociation and charge transport, ultimately leading to a low short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).11,21 Thus, it is urgent to develop novel active layer materials and morphological regulation methods to manipulate the phase separation and molecular arrangement in blends with promising NFAs to further promote the performance of ASM-OSCs.
Generally, small molecule donors (SMDs) feature a typical backbone structure of the A–π–D–π–A type. By tuning the central core,22,23 side-chains,7–10,12,24 end groups,25–27 and conjugated π-bridges,28 different SMDs demonstrate different properties and device performances.29 To improve the photovoltaic performance of ASM-OSCs, many research groups have made considerable efforts toward the development of small molecule active layer materials. Notably, introducing functional substituents on benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) side chains, such as sulfur (S),30 silicon,31 and halogen atoms (F and Cl),7–9 is an effective method to tune the absorption spectrum, energy levels and molecular packing. For example, Lu et al. developed a new liquid crystalline molecule named BTR-Cl, by replacing the two bulky hexyl groups on the BDT core of BTR with two small electronegative chlorine (Cl) atoms,7 which possesses a more ordered liquid crystalline property, downshifted molecular energy levels, and higher crystallinity. Blending with Y6, an impressive PCE of 13.6% was achieved in ASM-OSCs. By combining the synergistic effect of fluorination and sulfuration, Zhu et al. reported a new small molecule donor named BSFTR.9 Their corresponding devices using Y6 as an acceptor exhibit impressive PCEs of approximately 14%, mainly benefiting from matched photoelectric properties, favorable phase separation and good crystallinity of the materials. These studies suggest that introducing functional substituents on the side chains of BDT could be a promising strategy to alter π–π stacking of SMDs, which can lead to an appropriate morphology in blend films for high-performance optoelectronic devices.
In addition to the key role of halogens in molecular design, alkylthio side chains also play an important role in organic optoelectronic material design. Conjugated polymer donors and SMDs based on sulfur-alkyl substituents can effectively lower the low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, slightly increase the absorption coefficient, and enhance hole mobility, thus improving the overall photovoltaic performance.30,32,33 Here, a new SMD, BTR-SCl with alkylthio and Cl substituents on the side chains, was designed and synthesized. BTR-SCl has appropriate energy levels with a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.51 eV and a complementary absorption spectrum with Y6. In addition, BTR-SCl also exhibits high crystallinity and ordered molecular packing to facilitate charge transport. Thus, BTR-SCl:Y6-based devices achieve an optimized PCE of 14.6% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 23.4 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.8%. To the best of our knowledge, this value of Voc is the highest among the ASM-OSCs with PCE exceeding 14%, and the devices exhibit a low energy loss (Eloss) of 0.50 eV. Considering the potential of polymers as morphology modulators to optimize the miscibility and molecular packing in a high-efficiency ASM-OSC system,34 the p-type conjugated polymer PM7 was introduced into the blend of BTR-SCl:Y6 to optimize the blend morphology. As a result, devices with 4 wt% PM7 exhibited an outstanding PCE of 15.8% with improved Jsc of 24.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 73.1%.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Materials synthesis, theoretical calculations and crystalline properties
The synthetic route of BTR-SCl is displayed in Scheme S1,† and the detailed synthetic processes and characterization data are provided in the materials synthesis section in the ESI.† Theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the geometry and frontier molecular orbitals of BTR-SCl by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The long alkyl chains were replaced by a methyl group to facilitate calculation. DFT calculations show that the dihedral angle between the side chain thiophene and BDT was 58.9° (Fig. 1a). The molecular energy levels and wave function distributions of the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are provided in Fig. S1.† Both the HOMO and LUMO of BTR-SCl are delocalized along the entire π-conjugated backbone of the molecule. BTR-SCl dissolves well in typical halogenated solvents such as chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB), and presents good thermal stability with a high decomposition temperature for 5% weight loss up to 372 °C, based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in nitrogen (Fig. S2†). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was applied to further evaluate the molecular crystallinity. The DSC curve shows a pronounced melting peak at 247 °C with a melting enthalpy of 18.02 J g−1 and an obvious exothermic peak at 211 °C with a crystal enthalpy of 19.27 J g−1. Notably, upon heating, BTR-SCl also exhibits three endothermic peaks at 151 °C, 231 °C and 247 °C (Fig. 1b). This phenomenon is very similar to that of the reported liquid crystalline donors BTR-Cl and L2, except the higher phase transition temperatures, which may indicate stronger intermolecular interactions and crystallinity.7,13 Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to further investigate the molecular packing properties of BTR-SCl. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the neat BTR-SCl film displays distinctive (100), (200), and (300) lamellar peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction with q values of ca. 0.31 Å−1, 0.62 Å−1, and 0.92 Å−1, and a well-defined (010) π–π stacking peak in the in-plane (IP) direction at 1.74 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 3.62 Å, suggesting a typical stacking mode of edge-on molecular orientation. A similar edge-on stacking orientation with higher order (h00) peaks has been found in some highly efficient small molecule donors.7,12–14 The presence of higher order (h00) peaks and long-range ordered π–π stacking implies well-ordered molecular packing and strong crystallization propensity in the BTR-SCl film.35 The crystallinity and stacking of the materials are important factors for the charge carrier mobility. Therefore, we analyzed the hole mobilities (μh) by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model; the μh of the BTR-SCl neat film is 2.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S3†).

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) absorption spectra of BTR-SCl and Y6 are displayed in Fig. 2a. In dilute chloroform solution, BTR-SCl exhibits a maximum absorption peak at 517 nm. After film formation, the maximum absorption peak redshifts to 578 nm and a new shoulder peak appears at 623 nm, implying better molecular π–π stacking in the thin film state.36 The absorption edge of the BTR-SCl film is 700 nm with an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.77 eV (Eoptg = 1240/λedge), indicating a complementary absorption spectrum with Y6, which is conducive to achieving high Jsc in the device. From cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S4†), the energy level of active layer materials was obtained. As depicted in Fig. 2b, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels are −5.51 eV/–3.62 eV for BTR-SCl. The HOMO value is deeper than the similarly alkyl-substituted BTR37 (−5.34 eV), resulting from the synergetic effects of S and Cl substituents, which is favorable for a higher Voc. In addition, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Y6 are calculated to be −5.65 eV and −4.10 eV; the suitable energy level offsets between BTR-SCl and Y6 will ensure efficient exciton dissociation.

2.3. Photovoltaic performance
Conventional photovoltaic devices with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/BTR-SCl:Y6/poly(9,9-bis(30-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)) PFN-Br/Ag were fabricated. The measurement of devices was performed under a simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) in a nitrogen atmosphere. The main J–V curves and photovoltaic device parameters are presented in Fig. 3a and Table 1. The fabrication conditions including donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios, thermal annealing (TA) temperature and time were carefully optimized. The detailed parameters for the optimization procedure are summarized in Fig. S5–S7 and Tables S1–S3.† The as-cast devices show very poor performance with a very low PCE of 0.05%, which could be caused by inferior phase separation. After annealing at 120 °C for 10 minutes, the devices exhibited a dramatically improved PCE of 14.6% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 23.4 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.8%. According to the reported literature, a small amount of polymer with high viscosity introduced into ASM-OSCs can modulate the miscibility and improve the crystallinity of the blends, which accelerates the charge transfer and improves the PCE.34 Similarly, the photovoltaic properties of BTR-SCl:Y6 can be further improved to 15.8% by adding 4 wt% PM7 (ref. 38) as a polymer additive, mainly due to the increase of Jsc from 23.4 mA cm−2 to 24.5 mA cm−2 and FF from 70.8% to 73.1% while maintaining a high Voc. However, with further increasing polymer additive PM7 content, Voc and FF show a significant downwards trend, and the efficiency decreases accordingly (Fig. S8 and Table S4†). Fig. 3b displays the efficiency distribution histogram for 20 independent measurements with or without PM7 devices, showing a Gaussian distribution. The aforementioned Jsc was further confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement in Fig. 3c. Notably, the devices processed with a small amount of PM7 exhibit a stronger photon to electron response in the range of 450–700 nm. The maximum value of EQE is 84.1% at 525 nm, much higher than the 78.8% at 530 nm without PM7 devices. Such an EQE enhancement in the short wavelength region is in reasonable agreement with the enhanced absorbance of the BTR-SCl:Y6 blend with 4 wt% PM7 (Fig. S9a†), probably resulting from the improved maximum absorption coefficient of PM7 (0.78 × 105 cm−1) in comparison with that of BTR-SCl (0.6 × 105 cm−1) (Fig. S9b†). The integrated Jsc values from the EQE measurement agree well with those from the J–V curves with ≈2% mismatch, thus confirming the reliability of the test results.

2.4. Energy loss

Fig. 3d and Tables S5 and S6† summarize the key device parameters for representative high-efficiency ASM-OSCs and PSCs based on SMDs as a third component. To the best of our knowledge, this value of Voc is the highest among the ASM-OSCs with PCE exceeding 14%. This value of Voc also has some advantages over the ternary PSCs based on SMDs as a third component, although there is a gap in PCE. The high Voc of the BTR-SCl:Y6 system inspired us to explore the Eloss characteristics of the devices.
We determined the Eloss following the framework of Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit theory. The Eloss in solar cells can be sorted into three parts, and a detailed description is provided in the ESI†Eloss measurement section.39,40 It is widely known that ΔE1 is inevitable for any solar cell and relies only on the photovoltaic band gap energy (EPVg) of the absorber for a definite solar spectrum and temperature.23 Herein, EPVg was determined to be 1.38 eV calculated from the derivatives of the EQE spectra, as shown in Fig. S10a and b.†40 Then, we used EPVg to calculate ΔE1, and the BTR-SCl:Y6 with or without PM7 both show a ΔE1 value of 0.26 eV. ΔE2 represents additional radiative recombination originating from the absorption below the bandgap, and Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) was then measured to evaluate it, as shown in Fig. S10c.† As a result, ΔE2 for the BTR-SCl:Y6 blend films with or without PM7 is estimated to be as low as 0.03 eV, which is significantly smaller than that observed in typical OSCs. ΔE3 indicates the nonradiative recombination loss, which is also the main part causing the Eloss, and it could be evaluated by measuring electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) spectra (Fig. S10d†), where EQEEL is the radiative quantum efficiency of the photovoltaic device when charge carriers are injected under dark conditions. The EQEEL values for BTR-SCl:Y6 and BTR-SCl:Y6 (4 wt% PM7) blend films were measured to be 2.6 × 10−4 and 2.5 × 10−4. Thus, the BTR-SCl:Y6-based OSCs with or without PM7 both exhibit a low ΔE3 of ∼0.21 eV, and the total Eloss is 0.50 eV. Therefore, the simultaneously lower ΔE2 and ΔE3 values were the major reasons for the high Voc of BTR-SCl-based devices. With the addition of PM7, the original Eloss parameters remain almost unchanged, with only a slight reduction in EQEEL, and the advantage of high Voc is still maintained. The corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S7.†
2.5. Exciton dissociation, and charge recombination and transport
To investigate the outstanding photovoltaic properties of BTR-SCl:Y6 OSCs, we meticulously analyzed the charge generation, transport, extraction and recombination processes. First, to study the charge transport properties in OSCs, the hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) of the optimized blend films were evaluated by fitting the dark current density with SCLC model.41 As depicted in Fig. 4a and S11,† the μh/μe of BTR-SCl:Y6 blend films were 3.87/3.25 × 10−4 m2 V−1 s−1, which correspond to a μh/μe ratio of 1.19. Notably, PM7-treated devices exhibited higher and more balanced charge-carrier mobility, and the μh, μe and μh/μe values were determined to be 4.83 × 10−4 m2 V−1 s−1, 4.42 × 10−4 m2 V−1 s−1 and 1.09, respectively. This result agrees well with the variation in Jsc and FF in the corresponding devices, as charge carriers with high mobility can be transported to the electrode more quickly and balanced charge transport can minimize the impact of space-charge formation.42,43
 Fig. 4  (a) Hole and electron mobilities, (b) Jph–Veff curves, (c) transient photocurrent curves, (d) transient photovoltage curves, and dependence of Jsc (e) and Voc (f) on different light intensities of the BTR-SCl:Y6 and BTR-SCl:Y6 (4 wt% PM7) OSCs. 
We plotted the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) for all optimized devices to understand the charge generation and dissociation rates (Fig. 4b). Jph is defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current density under AM 1.5G illumination and dark current density, respectively, and Veff = V0 − V, where V0 and V are the voltage at JL = JD and the applied bias voltage, respectively.44 The values of exciton dissociation probability and charge collection probability for BTR-SCl:Y6 without and with PM7 optimized devices were calculated to be 97.1%/84.0% and 99.4%/84.5% under the short-circuit and maximum power output conditions, respectively. Obviously, the devices with PM7 showed a higher dissociation probability value indicating that the phase separation and molecular arrangement may be finely modulated to acquire efficient charge generation and extraction. Photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were also employed to investigate the photogenerated charge separation at the D/A interface. As illustrated in Fig. S12,† when the BTR-SCl pure film was excited at 652 nm or the Y6 pure film was excited at 820 nm, the BTR-SCl:Y6 blend film showed 98.8% and 97.7% quenching efficiencies, and the quenching efficiencies of the blend film with 4 wt% PM7 treatment were further increased to 99.6% and 98.5%. A higher PL quenching efficiency means more efficient exciton dissociation between the donor and acceptor in the blend films, which is mainly responsible for its higher device performance.
Transient measurements on devices with laser perturbation were used to measure the dynamics of free charges. The charge extraction time can be obtained by fitting the transient photocurrent (TPC) decay curves under short circuit conditions.45 As depicted in Fig. 4c, the charge extraction time of the BTR-SCl:Y6 devices is fitted to be 0.20 μs. A shorter charge extraction time of 0.15 μs was obtained in PM7-treated devices, which has an inseparable relationship with high and balanced charge carrier mobility. Meanwhile, the charge recombination characteristic was further analyzed by studying the photocarrier lifetime, which can be evaluated via performing transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements under open-circuit conditions (Fig. 4d). The carrier lifetime was extracted from fitting of the TPV signal, and values of 1.74 and 2.95 μs were obtained for the without and with PM7-optimized devices, respectively.46 The longer carrier lifetime indicates more effectively suppressed carrier recombination, which contributes to the enhanced Jsc and FF in PM7-treated devices.
The dependence of Jsc and Voc on light intensity (Plight) was analyzed to further determine the behaviour of charge recombination in devices. The relationship between Jsc and Plight helps to analyze the bimolecular recombination degree in devices under short-circuit conditions, which can be expressed by the formula Jsc ∝ Ps, where s is the exponential factor. If all free charges could be swept out and collected without bimolecular recombination, s would be equal to 1.47 As suggested in Fig. 4e, the BTR-SCl:Y6 system displayed low bimolecular recombination whether with or without PM7, as the s values were 0.985 and 0.974, respectively. Additionally, as indicated in Fig. 4f, the slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) for the PM7-treated BTR-SCl:Y6 devices is 1.09kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, and q is the elementary charge), lower than that of the conventional devices of 1.28kT/q. The lower slope values of PM7-treated devices are close to 1.0 kT/q, indicating substantially suppressed trap-assisted recombination,48 which could be responsible for their higher Jsc and FF values.
2.6. Blend morphology characterization
Charge transfer and recombination are also affected by the morphology of the active layer. The surface and bulk morphologies of the BTR-SCl:Y6 blend were investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as depicted in Fig. S13† and 5a–c. The root mean square (RMS) of the as-cast, TA, and 4 wt% PM7-treated blend films was measured to be 1.19, 2.46, and 2.01 nm, respectively. Blends under the as-cast conditions feature a scattered crystallite-like morphology (Fig. S13a and d†). Additionally, the TEM image also shows inapparent phase separation (Fig. 5a), accounting for the quite low Jsc and FF values in the as-cast film. After TA treatment, a larger domain size can be observed from AFM images because of crystallite growth (Fig. S13b and e†). A more defined phase separation of the donors and acceptors with a bi-continuous interpenetrating network was observed in the TEM image (Fig. 5b). In particular, for PM7-optimized devices, we observe that the domain size of the blend film is reduced and the phase continuity is significantly improved (Fig. S13c and f† and 5c). This finding is likely due to the suitable miscibility of PM7, as discussed later in the contact angle section. The well-formed nanofibrous and bicontinuous interpenetrating networks favor charge generation and extraction, implying the positive effect of PM7 on morphology regulation.
 Fig. 5  TEM images (a–c), 2D GIWAXS profiles (d–f), and 1D profiles (g) along the IP and OOP directions of BTR-SCl:Y6 blend films under as-cast, TA, and 4 wt% PM7 conditions. 
To reveal the molecular packing orientation and crystallinity of the BTR-SCl:Y6 blend systems, GIWAXS measurement was carried out. The 2D patterns and 1D plots are shown in Fig. 5d–g and S14,† and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S8.† As mentioned above, the pure BTR-SCl film exhibited an edge-on stacking pattern. Upon mixing with the face-on oriented Y6, all blends tend to form a combination of face-on and edge-on orientations with a strong (100) lamellar peak in the IP and OOP directions. After TA treatment, the intensity of the (100) peak at 0.3 Å−1 in the IP direction gradually increased with crystal coherence length (CCL) values (calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) using the Scherrer equation49) increased from 66.53 to 106.70 Å, and the d-spacing decreased from 21.23 to 20.87 Å, indicating that improved crystallinity and more ordered molecular packing were obtained after TA treatment. With addition of 4 wt% PM7, the CCL values of the (100) peak in the IP direction increased to 113.10 Å, indicating further improved crystallite size in the blend film. Moreover, the PM7-treated devices show a weak (010) π–π stacking peak at 1.75 Å−1 in the OOP direction with a d-spacing of 3.59 Å, which is not visible in the as-cast and TA-treated devices. The introduction of PM7 may facilitate charge transport in the direction perpendicular to the substrate. As a result, the well-ordered π–π stacking and improved crystallite size in PM7-added devices could lead to enhanced carrier transport and collection, thus giving rise to elevated Jsc and FF.
To further explore the fundamental origin of the morphological difference, the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) of two components was calculated by contact angle measurements (Fig. 6). The χ values of the materials were calculated based on the previously reported literature (details in Table 2).50 When the χ values of the two materials are comparable, the two components will be finely intermixed and less phase separated in the blend.51 The χ values between PM7/BTR-SCl and PM7/Y6 were calculated to be 0.36κ and 0.62κ, which are much lower than the 1.96κ for BTR-SCl/Y6, indicating that the miscibility of PM7/Y6 and PM7/BTR-SCl is much better than that of BTR-SCl/Y6. The location of PM7 in binary blends was predicted by calculating the wetting coefficient (ω) by following Young's equation and Neumann's equation.52 The wetting coefficient of PM7 in BTR-SCl:Y6 blends was calculated to be −0.14, demonstrating that PM7 is located at the BTR-SCl:Y6 interface. Thus, a small amount of PM7 probably works as a strong interface binder, modulating the miscibility of the blends to reduce the domain size of phase separation and improve phase continuity, ultimately enhancing the Jsc and FF of the corresponding device.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, a novel SMD, BTR-SCl, was developed by attaching S and Cl atoms on the side chains. With the synergistic interaction of heteroatom substituents, BTR-SCl showed a broad absorption in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm, a deep-lying HOMO level of −5.51 eV, and ordered molecular packing. Hence, BTR-SCl:Y6 based OSCs achieve an optimal PCE of 14.6% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 23.4 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.8%. To the best of our knowledge, this value of Voc is the highest among the ASM-OSCs with PCE exceeding 14%, and the devices exhibit a low energy loss (Eloss) of 0.50 eV. Furthermore, incorporation of a small amount of polymer PM7 as a morphology modulator into the BTR-SCl:Y6 system achieved an excellent PCE of 15.8% with improved Jsc and FF. Our work combines material design and morphological regulation to achieve high performance ASM-OSCs.
