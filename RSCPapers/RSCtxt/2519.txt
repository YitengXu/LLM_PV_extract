    , Accepted 28th September 2016First published on 3rd October 2016AbstractMethanofullerenes such as the well-known [70]PCBM are commonly synthesized under harsh conditions to obtain the product as a mixture of site-isomers (namely α, β and minor γ) due to the D5h symmetry of the C70 cage. We report the first site-selective synthesis of [70]methanofullerenes under light irradiation and low temperatures, thus avoiding time-consuming and highly expensive HPLC separations. Pure major site-isomers α-[70]PCBM and α-[70]DPM have been thus efficiently prepared including the crystal structure of 5b. Photovoltaic preliminary results revealed a slightly beneficial performance for α-pure [70]PCBM site-isomer devices.
Polymer-based plastic solar cells have emerged in the last decade as a low-cost complement/alternative to the classical silicon photovoltaic devices. The main approach to improving the photo-conversion efficiency in organic solar cells is based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture, in which the donor–acceptor interaction at the interface is maximized.1 Fullerene derivatives, such as the well-known [60]PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester),2 and diphenylmethano[60]fullerene [60]DPM,3 have been extensively used as electron acceptor materials in BHJ due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties.4,5 Higher fullerenes such as C70 display better light absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum than [60]fullerene derivatives resulting in higher photocurrent (Jsc).6 For instance, the Jsc value of [70]PCBM is 50% higher when compared to its [60]PCBM analog.7,8 Other higher fullerenes, namely [84]PCBM, showed a low solubility and significantly lower conversion efficiencies.9
Many efforts have been made in improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). Material properties such as light absorption, HOMO–LUMO energy levels, nano-morphology and the segregation degree, just to name a few, are strongly related to the efficiency of the device.10 On the other hand, there are several examples of fullerene bisadducts in which some regioisomerically pure derivatives exhibited higher PCE values than those of the corresponding isomeric mixtures.11 Thus, control on the isomeric purity of the involved photo- and electroactive materials may be crucial to enhance a suitable molecular organization of the photoactive layer in the device.12 However, there are not many examples that illustrate the correlation between morphology and device performance. One of the reasons for the shortage of these studies is the lack of straightforward and selective methods affording isomerically pure compounds.
Controlling the morphology of the devices fabricated with [70]fullerene derivatives is a challenge because only a few synthetic methods lead to isomeric pure C70 derivatives.13,14 Unlike C60, the C70 cage is constituted by four non-equivalent double bonds (namely: α, β, γ and δ; Fig. 1) which should, in principle, lead to four site-isomers that could be isolated only by tedious and time-consuming HPLC techniques.15 Thus, most of the C70 based OPV devices are typically formed by an isomeric mixture of C70 derivatives in which usually the α and β site-isomers are the most abundant with tiny amounts of the γ isomer.16
 Fig. 1  Drawing of pristine C70 indicating the four different double bonds (α, β, γ, δ). 
Here, we report for the first time a new methodology to obtain methanofullerenes, ([70]PCBM and [70]DPM derivatives) with a high control of the site-selectivity under mild conditions. In addition, we describe for the first time the X-ray structure of a [70]DPM derivative (the α-site-isomer 5b).
The classic procedure to obtain methanofullerenes such as [70]PCBM is based on the Bamford–Stevens reaction and has previously been reported by Hummelen et al.16 This reaction involves the generation in situ of a diazocompound by thermolysis of tosylhydrazone with alkali salts. The subsequent addition to C70 leads to a mixture of two site-isomers (75:25, α:β).16 Since this procedure is carried out under drastic conditions, that is, strong bases and refluxing ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), it is not considered a suitable method to reach isomeric purity. In addition, the purification of the site-isomers from the reaction crude is not possible by silica gel chromatography, and only by using time- and solvent-consuming HPLC separation it is possible to isolate the α from the β site-isomer.
The lack of a selective synthetic method able to discriminate between site-isomers encourages us to develop a new and unprecedented methodology based on light irradiation under mild conditions, thus having a control on the site-selectivity.
The tosylhydrazone PCBM precursor was transformed into the corresponding diazocompound derivative in order to take advantage of the milder conditions offered by fullerene photochemistry (see the ESI,† page 2S).12,17
A solution of C70 and the alkylaryl-diazocompound 1 in dry toluene was irradiated at λ = 360 nm at −78 °C for 4 hours to afford compound 2 (α-site-isomer) as the main product together with a small amount of 3 (β-site-isomers). The monoadducts were isolated from unreacted C70 and bisadducts by silica gel column chromatography (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Selective synthesis of α-[70]PCBM by photochemical reaction. 
The isomeric purity was determined by NMR and HPLC resulting in a α:β ratio of 96:4 (Fig. S13, ESI†). As expected, site-isomer 2 was obtained as an enantiomeric mixture, whereas site-isomer 3 is formed by two different diastereo-isomers (3a and 3b), depending on the orientation of the ester group on an equatorial (3a) or polar (3b) position on the fullerene cage15 (Scheme 1).
To analyze the scope of this new methodology, the reaction was also carried out with diaryl-diazocompounds. These compounds are highly reactive and have been shown to behave differently from the alkylaryl-diazocompounds.12,17 When diazocompound 4 was irradiated at 360 nm in the presence of C70, the α-site-isomer 5 was exclusively formed (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Selective synthesis of α-site-isomer 5 by photochemical reaction. 
Diphenylmethano[70]fullerenes ([70]DPMs) (5ab) were also characterized by those standard techniques used for 2 and 3. The selectivity of this reaction was determined by HPLC and NMR spectroscopy. As expected, diazocompound 5 is more reactive than the PCBM precursor alkylaryl-diazocompound 1, and only −20 °C (instead of −78 °C) was low enough to reach an excellent selectivity, 100% of the α-site-isomer (5ab), whereas the corresponding β-site-isomers (6ab) were not observed (Fig. 2).

In contrast to the β-site-isomers, the 1H-NMR spectra of compounds 5ab exhibit only one set of signals evidencing the plane of symmetry across the α-bond.
The electrochemical properties of products 2, 3 and 5 were studied by cyclic voltammetry using o-DCB/MeCN (4:1) as the solvent at room temperature and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammetry of products 2 and 3. 
As expected, the first reduction potential of all monoadducts [2, 3, 5a and 5b (E1/21 = −1.13, −1.14, −1.13 and −1.13 V, respectively)] were approximately 130 mV higher than that observed for pristine C70 (E1/21 = −1.00 V). Interestingly, both isomers exhibit the same first reduction potential values within the experimental error. As is well-known, the LUMO level is directly related to the Voc parameter, which is directly correlated with the cell efficiency. In Table S1 (ESI†) the values of the reduction potential values observed for the pure compounds and their respective isomeric mixtures are shown (see the ESI†).
As preliminary results, some devices were fabricated from the pure α-[70]PCBM isomer which was obtained from the product mixture (α:β, 96:4) by HPLC. For comparison purposes, the commercially available isomeric mixture (Solenne, with an isomer composition of 83% α and 17% β according to HPLC measurements) was used for the device fabrication. The two sets of comparison are given in Fig. 4 and Table 1. As expected, the devices fabricated from pure α-[70]DPM6 exhibited lower efficiency values than those obtained for pure α-[70]PCBM (see the ESI†).

For the blend, the PffBT4T-2OD polymer was used, which is one of the most successful polymers, reaching solar energy conversion efficiencies as high as ∼10% in polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells.18 In this study, the devices were fabricated from PffBT4T-2OD with two different [70]PCBM fullerene samples. The first one was the [70]PCBM mixture from a commercial source (Solenne) and the second one was the pure α-[70]PCBM site-isomer from this study. The average efficiency was calculated from three batches of devices from three days. Comparing the pure α-site-isomer with the mixture of site-isomers, no significant difference in the photovoltaic parameters was observed. Thus, the studied systems showed a remarkable Voc as well as Jsc values, with PCEs of 6.45% for the commercial sample (Solenne) and 6.63% for the pure α-[70]PCBM site-isomer. Although more studies mostly involving aspects of the materials used such as morphology, crystallinity, the isomeric ratio in the blend and the polymer/fullerene ratio, as well as other fabrication device conditions are needed, the only conclusion at this stage is that based on the above experimental pieces of evidence, the use of the pure α-site-isomer produces a small but persistent benefit on the device performance. These experimental findings are also supported by the integrated current for the EQE for PffBT4T-2OD/α-[70]PCBM when compared with that of the Solenne mixture (14.72 vs. 14.03, see the ESI†).
α pure monoadduct 5b was unambiguously characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure was solved in the monoclinic P21/c and the asymmetric unit contains a formula unit (C95H34O2) as depicted in Fig. 5a and Fig. S18 (ESI†). The C70 moiety displays a high degree of disorder, as is usual in this type of compound, and there is also some disorder in the terminal carbon atoms from the two alkyl chains. Details of the data collection and refinement can be found in the ESI.† There is a supramolecular C–H⋯O interaction between neighbour molecules in the [001] direction that yields 1D chains (Fig. 5b). On the other hand, a π–π interaction is also present between the bottom C6 rings (defined by atoms C53F, C54F, C55F, C56F, C67F and C68F) in the C70 fullerene. These rings are completely parallel and located at a distance of 3.199 Å, with their centroids displaced from each other and separated by 3.807 Å. Each pair of molecules displaying this interaction are related by an inversion centre from the ones located in the middle of the b and c cell vectors (see Fig. S20, ESI†).

We have successfully prepared, isolated, and characterized [70]fullerene derivatives with a remarkable high isomeric purity in two different systems, namely α-[70]PCBM and α-[70]DPM (including the X-ray structure of the α-derivative, compound 5b). This new synthetic methodology to achieve selectively α-site-isomers is carried out under mild conditions using photoactivation. This unprecedented approach avoids time- and solvent-consuming HPLC separations that are usually employed in obtaining these products. As should be expected, the isomerically pure system may affect the morphology and, therefore, the performance of the devices. According to our preliminary results, pure α-[70]PCBM and its isomeric mixture obtained from commercial sources (Solenne) were tested in BHJ solar cells showing a slightly beneficial influence on the final device efficiency.
